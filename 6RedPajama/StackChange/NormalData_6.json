In that case, no. The Thunderbolt display supports one input but allows you to chain additional displays or drives using the Thunderbolt port on the back of the display.\n\nA: Well it certainly won't work simultaneously. Your display can only read input from one source and there's no way to switch that unless you get a display that supports it. The device described here seems to do what you want, all you have to do is manually switch the input when you want to change. Honestly if I was in your case I would just keep the Macbook Pro hooked up to it and use VNC and/or ssh to login your server to administrate.\n", "Q: Does TimeMachine compress iPhoto library? I'm getting TM backups whose sizes don't match the target. My 260GB content on MBA SSD may produce a 220GB backup. My ~125GB IPhoto lib may produce a 95GB backup. Yet the other 30GBs of photos in the pictures folder back up to precisely the same size as on the SSD. \nI've read TM does no compression. and I've had a tech support guy tell me that much difference (~25%) in the iPhoto lib is normal. But he hasnt explained why the size of the other pix (or music or movies, for that matter) isn't reduced. I'm left worrying My iPhoto lib isn't being backed up properly. \n\nA: No, it does not compress it, but the size of the library is in fact different:\nThe iPhoto Library is not a monolithic file, but a so called bundle (a folder disguised as a file). If you call file > Info (cmd-i), then it's size needs to be calculated, it's subfolder and files can be seen by the usual developer tools.\nSo, from the POV of time machine, or the file system in general, the iPhoto library is a huge folder with thousands of files.\nNow comes another issue into play: Storage media are organized in file sectors of fixed size. The size a file takes on disk is not the number of bytes of this file, but the number of sectors which the file occupies by the number of bytes per sector.\nThe sector size usually depends on the specific file system and media capacity.\nEven a 1-byte file takes one sector, so on a hard drive the smallest file size might be 4 KB, on a flash drive 16 kB.\nIn consequence that means that the sector size of the medium you save to has a huge impact on the overall size of your iPhoto library. I take an educated guess that the sector size of your SSD is bigger than on your backup drive.\n\nA: It doesn't compress it, but it does leave out some non-essential data. In my case, the \"iPod Photo Cache\" and the file BigBlobs.apdb (this appears to be related to iPhoto-Aperture integration), both of which likely get regenerated automatically when restoring a backup:\n$ sudo mdfind \"com_apple_backup_excludeItem = 'com.apple.backupd'\"|grep iPhoto\n/Users/chucker/Pictures/iPhoto Library/iPod Photo Cache\n/Users/chucker/Pictures/iPhoto Library/Database/BigBlobs.apdb\n\nThe sector size difference Kabe mentions may explain part of the discrepancy as well.\n\nA: It's worth pointing out that time machine does one FULL backup and every back up from then on is incremental, meaning only the differences since the previous backup are backed up rather than duplicating files. The iPhoto library may appear smeller in the backup because only a portion of it changed, and not the whole\n\nA: Over time your iPhoto Library collects a whole pad of cruft, caches, thumbnail archives, temporary areas etc that can take up a large amount of space, but are not necessarily required when restoring your data, as it can/will all be recreated on the fly as and when you open photos etc.  For this reason TM does not backup your entire machine (although it says it does) and has some inbuilt exclusion lists including these areas for iPhoto (and similar ones for iTunes too).\nBasically, don't worry about it.\n", "Q: Configuring OS X 10.7 Lion Server to serve Rails Apps via Apache I have a number of Rails Apps working just great under Snow Leopard, but would like to migrate these to Lion.\nHowever, like many others, the rug has been pulled from under my feet by the changes that have been made to Mac OS X Server admin with Lion.\nThat said, it has been straight-forward to install Rails and get my Rails app responding via the WEBrick web server.\nI'd now like to get Passenger (or equivalent) working and use Apache as the web server, with automagically launched rails apps, and associated goodness.\nHowever, the changes made to Lion appear to break Passenger, as this relies on named virtual hosts to detect invocations, and kick off the Rails Apps under Apache.  I've tried using the method described in Apple's support note advice for Apache named hosts, - but I've had no joy :-/\nIt seems that I may need to bite the bullet and use the new Lion Server web app config mechanism to specify Rails dependencies, and launch the Rails Apps that way.\nHas anyone had any success with configuring Lion Server to serve Rails Apps via Apache?\nAny pointers and tips would be appreciated.\nbtw, I'm using a new Mac mini, so this is a clean install of Lion, and going back to SL isn't an option :-/\n\nA: I've done some experimentation in order to answer my own question...\nFirstly, I've only gotten the virtual named host kludge working with Passenger, not the new Lion scheme, but hey, it's a start...\nFirstly, follow the Apple temporary fix, as linked in the question.\nThen, the following works for me to support two virtual named hosts, implemented using Passenger and Rails.

I'm considering upgrading my end of 2006 MacBook Pro RAM. Yet I'm hesitating: it will not support 4GB of RAM, but only 3GB (I have 2x 1GB at the moment).\nThis means that each slot will have a different amount of memory, and I read somewhere that would prevent it from using double data rate or something like this.\nDo you know if this decrease of performance is noticeable? Is it worth the extra 1GB of RAM?\nI'd welcome advice; especially if you have done so yourself.\nThanks!\n\nA: You might know already the discussion here:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/8053632#8053632\nIf you are actually limited by RAM, then I would not assume that the performance impact of a mixed 1GB/2GB setup would change much. Swapping to disk is so slow, it's hardly compensated by RAM timing issues.\nHowever, first make sure that RAM is actually your issue.\n\nA: Realistically, a nearly five year old Mac is nearing its end of life, and I would ask if it makes sense to spend any money upgrading it. Sure, Macs can last forever (I used a 1989 SE/30 for 14 years as a mailing list server), but I don't think there's a good cost-benefit ratio for things like RAM upgrades with your Mac. The money would be better spent saving for a new Mac notebook.\nTo the exact point you raise, the unmatched RAM may slow things down a bit, but the slowdown is a \"lower benchmark number\" type, not a \"noticeable in the real world\" type.\n", "Q: Lion: background of the login screen I just updated to Lion and I'm wondering why the background of the locked screen (login screen) seem to be different everytime I look at it: it is either the grey texture, the default desktop background or a plain black background.\nWhy isn't it the same background all the time ?\n\nA: If you are logging in fresh, it is grey linen.\nIf you are waking from sleep or display sleep without a screen saver enabled, it is the desktop background.\nIf you are waking from a screen saver, it is the screen saver itself.\nFinally, if you are waking from display sleep or sleep after a screen saver has been ended by display sleep or sleep, it is a black background.\nThere does not appear to be a way to change this, but keep your eye on apps like Secrets.  If anyone's going to figure it out, it's them.\n", "Q: How do I encypt Time Machine with Mac OS X Lion? I am thinking about upgrading to Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, because it offers full disk encryption.\nHowever, if I use Time Machine with on an external hard drive, will the Time Machine backups be encrypted as well? If not it seems to defeat the purpose of whole system encryption. :p\nAlso, if the Time Machine backups can be encrypted, how does it handle restoring from a Time Machine backup onto a new system?\n\nA: Time Machine does have a checkbox to encrypt the backup, but it will read, encrypt, and write every block of the disk - which can take a long time. If you are using a new drive it is much faster to encrypt it with Disk Utility first.\nThe encryption is handled by the OS – not Time Machine. Lion will prompt for the password whenever the disk is attached. Once the password has been entered it looks like any other disk to Time Machine.\nn.b. you will not be able to use an encrypted disk with older versions of OS X.\n\nA: It took me a little while to find the \"Encrypt backup disk\" checkbox, so I thought an answer explaining that may save you some time.\nPress the \"Select Disk…\" button in the Time Machine System Preferences panel, and the  \"Encrypt backup disk\" checkbox is enabled when you select a disk.\n\nI decided not to encrypt my Drobo after reading Alrescha's important note about not being able to use an encrypted disk with older versions of OS X than Lion.\nBut I was curious to see if Apple would warn me:\n\n(See also \"If I encrypt a Time Machine backup disk, is the entire disk encrypted or just the Backups.backupdb directory?\".)\n\nA: Time Machine backups can be encrypted as well. When setting up Time Machine, it'll ask if you want to use encryption and to enter a password.\nI've not tried to restore to a new system, but I would think it would just ask for the password and work fine after you enter it.\n", "Q: Apple Wireless Might Mouse keeps disconnecting? I have an Apple Wireless Mighty Mouse (not the newer Magic Mouse) that I've used for a couple of years.\nIn recent months, though, the mouse would spontaneously disconnection itself at random, even when the batteries are still full.\nDoes anyone have experience with this or know how to fix it?\nI am running Mac OS X 10.6.8 if that makes a difference.\nThanks!\n\nA: Try completely disconnecting the mouse from your computer, then re-pairing the mouse with the computer. I don't know if that'll help, but it's worth a try.\n", "Q: Exporting a Logic Pro 9 Project to FCPX/Premiere Pro with all files kept the same Is it possible to transfer all the audio files from logic pro to a video editing program so that they are all in the correct place and each file is separate?\nI want it so it looks like it does in logic but I can place video upon it.\n \n \n \nSorry if this is in the incorrect section of stack exchange but I do not know where to to place it.\n\nA: There are two major formats for exporting audio files en masse: OMF and AAF. Logic can do both, but it would appear - http://forums.creativecow.net/thread/8/1127487 - that FCP doesn't natively support either one. For a one-time project, the free trial of Boris Transfer FCP should be able to handle AAF. For long-term though, unless you have Boris or Automatic Duck already, you'd probably be better off exporting All Tracks as Audio Files, and bringing in them one-by-one. This video walks you through the process of AAF, OMF, or Audio File export.\n", "Q: Disable OS X feature to reopen windows at login time In Mac OS X Lion, when I do Apple > Shut Down, there is a checkbox that says \"Reopen windows when logging back in\". \nEven though I constantly UNCHECK the box, it seems OS X doesn't care - and still opens some Finder windows and sometimes Chrome...\nHow can I turn this feature off?\n\nA: For the record, we’re talking about this:\n\nThe problem is that OS X doesn’t remember if you uncheck the checkbox on the last shutdown — it will always keep the checkbox checked by default on subsequent shutdowns.\nI found two different solutions for this problem, that seem to do the trick, although they aren’t ideal.\nOpen Terminal.app and enter the following commands:\ndefaults write com.apple.loginwindow TALLogoutSavesState -bool false\ndefaults write com.apple.loginwindow LoginwindowLaunchesRelaunchApps -bool false\n\nThis effectively disables the “reopen windows when logging back in” option, although the checkbox will still appear to be checked. You can just ignore it.\nI’m afraid there’s no better solution, at least not at the moment.\n\nUpdate: OS X 10.7.4 fixed this — it now remembers your selection:\n\n\nA: This bug has been fixed with the Lion update 10.7.4:\n\nThe OS X Lion v10.7.4 Update includes fixes that:\nResolve an issue in which the \"Reopen windows when logging back in\"\nsetting is always enabled.\n\n\n(click here for more information)\n\nA: Do you ever want applications to restore to their closed state, or just at startup? If you want something resembling pre-Lion behavior (i.e. not picking up where you left off), try this.\nBack up your system before trying this, in case it messes anything up, but I'd recommend this procedure:\nIn the Finder, press Command-shift-G for \"Go to the folder:\" then type \"~/Library/Saved Application State/\" (without the quotes). Delete all the folders in Saved Application State, then press Command-I to Get File Info. In the Get File Info window, check the \"locked\" box. This should keep applications from restoring their state.\n\nA: Be sure that Google Chrome isn't included in System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items.  \nAlso, Finder windows restore by default regardless, as they did in Snow Leopard.\n", "Q: Restore MacBook AIr (mid 2011) partitions I just messed up my partions on my harddisk. \nThe situation:\nInstalled windows 7 using bootcamp (NTFS).\nAfter that i wanted to ceate a shared partition, on wich both MAC OS and Windows can write.\nIn windows 7 Disk Management i took 5 GB off the Bootcamp partion, and created a FAT32 partion from it.\nNow when i boot only the windows partition is visible when i reboot (no macosx or restore) When i try to start windows it gives a short BSOD (acnt read t) and then reboots again.\nI guess i should create some sort of bootable restore USB stick.\nAny ideas how to get me going again ....please....\n\nA: Hold down Command+R while booting it, and it should run Lion Recovery, either from your recovery partition if it still exists or directly over the Internet. See here for details.\n", "Q: GUI for managing automounting of fileshares? I have a bunch of MP3 files on an SMB share. They play great if I use Finder's Connect to Server to mount the disk first, iTunes thinks they have names like /Volumes/musicshare/foo.mp3. But if I reboot and launch iTunes first the files are as if they don't exist until I manually remount the volume in Finder.\nHow do I arrange for my network share to automatically mount after a reboot? Searching for answers turns up a lot of information about hand-editing autofs configuration files. I'm new to MacOS but an old Unix hand and am OK editing files in /etc. But it feels like the wrong way; does MacOS have a user friendly way of automounting network shares?\n\nA: Mount the share that you want and then open \"System Preferences - Users and groups - Login items\"\nClick the + symbol to add a new login item and then select the network share from the window that opens. The volume should open on every login. \nCheck the box next to it to hide the item. This should keep the Finder window from appearing.\n", "Q: Find information about host IP address?

Just bought a MacBook Pro 13' .\nSo i want to use all 3 Systems ( Ubuntu , MacOS , Win7 ) on my Machine.\nI Thought about using Boot Camp for Windows and a Virtual Machine ( which one ?! ) for \nUbuntu.\nCan you give me any advice on that ?\nI'm really new to MacOS, so every little advice is appreciated !\n\nA: On a new Mac (presumably one that uses an Intel i5 or better processor), I think the hassle of rebooting to use BootCamp outweighs the benefit. I would run both Ubuntu and your favorite flavor of Windows in one of the Virtual Machine products. Some prefer VirtualBox because it is free. I'm not in that camp, and I think it has poorer performance than the competing solutions. That leaves Parallels or VMWare Fusion. I've used both, and find little difference between them in real-world usage. I use VMWare Fusion, myself. I would purchase whichever one you can find at a discount. I note that you can often find Parallels included in the Mac software bundle deals that pop up several times a year.\n\nA: Lion creates a recovery partition at the beginning of your boot disk.  this then pushes your normal OS to partition 2 at least.  Bootcamp can only start Windows if it's partition number is less than 4.  Therefore you only have 2 places to put the bootcamp partition.  I don't know about installing Linux, but if this is also done via the bootcamp mechanism, then your partitions would be 1: Recovery, 2: Mac, 3: Bootcamp 1, 4: Bootcamp 2 - and the last one would not be bootable, so you may want to consider running it in VirtualBox, which is a free Vm machine from Sun which is OK for Linux installs (less good for Windows).\n", "Q: Apple Mail reply arrow not working reliably I'm running Lion, connecting to an Exchange 2010 server. Sent messages are stored locally.  \nOnce I've replied to a messages in my Inbox, the \"replied\" arrow appears to the left of the message, as normal.  But when I click on the arrow to see the actual reply it fails roughly 50% of the time. By \"fails\" I mean that nothing comes up when I click.  A message I sent minutes earlier/later can work just fine.\nThe reply WAS sent using Apple Mail (not my iPhone) and it IS in my sent mail folder.  I have re-built my Spotlight index. \n\nA: As far as I know, the issue is that Microsoft doesn't provide the Active Sync API to anything other than mobile devices. This is why using Exchange on Mac is a bit buggy.\nI would recommend using Microsoft's own Outlook Web App (OWA) for your Exchange emails. Or installing the actual Outlook program for your computer. Those are what I use. :)\nThose are probably your two best options if you need your email to be 100% reliable on your Mac.\n\nA: I've experienced the same thing, but only with my company's Exchange server. My other IMAP servers (Gmail, MobileMe a private IMAP) all work fine, 100% of the time.\nI'm pretty sure this is a server side Exchange bug.\n\nA: I've seen the same behavior with IMAP accounts in Mail under Lion. I think it's a general bug, and not limited to Exchange (I say this because I have no Exchange accounts).\n", "Q: How to join audio tracks into a single audiobook? I am looking for a solution to join entire CD to a single audio file, preferably with chapterizing functionality.\nUsually, Join Toghether should do the job but this solution doesn't work anymore with Lion and I am looking for a solution that works with Lion.\nI mention that most of my files are in AAC Lossless format and I don't want to convert them to something worse. I tried Audiobook Builder but it seams to not be able to build lossless files.\n\nA: Rogue Amoeba's Fission will do what you want. It costs US $39 but it has a limited trial demo you can download. It is a lightweight lossless audio editor. The publisher reports no compatibility problems with Lion.\n\nA: Instructions for this are documented on my blog:\nhttp://underdesign.wordpress.com/2010/12/20/quick-and-dirty-free-joining-of-mp3-files-on-a-mac/\nUses open-source or free software, and the command line.\n\nA: My personal choice for all audio editing is Sound Studio. I acquired it in its Freeverse days, but it is now distributed by its developers, Felttip. It's priced at $29.99, and is available on the Mac App Store, with a 15-use demo download available from the Felttip site.\nIt's only now, while checking links for this answer, that I see it's now reached Version 4 (I've been using 3 for some time, and do not recall receiving notification of upgrade availability). My experience with Version 3 has been unchanged since upgrading to Lion.\n", "Q: Is there any way to stop the auto-reloading tabs in Safari 5.1 In Safari 5.1 older tabs will auto-reload after being flushed. This has to be the wonkiest, most unproductive \"features\". I can't imagine this being done for memory usage reasons as I have plenty to spare. \nIs there any way to stop this?\n\nA: I believe (for clarification) that you are referring to the behaviour whereby a page currently open in a tab will be \"flushed\" from memory, such that the tab and it's title remain but when you switch back to it will have to load the page again in order to show it to you.\nThis is new to Safari 5.1, and mirrors the similar actions that happen in iOS devices with mobile safari.\nUnfortunately there is no way to stop this short of reverting to a previous version of Safari, or using a different browser.  You may have plenty of memory, but with Lion Apple seem to have gone down the road of trying to make things as efficient as possible.  To use a car analogy, just because you have loads of fuel in the tank, doesn't mean they can't change the engine mappings when you are idling at stoplights to save even more.\nThat's not to say that it achieves its aims all the times, as the page reloading may be more of an issue to you than the internal efficiency of the OS, but it's how they are doing it right now, and it's similar in other areas, such as programs that can be automatically closed if they are considered to be inactive.  Some of it is bringing across some of the \"anti bloat\" methods over from iOS, some of it is change for changes sake.\nSo, in summary, you can see why they might want to do this, but it doesn't quite work as seemlessly as it needs to for people not to care, but there's nothing you can do about it without you change your choice of browser.\n", "Q: Cannot drag links onto existing tabs in Safari 5.1 I have become very used to dragging links, from within the browser or other apps, onto existing tabs in order to have the link open in that tab. Safari 5.1 seems to eliminate this behavior and it is driving me batty.\nIs there a way to change this behavior? Maybe through defaults write on the command line, or some kind of extension?\n\nA: This behavior has returned to normal in Safari 5.1.1\n", "Q: Wifi password is too short on Mac Air in Lion I have MacBook Air with Lion which has problems to join WIFI network which password is 7 chars long. Basically button is grayed out until i add more chars. Is there a way to force Lion to ignore this behavior or the only way to go thru is to change WIFI password? It's not my network so it's not so easy. \n\nA: I assume you are being prompted for a WPA password. My SnowLeopard system (10.6.8) requires at least eight characters before enabling the OK button when I try to join a network using WPA.  The Wikipedia page for Pre-shared key (PSK) indicates that the valid password length is between 8 and 63 characters.\nI also tried joining an example wireless network configured with WEP, an older wireless security method.  After entering just one character for the password, the OK button was enabled.\nSo, assuming you were given the correct password for the wireless network, it sounds like your computer believes that the wireless network uses WPA security when it actually uses WEP.  There's no way that I see to change the security protocol for the wireless network from the password dialog; your computer automatically detects the security protocol and sets the minimum password length accordingly.\nAre you sure you are trying to join the correct network?  Does the password dialog specify WEP or WPA?  Do you know another person who is successfully joining the network, and can you have them disconnect and reconnect to the network, entering the same password?\n", "Q: Command to collect windows of one or all apps in one monitor? My setup allows my laptop and desk machine to share a large-screen monitor in addition to their own displays. Both machines are connected to the large monitor with their own HDMI cables, and that monitor has a switch for choosing which one to display. All good.\nSometimes I have the large monitor showing one machine's stuff and I need to check something on the other machine -- and as it happens the app on that machine has its windows open on the large screen, so I don't see them. Rather than switching the large monitor to the other machine, is there some command to make the second machine collect that app's (or all apps') windows into its own display?\nThe only way I've found that works is to pull the HDMI cable out of the second machine, which forces all of its open windows back into its own display. I'd prefer a way that doesn't involve connecting and disconnecting the cable. System Settings -> Displays is no help.\nMachines are late-2008 MBP and mid-2010 Mac Mini Server. Running Lion on both.\nThanks.\n\nA: You can use a third party window manager like Stay to assign windows to the display where you'd like them to reside. By using Stay to restore windows, all of them move to their designated spot. For example, you could set your windows to the display that you're currently viewing.\n\nA: I have found my own answer in Moom from the Mac App Store. Other third party window managers, such as Stay, were too rigid for my usage. No way could I define standard size & location for windows of various applications, especially because I often have many files open at once in some applications. Moom allows both keyboard and mouse cursor interactions, and is perfect for the use case I posted originally: to move a window from the large shared monitor while the other machine has control of the monitor.\n", "Q: Does my Bootcamp partition, disappeared by Lion install, still exist?

Take a look at the drive layout in Disk Utility.app (in /Applications/Utilities, accessible from Launchpad), which visualizes the entire drive in slices.  If you don't see the 20GB slice there, then it has been overwritten.\nDid you obtain Lion from the App Store?\n", "Q: Remove rogue app from menu bar I have a rogue item on my menu bar from a terrible piece of printer/scanner software. I long ago removed the app, but the button for the app remains in the menu bar. \nIs there any central way for me to remove an item from the menu bar? Any plist I can hack? command line trick, etc?\nIt's the one to the left of the Facebook icon:\n\n(I tried holding Command and dragging it away, but it doesn't seem to respect that convention.)\n\nA: This is likely a status item, not a menu extra. (Not being able to move it around or remove it by holding ⌘ and dragging is the way to find out.)\nIn Activity Monitor (in /Applications/Utilities), set the pop-up menu to \"My Processes\" and look for anything that sounds related to the scanner vendor. Also, check ~/Library/LaunchAgents for a file that mentions the vendor in its name. Lastly, check System Preferences → Accounts → (your account) → Login Items.\n\nA: These icons are called menu extras.  Using Terminal, try this command:\nmdfind menu | grep \\\\.menu$\n\nThis command shows a list of file paths for menu extras as indexed by Spotlight.  If the unwanted menu extra is listed in the output, navigate to the path using Finder or Terminal and remove it.

I have seen various issues related to it, and this could be one of them.  You could always stop sharing via preferences, and install the \"real\" Samba sharing software and see if that helps - it's not the most elegant solution, but it may prove a point while you wait for a fix.\n", "Q: Choosing native screen resolution aspect ratio when screen sharing I have two Macs both running Lion: \n\n\n*\n\n*iMac (early 2009, iMac9,1 with NVIDIA GeForce GT 120)\n\n*MacBook Air (Early 2011, first of the new shape 11.6\") \nI often screen share using the Macbook Air as the client, and presenting the screen from my iMac onto it.  When this happens the original iMac screen resolution is used and scaled down to fit into the lower resolution on the Macbook Air.\nThe iMac resolution native resolution is 1900x1200 (16:10), so when scaled down to Airs 1366x768 (16:9) it looks bad and doesn't fill the screen (even after using \"full screen\").\nWhen I am in though, I can change the resolution, and have elected to put the display preferences menu bar item in to allow me to change quickly.\nIf I screen share using the normal physical display, I get the following choice of screen resolutions:\n\nIf I select to use the virtual display instead my choice of available screen resolutions changes to the following:\n\nOddly these are \"extra\" resolutions, but none of the available choices match the 16:9 aspect ratio of the Air, or equate to any of the supported 16:10 ratio resolutions of the Air, I only get options for the 4:3 aspect ratio.\nMacbook Air Supported resolutions:\n1366x768 (native), 1344x756 and 1280x720 pixels at 16:9 aspect ratio\n1152x720 and 1024x640 pixels at 16:10 aspect ratio\n1024x768 and 800x600 pixels at 4:3 aspect ratio\nI want to avoid scaling wherever possible, and use one of the 16:9 ratios that my Air supports to get full screen non scaled viewing.  I can get native vertical with horizontal borders at 1024x768, or I can get close to full screen after scaling with slim borders by using 1680x1050, but neither of these are ideal.\nIs there any way to set my iMac to use these resolutions when I am connected via Screen Sharing?  I know the root cause is a fundamental mismatch in aspect ratios, but surely the iMac can support a 16:9 external display, so why not for a virtual display?\n\nA: After half a year and 2 bounties, no-one genuine solution, so the answer appears to be a simple \"You can't do that\".\n\nA: According to MacTracker, your iMac9,1 supports two aspect ratios, both of which differ from the (approximate) 16:9 that is native to your MacBook Air: \n\n\n*\n\n*16:10 (1920 x 1200, 1600 x 1000, 1344 x 840, 1280 x 800, 1024 x 640, 800 x 500)\n\n*4:3 (1600 x 1200, 1344 x 1008, 1280 x 960, 1024 x 768, 960 x 600, 800 x 600, 640 x 480).\nNeither Remote Desktop 3.5 (460.87) nor Screen Sharing 1.3 (460044000000000) in Mac OS X 10.7.1 supports scaling to accommodate the different ratios. \nJollysFastVNC\n \nWithout Correct Aspect Ratio and with Fullscreen, the display of a remote computer with a different ratio will be stretched to fill the display of the local computer. \nHopefully visible in the following screenshot, the horizontal stretch of a 1024 x 768 (4:3) display to fill my 1920 x 1200 (16:10) MacBookPro5,2: \n\nAlternatives\nThis is not a shopping recommendation. There may be alternatives to JollysFastVNC that support full screen and stretching. \nFull screen Screen Sharing in Lion (suggested by bmike) is very tidy, if you can accept the linen margin.  \n\nA: Have you tried SwitchResX (http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/8355/switchresx)?  It looks interesting, though I haven’t gotten it to do what I need yet.  (After Virtual Display stopped working, I attached a second secondary screen to my main machine, and am trying to set its resolution to match that of the remote screen.)\n", "Q: Lion refuses to download from App store stating \" unable to install on this machine\" I am unable to get Lion to download and uprgrade my Mac Mini as it gives an error message - \"We could not complete your purchase. This version of Mac OS X 10.7 cannot be installed on this computer.\" My Mac Mini originally had a Core Duo in it but was upgraded with a new Core 2 Duo 2Gz processor and it has 2 Gb of memory. About this Mac confirms this setup. I am using an external drive to boot from. There are two users on the Mini, and seperate drives to boot from. Neither the internal drive when booted from will allow to upgrade to Lion or my external one. I have contacted Apple Support and they had me capture and upload my complete system configuration to them using a little program they emailed to me. I sent this over a month ago now and have not had a response.\nHas anyone else had this issue and found some way to resolve?\n\nA: Apple determines Lion compatibility based upon the original shipping configuration of your machine. Since there was never an \"official\" upgrade offered from Core Duo to Core 2 Duo, according to Apple your machine is not supported.\nBut...\nThere are workarounds out there, if you are willing to get a little creative.\nThe simplest method is to install Lion onto a drive using a supported machine.  Once Lion is installed, it will boot and run just fine on your upgraded Mac Mini.\n\nA: Lion requires a 64-bit processor.  As you stated, your Mac Mini now has a Core 2 Duo (a 64-bit processor) but originally shipped with a Core Duo (32-bit processor).  Although your machine may meet the technical requirements for Lion because of the CPU upgrade, it may be a configuration untested by Apple and therefore unsupported for Lion.  The App Store is likely basing the installation requirements from your machine's model name (e.g. MacMini1,2) or the part number (e.g. MA607), rather than just the CPU.\n\nA: Do you have bootcamp installed, or any other unusual partitioning of your drives?  In certain circumstances, because Lion creates a new \"recovery\" partition at the beginning of your disk, this can them bump the remaining partitions up by an increment of 1, and if your windows bootcamp partition is higher than 3 it cannot boot.  Therefore, if Lion detects that bootcamp is already partition 3, and installing would make it 4, it won't install as it knows it will screw your bootcamp installation up.\n\nA: I suggest you go on another Mac and log into the Mac App Store with your Apple ID and download lion. once the download completes follow the 1 step instructions on this article by OS X Daily. It will remove the Preference List file that lists the core duo Macs as unsupported by lion (even though they are). Having completed that simple hack, just install Lion like normal :)\nOn a completed Lion installation the file is located under /System/Library/CoreServices/PlatformSupport.plist\n", "Q: Why does Finder need me to authenticate its every action?

(It was working a week ago & no new software or updates have been installed). Even a simple Cmnd+T generic transition doesn't work, except for one whose time code is always <00:00:00;01>. When I do the typical \"tricks\" to lengthen the duration of the transition (like right click, select duration, then type in a longer value), all I hear is a bump sound signifying an error of some kind.

In other words, uncut clips = no transitions, so lengthening it as you had tried won't help. \nAlso, do you have handles enabled? See the referenced article below:\nFCE Transitions/Troubleshooting\n\nA: I have this problem and have never figured out exactly why it does this, but I have found that trimming off about 00:00:10 from the beginning of the clip to the right, then re-applying the transition works. If only trimming 10 frames off doesn't work, try a little more. I know, it's frustrating... :-)\n", "Q: Why does my MobileMe email account have a Junk mailbox? My MobileMe email account has a mailbox named Junk (first letter capitalized), and I don't know why.  I created a mailbox called junk (all lowercase) into which I manually move junk messages.  I see both mailboxes everywhere I view the account (Mac, iOS, me.com web interface).\nI use one Mac with the MobileMe email account, and junk mail filtering is disabled.  I also use the MobileMe email account on an iPhone (iOS 4.3.5), an iPad (iOS 4.3.5), and occasionally the me.com web interface.  Within iOS settings, I don't see any setting specific to junk mail filtering.  I have no mail rules that move messages to a Junk folder on my Mac or on the me.com web interface.\nSomething is automatically moving messages to the Junk folder, and is getting some false positives with its junk detection, so I want to stop that.\nHow do I find out what's responsible for this mysterious Junk mailbox, and prevent it from automatically moving messages identified as junk?  I am trying to get rid of the Junk mailbox and only manage junk messages manually.  I have deleted the Junk mailbox in the past, and it came back, although I don't remember the specific circumstances related to its reappearance.\nI've already viewed this knowledgebase article (which offers the opposite of what I want): http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mail/4.0/en/15591.html\n\nA: Log into the MobileMe website and disable Junk mail filtering in the Mail preferences.\nEdit:\nWell, at least there used to be an option to disable Junk mail filtering. It seems that Apple permanently enabled junk mail filtering without the option to disable it about a year ago.\nSee here: http://www.appleinfocus.com/2010/07/cant-turn-off-mobileme-junk-mail-filtering/\nSorry to be the bearer of bad news.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to turn off display not possible with MacBook Air Shift + Control + Eject will turn off a Mac's display.\nI just bought a new MacBook Air. It has a power button instead of an Eject key:\n\nBesides a hot corner or turning down the screen brightness, is there a keystroke that will sleep the display?\n\nA: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18414/ase/DimScreen.tar.bz2 is my attempt at a solution to this.\nIt is an Automator Application which does two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*It runs a script to dim the screen to 0 (see note below)\n\n*It launches your screensaver.\nWhy does it launch your screensaver? Well, because I assume that if you are dimming your screen that means you are going to be gone from it for awhile.\nIf the brightness is set to 0 and you come back to your Mac and press some keys, move the mouse, etc nothing will happen. Well, nothing you can see.\nHowever if the screensaver is running, the Mac is smart enough to bump up the brightness just a litte to show you that you need to enter your screensaver password.\n(You DO require a password to unlock your screensaver, right?)\nWell, even if you don't, you can still use the app. After the screensaver exits, the script will bump the brightness back up just a little.\n(If you find that the screensaver is being turned off by accident and you don't want that, you can just edit the last few lines of the script, and copy/paste it into a new app.)\nNOTE / WARNING / DISCLAIMER / ACHTUNG\ndimscreen.zsh is the script which is run by the application (it is part of the .tar.bz2 file). HOWEVER this script depends on the 'brightness' command being present at $HOME/bin/brightness, which it probably is not.\nIf the app does not find it there, it will attempt to download it from http://luo.ma/attic/brightness.bz2 and install it to ~/bin/brightness.\nIf the idea of downloading a file from the Internet skeevs you out, you can find the source code at http://mattdanger.net/2008/12/adjust-mac-os-x-display-brightness-from-the-terminal/ and compile your own (that page has instructions, it is dead simple).\nI have included the source code as well as the precompiled binary in the .tar.bz2 file as well.\n(As for the \"Keyboard Shortcut\" part of your question, I leave it to you to decide which of the many app launchers you will use, including something like Apptivate which can tie it to a single keystroke if you like.)\n\nA: Though the question explicitly says \"besides a hot corner\", I'll mention it since it's the only way I've found so far to get display sleep at all on the new Air.\nOpen Preferences, go to \"Desktop & Screen Saver\", choose the \"Screen Saver\" tab, click \"Hot Corners…\". Open the dropdown for the corner you'd prefer and pick \"Put Display to Sleep\".\nIf you move the mouse cursor to that corner, the display will go to sleep.\nIf you hold Cmd (or some other modifier, or combination of modifiers) and then open the dropdown, display sleep will only trigger if you move the mouse and hold that modifier, which could reduce mistakes.\n\nA: This isn't a keystroke, but it's a step in the right direction: If there were a way to get past the fact that the script needs to be run with sudo, you could use Automator to bind it to a keyboard shortcut:\n#!/bin/bash\noriginal_setting=`/usr/bin/pmset -g | /usr/bin/grep displaysleep | /usr/bin/awk '{print $2}'`\necho $original_setting\nmagic_number=2147483648\n/usr/bin/pmset -a displaysleep $magic_number; sleep 1; /usr/bin/pmset -a displaysleep $original_setting\n\n\nA: The free app Sleep Display works fine on my Air, running OS X Lion. It's just a SleepDisplay.app that does what it says.\nI just launch it by name via Alfred, but you could probably bind it to keyboard shortcuts with any of a number of tools, like FastScripts.\n\nA: Just Shift + Control + Power works on my retina MBP, which also doesn't have an eject button.\n\nA: The eject key is now on the F12 key.  Give Shift+Control+F12 a try.\n\nA: There is a keyboard shortcut already mapped in the OS for doing this, you don't need to map anything or write any scripts.\nSleep all displays: Control+Shift+Fn+Power Button\nWorks on Mountain Lion and Mavericks (possibly others as well).

I want to ping all possible IPs in my LAN, and I have the code for it, but right now, I've already cut the weight time from 5s to 2s, and it's still about 8 minutes to test them all. How long should it take to ping an IP on my same LAN?\nThanks\n\nA: It should take less than a millisecond to ping a host on the same physical network.  In reality, networks get busy and hosts get slow - it might take 5 milliseconds.\nLike UDP, there is no guarantee that you'll receive a reply at all.\n\nA: You can also try broadcast pings, but those are usually not routed. E.g. if you're on 192.168.0.0/24 network, you can try ping 192.168.0.255 and all hosts on same network will respond.\n\nA: I would suggest using Nmap instead.

If your sound had been turned on, you'd also hear your computer speaking the words that appear on screen. VoiceOver is OS X's built-in screen reading software for the vision-impaired. It can speak and display lots of information about the elements on screen, including the currently-active text field.\nYou can disable/enable it with ⌘+F5 (or ⌘+fn+F5 on newer keyboards).

For example: if I add a URL to the Reading List on my iMac, can it then be synced to the Reading List on my MacBook? It does not appear so even though I believe Reading List is going to sync with iOS 5 devices? (if it is not officially supported, is there a hack to do so)?\n\nA: Syncing between all macs, pcs and iOS devices will be possible when iCloud is released to the public along with iOS 5.\n", "Q: Is fast user switching in Lion disabling the network connection for the accounts that aren't active? With 10.6, I routinely had two accounts logged into the Mac while I was working - my personal and my work account. I switched between them as needed and this worked fine. For example, if I had an IM client running under the work user and switched to my personal user and then back again to the work user, everything was ok. The work user's IM client stayed connected the whole time.\nWith 10.7, it looks like switching to another account renders the network connection inactive for the account that is no longer in use. When I switch back to the work account now, the IM client has to reconnect and the VPN attempts to reconnect.\nIs this new behavior documented somewhere and is it configurable?\n\nA: Not really - Lion is now able to kill processes that appear to be idle and unused. Fast user switching adds more load on memory and processor (due to the simple fact that more is now running), increasing the chance this will trigger.\nAlso, the changes to allow multiple simultaneous logins may have changed the API which will need the VPN client to request to stay connected or otherwise start itself outside the user space to survive a switch in Lion.\n", "Q: Full virtual desktop on iPad with sound Is there an iPad app that allows me to use a desktop game with an important audio component?

My iPhone is on iOS 4.2.1 and I want to upgrade it to iOS 4.3.3. I know there are newer iOS versions available but they can't be jailbroken untethered. \nI have the 4.3.3 package from Apple, and I know I can shift-click the \"Upgrade\" button in iTunes to select this file. When I do, iTunes first extracts the file (no problem) and then tries to verify it, and here's where the trouble starts. iTunes gives me an error 3194 which according to a Google search means that iTunes didn't get a useful response from the validation server. \nI've checked for these possible causes:\n\n\n*\n\n*The hosts file might have a custom entry which prevents iTunes from getting a response.  I've checked: There are no entries in the hosts file, only #comment lines.\n\n*A tool like tinyumbrella might have changed the lookup. I installed tinyumbrella and checked: it's set to use normal iTunes settings, no overrides are active.\n\n\nHow can I get rid of this error and upgrade to iOS version 4.3.3? I'm on Windows.\n\nA: That specific error is clearly spelled out on the general iOS error charts - http://support.apple.com/kb/TS3694\nSaying that it didn't get a useful response is a bit vague.\niTunes requires a specific, signed, affirmative response from the apple servers before it will proceed. This is clearly by design. Additionally it checks the version of your iTunes and is asking you to get a newer version.\nYou may not want to upgrade iTunes as some people dislike some of the changes, but it looks like that's the cause here assuming you really removed all the umbrella changes properly. It also might ask for a newer iTunes but the problem isn't actually that.\nThere is a whole set of things to check at the top of the main article: security software, iTunes store tests, using old or modified .ipsw files.\nIt might be good to set up a new user on the windows os and see if you can download 4.3.3 cleanly (or find a pristine copy on the intertubes) and try the restore and debugging of the hosts file from a cleaner start.\n", "Q: Lion: Change Keyboard shortcut CMD + ALT + Left/Right Arrow for spaces OR Firefox's next/previous tab I'm using Firefox, where CMD + ALT + ← / → Arrow changes to the next / previous tab. This is an important feature to me. \nSince Lion, this shortcut changes the active space to the next and previous space, with no way to customize this. And I want to use spaces, just no with the keybinding. Firefox also won't let me customize my shortcut. How can I change one of those?\n(Hint: the Firefox extension \"keyconfig\" let's you do a lot of keybindings-changes, but not the previous and next tab ones).\n\nA: You can change Mission Control's keyboard shorcut from System Preferences/Keyboard/Keyboard Shourtcuts window or bind specific shortcut key for Firefox in same window.\n\nA: Ctrl-Tab and Shift-Control-Tab will have the same effect as CMD-ALT-← / →, and have the advantage of working in Safari, Firefox, and Chrome.\nIt's also nice to rebind them to function or gamepad keys so you can browse without contorting your hand à la emacs.\n", "Q: Can I dual boot Snow Leopard and Lion?

For example, if I played a game and downloaded some game contents in the app and then saved some game progress, there should be some files generated within the app. After syncing with iTunes, where will those information be stored?\nI could find the appname.ipa file in iTunes Music folder, but that's the same app file downloaded from iTunes. For the app files generated after I used it, where will they be stored?\n\nA: I don't think the actually files are copied, but the backup directory for iDevices is ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup\n\nA: There is a Mac app called Mobile Sync Browser that will attempt to parse the backup files and show what is in them.  Look under \"AppDomain\" for any material from apps.  \n", "Q: Best Torrent Client that supports auto unrar I used to be a PC boy and now been in to Macs for a few years. I am after a good torrent client that supports auto unrar and move on completion.\nAnybody know of anything like this? Google doesn't seem to turn up much.\nThanks\nLee\n\nA: Transmission is generally regarded as the best BT on the Mac, and can definitely do move on completion. That's found in the Transfers - Adding tab in Preferences.\nIt doesn't have auto unrar built in, but it can run a script on torrent completion.\nThere are several available scripts on the Transmission forums.

Can I connect my iPhone 4 to WIFI in hotel and share it for my laptop thru WIFI as well? That way I could save some money to not have to buy 2 x WIFI from HOTEL.\n\nA: No. The iPhone can either act as a client or an Access Point, not both simultaneously.\nIf the WiFi access isn't registered against the device's MAC address then you should be able to use the login on either the iPhone or Laptop (but probably not at the same time).\nIf it is MAC address based registration then you could register with your iPhone and then change your Laptop's MAC address to match the iPhone's MAC address so that you only have to buy one WiFi access card.\n\nA: Since version 5.50.2 (4/4/2012), MyWi can share your wifi connection.\n\nA: You're probably much easier off the other way round: make sure your laptop has wifi, and enable internet sharing on your laptop, so that your iphone connects through your laptop to the internet.\nI think this will require you to have an extra wifi card plugged into (or connected to) your laptop though (the build-in wifi would connect to the internet, the second wifi adapter would share its connection to other devices, like your iphone)\n\nA: Yes it can.

I'm trying out Homebrew, but I can't seem to figure out when uninstalling a 'formula', how to recursively remove the dependencies as well. I.e. Macports is:\n$ port uninstall --follow-dependencies <portname>\n\nHow does this work with Homebrew?\n\nA: A simple way to solve the problem of accumulating dependencies of deinstalled things is to periodically run brew leaves and compare it against a list of wanted leaves, and recursively remove everything else.\nThe following works, but of course is not very readable:\n1) Show all the leaves minus the ones in your wanted list:\n$ brew leaves | egrep -v 'bcwipe|brew-cask|lftp|mmv|mobile-shell|mplayer|node|octave|python|zsh'\n\n2) Once you have adjusted the list (i.e. added new keepers), get rid of the rest:\n$ brew uninstall `brew leaves|egrep -v 'bcwipe|brew-cask|git|lftp|mmv|mobile-shell|mplayer|node|octave|python|zsh'`\n\nThis usually has to be called a few times in a row to get them all, and the final call should be followed by a\n$ brew cleanup\n\nTo beautify a bit, the list of keepers can of course be kept in a file somewhere.\n\nA: Like @Adam Vandenberg said, there's no easy way to do it.\nHowever, I filed an issue on Homebrew's GitHub page, and it appears there's a workaround to solve this, until they add an exclusive command.\nSee my answer on StackOverflow for more info.\n\nA: In 2021, you can now use brew autoremove:\nhttps://docs.brew.sh/Manpage#autoremove---dry-run\n\nA: Unfortunately, Homebrew does not track dependencies in this way.\n\nA: I just wrote a small wrapper script to add this functionality to brew. Source it in your .bashrc and it will track which packages you install, then recursively remove unneeded dependencies when you uninstall.\nhttps://github.com/DaemonF/brew-recursive-uninstall\n", "Q: Preview.app does not update a pdf when it changes In all pre Lion versions of Mac OS X Preview.app could show an updated PDF when the PDF it was showing changed.\nExample: I'm writing a latex document and recompile it. Without closing Preview it just reloaded the PDF.\nIn Lion it does not show this behaviour any more. It just seems to get stuck when the open PDF changes.\nDo you know how to get the pre Lion behaviour? Or am I just missing something here? Is there a PDF viewer which can update the PDF when it changes?\n\nThe Problem actually was the way I build the PDF file. I have a Makefile to build my latex files which looks like this:\npdflatex -output-directory out main.tex\nmv out/main.pdf .\n\nSo the file does not get updated. It get's replaced. On pre Lion Osx this worked fine. In Lion it does not. Now I just open out/main.pdf and update it with pdflatex and it works.\nIt also works with Preview.app\n\nA: Try Skim.  It has a preference option to check for file changes.\n\nA: The issue occurs when you have an error in your latex file.  At that point pdflatex will delete the pdf, and preview will stop following it.  After you correct the error, pdflatex will create a new file, but this will not be tracked by preview, which is still looking at the now non-existant file.  This is why skim will work for a while as well.  I understand why preview tries to follow the file, sort of, but I think this behavior is very annoying.\n\nA: The Skim app does not seem to automatically refresh the rendered PDF when I replace the PDF file with a new version, even with the \"Check for file changes\" preference option checked.\nWhat does work with Skim is to select File -> Revert, then confirm the selection by clicking on \"Revert\" in the dialog box that pops up. This is way too manual for my taste.\nIncidentally, the \"Revert\" menu option is grayed out when the PDF file has not been updated, but as soon as I update/replace the PDF file with a new version, the \"Revert\" menu option becomes available to be selected. So this indicates that Skim notices that the PDF file on disk is different than the version that was rendered, but it doesn't automatically refresh the display.\n\nA: You could also open the PDF with Safari and refresh the page manually to view the new version. markdown2pdf replaces the PDF instead of updating it, so Lion's Preview won't work for me.\n", "Q: Symlinked services in ~/Library/Services not working in Lion Does anyone know how to make symlinked services work in Lion?

Once I 'installed' the services they work but even after they installed replacing them with the symlink doesn't work.\nAnyone have any ideas to get this working? Or know why it no longer works?\nI am using soft links if that makes a difference.\n\nA: I would hard link a file to make sure it's disabled by design.\nYou could then decide to go that path or come up with automation to deploy changes to production - something simple like make or rsync or complicated like Puppet.\n", "Q: Install windows 7 on 15 inch macbook pro with a 13 inch MBP install disk I have a 15 inch MBP which I want to install windows 7 on and I read online that I should have the MBP installation disk with me to install drivers and things after I install windows. I don't have it anymore. \nMy friend loaned me his 13 inch MBP install disk but it says clearly on the disk that it is for MBP 13 inches. I'm not sure if it will work, has anyone tried this before? Is it ok if I go ahead with the install?\n\nA: When you run the Boot Camp Assistant app it should offer to download the newest drivers for your MacBook Pro. You can just save them to a USB key and run the installer after you finish installing Windows.\n\nA: Yes it should work - Windows will install fine even without the disk, and the boot camp drivers are the same basic set. \n", "Q: An anomaly (bug?) in iCal in Lion? Has anybody else noticed a problem with date display in iCal in Lion? It appears when \"Show event times\" is activated in the General tab of Calendar preferences.\nI spotted a date-display inconsistency with a weekly recurring event I have set up. Despite having system-wide dates formatted as 12-hour with am/pm included (Language & Text System Preference), this event fails to respect that preference. It is scheduled to commence at 1:00 pm and finish three hours later, at 4:00 pm. Rather than being listed in Calendar in this way, it appears:\n\n\n*\n\n*in the summary list in Daily view as \"13 to 16\", and\n\n*with a starting time of \"13\" in Daily, Weekly and Monthly view.\n\n\nAnxious to get to the bottom of this, I have played around with various date ranges in a number of test calendar entries. The conclusion I've arrived at is that the problem is confined to on-the-hour times, as illustrated here. Once the time does not end in 00, things display correctly; otherwise, the date displays in stripped-down, 24-hour fashion.\nSo: has anyone else seen this, or am I alone with this problem? I'm inclined to submit bug feedback to Apple, but would first prefer to have corroborating evidence.\n\nA: No - I'm not getting it and can't seem to break things even trying to.\nAn official bug might be warranted as you seem to have been careful to be sure it's happening.

It syncs with the corporate Exchange server.\nBut when I am saving contacts (from the recent calls list for example), there is no way to set where the contact is saved. (I have a couple of Contacts folders in the Exchange account).\nIs there a way to tell the iPhone where to save new contacts either when I save the new contact or just to set the default contact group?\n\nA: In iOS 5.1, you can define a \"Default Account\" for Contacts in Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars. Scroll down until you see a Contacts heading; Default Account is at the bottom of that section. This setting will affect where new Contacts created on the iPhone are placed.\n", "Q: simplest way to open all images in a directory in Finder When I have (and browse with Finder) a directory with a bunch of photos and videos (from e.g. my camera), I often want to open all the pictures in it.\nHow can I do that?\nRight now, I select all (Apple+A), open (Apple+O) and then quit QuickTime/MPlayer/VLC. But that is a bit annoying.\n\nA: If Preview is in the dock, you can drag and drop the folder onto the Preview icon to open only the pictures.  I just tried this with a folder of images, wmv, mp4, and mov files and only the images opened in Preview.\n\nA: You can open all the files with Quicklook by typing:\n⌘+A then space\n\nA: One approach is to sort by Kind and use the Shift key to select just the range that includes the images you want to open.\nAnother possibility is to use the spotlight search box in the corner of the Finder window to whittle down to the stuff you want by typing the file extension of interest.\nOr if you are really motivated, you might whip up an Automator script and assign a dedicated keyboard shortcut.\n\nA: I use the sort by kind option and shift select all the jpeg.\n\n\n*\n\n*⌘+2 - enters list view\n\n*scoll to the beginning (or end) of the pictures\n\n*click once on the first picture\n\n*scroll to the end (or beginning) of the pictures\n\n*shift click the other end of the range\n\n*⌘+O - open them\n\n\nIf I find I have more than one extension or find myself doing this more than once, making a smart folder to select the files is the winningest move.\n\nA: Rather than trying to do this in the Finder, I think you should consider a trial of a third-party image-processing program that provides a \"Browser\" for viewing large thumbnails of lots of images in a folder. I would suggest investigating the features offered by Adobe Photoshop Elements, GraphicConverter, and Google Picasa.\n\nA: If you want to set up what happens when you open a particular type of file just right click (ctrl click) & then click on get info. Under the open with section you can pick with app you want to open automatically. You will also get the option to use your settings for all files of that particular type\n", "Q: Mounting a \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted)\" drive formatted in Lion on either Mac OS X Leopard or CentOS 6 I formatted a Seagate FreeAgent external hard drive on a system running OS X Lion (10.7) as \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted)\".  Everything works great on the Lion system.\nHowever, when I try to mount the drive on a system running Mac OS X Leopard (10.5), it can't mount the drive; it complains that the drive cannot be read (I do not have the exact error message in front of me ATM).\nI've also tried to mount the drive in my CentOS VM using the hfsplus module, but it can't find the HFS+ superblock.  I've mke2fs -n'd it to see if it can find an alternate superblock location, but none of the ones it found seem to work.\nIs there a way to mount a drive formatted by an OS X Lion system as \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted)\" on a system running either Mac OS X Leopard or CentOS 6?\n\nA: Unfortunately, Apple introduced a new technology called Core Storage to handle the new full disk encryption.  You can read about it in John Siracusa's review of OS X Lion.  This new type of volume cannot be read yet by other OS versions, but I'm sure some third party will eventually create some software that will enable reading these volumes on other operating systems. \n", "Q: Where to put the .vimrc file for sudo in OS X Lion? I always put a .vimrc in my home folder for turning :syntax on. But in OS X Lion it seems that sudo vi foo.txt ignore or can't find this vim configuration anymore.\nHas anyone experiences the same thing?\n\nA: Try doing sudo visudo and making sure that this lines appears somewhere in there:\nDefaults  env_keep += \"HOME\"\n\nThis should maintain the HOME directory and ~ should would as it did in Snow Leopard.\n\nA: I usually have use the same .vimrc and .vim folders as my main users and link them to a safe backupped place on Dropbox - wich btw is awesome for this kind of task.\nThe location of the home folder for your su is /var/root. Therefore .vimrc and the .vim folder belong there.\n\nA: Try using vim instead of vi.  Sometimes the default for \"vi\" is compatibility mode.  Not sure if this is the case with Lion, however.\n", "Q: How bad is it for a Mac to forcefully restart it when it freezes? I have a 2011 27\" iMac running OS X Lion. There is a known bug when iMac, after waking up from sleep mode, freezes while playing video (Flash in my case). It does not respond to any key combination and mouse clicks. I can still move mouse pointer and hear iTunes playing. It does not happen if iMac has been rebooted and was not put into sleep mode after that. So when it freezes, I have to turn it off and on again with the power button. The question is, does it affect hard drive, power supply or anything else that I need to worry about?\n\nA: Holding the power button and letting the System Management Controller SMC perform an immediate halt is no worse than letting the software initiate the halt.\nI suppose you could come up with a scenario with the mac in free fall or something relating to the head not being parked, but modern hardware is designed to handle power losses from the wall outlet with great grace and here the SMC is still controlling a soft landing.\nThe power implications are the same even though the applications and operating system don't get their normal opportunity to save work, close files and get ready for the next time they start.\nYour files and data could be at risk from this (think erase and install OS and restore backup files as worst software case), but the hardware doesn't care of the open files or some pending changes are not flushed from caches before the lights go out.\n\nA: Observation\nSomewhere between these two extremes: \n\n\n*\n\n*the pointer alone moving (the primary symptom)\n\n*a forced shut down or forced restart (last resorts, with some risk)\n\n\n– there may be actions that are less likely to put at risk the data; less likely to put at risk the consistency of the HFS Plus file system. \nEssentially\nThere's on-screen movement, so: \n\n\n*\n\n*probably no need to kill (or force quit) the WindowServer process\n\n*hopefully no need to force a shut down or restart of the computer. \n\n\nFirst and second steps, and beyond\nFor three seconds, press and hold four keys: \n\n\n*\n\n*Command-Shift-Option-Esc\nIf the screen was not locked, then that action will Force Quit the front-most application. (The Force Quit Applications window is not required.)\nIf – after releasing the keys – the first force quit has no visible effect, then proceed with a second round: \n\n\n*\n\n*the four keys, three seconds\n\n\n… and so on. \nWith luck a forced quit will effectively clear, from screen, the app that appeared to prevent use of the Mac. \nReference\nOS X keyboard shortcuts (2012-11-02) – this document may change after OS X 10.9 is released. \n\nTest environment\nMountain Lion here, I don't have Lion handy to test with a normally locked screen. \nObscure side note\nAvoid the four-key combination if your Mac is a client of a kernel core dump server.  It might cause a USB Programmer Key debug call, a time-consuming system dump routine. \n\nA: Power cycling puts extra strain on spinning metal hard drives, and you could probably argue that the onrush current puts extra strain on the power supply. While technically true, it's not the hardware that I would be concerned about.\nThe software is what would concern me; if you don't shut down cleanly, files may only be partially written or be open and in some inconsistent state, which amounts to data loss and could lead to further flakiness down the line depending on what gets corrupted. Having file system journaling helps with these issues somewhat, so I suggest double-checking that in Disk Utility: select your hard drive on the left, look at the \"Format:\" string on the bottom, it should say \"Mac OS Extended (journaled)\".\nHave you considered sidestepping the problem by uninstalling Flash, browsing with Safari as a rule, and only starting Chrome (with built-in Flash) long enough to deal with Flash-only content? Not the most convenient, but it might work for you.\nAlso, I wonder if the kernel actually halts, or if it's just the GUI that freezes up? You might be able to use another computer or iDevice to log in through SSH and do a clean reboot depending on how \"deeply\" frozen the Mac is.\n", "Q: Switch between full-screen windows of the same application in Lion Is there a keyboard shortcut in Lion for navigating through my open full screen Xcode projects? ⌘~ is not working.\n\nA: I can switch between windows of the same program by dragging four fingers left or right across the trackpad.  This is analogous to pressing [Command] + [~] when the windows are not in fullscreen.\nYou can find this setting under System Preferences>Trackpad>More Gestures.\n\nA: You can switch between spaces using ctrl + left right arrow keys, but this can be used with all spaces not just Xcode\n\nA: This is not the perfect solution as its a paid one, but this software called Which fills this gap. As this is truly a bothersome problem (I often use five or six RDP connections at one time in full screen) I thought I would mention it.\ndisclaimer : I am not affiliated to this program.\n\nA: You an also use Ctrl+Number to switch to a numbered desktop.  However, full-screen apps are not given a number and so can't directly be used with this technique.

What is the default font that Mac OS X Lion use in it's apps, more importantly the Finder window?\n\nA: In response to mockman: Quick Look applies the same styling that you'd see by opening the html file in Safari.  Like any browser, Safari has a set of default CSS rules which define how un-styled content is rendered.  The typeface you're seeing then, is likely derived from Safari/webkit—and not OS X.\n\n(I'm still new here, so I'm not sure if it's appropriate to respond to questions raised outside of the original question—which has now been answered.

A secondary monitor is connected to the iMac with a Mini DisplayPort-to-HDMI cable (a single cable, not an adaptor and cable).\nWhen I was running Snow Leopard, the monitor worked just fine. After upgrading to Lion, the second monitor just has a black screen, and quickly goes into power save mode.\nI have already tried resetting the NVRAM (as described here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1379) and resetting the SMC (as described here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964).\nHas anyone seen this problem? Any other suggestions for solutions?\n\nA: As it turns out, it was the Mini DisplayPort-to-HDMI cable. I connected the secondary monitor with a Mini DisplayPort-to-HDMI Adapter and everything works fine.\nTo the best of my knowledge, the cable is fine, although, apparently, it is an unlicensed HDMI cable, and manufacturers can no longer sell them.

After installing Lion, three finger gestures no longer work in the Twitter for Mac app.  (I've gotten used to swiping left with three fingers to go \"back\" after—for example—clicking on a person's avatar to see their timeline.)  In the Trackpad System Preferences panel I've disabled three finger drag, and changed \"Swipe between full-screen apps\", \"Mission Control\" and \"App Exposé\" to four fingers to try to eliminate conflicts.  But the three finger swipe still doesn't work in Twitter.\nHas anyone been able to re-enable three finger gestures in Twitter for Mac?  How did you do it?\n\nA: This annoyed me too, and it doesn't seem the solution is entirely satisfying — we'll just have to hope that Twitter for Mac gets updated soon to be better compatible with Lion.\nIf you have \"Swipe between pages\" set to \"Swipe left or right with three fingers\" or \"Swipe with two or three fingers\", then left/right three-finger swipe gestures will work in Twitter.\nIf you have Mission Control & App Exposé set to \"Swipe up/down with three fingers\", then you can hold ⌥ Option to use up/down three-finger swipe gestures with Twitter. (I'm not sure why, but if you have these set to 4-finger swipes, it doesn't seem 3-finger swipes work at all in Twitter.)\n\n\nA: Holding the option key and swiping up/down with 4 fingers does the same thing as swiping up/down with 3 fingers did in Snow Leopard.

What I want to do is update to Lion, but, as many have suggested it may be a better idea to do a clean install.

What worries me more is step 5... Do you think this is  a good approach or do you have a better alternative?\nThanks!\n\nA: I wouldn't complicate things with a DVD. Just set up your new drive using an external USB adaptor (or a full drive enclosure / drive toaster) and install Lion cleanly there. You can boot to it, migrate over apps or users. It won't get the Recovery HD until you swap the drives, but you can re-run (or re-download) the Lion installer a second time to have it drop the Recovery HD on the now internal Lion drive.\n\nA: Here is an excellent article at ArsTechnica on how to create your own Lion installer USB, and how to use it.

Clicking on it only reveals the error message\n\n\"Network\" can't be opened because the original item can't be found.\n\nThere is also no option to disable its appearance in Finder Preferences.\nThe Network icon seems to disappear on occasion, only to reappear later.\nI can find no documentation of this mysterious icon, and no reference to its existence anywhere.\nCan anyone suggest what this icon is and why it is being displayed?\n\nAddendum: Note that there are indeed other network computers visible on my LAN in the finder, whereas the little gray Network icon in the Sidebar does not display any of them.\n\nNote that there is no item named \"Network\" for me to remove in my Finder preferences:\n\n\nA: ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist\nIn Terminal, run the following command. You should find the word Network mentioned at least once in your .plist preference file: \ndefaults read com.apple.sidebarlists | grep Network\nApplicability\nAs I can't drag Network to my Finder sidebar — and as sidebar takes a different approach to showing shared items — I guess that: \n\n\n*\n\n*in Lion, Network is no longer applicable in the FAVORITES part of the sidebar\n\n*maybe for you, Network was amongst sidebar favourites in a previous version of the operating system. \n\n\nRemoving unwanted items from the property list\nProbably easiest with Xcode. \nIf you don't have Xcode, then use TextWrangler or anything that's capable of editing this type of property list. \nIdentifying items in the .plist\nXcode views of the property list:\n\n\nA TextWrangler view:\n\nTo view Network, with or without the sidebar\n⇧⌘K\nIn the sidebar\n\n\n*\n\n*show SHARED\n\n*click All…\n\nIf the option 'All…' does not appear\nFirst try removing, from the property list, unwanted or redundant items relating to Network. \nA guess: it may be necessary to quit Finder, or log out, before some types of change become effective. \nIf following removals and a log out you find that SHARED is still without All…, consider asking a separate question.\n\nA: I know this is an old thread and I am unsure if you've solved this problem or not, but I thought I'd still post as it could potentially help others that come across this problem. I noticed recently that I, too, had this 'Network' appear on my Finder sidebar. When I clicked it, it did nothing at all and I could not remove it by right clicking. Pretty much I was in the same situation. As a solution to rid of it, I simply held [option]+[command] and dragged it on to the desktop, then poof, problem solved.\nIda\n\nA: This icon is a gateway to all the networked storage devices, computers, and printers on your local network IF there are any. This can also be access from the GO menu of the finder, or using the shortcut ⌘⇧K. It might not have any function if no such devices are present. If the sidebar item is annoying you, you can simply remove it by right clicking it.\n\nA: From the root of your computer there is an item 'Network'. I assume this is a favorite to that. I've just been playing around and can't see it, but I so have various networked devices in Shared, and in Devices, so no idea what it's for. Remove it if it bothers you.\nFor me all the items in Network from my computer root appear on the sidebar in Shared.\nWhen it is present does it match a time a device on your network is active or sharing something? Eg. someone using iTunes with sharing on. This might be linked to Bonjour.\nTo remove:\nFrom Finder: File -> Preferences -> Sidebar. From there you can remove it if it has no use.\n\nA: For me, this shortcut was something that was brought over from Leopard/Snow Leopard days. My account has always been migrated, and I had the very same question as yours. I recently bought a new MacBook Air with Lion preinstalled, and I set this up as a new secondary account and there is no Network shortcut visible (even when I have other Macs on the same network as per your addendum). \n", "Q: Does Apple's license for OS X allow it to be virtualized on an HP PC? I have an HP laptop and I'm thinking about buying OS X and running it inside a virtual machine on the laptop.\nIs running OS X inside virtual machine allowed by the license?\n\nA: No. Apple expressly forbids running any Mac OS on a computer that is not made by Apple, under any circumstances.\nWhat Apple does allow is running multiple instances of Mac OS X 10.7 Lion under a virtual machine on an Apple Macintosh computer that also runs Lion. This would not be of much use to a consumer; it is designed for use by developers and on servers for software testing and network implementation purposes.\n\nA: Lion is the first Mac OS X to license some virtualization on the non-server OS.\nFrom the 10.7 EULA:\n\n\n*\n\n*(iii) to install, use and run up to two (2) additional copies or instances of the Apple Software within virtual operating system environments on each Mac Computer you own or control that is already running the Apple Software.\n\n\nNotice the condition, though: it's only allowed on Mac hardware when running Lion as the host OS.  There are also provisions for installing it over Snow Leopard macs. \nRunning it on HP hardware would likely be a violation of the license as written.

I'm trying to set up a score in Logic for multiple parts, and the horns are each in their own key signature (trumpet, saxophone, trombone) which isn't necessarily the key that the piano is recorded in. How can I get the Logic file to play back the sampled instruments with the correct notes, but have the sheet music generated display the notes as they would need to be transcribed for the live musicians? I've played around with global key signature changes and that's not helping.\n\nA: You will have better luck if you post your question at the Apple Support Communities discussion forum for Logic Studio.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/community/professional_applications/logic_studio\nFor instance, see this post: \"How do you set up Logic Pro 9 for transposing instruments?\"\nI would also suggest that if you are serious about working with sheet music and arranging parts for orchestral ensembles, that you look into creating your scores in the Sibelius or Finale dedicated music notation programs. Logic's sheet music capabilities are quite limited by comparison. Sibelius and Finale both have excellent capabilities for playing back your sheet music score with virtual instrument libraries. After your score is complete, you can move to Logic for recording audio if that is required. \n", "Q: Is it possible to \"update\" iTunes? Is it actually possible to update iTunes running on Windows 7 Ultimate?\nBecause every time I've tried, it fails with an error about one service or another. The error is usually related to not having sufficient permissions to modify the service, even though my account is configured as Administrator, and the service varies.\nThe only way to get the latest version installed consistently is to manually uninstall everything, reboot, then run the installer.\n\nA: Just remove the iTunes app and redownload it from apple's website. If you just remove the app it should leave your media files untouched but take a backup just in case.\n\nA: First, have you installed all the Microsoft security updates to Windows 7 using Windows Update? For instance, are you up to Windows 7 SP1?\nAlso, have you tried disabling (or \"snoozing\") your anti-virus software for the time it takes to run the iTunes installer?

But when I do a back-up and I copy all these files to another computer, running Windows too, there are always some files where the metadata such as song name, track number, or album title are wrong or disappear.\nAlso, it happens when I run Ubuntu with other media players, so I suppose it's not Windows' fault and it happens with other operating systems even on the same machine.\nSo, my question is: What could I do to make the metadata permanent on all of my songs so I would not need to fix them again? Could iTunes update some kind of information other than the ID3 tags, and could this cause these mistakes in the songs' metadata?\n\nA: I doubt iTunes is directly involved. iTunes edits your metadata when you tell it to do so by using the built-in id3 tagger or the fetch cover function. iTunes updates other information like playcounts or ratings in a separate database file that doesn't affect songs metadata.  \nI suggest the next time you see a such badly tagged mp3, you investigate using an id3 editor (eg Tag and Rename) : \n\n\n*\n\n*are the ID3v1 tags synchronized with the ID3v2 tags ?\n\n*if ID3v2 are present, which version is it? 2.2? 2.3? 2.4?\n\n*try to spot oddities that could confuse players : many covers embedded, huge size of the comment field, etc\n\n\nSo I suggest that it's one of those corner case that iTunes happen to process well and not your other player. But to answer more directly to your question, if you think that some process has altered your metadata, you can set the files as read-only to prevent any modification.\n\nA: Just a guess, but are there m3u files involved? I had this problem years ago, when importing Albums from WinAmp with m3u files. The information is stored in those files rather than the id3 tag. Quite annoying.\n", "Q: MS Office always slower on Mac? I have been using Microsoft Office Mac since the 2004 version. Right now, I have Office 2011 running on my trusty 2010 MacBook Pro with a Core i7 2.66 gHz CPU and 8 GB of memory.\nStarting with Mac Office 2004, I noticed that it is always slower than its Windows counterparts. For instance, Word opens in a few seconds on a Windows system, but takes ~10 seconds on a Mac.\nIs this generally true for everyone? Or is it just a fluke that Office has always been very slow for me on a Mac?\n\nA: Since the Windows version pre-loads some of the apps at boot time, here's how to do a comparison. \n\n\n*\n\n*Start with your Mac turned off.\n\n*Press the power button and start your timer.\n\n*Wait for the Mac to boot, then open Word. When Word is open, stop your timer.\n\n*Then repeat the test for a Windows PC, starting with the PC turned off.\n\n\nAlso note that Office 2004 was written for PowerPC chips, but you're running it on an Intel Mac. That slows things down because Intel Macs have to translate all that PowerPC code into Intel code. If you upgrade to Office 2008 or 2011, you'll have an Intel version of Office for Mac, and it should run faster.\n\nA: You shouldn't be very surprised since Microsoft depends on office's reputation as a selling point of windows. Why would they make it just as good on the mac? If you want speed I highly suggest you give iWork a shot\n\nA: Office 2004 for Mac was Microsoft's 1st attempt to get their products across to the Macintosh. To have all the features from Windows still working for the Mac (I guess) they had to work around some issues, especially since Apple was using PowerPC processors, they had to ensure compatibility with those as well, making their 1st product a rather slow one.\nNow though Office 2011 for Mac and Office 2010 for Windows (which are literally the same but for different OS) starts as quickly on Mac OS X Lion as it on Windows 7.\n", "Q: How to create a Windows 7 installation USB from OS X? I'm trying to create a Windows 7 installation USB (for use on a PC) from OS X.\nI've tried following these instructions from a similar question on superuser:\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert the USB flash drive and run the command diskutil list to find out the disk name, we'll use /dev/disk1 as an example\n\n*Now unmount the disk using diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk1\n\n*dd if=/path/to/Win7.iso of=/dev/disk1 bs=8192\nBut the instructions don't work. When I insert the created USB drive into my PC and try to boot from it, I get this message:\n\nReboot and Select proper Boot device or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press a key\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nA: Turns out OS X Lion ships with Boot Camp 4.0, the coolest feature of which appears to be the ability to create install USBs.\n\nA: I hope I am not offending you, but this issue may have something to do with your level of understanding of what that terminal command actually does.\nYou can't just copy and paste the command :\ndd if=/path/to/Win7.iso of=/dev/disk1 bs=8192\n\n.. and expect that to work.\nYou need to change the above command to point to the actual location of your \"Win7.iso\" file (if that is what it's named).\neg.\nSay I have a file called \"windo7.iso\" and it's currently located on my desktop, then the command that you should be using is :\ndd if=~/Desktop/windo7.iso of=/dev/disk1 bs=8192\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I've edited the Info.plist of Boot Camp to be able (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR5KZnRqcxg)\nIf you have a DVD-ROM try http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203909\n\nA: After dd, you should check if your new partitions on the USB device are marked as active.

Every time I install an app in app store on iPad, the app store will close. This is annoying when I want to install multiple apps at once. Is there a way to stop it from doing this?\n\nA: Apple implemented this in iOS 6. Install iOS 6 and enjoy the updated appstore.\n\nA: Without a jailbreak, no.\nIf you are willing to jailbreak your iPad, it appears this might solve your problem.\n\nA: You will need to jailbreak your device and install the tweak called StayOpened by searching for it in Cydia. If you need assistance with the jail breaking process, check out http://jailbreakqa.com/\nIn fact, there is yet another tweak (in Cydia) that optimizes the iOS installation process by automatically entering your password for you. It's called PasswordPilot.

When I boot into OSX Lion (and Snow Leopard before it) I would get a Drobo icon on the desktop. The icon looks like a shiny rendered picture of a Drobo with the funky blue and green lights.\nAfter a little while the icon changes to a generic USB drive icon with a time machine logo on it. Is there any way to make it stay as a drobo icon, despite being a Time Machine backup volume?\n\nA: There is an easy fix, but it's not so elegant. You can change the default icon used for time machine disks to the icon used for your drobo disk. This can be done by swapping out the system's time machine volume icon located in:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemIcons.bundle/Contents/Resources\n\nNote: this will only be an elegant solution if the Drobo is the only time machine disk you use for that machine. Be sure to back up the original Time Machine icon just incase you want it back in the future.\n\nA: The following solution worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a new folder on your desktop (any name is fine)\n\n*disable time machine (not necessary, but buys you time if you walk away from computer during net step)\n\n*reboot your computer\n\n*at bootup, drobo icon is not yet changed to time machine icon\n\n*right click drobo, click get info\n\n*right click on small drobo icon at top of get info panel and press Cmd+C to copy\n\n*right click on created folder, click on small folder icon at top of get info panel and press Cmd+V to paste. you should now have drobo icon representing that folder\n\n*restart time machine and run backup. this will turn your drobo icon to time machine icon\n\n*copy icon from created folder back to drobo in same manner as above.\n\n*the icon should now \"stick\"\n\n\nYou can delete the temporary folder, or better yet stick it somewhere in case you need to use it again later.\nHope this works for you as it has for me!\n", "Q: How can I reset the PRAM if Recovery Mode keeps overriding the PRAM command? Lion uses the ⌘ + R to boot into recovery mode. Resetting the PRAM in anything less than 10.7 was ⌘ + ⌥ + P + R.\nRecovery mode now seems to override the PRAM command. Does anyone know if there is a new way to reset the PRAM now that Lion is installed?\n\nA: Nate , PRAM reset is not working because you turn on Password Firmware Protection.\nTurn it off and P+R+Option+Command will work.\n\nA: Resetting the PRAM works the same way it always did.  This is a function of the hardware - not the OS.  What makes you think it doesn't work anymore?

I'm currently running a Snow Leopard Server, and trying to get anything useful working with the v1.1 version of Dovecot bundled with it is as pleasant as banging my head against a brick wall.\nDovecot's extremely sparse documentation has a lot of mentions of horribly-crippling bugs (specifically with public mailboxes and permissions) in 1.1 that were only fixed in 1.2. Which is not helpful for me since Apple has their own frustratingly-special blend of dovecot build (1.1.20apple0.5) for Snow Leopard Servers.\nSo, does the new Lion Server have enough Dovecot functionality to make it worth using?\n\nA: Dovecot 239 is how it's listed by Apple as open source that was shipped with Lion 10.7 Build 11A511.\nYou can see lots of nice version and source code information at http://www.opensource.apple.com/release/mac-os-x-107/ in case the 239 doesn't match the real version of the package.\nIf you want to compare the current with past versions, many versions of OS X are listed at http://www.opensource.apple.com/\n", "Q: Making it so programs aren't restored after startup from a forced shutdown Whenever I boot up from a forced shutdown (aka holding down the power button), OSX restores all the programs I had open before the forced shutdown.

When I convert it to PDF, it loses its style and font.\nI've tried exporting it as a PDF as well as printing it as a PDF. \nAny suggestions on how I could keep its format and font intact when conveying it to PDF?\nThanks\n\nA: What sort of styling is gone wrong when converting to PDF? And which version of iWork and Mac are you running atm?\nFrom experience (under 10.6) I can only say never to have had problems with converting to PDF or printing as PDF. If your iWork is messed up, you may want to consider reinstalling. (Use CleanApp for that) or install a newer version (do you have iWork '09? have you fully updated it?).\n\nA: Try exporting a normal file (so, no images, bold-fonts, font-types,...) just two lines with a different font-size and some additional taps. Can you export these files as PDF and keeping the style and layout?\nAn alternative could be Zamzar. An online-converting tool. But I can suggest the same as Max Z., try reïnstalling the software!\n", "Q: Magnetic timeline in Final Cut Pro X optional? Is the magnetic timeline on Final Cut Pro X optional? I see the advantages of the magnetic timeline, but nonetheless still prefer dedicated layers as it gives me a much greater sense of control of specific kinds of resources. I have been considering Final Cut Pro X but if the magnetic timeline is imposed upon its users, or if it is optional but there are no significant layer controls when magnetic timeline is disabled such as hide/mute, etc., it's a complete showstopper for me. I'm coming from Sony Vegas Platinum HD 10 to which I migrated from iMovie, and right now Final Cut Pro X looks like going back to iMovie.\n\nA: It's not optional. However, in use, I think you'll adjust and have the same sense of control very quickly. Have a look at the various online tutorials. I found this one exceptionally helpful http://www.izzyvideo.com/final-cut-pro-x-tutorial/ Also spend a little time with it and you'll soon see it's not anything like iMovie.\n", "Q: Sorting documents in Lion I recently discovered that on Mac OS 10.7 (aka Lion) my documents on my NAS are arranged in the order \"Z, Y, X, W, V, etc...\". So how do I specifically change this setting of the arranging order? The bars on top (in 10.6) are now gone...\n\nA: You need to change the view properties of the Finder window. Here's how to do it using Menu commands.\n\n\n*\n\n*View the Finder Window as a List (View > As List).\n\n*Set \"Arrange By\" to None. (View > Arrange By > None).\n\n\nYou should now see the Finder window property headers and then you can click on Name to sort ascending or descending.\n", "Q: How do we set OS X Lion sync to show warning before data on computer is changed? In the past we used to have to go to iSync preferences but iSync has been completely removed in OS X Lion. Any ideas?\nI would personally prefer a warning before any data is changed on my computer, on account of issues such as Snow Leopard used to \"support\" Google Contacts sync but would remove all nicknames from your contacts.\n\nA: If you still have your snapshot backup of your OSX Snow Leopard before you upgraded to Lion (you did backup didn't you?), then there is a solution to getting iSync back up and working under Lion :\nslashusr.wordpress.com\nExtract follows :\n\nBefore installation of Lion, I had taken a full disk image of my\n  previous Snow Leopard installation using the excellent SuperDuper!\n  Disk cloner.\nThis was more from a backup and recovery perspective, but allowed me\n  an unexpected solution to the iSync quandary – on a whim, I attached\n  the Snow Leopard disk to the Mac running Lion, and clicked on the\n  iSync application.

I've used wget for the first time after installing Lion OS X and I've noticed that wget got localized to my native language. Running set command in terminal showed that my LANG variable represents my local language. Where can I change this or make wget ignore this setting?\nupdate\nHere's what locale gives me:\nLANG=\"lt_LT.UTF-8\"\nLC_COLLATE=\"lt_LT.UTF-8\"\nLC_CTYPE=\"lt_LT.UTF-8\"\nLC_MESSAGES=\"lt_LT.UTF-8\"\nLC_MONETARY=\"lt_LT.UTF-8\"\nLC_NUMERIC=\"lt_LT.UTF-8\"\nLC_TIME=\"lt_LT.UTF-8\"\nLC_ALL=\n\nHence all the output of non-parameters (such as prompts and debug messages) are in Lithuanian. That is my problem. I'd like to get it back to English.\nI am using zsh as my login shell.\n\nA: It's set here...\n\nIf you want more or less options in the pulldown, head over to the Encodings tab to view even more of the bounty.\n\nA: I solved this problem by setting the language in my .profile file which loads whenever I start a terminal.\nexport LANG=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nexport LC_ALL=\"POSIX\"\n\n\nA: By default, Terminal sets the locale environment variables to match the currently selected language and time/date/number formats that Terminal is using, which is selected via\n\nSystem Preferences > Language and Text\n\n(That's the name on Lion. On earlier systems the exact name of the preference panel may vary.)\nA temporary solution is to drag English to the top of the list of languages, then open Terminal, then move Lithuanian back to the top. Then only Terminal will be in English. However, it will reset to Lithuanian if you Quit and restart Terminal.\nA persistent approach is to tell Terminal to not set the locale environment variables, by turning off\n\nTerminal > Preferences > Settings > [profile] > Advanced > Set locale environment variables on startup\n\nThen the locale will default to \"C\" with no language specified, and most programs will then default to English.\nNote that turning this off means that some programs won't be aware of which character encoding Terminal is using and will assume that it's ASCII or ISO-Latin-1 only. So if Terminal is using UTF-8 (the default), those programs may or may not behave as desired.\nIf this is mostly about wget, I recommend that you make a copy of the default settings profile, turn off the locale setting in your custom profile, and only use that profile when using wget, so that you can continue to use UTF-8 with full support when using other programs, using the default settings.\nAs others have mentioned, you can also override the initial locale settings supplied by Terminal in a shell startup script. For zsh, put it in ~/.zshrc. For bash, use ~/.bashrc (and if you don't already have one, create a ~/.bash_profile that runs ~/.bashrc).\nSee x-man-page://1/locale for more information about each of the locale environment values.\nHowever, if you were to merely unset LANG or set it to \"C\", that would normally apply to all of your shells and programs, whereas most of the time you probably want to use UTF-8 and have Terminal set the locale variables to match, to get the highest degree of cooperation, fidelity and functionality.\nTherefore, if you're going to go that route, I suggest you write code to edit, rather than replace, the initial values, so that you preserve the encoding information (\"UTF-8\") and merely force the language to English, rather than setting the variables to \"C\".\nFor example, this works in zsh and bash:\n# Replace Lithuanian with English\nexport LANG=${LANG/lt_LT/en_US}\n\nWhen LANG=\"lt_LT.UTF-8\", this will change it to LANG=\"en_US.UTF-8\". I don't have wget available to test this, but this should suffice.\nDoing it this way means that if you change the character encoding preference in Terminal, you won't override that in your shell startup script.\n\nA: Based more on Linux exprience, if you do not want to change your localization completely with LC_LANG,  but would like just have system messages in english,\nyou shuld just set\nLC_COLLATE=C    (to have standard sorting in ls, etc)\nLC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8\n\n\nA: The other answers are correct, i.e. about the Terminal setting for set locale environment variables on startup and using the shell's /etc/profile. However, there is another way that is worth understanding - especially if the \"problem\" is experienced due to a remote ssh login.\nOpenSSH (as used on Linux, BSD and macOS) can send environment variables from the client's environment to the shell that the server starts. It only does this if the client is configured to send them and the server is configured to accept them. The client (~/.ssh/config) would need to have:\nSendEnv LANG LC_*\n\nand the server (/etc/ssh/sshd_config) would need:\nAcceptEnv LANG LC_*\n\nIf those are both in place then the client's local is propagated into the login shell on the ssh server:\n$ ssh me@my-mac locale\nLANG=\"en_GB.UTF-8\"\nLC_COLLATE=\"en_GB.UTF-8\"\nLC_CTYPE=\"en_GB.UTF-8\"\nLC_MESSAGES=\"en_GB.UTF-8\"\nLC_MONETARY=\"en_GB.UTF-8\"\nLC_NUMERIC=\"en_GB.UTF-8\"\nLC_TIME=\"en_GB.UTF-8\"\nLC_ALL=\n\nThe required server setting is not there by default on Snow Leopard; it is there on Sierra. Remember to restart the SSH server after modifying /etc/sshd_config !!!\n\nA: Using a debian server in french and a macsox bash client, i \"just\" had to add this to my .bash_profile on the user directory of macosx :\n\nexport LANG=fr_FR.UTF-8\n\nSolved.\n", "Q: Can the finder edit mp3 sound file tags like artist? How can I change artist of multiple selected mp3 files in finder?\nLike in windows we can select multiple mp3 files and can change the artist of all selected file in properties.\n\nA: iTunes can do this for you easily. You cannot do it in the Finder, so do it in iTunes instead. You do not need any third-party program. This method works for iTunes on Macintosh as well as iTunes on Windows.\n1) Select multiple files\n\n2) Right-click or control-click and select \"Get Info\"\n\n3) Read the dialog box and click \"Yes\".\n\n4) In this dialog, any change you make will impact all the multiple files you selected. Click OK when you are done.\n\n\nA: Finder doesn't have the smarts to change this - but finder does have a services menu that will allow you to craft a custom automator service that would help automate the process.\nYou can pop up a dialog to get the artist name, store it, import the songs to iTunes and set the Artist (and/or many of the other tags)\nThis is a nice way to learn automator if you care, but Finder won't be doing the writing of the mp3 tags. iTunes will launch and do the writing once finder hands off the file(s) and the variable name storing the artist string to iTunes.\n\n\nA: I am 99% sure that Finder cannot change tags. Check here for free ID3 editors.\n\nA: A very easy way is using VLC Media Player.\nRight click into select the song and click at Window ->  Media Information.

Recently I connected it to Macbook and found that the folders I set \"hidden\" in windows still can be seen and read in mac os x. So, what can I do to hide these folders in Mac OS X? Also, I want these folders still to be hidden if the disk connected to other Macs.\n\nA: There are two ways I know of.\nYou can start the folder's name with a \".\", as in \".folder\". This will hide them on any Mac, though other Windows can see them.\nOr you can use the Terminal command \"chflags hidden ~/Documents/folder\", replacing that place with the path to whichever folder it is you want to hide. But I don't think this would hide them when connected to another Mac.\nYou might want to look into using an encryption service like TrueCrypt.\n\nA: The simple answer is that macs will read NTFS disks since Mac OS X 10.3 Panther and later.\nThe default behavior doesn't hide any files that NTFS has marked as \"hidden\". You could theoretically try to install software on all your macs to ensure they respect this hidden attribute (Tuxera makes such software)\nThe same problem will happen when you take your \"hidden\" files to any Linux or Unix\nThis sort of \"security by obscurity\" can be useful to put something out of sight, but you will need to encrypt these files more strongly to hide them from other OS that don't abide by the Windows convention to not show certain files.\nMacs have the same problem - the hidden attribute for HFS+ filesystems doesn't translate to other OS. Macs do follow the Unix convention to automatically \"hide\" files that start with a .\nPerhaps you could rename your files to start with a . and also do whatever you currently do to make them be hidden on NTFS.\nThat would keep them hidden on Macs and Windows alike.\n\nA: The easiest way would be to add a period (.) to the front of the filename - this will hide it in the Finder.\nYou could also run this in terminal: chflags hidden path/to/file but I'm not sure if this will work on an NTFS formatted volume, as I've not tried it on one.\n", "Q: iPod Nano 5g recording specs? What are the specs for voice recording on the Ipod nano fifth generation (such as how long can the iPod record until its battery runs out, what are the mic specs, does it continue recording until it runs out of space or battery)?\n\nA: Apple's information article on recording on the iPod nano is here.\nThe iPod nano can operate for up to 24 hours on a battery charge.\nThe built-in microphone is monaural and, I guarantee you, is of the lowest quality. You may be able to purchase a compatible third-party external monaural microphone of higher quality that connects through the headphone port or the dock connector. Consult the microphone or headset manufacturer for compatibility information for the iPod nano.\nApple does not state any restriction on the length of the recording. The document I cite above states that the iPod nano records in WAV format, which usually implies 16-bit 44.1KHz uncompressed audio, and in this case it will be monaural using the built-in microphone. This kind of file takes up 5MB per minute in file size, and I assume that you can continue recording until the iPod nano's battery runs down or until the iPod nano no longer has any available file space to hold the recording.\n", "Q: Sluggish cursor movement in emacs in Lion Terminal? On upgrading to Lion, I noticed that cursor movement in emacs (^-N, ^-P and so on) while running in Terminal has become sluggish. Cursor movement in vi seems fine and cursor movement in Emacs.app seems fine too.\nAny ideas what is going on?\n\nA: Are you using a translucent terminal window appearance? Terminal now supports window background blur in addition to translucency, and existing settings profiles default to 20% blur (except Pro, which uses 0%). If you have a large terminal window and/or slower hardware, you may notice some slow down when moving around in emacs (compared to vim, emacs is noticeably inefficient about updating the display when moving the cursor around and redraws a lot, which requires redrawing the background).\nTry selecting a different profile or edit the profile to disable blur:\n\nTerminal > Preferences > Settings > [profile] > Window > Background > Color\n\n", "Q: In Lion, how can I configure to not automatically re-open recent files that weren't closed?

Instead, I would like the default to be one of the other flag options (Yellow, Purple, Grey, etc.).\nIs there any way to do this?\n\nA: This can be accomplished by customizing macOS keyboard shortcuts. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences, Keyboard, Shortcuts, App Shortcuts. \n\n*Click the plus-sign (+) button below the central pane. \n\n*In the next dialog, select Mail.app from the Application dropdown. \n\n*Type Yellow (or whatever color) as the Menu Title. \n\n*In Keyboard Shortcut, press something you wouldn't accidentally press as the keyboard shortcut (I chose CommandControlOptionShiftR). \n\n*Click Add. \n\n*Repeat the process with Yellow (or whatever other color you want that is available) as the Menu Title and CommandShiftL as the keyboard shortcut. \n\n\nNow when you use Mail, the new color will respond to CommandShiftL.\n", "Q: mid-2011 Macbook Air changes applications on wake from sleep When my new Macbook Air (13\" mid-2011, Lion) wakes from sleep (by opening the lid, clicking the mouse or pressing the space bar), it usually wakes to the last application I was using, then changes applications as if I had pressed alt-tab.\n\n\n*\n\n*Has anyone else observed this phenomenon and\n\n*Does anyone know what could be causing it\n\n\nA: This is related to the System Preference for when it prompts you for a password when it wakes up.  Change it to never, and it goes away (less secure) or always (more secure, but a PITA).  Here's the link that helped me:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3268136?start=0&tstart=0\n\nA: Repair your disk permission.\nReboot your system then press the ALT key. Select the Recovery partition and then use Disk Utility to repair permission.\nI think permissions repair better when you're not using the volume that you're mounted on.\n", "Q: Access Lion SMB shares from Linux I have this fantastic new Lion server that I've gotten all setup with my user accounts, files, etc. File sharing is up and running, everything. Except for one problem: the users running Linux (we use both Linux and OS X clients) cannot authenticate and access the SMB shares.\nAll of the users' accounts are setup as network accounts (i.e. in Open Directory not the local user database)\nInterestingly enough, if the user account is setup as a local account (not Open Directory) the user can authenticate just fine.

If I check the \"Encrypt backup disk\" checkbox in Time Machine (in OS X Lion), I get this warning:\n\nWill just the Time Machine \"Backups.backupdb\" directory be encrypted, or the entire disk?  In other words, will computers running earlier versions of OS X than 10.7 be unable to access the entire disk, or just be unable to back-up to or restore from the encrypted disk?\n\nA: It encrypts the partition that you use for Time Machine, which likely means the entire disk. If you partition the drive the other partitions will not be encrypted and should mount (I have not tested this).\n\nYou can see that \"Time Machine\" is encrypted, but \"Other Backups\" is not.\n\nA: It is actually the entire partition that is encrypted so if only one partition then in effect the entire disk. So other OSs can't read that partition.\nIf you want them to, partition the disk and encrypt only the part containing the backups.\n\nA: The quick answer is the whole disk is \"encrypted\".\nThis isn't technically true since you could conceivably use Disk Utility in debug mode / diskutil on the command line to partition the Drobo volume to have several partitions.\nIn practice - Time Machine just is working on a partition within a volume, so the idea of the \"whole disk\" is in reference to the consumer perception where a \"disk\" is connected and the icon for that \"disk\" shows up even though the implementation of a \"disk\" is a partition that contains encrypted data and relies on CoreStorage to do the encryption/decryption before the file system can be mounted on OS X.\n", "Q: Creating a Printing Profile I have a 13 inch mac pro running 10.6. I recently got a hp cp2025n. Is there a way to create a black and white printing profile. I am using the postscript driver.  I print a lot of pages and and prefer to print in black and white duplex to save pages and toner. How do I create a black and white print profile? \n\nA: Yes, you can do this. You'll use a feature called \"Presets\" which appears in the Print window. You can create a Preset so your color HP laserjet printer will print, by default, in greyscale (aka black and white) on both sides of the paper (duplex).\nHere's some guidance.\nOpen a document you want to print. Go to the File menu, select Print.\nThe print window appears. Locate the \"Preset\" section. You'll see it's set to Standard. \nYou're going to create a new Preset by doing the following. \nIn the \"Copies\" section you'll most likely see a box named \"Two-Sided\". Check this box.\nNext, click on the pop-up menu near the middle of the Print Window. The menu should be set to the name of the application you're using, such as Word or Safari. Click on this menu and select the section which lets you switch from color to greyscale. (For my Brother color printer the section is named \"Print Settings\" but HP may use a different section name). Select the greyscale option.\nNow that you've selected 2-sided and greyscale, then click on the Presets menu and select \"Save As\". Give your new preset a name. I suggest \"2-sided greyscale\".\nPrint your document by clicking the Print button.\nYou've now created a Preset which'll be available in all applications so you can easily print duplex, greyscale documents. This Preset will be the default until you select another Preset to use instead.\n", "Q: Obtaining the .dmg file for OS X Lion on a new MacBook Pro that has Lion preinstalled I recently purchased a new MacBook Pro with Lion preinstalled. I'm about to replace the hard drive, and I wanted to burn the Lion installer to DVD so that I could install OS X on the new HDD. However, all instructions I've found for creating a Lion boot disc assume that you've purchased and downloaded Lion from the App Store. On my new machine, is it possible to get the .dmg file and burn it so that I can reinstall Lion on my new SSD?\nIf this is not possible, what is the recommended approach?\n\nA: Sadly, Apple doesn't include a Lion install disc in the packaging with the new Macs, nor do they make it available to download.\nThey did just release Lion Recovery Disk Assistant which will allow you to make a recovery disk out of an external hard drive, which you can use to recover the existing installation or do a new install.\n\nA: Turn on the MacBook Pro and hold down the Alt key. Select your Wi-Fi network from the dropdown list and enter a password if requested. Once connected you should see an Internet Recovery option (tested on my new MacBook Air).\nIf you don't see this option, I guess the Lion shipping MacBook Pros do not have this feature and you will need to use the new Lion Recovery Disk Assistant which can create a Recovery Partition on suitable external media from which you can boot and reinstall Lion from:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/DL1433\n\nA: I believe that Lion makes a small, invisible recovery partition upon installation, and that there is a copy of the install dmg hidden away in there (likely within the Install.app bundle).\nI haven't dug into this myself, but it can't hurt to look.\n", "Q: Install Lion on new SSD on MBP 2009 I have a MBP mid-2009 and I'm running Snow Leopard on 500gb HDD (original mac HDD died).\nI'm thinkng about getting a 240Gb SSD and doing a fresh Lion install.\nWhat are the correct steps to get it going? Note that I don't need to move my old data and would prefer a \"clean\" Lion and not an upgrade.\n\nA: As per Patrick's answer (above).\nHowever, for all those people that would like to carry across all of their data and apps AFTER doing a clean Lion install, you could do the following :\n\n\n*\n\n*take a snapshot of your existing drive using either Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper.\n\n*make sure your external drive that contains your \"snapshot\" is plugged in and then reboot your mac\n\n*during the boot process, hold the alt/option key down when you hear the \"bong\" noise ..\n\n*select the external drive and confirm that you can boot using the external drive's \"snapshot\", in case you need to get back to a working boot situation.\n\n*at this point (while you are still booted from your external drive), you can now fire up \"Disk Utility\" and delete and then re-create a blank partition on your internal drive.\n\n*now re-boot and use the bootable USB Lion drive (as per Patrick's link in Patrick's answer, above).\n\n*Run through the install of a clean Lion OSX installation.\n\n*Once rebooted into a clean Lion install, now plug in your external drive that contains your \"snapshot\" of your Snow Leopard (or Leopard, or Tiger) that you made at step 1.\n\n*run the Lion \"Migration Assistant\", and tick what user accounts, and data and applications you want to carry across to your clean Lion install.\n\n*Enjoy a clean Lion OSX installation with all of your mouse preferences, desktop backgrounds, applications, and user data carried across.\n(note, this does not make your clean Lion install \"dirty\", since all of your old APE hacks etc are NOT carried across via \"migration assistant\").\n\nA: Make a backup to an external drive and burn Your Own OS X Lion Install DVD or USB Drive while running Snow Leopard. Change the HDDs and install from the USB. You can get an external case for the old HDD just to have access to your data.\n", "Q: Ejecting disk from non-booting Macbook My Macbook does not power up for more than a few seconds, and I have declared it dead. The only issue is that there is still a disk inside of it of Snow Leopard. The MB doesn't power on long enough to push the trackpad button, or do the PRAM Reset, or press the Eject button on the keyboard before shutting down again. Any ideas how to MANUALLY remove the disk?\n\nA: Get a standard USB mouse, attach it and press and hold the primary mouse button, while starting. This invokes the eject before the blutooth drivers are even loaded.\n\nA: Kind of a shot in the dark, but one reason a MacBook won't start up at all is that the battery is so dead that it tells the Mac not to run. Some models allow you to still run the computer with the power adapter attached and the battery removed. Have you tried that? If it works, you can keep things running long enough to eject the disk.\nYou can also (kind of a desperation move) work a thin bit of plastic (thinner than a credit card) around in the slot to try to get it under or on top of the disc and work it back and forth until the disc pops out.\n", "Q: Internet tethering with iPod Touch 2G I have a PC which does not have a build in WLan-Chip. But over the weekend, I'll temporarily move to some place where there is no cable-connection available.\nSo now I'm trying to find out if I can use tethering to make my iPod's Internet-connection available to my PC (over USB since the PC has no Bluetooth either). I do not have a WLan-adapter or something I could use instead. And since this is only for a few days, I don't want to buy one.\nThe iPod runs iOS 4.2.1 and is jailbroken. I tried using MyWi 4 to archive this, but when I connect the iPod to the PC (using the USB-cable), nothing happens. The latest iTunes version (10.4) is installed on that PC.\niPhones do have a native tethering-option but this is not available on iPod Touch. Is there any way to activate it (by changing some .preferences-files)? I know it's (for example) possible to activate the native multi-tasking that way.\nIf this is not possible, is there any App out there which works? It seams that MyWi does not work since iTunes 10.1 so is there any other one that works? What do you use?\n\nA: Try PdaNet\n", "Q: Microsoft Excel formula or search? I have four Microsoft Excel workbooks (excel spreadsheets). One is a list of Donors and the other three are separate campaigns which had click-throughs from an email blast. What I've been asked to do is to find out which click-throughs actually donated to that campaign.\nHope this makes sense. I'd love some help on what to do...be it a macro or formula to tie together two workbooks, or perhaps there's a simpler solution I'm missing.\n\nA: You can simple reference another workbook with by prefixing your formula with the filename in square brackets:\n=[donors.xls]Sheet1!A5\n\nand work with that.\nIf the files are not in the same directory, try to specify the path:\n=/Users/somewhat/files/[donors.xls]Sheet1!A5\n\nPS: That works for Excel on Windows. But I hope this works the same way for Office for Mac.\n", "Q: What's a reliable method to create a stand alone recovery disk for Lion? I'm seeing a lot of questions with all sorts of steps to burn a DVD or create a USB disk so you can boot your Mac with Lion if the internal drive is replaced.\nIs there a definitive set of steps that is best in terms of support, reliability and cost?\n\nA: A 3rd party utility that creates bootable DVD or USB/hard drive installers for OS X 10.6, 10.7, and 10.8 is:  LionDiskMaker.\n\nA: This might help\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/dl1433\n\"The Lion Recovery Disk Assistant lets you create Lion Recovery on an external drive that has all of the same capabilities as the built-in Lion Recovery: reinstall Lion, repair the disk using Disk Utility, restore from a Time Machine backup, or browse the web with Safari.\"\n", "Q: How can I troubleshoot sharing problems from outside the LAN? I'm trying to connect with a server that is not on the same network as my mac, when I enter the ip address the connection doesn't go through. The ip is correct, the server is on, and remote access & login are allowed; I even tried sending the login name i.e afp://ipaddres/shortname. Is there something I am not doing or doing wrong?\n\nA: You may need to set up port forwarding so that you can connect to your server even though it's behind NAT from your router.\n", "Q: Desktop clean up function - Control, Command 1 – is not working after I installed Lion? Other keyboard shortcuts are working, as far as I can tell What I thought was a universal keyboard shortcut (ctrl+⌘+1) to cleanup and arrange my desktop, no longer works after I installed Lion. I can go up to the view drop down menu and click on it and it works but I like to use my commands. What can I do about this?\n\nA: The keyboard command appears to be ⌘+⌥+1 to clean up by name now.\n", "Q: sketchy email from apple/itunes i recently just upgraded to osx lion(july 30 here). Today I just received a receipt from itunes of my purchase with the receipt date as 01/08/11. \nI have read about recurring charges from apple about this but not for credit card(i think the problem was paypal). I immediately double checked my account and sure enough there was only 1 purchase.\nIm still paranoid though. I am in  the philippines and I wouldn't want to call their US number(maybe only as a last resort). Was this just a matter of the receipt email being a week late? or is it a real double charge?\n\nA: Apple delays charging of cards for purchases on the App Store/iTunes, and hence email confirmations. They do this so they don't need to charge your card multiple times if you happen to buy a bunch of stuff close to each other, saves them from having to pay some processing fees.\nI bought Lion on July 20th and didn't see an email confirmation until the 25th, and that confirmation listed the receipt date as July 22nd.\n\nA: I can't confirm that it's not a phishing attempted, but I upgraded to Lion two days ago (the 8th) and I still haven't received an email confirming my purchase, which is usually the case when I do purchase from the AppStore. Any confirmation emails have always been a few days post-purchase for me, and I've never been double charged (I was also worried the first couple times and check my bank accounts repeatedly), so from my experience you should fine unless you do get a second purchase email as Paul pointed out. \n\nA: Did you receive one receipt e-mail, or two? If you only received one, and you have only been charged once, then I would be very tempted to not worry about it. Just keep an eye on your card statements to ensure that you don't end up getting double billed.\nIf you received two receipt e-mails, then I would call Apple.\nAlthough I cannot confirm a one week delay, I can certainly confirm a delay of several days, and I could easily believe that there store was very busy during the Lion launch, leading to additional delays in the billing, and receipting.\n\nA: Sadly, It could be a phishing attempt - there are no \"recurring charges\" on the store - you get billed for the purchase when you make it. I suppose some in app purchases are subscription based, but certainly not Lion.\nIf you are at all in doubt, forward it to reportphishing@apple.com and use their web site to ask for billing help directly. You'll likely have your mind at ease and can junk that message.\nhttp://www.apple.com/support/itunes/\nClick iTunes Store Account and Billing, then Billing Inquiries and shoot them an email for free.\n\n", "Q: Some icons appear twice in the Sidebar I have two MacBooks and a Mac Mini that are synchronized through Mobile Me. All times they synchronize to Mobile Me, the MacBooks (which runs Mac OS X Lion) keep showing some icons two times, in the sidebar of the Finder; this doesn't happen to the Mac Mini, which runs Mac OS X Snow Leopard.\nWhat can I do to avoid this, apart avoiding that the MacBooks running Mac OSX Lion synchronize with Mobile Me?\n\nA: The reason is because the applications are slightly different for each version of the OS so they are in effect 2 applications. Until you upgrade your mac mini I would recommend turning off syncing of just the dock. \n", "Q: How do I disable Chrome's two-finger back/forward navigation? In dev builds of Chrome, they've implemented, refined, and released two-finger swipes left/right in order to browse back/forward in the browser history. Unfortunately, you can accidentally trigger it while you're in the middle of a long down/up scroll, which needless to say occurs often.\nI generally like the gesture, and things like Preview, Safari, and other application have implemented it much better, where you cannot blindly navigate back/forward so long as you have begun to scroll up/down.\nHow do I selectively disable two-finger back/forward navigation in Chrome?\n\nA: This is available as the #overscroll-history-navigation flag in chrome://flags\n\nOverscroll history navigation\nHistory navigation in response to horizontal overscroll. – Windows, Linux, Chrome OS\n#overscroll-history-navigation\n\n\nA: The only way I'm currently of is two disable two-finger page swiping system-wide, from the Trackpad section of System Preferences. I wait patiently for Chrome to either fix its implementation, or at least provide an app preference for disabling the feature.\n\nA: I know its over a year later, but I had the same question, and then figured out the answer myself.\nOpen terminal and type:\ndefaults write com.google.Chrome AppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls -bool FALSE\n\nThen restart Chrome.\nNow you can have it enabled system wide, and just disabled for chrome. By the way, this works for any app, just replace com.google.Chrome with the bundle identifier of the target app. \nIf your interested in how it works, the AppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls is the global setting, that can be overwritten for any specified app. \nHope this helps someone in the future.\n\nA: Summary:\nIt looks like Google Chrome uses Apples default gestures, so by disabling Apples gestures you disable Chromes. However, you probably still love some gestures like I do. For that get BetterTouchTools.\nDisable Google Chromes Gestures\nYou can disable chromes gestures by going to System Preference > Mouse OR Trackpad > More Gestures > and uncheck Swipe between pages.\nKeep the Gestures You Want\nI still love gestures so I downloaded BetterTouchTools which allows me to make the gestures I want. I disabled all apples gestures then created my own. You can get very custom with gestures this way. Or if you prefer, leave some of apples gestures on and use BetterTouchTools for the more custom ones.\n\nA: There are two different properties, one is for the Trackpad: AppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls, the other is for the Mouse/Magic Mouse: AppleEnableMouseSwipeNavigateWithScrolls.\nSo you need to execute one or both of these commands:\ndefaults write com.google.Chrome AppleEnableMouseSwipeNavigateWithScrolls -bool false\ndefaults write com.google.Chrome AppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls -bool false\n\n\nA: I went into the System Prefs and changed the Page change gesture from two fingers to three (OSX Lion). The three finger swipe seems to be more responsive at any rate and I'm usually only using two fingers for everything else.\nSystem Preferences > Trackpad > More Gestures > Swipe between pages\n\nA: Chrome Canary users should use: \ndefaults write com.google.Chrome.canary AppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls -bool FALSE\n\n\nA: I also tried the terminal command on Yosemite, it didn't work for me. \nAnd then I tried uncheck \"Swipe between pages\" in mouse settings, and it worked. \n\n", "Q: Mac OS binding to Samba PDC Does anyone join a Mac OS to Samba PDC?\nMy point is to build a single domain for different clients (win xp, win 7, mac os 10.6) with home folders and roaming profiles.\nI see 2 posible solutions:\n1. Win binds to Samba PDC, Mac binds to OpenLDAP. In this case, OpenLDAP requires some schemas (see down this topic). And i don't know how to manage this.\n2. All clients bind to Samba Domain. Mac client thinks it join to AD, and doesn't need something else. As i found, mac requires Kerberos. \nI've installed Ubuntu Server 10.04 + OpenLDAP + Samba PDC + Gosa (for managment). It works fine with windows clients, but macintosh machines don't want to bind for some reasons:\n1. Binding to OpenLDAD. It requires some apple schemes. When i try to add converted schemas from mac os (/etc/openldap/schema/apple.schema) it says i haven't necessary objectClasses. As i understood it needs apple samba schema, but i have already installed own schemes.\n2. Binding to Samba PDC as AD \nIt requires Kerberos. In this case i don't know what should i do? How should i install it: as a backend for samba, where should i hold principal base, etc...?\nps: Own mac os x 10.6 server works fine with mac clients through Open Directory (OpenLDAP variant). But win clients with Samba don't work for some reasons...\n\nA: Chapter 8 of Apple's Open Directory Admin 10.6 manual describes in great detail the operations you wish to complete. Also, skimming the table of contents for the word \"bind\" will also reveal information useful to you. Further, the dsconfigad man page will also help you accomplish your goal. There are easy instructions on how to use dsconfigad here. You can also achieve what you are attempting using the Directory Utility in your /Applications/Utilities folder. There are easy instructions on how to use the Directory Utility here, and it lists the prerequisites each Mac needs to bind to such a network.

Can the display casing for a 13\" MacBook Pro be used in lieu of the corresponding part for a 13\" Aluminum Unibody MacBook??\nBoth screens have identical specifications and appear to have the internal connectors. Also, with the new aluminum construction heralding being a new design, it's doubtful that Apple made major changes to the frame or significantly modified the internals when they refreshed the old aluminum unibody MacBook.\nThat being said, I don't have access to either of these screens, and a fairly innocuous difference (say a difference of an inch on one of the internal cables) could render them incompatible. Another opinion or, better yet, first-hand experience, would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: No - the cable routing for the pro comes to the left side and the MacBook on the right. Check fixit.com for the details - it matters if you have a 2009/2010/2011 MacBook pro - each part is slightly different. \n", "Q: MBP Keys 'stick' when it gets hot Short Question\nWhy do the keys 'stiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick' when my MBP gets hot?  More importantly, how can I fix it?\nBackground\nIt is not any one key that sticks, I have had darn near every key stick on me so far.  So with this in mind, I do not believe it is a problem with any one key.  Also, the only time it does this is when the laptop gets hot (running Win 7 + charging = 3rd degree burns).  I just starting using MacFan and so far I like it quite a bit; it is very similar to SMC Fan control for OS X.\nIn addition to the keys sticking at times, the track pad becomes much less sensitive and gestures do not work.  I wish I could say that I only had these issues when I was on Windows 7, but I have had some of these same issues on the Mac side.\nSystem Info\nHardware:\nMBP Early 2008\nRAM Upgraded to 4g\nHDD Upgraded to 500g 7200 rpm  \nOS:\nOS X 10.6.8\nWindows 7 Pro (bootcamp & parallels 6)\nEDIT\n1) The keys do not physically stick down.  They pop back up immediately.\n2) On the left side of the display, roughly 1\" on the bottom and tappers away to 1/4\" on top, is washed out as well.  It seems to get less severe when I turn the back-light all the way up, but I'm fairly sure that's not best thing to do for for it.  Up until now I thought the keyboard/track pad issues were separate from the display, but based on macaco's answer it makes me wonder: Could these issues be related?  \nUPDATE\nI was able to secure a new laptop for work and have somewhat retired the worn-out MBP.  Thanks for all your help!\n\nA: I suspect that this is the topcase module malfunctioning.\nHowever, a good troubleshooting step would be to connect a USB keyboard & mouse and see if the issue continues with those external devices once the problem manifests.\nThis will allow you to ascertain if the topcase is at fault and/or if the issue is software based (although it seems to be hardware as you're seeing similar/related issues in OSX and Windows).\nPast that I would take the machine to an Apple store or AASP where they can test the machine with a known good topcase/keyboard module to fully confirm that the topcase needs replacing (or anything else if the problem is deeper (read:logic board)). If that's what needs replacing then it's a relatively cheap repair.\n", "Q: Can my Mac tell jokes? Sometimes I just need a break from serious work. Can my Mac OS install tell me any jokes? \n\nA: Why yes, it can, as a matter of fact.

(Tested in Lion, although this has been around for quite some time.)\n\nA: I vaguely recall a way to see (not hear) a joke in Terminal … maybe from before Mac OS X. \nI paged through Got any tips or tricks for Terminal in Mac OS X? but can't find anything relating to jokes …\n", "Q: Why doesn't the red dot shut down the program? If I use the red dot in the upper left of the last window of a program, why doesn't it shut the program down?\nExcept for rare programs that run without windows, what's the point of keeping programs running after all their windows are shut?\n\nA: Great question. This was one of my first confusions about the Finder when switching to Mac. Here's what I think: \nOn other operating systems, the program menu is contained in the active application window. As such, each window is in essence a full instance of the program. (There's not as much integration with Windows Explorer, as there is with Finder on Mac OS. It' a tiny difference, but it really alters user experience.(My proof is the fact that you're asking this question.)\nBy contrast, on Mac OS X, the menu bar in the Finder is where all Apps' menus go. All running programs are tied to the Finder in a different way than on other operating systems. On Mac, a program may have auxiliary windows and such. In other operating systems, you generally have similar \"panels\" in their own window.\nAlso, remember that the yellow and green buttons only effect the window that they're in, so it seems odd to group a control that effects the entire app with two that only effect one window. Therefore, the \"red dot\" only affects the active window. \nOne notable exception is the Mac App Store. In that case, you are one hundred percent correct. Clicking the red dot closes the entire app. Notice how the App Store has no auxiliary menus or panes? Closing that Window does indeed mean you're exiting the app.\n\nA: Actually it is an optional method in Cocoa that a programmer has the choice of implementing or not, a method aptly named applicationWillTerminateAfterLastWindowIsClosed:. Therefore it does not depend on the OS (things are different in Lion though, not sure by how much). And it could be a required thing by Apple for apps sold through the AppStore, although I didn't have the chance to experience it myself.\nSadly it is not something that can be added afterward, and I agree for the sake of the user it would make sense to have this behavior standard across all apps except the one that are documents-based...\n\nA: Rule of thumb: If I can do something in an app without a window, it keeps running. So, I can make a new document in Word, I can open a new link in Safari etc., I can play music in iTunes... If I can't: it quits. So, iPhoto, SystemPreferences, iMovie all quit when you close the last window.\nCharacterized another way: why would you assume that just because I've finished this letter to GrandMa, and I close that window, that I am also finished with all my correspondence?\n\nA: The above says it all, but in shorter form document based applications (pages, textedit, etc) may have multiple windows for 1 application, 1 for each document you have open.  When you close a window, you close the document, not the app.  If it's the last window, it can occasionally close the app also, but this isn't common.  Also, if it's not a document based app, like the App Store etc, then the window effectively IS the app, hence closing it shuts it down.\n", "Q: I can't find otool on my jailbroken iPod From what I understand is that when you change your settings in Cydia to developer you should be able to access extra utilities. Otool being on of them.\nHowever, when I attempt to use otool it tells me that the command isn't found. So I look in my bin file and can't find it there. (i'm attempting to use it via ssh from my computer)\nCan anyone offer suggestions on where to find the tool for my ipod?\n\nA: When you change your settings to Developer in Cydia, what you are actually doing is changing the package list filter. This means that certain packages will only be shown as available to download and install in the package list according to which filter you select.\nHaving set your filter settings to 'Developer' you'll then need to find and install the package you want.\notool is included in the package called: BigBoss Recommended Tools\n\nA: If you have a mac, you could use otool there on iOS binaries, should work with ARM-based code as well. (otool is installed with Xcode's command-line tools.)\nUpdate: Based on this answer to a related question, you can now find otool in the \"Darwin CC Tools\" package from the Cydia/Telesphoreo repository. Doesn't seem to be in \"BigBoss Recommended Tools\" package anymore.\n\nA: Just install BigBoss Recommended Tools, oTool is included there.\n", "Q: AppleTV streaming from Airport Shared Disk? I'm considering purchasing an AppleTV to listen to/watch content stored locally on my network on my television and stereo. If I have my media stored on an external hard disk connected to my Airport Extreme, is there any way to stream that data to an AppleTV?\nIf I need a machine to do this, can I use a MacBook to act as a \"middleman\" of some kind between the Shared Disk and the AppleTV in this situation?\n\nA: Further to Paul's comment, if you place your iTunes library on the remote disc it will work fine, but obviously you won;t have access to it when you are on the move out of range of your home wifi.\nBut you can create multiple iTunes libraries, and have one on your macbook, and one on the remote disc.  Hold the alt/option key when starting iTunes to be presented options for creating/choosing an alternative library.\nIn order to stream from the library on the remote disc, you will need iTunes running, with the correct library selected.  You will also need Homeshare set up both in iTunes and your Apple TV.\nGood luck.\n\nA: The AppleTV will need to stream from iTunes. It can't just stream from files on a shared disk.\n\nA: \nIf I need a machine to do this, can I use a MacBook to act as a \"middleman\" of some kind between the Shared Disk and the AppleTV in this situation?\n\nExactly - you just need to put your iTunes library on the Airport disk. Here are some instructions: http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2007/03/put-your-itunes-library-on-your-airport-disk.ars\n", "Q: Which MacBook models support (directly or indirectly) dual DVI monitors, for a total of three screens? I've read through the \"Questions with similar titles\", and I don't see anything that directly answers my question.\nWhich current MacBook models (of any product line) support (directly or indirectly) attaching dual DVI monitors, for a total of three screens?\nThe monitors are third-party (Acer). By \"directly or indirectly\", I'm acknowledging that I'll likely have to buy additional cables.\n\nA: You only have two options, and they're both supported by all current MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a DVI splitter to spread a single DVI output across multiple monitors (which will look like a single external monitor to the OS). The maximum resolution for an external monitor on all MacBook Pro or Air models is 2560 x 1600, so your maximum for the split displays will be 1280 x 1600 each (or maybe 2560 x 800).\n\n*Use a USB graphics adaptor for the third monitor, which will thus not have hardware graphic acceleration.\n\n\nA: Any current MacBook Air or MacBook Pro will work. The first DVI monitor is simple; just get a Mini-Display Port to DVI cable. The second one  will require a USB to DVI adapter, like the IOGEAR USB 2.0 External DVI Video Card. The combination of these will allow you to use the two Acer monitors via DVI and the internal MacBook screen.\n\nA: As per Mike Scott's answer (specifically, point 2), an example of a USB graphics adaptor can be found here.\n", "Q: Stop SuperDrive from checking for disks after wake up I'd like to stop the SuperDrive from spinning up after coming out of sleep since the noise it makes is quite loud. The SuperDrive was 'fixed' at an authorized retailer a while back and it's made a lot of noise ever since. This is a 3 year old white MacBook, so it's out of warranty.\nIs there a way to not have it check for disks after opening the lid?\n\nA: You can disable the Superdrive if you set your account up under parental controls.\nUnder Preferences > Accounts (Users under Lion) > Enable parental controls > other > check limit cd and dvd burning \nThis should do the trick.\n", "Q: Will an iPod touch suffice for testing iOS apps? I am buying a testing device for iPhone apps. I cannot afford an iPhone 4 so I am thinking to buy an iPod touch. Can I use an iPod touch for testing iPhone apps? What will be impossible to test on an iPod touch?\nMy second thought is to buy an iPhone 3G or iPhone 3GS, but I am not sure if these devices are too old to use as testing devices. What do you think? Could I use them? Can a new system be installed on these devices (does it slow them down)?\n\nA: I wrote an extensive blog post about this topic a while ago: http://wjlafrance.net/?p=188\nBasically, an iPod touch is great as long as you don't want to use GPS-based location in your app (you can test general, wifi-based location) and are only interested in iOS 4+ deployment (or iOS 5+ if that's what your iPod is running).\n\nA: Yes it runs iPhone apps. The iPod touch fourth generation is an excellent device for testing - it's inexpensive and has most of what you need. It has the A4 processor, same as iPad or iPhone 4, retina display, gyroscope, speaker, cameras, internet connectivity etc. iOS 5 also works great on them without slowdown.\n\nA: As a registered iOS developer, I feel qualified to answer this question. First of all, an iPod touch can do everything an iPhone can, except it does not have a 3G internet connection or an internal GPS. So, to answer your question, you can test your app on an iPod touch. However, ensure that you buy a 4th generation iPod touch, because all previous models lacked a camera and a microphone. Also, if your app requires 3G connectivity you will need an iPhone.\n\nA: Yeah...you can test but when coming to native apps the ui will differ. Because iphone-6s screen size is 5.44 inches and ipod screen size is 4 inches.\nI written this answer with my experience. I tested native application in ipod its working fine in that device again I tested same app in iphone-6 at that time i found some flaws (Very minor bugs).\n", "Q: C++ application for iPad I came across an iPad2 application that allows a user to write Python programs on their iPad. \nThough this framework was only limited to Python's maths functions I was wondering if there is a similar application that will let you write C++ applications on the iPad2?\n\nA: Well, you can't compile and run apps from the iPad itself, but there are many text editors in the App Store that support what is called syntax highlighting.  You could then take these files and compile and run them on your Mac or PC.  \nThe reason you won't find apps allowing you to compile code in the App Store is because Apple forbids apps that run external code (code that wasn't bundled with the app).  I'm not quite sure how this Python app got through, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was pulled from the store at some point.  \nSome text editors that support C++ highlighting are Textastic Code Editor and CodeToGo, but you can find many by searching for \"code editor\" or \"syntax highlighting\" (without the quotes) in the App Store.  The interesting thing about CodeToGo is it will let you run your code on a remote server for free if you have an internet connection.  So, if running your code on the iPad is important, CodeToGo might be a good choice for you.\n", "Q: How can Tor Browser Bundle for OS X access my keychain? I would like Tor Browser Bundle for OS X to work with my keychain, so that after filling out logins and passwords on a website one time, I would never have to do it again later. This works with safari, but it doesn't with the Vidalia packed aurora (firefox) browser. What settings should I change?\n\nA: In short: You can't. Firefox always uses it's own store for passwords and will never access the Mac OS X keychain at all. You either have to manually copy your credentials into Torbrowser/Firefox windows or use a third party software like 1Password that integrates across browsers.\nBe aware that if you use a login on a website that hasn't been created over tor there is a good chance you're giving up your anonymity by yourself. Tor cannot protect you from posting your identity (by logging in with a username and password) by yourself!\n\nA: There is no standard way to make Firefox save passwords in OSX keychain, but nevertheless you can use Tor with browser that supports keychain. You can configure Safari or Google Chrome to use Tor.\n\n\n*\n\n*Just look how configured proxy in bundled Firefox [Firefox > Preferences > Advanced > Network > Settings]:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Configure proxy in Google Chrome the same way.\n\n\nNow you will be able to store passwords in keychain while using Chrome. \n", "Q: What could be stopping my WiFi printer from working? My iMac suddenly stopped recognising my HP OfficeJet 6500 printer over the wireless network. Previously, it worked fine for years. It works with USB, and the printer connects to the router without a problem - it just doesn't see the computer, which is also connected to the same router.\nThings I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*I upgraded the Mac to Lion (which I guess counts as a software re-install - it was previously on Snow Leopard)\n\n*I have completely reset the printing system on the Mac, and allowed it to re-find the printer and reinstall drivers.\n\n*I have reset the printer to factory defaults, and then re-connected it to the router.\n\n*I enabled Printer Sharing in System Preferences\n\n*I have installed a new router (a different brand)\n\n\nIn case it's helpful: the printer problem originally appeared to be part of a general network problem (I was also having trouble connecting to the internet and to AirPlay etc.). Replacing the router seems to have cured the rest, but the printer still didn't work - that's when I tried all the other things.\nCan anyone suggest something else for me to try?\n\nA: One more thing you could try :\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall all HP printer driver software using the HP uninstaller in Applications > Hewlett-Packard.\n\n*Reboot / restart your mac.\n\n*Reset the printing system via : Sys Prefs, Print & Fax\n\n*Right (control) click in the rectangle listing your printers and then choose Reset Printing System.\nCAUTION : The above steps will delete all of your printers.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the plus sign to re-add it. Look for the printer, select it and wait until the \"Add\" button becomes available. Click it.\n\n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How to set permissions on network interfaces? At each reboot, the permissions on the network devices /dev/bpf* are changed.\nAs a developer, I want write acccess on these files. \nThis can easily be fixed with a chmod.\nWhat is the most elegant solution to fix this issue permanently?\n\nA: Wireshark ships a StartupItem that does just that; however, the StartupItems API is deprecated:\n The SystemStarter utility is deprecated.  System services should instead\n be described by a launchd.plist(5).  See launchd(8) for more details.\n The launchd utility is available on Mac OS X 10.4 and later.\n\n In earlier versions of Mac OS X, the SystemStarter utility is used to\n start, stop, and restart the system services which are described in the\n /Library/StartupItems/ and /System/Library/StartupItems/ paths.\n\nSo, since you're asking for \"the most elegant solution\", that would be a launch daemon.\nI haven't tried the following code, but it should be roughly correct.\nCreate a file /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.stackexchange.apple.bpf-helper.plist:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.stackexchange.apple.bpf-helper</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.stackexchange.apple.bpf-helper.sh</string>\n    </array>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nAnd a file /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.stackexchange.apple.bpf-helper.sh:\n#!/bin/sh\nchgrp admin /dev/bpf*\nchmod g+rw /dev/bpf*\n\nBoth should be owned by root:wheel. The first should be 644; the second 755 (600 and 700, respectively, will probably do as well).\nYou can use launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.stackexchange.apple.bpf-helper.plist to try it without a reboot.\n", "Q: How do you access the user library on a time machine backup With Lion 10.7, how does one access the user library on a time machine backup through the Finder?\n\nA: Go to the Finder. In the menu bar, select Go, then hold down Option. Select the \"Library\" option which appears.\nThen enter Time Machine as per normal.\n\nA: If you are accessing your Time Machine Backup with \"Browse Other Backup Disks...\", like you do if you created a fresh install of your OS, the solution from dan8394 does not work.\nProbably because Time Machine can't know that your current Library folder is a newer version of the Library folder in the backup.\nHowever, the solution proposed in a question that was closed as exact duplicate of this one works.\nLri helped me a lot with this answer:\n\nThe Library folder is probably just hidden by Finder. You can show all\nhidden files by running this in Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true && osascript -e 'quit app \"Finder\"'\n\n(Note: The part after the && will cause finder to stop, and you may need to restart it. So be aware that any open Finder windows may disappear.)\nChanging true to false reverts the setting.\n\n", "Q: I'm having problems putting my iPhone 3G into DFU mode I have upgraded my iPhone 3G from iOS 3 to iOS 4.2.1 using the iclarified Redhook for windows tutorial.\nUpgrade has gone fine but I cannot get Redsn0w (v0.9.6b6) to recognise the DFU state. Every time I restart in DFU mode, I get the following error:\n\n\"No Device Detected. You probably misunderstood the instructions.\n  Please consult Google or YouTube on how to enter DFU mode\"\n\nPlease note I had problems entering DFU following the Redsn0w instructions (i.e. start from off then: hold power 2-3s, power & home 5-10s, then home 13s) as these do not work  from power off on my iphone 3g. If my iphone is off and power button or power & home button are held, iphone immediately starts in recovery mode (with icon). \nI can enter DFU (black screen) by having phone on, holding power button and slide power off on screen, I then release power button 5-6s after phone has switched off (per DFU instructions on google utube etc), phone enters DFU mode but not picked up by redsnow \nAny suggestions welcome\n\nA: To enter DFU mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the phone is on and iOS fully loaded, and iTunes is closed.\n\n*Plug the phone into your computer using the Apple proprietary cable.\n\n*Once plugged in, turn your phone off by holding the power button.\n\n*When the phone is completely powered down, perform the following\nsequence:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold the power button for 3 secs.\n\n*Without letting go of the power button, press and hold the home\nbutton for 10 secs.\n\n*Without letting go of the home button, release the power button for\nanother 10 secs.\n\n\n\nIgnore what's happening on your screen, just time the sequence. If you are not succeeding, then you are not timing the sequence properly. There is only one way to enter the device into DFU mode. The one provided by Redsn0w is the correct one.\n\nA: I know there are a lot of instructions out there on Google, but I don't think your second set of instructions are correct (at least for DFU).\nI would stick with the first set, and just keep following the instructions, even if the phone starts to boot up (which is normal). Sometimes it takes a couple of tries to get the timing right, but it will work.\n\nA: DFU Mode can be entered by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your phone is either on the home screen or starting with Apple logo.\n\n*Hold down both the home button and sleep/wake button for exactly 8 seconds\n\n*Release the sleep/wake button and continue holding the home button until your phone     enters DFU mode.\n\n\nYou can verify your iPhone is in recovery mode by going to the Apple menu>About this Mac>More Info>USB and checking the list of connected devices. You should see an Apple Mobile Device with \"DFU Mode\" in parentheses. \n\nA: Put your iPhone in DFU modus and open Redsn0w. Then hit \"next\" and disconnect the cable. Connect it again after a while and by doing so, my Redsn0w recognized my iPhone.\n\nA: I had a very similar problem today.  Turns out (source) despite asking for the newest iTunes, redsn0w is only compatible with certain (older) versions.  Download and install iTunes 12.0.1 (Windows 32-bit - Windows 64-bit - OS X).  Uninstalling newer versions might be tricky.\nEven so, despite definitely being in DFU mode (iTunes said so!), I could not get that mode to work.  But having this version of iTunes installed let me do the non-DFU mode, which did work.\n", "Q: USB Lion Recovery Disk fails to boot Per What's a reliable method to create a stand alone recovery disk for Lion?, I'm attempting to create a two-partition thumbdrive such that one of the partitions is the Recovery Disk created by Recovery Disk Assistant and the other partition enables me to use the rest of the space for storage. Since I want this storage to be Windows 7/XP-compatible, its format will be MS-DOS(FAT).\nSo far, my attempts have been thwarted.\nWhen booting my Mac with the thumbdrive inserted, I can select the drive but that only ever results in a gray screen. I have enabled FileVault 2 on this machine, if that matters.\nWhat magic do I need to get a working external Recovery Disk on my thumbdrive?\nRelated: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/21303/two-partition-thumbdrive-unrecognized-under-boot-camp-windows-7\n\nA: I have done this using the raw InstallESD.dmg image from the Mac App Store Lion installer (NOT the Recovery Disk Assistant) using the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag the InstallESD.dmg image to Disk Utility so that it appears on the side bar\n\n*Select your USB drive and partition the drive in to 2 or more GUID partitions\n\n*Once partitioning is complete, select the Restore tab\n\n*Drag that InstallESD.dmg image from the side bar to the source field\n\n*Drag the first partition from the USB drive on the side bar to the target field\n\n*Begin the restore process\n\n\nOnce finished you can leave things as they are or re-format the other partition as ExFAT or MS-DOS. However you should be aware the USB drive is GUID partitioned so only Windows 7 is likely to read it properly (I've never tried a GUID partioned USB drive on an XP system). You cannot use standard MBR partitions for the Lion Recovery Partition.\n", "Q: How can I use iMac internet in my iPod touch? I don't have a Wi-Fi connection here. Is there a way to connect to the internet from my iMac with my iPod touch?\n\nA: Yes !\nYou can share you internet connection via Wi-Fi in the \"Sharing\" preference pane of System preferences. Once activated, your iPod touch will detect a Wi-Fi network that you can join to share the internet connection of your iMac.\n(if you're on Lion, replace \"Airport\" by \"Wi-Fi\")\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System preferences\n\n*Click on \"Sharing\"\n\n*Click on \"Internet sharing\" (but don't check the checkbox yet)\n\n*Select \"Ethernet\" in the dropdown menu \"Share your connection from\"\n\n*Check \"Airport\" in the list \"via\"\n\n*Click \"Airport options\" to configure wireless network security\n\n*Check the checkbox in front of \"Internet sharing\" in the list on the left to activate it.\n\n*If Airport is turned off, it'll ask you if it can turn it on, say yes.\n\n*Connect to the created network with you iPod touch as you would do for any wireless network.\n\n", "Q: Incorrect Date and Time in Max OS Lion upon reboot When I boot the Lion OS the date setting is correct but the time is not. \nThe way I correct this is by selecting 'Open Date and Time Preferences', check the 'Set Date and Time Automatically' checkbox and select my region. The correct date and time is set.\nThe only problem is that when I restart my Mac the time setting has changed and is incorrect again, even through my region is still selected. I repeat the process above upon each reboot to rectify.\nI reboot often as I am using Bootcamp 3.2 to run Windows 7.\nDoes anyone know why the time is changing and how I can fix the problem permanently?\n\nA: Yes, Windows and Mac OS calculate time in a different way, and so clash when dual-booting. The bootcamp drivers should include a little file called Appletime.exe which is supposed to fix any time sync issues between Windows and Mac OS. \nIf this file is not present or not running, you can manually install it from here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Desktop-Enhancements/Clocks-Time-Management/AppleTimeFix.shtml \n\nA: Windows and OS X calculate the time from the system time differently, which leads to discrepancy when you switch between them. \nIf the Boot Camp drivers aren't taking care of the problem, it is possible to fix by adding a registry key instead.\n", "Q: I'm getting lots of Samba \"too many open files\" errors. How can I troubleshoot? I'm using Mac OS X Snow Leapord. My iMac's hard drive has been getting unexpectedly full, and I finally tracked the problem down to a huge file: private/var/log/samba/log.smbd.old, weighing in at 400GB.\nI just ran tail -100 log.smbd.old to see the last 100 lines of that log file. What I see is a ton of \"too many open files\" errors.\nThis is a work machine. I do share files with other Mac users, and also access a shared Windows drive via Samba.\nHow can I troubleshoot these errors so the log file doesn't get filled with them? \n\nA: Now I'm no kernel expert, but I think that you might be running into the fact that the default value for the maxflies kernel parameter is 256.  You can show your current value for this parameter like this:\n[dwayne | ~] $ launchctl limit maxfiles\n    maxfiles    256            unlimited \n\nI think if you put a line similar to this in a file /etc/launchd.conf (you might have to create the file if it doesn't already exist):\nlimit maxfiles 2048 unlimited\n\nand reboot, you will see the new value, and hopefully avoid the situation you're running into.\nDwayne\n\nA: Download an editor like TextWrangler or use PICO.\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit the Samba config file:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the file below and save it somewhere else BEFORE editing it. Drop it back into the folder if you have any problems after doing this.\n\n*Open /private/etc/smb.conf in the editor.\n\n*Add the following line to the file (do man smb.conf to see \nmax log size = (number in kb) so 5 MB would be 5000 \nmax log size = 5000\n\n\n*save file (enter admin password) and exit editor.\n\n\n*Delete old log files:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete log files in /private/var/log/samba/ (back them up before deleting as with file above):  \n\n\n*Reboot.\n\nA: To troubleshoot \"too many open files\" error, compare number of open files (kern.num_files) with number of maximum files set by kernel (kern.maxfiles) by the following command:\n$ sysctl -a | grep files:\nkern.maxfiles: 10240\nkern.num_files: 8701\n\nIf your num_files is close to maxfiles, increase the maximum files by:\nsudo sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=20480\n\nIf the limits are related to your shell resources, use ulimit command instead.\nFor further information, see: Which command controls the open file limits?\n", "Q: Key Remapping on Logitech K750 \nPossible Duplicate:\nPermanently swapping option and command keys on a non-Apple keyboard \n\nI have a Logitec K750 and it has the left Alt key closer to the space bar than the Windows Key (to be used as Command Key).  How can I remap the keys on JUST my Logitech keyboard and NOT on my built-in MacBook keyboard so that the Left Alt key functions like the Command Key, and the Left Command Key functions like the Left Alt key?  Is there a way to do this without having any apps running in the background, like some kind of key-map file I can edit rather than using a tool to do it? I'm a real resource-conscious user and don't want anything running in the background.\nThanks!\n\nA: Possible duplicate of this answered question.\nThe solution seems to remap all keyboards with KeyRemap4MacBook and then remap just the internal keyboard with standard keyboard preferences pane.

How can I set a Magic Trackpad (or, any other bluetooth device, I guess) into discovery mode, if it has already been paired to another mac?\nAnything I find on google just mocks me.\n\nA: For the Magic Keyboard 2 (squarish, slider switch instead of power button)\nHold Command+W while powering on.\nThanks to TomOSeven!\nNote that this sometimes helps but is definitely not foolproof. If there’s a device nearby that still thinks it’s paired to the keyboard, that device can still grab the keyboard pairing whether you hold down ⌘+W or not. For a mac, plugging in the keyboard with the USB cable should automatically setup pairing, but sadly that doesn’t work with an iPad.\nIf anyone finds a more reliable method, please comment.\nFor the original Magic Trackpad / Magic Keyboard (rounded with power button)\nFollow these instructions:\n\n*\n\n*Turn off the trackpad by holding down the power button until the light goes out.\n\n*Turn on the trackpad by pressing the power button, and keep the power button pressed until it is paired. The light on the mouse will start blinking, it will show up in Bluetooth Preferences, and you will be able to pair it almost immediately so long as you  do not let go of the power button from the moment of turning it on until after the trackpad is paired.\n\nA: Regarding the Magic Mouse you can kick it into discovery mode by holding down the mouse button, switch the mouse on, keep on holding the mouse button until the green light starts blinking!\n\nA: (I took the Magic Trackpad for example, but it applies to Apple Bluetooth keyboard and Magic Mouse as well)\nWhen you start a Magic Trackpad, it announces itself over bluetooth :\n\n\n*\n\n*If a Mac \"hear\" it and is paired with it, they connect each other and you can't use the Magic Trackpad with another Mac.\n\n*If no previously paired Mac are near the Magic Trackpad, it will be available to a new pairing.\n\n\nSo, one Magic Trackpad can be paired to multiple computers. When you start it, the first computer to connect to it gets it (first arrived, first served).\nIf you have two Macs next to each other (A & B), your Magic Trackpad paired to A and you want to pair it with B, you have four choices :\n\n\n*\n\n*Unpair your Magic Trackpad from A\n\n*Disable bluetooth on A (this can be painful if you only have bluetooth input devices for A)\n\n*Take A or B far (±10 meters) from the other. Stop your Magic Trackpad and start it again near B.\n\n*Shutdown A\nOnce done, you can start a new pairing procedure on B.\nI hope it answers your question.\n\n(you can also stop and start again your Magic Trackpad while detecting new bluetooth devices on B and hope B will find it faster than A, but you'll probably need to make that several times before getting it to work)\n\nA: MAGIC MOUSE 2 HAS A DISCOVERY MODE\nHere's how you do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*turn the mouse off\n\n*press the click button and hold it pressed\n\n*turn on the mouse\n\n*go to mouse utility on the mac and search for a mouse. you will find it\n\n*connect to the mouse\n\n*release the click button\n\n\nA: The other answers apply to the original Magic Mouse. However, the Magic Mouse 2 (with the Lightning port for charging) does not have a green light or pairing mode. To pair an already-paired Magic Mouse 2, you will need to plug the mouse into the Lighting-to-USB cable and connect directly to the Mac.\n(TIL that the connection must be DIRECTLY to the Mac and not via a hub such as a Thunderbolt Display.)\n\nA: I don't think the magic trackpad (or the magic mouse) have a \"discovery mode.\" Just make sure the bluetooth on the Mac it was previously paired to is off, then go about connecting it to the new Mac as normal.\nApple's support page on this\n\nA: I just did this.  You put your trackpad or keyboard into discovery mode by holding the power key until the green light is blinking.  The mac mini recognizes the trackpad almost immediately, and then walks you through the process of connecting your keyboard.  Keyboard does not need to be in discovery mode, only needs to be powered on.\nTook 2 min, very simple.

All of them are part of an xml (plist) file located at http://ax.init.itunes.apple.com/bag.xml?ix=2.\nThere's no POST data, just some cookies and HTTP headers giving information about the device and the context. These informations are part of many request made to Apple servers by iOS.\nI have no idea what this \"bag\" can be nor what it's used for.\nDetails\nHere's the request headers :\nUser-Agent : iTunes-iPhone/4.3.4 (4; 32GB)\nAccept-Language : fr;q=1.0,en;q=1.0[...]\nX-Apple-Store-Front : [cut]\nX-Apple-Connection-Type : WiFi\nX-Apple-Cuid : [cut]\nX-Apple-Software-Cuid : [cut]\nX-Dsid : [cut]\nX-Apple-Client-Application : MediaPlayer\nX-Apple-Client-Versions : iBooks/1.3\n\nThe cookies names :\nmz_at1\ns_vi\ndssid2\nmz_pc\nmz_at0\nds01_a\nPod\ns_vnum_us\ns_vnum_befr\nmz_if\nmz_pt\na\ns_vnum_fr\ns_cvp35b\n\nAnd the XML scheme :\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\"> \n    <dict> \n        <key>signature</key>\n        <data>[encrypted string]</data> \n        <key>certs</key> \n        <array> \n            <data>[encrypted string]</data> \n        </array> \n        <key>bag</key>\n        <data>[VERY long encrypted string]</data> \n    </dict> \n</plist>\n\nThe \"certs\" part seems to be constant, even with a standard browser and none of the special HTTP headers or cookies.\n(I don't want to publish too many details as I don't know what they contain about me or my Apple ID.)\n\nA: It's probably searching for local shares.  In the latest versions of iOS, the iPhone has gained support for Home Sharing with iTunes.  So, when you launch the iPod app, it's searching to see if there are any available network shares to stream music and video files from.  \n\nA: If you still see the thumbs up and speech bubble in the iPod app's UI while playing the song, it's talking to Ping in the background. Those icons are only visible if the app knows the song is in the iTunes catalog.\nAssuming I'm right so far, it's asking Apple's infrastructure whether it should show the Ping UI for a particular song.\n", "Q: Mail.app - keyboard shortcuts to move mail and jump to folder I'm coming to Mail.app with a background using both Outlook (on the PC) and GMail. In every mail client I've used, there are easy keyboard shortcuts to do these:\n\n\n*\n\n*jump to any folder I want, just by typing a substring of it in an easy to launch dialogue\n\n*move currently selected message(s) with a similar dialogue\n\n\nIn Gmail, for example, which has labels, I can easily move and archive something (\"l\" to label it, then \"e\" to archive it), and I can easily jump to any label (\"g\" then \"l\"). In Outlook I hit ctrl-Y and then type a folder to jump; Ctrl-Shift-V to move things.\nI'm happy with Lion so far, but do I really have to spend all this time dragging messages around to folders with the trackpad and clicking folders when I want to look in them? I've never been slower with a mail client.\nI'm aware from some Googling that I can assign dedicated keyboard shortcuts to every single folder on a case-by-case basis (for moving not jumping), but that seems like a lot of effort, hard to organize (I want to type the folder I want, not memorize 30 different keyboard shortcuts) and not very flexible.\nAm I missing an undocumented feature here?\n\nA: MailActOn is an extension that provides fast filing of email messages in Mail.app. It is a paid extension though, but I find the $24.95 price tag reasonable for the productivity gains. \n\nA: A combination of some judicious AppleScript and a good utility to trigger scripts with a keystroke will do the trick, if all else fails.\n\nA: To do this, you need to display the Favorites Bar, which you can enable by going to Mail » View » Show Favorites Bar.\nYou can add any folder to this bar, which you can then easily switch to with Command1, Command2, etc.\nCtrlCommand1 moves the currently selected email(s) to the respective folder.\n\nA: Try MsgFiler ($9.99) from the AppStore.\n\nA: I just recently was forced to switch to Apple Mail and I encountered the same issues, namely lacking a simple keyboard method to move mail from one folder to another without lifting my hands off the keyboard. I found the answer by using Keyboard Maestro (although any keyboard macro program will work) to create a \"select or show a menu item\" action that selects the the menu item \"Message/Move To.\" This works very well and is simple to implement. Once the menu item is actuated, you just start typing the folder name you want until the folder you want is highlighted and then you press return/enter to move the originally selected mail items or items.\n\nIf you have nested folders, you will need to open them up in Mail (i.e., click the triangles to the left of the parent folders) otherwise the command won't reveal the nested folders (unless you actually click on them, which I don't want to do). In practice, having this long list of folders open in mail is irrelevant because you're not going to have to drag and drop any folders into the list with your mouse, you do it from the keyboard.  \n\nA: Here is a shortcut that you can use easily as described by Philip Mat, No needs of any app, it is built in Mail using the help shortcut.\nhttp://philipm.at/2011/mail_quickly_file.html\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Press Cmd-? or Cmd-Shift-/ to access the Help > Search menu.\n  \n*Type in the name of your folder.\n  \n*Press arrow down once for Move To or twice for Copy To and hit return.\n  \n\n\nA: My understanding is that keyboard shortcuts for moving messages to specific folders relate to those which already are on the bookmark bar or which you have added to it.\nThe keyboard sequence is Command-Control-BookmarkNumber (the number arrived at by counting from left to right on the bookmark bar).\n\nA: Using Shift-command-? opens a drop down box.  Then you type the first few letters of the folder name and return and the email is transferred.  Ba Da Boom!\n\nA: As @Vincent mentioned built-in keyboard shortcuts exist:\nTo move or copy an item to a mailbox folder:\n\n*\n\n*Press Cmd-? or Cmd-Shift-/ to access the Help > Search menu.\n\n*Type in the name of your folder.\n\n*Press arrow down once for Move To or twice for Copy To and hit return.\n\nWhat @Vincent didn't mention was how to jump to a folder.\nTo jump to a folder or highlight matching folders:\n\n*\n\n*Press Cmd-Option-F to access Mailbox Search (Edit > Finder > Mailbox Search)\n\n*Type in the name of the folder (at least 4 characters for mailboxes that are more 4 or more characters long; otherwise they don't show as matches)\n\n*Press Cmd-down arrow to jump down category matches found quickly (e.g., People, Messages, Mailboxes, Attachments)\n\n*Press down/up arrow (if necessary) to select an item within a category\n\n*Press return to perform the action\n\n\nA: I've been a power Gmail user for years, and I like the new version of Mail.app a lot.  \nHowever, I've since found Sparrow, which is now my favorite email client on Mac.  It has a similar (and easier) set of shortcuts like Gmail (although you can elect to use Gmail's).\nFor $10 US, the app is one that I'm recommending to a lot of friends.  It's also integrated with Shortmail, which I'm enjoying.\nGood luck,\nTom\n\nA: Vincents answer is helpful and was unknown to me. I also was looking for an answer and found this to be helpful for me:\nAdd a move-to button to the mail-app tool bar by right clicking in the toolbar area and selecting \"customize toolbar\".\neasy :)\n", "Q: Redundancy/RAID on Airport Shared Disk? I'd like to use a shared drive on my Airport as a central location for all of my media. But, I'd like to not place all my important data on a single drive if I can avoid it. Is there any way to build in some kind of redundancy or RAID as a kind of wannabe SAN into something Airport will allow me to share as a single disk, on the cheap/free?\n\nA: According to this Apple support article:\n\nThe AirPort Extreme (802.11n) and Time Capsule work with most disks\n  that are not software RAID volumes (no more than one volume per\n  physical disk). If the disk is a self-contained RAID that presents\n  itself to a computer as a single volume requiring no software support,\n  then it may be supported.\n\nSo it would appear that you need something that could be connected to the Airport Extreme that does its own RAID. Perhaps something like the Netgear ReadyNAS Duo, if you want to get a ready-made solution. You can also buy NAS enclosures with two or more bays, a couple of bare drives, and roll your own. Note that you would typically connect your NAS to the Airport via Ethernet (though some NAS enclosures allow you to connect via USB, which was your original plan), but since the limiting speed is the Airport wireless speed, I don't think that would be a problem.\n", "Q: Clearing local storage in safari on iPad I need to clear the local storage for safari on my iPad, what I found by googling says to go to Settings > Safari > Databases  but databases is no where to be found in my safari settings.  The screenshots show it right below accept cookies but it's not there or anywhere else on the page (or sub pages).  Any ideas?\n\nA: When no database exists, the Database Menu isn't shown ;)\nTry log in your google account or other webapp that uses localStorage to see it...\nOr create a HTML file with a script tag containing (on same domain obviously) :\nlocalStorage.clear();\n\n\nA: I ran into a similar problem myself - I knew that there were databases on my phone, but there was no \"Databases\" panel under \"Settings > Safari\". (Which sounds like the exact problem you were having...)\nSo, I completely powered off my phone (hold down the sleep button for about 15 seconds, until you see the RED \"Slide to power off\" button. Give the phone about 30 seconds, then power it back on by holding down the sleep button again for about 10 seconds).\nWhen the phone started back up, \"Databases\" was now visible under \"Settings > Safari.\"\nFrom there, you can \"swipe\" to delete any databases you don't want.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Its not database.  To clear localStorage you need to select the Clear Cookies and Data option.\nSettings->Safari->Clear Cookies and Data\nPS: All your cookies and session/location storage will be cleared.  Unlike desktop version, you don't have to options to select and clear\n", "Q: Configuring sshd on OS X Lion I'm trying to set up some (rudimentary) ssh security on my workstation behind a router on a home network. It's running Mac OS X Lion (10.7).\nAs I understand it, what one would normally do under such circumstances is change the appropriate parts of an /etc/sshd_config file. For example, I might have\n# akil@computerA:/etc/sshd_config\nPort 12345\nProtocol 2\nPermitRootLogin no\nPasswordAuthentication no\n\nAnd this would, respectively only listen on port 12345, accept authentication method \"2\" only, disallow root logins, and only allow key logins. I would then restart the ssh daemon and then everything would be great.\nApparently this worked Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6), but it does not seem to work for Lion. Lion seems to ignore anything in the sshd_config file. \nFor changing the port, you can follow the advice of some blogs and forums posts (1,2) that direct you to change (a) add a new ssh service by editing /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist and (b) defining the port of the new service in /etc/services. \nThis works -- doing ssh akil@computerA.local refuses the connection, but now ssh akil@computerA.local -p 12345 works fine.\nThe problem is that I have no idea how to use similar steps to change anything else: how do I disable root logins and/or password authentications?\n1: Changing sshd port on Lion\n2: Changing sshd port on OS X 10.4\n\nA: You cannot change the port sshd listens to by changing it in sshd_config since sshd is not yet running when the connection comes in. sshd is instantly launched by launched when a connection arrives. So you need to change the port in the appropriate launched item, or create another one to have a second port listening for incoming ssh connections.\nYou can find the correct file in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist\nCopy that to /Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh-alternative.plist and change the following part:\n            <key>Listeners</key>\n            <dict>\n                    <key>SockServiceName</key>\n                    <string>ssh-alt</string>\n            </dict>\n\nNotice that the SockServiceName has been changed from ssh to ssh-alt.\nTo make it work you need to add a service named ssh-alt to /etc/services\nFor example like this (to match your example) add this line:\nssh-alt         12345/tcp   # ssh-alt\nYou can then load your new ssh-alternative config with\nsudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh-alt.plist\nIf you're running ipfw make sure to allow tcp connections to the new port. The Sharing.PrefPanel will only allow you to turn on and of the standard port 22 listening sshd (Unless you change ssh in /etc/services which I do not recommend).\nIn addition you can prevent this service to be advertised by Bonjour by removing the corresponding part from the launched item.\n        <key>Bonjour</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>ssh</string>\n            <string>sftp-ssh</string>\n        </array>\n\nIf this was already running you need to unload and load the item again.\n\nA: As for the port, I've always found it easier to remap it in my router than in OS X.  That's not always possible, but if your router supports it, it's trivial.\nAs for authentication, sshd is reading the configuration file, there's just more than one kind of mechanism being used.  In your case, in addition to setting PasswordAuthentication you need to set ChallengeResponseAuthentication to 'no'.\n", "Q: Restoring a Snow Leopard time capsule using Leopard DVD boot? possible? So I have a time capsule of a few machines.\nThe one i did last (Snow Leopard) doesn't seem to be showing in the list.\nI don't have a snow leopard DVD boot handy only Leopard.\nIs this why this isn't in the list?\n\nA: Yes - I'm afraid this is the case. You will need to find a Snow Leopard DVD or Lion recovery HD/USB to restore your files.\nSince this DVD used to come with all Macs, you should be able to find a friend who has one. Otherwise, try the Apple store or AppleCare to order a replacement Snow Leopard DVD. \n", "Q: iPhone 4 regularly using its 3G connection too much I have recently started using my iPhone near a stereo set which picks up the radio signals from calls and 3G connections, making me very aware of when the phone emits anything.\nThe phone currently makes about 10-20 \"wakeups\" per minute, which is enough to make me place it a couple of meters away so the speakers won't pick up anything. Though this is annoying in itself, I'm more concerned about if this is normal for an iPhone. I'm always connected to a WiFi router, so if it's an app trying to get Internet access – it's doing it wrong. Each wakeup lasts for about one second but sometimes (far less often) it blasts away for two or three seconds.\nIs there anything I can do to find out what's causing the activity? I don't really want to uninstall my apps one by one to find the possible villain.\nEdit: To clarify, I simply want to know why it's using the 3G/EDGE connection when it really should be using the WiFi.\n\nA: I find that an Edge connection is much NOISIER in terms of what electronics pick up than 3g is. BTW, a low or intermittently low signal condition is liable to eat battery. When the phone tries to regain signal, it steps the antenna up to higher power. If it's doing that over and over, it can be costly to battery levels.\n\nA: I doubt very much that the speaker interference is being caused by the iphone's wireless being constantly on, but that's extremely easy to test.\nJust turn off your wireless and leave your iphone next to the speakers.\nIf (as I suspect) you still get the speaker interference issue, then it's quite possible that you happen to be in an area where 2 or more 3g booster towers happen to \"overlap\" with their pattern of 3g blanket coverage.\nYour phone may constantly be switching from 2 or more possible 3g signal sources, which would cause exactly that type of interference and constant polling to occur.\nThis same type of issue can occur if you are on the edge of a 3g signal, and the phone will constantly try to re-acquire a stronger signal.\nThis will also tend to suck your battery charge dry, since the phone is spending a lot more time \"awake\" than it should.\nThe only real fix is to either move to a different location (move house), or just to turn of 3g and switch your phone back to using edge in that location.\n\nA: Another thing to take into consideration, is that wether you are on EDGE or 3G the iPhone will be emitting frequencies on its own regardless of activity from any of your apps. The phone checks online automatically for clock syncs and many other things. This is why smart phone data packages are highly recommended, because if you don't have one and don't even use the internet on your phone you will still receive overages due to your phone using data for you. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: What does iPhone new contacts \"outside of specific account\" mean? In iPhone Settings -> Mail, Contacts, Calendars -> Contacts, there is a message:\n\n\nNew contacts created outside of a specific account will be added to this account.\n\n\nWhat does that specific account referring to?\n\n\nA: This happens if you also have your iPhone setup to sync to outlook via a microsoft exchange server.\nThe key here is to setup your \"default account\" to also work the same way when you are manually adding contacts to your iPhone.\nUnder Settings -> Mail, Contacts, Calendars -> Contacts -> Default Account you can select an account to have your contacts created in when you create a new contact.\n\"outside of a specific account\" refers to your exchange account setup.\nIf you have any issues where contacts created on your iPhone don't sync correctly with your exchange account then you should change the default account to point to your exchange account.\nmore info and discussion about this (as well as potential sync issues with exchange server) can be found here.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: how do i make iphone sync all contacts from Google Contacts into IPhone? http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Google%20Mobile/thread?tid=1b27fcd343e0544a&hl=en (rephrased):\n\nif you want to sync google contacts with iphone over the air using\n  google sync, you can... sync all contacts... this way you can leave\n  your already existing contacts on iphone and sync all google contacts\n  (remember that every email which contact you except spam is put into\n  all contacts... this means veeeery lot of contacts and some people\n  find this very frustrating)\n\nOk it basically claims that we can sync All Contacts (all people we have ever contacted) to our IPhone over the air.\nBut right now my IPhone is syncing only My Contacts group and is not syncing anything outside that group. How do I make it sync All Contacts ?\n\nA: I don't know how to get the phone to sync with a different group than My Contacts, or to sync all the contacts, but as long as you aren't using My Contacts for filing now, then you can have every contact in two groups - \"My Contacts\" for syncing and your chosen group for filing and organization.\nYou can do this without destroying the rest of your sorting scheme by selecting all contacts in each group in Google Contacts, opening the Groups menu, clicking the checkbox next to My Contacts until it shows up as a solid check mark (not a slash), and then clicking \"apply\" in the same menu. By selecting the checkbox instead of the name and using Apply, you are telling the UI to add them to My Contacts without moving them; this is a standard bit of Google UI style.\n", "Q: Lion Mail: Drag to Select vs. Drag to Move I'm using Mail in Lion in three-pane full screen mode. Let's say I put my pointer over a message in the middle pane. I push the touchpad with my thumb to click and hold, and start to move the pointer with my index finger in the direction of the new folder where I want to file the message. Mail does one of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Begin to highlight a range of messages, or\n\n*Begin to move the selected message to another folder.\n\n\nI can never tell which one I'm going to get. I almost always want (2), but maddeningly often I get (1). What am I doing to cause the ambiguity? How do I clearly signal my intent to the UI?\n\nA: Selecting happens when you start dragging in the empty part of a line and have a major vertical movement. You can prevent message moving from happening by immediately starting to drag across after clicking.\nMoving happens when you start in the text part of a line. Moving is also easier invoked when your major movement is in the horizontal axis. If you click and hold on a spot for a moment and then start dragging message moving will be invoked.\n\nA: You should see an icon of a small envelope appear under the pointer when you hold your thumb down (and the icon changes to include a count when more than one message – or a conversation – is selected). Once that is there, and ensuring that your thumb remains held down, the drag with your index finger should be unambiguous.\n\nA: One trick I use is to click and drag to the right - over the viewing pane - and on to the target folder. This always results in the move rather than the select option.\n\nA: right area to drag message, everywhere else to select messages. see here \nEDIT: sorry for the NSFW link.

In iTunes they are correct, but on the phone they are suddenly mixed up. Album A gets the art from album K, and album C from album G, and by luck album E has the right one... very annoying. I can \"fix\" it by resyncing everything (don't sync, apply, sync, apply), but I'm getting really tired of that.\nDoes anyone else experience this? Why does it happen? Anything I can do to fix it more permanently? Does Apple know about this?\n\nA: This is a problem that's caused many people head aches, and also seems to occur on iPhone 3gs models.\nFor more detail on what fixes have been attempted, you can read this Apple discussions thread on this issue.\nThere was a discussion thread I read a few months ago (which I can't seem to find) where multiple people reported a success at fixing the issue by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unsync all music and playlists on the iPhone\n\n*Click on the Apply / Sync button in iTunes\n\n*Shutdown / reboot the iPhone\n\n*Connect to iTunes and once again do a (blank playlist) second sync with iTunes clicking on the Apply / Sync button.\n\n*Add back playlists and re-sync with iTunes.\n\n\nA: I'm using Iphone5 and noticed that my artwork in my music files changed after downloading the latest operating system from Apple in my IPhone. When looking through the music albums not all of them was different but several Artwork covers changed.   \nI searched the Internet and found no answers for why this is happening. It is correct in ITunes music library but when synced to my phone several of them change. After beating my head awhile trying to correct it in ITunes I found the problem is in setting in the iPhone.   \nIf you go to your phone setting and then in Music, turn off (Group By Album Artist) then all of my art work returned to what it should look like without doing any other steps in my phone or ITunes. \n", "Q: How to undelete notes on iPhone \"Notes\" app? iPhone has a default \"Notes\" app which allows us to store notes. Stored notes can be deleted by hitting the \"Delete Note\" button:\n\nHow do we recover a note that is accidentally deleted?\nIs there anyway to undo the delete?\n\nA: There is a way to undo the delete.  You just have to shake your iphone, and this will activate the \"undo\" feature which seems to have been forgotten by most people (it was a feature of an iOS update a few revisions back around 2009).\nIn case you think I am kidding, click here.\n\nA: Apple solved this issue with an upgrade to iCloud and notes.app\nThere is now a deleted items folder that you can access on iOS within the notes app. \n\nJust head to the Recently Deleted folder to recover your deleted work.\n\nA: If you have an iTunes backup, you can browse it with Doctor Telephone and maybe recover notes iphone again.\nThe linked app works only for Mac, but here's two alternatives (not tested) :\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone backup extractor which is a paid multiplatform app\n\n*iphonebackupbrowser which is less polished and windows only, but free.\n\n\nA: If you sync your notes with Google, try looking for them in your Gmail's trash folder!\n", "Q: Two key combos for Enclosing Folder, but same result While exploring the effect of different keys on menus in Finder in Lion, I spotted what seems like a redundancy in the case of the Go menu.\nWhen pressing the ⌥ key while the menu is open, not only is the user Library added to the menu list, but the key combination for Enclosing Folder changes from ⌘↑ to ⌥⌘↑. The additional modifier appears to be redundant, since the same enclosing folder opens with both key combinations.\n\n\nAt first I thought this was Lion-specific, so was surprised to notice that this also applies in Snow Leopard.\nCan others confirm that they too experience this behaviour and, if so, explain why the two combinations exist?\n\nA: In Lion and Snow Leopard, the option/alt key makes a subtle change:\n\n\n*\n\n*⌘+▲ reuses the existing finder window (preserving sort, view and size of the child folder).\n\n*⌥+⌘+▲ opens a new finder window with the saved settings for that parent folder (closing the child folder)\n\n", "Q: Is there a keyboard shortcut to jump directly to a particular full screen app in Lion? When you full screen an application in Lion, it \"flies out\" of the desktop space it started in, and winds up at the end of the spaces list (assuming you have turned off auto-arranging).\nAs a result if the app being pulled out of the spaces flow, there is no way to ctrl+1/2/3etc to jump to the space it is currently occupying.\nDoes anyone know how you can make a keyboard shortcut so you can jump directly to full screened apps?\n\nA: If you want this for a specific app, you could use an application like Keyboard Maestro to set up a shortcut to switch to that application.\nIf you want this for every app, I don't think it is possible at the moment. It may come with an update (as the ability to manually re-arrange spaces in Mission Control).\nWaiting for a better solution, you can still use ⌃→ and ⌃← to navigate between spaces (including fullscreen applications).\n\nA: You can always just use Command-Tab switching, holding tab for the appropriate length of time to reach the app you'd like to switch to.\nThis sadly works less well with apps that can own multiple full screen spaces, or which can exist as both a full screen window, and another separate window on another desktop.\n\nA: I had problems with this also and found a solution.\nI assume that almost all of you realizes immediately what this is about. So the\nShort answer: Install better touch tool and define a gesture from predefined action called \"send keyboard shortcut to specific application\".\nLong answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install bettertouch tool (http://blog.boastr.net/) and open it.\n\n*Define the gesture for global. From the top you can define in which way you want to input the action. I used trackpad input, but this works almost in same way for other inputs also.\n\n*From down-right corner click \"add new gesture\". Choose a gesture you like under \"touchpad gesture\". Then choose predefined action from right and select \"Send keyboard shortcut to specific application\". You can leave the command field empty and just choose the application. Be sure to select the \"bring app to front before..\"-option.\n\n*You are done.\n(5. example) I have defined four finger swipes to switch between spaces. I switch between spotify and chrome a lot. So I defined two finger swipes from left and right edges to jump to chrome and spotify. For spotify I defined also shortcut \"alt+cmd+F\" so it jumps directly to search field when I do the swipe.\nJust realized this so I bet that other awesome actions could be done through this also. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: How can I recover 'iTunes Library (Damaged)'? My iTunes library has disappeared and looking in the Music/iTunes folder, I see an 'iTunes Library (Damaged)' file. All of the music appears to still be there, so I am guessing it is just the database that is damaged. Is there a way to recover the library, like from the xml file? There is also a folder with Previous iTunes Libraries that are a couple months old. Can I just copy and rename one of those files?\n\nA: Apple's documentation on recreating your iTunes library if it is corrupt:\niTunes: How to re-create your iTunes library and playlists\nLast Modified: April 07, 2011\n\nA: I just copied one of the backup files from the 'Previous iTunes Libraries' folders and renamed it to iTunes Library which was quick and easy. I imagine the effectiveness of this solution depends on how old these files are as they are meant to be a backup for upgrading iTunes rather than a timely backup. It worked well for me though and I didn't have to re-create playlists or download album artwork.\n", "Q: Why do I not have sufficient permissions to restore my Library folder? My machine with Lion installed failed to wake from sleep the other day, and all sorts of nastiness was in evidence after a power-button shutdown and restart.\nNot to worry, I thought, I'll use Time Machine (TM) to restore my Library folder to its pre-problem state and perhaps that will solve the problems. This seemed like a good idea, but TM refused to cooperate, informing me that the operation could not be completed because I did not have sufficient permissions to change my Library folder.\nHow could this be, since I operate with an Administrator account?\n(As to restoring the machine to normality, it took two restarts into Safe mode to sort things out, at least to an acceptable extent — I've had to re-enter license details in several apps when they re-launched afterwards, and almost all my preferences had reverted to their default state.)\n\nA: Library like many of the folders that exist in the root of your home folder have special permissions. I have better luck selecting all inside the folder, trashing them, then restoring all in place. \nWorking inside the folder is less error prone than trying to change the folder itself. \n\nA: I do not know a definitive answer but this is undoubtedly related to the fact that in Lion, the user Library folder is hidden.\nI have permanently un-hidden the User/Library folder by typing\n\nchflags nohidden ~/Library/\n\nin Terminal.\nBut I don't know if that would help your permissions problem.\nAt the very least, run Disk Utility and repair permissions on your drive, and then try to do the restore again.\n", "Q: Apple charger port magnet has lost it's pull  My friends laptop was dropped and fell directly on the power charging connector as it was connected to the charger.  Now the port still works, but the strength of the magnet that holds the connector is very weak, as if it has lost some of its magnetism.  That sounds pretty ridiculous of course, so I'm wondering if it's possible that the force of the drop dislodged the magnet so it is no longer close to the surface?  There is still some \"pull in\", but so little that the slightest tug on the cable pulls it off.  I've never seen the inside to know what the magnet looks like.  Is my theory plausible?  Any remedies short of opening the case?\n\nA: That internal MagSafe port is fairly inexpensive and rapid to exchange. The likelihood is that either part of the internal magnet has shifted or the entire unit has moved internally.\nIf the magnets inside are loose they could short a more expensive part or be a fire hazard. Best to get it in the shop. \nThe strong rare earth magnets won't demagnetize from a physical shock so it's likely there is internal dislocation or damage. \n\nA: I believe the problem may be with the charger cord, not the computer.  I had an unfortunate accident and had to replace my macbook air after only 5 months.  I did not even unpack the new charger, thinking the new one would be a backup.  Good thing!  6 months later I started experiencing disconnects between the computer and the power cord because the magnet had seemed to weaken.  Sure enough, I unpacked that brand new charging cord and the magnet works again-- very strong!\n\nA: Crud. That's the answer. A small piece of anything will interfere with the connection enough to make the connection weak. Look in the port on the MacBook and pick out anything that doesn't belong. I found a minuscule piece of metal something, smaller than a sand grain, which was causing my charger wire to be loose, breaking the connection. Clean it out, no crud, tight hookup.\n\nA: Magnets will lose their magnetic force when struck with a great force on contrast to it's size. \nDropping a magnet around 5 times will start to weaken it's pull while if you spike it (throw it on the ground with all the force you can muster) it will lose it's magnetic force completely. \nYou can restrengthen magnets by rubbing it between 2 other magnets but that's not advised. \nYou probably dropped it too many times or have internal damage. \nThe repairs may be a bit pricey. sorry :T\n", "Q: Showing current directory in Terminal's title, using tcsh I'd like the title bar of Terminal to always show the directory I'm in.  I don't want it shown in the prompt.  I found some magic trick code online, and have this in my .tcshrc:\n\nset prompt = \"%B%m:%n %?====>%b \"\nalias cwdcmd 'echo -ne \"\\033]0;$cwd\\007\"'\n\nIt sort of works except for two things: 1) the cwd isn't shown in the title bar, and 2) the cwd along with some gibberish is printed at the command line.  I figured maybe the quoting wasn't right, or some other syntax issue, but experimenting didn't lead to improvement.   \nFor reasons unspecified, I must use tcsh not bash. The latter, I can get working fine.\n\nA: This is the prompt I use in tcsh.  It sets the window title to the full path (which as Chris Page answered, gains extra functionality in Lion).  The prompt itself is essentially [$HOST:$PWD] $USER% using tcsh % syntax.\nset prompt = '%{\\e]2;%~\\a%}%S[%m:%c3] %n%#%s '\n\n\nA: This is what I have in my .cshrc\n\nalias cwdcmd 'printf \"\\033]1;%s\\007\\033]2;%s\\007\" \"$cwd:t\" \"$HOST echo $cwd | sed s-$HOME-~-\" '\n\nIt does some additional stuff for iTerm, which I use instead of Termial, but seems to work fine\nthere as well.  \n\nA: As of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, Terminal now supports displaying the working directory using the standard window \"proxy\" icon. This is enabled by default for bash (the default shell). See /etc/bashrc for the relevant code.\nThis enables several behaviors, such as the ability to create a new terminal in the same directory (by default, New Tab will do so, and you can enable it when creating a new window), and restoring the working directory when quitting/restarting Terminal (for Resume). It also enables restoring working directories when opening Window Groups.\nAs a convenience, if you have your shell configured to put the working directory path in the window (or tab) title, Terminal will check whether the title contains a valid local path and provide some of the same behaviors automatically (although it won't restore the working directory for Resume).\n", "Q: Disable Terminal's title bar directory on Lion i was wondering if there was any way of disabling the folder location on the titlebar of the built-in terminal application on Lion. I mean:\n\nAny ideas ?\n\nA: It's done in /etc/bashrc.  You probably don't want to mess with that file.  You can override what's done there by creating a file called .profile in your home directory that contains the following line:\nunset PROMPT_COMMAND\nThis will remove the directory in the title bar after you restart Terminal.\n\nA: I don't think it's possible in the current version of Lion (10.7.0).\nHowever, you can personalize every other elements of the window name in the preferences of the application in the \"window\" tab of your window settings\" (in the \"Settings\" pane). There you can choose wether to display the following items in the Terminal's title bar :\n\n\n*\n\n*Name of the active process\n\n*Name of the shell command\n\n*Name of the window setting\n\n*TTY name\n\n*Dimensions\n\n*Command key\n\n\nLet's hope Apple will add \"current directory\" to the list !\n", "Q: After Lion installation, Safari occasional unresponsive, won't take input Since installing Lion, I've had Safari 5.1 become unresponsive to input several times on two different machines (both iMacs, in different locations). \nI don't see anything in the forums I quickly checked.

I'm having a hard time figuring out what constitutes as \"recent use\" in Lion that will cause spaces to rearrange(I have the \"automatically rearrange spaces based on recent use\" box checked).  I use both the Option + Number keyboard shortcut and the four finger swipe to navigate between my spaces, but I can't figure out what causes them to auto rearrange.\nHere is an example:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've got 3 spaces.  \n\n*In Space 1 let's say I've got Safari and Mail open, Space 2 is iTunes, and let's say TextEdit is open in space 3.  The spaces are currently in order 1-3.\n\n*I start in space 1, then I use the keyboard shortcut to go directly to space 3. I do a few things in text edit and then want to navigate back to space 1.  Any way that I choose to navigate back to space 1 will not cause the spaces to reorder, they stay in the order they begun in.  \n\n\nI've tried every form of navigating between and using apps in different spaces to get the spaces to reorder, but I can't cause it to happen.  However every once in a while It happens automatically, and I can't figure out what actually caused that reordering to occur, it always seems a bit random.  Based on the setting name, I would assume that if I were in Space 1, and then used an app in Space 3 it would rearrange the spaces so that Space 3 was in the 2nd spot, since it was used more recently than Space 2.  Am I misunderstanding this?\nHas anyone been able to pinpoint what causes the spaces in Lion to rearrange?  I'd love to be able to make more sense of this.\n\nA: From my observations, when you alt-tab or click on an app icon on the dock, the clicked app will automatically be on the second space. This only happens only if the app is in another space that's not in the second one (if it's in the second one then the arrangement won't change).\nControl-arrow key and Mission control navigation won't change the arrangement either.\n\nA: When you're on space one, and go to another space/app via the dock (or however else you go to an app) - that space becomes the second space.\nIf you're not on the first space, then whatever app/space you go to becomes the space next to it (and not necessarily the second space)\nIt takes a bit of getting used to as you might think that whatever space you're on, and going to another would automatically make that space the second space - but it doesn't work like that (least not on my machine).\n", "Q: show battery in prompt and have it update after every command i just fresh-installed Lion, and i am in the process of seeing up my system.\ni am using this function (found somewhere online...) to show it in the prompt :\nbattery_status()\n{\n    maxcap=`ioreg -l | grep Capacity | awk '/MaxCapacity/{print $5}'`\n    curcap=`ioreg -l | grep Capacity | awk '/CurrentCapacity/{print $5}'`\n   \n    curcap=`echo $curcap*1000|bc`\n    proc=`echo $curcap / $maxcap |bc`;\n\n    len=`echo ${#proc}`;\n\n    proc_num=${proc:0:3}\n    proc_dec=${proc:3:4}\n\n    proc_num_len=`echo ${#proc_num}`;\n   \n    if [ $proc_num_len == \"3\" ]; then\n            if [ $proc_num != \"100\" ]; then\n                    proc_num=${proc:0:2}\n                    proc_dec=${proc:2:3}\n            fi\n    fi\n\n    echo $proc_num.$proc_dec%\n}\n\nAnd i generate my prompt like this :\n_PS1user=\"\\u@\"\n_PS1host=\"$txtred\\h\"\n_PS1time=\"$txtwht | \\t | \"\n_PS1battery=\"`battery_status`\"\n_PS1end=\"$txtrst\\n\\w › \"\n\nexport PS1=\"$_PS1user$_PS1host$_PS1time$_PS1battery$_PS1end\"\n\nunset _PS1user _PS1host _PS1time _PS1battery _PS1end\n\nHowever, since Lion, the battery Part is not updated every time the prompt appears again.

There are three page swipe gesture options in Lion:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Scroll left or right with two fingers, which is new to Lion, has a neat animation and is currently supported only by Safari.\n\n*Swipe left or right with three fingers existed in Snow Leopard and doesn't have the animation, but is supported by other applications.\n\n*Swipe with two or three fingers enables both of these gestures.\n\nNow, I would be happy with the third option, however it seems that three-finger swipe gesture completely ignores natural scrolling preference.\nIf you disable natural scrolling, all options work identically, but if you turn it back on, two-finger swipe changes its direction, while three-finger gesture stays the same.\nThis leaves me utterly confused because to go Back in Safari with natural scrolling I can:\n\n\n*\n\n*swipe right with two fingers, or\n\n*swipe left with three fingers.\n\n\nThis gets just as confusing in Mission Control or any other application that supports navigation.\n\nCan I override this behavior and “invert” three-finger gestures, too, and should I?\nWhat was the idea behind this design decision?\n\nA: This may be one of those things that is labeled as a \"feature not a bug.\" It's possible that the swiping gestures that are the same as the gestures on Snow Leopard are considered \"Legacy\" gestures. If that's the case then it is possible that having it \"backwards\" Is the expected behavior. If it's a legacy gesture then it may be considered to ignore natural scrolling because that is a \"new\" feature. I'm not saying that's how it should work, if you ask me if you change the direction of scrolling, it should apply to all gestures, not just the scrolling ones. I've moved mine back to the two finger option for the moment. You should file it at http://www.apple.com/feedback to make sure that Apple knows how confusing this is.\n\nA: A workaround to make the three finger swipe natural:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable \"Swipe between pages\" in the trackpad settings\n\n*Install BetterTouchTool\n\n*Reassign the three finger gestures as following: \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ne5advnzd1xhvuq/Screenshot%202014-12-26%2010.43.11.png?dl=0\n\nA: Follow-up on this question, since I arrived here searching for how to invert the three-finger swipe gesture in the later versions of OS X (El Capitan etc.), where this is switching screens (Mission Control, aka spaces) and not pages anymore.  I hope this will be useful for others.\nBuilding on the answer by shock_one, you can use BetterTouchTool to invert the 3F swipe.\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*In System Preferences/Trackpad/More Gestures, ensure \"Swipe between full-screen apps\" is disabled\n\n*In BetterTouchTool or equivalent, create new gestures for mapping \"three finger swipe left\" to the Predefined Action/OS X Functionality/Move Right a Space, and viceversa\n\n\nAlternatively, you can use other macro tools, by mapping the 3F swipe to the shortcut key used in Mission Control for switching spaces.\n\nA: I have found that toggling the following does the trick:\nSystem Preferences >> Trackpad >> Scroll & Zoom >> Scroll direction: Natural\nNote that toggling this option does not only reverse the direction of the three-finger swipe gesture; it also reverses the direction of two-finger scrolling (as both two-finger and three-finger gestures are affected by the one check-box).\nTested on macOS Big Sur (Version 11.4)\n", "Q: How to fix “swipe up” and “swipe down” gestures in Reeder after installing Lion? After upgrading to Lion, Reeder swipe up and swipe down gestures stopped working.\n\nHow do I fix them?\n\nA: This problem is a known issue and has been fixed in recent versions.     \nHowever, it is not specific to Reeder and seems to also affect Twitter and other apps.  \nTo work around it, hold ⌥ Option and swipe using the same count of fingers that you have set for Mission Control in Trackpad preference pane:\n\n\nA: You can fix this (temporarily), but there's some plist hacking involved. I read on reeder's twitter feed about a solution to this problem. \n\n“@jagreenwood: @reederapp i got them working like this tumblr.com/xic3melm6o swipeWithEvent isn't called otherwise”\n  Great, thanks!\n\nThe solution described at the linked address explains how to fix this problem in a couple of steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*I set up the trackpad properties in Preferences like this:\n\n\n*open up ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad.plist in your favorite editor \n\n*make set the value of key TrackpadThreeFingerVertSwipeGesture to 1\n\n*Restart your computer as this setting otherwise isn't used.\n\n\nIt's a bit hackish, but works pretty fine for me.

I'm using Snow Leopard 10.6.7.\nAny suggestions on what could be causing this?\n\nA: Well, to answer my own question: the problem was that my GPU was overheating.\nI forgot to mention that this specific machine is a hackintosh. I don't know if such thing can happen to a real Mac, but anyway: here where I live it's pretty hot and dry, so there's a lot of dust accumulation inside and around my computer.

This is my second Mac, I also have a 2010 Mac Mini.  Part of the reason for the Air is it's lightweight and mobility.  Part of this sacrifice is a somewhat small 128gb, means it just isn't reasonable to store my music library on the Air.  I'd like to keep my verging on 40gb music collection on the Mini.\nI also have an iPad and an iPod touch.  I would like to sync my iPad and iPod to my Mini for music and my Air for documents, such as PDFs, school files, iCal and Address Book.  Is this possible?

However, the designers have made the unfortunate choice of only listing -ise endings for words such as advertise, customise, etc. Many Brits, such as myself, prefer the -ize spelling.\nIn Lion, auto correct keeps changing all my -ize spellings to -ise. Not what I want!\nCan any of you suggest a clever way (perhaps a perl script?) to quickly add all -ize variants of corresponding -ise spellings to the local dictionary?\nNote: the suggestion \"switch to US spellings\" is not acceptable!\n\nA: I found a good-enough fix for this.\nI copied the Oxford English dictionary -ize words from here:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Spelling/Words_ending_with_%22-ise%22_or_%22-ize%22\nand pasted them into\n/Users/danbrowne/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary\nThis seems like a fairly comprehensive list. Anything which is missing I can add by hand.\nOne remaining issue: Apple doesn't seem to be able to intelligently conjugate these words, but using copy-paste on the list (ize -> izes, izing, ized, etc.) sorted that out.\n\nA: Adding words to the local dictionary is tiresome!\nJust do this instead:\nSystem Preferences > Language & Region > Keyboard Preferences… > Text > Spelling > Set up… > Check both British and US English.\nWorks for me!\n\nA: Switching to Canadian English will sort the problem out, and seems to allow other British spelling variants, such as programme and connexion. I share your frustration: -ize is not an Americanism (although -yse is) but is standard British English (alongside the -ise variant) and preferred by Oxford on etymological grounds and by Yours Truly just because. It is also allowed in Australian dictionaries, but not in Apple's Australian English setting. Apple really ought to sort it out themselves--they're the ones who've got it wrong, after all. There doesn't seem to be anything I can do about it on the iPhone, however. This only allows 'English' or 'British English' (the cheek!), and the latter only permits -ise. \n\nA: There is an Oxford style British dictionary available here.\nYou can download the bundle, extract the en_GB-oed.aif and en_GB-oed.dic files, and copy them into Spelling/Library.  It will appear in the list of spelling dictionaries as \"English (Library)\".\nNote though that this dictionary allows only -ize spelling, not -ise.  You may find this annoying, or helpful in keeping a consistent style.  Also, the dictionary is a bit old, and probably of slightly worse quality than the default British English dictionary.\nI'm a new Mac user, so I ave minimal experience with this on OS X, but I've been using this dictionary for several years with Vim.  Apart from a few words missing, it's very usable.\n\nA: Have you tried Canadian English?  I think it uses -our and -ize.\n\nA: If you have “correct spelling automatically” on then you have the problem you describe.\nAs an alternative you can activate “show spelling and grammar” and check spelling after you complete your writing and ignore any and all suggestions to replace “z\" with “s\".\n\nA: I guess you could try using grep from the command-line to get the list words ending with 'ize' from the US dictionary (in [/System]/Library/Spelling) and append them into user dictionary (~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary or ~/Library/Spelling/en_GB). This should do the trick.\n\nA: There is a very good solution for this that solves more than the -ise/-ize problem: enabling more than one English dictionary at a time: for example you can have spelling for English to accept both US and UK dictionaries.\nRead this answer for details on how to set it up: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/62551/1916\n\nA: If there are just a few which bother you, add them as custom spellings. Otherwise the Canadian dictionary is a good recommendation.\nKeep in mind, one can switch a single application to a spelling set if there's some documents which must be written with \"-ize\" but generally you write with \"-ise\" in your correspondence.\nYou can also change the language for spelling while in an application.\n\n\nA: \"Advertize\", \"customize\" and so on are simply wrong in British English. I'm afraid there's no way to make it allow incorrect spellings en masse -- you should choose an accepted standard that's in the dictionary and stick with it. Or if you just want to make up your own spellings (which is what it sounds like) then simply turn off spell check altogether.\n", "Q: How can I launch an Automator workflow upon import in iPhoto?

It allows you to put your picture directly in a given folder.\nYou can also create a \"transfer module\" with automator which can be set to run after an import using Image Capture with imported pictures as input. Thanks to this, you can create an automator process to arrange them in folder as you want.\nImage Capture is also scriptable with AppleScript, you might want to take a look at its dictionary if the GUI or Automator don't provide enough flexibility for you.\nIf you want your pictures both in iPhoto and in your folder, you can configure the automator process to add them in iPhoto once imported in your folder with Image Capture. Lots of workflow are possible, it depends and what you exactly want to achieve.\n", "Q: Downsides of using Windows on a Mac Please do not comment on how using Windows itself is a huge downside. After several years using OSX, Linux and Windows, I can say that working on the latter OS is best for my needs.\nI do own an iMac (27\", mid-2010) however, and I am aware that I can install Windows 7 on it w/o using Bootcamp. Now, are there any caveats in doing so? E.g. I noticed that the iMac is heating up more than it used to under OSX. Maybe the arguably annoying abundance of hard-disk accesses under Win7 is a reason for that. \nCould this be a danger? Are there other issues known to SE users here? \nsummary: any caveats in using Win7 as main OS on an iMac?\nEDIT: These helpful answers indicate that in general it might not be such a great idea to extensively use Win7 on a Mac because the hardware might wear off faster due to sub-par Win7 power management (compared to OSX). \n\nA: Windows Vs Mac wars aside, it makes a lot of sense to use a Mac as a Windows machine. PC World or PC Magazine (I always get them confused) named the MacBook Pro the best Windows machine not so long ago. Their reasoning was that Apple includes the right drivers for the different hardware components that they ship on the Mac. I don't think that means the latest drivers, but the right drivers nonetheless. \n@Rabarberski speculates if Apple does not want to invest too much time and money developing good drivers. My take on this is that I don't think Apple develops their drivers, they just work with a much limited number of components and that makes including all necessary drivers in BootCamp possible (For instance, there's only a handful of different video and sound cards that the Macs have shared over the last few years). My theory is that Apple doesn't issue repeated updates to the BootCamp driver set precisely because they don't need to--the ones included work fine for all of their Mac hardware configurations. \nBefore switching over to the Mac, I used PC's from Acer, Compaq, HP, Dell, Toshiba and Lenovo. On each one of these systems, drivers were always an issue at some point--even the ones included in the system restore disk. Using Windows on the Mac has been the exact opposite experience and I highly recommend it if Windows is your thing. I develop software for Windows and the Mac and I dual boot using BootCamp. I am seriously considering keeping my current MacBook Pro as a Windows-only computer once I get my next Mac. Hope this helps. \n\nA: In my opinion power management of a mac that runs windows os is really a big problem. Not only does it produce more heat than mac osx, but also shortens the battery life.\nI got this problem from all of my mac and my friends' (the amount could be 30+!). Although all devices can be supported on windows, I prefer using an SSD on my mac and run Windows on the virtual machine.\n\nA: I'd say the biggest downside would be that you'd always have to explain why you put Windows on a Mac.\nAside from that, driver issues (especially sound) made me abandon Win7 in bootcamp about a year ago.\nI am not sure why there are these driver issues: either (a) Apple does not want to invest too much time/money in developing good ones (which would be relatively 'simple' given their low number of hardware configurations) , or (b) they do it on purpose to somehow not give you the complete Windows experience... Somehow, I am thinking the latter one is the case.\n\nA: I have installed Windows 7 on my Macbook Pro and love it.  A minor point but one annoyance is the keyboard mapping is different so things are not as intuitive.  When editing moving cursor to end of line or beginning of line, top of page bottom of page, the delete key is a backspace key and there is no dedicated forward delete button.  No dedicated print screen key, etc.  There are of course equivalents but you have to look them up and require multiple simultaneous keystrokes.  \n\nA: Never mind the heat. Unless you have a broken machine, your iMac cannot overheat to the point in which is damages itself due to automatic emergency shut downs if a certain temperature threshold.\nAnd the downside:\n\n\n*\n\n*huge inconvenience in having to reboot just to use the other OS regardless for how small a task\n\n*inability to view your OS X partition from windows\n\n*possible issues with programs that access hardware on a barebones level to which apple's drivers might not help (i've seen a few problems with windows games and some macbook GPUs for example)\n\nA: I put Windows 7 on an iMac for my mom. It works really well - as a silent, fast PC. Occasionally I have hiccups when it sleeps and goes into a weird reboot cycle. But otherwise the experience is great. I did notice some disk thrashing initially but it settled down. Temperatures and fans are normal. On a Mac Laptop you can expect less battery life, but no real issues for desktops.\n", "Q: How do local TimeMachine backups work exactly? Since Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) TimeMachine performs local backups to /.MobileBackups if enabled (tmutil enableLocal, default enabled on portable macs).\nThe different types of backups are color encoded in the fancy TimeMachine space thingy, local backups are white, external storage purple. They mostly differ only by a minute. What exactly is the concept of those local backups? \nAre they simple a completely parallel, additional backup? Or are they at least merged into your external storage backup when you come home after begin away from your backup drive for a week? And what happens if i require lots of disk space suddenly? Do i need to remove the local backups manually?\n\nA: I also thought that the Local Snapshots were supposed to merge into your Time Machine backups but it seems, in my experience, that they don't. You can see both when you're in Time Machine and \"About This Mac\" shows that they still exist after multiple backups to an external harddrive. I do think that they are supposed to merge with themselves the way that Time Machine backups do, to save space, merging into daily and weekly backups instead. As far as Finder is concerned, the space is not used. Looking in the info bar at the bottom of a Finder window showing your root drive will show that you have more space than something like iStat Nano will show on Dashboard. I think this is because the backups are supposed to be expendable. If your computer really needs the space I assume that it will get rid of some of its snapshots to make room.\nWe may see that in the future they merge back into regular Time Machine backups as Lion matures more.\nIt's also worth noting that I don't think they count as real 'backups' in the sense that you can't restore to them the same way you can restore to a time machine backup from the Recovery HD. They are really meant to help you recover a file instead of your whole filesystem.\n\nA: Local Time Machine backup purpose is to have an hourly backup even when your external hard drive isn't connected. When you connect your external drive, it copies the local backup to the external drive.\nThat's why it is activated by default on portable Mac as they suppose the external hard drive of your desktop Mac is plugged permanently if you're interested in hourly backup with Time Machine.\n\nA: Local backups do not use any space, so far as the user is concerned.  The area they are kept is marked as unused to the OS, so your 30Gb free space may actually contain 5Gb or backups for example.  The local backups are not quite the same as the full time machine backups tho, which (within reason) takes copies of any changed files including application binaries.  The local backups are more for changes made in your documents etc and dovetail nicely with Versions etc.  Should you need more space the system will cycle through and overwrite your local backups in order of age to preserve the most recent changes where possible.  And, as Olivier rightly mentions, they get shuttled off to your proper Time Machine should you have one when it is connected.\n\nA: So, I investigated part 1 of the question: The backups are not merged into the external TimeMachine backups when the external disk reappears.\n[15:21:35] I disconnected my backup drive\n[16:40:01] I checked the contents of my /.MobileBackups folder\n# ls -l /.MobileBackups/Computer/ | tail -n2\ndrwxr-xr-x@ 3 root  wheel  102 Aug 11 15:36 2011-08-11-153653\ndrwxr-xr-x@ 3 root  wheel  102 Aug 11 16:36 2011-08-11-163653\n\n[16:55:31] I reconnected my backup drive and clicked \"Back Up Now\"\n[17:00:10] Backup finished, checked the contents of the external backup drive\n$ ls -l '/Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/<myhostname>' | tail -n3\ndrwxr-xr-x@ 6 root  staff  204 Aug 11 14:41 2011-08-11-144112\ndrwxr-xr-x@ 6 root  staff  204 Aug 11 17:00 2011-08-11-170010\nlrwxr-xr-x  1 root  staff   17 Aug 11 17:00 Latest -> 2011-08-11-170010\n\nAs one can see, the local backups performed inbetween have not been included in the external drive. The backups seem to be entirely independent - pretty poor implementation :(\n", "Q: Change brightness on iMac in target display mode Recent iMacs support a \"target display\" mode, where you can connect another Mac using a DisplayPort cable, and the iMac will function as an external monitor.\nThis used to work fine, however now if the iMac is running Mac OS 10.6.7 or later (including Lion), the iMac screen will switch to 100% brightness when put into this mode, and the brightness keys on the iMac keyboard can not be used to adjust the brightness. Has anyone found a solution to this problem?\n\nA: yeah, toggling the function key setting worked for me. I'm on 17\" 2011 mbp and the 27 inch cinema display with Lion.\n\nA: Ctrl-F1 (which has a \"dimming\" circle with short marks around it) or Ctrl-F2 (which has a \"bright\" circle with longer marks around it)work on the external display. Dim and Bright, alone, work on the native display.\n\nA: The brightness keys would sometimes work and sometimes not on the target iMac. So I solved this with a System Preference, Shades for Mac. It puts a set of sunglasses in your toolbar and you can easily adjust the brightness. \n\nA: Question is a bit old but apparently still an issue since it caused me quite a bit of frustration until I figured out the following which works reliably.\nCOMMAND-F2 on the iMac keyboard will toggle between the running iMac local display, and the Target Display Mode (TDM) when connected to my laptop via DisplayPort. TDM always starts out at 100% brightness when you switch to it.\nCOMMAND-F1 will adjust brightness lower until it goes completely dark. If that happens you need to switch back to iMac local then return again to TDM at 100%\nNow the important part:   COMMAND-F1 sometimes doesn't respond to lower the brightness. I found this seems to happen if local iMac screen is locked.. if I switch back to local iMac display, unlock to log in to the account, then switch back to TDM and the brightness control will now respond.\n", "Q: Should I write app reviews to Mac App Store in English or in my native language? While browsing the apps in Mac App Store I can see the majority of the reviews are posted by users with Finnish sounding names. Some of the reviews are written in English and some in Finnish.\nI have set the App Store's language as Finnish. Does App Store show only reviews from users that have set the same language? Should I write my reviews in English or in Finnish, ie. in my native language?\nConfusingly enough, the most of the GUI elements in App Store are in English, with some Finnish exceptions — this may be the reason there are so many reviews written in English by Finns.\n\nA: App Store is divided by countries it is available in and each country's App Store is a separate entity. For an end-user (me, you, anyone who buys apps basically) there is no cross-over between them. If you're from Finland you're most likely using Finnish App Store (possibly with interface in English).\nOnly users of the same store will see the reviews posted in it. Reviews are not shared between individual (country) stores so it is perfectly fine for reviews to be in country's native language.\n\nA: I disagree with Joshua, but without hard feelings ;)\nI'm an Italian living in the Netherlands. This gives me the Dutch version of the Apple Store. Although I understand Dutch, many don't, and English reviews are always welcome.\nI'd switch to the US store if I could, but being my credit card Dutch, I'm out of luck.\nEdit: I think I can't switch to US, not 100% sure.\n\nA: If your language is set to Finnish that means that like you said the app store will only show reviews from users that have set the same language.\nSo it really doesn't matter because no one from another country is going to read your review in Finnish and not know what it means.\n\nA: Yes. Well the problem is in bilingual countries, then it's not that simple and Apple's one country one language thinking goes a bit wrong. Since the IOS5 update my app store interface on my iPhone is in Finnish even though I have the language set to Swedish. I can imagine the same is true in other bilingual countries, like Canada, Swizerland, Belgium et.c. The app store interface should always be the same as the phone language is set to. If that language is not available it should default to English - Not to another language that happens to exist in the same country.\n", "Q: What is the difference between the variant language dictionaries in OS X? How can I see some or all of the individual word differences between the built-in dictionaries. I'm curious and inspired by this question where the UK typically adds the suffix -ise and USA typically spells it -ize.\nIt would be nice to to see the differences between these variants from the list of languages/dictionaries available in Mac OS X.\n\n\n*\n\n*Australian English\n\n*British English\n\n*Canadian English\n\n*U.S. English\n\n\nIn originally asking this question, I thought that the spelling was controlled by the Language tab in the Language & Text preference pane, but have since learned that there is a Spelling option under the Text tab of the same preference pane (is that new in Snow Leopard?). From here it appears that other dictionaries can be easily imported (in aff or dic file format) which would lead me to believe that the spelling dictionaries are a standard format that may be read by other tools. However, the /Library/Spelling folder doesn't have any files.\n\n\nAs a bonus, it would be great to know how the language variants under the Language tab are used and why the variants there don't match up to the spelling dictionary.\n\n\nA: Many people have tried to find the files for Apple's spell check dictionaries but I don't recall any successes.\nAs for the Language tab in Language & Text, it really doesn't have anything to do with spelling as such, although the top item on the list can set the default spell check dictionary in some circumstances.  The top item on the list also sets the OS and app language (for the 22 that are available), the default collation order, and the preferred language requested by Safari.  The order of the list can determine the app language used if a localization for the top item is not available.  The order can also determine whether a Japanese or Chinese font is used for text which is ambiguous in that regard. I think adding an item to the list can sometimes provide additional encodings in Mail app.\n\nA: I presume the other languages follow the example of the English ones, and provide for localised variations in spelling and grammar.  Look up \"colour\" and \"color\" for example, or words ending in \"ise\" rather than \"ize\" and so on.\nNot aware of a way of checking differences, but can't really see why you would need to - if required add multiple choices from the languages and text preference pane as input sources, then ensure the input choice is put in your menu bar for quick selection of them.  Then go play in dictionary in the dashboard.\n", "Q: Apple Directory / Profile Manager  - Restricting simultaneous same user logins on multiple  machines? We are using Apple Directory for internal user authentication. We want to restrict a user to login from a single machine at any one time. I have been trying to find a way to do this in Apple Directory without any luck.\nIs there a way to do something similar in Snow Leopard or Lion server?\n\nA: I assume you mean Open Directory, not Apple Directory.\nThere is a check box in Workgroup Manager in the user's account.  Set it to not allow simultaneous logins.  This box is present in WGM on 10.3 - 10.6  I know that Lion deals with workgroups a little differently. \n\nA: Yes, there is a checkbox in Workgroup Manager to restrict Lion users to not allow simultaneous login on managed computers.\n\n\n*\n\n*Authenticate with diradmin or other LDAP administrator (the picture below shows the box dimmed as I was not authenticated at the time)\n\n*Select the user in the left pane\n\n*Select Advanced in the right pane\n\n*enable or disable the checkbox for simultaneous login as needed.\n\n\n\n", "Q: Use only the left option key as meta key in Terminal.app There's an option in Terminal.app -> Preferences -> Settings -> Keyboard but it allows me only to set both option keys as meta keys.\niTerm.app has such an option but don't like that application.\n\nA: If you aren't totally set on using Terminal, I believe that iTerm2 has a setting to just use one of the option keys as meta. If you are, is there a setting to maybe use the Esc key as meta? I know that it's more convenient to use the option key, but the Esc key might be easier to set.\n\nA: I have built a solution myself and it doesn't require abandoning Terminal.app in favour of iTerm 2.\nIt is a simple status bar app that runs in the background and rewrites all left Alt + $KEY key events to two key events in rapid succession, Esc, then $KEY; however, it only does this if Terminal.app is in focus.\nYou can find the source for the app here.

Do you archive your Sent & Trashed emails too? I'm using Mail.app + IMAP email accounts for my email. I want to be able to archive all my email and make them searchable. \nCurrently I copy the previous month's email from my IMAP folders to local folders called 2010, 2011, etc. However I don't copy my Sent email, so I'm wondering what's the best way to archive them as well. Any suggestions? Please share!\nI'd like a method that doesn't involve Gmail if possible, as I'm not a big fan of the company and the service.\n\nA: I use Mail app's \"smart mailboxes\" instead of copying and moving the actual messages in Mail. \nFor example, to archive July 2011:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a new smart mailbox, \n\n*name it \"Mail Archive July 2011\" or whatever, \n\n*set the find criteria to \"Date Received is in the date range 1 Jul 2011 to 31 Jul 2011\",\n\n*you will probably want to check the \"Include messages from Sent\"\n\n*Hit okay and in a moment you have a folder contain all of July's email\n\n*Right-click the smart mailbox and choose the \"Archive\" option and save.\n\n\nAfter this you have the option of keeping the smart folder or deleting it. Spotlight (in OS 10.6.8) searches the .mbox archives Mail produces, so your archive remains searchable. \n\nA: I've recommended MailSteward to several clients. It maintains a separate SQLite (or MySQL in the \"pro\" version) database of archived messages. It handles de-duping too. Messages are searchable, attachments are stored and you can reply to archived messages. (Reply will open in Mail.)\n\nA: Basically, I always BCC to myself, so never archive the Sent folder.\n\nA: Since you're in OS X Lion, the best way to \"Archive\" a message is perhaps using the integrated (new) way to Archive: ⌘Y \n\n\nA: There are many options, but I recommend the module archiving emails OpenKM. Because allows us to use the repository as a document management system to store messages massively. The mail file is an automated process for the preservation and protection of all emails.\n", "Q: Why doesn't Lion recognize my drive as a supported permanent storage volume? Whenever I save a Pages (or other) document I'm greeted with this warning. \n\nI really like the version feature and this warning basically says that it is disabled. Any ideas why my hard drive isn't supported? The machine is a mid 2010 13\" MacBook Pro with a 1TB internal drive. The drive is formatted as HFS+ Journaled.\n\nA: I ended up wiping the drive and just installing Lion from scratch. That seems to have fixed the issue.\n\nA: The problem is that while the drive was originally formatted as HFS+, it was most likely NOT set up with the GUID Partition Table, which is required by Intel Macs if you want the disk to be a boot volume. Yours was probably originally set up with the older APT (Apple Partition Table) which was the standard for PowerPC Macs.\nAn Intel Mac can read and write files to an APT - HFS+ hard drive, but it cannot boot from one.\nWhen you reformatted the drive with Disk Utility, it used GUID by default.\nI know that Disk Utility can change one to the other, but I'm not sure if it can do so without reformatting the disk first. So your reformat did the job, but now you know exactly why.\n\nA: There is some information at the bottom of this post that details problems with versioning. My first recommendation would be to repair permissions, and if that doesn't work, try the following commands (make a backup first because I'm making this up on the fly):\nmkdir /.DocumentRevisions-V100\nchown root:wheel /.DocumentRevisions-100\nchmod 111 /.DocumentRevisions-100\n\nWhat those commands do is to make the directory that Lion is supposed to create to store its versions, change the owner and group, and then change the permissions as per the post linked above.\n", "Q: Do the new macbook pro models (2011) still have a 4 partition limit? If I remember correctly, the older Macbook pro models (pre 2011) had a 4 partition limit: so, if you tried to install multiple operating systems, you had this limit.\nDo the new models (2011) still have this limitation? I'm planning to install two Linuxes, A Windows and a Mac partitions to boot.\n\nA: This is not a limitation of the hardware. This is a limitation of the MBR partitioning scheme required to allow Windows to boot with other non-Windows operating systems. The MBR partitioning scheme only supports 4 primary partitions.\nThe GUID partitioning scheme that Mac OS X uses by default is able to handle more that 4 partitions but not all operating systems support GPT.\n", "Q: How do I get Safari Mac's bookmarks to overwrite Safari iOS bookmarks? I recently pruned and edited my Mac's Safari bookmarks. I was very dismayed the next time I synced to discover that the bookmarks from my iPhone had been merged with those on my Mac, even though before the lists had been identical. So now I had even more bookmarks than before I started, many of them duplicated.\nAs an experiment I've tried deleting just a few bookmarks on the Mac and resyncing, and they just come back.\nHow do I get the Safari Mac bookmarks to overwrite the Safari iOS bookmarks instead of merging? I don't want to have to delete boomarks on the Mac and then grab the phone and do they same thing over again, unless that's the only way. Which would suck. Because I also have an iPad, so I would have to do it three times.\nThanks.\n\nA: There's an option in the 'Info'-Tab. At the bottom, you'll find an 'Advanced'-section: 'Replace information on this iPad'. Check 'Bookmarks' there. Instead of merged, the data on the iOS device will be replaced.\nIn MobileMe this was synchronized across all devices, so I hope with iCloud this will be also.\n\nA: Normally, syncing via iTunes will take care of the collisions between bookmark libraries. What gets added in one, gets added to the other one. The only odd thing I have seen seen the original iPhone is that all of the default bookmarks in Safari (from the day you first turned on the iPhone) were never synced back into the Mac bookmarks. Other than that, syncing happened as you would expect. \nThe only thing that can change this behavior is when you check the option to replace all bookmarks on your iPhone on your next sync. But this is unchecked by default. You may want to verify that it remains unchecked for you. \niTunes syncing as it exists today is not ideal. However, this fall when iCloud is released, you will be able to seamlessly sync your bookmarks across your Mac and all iOS devices. Some have speculated that iCloud will use the same infrastructure that iBooks uses to sync up the page number you are currently reading. If that is the case, then iCloud will be pretty good--as iBooks syncs up behind the scenes quite well. \nHope this helps. \n\nA: If you are a MobileMe user, the easiest way to reset syncing from Mac -> iOS is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your iOS devices go to Settings -> Mail, Contacts, Calendars -> MobileMe and disable Bookmark syncing. This will delete all bookmarks on your iOS device\n\n*On your Mac edit your desired bookmark list in Safari\n\n*Go to System Preferences -> MobileMe -> Sync -> Advanced -> Reset Sync Data\n\n*From the pop-up menu choose Bookmarks and ensure the sync is FROM your computer TO MobileMe\n\n*Once the sync reset is complete, re-enable bookmark syncing on your iOS devices and bookmarks will be in sync after a few minutes\n\n\nI have used this method quite a few times to re-sync things amongst my devices.\n", "Q: Getting Safari to forget Keywurl Having discovered the excellent SafariKeywordSearch thanks to an answer here, I'd now like to get rid of the warning which Safari pops up on launch about Keywurl not loading because it hasn't been tested with Safari 5.1.\nI thought I had circumvented this by deleting the Keywurl bundle from ~/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins (it had only been installed locally, not globally), but Safari still stubbornly pops up a warning. In actual fact, I was seeing two instances of the incompatibility popup before I performed this deletion, but that second one still persists. I've used Spotlight in an attempt to track down the phantom second instance, but without success.\nHas anyone any idea where it might be lurking?\n\nA: From Keywurl's ReadMe:\n\nInstallation\nCopy Keywurl.bundle into Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins\nunder your home folder, or in /Library/Application\nSupport/SIMBL/Plugins in the hard drive root if you want Keywurl to be\nenabled for all users on the computer.\nUninstalling\nTo uninstall, just delete the file you copied.\n\nYou said you mentioned that it was only installed locally, not globally, but I've had issues with other SIMBL plugins where I thought they were installed locally only to find another copy lurking at the system level.\nSo I'd check /Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins as well, just to be sure. Note that this is a different hierarchy than the one mention in Gio's answer.\nMake sure that you quit/relaunch Safari after you do this. A logout/restart might also help.\n\nA: The folder to delete should be ~/Library/Application Support/Keywurl\n\nA: The keywurl plugin cannot launch without SIMBL being present. It must still be on your system.\nOpen Activity Monitor and look for SIMBL Agent. If it running, then click the Sample Process icon. Look at the report produced - you will see the filename of the process - tho will give you a clue where the remnants of SIMBL are lurking on your system.\nKill the SIMBL agent process - then open Safari - you should find that the message is no longer popping up. \nThen you need to delete the remnants of SIMBL on your system. Probably the best way to do that is to reinstall it, and then deinstall using the official uninstaller. If that doesn't work, delete the file listed by Sample Process by hand.\n", "Q: Quick questions about the new Mac Mini Server (2011) I'm planning to buy the new Mac Mini Server (2011), but I couldn't find the answer to a few questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've read that it had an issue with its video card, but never found any site that details the so-called issue. Any idea what it is?\n\n*Can I just ignore the server stuff and user it as a normal OSX Lion and get the updates and all?\n\n*if I get the one with SSD, can I (easily) setup the system so that it runs off the SSD, and stores all the files in the HDD?\n\n*Do you think it will handle video editing in Final Cut Pro X well?\n\n\nAppreciate your help! :)\n\nA: On question #1, your best bet is the Apple Support forums. If there an issue, it should have been reported there by now. \nOn question number #2, you can ignore the server stuff and use the Mini as any other Mac with OS X Lion on it. You may need to tweak the default firewall settings but that is all I can think of. \nOn question number #3,  I have heard on different podcasts that people include both SSD's and HDD's in their Macs exactly like you want--system files on SSD, user files on HDD. Other World Computing is a good place to find SSD+HDD kits for the different Macs. I do not know if they offer one for the latest Mini, though. \nOn question #4, I cannot talk from experience with the current Mini. However, looking at its place within the Mac lineup alone, you can argue that eventually the Mini becomes their least capable Mac. While today's Mini has a recent Intel core architecture, and while you can in theory use a Thunderbolt drive as scratch disk when working on FCP X; just from my experience with the original Mini, I'd say that it will eventually fall short for your video editing needs. \nHope this helps. \n", "Q: How to reinstall previous iOS version on iPhone or iPod touch I have updated iOS version to 4.3.5 but I want to reinstall 4.2.1. Does any one know how to reinstall 4.2.1 on iPhone?\n\nA: This might be not possible, depending on what device you have. Because Apple has stopped signing 4.2.1, unless you have backed up your SHSH, there is no way back on iPhone 3GS or 4. \nIf you have jailbroken before, Cydia might have backed up your SHSH.

I'd like to keep my iTunes folder on the original drive, which is still in the computer as well.  When I used Migration Assistant I had it skip the Music folder.\nI haven't been able to get iTunes 10 to \"see\" the old library in its current location on the other drive.  I've gone into Preferences-->Advanced-->Change and selected all of the different folders in the old Music folder, but iTunes never sees my music.  Thanks!\n\nA: The easiest is to start with a fresh and empty folder in the new ~/Music directory.\nFire up iTunes and tell it to use the media folder on the the external drive and quit iTunes after making whatever settings you want about copying files / organization. I would recommend leaving both selected.\nThen move just the artwork folder and the itdb / xml files into place and replace the \"empty\" files that got created on the local ~/Music/iTunes folder. (basically use Finder to move everything back except the folder containing the media.)\nWhen you start iTunes it should run a quick check to make sure all the files are working and you can proceed with your app management / music enjoyment. \n", "Q: How do I get the Mac Terminal to show the gray font color I am running on a Mac with Snow Leopard.  Up until now, the default Terminal.app has served me well.  I have installed the IR_Black theme mentioned here: http://blog.toddwerth.com/entries/show/6.\nHowever, I noticed in a particular program that the gray font doesn't render.  In other words, it's invisible.  I ran the script listed here: https://gist.github.com/1099707 and every color shows except for COLOR_BLACK (which makes sense) and COLOR_GRAY.\nThere are other coworkers on a Windows box that run putty and gray shows up for them just fine on a black background.  Is there anyway to get the gray color to show up in Terminal and still have a black background? \n(If I used the Basic white-background theme, and run the colors script, then Gray just looks like a bold version of black.)\n\nA: On Snow Leopard you can install the TerminalColours plugin, which lets you modify the default colours.\nOn Lion you get a thoroughly updated Terminal.app that lets you do this out of the box and also supports 256 colours by default.\n\nA: That script isn't guaranteed to display gray for \"COLOR_GRAY\":\n\"\\033[1;30mCOLOR_GRAY\"\n\n\"1\" means bold, \"30\" means black. That script is assuming that bold text is displayed brighter than normal text, which is not the case by default.\nTo make Terminal display \"bold black\" as \"gray\" (technically, it displays it as \"ANSI Bright Black\"), enable:\n\nTerminal > Preferences > Settings > [profile] > Text > Use bright colors for bold text\n\nHowever, as Ingmar Hupp mentioned, as of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, Terminal supports 256 colors, and the sixteen ANSI colors are now customizable in the Settings preferences. So you should be able to either customize the ANSI colors or configure your application programs to use 256 colors to achieve the desired appearance (e.g., Vim supports 256-color color schemes; search for the \"tir_black\" color scheme).\n", "Q: Can a webpage appear in iOS Safari without any Safari UI even if someone visits the URL in the browser? I have a web app added to the home screen of the iphone. is it possible to open this web apps added to the home screen if someone visits a URL in safari.\ni'm aware that the web app added to the home screen is actually running in safari, but i want to open that web app .. is there any custom iphone specific URL to call a web app ?\nExample : i bookmarked www.example.com on my iphone and the app has all the required META tags to run as a webapp. now if someone visits www.example.com in the browser, it should detect if the app has been added to the home screen and if it is, it should open it.\nis this possible ?\nThe whole point is that i want to open the app without any Safari UI even if someone visits my URL in the browser.\nP.S i know the use of window.navigator.standalone - but it does not help in Safari.\n\nA: When you launch a web app by entering the URL in Safari it runs in the Safari app. But when you launch a web app from the springboard (home screen), it runs in different Safari app. Hence the lack of Safari UI in the that case. What you want isn't possible. And it's actually a good thing because the Safari UI offers option you might need to use ('mail link to this page', 'Tweet', 'Print', ...).\nWhat you want to do may be possible through some kind of hack if you jailbreak, although I doubt it.\n\nA: This is not possible. A webapp in Safari must show the Safari UI, but a web app launched from the springboard doesn't necessarily have to show this. However, though, in the version of iOS that is not yet released, there's this feature called Smart App Banners that alerts the user if the website has a native app counterpart. Unfortunately, you're talking about a web app, so this won't apply, but I just thought I'd throw that out there if you're thinking about going native...\nFrom Techcrunch,\n\nApple will now show a link to the App Store (or to the app, if you have already installed it) when you open a site that also offers a mobile app. Apple calls this feature “Smart App Banners.”\n\n", "Q: Remove missing pictures in iPhoto My iPhoto (iLife 11, version 9.1.5) committed sepuku. No fear, I have backups.\nThe backups I restored, instead of having 182GB of poorly taken pictures, ended up taking 276GB. Something failed with the restore procedure. The backup application I'm using is CrashPlan (and I do have an open support request about this with them and they are looking into it). I restored the whole directory of pictures (the iPhoto Library) into another directory and opened it with iPhoto (by starting it while pressing alt/option).\nI restarted iPhoto in maintenance mode (by pressing alt and command when starting iPhoto) and selected all options but the restore from backups. After regenerating everything, it claimed there were 27000 new pictures in there somewhere. As expected. I was offered to import them. I selected yes. Asmost all the pictures were duplicates and they are being ignored.\nNow, my concern is, those pics must still be laying around.

Instead the audience is treated to a distracting effect.\nIs there a way to disable the fancy sliding and go back to replacing pages?\n\nA: You can use ⌥ + ↓/↑ or ⌥ + ←/→ to navigate pages without the sliding effect.\n\nA: As a workaround - use Skim.

Just bought a new Macbook Pro with lion, but the launchpad button is not in the dock and I can't find it anywhere on the computer. I thought it may be gone because when I started the computer I used a firewire cable to put all the information from my old Macbook into the Macbook pro, and so all the settings from the Macbook were transferred. Could this have deleted the launchpad button? All help is appreciated!\n\nA: The launchpad button is an normal application.  You should expect to find it in the /Applications folder.

Files open fine at work in a Windows PC.\nAny ideas? Would Boot Camp work better than Fusion Virtual Machine?\nThanks...\n\nA: Starting with Lion, Preview can open docx files and does a good job. Much better than TextEdit or Pages.\nIn Snow Leopard, I found quick look to be very good as well — but you can't do much with the file inside quick look.\nObviously I can't test the documents you're having trouble with though.\n\nA: In Word there are all sorts of ways to insert images into a file. In Windows you can  create a \"link\" to the original creating software. \nhttp://www.techrepublic.com/article/link-to-another-file-in-your-word-document/5794878\nThis means that if you double click on the image then it opens the app which created the image.\nThe important thing is that this means that you have actually added something more than just the image to the word file and if you transfer the file to Mac, the image will not be displayed as the \"linked\" app doesn't exist.\nTry double clicking the images in Windows and seeing if they are linked. If so, that is your problem. You must then find a way of inserting the images without linking.  This page seems to explain how you can achieve this:\nhttp://www.labnol.org/software/insert-images-in-word-documents/8144/\n\nA: Try opening your .docx files on the Mac in the latest versions of LibreOffice and NeoOffice, which are both free. They are forks of the old program OpenOffice.org which you may be familiar with. They are huge programs that run rather slowly, but they may get the job done. They can also handle .xlsx and .pptx and many other office document formats.\nUltimately, though, you need to investigate what it is about these particular documents that someone is sending you, and the graphics embedded in them, that is causing this peculiar behavior. \n", "Q: Auto sync local files to remote Are there any OSX tools that can watch for file changes in a directory then sync (SFTP) those changes to a remote server?\nBasically I want to edit files locally (whatever files, whatever program) and have them automatically upload to the server.\nRsync can't watch a directory for changes on it's own, and I can't seem to get lyncd to run on osx, due to no inotify tool.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I'm only aware of proprietary systems like DropBox.\nBut it seems like this could be done fairly easily, using kqueue to detect file changes, and running rsync a few seconds later.\n\nA: RE : \"..

It has special -d option to react to events when a new file is added to a directory. The implication is that if a new file appears it must exit to allow an external shell loop to rescan the file system, so when -d is used, you've to use it with a loop.

I really like Cisco's 'Network Magic' software; but the site says they no longer support Mac..

For example, \nCasper Suite, InterMapper, IPNetMonitorX, Lithium 5.0, AutoScan-Network, \nDeployStudio, ...\nTo see who is on your network you may use Ntop.\nSince Mac OS X is a Unix-based operating system, there are also command line tools that allow you to manage other Macs remotely via SSH.

I read that the upgrade to OS X Lion is not intended for Mac Minis, is this true?\nIs there a way to upgrade a Mac Mini with an Intel CPU to OS X Lion?\n\nA: Yes, you can update a Mac Mini to Mac OS Lion.\nWhat you heard was incorrect, Mac Mini's are upgradable, just like any other Mac. Lion requires a Core 2 duo processor and 2 GB memory to run, so any Mac produced after circa 2007 will be fine.\n\nA: This depends on the exact CPU in your Mac mini. As stated on http://www.apple.com/macosx/how-to-buy/ \"[y]our Mac must have an Intel Core 2 Duo, Core i3, Core i5, Core i7, or Xeon processor to run Lion\".\nSince the 2006 Mac mini Models, however, shipped with a Intel Core processor (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_mini_with_Intel_Core#Specifications_2), it is not possible to install Lion on these machines.\nAn easy way to find out whether this applies is to select \"About this Mac\" in the Apple menu. There, you can see whether you have a supported processor.\n", "Q: Is ~/Applications new with Lion? I've seen a number of references to a folder at ~/Applications, including in a comment on this question. This prompted me to open my home folder on my Lion installation to have a look, and sure enough, there it is, complete with its own folder icon. Checking another machine which is running Snow Leopard showed no such folder.\nSo, am I right to assume that this is new with Lion, and is the recommended location for self-installed apps? I never have liked cluttering up the system Applications folder with extraneous software, and for that reason store most non-bundled apps in a self-created ~/My Apps folder. That has the advantage of being assignable to the Finder window sidebar without ambiguity, which is more than can be said for ~/Applications.\nFinally, as I write this I wonder if the thinking behind ~/Applications is that apps stored there will appear in Launchpad?\n\nA: ~\\Applications isn't created during the installation of the OS, you have to create it by yourself. Once you create it, it is recognized as an \"application folder\" and the Finder will show the proper icon for the folder.\nIt has been like this since Tiger, at least. I'm not aware if Lion creates it automatically as mine was already there when I upgraded to Lion.\n\nA: I think you are correct, there is no mention of ~/Applications in this Apple's  previous documentation but it is mentioned in the documentation for Launchpad in Lion (it does exactly what you suggest). \nIt makes sense that Apple has now created this for people who like to have per user apps, but still want to use Launchpad.\n", "Q: Can I copy by highlighting and paste by middle click on Mac OS X? I was using Linux for the last couple of years and I find it extremely useful to copy text by highlighting it as well as to paste by clicking a middle mouse button.\nI'm using a Mac now and I wonder if I can achieve such behaviour on Mac OS X.\n\nA: Create the following Automator service:\n\nAssign it a keystroke, like ⌘⌥shiftcontrol] (something unlikely to conflict with anything). Then, use BetterTouchTool to assign that keystroke to the middle mouse button.\nThe middle shell script comes from this fine answer. The first shell script copies the selection to the clipboard, the middle script clicks the mouse at its current location, and the AppleScript sends a ⌘V to paste the contents of the clipboard\n\nA: I wrote a free little C program that does something similar to Gilligan's answer. Whenever you drag-highlight or double-click text, it copies to the clipboard buffer. Then you can middle-mouse-click in any window to paste it. It is called \"macpaste\" and on Github (https://github.com/lodestone/macpaste). It works globally for every program I use that has textual data.\nIn iTerm2, disable their middle-click in Preferences, otherwise you'll get double pastes.\n\nA: After highlighting text in the Terminal, I can middle-click to paste it back into the Terminal without using the copy/paste keyboard shortcuts. This does not seem to work when the text comes from other applications ie. I can't copy text from TextEdit and then paste into Terminal with a middle-click. I am running Lion and I did not have configure anything to get this default behavior. I'm not sure about other versions of OS X.\n\nA: You can try BetterTouchTool. You can assign custom trackpad, mouse, and keyboard events to trigger specific actions on a global or application-specific basis.\nHere's my configuration to bind a three-finger tap to ⌘V (as this is the global paste shortcut. Alternatively you can select from dozens of other trackpad and mouse gestures to emulate the paste command.\n\n\nA: The macOS terminal can do copy/paste with two separate buffers:\n\n\n*\n\n*The copy/paste buffer which is shared with all other applications. It can be accessed by CommandC/CommandV.\n\n*A separate copy/past buffer which is shared only between (macOS) terminals. It can be filled (copy) by dragging over the text by mouse, double clicking, or ShiftCommand double-clicking for file names (no CommandV). The content of this buffer is pasted by the middle mouse button, by ShiftCommandV, or by Command + two-finger-click.\n\n\nA: I don't think there is a way in general but some programs will accept the middle button as paste \ne.g.\n\n\n*\n\n*Aquamacs - an OSX configured emacs\n\n*iTerm2 - a replacement for Terminal\nFor newer mice/trackballs clicking the scroll wheel acts as a third button\n\nA: I tried the Automator script suggested by Daniel. It did NOT work for me on OS X 10.10.\nI was able to make BetterTouchTool (v 1.15), alone, work for some applications. Like this:\n\nI did Left Mouse twice for several reasons. The first one usually only changes the focus to the new window, but does not position the cursor. Also, clicking in a text box usually selects all of the text, which is then deleted when something is pasted there. I usually want the original text to stay.\nGilligan\n\nA: Select Text to be copied, then Drag and Drop your selection (White Plus sign in red circle will be displayed with the cursor). This will copy-paste the text.\nYou can Drag and Drop inside Terminal or between apps.\n\nA: I would like to add that, if the problem is, as it was with me, that you couldn't get stuff that was highlit in an X-Quartz window onto the clipboard, the secret to that is to highlight, then XQuartz menu-> Edit -> Copy.  That way, it is available for paste in every ordinary Mac OS app.\n\nA: In majority of terminals you can drag and drop the highlighted text or alternatively you can use:\n Shift + ⌘ + v \nIt will act like in Linux pressing middle-mouse button ( is a copy and paste together)\n\nA: The following Karabiner Complex Modification maps the middle mouse button to ⌘V and shift middle mouse button to ⇧⌘V:\n{\n  \"title\": \"Edit-related mappings\",\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"MouseButton3 to Cmd+v: Paste\",\n      \"manipulators\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"basic\",\n          \"from\": {\n            \"pointing_button\": \"button3\",\n            \"modifiers\": {\n              \"optional\": [\n                \"caps_lock\"\n              ]\n            }\n          },\n          \"to\": [\n            {\n              \"pointing_button\": \"button1\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"key_code\": \"v\",\n              \"modifiers\": [\n                \"command\"\n              ]\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Shift+MouseButton3 to Shift+Cmd+v: Pasteboard\",\n      \"manipulators\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"basic\",\n          \"from\": {\n            \"pointing_button\": \"button3\",\n            \"modifiers\": {\n              \"mandatory\": [\n                \"shift\"\n              ],\n              \"optional\": [\n                \"caps_lock\"\n              ]\n            }\n          },\n          \"to\": [\n            {\n              \"pointing_button\": \"button1\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"key_code\": \"v\",\n              \"modifiers\": [\n                \"shift\",\n                \"command\"\n              ]\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nThe following maps the left mouse button to perform ⌘C after selection:\n    {\n      \"description\": \"MouseButton1 to Cmd+c: Copy\",\n      \"manipulators\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"basic\",\n          \"from\": {\n            \"pointing_button\": \"button1\",\n            \"modifiers\": {\n              \"optional\": [\n                \"caps_lock\"\n              ]\n            }\n          },\n          \"to_if_alone\": [\n            {\n              \"pointing_button\": \"button1\",\n              \"halt\": true\n            }\n          ],\n          \"to_if_held_down\": [\n            {\n              \"pointing_button\": \"button1\"\n            }\n          ],\n          \"to_after_key_up\": [\n            {\n              \"key_code\": \"c\",\n              \"modifiers\": [\n                \"command\"\n              ]\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n\n\nBehavior of using this rule is a bit delayed.

I'd like to use a snippet of a song I have purchased as a ringtone for my iPhone. Is this possible using only iTunes?\nI have found a few guides on the web, but I can't seem to complete this task following these guides. I might be misunderstanding something, or the guides are out-of-date, or incomplete.\nI am looking for a solution that will be useful for an extended period of time, for others who see this question. There are similar older questions, but I'm interested in iTunes version 10 on the Mac.\n\nA: As far as I'm concerned (this has worked for my iPhone, and is covered in this guide as well), it works like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Import Settings, choose the AAC Encoder.\n\n*Go to the library and right-click the song you want to use. Select Info, and then the Options tab.\n\n*Here, set a time period using the Start and Stop markers. This period shouldn't exceed 40 seconds.\n\n\nNow, let's convert it to the appropriate format.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click OK, and right-click the song again. Select \"Create AAC Version\".\n\n*Locate the newly created AAC file (\"Show in Finder\" works on a Mac). It should reside in the same folder as the original, or in your iTunes library. Its extension will be .m4a.\n\n*Rename the extension from m4a to m4r.\n\n\nClean up and re-import:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the AAC file from your iTunes library (do not move it to the Recycling Bin/Trash though)\n\n*Re-import the m4r file by dragging it into iTunes\n\n*Drag the newly imported file to your iPhone\n\n\nA: Personally, I use the same method as @slhck. However, if you had any trouble following his instructions, here is a handy-dandy webpage for you to use that comes with helpful pictures! \n\nA: Use GarageBand.

Is there any official AppleScript documentation? If so, where can I find it?\n\nA: Almost all of the Mac developer documentation from Apple exists in several places. That being said, you want the unofficial Mac OS X Automation guide put together by Sal Soghoian. He also has a fabulous book on the iBook store titled AppleScript 1-2-3.\nXcode is the tool that links into these libraries and allows you to search across the various user guides, developer guides, language specifications, code examples and such.\nHere is Xcode (with 10.6 and 10.7 documentation sets) and a quick AppleScript search.\n\nXcode makes it easier to bookmark, search and use the documentation rather than just browsing in Safari since it will download the whole\nOf the 232 matches in the System Guides - about 10 cover AppleScript in depth - the rest refer to how programs make themselves available to be scripted by AppleScript.\n\nA: The official AppleScript language guide can be found in archive here.\n", "Q: Windows Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V on a Mac Mini Is it possible to run Windows Server R2 with Hyper-V virtualization on a Mac Mini (via BootCamp)? I am looking for a new server for my dev enviroment. A Mac Mini would be nice since I can take it with me to a customer site.\n\nA: The short answer is yes. \nAccording to the official Hyper-V system requirements page, in order to run it you need a processor that supports Intel-VT (Virtualization Technology). Most processors today support this, but to be sure I checked on the official Mac mini tech specs page as well as the Intel's list of processors that support Intel-VT. \nFrom this, we can see that the i5 processor found on the Mac mini supports Intel-VT. I recommend upgrading the RAM if possible. Also, make sure that you are running one of the supported operating systems for Hyper-V. Hope this helps. \n", "Q: iTunes not playing all songs in a playlist I'm sure this has been asked before, but I can't seem to search for the right terms. I have a playlist in iTunes that has over 200 songs in it, yet when on Shuffle, iTunes plays the same 15-20 songs over and over. I created the playlist over a year ago and listen at work almost every day, and there are dozens of songs that have never been played unless I turn off shuffle and manually select them to play.\nI know Shuffle is random, and that true mathematical randomness means it's just as likely that you'd hear the same song 10 times in a row as that you'd hear 10 different songs, but isn't there some way to force iTunes to play all the songs in a playlist when it's on Shuffle?\nI'm currently running iTunes 10.4 on a Mac (Snow Leopard), but this is true on other versions and operating systems as well.\n\nA: iTunes defines the random order of the tracks when you first specify set \"Shuffle\".  (This is so that the skip forward / backward buttons work in a reasonable manner.)  If you never turn Shuffle on or off, that order is never changed.  Just disable and then re-enable Shuffle to get a new random order of tracks. \nFor more detail, see Why isn't iTunes shuffle random?.  \n\nA: The only success I've had replicating this behavior is when I've unchecked some of the songs in a standard playlist. When I do this and play with shuffle turned on only the checked songs play. Perhaps this is your issue.\nIf you don't see any checkboxes on the left go to Preferences | General and check the box that says Show list checkboxes.\n\nA: Hey I have faced the same problem, and I did not get the correct answer. But after some hit n trail I got the solution:\nRight Click on playlist from left panel >> select Add to Up Next option. Enjoy  \n\nA: My solution to 'not playing all songs in a playlist (in my case, not doing continuous play one song after another; or in 'shuffle') was quick and embarrassingly easy - the shaded box in front of songs' titles did not have a check mark. Mystery as to how the check marks had disappeared?!?\nI did not notice this right off so I wasted time trying different things. So, I suggest step 1, make sure the boxes are checked.\n\nA: Did you try going into the song properties (right-click song choose \"Get Info\") and from he \"Options\" tab de-select the tick that is in \"Skip When Shuffling\"? \n\nA: Select all songs in playlist.(click on 1st song, hold shift key and click on last song) Right click. click on \"Check Selection\" All songs will be selected and they will all play.\n\nA: Itunes is really annoying on this point, the workaround is fairly easy though, shuffle the tracks until they look like an order you are happy with, then click on a track and select all (cmd A). Right click and click play next, iTunes will then play every track in the order shown on your screen. If there are lots of tracks in your list that iTunes never play, click at the top of the column headed 'plays' and the list will be reordered so that you can then scroll to the part of the list with no play and select just those tracks, right click and 'play next', you can then listen to all the tracks that iTunes refuses to play! :) Now I have given you all that information iTunes will probably change the programme again so that you won't get all your tracks :( Good luck music buffs! \n\nA: Under the Play/Pause, FF and Rewind buttons, there is a Shuffle button and a Repeat button. Make sure the Repeat button in Not selected. This worked for me.\n\nA: Right click on the song. Click \"Check Selection\". :) Worked for me!\n", "Q: Do I need a clean install of Lion if I want to defragment my disk? My 2009 MacBook Pro has been running very slow and glitchy under Snow Leopard. I've come to the conclusion that working with large files and repeatedly filling the hard disk to 95% capacity has likely resulted in fragmentation.\nWith this specific problem in mind, what is the simplest recommended upgrade path for Lion? I've created a bootable clone of my disk with CCC (plus a time machine backup on another drive).\nCurrently leaning towards wiping the disk, running iDefrag, restoring from the clone then installing Lion. Is there a simpler or otherwise better route?\n\nA: Mac OS X defragments small files on the go, and has a hot file optimization zone where medium sized and frequently accessed files get ordered on the fast part of a hard drive.\nIf a tool does a block copy of the drive - fragmentation of files and directories gets moved to the copy destination. When you create a CCC clone, you are not copying the fragmentation state of each file--each file gets written as a single extent on disk. Likewise when you restore from the clone. So if you just wiped and restored from the clone, you'd be starting clean right there.\nThe apple Disk Utility can be told to do a file level copy or a block level copy - so for a one time copy - it's about as capable as CCC and SuperDuper.\nIf you're at 95%, it seems to me that a bigger problem is that the operating system can't allocate as much virtual memory as it would want, which would result in a lot of disk thrashing as it constantly clears out the limited VM space it has, which would be consistent with the problems you are reporting. Solution: bigger or emptier hard drive.\n\nA: You can free up a ton of hard drive space on your existing system by several methods.\n\nDo not try any of these unless you have the means to make a complete backup of your system first, so you can restore any files that you delete that you decide you must restore later.\n\n1) Run MonoLingual to remove Mac OS X language and help files for languages that you do not speak. This can free up as much as 1GB on some systems. Be careful.\n2) Delete the contents of /Library/Printers/. This can free up another 2 to 3GB in some cases. When you next reboot and need to print something, Snow Leopard or Lion will prompt you to download the drivers for just the models of printers you actually use.\n3) iDVD, iMovie, iPhoto, and GarageBand have huge support files, many GB in size, full of themes and sound libraries and other things you can temporarily do without. If you have your original DVD installer for iLife, you can re-install those later. Manually remove these support files, which are found in places including \n\n\n*\n\n*/Library/Audio/Apple Loops/\n\n*/Library/Application Support/GarageBand/\n\n*/Library/Application Support/iDVD/\n\n*/Library/Application Support/iPhoto/\nTotal savings, another 3 to 5GB.\n4) Use the free OmniDiskSweeper program to examine your hard drive and find all the large directories of files to look for other things to delete. Be very careful and make sure you have a backup of anything you are eliminating. \n5) Empty your Trash. Some users put many GB in the Trash and never empty it. That's disk space you should free up. \n6) Be aware of other user accounts on your hard drive other than your own. Under those accounts there may be huge cache files that need clearing, Trash that needs emptying, or large documents or directories of files you can archive and then delete.\n\nA: If you've got a bootable external drive, I would recommend Drive Genius. You can defragment, repair, rebuild, clone, etc. I've used it for years (along with Disk Warrior) and love it.\n\nA: Given a glitchy OS - I try to avoid any efforts to clean / prune / optimize as that can really cause you grief if the system is already unstable.\nThe price of a USB hard drive has to be compared to how much your time and potential loss of files will be. If you can borrow or obtain a USB drive - you get a much better path and chance of Lion success.\nUse Disk Utility to Restore the boot drive to the external drive. That article has you restoring to a disk image. This is nice, but you can't boot from it to test the copy. You might instead just erase the external drive first, and then do the copy to the drive as a whole. By not checking the \"erase disk\" option, the disk utility will copy the files one by one - which will undo any directory as well as file fragmentation. The external drive will be perfectly set up and you can even boot from that drive to be sure it copied everything and is a good copy.\nThen you can set aside that drive and erase the Snow Leopard - do a clean install on the internal drive, upgrade to Lion and only connect the backup when it asks if you want to migrate in from an external backup.\nBest of luck - there are other ways to go - but I want something cheap, and sure and would rather you spent the money on a good new drive than software that defragments your drive in place. You can always defragment by using disk utility once you understand that the fragmentation is part the directory structure itself and part where the large files land. \nThe system since 10.5 defragments small files on the fly and will relocate the most used files to a fast portion of a spinning hard drive, so it's really hard to get in a bind until you get past 90% full on a drive.\n", "Q: How to use Dropbox for applications with Lion Versions support? I have several Numbers files that I sync between my laptop and desktop. I upgraded both machines to Lion and the latest version of Numbers. I love the Versions feature: many of these spreadsheets that change over time and Versions will be he very helpful.\nBut then I realized that Versions and Dropbox don't really interoperate effectively. Versions uses a hidden directory (.DocumentVersions-V100) at the root level to store the version history. Since that hidden directory isn't sync'd, all of the previous versions aren't available on all of the computers. I'm still experimenting, but it seems like the only way that a previous version is available is if it is explicitly opened in the application. If it has been changed (and enough time has passed since the last captured version) then it is stored in the version history.\nI've thought about using some sort of Hazel rule or folder action, but there just isn't enough information at the filesystem available to make that effective.\nDoes anyone know if Dropbox has any plans regarding Versions? I expect that they've done some thinking about this issue.\nDoes anyone know how iCloud will handle this issue? Since it's native to Lion perhaps it will sync the version history as well.\nBarring that, does anyone have any workarounds or best practices?\n\nA: My take on this is that Apple does not want users to see iCloud as another Dropbox or (even worse) another iDisk. Although I am not certain of what I about to write, my theory on iCloud based on what I have read so far is that there will not be an iDisk-like drive or a Dropbox-like special folder. Instead, iCloud's approach will be app-centric in that you will open the app you want and then get your files from iCloud regardless of which iPad, iPhone or Mac you're using at the time. In the practical sense, that most likely means that iCloud will \"magically\" get you the latest file as you switch contexts, but not the file's Versions history--that will be for now a Lion-only feature. \nI do not anticipate Dropbox integrating with Versions or iCloud any time soon because it is not in the best interest of Dropbox for you to use iCloud and vice-versa. Especially considering how both have a vested interested in earning your storage needs business (And this is even more true for Dropbox than it is for Apple). At the technical level, there is no reason why they wouldn't be able to coexist: Lion would see the Dropbox folder as any other folder and allow you to keep its Versions history. Dropbox, in turn, will see the hidden folders used by Versions as folders it needs to sync up--unless Dropbox does not currently support syncing hidden folders. I have not tested to see what Dropbox does with them \nIt is important to remember that Dropbox's very own version history is kept at their server. That means that there would not be a physical conflict between the historic files Dropbox keeps track of and what Lion keeps track on that same folder for Versions. It will be up to you to choose where to go and look: On Lion's friendly Versions UI or on Dropbox's web-based file history. Of course, the caveat is that the individual historic entries won't be exactly the same. I guess you can say there will be two \"versions\" of the same story (pun intended). \nI do not think there is a need for a workaround as there really is no technical conflict. iCloud and Dropbox will both do their thing and I will probably end up using Versions in Lion to browse the file history of all of my files, even those in the Dropbox folder, because it is friendlier to use. If I cannot use Versions on a particular file because its app doesn't yet support it, and if this is a file that I have in Dropbox, then I will go and take a look at the Dropbox website to get its version history. Hope this helps. \n\nA: Apple designed Versions to be separated from the file, so when the file leaves the computer, you only get the most recent version.  I don't think Dropbox will interfere with this issue, because you may not know that Dropbox has built in file versioning.  It isn't as pretty as Apple, but you can access the past 30 days of versions by logging in on the Dropbox website, finding your file, and right-clicking on it.  Then, press previous versions.  If there are previous versions, Dropbox will show them for about thirty days.  However, if you have a Pro account, you can enable unlimited versions with Pack-Rat at https://www.dropbox.com/help/113.  And these versions don't even count against your storage quota.\n", "Q: Is it safe to run a Mac Mini (i5) on its side? I recently got a Mac Mini with the i5 chip. Is it OK to set it on its side and run it that way? I wanted to shrink the footprint.\n\nA: Sure.  Just make sure it is in a secure position so it doesn't fall over.  \nApple actually has a support page on this:  http://support.apple.com/kb/TA22804\n\nA: No it's not. It will heat up fast.\n", "Q: Add a song into a playlist while listening to it? Is there a button to add the song that is being currently played into a playlist on my iPhone?\nSo i don't have to search it back and add it manually?\n\nA: No - the playlists only get curated from the playlist tab.\nThe iPods with physical buttons have an \"add to playlist\" functionality that worked this way but there's nothing yet in iOS 4 or less to do a similar thing. The drawback there is everything got added to the \"on the go\" playlist - not an arbitrary one.\n\nA: After listening to your song, go to the playlist, hit edit and at the top left you'll see a plus sign. Hit that and go to recently played (under playlists). You'll see the song- tap the plus sign on the right of the song and it will add it to the playlist. Make sure you are editing the playlist you want it added to. \n\nA: All of those suggestions are great! Now if you have a Jailbroken Iphone you can download \"SCALE\" from Cydia. This will give you the option to add songs that you are currently playing directly to any of your new playlists. This also gives you the share to Facebook or Twitter so even better. \n\nA: I've done something sort of like this. It doesn't add a track to a playlist—it adds metadata to a track, and you can have a smart playlist where tracks are selected based on that metadata. I then use a macro facility (Quicksilver) to assign a key command to that script.\nI've used the \"Grouping\" metadata field -- technically, this is supposed to be reserved for movements in classical music, but I couldn't find any tracks that actually use this field, so I felt OK about misusing it. If that bothers you, you could easily change this to use the \"Comments\" field.\nHere's the script. It's very simple.\n  tell application \"iTunes\"\n    try\n    -- change \"keyword\" below. Keep the quotes! \n    if \"keyword\" is not in grouping of current track then\n        set x to grouping of current track\n        if x = \"\" then\n            set grouping of current track to \"keyword\"\n        else\n            set grouping of current track to x & \", keyword\"\n        end if\n    end if\n    end try\n  end tell\n\nOpen Applescript Editor, paste the above into a new script, and save it as a script file with whatever name you want to [username]/Library/iTunes/Scripts (if the Scripts folder doesn't already exist, create it). You can invoke it from the Scripts menu in iTunes once you've done that, or use some kind of macro software to create a keyboard command.\nThen create a Smart Playlist in iTunes where the criterion is \"grouping contains [keyword]\"\n\nA: You can add to any playlist while listening to music!  Go to the playlist you want to add to hit the edit button, then the plus sign.  This will bring up your library on your phone and you can choose whichever songs you want to add to it.  Of course Mac would have that, otherwise it defeats the purpose of the device.  \n", "Q: iPhone: Settings > Safari > Databases no longer visible All,\nI'm trying to see the local storage databases on my iPhone.\nA variety of Google searches made this clear - if you go to \"Settings\", then \"Safari\" - you'll see a \"Database\" panel (just under \"Accept Cookies...\")\nHowever, on MY iPhone - \"Databases\" is not listed.\nI'm 99.9% sure that I HAVE databases on my phone:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm testing an HTML5 application that uses a database.

I've also noticed that the problem may appear in certain spots on the website, like the header, or an ad on Facebook. \nHere's a screenshot of oDesk.com in Safari 5.1 (7534.48.3)\n\nAnd here's a comparison in Chrome (13.0.782.112)\n\nThe problem only cropped up today but it's really frustrating as Safari is my main browser. I've tried deleting the Preferences file but that didn't solve the problem. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.\n\nA: Fixed-width text not appearing correctly in Safari after Lion upgrade\nThis is a known bug. Check the link above and see if my instructions fix it for you.\n\nA: The what is easy - safari can't find the exact font or a close substitute. Chrome either includes that font or has a different default font or slightly different substitution path.\nThe why can be much more individual or nuanced.\nSome likely causes will have you using Font Book.\n\n\n*\n\n*The font Safari chose to substitute is disabled.\n\n*If the font database has issues - the substitution process isn't as robust until it's rebuilt (you can test this by booting in safe mode).\n\n*If the font itself is corrupt - it needs to be reinstalled.\n\n*If a bug results in strict interpretation  - substitution doesn't happen.\n\n\nSince each OS (Lion, Snow Leopard, and older) is a little different - the best bet is to open font book and validate your fonts. Pay attention to any fonts that might be disabled as well.\nThe built-in help menu will have \"troubleshooting\" steps that eventually have you call AppleCare since a hardware / hard drive could be the root cause once you've cleaned up the fonts and made sure it's not just a duplicate or font database issue.\n\nA: You seem to be reporting a similar (but not identical) problem to the one I'm encountering here. Wish I had an answer.\n\nA: From Apple Support Communities:\n\nRestart in safe mode than normal boot. If that doesn't do the trick, run Font Book and validate all fonts.\n\n\nA: I had the same problem.\nI simply copied one of the display characters (\"A\")from the webpage and pasted it in to \"simple text\" and right click to show font.  I saw it was \"ARIAL\"  then went to Font Book and fixed that font (Arial.) That's it, problem solved!\nI hope this works for you\n", "Q: What is the best dropbox compatible iPad app for MS office documents? It's pretty simple. I just got an iPad and want to get the best app to edit word documents that I have saved in my dropbox. There are many options: pages, quick office, docs to go, office2.\nI am looking to be able to browse documents within DropBox and tap edit to open them in the editor. I'll make a few changes and expect to be able to tap save and have it automatically update DropBox. \n\nA: I'm a professional writer, I've tried out a bunch of these apps, and I prefer Dataviz’s Documents to Go Premium, which creates and edits Microsoft Office documents (Word, Excel, PowerPoint). The great thing about the Premium version (and justifies the extra $6 over the basic version) is that it connects with the Dropbox online storage service. Documents to Go does a good job of editing Word documents, including maintaining styles, etc.\n\nA: My father uses DocsToGo and he´s happy. But he doesn't have a mac. But he said that it works very well for him.\n\nA: Documents To Go now trumps QuickOffice after QO dropped support for Dropbox. Also has a more friendly and flexible interface. \n\nA: Quickoffice is a great app, but it no longer supports Dropbox. \n", "Q: Can I set custom album artwork that isn't included in one of the songs? I have a couple of albums in iTunes that are \"Various Artists\" compilations, and the kicker is that each song has it's own artwork.\nIs it possible to add album artwork only to the \"album\", and not to any individual song, so that I'd see the logo for the game/album on the main iTunes/iOS album view, instead of the first song of the album's art?\n\nA: Yes, you can do this a few different ways depending on whether you want to preserve the current artwork or are OK overwriting it.\nWay 1 — Simple if you are OK overwriting the current artwork.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select all of the songs you would like to share the same album artwork.\n\n*Type Command-I.\n\n*You may see a dialog asking \"Are you sure you want to edit information for multiple items?\" if so click, \"Yes\" to continue.\n\n*You will see a editor like this: \n\n*Drag the image you want as the album artwork for these songs onto the well labeled Artwork.\n\n*Click OK and you're done.\n\n\nWay 2 — If you want to preserve the current artwork.\niTunes allows songs to have multiple artwork files associated with them. It displays the first artwork file as the album art for a particular song. Here's the slightly more painful way you could add your artwork to these songs.\n\n\n*\n\n*In the main iTunes window make sure that you have the small album art window displayed in the lower left. You can toggle it's visibility by clicking the icon near the bottom left that looks like this: \n\n*Select the songs you want to add art to.\n\n*Drag your new art onto the cover in the lower left. \n\n*Your art has been appended to the end of the stack of images associated with this file.\n\n*Now the annoying part: you have to open the info panel for each file by selecting it and hitting Command-I.\n\n*For each file move the new image to the top of the stack to make it the default album image and click OK. \n\n*Once you complete step 5&6 for each file you're done.\n\n\nA: As far as I know, iTunes always have to take the album cover from one of the songs in the album, so making a dummy \"song\" just for the album cover (as explained in this answer seems to be the only way.\nI noticed some quirks however:\n\n\n*\n\n*While iTunes for Windows takes the album cover from track number 1, iOS takes the album cover from the first song in the album to be transferred onto the device. \n\n*Because I only care about playing the album on iOS, I only wrote the same album and album artist into the dummy \"song\", and transferred it first onto the iDevice, before transferring the real album contents.\n\n*I tried deleting the dummy \"song\" afterwards, but that made the album cover turn into that of one of the songs again. So the dummy \"song\" cannot be deleted.\n\n\nPS: I only tested on iTunes for Windows 12.6.5 and iOS 10.3.3. Results may differ on other platforms and versions.\n\nA: I came up with a workaround by adding a blank audio file to the beginning of my album with the cover art that I want displayed as the album cover but preserving each individual songs album art.\n\n\n*\n\n*Find a blank audio file.  I used this one https://github.com/anars/blank-audio/blob/master/500-milliseconds-of-silence.mp3\n\n*Add the file to iTunes\n\n*Change the blank audio's cover art with the album cover that you want.  In the metadata set song: Album Cover, album: same name as your compilation, track: 1\n\n*Select all the files to be a compilation.  If the album is all ready organized into a compilation unset compilation for all the songs and then change it back with the blank file included.  As long as the blank file is the first in order iTunes should use it's album art as the cover album art.\n\n\nYou may be able to delete the empty audio file after this.\n", "Q: Can I repartition my primary hard drive without removing the Lion recovery partition? Scenario:\nI boot into Recovery mode and open Disk Utility. Then I select the primary hard drive and choose 1 partition. Will that destroy the recovery partition as well?\n\nA: No destruction will happen - This repartitioning you propose is possible to safely do. \nThe recovery partition won't modify itself (since it's in use) and will survive attempts to erase itself when it's in charge.\nYou also can resize things in general when booted from the main OS as long as files that are stored in the area being trimmed are mobile and not in-use or locked. \nYou have to enable a debug mode for Disk Utility to see and work on the Recovery HD so it's planned to be something you have to know a trick and go out of your way to tamper with. (Note: Debug mode is removed in 10.11 with the redesigned Disk Utility app)\n", "Q: Stock widget doesn't save list of stocks I am running Lion and I wanted to add certain stocks to the Stock widget. I was able to add them fine and remove the default ones but everytime I go back to Dashboard the Stock widget is reset and the default stocks appear. Does anyone now how this can be fixed?\n\nA: If you haven't removed the widget from the widget screen, do try that. Press the circle with a plus on the lower left and then the x on the top left corner of all the stock widgets on your dashboard (you can add more than one). If it's still broken when you add it fresh to the dashboard, you'll have to poke it a bit harder.\nThe widget isn't going to like this - so you'll have to manually clear out the file where the stocks are recorded.\nGet ready to log out so save all your work and quit all apps.\nGo to the folder below in Finder using this command (or the Go menu) shift+command+G\n~/Library/Preferences\nMove these two files only to your desktop. \nwidget-com.apple.widget.stocks.plist\nwidget-com.apple.widget.stocks.plist.lockfile\n\nThen log out shift+command+Q\nWhen you log back in (or reboot), the widget will make a new container to store your stocks and things should be better. This little dance is called setting aside your preferences (plist files) and starting again with the defaults.\nIf it works, you can trash the two files on your desktop. If not - you can move them back or not however you prefer. For an app with lots of settings, it's nice to be able to move back the ones you prefer once you've ruled out that file as causing you some pain or other.\n\nA: Go to the ~/Library/Preferences/widget-com.apple.widget.stocks.plist file, highlight the file name and use Get Info (Command ⌘ + I) to change permissions for \"Everyone\" from \"No access\" to \"Read & Write\"\nThis will cause the list to be retained and updates to populate even when the market is closed. The only caution is this: once you have done this, if you remove and re-add the widget, while it will have preserved your list, the re-add will also have changed the permissions for the \"Everyone\" back to \"No access\", so you'll need to follow these instructions again.\n\nA: Try re-downloading the widget. This isn't the Apple widget, but you can also try this one.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use Linux USB drivers on Mac OS X? I have a USB device that I use on a daily basis and it has Linux and Windows drivers. I would like to use this device in Mac OS X (meaning not through a VM). Is it possible?\nedit\nSystem requirements from the read me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux 2.4 or 2.6\n\n*System setup for kernel compilation.\n\n\nA: No, because of completely different executable-architectures.\nOnly if you're willing to recompile them for OSX and they're Darwin based.\n", "Q: How do I make an AppleScript with a drop-down menu without Xcode? How do I make an AppleScript that displays a drop-down menu without using Xcode?\n\nA: One option would be to use CocoaDialog**:\nset l to {\"aa\", \"bb\", \"cc\"}\nset choices to \"\"\nrepeat with x in l\n    set choices to choices & quoted form of x & \" \"\nend repeat\nset dialog to paragraphs of (do shell script \"/Applications/CocoaDialog.app/Contents/MacOS/CocoaDialog\" & \" standard-dropdown --title title --text text --items \" & choices)\nif item 1 of dialog is \"2\" then return -- pressed cancel button\nitem ((item 2 of dialog) + 1) of l\n\n\nYou could also just use choose from list:\nchoose from list {\"aa\", \"bb\", \"cc\"} with title \"Title\" with prompt \"Please choose\" default items \"bb\" with multiple selections allowed\n\n\n\n** The original URL for this Github repo by mstratman has changed.  From research it seems CocoaDialog has transitioned to an org.  Here are the new changes:\n\n\n*\n\n*URL\n\n*Github\n\n*Repo pertaining to the previous answer\n\n\nA: There is no built in concept of a menu in the dialogs-alerts within the AppleScript language. \nThe closest you could do would be to name some dummy files (in a temporary folder) with the appropriate action and have the user choose the file labeled with the action you wanted to perform.\nopen folder blah\n  with selected file bah\n    do whatever\n\nA horrendous \"solution\" to a problem that needs a cocoa menu - whether you make it in Xcode or someone else does - Xcode/IB is the tool that creates a menu. MacRuby is a nice way to script an app that needs a more full featured UI than AppleScript. You don't need Xcode/IB to ruby up an app from pure script.\nYou could create a NIB using Interface Builder and script it all using AppleScript, but the nib defines the menu itself - not AppleScript (even if AppleScript can populate or delete the menu items at run time).\n\nA: Additionally, if you just need a list to choose from, you could also do \nchoose from list listYouDefined with prompt \"Choose from the list.\" \nGoogle \"AppleScript Choose from list\".\n\nA: I understand this is an old question but since the best up-voted answer says in the documentation for CocoaDialog 2:\n\nDownloads do not work Downloads for cocoadialog 2 are no longer\n  available. This is mostly in part due to the various changes and lack\n  of permanent storage over the years.\n\nand 3 isn't coming till Spring/Summer 18 I was searching for other alternatives and I found Pashua:\n\n(pic taken from the site)\nUnder the documentation this is called a popup:\nExample: Using popup\np.type = popup\np.label = Example popup menu\np.width = 310\np.option = Popup menu item #1\np.option = Popup menu item #2\np.option = Popup menu item #3\np.default = Popup menu item #2\n\nScreenshot:\n\nGithub repo\nAfter using it I found you can install the Pashua.app in your Application directory or you can embed Pashua in your app.  I'm not the author of this but I needed a base solution for a GUI and this wasn't mentioned. \n\nA: You don't need Xcode for AppleScript. Just open the AppleScript Editor in Applications/Utilities (Finder shortcut for the Utilities folder: ⌘ Command+Shift+U). There is some sample code for dropdown menus on MacScripter: Dropdown menu.\n", "Q: Why does my MacBook Pro say \"Not charging\" when plugged in? I have the latest 2011 Macbook Pro. Sometimes I notice that even when I'm plugged in, the battery status says \"Not charging\" even when I unplug it and the battery is at 35%. \nThis mainly seems to happen if my laptop is under load. I had some flash thing going and I could hear the fan. Once I closed flash it started charging again. This can be very annoying if I want to unplug and take my laptop somewhere.\nWhy isn't my MBP charging?\n\nA: I've noticed it with ours too. Try completely unplugging the charger from both the MBP and the wall outlet. Besides that, just make sure that when you plug your computer is plugged in, the green/amber light is on.\n\nA: Some obvious causes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Need to wait 30 to 60 seconds for the SMC to read the battery and decide what to do\n\n*check for pencil lead/debris on the mac end of the magsafe\n\n*check for pins stuck down on the magsafe cord end of things\n\n*The SMC needs to be reset on the Mac\n\n*The battery, all adapter or charging circuitry itself is faulty or detecting something that causes a pause and the mac might need service. (This is exactly what your mac will do if it needs an 85 watt adapter but you've somehow gotten your \"friend's\" 65 watt adapter - if your adapter isn't putting out enough power, the mac can only run and not support the CPU/GPU load as well as the charging circuitry. Similarly, if the battery is drawing more than designed, the mac will prefer to run than charge and tells you this in the not charging message.)\n\n\nDue to the way batteries work, they can be out of tolerance / spec at only a specific portion of the entire voltage range. The sensors will correctly detect “good battery” until you reach that one point where the voltage drops too fast and shows aging or a problem with the cells.\nDo a calibration run at your earliest convenience if your battery doesn’t continuously self regulate and calibrate. Next, think about a visit to the genius bar or other Apple Support / service desk if the problem continues. Take your wall adapter with you when you go as it can be checked with the mac together.\n\nA: We had the same issue with our new 17\" MBP at work. We contacted Apple and they said this was normal behavior. Apparently there are certain situations (e.g. during high CPU/GPU usage) in which the MBP cannot draw enough power form the power adapter, so it must also draw from the battery.\n\nA: I saw this behavior within the first few weeks of getting my Mid 2010 MBP 13\".  It seemed like a simple jiggle of the charger would fix it most of the times.  If that didn't work, unplugging/plugging it back in to the laptop always seemed to do the job.  I'm not exactly sure what caused it in my situation, but I haven't seen it since then (Nov 2010).\n", "Q: MacBook Pro can't output to Panasonic HDTV (P60GT30)? I have a new 15\" MacBook Pro running Lion.  My client has a new 60\" Panasonic (P60GT30) in their conference room. \nThey have a Windows laptop plugged in to the PC input, and it works fine.\nHowever, when I try to connect like ...\nMacBookProThunderboltPort -> Apple MiniDisplayPort-to-VGA dongle -> VGA cable -> TV's PC input \n\n... the MacBook simply will not recognize the TV.\n(Note: The TV actually has a little VGA-to-weirdPanasonicMiniConnector dongle that's needed to connect the TV; but Windows worked fine with it, why not the MacBook?) \nIs there something I need to do for the MacBook to recognize and output to this TV?  Maybe a new driver or something?\n\nA: You may require a TV that has a native HDMI input. VGA is becoming unsupported in many configurations, such as with the iPad 2, and all through the industry, not just with Apple products.\n\nA: There appears to be no way to do what I need.  I'm adding this and marking it 'correct' because I don't want to look like a douche who doesn't mark answers as correct. :(\n", "Q: Backing up a Boot Camp partition I see in the Time Machine options that my Boot Camp partition is excluded. I haven't even tried to remove it from the list of exceptions since I have read that Time Machine will not work with NTFS partitions. Assuming Time Machine won't work with said partition, what is the easiest way to back it up? \nIdeally, the solution would work like Time Machine. The problem I anticipate is that I would need a second disk (formatted as NTFS) to hold the Boot Camp backup--or maybe I could also bi-partition my external hard drive and make an NTFS partition to store the Boot Camp backup? That way I would not need a second physical disk plugged in. \nWhat are your thoughts on backing up Boot Camp partitions? Thanks.\n\nA: You should back up your Windows partition while booted into Windows, using Windows-compatible backup software, and you must backup to an external drive that is NTFS-formatted, whether it is over Ethernet, USB, FireWire or whatever else you can work out. Do not try to use a physical hard drive that has one partition formatted for Mac or Time Machine, and another partition formatted for NTFS. Use a completely separate hard drive.\nDon't try to back your BootCamp Windows system up using Mac OS X outside Windows. You might figure out how to back up some files, but you will not be able to create a bootable \"bare-metal restore\" image, like those people in Windows-land call it.\nWindows Vista and Windows 7 have a good built-in Backup utility that can make a full disk image for a full restore, but only to a hard drive that is NTFS-only. They can also do incremental/differential file backups in a separate procedure. And there are many third-party backup software solutions for Windows, such as Acronis.\n\nTrust me, you will not want to try to do this using an Apple Time Capsule or a drive that has a partition that is formatted for Apple Time Machine. A couple of years ago I actually worked out a procedure for doing this using unsupported features on the Time Capsule, and I regretted it, because it interfered tremendously with my Mac Time Machine files when I needed to do a full restore on my Mac partition on my MacBook Pro.\n\n\nA: Mac OS X cannot write to an NTFS filesystem by default (It's not just a Time Machine limitation), so even if you could back it up, you would lose the extended attributes that it holds when copying the data to a FAT32 filesystem, as well as (more importantly) the ability to restore.\nFor doing whole system restore, there is a freeware program called Winclone but it is not under active development, and may be pre Windows 7.\nIf you want to backup specific areas, like just your Documents and Settings folder, then you may find that accessing the bootcamp partition through Parallels or VMWare Fusion etc will allow you to make backups using the pseudo network drives that they can create to allow cross OS filesharing.\n\nA: we have been using winclone quite successfully but as the name suggests it does not do incremental backups.\n\nA: Winclone has some issues that are hard to quantify.\nAlso, it will not launch under Lion OSX.\nBut it WILL make a totally restorable, bootable version of a BootCamp partition.\n\nA: Just format an external drive to ExFat, this can be done in disk utility on Mac OS, windows and mac can both read write to this, you may think this is the same as Fat32 but its NOT, with fat32 you are restricted to  a maximum file size of 4gig per file, ExFat has no restrictions so you files flow freely between windows and mac.\n\nA: CarbonCopyCloner is free, and can make a backup of any disk, including Bootcamp.\nIt doesn't work exactly the same as time machine, you will not be able to see every version of every file ever backed up. It's a good choice to create a backup copy of almost any disk.\nEdit: As pointed out by Alrescha, CCC cannot make a bootable copy of a windows partition. But it will still make a backup copy of all your files on the windows partition, so it's not completely useless.\n", "Q: Why does my FCE export to DV take forever?

I accidentally put it as exporting to a DV Stream, but I was actually exporting it to a QT movie.\n\n   Render window after sitting all night (probably close to 15 hours)\n\nA: I figured out why it was taking so long. The reason was because I store all my video on an external USB drive. When I exported it, I exported it to that external USB drive. To fix the problem, I exported from the external USB drive to the internal drive.\nUpdate: I also found out that I need to render all my video first, then export it. This dropped the export time from days down to 20-45 minutes. One of my other problems was that I needed to make sure my footage was in the Apple Intermediate Codec format. Then, FCE doesn't have to bend over backwards to accommodate an \"unsupported\" format.\n", "Q: Automatically sync folder contents in the background Since Lion still won't allow me to search the SMB volumes I need, I'm planning on syncing them to a local folder that will be indexed by Spotlight.

I use time machine to backup from the internal 500GB and one external 500GB HD to the second 500 GB HD. This is good till date since I only had to back up less than 250 Gigs in total. \nWhat would happen if and when I exceed the disk space of 500 Gigs? \nCan I use another 500 GB harddisk (in order to horizontally scale) on Time Machine . I need incremental backups like TimeMachine does and I like the interface too. I picked out 500 Gigs as an example. \n\n\n*\n\n*Can I mount 2 external HDs as a single one so that the TimeMachine\ndoes not need to know about it ?\n\n*Does TimeMachine support backing up\nto use multiple harddisks depending on space constraint ?\n\n*How is this problem usually addressed for a non-business requirement ?\n\n\nSairam\n\nA: Yes - there are two ways to do this.\nApple intends and designed Time Machine to work with disks in a sequential manner. You are expected to fill up the first disk and put it on the shelf. Then attach the second and fill it up. You can then go back to the first and this lets you have more history before the oldest backup is reclaimed due to space running out.\nAn alternative is to use Mac OS X built in RAID functionality. You will have to erase all the disks when you put them into a RAID the first time - but you can have two disks with half the data written to each every time a file gets written. This is striping or RAID 0.\nUsing a RAID would mean both drives need to be connected all the time. You would then have one large backup and since Time Machine won't be saving two copies of many files - you will get much longer time for storage using a RAID than the first method of using the drives sequentially. If your boot drive is almost full - I've seen times where the first method could store a month or two of history, but years would fit on the second method. It really depends what files you have and how often they change.\n\nA: When you fill up a Time Machine disk, the Time Machine software starts deleting the oldest backups to make room for the new. I haven't heard it suggested that Apple expects you to put the old drive on a shelf when it gets full. At any rate, I have about 350 GB on my main hard drive and 500 GB stored on my Time Machine backup--and it goes back almost exactly two years. I can live with two-year-old backups getting deleted.\nAnother strategy that I have heard is to have two backup target disks and switch them every week (for example), so that if either one is lost or fails, you've lost relatively little. Time Machine will work with this strategy.\nA RAID 0 would create a bigger virtual disk, but the problem with RAID 0 is that if either disk fails (and with two disks, your odds of failure are doubled), all the files are lost, so this is not a great backup strategy. RAID 0 is mostly used to increase disk speed, not to increase capacity. A similar but slightly less risky approach is to concatenate or span the drives into one virtual drive. In this scenario, if one disk fails, you lose the files that were on that disk, so it's still not a great backup strategy, but you can set up a spanning disk volume in Apple's Disk Utility.\n\nA: I've used Apple Software RAID-0 with four drives for Time Machine since 2007.  It's true that with two drives you have roughly twice the probability of failure.  If you take a  very very small number and double it (or in my case quadruple it), you still have a very small number. I haven't had any failures.\nIn addition, we're talking about backup, not primary storage.  If the array fails, you fix it and start over.  There's a tendency for people who haven't had a backup for ten years to treat their new backup as if it were live data – it's not, it's just a backup.\n", "Q: File browser for iPad Is there an app for the iPad that let's you view an NFS share?\nIt seems like File Browser lets you mount SMB shares and iFiles lets you view different cloud storage sites like Flickr and other file shares such as FTP but neither support NFS or SFTP?

I also have a passcode to open Goodreads.\nMy understanding is that when the iPad is locked, files are encrypted (at least the ones in the Goodreads folder, but not other files?) I'm wondering if even when the iPad is unlocked if the files in the Goodreads folder are protected if Goodreads is not loaded and asking for the passphrase.\nI'm guessing based on my understanding of the manual, but hopefully I'm wrong.\n\nA: My earlier answer was incorrect. iOS 4 does incorporate file system level encryption - impressive!\nThe answer to your question is here:\n\nIt is important to understand that GoodReader itself doesn't encrypt\n  or decrypt your files. It does two things - restricts the access to\n  protected files via GoodReader's own user interface, and asks iOS to\n  encrypt certain files (or all of them, if you're using app startup\n  password). iOS, in its turn, locks these files within a few seconds\n  after you lock your device with a passcode, and instantly unlocks them\n  when you unlock your device with a passcode. It means that when you\n  unlock your device with a passcode, all your files become decrypted\n  and fully accessible, even if GoodReader app is not being run at the\n  moment, and you haven't entered any of GoodReader's passwords yet. So,\n  if your device is unlocked, GoodReader will prevent the access to\n  protected files via its own user interface, but nothing prevents from\n  copying these files via, for example, File Sharing section of iTunes\n  (USB transfer), without knowing GoodReader's passwords. So please be\n  sure to ALWAYS lock your device with a passcode, even if you leave it\n  just for a minute. This will turn the physical hardware-based\n  protection on. And while Auto-Lock option in main device Settings may\n  be of great help with this, it never hurts to manually lock your\n  device every time you leave it.\n\nFrom: \nhttp://www.goodiware.com/gr-man-general.html#dataprot\nPut concisely, while the iPad is unlocked all data is unencrypted, so in principle, hackers could access your files during this time.\n", "Q: connecting a PS2 keyboard to Mac I have a keyboard that has only a PS2 interface.

Is there a way I can downgrade from the Lion OS to the Snow Leopard OS if I bought my laptop in mid 2011?\nThere are plenty of sites (http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2389334,00.asp and http://gigaom.com/apple/how-to-downgrade-from-lion-to-snow-leopard/ are two examples) that demonstrate how to revert back to Snow Leopard if your computer is older and once operated in Snow Leopard. But my MacBook Pro is brand new, and shipped with Lion. Trying to start in recovery mode (command - R at boot) , or from the Snow Leopard disk (C at boot) just results in kernel panics. Running the Snow Leopard disk from the Lion OS results in error messages (\"You can't install this version of the application Install Mac OS X with this version of Mac OS X. You have Install Mac OS X 23.1\"). And the one thing that does give me access to the Snow Leopard Drive (pressing option during startup with the Snow Leopard CD inserted and choosing \"Recovery HD\") only allows me to reinstall the Lion OS, not the Snow Leopard OS.\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: Any time you have problems starting a mac with an installer - do check these three articles:\n\n\n*\n\n*Finding your Mac OS X version and build information\n\n*Mac OS X versions (builds) for computers\n\n*http://support.apple.com/manuals/# - enter your serial number on the page or in place of the # in the URL to determine the exact model of your mac.\n\n\nIn your case - you probably have a MacBook Pro (Early 2011) which will boot from (Mac OS X v10.6.6  Build 10J567) or later. You might see the term \"retail disk\" which means it has drivers for all Macs that can run that level of OS - this is different from the disks that ship with macs - you almost never can use say a MacBook Air restore disk on a MacBook Pro - they just have the drivers for that one model.\nNormally, you could just buy a retail copy but the last 10.6 retail copy I've seen documented is 10.6.3 and is too old. You'll need to order a replacement disk through AppleCare online or via phone (or find someone in possession of your MacBook Pro's install media for Snow Leopard)\nMost Apple Retail stores are set up to image your mac from the factory builds through the genius bar and since your mac is so new, I can't imagine the seller you bought it wouldn't bend over backwards to make sure you got a copy of the appropriate disk (they might even have a service desk that could assist you) \n\nA: What version of Snow Leopard is this?\nYour MacBook Pro's revision originally shipped with a newer build of 10.6.6 (10J3210, 10J3331a, or 10J4139), which means you need either that exact build, or something even newer — 10.6.7 or 10.6.8 will do.\nThe DVD you have, however, likely has an older build, such as 10.6.0, and will therefore lack the necessary drivers.\n\nA: Exact procedure for your specific model of MacBook.\n1) Make a full bootable .img backup of your MacBook to an external hard drive, using a utility such as Carbon Copy Cloner.\n2) Get a friend who has another Mac that can run Snow Leopard 10.6.8. From this other Mac, with yet another external hard drive, and a Snow Leopard install DVD, make a virgin installation of Snow Leopard on the external drive. Run Software Update and install everything, up to 10.6.8 with all patches.\n3) Wipe the hard drive on your MacBook. \n4) Take the external disk that has the virgin full installation of Snow Leopard 10.6.8 and attach it to your MacBook and boot from it.\nUse Carbon Copy Cloner to restore the virgin installation of Snow Leopard 10.6.8 on the external hard drive to over-write the internal hard drive on your MacBook.\n5) Boot your MacBook from the new 10.6.8 installation. Attach the external hard drive with the backup image of your Lion installation, and mount it. Manually copy your documents from your Lion image back to your MacBook with 10.6.8. Don't copy any system settings from Lion back to Snow Leopard. Be extremely judicious about copying anything in any /Library/ folder. Don't copy any applications. Re-install all the applications you need directly onto your MacBook with 10.6.8, from scratch.\nThis procedure will take a full day.\nYou should be familiar with disk cloning, disk formatting,, the use of external drives, Target Disk Mode, and how to boot a Mac into one of several volumes at startup using the Option key. You should also know a lot about installing and configuring applications on Mac and their support files, where they go, and what you can safely copy and what you can't.\nYou may well decide that all this is not worth the trouble, and learn to deal with Lion. It will get better, because Apple and third-party software and hardware companies are hard at work with updates and upgrades to fix all the bugs.\nMy advice is to sit and be patient and work with the system you already have.\n\nA: I figured it out thanks to your comments. Here are the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*CCC from your old SL Macbook Pro to an external disk.\n\n*Boot the new MacBook Pro from the \"Recovery HD\" disk (this is an emergency bootable disk that comes with every new MacBook Pro).\n\n*Use the \"Restore\" command in the disk utility to transfer all the data from your external disk to the \"MacBook HD\" of the new MacBook Pro.\n\n\nAnd that's it! There is probably an even simpler method using Target Disk Mode and a FireWire cable, but unfortunately I did not have access to the latter.\n\nA: Google Mac os x snow leopard 10.6.7 ISO and download the full 7-8 GB ISO make a new partition about 8-10 GB in disk utility open the ISO put all of the files from the ISO to the new partition and boot from the partition and it will boot in to snow leopard \n\nA: Aaditya S, You are saying that Lion 10.7 was pre-installed on your new Mac and you don't like it and want to instead install Snow Leopard, right? Downgrading would be a very bad idea. Please see the page at http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2186  The summary is: \"Both PowerPC- and Intel-based Macs ship with a certain version of Mac OS X (or Mac OS X Server) on their installation disc(s). You should not install a version of Mac OS X earlier than that which came with your Mac.\"\nI know that this is not what you want to hear, but Apple strongly recommends against doing what you want to do. If you really, really HATE Lion, perhaps you should contact Powermax at http://www.powermax.com/  They specialize in trade-ins. Since your Mac is brand new and still under its factory 1-year service warranty they may be able to trade your new machine for a slightly older one which originally shipped with Snow Leopard. As long as that replacement is still under its original 1-year factory warranty you can purchase a 3-year AppleCare warranty for it if you wish. This way you would get your Snow Leopard Mac losing possibly only a few months of warranty coveage compared to buying the 3-year AppleCare warranty for your Lion Mac.\nI am speculating here, but installing an older version of Mac OS X could possibly void certain parts of your original warranty.\n\nA: If your machine shipped with Snow Leopard then you will be fine to install it, but if the machine was sent from the factory with Lion Pre-Installed, then it means all firmware has been upgraded to work with Lion hence you being unable to boot from any snow leopard disc. \nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT2186\n", "Q: How can I run a job once a day with launchd, regardless of when the computer is on?

I'm saying any number because the mirroring option suggested by other answers mirrors all displays. If you have two external monitors like me, you would find that it doesn't help at all.\nYou'll need SwitchResX for this (yes, it's paid, but it you don't pay it just annoys you with a warning every day and disables some features, that's all). One thing I want to point out is that the 'disable screen' option just hides the screen and it keeps rendering in the background, which is not what we want, instead we will mirror one of the displays on the built-in one:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to video mirroring in the switchresx menu and mirror the built-in display on any of your external monitors\n \n\n*You might have to set your external display resolution if it displays the wrong resolution\n\n\n*Turn off the brightness on the built-in display if you want to  \n\n\nYou will see that it's actually mirroring the display if you look at preferences > display > arrangement:\n\nAnd looking at the GPU memory usage, I can confirm again that it's not rendering the built-in display, which should mean much better performance and much quiter fans!\n\n\nA: Here's a visual answer that should help folks quickly find the solution:\n1. Select \"Mirror Displays\" in the \"Arrangement\" tab\nYou can find that \"Arrangement\" tab in the \"Display\" section of \"System Preferences\" whenever an external display is recognized.\n\n2. Ensure it's optimized for the external screen\nThis should be default, at least it was for me.\n\n3. Lower the brightness of the MacBook down to Zero\n\nA: Solutions using Magnets for MacBooks (2015-2019)\nThere might be many reasons you would want to turn off the built-in display of the MacBook. I am using two larger external monitors, and while using heavy applications if 3 screens are active the Mac starts to throttle. For myself personally, the smaller built-in screen is taking unnecessary resources so just reducing the brightness to zero is not an apt solution. And neither is closing the lid since I was having connectivity problems with my Wifi on the 2.4 GHz channel when the lid was closed and I also want to use the magnificent built-in trackpad for gestures rather than buying an external one.\nI was looking at a lot of answers in forums and in this thread but unfortunately, most software-based solutions are outdated and don't work and applications like  DisableMonitor say :\nIt has been reported that the software is able to cause irretrievable damages to your computer.\nUse at your own risk!\nThe project development has been stopped and won't be continued.\nMy Setup\nI am using a 2019 15\" MBP and this solution worked for me. I am hoping this solution would work for all devices in this design platform that Apple used starting from 2015-present (2021).\nWhat you need\nWe need 2 small low powered magnets. Unfortunately, the magnetic strip used in refrigerator magnets did not work for me.\nMagnets that I used were from cheap old IEMs (Earphones), they were perfect since they were relatively low power and I got two of the same size and power.\nHow\nWe are trying to simulate what MacBooks do, to know that the lid is closed.\nTwo of the many magnets in the display lid in the MacBook in combination with Hall effect sensors in the lower chassis are used by the Mac\nto determine when the lid is closed. So all we need to do is place 2 magnets on the lower chassis at the exact location where the two magnets in the display would have been when the lid is closed and voilà it works.\nOne thing we need to take care of is to place both the magnets at the exact same time otherwise, it doesn't work.\nSolution\nPlace the two magnets at the exact same time near the edge of the chassis. For the 2019 15\" MBP the location is just below the 2 USB-C ports on either side.\n\nConcerns\nThe new Macs do not use any moving parts and especially the hard drives are SSDs, so that concern is for the most part alleviated. Also since the Apple laptops themselves are using magnets to know if the lid is closed it seems to be a safe enough solution as long as it's used when the MacBook is kept stationary and using low-power magnets. Also, I do not see any distortions in the audio while using the built-in speakers as long as the magnets are low in power.\nThis is one of the only solutions that worked for me which is quite straightforward. Since we are using magnets around computers, I would recommend using as low powered as possible and also check if your computer is using any hardware internal or external which can be affected by magnets (eg, magnetic hard drives) and do after your own research the last thing we want is someone to destroy their work or damage their hardware.\n\nUpdate after 1 month.\nBased on the concerns shown in the comments: using magnets can be dangerous in that if one forgets they are there and closes the lid the display can be cracked.\nI have modified my solution as in the pictures bellow :\nAttaching the 2 magnets to a piece of packing material which is cut in the exact size of the MacBook and the magnets are glued in position, so that they align perfectly with there intended place on the laptop when the material is placed on top of the laptop.\n\nDescription : The magnets are glued into correct place.\n\n\nDescription : The spongy-material is placed with the magnets side facing down, so that the magnets align perfectly with there intended position and if there is any accidental closure the material will absorb the shock.\n\nIt gives two advantages:\n\n*\n\n*Obviously the concern of accidental screen closing and the worry of the screen cracking is resolved.\n\n*An added advantage is now we don't have to go through the trouble of carefully placeing the magnets at the same time, just placing the sheet in the correct location is enough, it reduces the hassle significantly.\n\nPro Tip: I find sliding the sheet into place much easier. Also you might have to place something with a small weight on top of it especially for the first few days so that the sheet does not bend.\n\nA: Reducing heat by adjusting the lid\nHaving the lid closed or open does not impact the airflow of your MacBook Pro (MBP). Ambient air is never in short supply and the \"exhaust\" (where the hot air picked up by the blade fan(s) are expelled) is located at the back of the unit (the black stripe on the newer models and the grey stripe on the first generation machines).\nSome claim that keeping the lid open allows the chassis to cool down, but these claims have never had any real data behind them (simply anecdotal evidence and unsubstantiated rumour). Personally, I have a 2006 MBP that was eventually relegated to being a desktop. I ran the system for well over a year with the clamshell open, and then closed, and saw no different in CPU/CPU temps (nor any variability in the other heat sensors) as a result. Moreover, the newer models have far more efficient blade fans and would suffer even less from the effects of heat (additionally, the new Intel chipsets run cooler than their predecessors). You can conduct your own testing of course. I had replaced the heat sink, re-applied a sane amount of Arctic Silver thermal paste, and used Lobotomo Fan Control daemon to monitor my system's temperature.\nDisabling the internal display, properly\nThere are two ways to connect a secondary display to your notebook without enabling the default screen (note that this does not mean dimming it, but rather turning it off).\n\n\n*\n\n*The first is to connect the display with the lid closed when the machine is powered down. Once the external display is connected, turn the machine on—it will detect the secondary display while leaving the internal one turned off. This will alleviate the issues you have with \"dragging things off the screen\" as the system will constrain your desktop to the one, active monitor.\n\n*The second is to connect the secondary display when your system is awake and active, and the clamshell open. Make sure the notebook is plugged in. Once you connect the secondary monitor, the system will recognize it. Once it does, close the lid on your notebook. The device will be put to sleep. Once that happens, move your mouse, or hit a key on your keyboard to wake it. Once it wakens, it will enable the secondary display, but not the internal one.\n\n\nAdditionally, you may set the attribute to leave the system in the sleep state even if the clamshell is opened. You can do this using pmset, a local utility found on OS X that actually handles all your power settings. You can accomplish this with the following command:\nsudo pmset -a lidwake 0\n\nThe -a, -b, -c, -u flags determine whether the settings apply to battery ( -b ), charger (wall power) ( -c ), UPS ( -u ) or all ( -a ).\nTo reverse the command, set the 0 to a 1. These settings are persistent, in that, they do not need to be re-applied every time the machine's power is cycled and are saved to the file: /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.PowerManagement.plist\n\nA: You could also use a ThirdParty App like \nhttps://github.com/Eun/DisableMonitor/\nEdit:\nDisableMonitor adds the missing feature to disable a monitor on a Mac.

Text files can be compressed even more. When I put a 1.33 MB text file into the lyrics of a song, the size of song file increases by about 0.1 MB. So it does save the lyrics into the file. \n\nA: Yes, iTunes embeds the lyrics information within the file, just like title and artist information.\n\nA: On a Mac, iTunes stores the lyrics information in the audio file.\nWhen I try to replicate your process, I do get a change to both the modification time and the size of the music file. When you look at the file size, are you looking at the copy of the audio file that iTunes uses? You can be sure by control-clicking the track in iTunes and selecting \"Show in Finder\"; if you change the lyrics, the file modification time should be when you last changed the lyrics, and the size of that file (rounded to the block size) should change when lyrics are added or subtracted.\n", "Q: Connect my Windows XP to Mac OS X Internet Sharing I have Internet Sharing enabled:\n\n\nThe WEP password is aaaaa.

But as soon as I go to the App Store, XCode is still marked as installed. How can I make the App Store realize that XCode has been uninstalled?\n\nA: This does not answer the question above, but I thought I would keep it here in case somebody who've got here by a search, would find it helpful. This advice deals with command line tools problems and not the XCode application.\nTo reinstall xcode command line tools on macOS, simply run the following commands in your terminal:\nsudo rm -rf $(xcode-select -print-path)\nxcode-select --install\n\nUnfortunately, it happens quite often when other command line tools are unable to find xcode or CLT, reinstalling it as shown above, helps.\n\nA: try this in terminal:\nxcode-select --install\n\nit brings up and downloads developer tools for you\n\nA: The App Store actually recognizes the Install Xcode.app file in the Applications folder.  So, in order to reinstall, just run Install Xcode again from the Applications folder.

I want to remove some of the icons in the dock. Every time I sign out the dock will be \"restored\". Not to factory settings but always to the same appearance. I'm not really sure if this behaviour started when I upgraded Snow Leopard or before. Upgrading to Lion did not solve the problem. The behaviour even applies to some general settings and some Application. Adjustments just wont survive reboot.\nTo me, it feels like some permission glitch?\n\n\n*\n\n*New user accounts works fine\n\n*Using the disk utility, repair permission didn't solve the problem\n\n*Clearing the Libary/Chache didn't do anything\n\n\nA: Yes this sounds like a permissions problem - probably the permissions on the Dock's settings files are wrong.\nThe easiest way to fix it is to delete these files. You'll find the config file at \n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist\nMake a change to the dock and it will then regenerate them with the correct permissions. Do note that you shouldn't lose your Dock settings this way, but it is a possibility. In any case, the Dock is easy to configure back the way you want it.\nIf that doesn't work, try deleting:\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.db\nas well.\nHint: A clue that the permissions on them are wrong is if OS X prompts for a password when you try to delete these files - it shouldn't.\n\nA: I really think it has to do with this issue https://discussions.apple.com/message/15844450#15844450 (Problem deleting files - Lion prompts for password)\nAfter I changed the permissions for my home dir (follow the link) things looks and works ok.

Since I installed Lion, the Spotlight database keeps reindexing (which is taking several hours). It does this at least every second day.\nAre any other users experiencing this problem with Lion (i.e. is it just a 10.7.0 bug)?\nIf not, how can I diagnose what is causing it - I see no suspicious entries in Console? \nJust being able to reset the spotlight history and have it rebuild would be nice to know.\n\nA: New theory: my system drive keeps running low on space — sometimes down to only a few hundred MB free. When the OS detects this situation, it deletes the Spotlight indices. When I free up space again, it has to rebuild the indices.\n\nA: @koiyu, @TJ Luoma - It was a combination of both of your answers that got my Late 2010 MacBook Air (SSD) from overheating and crashing nightly. \nI combined your answers in a script that I called mdutil_rebuild.sh.  Save it as 'whatever_name_you_like.sh' and run it from the terminal with sh whatever_name_you_like.sh.  Fyi - for me it takes about 7 hours to rebuild my ~130GB index on my machine.  Might be worth doing it overnight if you're going to need all your processor for anything.\n#!/bin/sh\n\n#  Force rebuild the spotlight index from scratch.\n#    Compiled on 12-14-2012 in response to runaway \n#    reindexing processes from answers by @koiyu\n#    and @TJ Luoma.\n#\n#  Ask Different Question: http://bit.ly/SYTE1j \n\n# Turn off spotlight.\n  sudo mdutil -a -i off\n\n# Remove the index files.\n  sudo rm -rfv /.Spotlight-V100\n\n# Turn on spotlight.\n  sudo mdutil -a -i on\n\n# Reindex all mounted /Volumes\n  sudo mdutil -aE\n\n\nA: I, too, had the reindexing problem happening after I upgraded to Lion. However the problem didn't exist for every user, just for the one that was using FileVault 1.\nAfter a few weeks I got overfrustrated and ran… †\n$ sudo mdutil -a -i off\n\n… in Terminal — and the same minute I realised that the setting was applied system–wide. I shrugged and enjoyed a few hours worth of reindexing–free session after which I decided to turn Spotlight back on, as it is crucial to my workflow on other user accounts; so:\n$ sudo mdutil -a -i on\n\nAnd while I was at it, I decided to erase the old index and rebuild new from scratch with:\n$ sudo mdutil -aE\n\nI did this about a month ago and I haven't encountered \"useless\" reindexing since. I'm happily surprised because fixing the issue was merely a coincidence.\nSo, have you tried turning it off and on again?\n\n†) the -a flag will apply the action to all volumes  which might not be something you want — and actually wasn't what I wanted either, but I just wanted to go blitzkrieg on the issue.\n\nA: I figured this out. One of the spotlight plugins was causing errors, which closer scrutiny of the Console log revealed. \nI found out which app was causing the problem by looking in\n/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports\n\nThere I found several crash reports from mdworker (the backend to Spotlight). All crashes were caused by the same app plugin. I have now deleted that plugin from my system.\n\nA: Two things I discovered while investigating this same issue:\n32-bit Spotlight Importers\nThese seem to be one of the reasons mds and mdworker (the system processes behind Spotlight) were tripping up and failing to complete the index.  (And might explain the mysterious \"Unable to talk to lsboxd\" messages.) Since mds and mdworker are 64-bit processes, it probably couldn't work with the older 32-bit Spotlight Importers (I found three on my system).\nTo find out if you have any, use Terminal.app and enter this command:   mdimport -L\nThat'll give you a list of paths where you can find each of the Spotlight Importers (some are embedded in third-party applications).  Use the Finder \"Go to Folder...\" command to open the enclosing folder of each Spotlight Importer.  In the Finder, \"Get Info\" on each to see if it says \"(32-bit)\". I moved these to the trash and tried the process suggested above and it seemed to work better.\nRebuild Mail.app mailboxes\nThis was what finally got Spotlight to index email that hadn't been included in previous attempts, even following the processes suggested above and elsewhere. Only after Mail.app rebuild the mailboxes did Spotlight begin to return search results from those locations.\n\nA: Try going to disk utilities, select the hard disk and repair permissions.  This worked for me a for a related spotlight problem.\n\nA: Two very simple things to try right off the bat - that often alleviate this kind of Spotlight shenanigans for me..  \n1:  First, if you've got root access... sudo killall mds from the terminal.. Which kills the \"mds\" process.. (meta data searcher??) that'll get you out of whatever kerfluffle X, Y, Or Z plugin, file, or whatnot that made spotlight croak in the first place..  Force quit now, troubleshoot later... That's what my father always said.  Just kidding, I'm an orphan..\nOr \n2: For a more more pedestrian solution.. Open up spotlight prefs and a: remove any non-indexed \"private\" items... And b: if you wanna reset the volume index.. I believe you can do so by actually adding your boot drive to that list, closing and re-opening the system prefs and then remove your aforementioned \"Macintosh HD\" from the privacy list  it... This will reindex the drive.. Hopefully with less kvetching, this time.

If I open the directory in Finder, I can see the files vanishing one by one. This operation used to be virtually instantaneous in Snow Leopard, but is excruciatingly slow in Lion. If I copy the files instead of hard-linking them, removing them is still instantaneous.\nCan anybody tell me what has changed to warrant this slowness?\n\nA: I think I figured it out. It seems to be Mobile Time Machine that's causing the slowdown. Apparently it's dutifully taking a backup of the files while they're being deleted. If the files are \"original\", it can simply move them to the Time Machine vault, but if they're links it has to copy them instead, which takes much longer.\n", "Q: Can I install OSX Safari 5.1 for one user and Safari 5.05 for another user - same CPU?

It will be similar to 5.1 (or probably 5.2!) and you can install it alongside your older version of Safari.\nYou can get it here:\nhttp://nightly.webkit.org/\nIn case you haven't encountered them before these betas are the truly cutting edge versions of Safari as it is developed.\nTBH I have been using 5.1 since the Dev betas (months ago!) and have found them very stable and fast - better than 5.0 IMO.\n\nA: While they don't have version 5, you could install Safari 5.1 as your main browser and then use Multi-Safari to access an earlier version. I hope this helps a little bit.\n\nA: No, I don't think so. Reason is that Safari updates replace the whole webkit framework which is a part of OS X, so you can only have one version at a time. \n", "Q: Can I save my free upgrade to Lion?

You could install Snow Leopard on your mac without an internet connection, make an account and copy the installer to the hard drive.\nI'm fairly certain that installer does not check for an internet connection or have any sort of time stamp (but I can't rule those out).\nTo be legal, do consider the license Apple included with your system has wordings for you to use that copy of the software on that one mac and that you can't transfer that license except by transferring the hardware (the license words things to tie the license to the hardware). You can then check with a local lawyer to determine how that license is going to be \"legal\" where you live.\n", "Q: Quicksilver Lion Problems I have been using Quicksilver ß60 for a while, and I recently updated to Lion.

I am a long time macports user and am looking for some fresh blood (if I may say so). I was looking towards fink. I'd appreciate it if anyone listed out a few differences between these two package management systems.\n\nA: Fink is a binary distribution using tools that originated from Debian (e.g., apt-get, etc.)\nMacports is built around the philosophy used by the FreeBSD ports collection. In this you download tarballs directly from the upstream source, apply patches and compile. It's entirely automated.\nI haven't used Fink in quite a while (since Panther) because it didn't seem very well done to me.\n\nA: Not to hijack, but if you're really looking for a cleaner option, try homebrew.

As I told in the question, the problem is Windows and Mac OSX interpret Home and End differently.

Any other decent options?\n\nA: Don't overwrite or remove the system versions. Future OS X updates will break things.\nMacPorts, Fink and Homebrew will use prefixes to prevent such problems, and typically set up the path so that your own calls to scripting languages will use their custom versions, whereas OS X packages will continue to use its own versions.\n", "Q: How can I do shift + slash on a French AZERTY keyboard? I have a MacBook with a French AZERTY keyboard.\nOn this keyboard, the forward slash ('/') is over the ':' character, so I have to do: Shift + : to get the /.\nHowever in Eclipse there is a useful shortcut to comment out blocks of code: you do ⌘ + / to put \"//\" at the beginning of every line of selected code; and Shift + ⌘ + / to put /* and */ at the beginning and the end of selected lines, thus commenting out the block of code.\nBut as I already need to press Shift to get the /, when I do Shift + ⌘ + :, it understands ⌘ + /, and I get the first shortcut.\nI can't seem to get the second shortcut.

Perhaps they cleaned the inside of the mac to reduce dust, but the superdrive units are replaced as a whole by Apple technicians - you get a new drive - not something that is \"tuned up\".\nThe only calibration DVD are for running reference sound or visual patterns to help you calibrate a display system for video to ensure dim grey are differentiated visually from black, to focus a projection system, or to check channels or sound levels on an audio system.\nOf course there are many cleaning DVD on the market, but I would be loathe to subject my SuperDrive slot loading mechanism to one of those. It could easily get stuck and do far more damage to the drive.\n", "Q: How fast does a modern Mac SuperDrive spin a CD or DVD? I am wondering how fast the current 2011/2010 era macs spin the optical media. I'm talking about real physical speeds even if it is complicated.\nAngular velocity is fine, linear velocity is fine - the radius is fixed, so the math is easy.\nIf you can address both slot load and tray loading or go into details how the speeds vary, that would be very nice. \nI am also curious of the read speed is different than the burn speed for writeable media of the various types. \nSome times you can specify 1x or 8x - but don't know what is the \"normal\" burn speed. My understanding is they employ zoned constant linear velocity (ZCLV) but I don't see a good reference for hardware that is shipping presently that goes into any detail what 8x actually means.\n\nA: According to ISO/IEC INTERNATIONAL STANDARD 10149 (Second edition 1995-07-15), which is the basis for the \"1x\" speed, the linear velocity at whatever point on the disc is being read needs to be between 1.2 and 1.4 meters per second. That would translate into a different RPMs at different parts of the disc.\nA back of the envelope calculation suggests that the fastest a drive in a modern MacBook Pro would spin the disc would be during 24x read at the center of the disc; that would be around 12,000 revolutions per minute.\nThe full text of the standard is downloadable for free at http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/s025869_ISO_IEC_10149_1995(E).zip\n\nA: Tray loading CD drives are the fastest, back in 2004 or so I had a 52x CD-RW drive (10,400 RPM) and it looks like they still make them. The fastest drive I see on the Apple website now is the 32x drive in the Mac Pro which tops out at 4,800RPM. \n\nA: It depends on what you're doing:\n\n8x slot-loading SuperDrive (DVD±R DL/DVD±RW/CD-RW)\nMaximum write: 8x DVD-R, DVD+R; 4x DVD-R DL (double layer), DVD+R DL (double layer), DVD-RW, DVD+RW; 24x CD-R; 10x CD-RW\nMaximum read: 8x DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-ROM; 6x DVD-ROM (double layer DVD-9), DVD-R DL (double layer), DVD+R DL (double layer), DVD-RW, DVD+RW; 24x CD\n\nFrom http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/specs.html\nThese specs are for the current MBP, but I doubt there has been any significant change in quite a while. I remember 24x reads being available for the past several years.\n", "Q: FW400 HDD not recognized at all I have an external hard drive in an enclosure that plugs into the firewire port of a Mac Pro, and it is not recognized. I connect the device to the firewire port, and this is what it shows:\n\n\nAny ideas on how to make the drive be recognized? Disk Utility does not see it, and neither does diskutil on terminal. Running Lion on a MacPro 4,1.\nAdded: I just noticed the power went out, so the drive might have shut down improperly. Is there a software to correct the drive again?\n\nA: First, will the FireWire port work with another external hard drive with FireWire? This will rule out if the port has failed or not. IF you have another Mac nearby but not another external drive, another way to test this would be to see if the drive will mount on another Mac.\nSecond, can you dismantle the external enclosure and move the bare hard drive to another external enclosure, and see if that works? This will rule out whether the interface hardware in the external enclosure has failed.\nIf you don't have the equipment to test this, take the system to a repair facility that does have the equipment and can test it for you.\nIf you are fortunate, the bare hard drive is OK and only the enclosure will need to be replaced.\n", "Q: How do I roll back updates on my MBP? My MBP has been freezing every day, and extremely slow ever since the last 10.6.8 update. Is there a way to go back to when my laptop was usable? Sort of like in Windows where you can uninstall updates\n\nA: Mac OS X does not have a feature like Windows System Restore Points. Doing this sort of thing on a Mac is considerably more involved and problematic.\nThat being said, there are other options and workarounds for troubleshooting your system's performance and how to fix it. I'll have to leave that for another post.\nHave you been using Time Machine to make complete backups of your Mac to an external hard drive, every hour, every day?\n\nA: If you've ruled out other issues (HDD f/ex) and want to roll back to 10.6.7, the quickest way will be to re-install 10.6 followed by the 10.6.7 Combo update.  \n", "Q: Mac repair USB Drive I would like to make a bootable USB flash drive with Diskwarrior, techtool pro, and some other utilities. Does anyone have any suggestions as to the best way to go about doing this?\nI was hoping to keep the total image unter 8GB, but I could do 16.\n\nA: There's a utility called DasBoot which allows precisely this:\nhttp://subrosasoft.com/OSXSoftware/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=200&products_id=193\nHowever, I'm not sure whether it is Lion compatible. \nIf DasBoot doesn't work, there is another, sure fire way of achieving this.\nSimply install Lion (or Snow Leopard) onto your USB drive. You should be able to do so with a 16GB, since the minimum disk space requirement for Lion is only 7GB, and it may even work with a 8GB. \nInstructions here: http://www.maciverse.com/install-os-x-snow-leopard-from-usb-flash-drive.html\nThen you can simply install the things you need. AFAIK this is what the Geniuses in the MacStore do, and probably how I would do it myself.\n", "Q: Why might iChat not connect after upgrading to Lion? Since upgrading to Lion, iChat refuses to connect to either my AIM or Google Talk accounts. (Not a Google Apps account, fwiw.) Interestingly, if I sign in to AIM on another computer and try to get iChat to sign on, I get a message that I'm trying to sign on in more than one place, but iChat still shows status as \"offline\" for all accounts.\nSo far, I've tried deleting all the com.apple.iChat preferences in Library, but to no avail.\n\nA: This happens to be occasionally, and I'm almost sure it's a bug in Lion. Disabling then reenabling my AIM account in the iChat preferences seems to temporarily fix the issue.\n\nA: Open \"Console,\" located in your Utilities folder, and type \"iChat\" into the filter search box. Then open iChat and watch the console for error messages.\n\nA: For some reason iChat defaulted to selecting \"https only\" on aim and gtalk for me. Once I deselected both https options, iChat accounts connected successfully. \n\nA: Change the port to 443, with SSL enabled. Doing it worked for me.\n\nA: Try dropping your account and recreating it.  That worked for me.\n\nA: I had the same problem and followed some instructions I found in the MacRumors forum:\nThe issue is whith the server iChat is trying to use for authentication. Do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to menu iChat->Preferences\n\n*Choose Accounts icon\n\n*Select \"Server Settings\" tab\n\n*change the Server to \"slogin.oscar.aol.com\"\n\n", "Q: Inaccurate click to open an app from Launchpad: closes Launchpad I'm surprised how much I use Launchpad after upgrading to Lion both to launch and switch to applications, to the extent that I rarely find myself showing the Dock anymore. I do have one problem, however:\nIn Launchpad, when one clicks on an application icon, the computer exits the Launchpad screen and launches or switches to the application. When one clicks near but not on an application icon, the computer exits the Launchpad screen and returns to the frontmost application before Launchpad was activated. These are two very different behaviors separated by a small space in terms of pixel targets.\nIs there a way make a missed click in Launchpad result in remaining in Launchpad, or to expand the clickable target around the icons?\nIf the answer is no, that isn't possible, I'd be happy to accept that as correct; I just want to know if there's something I can do to make Launchpad more usable by reducing the wondering after I clicked whether I hit the target or not.\n\nA: The behaviour is intentional, and works much the same within Expose and Mission Control etc.\nIt's the way out of Launchpad, and if clicking elsewhere other than on an icon doesn't exit you from it, then the only way would be to start a new program or use a keyboard shortcut or mouse gesture.\nIf you know the gesture or keyboard shortcut that starts it without having to use the dock, then you will likely know how to reverse the action.  But for the (possibly majority) users who happily enter it from the Dock icon this could be very confusing and frustrating as the Dock is removed while Launchpad is displayed, depriving the user of the chance to use it.  The fact that there is a new icon for it suggests that Apple expect people to learn about the feature, and at least start using it, via the dock.\nIf you find yourself regularly missing the icons, perhaps you could look into scaling them up, that may be a possibility, they are huge on my 24\", but I'm not sure if this is user customisable.\n\nA: No, unfortunately this isn't possible, but I agree it is annoying. File a bug if you'd like to see this changed (developer account required, I believe).\n", "Q: Running VI on Lion Lion came with a sad surprise to me. Now, every time I want to run VI on terminal, I get VIM. I hate VIM. How do I get my old and bad VI back to the system? thanks.\n\nA: Vi has actually been VIM on most Linux distributions that I have used over the years. In general if you have a ~/.vimrc file that is how you tell vim to act like vim and not vi. Otherwise it should look and act just like vi, this article from 2000 has more details (yup - its been that way for a long, long time).\nWhat specifically are you not liking about Lion's vim behavior? Running vim with the -C flag should force it into full vi compatibility mode even if a .vimrc is present.\n\nA: Am i the only one that is using MacVim?\nhttp://code.google.com/p/macvim/\n", "Q: How to customize Finder sidebar icons I'm using Dropbox and replacing some of the standard user folders like Documents and Pictures with symlinks to locations in my Dropbox. I can easily set the icons of these symlinks to match the icons of the standard Documents and Pictures folders, but I can't find a way to also change the symlinks' appearance on the Finder sidebar to look like the native Documents and Pictures folders.\nIn short, I've placed custom folders in the Finder sidebar; is there a way to change the icons they're given?\nI've looked into Candybar, but it seems like that's mostly for changing the appearance of all appearances of the standard icons, whereas I just want to make a plain and ordinary folder look like a standard user folder.\n\nA: I believe this worked in Snow Leopard, and is broken in Lion (perhaps on purpose). You won't be able to set your own icons for just any folder — file a bug if you'd like to see this fixed. But as you noted, they can be changed for the standard icons, using CandyBar\nYou can also just edit the image files themselves, at /System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources. The icons are named Sidebar___.icns.\n\n", "Q: MacBook brightness set to zero suddenly resets itself to one. Any ideas why? Every night I start some music/audiobook/whatever in iTunes and then reduce the brightness of the screen to zero to listen to the audio without seeing a bright screen. For the past few weeks (I think), my MacBook (2007) automatically increases the brightness to at least level one after five or ten minutes requiring me to press the lower brightness button again to switch the screen back to dark.\nAny idea why it does that?\n\nA: The 2007 MacBook (without \"Pro\") doesn't even have an ambient light sensor, so that one can be ruled out. My guess would be that some software, maybe even the system itself, turns the background light back on to let you know that the machine is still running.\nIf you're on Snow Leopard or Lion, you could use the Screen Saver prefs to assign a \"Hot Corner\" to \"Display Sleep\" which turns off the display without putting the computer to sleep.\n\nA: Try Resetting the systems PRAM.\nThis can be done by powering off first, then power on and hold CMD+OPT+P+R at the same time through three boot chimes.\n", "Q: How do I mount a jailbroken iPhone as a volume in Lion? In Snow Leopard I was using this utility (it uses MacFuse) to mount my iPhone as a volume upon its connection. Worked very well, and I could browse my jailbroken iPhone's files easily and drag/drop over themes like on a normal HD.\nSince OS X Lion, it doesn't appear to be working. Are there any un-obtrusive tweaks to achieve this again? Or does anyone know how to get the MacFuse filesystem working on OS X Lion?\n\nA: Phone Disk ain't free, but would be a good choice: http://www.macroplant.com/phonedisk/\n", "Q: Kindle with iPhone I want to buy a Kindle and use my iPhone 3G to connect to the internet to download books.  Do I need to buy the Kindle 3G + Wifi to work?  Another thing, will the two work together?\n\nA: Personal Hotspot only works on iPhone 4 or above. Note that many networks will charge you extra to use it though.\nThe Kindle 3G has free internet downloads internationally, so I'd probably recommend that over upgrading your phone.\nHaving said that, I own a Kindle (wifi only) and I happily download all my books at home (via wifi). Only once have I actually connected it to my iPhone 4 hotspot!\n\nA: From the way you phrase your question, I think you lack a basic understanding of how the Kindle bookstore system works. Forgive me if any of the following is something you may already know.\nWith Amazon Kindle, you can purchase books from Amazon through a web browser on any platform--a computer, an iPhone or iPod or iPad, or any other kind of device that connects to the Internet.\nYou can then take the books that you bought from Amazon and load them onto your Kindle through any of several different methods. You can download the book to your computer, connect your Kindle to the computer via a USB cable, and then upload the book to the Kindle over the cable. Another method is to have a Kindle that connects to WiFi or to the cell phone network, and to connect to the Amazon bookstore that way, to make purchases and to download any purchases that you have made.\nFurthermore, there are Kindle apps for Mac OS X, Windows, iPhone and iPad and other applications, and if you purchase a digital book in Kindle format from Amazon, you can read the same book on any and all of these devices including the Kindle itself. Whenever you connect to Amazon.com by any of these various methods, all the books you have purchased are available to be downloaded and read on any of them.\n\nA: You can use your iPhone's mobile hotspot feature to create a portable Wifi network to which your kindle can connect to using wifi. I should note that the kindle's data is free once you buy the 3G device, yet the iPhone's data is subject to your carrier's fury.\n\nA: If you upgrade your iPhone to a newer model, a wifi-only kindle can be attached to the iPhone's 3G connection using the mobile hotspot feature. I could be wrong, but I don't think mobile hotspot works on an iPhone 3G.\nI'm not suggesting you buy a new iPhone now, but keep it in mind as something you'll probably do at some point in the future. Also note that some carriers will charge you extra for the hotspot feature (it's free with my carrier).\nAny book you read on one can be read on the other (download the kindle app on your iPhone), and as far as I know it will keep your reading position in sync between them.\nI would only spend extra money on the 3G kindle if you really need to be able to buy books while on the road, especially since you can always buy them on the iPhone instead if there's no wifi available, and download to the kindle once you have wifi.\n", "Q: Troubleshooting MacBook Air boot issues I have a late-2010 MacBook Air (11inch, 3,1), running Snow Leopard.  I hadn't run software update in a month or two, so I plugged it into the wall and ran software update last night.  Unfortunately, the update failed, giving the informative message \"An error occurred.\"  Nothing happened for an hour or so after this, so I forced a restart.\nNow the MBA won't boot up at all.  It hangs on the grey screen, with the little grey wheel spinning forever.  I was wondering what additional steps I should take before bringing it in to the apple store?  I've already:\n\n\n*\n\n*Booted from the provided USB drive and repaired permissions.  Permissions repair finds lots of SUID issues it can't repair, but I guess I can ignore these.\n\n*Booted from the provided USB drive and run disk utility.  It runs without issues.\n\n*Re-installed Snow Leopard from the USB drive.\n\n*Re-set PRAM\n\n*Re-set the PMC\n\n*Ran the apple hardware test (the short one, not the long one) from the USB drive. Everything passed.\n\n\nNone of these procedures fixed the issue.  Ominously, when I try to boot in single user mode, this also fails.  It displays lots of errors messages, and never actually gets to a command prompt.\nHave there been any recent firmware updates for the 3,1 macbook airs?  It doesn't seem to be a software problem, but I'm stumped, and any help is appreciated.\nThank you.\nEdit: Here's what the screen looks like:\n\nEdit 2: I did a \"Safe Boot\" and that appears to hang too.

Both of these make it almost impossible for even a professional to do data recovery if you don't have a backup - so use care before trying these.\n\nA: You can try the following steps : \n\n\n*\n\n*Backup all your data\n\n*Perform a clean install from the Apple-provided USB drive (boot from the drive, choose your language, then go in the utilities -> Disk Utility. There, you can re-create a new partition in order to eliminate drive partitionning problems). \n\n*quit the utility and re-install SL\n\n\nIf nothing helps, that probably means that the mac encountered a hardware problem. \nPerhaps you could post here the error messages you encounter in single user mode, that could help understand the problem.\n\nA: Try checking your /var/log/system.log and look for some recent errors.\nIn my case the curl library was broken (dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/lib/libcurl.4.dylib) after PLAY ONLINE modem installation, so I've fixed it by copying it from MAMP directory.\nSee also some command-line hints here:\nhttp://www.westwind.com/reference/os-x/commandline/single-user.html\nAs well as Startup key combinations for Intel-based Macs:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1533\n", "Q: Outlook 2011 won't open, fails with exit code 255 Outlook 2011 keeps closing about 2 seconds after launch.

So buying MBA will assure I wont buy a new laptop which in a few months could become \"old\". And I need it by the end of August.\nThat said, any advice would be great.\nUPDATE\nBattery life is the same in both, MBA wights: 2.96 pounds (1.35 kg) and MBP: 4.5 pounds (2.04 kg)\n\nA: The things that are easy to quantify are screen real estate. If you want more pixels - get a screen with more pixels. The Air fits 15\" of normal screen pixels in the 13\" package. The 15\" MacBook Pro can have a high resolution screen option like the pixel density of the  base model 17\" MBP. The 13\" MacBook Pro you list has the almost the same pixels as an 11\" Air.\nAnother tradeoff is the Air will have a much faster IO system due to the SSD drive being faster than a spinning HDD. For light crunching of video and still photos, the CPU in the Air performs close enough to the other CPU in the full Pro line as to not be a big drawback for most. \nThe SSD speedup is huge for most developers - so that alone seems to trump most people that run Xcode - they really want to optimize for low latency IO and work iteratively. The downside is a smaller drive. \nCompromises abound!\nIt takes great discipline to optimize code when your development workstation is running with tremendous horsepower. It almost makes sense in a way to choose as underpowered a machine as you can stand to run your code in simulation. You are forced to preview a bit of what the execution of that code will be on lesser powered mobile devices and entry level consumer macs if they are the end users of your development efforts.\nI hope these help you compare the tradeoffs and make a great choice. I envy you for having either of these - people have developed code on far less capable machines than even a 4 year old MacBook - so you really have no bad choice and can let he potential payoff of your development efforts guide how much capital you want to invest before you are selling your efforts.\n\nA: Do you want power or portability? The MacBook Air's strength is the latter. Will you be compiling monster code? Or working in coffee shops? The only one who can decide that is you. \nAnd do you really think you'll be disappointed if a new MacBook Pro model comes out in 6 months time? The evolution of these laptops tends to be incremental rather than revolutionary. I, for one, am still very happy with a four year old MacBook!\n\nA: I think the 2 laptops are powerful enough for ios applications compilation. \nI would make my choice on the other features : \n\n\n*\n\n*the MBP has more usb ports, which allow you to use multiple usb devices at the same time. With the MBA, you will need a usb hub each time you need to plug more than one device. that is something you need to think about if you want to develop directly on an iOs device, and use a usb hard drive (for example) when your not at home or office.\n\n*the MBP has a greater battery life-time. If you want to work while moving, that's important. \n\n*the MBP has a dvd drive, which might still be useful...\nI use my laptop for these kind of things, and my next computer will still be a 13\" MBP, to keep my huge battery-life\nPS : sorry for my bad english\n\nA: Macbook Air. It's got a better display, and the CPU's have jumped up to as fast as last years MacBook Pro. \nThe only question right now is 13\" Macbook Air or 15\" MacBook Pro with quad core. 13\" MBP really has almost no reason to exist...\n\nA: There is always something great around the corner, and what you buy will inevitably be updated and possibly even reduce in price in 2/6/12 months etc.  Don't worry where you are in the product cycle, worry about whether the item you choose is fit for your intended purpose.\nTake a good look at your most important considerations, be it battery life, expansion capability, weight, price etc, and base it on that.  My gut feeling is that if you are going to use Xcode and Photoshop regularly, i.e. every day then the Air might get long in the tooth faster than the Pro (i.e. in say 2 years when newer versions arrive with greater minimum requirements), which is both slower and has half the RAM.  IO speed shouldn't be much of an issue for this sort of work, so the SSD while nice isn't a must have for your use.   IMO :)\n\nA: -The new Macbook Air's benchmarks are virtually indistinguishable from the Macbook Pro's, though slightly more expensive (Flash memory really helps)-.\nI didn't see your laptop choices, sorry. Yeah, your MBP choices are faster than the MBAs. Plus, they have good graphics cards.\nResolution may come into play as well. \nIt is also far lighter and more portable. As a student and iOS developer myself, I went for the MBA because of its portability and power. It all depends on how much you travel, I guess.\nYou may want to look into the innate limitations of having an MBA. 2 USB ports, no CD Drive and a (relatively) small screen are three. Because of these limitations, I would buy the MBP if you don't have another computer that is very powerful. If you are just looking for a computer to do mobile work, I would go with the MBA, both because of its smaller size and because of its smaller cost.\n", "Q: What is the best application to run Windows on a Mac? I've been looking around for reviews for the best way to run a Windows on a Mac. I've come across Bootcamp, Parallels, VitrualBox, and VMFusion. I am wondering what seems to be the most efficient, one with the least problems, and why use it over the others. If there are others I haven't mentioned let me know.\nEDIT\nI have a MacBook Pro just bought it a few weeks ago, and at the moment I would only use the Windows side for a few games. \n\nA: Your question is like that old Sesame Street song, \"Which one of these things doesn't belong?\".  Bootcamp is a way to run Windows via dual booting, which means that when you are running Windows you are not running OS X.  This is good for when you need maximum performance (e.g. Windows gaming) but very inconvenient when what you need is to be able to run Windows and OS X applications at the same time.\nThe other solutions you mentioned are all virtualization solutions that run Windows on top of OS X, letting you run a mix of applications.  Of these, I agree with Wheat that Parallels and Fusion are both very good, and it's really hard to say one is better than another.  Try them out (there are trial versions) and see which you prefer.  Or just go with pricing; I run Parallels because I got a good price on it as part of a software bundle.\nVirtualbox, on the other hand, is free and good at the basics, but it is MUCH less integrated into OS X.  For example, it does not map your OS X documents folder into the Windows document folder to enable seamless sharing of data between the two environments.  My take is that Virtualbox is good if you simply want to play around with Windows on a Mac, but if you have a real-world need for doing so, you're much better off spending the money for Fusion or Parallels.\n\nA: Another option, depending on what you want to do, would be Crossover, which is built on top of the Wine software. It doesn't require a copy of Windows (and the disk space that would take up), but it doesn't have the full compatibility that entails, either. For my purposes (running one particular Windows program on my Mac), it is the solution I like best, but obviously, the best solution for your situation would depend on your specific goals.\n\nA: Wine is great for running Windows applications. If you are just running the applications, I would highly recommend Wine instead of running a virtual machine. It is much faster and doesn't eat up as much CPU. Note: I haven't used Wine for running 3D games such as WOW or LOTRO, so I don't know how well that will do. \nI use Winebottler rather that compiling Wine. If you want to compile Wine, you can follow this guide, but I would recommend Winebottler.\n\nA: I do not believe there is one that is best. All four solutions you mention work well, and have their own features.\n", "Q: Chrome Mac gesture conflict with horizontal scrolling I am running Chrome 14 on OSX Lion. \nI swipe 2 fingers horizontally to scroll a web page horizontally, for a page that is too wide.\nWhen I swipe right, it works fine. When it swipe left it works for a second then I think it's trying to click on the browser's \"back\" button.\nI'm not sure who's at fault, but there is some kind of conflict.\n\nA: Turn off AppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls.\nIn your terminal, run this command: \ndefaults write com.google.Chrome AppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls -bool FALSE\n\nThen quit Chrome if you have it running, re-launch it and tada, no more navigate-back-on-scroll-left.\nIf you ever need to turn it back on again, just set it to TRUE: \ndefaults write com.google.Chrome AppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls -bool TRUE\n\nPicked this up over here.\n\nA: You can disable chromes gestures by going to System Preference > Mouse OR Trackpad > More Gestures > and uncheck Swipe between pages. \nI still love gestures so I downloaded BetterTouchTools which allows me to make the gestures I want. I disabled all apples gestures then created my own. You can get very custom with gestures this way. Or if you prefer, leave some of apples gestures on and use BetterTouchTools for the more custom ones. \nOh, BetterTouchTools is free :)\n\nA: On Safari in Lion, the horizontal scroll and browser back gestures conflict, but a single swipe doesn't activate them both; left-swiping when there is room to scroll scrolls then stops at the edge of the page. Left-swiping when the content is already at the edge of the page triggers the back action. If Chrome behaves differently, I suspect the conflict is in Chrome.\n\nA: If you don't have a problem changing your back and forth gestures, that will solve the problem. The real issue is that Chrome's back and forward gestures are a bit too sensitive at this point. They're still working on it because Apple switched it up on them and changed the gesture defaults in Lion. Back and Forward used to be three fingers (if I'm not mistaken) so they have to rewrite some things.\n\nA: I realized that I installed TouchpadSwipe Chrome extension to get the back and forward page functionality on my other windows machine, and it synced to my mac chrome. Once I disabled that it went back to normal\n", "Q: Wireless stalling: TXQ MAX DEPTH?

I recently updated to Lion and didn't keep any backup of the local library for my installed apps on the iPad.\nNow when I'm trying to update to the latest version of iOS it tells me this:\n\nBut when I'm trying to Sync Apps it tells me this:\n\nThe thing is that I don't have any apps right now in my iTunes library and my question is: How can I backup my existing apps from my iPad without losing them? \nI really want to avoid downloading them all again, since some of the apps (like VLC) are not even in the AppStore anymore and I don't want to jailbreak it.\n\nA: First, you should authorize your computer with your iPad if you haven't already. \n\n\n*\n\n*From the Store menu, choose Authorize Computer.\n\n*In the dialog that appears, the Apple ID button is selected by default. If you have an  AOL account, select AOL.\n\n*Enter your Apple ID or AOL screen name and password, then click the Authorize button.\n\n\nThen, transfer your purchases: \nFrom the File menu, choose \"Transfer Purchases from \"Lipis' iPad\" \"\nWait for iTunes to complete the transfer. \nCheck in your library for your apps and the like.\nThen you can sync without worry.\n", "Q: Screencapture with zooming In Snow Leopard when I used a screencapture program (⇧⌃⌘4) on the screen area that was zoomed in (by using ⌃ + mouse wheel) the resulting screen shot has the same zoom factor. Super useful when I wanted to take some small, detailed screen shot.\nIn 10.7 screencapture ignores the zoom factor and resulting screen shot is in 1:1 scale.\nIs there some defaults setting, or anything else, that could bring back the SnowLeopard behavior?\n\nA: The answer appears to be \"No\". I have also tested this with the commercial screen-capture utility SnagIt, and it behaves the same way, which is different in Lion from the way it behaved in Snow Leopard.\nMy suggested work-around is to use Automator's built-in \"Scale Images\" action to create a workflow to scale your screen shots to the size you want.\n\n[Commercial programs such as GraphicConverter and Pixelmator can scale screen captures, and they also provide additional Automator actions with additional capabilities. You can see some of these in the example above--I own both GraphicConverter and Pixelmator, so these additional options are visible under Automator on my system.]\n", "Q: How do you burn a CD in iTunes? How do you burn a CD within iTunes?\nI want to be able to burn some music to a CD, but I just can't find the option.\n\nA: Select a bunch of songs, pick File → New Playlist from Selection, name it, and pick File → Burn Playlist to Disc.\n\nA: As Sören says, you cannot arbitrarily pick a selection of songs and burn them in one step, you can only burn a playlist.  This does give you the opportunity to ensure that the total length will fit on your disc at least, but it does seem a little pointless.\n", "Q: Copying Files From Windows Share To OSX Share Results In Access Denied When copying files/folders from a share on a Windows server to a share on our OSX (10.4.7 Server) using a Snow Leopard workstation. The Linux workstations get \"Access Denied\" errors.\nAll users are using the same credentials.\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows users can access the files on the OSX Server.\n\n*OSX workstations can access the files.\n\n*Linux workstations and the (admin) user logged on to the OSX sever itself cannot access the files.\n\n\nOn the OSX server itself, the folder has a little red indicator on it with a line through the icon. Get Info -> Ownership & Permission has \"You have [No Access]\".\n\n\n\n*\n\n*I looked into chmod -R -N on the server, but I guess this version of OSX Server does not support then -N switch. Anyway, I would rather get to the root cause.\n\n*This only happens on files/folders that are copied from a separate Windows server's share. Folders/Files created by the OSX workstations can be access everywhere fine.\n\n*All copying is being done from the Snow Leopard OSX Workstations.\n\n*Tried copying the files from the Windows Servers to the local workstation, then copying them to the OSX server, same result.\nAny suggestions as to where to begin debugging this? Is there anyway for the Snow Leopard users to copy files from the Windows server to the OSX server without copying permissions? (or ACLs?)\nUPDATE: By checking \"Ignore ownership on this volume\" for the volume in question, I am now allowed to access the folders on the OSX server itself. However the Linux clients still cannot access said folders. And this actually locks out the OSX workstations from accessing said folders.\n\nA: Just open the shared folder in Finder where you want to copy. And open its info tab. In that you will find the permission section at the bottom. In that change the permission to read & write to everybody. I encountered the same problem and I solved it this way. To edit permission you will need super user access.\n\nA: This probably should have been asked on the Linux StackExchange. But I figured it out. \nOur Linux workstations fstab entry was wrong, changing it from smbfs to cifs and adding the uid=linuxuser option to the entry seems to have fixed the Linux access issues. \nThis does not fix the folder access on the OSX server itself. However, it is not stopping production so I am not too worried about it right now.\n", "Q: Options for recovering deleted files I deleted a file last week (a PDF in this case). While I'm able to reconstruct the information I need in this case, I'd like to take precautions against this happening again. \nIs there anything built into the OS that will let me recover files? Will enabling time machine allow me to do this? (I don't want it to be taking up lots of room on disc.) Am I best off purchasing a program such as DiskWarrior, or are there free options to do this? \nHow can I set up 10.6 so that it'll be easier for me to recover deleted files? \nEdit: \"Deleted\" means I emptied the trash. \n\nA: If your data is in any way important, you should consider  taking proper backups on a reasonable schedule.  If you are not familiar with the tools available, then the key is to use something simple that you can understand.  For most people, this is indeed Time Machine.  It will backup your whole computer, including your personal documents.  Recovery is simple, particularly if you know where the file was located before you deleted it, but is simple enough to search for also so long as you can remember roughly what it was called.\nThe requirements to use Time Machine are\n1) A spare hard disk partition, you can partition your own internal drive into 2 but this will obviously reduce your working space and will not protect you from a full disk failure.  The better option is to get yourself an external USB disk drive.  The drive needs to be at least equal to the size of the disk you want to backup, but for preference should be 2x bigger to allow for revisions and history etc\n2) Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) onwards.\nTo set up TM, just plug your disk in, and the system will simply ask if you want to use it for backups.  Once you say yes, it will backup changes hourly so long as it is connected.  If you disconnect for any reason (you have a laptop and travel with it leaving your backup at home) the changes will just stack up and then be pushed onto your backup disk when it is next plugged in.  If you forget to plug it in for any length of time, it will eventually start to remind you that it has been X days since the last backup.\nOnce you have a backup completed, you can recover files individually, or whole folders, or the entire system onto a fresh disk/computer.\nEDIT: I see Disk Warrior recommended a lot, but to me it seems like it's a tool for people who are desperate having already lost data.  It will potentially help you recover a \"lost\" file (but this is never guaranteed).  It's a bit like shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted.  If you had a backup, you would not need to use this sort of software, but that requires you to be pro-active.  Also, it costs $99, and you could buy a backup drive of 1Tb or more with that kind of cash, and be better protected in the future.  You just had a near miss, so luckily you appear to have got away with it this time, but better to be proactive and backup, then reactive and try to \"undelete\" etc.\n\nA: \nWill enabling time machine allow me to do this?\n\nYes. In Finder, browse to the folder containing the file, then go to Time Machine, browse to the backup from a week ago, and you'll see the file and a button to recover it.\n\nA: Time Machine is a good option, but it requires you to be using your home computer and connected to your backup drive.\nI recommend Dropbox as a slightly more-robust solution. You get a free account with 2GB of cloud-based storage, and an app for your computer (any platform). When you put something in your Dropbox folder, it is automatically uploaded to the cloud.\nDropbox gives you tools to easily restore deleted files, as well as browse and restore previous versions of existing files. It's always on and works instantly from any computer (no backup disk required).\n\nA: To recover a deleted file, use TestDisk.\n It is a command line tool, but it works great. I was able to recover what I needed using testdisk. I may have used PhotoRec (same developer, included in the testdisk download), but I don't remember.\nOne thing I would not recommend is TechTool. It has caused our computer to crash.\n\nA: Deleting a file and emptying the trash in OS X will delete a file much more permanently than in a Windows environment, thanks to a *nix daemon that clears deleted files with prejudice.\nTime Machine is an excellent option to recover files you've accidentally deleted, but this requires a spare volume you'd be willing to dedicate to this purpose and regularly connect to your computer. Depending on how you set your preferences, it will back up your files every X number of minutes, pushing delta updates via rsync, which will effectively give you \"snapshots\" of your system at any point in time using a super-slick Apple interface. Definitely try it out if you think you could use it.\n", "Q: Associating ssh public key with user account How do I associate an ssh public key with a user account on the machine I connect to, so I don't have to type in the account password every time I make an ssh connection to that machine?\nThe machine being connected to is an older mini with Leopard installed. I assume that this is doable in Leopard, and I don't have to upgrade to Snow Leopard or Lion.\n\nA: First, you create a public and private key (if you haven't done so already) on the machine from which you want to login:\nssh-keygen -t dsa\n\nYou only need to do this if there isn't already a ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub file.\nOn Linux, there's the ssh-copy-id helper. On Mac, you need to copy the public key by hand:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the generated public key to the target machine:\nscp ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub user@targetmachine:myPublicKey.pub\n\n*Login to the target machine:\nssh user@targetmachine\n\n*Append the public key to the authorized keys:\ncat myPublicKey.pub >>.ssh/authorized_keys\n\n*You can now delete the copied key:\nrm myPublicKey.pub\n\n*Done. You should now be able to login to your target machine without the need to enter a password.\n\nA: You should have an id_dsa.public file in your ~/.ssh folder.\nJust copy that file over to the server, into ~/.ssh folder and append its contents to the authorized_keys file.\nYour next login should be automatic. It can be that you're asked about the password you used to created the private key, but there's an option to store that password into your keychain.\n", "Q: Expanding recently added songs In my iPhone is there a way to get more \"recently added\" songs?\nI have about 100 songs and I have added recently 5, now in my \"recently added\" I've got only those 5.\n\nA: Recently Added is a smart playlist. In iTunes, select it, go to File → Edit Smart Playlist, and change the criteria. For example:\n\nRe-syncing your iPhone will apply these changes.\n", "Q: Damage replacement plan / Insurance for Mac Book Pro? I used to own a Dell with a pretty beefy replacement plan.  When I bought my MBP, I asked if there was any similar coverage and the \"genius\" said no.  I search around online and found a company called Safeware, but it would be hard for me to believe that this would be the only company around doing this. \nDoes anyone own insurance like what Dell offers for their Mac?  Has anyone ever destroyed their computer and got a replacement?\n\nA: Apple does not offer any insurance like that with Applecare. I think Dell only offers it because replacing a piece of equipment is ultimately really cheap for them, but Apple doesn't play Dell's game (and that is probably part of the reason why you purchased an Apple product). \nGoing by the fact that you are in the USA, I think this would depend on the type of damages for which you are seeking insurance, which you don't specify in your question. Renter's or home insurance would protect against theft from your home (rent or own, respectively). Damage incurred while being on the road would probably fall under some kind of business insurance, though I'd imagine you would pay a pretty hefty penny for that level of care no matter who you call. \nI think your best course action would be to call your insurance company and see what they have to offer that best suits your particular needs.\n", "Q: Screen flickers, stops after brightness change Whenever I am using my 2006 Macbook for a while, the screen starts flickering, from one shade of brightness to another. When I change the brightness, it stops. It also occurs right after startup or when coming out of sleep mode. It is running the second to latest version of Snow Leopard, though the problem has been occurring ever since Tiger. \n\nA: From my experience this could either point to a defective inverter board or a simple short-circuit on the cable that runs from the logic board to the display through the display hinge. I´d suggest visiting your nearest Apple Reseller / Apple Store or (if you´re technically experienced) trying the repair yourself (a new Inverter Board will set you back around 50$, but the do-it-yourself-repair is really not that easy).\n", "Q: How to determine out what Wi-Fi channel is used from the command line?

I've got a 13\" 2009 MBP (8GB, 2.53Ghz). A lot of the time it runs a Win 7 web dev environment (Visual Studio, SQL Server databases, various editors, Photoshop etc.) under Parallels Desktop. It performs at least as well as a high-end Wintel laptop would if not better.\nOn the Mac end of things, I also mess around with Garageband and Coda, edit video and photos with iMovie and am learning Objective-C using XCode. And also for general use (web, email, officey-stuff, iTunes, DVD viewing etc). The laptop handles all this extremely well and although its a couple of years old now, I see no reason to upgrade to a newer model.\nHowever, I'm very taken with the new (Summer '11) Macbook Air - they're light as a feather and most appealing. On paper, the 1.8Ghz i5 looks like its a bit weedy, but it has SSD. Is it going to perform as well or better than my current machine for the sorts of things I do with it or should I just invest in an SSD for my MBP?\nUPDATE: Following the advice from @Benjamin Dubois and @user9902 to install an SSD in my current machine I did just that. For anyone who is wavering between buying an Air (and the 2012 editions are considerably more appealing than the 2011 model that seduced me at the time of posting this question) I would strongly suggest trying this option before splashing out big money on shiny new toys. After the installation of a sub-£100 128GB SSD the MBP absolutely flies. I would recommend this option without reservation. \n\nA: The CPU will be adequate, but the MacBook Air is limited to 4 GB of RAM. This effectively gives you somewhere between 1 and 1.5 GB for your Windows 7 VM, which is not much. While the SSD will make for much faster IO than the HDD in your MBP, I expect you'll be doing a lot of pageouts.\n\nA: Stick with a macbook pro : virtualization needs quite a lot of CPU power (there are 2 computers running in there !). \nBut you could also be just fine with a SSD in your current MBP (I have the same than yours, with à X25-M postville and 8gb/ram, and it is really fast).\n\nA: You will probably find it runs better, because of the SSD, even with less memory.  I'm sure you would get better performance putting an SSD in your existing machine, but then it's still 6lb...\nI moved from a late 2007 MBPro with 4GB RAM to a mid-2010 MBA with 4GB of RAM, running Windows 7 under Fusion.  It's DRAMATICALLY better, though I don't do heavy software development (so take my experience for what it's worth).  \nRumour has it there's a \"thin and light\" MBPro coming soon, which would likely support 8GB of RAM - but then you can always be waiting for the latest and greatest.  \nThe post above mentions more page-outs.  You probably would see more page-outs, but their impact is probably less severe because of the very fast disk...\n\nA: According to a AnandTech review of the Macbook Air, its CPU actually performs well against older Macbook Pro models.

If I buy a lot of ram for my new iMac (16GB), is there a way to make the system cache my most frequently used applications so the launch time is much faster? \n\nA: It's an oversimplification, but this is essentially what Unix does with its memory in the first place.  If you don't shut down your computer and don't close your apps, your most frequently used apps will always be in memory ready for you to use.  Apps you don't use will get swapped to disk (assuming you ever run out of RAM  :-)\nIn Lion especially, you can almost forget about quitting apps by hand.\n", "Q: How to manually restore emails in Lion? Before upgrading to Mac OS X Lion with a clean install, I backed up Mail app according to this article on Apple Discussions. I know have the com.apple.mail file and the Mail directory and I have no idea how to restore it. As it seems, theses paths have changed. Do you have any ideas on how to restore my emails?\n\nA: Put the contents of the mail directory in /Users/yourusername/Library/Mail (or  ~/Library/Mail in other words)\ncom.apple.mail.plist goes to /Users/yourusername/Library/Preferences (~/Library/Preferences)\n\nA: Firstly copy the com.apple.mail.plist from the backup to the user library (~/Library/preferences) and it does ask to replace, just click yes. \n\nSecondly copy the mail folder to the user library (~/Library) and when complete, just open mail as normal.\n\n", "Q: Will Time Capsule work on a college dorm's WiFi network? My daughter is headed off to college. I'd like to send her off with a Time Capsule so she can wirelessly backup her MacBook automatically.\nMy concern is that Time Capsule will not work properly on her dorm's WiFi network, which she clearly won't have access to from a management perspective.\nI know she can connect her MacBook to Time Capsule via ethernet but that is effectively a manual backup and I know that my kids (and many others) won't do that every night.\nDoes anyone have any more information on this or know how this could work?\n\nA: She could probably tie the time capsule into a ethernet line in her dorm (I assume there is a wired option) and then set the time capsule to be on bridge mode (where it doesn't issue a new IP adress but rather passes the one issued by the school's DHCP).\nShe could then use her Time Capsule (which is also a wifi router) to have her own private wifi locked down for her dorm, this is what I do in my house as Telus doesn't offer DSL modems as a standalone.\n\nA: The best answer for laptop backup in a college dorm is NOT an Apple Time Capsule. Everyone here has already examined why that won't work well at length.\nIf you haven't bought the Time Capsule yet, don't. Go with a simple bus-powered USB or FireWire mobile hard drive, like the WD Passport. Get one larger than the laptop's internal drive and configure it for Time Machine.\nIf she just leaves it on her desk and learns to plug it in whenever she's working there with her computer, she'll be covered. As a recent college student (who used to advise his dorm-mates on that sort of thing), I'll attest that this is pretty easy for most people to condition themselves to do, and if it doesn't, it'll only take ONE case of data loss to teach them soundly how to practice good backup habits.\n\nA: Extending the network might be a little fussy and require some help/advice/rights from the school, but that won't affect setting up the Time Capsule.\nThis slightly defeats the point, but a Time Capsule can also run as a standalone unit in such a way where you don't have to get the cords out, but you switch to the offline Time Capsule network and make your wireless back up that way; sort of a one-to-one wireless network.\n\nA: Fred,\nIf the dorm does not have wired jacks, the latest TimeCapsule equipment can extend or relay a WiFi network, without needing any Ethernet cable.  It can pick up the dorm WiFi, and relay the same network name, or give it a new network name.  If using a new network name with security on, then only your daughter would be able to see it and get on it.\nIf the dorm tries to prevent the double NAT WiFi relay, you can use an Airport Express to pick up the dorm WiFi, then run an Ethernet cable from it to the TimeCapsule WAN port, and create a private WiFi for her and her other devices.\nI'm @terretta on Twitter if you need to reach me to discuss further.\n\nA: As long as your daughter is allowed more than one device on the network, the TimeCapsule can join the net just like an iPod Touch or her Mac can.\nJust as her mac needs to be secured, her TimeCapsule needs a good password, but there is nothing inherently wrong about backing up to \"her\" Time Capsule using another WiFi network in between her mac and her capsule.\nShe should have an ethernet cable to speed things up if she has a large backup or restore. Unless the network is locked down with 802.1x or some web client for authentication, she will have no problems.\nThere are ways to get around those issues, but it's a bit of a pain and not likely to be an issue either.\nAnd of course - If she gets an ethernet drop in the room, she can secure things much better. Her mac can be set to prefer her room's WiFi connection created from her TimeCapsule and she will get the benefit of less access to her TimeCapsule disk (only people she shares her WiFi password with can even see the volume) as well as possibly faster backups and internet access since her Mac to TimeCapsule throughput may very well be significantly faster than the WiFi throughput in her room to the nearest campus base station. It's likely there will be less other traffic on her private WiFi network as well so this is a superior option for the reasons listed.\n\nA: All of the other answers here address some of the technical issues about getting it connected to the network, except for one.  \nEver tried to use WiFi in a dorm?  It is nearly impossible.  Everybody likes to bring their own wireless routers and access points, flooding the spectrum, making it practically unusable.\nIf you do decide to use it, put it in bridge mode and plug it in.  Don't use WiFi and expect it to work all of the time, and at any decent speed.\n\nA: A lot of it depends on how the network is configured, but most likely it will not work.  You also might not want to do it, because the connection may or may not be encrypted, so other users on the network would be able to sniff all the files being backed up to the device.  The best bet would probably be to use something like Dropbox if there are not gigs of data to be saved.   \n\nA: It will work. Time capsule is a base station, it is not a client station. Your kid can sign on to the college wifi and time capsule separately.\n", "Q: Need location of image for preference pane \"PREF\" icon I have a stack in my Dock with aliases to my most-used preference panes. In the past, the icons that appear in the grid when I click on the stack have been the large descriptive icons shown in Finder. Since upgrading to Lion, instead, I'm getting new icons. The descriptive icon is small, surrounded by a gear, and the word PREF is under it. At a glance, it's no longer possible to tell which preference pane is which.\nFinder doesn't show these large \"gear/PREF\" icons; the stack and QuickLook do.\nWhere might I find the image for this icon so I can start figuring out how to replace it?

Michel Fortin’s Multi-Safari actually makes it possible to test websites in old versions of Safari, should you feel the need.\nUnfortunately, the Multi-Safari version of Safari 2 doesn’t quite work properly in Snow Leopard. For me, it worked for a few minutes. Then, for no apparent reason, it stopped loading web pages — the progress bar would stay stuck at a fairly short length, and the status bar would say it was waiting for the web site.\nIs there any way to get it working reliably on Snow Leopard?\n\nA: Safari 2, sorry, why would you need to test for that? It's REALLY not in use by anyone anymore. \nAnyway, the best way I can think of running it is to virtualise an earlier version of OS X - Tiger or Jaguar.\n", "Q: How to stop flood of Non-Local IPv6 events in my Console (system.log)? For some reason, my Console is filling up with <8/15/11 6:47:12.000 PM kernel: IPv6 Non-Local address> messages. A quick Google doesn't tell me much and there's nothing on some of the usual boards.

I cannot reply to emails on my iPad 2, but if I compose a new one it will send it fine. This is a new problem as it was working fine before and there have been no changes. \nI use a Telstra Micro SIM and an optus email address.\n\nA: I believe that what is happening is that you have multiple email accounts setup, and when you go to compose you are using the outgoing of account A, and when you reply/forward you are attempting to use the outgoing of account B.\nSo to fix, check your outgoing account settings for the account that you cannot reply emails for.\n\nA: Usually deleting an app or an account and re-downloading it / reentering your account details—with a hard restart in between—will fix such errors. \n\nA: Thanks all.

I have heard horror stories of people rackin gup huge bills for roaming charges, so how do I ensure the iphone won't use cellular data/3g?\n\nA: In the Settings App, go to General -> Network.\nFlip the switch beside Cellular Data to OFF.\nThat is all. I don't have a data plan and I leave it off and have never been surprised by additional charges on my bill. \n\nA: I just leave my iPhone in \"airplane\" mode after arriving at my destination (it is reassuring to know that this is enabled since you can easily see the airplane icon in the menubar so you know that you will not be sending/receiving any cell data).  Then open up the Settings app and in the WiFi settings turn WiFi back on (but leave the Airplane mode \"on\") so that you can use your iPhone for WiFi only access.\nAnother tip is to set up a Google Voice account (google.com/voice). Configure the voicemail/text settings in Google Voice to send you an email (enable transcribing) when you get a voicemail (don't forget to record your voicemail greeting).  Download the Google Voice app to your iPhone and configure for your account.  The last thing I do before I board the plane leaving the USA is set my iPhone to forward all calls to my Google Voice phone number and then I will receive an email overseas alerting me to any voicemails with a pretty good translation (at least enough to know whether or not I need to bother returning the call before coming home).  You can also use the Google Voice app to text for free through a WiFi connection.\nWhile you are using WiFi, don't forget that you can use FaceTime to connect with another FaceTime account.  When you get back into the USA, don't forget to disable the phone forwarding after you disable the Airplane Mode.  While your phone has forwarding enabled, you will see a phone with an arrow icon in the iPhone's menubar to remind you that it has been enabled.\nI passed along an older iPhone to my daughter (who is not old enough for a phone yet) to use as a pseudo-iPod Touch and did the same thing...just enabled airplane mode and turned on WiFi.\n", "Q: A Windows' Ctrl+Z equivalent for OSX On many operating systems if you want to undo something you can press Ctrl+Z.

I like to group my bookmarks into Folders in the Bookmark Bar.\nBut I cannot find an easy way to delete these bookmarks!\nThe only way I know to do this is to go to Show All Bookmarks, then browse down to the shortcut and select it and delete it - this totally gets in the way of workflow.\nIs there any way to delete a Foldered bookmark from the bookmark bar?!\nNB - I am not talking about standalone bookmarks, deleting those is easy and intuitive.\n\nA: Since it's a folder, hold down the Command and Option keys, then drag the folder off the Bookmarks Bar. You'll get a confirmation dialog saying \"Are you sure?\" Just click the Delete Folder button in the dialog.\nHolding the Command and Control keys keys down gets you a contextual menu that allows you to edit the name of the folder, edit its contents (jumps you to the Bookmarks window to do that), delete it, copy it, and a few other things.\n\nA: Using Open-Book-Icon probably is the easiest way to delete Safari folded bookmark\n\nA: We're talking about the Bookmarks Bar in Safari, right?\nHold down the Command key and drag it off—poof, disappears. \nSame thing with Finder toolbar (plus you can add anything you like to Finder Toolbar by holding down Command key while you drag it into place.)\n\nA: Hit option+command+B.

However, in order to test mobile websites and such, I need my devices to connect to my MacBook Air.\nI can create a wireless network from the Wi-Fi menu, but that knocks me off the main wireless connection, so both my MacBook and my iPod have no internet. I used to be able to create a second wireless ad-hoc network in Windows that my devices could connect to, while my laptop would remain connected to the main wireless network, but I am unable to find a similar option in Mac.\nIs there any such feature in mac at all? If so, how can I use it?\nI am not against using the Terminal.

We both need to be able mount and use the share without disrupting processes running under each user. \n\nA: I just tried the same thing, without any problems... Do you use user accounts to authenticate the users on the time capsule ? If yes, you should probably configure it to use the airport network.

There's no Set Content button when I add a media source in Plex (0.9.3.4) to select a metadata provider.\nI've installed Plex on a Mac Mini running Lion and added a content source.  To add the source, I went to Video Plugins -> Add Source.  I added a folder called movies from my smb share by clicking Browse, selecting the folder, and clicking OK.\nNow all tutorials and screenshots I've seen show a \"Set Content\" button on the Add Video Source menu, and this button allows you to set a metadata content provider.  I see all the buttons (Browse, Add, Remove, OK, Cancel) except Set Content.  \nHow do I set a metadata provider for Plex if there's no Set Content button?\n\nA: Plex comes with 2 components:  The browser and the media manager or media server.  The media manager is what manages your movie library.  If you just go into Video Plugins and select Add Source, then Plex just treats it as a random collection of videos, not movies, and you cannot assign a metadata provider.\nTo add movies with the metadata providers, you have to add them to the Media Manager.  You access the media manager by clicking on the small Plex icon up by your system clock.\n", "Q: iPad 2 Wifi + 3G With iOS 4.3.3 has no multitasking gestures? I recently bought an iPad 2 Wifi + 3G.

In Safari, when you Ctrl-click on an image in any web page, a menu comes up with several options.\nI'd like to be able to do a single trackpad click with a modifier key (option or command, for example) on an image, and have just one of the options from the menu be invoked immediately, instead of showing a menu.\nI haven't been able to find a way to do this, but maybe I'm missing something.\nI have older hardware so multi-touch gestures won't help me much.\nI've also tried the Custom Application Keyboard shortcut approach, but my shortcut was not invoked when I tried it. The menu item is 'Save Image to “Downloads”' and I think I've got the quotes right, but I also tried with plain double quotes (not typographic quotes) and that didn't get invoked either.\nI'm open minded about using scripting or a third party add on app to do this, just looking for the quickest approach that really works and cuts the workflow to a minimum.\n\nA: This is not a perfect solution for your needs, but FruitMenu from Unsanity is the only utility I am aware of that will let you customize contextual menus. It costs US $15.00. It is not yet compatible with Lion. You could download a trial version and see if it will be helpful.\nAny keyboard macro program such as Keyboard Maestro should be able to achieve what you need. You might briefly see a contextual menu pop up while it is running its macro, but I think you could live with that.\n\nA: I've been using USB Overdrive for years, though I don't know if it works on Lion yet.

I got a newsletter to go to store.kagi.com It's an offer to buy an update to the discontinued video converting software Visualhub by Techspansion. What makes it a bit suspicious that there is no contact whatsoever to ask if this is the real deal. I'm a fan of Visualhub no question but an anon update to a discontinued product? Would you buy this though?\n\nA: No.\nTechspansion is not affiliated with the product \"vHub Updater\" by Kagi.\n\"vHub Updater\" makes unauthorized use of Techspansion's copyrighted code.\nTechspansion does not support \"vHub Updater\" and does not recommend its use.\nOur official (and free) patches for Lion are at http://www.techspansion.com\n", "Q: Can I encrypt an external harddisk which is in HFS+?

While the Disk Utility GUI application cannot, the diskutil command-line utility can do this.\nFirst, come up with a password (such as myVerySecurePassword). I believe this is not tied to your login password, unlike encrypting the boot volume.\nThen, find out the identifier for the target volume, e.g. disk1s1:\ndiskutil list\n\nThen, use diskutil cs convert, like so:\ndiskutil cs convert disk1s1 -passphrase myVerySecurePassword\n\n", "Q: Why MBP 13' has only 1280x800 res. when the MBA with the SAME graphic card has 1440x900? I mean, both use Intel HD Graphics 3000, and the MBP actually has a better processor. If they use the same Intel graphic card (and according to the website, the same info \"13.3-inch LED-backlit glossy widescreen display\", so they don't say they are different), how come MBP can't have 1440x900? What is the technical limitation of Apple hardware in MBP that justify this difference?\n\nA: The simple answer is that the MBP doesn't have a screen that can display 1440x900 - it's native resolution is 1280x800 (ie. it only has that many pixels). This is a physical limitation, not a software limitation. There is no point in sending a higher resolution image to the screen, since it can't display any higher detail.\nI can't tell you why Apple chose a higher resolution display for the 13\" MBA than the 13\" MBP, given that I wasn't party to those decisions. The reasoning may be purely historical, however. The white MacBooks had a resolution of 1280x800. Apple introduced an aluminum unibody version of the MacBook with the same display in 2008. By mid-2009, Apple decided to rebrand the unibody MacBook as the 13\" MacBook Pro - still keeping the 1280x800 display. My guess is that they just haven't gotten around to changing it yet. \n\nA: Your graphics card is capable of this and higher display resolutions, just not with the included LCD display.  If you attach an external monitor you will notice it can go way higher, but obviously the hardware has to support this.  The native resolution of your screen is a maximum of 1280x800, so it will not offer higher than than.  It's worth noting that for the display to look crisp you should use a resolution that matches your native hardware, you can for example run a higher resolution and scale it down, but it will look bad, also you can run a higher resolution and have it scroll around so that it does not fit in your screen, but I wouldn't reccommmend this.\n\nA: No there's no technical reason why not - it was just a decision made by Apple. I must say it renders the 13\" MBP a bit of an oddity in the Mac lineup, as it makes it a lot less desirable.\n", "Q: Have iOS apps. Can I use them on my Mac Mini? I bought many iOS Apps on various iPads and iPod touchs. This Wednesday I will have my first Mac, a Mac Mini, so my question is: Will I be able to download these Apps without any charge, if they are available on Mac Store?\nI ask this because I have been watching some videos and have seen GarageBand on the Mac but I don't know if it's the same App. I know that the App Store and Mac Store are different, but, like some Apps on AppStore have a plus symbol on their icons corners saying these Apps can be run on iPad, iPod touch and iPhone I wonder whether there will be some Apps for both iOS and the Mac.\nAlso, I don't know if GarageBand was released on Mac before iOS devices.\n\nA: At the moment, you can't really do this. Although I suspect that Apple is looking to integrate iOS and macOS in the future so that this sort of thing can be done (purely speculation).\nGarageBand on the Mac is different from the iPad version (it's more comprehensive) and it has been available on macOS for far longer than on iOS.\nIt is possible to run iOS apps in the Simulator app that comes with Xcode. However, it's not as simple as downloading an app from the App Store. You'd have to get the source code for the app, compile it in Xcode and run in the Simulator. Most apps being closed source, this won’t be possible!\n\nA: In general no - one reason is that the processor in the iPads/iPhones etc is an ARM one and in Macs is now an Intel x86 and used to be a PPC, the instruction sets are just completely different.\n\nA: and yes, GarageBand was released a long time on Macs before it was released on iOS.\nNot only the problem with iOS apps are that they are compiled for a different processor (ARMs), the fact that they rely on touch for it's interface instead of a mouse/keyboard would make them practically useless on a Mac.\nThere is a simulator for iOS apps under development in Xcode, but you can't run apps that have been bought already, only the ones you are developping yourself, and is only practical for test purposes, to take out the bugs.\n", "Q: Google Calendar reminders for events created on iPhone I use Google Calendar with an iPhone, syncing several calendars. My main calendar has default reminders set up so that if I create an event on the web, I get emails and SMS messages. When I create an event on the iPhone though, I don't get these default alerts. \nIs there any way to configure the phone or the calendar so that, when I create an event on the phone, the default alerts work the same way they do if the event is created on the web?\n\nA: No, the built-in Calendar application does not have a default alert setting.\nHowever, third-party apps can do it (and access the same calendars). For example, Quick Event (found here) looks like what you want.\n\nA: In the past, I have set default alerts for my Google Calendar via the web interface, and no alerts on my iPhone. When doing this, the alerts do not appear in the iPhone calendar app immediately. The alerts will be added server-side, and will appear when the iPhone re-syncs the calendar (usually within a couple of seconds in my experience).\nOne question, though. Is your Google Calendar account set up through Google Sync? When I tried using Google Sync to handle my calendars, I found that my alerts were not synced properly.\n\nA: This doesn't solve your problem just yet, and it's possible there will be some wrinkle that will prevent it from doing so in the future, but when Apple releases iOS 5 and iCloud, supposedly all the events you set up on your phone will sync back to your mac immediately (I'm assuming you're using a Mac, which may be incorrect).\nSo, as roundabout as it is, it seems that if you start running iCloud in the near future, when you create a new event on your phone, what should happen is this iPhone > iCloud > Desktop > Google > alert to iPhone. This is obviously kind of unwieldy. For whatever its worth, I've been using Calvetica on the iPhone for a while, and you can specify a default alert in that.\n", "Q: Bootcamp and Filevault 2 boot to OS X before a restart allows Windows to load I've got a mid 2011 MBA with Windows 7 running via Bootcamp. In Lion, i've enabled Filevault 2.\nNormally, when I turn my laptop on, I first enter the filevault password before the laptop boots into OS X. \nIf I am trying to boot into Windows, I hold down alt/option, select the Windows partition and let the laptop boot. However, what seems to happen is, the filevault screen that normally shows when I first turn my laptop on shows, I enter the password and I seem to end up in OS X! I then need to restart, hold down alt/option and select the Windows partition again. This then gets me in.\nIs this normal behaviour? Or is there something I need to change?\n\nA: I think it's a timing issue, you need to ensure that you press the option key early enough in the boot process to stop the normal boot and subsequent Fielvault login.  The best way to do this is to ensure you have not muted the machine to you get the \"bong\" noise when you start/restart your machine.  You need to hit alt/option immediately when you hear this, and keep it pressed for 5 seconds or so.\n\nA: I agree with stuffe, timing is the key. Alternatively you can select the desired boot volume in System Preferences > Startup Volume. That might save you some of the hassle.\nAnd I do hope you have a backup in place with TimeMachine and you have your FileVault recovery key set in a safe location. I fear FileVault more than I fear data loss. I love Apple and I love security but I can never recommend FileVault to standard users. (My 2¢)\n", "Q: Cannot \"slide to unlock\" when iPhone is in dock. Any idea why? I have a third-party iPhone dock connected directly to the mains. I found that I cannot unlock my iPhone 3GS when it is in the dock. The slider just slides back and doesn't follow the finger's movement completely.\nAny idea why?\n\nA: Strange issue...\nI would guess that the dock is somehow interfering with the capacitive 'field' of the screen. You could confirm this by unlocking the device before connecting it to the dock and see if the rest of the interface is affected in the same way.\nThough I guess the only way to proceed would be to get the dock replaced (if it's under warranty) and see if that fixes the problem or buy a different one.\n", "Q: iTunes smart playlist based on folders? I have 2 folders one called \"Ambient\" and one called \"Dance\", sometime I add new songs to these folders and then I do File -> Add Folder to Library\nIs there a way to have 2 playlists, based on the songs' directory ?\n\nA: Smart playlists use the META data that is stored within the audio files themselves to make selections based on your criteria.  Example of META data include the song title, length, rating, and so on.  The folder that the audio file is stored in is not considered meta data, and is not referenced at any point within the audio file itself - this is managed by the iTunes library XML file instead.  So you cannot do exactly what you are doing, but you might be able to acheive it by changing your methods.\nInstead of splitting your tracks by genre into seperate folders and then importing them, change your methods to tag the files with the appropriate META data after importing to select a suitable genre.  After importing tracks, no matter where they are located (and as an aside I would always reccommend using both allowing iTunes to manage your media, as well as copying into your library rather than just referencing them to their existing locations) just select them all, right click and select get info, and them change the genre to either Dance, or Ambience etc.  Then create a smart playlist that searches for audio files that match the Dance or Ambient genre META data.\n", "Q: How to use auto-updatable templates with Word 2011? I would like to have a template that I can update and be able to auto-update the documents using this templates.\nCurrently I wasn't able to find a way to convince Word 2011 to update a document based on the changes made to the template.\n\nA: Just like in the Windows version, this is done via the menu: Tools > Templates and add-ins.\nIn the dialog box that appears, check \"automatically update document styles\". And of course set the correct template if necessary.\nEach time you open the document, and the template location can be found, the styles will be updated to match those from the template.\n\n", "Q: Can I turn pages in ebook with single touch? I am considering the purchase of the iPad2 and among other things, the one that bother me is this -- you can turn pages when reading an ebook with hand gesture, i.e. moving finger from left to right with nice animation. This is cool for starter.\nBut I want something 100% traditional -- just touch of the finger on left or right edge of the screen, and I would get just next/previous page. No animation, no moving hand.\nIs this possible on iPad? If yes -- is it device settings, or given app?\n\nA: Yes it is. At least in the iBooks app (the one from Apple). I don't know about the Kindle app, but I'm pretty sure it's possible as well.\nYou can make a single touch in the right or left part of the screen to go to the next or previous page in your eBook.\n", "Q: Remove 2nd partition, reclaim space If I have a dual booting computer (os x 10.7 and Linux), and would like to remove the Linux partition and return it to one single large disk running os x, how is this done? Is there risk to messing up os x? Do I need to clone the os x side, repartition, and reclone, or is there a simpler method?\n\nA: It's easily done, but for safety you should always backup your data as there is a small chance that things can go wrong.  Check your Time Machine or equivalent is up to date, then open the Disk Utility application.\nSelect the disk from the list of mounted drives on the left that corresponds to your internal disk.  If you look at it's partitions you should see 2 that correspond (roughly, this is the size of the partition, not the filesystem, so don't expect the figures to be 100% exact) to your Mac and Linux areas.  To remove the linux one, it should be as simple as selecting it, and hitting delete.  This will leave a linux shaped hole and leave your Mac partition as it stands.  Next, you can expand the Mac area by dragging it's size in the reference diagram, or manually changing it's size by clicking on it and changing the value in the box.\nWhen you click Apply (sorry, I am not at a Mac and cannot recall the exact wording) it will make the changes which could take some time depending on the size of the partitions.\nTurn off any disk intensive applications including Time Machine for the duration of the operation, and note that you should not reboot or do anything that you may think likely to cause a crash etc (if you use any unstable programs) until it is complete.\nEDIT: An encrypted MAC partition cannot be resized, this is a backup, recreate, and restore scenario.\n", "Q: cmd+/ shortcut gone 1Password shortcut cmd+\\ stopped working on all browsers so I tried to change it to cmd+/ just to try but now I lost cmd+/!\nI tried to reset the keyboard shortcuts to default from the preference page but that didn't help.\nHow can I get cmd+/ back? (the shortcut to show the main window when no window is showing)\nI'm using Lion.\n\nA: When did it stop working, when you upgraded to Lion, or more recently?  Has the shortcut ever worked for you in Lion?\nThere is a new Safari Extension for 1Password within Safari in Lion that is different to what has come before, ensure it is installed and check the shortcut again.  Mine works fine, you may have an old plugin installed.  I don;t use other browsers, so cannot comment, but would imagine that they too have an all new plugin for Lion.\nCMD / should toggle the status bar on/off at the bottom of your browser window in Safari.\n\nA: You need 1Password v3.6.5 or newer to have single keystroke log in to work with Safari 5.1 (Lion or not)\nIt's on their FAQ - http://help.agilebits.com/1Password3/single_keystroke_login.html\n", "Q: Mail.app in Lion - is there a way to create tasks from email? I'm not sure if I haven't seen that in earlier versions of Mail.app, but I would really love to have the ability to create a task in iCal from an email - and that this task could link to the original email. \nMaybe there are some third-party solutions that would let this done easily? \n\nA: It's possible to do that with AppleScript.\nIf you're familiar with this technology, you should just browse iCal and Mail respective dictionary. If not, that's the occasion to become familiar ! This is a great place to start.\nHere's a very basic script you could use (tested on Snow Leopard only, but should work fine on Lion as well) :\ntell application \"Mail\"\n\n    set theSelection to selection\n    set theMessage to first item of theSelection\n    set theSumm to subject of theMessage\n    set theDescription to \"From : \" & sender of theMessage\n    set theUrl to \"message:%3C\" & message id of theMessage & \"%3E\"\n\nend tell\n\ntell application \"iCal\"\n\n    make todo at end of events of (first item of every calendar) with properties {summary:theSumm, description:theDescription, url:theUrl}\n\nend tell\n\nIn order to use it easily in Mail, you should save it in ~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Mail/ (create folders if they don't exist) and activates the Scripts menubar item in preferences of AppleScript Editor. Here's the result when you're in Mail :\n\nYou can also use a productivity tool to launch your script. There are plenty of them out there but I personally use Keyboard Maestro & Alfred.\nThere's a lot of room for improvement. By example, you could set a default alarm, insert it in a given calendar… In order to improve it yourself, use the AppleScript dictionary : it's the best reference you could find. However, those links may be useful as well, as they provide many examples (some are maybe too old) : Scripting Mail & Scripting iCal.\n\nA: In Snow Leopard, I used the MailTag which is a Mail plugin, with the Mail.app.  In MailTag, you are able to create a task which actually created in the iCal.  However, MailTag released a new version for the Mail.app in Lion and temporarily removed this feature.\nSince I am using the Things to manager the daily tasks, I usually just drag the mail message into the Things icon in the Dock and create an task there.  Things will sync the tasks to iCal.\n\nA: There may be an even simpler solution, at least for my needs, using Automator. This solution takes selected text and uses it as the title of a new Reminder in a pre-set iCal calendar/to-do list.\nI launched Automator and chose \"Service\" when it asked me what I wanted to create.\nI left the initial settings at default (\"Service receives selected [text] in [any application]\")\nFrom the Library pane on the left, I selected Calendar, and from the middle pane selected New To Do Item. I then selected Add to: [Existing calendar] and chose a calendar (my default Reminders calendar, which is on iCloud and syncs with my iPhone). Automator assumes (correctly) that you want to feed any selected text into the new To Do item. For my purposes, it made sense to set a default priority by ticking the checkbox and choosing Medium, but your needs may differ.\nI saved the Service as CreateReminder (Automator automatically appended the extension .workflow). Voila, the service shows up in Mail.app when I select text, right-click on it, and select Services > CreateReminder.\nAs a bonus, this lets you create a reminder from selected text in in any application, not just in Mail.app.\n\nA: Theo got it spot on, this is what I did as well:\n\n\nA: I can recommend this third party solution that makes this brain dead easy : Fantastical\nThis will do everything you ask.\n\nFantastical works with your favorite Mac calendar application: iCal,\n  BusyCal, Entourage, or Outlook. You can even use Google Calendar or\n  Yahoo! Calendar\n\nThe key thing about FANTASTICAL is how it creates a new iCal task (or event) purely from natural language analysis.\nAs an example, an extract from this macrumours Fantastical review :\n\nUsing an advanced natural language engine, Fantastical is extremely\n  expressive, allowing users enter event text in their own style. For\n  example, enter a sentence such as \"Lunch with John at 123 Main Street\n  on Tuesday\" and Fantastical will translate the sentence into an event\n  and add it to their calendar.\n\nAn example of how you would create a work flow to gain the ability to add an iCal task or event from an email using Fantastical is :\n( the following assumes you have created a new Automator task to pass clipboard copied text to FANTASTICAL ) :\n\n\n*\n\n*select your email sentence to use for your new task, such as \"get this done by friday\". \n\n*copy this selected task via CMD+C\n\n*hit your predefined shortcut key to process the text copied to your clipboard directly into iCal as a new task (or event) using FANTASTICAL's natural language engine\nOR - (if you prefer not to use Automator ) :\n\n\n*\n\n*select your email sentence to use for your new task, such as \"get this done by friday\". \n\n*copy this selected task via CMD+C\n\n*hit whatever keyboard shortcut you predefined in FANTASTICAL.\n\n*paste your selected text into the FANTASTICAL entry field, then click OK.\n\n*Boom! your new task (or event) has been added into your iCal calendar via FANTASTICAL's incredible \"natural language\" engine.\n\nA: I edited an old AppleScript i found online to work with Reminders. It uses the message subject as the title and the message body as the note. The caveat is iCal must be active or the workflow will fail. I have set iCal to minimize when the Service is run. I also added a launch for Reminders at the end. The only thing I can't seem to figure out is adding a link to the email, but other than that it works well.\non run {input, parameters}\n    tell application \"Calendar\" to activate\n    tell application \"Calendar\"\n        set miniaturized of window 1 to true\n        tell application \"Mail\"\n            set theSelection to selection\n            set theMessage to item 1 of theSelection\n            set theurl to \"message://%3c\" & theMessage's message id & \"%3e\"\n            set thedes to theMessage's content\n            set input to theMessage's subject\n        end tell\n    end tell\n\n   tell application \"Calendar\"\n       tell calendar \"Reminders\"\n           make new todo at end with properties {url:theurl, summary:input, description:thedes}\n       end tell\n    end tell\n    return input\nend run\n\nHope this helps someone!\nKevin\n\nA: You can just drag and drop the email from Mail.app into iCal.\n", "Q: How can I see which processes are draining my macbook battery by percentage? Android devices have a screen that shows you approximately what applications and processes are using your battery, by percentage.\nI'm wondering, in theory, can this be done on a MacBook? How do you think Android determines those numbers?\n\nA: I'd say that what's really being measured there is average CPU usage per application. Then some maths is being done in the background to calculate based on CPU usage how many watts per hour are being consumed per app. Knowing current battery capacity/charge would make that pretty trivial in terms of calculation.\nOn a portable computer, similarly, if an app is really driving your CPU, then your battery is gonna run out faster.\nI'd recommend getting hold of something like iStat Menus which can show you realtime CPU usage in the menu bar as well as a bunch of other stuff. Specifically, the CPU monitor in iStat breaks down CPU usage per application.\n\nA: Remember that overall the programs that you run don't tell the full story about what is using your battery.  I cannot put my hands to the benchmarks but the software you run can account for less than half of the usage.  Consider that you can boot your laptop and leave it at the login screen (assuming you turn off sleeping etc) and it may last 6 hours (guestimate, for say an 11\" macbook Air).  Do the same again and start playing Portal 2, and this might only reduce to 4 hours (anecdotal, from my own usage of said Macbook Air).\nSo just powering the screen, keeping the power to the memory (which uses the same amount of power whether you have 20Mb or 2Gb in use), powering your ports, wireless, bluetooth, capacitive trackpad and so on uses say 2/3rds of your available juice, regardless of use.\nOf the remanding third, you have to apportion it between CPU and GPU in most cases.  CPU use is simple to quantify by looking into Activity Monitor, GPU use less so, especially if you end up running code that uses OPEN CL and pushes CPU tasks onto your GPU...\nI believe that anecdotally the Android phones typically chew approx 60% battery on the screen alone.\nSo in short, I don't think its really feasible, and even if it was it wouldn't be the most important thing to monitor.  I'd be more interested to know if notching your screen brightness down 25% for example would give me an extra X minutes, than if I quit for example DropBox...\n", "Q: How can I combine multiple photos into a single image on my iPhone?

In the last few days every backup took over 100GB of data. I don't know if there is some issue with permissions or something similar, but to be sure I removed all the old backups and reformatted the Time Capsule disk. I've also run filesystem checks and permission checks on my MBP disk using the installation disk.\nThen I've restarted backup from scratch, the first backup took 160GB and for a few days following backups has worked fine (with a decent quantity of data for each run).\nNow after some days I started my MBP and the backup is still in progress, when it was started it says that it needs to backup about 40GB of data (which obviously is not true) and while running the limit is increasing constantly, currently is at 95GB and it continue to grow.\nI suspect that there could be some hardware issue with Time Capsule, but not sure.\nAny hint to solve this issue?\n\nA: Take a look at BackupLoupe:\nhttp://www.soma-zone.com/BackupLoupe/\nThe blurb on the website describes what it can do far more eloquently than I can, but to summarise it's commercial software that you can evaluate for free and then pay for if you with to use it. Once you have determined which backup intervals or which files are taking up more space than you wish, you can delete files across all backups or delete snapshots as needed to maintain storage space per your requirements and preference.\n", "Q: How to recover previously saved text file after an overwrite and a reboot? I was programming in python and I had two text editors open to the same file, and right before I shut down my computer I saved in the wrong one and overwrote the version I wanted to keep. How can I restore the old version? I'm using Mac OS X Snow Leopard\n\nA: There is little hope unless one or both of the editors squirrel away copies of the file for you or embed the undo buffer in the document.\nIt really depends on the editors and the settings.\nOne last ditch effort is to use the mdfind command. If that file had a memorable string or misspelling you could see in an instant if any files on the disk contain that string. If you search for a common string, you'll have a lot of false positives, but it's worth a shot.\nIn this case, even software that recovers deleted files won't be of use when another editor truncates the file. It was shredded and not simply deleted\n\nOn a personal note, We all learn this lesson about data loss in a personal way, usually many times over. \nIt's not overkill to have both version control and an automated backup system.\nTime Machine is marvelous in that it makes hourly snapshots so you lose at most an hours work. Files that have been around for [a day|a week] are saved for [a month|until the drive fills]. It really works well in practice, and if you have local backups, you might even have snapshots more often than one an hour to recover a file. Sorry to hear you lost work, it's never a good feeling.\n\nA: You could try this: http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk which is free undelete software, although it operates at the command line level.  If you are happy with Python I will assume you are familiar enough with the terminal.app.\nOther than that, Hope your backup caught the previous file, if you don't have a backup start making one, and/or consider switching to a text editor that provides for revisions/versions/backups etc.  Prevention is better than cure, and being proactive with backups is better than being reactive with undeletes.  Mistakes happen, I hop you can get your file back one way or another, and think about altering your workflow to try to prevent it happening again.\n\nA: You don't mention which editors you were using. My primary editor is BBEdit which has a preference to make backups of every file you save. On my system the files are saved to:\nDocuments/BBEdit Backups/[Date Folder]/[copies of your files]\n\nThis is set via the settings:\nBBEdit > Preferences > Text files \n\nOn a side note, I am so paranoid about backup that most of my projects are covered the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*weekly SuperDupper full system bootable backup\n\n*SVN or Git for the project\n\n*BBEdit's backup for all text files I touch\n\n*Home directory Daily offsite incremental backups to Amazon S3 via Arq\n\n*Home directory every 20 minute backups via Crashplan to system in my office and Crashplan's remote servers\n\n", "Q: Apple Detecting Jailbreak on a NOT jailbroken iPhone I recently received a notification that took up the whole screen on my iphone which says that I have breached the Apple terms and conditions for jailbreaking my iphone.\nHowever, I am pretty sure that I haven't done any jail breaking to it and it is a definitely a new piece of hardware since I bought it directly from the telco with the box and wraps.\nWhat could be the reason for this happening and what should I do? It has been working fine for a year or so, till this message pop up recently.\n\nA: That notification could have come from any app.  Check under your settings which apps you have got that you allow notifications from.  I am not aware of any official method for Apple to send these out, and unless there was some sort of corrective action or advice attached I can't see the point in you receiving it either.  This is almost impossible to provide a real answer to, but my first thoughts are either a prank or compromised notification through one of your existing apps.\nIf you receive it again, take a screen shot - hold down your home button, then tap the power button - the screen will flash white and the picture will appear in your camera roll.\n\nA: If it took the whole screen, then it can't be a push notification like stuffe suggests.\nBut it's something your network provider can do. I've seen it on my iPhone, too. It wasn't about jailbreaking, just some (very intrusive) ads. But it was fullscreen and I couldn't do anything before I clicked on it.\nIt's probably an error from your provider, so you may want to check with them.\n", "Q: find video codec from terminal I'm writing some shell scripts that automatically convert some video files.

Is there a good Documentation for creating templates within pages?\n\nA: Are you asking how to turn an existing document into a template, or are you needing advise on how to make the document?\nIf it's the former, you just need to save your document as a template using quite simply File > Save as template.\nIf it's the latter, then judging by the link you mentioned, I would start with a blank document in page layout format.  Select View > Show Layout and Show Rulers.  Start with your page margins, and set them to that shown in your example.  Then add text boxes that you can size and align against the rulers to make sure that they are in the correct places for the addresses etc.  For the section under the address that is 5 columns, you could use a table, using the cell properties to ensure the middle column is the desired width.\nI can't read German, so am unsure what a lot of the notes mean, but I hope this is a start for you.\n\nA: There are easily 10 articles showing you the mechanics of preparing a document to become a template, creating custom placeholders in a template and much more at Apple's support site.\nJust Search  pages custom template\n", "Q: Outlook 2011 - Mark email as read In my Windows Outlook client I can change from the default behavior of marking an email as read only after hitting the space bar or opening the message to automatically marking an email as read after x number of seconds (if it is selected).

While the server is doing it's work it adds to this file. When it finally writes 'successful' I want to be notified by a pop up window in the finder.\nNormally I would attack this using 'tail -f' and 'grep'. However, I have found that because this file is sitting on a server rather than a local file on my hard drive 'tail -f' doesn't seem to work properly... it behaves like 'tail', listing it's current last lines, but then just sits there and doesn't update info... it also doesn't exit. \nDoes anyone have any suggestions on how to monitor this remote file more effectively?\nIs there a way I could repeatedly read the tail output looking for 'successful' using applescript? (I'm pretty bad with applescript)\n\nA: I don't think a network filesystem is going to give you enough state information to do this quite as simply as you asked.  One solution would be this:\nOn the server side, run a script that looks for your 'successful' string as you described.  When it finds the string, have it write a new file into the shared directory.\nOn the remote side, run a script that checks for this new file, e.g.:\ntest -f newfilename && echo 'Success!' && rm newfilename\n\nOnce you've been notified, you can delete this new file and loop around for the next time.

It's limited by the FAT partition in the middle, which seems to be frozen, I can't move it down to make space for my main partition.\nTo get some background, I originally had those 2 partitions sharing the space in peace. Then, I created a 3rd partition to experiment with another OS. Once done I deleted that new partition, and boom. It became a no-man's land that neither partition can claim.\nI just want to have things back the way there were :(\n\nA: It appears you have space to image the entire DISK0S4 partition to a compressed img file that would be stored on Macintosh HD. \nFrom there you will be free to delete the partition, upsize Macintosh HD on the fly, and then make a new DISK0S4 FAT.\nTo start, just select the DISK0S4 and then go to the menu:\n\n\n*\n\n*New ▶ Disk Image from \"DISK0S4\"...\n\n\nYou'll want to mount and verify the image well before erasing anything. Also consider it will be at least twice as slow to move data from one part of the drive to another if you have a HDD with physical heads that have to move. Dumping that partition to an external drive is far faster - you can still use Disk Utility to compress the image to save space and time since the CPU can usually out compress any external disk at less that 25% usage - the bottleneck is the write speed of the drive.\n\nA: You have to actually delete the FAT partition at the bottom, you can't just drag it into oblivion. The instructions to do this are actually in the image that you uploaded.\n\nEdit:\nAfter reading your comment, it appears that I misunderstood the intent of your question. Disk Utility can't dynamically resize/move FAT partitions. You're going to have to back up that data, delete the partition, create the layout that you want, and then restore the data.\n\nA: When you deleted the 3rd part ion you didn't actually delete it, you merely removed the filesystem that was in it.  You need to change the partition mapping scheme to be a 2 partition layout, which should then allow you to increase the size of partition 2 so it can use it.  Then you have 2 partitions, and you can increase they size of the first, and decrease the size of the second at the same time, as it will now have enough space to \"move\" as it were.  This will take ages.\nEdit: Sorry, just realised that as above because it is FAT you cannot resize, it's a backup/remove/recreate/restore job for the bootcamp partition, sorry about that.\n\nA: I had accidentally removed my Windows 7 Bootcamp partition from Disk Utility (should have done so thru Bootcamp). It deleted the partition of ~80GB and made that \"Free Space\". I was restricted to change the size of my Macintosh HD to retake the ~80GB of free space and I searched all over the internet for a fix. There was nothing that helped my recover the \"Free Space\" partition.\nHowever, I found this solution myself which worked instantly:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences \n\n*Click on Security & Privacy\n\n*Choose FileVault\n\n*Decrypt your hard drive (this may take 1-4 hours, be patient)\n\n*Restart your computer\n\n*Go to Disk Utility and verify your both Macintosh HD and the partitions\n\n*Assuming they are in good condition, click on \"partition\" and you should be able to resize and recoup the free space.\n\n\nThis worked for me.\n\nA: Not sure this is applicable to your situation, but I somehow got mine resolved.\nStory: \nI tried to manually install Windows 8.1 with bootcamp and it failed to auto install, so I manually partitioned some free space with disk utility. After I tried to install windows again the setup created this evil \"disk0s4\" partition that is protected with no user privilege to modify or remove.\nFix:\nI attempted many resolutions suggested on the web but none of them worked, then I thought to myself, if this partition was created by the MS windows installation boot disk would that be the place to remove it? So I ran the Windows setup procedures again (inserting the disk/bootable usb, and hold option when boot, then select \"windows\" or \"windows setup\" or however you name your installation source). When I reached the part where I can select which partition to install, I then delete the \"disk0s4\" partition from there.

I am so dependant on it that I have postponed my Mac's OS upgrade to Lion.  What can i do to work around this issue?\n\nA: Unfortunately, no.  Quicken 2007 requires Rosetta which Apple has decided to leave behind in their OS.  MacWorld.com has a great article here with some great alternatives, but right now, you need to either give up Quicken 2007, or wait on Lion until you are ready to do so.\nDual booting is also possible, but it's not a convenient solution to just run banking software.\n\nA: No, Quicken will not run or work at all under Lion, since Quicken was designed as a PowerPC app, which relies on \"Rosetta\" emulation (built in to OSX, but no longer present in OSX Lion) to work.\nFor more info, go here.\nAt the moment, you should wait until Quicken is updated to Work under Lion, or if you can get by with \"Quicken Essentials\" (which does work under Lion), you could use this instead.\n\nA: fwiw, I moved to iBank, and love it. It handles transfers between accounts much better than Quicken ever did. It's really mac like, and helps me at tax time. There are a number of others as well, and many have great Quicken import capabilities.\nI've never looked back, and converted accounts from 1991 to iBank with ease.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: If you need the features of Quicken and want to move to Lion, your best alternative is to install a Windows virtual machine (Parallels, VMware, Virtual Box) and covert to Quicken for Windows.  That's a lot of complexity and at least a couple of hundred dollars to do so you need to be really sure that Quicken is worth it compared to the alternatives.\nThere's no indication that Rosetta will ever come back nor that Quicken will update Quicken for Mac so waiting for one of those to happen is just wasting time.\n\nA: Quicken did just announce that they plan to update Quicken 2007 to work with Lion. Sounds like there will be no new features, but they plan to ship in the 1st half of 2012.\n\nA: I solved this one temporarily by setting up an old Mac Mini as a monitor-less server with Snow Leopard and Quicken installed. It sits on a shelf out of the way. When I need to use Quicken, I use screen sharing to log in from my main computer. It is somewhat less awkward and a little quicker than rebooting from a separate partition. \nIt would be nice to have a real update, but there appears to be faint hope of that.\n", "Q: My iOS 5 Beta 1 Expired! Now what? I recently brought an iPod 4g. And one of my friend who was an iPhone application developer helped me upgrade my os to iOS 5 Beta 1. Now he is out of station and my iPod is locked. \nI cannot do anything with my iPod. \nPlease advice me on how to degrade the OS to my previous version? \nThanks & Regards,\n\nA: Well, this is timely.\nDownload the iOS 4.3.5 iPod touch firmware image, put your iPod touch in DFU mode, then use iTunes to restore to 4.3.5:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch iTunes.\n\n*Connect your iPod to your computer.\n\n*Shut it down by pressing and holding the power button for five seconds, then sliding to the right.\n\n*Press and hold the home and power buttons for ten seconds. Afterwards, release the power button, but continue to press the home button until iTunes detects the iPod.\n\n*If iTunes doesn't ask you for the file, ⌥-click the Restore button. This should let you select the .ipsw file you have downloaded.\n\n\nA: Not sure you can downgrade but try: Settings -> General -> Software Update ... there have been new Beta's so that might solve the problem.\n", "Q: What are the control keys available when working in a text field? I know that ctrl-e will move to me to the end of a line, and ctrl-a to the start.\nI also know that ctrl-n will move down a line.\nWhat other ctrl-key combinations are there?\nIs it possible to move up a line?\nHow about, most desirable for me, is there something to move back and forth a word at a time?\nI realize that I can do these things in emacs, or with an alternate set of keys in vi, but that's not what I am interested in.\nIf I am writing a question on one of the stackexchange sites or on a wiki, vi and emacs are not in play.\n\nA: The default key bindings are stored in /System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Resources/StandardKeyBinding.dict. You can use plutil to convert the file to an XML format, like so:\nplutil -convert xml1 -o StandardKeyBinding.xml  /System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Resources/StandardKeyBinding.dict\n\nOr, if you have Xcode or Property List Editor, you can open it there.\nIn addition, you can add your own bindings system-wide to /Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict, or per-user to ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict.\nThis page has a nice overview of bindings. I've grown particularly fond of Transpose (⌃-T), which swaps the two letters to the left and right of your cursor, fixing my most common kind of typo quickly.\nIn addition, there are various additional tricks using the ⌥ and ⌘ keys:\n\n\n*\n\n*⌘-← and → move to the beginning or end of the line. Add ⇧ to select everything in between.\n\n*⌘-↑ and ↓ move to the beginning or end of the document. Add ⇧ to select everything in between.\n\n*⌥-← and → move to the beginning or end of the word, or between multiple words. Add ⇧ to select everything in between.\n\n*⌥-↑ and ↓ move to the beginning or end of the paragraph. Add ⇧ to select everything in between.\n\n\nA: You can use alt/option and the cursor ← / → keys to move back and forth whole words at a time, taking you to either the beginning or end of the word depending on the direction you choose.\nUsing shift also allows you to highlight text as you pass over it.\nUsing the same combinations with ↑ / ↓ does the same within paragraphs.\n", "Q: I am only seeing 1:50 of estimated run time on a new MacBook Pro battery. Problems? I have bought brand new MacBook pro 15-inch model with highest specifications in this June. I have also installed newest Mac OS, Lion.\nHowever, how it could be strange, when cable is not plugged it, battery shows me that there is only max 1:50 of vitality (nevertheless, despite the fact that there is written in the official web page (http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/specs.html) that the battery work is \"up to 7 hrs wireless web\".\nI do not know what the problem is, is this OS problem or the issue with the battery.\n\nUpdate:\nOkay, after all your recommendations it shows me almost 4 hours on 98% of battery. Here is the screenshot (is it normal to have 4 hours with these processes running?):\n\n\nA: What are you doing when you are testing?  The \"up to 7 hours\" is for basic web surfing with little computation going on. If you're pushing the system hard, it's inevitable that estimated battery life will show as lower.\nEstimated battery life is essentially (battery level remaining / current power usage). As usage goes up, estimated life goes down.  That's standard for all laptops, by the way.  Of course, all manufacturers quote the highest life value, but then most laptops don't spend much of their time being pushed hard.\n\nA: First you should try to reset the SMC and then calibrate the battery.\nCalibrate the battery by charging it all the way and let it stay charged for 2 hours (you can use it as long as it's plugged in), then using it until you get a pop-up that says that your computer is running on reserve power. Disregard that and make sure that anything that you're working on is saved. Use the computer until it shuts itself off. Let it sleep that way for 5 hours, and then after those 5 hours plug it in and let it charge up all the way. \nTo reset the SMC:\n1)Shut down the computer.\n2)Plug in the MagSafe power adapter to a power source, connecting it to the Mac if its not already connected.\n3)On the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time.\n4)Release all the keys and the power button at the same time.\n5)Press the power button to turn on the computer.  \n", "Q: Will I see performance boost if I add memory with these Page-In/Page-Out statistics? Currently, if I open Photoshop after a days time, the load up time is about 5 seconds.  If I close and open again (right after), the load up time is about 2 seconds (I assume this is caching?).  Can someone explain how adding memory will (if at all) increase performance here (4GB to 16GB)?  \nBackground Info: My Page-Ins are about 2GB and my Page-Outs are about 60MB (iMac 12,2 4GB RAM).  \n\nA: The increase speed you see when starting Photoshop immediately after previously starting and stopping it is coming from the hard disk cache which cannot be increased, and adding more system memory will not make much difference unless your allocated memory is sufficiently high to require significant paging out to make room for the new app.  As any paging will have taken place on the first load, it's unlikely to require more paging on the 2nd attempt unless you re-access the data that has been paged out so that is get's paged back in, which you do not allow time for in this scenario.  Your page in/out figures need to be better detailed to allow for proper consideration - how long is this sampled over etc?\n\nA: If your system is stable enough to not need a reboot between launches, then you might have a drastic improvement by jumping that much RAM.\nIt's more about what else causes things to page out in the mean time than how photoshop behaves. In practice with Lion and Snow Leopard - it seems that the difference between 4 and 8 G of RAM makes a noticeable speedup after several days use have the programs you use resident in RAM. Going to 16 would be heaven to me. Even 5 seconds is pretty fast, so don't get it if you are going to be disappointed if it's 4 or 5 after the upgrade.\nOther things will sped up for sure, but it's hard to know if your workload will guarantee 2 seconds with any amount of RAM if the inactive pages that hold Photoshop eventually get released by the virtual memory system to make room for newer inactive pages.\n\nA: If you have 60MB of page-outs over any significant uptime, then your machine is not memory-constrained and you won't see a significant improvement by adding memory.  With next to no page-outs, your page-in represents programs loaded into memory when you run them.  You aren't going to make that happen any faster unless you buy an SSD.\nIf after day of running a normal workload you have lots of page-outs, then you might benefit from adding memory.  n.b., looking at free memory in Activity Monitor only shows a piece of the puzzle, as Unix will tend to keep things in memory once they are loaded.\n", "Q: Is it possible to master a DVD with 720HD high-definition video? Just bought DVD-Creator from the App store; big disappointment. Took an uncompressed 11 minute QuickTime 720HD 6.2GB file down to a 721MB VIDEO_TS when it burned the DVD. In other words, it chucked 88% of the info and looks lousy. Unacceptable. \nI'm running Snow Leopard, so Anamorphisizer is out. myDVDEdit 1.5(55) doesn't perform as advertised in changing from iDVD's 4:3 only-output into 16:9. \nSo how can I get high quality 720HD onto a DVD from Final Express 4.0.1 using OS 10.6.8? (Lion has a known incompatibility with my 2010 MBP with its NVIDIA GeFORCE GT 300M)\nwith advanced appreciation…\n(also, tags don't exist for DVD-Creator, Anamorphisizer, NVIDIA, & myDVDEDit; would someone please consider adding them. I'll probably be dead long before I get to 300 posts)!\n\nA: No, there is simply no way to encode HD resolution video onto a DVD. This is a common misconception. The DVD video format does not support HD resolution. DVD players cannot reproduce 720HD video.\nIf you want HD on a disk, that is what Blu-ray disks and Blu-ray console players are for.\nThere was once a format called HD-DVD, but it is no longer supported by anybody and standard DVD players will not play back an HD-DVD at the intended resolution.\n720HD is 1280 x 720 pixels per frame.\nThe highest resolution that the DVD format can support is 720 x 480 pixels per frame for NTSC (or 720 x 576 pixels per frame for PAL), which is at best only 37.5% of the resolution of 720HD.\n\nA: RE: \".. Just bought DVD-Creator from the App store; big disappointment. Took an uncompressed 11 minute QuickTime 720HD 6.2GB file down to a 721MB VIDEO_TS when it burned the DVD. In other words, it chucked 88% of the info and looks lousy. Unacceptable.\"\nYou can't get HD quality output to a DVD, but DVD can do much better quality output for an 11 minute clip than what you experienced.\nI would suggest that you try re-encoding again with DVD-Creator, and this time pay attention to the output quality settings, since it sounds like you set up the output quality limit to maximum of 1 CD (at 721 MB output).\nIf you change your settings to allow output of DVD 4.2 GB (single sided DVD), you will find a massive improvement in your burned DVD video quality.\nIf you are still having issues with the output quality, try using the free HandBrake video encoder instead.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: As I know the DVD disc can be created in HD quality if your dvd recorder supports that. \n", "Q: What application can record a cursor location and multi-touch input heatmap? Are there any applications out there that can record mouse interaction, and save a standard image1 that adequately conveys the exact situation that using the mouse created?\nDue to the proliferation of gestures in Lion, I would like to include an image conveying exactly what I do in bug reports. Take for example my question regarding Chrome's use of Two-finger forward/back gestures. I would love to attach an image that conveys my exact touch pad usage (and a standard mouse could be beneficial too in other cases) when filing a bug report regarding my gesture grievance.\n\n1 Where standard image file is something like an animated gif, or perhaps an annotated jpg/png with indicators of finger number, and stroke direction.\n\nA: I don't know of an app that displays gestures, but FingerMgmt displays the locations of your touches (and the size, dimension, etc.) in a window. You could record that to attach to your bug reports.\n", "Q: Can a Mac Pro be upgraded from a 5150 CPU to a 5365? Is it possible to upgrade a first-generation 2.66 Ghz 2-core Mac Pro (Woodcrest) to a faster model by replacing the CPUs? I've read that some Mac Pro models shipped with 3 Ghz 4-core Xeons (Clovertown).\n\nA: Yes, you can but only with Intel Xeon E53xx,  X53xx or L53xx series processors that have a LGA 771 socket. \nAlthough one word of warning,  the supported OS upgrade life time of the Mac Pro 1,1 and 2,1 looks like its coming to an end. Apple as we have seen in the news is prepping for Mountain Lion, and dropping support for all macs that lack a 64bit EFI. So it appears highly likely that Mac OS X 10.7 is the last OS you will be able to run on these Mac Pros, unfortunately. Be aware of that when prepping for your Mac Pro 1,1 and Mac Pro 2,1 upgrade plans, especially if keeping current is a priority of yours. \nThat said, now on to the upgrades:\nThe Mac Pro original Upgrade process\nHere are processor upgrades that people have completed and confirmed in Geekbench as working, see their results below. \nMacPros using L53xx Xeon processors.\nMacPros using E53xx Xeon processors.\nMacPros using X53xx Xeon processors.\n\nA: Yep. Anand even did it when the Mac Pro first came out. I've seen other reports too. \n\nA: Found out that a company does processor upgrades, but for some Mac pro models only. Perhaps yours is eligible:\nhttp://eshop.macsales.com/shop/turnkey/MacPro/2010_Xeon_Processor\nAnd also this forum about upgrading a first gen Mac pro:\nhttp://forums.macnn.com/65/mac-desktops/452598/macpro1-1-processor-upgrades-1st-generation/#post4130757\n\nA: I've just done this upgrade to a used Mac Pro 1,1. I bought two X5465 CPU on eBay from China (production Costa Rica) and they installed fine with heat around 40 degrees at idle and 50 degrees under full benchmark testing with Open CL Sala room test (CPU). I did use very good heat paste though after thoroughly cleaning the processors.\nI want to run Snow Leopard so I'm not bothered about the 64 bit EFI. But if I was, the computer when I bought it was running Yosemite using Piker's bootloader (just puts in some translation files in boot.efi which thunk the 64 bit calls onto the 32 bit firmware). No problem running even high end graphics like Borderlands 2 on Steam on a Nvidia GTX 580. If you plan to game, though, I don't recommend the Mac Pro 1,1 as it has only a PCI Express 1 (maximum bandwidth 2.5 GB/sec) which hobbles high end cards (higher than Radeon 5770 or GTX 285).\nI'm not going to follow my own advice and I'm dropping in a Radeon 5870 as there is an improvement especially for FCPX and apparently the 5870 is quieter. Price difference these days is more like $50 and not $200 between the 5770 and 5870.\nEven the Nvidia 7300 GT runs fine and absolutely silent. It does choke a bit when trying full screen video playback with both 30 inch and 24 inch monitors attached.\nAs work computers (as opposed to Da Vinci Resolve 12 colour correction suites or high end gaming rigs), the Mac Pro 1,1 is an amazing silent and powerful performer. I suspect these elegant silver towers will still be in service when people tire of black trash cans without slots for cards or drives.\n", "Q: Importing vCards from a website into iOS’s Contacts.app I have a web page with tables full of people & their contact information. I started writing a pairing of php & javascript to automagically generate vCards (*.vcf) for each contact. Half way through this process I’ve discovered that iOS is none too cooperative with .vcf downloaded by Mobile Safari.\nWhen a .vcf files is received via MMS or as an email attachment, iOS provides a very obvious & simple interface for adding it as a new contact. I expected Mobile Safari to exhibit similar behavior to Messages & Mail, but that is not the case.\nWith Dropbox installed, on my iPhone or iPad, things look like:\nMobile Safari “handles” a .vcf file http://mlkshk.com/r/66OX\nWithout Dropbox installed, Mobile Safari just throws up its hands and says it cannot download the file.\nAnyone have a way forward on this one? Is there a way to coerce Mobile Safari into doing something meaningful with the .vcf file? Will this be supported in iOS 5? Wy on earth is it not supported now? Is there another way to markup the contact information so that Mobile Safari will allow for seamless creation of a new entry in Contacts? Microformats, serving the .vcf up with a MIME of text/plain, some markup & JavaScript bookmarklet (clumsy and awkward as they may be), etc. ?\nN.B.\n\n\n*\n\n*I want to know if this can be done on iOS using Mobile Safari. I’m\nnot looking for work arounds that involve syncing with a desktop\nmachine, using Dropbox, or some other 3rd party app.\n\n*Yes, I\nunderstand that sending a user the .vcf file as an attachment via\nemail is an option (a terrible, time consuming, non-elegant option\nwhich requires the user to enter their email address without typos\nor otherwise bolloxing things up).\n\n*I also understand that <a\nhref=\"tel:+1 617.555.1234\">phone</a> can create a new contact with\na tap & hold (this too is a terrible, time consuming, non-elegant\noption which requires the user to remember & then enter the\nperson’s name without typos, otherwise bolloxing things up, and then\nforces them to tap, hold repeat, for each piece of info [phone,\nemail, address, home phone, home email, website, …])\n\n\nA: I expect you found my solution on Stack Overflow but if not you can see the source code and full description at http://www.mobicontact.info or on Stack Overflow\nBTW - it involves wrapping the VCARD (.vcf) file inside a Calendar appointment (.ics) which IS handled by mobile Safari.

Then click “More” and choose “Import” in its pull-down list.\n\n*Then in the pop-up “Import Contacts” window, click “Choose File” to find the contacts backup on your computer (choose the contacts backup in .csv or .vcf format), then click “Import” to start to import VCF/vCard file to Gmail Contacts.\n\n*Launch iTunes on your computer and connect your iPhone to the PC using a USB data cable.\n\n*Tap on your iPhone under “Devices” entry on the left sidebar of iTunes to show the Summary page.\n\n*Click on “Info” tab on the right interface, and click on “Sync Contacts with” checkbox, select “Google Contacts” from the drop-down menu and click “Apply” or “Sync” button on the bottom-right corner.\nMethod 4 Import CSV/VCF to Windows contacts and sync Windows contacts to iPhone\n\n\n*\n\n*Press “Windows + R” keys on the keyboard to open “Run” window and type “wab” in “Open” filed and hit OK.\n\n*Click on “Import” button to open the “Import Windows Contacts” window, and choose the CSV file or vCard you want to import to iPhone, and click “Import”.\n\n*Select contacts to import by browsing your computer, and click “Next” to define the domains for your contacts, and click “Finish”.\n\n*Run iTunes on your computer, then connect your iPhone to the computer using a USB data cable.\n\n*On the left sidebar of iTunes, you’ll find out your iPhone under “Devices” entry, click your device to show the Summary interface.\n\n*Click on “Info” tab on the right interface, and click on “Sync Contacts with” checkbox, select “Windows Contacts” from the drop-down menu and click “Apply” or “Sync” button on the right corner.\nMethod 5 Import VCF (vCard) contacts to iCloud directly\n\n\n*\n\n*In order to import VCF to iPhone 5/4S/4/3GS via iCloud, firstly, you should make sure the “Contacts” option of the iCloud on your iPhone is turned on by checking Settings > iCloud > turn “Contacts” on.\n\n*Go to www.icloud.com on  your computer, and log into your iCloud account with your Apple ID and password.\n\n*Click “Setting” button on the left corner and choose “Import vCard”.\n\n*Then choose the vCard (.vcf file) from your computer, and click “Open”, then the vCard contacts will be added to your iCloud Contacts automatically. Then you just succeed to import vCard to iPhone, so go to your iPhone Address Book to check the contacts.\nNote: You can edit the contacts information, add new contacts to the iCloud, or delete the repeated contacts by left-clicking the contact and tapping on “Delete” from the “Setting” button, all the changes of contacts will be reflected on your iPhone contacts too.\n\nA: Mobile Safari does not handle downloaded files (including vcf) for security reasons.\nSending the vcf as a message attachment is the only current solution for transmitting  vCards or adding contacts via Mobile Safari.\nAn option you might consider is presenting visitors to the page the option to select (multiple) contacts that they wish to download, then generating a singly vCard with multiple contact data — so that the user wouldn't have to re-enter their email address each time (at least that makes it somewhat less laborious).\nSomewhat more complex to set up, but perhaps simpler experience for the user, might be for you to set up SMS messaging via a gateway such as Amazon Web Services and give the user the option to enter their phone number to receive the vCard as an SMS.\nLastly, you may consider building a native first party app to provide your users with a list of available contacts and the ability to add them to their own Contacts.\n\nA: Of course I forgot the other obvious answer, which is to set up something like a Google Apps account that stores all of the contacts, and then invite your users to configure their devices to use it. This way, contacts are stored and managed in a central location and can be updated.\n(Since you are asking about sharing contact information, I assume this is a closed group that you are sharing data amongst, such as a business or school).\n", "Q: How can I kill a non-responding app?

Let's say I am finished typing my string literal, and now my cursor in the position right before the ending quotation. I still need to write other things after the ending quotation. For example, I may be writing a parameter for a function, and the function has a few more parameters. I know CMD + ENTER goes to the next line, and I know CMD + SHIFT + ENTER ends the current line with a semi-colon and then moves the cursor to the next line. Is there a similar natured hotkey that moves the cursor to the position after the ending quotation? I understand that I can just press ' and then SPACE, and that I can use the arrow keys, but I want to know if there is a hotkey with similar a similar nature. Also, for future reference, I feel like I can never find all these hotkeys that I maybe look for. Where am I supposed to look?\n\nA: Currently using:\nTextMate version 2.0-alpha.9547\nWas trying to define it myself when I found out it is already defined as:\nCtrl + f\n\nA: You didn't give any examples, but if this is your use case:\nsomefunction(\"onestring\", \"otherstring\")\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^abc^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThen you're asking for a hotkey to move your cursor from position ab to bc, which can be accomplished by hitting → (right arrow key) once. Any hotkey combination would result in more key-presses than this and therefore not be beneficial (unless you want to avoid moving your hand off the home position, in which case you may want to look at ViMate).\nFor finding hotkeys the Textmate bundle contains a function called Show Keyboard Shortcuts, which lets you do exactly that. Hit ^⌥⌘K to quickly access it.\n", "Q: Using TextMate, how can I wrap everything in PHP tags? A question about TextMate. For example, I just typed var_dump($codes);, and I forgot to write <?php ?>. So, now I want to highlight the area that I want to wrap the php tags around. How can I do this?\n\nA: Simply add a new command called for ex 'Wrap in ' in your php bundle editor (Bundles->Bundle Editors->Show Bundle Editor) \nIn the Activation choose: Key Equivalent and hit: CMD+SHIFT+W (or whatever you'd like that's not already taken).\nLeave the scope selector to source.php\nIn the snippet window write:\n<?php  $TM_SELECTED_TEXT ?>\n\nNow select anything and hit CMD+SHIFT+W and you're done\nSorry I couldn't upload an image to show you I've just signed up.\nEDIT I now have enough reputation to upload the image:\n\n\nA: You could select the line your PHP command is on and do a Search and Replace operation with a regular expression. Search for\n^(.*)$\n\nand replace it with\n<?php $1 ?>\n\nas seen in the screen shot. The regular expression will match everything on the line and wrap the PHP tag around it.\n\n\nA: The HTML bundle has a command to wrap in <?= ?>:\n\nYou could assign a keyboard shortcut to this from the Bundle Editor, and if you're so inclined you could even add a new command for <?php ?>.\n", "Q: iMac Lion not logging in \nPossible Duplicate:\niMac not logging probably due to keychains problem \n\niMac OS X Lion here.\nI have two accounts in the iMac.

As soon as you heard the start-up chime, hold down the Option key. Images of more than one boot volume will show up. Use the arrow keys to select Recovery HD. When bootup in Recovery HD completes, you can find the Reset Password utility in the menu commands. Sorry, I don't have a screen shot.\n\nA: Okay. I DID IT. It was the most horrible IT experience in my life. This kind of problem is rather unusual, but it is annoying as hell, so let me post the answer to help people who might get into this unusual situation.\n\nProblem: On Mac OS X Lion, I deleted my keychains, including the login one, and exported some (including login) from a different mac (for whatever weird reason). Now, it is impossible to log in into the account in question even though you know the password: the screen goes blank and keeps throwing you to the login screen.\n\nSolution: Essentially, we have to delete the keychains located in the account in question. Now, it is commonly said that in order to edit keychains, you have to do it through the Keychain Access utility in the account in question. But that's impossible since you can't even login.\nWell, we will need another account with admin privilegies. There are lots of ways to create one even though you can't access your only account. Just google it, it is everywhere.\nSo, we got our second account with admin privilegies. In theory, you can access the original account's Library folder and then the Keychains folder and delete all files within. Such folders are protected and we need permission to access them. Fortunately, we are admin. Basically, we can right click the folders, Get Info, and give ourselves permission.\nBut we can't do that, either. In Lion, the Library folders, including the ones in other Users, are hidden. We can't right click something we can't see. So we will need to use the Terminal. Open it and run:\nsudo cd Users/Alex/Library\n\nWhere Alex is your original account. Now the Finder pops up with, miraculously, the Library folder selected, and of course, visible. Right click and give yourself permission to Read & Write. Enter the folder. Now look for the Keychains folder. Do the same (right click and get permission for it). Now, inside the Keychains folder, delete the files in it. I think it is enough to just delete the login.keychain file.. or just move it away.\n\nTHE QUICK SOLUTION (in case you don't want to read bunch of things)\nGoogle a way to create another admin account. It is easy.\nEnter the account, open Terminal, and run:\nsudo rm Users/Alex/Library/Keychains/login\n\nWhere Alex is your original account's name. Enter password when Terminal asks. Now things should be working.\n\nCongratulations. You should now be able to log in to your original account. Chances are that the keychain will need you to re-enter passwords you used before etc... but that's simple enough.\n\nA: I accidentally deleted a keychain on a works MAC we use for video editing while trying to sort the NAS out, whenever I tried the terminal commands above, it came up 'folder not found'.  I then found this little tool - http://www.bresink.com/osx/TinkerTool.html\nI installed as an admin, once installed, go to the 'Finder' option on the extreme left, click 'show hidden & system files', click 'relaunch finder' bottom right, \nthen my other user showed up in the dock, went into the hidden Library files, keychains and as above, deleted the Keychain file and could log in again.\nI'm not a MAC tekkie so there may be a better way of explaining it but it got me back in after several hours of panicking.\n", "Q: Login screen freezes after the Lion 10.7.1 update After updating to 10.7.1 (the first Lion update) & restarting the system, it's not logging me in. As I give my password and press return it stays on the same login screen. I could move the mouse but there is no rotating wheel, just the same login screen. I tried starting Mac in safe mode but same thing.\nResolution\nIt was because of Login Hook script which was stopping the login action. Booted in Single User mode and moved the script away from the expected location. Thanks to bmike for the tips.\n\nA: If you have another mac at home, I recommend using the OS X Recovery Disk Assistant to clone the recovery partition. Then just insert the USB into the non-functional Mac and boot from the USB, as this will allow reinstallation of the OS.\nTip: only use these steps if the built-in recovery partition is not accessible. After taking these steps I would strongly recommend that you upgrade your OS (preferably to Mavericks) if you don't want this to happen again.\n\nA: I'd rather @kaychaks answer this since they took my hint and ran with it to find the culprit, but we have a question that isn't really answered - so here is the answer from the comments above...\nYou should be able to get further if you make a new admin user and log in to check if this is an account problem or a system problem.\nHow can I fix permission issue when I cannot start Mac OS X?\nAlso, if you boot in single user mode you might be able to sniff around or just delete un-needed items to address the issue.\n", "Q: Learn OS X hacks/tweaks and resources I bought a MBP a month ago and as a developer and a first time Mac user I want to get my hands dirty with the OS, I found a lot of tweaks and hacks for example:\n$ defaults write com.apple.dock no-glass -boolean YES; killall Dock\n\nInstead of just coping commands I want to learn and understand these commands, any recommended resources - books, sites, etc.  Running OS X Lion.\nThanks,\nT\n\nA: There is a book called \"Mac OS X Internals: A Systems Approach\" by Amit Singh.

Let's say I have two lists in AppleScript:\nset listA to {\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"}\nset listB to {\"green\", \"blue\"}\n\nI'd like to create a third list that has only the items present in both lists:\nset listC to intersection of listA and listB --something like this\n-- would return {\"green\", \"blue\"}\n\nBasically, something like PHP's array_intersect().\nIs there a built-in way to do this?\nIf not, I'd love a recommendation for a scripting addition that solves this problem.\n\nA: The List & Record Tools Scripting Addition provides intersection of listA and listB (among other bits of terminology).\nThere is no built-in “primitive” for computing a list intersection. Usually one would just use one or more loops to check each element of one list against the other. This can be simplied (and sped up1) a bit by using one of the is in/is contained by/contains operators (or a negation thereof):\nset listA to {\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"}\nset listB to {\"green\", \"blue\"}\n\nto intersection of listA against listB\n    local newList, a\n    set newList to {}\n    repeat with a in listA\n        set a to contents of a -- dereference implicit loop reference\n        if {a} is in listB then set end of newList to a\n    end repeat\n    newList\nend intersection\n\nintersection of listA against listB --> {\"green\", \"blue\"}\n\n1The is in operator and its relatives are implemented by the AppleScript runtime environment in lower-level code where they execute much faster than the normal interpreted AppleScript code.\n\nIncidentally, handlers that use labeled parameters have a limited set of terms that can be used for the labels. For example, intersection of listA and listB is not possible as a user-defined handler because and is not a recognized label. See the AppleScript Language Guide section on handlers with labeled parameters for a list of valid labels. Applications and OSA extensions can defined their own terminologies (e.g. the List & Record OSAX provides this exact syntax), but user-defined handlers are not as flexible. I usually just use positional parameters (handlerName(param1, param2, …)) instead of trying to make invocations of my handlers look like prose.\n", "Q: What is the monitor-like icon on Remote App screen?

I plugged it into my iMac and the hard drive never showed up in Finder. The drive does not appear in Disk Utility and the command diskutil list outputs only my system HD /dev/disk0. Even when I go to the System Profiler the drive does not appear under USB.\nHowever, when I plug the device into a MacBook the drive shows up and runs regularly. I have made sure that the USB drive that I am plugging the hard drive into is working. I even formatted the drive using the Disk Utility on the MacBook put the drive still doesn't work on the iMac.\nI think it might be a mounting issue but don't know where to go from here. How to make my iMac recognize my USB external hard drive?\n\nA: If your USB hard drive is the bus-powered variety (that is, you don't plug it into the wall for power), then it is possible that it is requiring too much startup current to run on one of your computers.\nSome computers are pickier than others about how much current a device can draw, and over what period.\nYou might try a cable like this:\n\nBasically, you can use power from two USB ports, instead of just one.\nIf your hard drive has a jack for a power adapter, use that instead.\n\nA: If your drive does not show up in Disk Utility then it should not be the 'mounting' issue but more likely some in lower level. You need to plug some other USB device to test if your USB ports actually work or not.\n\nA: I hate to post a solution like this but I replaced the drive with a new one from the store and it works. It was a hardware problem with the drive.\n\nA: I have the same problem and I am using a Western Digital 1TB Passport. Every few days the time machine stops working and is not accessible.

This can be changed in the trackpad preferences by un-checking Scroll Direction: natural. I get that part. My problem is that un-checking or checking this box in the trackpad settings also causes the box in the mouse settings page labeled Move content in the direction of finger movement when scrolling or navigating to be checked or un-checked - effectively tying the mouse scroll wheel behavior to the trackpad scroll behavior. Is this a bug?\nI want to be able to scroll with the trackpad in the default Lion way while still being able to scroll with a mouse wheel in a conventional way. Is there a workaround to the above issue to be able to do this?\n\nA: Yes there's just one setting for all input devices.. It's a pity because the natural scrolling doesn't work as well with regular scroll-wheel mice. It works great with an Apple Magic mouse, in my experience. Hopefully someone will find a hack for this.\n\nA: There is a workaround, and it is called Scroll Reverser.

There are many movies on iTunes that only have HD versions if you are shopping from an iPad or Apple TV. However, I use a Mac Mini for my media center rather than an Apple TV. Is there any way to buy HD versions of these movies directly on a Mac?\n\nA: Source: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3209\n\nIn order to purchase, rent, and view HD content from the iTunes Store\n  on your computer, you need to have the latest version of iTunes\n  installed, you can download the latest version here. In addition, you\n  will need to have components that support HDCP (High-bandwidth Digital\n  Content Protection) installed on your computer. \nMac System Requirements for HD content:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Mac OS X v10.5 or later iTunes 10 or later\n  \n*2.0 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo or faster processor\n  \n*At least 1 GB of RAM \n  A display that supports HDCP with a screen resolution of 1024x768 or\n  higher.\n  \n  \n  If your computer does not meet all of the above requirements, you will be unable to \n  purchase, rent, or view HD content from the iTunes Store. \nNote: If you are trying to view HD video on an external display, the\n  display must have a digital connection (DVI, DisplayPort, or HDMI) and\n  also support HDCP.\n\nIf it isn't obvious where to buy the movies, I would guess that your system requirements are not there.\n", "Q: Will backing up using time-machine also backup all the users? I have two users on my MBP, and IIRC, both are Admin accounts. I want to upgrade to Lion GM, and have the dmg to do that. However, to be safe, I want to have a backup. I am not familiar with Time-machine, being new to this ecosystem and all. \nWill running a backup from an Admin account backup all the user accoiunts on the machine? Is it a 1:1 backup?\n\nA: In essense, it's not a true one to one backup, but it's like 99.9% there.  It will backup all your files, users, user documents, settings, applications etc, but not quite every file.  Pagefiles, certain cache files, logs areas etc can be ommitted as they are recreatable and as such don't need to be recoverable.  I don't believe you need to be an admin user to do a backup, as the backup daemon is always running as a priveleged process anyway and you just pass it the message to go and do it's stuff, therefore you do not need access to all the files under your own accounts permissions.\n\nA: Time Machine backs up an entire drive/partition/volume unless you specifically remove files and folders under \"Options\".  All User accounts are included unless you uncheck them in Options.\nAll of this info is available in your Finder Help menu.\n", "Q: What is the real native maximum resolution of mid–2010 iMac's iSight camera? I had understood that the pre-2011 Macs & Apple displays have a built–in iSight camera which sensor is capable of VGA (640 x 480) resolution—unlike the FaceTime HD cameras, which replaced the built–in iSights, that are capable of SXGA (1280 x 1024) resolution.\nI had also thought that, when importing feed from the camera to an iMovie-project, 640 x 480 is the native maximum of the camera and the other, WSVGA (1024 x 576), option is upscaled and cropped version of the 640 x 480 feed.\nMoreover, when I open Photo Booth app, I'm stuck with one resolution which is for video 720 x 480 (DVD (NTSC)) and for pictures 1280 x 853.\nThere is still one more native way to record iSight video: QuickTime Player—with which the resolutios are as interesting as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Normal: 640 x 480 (VGA)\n\n*High: 960 x 720\n\n*Maximum: 1280 x 1024 (SXGA)\n\n\nThis made me suspicious: it says maximum but the resolution is over 4 times what I had thought the max was.\nNow: what is the real native maximum resolution that the (mid–2010 27\" iMac's) built–in iSight camera is capable of? What is real and what is upscaled?*\nIf there are no definite & reliable specifications available, is there a way to confirm it by myself? Judging by  the lack of moiré pattern and other overall fidelity of the SXGA video recorded by QuickTime Player, it seems to me that it is not an upscale of the VGA feed.\nWikipedia's entry concentrates on the external iSight camera, and while it has a chapter on the built–in version, but, as of today and like the product entries in Wikipedia, it doesn't refer to any working sources.\n*) Upscaled and cropped in case of non–4:3 resolutions—the CMOS sensors have almost definitely an aspect ratio of 4:3. \n\nA: I think it's 1280x1024, as that's what the LED backlit MacBook Pro's and onwards used. The Lion version of Photo Booth uses the max resolution and crops it. \n720x480 is actually a standard resolution - it's what most DVD's use.\n\nA: Some discussion sources report that using QuickTime video capture at the stated maximum quality. That would hint my built-in iSight's resolution is in fact 1280×1024.\nMoreover, the iSight upgrade (from 0.3 to 1.3 megapixels) has been noted first at Mac Daddy World and later re-reported at TUAW and Engadget:\n\n*\n\n*The product ID for the 0.3 MP iSight is 0x8501 and its vendor is Micron…\n\n*…while the 1.3 MP iSight's product ID is 0x8502 and the vendor is Apple.\n\nLooking at my System information report, I can confirm the product ID is 0x8502.\nSo, summa summarum: mid–2010 iMac's built-in iSight camera has a native resolution of 1280×1024 pixels.\n", "Q: Ipad/ Iphone/ mac email I configured gmail account on my IPad , Iphone and Mac.

Is there a way I can stop programs from opening? I want to block Stacraft 2. I've tried blocking the servers using SelfControl but it didn't seem to help.\nEdit: I want to disallow access to Stacraft II Battle.net. Not being able to open for a period of time and, not being able to reverse this action for that period of time. The goal is to stop the addiction of playing.\n\nA: Precommit.\nPrecommitment is a powerful strategy to control impulsivity. The point is to take a future choice away from yourself: an alcoholic will avoid bars, a drug addict will not carry cash, a person on a diet doesn't go to the grocery store hungry.\nIf you're addicted to StarCraft, then get rid of the game. Throw it away. Just like an alcoholic would pour his alcohol down the drain.\nYou can try technological solutions like using parental controls, but if you managed to get around an application like SelfControl. Why will anything else work? There is always a way.\nFor instance with parental controls, when you try to open StarCraft under a parental controlled account, Mac OS X simply asks you for an administrator password, all you need to do there is slip once.\nHabits, good or bad, are like well-blazed trails through the jungle of your mind. When you try and blaze a new trail, certain parts of your brain rebel. They look behind you and say, \"why not just take the old path, its a helluva a lot easier.\" And then, you simply fall back into your old ways. It doesn't matter to that part of you brain that the trail leads to ruin. All it wants is short-term gratification. To change these habits and fight against short-term thinking, you have to exercise willpower.\nBut willpower alone is rarely enough. People perceive willpower as some infinite resource, only waiting to be tapped, by those who can just bare down and reap their untapped inner potential; but that is just a load of horseshit. Willpower is not infinite but a finite measurable psychological quantity. \nThis is why precommitment is so important. Precommitment takes away choices, so you don't have to exercise willpower to avoid them.\nI know you asked for technological solution, and I know I didn't give you one, but I hope I answered your question anyways.\n\nA: you could try using Parental controls. \n\n\nA: If you use Script Timer, you can set an applescript to run when you launch a certain application. It is $12, but it is useful for many, many other things. If you write an AppleScript like this  \ntell application \"StarCraft\" //Change this to the exact name of the application  \nquit  \nend tell\n\nYou could also cut that down to:  \ntell application \"StarCraft\" to quit\n\nJust be sure to replace the application name with the right name.\n\nA: Thanks, clearer now.  I can't think of a way off hand, hence this is not an answer (but it will be too long for a comment, so just please don't vote it up or down), but I would just like to point out that anything you can do to stop allowing yourself access, you will also be able to undo.\nPerhaps a technological answer won't help, and you just need to work on your self control, which I know sounds twee but bear with me.  I used to have a problem accessing the internet too much at work, but I needed access occassionaly for work.  I removed all icons, start menu, task bar, desktop etc in order to make it more of a hassle to get a browser open.  Because there was always a way around it, it failed, and I used it just as much but wasted more time due to the lengths I had to go to to start the browser, and eventually I settled on simply doing Start > Run > Opera which eventually defeated the object. (Yes, it was Windows at work).\nIf you are worried about spending too much time playing the game, then try to put mental barriers in place rather than looking for a tool to do it for you.  If nothing else, removing the game from your system, putting it under a different user IDs local applications folder (maybe using the parental controls to prevent internet access at certain times or placing it on an external USB disk and leaving it in another room might help, but they key is to work on yourself.\nSorry I can't be of more help.  Actually, reading back I think that putting the application into a new user, and limiting access to the internet via parental controls is probably a suitable genuine answer, but as per what I started with, you will know how to get round it and if your willpower isn't up to it, you will get around it somehow.  The only way I can think to stop you reverting this is to ensure that you do not either run as, or have access to, an administrator account.  Maybe you can try this, and see if there is someone who you trust with your admin password to restrict your access in this way for a short while to see if it helps you.\n", "Q: How to initiate VPN conection from command line? I would like to save some mouse clicks and keystrokes by initiating VPN connection from command line. Is there tool for this in Mac OS X? Ideally, it should accept VPN connection name and password and start VPN connection.\nUpdate: I'm talking about builtin VPN client for Cisco IPSec VPN.\n\nA: Your best bet seems to be AppleScript:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n   tell current location of network preferences\n       set VPNservice to service \"VPN (L2TP) 2\" -- name of the VPN service\n       if exists VPNservice then connect VPNservice\n   end tell\nend tell\n\n(from http://macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?id=22992)\nAs for entering a username and password, I'm not sure how you could do that. Further scripting could get you the frontmost window and input the username and password, then submit the dialog, but as I don't have a Cisco VPN to test I couldn't tell you how to set that up.\nIf you have the actual Cisco VPN client installed (which afaik is not necessary), you could just use this command:\nopen /Applications/VPNClient.app --args -c -user <YourUsername> -pwd <YourPassword> <ProfileNameToConnect>\n\n", "Q: How to check what's locking a file? I noticed that sometimes Mail.app locks files. The lock itself allows for files to be moved to Trash, but doesn't allow Trash to be emptied. (Perhaps Trash should be renamed Thrash in this case)\nIs there a way (via a terminal command or an app) to see which app locks the file and/or unlock the file without quitting the app?\n\nA: As others pointed out, lsof does the trick. To make the task even simpler, I suggest the (free) app \"What's keeping me\" (URL: http://www.hamsoftengineering.com/products/wkm/wkm.html) which is basically a frontend for lsof and has a few time-saving options.\n\nA: Apparently the lsof (\"list of open files\") terminal command can be used to do that:\nhttp://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20040121001144687\n\nA: As Rabarberski says, lsof can be used to find any process that has the file open. Note that you need to run the program as root, i.e., using sudo, and that you can give the pathname to the file you're interested in as an argument, so there is no need for the grep invocation in the hint that Rabarberski points to. Also, if a process holds a lock on the file, you're supposed to be able to see that from the FD column in the lsof output. See the manual page for the details. (When I run sudo lsof on my machine, I see no locked files, so I won't guarantee that this works right on the Mac. sudo is after all a generic unix program, and conceivably some features don't work on OSX.)\nYou cannot unlock a file without killing the process that holds the lock. But you can remove it with rm from the command line.\n", "Q: Do I have to replace both Airport base station and modem? I have an Airport base station and Network DG814 Modem Gateway both bought in 2002 and use over the years for wireless access at home to a family's worth macs and one work windows laptop.  Demon is our provider. \nAlthough everything is working we are resetting the modem a few times a week and speeds seem a little slow. I expect the modem needs a replacement. I looked at Airport Express and Airport Extreme options, but they need the modem too. We don't need multiple networks or back up, or anything fancy. \nIs there a reliable solution ?\n\nA: As you mention Demon I am going to assume you are in the UK and therefore more likely looking at an ADSL connection, not Cable or other types etc.\nAlmost any ADSL Modem Router from Belkin/DLINK/Netgear etc will do the trick nicely, they should all be compatible with your Mac.\nHowever, there are a few scenarios where continuing to use a (new) Airport Extreme could be of benefit depending on your usage and requirements.  First, the new Airports (to be fair, I believe others are starting to offer this also) will allow you to run up to 3 seperate wireless networks from a single device.  This may seem overkill, but for my set it's quite useful:\n1) I run a Wireless N network operating at 5Ghz for all the stuff in the house that supports it, iMac, Macbook, iPad and Apple TV (I think) - this is faster and suffers less interference than...\n2) A Wireless G network operating at 2.4Ghz for everything else that doesn't understand Wireless N and/or 5Ghz (PLaystation, Wii, Phones, PSP, work laptop, etc etc)\n3) A \"guest\" network that has no WEp/WPA security, but is ringfenced from the other 2 to allow things my my sons Nintendo DS to connect easily (as it only supports WEP, which is next to useless) as well as let freinds use it when they visit.\nTo make the actual internet connection you can get a standalone ADSL modem, but they are quite rare, you would likely have to order online to get one, they won't stock them in PC World etc.  I actually use a full Dlink ADSL Modem Router which I turn off the wireless, and put into \"bridge mode\" to allow the Airport to control the connection.\nHaving the external \"point of access\" to be the Airport instead of a different Modem Router allows things like Back to My Mac to work far more easily without having to play around with port forwarding etc, which is another reason why I do it, also if your internet connection goes down for any reason and you need to reboot it etc, then it does not affect any of your local LAN traffic, i.e. Apple TV streaming, iTunes Homeshare, etc.\n", "Q: Can you virtualize PowerPC versions of Mac OS X on Intel Macs? Ignoring licensing/legal issues, is there any virtualisation software that will virtualise an older, PowerPC-only version of Mac OS X (e.g. Panther 10.3.9) on an Intel Mac?\nIf I understand correctly (and I very possibly don’t), such software would have to emulate a PowerPC processor, so it doesn’t seem likely.\nAre there emulators or virtualization that can run apps or even enough of the OS to be useful to run PowerPC apps?\n\nA: The PowerPC and Intel Macs are totally different architectures, so you are correct, you could only really emulate a PowerPC install on an intel machine, versus virtualize Windows/Mac OS/Linux on a intel machine. \nThere are some PowerPC emulators, but the one I know of for OS X would be PearPC. I have used PearPC a very long time ago, and don't know how well these work on newer machines. \nUp until Lion however, at least PowerPC software was emulated using Rosetta. This was dropped in Lion though. \nIf you really do need a PowerPC machine, for dedicated work, I would personally buy a used older machine from ebay, which would be rather inexpensive depending on what kind of power you need.\nNote: Removed iEmulator because its made more for emulating windows or linux on a intel OR PPC mac.\n\nA: Sheepshaver is another emulator for PPC chips. The default big-endian behavior and run-time switching make a true emulator both slow and tricky to implement.\n\nA: The QEMU emulator and virtualization tool is flexible enough for this task. \nI and others have experience getting MacOS 9.2.2, OS X 10.0 - 10.4.11 working using QEMU.  You have to be careful however as different versions of QEMU may or may not work.  As an example, I have found that 9.2.2 will NOT install using QEMU 4.1.0 whereas it seems to do fine using 2.5.~.  Anyway, I have found this to be the greatest emulation platform because it also provides for large screen resolutions (I have all of my platforms running at 1920x1440X32).\n\nA: PearPC is a powerpc emulator that can emulate the powerpc versions of Mac OS X, however, it only runs on windows. You can run PearPC on OS X by downloading Wineskin.\nThe full tutorial is here: http://www.emaculation.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=8306\nAlso, if you are interested in run Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar instead of Mac OS X 10.3 Panther, it is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vseh2Jshj4\nHope this helped!\n\nA: It's worth mentioning that after Rosetta was removed from MacOS in Lion, there were attempts to 're-install' it in Lion. However, the technical obstacles were far too great to make this viable.\nhttps://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/262890-installing-rosetta-on-lion/\n", "Q: Multiple remote logins from Windows clients to a Mac mini server I would like to share a Mac mini (currently running Mac OS X Server 10.6.8) allowing coworkers running Windows XP on their boxes to perform a remote login using their username/password. They should each get a session of their own in which they can use MacOS without interfering with other users.\nAs far as I know the usual remote desktop sharing mechanisms like VNC only share the desktop of the user that is currently logged in. \nIs that scenario possible?\nThanks for your help!\n\nA: With Lion this is possible, but I think there is a limit of 2 sessions, and you don't need to be running the server tools.  When you screen share a Mac that has it enabled, you can choose to either just take over the screen as per the scenario you are used to, or move to the \"virtual display\", where you can log in as a 2nd user.\nMany (particularly PC/Windows) VNC clients are getting tripped up by this new behaviour and do not connect at at all at present, so you might need to careful with your choice of client.\nEdit: I think the 2 session limit is to provide the ability to allow an administrator to login on the 2nd session to work without interupting the normal user, I would test whether more than 2 sessions are available, but I can only get it to work from a Mac client using screen share via the finder rather than a specific VNC client app, and I only have 2 Macs...\n\nA: As far as I know, this isn't currently possible. It sounds like you're after a 'Citrix-like' solution for OSX - which doesn't exist.\nYou could do this with SSH, and remote X11 sessions for command line apps and X11 applications respectively. But no full terminal-server client style experience.\nYou may want to look into virtualisation solutions.\n", "Q: How can I add Trash icon to the sidebar in Mac OS X Lion? How can I add the Trash icon and empty Trash from the sidebar of Finder.app in Mac OS X Lion ? \nI dont have a problem to add them in the list of favorites too, but the Trash icon is not draggable. \n\nA: According to this article, each partition has its own trash folder, so dragging one to the sidebar is not a global trash. This script is:\non open\n  tell the application \"Finder\"\n    move the selection to the trash\n  end tell\nend open \n\nSave the script as an application, give it an icon, and drag it into the sidebar.\nI think that looks dangerous, though; what if you simply want to see the trash content while having a file selected? This answer looks safe:\non open input\n    repeat with i in input\n        tell application \"Finder\" to move i to the trash\n    end repeat\nend open\n\non run\n    tell application \"Finder\" to open trash\nend run\n\n\nA: First, open the trash can by clicking on it in the Dock.\nIn the Finder, press Command-shift-G (go to folder) and go to ~/.Trash\nIn the Finder window for .Trash, click the proxy icon in the title bar of the window and drag it to the sidebar.\nYou then have a trash folder in your sidebar.\nTo empty the trash from the sidebar, open Automator and create an application.\nAs the sole action in the application, select \"Run AppleScript\" and use this AppleScript:\non run {}\n  tell application \"Finder\"\n    empty the trash\n  end tell\nend run\n\nSave the application as \"Empty Trash\", and drag it to the sidebar.\n\nA: If you have iCloud enabled you may need to tweak the path offered by Daniel to \n~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/.Trash\n\n\nA: In macOS Ventura, there's a new official way. You can open Trash from Dock, then click File > Add to Sidebar in the Finder's menu bar. (Thanks to this answer for the tip.)\nThere's no official way to add \"Empty Trash\" in the sidebar, but once you click the new Trash option in the sidebar, you can just click the Empty button on the top right.\nYou can also right-click (Control-click) Trash on the Dock and click Empty Trash. Unfortunately this option isn't present if you right-click Trash in the Finder sidebar.\nOf course, you can add one of the Automator scripts mentioned in other answers, or see whether the Shortcuts app can help.\n", "Q: Is is possible to prevent OS X firmware password removal? The title pretty much says it all.\nI have set a firmware password on my MacBook Pro just to make things a bit harder in case of theft. Still, by pulling the RAM and resetting the PRAM, it would be fairly simple to clear the firmware password and boot into single user mode.\nIs there any way at all to prevent this?\n\nA: In a word, no.  If you are concerned with the contents of your machine being compromised should the machine be stolen a better bet may be to encrypt your drive with FileVault (assuming you are or intend to upgrade to using Lion).  Even if the firmware passwords was irreversible, it would not stop someone simply taking your disk out and reading another way.  The only benefit I can see is preventing a theif from being able to ever use the mcahine he just stole, but frankly this won't help stop your laptop from being stolen in the first place, although it probably would result in it getting binned if it was, rather than re-used and potentially identified at a later date via it's serial number etc.\n\nA: Sorry to state the obvious, but physical possession of the mac and knowledge of how it works will bypass the firmware password. You have to employ other strategies like FileVault 2 (or other whole disk encryption) if you can't prevent physical access to the RAM.\n", "Q: ~/Sites folder gives 403 error This is likely a stupid question, and it should be easy, but I'm clearly not seeing it. \nMy local Sites directory seems to have changed permissions since using it yesterday. It's been working fine for months and I can't for the life of me figure out what's changed.\n\n\n*\n\n*The localhost works fine, but my home Sites folder gives a 403\n\n*my local Sites directory (~/Sites) is 755 permissions, as are the directories inside, and the files are mostly 644\n\n*Permissions on ~/Sites is drwxr-xr-x+, owned by my shortname & staff, which seems right\n\n*Checked apachectl configuration and got a \"Syntax OK\" response\n\n*Just to be clear, this was working. My /etc/apache2/httpd.conf allows for user-directories (uncommented) and it resolves the virtual hosts I've set, they all just have some mystical 403 blocking them.\n\n*Adding insult to injury, the Sites work in other user profiles on the machine, and they have the same permissions\n\n\nSo - stumped. What am I just not seeing? \n\nA: Take a look at other directories' permissions; for example, your home directory vs. the other home directories:\nls -le /Users/\n\nIt should look something like this:\ndrwxr-xr-x+ 13 user1   staff   442 12 Nov  2010 user1/\n 0: group:everyone deny delete\ndrwxr-xr-x+ 63 user2   staff  2142  9 Aug 16:55 user2/\n 0: group:everyone deny delete\n\nThere's a good chance that your home directory has somehow been set to different permissions (e.g. 700), and that's causing Apache to choke.\n\nA: You have to reach that directory with the running user of the Apache process. You can check that by sudoing to it and try to go there from the / (root) directory.\nThe easiest way is to have the execute permission set for others on every directory from root to your user's Site directory.\nTo check:\nls -ld /Users ~/ ~/Site\n\nAnd the fix:\nchmod +x /Users ~/ ~/Site\n\n(You may need to sudo to modify)\n\nA: Right click, go to Get Info, and at the bottom you can change permissions.\n", "Q: iPhone data connection types Just curious — could anyone explain the exact meaning of all the connection type symbols in iPhone?\nLet's see, wifi and 3G, the fastest connection types, are quite clear, but how about the others: E is probably for EDGE (aka EGPRS), but what does the circle (O) mean? (2G something? GPRS? Or is the latter a higher-level concept in mobile data transfer?) EDGE is presumably the better of these two? (In practice I haven't noticed great difference as both are much slower than 3G.) \nFinally, how do UMTS or W-CDMA fit in this picture? And if EDGE is a 3G technology too (as stated in Wikipedia), what kind of 3G technology exactly does iPhone's \"3G\" refer to? \n(Also, please correct me if there are more than the four types I could remember.)\n\nA: On GSM (All but Verizon/Sprint):\n\n\n*\n\n*4G = LTE (or HSPA+ on AT&T)\n\n*3G = UTMS/HSDPA\n\n*E = EDGE  \n\n*o = GPRS\n\n\nOn CDMA (Verizon or Sprint in the USA):\n\n\n*\n\n*4G = LTE\n\n*3G = EV-DO\n\n*E = no equivalent - not possible  \n\n*o = 1xRTT\n\n\nA: The circle is GPRS, and UMTS or W-CDMA are technologies that make up 3G. Edge is not a 3G connection, it is a 2G connection.\n", "Q: How to recreate Lion Recovery HD partition? I have a Macbook Air Mid 2011 which came pre-installed with Lion.\nAfter a trackpad hardware problem I wanted to be sure that none of my programs was responsible for the problem. I booted into the recovery partition and used the disk utility program to repartition the disk with a single partition (the recovery partition wasn't listed there so I assumed that it was not affected of the repartitioning much like the hidden EFI partition) and reinstalled Lion onto that partition.\nLater I noticed that this has in fact removed the internal recovery partition (although it allows the \"web recovery\" to start).\nNow I'm searching for a way to \"restore\" that internal recovery partition. Is there a manual way to re-enable that partition? Or any other way to allow me to use Filevault 2 (which requires the internal recovery partition)?\n\nA: I installed a larger drive in my MBP and cloned my original disk to the new drive using SuperDuper!  This process doesn't create the restore partition. Reinstalling Lion onto the new drive created the necessary partition for me. \nI reinstalled this using the \"USB Key\" installer run from a partition on an  external drive. My User accounts, applications, etc. survived the reinstall but I did have to run the updaters for the OS and reinstall Java after the Lion reinstall.\nNote that I did all of this before enabling Filevault on the new drive. Not sure that mattered, but it seemed prudent. \n\nA: You can recreate the Lion Recovery Partition by following the instructions available at this Apple support document: http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1433\nNote, you are not supposed to be able to see the recovery partition in normal use, so can you clarify how you have identified it is missing?  What happend when you boot with the CMD-R keys held down?\n\nA: It IS possible for Disk Utility to erase the Recovery Partition. I had problems with my original installation so created a second, temporary, partition to do a clean install from the InstallESD.dmg within the Lion installer. I then used Migration Assistant to transfer my apps and files over to the new partition. In the process, a second Recovery Partition was created. Since I was having problems with the original install, I erased the original Recovery Partition and continued with the new one. When I came to transfer my files back onto the first half of the disk and erase the temporary second half, it also erased my Recovery Partition, without any request for confirmation from me. I was pretty pissed off at this!. I actually had to do clean reinstalls another two times to get it back. \nSo to answer the OP's question, you can make a new Recovery Partition by performing a clean install but if you do this via a new partition, beware that erasing that new partition in the future may also erase the Recovery Partition. You will need the \"Install Mac OS X Lion\" from the App Store. Then right click on the download and choose \"Show Package Contents\". Navigate to \"Contents\" then \"SharedSupport\" and you'll find \"InstallESD.dmg\". Double click and run the installer. You DON'T NEED Snow Leopard for this; you can do a completely clean install.\n\nA: If you reinstall OS X from App Store, it also recreates a recovery partition. I just tried it on a VM. First I removed the Recovery HD partition. Then I reinstalled OS X from App Store:\n\nIt took about two hours to download and run the installer, and after that I had a working recovery partition again.\nReinstalling OS X over an existing installation is similar to upgrading to a new major version of OS X, or it keeps user files and settings in place but replaces system files with new versions. Like upgrading OS X, it does for example remove Java though.\nUpgrading to a new major version of OS X will also restore a recovery partition.\nReinstalling OS X is also recommended by SuperDuper's developer:\n\nActually, you can easily recreate the recovery partition by simply reinstalling Lion from the App Store. (This has the additional benefit of updating the recovery partition with the most recent data, too.)\n\nCarbon Copy Cloner has an option to copy a recovery partition to another disk, but if your Mac doesn't have a recovery partition, Carbon Copy Cloner recommends reinstalling OS X:\n\n", "Q: Why is the filesize of downloaded disk image different?

You started with Safari on desktop 2 and Sparrow on desktop 3 and fullscreened both, which left desktop 2 and 3 blank (they don't get closed just because they are blank) and the fullscreened apps to the right of where they were.\nIf you don't want the blanks, just fullscreen from your original desktop directly.\nThis is working the way it should as far as I can see.  \n\nA: Take out step 2. Applications automatically make their own space when they go fullscreen in Lion.\n", "Q: Is bash in OSX case-insensitive? Are bash commands on OSX case insensitive? I type \"which TR\" and it shows /usr/bin/TR, though there is no such binary there. Same thing for other binaries, when capitalized. Or is Terminal.app maybe doing this translation? How do I turn this off?\n\nA: I managed to fix this with one line by following http://blog.nickburwell.com/blog/2008/11/mac-os-x-terminal-case-insensitive-auto\necho \"set completion-ignore-case On\" >> ~/.inputrc\n\n\nA: Take a look at your filesystem, as there are both case sensitive and case insensitive variations on HFS.  The default is case insensitive, in which case it's not so much a case of BASH, but the underlying filesystem.  You can test this by formatting a spare USB stick with the case sensitive option, and copying files over ato repeat your test, etc.\n\nA: It's your file system thing.\nI'm using APFS, it's also case insensitive but case-preserving. This post provides a good explanation about H(ierarchical)FS and APFS.\n#include <sys/stat.h>\n#include <iostream>\n        \nint main(int argc, char **argv) {\n    struct stat sb;\n    int ret = stat(argv[0], &sb);\n    std::cout << ret << std::endl;\n}\n\noutput of this program using stat:\n$ ./a.out ./test_dir/cat.png\n0\n$ ./a.out ./test_dir/caT.png\n0\n\na simple bash test\n$ cp cat.png caT.png\ncp: caT.png and cat.png are identical (not copied).\n\nAs for bash, I believe it's also case insensitive on Mac OS if you are using the default HFS or APFS since command executable is also a file and when you type a command name, the name is used search through search PATH to find that file to be executed.\n$ echo x X\nx X\n$ eChO x X\nx X\n\n\n\nA: This is actually a feature of the filesystem of your disk, not bash or Terminal.app.\nHFS+ (the Mac filesystem) is usually configured to be case insensitive but case preserving. This means that the file system will consider foo and FoO to be the same, but when you create a new file it will remember which letters where capitalized and which were not.\nWhen you format a disk with HFS+ you can chose whether the file system should case sensitive or not. If you chose to format with UFS (Unix FileSystem) it is always case sensitive, AFAIK.\nTo check whether a disk is case sensitive, run:\n diskutil info <device>\n\nFor example:\n diskutil info disk0s2\n\nLook for the Name: line. If it reads something like Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled) it means that it is case-sensitive. If it just reads Mac OS Extended (without the Case-sensitive) then it is only case preserving but not case sensitive.\n\nA: Bash is definitely case sensitive. \nI just typed whoami into terminal and the caps lock button was on.\nI got a completely different response from WHOAMI.\nI can see there is a WHOAMI command with which but I can't find it with ls.\n", "Q: Keyboard Key Mapping I run a MacBook Pro 15\", Wireless Bluetooth Apple Keyboard and Magic Mouse. \nEverything for the last year has been working great. Just recently I FINALLY had to change my batteries in my keyboard. Upon doing so, a bunch of my key combinations from the wireless keyboard no longer work. For example: \n\n\n*\n\n*In IntelliJ I can press ALT + F7 to perform a certain function. This no longer works. \n\n*In PhotoShop I used to be able to press CMD + ALT + SHIFT + S to get \"save for web\", this no longer works. \n\n\nThe basic keyboard functionality (typing/etc) works fine, its just certain key combos that do not work. If I type these EXACT same combos into the built in keyboard on my MacBook Pro, everything works fine. \nHow do I get my key mappings/settings to match that of my MacBook Pro keyboard? What changed and why? \n\nA: Ok, here's the deal: Keyboard is broken. Both ALT keys are broke. \nTook the keyboard into the Genius bar and they verified that the keys were broken.

Is there a way to make a external optical drive appear to applications as though it were an internal SuperDrive?  I am using the optical drive bay in my MacBook Pro for a secondary hard drive, and I would like to regain as much SuperDrive functionality as possible with the optical mounted via an external USB enclosure.\nI'm familiar with the hack to allow DVD Player to play via an external drive, but other apps won't recognize the drive in exactly the same way as when it's mounted internally (VMWare Fusion and Handbrake immediately come to mind).\nWhat's required with making a drive show up as a SuperDrive?\n\nA: you can get this working by editing a plist file:\n\n\n*\n\n*open a new Terminal window\n\n*edit: /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist\n\n*Insert mbasd=1 in the <string></string> value below the <key>Kernel Flags</key>.

Background: I tried recently to hook my Macbook Air to my TV using an HDMI cord and a converter. It worked completely using Netflix and iTunes but the audio did not work with ANY of the AVI files I tried using VLC, even when I connected the audio ports using a 3.5 mm audio jack cord. \nA few days later I tried to use VLC when not hooked up my TV but the sound has stopped working and I don't know why. The files are not corrupt, because they work fine on my MBP using VLC. I deleted my version of VLC, downloaded the latest version and deleted my preferences in case I had changed something vital without realizing it.\nI have confirmed that my audio output is set correctly in my settings, but I don't have external speakers so I haven't tried that yet. Has anyone ever come across an issue like this before?\nEdit: It resolved itself after a few days and I have no idea. I guess I will leave this open because someone might know what happened and the question might help someone else?\n\nA: This has happened to me before. I discovered that if you start VLC before you plug the HDMI cable in, it won't play sound out the correct output. This works consistently for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug MacBook Air in via HDMI\n\n*Verify proper output is selected in System Preferences\n\n*Start VLC up\n\n\nHope it helps.\n\nA: On Mac go to VLC Audio Settings>Audio Device>Select HDMI. That worked for me. \n\nA: Could you confirm if iTunes, Quicktime or/and Flash (youtube videos) are working correctly and have sound.\nI have experienced something very similar and the symptoms were:\n\n\n*\n\n*Starting iTunes resulted error -200 \n\n*Quicktime refused to play any AVI files (which it previously did)\n\n*No sound in ANY media app (including flash) but sound still working for system sounds and notifications in Skype, Adium.\n\n\nThe way I resolved this was to just to restart my MBP in safe mode (when powering on your MBA, hold Shift until you see a grey progress bar under the grey Apple logo). Then see if iTunes and Quicktime worked (just started them and closed them) and restarted again in normal mode. \nThe problem above hides somewhere in that for some reason Mac OS X decides that there is no hardware output device available, when it IS available. Happened when I upgraded to Lion (10.7.0) \n", "Q: MacOS 10.7 Lion window view disruptions and icon rearrangements Since installing MacOS 10.7 (Lion) my workflow has been seriously disrupted by an increasing number of instances in which my folder window view settings and icon placements are modified or reset to the apparent default, which seems to be icon view, alpha-sort, even-spaced rectangular arrangement. Like many other users, I depend heavily on using icon view and workflow-specific icon arrangements in my folders.\nThe only trigger reported so far:  Apparently, to start disrupting view settings it is sufficient to navigate in a standard Open or Save (or similar) dialog. The likelihood of a complete reset seems to increase if you actually complete the dialog, i.e., save a file.   Are the disruptions occurring just in the folders traversed or the final folder in which a file is saved?  Maybe.\nThere are at least three relevant threads in Apple forums:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do keep folder icons from rearranging\n\n*Lion Keeps Re-arranging my Folders\n\n*Roaming desktop icons\n(The third shows that this issue, or something like it, was observed by some users of 10.6.x.)\nIt seems generally agreed that icon positions and, generally, view settings are stored in each folder in an invisible file, .DS_Store.  Posters speculate how .DS_Store affected: Some say it is simply deleted (mechanism unknown) and then replaced with the default.    The only sort-of practical solution offered so far is saving a copy of .DS_Store when the window is correct, and then restoring that copy after disruption occurs.\nWhile it is clear some users are affected, judging from the proportion of total postings on the Apple Lion forum and elsewhere, the number is relatively small.   (Why? The answer might be helpful in diagnosis.)\nWhat's largely missing from the discussions  I've seen so far are systematic observations, technical analyses, ideas for instrumenting the issue, technically-plausible theories, and emphasis on finding workarounds until the  problem is fixed.  That's why I'm posting here.\nI'm concerned that with the small number of users discussing this issue in forums and the lack of useful detail in the postings, Apple will give the problem a low priority. While we tekkie users probably can't produce a fix, we ought to be able to characterize the issue and there's a decent chance of finding some kind of work-around.  There's even a hope that that us \"lucky\" ones affected can fix the problem by de-installing some old, incompatible s/w that survived 10.7 installation, or even with a simple parameter adjustment.\n\nThis is clearly a complex issue.  I find it difficult to understand how Open or Save dialog would affect folder view settings and icon arrangements. (Unless: because you can switch folder views while navigating in these dialogs, perhaps the mechanism is an incomplete or unintentional linking of those settings to the non-dialog views.)  I don't accept the \"something deletes .DS_Store\" theory because I've seen partial disruptions,  e.g. one icon displaced from here (say, upper left) to there (upper right), and only partial rearrangement in alpha-sort order.   I've seen cases in which a hopelessly rearranged view was miraculously restored. (Theory: Lion keeps .DS_Store backups, monitors the current file for inconsistencies, and --in certain cases-- restores scrambled .DS_Store files from the most recent consistence version.)  \n\nIdeas?\n\nA: Snow Leopard had a funny way of arranging and organizing Finder views. But we got used to them; however, that doesn't mean they were even remotely intuitive. Lion builds on this confusing and awkward system, changing things up again.\n\nYou can see in the image above that there are now two separate options that pertain to the Finder view settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Always open in icon view\n\n*Browse in icon view\n\n\nThe first applies to the current directory (in this case my Downloads folder will always present my icons in Icon View, at a size of 48x48, etc.), while the second applies to all child (or sub-) folders. However, and this is what most people are stumbling over, the \"Browse in ... view\" is overridden by that folders \"Always open in ... view.\"\nLet's run through an example:\nYou have a folder called Downloads. And in that folder you have another folder called PDFs. You apply both of the above settings to Downloads folder. Now you open the PDFs folder and apple \"Always open in list view.\" You close Finder and open a new window. Navigating to your Downloads folder, will show all its contents as icons, while navigating to the PDFs folder, will show a list view. So now you have the parent folder (Downloads) with both settings enabled, but when you open the child folder (PDFs), it opens in list view.\nIf you understand the behaviour, it makes sense, but if it's lost on you (trust me, it is on a lot of users as it is far from being an intuitive system), then you'd be scratching your head why both the options are checked, but PDFs opens in list view.\n\nA: Starting in Lion Apple added some new terminology to the way windows arrange icons.\nIn the view options palette there is the Arrange By: pull down menu which we have all used since time immemorial.\nThere is also now a Sort By: pull down menu.\nIf you want your icons sorted by name, use the \"Sort By:\" menu.\nThe \"Arrange By:\" menu now applies to that ridiculous view you get when you go to \"All My Files\" and other such views.\n\nA: I had the same annoying problem for 2 days in 10.7.1 but just solved it by copying a .DS_Store file from another disk using @BinaryNights Forklift. \nI use SuperDuper to mirror my disk once a week, so that procedure came to my rescue ! \nbtw it is the .DS_Store file from my root folder \n\nA: I stopped syncing iDisk in Mobile Me and that fixed the problem.  \n\nA: As far I can see this was an Apple problem, nothing a user could do about it. \nSeems to be fixed for most users in 10.7.2\nBUT, some users report problems with Finder retaining View Options settings.  That's a matter for a new thread. \n\nA: I've had this problem intermittently since Lion and it is still happening in 10.7.3\nIt seem to be triggered by restarts (I have not seen it otherwise). And it doesn't seem to happen every restart. But maybe half of my restarts totally resort my desktop icons which doesn't help since I put them in my own locations for a reason. \nI keep hoping that the next update will sort the behaviour, but it hasn't happened.\n", "Q: Can you use the command line on a Mac to get to a networked Mac? I have a networked mac desktop and a wireless laptop.   I would like to use the desktop mac to test web pages from the laptop.

It seems like the CLI should see the other mac on the network since I have logged onto it from the network and have the other mac hard drive visible on the desktop.\nthanks,\n\nA: Use the mount command to show the various mounted shares. You'll see something like this:\n$ mount\n\n//GUEST:@betafat/tmp on /Volumes/tmp (smbfs, nodev, nosuid, ...\nafp_0h2ueA0008BK0000oM0000VU-2.2e000005 on /Volumes/admin (afpfs, nodev, nosuid, ...\n\nThe first line is a Windows SMB share from an XP computer, the second line is an AFP share from another Mac.\nNote the mount points after the word 'on' above.\nYou can access the mounted shares using mount point just like you would any other directory, i.e. ls /Volumes/admin\n\nA: Another option would be using ssh to \"remote\" into the machine.  To enable ssh go to System Preferences -> Sharing Preferences -> Remote Login.\nThen you would login by typing ssh <username>@<hostname (or <ip_address> instead of hostname).  After connecting, you're working in a shell that's executing all commands on the remote machine.\n\nA: I confess to being slightly confused by the original question.\nAre both of the computers behind the same router and on the same network (LAN) or are they on two separate networks and you want to connect from one to the other?\nssh is the first step\nRegardless of what you are doing next, the first step is to enable ssh (System Preferences » Sharing » Remote Login, which is OFF by default).\nIf different networks…\nAssuming that you want to connect to your personal computer on a different network, the easiest way is to use DynDNS which you can find at http://dyn.com/dns/dyndns-free/. They will give you two hostnames for free, use one for the desktop and one for the laptop.\nIf same networks…\nIf you are both on the same network, you should be able to connect to other computer using hostname.local where 'hostname' is whatever the computer is named in System Preferences » Sharing. I think the default is usually like \"John Smith's MacBook.local\" or some such. I always change mine right away.\nIf they are on the same network, you can use File Sharing (although it's still not 100% clear what you are trying to do) or any of the 'remote' options below…\nIf different networks…\nIf you are on different networks and want to mount your hard drive, you could use Back To My Mac and file sharing, but I've never found that reliable. You are much better off trying ssh mounted with either ExpanDrive or Transmit.\n", "Q: Can we modify UDID added in iOS developer portal? I have an ios developer account.

However, I often like to open up and individual message for a task I'm working on and move it to a different Desktop.  Opening up a message in full screen mode does nothing more than bring up a overlay showing the message but doesn't open another window that I can move elsewhere.  \nIs there a way to get individual messages in different windows to move to other Desktops when using Mail.app in full screen?\n\nA: When I need to open a message in other desktop I quit full screen mode, open the message(s) and then fullscreen again: just the main Mail window goes to fullscreen, leaving the messages windows open in the desktop where they were open.\n\nA: I was using mail.app in full screen and hit the same problem.  Can't figure out a solution and now am not using it in full screen.  The way I am using now is create a new Desktop, assign the mail.app only running on this desktop, and make the mail.app main screen as large as the Desktop so that it looks like running as full screen mode.\n\nA: As mentioned here you can use a trackpad gesture to move a little to the other space (just enough to make the black inter-space bar visible) and then use a keyboard shortcut to open the current e-mail (Cmd-O) or create a new one (Cmd-N). You will get a normal new window which can then be dragged to any space you want.\n\nA: In 10.10 I use the following series of actions attached to a keyboard shortcut using BetterTouchTool (although it should work for older versions on OS X):\n\n\n*\n\n*Send Ctrl+Cmd+F to Mail (tells Mail.app to exit fullscreen)\n\n*Wait 3 seconds (waits for app to properly exit fullscreen - adjust to your system's speed)\n\n*Send Cmd+O to Mail (opens selected message in new window)\n\n*Send Cmd+` to Mail (switches back to main mail window)\n\n*Send Ctrl+Cmd+F to mail (switches back to fullscreen)\n\n\nBy assigning a single keyboard shortcut to this, I can easily open the selected message in a new window and return the main mail app to fullscreen in one go.\n\nA: I had the same issue. My workaround is to open a new viewer window in full screen, which allows me access to my other messages in the preview pane, and ability to copy attachments, text back and forth to the full screen window through swiping with my fingers.

So this is my third hard drive that I installed on my intel Mac OS X desktop (made in 2007), and I installed Western Digital Black Caviar (which is supposed to last 3 yrs, I believe). But the hard drive is already failing: I hear tapping noises, occasionally, the hard drive clicks just once, and there's been some freezing lately (for example, when waking up my Mac from sleep mode, it freezes on black screen and finally turns on after 15 seconds). Sometimes, Safari freezes, sometimes, I get a scrambled screen with Safari open, etc. Do you have any idea why this is all happening? This Western Digital drive was installed barely two weeks ago, and now it's failing? Maybe the hard drive is not the problem?\n\nA: Failing hard drives tend to cause freezing on your computer, as it takes longer for your Mac to read system files.  If you think your HD is failing (as it sounds), it should still be under warranty, so you should be able to get it replaced.  You can check your drive status in Disk Utility: http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=DiskUtility/10.5/en/duh1896.html but this check is not always 100% accurate.  \n\nA: If you also experience random crashes sometime it might be a good idea to run Memtest86 to check whether it's actually the RAM that is causing problems.\nAlso, boot from your installation disk and let Disk Utility verify the harddisk (not SMART status, but the \"real\" verify which has its own button). If it finds errors, I recommend to buy DiskWarrior to repair the filesystem as in my experience DiskUtils can't repair anything at all.\n", "Q: In mail.app can one set the default account that is used to send mails to a specific person In mail I use two email accounts, a gmail for private use and an email adress that was allocated to me for use when mailing to teachers and staff. \nI would like to set mail.app to automatically use my private email adress when I'm mailing to my friends and my university's email adress when mailing to my teachers etc.\nI want this because now I tend to forget to change this account, using the gmail when mailing to teachers and using the universities account when mailing to friends, which can cause some problems when they reply, having emails end up in the wrong mailboxes and so forth.\nCan it be done? \nCurrently I'm on Snow Leopard, but I will be moving to Lion soon.\n\nA: You actually can set a rule to move the received message to different folders according to the sender, either your friends or your university's teach.\nIn terms of the automatically sending message to different receipt with different account, I can't figure it out, but there is a manual way.

The same thing happens when I try Detect Displays on my MBA.\nI tried a different DisplayPort cable (full-size DisplayPort plug on each end) with my DELL laptop running Windows 7, and saw the same problem.  And then same thing happens when I try Detect Displays.\nSo it appears the problem is with my cable or my MBA, but the display.\nNonetheless, it's still an Apple hardware and/or software bug if my MBA locks up when I connect a defective monitor.  But it's unlikely to be fixed since it's unlikely to be reproduced by an Apple engineer.\nUpdate #2: I got a new DELL U2711 display (which works with my MBA using a the Mini DisplayPort cable).  My MBA is locking up again when I plug the cable in, unless I reboot first and plug in before logging in.\nI submitted Problem ID 10259810 on https://bugreport.apple.com/.\nUpdate #3: I just tried connecting the DEL U2711 without rebooting first, now that I'm running OS X 10.7.3: my MBA did not lock up. (They may have fixed it prior to 10.7.3—I haven't tried to reproduce this problem for quite a long time.)\n\nA: Since the mouse pointer gets frozen, you can be pretty confident that the lockup is happening deep down in the system - kernel extensions, hardware interrupt type things.\nAssuming you have a great backup and don't mind futzing a bit (and I'll also assume you haven't extra cables, monitors, macs to just eliminate one thing at a time) you can surely try booting again in Safe Mode. \nTo boot in Safe Mode, hold the shift key down - it will bypass all non essential kernel extensions and may or may not help you isolate the issue.\nIt's best to be systematic when troubleshooting - so I'd try that one guess, then be more logical about it.\nWhy not start with the \"bible\" on Isolating issues in Mac OS X? \nDon't forget you get 90 days of support from Apple - you can hit them up on AppleCare (800-APL-CARE or online - express lane) - they have a standing exception for people that cover software purchases for support - even if your hardware is out of the free software support timeframe. \nThe wisdom to isolate software before hardware is probably the best call here - even though it's a monitor and clearly buggy. What are the odds that Lion and the hardware failed at the same time? It's possible and you might be able to take your Air to another monitor with your adapter / cable and rule that out.\nGood luck, and happy hunting - partner!\n", "Q: Native Foreign Exchange Trading Software Know anyone any foreign exchange (forex) trading software native for OS X?

I have moved to another country, which comes along with the joy of moving apple store accounts. This would be easier, however, if there were a trivial automated way to re-download all of my free apps under the new ID.\nBefore going any further, I know that I'll have to re-purchase any in-app purchases, and that no process is going to get me my apps back free. It sucks, but there it is.\nI've written a small tool to list each app in my library and identify it by owner, price, and store URL. The thing is, I want to take the one extra step: Re-purchase the app from the store, under the new account, and replace the old one. Right now, this process is painfully manual:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the existing app\n\n*Open the store URL in my browser. This opens iTunes to the app\n\n*Buy the app\n\n*repeat ad nauseam\nI've got almost 150 apps to do this with. It'll take forever.\nIs there an easier way to bulk delete/redownload apps in iTunes?\n\nA: Check my story:\nDo I need to repurchase apps if I moved countries?\nIn short - you can't. You have to stick to your old account for updates of the software you bought and create a new AppleID for purchases in new country.\nUnless of course you are willing to pay for all applications (and in-app purchases) again. Then there's no need to have another AppleID, you just switch store country, but there's no automation for re-buying them unfortunately.\n\nA: No solution for a new account. But you don't need to use a new Apple account, you can just sign in on your old Apple ID. That way all your existing apps are already authorised and you don't have to re-download them.\nOr if you've already deleted them, they will show up as purchased.\n", "Q: Why is my iPod Shuffle an \"Unknown Device\"? Help, I've tried everything.\nI have an iPod Shuffle 2nd generation and ever since I plugged it into an AC wall charger, my PC has stopped recognizing it. \nI tried multiple PCs, to ensure it's not my PC.\nIt blinks orange 3 times and then blinks green once, when I unplug it. But when I keep on docking/undocking I finally get it to have a steady blinking orange light, but then it detects my iPod as \"Unknown Device\" in Windows.\nMy iPod does work and charges with the AC wall charger, and I can listen to the songs that are in but I can't sync/put new songs due to this issue.\nI tried nearly every solution that exists, such as updating the driver in device manager, making it be a mass storage device so I can reformat it, but I can't get it to become a mass storage device, it just detects it as an \"Unknown Device\" no matter what. I also tried to stop the iPod service to make iTunes recognize it as a mass storage or anything, just so I can reformat it (after doing this it should be no problem detecting on iTunes) but nothing works..\nGetting tired of this.. any solutions?! I tried the Apple Reset Utility, Apple Guide 5 steps etc.. Nothing will recognize since it is an \"Unknown Device\".\nShould I just throw it away?\n\nA: My suspicion is that your charger was not the standard AC charger, and the voltage some how blew part of the port hardware, but not all of it. Are you near an Apple Store or a Reseller? They can probably try to boot it, and if it won't be recognized, they may give you a recycling discount on a new shuffle. It's probably not cost conscious to repair when a new one is $49.\n", "Q: Shift + T not working on Apple Wireless Keyboard Yesterday I was doing some typing on my keyboard, when I found that I could not type a capital T with either shift key. I tried a different user account, and even rebooted into Snow Leopard (was using Lion) to no avail. I tried a USB keyboard, and it works fine. I don't understand what is wrong because the shift key still works, and the t key still works, just not at the same time. Any Ideas?\n\nA: I did that once by accidentally setting an application hot key to be Shift-(and some letter key). Did you recently change hot key settings? If not, did you install something recently that may have had hot keys. If all else fails, try rebooting in Safe Boot Mode (hold down the Shift key on startup until the gear starts spinning), log in and see if you can type. When you are done in Safe Boot, restart w/o any keys.\n\nA: It has mysteriously started to work again, along with two other problem keys, B and G (they worked with the right shift, but not the left). Thanks for all the help, and hopefully this doesn't happen again.\n", "Q: Used to be possible in Snow Leopard to move an app between `desktops` with a keyboard shortcut? You could assign a keyboard shortcut to move the app with focus to a specific desktop.  Can't find this in Lion.

I have a clean Lion install with no iCal events. I would like to get the iCal in Lion up-to-date, either from Time Machine or the iPhone.\nI have tried syncing the phone, but nothing happens to either device. I have tried manually moving files from Time Machine, but the Lion iCal does not recognize anything.\n\nA: The best chance of success it to make a new user account and try syncing the phone to the new empty calendar. Just sync the iCal data. \nThen back up the lion iCal data to one file in /Users/Shared and import that to your proper account. \nShould that fail, trash that temporary user account and make another temporary admin account. \n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off time machine ( to prevent an automatic backup slowing things down )\n\n*Set lion to back up to your snow leopard time machine ( stop any backup if it commences)\n\n*Start iCal\n\n*Browse backups from the iCal menu\n\n*Restore your calendars one by one\n\n*Back up calendar data to /Users/Shared\n\n*Set Time Machine to your preferred destination and clean up the temporary user. \n\n\nA: Just found out a way to restore it, I had the same problem. \n\n\n*\n\n*In Snow Leopard or Time Machine, get your calendar files (/Users//Library/Application Support/iCal /Sources/Calendars) then exit Time machine/put the files on Lion.\n(or)\n1(a) Open calendar on Snow leopard, and export a Calendar Archive to a convenient location (eg usb stick)\n\n*Open Calendar on the Lion machine and export a Calendar Archive to your desktop or wherever\n\n*right click the Lion / Mountain Lion .icbu file, show package contents, and then replace the \"Calendar\" folder with the one retrieved from Time Machine/Snow Leopard or the one that is inside the package contents of the Snow Leopard calendar .icbu file.\n\n*Import the file in Calendar, and boom. Old calendars and events are back.\n\n\nA: Do you still have the iCal calendar on Snow Leopard? Select File > Export and then import it onto your Lion Mac, which should sync it to your iPhone.\nAnother easy is to sync it to your google calendar. You need an account with Google, and you may need to activate your Google calendar here: https://www.google.com/calendar/\nOnce that's done, just import your exported calendar into Google Calendar. Now on Lion iCal, go to iCal > Preferences > Accounts and add a new account. Type in your Google credentials and it should appear. I like this method because it can be setup on the iPhone too, for complete wireless background sync of everything.\n\nA: The following did work for me and my 16GB+ mails:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the following files (e.g. from your Snow Leopard backup) prior to first opening ical:\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/Keychains/ (folder \"Keychains\")\n\n*~/Library/Calendars (folders \"Calendars\")\n\n*~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iCal.* (ical preferences files, com.apple.iCal.helper.plist, com.apple.iCal.plist)\n\n*~/Library/Preferences/iCalExternalSync.plist\n\n\n*then open iCal in Lion...import/update will follow\n\n\nIf you have opened iCal prior to the above steps, these files have already been created, so you have to replace them with your backups from Snow Leopard described above\nIf you have set up calendar accounts in system preferences \"Mail, Contacts & Calendars\" you might have to delete them before applying the above steps\nP.S.\nI'm not quite sure if the following steps are necessary (or did help me) for iCal import because MobileMe sync works now different in Lion (there isn't an option for syncing calendars anymore within System Preferences—>MobileMe)...\nI did a MobileMe sync in Snow Leopard (within System Preferences—>MobileMe) prior to the clean install of Lion.\n\n\n*\n\n*Calendars\n\n*Mail Accounts\n\n*Mail rules, Signatures, and Smart Mailboxes\n\n", "Q: Form autocomplete on iPhone/iPad Generall Safari automatically prompts to save form data like Username, Password.. But on some pages, it never asks for the same.\nHow can we force it to ask for saving form data on any website?\n\nA: Safari uses the form's fields name to detect if they can be autocompleted.  Unfortunately, some sites use names that are not recognized by the browser, which in that case does not fill them. \nThis is not a safari issue, but more a website issue, and I think there is no workaround on the iPhone.\nBut there may be a workaround : I use 1password on both my mac and iPhone, and it is more \"tolerant\" than Safari for detecting fields.\nThe advantage is that, when I sync my iPhone app with the one on the mac, I can then use the iPhone app to autologin within Safari mobile. But it is a workaround, as I must save the form's content on the mac before being able to use it on the phone, and the detection is still not perfect.\n", "Q: Can Time Machine remove some files completely, and/or sync only to within 6 months? I wonder for Time Machine, if I delete 3 files on the hard drive that I will for sure never want to use again (for example, that are 1GB each), can I tell Time Machine that please don't archive these files and remove them from the history so they don't need to occupy any space?\nCan Time Machine also be configure to keep history for up to 6 months (or 4 weeks)?  Or otherwise, how does Time Machine handle it when the backup hard drive is full?  (will it automatically delete the oldest history?)  thanks.\n\nA: You can add files and folders to the exclusion list - this only prevents future backups from copying those files. You can script these exclusion lists with terminal in Lion using tmuil.\nYou can delete all versions of files and folders using the Time Machine interface. This is a somewhat manual practice.\nApple doesn't support (there's no built in setting) to set an arbitrary time limit for backups. Once the drive fills, TimeMachine will delete enough backups to start the current backup and then warn you that files have been deleted. It will do the deletion silently if you don't ask to be warned in the preference pane. You have to monitor the drive if you can't afford Time Machine automatically deleting files when it needs more room.\n", "Q: Any Hard drive Mirroring or Software Raid or Sync tools on the Mac that are free? I am trying to mirror a hard drive that is 3TB on the PC using SyncToy from Microsoft's PowerToys  (as a backup method).  But Mac is usually better for indexing and content searching, but is there either something similar to SyncToy on the Mac, or any Software RAID or Sync tools on the Mac that are free?\nI don't want to use a hardware RAID drive because (1) it is expensive and (2) if the RAID controller becomes bad, then I can't access either drive (unless if I remove the case and somehow connect the drive by itself, I think?  -- which is not as simple as two independent hard drives, because then if one drive fails, there is still another fully working drive right there to be used immediately)  thanks.\n\nA: The Apple provided Disk Utility (and diskutil shell command) will allow you full RAID control over internal and external drives. You do have to erase the drives to add the RAID capability, but then you can join those drives into RAID. That is the only potential drawback to implementing RAID storage on the Mac.\nDrive spanning, JBOD, striping and mirroring are all possible with Mac OS X software RAID.\nLion brings the concept of physical and logical volumes to the OS, but RAID on Snow Leopard is also very fully functional.\nIf you brake a mirrored RAID set - the drives are valid when connected to the same mac and portable to any other mac. You are not locked into a proprietary standard and don't need any additional software for any of this functionality.\nrsync and ditto are free sync tools - very scriptable, powerful, and free.\n\nA: +1 for bmike's Disk Utility answer--that's definitely the best option for software RAID.\nA nice, schedulable rsync wrapper is Carbon Copy Cloner by Mike Bombich (donationware).\n", "Q: Application appearing on all spaces in Lion I had a couple of applications set up to be on all spaces when I was running on Snow Leopard, but now that I'm on Lion I want to turn that off.\nI can't work out how to do it.

Perhaps there's a plist or something similar I can edit?\n\nA: In the dock you can right click the application, go to Options and de-select the option there.\n\n\nA: When the app is running, you can hold your mouse pressed over the dock icon and change desktop binding to none or a specific space.

Is there a way or a hack to get the chat history to my folders that get pulled as well so that my search results will include information from Chat as well. \n\nA: Zevlag is right. You're not going to be able to do precisely what you were after (true IMAP syncing of chat logs). But here's a couple of things that you can:\nFirst, you could download your chat logs using this method: http://freshhorse.wordpress.com/2011/07/29/leaving-gmail-and-bringing-your-chats-with-you/\n\n\n*\n\n*This will take quite a bit of time and I doubt you'd want to do it over and over to keep your logs up-to-date.

Therefore when you synced, the book was not transferred and then the iPad was synced. (Book basically deleted, sorry)\nThe fix is fairly simple, I believe you should be able to redownload your iBook for free, per Apple's new rules with previous purchases.

Even if the app itself is still running, closing the window and opening a new one doesn't work.\nI am SURE it used to work on my old Mac, but I simply cannot find an option in preferences anywhere and Google is not my friend.\n\nA: I had the same issue on my new Mac, when I checked the history file ~/.bash_history I discovered that it was owned by root. I run sudo chown username .bash_history, now when I reopen terminal my history is preserved.\n\nA: Assuming you have not modified the default behaviour in any way, you should be able to scroll through a list of your previous commands simply by hitting the up cursor key.  There are so many alternatives depending on what shell you are using if you have changed the defaults etc, so that would be useful info.  Also, what OS are you on, from Lion onwards Terminal reloads the last 500 lines out output even from the last closed screen on restart.\n\nA: If your Terminal is losing the history (previously entered commands), try this:\nCheck first, in your home directory, who owns the file .bash_history:\nls -al .bash_history\n\nIf for some reason the file is not owned by your username, will appear (for example) in the listing as:\n-rw-------    1 root      staff       32 Jul 11  2011 .bash_history\n\nFix it with:\nsudo chown [username] .bash_history\n\n(source: http://www.paulmc.org/2009/01/enable-bash-history-in-terminal/ )\nNow close Terminal, open it again and you should be capable of seeing previously entered commands by pressing the up arrow (that is, if you're using bash as your Terminal shell - - the default).\n\nA: As far as I know, the scrollback history is discarded when a window is closed; there is no way to reopen a window that you closed to review its scrollback history. There is, however, a preference setting that lets you configure “one last chance” to review or save the scrollback history after you exit a window’s initial shell (I am not sure if this matches what you mean by “after you quit the window”).\nIn 10.6, this preference setting is in Terminal’s preferences (the Terminal > Preferences… menu item, or its shortcut: ⌘,) under the Settings section in the Shell tab of your “settings set” (probably named Basic, look for the one with the word “Default” under its name). The preference is labeled “When the shell exits:”.\n\nThe available options are\n\n\n*\n\n*Close the window\nThe window will always disappear immediately after you exit the shell.  \n\n*Close if the shell exited cleanly\nThe window will be closed immediately (as above) if the shell gives a exit code of zero (“exited cleanly”).\nThe window will remain open (see below) if the shell gives a non-zero exit code.\n\n*Don’t close the window\nThe window will always stay open when you exit the shell; the line [Process completed] will be appended to contents of the window.\nTo close the window you must use\n\n\n*\n\n*the Shell > Close Window menu item (Shell > Close Tab for a tab), or\n\n*⌘W (the menu item’s shortcut), or\n\n*the red close button in the title bar (the x button in the tab for a tab).\n\n\n\nA: This is controlled globally by enabling System Preferences -> General -> Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps.\n", "Q: How much will adding an extra hard drive to my MacBook Pro affect battery performance? I have a current MacBook Pro 15\" i7 2.2Ghz with a 500GB 7200RPM (default) hard drive.\nI am thinking of replacing both the current hard drive and the superdrive with two Seagate Momentus Hybrid 500 GB drives and placing them in RAID0 for optimal performance.\nNow, I don't think performance will be a problem, but how about battery life? Are there any examples of users who already have done similar things and noticed the effect on battery life?\n\nA: Having a second hard drive will certainly decrease battery life by a noticeable amount. Behind the CPU and LCD, the hard drive is the largest drain on battery.\nA word of caution: RAID 0 is almost never a good idea, unless you'll be doing backups constantly and don't mind being totally down if a drive fails. You'll get better performance from an SSD and you'll be able to keep your optical drive.\n\nA: Go with an SSD. The lack of moving parts will increase battery life.\nOn my previous (late 2011) non-Retina MBP, I replaced the optical drive with a 512GB SSD, (The optical drive is basically useless 90% of the time - may as well use the space for SOMETHING.), and moved the operating system installations (OSX and Win7) to the SSD. This significantly improved battery life as well as overall performance.\nIf you don't want to pony up the cash for two large SSDs, put one SSD in along with a higher RPM spin drive. \nAlso, check out the Corsair 16GB RAM upgrade available from Newegg, among other places. Takes about 10 minutes to install, doesn't void your warranty, and also really helps overall performance.\n\nA: i wonder how well a hybrid will work in a raid0.\ncould there be some logic that would make the ssd portion of this hybrid useless when used as a raw raid0 drive?\ni'm not sure about their logic of caching from spinning drive to the ssd portion.  but if it's by file name or structure, the raid-0'ness of it might defeat that.\njust a thought\n", "Q: Official apple Lion USB Thumb Drive licensing I own two macs, one running Snow Leopard and one running Leopard. My partner also has a mac running leopard. I am planing to upgrade all three to Lion and am looking at the Official Lion USB Thumb Drive as a way to do this.\nSo my questions are as follows: \nDoes buying the thumb drive bind a license for Lion to my iTunes account? I then assume I can install Lion on up to 5 of my own macs.\nCan I use the same thumb drive on my partners Mac? Do they need to purchase Lion from the app store as well afterwards?\n\nA: This is a very good question, because the ability to link your purchase to your iTunes account it tied in within the actual purchase from the Mac App Store.  I have read, but cannot confirm, that when you purchase a new Mac that has the drive included, they will \"credit\" this against your iTunes account (or provide a facility to allow you to do this).\nNew Macs with the stick included are in an odd situation, because they come with the drive, but also come with the Recovery partition included as Firmware (not as a disk partition) that will allow you to re-install online.  The online install option required authentication to prove validity, so this would be useless if they did not make the connection somehow.  I think actually it's related to your system serial number, they know it was sold with Lion, so they will let you download even without a purchase history or Apple ID connection.\nIt should be noted that the Ts&Cs for the stick suggest that once you have installed via the retail thumb drive, you cannot then subsequently reinstall or recover using the recovery partition, in fact I believe that it does not create one.  Some suggest this is because there is no mechanism to link the thumb drive purchase to your Apple ID.\nI think the best solution is to avoid the retail stick, purchase Lion through the MAS, and then burn your own install DVD/USB/HDD installer from the package that you download.  This get's it linked to your iTunes account and provides the license to do multiple installs, and provides you with both the means to do a full local restore without internet connectivity, as well as online recovery.\nWhether this is technically against the license to install on your partners machine is hard so say, depends, I suppose you could own the machine, but just not use it as the primary user - there is no problem with his/her machine being subsequently used by a different iTunes ID.  The spirit if the MAS license is all your home PCs, which I take to mean all the ones in your home, not just the ones which legally belong to you.  Unlike purchases from the MAS the OS does not require you to have proof of purchase to install etc.\nEDIT: Put it this way in summary, the multiple install license is a feature of the Mac App Store, and not specific to Lion.  Purchasing Lion outside of the MAS might not afford you the same rights, certainly it removes the right to do online restores.\n", "Q: Report a problem with an app I purchased on the Mac App Store I have purchased an app on the Mac App Store which doesn't work at all on my computer.

I sometimes have to make git merges on the console. Up to now, for resolving conflicts, I was using Xcode 3's FileMerge (you can open it on the console using the 'opendiff' command). If conflicts show, I use 'git mergetool' which automatically invokes opendiff for each of the conflicting files.\nHowever, Xcode 4 features a much nicer mergetool component for resolving conflicts. I believe this component is part of the Xcode 4 executable, rather than standalone. It allows you to preview the merged file, and directly edit merged code on a case-by-case basis, which makes merging complex conflicts incredibly fast and satisfactory.\nIs there any way to use the Xcode 4 mergetool when invoking 'git mergetool' from the Terminal?\nI cannot find an executable for this tool inside the Xcode 4 bundle. Any hack that achieves this would be welcome.\n\nA: opendiff takes two filename arguments, and an --ancestor parameter with a third filename, to produce a three-way diff, and a --merge parameter to say the output file to use for the conflict resolution.\nSo go:\n[mergetool \"opendiff\"]\n    cmd = \"opendiff \\\"$LOCAL\\\"  \\\"$REMOTE\\\" \\\"$(if test -f \\\"$BASE\\\"; then echo \\\"--ancestor $BASE\\\"; else echo \\\"--ancestor $LOCAL\\\"; fi)\\\" --merge=\\\"$MERGED\\\" \"\n[merge]\n    tool = opendiff\n\nThat should make git use opendiff as its merge tool, when there are merge conflicts.\nThat said, I VERY much prefer DiffMerge from SourceGear, which is a free diff and three-way-merge tool that does much better, word-oriented, conflict resolution. And in DiffMerge's documentation there's what to tell git to make it the default diffing and merging tool.\n\nA: You can edit in the (very basic) text editor within FileMerge by opening the editor pane -- which is closed by default.  To open the editor in FileMerge, drag the dot below the center diff column up to open the editor pane.\n\nA: This ended up working for me\n[merge]\n  tool = opendiff\n\n[mergetool]\n  keepBackup = false\n\n[mergetool \"opendiff\"]\n  cmd = \"opendiff \\\"$LOCAL\\\" \\\"$REMOTE\\\" -merge \\\"$MERGED\\\"\"\n\n", "Q: How can I disable media playback in Finder document icons? I'm on Lion now, and hoped that Apple would have added the option to disable the quick preview buttons on the icons some way. Here's the problem I have:\n\nWhen I click on a video in Finder just to select it, I often hit the tiny triangle (see screenshot above), making the video play inside the icon. This is very irritating, since I have to click the teeny tiny triangle again to stop that.\nFinder has a \"Show Icon Previews\" setting in the view options, but that does not do what I want, as it disables the whole thumbnail preview all together, like so:\n\nThis clearly not very helpful. I'm looking for a way to keep the previews, but disable the controls on the icons, so that whatever I do, the icon looks like this:\n\nI'd like to do this for all file types with these silly tiny controls on a 32x32 icon.\n\nA: The Feature is controlled by QuickLook and therefore you need to either disable the corresponing movie-generator or replace it with a better one.\n\n\n*\n\n*On 10.11 and higher: Disable System Integrity Protection (SIP)\n\n*Go To /System/Library/QuickLook\n\n*Compress Movie.qlgenerator  \n\n\n*\n\n*Move the created zip from your desktop to the folder\n\n*Confirm with password\n\n*Delete the Movie.qlgenerator\n\n*Confirm with password\n\n\n*Download qlMoviePreview\n(Here is a Download Link for the Lazy)\n\n*Extract and Copy the qlMoviePreview.qlgenerator to /System/Library/QuickLook\n\n\n*\n\n*Confirm with password\n\n\n*Open Terminal and type qlmanage -r; qlmanage -r cache\n\n*Maybe a reboot helps for Quicklook to change completely\n\n\nNow the Finder Movie Thumbnails show an image but have no longer a playback button in it.\n\nA: Use Terminal.app to set the hidden preference QLInlinePreviewMinimumSupportedSize to a larger icon size:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder QLInlinePreviewMinimumSupportedSize -int 514 \n\n\nA: Are you really seeing this on a 32x32 icon? This discussion suggests you won't see these controls for icons that are smaller than 64x64, which seems accurate (I just tried it).\nHowever, my guess is that it will be impossible to disable this without disabling icon previews. Icon previews seem synonymous with Quick Look, so you either get Quick Look previews or you don't — and Quick Look icon previews come with those buttons.\n\nA: A workaround would be to develop the habit of selecting icons by dragging a selection rectangle.\n\nA: A workaround that can work in some cases is to Command-click or Shift-click the icon, which will not trigger the icon's play button. This works well if you have no other icons selected already, but if you have other icons selected, this will add to that selection instead of making a new selection like a normal, unmodified click would.\n\nA: Another idea could to be to change your Finder window view to List mode and increase the Icon size to maximum. \n\n\nIt’s not perfect, though. It will keep the preview and you won’t be able to play the video. \n\nA: I think best solution is here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8107966\nThis is working in Big Sur.\n", "Q: Aperture (iPhoto) quick view I’ve put all my photographs into Aperture’s photo library which means that in the Finder they are hidden in a special folder, making it virtually impossible to quickly browse the photos there. On the other hand, starting up Aperture quickly demands more than 1 GB of RAM, which is something I’d really like to avoid.\nIn ‘Open File’ dialogues there is a ‘Media’ option which more or less does what I’m looking for. Is there a way to add this to the Finder (Snow Leopard) or is there some external program, I could use as a quick viewer?\n(As the situation is similar to iPhoto, I’d expect solutions for the iPhoto library to work as well.)\n\nA: Some options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a Media Browser with Automator - takes about 30 seconds - and you can invoke it in many ways - including with a contextual menu its,\n\n*Install an app like http://www.karelia.com/imedia/ which will do the same with some extra bells and whistles.\nThat said, if you use an app like Aperture or iPhoto to manage your photos then they are the \"go-to\" apps for anything to do with your photos - including viewing them. What you have there is an argument for getting more Ram ;)\nIf you really want to you could run either app in Referenced Mode. This would leave your Masters (and note: Masters only) accessible via the Finder. While I am happy recommending Aperture in Referenced Mode, I would have significant reservations about running iPhoto in that way.\n", "Q: iMac won't shut down per schedule Wife's 2007 24\" 2.8 ghz 6GB RAM running SL, and now Lion.\nFor the past month or so, It won't automatically shut down at night per the schedule in System Prefs/Energy Saver pane.

How do I set the vibrate to not fire for alarms but still fire for calls, texts, emails, reminders, etc?\nI have looked at third party alarms but they all seem quite fallible, many do not work when you press the home button. Those that do use push notifications to get around this but this feature obeys the silent switch on the phone which means you have to remember to switch the sound on each night. And I have had two of them just randomly not work on me.\nIs there a way of turning the vibrate off for just the alarm?\nI'm willing to jailbreak for this.\n\nA: I know it`s been a while.\n@SomewhereThere's answer is good for any version before IOS9.\nSince IOS 9\nYou may disable vibration from the alarm menu per alarm independently.\n\nIn the alarm settings. When you add a new alarm time, you can select sounds > vibration and set it to ”none”. You can also edit existing alarm schedules to disable vibration individually.\n\nCredits\n\nA: In iOS 6 vibrate settings, set \"vibrate on ring\" to \"on\" and \"vibrate on silent\" to \"off\".\nThen, when on silent your alarm will ring without vibrating, and when not on silent everything will vibrate and ring normally.\n\nA: NoVibratedWakeup is a Cydia tweak that turns off the vibration when the alarm sounds.\n\nA: I have seen many answers that did not work here. So here is my clear explanation of what I had to do, using iOS 7.1.2 on an iPhone, to get it so that the horrible buzzing vibrate does not happen when you set the clock alarm clock.    It is not a dream solution, because the method does ALSO influence the vibration behavior for OTHER sounds on your phone.\n\n\n*\n\n*In settings > sounds, down inside the section Reminder Alerts I have vibration set to none. (this may not actually be necessary for the above goal. just how I have it set.)\n\n*In settings > sounds, down inside the section Calendar Alerts I have vibration set to none. (this may not actually be necessary for the above goal. just how I have it set.)\n\n*The main thing:  In settings > sounds, at the very top, I had to turn both Vibrate on Ring and Vibrate on Silent OFF.       (The reason I turned that Vibrate on Silent to be off is because I have my settings > Do Not Disturb > Scheduled set to make my phone go into Do Not Disturb mode between 10pm and 7am. So for this \"no vibrate on alarm\" goal, I have to have Vibrate on Silent off, or the phone would say, oh, he's in silent mode because of do not disturb... I should do Vibrate!  ... You may wonder why my alarm would be set for a time inside my do not disturb period.  That's because the only time I use my alarm is when I am getting up at weird ungodly hours for flights, etc. I don't use my alarm for normal waking before work.)\nUnder these circumstances, your alarm clock will not make the horrible buzz before ringing.\nBut again, this is not a happy solution, because it will also have an effect on your phone's RINGER (your ringer will now never vibrate). So, if you never hear your phone when it's ringing in your pocket, the function of the vibrate to remedy that situation is disabled by this method.\n\nA: I believe PlayAwake may be of help to you, it's a Jailbreak app that allows you to set a custom song as an alarm. It lets you choose whether you want vibrate on and off, too! (Only downside is the price, and the fact you have to use your own music in order to have it not vibrate!\n\nA: I have done it as following:\nVibrate on ring - off.\nVibrate on silent - on.\nThen set mode to ring for alarm sounds and set DND time for silencing all other things. It works for me. iOS 8.1.2\n", "Q: \"Battery is not charging\"? When I connect the charger cable to my Macbook pro, sometimes the battery is not charged and I can read near the clock: \"Battery is not charging\".\nIf I unplug and reconnect the cable, it usually starts to charge again. \nEven if the battery is not charging, the mac is not in \"battery mode\" (the charger works): it is just a battery issue.\nthanks\n\nA: That's actually not a bug, but a feature: as the battery ages by charge cycles, your computer won't charge if it's almost full in order to extend the battery's life. By unplugging and replugging the power supply, you force a battery recharge until it's full.\n", "Q: What are the purposes and safety to enable the hidden debug menu in Disk Utility?

What can this be used for?\n\nA: If you need to ask, you probably don't want to mess! ;)\nIt's going to let you see things like the Lion Recovery Partition etc that are normally hidden from use.\nIt's certainly safe to turn the debug menu on.  Whether it's safe to do anything once it is enabled depends very much on your skills.\nBut it can;t hurt to take a look if you are curious, just remember to turn if off if you don't intend to do anything other than poke about.\n\nA: There's really not much you can't do if you already are in the terminal issuing commands.\nIt appears to be mostly for the people that made/maintain the Disk Utility program itself to debug the inner workings of the program than something an end user might need.\ndiskutil list will show the presence or absence of the Recovery HD on systems prior to 10.8.

I'm in the market for a new laptop and so have a few queries. What I'm after is a high res screen (when I say high res I mean I want better than 1280x800) and good battery life. Obviously this tends to point me toward Apple.\nCurrently I have a dell xps and whilst it's powerful, it has a low res (1280x800) and REALLY bad battery life. \nThe main uses for me are general web browsing, visual studio development and really light gaming (football manager, maybe a small amount of terraria and minecraft). \nObviously I'd be looking to install Windows 7 via boot camp to facilitate these things (unless any of those games have mac versions) - but I'll definitely need it for Visual studio.\nI've googled around a bit and I'm getting conflicting information regarding battery life when running windows 7. Does anyone have any sort of idea what you get for just web browsing on the latest macbook pro using windows 7? I listed Visual Studio above and I know development will eat battery but I tend to develop when plugged in as opposed to on the go. \nHow about general use? Are there any quirks or nuances? \nI've never used OSX before so it'll be a learning curve but everyone has to start somewhere! I do already have apple products in the shape of an iPhone and so I know their products tend to be intuitive and simple to use.\nHas anyone ever used visual studio etc on a macbook? What about development with the mac keyboard, good or a nuisance?\nIs there anything I haven't thought of I'd need to consider?\nCheers!\n\nA: I'm going to suggest that for development - as opposed to for gaming - you may want to consider setting up a Windows virtual machine using VMWare Fusion or Parallels Desktop.  Both of these will apparently let you run them from a Bootcamp Windows partition so that you can boot into Windows for gaming but use a VM for other tasks, all using the same Windows installation.  I have no personal experience with that, as I use a VM exclusively, mostly for Visual Studio as well.\nThe reason is that this will give you Visual Studio on your Mac desktop so that you can run Mac apps for everything else.\nFAIR WARNING!  If you start using a Mac, you will find Windows increasingly limiting and badly designed compared to OS X.  I'm serious; I much prefer working in MacOS now, even though I spend most of my day in Win7.  \n\nA: You raised a lot of points that aren't necessarily a single question, so I will try my best to answer a few and ignore the ones I have no good advice on...\nFirstly Games - I run an 11\" Air which is the slowest machine you can buy from Apple.  I play Minecraft on it, but because it's Java and thus interpreted it can get a little slow.  On average gaming on Mac will be slower than Windows on the same hardware, usually because games in Direct X generally take advantage of your hardware far better than the OpenGL equivalent on Mac.  But gaming is possible, I played Portal 2 all the way through and though it blew the fans it was perfectly acceptable.\nSecond battery - hard to quantify, the received wisdom is that you won't quite get the same battery when running Win as when running Mac OS X, the thought being that Win is generally a little more resource intensive when idling etc.  I should't imagine vast changes, and to be fair a comparison is hard to make because you won't be running the same software.  Visual Studio v X Code, who's to say whether one is more efficient from a resource perspective than another.  Down to usage, I imagine, and most people will get different results.  With general browsing and such I would expect broadly comparable results for a straight run from full to flat, but would expect the Mac to kill Windows for extended sleep performance.\nLastly, Development - If you type # a lot, be prepared for having to hunt for it as there isn't a key for it... ALT-3 will give you the hash - can be irritating when I use it with shell programming for comments etc, so depending on your language and if you use it or not it may irritate.  Likewise the lack of a separate \"delete\" key in addition to backspace.  CRTL-Backspace gives you delete, which on a laptop is doubly irritating as CRTL isn't the corner key (FN is), which makes it hard for me to hit when touch typing.  Of course you can get an external keyboard which fixes the latter problem, which is exactly what I did.\nOS X is surprisingly simple, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's not complex if you want to get into it.  Features like Applescript, Automator combined with the Unix shell underpinnings make it very powerful should you choose to look for it.  It had a few stupid things like only resizing windows from 1 corner until Lion was released that I always thought would never change and thankfully have.  I was in your situation, I bought a Macbook for the machine, thinking I would bootcamp into Windows and just play with OS X now and then.  Within 3 months I was down to a single windows program, and these days I don't have a bootcamp partition at all.\n\nA: Somethings that annoy me greatly about developing on Mac hardware in a windows environment. Though mostly via RDP.\n\n\n*\n\n*No (easily accessible) # Key \n\n*Ctrl = command and command = Ctrl but in\nthe weirdest possible ways.\n\n*Home/End behave weirdly\n\n\nI'd second stuffe's opinion on using an external PC keyboard if you are trying to do development.\nI have run Server 2008 R2 as my primary OS on a 13\" inch macbook pro for around 3 months. Noticed no real difference in battery life so I'd imagine that you'd be fine with windows 7, if not better since its a 'desktop' OS.\nThat being said, I do personally believe if you aren't intending to use OS X as your primary OS then you should probably not buy a mac.\n", "Q: How to fix usbmuxd spam in console when iPhone is connected? Since I've upgraded from Snow Leopard to Lion (including the latest 10.7.1 update), my usbmuxd seems awfully chatty.

Yes, I've already repaired permissions.\n\nA: The spam arrived with a recent update to iTunes.  It happens in both Snow Leopard and Lion.  Short of downgrading iTunes versions until the messages go away, there's probably nothing you can do about it.\nAn update:\nThe usbmuxd spam only happens when you have a device (iPhone, etc) plugged in and listed in iTunes under 'DEVICES'.  One obvious workaround is to leave your devices unplugged.  A more useful workaround is to just eject them in iTunes – the spam will stop and your devices will continue to charge.\n\nA: This has been resolved in iTunes 10.5 (141). No more usbmuxd spam since upgrading.\n", "Q: How to keep a VPN connection alive on an iPhone? I connect to a bunch of WiFi hot spots with my iPhone, and love that I have a VPN option. \nOne thing I don't love is that it disconnects from the VPN if the screen ever goes blank. \nHow can I keep the VPN connected so I don't have random emails or other data in the open for man-in-the-middle attacks?\n\nA: According to this thread this is standard for most users. But there is Jailbreak solution with external app called Insomnia\n\nInsomnia is an iPhone native application that, when enabled, will prevent the iPhone from sleeping, thus overriding its default behavior. This allows background applications to continue to run and WiFi to work long after the screen has been switched off.\n(The iPhone's default behavior is to sleep 30 seconds after the screen has gone off, when not docked and charging that is).\n\nDownside of this is your cpu etc is still running so battery will go down quickly.\nThere is also a tweak for Cisco VPN with SBSetting with Jailbreak that might work for non-Cisco software (as in the built-in VPN) but as I haven't tested it it's hard to say :-) It may be that the blog mentions the built-in VPN but I can't verify it myself. It's not clear whether it mentions Cisco app or the built-in VPN (and just names it Cisco VPN).\n\nA: \"VPN-on-Demand\" only works with one VPN protocol - IKEv2.\n\"VPN-on-Demand\" is the only option to keep VPN \"always on\" for iOS.\nYour VPN providers should offer IKEv2, and if they offer something else like OpenVPN - you won't get this \"always on\" option.\nAlso, IKEv2 is the only protocol that seamlessly continues to work when you switch from cellular network to wi-fi. Other VPN protocols will drop the VPN connection or endlessly will try to reconnect to the old network leaving you without internet.\n\nA: One workaround: on a jailbroken device, use Activator to link \"Lock Device\" or \"Unlock Device\" to \"Toggle VPN\".  Everytime I unlock it, it reconnects to my VPN :) so now I am happy\n\nA: I have just signed up for VPN service this week and i have been having the same problem. I use it to go on Netflix and Pandora from out of the country. I have been playing around to see if i can get the VPN to stay connected. So far, I found a solution that has been working for about an hour or so now. \nI have a jailbroken iPhone 4 and i have installed Backgrounder from the Cydia store, which keeps programs running even when closed or when the screen is off. \nAfter installing this, I installed Pandora from the App Store and after launching it, I held down the Home button to background it.\nSo far, it seems to be working because Pandora uses my connection and if i keep it in the background, it will prevent the VPN from disconnecting. \nI have only been using it for a couple of hours, so I'm not sure how good of a permanent solution it will be.\n\nA: You need to use \"supervised mode\" on iphone to get permanent VPN.\nVery unpleasent as requires MAC to back up your iphone (setup will clear it completely). Look for \"supervised mode\" in Apple help pages. Basically it is like a corporate model where you control some settings from your computer.\n", "Q: Macbook financing - resale I am potentially going to be buying a MacBook on finance from Apple. As it's my first Mac, I'm not 100% certain it'll be for me and so might re-sell it in the unlikely event it isn't.\nIf it isn't, am I able to just sell it on or is re-sale not allowed as long as I am still paying Apple? \nIf I can, am I allowed to use the money I get from the re-sale to re-pay a larger amount off my finance agreement? (E.g., if my finance agreement is for £80 per month and I sell it for £1500, can I say to apple \"instead of taking £80 this month take £1500 to pay more off\", thus shortening the agreement?)\nEdit\nJust spoke to Apple, for anyone else searching for this answer you can pay the finance agreement off early if you do have the funds available.\n\nA: I think once you finance it, it's yours and you are just paying off a loan to the finance company.

I like ONYX (http://bit.ly/eCzYfj) for doing this, but there are plenty of other options that do the same thing.\n\n*Make sure you have at least 20% free disk space. If not, try clean up and free some space.\n\n*If things are still slow, try creating a new user account and logging in with that. If that account runs much better you still have some cleanup to do.\n\n*Check your login items (in system preferences, User & Groups). If there are login items you don't recognize/need try disabling them.\nI would also look into investing in at least a 2MB memory upgrade. Not too expensive and it looks like you could use it.\nGood luck...\n\nA: Man...you are running a lot your computer. I have never run even close to that on my Intel Core 2 Duo.\n1.

It's called Disk Inventory X and it's really great for seeing what takes up the most space on your hard drive.\nAlso take a look at this article. for more info on how to speed up your Mac.\n\nA: It is hard to tell what exactly was the problem with your mac when you took your screenshot, but you give us some very interesting info : \n\n\n*\n\n*With high demanding apps like iTunes (especially when coverflow is used and/or with a huge library) or photoshop, the more RAM you get, the better. I can only advice you to upgrade your RAM to 4GB. Mac OS X also performs better with high amounts of RAM.\n\n*You seem to have too many chrome extensions : my chrome main process consumes 93.3MB RAM with 4 tabs, and each tab consumes about 30MB RAM. Yours uses much more RAM per worker (one worker per tab)\n\n*check your disk space : Mac OS behaves really (really) badly when the system disk is full or soon-to-be. \n\n\nSometimes, creating a new user session improves performances (I assume some old files that should be deleted are never \"cleaned up\" by the system)\nAnd a last thing : the speed of the RAM is very important for the whole computer's performance. So, even with a more powerful CPU and the same amount of RAM, I am not sure that your iMac will be faster than your macbookpro. But unfortunately, you can't use faster RAM without changing the motherboard.\nPS : Sorry for my english...\n\nA: Your page-outs are telling you that you are short on RAM.  Your machine is swapping programs out of memory and onto disk to make up for the lack (enough so that OS X has created 4 GB worth of swap files on your hard drive).\nIf you want to continue running a lot of applications/extensions at the same time, doubling your memory would be a good place to start.\n\nA: Your iMac can handle a maximum of 6GB RAM\n, not just 4GB, if it is the correct rev.

A couple of months ago, I bought an SSD for my MBP. At that time, I remember to have stumbled upon a blog/article suggesting a few options to activate/deactivate. \nI cannot find that page again. What are the things to activate/deactivate? \nPS : for example, I remember desactivating something about spotlight indexation. \nThanks, \nEDIT : (Irrevelant to the question)\nA little feedback about the SSD experience. Well I bought my MBP about a year ago. I work in IT sector and create a quite a lot websites. I had the \"classic\" hdd before it (250go). After a few months, the disk started to make noise. Clicking and ticking. My Mac being absolutely critical, (without it I can't work) I decided to take no risk and to buy an SSD for two reasons : \n\n\n*\n\n*First of all, it's shock resistance. I have to move around a lot and my MBP follows me everywhere. And thus is shaken from time to time. \n\n*Secondly beacause of the performance gain. \n\n\nThere are a few other reasons but they were not really decisive in my case. \n\n\n*\n\n*Such as noise reduction. Working mostly with a headset noise or not, I won't hear it. \n\n*Battery is supposed to last longer since SSD are less power consuming. In my case, I haven't seen any changes about it. It is not lasting longer or running out of power earlier than before. No changes about that. \n\n\nLet's say, SSD is a total change. You can buy a new processor three fo four times faster than the one, you had before, double your ram, chagne your motherboard, do whatever yo want. Nothing is going to provide the same performance boost as an SSD. \nEven now, nearly 8 months later, performance is still present and not impacted by usage. \n\nA: It sounds like you found this blog post. Looks like he changes hibernate to mode 0 (so it doesn't create a sleep image file), mounts the drive in noatime mode. \nA note on TRIM, if you have a sandforce controller in your SSD, like the OWC drives and many (most) of the OCZ drive, it's not recommended to enable TRIM. It can cause instability and these newer controllers are supposed to do  much better cleanup. Intel drives are supposed to benefit quite a bit from TRIM though.\n\nA: The only thing you may want to activate manually is TRIM support. By default, Lion only enables this for the drive models Apple ships themselves. Instructions on how to enable it for any SSD (as long as it does support TRIM) can be found here:\nhttp://www.hardmac.com/news/2011/03/27/the-universal-solution-to-activate-trim\nThere's no reason to disable Spotlight indexation unless you really don't want to use Spotlight at all, in which case you'll gain a tiny bit of disk space and performance. That's not SSD specific though.\nUpdate: Enabling TRIM manually may be counterproductive if your SSD does not correctly implement the command. Check other users experience for your specific SSD model first.\n", "Q: Pages 09 4.0.3 wants an update When I open Pages 09 4.0.3, it tells me I need a software update; yet, running Software Update responds that all software is up to date.\nI believe there is a later version of Pages with improved Lion support (like full page modes).\nI've been to Apple Support pages download section: No dice.\nHow can I get that upgrade?\n\nA: Ensure that the applications reside in /Applications/iWork '09 or the software update process does not seem to find them.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install both Xcode 3 and 4 side-by-side, alternate use either one or the other  I've got a handle on how to install Xcode 3 and 4 on the same machine (running OS X < 10.7), so I'm looking more how to manage this environment.\nRather: is it possible to enter some shell command to \"point\" to the Xcode version you would like to use for a certain task?\nFor example, some packages in Homebrew seem to have issues with Xcode 4 compilers (multiple -arch flags not supported any longer etc.). So, when I want to brew install something, I would like to use the old Xcode 3 gcc suite. But when doing actual Cocoa development, I  would rather like to use Xcode 4.\nRVM also does a nice job of managing work in multiple environments. I think, newer Linux distributions offer a tool called update-alternatives to achieve such a goal. Just to give you more of an idea of what I am talking about.\nSimilar to running both simultaneously except I'm looking to use them sequentially.\n\nA: I believe you can only have one version of the command-line tools installed at the same time, and I believe it says this during the installation process, so you won't really be able to switch between them.\n", "Q: Is it possible to configure Safari's search box to use google.co.uk rather than google.com? Is it possible to customise the search engines used by Safari 5.1 on Snow Leopard? I'd like to get it to use google.co.uk rather than google.com for searches. I've found a couple of old posts (including this one which doesn't seem to apply any more) but nothing very recent.\n\nA: the query string is defined in : \n~/Library/Safari/Configurations.plist.signed\n\nbut the file is signed and cannot be edited without being replaced by safari.\nAlso, it seems that every time you use this search bar, Safari hits This file on apple.com which can make one assume that Safari compares the 2 files and replaces the local one when needed.\nI think your only options are via extensions or another browser\n\nA: I don't use it, but GLIMS looks like it will easily let you insert a search engine different than what Safari bundles.\nMore intrusive, but way slick in my opinion is the SafariOmnibar it's excellent work and you can customize your search provider since it's hacked into that part of safari using SIMBL - the SIMple Bundle Loader process.\nI use LaunchBar and search from a keyboard shortcut - it allows extensive control over searching - you can define custom search sites and criteria easily. It has many other features (notable extremely quick app and file launching as well as a clipboard history) but it's so fast you might like it just for getting a UK search if nothing else fits your needs.\n\nA: As an update to my own question, I have just come across this Safari extension which redirects searches from google.com to google.co.uk. It also redirects Yahoo searches from search.yahoo.com to uk.search.yahoo.com.\n\nA: As of Safari 6, there is now an \"omnibar\" instead of separate search and address bars. This breaks a lot of previous extensions and plugins, but the updates to the extension API for Safari 6 actually make it much easier to make an extension allows you to use a custom search engine within the new omnibar.\nI put together a really simple one here: AnySearch.\n", "Q: Can a Macbook Pro or Macbook Air run Windows 7 perfectly -- fully 100% with all software and drivers? I heard that some people buy a Mac and use Bootcamp to set up a dual boot so that it can run OS X and Windows 7 and some people buy it to only run Windows 7 just because Mac computer is high quality.  But when a Macbook Pro or Macbook Air (or iMac / Mac Mini) runs Windows 7, can it run everything well?  For example, can the USB Flash drive all be used well?  Can all USB devices be used on it as if it is just a PC?   Can the Mini Display Port / Thunderbolt converter to HDMI work nicely?  What about the hardware drivers -- for the built in webcam, microphone, DVD writer -- can all devices on a Mac be used with Windows 7's drivers with no problem?\nI think some people run Windows 7 as a virtual machine on the Mac, but there might be issue if you need to access some hardware, or forward some port through the Firewall, and there are also some programs that specifically detects that it is a virtual PC and not run on it.  Probably those program can run if it is Windows 7 on a Mac.\n\nA: Since it's an intel chipset on the logic boards and Apple is on the hook officially to provide driver support for Windows 7 - the only possible drawback might be the keyboard layout and Thunderbolt. It's quite new, so I don't have any real great feeling for how well that works under Windows 7.\nEven in Mac OS X - thunderbolt doesn't have any direct networking support - just video, storage and target mode at present. Intel and Apple are working together on Thunderbolt and the active cables mean that even if PC decide to implement an optical interface rather than copper - you might not be left out if you need a PC Thunderbolt accessory 6 or 9 months down the road. My crystal ball works so poorly for Apple - I'd hate to try to guess what PC vendors are going to do even if they aren't as notoriously secretive as Apple.\nI would have no hesitation to run Windows 7 in emulation - the virtualization is so robust now - you can choose to have unfiltered net access, share an IP, virtualize a router. You can always fall back to BootCamp if needed, but I wouldn't worry about that unless you have specific credible advice from someone that knows your exact workload and style of how much control you need. With minimal learning, you should have VMware or Parallels doing exactly what you desire.\n\nA: As bmike mentioned the MacBook Pro is rated highly when used to run Windows on Bootcamp.\n\n\n*\n\n*USB flash drives will work fine\n\n*USB devices will work as if you were using a PC\n\n*I'm not 100% confident  on the Mini Display Port to HDMI as it seems support has been flaky for Mac OSX for the last few updates\n\n\nAs far as the built in hardware Bootcamp includes windows drivers for these, however the trackpad will not register more than two finger presses so you can forget about 3+ finger multi-touch gestures. Also there are no Windows drivers for Thunderbolt. Other than that I don't think you should be afraid of missing out on any functionality by running Windows on a MacBook Pro.\n", "Q: Why is this bar appearing in Safari? Sometimes, when I try using a special character (⌥+U for ¨) a strange bar will appear at the bottom of my screen. This doesn't happen every time, just on and off for no apparent reason. I haven't changed any Safari settings or preferences since upgrading to Lion, and I'm using Safari 5.1.\n\nCould anyone explain what this is and why it's appearing when I try using my special characters?\n\nA: That looks like the front-end processor window for some non-Roman scripts. This gets pretty far into the weeds if you don't normally use them, but in case you're curious:\nWith a writing system like Japanese, you type using English characters to produce phonetic Japanese characters, and then convert those into ideograms. For the most part, this happens \"inline\", that is, right where the cursor is, wherever you'd be typing if you were typing in English. Back in the old days, however, it happened in a separate window (the FEP window), and once you had a chunk of text composed in that, you'd send it to the main window.\nI use Japanese on my system. The FEP window still exists, and every once in a while it will pop up for a second—then the system seems to get its composure back and I go back to inline typing. I'm guessing that you're trying to produce a character that involves multiple keystrokes, like ü, and somehow that's invoking the FEP window. I can't say why it's happening or how to stop it, but in my experience it is harmless.\n\nA: Is this the result of an extension you have installed in Safari? Try disabling all extensions and re-enabling one at a time and see if you can recreate the phenomenon.\n", "Q: How can I route two audio sources simultaneously as inputs to Skype?

Nothing unusual.  Until an hour or so later, out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a zooming shiny apple animation, picked it up and was prompted to \"Set up my iPhone\".  Ugh.  I haven't backed it up for 10 days or so and there's stuff on there I really want to keep.  So I went through the setup, enabling location, selecting my router, and then trying to activate the phone, all the while hoping once completed everything would be just as I'd left it, right as rain.  But I can't get past the activation stage.  And when I opt to activate through iTunes, iTunes complains that the iPhone's software is too old.  At this point I should mention I'm a registered developer, and my iPhone was running iOS 5 beta 3.\nWhen plugged into iTunes it displays 8.7 GB of space taken, all marked as \"Other\", and it's still on build version 9A5259f, i.e. beta 3.  So I'm reasonably optimistic my precious data's still on there.  But I can't use it to see.  And when I try to back it up now, nothing happens.\nI'm guessing this could be because beta 3's expired?  Maybe?  I didn't get around to updating it because for some reason over the air updates wouldn't work.  Any advice on what my next move should be would be very greatly appreciated!\n\nA: After 14 hours of research and experimentation I recovered everything.  Here's how:\n\nI used iPhone Explorer to back up all of my photos.\nI jailbroke with redsn0w.\nExplored the filesystem with iPhone Explorer, and tried to copy the\n  whole root filesystem (which, for some unknown reason, silently missed\n  quite a few files, but oh well).\nSaw that both sms.db and all my application data were still intact. \n  Danced with joy.\nRemoved the ReleaseType -> Beta key in\n  /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist\nRestarted it, set it up as a \"new\" iPhone, and all my sms, apps, etc\n  were still there.  Hurrah.\nSet my PC's date to a week ago.\nI then backed up in iTunes, and restored to the latest beta.\nPhotos, notes, sms were back on there, apps were all deleted but app\n  data remains, so it's just a matter of re-downloading the apps.\n\nI love a happy ending :)\n\nA: I had a similar problem with beta 5. Updating to beta 6 brought all my stuff back. \n\nA: My next move would be to get a free trial of PhoneView and see what is still recoverable. If no Mac OS X machines are handy, the PhoneView FAQ has a windows recommendation for that OS.\nEven when iTunes/Xcode feels the device needs a restore - the phone log, contacts, and all sorts of data may very well still be recoverable.\nYou don't have to pay for the software until you're sure you can get some of the data off. I believe it's a 10 item limit - but do check it out.\nI've had non beta iOS devices up and crash like this - just par for the course with flash memory and software. Sometimes it just takes a big digger.\n", "Q: Can't find coda plist I can't seem to find my Coda plist.

Here's my first question:\nIn Lion, if you turn on Filevault, you can no longer modify the System Preferences/Security & Privacy/Require password... after sleep or screensaver.  The value is forced to 'immediately' and changes are not saved.  If you haven't turned on Filevault, this setting acts as expected.\nHas anyone found a workaround?\nIt's not a security feature, in that you can set the screensaver not to come on for hours (or never), but it sure is annoying for those folks who reach over and wiggle the mouse when the screensaver comes on.\nA postscript:  my workaround is to change the setting and never close System Preferences.  Dumb, but it works.\n\nA: Upgrade to Mac OS X 10.7.2 or higher for the Security and Privacy setting \"Require password time period after sleep or screen saver begins\" to be respected after FileVault is enabled (though I don't see anything about this fix on the download page).  There is no longer a need to keep System Preferences open forever (what a silly but effective fix) or any of the other workarounds.\n\nA: I haven't been able to test it on Lion, but this works fine on Snow Leopard for disabling the password requirement on screensaver: defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver askForPassword -int 0\n\nA: You can force System Preferences to quit. It doesn't get a chance to reset the the wait before dying.\nYou can see the current value with: defaults read com.apple.screensaver. Mine now looks like this:\n{\n    askForPassword = 1;\n    askForPasswordDelay = 3600;\n    tokenRemovalAction = 0;\n}\n\nThis also worked for setting the value without the hack of forcing system prefs to quit: defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver askForPasswordDelay -int 3600 and I'd imagine the suggestion to set askForPassword would work too.\n", "Q: Is it possible to make Mail require a password on startup? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs there a way to password protect individual apps? \n\nI want to know if I can make Mail require a password to actually do anything, see messages, etc. so no one can just go into my Mail and send messages or see my received messages. \n\nA: To keep email secure in an unsecured account, webmail may be a good option to use instead of Mail.app, which isn't designed to be secured separately from the account it's being used in.\n\nA: I didn't try it myself, but you could set \"Keep copies of messages for offline viewing\" to \"Don't keep copies of any messages\" (see screenshot) so you don't have copies of your messages sticking around.

And how can I fix this issue?\n\nA: In my experience, when this happens it's usually down to the fact that the download process failed (for whatever reason) and iOS will not allow you to recommence the download or try starting it again from scratch. It's not so much to do with a software imposed download limitation. \nThere's only a limit over 3G (20MB) and a general limit on app sizes (2GB).\nThe only thing I can suggest is trying to delete the app from the home screen and restarting the download (although I'm doubtful this will work).\nOtherwise, you will have to connect to iTunes and install as it suggests.

Here is a screenshot of my setup on my 13\" MacBook Pro as it looks at the end of the process:\n\nAs you can see, I have my internal 500GB hard drive partitioned the following way:\n\n*\n\n*120GB OS X Lion (system and apps)\n\n*316GB workspace partition (user files, projects)\n\n*64GB Bootcamp Windows 7 Ultimate\n\nTo make this work, I started with the standard procedure of installing OS X Lion on a single Mac OS Extended journaled (HFSJ) partition. Next I used  Bootcamp Assistant to build the Bootcamp partition for Windows.\nThen I did two key things:\n\n*\n\n*Before installing Windows on the Bootcamp partition, I first went back to Disk Utility, shrunk the OS X Lion partition, and inserted a 3rd partition Workspace_HD for all my user files. Then I restarted and installed Windows 7.\n\n\n*After Win 7 Ultimate, the Bootcamp drivers and Office 2010 are installed and activated, I did not make any changes to any partitions. I can put whatever I want on any partition, but any effort to shrink, resize, delete, create, or modify any partition results in failure.\nAny change to the partition tables after Windows is installed breaks the Bootcamp partition.\nI went thru 3 broken installs of Bootcamp/Win7 to figure this out.\n\nAgain, the key to this working is creating your extra partitions\nAFTER you make the Bootcamp partition but BEFORE you install\nWindows.\n\nI will rebuild my system for a 5th time to fully document the process with screenshots, but this time with 5 partitions: OS X Lion startup, Workspace, custom 20GB OS X Lion recovery partition, 30GB FAT32 shared Mac/Win data partition, and a Bootcamp partition with Windows 7 Ultimate.\nUntil then, here is a quick step by step of what I did:\n\n*\n\n*Install OS X Lion on a single partition hard drive.\n\n*Run Bootcamp Assistant.\n\n*Download drivers for Mac and burn to CD.\n\n*Make 60GB Bootcamp partition for Windows.\n\n*When prompted for install disc, STOP installation and quit Bootcamp.\n\n*Launch Disk Utility. Look at the 2 partitions.\n\n*Shrink Mac OS X partition to 100GB.\n\n*Click on + to create a 3rd partition in free space.\n\n*Split that partition into however many other partitions you want.\n\n*Quit Disk Utility.\n\n*Insert Windows 7 installer DVD and restart Mac.\n\n*After the startup chime, hold down OPTION key.\n\n*Wait a while until the Windows 7 DVD appears and select it.\n\n*Mac should start up from DVD. Start installing Windows 7.\n\n*Continue until finished. DO NOT connect to internet.\n\n*Load Bootcamp drivers CD that you burned and install.\n\n*When finished, restart and log into Windows 7.\n\n*Continue installing your applications. Do activations.\n\n*When finished, restart, holding down the OPTION key.\n\n*You should now see your OS X Lion and Win 7 partitions.\n\nOK, hope this works for you!! Good Luck!! ;-)\n\nA: I managed to get everything works like the way I want:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lion, Windows 7, and two shared partition (don't ask why I need two,\nI do need two) \n\n*Lion recovery partition is intact\n\n*Factory-installed Lion is intact\n\n\nThe key of my success is moving my Boot Camp partition to the first position, as shown in this image: \n\nWhen I say moving, there's no such a tool or way to move partition. I have to recreate all partitions without having to actually clean the HD and remove factory-setting Lion. As I use MBP retina, and reading from several references that Lion installer on the Mac App Store is not compatible with MBP retina, I don't want to lose it.\nThe steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Split the default Macintosh HD partition into two. Resize the first\none to 120GB. This will be a Boot Camp partition later.  \n\n*Split the second partitions into three more partitions like the image. All\npartitions are in HFS+ format. The last partition is to be Macintosh\nHD (Lion boot partition) later.  \n\n*Restart MBP and reboot using Recovery partition (Cmd+R).  \n\n*After recovery partition is booted up, I open Disk Utility. Clone the first partition to the last partition. Just googling how to do that (eg this answer will help). Now I have two Lion partitions. Luckily, this step will create two Recovery partitions.\n\n*Exit recovery mode and reboot using the just created (cloning\nresult) Macintosh HD to make sure everything is OK.  \n\n*After everything is exactly like before, I reboot again using Recovery by pressing Option key, then select the second Recovery, not the first one.  \n\n*After recovery booted up, I open Disk Utility and remove the first partition. Then create Boot Camp partition out of it, and format it using ExtFAT so that later Windows can be installed here (need to reformat later to NTFS). This step will also remove original Lion Recover Partition.\n\n\nAnd that's it. Then I install Windows 7 on the first partition using USB key (since MBP Retina doesn't have DVD drive). After Windows installation finish, install Boot Camp drivers, and Windows recognizes the two shared partitions above.\nSince all steps are done in MBP retina with flash storage, and it's super fast, all steps only take about one hour. But I do need some time to think about the solutions.\nWe do have choice!\nHope it helps. \n\nA: I've tried twice five times: \n(as suggested by bmike, I've moved my failed attempts into a separate answer)\nAttempt 1: Using Boot Camp assistant, resize OSX partition to 50Gb, Bootcamp to 200Gb, install windows. In Windows, Shrink C:, attempt to add new partition but got scared by a Windows warning message about having to convert the disk to a dynamic disk and becoming unbootable to other OSes. Aborted.\nAttempt 2: Delete Bootcamp partition, starting all over again. Using Boot Camp assistant, resize OSX partition to 200Gb, Bootcamp to 50Gb, install windows. Then in OSX, use Disk Utility to shrink OSX partition to 50Gb and create a new 150Gb shared partition (exFat). Result: Windows Bootcamp partition is still visible but I can't boot it up (ie it's missing from the OS boot menu).\nAttempt 3: Same as Attempt 2 but using Fat instead of exFat. No difference.\nAttempt 4: During step 1, Boot Camp formats my USB stick so that I can boot off it and install Windows. So in my Mac, I fiddled with my partitions until they are how I want them:\n\nI can see and use the DATA partition on the Mac. So then I booted off my USB stick and installed Windows to the Bootcamp partition. So far so good.\nBut when I boot into Windows, the Data partition is not visible. If I go into Disk Management, the space is marked \"Unallocated\". If I try to create a partition, I get a warning saying that Windows will convert the disk into a dynamic disk, so I'm too scared to proceed and wipe out Mac OS.\n\nWindows is showing a few more partitions than the Mac does. The first 200Mb is the \"GPT Protective Partition\", and I think the 620Mb one is the Lion recovery partition.\nPerhaps the only way to do this is to delete the Lion Recovery partition. If I convert the disk to a dynamic disk will OSX be able to boot it? Why does Windows think my shared partition is unallocated but OSX sees it as a FAT partition and can write to it?\nAttempt 5:\nI followed Thomas Jespersen's instructions below and started again, this time deleting the Lion Recovery partition during Windows startup, and I also followed the instructions here to prevent the creating of a 100Mb windows recovery partition. http://www.mydigitallife.info/hack-to-remove-100-mb-system-reserved-partition-when-installing-windows-7/\nSo now in Windows Disk Manager everything is looking fine. 4 partitions all the sizes I want them.\n200 Mb GPT partition\n50Gb OSX\n50Gb Windows\n150Gb Shared partition\nBut alas over in OSX I can't see my shared Windows partition. In OSX Disk Utility the partition is greyed out and if I click Verify Disk I get \"Invalid BS_impBoot in boot bloc\". The only option that Disk Utility gives me is to Repair Disk. I get the feeling that if I click Repair Disk it will restore the Mac Recovery partition and undo everything.\nUpdate: I tried clicking Repair Disk and sure enough it wiped out my Windows partitions. I give up. I'm going to allocate 200Gb to Windows and store my media there.\nAttempt 6: Followed HuzZz's instructions and it worked. Yay!\n\nA: Easy. Don't be afraid of the long answer.\nUse BoottCamp to create a 50GB Lion and a 200GB Windows partition. Because Mac has a 200MB utility partition you will see the following when installing Windows:\n200 MB Mac Utility\n50Gb Lion MAC OSX\n600 MB (Wierd partition created by bootcamp)\n200 GB Windows BootCamp partition\nThese are all primary partitions, and because you can only have 4 primary partitions you may think you are stocked.\nBut ... When installing Windows, just delete partition 3 and 4 and create a new 50GB partition for Windows an leave 150GB free space.\nAfter Windows is installed create a D drive with the 150 GB free space.\n: Thomas\nPS: Because you already did it wrong, you can try and use the Schrink partition in Windows to 50 GB but you still need to delete the weird 600 MB partition... Otherwise Windows will convert the disk to a dynamic disk (to get over the 4 primary partition limitation)... And then you can't start OSX. When you delete the weird partition you may get problems startin Windows because it changed position... U can use bcdedti.exe in a repair prompt. I guess this is not a problem on Windows 7 (not sure). This will give you 600 MB waste... but you save a reinstall.\nPPS: 50GB is NOT enough for Windows and Visual Studio. When you update Windows old files are not deleted, and system restore grows and grows. Give it at least 60-80GB... you will thank me later. Starting with Win7SP1 disk wil help a bit.\n\nA: I recommend creating a ExFat partition which can be read and written on by both, Win and Mac\nRegarding your criticism: just as Mac OS is limited to reading on the recently common Windows file systems, this problem also exists in the other direction. Win can only read from Mac OS Extended. \nSo blame either of the players or none\n\nA: Ok, this is written for a 500GB HDD.\n4 partitions max, just like every other (bootable) hard-drive.\nI tried this on 2 MacBook Pros and it works perfectly on both.\nThis tutorial also assumes you have OS X Lion installed.\nWhat I want to achieve is to have OS X Lion & Windows 7 installed, with a shared space too.\n\n\n*\n\n*120 (OSX)\n\n*260 (SHARED)\n\n*120 (Windows)\n------------Part 1/2------------\nStart off by resizing Mac OS X Partition so it's at least 1GB smaller than the full disk.\nTo do this; go into Utilities and then into Disk Utility.

You need to insert the Windows 7 disk and then proceed with the installation before the Bootcamp partition will be created.

That's what I'm using for now.\nWhilst FAT doesn't allow for any single files over 4096MB; it's also writable natively with both OS's.\nIt should be 260GB.

Tragically you'll have to leave that unallocated.\nFormat the BOOTCAMP partition (only) and proceed to install Windows.\nDon't mess about with deleting and merging partitions, otherwise the partition tables will be damaged.\n------------DONE------------\n\nA: Have you tried setting up your partitions first? That would be my suggestion.\nUse the OS X install disk to partition your disk how you like. You can access disk Utility from an installer screen by selecting it from the Utilities menu. Then install OS X, then use boot camp to install Windows on the other partition.\nAs you've seen, resizing partitions once there's an OS installed can be tricky for a variety of reasons. To avoid this, just don't install anything until you've got your partitions correct.\n\nA: If memory serves me, the bootloader doesn't not allow for multiple partitions.  Using rEFIt should allow you to do get around this restriction.\n", "Q: How to force iOS apps to use global proxy settings Most stock apps will use the proxy settings, but apps from the App Store rarely use the proxy settings given under Settings > Wifi. I am told that the proxy API must be called explicitly, but is there a way, perhaps a jailbreak app, that will force all connections to go through the proxy? I currently have the option of using either a .PAC config file or typing out the http proxy of my university manually and providing authentication details.\n\nA: I was able to proxy URL requests from 4 apps I just tested (Instagram, App Store, Omni Focus, Bookmarks). I used a manual proxy configuration and Charles to test.\nI'm not sure what proxy API you're talking about. From personal experience, I know that any app using an NSURLConnection to make the request will go through the proxy as defined by the system.

I recently purchased a 120GB SSD that will replace my optical drive in my MBP. It also has a 500GB 7200RPM hard drive.\nIs it possible to have a single logical volume that uses both physical disks in Lion. If so, would I be able to still specify that the OS and Applications be installed on the SSD while all other large files reside on the HDD, and how would I do it?\n\nA: You certainly can make two or more physical drives into one volume that the OS sees. It's referred to as a concatenated disk set - and Disk Utility will erase both drives in preparation for a RAID - you can choose an actual RAID stripe or simple concatenation.\nSince Macs won't boot from a RAID volume without some additional hardware or extra software ( to handle the added complexity that RAID entails ), you won't be able to use this for your boot volume. \nEven if you could, I wouldn't advise doing this since the OS decides where to store files inside any volume. If your goal is to control what files go to the SSD and which to the HDD - this doesn't get you any closer to that goal. \nThe good news is there is an excellent \"Plan B\" for you\n\nThe best writing I have seen recently on how to both think about using a SSD with a HDD that also covers how exactly to implement a split was written recently by Matt Legend Gemmell - He really knows his stuff in general and his article titled Using OS X with an SSD plus HDD setup is great reading.\nMatt advocates \n\n\n*\n\n*installing the OS and most user data on the SSD \n\n*place user data that won't fit on the SSD instead on the HDD\n\n*implementing this by moving entire top level folders from the SSD home folder and placing them on the HDD. \n\n*using soft (sym) links to connect the two locations.\n\n\nI hope that gives you a better solution to what I see as the major thrust to your question. You might also look at using Aliases (OS X Finder's enhanced version of a sym link that points at unique characteristics of the file as well as the path in case either gets moved and the system can figure out (re-link) to the correct/new location of the file.)\n\nA: As a side note, I had the same set up, and I was a little annoyed that I couldn't put my MBP into hibernation any more. The apparent reason was that the system disk (the SSD) was attached to the SATA port which was originally used for the optical drive. After swapping the disks (SSD on the primary SATA port, HDD on the secondary), hibernation worked again.\nSo, if you want to be able to hibernate, put the SSD into the primary port and replace the optical drive with the HDD.\n\nA: You would mount a certain subdirectory (eg. /Users) on the other disk. Check out http://lnx2mac.blogspot.com/2010/09/moving-os-x-users-to-separate-partition.html for detailed instructions.\nSince you are manipulating the FS, make a backup first!\n\nA: I don't see why a concatenated configuration via Disk Utility wouldn't boot (I also don't see why an Apple RAID card controlled configuration wouldn't boot). I have successfully configured a concatenated boot volume using a Mac Pro via the OS X Disk Utility (however, none of those disks were solid state) \nOtherwise, Plan B as mentioned before sounds best. In regards to symbolic links (which I only just read about), have Mac OS refer to your user's folder on the larger volume (the hdd) via System Preferences > Accounts > Advanced. Afterward, create a symlink for what would be the \"user/library\" folder, taking advantage of performance on an SSD while making good use of capacity on an HDD. \n", "Q: What iOS games use multi-touch in an innovative way?

It seems that after disabling Filevault 1 in OS X Lion, there no longer is an option to choose between Filevault 1 and Filevault 2 functionality.\nI actually prefer Filevault 1 over Filevault 2, since it does not interfere with my theft protection software and allows me to use a guest account.\nIs there a way to enable Filevault 1 again?\n\nA: Even if the creation tools are gone or hidden very well from us, you point out Lion is happy to keep running a user that has been migrated in so you can take advantage of that to get what you had back again.\nLion makes it several steps with some minor \"complications\" - but you should be able to Migrate another user shell in and move your current data into that older style account.\n\n\n*\n\n*It's slightly tricky to juggle the users - you'll want a backup and need to set up a second admin account to do the move. You'll delete the user, but not the files and import the old user (clear the old data) and finally move the new data into place using the old storage mechanism.\n\n*You'll need one of\n\n*\n\n*a running Snow Leopard system or boot disk (to make and then migrate a FileVault 1 user)\n\n*a backup of the system from Snow Leopard days (even if the user data is wrong - you just need the account settings and shell sparse bundle to migrate in again)\n\n\n\nI keep an external USB drive with 15G partitions around with the last OS but no real user data. You could install Snow Leopard onto an external disk or partition and make shell user with FileVault 1 enabled or you could use any backup from your Snow Leopard time to move in another copy of your user with FV1 - and simply move the current contents into the old encrypted sparse bundle storage. \nLet's start a new question if you want advice HOW to actually do this (since it will depend on your specifics) - this question stands well just with the simple fact that the built in tool to do this isn't available on Lion.\n\nA: Actually it is possible. I did it using a Time Machine backup, but I think it's possible starting from a freshly created user home dir.\nIn brief: you must create a sparsebundle, move the home dir in and enable it as the user home directory at login.\nThis involves using command line and an administrator account to change the home directory.\n\nA: There is not. FileVault 2 whole-disk encryption has replaced FileVault 1 in 10.7 - you won't be able to choose when turning it in. A user account using FileVault 1 encryption will continue to be able to do so.

Can I use an external hard disk for dual boot? I'd like to setup a dual boot onto my MacBookAir 128GB, with Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate in BootCamp. However, I'm already close to the 128GB limit (games + CS suite + Eclipse + XCode + a lot of Web development tools). \nTherefore, it would be ideal for me if I could use the same HDD I will run my Time Machine saves on... when it's finally delivered!\nThe question is therefore: is it reasonnable to create a dual partition on that and run Windows 7 from the first one?\nWould MacBook Air tolerate launching Windows 7 from an external disk?\nIs there a risk (save for USB deconnection) that HDD might not be a working solution, as in too much lag? Could (eventually) a Thunderbolt external SSD be an acceptable workaround?\n\nA: The limitations of Lion BootCamp are a bit buried for my tastes. If you start the BootCamp Assistant and print out the Installation Guide - it has all the restrictions listed half way down step 2, page 5. \nIn a nutshell, BootCamp won't work with any external disk - it has to be the first internal drive at the time the installer runs - so you can remove others beforehand if you want say install BootCamp partition on the third drive on a Mac Pro.\n\nA: Since you must boot Windows 7 from the internal SSD, and since you also want to run Mac OS X from the same volume, I recommend that you concentrate on cleaning out your existing Mac OS X system and freeing up as much disk space as possible.\nYou should research on how to make the smallest Windows installation possible, so you can create the smallest BootCamp partition possible. From what I can see, you could do with as little as 12GB if you are meticulous. \nFor instance, once Windows is installed, you can permanently disable hyberfil.sys and reduce or limit the size of pagefile.sys, and this will save you many GB.\nI would also look into the differences between the size of the installation in Windows 7 32-bit versus 64-bit, and see if Windows 7 Ultimate takes up a great deal more space than Windows 7 Professional or Windows 7 Home Premium (I suspect it does). You will want to refrain from installing any features of Windows that you decide you don't need, and you will want to make sure that you don't install any Windows applications that you don't absolutely need.\nHere are some links to discussions I found. I cannot vouch for any of these methods.\nReference One at Tom's Hardware\nReference Two at Microsoft TechNet\nThere is a utility for reducing the size of a Windows installation before you actually install it. It is called vLite. It is not exactly kosher and has its detractors. I have no personal experience with it. To use it, you need a working Windows system to configure a special custom installer DVD that vLite helps you create.\nReference Three, a discussion of the benefits of vLite and how many GB you can save.\nRegardless, you are going to have to wipe the internal drive on your MacBook Air and try different partitioning schemes, so you must have yet another a large external hard drive for making backups of the system you already have. Use Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper!.\nOn the Mac side, there is a lot you can do to reduce the size of your Mac OS X partition by removing components of Lion that you do not need. \nMake a complete backup disk image first before you start deleting things!\nSimilarly, it is possible to permanently delete the Mac OS X sleepimage file, which will save you the same amount of disk space as the amount of RAM that you have. \nInformation about sleepimage file\nSmartSleep utility for controlling the sleepimage file\nDelete the contents of /Library/Printers, which could be several GB, and when you restart your Mac, Lion will prompt you to download only the drivers for the printers you actually use.\nYou should completely remove any applications in iLife that you don't use, including all their support files in the /Library/ folder. iDVD, GarageBand and iPhoto have many GB of support files, themes, templates, and audio files, and if you don't use any one of those programs, you can clean out that disk space.\nUtilities such as MonoLingual can remove more than 1GB from your Mac OS X installation by removing all the files for languages (Spanish, French, German, etc.) that you will not use.\nUse OmniDiskSweeper or WhatSize to examine your Mac OS X installation and look for user documents that you feel safe in archiving and removing, or deleting.\nThere is an analogous freeware tool for Windows called WinDirStat.\n\nA: Performance is going to be miserable on a USB connected drive so you are going to either have to upgrade your internal SSD or spring for a Thunderbolt drive.  Either option is going to cost $400+.\nIf you run your SSD at almost full levels, you are likely to see some slowdowns due to the SSD having to perform more frequent garbage collection.\nI'd read that Boot Camp wants 16GB for a 32-bit install and 20GB for a 64-bit install but my recent (and only) experience was that it would not let me go below 20GB.\nIn addition to Wheat's advice, you can move the iPhoto and iTunes libraries to your external drive.  Also, keep in mind that you really are going to need two external drives as storing data files on your Time Machine disk means that the backup and the orginal are on the same drive.\nA MBP with a hard drive is much better fit to your objectives.  You should give some thought to switching machines.\n\nA: Im looking to do the same, and I may have found an alternative solution.

System files should be protected from deleting and you don't know if other protections are missing or changed.\n\nA: The sqlite version is outdated anyway. I suggest you go over here http://www.sqlite.org/ and download the current client. (Yes Apple is one of the sponsors. they use SQLite a lot for their apps, eg Mail for instance)\nIf you are looking for the framework, that is only included in the base installation. \nHave a look here for a similar problem and solution:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/251647/restore-sqlite3-on-mac-os-x-for-google-chrome\n\nA: Another trick is to extract the file from your installer disc. You can either open the .mpkg and look for the specific installer .pkg and extract the contents wholesale out of the .bom archive\nAn alternative is that you can use a utility like Pacifist to do the job for you.

On my iPhone homescreen there's an app which in an half-downloaded(actually, more like barely downloaded) state -  \n\n(In case you're curious, I was trying to download Rage during it's on-sale-for-free-period) \nNow, I can't get rid of it from my home screen. I can hide it in a folder, I can install the downloaded app next to this \"Loading\" shell having downloaded the app later in iTunes.\niTunes won't let me delete this item from my home screen - the \"x\" overlay for uninstalling an app is not coming up either. \nSo, how can I remove it?\n\nbmike just helped me with some troubleshooting, but we weren't able to get this question fixed, yet. Here's the conversation between the two of us. Would appreciate any other answers.\n\nA: Reboot.\nI had an app stuck in the Loading... state and a reboot of my iPhone cleared it away. I was able to re-download it again without any issues.\nTo reboot your phone hold down the Power button for 5 seconds. You'll see the power off slider appear. Slide it to turn the phone off. Once off, use the Power button to turn it back on.\n\nA: One way is to tap on the app icon once you're connected to a WiFi hotstop. This will start/resume the download. Once the app is being shown as \"loading\", just tap it again to remove from it's limbo state and move to paused state. This will allow you to hit the X when you are in the move/delete mode. \nSadly, a total restore and set up of your device as new will always work at the cost of your time to re-configure all of the sync settings. Unless each app has an export/import or cloud sync ability, you could lose progress or data from other apps, so it's a very broad hammer for a narrow problem.\n\nSeveral other questions here might help, but none seem to be totally equivalent.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I cancel an app installation on the iPhone?\n\n*App stuck while downloading at stage of 2%\n\nA: This is an absolute nightmare when you get it.

There were methods for doing this in earlier versions of Safari but I don't know of one that works with 5.1.\nThe reason I want to do this is that it takes up a great deal of disk space, and I suspect it slows things down on my older, slower Mac running Lion because of all the extra caching going on. I never use the feature anyway.\nHere is the link to an earlier question on Ask Different with regard to Safari 5.0.\nHow can I disable \"Top Sites\" in Safari/Webkit completely?\nI am creating a new question because apparently any methods that would work for Safari 5.0 will not work for 5.1.\n\nA: While not a clean solution and not properly preventing Safari from creating the thumbnails in the first place, this apparently works to keep them from taking up disk space:\nrm ~/Library/Safari/WebpageIcons.db && ln -s /dev/null ~/Library/Safari/WebpageIcons.db\n\nIncidentally, even going to Safari → Reset Safari… and ticking Remove all webpage preview images will apparently leave this hack intact.\nAs for Top Sites, there are a few places you can remove it from:\n\n\n*\n\n*Safari → Preferences → General → New windows open with\n\n*Safari → Preferences → General → New tabs open with\n\n*Safari → Preferences → Bookmarks → Bookmarks bar\nI don't believe the menu item can be removed this easily.\n\nA: TinkerTool 4.7, a free utility for system customization, has just added a new feature for Safari 5.1, \"Disable storage of preview images for web pages.\"\n\n", "Q: How to save contacts in iPhone so it can be used for transferring it to my HTC Desire? I want to transfer my contact from iPhone to HTC Desire so is there any way to do it. As I have more than 200 contacts in Contact list in iPhone and I don't want to enter it manually. \n\nA: I am assuming that you sync your iPhone to iTunes on either Windows or Mac, and that these  contacts are then displayable in Apple Address Book or an equivalent program on Windows (Microsoft Outlook, etc.).\nThe procedure would be to sync all your contacts from the iPhone to the Mac or Windows program, then use that program to export the contacts in a database format that could then be imported into the HTC Desire software, or the software on Mac or Windows that you use to sync data with your HTC Desire.\nUpdate:\nSince you have indicated that you are using the iPhone to sync to iTunes on Windows, then this forum may not be the best place to ask this question. You will need to use programs that run on Windows to get the contact data reformatted into a format suitable for importing into the HTC Desire, and you will need to use Windows software to upload it into the HTC Desire as well.\nPeople on this forum tend not to use Windows for these kinds of functions, so I suggest that you also post this question on a Windows-centric and Android-centric smart-phone support forum.\n", "Q: How can I get the name of connected devices on an Apple AirPort Extreme Base Station?

We're at a crossroads where most Macs now have space and connections to contain two storage devices. SSD are fast, low capacity and expensive - HDD are in comparison slow, huge and cheap. \nBoth iMacs and Mac Mini can ship configured with two drives and all the portable Macs that still ship with an optical drive have a choice of several professional kits that securely mount either a second HDD or SSD inside the unibody. (I've even seen Airs with a light USB drive semi-permanently affixed to the metal side of the display with velcro since sometimes even the slimmest Mac needs to pack more storage punch.)\nYet Mac OS X doesn't really have a Setup Assistant that's willing to help divvy up our data on two drives. Software to intelligently move files to appropriate storage exists in the enterprise SAN space, but I don't think we'll see it for a while on the desktop. There's not even a guide I've seen on what or how to set up a mac with two drives, so Apple have left us a clean playing field upon which to experiment.\nThe best writing on this topic I have seen recently was written by Matt Legend Gemmell. His article titled Using OS X with an SSD plus HDD setup is great reading and seems to be relevant even if you have two spinning HDD.\nMatt advocates \n\n\n*\n\n*installing the OS, user home folders and most user data on the SSD \n\n*place user data that won't fit on the SSD instead on the HDD\n\n*implementing this by moving entire top level folders from the SSD home folder and placing them on the HDD. \n\n*using soft (sym) links to connect the two locations.\n\n\nIs this thinking the current state of the art? \nWhat works for you and more importantly, why does it work for you? \nTips on how full or empty to keep your boot drive and any gotchas you learned the hard way are greatly appreciated.\n\nA: My setup is the following : \n\n\n*\n\n*Macbook pro 2009, 13\"\n\n*SSD (Intel X25M Postville) replacing the superdrive, used as system + home folder disk\n\n*Factory HDD used for music and pictures storage\n\n\nI tried to move my home folder to te HDD, here are my conclusions : \nwhen you move your entire home folder to an HDD, your mac boots fast, but you don't get too much performance gain while opening applications (even apps that do not use any document, like safari). That's because when the app starts up, it loads it preference and cache files from your library. If it is on the second drive, startup of apps is nearly as slow as when  you use your HDD for booting. \nI now use my HDD for iTunes/Aperture and vmware images only. These apps are a bit slower than the others (but still as fast are when I didn't have a SSD). But I did not do as Matt recommends : I created new iTunes and aperture libraries directly on the HDD, using the alt key at launch. I do not like symlinks, that can break if you unmount your HDD, for maintenance or by mistake for example, leaving your home folder in a non consistent state.\nLast points : \n\n\n*\n\n*with this configuration, you have to be careful of what files you put on the HDD if you have multiple accounts on your mac : these files are accessible to anybody by default, and filevault will not protect them (unless you use Lion which allows full-drive encryption). \n\n*And you need to setup Time machine to include the HDD (if needed), which includes only the system drive by default. \n\n\nA: Moving the Home Directory to the SSD\nMacintosh Performance Guide has an excellent writeup on the subject. Most important perhaps is the admonishion to Create another admin account that resides on the boot drive.  Else, if your drive containing the home directory goes away, you cannot log in.\n\n\nTips on how full or empty to keep your boot drive and any gotchas you\n  learned the hard way are greatly appreciated.\n\nAnother MPG article; very informative. Synopsis: As you approach 2/3 - 3/4 full the disk's performance can decrease about 40%. And in the spirit of this question-thread - this does not happen to an SSD.\n\nA: For installation of the OS, apps et cetera\nGive one disk to JHFS+. \nIf you're limited to two disks and one is hard, use the hard disk. \nFor integrity of user data\nGive at least one other disk to ZFS. \nWhy not HFS Plus?\nA little HFS test – a command-line presentation by @jolly of DIY Fusion Drive fame – demonstrates HFS Plus failure in one situation. \nIn other situations: corruption of data may go unnoticed, and be propagated through all backups, to the point of no recovery. \nSuch corruption may be undetectable by utilities such as Disk Utility and Alsoft DiskWarrior (that's the nature of HFS Plus). Effects on end users range from subtle to extreme; and without positive identification of files that are corrupted, it can be extraordinarily difficult to pinpoint the source of a problem. \nWhy ZFS?\nSee for example the accepted answer to a question in Server Fault, ZFS Data Loss Scenarios –\n\n… I've never lost data with ZFS.\nI have experienced everything else …\n\nIf the disk is hard (rotational)\nAvoid a mixture of file systems that includes HFS Plus: \n\n\nSince HFS+ has a single global lock for all metadata updates (held across the I/O) it is highly sensitive to disk latencies. …\n\n\n(My current use of JHFS+ and ZFS on a Seagate Momentus® XT ST750LX003-1AC154 solid state hybrid – internal to a MacBookPro5,2 with 8 GB memory – is good enough, but could perform better without that mixture on the single disk.)\n\nWith three or more disks, just one solid state, and Mountain Lion\nGive one slice of the SSD to a CoreStorage LVG, then pool that with your JHFS+ startup volume. Aim: Fusion Drive-like behaviour.\nGive a different slice of the SSD to ZFS. Either: \n\n\n*\n\n*simply zpool add poolname cache /dev/disknslicen or \n\n*give the slice to CoreStorage the add that CoreStorage to your ZFS pool.\n\n\nApproach (1) is well established for performance gains through level 2 adaptive replacement cache. Brendan's blog » L2ARC Screenshots (2009-01-30) reminds us that rebooting the operating system causes L2ARC to go cold and: \n\nWe are also working on a persistent L2ARC, so if a server does reboot\n  it can begin warm, which will be available in a future update.\n\nApproach (2) aims to bring auto-tiering to ZFS without a go-cold at reboot. A routine check of integrity of data (scrub) might demote data from the high performance tier … if so, I wonder whether another routine can mitigate the effects of demotion – an incremental zfs send… (backup) should read, from the ZFS pool, recently written blocks; and so CoreStorage should promote things to the preferred tier. \nMultiple pools sharing a single SSD\nThe accepted answer to a question in Server Fault observes: \n\nIt's not a good idea to share an SSD between pools for reasons of data integrity and performance. …\n\nHowever, the subject for that question was ZFS - how to partition SSD for ZIL or L2ARC use? (2011-02-22) – predating ZEVO, Fusion Drive etc.. Under ZEVO resilience to untimely loss of L2ARC (2012-11-04) my initial guess is that with multiple pools sharing a single SSD, the L2ARC part of that SSD need not pose a risk to integrity of data. \n(I have no experience with ZIL.)\n\nPersonally: for the past few months I have used ZEVO ZFS for my home directory, with CoreStorage to encrypt the ZFS dataset and the startup volume. Different passwords, so (better than FileVault 2) no other administrator of the machine can access my data. \nApple Disk Utility is currently too bugged to present a true overview, so here are alternative views. \nThe one solid state hybrid drive in the laptop: \n\nPlus an external hard disk drive (StoreJet) and its cache vdev (Verbatim, USB flash drive) for level 2 adaptive replacement cache: \n\nHint: the cache device can be physically removed whilst actively using the hard disk drive. No harm should result; this is one of the beauties of ZFS.\nGenerally: if the idea of mixing two pool technologies (Apple CoreStorage plus ZFS) puts your head in Here be dragons! territory then: \n\n\n*\n\n*set aside thoughts of mixtures\n\n*for ZFS, do at least take a look at MacZFS or fuller-featured ZEVO. \n\n\n@bmike will probably wish for a tl;dr addition to this answer … a diagram might make the whole caboodle easier to digest. \n\nA: I own a botique short-run book publishing company. For all intents, the design and printing operations are a one-man operation. Time spent waiting for a spinning beach ball is wasted and unprofitable time. Funds are tight for getting the latest equipment, but I try to incorporate the technology that provides the best bang for the buck. I recreationally dabble in PHP/MySQL web development.\nMy main system is an Early 2008 MacPro (3,1). I have a 2011 mid-level Mac mini as a secondary design machine and internal web/database server. Both systems boot from 128GB SSDs that also hold the user folders and pull publishing project data from spinning hard drives. While the MaPro is a processor-gifted rig, keep in mind that the Mac mini runs SATA twice as fast. \nHere's how I have my Mac Pro:\n128GB SSD\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud files\n\n*Dropbox files\n\n*Fonts\n\n*User folders\n\n*Mail\n\n*Personal files except for music, movies and photos\n\n*Photoshop cache files\n\n*Typically have 20GB to 40GB free space at any given time\n\n\nSecondary HDDs running ZFS\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup software install files\n\n*iTunes library \n\n*iPhoto library\n\n*Folder of movies\n\n*All my client publishing projects\n\n\nI've managed to live within a 128GB space by keeping the big stuff off my SSD. No \"fancy\" things like symbolic links. iTunes and iPhoto are one-time points to their files. I manually move movie rips from /users/movies to my HDDs... When I get around to it. I use Dropbox mainly for 1Password sync and iCloud holds much of my word processing, spreadsheets and presentations for access from the MacPro as well as my iOS gear. \nI have always manually managed file locations for my client projects in InDesign, Illustrator and Photoshop. Most client files are small enough (5MB to 50MB typically) that they load quickly, especially because the programs run from the SSD. I notice the speed difference of the hard drive when I build 100MB to 500MB Photoshop files. I've discovered that saving to PSD is single-threaded and slow where Photoshop's saving to a layered TIF is multi-threaded and much faster.\nThis relatively simple and predominantly manually set up system works extremely well for me... almost all of the time. On the personal side, my only major housekeeping functions involve movies. \nI am contemplating building a Fusion Drive on the mini but haven't done so yet. As I begin to create more intricate book designs that require larger Photoshop files, I would happily trade my complete control provided by my current setup for the automatic tiered storage provided by a Fusion Drive.\nI drive a manual transmission car because it's more fun. I use a Mac because OS X just works better than Windows. If I can find a way to leverage the ZFS data integrity with a Fusion Drive's fluidity, I'd go that route in a heartbeat.\n\nA: Under Mountain Lion it is possible to replicate the Apple Fusion drive with standard SSDs and HDDs under Mountain Lion. This automates the splitting of sata across the SSD and hard disk.\nThis keeps commonly used files an SSD and less used data on a hard disk. When you read or write to a file the OS will migrate the blocks being used to the SSD so subsequent accesses will be on the SSD and if commonly used will be on the SSD to begin with, unused files will just be on the gard disk.\nthe process is detailed in this blog or in an answer to this question\n\nA: I am on Ventura with 30% of my one-terabyte drive empty.  If my thin little machine also had an HDD inside (won't fit, but this is hypothetical), I'd move to the HDD our large libraries of photos, books, music, and videos.\nI would also make both SSD and HDD bootable.\n", "Q: Can I put memory from a 2.7GHz Mac Mini into a 2.4 GHz MacBook? A colleague has just upgraded the memory in his spanking new 2.7GHz Core i7 Mac Mini from 4Gb to 8Gb. This means he's got 2x2Gb PC3-10600 (1333MHz) modules kicking around.\nI have a Mid-2010 model 2.4GHz Core 2 MacBook which has 2x1Gb PC3-8500 (1067MHz) modules.\nSo, my question: can I replace the memory in my MacBook with his spare modules? Does the speed mismatch matter? Will it just \"downgrade\" to the speed my MacBook's expecting, work but be worse (slower) than the memory I have now, or just not work at all? (Or, worst case, fry my MacBook?)\n\nA: I've seen this attempted a couple times, each times putting faster clocked RAM into a machine designed for something slower - same machine as yours, the white unibody.\nIt might turn on, but it likely won't boot - just hang at the Apple logo.\n", "Q: Xcode and python and java I just installed Xcode 4. Everything seemed fine, but then, after poking around, I found that the ability to create Python and Java (And probably more) projects was missing. I asked Apple in apple store chat (on their web site) and was told that Python and Java are supported. However, I can't find where to make a Python or Java project - only C based files (and some more miscellaneous files). Does anyone know how to make Java/Python based files/projects?\n\nA: I think Xcode 4 does not support Java or python so I would be interested in seeing what the chat said. OSX does support both.\nXcode was never a very good IDE for java or python so I would always try to use something else (except if using PyObjc)\nLook on Stack Overflow for suggestions of IDEs\nIntelliJ/PyCharm and Eclipse work on OSX as do several others\n\nA: TextMate is a good editor for Ruby and Python. Tons of bundle's can be added to make it fit your needs.\n\nA: Nothing has changed with Python support; just drop into the terminal:\n$ python —version\nPython 2.7.1\nYou can use Xcode’s editor to make .py files, etc.\nCheck out Quick Python/Developer tips for OSX Lion for more details.\nRegarding Java, it’s not part of Lion, but that’s easy to fix—download the runtime for Java SE 6 version 1.6.0_26 from Apple so you can run the programs you’ll be writing and possibly an IDE (like Eclipse) that requires it.\n\nA: I have not tried Python in XCode, but I have successfully built Java projects with XCode 3. When I updated XCode to 3.2, they dropped the Java Templates. I just used Time Machine to get the templates back and added them to ~/Library/Application Support/Xcode/Project Templates/Java and now I have my templates and it still compiles. I can't confirm if this works in XCode 4 but you can give it a try. I uploaded the templates if you don't have them and need to download.\n", "Q: Connect a desktop PC wirelessly to a home network via Airport Express I have a desktop computer with a non-Mac OS (it currently runs Windows XP Home Edition, but I'm about to replace/add Ubuntu) which I can't connect to my home network (again, the router is not a Mac product): I don't have an ethernet cable where it currently is and it doesn't have a wireless connection option. I do however have an Airport Express and I wanted to know if it was possible to use it as an \"antennae\" to set a wireless connection to my network.\nI mean, the idea would be something like this:\nPC <--(ethernet)--> Airport express <--(wireless)--> Router\n\nEDIT: It CAN be done. I was not allowed to touch a lot of things in the router/network, but I managed to configure the Airport without changing things in the current network. I had to set the IP manually but it is currently working.\n\nA: This doesn't answer your title, but your question I suppose.\nUnless you just have the AirPort lying around without any use, a cheaper solution would be to get a USB Wireless Adapter. You can get those for almost a tenth of the price of an Airport.\n\nA: The official word seems to be that the router needs to be Airport Express or Airport Extreme (or, presumably, Time Capsule). Searching around, some folks are reporting success when the router is a WRT54G.  Either way, you'll need the Apple Airport Utility to set it up initially which itself will require OS-X or Windows.\n\nA: No. When Airport Express is connected to an existing wifi network (referred to by Apple as \"client mode\") it's ethernet port is disabled and it's only use is for AirTunes or printing.\nEdit:\nI fear my information (and Airport Express box) was a little bit outdated. According to Apple this may work on newer boxes with 802.11n, but not on older ones with 802.11g.\n\nWhile in client mode, AirPort Express with 802.11n will be able to use\n  the Ethernet port to pass Wi-Fi traffic to a device connected to the\n  Ethernet port. However, the original AirPort Express 802.11g doesn't\n  support this feature and will disable the Ethernet port. Only\n  compatible USB printers or audio devices are supported.\n\nAt that it might even work if you have a WDS network and set the Airport Express to \"Participate in a WDS network\".\n", "Q: iPod Touch \"Location Services\" Issues This post is meant to be informative as possible while leading up to my question.\n\nWhen I first purchased my iPod Touch in 2009, Skyhook Wireless was responsible for maintaining the database used by Location Services on Apple devices without GPS.\nSince there is no GPS radio in the iPod Touch, Location Services uses an online database of Lat/Long corresponding with the router's hardware MAC address at the Wifi access point.  I presume this data was gathered through iPhones' GPS data while connected to these Wifi access points.  I also think that Skyhook contracted vehicles similar to how Google gathers Streetview photos.\nRegardless, this system worked great until you got into a rural area and connected to a router never exposed to one of these data gathering vehicles.  Therefore at my own home, also in a rural area, I could not use any Location Services enabled feature.\nSo back in 2009 the fix was simple, I had to manually add my router's MAC address along with my Lat/Long coordinates to Skyhook.  After a few weeks, the data was correctly added and so anyone connected to my Wifi was accurately shown on a map with a pin on my roof.  Any Location Services dependent feature was fully enabled while I was connected to Wifi at my home.\n\nFor an unknown reason and corresponding to an iOS version upgrade in Spring of 2010, Location Services stopped functioning from my home.  (still worked at most public and less rural locations)\nAs per postings in the Apple online forums, Apple stopped using Skyhook for Location Services and took this job in-house.\nFor many months following the Spring of 2010 my Touch could not find my location while at home.  To this day, I can confirm that my MAC address is still in the Skyhook database but it doesn't matter because Apple is no longer using Skyhook.  There is also no-place to report a router's MAC address with Lat/Long to Apple similar to this.\nSuddenly late last year, while at home, Location Services started reporting my location on the main highway just 0.50 miles away.  So apparently one of the data gathering vehicles drove down this route and picked up my signal.\nI was satisfied.  The map location was slightly wrong but the pinpoint was close enough that all Location Services dependent features were again useful to me from my home location.  Good enough.\n\nNow this all brings us to today where it's suddenly broken again.  Location Services cannot find my location while I am at home and my Location Services dependent apps are useless.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Does anyone have additional information or updated news on this topic?\n\n*A URL similar to this one where one can manually submit a Wifi MAC address and Lat/Long to Apple?\n\n*If not Apple, what company took over maintaining Location Services from Skyhook for Apple?\n\nA: I'm going to answer the first part of my own question.\nAfter upgrading my iPod Touch to iOS 5, Location Services started working again.  Not only did it start working, it's showing the location as a point in the street in front of the house.\n1)  The location I manually submitted to Skyhook in 2009 was in the street farther south, by the mailbox, so the old data point is not being used.  Not suprised since I have no reason to believe that Apple went back to Skyhook.  A visit to Skyhook's website verified that this point has not changed.\n2)  The location that Apple started using last year was a point on the main highway 1/2 mile east of here.\nSo somehow Apple has independently obtained new data about my wifi location.  It's possible that during a recent party, somebody with an iPhone had connected to my Wifi and that data was sent back to Apple.  It's also possible that a Wifi data collection vehicle drove down this road.  It's very rural with only three homes on a one mile stretch, so although possible it's difficult to believe.\nIt was my previous understanding that Apple started requiring that devices be within range of several Wifi signals to improve Location Services accuracy.  Being in a rural location, it's nearly impossible for my iPod to pick up any Wifi signal other than my own.  With Skyhook, this was never an issue.\nHowever, iOS 5 seems to heavily depend on Location Services so maybe they've changed something critical to how it functions in order to improve accuracy without requiring multiple Wifi signals.\nI'm going to accept my own answer.  If anyone has a better answer to my original question, I'll consider accepting that instead.\n", "Q: Remove duplicates from contextual menus In addition to Time Machine I do a weekly clone of my system drive to a volume on a second hard drive in my 2011 MacBook Pro. I also made a clone in another volume before I upgraded to Lion.\nNow some of the apps from the Snow Leopard drive clone are starting to show up as duplicates in \"open with\" contextual menus.  If I choose one of the duplicates it will open the app from the cloned volume.\nHow can I remove these items from the menu and make sure OS X doesn't think these are installed apps?\nScreenshot:\n\n\nA: I had the same problem, rebuilding the Launch Services database did the trick for me. Entered the following in Terminal:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain user\n\nThen log out and back in. The open with menu should be clear of duplicates.\nCredit: https://discussions.apple.com/message/15251482#15251482\n\nA: Rebuilding your LaunchServices database won't do you any good because your computer is seeing the version of the apps on your cloned hard drive (hence the different version numbers). If they were the same number rebuilding the LaunchServices database like answered by others would work.\nYour easiest method is to eject your cloned hard drive - this way they won't appear. Telling Spotlight to ignore the drive should tell it from now on to not add the applications to it's list of apps that can open that type of file.\n\nA: Try rebuilding the Launch Services database as described here. Also, it may help to set your backup drive to be ignored by Spotlight (from the Spotlight preferences):\n\n", "Q: Comfortable typing on a MacBook Pro? I love my macbook pro, I have the 17\" version that came out several months ago.  So I can take it with me wherever, at my desk, friend's place, on the couch.. and have a full development environment with the big screen.\nProblem is my wrists scrape against the edge on the bottom of the keyboard.  I'm on the computer a lot and this is starting to really bother me.  Normal desktop (detached) keyboards don't have this edge...  I actually bought Apple's wireless beautiful little keyboard, but then the issue is the screen gets too far away if I have to put the wireless keyboard in front of the laptop's built-in keyboard.  And working on my lap, which I absolutely love, is much less comfortable.\nWhat's the solution?  Is there a nice thin padding product I can buy for the bottom of the macbook pro?  Is there a stand or way I can position the laptop so I can use the wireless keyboard without the screen being too far away?  Is that even possible while the laptop and wireless keyboard are on my lap?\nUPDATE: I guess the Apple wireless keyboard is a little problematic to use on my lap because it doesn't have a trackpad... so I'll constantly be moving my arm far to move the mouse.\n\nA: Why don't you put the laptop on a bookstand? that's what I do with my MB.\ntyping while the laptop is on the bookstand might not suit everyone's taste, but you can easily slide a keyboard right in front of it, leaving the screen where it needs to be!\n\nA: As cheap alternative to the bookstand + external keyboard combination already mentioned, I find it very useful to simply wedge a small flat object (I use a marker) under the back of the laptop while it's resting on a desk. This puts the keyboard at a slight angle, which I found much more comfortable for prolonged typing (keeps the wrist from pressing on the edge too hard).\nIt also provides some extra ventilation (that's why I originally did it), as the wrist rests can get uncomfortably hot sometimes on my MBP.\nYou can also use an external monitor with your external keyboard in front of it and leave the laptop somewhere to the side to use as 2nd screen.\n\nA: I am not exactly sure if this will work for you, but check it out. I haven't used it before, but we have the MBP keyboard protector and it is a great quality product.\n", "Q: Time Capsule and multiple backup drives Right now we have a single iMac in the house and I have two external hard drives.  \nOne is connected to the iMac and used for TimeMachine backups.  The other is a few miles away (thanks Mom!) to act as off-site backup, and I swap them once every couple of weeks.\nThinking of adding another computer to the mix and I don't necessarily want to purchase two more disks to keep it backed up, so I am considering upgrading to TimeCapsule.\nBut it has an in-built disk.\nSo how do people either do \na) an offsite backup\nb) swap disks like I used to\nc) anything that will work similarly!\n\nA: Golden Rule of Backups: Keep it simple!\nSwapping disks and storing one of them off-site is a good backup strategy. But it also means that there are some manual steps every time you swap disks and sooner or later you will get it wrong. To avoid unnecessary data loss you don't\n\n\n*\n\n*use one external backup drive for several computers\n\n*mix backup and other use on the same disk\n\n\nGiven the low costs of adding two additional hard disks to your pool I don't think it's worth the risk to avoid these costs.\n\nA: Carbonite is an online backup service that backs up your computer (Mac or PC) offsite. It cost $59/per computer per year. I don't have it, but I have heard very good things about it.\n", "Q: Installing Lion on another MacBook Pro through a bootable DVD but won't show up I tried creating a bootable DVD of Lion, which was successful and would load in my MacBook Pro (already running Lion). I inserted the same DVD to another MacBook Pro running Snow Leopard, but it comes up as a blank CD... Anyone have any idea why this is happening?\nThanks!\n\nA: Same as you : my brand new MBP cannot read a DVD (it says it is blank), but that same DVD can be read OK from older Macs. I went to an Apple store with that DVD, and they found the same problem, i.e. the DVD can be read OK on some machines, but not OK on others. I left them the DVD, they are going to enquire about it and about why some of their own machines can read and some others cannot.\nSo maybe your problem is just about that : a DVD which unluckily cannot be read on your machine.\nHope this helps !\n\nA: It's hard to say. Do you have issues reading any other bootable DVDs/CDs on that device? I have had issues with my SuperDrive and because of it I actually created a bootable USB stick with Lion on it, worked perfectly.\nYou can find instructions on creating this bootable USB media here: http://www.tuaw.com/2011/08/11/build-your-own-lion-install-usb-thumb-drive-for-cheap/\n", "Q: How can I migrate data when Migration Assistant doesn't recognize Time Machine external drive? I'm trying to migrate my files from my time machine backup (external drive 500 Gb) to my MacBook Pro with Lion 10.7.1. It has almost empty brand new internal hard drive 500 Gb.\nI can see the external hard drive in the desktop (is connected to my MacBook Pro with a FireWire cable), but the Migration Assistant is unable to recognize it!\nWhat can I do to migrate my files?\n\nA: Have you tried right clicking on the time machine icon on your dock, and telling it to browse other time machine disks? See if Time Machine will recognize it as a backup, and see if it will restore any files that way.\nWhen you select Restore From Time Machine backup it doesn't even see the external drive or list it/any backups? \n\nA: Boot to your recovery partition holding down cmd+R on restart. That will give you the option to restore from time machine backup. That will definitely find your time machine backup\n", "Q: MacBook Air 2010 OS X 10.6.8 w/Broadcom wifi disconnecting: \"Disassociated because station leaving\" The wifi on my MacBook Air 2010 keeps dropping the connection at home with a Linksys WRT160N router running DD-WRT v24-sp1 (07/27/08) std.

Reason 8 (Disassociated because station leaving).\n\nDoes anyone know the canonical solution to this problem? There are threads on Apple Support Communities that go on for 70 pages, but no high-profile links that have a definitive answer.\n\nA: I have the same problem and I've also been looking around a lot. The only thing I find is that if you have an Atheros Wi-Fi hardware in your Mac (I just found out that I did, mid-2011-iMac) this will help:\nhttp://rys.pixeltards.com/2011/09/04/osx-lion-wifi.html\n", "Q: How can I use an audio device's other channel for input to iChat and Skype? I have an external microphone setup that I like to use for audio and video chats. My audio interface has four input channels, and my primary inputs to this interface happen to be its channels 3-4. When I view System Preferences -> Sound -> Input and select the interface, I see levels as would be expected, but doing the same in iChat or Skype preferences show no level.\nWhen setting up GarageBand to use this interface, I notice that it provides two stereo channels: 1-2 and 3-4. I am thus led to believe that System Preferences shows a total of all levels on all channels, while iChat and Skype simply default to the 1-2 inputs and ignore the rest.\nIs there some way to send channels 3-4 of my external audio interface (it's a ProSonus Inspire1394) to iChat and Skype? I couldn't find anything in Audio MIDI Setup to help out, but maybe someone knows specifics.\n\nA: Well, seems like I just had to think about it a little bit more. My workaround is not possible using only system utilities. I used Soundflower and LineIn from Rogue Amoeba software.\nUsing LineIn, I could select channels 3-4 specifically from the PreSonus device and route those to the two-channel Soundflower device. Then, I simply selected the Soundflower device as my input in iChat.\n\nA: In general, Soundflower is the app of choice when discussing /any/ of these \"how do I route audio from application X to application Y\" type questions.\n", "Q: Why is mds using so much Real Memory? I notice that mds is almost always on top for use of Real Memory.  I wouldn't mind if this wouldn't be also the case when Free Memory runs out.\nUsually mds uses over 600MB on a system with 4GB (I know I need a new Mac) and no Free Memory.\nI notice that it might be somehow connected to Time Machine running (mds memory goes up when/after a Time Machine backup is done).\nI kill mds from time to time but pretty soon it is again using over 600MB.\nGoogling this brings some workaround tips but nothing which is really on any foundation or analysis.\nI'm having this problem on Leopard (still stuck on a Q G5) but have seen reports on the net that the same problem also exists on Snow Leopard.\nDon't know about Lion though.\nUpdate:\nAfter the question in the comments if my Time-Machine is also indexed by Spotlight, I did some more research and found Setting Spotlight preferences in Apples MAC OSX 10.6 Help:\n\nNote:If you add a Time Machine backup disk to the list, you will\n  continue to see messages that Spotlight is indexing your backup disk.\n  This indexing is necessary for Time Machine to function properly and\n  can’t be disabled. Spotlight will exclude from searches any items you\n  store on your backup disk that are not part of a Time Machine backup.\n\nSo the Time-Machine partition is always indexed no matter what you set.\n\nA: The obvious thing to try is eject the Time Machine volume (or otherwise make it unavailable - turned off) and reboot the mac. mds will only use RAM when a program is asking it to supply spotlight answers. The files you have are using a large amount of space and being called upon. A clean boot should get your mds with little or no RSS until you start to launch apps or TM starts.\n\nWhether this is normal is harder to tell - even if it's caused by your files, it's likely made worse a direct result of the PPC architecture not having as optimized a time of indexing than the Intel architecture. The mds program likely is coded with parts of the code for PPC and part for Intel as part of the normal performance optimizations Apple or any large corporation will do before releasing a daemon that runs all the time. Furthermore, the frameworks it uses will be native to the processor - so it's not really the same program running when you have a different CPU.\nThe comments to the question show that you have really down your homework and played around a bit with excluding volumes to see if the large memory is happening in response to many drives being indexed.\nSadly, you don't have any real control over how large the process gets. It simply runs based on the spotlight importers that are present on your system and in response to all the filesystems you expose the spotlight subsystem to.\nIf the obvious step of isolating Time Machine doesn't reduce the RAM usage, You can also try:\n\n\n*\n\n*cleaning out third party spotlight extensions\n\n*add more RAM and live with it\n\n*permanently disable the folders that are causing RAM usage to spike (and forego the usefulness of spotlight)\n\n*temporarily disabling all volumes by putting them on the privacy exclusion list and then slowly adding folders to be indexed and hope to determine which sort of data is causing the worst spike in \n\n*use Shark and their kind (part of Xcode and the CHUD tools) to sample the running mds process and map out the memory allocation as it is happening. This is fairly high on the skill level and won't change your end solution either way - you'll just know why - and maybe still not have a cure.\n\n\nAlso sadly for you - most people are not running 10.5 on PPC chips, so the number of people that can run some tests or have seen this and poked around the issue it to find out what sort of file or importer might be likely to  take more memory once mds gets it's hands on the metadata store.\nIt does sound odd - so you have a very valid point with more than usual RAM usage. But, it's not necessarily something that is wrong - you just might have data that needs that large amount of RAM. Only by taking your data to a similar mac or doing the process of elimination can you know for sure.\n", "Q: Is it possible to switch from Safe Mode to Normal and back without a reboot? Since 10.6.3, Apple has decided change the AppleIntelCPUManagement kexts, which leave me stuck with a kernel_task that pegs out at 135-185%, generating a lot of heat.\nAnyway, since I doubt anyone has a fix to the above, is it possible to switch from Safe Mode to Normal (and vice-versa) without a reboot?\n\nA: No.\nTo start at the beginning, Mac OS X loads certain kernel extensions very early in the boot process. And, intrinsically, kernel extensions will only function if they are loaded at the start of the boot process. \nThe purpose of Safe Mode is to boot the computer without these kernel extensions.\nIn Normal mode, these kernel extensions are permitted to load right at the beginning of the boot.\nSo, by definition, the only way to have Normal mode is to load all the kernel extensions at boot time. Hence, if you are in Safe Mode, you must reboot to create Normal Mode.\n", "Q: I cannot install the Tiled Map Editor on Mac OS X 10.6.8 I am attempting to install Tiled Map Editor, a cross-platform open-source application that uses the QT application framework.

I am using Mac OS X 10.6.8.\n\nA: Check to see if the application you are using is Intel supported. I don't know why a PPC application wouldn't run on an Intel, but try clicking on the application, go to File>Get Info, and under General>Kind, check to see what the application kind is.\n\nA: It would be helpful to know which version of OS X you're running. \n\n\n*\n\n*You must have Xcode installed on your machine.\n\n*It's possible you have downloaded the 64bit version.\n\n*Verify you have the correct version.\n\n", "Q: Lion Terminal remembers sudo password after quitting I've been using Lion since its release, and I noticed today, for the first time, that Terminal did not prompt me for a password when I typed in a sudo command, if I close and reopen Terminal within the five-minute window, but wait longer than five minutes after reopening the application to enter another sudo command.\nIs it being cached somewhere as a result of Lion's new \"remember the state of the application\" feature? Can I turn off this setting? It seems rather insecure.\nI've also tried using the Command + Option + Q combination, as well as exiting Terminal before quitting the application, to no avail (also within the five minute timeout window).\nFor the record, I don't recall seeing this behaviour before I updated to 10.7.1, but I may be wrong.\nCan anyone else replicate this for me and confirm my suspicion, before I log a bug with Apple?\n\nEDIT: Apparently my question isn't clear. I want to know if this is normal, or a bug:\n\n\n*\n\n*Issue sudo command. I am prompted for a password.\n\n*Close Terminal before sudo timeout takes effect (within five minutes).\n\n*Open Terminal again, and wait more than five minutes before issuing sudo again.\n\n*Issue sudo command. I am not prompted for a password.\n\nA: This is normal, and an inherent consequence of the way sudo handles its 5-minute don't-need-to-reauthenticate window.  When you authenticate to sudo, it records your account as having authenticated.  Because the authentication is tied to your account (not a Terminal session or something like that), it's still valid if you quit & reopen Terminal, log out & back in, or even switch to a different session type (e.g. console login vs. SSH session vs. cron job running as your user ID, etc). I'm not certain offhand if it survives a reboot -- if not, it's because there's a step in the system startup process that wipes the timestamp files.\nBTW, you can clear your own timestamp file with sudo -K.\n\nA: By default, sudo retains authentication state for 5 minutes (this is not new to Lion). This default timeout can be controlled with the timestamp_timeout setting in /etc/sudoers (use visudo to edit). See man 5 sudoers for more.\nIt can also be reset individually by removing the timestamp directory for the user, e.g. sudo rmdir /var/db/sudo/username\nThis is not related to the application state feature introduced in Lion (controllable via System Preferences -> General -> Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps).\n", "Q: How can I keep restore for apps in Lion without having session restore when I log in? I want to have my apps start with their previous state (windows/tabs/documents), but I do not want to have all the apps I was running before logging out/rebooting/shutting down restart automatically. I see the option:\nSystem Preferences -> General -> Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps\n\nbut I want to have the apps keep their state. I tend to open a lot of apps over time and I don't want to put the load on the system or wait while all those apps start when I log in. It may be that Lion cheats and the apps are only really loaded on demand, so there is not the overhead I'm worried about, but the one restart I've done since installing Lion seems to indicate otherwise.\n\nA: You can simply uncheck Reopen windows when logging back in when rebooting ( -> Restart):\n\nSadly there doesn't seem to be a preference to make this change permanent. The best solution found so far are a few AppleScripts that let you restart with the option unchecked.\n", "Q: Lion version of vim crashing repeatably - caught deadly signal SEGV whenever I work on multiple files in different vim buffers/tabs and do a :w to save, vim crashes with a segmentation fault. \nI'm using vim 7.3 that came long with Lion (Actually with SnowLeopard which later I upgraded to Lion). \nIs this issue Lion specific or is this only affecting upgrade users? Any one seen similar issues.\nI've been a linux user for most of the time but just bought a mac recently and also upgraded to Lion recently. \nIt's quite aggravating to spend so much money and now can't use vim :(\n\nA: There are two avenues when you have located a repeatable crash (and from the comments and discussions it sure looks like the shipping version is more crash than ideal for the latest shipping OS).\n\n\n*\n\n*File a bug at bugreporter.apple.com - it's free if you sign up for a free developer account.\n\n*Use something like homebrew to get a newer (or older) version of vim that isn't crashing.\n\n\nA: You could give MacVim a go.

I imported a lot of super 8 film using iMovie. While the import worked great it didn't split the video into separate clips. I've read that iMovie does this automatically for DV tapes. Is there any OSX software out there that will detect when one clips ends and another begins and automatically split the two into separate files. I imagine it would have to compare adjacent frames and determine if the difference between the two was great enough to warrant a split.\nFYI I'm looking for a simple application that will do the above without breaking the bank. I don't want to invest in a video editing suite right now.\n\nA: You might find ReCut helpful.\nffmpeg, a free open source product, looks like it is working on this issue.  Unfortunately, it is not complete yet.\nSee also this Super User question: Automatic Scene Detection\n\nA: This is probably not a real answer (I do not have enough reputation to leave it as a comment on the question), but it gives a bit of information on why iMovie and other cheaper video editors split DV, but not super 8 and other analogue tapes.  \nDV formats encode the timestamp on the feed, and applications can read these timestamps and when a stop/start point is detected (missing time seconds) they split the video.\nTo split analogue formats, you must do image comparison, as you mention, detecting when the whole frame changes between frames. There are applications that do this, but I do not know of any that are in the lower price ranges.\n\nA: Andrew is correct. With DV there is the timestamp that determines when a clip starts/stops. But bringing in an analog tape, when you bring it in, it just gets one long timestamp. There's no software i'm aware of that does it well. In the end, it would probably be faster to just split it up manually anyways. The software, if it existed, would have to analyze every frame of video, and then guess where the breaks are. It would probably guess wrong too often, and you would end up having to put together clips that were not meant to be broken apart..\n", "Q: Repartitioning after Bootcamp problems When I first got my MacBook Pro, I installed Windows 7 via Boot Camp.\nA couple months later I wanted to install Ubuntu and have a triple boot.

I also included a version that works with ⇧ Shift so you can select text as you go.\nCaveat: this will only work in Cocoa apps, but I think the normal ⌥ Option+arrow navigation does too.

Opened word/pages and pasted the jpg into the document and then used a rectangle box to blackout whatever I wanted to and then I exported it as a pdf.\n\nA: If you want to leave it as a PDF, you really need to use the actual redaction tools in Adobe Acrobat, otherwise you are simply leaving yourself open to reversals.\nhttps://www.adobe.com/acrobat/resources/how-to-redact-a-pdf.html\nIf you want to save the PDF as a graphics file, then any black box over the words should work.\n\nA: A free solution, is to convert the PDF to an image, then save it as a PDF again. The only drawback is that the PDF will remove any OCR info it might have had.\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the PDF file to redact in Preview.\n\n*Black out text using any method you want (e.g. use the rectangle annotation tool with black as the color and choose the thickest border. Then draw the shape as many times as needed until your document is blacked out.)\n\n*File > Save As, and choose an image format such as PNG or GIF.\n\n*Open the saved image file, then File > Save As, and choose PDF.\n\n\nA: If you are looking for a no-cost way in Preview.app\n\n\n*\n\n*File->Export (or save as)\n\n*Export PDF to TIFF file format (it's a multipage image format)\n\n*Open TIFF file\n\n*Export TIFF to PDF file format\n\n\nMaintains page structure, OCR will be lost.\n\nA: Big Sur’s Preview now has a Tools / Redact menu item that specifically deletes the content being redacted when the document is closed.

Actually, it even seemed to muck up the text in a live pdf document so you couldn’t copy what was under the redaction. … I can’t say how much I’d trust this feature with sensitive live text. I scanned all of my documents to PDF with no OCR before I did my redaction. Then, I printed to PDF to add one more layer of separation to make sure nobody could see what was behind the redactions.\n\n\nA: I tried saving my image as an image in preview and this only works if your pdf is one page.  If it's multiple pages, exporting as an image will only save the first page.\nThe solution I found was this (it's a bit tedious, but you can get through it pretty fast once you get the hang of it):\nOpen PDF in GIMP (free photo editor) as an image.  Only open those pages that need redaction.  When you open it as an image, it essentially flattens the pdf so you're no longer able to highlight and copy text.  \nUse tools in GIMP to black out text.\nThen, file -> print.  On the print screen, choose \"Print Preview\".  This will bring up the pdf in Preview where you can export/save the file.\nIf you have more than once page, then you can choose the thumbnail view in Preview and drag/drop the pdfs onto one another to form a larger document that you can then print.  This is what I do when I have to sign just a few pages of a large pdf document.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: Open your PDF or image.\nUse the line tool or whatever to make your redactions.\nThen File>Print. Instead of printing to paper, save it as a PDF. Doing it this way causes the black lines or boxes to no longer be clickable. If you just \"save as\" a new PDF, the boxes remain able to be manipulated,\n\nA: PDF Studio version 8 has a manual redaction tool built-in its content editing tool. It is real redaction that actually removes content. It can select text and images in the PDF document content and redact them.\nPDF Studio version 9 (coming March 2014) will have a full fledged redaction feature where users can select an area on a document, and it will redact any images or text intersecting with this area. \nPDF Studio works on Mac (including 10.9 Mavericks) but also Windows and Linux and the same license key can be used on 2 different computers with different OS.\nhttp://www.qoppa.com/pdfstudio/ \n\nA: The subject of redation of PDF files seems to be a difficult subject concerning programming. As Acrobat Pro CD is much to expensive for me as a private non-profit user, I was looking for an alternativ. It took me rather long time to find a real good alternative to Acrobat Pro: \n\n\n*\n\n*PDF Studio PRO from Qoppa (http://www.qoppa.com/pdfstudio/): This tool really gives you virtually the whole functionality of Acrobat Pro. It is a solid part of software and according to my extensive tests the only tool that is really able to redact safely PDF files. Note that you need the PRO version, as the standard version lacks the ability of redaction. \n\n\nI tried several other possibilities, which all don't work properly: \n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Preview: this application allows to visually hide parts of a pdf behind a box, but it is always possible to remove the box or copy / paste the text behind as the sensitive information is NOT removed from the file!\n\n*PDF Pen: PDF Pen seems to be a nice tool and it offers a nice reaction functionality - seems to at least. Be careful about this tool: it messes up your PDFs completely as you redact. Therefore the functionality is limited to a files who are by chance compatible with this tool. Especially in PDFs with pictures (i.e. all scanned files) PDF Pen has big problems and messes up your file so it gets irreversibly unusable. My contact with the support never brought a solution so far over a time of several weeks. \n\n*Nuance PDF Coneverter for Mac: I bougth this tool as it offers a redaction functionality. Unfortunately there is no trial version available, but the refunding worked fine without problems. As soon as I had the tool installed, I had to realise, that it was nothing else than PDF Pen under a different hood. Now you don't have to wonder, why PDF Pen is using the OCR engine of Nuance :-). For the record: PDF Pen = Nuance PDF Converter for Mac. Same errors while redacting as expected. Result: equally useless as PDF Pen. \nAs a simple summary I suggest you spend the $129 for PDF Studio PRO from Qoppa. \n", "Q: Upgrading a boot camp machine to Lion I have a Snow Leopard MacBook Air with Boot Camp installed. I'm thinking about upgrading to Lion, but I'm worried about all the software I have installed on my Boot Camp partition.

I bought my 13\" MacBook Pro last March 27, 2011. It's 5 months old now. coconutBattery shows that I've lost 12% of the original battery capacity in just 5 months with 238 load cycles. I read in some of the questions here that one MacBook user just lost 1% of his battery capacity in 2 years! How could I have lost such a large percentage of my battery capacity in just 5 months?\n\nA: Battery life depends greatly on use. 238 charge cycles in 5 months by most standards is pretty high. More importantly if your following the guidelines Apple has published for their battery use are you getting usage times that are in line with their estimates? Coconut battery isn't always accurate, its best to trust the built-in tools for diagnostic information.\nYou can also check System Information (Lion) or System Profiler (10.6) under power to get an idea of the stats on the battery. Double check to see what your Full Charge Capacity and the Charge Cycles are. \nAny Apple Store or Authorized Service Provider can run diagnostics on the battery as stated by Wheat Williams. If it is faulty it's covered by your one year limited warranty.\nAlso check for run away processes you can check Activity Monitor, these could be draining the battery faster and driving up charge cycles.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/TS1473\n\nA: Because it is under warranty, take it to an Apple Store or other authorized repair facility and have the Genius Bar guys test the battery. If it fails during the warranty period, they will replace it for free. And consider buying that AppleCare extendend warranty package so you can get telephone tech support from Apple and so you can extend your warranty coverage for two more years.\nThe guys at your service center can explain to you about proper SMC reset and the battery conditioning procedure.\nThe only way to get warranty care is to go in and ask for it.\n\nA: All batteries have natural fluctuations in the voltage and charge capacity. Also, they all degrade over time based on three general things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Temperature ages batteries in a non-linear manner - exceptionally hot temperatures above (95F / 35C) will age them much faster and permanently damage them.\n\n*Each full charge cycle takes a little of the ability of the cell to accept a subsequent charge.\n\n*Batteries that fail prematurely are the exception, but most get flagged as faulty - so your mac will tell you to check your battery.\n\n\nLet's assume #3 isn't happening (and you can of course take it in for service any time you want a check up). It's more important to watch how fast your Full Charge Capacity is changing over time. \nDo read all the tips at http://www.apple.com/batteries/notebooks.html and do make sure to discharge it fully once a month.\nThe new batteries with adaptive charging circuitry no longer require end user calibration, so just follow the tips, keep an eye and replace it if needed or it fails to meet the specifications (80% FCC at 5 years / 1000 cycles) you might be eligible for a warranty exchange (keeping in mind AppleCare is 3 years - limited warranty one year might end before the 5 years design period.)\n\nA: This is some problem with spotlight indexing server.\nDisabling Spotlight in Snow Leopard solves this. Launch the Terminal and type the following command:\nsudo mdutil -a -i off\nVia OS X Daily\n", "Q: How can I sync iPhone photos one way? Is it possible to configure my iPhone to just send Photos I have taken with the camera to iPhoto without synchronizing additionally stored photos back to the phone?\n\nA: At first you should disable Photo sync in iTunes. When you open iPhoto, you should be able to select your iPhone on the left side (assuming it's connected to your Mac). Then you can select all pictures you need and import them (you will even be asked if they will be deleted from your iPhone after the import). This way the iPhone should not sync photos like it ususally does with iTunes (when enabled).\nSee this Apple KB article: Copying personal photos and videos from iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to your computer\nEDIT: You have to do this manually. I don't know if it's possible to do this automatically when syncing with iTunes.\n\nA: One way is this: plug in your phone, going to iTunes, click on the phone in the sidebar, and then click on the \"Photos\" tab. You'll see a \"Sync photos from iPhoto\" checkbox right at the top. Uncheck that. \nIf there are some photos that you'll want to carry around, one way to do that is to set up a manual photo album in iPhoto, and select that as the one photo album that you want to sync to the phone in iTunes. And obviously update that album as desired. I think that by default, your iPhone is set up to sync the \"last import\" photo album, which is how your photos are getting in. You can disable that in iTunes as above.\n\nA: Enable Photo Sync for your iPhone in iTunes, pick the second option (selected folders only) and don't select any folders/events/faces afterwards.\n", "Q: Mac OS X Lion Mail not sending Since upgrading to Mac OS X Lion, I consistently have issues sending mail from Mail.app. I can receive mail but when I send mail it stays in the outbox. Sometimes I can send the mail in the outbox by deleting it, rebooting my MacBook Pro, and then recreate the message and send it out.\nDoes anyone have a solution?\n\nA: These problems usually come down to one of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have incorrectly configured the log-in settings for your outgoing mail server run by the company that provides your email service. Port numbers, authentication method, user name, password, and other settings.\n\n*The problem is on the end of the company that provides your email service. Their servers are misbehaving.\nIn either case, call the tech support line of the company that provides your email service and have them troubleshoot it with you.\n\nA: Use Activity when you send to see what happening. If nothing obvious shows up you could archive your mailboxes, and removed the account and re-added it,.\nYou could also rename the ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist to com.apple.mail.plist_backup and re-open Mail.\n", "Q: Windows taskbar in Parallels VM I'm running Windows 7 in Coherance mode in Parrellels desktop, and have the task bar visible at the bottom of the screen.\n\nIs it possible to move the task bar down, behind the Mac Dock, without turning on Dock hiding?\nLike this:\n\n\nA: As far as I know, you cannot, because the dock tells the window server to reduce the windows max height to : screen height - dock current unmagnified size. \nSo the taskbar (which is in a window), is automatically placed on top on the dock. \n", "Q: Is it possible to enable \"Focus follows Scrolling\"? I tried out Focus follows mouse and found too many occasions when it really annoys me. Thinking about the cases when I would need focus follows mouse, I realized that it's only necessary when I'm scrolling in a non-active window. \nSo: Is there the possibility of having the focus switch to a window in that I scroll? Either via some setting or external application?\n\nA: I find that many applications already behave this way.  At least with a trackpad.\nIf I am working in this window, responding to your comment, and I hover over another Safari window, OR over my iTunes window, I can scroll without clicking on the other window.\nMy computer is not set to Focus follows mouse.\nIt may well be that some applications do not support this... \nDo you have a specific set of apps in mind?\n", "Q: Constant Firewall Messages in Console: How can I find the source? I constantly see messages in Console (coming from /var/log/appfirewall.log) that look like this:\nAug 21 08:08:39 silverscreen Firewall[97]: Stealth Mode connection attempt to UDP 10.0.1.11:8612 from 10.0.1.2:64755\n\nClick for a longer sample of the log.\nSo, it seems that some device on my network (10.0.1.2) is trying various ports to connect to my machine (and being refused).\nWhat tools does my Mac have to help me figure out what this device is and what it's trying to do?\n\nA: The command \"arp -an\" will list all the MAC addresses and IP addresses of all the devices seen on the local network.\nOnce you have the MAC address, you can look it up to determine the manufacturer of the device, which might give you a clue as to which one of your toys is talking to your machine.  One such lookup site is here:\nhttp://www.coffer.com/mac_find/\nUDP Port 8612 is sometimes associated with a Canon printer driver.\n", "Q: Using NFS between OSX and Ubuntu with mis-matched uids I have a fileserver running Ubuntu 10.04 I'd like to access via NFS from my Mac running 10.6.8. Problem is, while the usernames are the same, the uids are different.\nGoogling suggests that the past method of dealing with this was static uid mapping on the server end, but that seems to have been eliminated in NFSv4, which is the only version on 10.04 that I can find.\nIs there any way to map the uids so I can get proper NFS read/write access? Or do I have to change the uid on one of the machines? If so, what's the best and most fool-proof way to go about it. I'm concerned about borking permissions all over the place.\n\nA: Ultimately, the proper solution is to use a directory service (like NIS or LDAP) to provide consistent UID/GID mapping for all users.  Of course, this is a very heavy solution for a smaller and/or home network.\nThe easiest thing to do is to simply make the UIDs/GIDs consistent on all the hosts involved.\n\nA: You should look into using map_static on the server, as per: http://www.kernelcrash.com/blog/nfs-uidgid-mapping/2007/09/10/\nUpdate It appears that map_static isn't supported in Ubuntu any more. Not sure what to replace it with - possibly NFSv4 exports with idmapd.conf?\n", "Q: I administer a Mac OS X Server email server and it is down. Can you help? I hope this is a stupid question [with an obvious answer that I am missing] ...\nMy email services have suddenly stopped working and nothing I do seems to affect the problem.\nExisting mail accounts are broken.  New mail accounts can't be created because the account \"fails to access the [specified email server].  This happens on my local servers and on external servers.\nThis happens on both of my local machines, one running Leopard Server and the other running Snow Leopard Server.\nThe Network Utility ping function succeeds with \"support.apple.com\" but fails on \"apple.com\"\nHow could one work, but not the other?  Is this even related to my problem?\n\nA: The failed pings are completely unrelated to your mail issue. It is true that apple.com is blocking icmp traffic (ping uses icmp) and the endpoint at support.apple.com is not blocking this traffic. This is possible because each of those hostnames point to different servers/endpoints with different filtering rules on each.\n\nA: I consider these results from your ping commands completely normal.  When I try this, I get an IP for support.apple.com of 184.85.56.143, and an IP for apple.com of 17.149.160.49.  It's likely that the apple.com IP address is unreachable from the outside, or not even associated with a machine.  Note that if you put apple.com into a web browser, you're redirected to www.apple.com (for which ping reports an IP address of 184.85.61.15).  So instead of pinging apple.com, you should ping someknownhost.apple.com (such as support, www, developer).  Also note that due to caching services such as akamai, when you ping an apple.com host, you might end up pinging a machine hosted elsewhere.\nSo, explain more about your email issue!\n\nA: These problems usually come down to one of two things:\n1) The log-in settings for your outgoing mail server run by the company that provides your email service are not configured correctly in your email client program. Port numbers, authentication method, user name, password, and other settings--something is not quite right.\n2) The problem is on the end of the company that provides your email service. Their servers are misbehaving.\nIn either case, call the tech support line of the company that provides your email service and have them troubleshoot it with you.\n", "Q: Hidden character Shift-Arrow Up-Backspace Sometimes when I want to delete a line of text very quickly I do this:\nI hold the shift key and press the arrow up key to select the line above and then I press backspace. But occasionally I press all three keys at the same time which deletes the line too but creates a hidden control character with the value 08: the value for the backspace control character.\nThis can be pretty annoying e.g. if you are writing code and you can't figure out what causes the parse error.\nAm I the only one who struggles with this from time to time? Is it possible to change this behavior?\n\nA: I can't reproduce this either. However, I suggest that you hold down Command and then press Delete, as an alternative to your method. This will delete everything on the line that's left of the cursor, and will hopefully solve your problem. (You can hold down Option to delete single words. Experiment with holding down the Option or Command key, and pressing either Delete or the arrow keys. If you hold down Shift with either Option or Command and then press the arrow keys, you will be able to select text word by word, or line by line.)\n", "Q: Is there a way for Spotlight or Launchbar or Quicksilver or similar to just return matching folders not files? I frequently need to just get a finder window up that's a ton of folders deep.\nThere's only so many favorites you can put in the finder sidebar.\nI'd happily configure a dedicated launcher to just get me to folders by name and use one of the others for their normal purpose.\nI just can't figure out if any of them can be made to do this.\n\nA: The fastest way using spotlight is to add kind:folder to the search term in the spotlight field.\n\nYou can use booleans, metadata tags like kind:music or date:yesterday and more as described in Specifying criteria in the Spotlight search field\nI always forget about these and instead use the search window to build up a boolean criteria rather than use the default spotlight menu search (where all the other data detectors compete to provide you relevant matches)\nInstead of command+space try option+command+space\nThen click the circle + on the right by Save and override the \"Any\" with \"Folder\"\n\nI don't know a way to automate or save this further as the default, but it's a way that will work on all Macs.\n\nA: You can set Spotlight to list folders at the top of the list in the Spotlight preferences in System Prefs. You can also uncheck the other items in the list so only folders will show up in the results.\n\n\nA: I just tested this on my Mac running Snow Leopard and Quicksilver and it works the way I'd expect you'll like (with a minimum of fuss).\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a folder somewhere, and name it something meaningful (I created ~/Documents/launchfolders)\n\n*Put folders and/or shortcuts in there to the folders you want searchable.\n\n*Open Quicksilver and go to the Catalog\n\n*Click on the '+' icon to add a new item to the catalog, select 'File & Folder Scanner'\n\n*Browse to the folder you created and hit ok\n\n*Click the info 'i' icon at the bottom right corner of the catalog window. It should open up a drawer window with 3 tabs: 'Source Options', 'Contents' and 'Attributes'. \n\n*On the 'Source Options' tab, select 'Folder Contents' from the 'Include Contents' dropdown\n\n*Open 'Contents' & hit the refresh button next to the 'i' button & watch the window fill up and list the folders/shortcuts you put in your other folder.\n\n*Activate quicksilver (ctrl+space on my computer) and start typing in the name of one of your nested folders. Viola, you can pull up the directories. \n\n\nIf you don't want to hassle with curating a folder of shortcuts and you'd be ok with sticking a lot of items in your Quicksilver index, you can just do a File & Folder Scanner of any folder on your HD. You can even set the depth of the search on the 'Source Options' tab.\n\n\nA: Alfred can be configured to show only certain result types. I believe that its results will always include applications, but in my experience, the directories will percolate to the top after a few keystrokes.\n\nA: Alfred 0.9.9 has extensions now. One kind of extension that it supports is \"Search Filters\". For example, a filter that searches for only PDF files, or like in your case, a filter that searches for only folders.\nIt is very easy to create such a \"folders\" extension. Like this:\n\nYou can download this extension here.\n\nA: Find Any File\nis an app that has this function.\n\n", "Q: How to change MPM prefork to worker on default Apache OSX installation? On CentOS, the Apache configuration can be found in /etc/sysconfig/httpd\nHow to change MPM prefork to worker on default Apache OSX installation?\n\nA: i dont think its that easy with default apache, not without the risk of it reverting on a software update, the config files would be in /etc/apache2 though\nits probably simpler and more reliable to install something like macports and install apache2 from there, that way it will be persistent of apple software updates and much more flexible in configuration\n", "Q: Quicktime now reopens last video. How to avoid? It seems to be a new behavior in Lion but here is what is happening for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*I open a video file\n\n*Quicktime launches and play the video\n\n*When I'm done, I hit CmdQ\nNow, with Lion, when opening another video the same way, it opens but the previously opened one also...\nTo avoid this I have to do a CmdW before my CmdQ.\nI suppose it's linked to the General System Preference Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps.\nIf so, is there a way to deactivate it for some of the apps and not globally (as I must admit it's quite handy in other applications)?\n\nA: The NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows setting seems to work for me on QuickTimePlayer as well as with Preview. This undocumented setting seems to override any system wide preference.\n\n\n*\n\n*defaults write com.apple.QuickTimePlayer NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -int 0\nFor those that care - here is the syntax to set the same for Preview:\n\n\n*\n\n*defaults write com.apple.Preview NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -int 0\n\nA: This is not so much an answer as a suggestion, but here goes:  Try forgetting about Cmd-Q, at least for most things.  Lion has support for the automatic termination of apps if resources become constrained.  Most Apple-provided applications support this facility, and Quicktime is one of them.  It will quietly go away if it has no windows open and OS X decides that it is in the way.\nFor an example of this technology in action, you might try keeping Preview running with no windows open – it can be a real challenge, for some folks it quits as soon as they switch away from it  :-)\n\nA: In Mountain Lion, which I believe it's also there in Lion, go to System Preferences, General, check the checkbox that reads \"Close windows when quitting an application\". The bottom of that option also explains the following: 'When selected, open documents and windows will not be restored when you re-open an application'.\nIt worked for me. Quicktime stopped reopening the last video played.\n\nA: The shortcut CmdOptQ is for \"Quit and Discard Windows\" which will quit the app 'the old way', and not reopen the windows the next time it's launched. So if you only need to suppress this functionality some of the time, this is a good shortcut to know.\n", "Q: How Can I Clear the Website Loaded on Startup? On Mac OS Lion, apps seem to persist their state across launches. Generally, this is a good thing. However, I seem to have run into a problem. \nIn Safari, I must have typed quickly and hit enter after entering the letter W. Now, whenever I open Safari, it opens a window and immediately tries to reach http://w/, which is obviously not accessible. Not that it makes much of a difference, but I'd like to remove this persistence.\n\nHow can I remove the last opened window from Safari, so that it doesn't show this window on every launch?\n\nA: As far as I know, there is not currently a way to tell an app to never remember its state.\nYou can, however, control this on an individual quit basis. That should be enough for you to get Safari to forget http://w/. Here's how:\nGo to the Safari menu. Hold down the option key. You'll see Quit Safari change to Quit and Discard Windows. Click this item.\nNow, reopen Safari. It should go straight to your homepage instead of to the page that was open when you quit.\nIf that doesn't work, it is possible that you've somehow set http://w/ to be your homepage. To change this, go to Safari-> Preferences-> General.\n\nA: Have you tried holding the shift key when launching Safari? \nJust as holding shift when booting makes it load less (Safe Boot) and holding shift while you log in won't start the apps that normally start, the same reasoning here makes safari not re-open the windows it normally would.\nIt's really not that useful in practice. If you have some odd sites up when you quit Safari - of course you could remember to hold option down when you are quitting Safari.\nThis changes Quit Safari into Quit and Discard Windows - but it's not as easy to discard the windows when safari isn't actually running. (Kind of like you can go in and edit the bookmarks when Safari is closed, but most people do it while the program is running)\nI'm not good enough to remember things the next time I start Safari - so I just close it and move on...\n", "Q: Where can I buy a spare power cable for a i5 Mac Mini?

What good products are there available that you recommend checking out?\n\nA: I've tried them all and RealVNC is the best by far. Anything else either lacks important functionality or lags miserably. I recommend you try them all though and decide for yourself; it really comes down to what level of remote control you're looking to have.\n\nA: This is a full list I found on Wikipedia comparing remote desktop software.\n\nA: VNC\nRecent versions of Mac OS X include a VNC server built-in, analogous to Microsoft's Remote Desktop Server (included in Windows). This can be accessed via the System Preferences > Sharing > Apple Remote Desktop option.\nThere are various free VNC clients available for Windows, most notably RealVNC.\nWhile there are other options, VNC benefits from being a very mature graphical remote-access protocol with official support from Apple and good-quality client programs.\n\nA: For quick helpdesk applications I use Teamviewer (https://www.teamviewer.com/)\n\nA: I highly recommend LogMeIn.  It is the fastest remote access program to Mac I've tested.\n\nA: I'm currently using TightVNC to do the same thing.  Lately it has started randomly dropping my connections though.  I can get them back easily enough, but it's very annoying.

Mac OS X Lion introduced a new feature where in many applications you can press  (Command-Control-D) to produce a popup with the definition for the word under the mouse cursor. A side effect of this is that you can no longer use the same shortcut to access functionality in other applications (for example, Emacs).\nIs it possible to either\na) disable the word definition Command-Control-D keyboard shortcut, or \nb) change the word definition keyboard shortcut to something other than Command-Control-D?\n\nA: Yes, through System Preferences, you can change and disable keyboard shortcuts.  Go to System Prefs -> Keyboard -> and hit the tab Keyboard Shortcuts.  Click the Services entry, and scroll down to the Searching set of shortcuts.  Uncheck the lookup in dictionary to disable it, or double click the space to the right to change the shortcut.  \n\nA: To disable the Control-Command-D binding enter the following in the terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.symbolichotkeys AppleSymbolicHotKeys -dict-add 70 '<dict><key>enabled</key><false/></dict>'\n\nand restart.\n\nA: In Lion specifically, System Preferences / Keyboard / Keyboard Shortcuts / Searching / Look Up in Dictionary will allow you to assign an additional shortcut keystroke to do a Dictionary lookup, but it won't disable Command-Control-D for other applications to use.\nIn Snow Leopard, the same Command-Control-D lookup is available, but it can be reassigned by the user.\nI hope this is just seen as a bug to correct in an update rather than a new 'feature'.

No idea though how you might have gotten there. Is it the first time your iTunes app behaves this way?\nAnd I assume you are in North America... this would discard the idea that the interface is location-aware.\nMaybe deinstalling and reinstalling iTunes?

In recent months my macbook has been steadily running slower.\nIt's about 2 years old and gets heavy use so my initial suspicions are that maybe the hard drive is starting to get old. I used the disk utility and it said the disk was fine though. \nI dont have an especially large amount of applications running at a time, about 4-6 (plus whatever background stuff is going on). \nAs you can see I am more or less speculating, is there a tried and tested way of diagnosing this stuff before I put in an SSD (can the Apple retail stores do this for me?).\nCheers\n\nA: In my experience Apple stores won't really do that kind of work, you may be better off taking it to an authorised service centre for that kind of thing.\nYou can use Activity Monitor (found in Utilities folder) to monitor disk activity. This will give you an idea of how quickly the drive is shifting data to and from its platters. You'd then need to research to see if the throughput you're getting is below par or normal. \nAnother thing to check would be CPU and RAM usage, checking these when the system is performing badly can give you an idea of what's slowing you down (assuming that it's software hogging your CPU/RAM).\nIt may also be worth checking the Console (also found in Utils folder) to see if any applications or services are spamming any (error) messages, these apps/services may be causing slowdowns by hogging system resources.\nAnother (far less innocuous) troubleshooting step could be to do an archive and install of your system (which basically keeps all your files and settings but installs a fresh copy of the system) and see if performance improves.\n", "Q: How do you search a non-indexed folder in Finder?

I want to remove part of the text in the filenames. I want to remove the text that appears after a specific series of characters that I know will always appear in the filename. But I do not know how many characters will appear before or after the known series of characters. I also don't know if the before or after text will contain multiple periods or dashes. An example would probably help:\nThe.Big.Bang.Theory.S01E01.xxxxxxxx.mp4\nI know that each file will always contain a string in the format of SxxExx where the x's are always numbers. But I do not know what the numbers will be. I want to get the filename up to and including the SxxExx string and the file extension but strip out everything else. So for the above example I would end-up with:\nThe.Big.Bang.Theory.S01E01.mp4\nI have tried using bash's built-in string replacement commands. I thought the expr index command would give me the integer start point of the SxxExx string and then I could use ${filename:offset:length} to extract only the required part of the filename (i already know the extension so that can be re-added). But it seems the OS X version of expr doesn't include the index functionality. I have only scripted in Basic and LotusScript before. In those environments this would have been fairly easy using commands such as 'Like' and 'Instr' or 'Mid'. But in bash I just can't figure it out. I have spent hours googling trying to understand how to use regular expressions to locate the 'SxxExx' substring in the filename but I just can't figure it out. I hope some clever UNIX scripters will be able to help me!\n\nA: With bash only: \nfor filename in *; do\n    if [[ \"$filename\" =~ (.*S[0-9][0-9]E[0-9][0-9]).*(\\....)$ ]]; then\n        echo mv \"$filename\" \"${BASH_REMATCH[1]}${BASH_REMATCH[2]}\"\n    fi\ndone\n\nRemove the \"echo\" when you're satisfied it's working.\n\nA: ls | perl -nl -e '/(.*)(S[0-9]+E[0-9]+).*(\\.mp4)/ && print \"mv \\\"\" . $_ . \"\\\" \\\"\". $1 . $2 . $3 . \"\\\"\"'\n\nHow does this work? First ls outputs the list of files, one per line, like so:\nThe.Big.Bang.Theory.S01E01.xxxxxxxx.mp4\nThe.Big.Bang.Theory.S01E02.somecrap.mp4\nThe.Big.Bang.Theory.S04E12.otherjunk.mp4\n\nThen perl -nl splits this into lines, feeding each to the regex, much like awk*. The regex captures 3 groups (denoted by parentheses), first the bit before SxxEyy, then that, then the file suffix. It then simply assembles a mv command suitable for renaming the files, like so:\nmv \"The.Big.Bang.Theory.S01E01.xxxxxxxx.mp4\" \"The.Big.Bang.Theory.S01E01.mp4\"\nmv \"The.Big.Bang.Theory.S01E02.somecrap.mp4\" \"The.Big.Bang.Theory.S01E02.mp4\"\nmv \"The.Big.Bang.Theory.S04E12.otherjunk.mp4\" \"The.Big.Bang.Theory.S04E12.mp4\"\n\nThis can then be inspected and once you're satisfied it does what you want, piped into a shell by appending: | sh.\n*awk would normally be a good tool to use for this, but sadly only GNU awk supports regex capture groups and Mac OS X doesn't include gawk by default.\n", "Q: Increase horizontal speed scroll on Logitech Mouse I have a Logitech Mouse with a horizontal-scroll-enabled scroll wheel (it tilts left and right to scroll left and right) the only problem is that the scroll speed is very very slow to a point it is not worth using.\nThe normal mouse settings do not appear to alter the scroll speed at all.\n\nA: Download the Logitech Control Center here. It will allow you to change the settings.\n", "Q: How do you install Adobe AIR on an ipad Adobe AIR does not appear in the App Store - this is Australia, on an iPad 2.\nAre there geographic restrictions - surely it isn't sideloaded?\n\nA: Given your comment on Adam Rice's answer. I believe that you're mistaken about how one would use Air with an iOS device.\nYou don't actually put Air on the device. You write your app with Air, then use Adobe's packager to turn it into a native iOS app.\n\nA: You don't.\nThere aren't geographic restrictions: there are universal restrictions. As is the case with Flash—or pretty much anything that can interpret arbitrary code—Apple is not going to allow Air onto iOS.\n", "Q: Converting WAV to MP3 using LAME and Automator I'd like to convert many WAV files to MP3 files using LAME and Automator. I need a script that I could right click a folder and convert all the WAV files inside the folder to MP3 files. I've been able to find a script to convert single file but I don't know how to modify it so I could convert many files with a single click. \nI've been using script which I found here for single files. Here is a similar question but instead of using \"Run Applescript\" it uses \"Run Shell Script\". I've tried to replace LAME parameters between \"do\" and \"done\" but haven't succeeded to convert anything.\nSo, how could I convert folder full of WAV files to MP3 files? For me it doesn't matter is it done by using Applescript or Shell Script in Automator if both ways are possible.\n\nA: Automator 'hangs' when attempting to use LAME encoder unfortunately. It's also not efficient or advisable to try and use a multi-threaded process as an Automator Service. For tasks such as this it's best to either run a simple script or use an alternate method.\nThe script below will encode a 20Mb .wav to .mp3 in 3 seconds! (at the highest quality settings)\nfile=\"$1\"\n\nfind . -name '*.wav' -maxdepth 1 -exec /usr/local/bin/lame -V 0 -q 0 '{}' \\;\n\nfor file in *.mp3\ndo\n  mv \"$file\" \"${file/wav./}\"\ndone\n\n\nTo install, download, then open terminal:\nsudo install encode-mp3 /usr/local/bin\nTo use, navigate into a desired conversion folder and type:\nencode-mp3\n\nThis will encode your .wav files to .mp3\nConvert .wav to .mp3 | LAME Encoder Shell Script\n[md5: 72d4e24f14ea9139136900f2c4281a7f]\n\n\n[original]\nI just wrote a one-liner that will do this for you in Terminal, just\n  cd to the directory of files you want to convert and enter:\nfind ./ -name \"*.wav\" -execdir lame -V 3 -q 0 {} \\;\n\n\n\nA: You can use the following in Automator's \"Run Shell Script\" action (make sure to change \"Pass input\" to \"as arguments\"):\nfind \"$1\" -name \"*.wav\" -execdir /usr/local/bin/lame -V 0 -q 0 {} \\;\n\nThis will find all .wav files in the selected folder, including sub-folders (and skip over any non-wav files). If you don't want it to look into sub-folders, you can change it to this:\nfind \"$1\" -name \"*.wav\" -maxdepth 1 -execdir /usr/local/bin/lame -V 0 -q 0 {} \\;\n\nOf course, you would change -V 0 -q 0 to whatever lame options you prefer.\nIf you want to be notified when it's done, you can add a say command, use a \"Show Growl Notification\" action (if you have Growl installed), or use a beep command in a \"Run AppleScript\" action.\nBelow is a screenshot of what my workflow looks like with the extra say command and the Growl notification. Also notice I changed the \"Service receives selected\" option at the top to \"folders\" (it will be \"text\" by default). \n\n\nA: The thread is a bit updated, but for those who may find it useful,\nI used Automator setup described here, and was able to avoid getting it stuck with -S option of lame, so my \"Run Shell Script\" command looks like: \n    find \"$1\" -name \"*.wav\" -maxdepth 1 -execdir /usr/bin/lame -b 160 -q 0 -S {} \\;\n\n(besides, my lame exec is in another place)\nThe -S option turns off Lames progress report\n", "Q: How to enforce backup of an .ipa from iPad to iTunes/Mac? Usually, all the .ipas are backup up in the ~/Music/iTunes/Mobile Applications folder. I accidentally deleted an .ipa in the folder.

I've tried changeip in the terminal as well, as well as flushed DNS in case it was cached there as well.\nHow do I get Lion to reach out to the WWW to find this domain?\n\nA: I was able to fix this by removing this from /etc/named.conf\nI'm now able to navigate to example.com.\nzone \"example.com\" IN {\n    type master;\n    file \"db.example.com\";\n    allow-transfer {\n        none;\n    };\n    allow-update {\n        none;\n    };\n};\n\n\nA: In terminal enter:\nhostname -fs\n\nThat will tell you the hostname of your machine.

I have a bunch of video files (FLV and MOV), some with alpha channels and some without.\nHow can I efficiently know the ones that have an alpha channel?\n\nA: Exiftool should report all clips with alpha channels as 32 bit:\nexiftool -bitdepth /path/to/your/movie.mov\n\nYou can of course specify wildcards when calling exiftool:\nexiftool -bitdepth *.mov\n\nMedia Inspector may do this as well if you prefer a GUI app.\n\nA: Another way is to use ffprobe. Here is an example adapted from this answer, to show it for every .mov file in the current directory:\n\nfor f in *.mov; do\n    pixfmt=$(ffprobe -v 0 -select_streams v:0 -show_entries stream=pix_fmt -of compact=p=0:nk=1 \"$f\")\n    alpha=$(ffprobe -v 0 -show_entries pixel_format=name:flags=alpha -of compact=p=0  | grep \"$pixfmt|\" | grep -oP \"(?<=alpha=)\\d\")\n    if (( alpha )); then\n        echo \"With alpha: $f\"\n    else\n        echo \"no : $f\"\n    fi\ndone\n\nSee the original answer for details on how it works.\n", "Q: How should I troubleshoot Wi-fi timeout issues? I am having some Wi-fi issues at home and am looking for some advice on how to troubleshoot it. \nThe setup. \nComcast Modem connected to Airport Extreme Basestation which has a NAS drive and MacMini hardwired to, and my Macbook Pro which connects via Wi-fi. \nThe problem. \nMy internet will work for a couple minutes to 10 minutes and then I start getting lots of timeout errors. \nThings I have tried. \nMy laptop's Wi-fi works perfectly all day at the office. \nHardwiring my laptop into the Comcast Modem internet works fine. \nUnplugging the Basestation from the modem local network works fine, (swapped some filed around between machines) \nAnyone have any ideas what is going on? Or what else I should be checking?\n\nA: You don't say what OS you are using but I would suggest looking at the LAN to see if there is any WiFi channel or address conflict with your en1 connection (Mac mini airport or NAS?); also check that the AP has a channel that does not conflict with a nearby neighbor and is at least 2 channels away from its nearest competitor (if AP is 6, any neighbors should be 8 or 4). After that, try deleting your connection on the laptop and adding the AP and network info including the DNS. \nYou might also check that your LAN AP is the first in line in preferred networks and that there is no other Bluetooth, FireWire, etc. network enabled.\n\nA: Is the problem that your internet connection drops out (but you're still connected properly to the Airport) - or that your connection to the Airport drops out?\nIn the former case: speak with your ISP.  Could be a modem issue or a much likelier option, a DNS problem.\nIn the latter: How far away are you?  Measure the signal strength with a tool like iStumbler.  How many walls does the signal have to pass through?  Export the Airport settings, wipe the device and restore the settings.\n", "Q: iPod Touch, HD video app Dim Screen?

I'm looking to turn an old Mac laptop into a \"car-puter\". However, I don't want to drain the battery on either the laptop or the car. Is there a way to configure it so that the computer automatically wakes up when plugged into power? (I know that it can be woken via ethernet, but I don't know how I can turn that to my advantage.)\nMy specific use case is a late-model PowerBook G4 running 10.5, but I'm also curious about whether this can be done with other models or OS versions. Thanks!\n\nA: As you indicated, this does depend on the specifics of the hardware - but the pmset acwake command is used to read or change the intended wake on power change status for a Mac.\nThe man page for pmset goes into some detail how to use this command line tool to change settings.\nI couldn't find a reference that calls out which models work with this setting - you may have to experiment or do some more research.\n", "Q: How can I record video of the iPhone screen without jailbreaking the phone? Is it possible to record video of the iPhone screen, and if so how?  I'm talking about video screen capturing, not using a camcorder or any app that requires jailbreaking my phone.\n\nA: Don't overlook the power of running things in the iOS simulator. Xcode is free for Lion users. This is a very limited solution since you aren't really on the iPhone and you can't run app store apps, since its running computer versions of the apps, not the ones you download from iTunes.\nBeing a paid developer allows some extra flexibility in capturing the screen while tethered, but this might be an alternate.\nUntil this becomes a feature, you'll be stuck with this and the other options you have ruled out - a real camera or jail breaking to modify the code and get a dump of the screen.\n\nA: If you have an iPhone 4S or iPad 2 you can use mirroring to an Apple TV, then connect the Apple TV to something that can capture its output. No jailbreaking required.\n\nA: As a previous commenter mentioned, video output is an option.\nThis appears to be available on the newer iOS devices (when loaded with iOS 4.x and later).\nCheck out this article from Apple about video out for iOS devices. You'll need a VGA adaptor for your device. You'd then be able to feed the video signal into another device that can record the signal.\nSo, you don't necessarily need to jailbreak to do this.\n\nA: If you have a iPhone 4S or iPad 2, you could use the dock to digital video adapter into a video capture card.\nThe downside to this is the expense of purchasing extra hardware.\n", "Q: Is there a way to make Windows-style SMB share paths launch correctly? We have a mixed Windows/Mac network, with Windows fileservers, and an Exchange/Outlook mailsystem.\nThe Windows users send out emails with links to the shared files that look like:\n\\\\FileServer01\\topfolder\\subfolder\\shared.doc\n\nIf you right-click on the link in Mac Outlook 2010, it seems to have a pseudo-URL of:\nfile://///FileServer01/topfolder/subfolder/shared.doc\n\nMac Outlook 2010 makes that link clickable, but fails with an error:\nThe file ///FileServer01/topfolder/subfolder/shared.doc could not be found.\n\nGiven that we're not going to be able to get people to stop copy-pasting in Mac-unfriendly SMB links, is there any way to get the Finder or some handler to rewrite the URL into something the Mac can open?\n\nA: I'm in a similar position at work, with a mixed environment. We use WinShortcutter, which is freeware. The allows you to right-click on a UNC path (such as \\\\FileServer01\\topfolder\\subfolder\\shared.doc) and Open as Windows Link:\n\nIt's quite configurable as well, and allows drive mappings (so when you are sent a link that starts S:/folder, it will allow you to Open as Windows Link).\n\nThis works quite reliably for us.\n\nA: I came across the similar problem at work and we found a 3rd party app for this:\nlinkconverter\nit works pretty well, especially rightclicking on a file on an UNC Drive the pathname is directly in the clipboard and you get the windows path instantly.\n\nA: Short answer: no.  Long answer:  Maybe, if Outlook support plugins or something.  Macs will refer to a Samba server share as smb://Server/Share/Subfolder/File.ext.  What you could do - copy the link, minus the junk at the beginning, so that you have something like this in your clipboard - \"FileServer01/topfolder/subfolder/shared.doc\".\nSwitch to finder, hit cmd+k, paste, move to the beginning of the line and type smb://, hit enter.  It will drop down to the last folder before the \"shared.doc\".\nNot elegant, not pretty, but it works.  And for now it may just be your only option, sorry.\n\nA: In recent (Mojave 10.14 - Catalina 10.15) versions of macOS Finder, you can easily get a copy of the network volume path:\nEdit->Copy as Link with control & option ^⌥⌘-C puts a link akin to the following example into the clipboard:\nsmb://someserver/Share%20on%20some%20server/file.ext\n\n\nA: In 10.8 there is functionality to do this built-in... so in a sense your wishes have been granted provided you can migrate to the newer operating systems. I can imaging the support for this will only get better with 10.9.\n\nA: I was using 10.8 and have been sending links from my pc to our mac user as such---\nsmb://video/videoshare/folder/  \nOriginally I was sending them \n\\\\video\\videoshare\\folder\\   --- This would still work, they would have to perform a right click then select open url and it would open the location.\nNow we are on 10.9.3 and the ablilty to open a samba network link in outlook 2010 seems to have vanished without a trace.  I send it the way I have been for mac users and now they can't click on the link to open.   They have to do a right click and then open url and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. \n", "Q: Special Characters window no longer resizable in OS X Lion I upgraded my Mac Pro to OS X Lion (now 10.7.1) a few weeks ago, and am mostly very happy with it. The edge-resizing of Windows is especially nice.\nStill, the Special Characters app, which used to have a resizable window from the lower right corner, now has no resizing available at all.\nIs there any way to alter this behavior to make this window resizable, or do I just need to wait till Apple recognizes this problem and fixes it? \n\nA: You can resize the window, but it's different than most windows in Lion.\nIf you click and drag a corner or an edge, the window will resize. Yes, it doesn't look like you can use the corners, but they do work.\nThis appears to work with every corner except the top left, which is blocked by the close button. Edit: Actually, if you aim just right (to the top left of the close button) you can use that corner too.\nTo summarize: Things still work, but the active areas are tiny. You just have to be careful.\nThis behavior is strange, and seems buggy to me. I expect than a future update will fix this and allow you to resize by all the corners and edges.\n", "Q: Will a standard MacBook Pro optical-bay HDD caddy fit a non-unibody MacBook Pro? I have an early 2008 A1226 15\" MacBook Pro Santa Rosa (ie non-unibody), and I want to put an HDD in the optical bay (replacing my original HDD with an SSD). There are caddies like this that might do the trick, but they never specify my older (non-unibody) MacBook Pro version exactly. I'm wondering if that will actually fit, or if there's a better alternative that's fairly cheap. Optibay sells one specifically for non-unibody here but at $100 it's 5x the price.\n\nA: The optical drive in a non-unibody MacBook Pro uses a PATA interface, so you would need to go with the MCE or iFixit caddy, both of which use an interconnect board to convert from SATA on the HD side to PATA on the logic board side. \nThe caddy on Amazon needs a SATA connection on the logic board side, so it will only work in a unibody MacBook Pro.\n\nA: Based on the pictures of that specific drive it will work. It has the screw holes on the sides. You'll need the SATA connector cable from the old drive and the brackets from the old as well. \nIt will look something like this. \nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/manwhoyells/6020598352/in/photostream/\niFixIt has a caddie as well.\nhttp://www.ifixit.com/Apple-Parts/9-5-mm-Optical-Bay-SATA-Hard-Drive-Enclosure/IF107-078\n\nA: After some research, wondering why non-unibody caddies should be 3-to-4 times the price, I found this site, which does an excellent job of explaining why their caddies are good and why you need a pata vs sata caddy for the non-unibody MacBook Pro.  \nThe optical drive has a pin (or PATA interface) at the rear, instead of a card-type (or SATA interface). The enclosures look pretty much the same. Here is an overview of what I found:  \n\n\n*\n\n*At this time, OWC doesn't offer any non-unibody caddy\n\n*MCE prices theirs at $50 plus about $10 shipping\n\n*ifixit is $60 plus (presumably) shipping, \n\n*and finally this product his total cost is under $50 (including shipping). \n\n\nAfter all this research, I think I'm still gonna wait, or look for a PATA interfaced caddy on ebay...\nUPDATE: I found a non-unibody MBP drive enclosure on eBay for $12 (including shipping).\nIf it fits, I'm gone. If it doesn't work, I'll let you know. \n\nA: In theory, this should work - the caddy appears to be the same size/shape as a regular optical drive. However, pre-univody MacBook Pros have a special set of metal brackets that screw into the ODD to hold it in place, and I'm not certain if the first product you listed will be able to accommodate them. You can see what I'm talking about in Steps 12-14 of iFixit's Optical Drive Replacement guide for this model.\nI'd imagine that the one that's listed as specifically for that model would have taken this into consideration.\n", "Q: Does Bootcamp support 64 bit version of Windows 7? I have just purchased a Macbook Pro which will run OS X Lion. Which version of Windows can I run in Bootcamp? 64 or 32 bit? Both?\n\nA: Version 4.0 of Bootcamp for Lion, released July 20, 2011, drops support for all versions of Windows XP and Vista.\nIt supports 32-bit or 64-bit Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium, Professional, or Ultimate.\nBoot Camp 4.0 FAQ from Apple Support.\n\nA: You can run Windows 7 in either 32- or 64-bit versions. \n", "Q: Is there a way to differentiate between paid and free apps in iTunes purchase history? I want to know what apps I've paid money for, as opposed to free apps that were downloaded. \nI need to know this because I gave my little brother my old 3GS to use as an iPod which remains attached to my iTunes account because he doesn't have a credit card or an income in order set up an account. I notice that he downloads a lot of apps, games in particular, and I'm worried because I've tried a few that seem like they could easily charge for. I often download apps that I pay for, so often that I wouldn't know if he was buying things without my knowledge. \nEvery now and then I notice a charge from iTunes that I don't remember making, so I need to know what I've paid for. Is there a way to show what apps I've actually spent money on?\n\nA: In addition to keeping your email receipts, you can also view your entire purchase history by viewing your account in iTunes. If you're signed in, click your account name in the top right, and choose the \"View Account\" option. On the following screen, the third section down shows \"Purchase History\", with a link on the right to see all your orders. You can see each order, listed chronologically, and jump to specific months and get more detail about a specific order.\n\nA: You have to save and process your email receipts to know what you paid. (or somehow scrape the history from within iTunes) - it's simply not an option you can sort currently. \nSince prices change on the store, some other solution that doesn't involve your paid balance being shown isn't a tool that has been provided. \nMany have asked for this since it makes so much sense for a variety of use cases -- in addition to the situation you find yourself in. Unless you have the ear of someone that works in the iTunes store, http://apple.com/feedback is the best way to agitate for change. \n", "Q: Directories being shared without being on the file sharing list I'm having an issue with file sharing in Lion using the default system pref pane. Although the list shows no share points, i can see that my home folder, and Macintosh HD are being shared, despite my empty list. Does anyone know how to 'reset' ALL file sharing options, or possible the .plist file associated with sharing services on the mac.\n\nA: The simple act of clicking the \"File Sharing\" check box will allow the following things to happen.\n\n\n*\n\n*Any user account can connect to the machine and access their own home folder, as well as the public folders on any other user account.\n\n*Any administrator users can access the boot disk.\n\n\nThe list of shared folders in the preference pane is for fine-tuning access to public folders and defining customized share points.\nYou can fine-tune the basic share points with Mac OS X Lion Server, which is available as a software package from the App Store nowadays. It's not terribly practical to try to hack this yourself on the command line. While it may be possible to just mess with the server daemon's configuration files, it may be more trouble than its worth when you could just disable the built-in server and install Netatalk.\nReally, the easiest option if you just want to open up parts of your computer to specific logins, would be to create \"sharing only\" user accounts, allow them access to specific share points that you manually define in System Preferences, and disallow them access to the public folders.\n", "Q: \"-bash: ls: command not found\" I installed the most recent update to OS X Lion (10.7). After I did that, my terminal won't recognize normal commands. I typed ls and got:\n-bash: ls: command not found\n\nI figured I'd try to add usr/bin to my path, but I can't find .bash_profile to edit it since typing edit .bash_profile won't work. I can't set the Finder to show all files since my terminal won't recognize the commands necessary to do that. \nwhat do I need to do?\n\nA: Since two commands are missing something “stomped” your path.\nBefore doing anything big, kicking off a backup might be prudent.\nThe default path for bash shell  on Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) is something like this:\nPATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin\n\nIf you reset the path by typing the above into a shell window, and then typing export PATH it should manually let you test a local fix contained to that window only.\nThis breakage is almost always something you need to fix in your dot files. For bash, edit and fix .bash_profile and/or .bashrc by undoing a recent change it just setting the $PATH you need again. The usual error is assigning a new path and not referring to the previous value of the variable on the right hand side of the =\nIf you are totally out of luck, commenting out most of the lines from your dot files and then getting a good path before reworking the customizations is a good plan.\n\nA: It sounds to me as if /etc/profile wasn't run at shell startup. It's the global startup file responsible for initializing PATH. Check whether /etc/profile exists and is readable and executable with the following command:\n. /etc/profile\n\nIf it isn't there, you'll need to restore it from a backup or another machine with Lion installed, or install Lion again. If it exists but isn't executable, try using Disk Utility to Repair Disk Permissions.\nIf it does exist and is executable (and it contains some code), either it may not be getting run when it's supposed to or your startup script may somehow be overriding it. As a workaround, try putting . /etc/profile at the start of your ~/.bash_profile to ensure it is run. If you still encounter the problem, add echo $PATH after running it to see if PATH was initialized properly. If it was, something in your script is changing it.\nHere's the default contents of /etc/profile:\n# System-wide .profile for sh(1)\n\nif [ -x /usr/libexec/path_helper ]; then\n    eval `/usr/libexec/path_helper -s`\nfi\n\nif [ \"${BASH-no}\" != \"no\" ]; then\n    [ -r /etc/bashrc ] && . /etc/bashrc\nfi\n\npath_helper constructs the default PATH. You could try running\nunset PATH; /usr/libexec/path_helper -s\n\nto see what it produces.\nIn any case, if the problem isn't in your startup script(s), please contact Apple support http://www.apple.com/support/contact/ or report a bug at https://bugreport.apple.com/ to let Apple know there's a problem.\n\nA: To check that it is indeed a problem with your path, what's the result of /bin/ls ? \nIf it works, than you should restore your path to /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin, you can use for example VI whose path is (on my mac) /usr/bin/vi.\n\nA: I thought of sharing the mistake that led me to this error - at least in my case,\nWhen I added a new PATH in ~/.bash_profile, I forgot to add :$PATH at the end of the path that I just added. \nI used the temporary fix ( the following command in the terminal) that masters here have already pointed out to get back to bash_profile since I could not use vi commands to open it in the first place. \nexport PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin\n\nOnce I got in, I rectified my mistake. \n(Negative data matters!)\n\nA: This should fix the problem completely and permanently.\nfirst, export environment paths by using below command in the terminal.\nexport PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/b‌​in\n\nnow you have the commands you want.

Now try the commands. \n\nA: This is likely not your problem at a fresh begin, but I had added PATH=xyz/ in my .env file and wondered why I could not use ls right after running source .env. Clearly because I overwrote my PATH variable, and it was back as soon as I reopened my shell. ;)\n\nA: you can export the path as follows:\nexport PATH=$PATH:/bin:/usr/local/bin\n\nA: Looks like your PATH variable is corrupt. Check if by any chance you are modifying the PATH variable within your script or simply check the PATH by saying echo $PATH and you can make sure if nothing is corrupt.\n\nA: I was trying to set my maven path to envoronment variables when this happened. So I just moved my .profile and .bash_profile file to trash and tried again and it worked.\n\nA: Resetting your terminal will work. It will reset your basic configurations.\nReset your terminal.

I'm looking for a spreadsheet app that fills in a functionality hole in Google Docs, specifically the ability to have checkboxes/toggle buttons or equivalent.  The only problem is I will probably only use this once or twice so I have second thoughts about spending $10 for Numbers, even though I'm pretty sure it would do what I want.  Does anyone have any suggestions?  \nI would like to be able to import work already done in Google Docs, but I'm fine with doing a manual export/import if it saves money.\n\nA: I would really go with numbers, I can say from experience that It will allow you to use check boxes, radio buttons etc.\nYou would be able to export a Google doc to an excel file and then open in numbers.\nIf you do choose to export a Google Doc file into an excel file you could also use dropbox to open and edit it in another office based app, with that you may be able to use checks and radio buttons, as long as they already exist in the doc. \nA very good solution is Quick office\nYou can also try a lot of other free office tools such as Docs Free Mobile Office\n", "Q: iPhone Mail displays the wrong number of drafts I recently cleaned up my email drafts folder.  I had 62 messages, and now I have only 6 email drafts saved.\n\nMy iPhone, however, still shows a count of 62! Only the 6 that really exist are available, but the count is still off.\n\nHow can I force the phone to re-count the number of drafts?\n\nA: Try opening the Drafts folder; that will start synchronizing the folder with what's in your Gmail folder.\nI've noticed this happening for some of the Gmail folders on iPhone. As long as you don't access them, they don't all update.\n\nA: I used the iPhone to create a new, 7th junk Draft.

When I open mail after long time, the interface takes a while before to load.\nAlso Xcode and the simulator are slower.\nUPDATE\nSo this how the system activity looks like when the mac slows down (even the dock bar is not responsive). I need to wait 2 minutes then everything starts to work again as before.\nhttp://cl.ly/9ccS\nhttp://cl.ly/9atU\nhttp://cl.ly/9cFk\n\nA: Activity monitor is your friend in this case. Check CPU/RAM usage and look for apps/services using a lot of resources, also check how your hard disk is doing in terms of throughput.\nI've seen machine's hard disks slow down or just fail after an OS upgrade/install. It's a pretty disk intensive operation and can finish off older disks that were on their way out. Consider that as a possibility - perform a backup as soon as possible if you don't already have a recent one.\n\nA: I have had the same problems after upgrading to Lion on my 2010 iMac, have tried repairing disk permissions which did seem to help. This article on how to Speed up Lion: recommends trying the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clean installation.\n\n*Check and repair Disk permissions.\n\n*Check your running processes to identify whats consuming your system\nresources\n\n*Check your Apps are compatible with Lion\n\n*Try disabling Browser extensions. Free up Disk space if under 10%\nleft free.\n\n*Disk speed has a significant impact on the speed of Lion if you have\nan older 5400 hard disk it may be time to upgrade or consider an\nSSD.\n\n*Try Disabling Auto save / resume.\n\n*Turn off Versions.\n\n*Get more RAM!! you need at least 4gb.\n\n*Try deleting old Preferences files and Caches.\n\n*As a last resort you can turn some of Lion UI flourishes via the\n terminal.\n\n\nA: There are issues with OS X Lion and Core 2 machines.  Everything suggested here is great troubleshooting, but the issues remain.\nOn my iMac 3.06ghz Core 2 Duo with 4 GB, I did a complete wipe and install.  The system is slow and programs hang.  When I finally went back to 10.6.x, I regained speed and stability.\n\nA: Check if something is sync-ing in the background. Look in Activity Monitor, sort by CPU usage, and most likely you will find the culprit.\nIn my case, it was Address Book Sync. I had to delete most of the prefs in ~/Library/Application Support/Address Book to get the Mac back to normal. In your case, it may be different, but that's the first place to check.\nThen also run a good maintenance Utility like Onyx or Cocktail - be sure to use the Lioin versions!\nBest of luck with it.\n\nA: Try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clearing the OS X caches in case they're corrupt using the maintenance scripts\n\n*Doing a disk verify and if needs be repair with Disk Utility\n\n*Doing a permissions verify and if needs be repair with Disk Utility\n\n\nIf you've done all of those then there could be corruption somewhere else in the system.

Cache\n2. duplicate files\n3. Useless data\n4. Unnecessary binary and language files.\n\nThere are so many third party tools to speed up Mac Lion performance.\n\nA: I had the same problem. I even upgraded my hard drive, as it was failing and I thought it caused the problem. However, after upgrading the drive, the problem persisted. It was driving me nuts to waite for all the app to start working again and for internet to be up. I tried many solutions posted online, nothing worked. I reinstalled Lion and nothing.\nWhat did help me, was turning off the computer. Then turn in back on and at the same time press and hold \"D\" (try to press \"D\" before grey screen appears). Hold \"D\" untill the computer starts, It could take up to a minute. While holding, I notice \"folder\" icon on my grey screen with question mark inside. I kept holding \"D\" until my comp started up. I didn't bother to check if that fixed the problem. However, after I closed the lid on my macbook and opened it later on in a few hours I saw a miracle :-) It literally took 2 seconds for every app and internet to be up and running.

Unfortunately the only good way to fix it that I know of is to do a full reset restore run again (I've had to do a few too many of those recently so I know that pain).\n\nA: Check the Apple Dev Forums. iOS 5 is still under NDA, unfortunately. I'm sure someone there has spoken on it though.\n", "Q: Minimizing process's memory usage After upgrade to Lion OS X I've noticed new \"Safari Web Content\" process which is separate from the Safari.app itself. And after some time it starts using huge amounts of memory (so far, 1.2G real memory logged). Is there a way to limit process's real memory usage to, say, 500M?\n\nA: There's been a couple of threads about this issue on SuperUser. I was just looking mostly for information on the ulimit command but that apparently doesn't work, it seems like there may be some solutions on that link though.\n", "Q: Install Bootcamp Windows7 off external USB optical drive on Lion system I got my new MBP today and I plan to use MCE's OptiBay to place a second harddisk in the drive bay and put Windows via Bootcamp on it, but I heard / read that, at least with Snow Leopard, it was not really possible to install via an external optical drive with the Windows7 DVD. Has this changed lately or anyone done this successfully? rEfit pops up as a solution, but I wanted to know whether it's possible with the stock bootmanager/bootcamp assistant in Lion?\n\nA: I have a new MBP 17 with my SuperDrive replaced with a hard drive, and with the SuperDrive mounted via USB externally.  I have not been able to install via BootCamp, due to what I understand is some new issue with USB and EFI.  I haven't heard of people having success with rEFit with the latest machines.  The one solution that seems reliable is to open the machine and put the SuperDrive back into the second bay.  The secondary drive can be put into the primary bay for Windows to be installed to it, and then the SuperDrive again removed and the drive with the BootCamp partition moved back to the optical bay.  I can't verify the\nPlease note, I have yet to do this myself with my machine, though I plan to attempt it as soon as I get a few free hours.\n\nA: I do not believe this is an issue of Windows 7 or OS X Lion, but rather an issue with Boot Camp itself. I believe that Boot Camp is designed to be used with the Mac's internal hard drive (or drives). \nWhile I have never owned a Mac with more than one internal hard drive, I don't see why Boot Camp would not let you partition additional internal hard drives as well. \nAs far as external drives go, I  now from experience that the Boot Camp Assistant in OS X Lion (and previous versions of OS X) does not even give you the option to modify the partitions of external drives. Hope this helps. \n", "Q: Is there an app for the iPhone 4 that tells the pitch of a note through an audio input? Does anyone know of an app for the iPhone that can analyze sounds and tell us what pitch the sound is?\nFor example, if i had that app running and i go to the piano and play some notes, it should be able to tell me what notes they are.\n\nA: Garageband can do this. Open a new (or existing) project and add a new \"real\" track with no effects. On the bottom edge of the window you´ll see a LCD-like window which usually displays the current time or measure in the track; depending on which version of Garageband you´re using, you can now either use the up-/down-arrows to switch to the tuner (tuning fork symbol) or click on the tuning fork symbol directly to select the tuner. Every sound that is picked up by your Mac´s microphone will now be displayed as note (with off-pitch)\n\nA: Identifying a single pitch is one thing. Any \"tuner\" or \"guitar tuner\" app can do that, as well as any dedicated hardware tuner. \nHowever, analyzing the notes in a chord, or transcribing a musical passage from an audio source in real time, is not something that any existing program can do on any computer platform. \nThere is a Windows and Macintosh program for electronic music composition and audio recording and editing called Melodyne that can analyze the individual notes in a chord from something that's been recorded, and then let you edit those notes independently.\n", "Q: How to place Dictionary definitions higher up in spotlight results I used to use spotlight fairly frequently to quickly look up words in a dictionary.  With Lion, I've noticed that my dictionary results have dropped down much lower in the list of results:\n\nI'd like to bump up the priority of these results so they show up near the top of the list.  However, looking at the system Spotlight preferences in Lion, I don't see an obvious way to do this:\n\nHow can I make Dictionary.app results show up higher in the list of Spotlight results?\n\nA: In 10.8+, you can open Spotlight, type in the word to look up, and press ⌘L to jump to the definition within Spotlight. Pressing ⌘D instead of ⌘L opens the definition of the typed word in the Dictionary.app.\n\nA: Finally, I found a hack! I wrote a blog post about this which you can find here (in Chinese). \nThese are the key steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the file with Xcode:\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.spotlight.plist\n\nIf you do not have this file, change the order System Preferences → Spotlight  which will cause the OS to create it.\n\n*Within the orderedItems node, add a Dictionary item as follows:\n\n\n*Save the .plist file.\n\n*Open System Preferences → Spotlight, you will find a blank entry, this is what we had added above. You can drag it like other entries to change the order as you like.\n\n*You are done! Now type a word in spotlight and see what happened.\n\n\nA: After a bit of searching, I don’t have a direct answer to your question. But I have a couple of possible fixes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find your Dictionary in the Applications folder. Drop it in the dock. Highlight a word in whatever application you are working in, and drag and drop it into the Dictionary icon in the dock.\n\n*Google makes the \"Google Quick Search Box\" (QSB) which is a lot like QuickSilver and LaunchBar (more like Quicksilver of the two). I think for your purpose, QSB is the best option. Google will give you Dictionary results quite readily based on some criteria. I found that if the definition was not immediately available, I could invoke it more explicitly by typing the word whose definition I am seeking followed by ‘definition’.\n\n\nHere is a little more information about those ‘quick launch’ applications. Google’s QSB is free, quite capable, clean in appearance, but is a little sluggish. … LaunchBar is faster, pretty powerful, not as ‘pretty’, and costs around USD 25-40. Quicksilver has been discontinued, and the developer has recommended that users switch to LaunchBar.\n", "Q: How to make some space on iPad? Is there a way to delete music, podcast or iTunes-U to make some space available (to take more pictures for instance) without a computer ?\n\nA: You can delete videos from the Videos app by tapping and holding on the thumbnail, then pressing the red X that appears in the corner (just like deleting apps from your home screen).\nTo delete audio podcasts, find them in the Music app, swipe your finger across the name of the podcast (or episode) and press the delete button.

My home iMac experienced exactly the same issue after the upgrade to Lion (both iMacs are less than 12 months old). Home iMac issue fixed by repairing the disk with Disk Utility. I tried the same fix with my work iMac, but it didn't work. Any ideas anyone? This is very frustrating as Fireworks is badly missed a laggy Windows version in Parallels is a poor substitute. Help badly needed!\n\nA: This may be totally irrelevant, but it fixed a similar problem for me:\nTurns out that a flashfirebug file kills the ability of Fireworks CS5, CS5.1 on Macs running Lion to start up:\nhttp://forums.adobe.com/message/3929927#3929927\nFlashfirebug (a Firefox extension that I'd forgotten I even had) also creates potential issues with Flashbuilder 4.x, and I've heard that it creates crashes on startup with Adobe Extension Manager and Adobe Updater.  In any case, the link I found above is more useful than my guesses.\n", "Q: Buying apps with different AppleID than one used to buy OS X Lion Case: I bought a new Macbook pro and I got lion as free upgrade. \nBy mistake my friend's apple id was stored in the Mac App Store and I didn't notice the error when I entered my redemption code. \nI already redeemed that lion upgrade using my friend's id on my machine. \nThe purchase, download and upgrade all happened on my machine. I intend to keep on using that Lion for my machine only. \nI download new apps and everything using my apple id not my friend's apple Id. Will it work?\nOr for my new upgrades or downloading new apps, do I need my friend's ID and password.\nMoral: Lion has been downloaded with different ID and Now I want to use my apple id to install new apps.\n\nA: It will work, although it will not be legal.\nIt will work, because OS X doesn't care what AppleID it was bought with and you can easily buy new apps using any other AppleID. I.e. if you have more than one AppleID you can use any to buy apps and they don't have to match the one you bought Lion with. It will slightly complicate the apps update process, but it will work without any problems.\nIt will not be legal, because you will be using OS X Lion bought with someone else's AppleID - not yours. So you are not legally allowed to use it.\nIn your initial question you ask whether you can transfer Lion purchase from one ID to another. No. Apple's policy does not allow transferring purchases between IDs.\n\nA: Having to maintain a purchase under your friend's Apple ID is a bad idea. If they change their password or otherwise change/lose their account, you're stuck in a bad situation if you ever have to re-download the installer.\nAlthough Apple doesn't allow purchase transfers, they do have a return policy. As per this Apple Support Communities discussion, if I were you, I would do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes. Go to menu item Store->View my Account. You should be asked for your password. Have your friend use his account and password.\n\n*Right in the middle of the window should be your friend's purchase history. Click View All to the right of that.\n\n*OS X Lion should be in the list. Below the list should be a big button labeled Report a problem. Click it.\n\n*Now the list of your purchases should have a Report a problem line right from each item. Look for OS X Lion, click the corresponding Report a problem button.\n\n*On the form where you can state your problem with Lion (accidentally upgraded with wrong Apple ID, for example.) State that you want your money back or a new redemption code. Send the form.\nYour friend should then receive an email. If Apple gives money, you can work it out between each other. If needed you can call Apple Customer Relations at 1-800-676-2775 and I bet they would be happy to solve this problem or step you through a solution.\n\nA: Why not go to the source? Report a billing problem through the App Store app under your account. \nExplain your mistake and ask what apple prefers you do. \nKeep in mind you did in effect give your friend your license to Lion. If your friend was going to get lion, they can gift it to you or gift you the amount and this is just a short term problem that you can solve yourself. \nAlso, only Apple knows how they are tracking and signing these installers but anecdotal evidence shows you are not currently prevented from just going forward with your plan. Currently the installer for Lion doesn't ask for the purchasing ID and password other than when downloading the installer. \n", "Q: Can't delete old Time Machine backups I changed hard drives for my Time Machine backup. I can't delete the backups on the older hard drive. I get an error code after I use \"Move to Trash\": -8072. It spends 45min deleting some 1,000,000+ files to end in error -8072. A google search didn't turn up the reason for the error.\nAlso, for some reason creating a backup on this hard drive locked all my other folders and subfolders. I can unlock them one at a time but this will take a while. Is there a faster way?\n\nA: On Lion, you can use tmutil to clean things up properly.\nTo delete backups one by one (snapshot by snapshot).\nsudo tmutil delete /Volumes/drive_name/Backups.backupdb/mac_name/YYYY-MM-DD-hhmmss\n\nIf you are sure you have selected the correct path, you can delete all backups from that one Mac by not passing in the time and letting it delete the entire folder:\nsudo tmutil delete /Volumes/drive_name/Backups.backupdb/mac_name\n\nThe sudo command needs your password (and it won't echo to the screen, so just type it and pause to be sure you're dating the correct files before pressing enter).\n\nA: The Time Machine backup format is not designed to let you use the Trash. If you are sure you don't need your old backups, you should\n1) Erase and reformat the drive in Disk Utility\n2) Go to your Time Machine Preferences, click on Select Disk..., and select the disk again, instructing the Time Machine preferences to take control of the disk and create a new Time Machine backup.\nOthers have pointed out to me that you can store additional files of your own on your Time Machine volume if you like. But what you should not do is use the Finder to try to delete anything in the Backups.backupdb directory, or to move any files into those directories.\n\nA: I used Path Finder, the alternative Finder app. I connected my mac directly to my Time Capsule via Ethernet (faster than wifi). Then in Path Finder, I selected the Time Machine disk, selected the sparsebundle, and then chose \"Delete\" from the Commands menu. It took about 10 minutes to delete a sparsebundle that was about 250GB. \n", "Q: Are there any Lion optimized text editors with VIM keybindings? I am looking for a text editor with support for Lion's new features - specifically autosave, versions, and full-screen support.\nI would also really like to be able to use VIM keybindings, either standard, or as an option. Does this combination exist?\n\nA: Check Sublime Text 2, it is still in beta and they have adding full-screen support in Lion but not others you mentioned.  And you can use Vim key-binding too.\nMacVim is also working on some of the Lion refinements (the ones that are included have some rough edges) - it's certainly not stable since it's being fixed as the days go by, but as an open-source program, you can see the bugs/defects and know when the features you care are shipped or have issues.\n\nA: Chocolat is a Textmate style editor (like Sublime still in Development) that has all the Lion features.\nAlso vim mode was added in the latest version.\nPersonally I find Sublime's completion a lot better tho.\n\nA: I can't believe no-one mentioned Vico. It's a relatively new code editor sold on the App Store that uses vi keybindings and is scriptable using Nu.\n\nIt doesn't support auto-save or Versions but does support Lion's full screen and Resume.\n\nA: Xcode 4 does allow you to take advantage of all the new Lion features at the expense of native vi/vim key commands. Mac text entry is more emacs like than vi like, but there are plenty of good articles that explain how to customize the key bindings to make Xcode more vi like.\nI find when I need heavy vi lifting, I drop into terminal and get the job done, but spend more and more time in Xcode due to the nature of the code I'm crafting.\n\nA: MacVim? It has lion support (the full screen). Is there a problem with that?\nI think autosave & versions is not in the spec for vim :( so an alternative would be needed.\n\nA: I'm fairly sure there isn't anything (could be wrong, VIM makes my eyes glaze over), but that's probably best followed with a yet. A lot of devs seem to be scrambling to get updated with the new Lion calls. \n", "Q: How does Time Machine handle an external drive shared between two Macs? I have a new MacBook Air (13\" with 128Gb SSD) and my wife has an old MacBook (120Gb HDD) and we're planning to both use the same 1Tb external HDD to store our iTunes and iPhoto libraries and the same 2Tb external HDD for Time Machine backups (obviously only one of us can use the external HDDs at the same time).\nIf each of us sets the the 1Tb (music and photos) drive to be backed up by Time Machine will Time Machine back it up independently for each user, even though the data is the same? If so (which I suspect is the case) then I guess it would make sense for only one of us to configure the 1Tb ext HDD to be backed up by Time Machine, with the risk that any changes the other person makes won't be backed up until the one doing the backups connects?\n\nA: Time Machine allows you to backup multiple macs to one drive.  You just plug it in, set it up, and you're good.  If you look at the file system, you can see separate backups for both computers.  At our home we currently do this with a Mac Mini and a MacBook.  The Mac Mini is always plugged in, and the MacBook gets updated every couple weeks.  We use a 1.5 TB drive from Western Digital.  Given your description, I think this solution with your 2TB drive should work well for you.\nThe data backed up by both macs will not be the same, as no matter how hard you try, both computers will wind up having subtile differences, so the data won't be \"exactly\" the same.  Backing up only one system doesn't seem ideal to me, but you can restore a MacBook from a Mac Mini backup.  It works fine.\nAlso, you realize that the drive must be connected for you to access the photos and music that you have stored there.  You'll have to factor that into your storage solution.\n", "Q: AppleScript to mark video file as TV show? I'm using Hazel to automate the conversion of video files to iTunes .mv4 format, however one limitation I've run into is being able to mark a video file as \"TV show\" or \"Movie\" before adding to iTunes.\nI'd like to do this via Applescript so I can run it as part of my rule set up, but I'm more of an AppleScript copy/paster than a coder.\n\nA: Here's a bit to start the copy/pasting process, from the excellent \"Doug's Scripts\" website:\nhttp://dougscripts.com/410\nThis is the \"Set Video Kind of Selected\" script, which lets you choose what kind you want the file to be marked as TV Show, Movie, etc.\n\nA: Taken from: \nhttp://kjvarga.blogspot.ca/2009/03/applescript-automator-import-avi-video.html\non run {input, parameters}  \n set videoType to button returned of (display dialog (\"What type of video are you importing?\") buttons {\"Movie\", \"TV Show\"} default button {\"TV Show\"})  \n repeat with i in input  \n  try  \n   tell application \"Finder\" to set file type of file i to \"MooV\"  \n  end try  \n  tell application \"iTunes\"  \n   set newAddition to (add (i as alias))  \n   if videoType = \"TV Show\" then  \n    tell newAddition to set video kind to TV show  \n   end if  \n  end tell  \n end repeat  \n return input  \nend run  \n\n\nA: *\n\n*open Automator\n\n*choose Application as Document type\n\n*select Run Applescript from the Utilities folder in the Automator Library\n\n*Paste this in to the part that says (Your script goes here)\n\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n  set newAddition to (add input)\n  tell\n  newAddition to set video kind to TV show\n  end tell\n\n\n*Save with a useful name\n\n*Drop shows on the App and they will be added to iTunes as TV shows\n\n\nTested with iTunes 11\n\nA: Automator would be my first inclination if you don't want to learn the syntax and craft of making your own AppleScripts. \nIt lets you save an action as a service or as a folder action both of which are about as easy as a script. The service can run right out of iTunes if desired.  \nYou can use several variables to try and fill in the TV related fields as well as just changing the media kind. \n", "Q: Is there a way to provide a sort order to an mdfind query?

The current invocation is something like:\nmdfind -onlyin \"$MUSICROOT\" -literal \"$MDQUERY\"\n\nwhere:\n$MUSICROOT is ~/Music/iTunes\n$MDQUERY is \"kMDItemContentTypeTree == 'public.audio' && kMDItemAlbum == '*$1*'c\"\n\nIdeally I'd want to add something like the following to the query:\nORDER BY kMDItemAlbum, kMDItemAudioTrackNumber\n\n\nA: I used the following shell function to provide the sort:\nfunction sort_file()\n{\n    TMPFILE=`mktemp /tmp/sortable.XXXXXX` || exit 1\n    export MDLS=\"mdls -raw -name kMDItemAlbum -name kMDItemAudioTrackNumber\"\n    export TR=\"tr \\\"\\0\\\" \\\"\\;\\\"\"\n    awk '{system( \"$MDLS \\\"\" $0 \"\\\" | $TR\" ); print \"\\;\"$0; }' $1 > $TMPFILE\n    sort -t\\; -k 2n -k 1f $TMPFILE | awk -F\";\" '{ print $3; }' > $1\n}\n\nMETA NOTE: I would have put this in a comment in the above answer, but couldn't get it to format correctly.\n\nA: At the risk of stating the obvious, 'sort'.\ne.g. mdfind -onlyin \"$MUSICROOT\" -literal \"$MDQUERY\" | sort\nwill sort the output alphabetically, giving you Artist, Title, Track.\n(it won't do the cool iTunes trick of ignoring 'The').\nThe sort command has lots of options, including sorting on particular fields if you want more control.\nEdit:  The below shell script function will provide the desired sort in the specific case mentioned:\nfunction sort_file()\n{\n    TMPFILE=`mktemp /tmp/sortable.XXXXXX` || exit 1\n    export MDLS=\"mdls -raw -name kMDItemAlbum -name kMDItemAudioTrackNumber\"\n    export TR=\"tr \\\"\\0\\\" \\\"\\;\\\"\"\n    awk '{system( \"$MDLS \\\"\" $0 \"\\\" | $TR\" ); print \"\\;\"$0; }' $1 > $TMPFILE\n    sort -t\\; -k 2n -k 1f $TMPFILE | awk -F\";\" '{ print $3; }' > $1\n}\n\n", "Q: buggy mission control shortcuts I am having an issue where somehow lion decided that the F1 shortcut should be mapped to opening mission control on my 2011 mbp.  \nThis is a problem because I had F1 mapped to desktop 4 (don't ask) and F5 mapped to mission control.  F5 still worked correctly and even after attempting to revert to defaults the F1 keyboard shortcut is still incorrectly mapped.  \nHas anyone been having similar issues or do they know how to totally reset keyboard shortcuts at the operating system level?  \nThis is obviously really annoying.\n\nA: Did you try double-clicking on the actual keyboard short cut for that function in System Preferences/Keyboard/Keyboard Shortcuts?  You can change the key combo at will.  Of course there is no guarantee they will take, just as your \"Restore Defaults\" did not take.\nI use Spark, a free app that lets me map anything I want, and overrides the OS settings.  If there is a con flit (which shows as the yellow triangle/traffic cone), I change the OS conflict to some unused combo.\nI complained to Apple that I could not change those keyboard shortcuts to \"Open app X\".  The response was that I should not try to do that, as the existing system was working as designed.\nThis is not a built-in cure using the native OS options, but it works.\n", "Q: How can I send email through a Terminal window? I'm trying to figure out some basic Terminal commands, so I thought I'd try out 'mail.'  \nI opened a Terminal window and entered the following:\nmail (my email address)\n(The Terminal then said \"Subject:\" without quotes) so I entered \"test\" without quotes.  \n\"This is a test message\"  without quotes\nI then ended the message by typing . and enter, but nothing has send to my inbox.\n\nA: You did not specify which inbox you checked, but if you use mail <your mac userid>, you can then read that mail by running the mail command without any arguments.  I am not sure how useful this might be, but it does work.\nman mail from a shell prompt will give you more background info into the mail command.\nIf you are looking to send email to an external (SMTP) mail server from a shell prompt (like the one in the Terminal window), you will need to use a message transfer agent or MTA.  This is something far more useful, although it requires much more setup overhead.\nAlternatively, you might be able to use Applescript and/or Automator to automate sending messages through Mail.app through a previously configured email account.\n\nA: Add an additional blank line after the Subject line.\n\nA: Actually OSX has a perfectly good Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) built in and configured. When  you send a mail message from the command line using mail it will fire up Postfix long enough to send the mail.\nThe only caveat is that it may need to know about an outgoing mail link and uses the settings in the Mail app to discover one. So I'm assuming you haven't set Mail up to be able to send mail.\nIf that's the case then set up Mail and try the command again.\nSee this answer for some more details on what's happening and mail in general.\nQuite a lot of SMTP servers are happy to accept mail from almost anywhere and believe it to be valid but yours may not be one of them.\n", "Q: Set up OSX to act as router via Internet Sharing I have the following network setup:\nLAN====OSX++++Machine A\n        +\n        +\n        ++++++Machine B\n\nOSX is currently sharing an ethernet connection with A and B via an ad-hoc wireless network.

On my 2011 MacBook Air with Mac OS X Lion, I boot into Recovery mode via holding the command-R key during startup, if I go into Terminal and do a diskutil list, I get a list of 12(!) logical disks.  disk0 is of course the disk holding the main HD and the Recovery HD partitions (along with the GUID partition and the EFI partition).  But there is also a disk1 with partitions including one titled Mac OS X Base System that is approximately 1.39 GB big.  There also are 10 other disks of varying but small sizes.\nWhat are these other logical disks (and partitions) and is there any way to reclaim their space? \nUpdate: Here is a copy of the diskutil list output:\n[]\n\nA: It's rather complicated, and actually a lot of the complexity is to avoid wasting space; I don't think you can \"reclaim\" anything without breaking it.\nLet me start at the beginning: your hard drive (/dev/disk0) has two relevant partitions: Macintosh HD (your regular startup volume), and Recovery HD.\n(Update: with newer versions of macOS running from an APFS volume, there'll instead be a single APFS \"container\" on the disk; the volumes under it will be listed separately under a \"synthesized\" device, probably /dev/disk2. And in addition to Macintosh HD and Recovery, there'll probably be Preboot and VM volumes, and starting in Catalina there'll be a separate \"Macintosh HD - Data\" volume holding the user-modifiable parts of the main filesystem. And some other details are different, but actually not that much.)\nRecovery HD is marked in the partition table with the type Apple_Boot, but is actually in the normal HFS+ format. It contains minimal booter files and kernel, and at /com.apple.recovery.boot/BaseSystem.dmg, a disk image with a stripped-down and tweaked copy of OS X. The booter mounts this volume (it attaches as /dev/disk1), and transfers to OS X running on it. This is the Mac OS X Base System.\nNotice that the Recovery HD is only 650MB, but Mac OS X Base System is 1.4GB? That's because it's a compressed disk image (and I'm pretty sure that compression is the reason they bother with all this disk image trickery).  Actually, BaseSystem.dmg is compressed down to only 451MB (at least in OS X v10.7.0).\nAlso, the volume naming is somewhat inconsistent.  You've got /dev/disk1s3 named \"Recovery HD\", but for some reason it's mounted as \"/Volumes/Image Volume\" in recovery mode. BaseSystem.dmg has a volume named \"Mac OS X Base System\".\nSo that's disk0 and disk1; what about the rest? I'm not certain, but I'm pretty sure they are RAM disks to save temporary data in folders OS X modifies as it runs (remember that in recovery mode, you're running from a read-only disk image). Running the mount command in recovery mode is informative:\n$ mount\n/dev/disk1s3 on / (hfs, local, read-only)\ndevfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse)\n/dev/disk2 on /Volumes (hfs, local, union, nobrowse)\n/dev/disk3 on /private/var/tmp (hfs, local, union, nobrowse)\n/dev/disk4 on /private/var/run (hfs, local, union, nobrowse)\n/dev/disk5 on /System/Installation (hfs, local, union, nobrowse)\n/dev/disk6 on /private/var/db (hfs, local, union, nobrowse)\n/dev/disk7 on /private/var/folders (hfs, local, union, nobrowse)\n/dev/disk8 on /private/var/root/Library (hfs, local, union, nobrowse)\n/dev/disk9 on /Library/ColorSync/Profiles/Displays (hfs, local, union, nobrowse)\n/dev/disk10 on /Library/Preferences (hfs, local, union, nobrowse)\n/dev/disk11 on /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration (hfs, local, union, nobrowse)\n/dev/disk12 on /Library/Keychains (hfs, local, union, nobrowse)\n/dev/disk0s2 on /Volumes/Macintosh HD (hfs, local, journaled)\n/dev/disk0s3 on /Volumes/Image Volume (hfs, local, read-only, journaled)\n\nThose \"union\" attributes mean that things in the relevant folder in the startup volume will be visible, but anything modified gets stored in what I'm pretty sure is a RAM disk.\nIf you want to look at this stuff yourself, you can mount the relevant volumes from the regular OS:\n# Mount \"Recovery HD\":\n$ diskutil mount /dev/disk0s3\n# Mount \"Mac OS X Base System\":\n$ hdiutil mount /Volumes/Recovery\\ HD/com.apple.recovery.boot/BaseSystem.dmg -noverify\n\n\nA: I am almost positive disk1 partition is the recovery disk burn it and boot from disk drive \n\nA: If you have broadband Internet and are ready to totally wipe the drive, you could use the Internet Recovery method of Lion Recovery to free up the disk0 and partition / erase the drive. \nBe sure you have verified a backup of any data you want to save as this will wipe the SSD clean and let you install Lion and the normal recovery HD as it should be. \nAppleCare will certainly walk you through this for free as you are in the complimentary support window for 90 days after purchase. \n\nA: According to Apple community, trying to remove these small disks will crash Recovery (see this thread):\n\nWhen you boot into Internet Recovery, the minimal system creates over\n25 RAM-disks, of type disk-image, all modest in size, and uses them to\nhold temporary items. This leaves the boot drive completely free to be\nRepaired, Erased, or whatever needs to happen.\nTrying to remove them will crash Recovery.\nThose RAM-Disks are not permanent. Just restart into regular mode or\nSafe mode, and they will be gone.\n\nAnother answer with additional explanation:\n\nIn that report, your \"real\" disk is Disk0, size about 251GB, and it\nholds a GUID partition Map, an EFI partition, and a container-disk.\nLook closely at the SIZES of those items.\nSince diskutil list is recomputed at every startup, when you start up\nwithout Internet recovery active, your APFS Volume will likely move to\na different disk number.\n\n", "Q: Playing the same music on multiple computers I have multiple Macs in my house. I'm looking for a way to play the same music simultaneously from both Macs. Each is connected to a speaker set, so I don't need bluetooth audio or anything fancy.\n\nA: There are certainly multiple ways to accomplish this, but what I figured out is the simplest free approach I know of: use SoundFlower (a free download from Cycling 74) to pipe your system audio to iChat, and use iChat to send the audio to another computer.\nIn your System Preferences go to Sound and set SoundFlower as both Input and Output. Note that this will make your system sound not go through your speakers, so to turn that back on also run SoundFlowerbed (the front end that comes with SoundFlower) and set SoundFlower's output to the speakers.\nNow launch iChat and go to Preferences. In the Video/Audio preferences you can set what input to use; it'll probably be defaulting to your microphone but you can set that to SoundFlower. Now when you do a voice chat with someone else they will hear your computer's audio.\n\nA: Airfoil does exactly what you ask.

Relatively new to Macs, I'm used to Windows wanting to verify HD data integrity after an unexpected shutdown. I know they use different file systems, but do Macs need to do anything like this?\n\nA: Mac OS X's default file system is HFS+ Journaled. This means that before files are written, the metadata is first written to a special log called the journal. In the event of application or system crashes, when the machine re-starts it will re-run all the remaining entries in the journal to bring the file system back into pristine order. In theory anyway.\nThat said, it is still probably a good idea to use one of the included utilities to verify your filesystem.\nYou can run fsck in the Terminal or use Disk Utility to check your hard drive if you want. After a Kernel Panic or power outage, this is probably a good idea.\nDisk Utility is the simpler option, just log in as normal and go to /Application/Utilities/Disk Utility and select your boot drive and choose \"Verify\". You can also run Disk Utility from your Mac OS X DVD that came with your computer (you will need to do this if you want to repair, it can't repair the boot volume if you are running the computer on it).\nIf you want to run fsck, you will have to do it from the startup terminal.  I'm a little fuzzy on the details, since it has been years since I last used it, but on startup hold down ⌘S during startup to boot in single user mode. Then run fsck to run the diagnostic. You should also look at man fsck to look at the manual.\nTL;DR\nNo, you don't generally need to. But it's not a bad idea to run a utility.\nUpdate 2020: The default file system in macOS is now AFS, which has its own robust set of integrity protections. Like before, it still doesn’t hurt to run a disk check after a kernel panic. For the most part, the utilities should be the same as those listed above.\n\nA: After any non-clean shutdown (kernel panic, power outage, etc.) I boot to single user mode (command + s when starting) and run fsck -fy. Usually things come back clean, but sometimes it finds and fixes an error. Good piece of mind IMO to always do that. If there is an error, you want to catch it early before anything else might get corrupted. If you're having frequent kernel panics though, it'd be worth tracking down the cause (the Console application can help here). Those should be exceedingly rare.\n", "Q: Yahoo as Exchange on IOS 4 I can sync Gmail contacts to my iPhone and it works pretty well.\nIs there a way I can sync my Yahoo contacts over the air with my iPhone?\n\nA: I see that with IOS 5 it is possible to sync contacts with Yahoo\n", "Q: How do you create an archive file which unarchives into the current folder?

It seems that Garage Band does some low-level tests on your audio system when it runs, and clears up weird states like you're encountering.\nThis doesn't answer the question of what's wrong, but hopefully will fix it anyhow.\n\nA: I had a similar problem start when I upgraded to 10.6.8 with external speakers connected via the headphone jack (MBP). When I switch users (Fast User Switch) audio is dead in that other user and fine in the main user.\n\n\n*\n\n*The first solution I found was to unplug and replug the headphone jack.\n\n*The second and more convenient solution is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the \"Audio MIDI Setup\" application (/Applications/Utilities/)\n\n*Switch the Format: Channel/Bit dropdown to something other than what's currently selected and then back to what was there when you first opened it. (ex: 2ch-16bit -> 2ch-20bit -> 2ch-16bit).\nThe first change is what does the trick. That seems to restart whatever audio system is crapping out.\nObviously you shouldn't have to do this, but it's the best workaround I've found in the mean time.\n\nA: If the GarageBand effort does not fix it, try starting in Safe mode, then restart normally when you see the login page.\nStarting in Safe mode essentially does a Disk Repair during the boot process, and a lot of extras are disabled.\n", "Q: How to figure out what app is sending/receiving huge amounts of data on an iPhone? I have an iPhone which has suddenly (last two months) started going way over the 200mb data plan it was on.  Prior to this it wasn't even close to the limits.\nThe only information the phone company (AT&T) gives me is the amounts, and the times (which from what I understand is just a billing time for a grouped amount of data).  Here is a sample:\n08/23  12:07 AM  Sent  198679KB\n08/22  12:07 AM  Sent  6070KB\n08/21  12:06 AM  Sent  13757KB\n08/20  12:06 AM  Sent  5993KB\n08/19  12:54 AM  Sent  64947KB\n08/17  10:05 PM  Sent  165247KB\n08/17  12:02 AM  Sent  12707KB\n08/16  12:02 AM  Sent  90KB\n08/15  12:42 AM  Sent  23581KB\n08/14  12:10 AM  Sent  35819KB\n\nAnd on top of the huge amounts on 3G, this phone spent very little time outside Wifi.\nIs there any possible way (without jailbreaking!) to find out what app could possibly transferring this much data? At present, AT&T will not or can not give me a breakdown of the traffic destinations. Even if it were possible, I would like an answer that lies within the phone as a check against what the carrier is measuring if that is possible.\n\nA: In your shoes with my meager knowledge, I'd just pick a good candidate or two and remove them from the iPhone with iTunes.  It should result in a huge loss of free space, and iTunes could show that.\nAnother less involved method would be to just turn them off by double-clicking the Home button and holding one until the x appears.\nIt's probably just one app, but sorting it out will take time and $ until you find it.\nThere are probably better ways that others will suggest, but this is something to start with.\n\nA: There are several apps that may help you track down app data usage:\n\n\n*\n\n*A combination of NetStat and Data Usage: The former will let you know all the connections at a point in time. The latter claims to work with any wireless provider and can provide wireless and WiFi data usage reports. The app also claims to \"track data hog application by checking since last run counter\". These will assist in a process of elimination search to potentially rule out or in some apps as users of the data.\n\n*Onavo (reviewed here): Provides compression of data for the iPhone and generates reports of the amount of data usage by app/category. Limitations - currently only works with AT&T for US users, can't compress streaming video. There may also be security risks, as your data is routed through Onavo's servers.\nI also found this list of notable iOS data tracking apps that may suit your needs.\nCaveat: I haven't personally used these apps, but the reviews seem promising.\n\nA: After several careful readings of your question, something stood out:\n\nAnd on top of the huge amounts on 3G, this phone spent very little time outside Wifi.\n\nYour iPhone, when it's in sleep mode, turns off the WiFi radio to conserve battery power. So if you have data hungry apps that are doing things in the background when your phone is sleeping/locked, they're doing it over 3G. Note that the WiFi-off-in-sleep-mode behaviour is somewhat inconsistent. But you can ensure 3G is never used by your phone while you're performing these tests by shutting off cellular data. That way, when it sleeps, it will continue to use WiFi and not 3G for data and you'll be certain to capture all the traffic in your monitoring net.\n\nYou can cobble together some technologies that might help you track down the culprit.\nAs a quick first pass you could try monitoring the phone when it's on a WiFi network using mitmproxy. From this excellent mclov.in blog post, you can setup a proxy for your phone on your Mac and filter all http/s traffic through it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the mitmproxy tool and set it up by going to the folder of mitmproxy and running sudo python setup.py install. If all goes well, mitmproxy must be available in your $PATH.\n\n*Start mitmproxy by running mitmproxy.\n\n*Obtain the IP address of your computer by running ifconfig en1 (or whatever is the interface that you are using).\n\n*Set the proxy on your iPhone by going to your wireless settings, setting the proxy to be “Manual”, and set the IP to be your computer’s IP and the port as 8080.\n\n\nIf you set mitmproxy to record http/s calls to a file you can analyze it after some period of time and look for trends. You'll also be able to inspect the payloads on the http/s calls so you might able to spot unusually large requests this way.\nOf course: this approach assumes the culprit is using http/s for communication. If it's not, you won't see the problem via mitmproxy and you have to resort to a lower-level solution.\nYou need to monitor all the traffic on a WiFi network you control to help you hunt down at least the end points for the data transfers. Bandwidth monitoring isn't hard to set up, but keeping a per-IP, per-endpoint log is really tough to do with consumer-grade hardware because it can be A MASSIVE amount of data. Every packet has to be checked for origin, destination, logged for time and size -- it adds up really quick.\nBut you can get some decent numbers and narrow down the search space so it's something potentially human-parseable.\nFirst: you need to setup a network with bandwidth monitoring on a per-IP level. For that I recommend a Linksys WRT54GL consumer-grade WiFi router running Tomato and the TeamanIPTraffic add-on for IP-level bandwidth tracking.\nSecond: set your DNS on the router to use OpenDNS. In your OpenDNS account to track DNS lookups:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in to https://dashboard.opendns.com/\n\n*Click the 'Settings' tab\n\n*Click the IP address for the network associated with your router\n\n*Click 'Stats and Logs' on the left side\n\n*Make sure 'Enable stats and logs' is checked and click the 'Apply' button\n\n\nNow any DNS lookups performed on your network will be logged.\nAssign your phone a static IP on this network so it's easier to track.\nAnd...wait and watch.\nYou're going to monitor the activity for the IP address assigned to your phone in your router's per-IP activity tables. When the data activity for this IP address spikes you'll head over to your OpenDNS console and take a look at the stats and logs for your DNS lookups for the period of time when data movement was high for your phone.\nThat should give a short list [sic] of hostnames that were being resolved at the time. And armed with that list you might able to narrow it down to an application.\n\nA: Since iOS 7, you can go into Settings -> Mobile Data and see a list of all apps along with the amount of data used (since statistics were last reset) by each. You can also turn off mobile data on a per-app basis in the same place.\nIf you are seeing unexplained high mobile data usage, try disabling Wi-Fi Assist in the same settings screen; it lets your phone use mobile data even when it has a Wi-Fi connection, if it considers that connection to be sub-par.\n\nA: I believe there are some iPhone apps which enable you to log and monitor your data usage. I haven't used any personally, but I did some Googling, and found that the guys who made NetUse for Mac are planning to make a similar application for iPhone. I also found this thread, which essentially asks the same question; maybe there are some answers in there.\nPerhaps you could use that when it comes out, or search around on the iPhone App Store to see if something similar already exists :)\n\nA: I would recommend taking several hours to systematically go through your apps, one by one. First, quit all your apps. Take a note of the time you open the app and the time you close it (removing it from the multitasking bar, of course). Repeat with the next app. When you see AT&T's report, you should be able to tell from the times given which app uses the network that much.\n\nA: I'm surprised it hasn't been mentioned... But make SURE to check your EMAIL settings.  There are options for...\n\n\n*\n\n*Push on? (more bandwidth)\n\n*Message preview setting? (more bandwidth, I'd assume)\n\n*Load images ?(more bandwidth)\n\n*Fetch time? (lower = more bandwidth)\n\n*Multiple accounts?\n\n\nAnd depending on your calendar / contacts setup, photos, frequency of changes... Those could also be affecting it.  Also, do you have iCloud, or Find my iPhone turned on, of late... That could surely have effected your usage numbers..\nWhile it's prolly negligible... You can also turn on and off notifications for non-essential apps.. To eliminate one additional (unlikely) source of the problem.\nI went over on my iPad one month - and changing my aggressive email checking settings fixed it all for me...  But, in the time shortly after it happened.. I also would slip it into airplane mode /wifi on whenever possible.. I'd assume you're using the cellular network for phone calls (which I wasn't), so that precautionary measure may be innapropriate... But if you need to do what you need to do to make sure you don't go over.. Thats an option.\n\nA: Well you could turn it off by closing all your apps that require data then going to Settings -> General -> Network and flip the cellular data switch to off.\n", "Q: Activity Monitor showing ~3,000% percent CPU under normal use Shows huge percentages for dropbox but total is normal, and everything seems to be running fine. I have a Macbook with Intel Core2Duo\n\nA: The counters that track usage can get messed up like anything else. If it is something that happens each and every reboot we can dig into it a bit, but most of the time it's a signal to reboot and let the OS tidy things up. \nThe goal is on a two core processor, if one deopbox thread is running all the time, you get dropbox at 100% usage. Due to inefficiencies and delays due to interrupts, a multithreades process that is taking all the CPU can approach 200% but usually not reach thy perfect limit. \nHere the math is adding up the threads improperly. A 12 core Mac Pro with two threads per core could perhaps have something near 2400% so the program has to be able to show such \"ridiculous\" numbers just in case it happens. \n\nA: On OS X, 3,000% CPU would mean thirty processors are being fully used. I'm fairly certain that no Mac has ever shipped with thirty cores (even with hyperthreading), so this is not correct, particularly on a Core 2 Duo MacBook.\n", "Q: Does appleutd@xmr3.com belong to the Apple up to date program? I applied for the apple up to date program through their site and got now the e-mail with a password protected pdf attachment in it. Xmr3 doesn't really sound like apple. Has anybody some additional info on this?\nNOTE: I didn't visit their site because the WOT add-on in safari rated the website with a poor reputation score.\n\nA: I wonder if you signed up for their Up to Date Program on a web page pretending to be the Apple website. That PDF is most likely a scam, do not open it--It could execute some malicious code. In the last seven years I have yet to see e-mail communication from Apple that does not come from apple.com. Also, I think all of their invoicing is done by using HTML-formatted e-mail messages sent to your Apple ID, not PDF's. Hope this helps. \n\nA: It appears that xmr3.com is a spammer domain. Google \"xmr3.com spam\" and you'll get a large number of links to scams that have run through that domain over the years.\nI can't remember the last time, if ever, Apple has sent out a password protected PDF. Best not to mess with it.\nI suggest you call AppleCare to make sure that you are properly signed up for the Apple Up to Date program. \n\nA: The Offical Answer is that OS X Codes are sent through the domain xmr3.com (I suspect that he meant the sender appleutd@xmr3.com)\nSource: I first called the Apple Support hotline and they said that I must contact the iTunes Store through express lane on theyr site. Express Lane didn't work at that moment so I went through the contact sheet http://www.apple.com/support/itunes/contact.html and got my answer.\n\nA: appleutd@xmr3.com is not a scam. I received an email containing encrypted PDF. The email said password to unlock the PDF will follow and today it did. I unlocked the PDF and it contained the redeem code also it contained the reference number i got when submitting the up to date form. That number matched. Redeem code worked.\n", "Q: Looking for advice setting up a new Mac Mini with Lion Server I am setting up a new Mac Mini server which will serve as a web server (with Apache and MySQL) as well as some other pieces of functionality.  I have seen little on securing OS X for such a scenario (I am running Lion - and this is not Lion Sever).  \nI assume it is recommended to use ipfw as opposed to the application firewall.  I also assume that it makes sense to lock down SSH (put it on a non-standard port and use certificate authentication).  However, should I also lock down screen sharing (and force an SSH tunnel for this)?  Any tips on this are welcome.\n\nA: Although written for 10.5, this guide by Daniel Cuthbert (PDF) is fairly comprehensive and largely still applies to Lion.\nClosing off screen sharing and tunneling it (if you need it at all) through SSH is probably a good idea.\nStandard rules apply:\n\n\n*\n\n*Only open absolutely necessary ports to the outside world\n\n*Keep your software up to date\n\n*Disable any unused services & Apache modules\n\n*Disable any listeners you don't need, rebind those you do need to localhost only if they're not needed outside (lsof -i is your friend)\n\n*Check that your firewall is really working as expected (nmap from an outside host)\n\n\nMac specific things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the console is password protected, locks if you're using screensharing and doesn't auto-login on startup\n\n*You may want to enable verbose boot messages by default, it'll make debugging easier in case things go bad: sudo nvram boot-args=\"-v\"\n", "Q: How do I locate the contact data for the Address Book on Snow Leopard? How do I locate the contact data for the Address Book in the hard drive on Snow Leopard?\n\nA: The data is stored in several places. It's best to just export the data to the desktop if you want it in one file. \nThe complicated answer is in ~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook as well as in various cache files if you have enabled LDAP/open directory integration or other sync options to get contacts into and out of your address book. \n\nA: Should be ~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/\nIf you hit File -> Export... -> Address Book Archive you can create a backup. The resulting Addressbook - <date>.abbu file (which is actually a folder) actually just contains the contents of the abovementioned location.\n", "Q: What is the difference between thunderbolt and displayport iMacs when used as monitors? Somewhat confused by the Thunderbolt/Mini DisplayPort compatibility rules, and the apple store people were unhelpful, so I ask here (maybe I should ask here first :)  Hopefully we can come to a complete compatibility matrix.\nI have a 27\" iMac from December 2010 (\"old imac\") and another 27\" iMac (\"new imac\") from July 2011.  The first is MDP and the second is TB.  I also have a MBP from July 2010 (which is MDP)  and a MBA from August 2011.  I would like to make a unified setup.\nWhat devices can be used as monitors for other devices?  For example, I know that I can use an MDP cable to connect the MBP to the old imac.\n\nA: The following options will work for you:\n\n\n*\n\n*old iMac as a display for MBP, MBA and new iMac. Use a mDP cable.\n\n*new iMac as a display for MBA. Use a TB cable.\n\n\nA: From what I understand, the devices need to have the same connector technology, i.e. a Mini DisplayPort device will talk to another one, and a Thunderbolt device will talk to another one, but you can't cross connector technologies—no Mini DisplayPort on one side, Thunderbolt on the other.\n\nA: The matrix is simple - matched icons on the ports is a winning combination. \nVideo in requires matching cable and port on the sending mac.  (If all don't match, it won't work.)\nDisplay mirroring (where an iMac can receive video input) only works thunderbolt to thunderbolt or displayport to displayport\nThe  backwards compatibility between the formats only works when a displayport monitor is connected to a thunderbolt mac. \n", "Q: Application to automatically find related documents on your entire Mac? DEVONthink has a “See Also” feature that shows you documents that the software thinks are related to the one you are currently viewing. I would like to experiment more with using this feature. Unfortunately, AFAIK DEVONthink limits its search for related documents to those that you've put inside the same DEVONthink database. I'm — at least at this time — not interested in using DEVONthink exclusively to organize all of my documents.\nIs there any application that offers a similar “See Also” feature that's more integrated with the Finder and that looks for documents on your entire Mac (or a specified set of folders)? Or perhaps DEVONthink can also be configured to do this?\n\nA: This will be extraordinarily difficult to do at run-time, and with any document.  The few solutions that have implemented this technology (remembrance agent http://www.remem.org/ and Dashboard http://nat.org/dashboard/ are probably the most notable and \"successful\") required specific search indexers for each type of application and up-front document analysis.  (Very much how you can't search in Spotlight while it is \"updating\".)\nFor example, if you typed the word \"from\", you would not necessarily want to see all of your email messages just because they all feature the word as part of their metadata.  However, if you typed \"Art Taylor\", you would expect to see email, chat, and other documents related to me.\nThe problem is of summarizing the semantic content from the structural content.  That's why DEVONthink requires you to import the documents.  It can summarize the documents and present results more or less in real time, because it has done the summarization up front.  Spotlight does some of this as well, but no great context aware knowledge and memory augmentation applications have popped up that offer universal document support.\nIf you google \"knowledge augmentation\", you will find a large number of articles and papers on the topic.  People are very interested in this and I think it is just a matter of time before someone attacks the problem with a commercial solution.  Gordon Bell had a tantalizing project called \"MyLifeBits\" http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/mylifebits/ that was a little over the top, but IBM http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/24750.wss is doing some research on associative recall.  Note the \"Capture\" and \"Ingest\" stages.  The scope of both of these is much beyond simple document relationships.\nYears ago, I tried the DEVONthink \"put it all in there\" approach, and as you probably suspect, it was a disaster.\nBest of luck.\n", "Q: How do I get syntax highlighting of source code files within Quick Look back in Lion? Source code files viewed using Quick Look on Snow Leopard had syntax highlighting. Unfortunately the syntax highlighting has disappeared on OS X Lion. Is there a way to get it back?\n\nA: I don't think Snow Leopard did that by default, you most likely had a QuickLook plugin installed, such as qlcolorcode or colorqc2. You can simply install this again in Lion.\n\nA: Actually, Xcode 3.x included a Quicklook plugin for source codes. With the intruduction of Xcode 4.x, such plugin has disappeared. \nI have personallly tried to use qlcolorcode and colorqc2 on Lion, but both are not stable/reliable enough (slow response, sometimes missing quicklook). An updated version of the plugins would be welcome.\n\nA: The Xcode 3 plugin was found at /Developer/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Library/QuickLook/SourceCode.qlgenerator\nUnfortunately I don't think this can be made to work now. :(\n\nA: Guys you can do this procedure bellow:\nTo fix this, open a new Terminal window and enter these commands to open vim’s configuration file:\n$ cd /usr/share/vim\n$ sudo vim vimrc\n\nPress the i key to switch vim to Insertion Mode, then enter these lines below the set backspace=2 line:\nset ai                  \" auto indenting\nset history=100         \" keep 100 lines of history\nset ruler               \" show the cursor position\nsyntax on               \" syntax highlighting\nset hlsearch            \" highlight the last searched term\nfiletype plugin on      \" use the file type plugins\n\n\" When editing a file, always jump to the last cursor position\nautocmd BufReadPost *\n\\ if ! exists(\"g:leave_my_cursor_position_alone\") |\n\\ if line(\"'\\\"\") > 0 && line (\"'\\\"\") <= line(\"$\") |\n\\ exe \"normal g'\\\"\" |\n\\ endif |\n\\ endif\n\nPress the ⎋ esc key to take vim out of Insertion Mode, then press : (colon) followed by x to save the file and exit.\nIt worked for me thanks.\n", "Q: iPad as a wireless webcam Can I use my iPad as a wireless webcam for my PC?

Kinda like Air Video but reversed. I haven't been able to figure out how to do it; has anyone else figured it out?\nThanks!\n\nA: How about PocketCam?

I'm using BootCamp to install Windows 7 on my Mac. On both OS I'm using Firefox 6. Is there an easy way to automatically share the favorites in both OS?\n\nA: If you're running Firefox 4 or higher, you can use Firefox's built-in sync capabilities to keep multiple instances of Firefox in sync across different operating systems and machines.\nC|Net has a nice video that shows you how to set it up.\n\nA: I guess you can use the Xmarks service.

I have mapped the keys via Mission Control preFpane as follows: F9 is 'Mission Control', F10 is 'Show Desktop'. F11 is 'Application Windows'\nF9 and F11 works as intended. F10 seems to not do anything.\nI thought it might be the keys themselves so I mapped the keys as: F9 'Show Desktop', F10 'Mission Control' and F11 'Application Windows'.\nIn this case only F10 and F11 keys worked; This small test gives me the impression that it is the Exposé 'Show Desktop' function itself is the part that is malfunctioning.\nDoes anybody have any further insight to this bug?\nEDIT\nYou can view a recording of the problem here:\nhttp://www.screencast.com/t/oDVMhBqkb\nNOTE\nThis problem was tested initially on my external keyboard, the problem does persist on the internal macbook keyboard. Those '4 finger swipe' works, as does the 'Cmd + Expose(f3)' keyboard shortcut work.\n\nA: Restart Dock, of which Mission Control is a child process.  In terminal, run:\nkillall Dock\n\nA: I've solved this by deleting following plist files in ~/Library/Preferences. By default, they are hidden. Warning! Your Dock will revert to default state. Shortcuts and everything else will remain.\ncom.apple.dashboard.plist\ncom.apple.dashboard.plist.lockfile\ncom.apple.desktop.plist\ncom.apple.desktop.plist.lockfile\ncom.apple.dock.plist\ncom.apple.dock.plist.lockfile\ncom.apple.dock.3A51CCF9-CDE4-5F17-8CFB-FF648B8A6CDF (or similar)\ncom.apple.dock.3A51CCF9-CDE4-5F17-8CFB-FF648B8A6CDF.plist.lockfile\n\nAt my system (fresh 10.7.2 installation), this affected only Function keys (F1 row). I still could set Show desktop to Modifier keys or Mouse buttons.\n\nA: I recently used MLpostfactor to upgrade my 2007 MacBook to Mountain Lion 10.8.3 from 10.7.5.  Since this is officially unsupported, I had a few glitches.  The most annoying was that Mission Control would display, but showed NO spaces and would not allow any to be added.  Deleting the preference files in the answer fixed my problem.  Mission Control now works completely.  This is the only reference I have located on deleting the Mission Control preferences.  \n", "Q: Mingler allocated most of RAM The Mingler process periodically allocates most of the RAM I have on my MacBook Pro, bringing it to a halt. I have never just let it run, though I am doing that now just to see what will happen. I've read through discussions at support.apple.com and none of those helped. How can I control Mingler? More generally, is there a way to limit processes using a system resource on Mac OS X Lion?\n\nA: I think Mingler is a process related to iCal or the Sync Utility.\nsee here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2178706?threadID=2178706 for more details as of how to make it go aways.\n\nA: Mingler is responsible for doing a lot of the work of the deprecated Sync Services framework -- iCloud contacts, bookmarks, calendar entries, etc. that are divergent between your Mac and the cloud are sorted out by this process.\nThere can be a lot of different reasons why it may go haywire; corrupt data of some sort is usually a good lead. You can try disabling the different sync options in the iCloud preference pane and see which, if any, improves matters. (See TidBITS here http://tidbits.com/article/12796 for an example of corrupt bookmark sync.)\nYou can also try disabling legacy Sync Services in Outlook (if you use it) and other forms of contact or calendar sync and then reset the Sync Services database, via Apple's instructions here: OS X: Resetting Sync Services (Internet archive)\nIf your machine is still covered by AppleCare (or even if it's not), I encourage you to report these issues on Apple's support site or via a Genius Bar appointment. This problem is prevalent enough that it deserves more attention from Apple.\n", "Q: How do I sync my iCal with an Android smart phone from T-Mobile? I am a T-Mobile customer wanting to upgrade to a smart phone.\nI would like to be able to sync my Macbook iCal to Gravity Smart or Mytouch 3G.\nIs this possible without being complicated?\n\nA: iCal speaks CalDAV and Exchange active sync - so you have many choices to sync your phone to any server that makes sense to you. \nGoogle calendars work well for a free solution, but it is only one of many services that you could use. \n\nA: Probably the easiest way is to Sync your iCal to a Google account and then sync the phone from google. Android phones are very easy to sync with any google service and they get push notifications, push email, etc., as long as it's associated with a gmail account. \nOf course, that means you have to use iCal connected with Google and if you don't like google services, you're hosed. On the other hand, if you don't like google services, don't get an android phone, most of the \"best\" features work side by side with gmail. \nFor professional reasons, I had to switch to Android phones and the first thing I did was move all my Apple stuff to Google and then sync from there. Whether you prefer iOS or Android doesn't change the fact that once everything is in Sync, the Android/Google thing works ok too. \n", "Q: Best File System for Sharing Between OS X and Windows What is currently the best file system to use for drives that are regularly accessed (both reading and writing) from both Windows and OS X on a single machine using BootCamp. The most important points are stability and speed.\nI've been using NTFS so far, coming from a Windows background. I've tried the NTFS-3G driver with Fuse and, in my tests, it was far slower than native NTFS under Windows. I also tried their commercial driver without much better results.\nAfterward I tried Paragon's drivers, which were much faster. They aren't quite native NTFS speed, but they aren't far off either. The problem is I've had crashes with them, and recently had crashes + data loss with them.\nI know this question has been asked before, but the posts I saw were older and the driver and filesystem options are maturing.\nOptions I've seen:\n\n\n*\n\n*FAT32: Limited drive size? Limited permission settings\n\n*NTFS: Limited speed/stability under OS X\n\n*HFS+: MacDrive? available for Windows\n\n\nFollow Up\nI have now formatted one of the drives as exFAT and can confirm that this works great for both reading and writing when the machine is booted into either OS X or Windows 7.\n\nA: If you're working exclusively with Win7 machines (i.e. no Vista or XP), and 10.6.6 or greater on the Mac side, try exFAT. Native read/write support under Win7 and OS X, and none of the file size limits of FAT32. Disk Utility will happily format your drives using it.\nAs long as you don't need legacy support, it's probably your best option, as it avoids any user-space filesystem drivers, which personally make me a bit uneasy.\nAddendum: XP and Vista do support exFAT, Vista as of SP1, and XP with SP2 and the KB955704 update\n\nA: If you care about your data stick with ntfs or fat32(4G filesize limit!). \nHad multiple drives formatted to exFat in order to use them with both operating systems (osx/win) and i cant remember when i lost so many files in such a short period of time. To my luck I had backups of everything lost.\nMy best experience with ntfs on mac so far is the driver by paragon - cant tell a difference from a natively supported filesystem. Tuxera and ntfs-3g gave me trouble with performance and reliability.\nIf you want to stick with exFAT you have to disable caching/buffering as this leads to data corruption on any error - be extra cautious on external drives (check connection, unmount before unplugging). exFAT was designed for portable battery powered devices with continiuos uncached writes, like camcorders or digital cameras and doesnt support any kind of journaling.\n", "Q: What can I do to check the integrity of the hard drive and all its files, to see if they are corrupt or not? Recently there has been some files disappearing (in iTunes), and I'm not so sure of the extent of this problem yet. Perhaps it may have been an iTunes upgrade bug, but I'm not so sure.\nWhat can I do to check the integrity of the hard drive and of all the files on my Mac computer, to see if they are corrupt or not?\nIs there a hard drive integrity checker that I can use on my Mac? \n\nA: Disk Utility does a very cursory scan of your disk, and should be your first software to consult should you suspect any problems with your disk. Select the option to Verify Disk from the main window. If all tests pass and the drive is marked \"OK\", but you still suspect a problem (or would like to do a more thorough scan, I suggest picking up SMARTReporter (non-free utility, costs money) and doing a much more in-depth scan.\nTo run the test, you will have to right click on the disk icon that will be placed in your system tray. Then right click the drive you wish to test and you will see a list of options:\n\nSMARTReporter can perform deeper and more meaningful scans, and can also print specific attributes and thresholds. Below are the results of my OCZ Vertex2 SSD:\nVendor Specific SMART Attributes with Thresholds:\nID# ATTRIBUTE_NAME          FLAG     VALUE WORST THRESH TYPE      UPDATED  WHEN_FAILED RAW_VALUE\n  1 Raw_Read_Error_Rate     0x000f   110   107   050    Pre-fail  Always       -       0/31869480\n  5 Retired_Block_Count     0x0033   100   100   003    Pre-fail  Always       -       0\n  9 Power_On_Hours_and_Msec 0x0032   100   100   000    Old_age   Always       -       7333h+33m+30.980s\n 12 Power_Cycle_Count       0x0032   100   100   000    Old_age   Always       -       89\n171 Program_Fail_Count      0x0032   000   000   000    Old_age   Always       -       0\n172 Erase_Fail_Count        0x0032   000   000   000    Old_age   Always       -       0\n174 Unexpect_Power_Loss_Ct  0x0030   000   000   000    Old_age   Offline      -       10\n177 Wear_Range_Delta        0x0000   000   000   000    Old_age   Offline      -       0\n181 Program_Fail_Count      0x0032   000   000   000    Old_age   Always       -       0\n182 Erase_Fail_Count        0x0032   000   000   000    Old_age   Always       -       0\n187 Reported_Uncorrect      0x0032   100   100   000    Old_age   Always       -       0\n194 Temperature_Celsius     0x0022   030   030   000    Old_age   Always       -       30 (Min/Max 30/30)\n195 ECC_Uncorr_Error_Count  0x001c   110   107   000    Old_age   Offline      -       0/31869480\n196 Reallocated_Event_Count 0x0033   100   100   000    Pre-fail  Always       -       0\n231 SSD_Life_Left           0x0013   100   100   010    Pre-fail  Always       -       0\n233 SandForce_Internal      0x0000   000   000   000    Old_age   Offline      -       2432\n234 SandForce_Internal      0x0032   000   000   000    Old_age   Always       -       2880\n241 Lifetime_Writes_GiB     0x0032   000   000   000    Old_age   Always       -       2880\n242 Lifetime_Reads_GiB      0x0032   000   000   000    Old_age   Always       -       5440\n\nPay special attention to the Reallocated_Event_Count value, as that is the number of blocks that have been found to be \"bad.\" If you see a high count, that could likely indicate problems with the drive and thus problems with the integrity of your filesystem.\nThis will give you a better idea as to the health of your current drive.\nShould Disk Utility find any problems, repairing the primary partition (that houses your OS) will require a reboot. When you hear the boot chime, hold down the OPTION key and select Recovery HD from the list. Then launch Disk Utility from the menu bar. From there, you can repair your main partition.\n\nA: You can verify the S.M.A.R.T. status of your hard drive at a glance using the System Information utility. (S.M.A.R.T. stands for \"Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology.)\n\n\nA: You can use the application \"Disk Utility\" that comes with every Mac. The application lives in your /Applications/Utilities/ folder, but is best when running it off of the Restore Disks that came with the computer. If you restart your computer with the disk in and hold C it will boot to the installer screen. In the menu bar in the top you can choose \"Utilities\", under there will be Disk Utility. In disk utility I would recommend clicking on the hard drive on the list on the left, then click the \"Repair Disk\" button on the bottom right. I recommend running the utility off of the CD solely because you aren't checking the files while some files may be in use for the Operating System. This offers the quickest and most reliable verification and potential repair. \n\nA: My favorite disk maintenance software is probably DiskWarrior. It seems to fix more of my problems than the others. But it's rather spartan in other features. Definitely one to have in your toolkit.\nTechtool Pro 6 is a great program. It does close to what DiskWarrior can do, but has all sorts of other features. Including creating a small partition on a hard drive that you can boot into to run maintenance utilities. You can also put other makers' utilities in there. It also has Safari and some other OS X features so you can research problems on the web while fixing. Though they do recommend not running other programs while fixing the boot drive.\nDriveGenius 3 is a good one as well with its own set of tools.\nBut for checking disk integrity specifically, to see if imminent failure is there, all three of them check the S.M.A.R.T. status of your drive. Techtool Pro's S.M.A.R.T. checker is the most comprehensive. It helped me diagnose a whole batch of Maxtor 500 gig drives I had bought about six year ago (about 18 of them) and sure enough, within a few months, more than half of them began failing. \nYou can also use what's built into OS X. I have found Disk Utility has fixed things none of the others could fix.\nAnd then you can start OS X up in single user mode (Raw UNIX) and check the drive as well. Here's how you do that:\nBoot the computer and immediately hold down Command + S.\nYou'll see text scrolling and then terminal will appear. It gives the instructions I'm about to type right there so you don't have to have it written down.\nfirst you type:\n/sbin/fsck -fy\nand press enter.\nIt will run through checks and tell you if the drive appears to be okay, and if it has modified the drive. In the last few versions of OS X, if something is modified it will run the test again automatically. Once it reports the drive appears to be okay, you can go back into standard OS X.\nTo do that, type:\n/sbin/mount -uw /\nHit return\ntype:\nreboot\nHit return and it will reboot and start up normally. I use this every time I have a kernel panic or the computer locks up. Though with Lion I have it set to restart automatically if it hangs. So I'm ready to hold down Command + S as soon as I hear the boot chime.\nHope that's not too much information. :-)\n", "Q: Weird chrome icon on my macbook pro? I am using MacBook pro. I have this weird chrome icon:\n\nI dont know if its the official chrome icon, but it looks damaged or spoiled to me. If you are also using chrome on your macbook, does your icon looks like mine too?\n\nA: I would suggest reinstalling Google Chrome rather than going to the trouble of manually replacing the icon. Download it here.\nOh, and to restore all your bookmarks, history, etc., go to Prefs>Personal Stuff>Sync. Login with your Google Account and ta da! All your bookmarks and data are synced. Then, when you reinstall Chrome, login again, and all your data will be restored.\n\nA: Definitely not normal. Given that it appears normally in your dock, it suggests that maybe one of the larger size icons (there are typically several different sized icon files in the .app bundle) is corrupt. You could either reinstall Chrome (which should keep your preferences intact, but it's best to back them up just in case), or you can redownload it, but not reinstall, and manually replace the icon files.\nTo manually replace the icon files, you'd want to open up the app bundle (right/command-click > Show Package Contents) for both your installed version and the one from the downloaded .dmg and copy the applicable .icns file from the downloaded version to your installed version. That file should be in the Resources folder of the package contents. Looking at my Chrome install suggests you probably want app.icns, but double check, QuickLook should show you what's what.\n\nA: I would bet that the problem lies in Lion somewhere.  Your Dock icon and the Chrome icon in your app folder look fine.  It is only in Launchpad that you have the problem.\nTry this:  Delete the icon in Launchpad, because that is where the error is.  That will probably delete Google Chrome.\nRestart or logout then back in.  If necessary, re-install Chrome.  Now add it to Launchpad if it is not already there.\nPlease post the result of whatever you try and what succeeded.\n", "Q: How do I remove a user via single user mode in 10.7? I occasionally will setup a user's machine that has been in for repair beyond the simple re-install of the OS. For example: install a new hd, install the OS, create a user, install updates and then reboot into single user mode running a slew of commands to remove that user and give the machine back to the client with the welcome video on boot. \nBelow are the commands for 10.5 and 10.6 I have used over the years that is a walk-thru for any tech to accomplish regardless of experience. The 10.5 one has worked with 10.6 too, with the exception of line 8 or 9 due to some changes.\nI'd like to find a list of commands or a script or something that would be the most proper and efficient way to do this in 10.7.

Can I wipe it clean and use non-server edition? As the title says. I have a Mac Mini server--I bought it because I liked the lack of a optical drive. I don't really care to use the software, and now having to spend an additional $50 on Lion's \"Server\" add-on is meh. \nCan I wipe the machine clean and install a fresh 10.7, non-server edition?\n\nA: Yes.  I am currently using a late 2009 Mac mini Server with both Snow Leopard and Lion (non-server editions).\n\nA: I went the route of loading the InstallESD.dmg file onto a USB thumb drive and booting from it (holding down the option key). This worked like a charm. No issues/unusual steps due it the system having 10.6 Server installed beforehand.\nThe directions I followed are from here: http://mashable.com/2011/07/20/lion-clean-install-guide/#20859Step-1-Download-Lion-From-the-Mac-App-Store\n\nA: I'm only after seeing this post.

I also tried command option R P.\nI don't know what to do. help me guys.\n\nA: I had the same issue several months ago. After many hours of unsuccessful troubleshooting, I brought it to genius bar at apple store and was told to reinstall system software. It solved the problem!\n\nA: Try the following:\nGo to Audio Midi Setup and switch the Output Format away from 44.1khz and back again.\nAnd I once had to uninstall Elmedia Player for Mac (esp. empdaemon) to prevent sudden loss of sound.\nhttp://mac.eltima.com/media-player.html\n(To prevent your MacBook from overheating esp. on very hot days have a look at smcFanControl or FanControl, http://www.lobotomo.com/products/FanControl/index.html).\n\nA: Sounds like a hardware issue. Depending on your resources you could try running a separate install of OSX on the machine from an external drive to see if the problem persists. You could even go as far as doing a reinstall of the OS.\nHowever, I would recommend taking it into Apple themselves or an authorised service provider. They'll be able to tell you exactly what's failing and how much it'd cost to fix (assuming you're out of warranty).\nDepending on which generation your machine is, and then which component has failed, this could be cheap (it could be the audio/IO board if machine is a 2006 to early 2008 Macbook Pro), but is likely going to be a logic board issue - which is usually not an economically viable fix due to silly costs.\n", "Q: iPhone alarm clock sometimes doesn't work I can't count how often I overslept since I'm using my iPhone as my main alarm clock. I can't reproduce it and it's happening without any observable frequency of occurrence. Here is all I know:\n\n\n*\n\n*My iPhone is not jailbroken and I've already done a complete reset for several times.\n\n*The volume is loud enough. I test the volume of the alarm clock before I go to sleep and it's definitely loud enough. In addition, the iPhone is lying in a distance of 15 inches from my head.\n\n*I'm not sleepwalking, so it's impossible that I turn off the alarm clocks at night. ;)\n\n*Most of the time I set three or four alarm clocks with intervals of 15 or 20 minutes. Just to get that I'm so glad I can sleep another 15 minutes - feeling.\n\n*As I already mentioned, the malfunction does not always occur. The alarm clock does work sometimes. The first alarm clock goes off at 5:30, another one at 5:45, I get up and go to work. But in 30 % to 50 % of the cases, it does not go off and I'm late for work, in a bad mood and really stressed.\n\n*When I realize I have overslept I first have a look at my iPhone. When I unlock it, I see that there is still the message I programmed for the alarm clock to display when activated! Like Get up! or something. That's very strange because it implies that the alarm has been activated but only the message is shown and no sound.\n\n*I've got no other problems with my iPhone (besides a synchronizing issue I got the Tumbleweed badge for). Sound is working fine, settings are always applied.\n\n*It's not an issue of push-messages being displayed. I first assumed that it could be a push message from Google+ or a news-app I'm using but the malfunction is also occurring without any push-messages being displayed.\n\n*I've been searching the net for a solution and found the issue of iPhone alarm clocks going off one hour late. That is not my problem, because - as I already said - the alarm seems to go off, but without sound.\n\n*I'm not deaf.\n\n\nThe iPhone:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 4 32GB\n\n*iOS 4.3.5\n\n*No jailbreak\n\n\nI hope one of you has a solution for this problem, because I would feel very strange buying an old school alarm clock. :) But I think I have to, if I can't fix this malfunction of my iPhone.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I have written up a procedure for you to try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restore your phone.\n\n*Test - if successful go to last.\n\n*Take your iPhone to the nearest Apple store and tell them what's happening.\n\n*Test the issue with the refurbished iPhone they gave you to replace the one that was malfunctioning - if successful go to last.\n\n*Enjoy your \"15 more minutes\" feeling.\n\n\nFailing all of these, your alarm is going off and you're sleeping through it because you stayed up too late playing WoW, drinking, coding, whatever. It eventually stops making noise and leaves the message on the screen. Try placing the phone across the room so you have to get up to turn it off. See if that helps. Either way, now you have a newly refurbished iPhone 4.\nPlease forgive the snarky nature of this answer. I wrote it after my alarm didn't go off in the morning due to a push notification.\n\nA: When you create a new alarm, there will be a menu above the section where you choose the time. Make sure to select the \"sound\" option. It's possible that your sound was set to \"off\" for your alarm. This solved my problem.\n\nA: I had the same issue. Hold down the home button until Siri pops up then turn up your volume. Somehow Siri has its own volume. Try it; it can't hurt.\n\nA: I had the same problem. Apparently, Apple has two separate volume controls on the iPhone. One controls regular volume (music, games, etc.) and one controls ringers and alerts. While they are sometimes on the same setting, my ringer and alert volume was turned off even though regular sound was on.\nTo fix this, I went to Settings - Sounds and turned Ringer and Alert Volume back on.\n\nA: You could try Beautiful Clock Radio; works every time for me and has radio.\n\nA: So you are not crazy. I experienced the same thing. That button on the side sometimes doesn't go all the way up. Just flicker it up and down really fast, and end with it on. It should work then. If it doesn't than go to Settings → Sound and turn everything on and the volume up.\n\nA: It's calendar bug. I figured that the same day I have something scheduled on my calendar the alarm does go off but without a sound.\n\nA: Revise your alarm app settings. There is an option to \"repeat\" to set your alarm as needed Monday–Sunday; this has all been compacted on the same page.\n\nA: I have the exact same problem with the 6 plus.\n\n\n*\n\n*I know how to use my phone - including the volume - thanks!\n\n*They will go off, but stop after a certain time. I'm a deep sleeper.\n\n*Apparently if you sleep thru one alarm, the message displays with no sound or vibe and successive alarms with not play through. Period.\nNo push msgs, no operator malfunction. \n\n\nJust a programming glitch that Apple hasn't addressed yet with a bug fix.\n\nA: I had this happen on my iPad. Underneath the timer (circle) itself is a word that displays what music or sound you selected for your timer sound.  Beneath your sound choices is an option 'Stop Playing'.  I don't know how I did it, but that was selected on mine.  Just go to the sound choice (above that) that you want and select that sound (it will 'de-select 'Stop Playing' when you do that.). Also check the volume level selector on the right side to make sure the volume is on, or up (the 'longer' button on the right side.) Hope this helps...:)\n\nA: This was happening to me as well. \niPhone 6 w/ iOS 9.1\nWoke up late to the silent \"alarm\" notification. To troubleshoot, I set a new one for the next minute. It would vibrate, but even though the volume was all the way up, the alarm sound was barely audible. Tried again after deleting that alarm entirely and creating a new one. Same thing. Did a hard reset of my phone and that fixed it. \nNo root cause, but at least a fix. \n\nA: Forget all the information above. I experience the same problem all the time. It is a fault with the iPhone, insofar as it just 'jams'. Please report to Apple as it just glitching and more users must have the same problem and think they have a 'possessed' phone, or they forgot to set the alarm.\n\nA: You probably have your Alarm ringtone set to \"none\" accidentally.  I'm telling you my personal experience. \nEverything was good with my new iPhone and every night when I set up an alarm to wake up in the morning it never buzzed and I end up going to work late till one day I realized that I was playing with alarm ringtones and accidentally set it \"None\". \nI hope my answer help you. \n", "Q: How do I forward a meeting request from my iPhone?

It would work like the Bamboo Pen Tablet like the one in the \"graphics tablet\" link.\n\nA: The answer to your question is Avatron's AirPad software. http://avatron.com/apps/air-display I've just downloaded the Windows version and so far it seems stable enough, though I'm sure the Mac version is even more solid, since the Windows version appears to be relatively new.\nThat having been said, it's pretty impressive and does exactly what you want to do EXCEPT of course, there's no touch sensitivity, and there will always be a bit of lag (heck, Graphic tablets have lag too, believe it, but just a lot less).\nCheck it out!\n\nA: An iPad doesn't offer the same capabilities as a Wacom graphics tablet. At best--Eazel excepted--you'll only be able to control the cursor on the mac or pc. There are many of those types of programs for the iPad in iTunes from the free touch mouse (iPhone only) to iTeleport (iPad, US$25). \nGraphics tablets aren't that expensive, especially compared to an iPad. The cheapest Wacom tablet in the USA goes for $200 or so. Ask someone you know to give you one for your birthday or appropriate holiday. If you know enough people, you might even be able to find one for free. I gave away my old Wacom Graphire last year when I bought a new Intuos. Ebay shows used Graphires for a variety of prices; make sure used tablets include the pen and mouse.\nI also have made video tutorials using a graphics tablet and Photoshop. I have not settled on which video capture software to use. There are too many for me recommend one.\n\nA: If you have Photoshop CS5, check out Eazel.\n\nA: Extra late post, but it might be useful for anyone searching this subsequently.\nAstropad is the app you need if you are using a Mac desktop, it is excellent.\n", "Q: Synchronize calendar between Mac, Android mobile and Windows 7 I´m currently using my Mac with Lion. Using Bootcamp I installed Windows 7. I also have an Android phone. Now I´m looking for a calendar software that allows me to synchronize between all three OS. It should not be an online solution.\n\nA: Your best option is probably Google Calendar. It is an \"online solution\", but you don't have to make use of the webapp at all, just use it as a method to sync.\nFor OSX, you can use iCal synced to Google Calendar using CalDAV. It's not perfectly polished, but it works fine. You may need to enable any other calendars via the Delegation tab, under Accounts in the iCal preferences.\nI'm not an Android guy, but I think Google Calendar support should be automatically set up when you activate your device with a Google account.\nFor Windows 7, it depends what app you're wanting to use. It looks like they removed the Calendar app from Vista. The simplest option may be this desktop gadget that syncs to Google Calendar. If you're looking to use other software, Google provides a sync option for Outlook, or you can use anything that supports the CalDAV standard.\n\nA: Selecting bootcamp severely narrows your options.\nThe prevailing solution for nearly all calendar clients is to use CalDAV/Exchange for sync. Unless you are OK with storing your calendar data on a file server (like TimeCapsule) or FAT external storage that will let a cross-platform client that use one common data store sharing the same file format, you will need to have one if your OS to mount the others native file system to read/write the calendar data.  \nOnce you get that working, you can decide how best to sync your mobile device. \nMy guess is nothing self-contained will be workable and you will either host your own CalDAV store locally or co-located (hello lion server!) or you will have to relax your exclusion of online solutions.  \n", "Q: Which are main technical reasons to switch to Lion? Everywhere I just read posts and questions about how to make lion like snow leopard.\nSo... Why not keeping snow leopard, at least while lion's \"young\"?\nAre there any technical / cosmetic reasons for the switch?\n\nA: Lion's improved security is worth a mention. Don't get me wrong, Lion still has its share of security issues (see LDAP and enterprise updates).  But Apple's inclusion of sandboxing, full hard disk encryption, and a better ASLR goes a long way to reducing exposure to a wide variety of attacks.\n\nA: There are no \"technical reasons\" per se. I'll quickly list my pros/cons but they are definitely personal.\n1. Pros\n\n\n*\n\n*The uppgrade is pretty smooth and straightforward.\n\n*It really does have a nicer 'look and feel'\n\n*Most of the applications you can be using are already Lion Compatible\n\n*It's the cheapest OS you can find\n\n\n2. Cons\n\n\n*\n\n*If you use XCode you'll HAVE to reinstall a new version (4.1.1)\n(and that honestly is a big hitch which i didn't know about)\n\n*The scrollbars !! : they are switched at first (up is down) but can\nbe reversed and they are now iPhone like which is still annoying when you use a black background app that didn't change the scrollbar color. (basically you don't see them)\nThere could be much more things to say but Ars Technica did the best review you can find on the web.\nI personally made the leap and really not regretting it so far.\n\nA: The principal compelling reason for upgrading to any new operating system version always comes down to the applications you want to run. When you find a new application, or a newer version of an older application, that you want to run, and you learn that this version of the application requires the newer operating system, that's when you want to consider upgrading.\nI upgraded to Lion early because I'm a professional technical support technician, and I have to train myself be familiar with Lion when my clients start calling for help using Lion. If I were not a professional support technician, I would wait a lot longer to make the change.\n\nA: Lion does have a lot of new Language features for those who need them:\nhttp://m10lmac.blogspot.com/2011/07/os-x-107-lion-adds-major-new-language.html\n", "Q: Does Time Machine make a backup of Windows if using Boot Camp? I'm using Windows 7 on my Mac. On the Lion OS I installed Time Machine to keep a backup of my Laptop. Does this backup also cover the Windows partition?\n\nA: No, Time Machine does not do this. The only reliable way to back up your BootCamp partition is to boot into Windows and run Windows-compatible disk backup software from within Windows, to back up to a separate external hard drive formatted with NTFS.\nWinclone has not been updated in a long time and is not a useful solution.\n\nA: As far as I know, it won't.\nCheck out Winclone.\n", "Q: Scanner sharing service stops after logout. How do I make it always share? I'm sharing a scanner from a Mid 2007 iMac (10.6.8, USB scanner over wired ethernet). I've enabled sharing on the local admin account and it all works well on the other Macs that are using the scanner.\nHowever, after logging out, the scanner stops being shared and immediately drops out of the list of \"Shared devices\" available on the other Macs (in Image Capture).\nLogging back in to the account that set up scanner sharing reenables scanner sharing and it all works again. If I log into another account that hasn't previously set up scanner sharing, it's not enabled.\nHow can I get the scanner sharing service to run all the time for all users, even when no one is logged into the iMac?\n\nA: You might have to set up a default user that logs in automatically and shares the scanner after a reboot. You could have it password protected, non administrator, with a short timer on the screen saver to lock the screen after a power failure if you care about that sort of thing.\nSnow Leopard just doesn't mount external drives or start the sharing software when a user is not logged in.\nI have long kept around an old mac mini to serve up iTunes and a scanner for my network rather than mess with a \"fake account\" as I proposed.\n", "Q: Secondary display with VGA connection resolution issue with Macbook Pro under Snow Leopard I am on a MBP Early 2011, running Snow Leopard and am facing a strange issue. If I boot up my system and try to connect to my external display using the MDP->VGA adapter, System Settings won't show the correct resolution for the secondary display. I can see 1440x1050 and 1600x1200, and even if I hit Detect Displays, nothing will change.\nWhat is my workaround? Connect using MDP->DVI adapter, which will identify the correct resolution of the display (1680x1050), and then fall back to the VGA Adapter to surprisingly see the native resolution of my display listed!!\nDo you guys know what is going on here? Thank you in advance.\n\nA: Either the VGA cable you are using (or DVI-VGA adaptor, if you're using that) isn't correctly wired for EDID monitor identification, or the monitor itself is sending incorrect EDID information. \nTry another VGA cable (or DVI-VGA adaptor, if you're using one) and see if that resolves the problem.  If not, it's likely that your monitor doesn't implement EDID over the VGA connector correctly.\n\nA: I had this issue with a MBP Retina mid 2012 as I often plug and unplug my laptop from my workstation. The simple solution is to unplug the VGA adaptor from your Mac and the cable and try again. That has worked for me 90% of the time ;) \n\nA: I had the exact same issue, it's to do with OS X not getting a confirmation from the monitor of it's correct resolution and picking random defaults. Your workaround is pretty much the best way to go, or you can try SwitchResX and try a virtual solution.\n", "Q: USSD application for the iPad 2? Are there any applications that allow you to send USSD commands to your data service provider using the iPad 2?\nRemoving the SIM card from the iPad and inserting it into another phone to send out a USSD command just to buy more data does tend to get a bit frustrating at times.\n\nA: There's an application called QueryUSSD available on Cydia for jailbroken phones. There's an article on iPhoneZA about how to use it and what kind of codes are available.\n", "Q: Recovery HD mounts on startup Recently I was messing around with Backtrack 4r2, and created a USB \"live CD\" and started from it. I normally run the live CD in a VM, but wanted to see if I could install it on the USB as a separate HDD. Normally, I experiment on VMs as well, but decided to go against my better judgement. This corrupted my startup disk, and for a little bit I had the folder with the question mark. The internal SSD was there untouched, but the starting sequenced was affected. I tried using rEFIt to get back into it, but the system did not recognize the SSD. Finally, I went in with GParted on the live CD, and made the Mac Book Air boot from the \"Recovery HD\". I used the terminal in the \"Recovery HD\" to correct my permission, and made the correct area of the SSD my boot disk. I am running Lion 10.7.1, so trying to build a \"Recovery USB\" was impossible since the app store would only let me access Lion 10.7. Onto the question: \nLion now mounts the \"Recovery HD\" upon start up, and it didn't before. How can I make it to where it doesn't? As stated, I tried repairing the install, but the App Store only has 10.7, so Lion blocks it as an \"older\" version.\n\nA: this hint suggests\nasr adjust --target /dev/disk0s3 -settype \"Apple_Boot\"\nP.S. use diskutil list to confirm that your \"Recovery HD\" is disk0s3: it should show like this:\n$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            499.4 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n\n", "Q: Can websites be locked down on the iPad? In our network, we use NetMotion to lock down laptops in the field so they can only access what we allow them to access (no ESPN, news, Google) in the truck. As we look at iPad 3Gs (and similar competitors), we want to be sure we keep the same tight control on what websites they visit (and have internal access to network resources at the same time). Is this possible? \nVPN isn't really effective unless there is a way for it to be forced on at all times.\n\nA: apple.com, ipad for business:\nhttp://www.apple.com/ipad/business/resources/\nFrom disabling Safari completely (allowSafari=false) to functional options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable autofill: When this option is off, Safari doesn’t remember what users enter in web forms.\n\n*Force Fraud warning: When this option is off, Safari doesn’t attempt\nto prevent the user from visiting websites identified as being\nfraudulent or compromised.\n\n*Enable JavaScript: When this option is\noff, Safari ignores all javascript on websites.\n\n*Block pop-ups: When\nthis option is off, Safari’s pop-up blocking feature is disabled.\n\n*Accept cookies: Sets Safari’s cookie policy. Choose to accept all\ncookies, accept no cookies, or reject cookies from sites not directly\naccessed.\n\n\nThereby you can limit the iPad to only apps (and webapps) installed by you.\n\nA: Yes - the first step will be to require by policy that users do not remove the profiles you have installed on the iPads. \nSecond you will get the iPhone configuration utility and establish a profile that forces restrictions on the iPad. \nWithout diving too deeply, you have several options:\n\n\n*\n\n*require a web proxy that handles the filtering of allowed web sites\n\n*turn off safari and provide single purpose apps that connect only to the sites you wish. \n\n\nThere are drawbacks and maintainability issues with either choice, but you do have control over iOS and web browsing. \nIf the native tools are not to your liking, there are also many mobile device management (MDM) solutions like JAMF, Mobile Iron or even Profile Manager from Lion Server.\n\nA: Kiosk Pro Lite and SureFox Kiosk Browser are a couple browser apps for iPad that you can choose. \nThese apps allow you to configure what website users are allowed to access.\nIt will run iOS secure browser in kiosk mode so that your employees can only access whitelisted or allowed websites.\n", "Q: Changing Airdrop Folder I have changed the location of many other applications to save files to a custom folder instead of ~/Downloads.\nIs there a way to change the default Airdrop location from the Downloads folder to something else?\n\nA: I work for a school district and just had to do this.  The teacher receives student iMovie files for review, and I need to move this automatically from the Downloads folder to something else.\n\n*\n\n*Create the folder you want files moved to.\n\n*I went into Automator (Applications folder) and created a new \"Folder Action.\"\n\n*At the top where it says \"Folder Action receives files and folders added to\" choose your Downloads folder.\n\n*In Library (far left) choose Files and Folders, then Filter Finder Items.  Drag this to the workflow area to the right.  In my case, I added two criteria.  Kind is movie, and File extension contains m4v.\n\n*Below \"Filter Finder Items\" drag Move Finder Items from the left side, and choose the new folder location.\n\nThat's it.  When someone airdrops a file that meets the criteria you set up, it should automatically move to the specified folder.  Hope this helps someone!\n\nA: Not easily, but you could enable Folder Actions on the Downloads folder before entering AirDrop and achieve the same effect on a more manual and case by case basis.\nIn practice it might be easier to change the other programs like Mail and Safari to not use the same default Downloads folder that AirDrop does have hard coded as the save point.\n\nA: I am using Mark Lilbacks's Automator action (see his answer from June 2016), and I can't recommend it highly enough. It's the perfect solution.\nhttps://github.com/mlilback/QuarantineAutomatorAction\nHave created a dedicated Airdrops folder with a custom icon, which always goes to the bottom of my Download stack (set to Fan mode) when a new arrival appears.\nJust DL the v0.1 Release, install the Action in Automator (with usual permissions - and caveats) and create a workflow. Works perfectly under High Sierra, though I can't comment on later OSs. Thanks Mark\n(Newly registered here so can't comment or upvote yet)\n\nA: I wanted to change the default folder, but there does not appear to be a builtin way to do it. Therefore, I wrote an automator action that can be used in a folder action on your downloads folder. For example, I have one set to move any airdropped files to my Desktop. There is a binary for download at my Github repository\n\nA: This is not a direct answer to your question (which has already been sufficiently addressed), but it could be a workaround for some people who need a quick fix.\nI noticed that immediately after receiving an AirDrop download, all of the newly received files are selected for you. This means you can simply right-click on them and choose New Folder with Selection. You will then have all the items you just received, neatly organized in one place.\n\nIt just requires a bit of patience, waiting for the items to be transferred, and not clicking on any other items in Finder during the process (so as not to risk deselecting the ones you want to group together).\nI know it's not the same as changing the default download location, but it's good to be aware of, just the same - especially since we don't always receive files on computers we have full permissions on. It's equally handy when transferring files to someone else too, if you instruct them to do this, or do it for them.\n", "Q: Sharing Internet with Mac and Buffalo WHR-HP-G54? I have enabled internet sharing with ethernet. I try to share the internet with \"automatic DHCP\" to my Buffalo. I can access the buffalo but I am unable to share the internet from mac to buffalo and from buffalo to other machines. How can I do that?\n\nA: Short answer: you're doing it wrong.\nThe Buffalo device you've got is a wifi router. Normally this kind of thing sits between your cable modem (or whatever you've got connected to the wall) and the rest of your home network, and redistributes your Internet connection to multiple devices in your home.\nIf you turn on \"internet sharing\" on your Mac, you're essentially turning your mac into a wifi router as well. There is no reason to do this. And you're probably creating a \"double-NATing\" situation as well, which is undesirable.  I'm not sure how you've got your network wired up physically, but that could be part of the problem too, I imagine.\nSo, in short, either get rid of the Buffalo entirely and rely on your Mac's internet sharing to do the same thing, or use the Buffalo to distribute your Internet connection and turn off Internet sharing on your Mac. I would do the latter. So your setup should look like this:\nWall socket -- Cable Modem -- Buffalo -- Computer\n                                      -- Another Computer\n                                      -- Yet Another Computer\n\nThis is the case both on a physical level and on a logical level—the Buffalo sits \"upstream\" of your computers in terms of networks traffic, whether it connects to them over an Ethernet cable or wifi.\n", "Q: Looking for a good SSH apps for iPhone I have been using a free SSH app on my phone for a little while but stopped because using VIM mostly broke it. Now after some updates I seems to have a limited number of key strokes before it expires. So now seems like a good time to shop around.\nThere are the requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can emulate color\n\n*Can run VIM, though being able to run EMACS would be cool too.\n\n*It does not have to be free.\n\n*it must run on a non jail broken phone.\n\n\nWhat is everyone else using? What do you suggest?\n\nA: I like iSSH. It's been around a long time and is a high quality emulator. It's usable on an iPhone screen and quite nice on an iPad screen. It even has a workaround for using the Control key on an external Bluetooth keyboard. I also tried Prompt right when it was released and found it not as solid, although it's had a lot of improvements since then.\n\nA: Being the fanboy that I am, I completely admit that I am absolutely in love with Prompt (by Panic). It's already come a long way since it's initial release, and here's a few wonderful features;\n\n\n*\n\n*It's not cluttered. They provided an app that offers what you need out of an SSH client and added a few bonuses that make it so much more worthwhile.\n\n*Command, and parameter, auto-completion. (Oh my god this is amazing.)\n\n*Public/Private key authentication support. Well documented, and also quite improved in recent versions with regard to how to load the actual key.\n\n*Leveraging the amount of free space in the meta key bar, you can assign 4 \"favorite special character keys\", so pick the ones you use most often so you rarely have to hit the 123 keyboard key, or worse, the #+= key. I currently have /\\.- chosen.\nPrompt is $8 (universal app!) on the iTunes App Store.\n\nA: Try Server Auditor. It's the best terminal for using Emacs from your iPhone. It allows to do C-x C-s without pain. It's also available on Google Play.\n\nA: I've been using Panic's Prompt.  It does color, SSH keys (including PEMs, if you've got a need to work with EC2), runs Vim and Emacs just fine, and most definitely works beautifully on a non-jailbroken phone.  The soft keyboard also provides convenient access to escape, tab, and other keys that you need frequently when you're working with a terminal.  Properly configured, Prompt also provides superb auto-complete that actually makes using a terminal on an iPhone palatable.  Alternatively, Prompt works great with a Bluetooth keyboard--a combination that has proved excellent when I'm on the road and something goes wrong with a server.\nPlus, Prompt is a universal app, so if you've got an iPad, you can use the bigger screen when you've got it, and still rely on the iPhone's size when you don't.\nMy only complaint is that Prompt can be a bit slow.  I'm not sure how much of that is Prompt's fault, and how much of that is my cell phone's network not being quite up-to-snuff.  But the slowness hasn't honestly \n\nA: Panic's Prompt is noticeably much slower than iSSH. If that doesn't bother you, it's a nice, simple SSH terminal app.\n\nA: Theres a new one called RapidSSH that is pretty good \n\n\n*\n\n*Supports SSH Agent and Agent Forwarding\n\n*Really easy and comprehensive key management\n\n*Supports multi-session and has good cut and paste slide out\n\n*Integrates with Dropbox so you can get big lumps of text into, and log files out of the app really easily.\n\n\nAlso has loads of other features which I dont really use, but as OP requested- it runs vIM, does ANSI colour, emacs is not that good, isn't free but very cheap and runs on non-jailbroken phones fine.\n\nA: try xCute - a new and existing SSH app for iPad / iPhone\nQuotation from xCute web page:\n\nSending commands to a server can be as simple as sending a text\n  message to a friend. \n   Remote SSH asynchronous execution.  \n\n   Results displayed back. \n\n   Persistent host details.   \n\n   User defined sets for keyword colouring output.   \n\n   Scripts for one touch execution.   \n\n   iCloud on demand synchronisation.   \n\n   Global or on a per user/server secure connections.\n\n\nThe application is available in English, Spanish and French\nExtremely easy to use, just type a command or chose from your own list of scripts, and hit send.\nChanging server is also extremely easy.\nI like the colouring output, one can distinguish easily between commands and output, and can selectively colour words in the output which help my presentations which I can email with all that formatting.\n\nA: My experience with iSSH is that it has quite a lot of ui bugs. Input disappearing behind the keyboard and such. Also the ui is not really ios standard.. It has got me searching for alternatives a few times. (Why I'm here)\nOther than that, good client. Also does VNC quite good.\n\nA: Why not try ssh term pro? It best in many case than above apps \n\nA: vSSH - advanced ssh and telnet client for iPhone and iPad. In addition to standard iOS ssh client functions (background work, port forwarding, key forwarding, unicode and pseudographics support, sessions logging) has the following unique features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Touch screen gestures (configurable, simulates arrow Pg Up/Down and other key combination)\n\n*Extended keyboard (configurable, F1-F20, Ctrl, Alt, Ins, Pg Up/Down and other keys)\n\n*Full-featured external (bluetooth) keyboard support (including modifier keys)\n\n*iCloud sync between all iOS devices as well as OS X app version\n\n*Macros support (you shell scripts as menu items for quick access)\n\n\nFree lite (with Ad) version is available.\n", "Q: Is there a standard format for HTML-emails? I have noticed that HTML-formatted graphical emails which I receive are the perfect width for the message pane in Lion's Mail app. \nIt almost looks as if Apple designed them (it didn't they are from random companies).\nIs this a coincidence, or is there a standard? Did Apple play a role in defining it? \n\nA: HTML emails from companies are usually made using an online HTML builder, such as xact target, Dot mailer, Mail Chimp and the like.\nThe templates use HTML to create the emails. In the HTML there is code which will render differently in Mail, and outlook, Hotmail, yahoo mail, etc. The suppliers of email software will spend significant amounts of time making sure teh same version is seen in the same way by all email recipients \nThe HTML code in a lot of HTML email also defines whether you are using a desktop app, web mail, or even mobile.\nThe reason your emails fit onto your browser is down to the flood of people using mobile email, on iPhones, iPads, Android devices, etc. The email is built in columns, usually no more that 2. These columns can then be narrow or wide depending on whether the recipient is using a mobile device or a desktop email client.\nNext time you get a HTML email have a look at it on your desktop email, and then compare it with how it looks on a mobile.\nThe hardest mobile to support is Blackberry, as most models do not support HTML, instead they often render a plain text version.\nSo to finish off and answer your question,\nThere is no design standard, and Apple did not have a say in it.\n\nA: With the right usage of HTML and CSS you can craft HTML emails in a way that they expand to fill whatever size window/message pane they're displayed in. Most websites do this to some degree (open a site and change the size of your browser window for an effective demonstration).\nSome further information from a blog that happened to be the first Google hit. No guarantee of it's quality, but it looks to be a decent first start if you want more details.\n\nA: HTML-formatted e-mail is actually a hairy subject that goes way beyond the scope of Apple-related stuff. Considering all the web-based mail clients and desktop mail clients, each of which has its own rendering quirks, creating HTML e-mail that looks more or less the same in all of them is a serious challenge. MS Outlook is an especially notorious offender in terms of wonky rendering.\nWith a relatively simple design, it's easy to craft an e-mail that will fill the client's window. When you start getting into multiple columns and such, it gets trickier.\nThere are no current industry standards for HTML e-mail (other than MIME encoding, that sort of thing); there are some generally understood best practices for producing HTML e-mail that will turn out OK in most clients, which have been worked out through trial and error.\n\nA: You mean, something like this?\nOS X has built-in stationary, that one can use to create HTML formatted emails.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to bypass a proxy when the proxy settings are set to Auto Proxy Config? I've set up Automatic Proxy Configuration (PAC) in OSX Snow Leopard to point to a URL. I've also filled out the \"Bypass proxy settings for these Hosts & Domains\" box because I want to skip the proxy for certain sites. (I'm using pow which as far as I understand, works by creating a local mini dns server.)\nIf I use Apple's Web Proxy/Secure Web Proxy, it'll use my settings for bypassing the proxy, but apparently not for PAC. Any way to make this work?\n\nA: Just ran into this as well and it doesn't seem to apply the \"bypass\" sites when using the auto proxy settings. I suppose that is the intended behavior, otherwise it wouldn't be very \"automatic\".\nI just entered the proxy settings  manually and it worked for me.\n", "Q: exporting numbers 09 to excel with photos in spreadsheet When I export my numbers spreadsheet with photos in the column the photos do not transfer when I import it into excel. How can I do this?\n\nA: There are two ways that an image can exist in Numbers.app, to my knowledge:\n\n\n*\n\n*Within a cell (in a table) - here, the cell has an \"Image Fill\";\n\n*\"On top of\" the table.\n\n\nExcel doesn't support option 1.\nIf you drag an image file into a Numbers spreadsheet, you'll get option 1: the image will be inserted within a cell.\nInstead, in Numbers, use the Insert > Choose… menu and select the image file.  You'll then get option 2, which is correctly exported to .xls format in my limited testing.\n\nA: I exported to PDF, and then use the \"Export to Excel\" function in the Adobe Acrobat app to convert the PDF back into Excel. It preserved the image fill nicely.\nNote that Adobe Acrobat is a paid app that's part of the Adobe Suite subscriptions.\n", "Q: How can I quickly change DNS server I often like to use a non-network specific DNS server (like Google's public DNS 8.8.8.8).  However, many public wi-fi locations won't load their \"terms of service, click here\" page during the authorization process.  I suppose it is because my Macbook needs to look-up their web page, but is sending DNS requests to Google, which are blocked because I'm not yet authorized.\nThe quick fix is to delete the DNS server from the Network preference pane (Network / Advanced / DNS / Select / delete / clickety / click /GAAA) ...\n... and then add it back after I'm authorized.\nSo, what I'm looking for is an easy way to specify my DNS server.  I'd love to run some service or app that would clear the DNS server list (ideally without needing me to select anything).  And then run it again to put my DNS server specifications back.\nCan this be accomplished with some Applescripting?  Or a terminal command (that I could then wrap with Automator)?\n\nA: Launchbar will allow you to select from your pre-defined locations - I have two that only differ by setting DNS.\n\nSo I have Control-Space as my hotkey so this sequence of keys to toggle OpenDNS instead of the DHCP supplied DNS:\n^+Space, L, O, C, Return, ▼, Return\n\nThe down arrow key will cycle between all your locations if you have more than two. As I put in my comments above - FastScripts lets you assign one shortcut key sequence to whatever script you like from the other answers - it runs in the context of the running app and is free if you need less than 10 shortcut keys defined in the app.\n\nA: Once you have setup different Network Loacations as per Adam Rice's solution, you can quickly switch between the locations using top menubar option \"Apple > Location\". \n\n\nA: To get the settings:\nnetworksetup -getdnsservers Airport\n\nTo change them:\nnetworksetup -setdnsservers Airport xx.xx.xx.xx\n\nThese settings are non-persistent, so you could clear your manual settings, let the public wi-fi DNS do its thing, then use the -setdnsservers to set it to what you want until next time.\n\nA: You can have multiple network configurations and switch between them on your Mac. Open the Network prefpane, and you'll see that there's a popup menu at the top (probably says \"default\" or something). Let's say you get this set up the way you like it for home use. Pull down that menu to Edit Location…, double-click on the name, and give it an obvious name like \"Home.\"\nThen create another location in that window (hit the + button) and name it Coffee Shop. Finish up in that window and select Coffee Shop from the menu to make it your current menu. Change the settings to be whatever you want.\nTo change the DNS settings you use in each of these cases, you'll need to click on the Advanced button at the bottom, then the DNS tab.\nOnce you've got these two locations set up, you can switch between them in the Network prefpane in the future; I think there are independent applications that make it easier to switch between them (or even do it automatically based on what networks they detect) but I've never played around with them.\n\nA: You can use DNS Switcher application.\n\n", "Q: Is the App or the iPhone causing the issue? So about a month ago I started using the Nike+ GPS app and everything was working fine until a few days ago while using it, my ipod starts skipping and the voice control automatically pops up. At first I thought the app had glitches but then even after i close the app, my ipod was still skipping and that voice control thing popped up. So should I restore? Is there a problem with my phone itself? Or is the app the one that caused this issue? \nThanks in advance for your input. \n\nA: I don't think it's the app that's causing the issue. And I believe there are two separate issues with separate causes. \nFirst, the skipping issue could be caused by a corrupt iPhone music DB - this is fixable by re-syncing the iPhone with iTunes. \nSecond, voice control could kick in automatically if you use some kind of accessory such as headphones. Try not using this accessory for a while and see whether the voice-control issue is sorted.\n", "Q: Sharing a Bluetooth Keyboard and Mouse sequentially between two Macs I work out of my house where I have two computers: a mid-2010 Macbook Pro (for my day job) and a mid-2010 iMac (personal). During the workday, my iMac acts as a second display for my Macbook Pro via Mini Displayport.\nCurrently, I use a USB keyboard and mouse for my work computer and a Bluetooth keyboard and Magic Mouse + Magic Trackpad for use with my personal computer. I'd like to get rid of the wired keyboard and mouse and just use the Bluetooth stuff for both machines (but never simultaneously). \nIs it possible to easily share the single set of input devices without having to repeatedly break and reestablish the pairing of the input device to the correct computer? I'm not opposed to buying some type of additional hardware to accomplish this, provided it's not prohibitively costly or cumbersome to use or configure.\nIt's not clear to me how I would tell the MacBook Pro to leave the devices alone so the iMac can have them for the evening. I want to avoid de-pairing and re-pairing the devices each time I want to shift them back or forth.\nBasically is there software or hardware that works as a Bluetooth KVM switch?\n\nA: As long as both computers are on the same network you may want to consider a software solution like teleport for the keyboard and mouse.\nYou'll still need some kind of switch for the display.\n\nA: I just purchased a Logitech K811 Bluetooth keyboard which has the ability to switch between devices.  Add a Logitech T630 Touch Mouse and you are set.\n\nA: I, too, was looking for an answer to this very question. Here is the solution that I came up with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences -> Bluetooth\n\n*Click 'Advanced'\n\n*Make sure that 'Allow Bluetooth devices to wake this computer' is\nunchecked\n\n*Click 'OK'\n\n\nNow, when I want to switch from my main computer to my MacBook Pro, I put the main computer to sleep and wake up the second one. The bluetooth keyboard and mouse both switch over to the laptop and away I go. When I want to return to the main computer, I put the laptop to sleep and wake the Mac Mini using its power button.\n\nA: I've wrestled with this issue myself - the solution that works for me is to use one of the non-Bluetooth wireless keyboards that has its own USB dongle.  That way, the wireless connection is between the Bluetooth dongle and the keyboard, which is pre-paired at the factory.  As far as the KVM is concerned, it is just a plain USB keyboard.\n\nA: http://www.share-mouse.com/\nFREEWARE and PAID versions\nor \nSynergy - https://github.com/symless/synergy-core#synergy-core\nFREE and PAID versions\nworks on Mac and PC and can share between them both.\nI've been using this solution so I can use my Apple Wireless Keyboard and Magic Mouse on my Mac and PC at the same time.  To switch you just drag your mouse to the edge of the screen and it shows up on the other computer as if it were one big desktop. \n\nA: I don't have a problem doing the above at all. \nI have 2 MBPs. One is the latest Retina and the other is a Mid 2011. I have the same Apple Bluetooth Keyboard and Magic Trackpad paired to both and use them both without ever removing the pairing. \nI simply turn Bluetooth off on the device I'm not using them on, so my solution assumes you have no other need for Bluetooth simultaneously. Both the keyboard and trackpad happily pair with multiple devices. It all works great and I don't need to power cycle the keyboard and Bluetooth . Simply toggling Bluetooth on the MBPs in a proper order works well. Turn off Bluetooth on the current computer you are using them with then turn on Bluetooth on the other. They will connect after a few seconds and you are ready to rock!\n\nA: The trouble is with the devices, the Apple mouse and the keyboard in your case. They don't pair with more than one BlueTooth host at a time. You need a BlueTooth host that's \"central\" to both Macs if you want to use them.\nYou can find KVM switches that have BlueTooth host receivers in them. For example, the Zonet KVM3322W (dead link) worked over USB and provided BlueTooth receiver capabilities. I cannot attest to how well that would work. Presumably you'd pair the keyboard and mouse with the BlueTooth receiver in the KVM instead of in either Mac and then using the keyboard shortcuts, switch between control of the Macs who are connected to the KVM via USB. How the Macs would respond to the BlueTooth receiver in the KVM coming and going as you switched between them is unclear to me. Could be they handle it just fine.\nThe other option is to seek out BlueTooth accessories that allow themselves to be paired with more than one host. And then switch between those hosts from hardware keys on them. For example, this keyboard+trackpad combo from IOGear supports switching between 6 BlueTooth hosts. So you'd pair it with both Macs and the use the keyboard switches to decide which one you were talking to at any point in time. That, to me, seems like the more reliable approach. Of course: now you're stuck using IOGear's keyboard instead of the Apple peripherals.\n\nA: My recommendation is to not switch.\nThe problem with any switching solution, hardware or software is there is a lag between 5 and 10 seconds.  So if your intending on switching back and forth quickly between platforms you may not be satisfied with the time requirement to switch back and forth.  \nI have a IO gear hardware switch for the past 3 years and it takes about 5 seconds each time to switch back and forth with the mouse and keyboard.  So I have a wired keyboard for when I need to switch back and forth quickly for pits and pieces of what I'm working on.  \n\nA: There's VirtualKVM software solution by Duane Fields, which perfectly suites your needs. There're two main problems with Target Display Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*you've to manually press Cmd+F2 each time\n\n*you should don't forget to disable Bluetooth just before, otherwise keyboard and mouse will not be paired with the MacBook\n\n\nVirtualKVM solves this problems. Here's your steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the app to the both iMac and MacBook, install and run it.\n\n*Simply connect the MacBook to the iMac with a Thunderbolt cable.\n\n\n*\n\n*The app presses Cmd+F2 for you.\n\n*It disables Bluetooth on the iMac and enables on the MacBook.\n\n\n*Now you can pair keyboard and mouse with the MacBook, if you didn't do it before. If you did, they're connected automatically.\n\n\nSo that's it. Now you can use the iMac as a display with keyboard and mouse connected to the MacBook. When you've done, just disconnect the cable and the app will return everything as it was (disable/enable Bluetooth, press Cmd+F2). Please note, that the app will disable Bluetooth on the MacBook, otherwise keyboard and mouse can't be connected back to the iMac. If you need Bluetooth enabled on the both devices, you've to switch it on manually.\nConfiguration of the app is quite simple, you can see everything on the pictures below. Host Mode is for an iMac, Client Mode is for a MacBook. The app chooses the mode automatically.\n \nI personally use this software everyday and it saves me a lot of time and nerves. With this app I don't have to do a routine work and it makes me happy. I wish you the same.\n\nA: I'm able to do a quick switchover by momentarily connecting the mouse (or keyboard) to the new computer via a lightning cable.  Just connect the device like you're going to charge it, disconnect the cable, and the device connects to the computer.\n\nA: You can use the GKMB01 Bluetooth Desktop Dock from IOGEAR to do this job if you are not physically moving the keyboard away from the area.  The GKMB01 connects between one computer and your USB keyboard/mouse, then switches the keyboard and mouse function between the hard wired computer and two additional Bluetooth devices such as your iMac with a quick double tap of the OPT key.\nhttp://www.iogear.com/product/GKMB01/\nDisclaimer: I am posting on behalf of IOGEAR since they do have a direct solution available.\n\nA: I have built a little open source project which allows to connect you wired and wireless HID keyboards and mice to Raspberry Pi Zero W (~$10/£10) which then presents itself as a bluetooth keyboard+mouse device to you machines and channels input to an active host. you can switch an active host with a key combination. supports key remapping. Python implementation, easy to customise.\nBluetooth HID Hub (https://github.com/ruundii/bthidhub).\n\nA: I have the same issue, using a new MacBook with an old (mid 2010) iMac as a screen, mirrored.\nI couldn't get VirtualKVM to work. Followed the instructions above, installed fine, used up to date version, but when I plugged in the thunderbolt cable and it mirrored automatically, the iMac never gave up the keyboard and mouse Bluetooth connection.\nYou can't turn Bluetooth off on the iMac, because it wants the keyboard and mouse connected to maintain control, but you can delete the keyboard and mouse from the list of Bluetooth devices. Just remember to delete the keyboard first so you still have mouse control to delete the mouse.\nNot the most sophisticated solution, but it works.\nThen connect thunderbolt, then pair the mouse and keyboard on the MacBook, this worked fine for me.\n", "Q: How do I assign a Razer DeathAdder Black Edition key to Mission Control? I have purchased a Razer DeathAdder Black Edition mouse, and the latest Mac driver I can find for it is 1.00.  The possible assignments for the side buttons don't seem to have Mission Control buttons available for them (they only have various Expose keys available)\nIs there a hack around this?  Or do I just have to do without?  Or exchange for a different Razer mouse with a more developed Mac driver?  Or just use the Mac driver for a different Razer mouse?\n\nA: I've got my Razer Naga configured to work with Mission Control.\nI've used the Razer drivers to set up the button I want to use to trigger Mission Control to trigger Mouse Button 3 (you can bind any button to this):\n\nThen, I've set up System Preferences to use Mouse Button 3 to trigger Mission Control:\n\nThat's been working fine for me; no extra software required.\n\nA: Download Synapse 2.0 on the Razer website. \nThen go on the Mouse Customization, choose the button to customize, in the button assignment select \"Launch application\" and select Mission Control.\nVoilà!\n\nA: I'm not familiar with the particulars of your mouse and the associated drives, it probably hasn't been updated for Lion yet, so I wouldn't expect any Mission Control options built in at the moment. The simplest way would be to see if you can have the button assigned to a particular keypress, which you can then assign to Mission Control in the Keyboard Prefs.\nIf that doesn't work, try Steermouse, it's a 3rd party mouse driver that works with almost every extra mouse you'll find, and gives you some additional features and flexibility.\n", "Q: Multiple Macs and the OS X Lion Hardware Up-to-Date Program? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhich new Mac purchasers get free upgrades to 10.7? \n\nI'm due for a free update to Mac OS X Lion, as I bought an iMac in July after the cut-off date for free updates.\nWhen I go to claim the free update on the apple web site, it asks me to enter the serial numbers of all \"qualifying macs\". If I just enter the number of the Mac that I bought most recently, will I be able to install Lion on the other ones manually? I assume so, but I don't want to accidentally short myself $30 :)\n\nA: The download of Lion, like any other App on the Mac App Store is subject to the same licensing counts as any other app. You are able to have 5 simultaneous copies of the App just like you can authorize 5 machines to hold your iTunes purchased content.\n", "Q: How to migrate data to new iMac with SSD + HD? I just got a new iMac with 256G SSD + 2T regular HD.\nThe data on my old computer is bigger than 256G\nNot only that, but the Migration Assistant seems to want to migrate-to the SSD only.\nAdvice?\nEDIT\nI wasn't clear -- I know which data I want on which device, I was trying to cajole MigrationAssistant into splitting it up for me.\nIt turns out that the problem was my misunderstanding of \"migration.\"  I thought it was \"migrate your system from old machine to new\", but it's really \"migrate your user-prefs & settings (mail, printers, etc.) to a new system\", with an implied \"all that data stuff is yours to deal with.\"\nMigrationAssistant will move \"other files\" if you want, but I guess I wasn't getting that this was sort of an \"oh, by the way\" thing, and not its main function.\n\nA: First, I'd suggest making a plan for deciding what data is going where. A simple starting point is put all your media (particularly videos) on the hard drive, since it often accounts for the bulk of the data and benefits less from the speed of the SSD.\nSecondly, you can customize what data Migration assistant brings over. Have it transfer your apps and settings, and maybe the basics from your home directory, then once you've got your system up and running you can transfer the rest either by running Migration Assistant again, or manually via Target Disk mode.\nAnother option, if you have a bunch of data (enough to get you under the 256GB barrier) that you know you're going to be putting on the HD, is to transfer it manually first (or to a backup drive), then delete it and run Migration Assistant without any exclusions.\n\nA: The Mac Transfer Assist transfers the files from the old Mac to the new Mac, choosing the location where the OS is installed. If OS on new Mac is installed on the SSD, you may have a problem if the files are too large.\nSolution:\n\n\n*\n\n*backup everything\n\n*restart new Mac holding down the Alt key. Choose the \"Recovery HD\" disk\n\n*choose \"Reinstall OS X\", and make sure it is installed on your normal HD drive\n\n*Once completed, use Transfer Assist on both computers following the instructions. Your files will now be moved to the normal HD on your new computer.\n\n*When completed, repeat steps 2-3, only this time you install the OS on your SSD drive. An advantage because OS will then run faster.\n\n", "Q: How do I add a wireless printer? This seems pretty easy in Windows 7, but I am unsure of how I can do this on Mac OS X. I have a Wireless printer connected to my router via Wireless, and now I want to use it with my Mac. How can I connect to the wireless printer with my Mac? I am using OS X Lion and am on a MacBook Pro.\n\nA: If the wireless printer has joined the network, OS X should see it listed as a nearby printer. From the Print & Scan pane in System Preferences, click the Plus (+) button in the lower left, and it should show up in the popup menu. \n\nIf it doesn't, select \"Add Other Printer or Scanner…\" In the resulting window, the \"Default\" Tab will show all local Bonjour printers, as well as any connected directly via USB.

Questions\nIs it OK to downgrade 10.7.1 Client to 10.7 using the original version 1.0.4 of Install Mac OS X Lion.app?\nEither type of downgrade to be followed by updates. These questions focus on: \n\n\n*\n\n*the period during which a downgraded system runs.\n\n\n(Installation to a clean volume, without downgrade may be preferable, but that's a separate discussion.)\nKey points\nVersion 1.0.4 of the installer recognises that something more recent than 10.7 (Build 11A511) is running, but: \n\n\n*\n\n*does not caution the user against downgrade \n\n*does not create /Previous System\n\n*reuses /System\nBackground\nInstall Mac OS X Lion.app 1.0.4 for Mac OS X 10.7 (Build 11A511) appeared in the Mac App Store on 20th July 2011. Following advice from Apple, some users set aside a copy of version 1.0.4. \nOS X Lion Update 10.7.1 (Client) and OS X Lion Update 10.7.1 (Server) were posted on 16th August 2011. \nInstall Mac OS X Lion.app 1.0.8 for Mac OS X (Build 11B26) appeared in the Store on 23rd August. If a copy of 1.0.4 is found, the Store routine may update that copy to 1.0.8. \nHowever: \n\n\n*\n\n*between 16th and 23rd August, 1.0.8 was not an option\n\n*some users may be unaware of 1.0.8 \n\n*some users are aware of 1.0.8 but prefer to retain and reuse 1.0.4 (to install 10.7 instead of 10.7.1, then update).\n\n\nA: Downgrade 10.7.1 (Client) to 10.7\nDowngrade is possible, apparently without restriction, but not necessarily OK. \nMy own case\nAfter using 10.7.1 for a few days, a series of events led me to erase my startup volume then use Recovery OS Time Machine to restore from backup. These events left me without the Recovery HD that is required for FileVault 2. \nAt that time, version 1.0.8 of the installer was not available. \nTo regain a Recovery OS: \n\n\n*\n\n*avoiding my usual account, I used a different account to log in to 10.7.1 (intention: data integrity — avoid my usual home directory at all stages during a downgrade)\n\n*I ran version 1.0.4 of the installer on 10.7.1 to install (downgrade to) 10.7\n\n*avoiding my usual account, I used a different account to log in to 10.7\n\n*I observed an issue affecting a peripheral display — at least one thing not OK\n\n*I didn't investigate that issue, didn't seek other issues (intention: spend as little time as possible in a downgraded environment)\n\n*I ran Software Update, got 10.7.1 and other updates.\nMore generally\nData relating to the greatest version of an executable may be incompatible with, or lose integrity with, a lesser version. \nIncompatibility or loss of integrity may be acceptable for some types of file (examples: cache files, preference files). For other types (example: application support) integrity may be critical. \nFor the System version/build over which you wish to reinstall, if Apple provides a matching full installer: \n\n\n*\n\n*avoid downgrade — prefer to install a matching system. \n\n\nApplication-specific formats that are designed for export and import\nTo minimise the risks associated with downgrades, I guess that: \n\n\n*\n\n*an archive produced by Address Book in 10.7.1 should be usable without issue in 10.7 \n\n*an archive produced by iCal in 10.7.1 should be usable without issue in 10.7\n\n\n– and so on. \n\nA: A sure-proof way to ensure nothing wrong happens would to be first do a downgrade to Snow Leopard, if you still have the install/recovery disk (and you don't, borrow or buy one), and then reinstalling Lion using the backed-up install lion.app.\n", "Q: Is there an alternative App to Mail on iPad?

At a more simpler level, you could use rsync on-demand to sync directories or files.\n\nA: Really depends a lot on what data you need synced. Some things are really easy (file-based documents), some are harder (iLife libraries).\nAs the others have mentioned, Dropbox is a good starting point. It's great for keeping your files synced (and it's a good emergency backup, as you can get to it anywhere via the web site), so long as they're just plain files, not dependent on an app's database (i.e. don't try putting your iTunes library on Dropbox). It's also best for smaller files, since you do have to pay for added storage, not to mention the bandwidth/speed limitations of syncing everything to the cloud. It is intelligent enough to do a direct LAN sync between the two computers however.\nFor syncing larger files (say a video collection), rsync should work well for local sync.\nFor iTunes, rsync works fairly well at keeping the libraries backed up, but it works best if you keep one computer as the \"master\" library which handles adding all new music, syncing iDevices, etc. and the other just acts a copy. Check out this question for more details. I haven't tried, but I suspect something similar would work with iPhoto libraries.\nFor syncing preferences, it depends a lot on which apps. Some have built-in Dropbox compatibility, or at least details on their site of how to get them working with Dropbox. Others use MobileMe (and should be able to make use of iCloud once it comes out in a month or two). For a lot of programs, as long as you don't have them active on both machines at the same time, you should be able to get away with aliasing the preference files to a Dropbox folder.\nFor email, if you're not already, make use of Gmail. Even if you don't like the web-client, use it's IMAP capability with Mail or other apps to keep your mail synced easily between the devices.\nFor contacts and calendars, you can use CalDAV sync between iCal and Google Calendar, and you can get Address Book syncing with Gmail contacts, but it can get messy. Once iCloud comes out, this should be much simpler.\nHope that helps and gives you some ideas.\n", "Q: How to capture a screen shot of all spaces Regularly I use more than 4 spaces in my Macbook Pro ( lion/10.7.1 ).\nCan I get a screenshot of all spaces at one time ?\n\nA: screencapture ~/Desktop/1.png\nosascript -e 'tell app \"System Events\" to key code 124 using control down' # ctrl-right\nsleep 0.5\nscreencapture ~/Desktop/2.png\nosascript -e 'tell app \"System Events\" to key code 123 using control down' # ctrl-left\n# montage ~/Desktop/1.png ~/Desktop/2.png -tile 2x1 -geometry +2+2 ~/Desktop/`date '+%y%m%d%H%M%S'`.png\n\nmontage comes with ImageMagick.\n\nA: If you can get all Desktops to completely show on one screen, then yes.

Opposite to another question here I want the badge count to appear.\nI have the \"resume\" function enabled in my Lion. Is there another setting that's responsible for the badge?\nTo clarify I run tail -f /path/to/file in 2 tabs of my terminal and I expect the badge to inform me about the changes.\n\nA: The Terminal dock icon badge indicates the number of bells (Control-G, ASCII BEL) written to terminals in the background. It indicates the number of \"unread\" bells:\n\nIf the tab bar is visible, you'll see a corresponding \"bell\" icon in the tab of each terminal with \"unread\" bells:\n\nWhen you activate one of these terminals, the bell indicator is removed from the tab and the total count displayed in the dock icon badge will decrease. The badge is removed when the count reaches zero. (The tab bar needn't be visible for this behavior. It's only necessary if you want to see the bell indicator to see which terminals have \"unread\" bells.)\nThere is also an \"unread text\" indicator displayed in tabs, in the form of ellipsis (\"…\"):\n\nThis is displayed when anything is written to a background terminal, and, like the bell indicator, cleared when you activate that terminal window/tab. An \"unread text\" ellipsis is also displayed on minimized terminal windows in the Dock:\n\nEither of these may suffice for your case, depending on your specific needs.\nAs you've surmised, the badge (and the indicators in the tab) are meant to give you a means to monitor what's going on in background terminals without having to activate them to look at the terminal contents, and bells have a high visual priority in the UI so users can use the bell indicators to notice important events.\nYou can make use of the bell indicator by arranging to write ASCII BEL (Control-G) characters to the terminal when something of interest to you occurs. You could use tee to direct the tail output to both the terminal and some other program or shell command so you can see the contents as well. You may also be able to use the screen or expect commands, which can watch for specific content to trigger an action.\nThis simple example will beep every time a new line is written to system.log:\ntail -F /var/log/system.log | tee >(while read; do printf '\\a'; done)\n\nOf course, that can beep a lot, including for the lines initially displayed by tail (by default, ten). This version skips the initial lines and also avoids beeping more often than once every three seconds:\n# Notify the user when there's activity on stdin.\nfunction activity_notification\n{\n    # Skip the first ten lines (the default for tail)\n    for ((skip = 0; skip < 10; ++skip)) do read; done;\n\n    # Beep when there are new lines.\n    while read; do\n        printf '\\a';\n\n        # Throttle: Ignore activity for the next three seconds. If the\n        # data contains a BEL (Control-G), stop waiting.\n        read -d $'\\a' -t 3;\n    done\n}\n\ntail -F /var/log/system.log | tee >(activity_notification)\n\nAfter reading a line and emitting a BEL, it tells read to read all input until either the specified character is read or three seconds elapse. You could set the delimiter to ASCII NUL (read -d '' with an empty string will cause it to use NUL), which is unlikely (impossible?) to show up in the system log file, but I chose to use BEL as the delimiter so that if the file contains BELs they'll produce a beep, too.\n\nA: If using the Terminal itself is not a mandatory thing I'd suggest to use iTerm2.\nThere is an option to enable Growl Notifications when new output from other Tabs/Windows are received:\nAlso I'm not here to sell iTerm2 but it's just so much more customizable then Terminal is.\n\n", "Q: Why isn't iTunes shuffle random? This is a problem that has bugged me for the last 5 years, across multiple devices, operating systems and installs of iTunes and iPods.\nI have found that the iTunes shuffle feature does not randomly shuffle songs. In fact, I can accurately predict the exact sequence of songs that iTunes will play. This frustrates me to no end because I like to listen to my music randomly, but I have a few favourite songs that I always start out with.\nFor example, if I select the song 'Somebody That I Used To Know' by Gotye, it will always follow with this exact sequence of songs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Blame It On The Tetons by Modest Mouse\n\n*Girl You Have No Faith In Medicine by The White Stripes\n\n*Mombassa by Hans Zimmer, from the Inception Soundtrack\n\n*Break of Dawn by Michael Jackson\n\n*Missing Words by Mark Ronson and the Business International\n\n\nThe method I use to start the songs does not matter. I have tried selecting the song in iTunes, searching for it and playing it with Coversutra, or searching for it from within iTunes, playing the song and then clearing the search. All three methods will play the exact same sequence of songs.\nI thought this might be due to the same seed being used, but I get the same sequence after restarting iTunes or even my computer. The sequence is the same across different days as well. Waiting for the song to finish or hitting next does not change anything either.\nI have had this problem (but with different sequences) for as long as I can remember on my Windows PC, MacBook and my iMac. All different versions of iTunes and operating systems, spanning 5 years.\nWhy does iTunes fail so hard and something that is so easy? Is there any way I can fix this?\n\nA: I remember reading somewhere that apple originally used true randomness in shuffle but people complained that the same song would play two or three times in a row (which you would expect as an almost certainty considering the number of users). They quickly changed it and Steve Jobs spun it (rather well) into \"iPods are now less random in order to seem random\" when he released the feature.\nSo shuffle was changed to randomising the track list every time you selected it rather than randomising the next song - to remove the risk of double, triple, quadruple etc. plays.\nI just feel sorry for the guy who copped the same song 5 times in a row despite having 1000s of songs in his iPod. Surely there was at least one...\n\nA: @Bombe and @IanC - there are reversible pseudorandom number generators, so you do only need one number, not the whole sequence. Think about it, the time taken to generate the sequence does not depend on the size of your music collection. Encryption algorithms offer one approach, since any encryption algorithm that does not change the length of the input (eg the Enigma Machine, Caesar Ciphers) will give you random-ish values that you can treat as a number, and you can decrypt any string to reverse through the sequence.\nHowever, it's far simpler just to use a simple linear congruential generator, of the form:\n\n\n\nIf the constants are chosen such that every value less than m will be generated, it turns out there are a different set of constants a', c' that reverse the sequence. You (or Apple) only need to calculate the second set of constants once. One pair of generators that are inverses of each other are:\n\n\n\nSee here for the derivation. You then pick a starting value using your system clock, and hey presto - a reversible random sequence.\nAll that's then needed is a way to map numbers in the range [0, 232-1] to songs in your collection, which is pretty simple.\nIf shuffle really works by playing the songs in the same order every time though, (as the questioner describes) then Apple are not maintaining a random number independent of the current song - since multiple numbers in the range 0..232-1 would map to the same song with different subsequent songs. Instead, they must be using the song's position in your collection as xn, and then mapping from xn+1 back to a song position. This would mean you'd get exactly the effect described in the question. The only variation would be the starting point, which would be a mapping from the clock to xn, then calculating xn+1 and mapping that back to a song position.\n\nA: Of course it is not truly random. Many years ago Steve Jobs was doing the Keynote for one of the major iPod product announcements. He stated that the truly random shuffle could line up the same song two or more times in a row. So they reworked the shuffle to make it less random. For one thing it tracked the songs so that a single song would not be played more than once in a shuffled play list. So it is a feature not a bug. Introduced by none other than Jobs himself. \n\nA: The Summary Version\nIt is random, but the order is only shuffled once, when you turn random play on. If you want to re-shuffle the order, turn random play off and then on again.\nThe Detailed Version\nI don't think this is a bug, it's a feature. Though I can understand how it might seem broken.\niTunes doesn't shuffle the order of the tracks every time you hit play (or any other control button). Another way of saying this is: it uses the same seed for your playlist every time until you tell it to use another seed.\nThis may seem contrary to the idea of shuffle but it actually serves a purpose: it lets the skip back and skip forward buttons work in a manner that makes sense. I can move back 5 songs while it's on shuffle to hear the song I heard 5 songs ago, and then iTunes plays through all the songs I just heard to get me back to the spot I was at before going back 5 songs.\nI do believe the ordering is truly random the first time it's generated. The problem is it's never obvious how to re-generate the ordering after that so your brain, which is really good at recognizing patterns as that's a handy survival skill when you're hunting and gathering, starts to learn the order over time. It starts to find patterns.\nYou can see this is the case with this little experiment. Set iTunes to shuffle your entire library. Pick a track. Play 5 tracks and write them down. Now pick any other track and let iTunes play one or two songs after that. Now go back to your first track and play from there again. It'll play that track and the same five after it that you wrote down. Changing tracks didn't reseed the random number generator.\nThe traversal through your tracks is truly random, but that random order isn't refreshed often enough so it starts to feel non-random.\nSo how do you get iTunes to generate a new shuffle order?\nYou uncheck and recheck the shuffle button. Doing this causes iTunes to recreate the random traversal path through your playlist (or entire library). It re-seeds the random number generator.\nYou can convince yourself this is true with a little experiment. Take an album that has track numbers in the meta data and select tracks 1 through 5 then select File -> New Playlist from Selection... from the menu. You'll now have a playlist with 5 songs in it.\nSelect that playlist and make sure that the shuffle button is unlit and that the track numbers are showing in the window. iTunes will show you the tracks in order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\nNow hit the shuffle button.\niTunes will show you the tracks out of order. I get: 4, 2, 1, 3, 5.\nNow hit the shuffle button to turn it off. And turn it on again.\nI now get: 5, 2, 3, 4, 1.\nRepeat as many times and needed to convince yourself that iTunes is actually regenerating a random traversal sequence through the tracks in your playlist.\nIt's the same thing for traversing your entire library: if you never uncheck and recheck the shuffle button the order never gets regenerated so things will start to seem non-random. After I unchecked and rechecked shuffle and began playing my entire library from my original starting track from my second paragraph above I got 5 different songs after it this time. So the order was changed, it's just less obvious when you're looking at your entire library instead of a playlist.\nThere's a caveat to all of this: iTunes DJ (aka Party Shuffle) works differently. With Party Shuffle you can influence the selection so that there's weighting given to more popular songs in your library. This obviously isn't random playback. So if you want truly random playback you want to shuffle your entire library from the Music view in the sidebar, not the iTunes DJ view. And you want to uncheck and re-check that shuffle button before each listening session to keep it truly unpredictable.\n\nA: Another reason why iTunes does only generate the randomness once is that this way it can ensure that you get every track played once with no duplicates.\nIf you have 1000 tracks in shuffle mode, after 1000 plays you will have listened to all of them. That would never work if it would randomly choose a track every time you hit play or the previous track ended, you would get duplicates at some point.\n\nA: If you notice, when you enter a playlist for the first time and select the shuffle icon, it instantly shuffles your playlist, then plays through in that order sequentially.\nIf you manually sort the playlist differently, for example by artist, then select the shuffle icon, your playlist won't shift visually, and if you start listening to a particular song it will jump to random next track when the song is ended, rather than sequentially going through your playlist.\nIf you close iTunes, or listen to a different playlist for a while, then come back to the original one, and select the very same first song, the next song it plays will be different than the last time (unless for some reason the random selection is the same, but this will happen with decreasing frequency as your playlists get larger).\n\nA: CNet did a study a while back that proved that iTunes Shuffle plays songs by specific studios, studios who had partnerships with Apple, more often.\nSo if you're wondering why you hear ###### pop songs more often when you use shuffle in iTunes, now you know why.\n", "Q: How can I fix my Mac-Router-Mac network?

I have a Macbook Pro 2010 (Core2Duo), and I lost my original software and OS restore DVD. The one that came with the laptop. Now my HD volume is corrupted (many programs quit randomly now -- like iTunes, XCode, etc). What can I do? Can I just go buy an OS X Lion DVD, reformat my HD, and do a clean install? Or do I somehow have to get the original DVD that came with the Macbook Pro and start from there? Please help. Thank you.\n\nA: There is no Lion DVD on sale, however, Apple sells Lion USB Key, that you can use to reinstall Lion on a new hard drive.\nWhat you won't have, though, is iPhoto, iWeb, iDVD (I probably forgot some) that come when you buy a Mac.\nBut if you bought them on the Mac App Store, you'll be able to reinstall them at no charge.\n\nA: If you have an Apple store nearby, they can provide you with replacements for your restore DVDs, usually for free. They may even be able to give you some suggestions on fixing your restore. It sounds like the drive is still working, so I would make a backup, do a fresh install and manually transfer the data you need, just to be on the safe side.\nYou can of course get the Lion USB installer, but if you can get replacement Snow Leopard DVDs for free, you'll save yourself $40 by installing Snow Leopard, then getting Leopard from the Mac App Store (Lion download is $29, Lion USB is $69).\n\nA: One option is to go to an Apple store where they can provide you with a replacement for your restore DVD.\nIf this is not an option, then you can use an OS X Lion install media on your Mac.

Is there a way to actually speed that animation up?\n\nA: Not sure why you're using ctrl-shift to do this. This exits Mission Control, but selects the desktop you clicked on. The reason the animation is so slow is that you're held shift (which slows down many OS X animations).

The same account gets receipts fine when I make purchases in the iTunes Store. \nIs there a way to either:\n\n\n*\n\n*View old receipts somewhere, or\n\n*Get receipts emailed again?\n\n\nThe reason I need the receipt itself is so I can turn in an expense report. In the case of Divvy, it's not that expensive, but if I can't get receipts, I'm certainly not going to make further purchases. \n\nA: While going off of the recommendation from @Mark to contact Apple Support I found a way to (kind of) get a receipt by following the directions on this page which shows you how to get order numbers. \nBasically, in iTunes, you click on your username/email-address and then log in. This will bring up your Account Information window where you can select the \"See All\" under the \"Purchase History\" section. This will take you to a list of transactions. \nUnfortunately, you can't print these out directly, but you can take a screen grab of the receipt (Cmd+Shift+3 or Cmd+Shift+4) and then print the resulting graphic. \nA little bit of a hack, but it gets you there. \n\nA: If your purchase is within the last 90 days, you can view it online as follows:\nIf you go to https://reportaproblem.apple.com and you are logged in with your Apple ID, you can view recent purchases, and print out the receipts, or email them to an address.\nIf your purchase is older however, I have found a way where you can request that a receipt for a purchase be emailed to you once again, but you cannot do it in your browser, it requires either an iOS device or a Mac with iTunes:\nFor iOS Devices (instructions as of iOS 11.4):\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings.app\n\n*Tap on your name where it says \"Apple ID, iCloud, iTunes & App Store\" (it's the first item in the list)\n\n*Tap on \"iTunes & App Store\" (it should show the email address of your App Store / iTunes account underneath)\n\n*Tap on the first item at the top that looks like this: \"Apple ID: your_email@your_domain.com\"\n\n*Choose \"View Apple ID\" from the list and authenticate if necessary.\n\n*Scroll down and tap on \"Purchase History\"\n\n*Choose your time range as necessary by tapping on \"Last 90 Days\".\n\n*Find the purchase you need the receipt for, and then tap on the row that says \"Total Billed: $XX.XX\" and has the rightward pointing chevron/arrow. This will take you to the Order/Receipt.\n\n*Scroll right to the bottom, and you will see a \"Resent\" button. Tap it, and a new copy of the receipt will be sent to the email address of your Apple ID.\n\nFor macOS:\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes\n\n*Sign in with your Apple ID if you aren't already (under the Account menu).\n\n*From the Account menu in the menu bar choose \"View My Account...\"\n\n*Under Purchase History, click on \"See All\".\n\n*Choose the desired date range at the top left.\n\n*Find the order that you need the receipt for and click on the number next to \"ORDER ID\" in the top right of the block for the order. This will expand the block to show more details of the order.\n\n*In the bottom left of the expanded block (underneath your billing address) you will see a small link entitled \"Resend\". Click it and a copy of the receipt will be resent to the email address of your Apple ID.\n\nNote: You can only resend receipts for purchases that actually have value and were billed to a payment method.\nBased on instructions found in the following Apple Support Document: https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht204088\n\nA: I had this issue for something I bought and needed a receipt, but Apple did not send an email which it used to do (for the apps that I did not need to claim on expenses).\nTo get a receipt, I contacted Apple support via their web form. Note that that might be the UK form only.\nTo get there got to apple.com, choose support on the top bar; then choose \"Mac App Store\" and \"Contact Support >> Account and Billing.\"\n\nA: These days you can view all your purchase receipts through iTunes (even if you bought the item through the App Store and not iTunes) - just go to \"View my account\", and then \"Purchase History\". Important to go through \"View my account\", there is also a \"Purchases\" menu item under \"Account\" but it is not the same. \n\nA: You should always be able to see your up to date purchase history from the App Store menu. \nStore -> View my account...\nSign in and look over your purchase history. I'm not aware of a way to get an email summary or duplicate receipts mailed again. \n", "Q: What tools and concepts are good for someone thinking about using HFS filesystem compression? I have a client with about 60TB of data on multiple HFS+ volumes, attached directly via fibre channel and shared using AFP. We are running around 85% capacity at present, and the budget to expand storage won't come into play for months. Our data growth suggests we'll hit 90% capacity in four months. I'm considering some sort of in-place filesystem compression that would transparently compress files at rest in storage, while not changing the workflows of the desktop users. (That is, they should just work as usual without having to decompress files.)\nI understand HFS+ filesystem compression can be accomplished by using the ditto command; I've also successfully used the free afsctool to compress files. The latter has not been updated for quite some time and I'm unsure of the developer's commitment. I'm not a programmer, so the source code means little to me.\nAre there any alternative commercial tools that will silently, automatically perform filesystem compression in the manner I seek? Preferably, there would be reliable enterprise support for the tool (say, telephone support). Or, would I be better off scripting compression periodically using ditto? Is HFS+ compression even the right path?\n\nA: First you should figure out whether or not compression is worth it. This depends largely on the type of content you're storing. If the content is not compressible (JPEG images, most video formats, ZIP archives, etc.), there's little benefit and the added overhead of decompression may even cause a (minor) slowdown in file access.\nHFS+ compression is most likely the wrong tool, for several reasons. First, compression isn't transparent, only decompression is. That is, if a file is stored compressed, it will be transparently decompressed when being read, but a newly created file will not be compressed by default.\nWorse, when you overwrite or append to a compressed file, it will once again be stored without HFS+ compression. Therefore, if you wanted to use HFS+ compression with user data, you would need to copy the entire volume first (using ditto or afsctool), file by file. On 60 TB this might take rather a long time. Furthermore you would regularly have to run a process that determines which files were added/modified recently (or aren't compressed) and (re)compresses those.\nAs the ditto man page states, HFS+ compression \"is only intended to be used in installation and backup scenarios that involve system files\". It's great for your /Applications folder, but not very suitable for your filer. Only if you're really desperate for capacity and have a lot of files that never get written to I would even consider it. Key being desperate :)\nI'm not aware of any transparent file system level compression packages for OS X. ZFS supports transparent file system compression, but switching your filers OS and FS may not be an option (since sadly there's no complete ZFS implementation for Mac OS X).\n\nA: There is a new HFS+ compression tool called MoreSpace Folder Compression in Appstore:\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/app/morespace-folder-compression/id521635253?mt=12\n", "Q: OS X Lion Server app reinstallation on 2011 Mac Mini Server I have had purchased for me by my employer a new Mac Mini Server. It came pre-installed with Lion Server (the Server app from the App Store that costs $49.99).\nUpon opening the App Store, other preinstalled software (iPhoto, iMovie, Garage Band) was instantly added to my Purchased tab, giving me the licenses to these applications on my Apple ID. However the Server app still shows up as a $49.99 purchase rather than saying \"Installed\" and is it not listed under my Purchased tab.\nIf I were to reinstall the operating system, how will I install the Server app without paying the $50 to get it from the App Store again?\n\nA: When you boot into the recovery partition or use internet recovery - Lion will be granted as a download according to the serial number of the mac. My suspicion is server will be handled in the same manner as the OS, not as he iLife apps are granted to an Apple ID.\nYou will have to pay for Lion Server if you want it associated with a specific Apple ID (just like Lion) - but shouldn't have an issue when downloading to that mac.\nYou can test this by booting to recovery (in any of the manners) and re-installing Lion and Server to a new USB external drive.\n\nA: At least with Mountain Lion, Internet Recovery will install the regular version of the OS.\nAfter it is installed, open the Mac App Store app, and it will let you download and install the OS X Server app after logging in to a specific iTunes account.\nAs far as I know, this will therefore link the purchase of OS X Server to that iTunes account. I works in the same way a redeem process works.\n", "Q: How do I get notified when the Dropbox app is updated? I realized that I was running a very old version of Dropbox for Mac.

How? Why: \n\n\n*\n\n*I want to encrypt my files (even the filenames) before backing \nthem up without using half my disk space just for encrypted files. \n\n*I use an external backup service that'll backup 1G disk images\n(files), but not 50G files. The smaller the individual disk images, \nthe better. \n\n*I'm running Mac OS X 10.4.11, so I can't use cryptomfs (plus, I'm \nnot sure if cryptomfs creates several small files or one large \nfile). I have MacFUSE installed, so I tried installing cryptomfs anyway,\nbut it failed (both 1.0 DMG and 1.1 pkg file). \n\n*Since upgrading is neither free nor easy, I'd prefer to avoid it. \n\n*I've considered other options (eg, a directory of hard links to \nthe files with encrypted names for the hard links and relying on my \nbackup service for content encryption), but they get fairly complex. \n\nA: If you are on Leopard (OS X 10.5 or above) you can do this by having one encrypted disk image containing all the files.\nThe dmg to create in DiskUtility is a sparsebundle. This creates one bundle that mounts as a disk to OSX but actually is a directory and all the files in it are of a much smaller size. In Finder select the sparsesbundle and then Show Package Contents.\nI just created a sparsebundle of capacity 1TB and copyied a 400GB vieo file onto it. The structure of the bindle had many files none of which were above 9MB\nThe band size can be controlled see hdiutil. But I have not done or worked out how do do this.\n\nA: Unfortunately I don't think there's anything that will do exactly what you're looking for.

I am pretty sure you cannot do this.\nIcons that are not \"pinned\" to the dock for easy access are populated from left to right in the order that you launch the corresponding application.\nWhat is in the dock is specified by the dock preferences file, and by managed settings (MCX) if the machine is connected to an Open Directory server.\nIf an application is listed in one of these settings locations, its icon will appear in the dock, whether the application is running or not.  If it is not in one of these settings locations, the application icon _will_not_ appear in the dock until it is launched.\nIt is possible i suppose that there is a third party utility that is capable of what you are asking, but it is not something that the stock Dock in OS X can do.\nSorry...

I learned in Upgraded to Lion: Time Machine spends a LOT of time indexing backup that if I hold down the option key and click the Time Machine icon in the menu bar, the \"Back Up Now\" menu item changes to \"Verify Backups\".  But for some reason, on my MacBook Air, \"Verify Backups\" is disabled (greyed-out).  How do I find out why?\nI'm running OS X 10.7.1, and have FileVault turned on for \"Macintosh HD\" (my internal storage).  My Time Machine backup is to an external USB HD, which I've encrypted.\n\nCould that be why?  Does Lion not support \"Verify Backups\" with an encrypted Time Machine HD? \n\nA: Okay, so I did a bit of digging, and perhaps found a clue as to why the option is not accessible (to some at least). Read this MacWorld Hint, specifically, look down at the comment from joekewe (on Feb 08, '11 06:08:14PM):\n\nFrom a web search, it looks like \"Verify Time Machine Backup\" should be called \"Verify Time Capsule\" backup. My system log shows that I attempted to verify my Time Machine backup:\ncom.apple.backupd[70595]: Backup verification requested by user.\n\nbut (I believe) because it is a locally mounted volume, it didn't do anything and didn't leave any more entries in the log. From this older knowledgeable article, it looks like Verify Time Machine was added when Time Capsule was having trouble.\n\nIt might be the case that he's onto something. The option is also grayed out for me, but I have a local TM disk connected via USB. Can anyone confirm they can use the feature with their Time Capsules?\nIt may have been that they actually fixed the menu option, in that, it should have been grayed out for Snow Leopard users connected through USB (read the comments as many people talk about having the service do nothing), but it wasn't. So in Lion, it behaves correctly.\n\nA: \"Verify Backups\" is applicable only to backups on network drives.  It will be greyed out if you are backing up to a local drive.\nApple should have been clearer in indicating this.\nFrom Finder > Help > Verify your backup disk\n\nVerify your backup disk\nIf you back up to a network disk, Time Machine periodically verifies that your backups are in good condition. If you like, you can perform a verification at any time.\n\n*\n\n*Open the Time Machine menu in the menu bar, press the Option key on your keyboard, and then choose Verify Backups.\n\n\n\nA: I have one of the new Time Capsules - 2TB, 4th generation. I used to be able to use \"Verify Backups\" in Snow Leopard when I had a connected USB drive and used that for Time Machine. But since switching to the Time Capsule (and the first time I've tried it in Lion), \"Verify Backups\" is greyed out :(\nUpdate: Strange! Now it's working. I just tried it with my Time Capsule and its verifying. It got further than it did last time. It's at 11% (and much slower I will say vs. when in Snow Leopard) currently. But its working.

And I'm curious to see if there are any advanced options for ejectable volumes. Such as hiding a partition, password protecting, and so forth.\nNow, I'm not asking for software that does this. I'm asking if OS X offers any of these solutions. Or if OS X doesn't, can things like this be done through Terminal?\nIf you have any answers, or know of any online tutorials, please post them here. :)\n\nA: To Disable Automount\nGetting the UUID\nThe first thing you will need is the volume's UUID (universal unique identifier) number, which can be found by opening Disk Utility, selecting the volume of interest, and then pressing Command+I or clicking the blue information button in the Disk Utility toolbar. In the window that appears, locate and copy the UUID, which is a string of alphanumeric characters separated by dashes.\nMaking changes to fstab\nWith the UUID, you can now create an fstab entry for the volume that prevents it from mounting:\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal.\n\n\n*Edit the fstab file by running the following command (supply your password when prompted):\n sudo pico /etc/fstab\n\n\n\n*Create a new line at the end of the file that looks like the following (note: replace \"NUMBER\" with the full UUID string you copied from Disk Utility):\n UUID=NUMBER none hfs rw,noauto\n\nSave the file by pressing Control+O, followed by Control+X to quit the editor.\nPerform these steps for each volume you wish to prevent automatically mounting, then restart the system, and they should no longer automatically mount.

I've been using an MS Natural KB 4000 for quite a while but I need to retire it and thought I'd look around for something that would work a little better in OSX (mute, volume keys, keys actually labeled for all things Mac-y).\nI've been using an Apple keyboard for the last week and while it looks cool, it's just awful to type on for any amount of time. Since I'm a programmer that is an issue. \nI checked out Logitech's site and they don't seem to have any Mac specific keyboards any more. Google's not helping out. Any coders out there have a favorite keyboard?\n\nA: I'm not a coder. I'm a writer of prose and I type 90 words per minute, and like you, I can't stand Apple's keyboards. For years I used an ergonomic keyboard and the original Microsoft Natural Keyboard circa 1994 was the best for my needs. When I wore out my second Natural Keyboard, ultimately I determined that the issue for me wasn't the need for the ergonomic shape. Rather, it was the need for something with a deep, full, springy, clicky key travel, which I find much less fatiguing than typing on shallow keyboards. So these days I've gone back to conventional non-ergonomic keyboards but ones with full-travel clicky keys. The Matias USB 2.0 keyboard is my favorite and it's quite affordable. I also have a Happy Hacking Keyboard Lite 2 (OEM by Fujitsu, I believe) when I want to get totally minimalist. It's also favored by a lot of coders, I understand. It's been on the market for many years, and is reasonably priced.\n\nWith regard to a true ergonomic design: Although I have never tried them personally, the Kinesis Maxim and Freestyle models are available, and also in a version specifically for Mac.\n\n\n", "Q: Is my Bluetooth Connection to Magic Track Pad Encrypted? I know bluetooth supports encryption, but is it in use?  How do I know?\nThe help in the Bluetooth preference pane gives some vague answers:\n\nFor extra security, you can stipulate that only trusted devices be allowed to connect to your Mac, and 128-bit over-the-air encryption is also available.  \n\nBut I don't see any options like what they just said.\nNothing on the Apple Store's product description for the Magic Trackpad says anything about encryption.  Same for Amazon.  Same for the Apple Support pages.\nMaybe it's encrypted and Apple thinks that's just obvious, so they don't waste time telling you it is, but I'm looking for evidence.\n\nA: All bluetooth connections to Mac OS X are lightly encrypted by default as part of the pairing process. Unless someone is bringing an intentional effort (e.g. technical knowledge and specialized hardware) to bear, your keyboard and data connections are more secure than a good WiFi network. Cracking encrypted bluetooth is not easy unless you can access the computer or capture the pairing session data.\n\nApple's Bluetooth keyboard, for example, has a pretty complex passphrase that is unique to each device. The trackpad, magic mouse and keyboard all use the same Broadcom bluetooth chip as well.\nTo paraphrase, the level of protection depends on the length and uniqueness of your device's passphrase, and how often you change it (which only happens when you re-pair a keyboard, for instance, not sure if it even changes then for the trackpad).\nFor details see how secure is Bluetooth encryption? (though beware, it's from 2004); also Which wireless keyboard is most secure? has some interesting reading, but doesn't really focus on BT security.\n", "Q: Airport - List of Network is not displayed on startup I am having a weird problem.

As Lion now supports Resume, does it mean that most software no long need starting at login, as when they are open, they remain open in the next boot-up?\nOf course it won't apply to those tools which only run once at login and auto quit afterwards.\n\nA: Resume is an option that is enabled by the user; if the user doesn't select the checkbox when he shut-down Lion, then the applications will not be re-opened at start-up.\nResume is an option for applications that don't run in background, such as text editors, documents editors, browsers, which are opened when necessary. If also background applications would rely on that, then users would not have any possibility, if not closing all the applications they don't want re-opened by Lion; differently to have a background application re-opened when the Lion is shut-down or restarted, they would also have the other applications re-opened.\n\nA: Resume is a feature designed on a simple premise: Give the illusion of coming back to your computer like nothing ever happened. Under the hood, there's actually not a lot of magic going on.\nWhat OS X does, is take a \"snapshot\" of the apps you have open—consisting of small details, like window dimension and position, etc. (you can see the data it collects by looking in ~/Library/Saved Application State/). When the system reboots, and OS X is loaded once again, the system retrieves this information and then launches the app for you. Since it takes time to actually load apps, the information it gathered before is applied, giving the illusion as if everything is already loaded and ready to go. This gives the system time to actually get things up and running, while the user is none the wiser.\nThe feature was ported over from iOS (among other's that have found their way in Lion), which does essentially the same thing (even going as far as taking a screenshot of the running app to cut down on the appearance of loading).\nSo does this mean you'll never have to launch another app? That depends entirely on you and how you use your Mac. But it does make a reboot less of a chore for those that like to multi-task, or always have a handful of applications running and organized in a certain way. It also makes the experience less \"jarring\" as things come back pretty much exactly how you left them.\nThis feature is applied to all the user-based applications (things like Mail and Safari), while system level components (kernel_task and mdworker) are exempt because quite frankly, all that matters to the user is the stuff they run. The operating system's fundamental components always do their own thing, outside of the user's control, and a user shouldn't (and doesn't) need to worry about them.\nIf you care to learn more about all the new features in Lion, you can read the fine article over at Ars Technica. It is truly exceptionally written and one of the finest pieces you're going to find on this new cat.\n", "Q: Is there any reason why I shouldn't install Java? I know that you can improve performance and battery life by not having Flash on your Mac. Is there any similar advantage to not installing Java?\n\nA: Installing java won't have much effect on battery life. \nI don't think installing Flash will have much effect either.\nWhere the issue is is when you hit a website with badly written flash (and to a very much less extent Java) where the animation takes up CPU but you can just leave these sites - you will be no worse off than not installing.\nJava is now rare on websites and not really used for parts of the web site the user does not need.\nI think a better way is to install a plugin for your browser like ClickToFlash which stops Flash loading until you tell it.\n\nA: Yes - you won't have to worry about updating software that Apple seems to be less and less inclined to let run. It also has earned a reputation as software that you want to devote time and attention to patching or making sure you never run code you don't trust.\nIf you're not going to block java in the web and take measures to secure it, you'd be better off not installing java on OS X from a security and maintenance standpoint.\nPersonally, I decline to instal flash and disable java entirely on my portable Mac so that I have less running, better battery life and less security exposure and reduced maintenance.\nBy not installing java or flash, you have two less things to update and two less things to run content while browsing the web.\n\nA: Yes- mid 2010 Macbook pro, OWC SSD 120gb\nI installed Java and battery life fell to under 2 hours. Uninstalled it and battery life returned to the normal 6 hours.  Tested by using laptop until the battery drained. Beware it's a HUGE battery drainer.\n", "Q: Changing Folder's Icon I am using Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.8. I tried changing a folder's icon using this well known method. I used a png image as my target icon. The icon does get changed, but not to the picture itself, but the icon of a png file.\nThe Icon I want to be there:\n\nWhat I get:\n\nYou see? That is not the png itself, but the icon of a png file.\nI want the png to be the icon. Am I missing something?\n(If it is important, \"Show Icon Preview\" is turned on in Finder view options. This folder was read-only for everyone but after seeing Problems changing drive icon I changed it to Read Write for everyone)\n\nA: I've had a similar problem in the past.\nFirst, open the file you want to use as an icon in Preview. Select all, then copy.\nClose Preview.\nNavigate to the folder whose icon you want to change. Go to File-> Get Info. Select the icon at the top left of the info window and paste. The folder's icon should be changed.\nBasically, by copying the image directly from Preview, we don't have to worry about how the image has been saved and whether the image's icon is a generic one or a rendered preview (which was likely the problem originally).\n\nA: LiteIcon is another good choice. I had the same problem, and ended up using LiteIcon. I highly recommend it, as it has an easy to use interface and is also free. (Note that the link goes to the home page of the developer for LiteIcon. You'll have to click on \"LiteIcon\" at the top of the web page)\n", "Q: What are typical use of using different 'network locations' Usually I'm just using the \"Automatic\" location in System preferences->Network with my home and work wifi networks configured.\nI was wondering what would be the advantage to configure different locations ... What is it useful for ?\n\nA: If you have a different network setup somewhere, that's the obvious reason to use locations.  For instance:\nI use a public DNS provider (like GoogleDNS or OpenDNS).  That means I don't use the DNS server on the local network.  However, when I go into a public WiFi location (a coffee-shop, hotel, etc) this can cause problems.  The issue is that the authorization step to get onto the local WiFi network requires that my browser go to some page.  And to get to that page, I have to use DNS to figure out the IP address.  But, my request to Google's DNS server isn't allowed, since I'm not yet part of the network.\nSo, I set up a network location called \"CoffeeShop\" which doesn't specify a DNS server.  I renamed my \"automatic\" location to be \"GoogleDNS\".  Now, when I'm at Panera's and want to use their public WiFi, I switch location to \"CoffeeShop\" and then my DNS query during authorization goes to the local DNS server.  Note that you can quickly switch location under the apple menu (this only shows up if you have more than one location specified).\nEnjoy!\n\nA: I primarily use it to distinguish between different proxy servers at different locations. For instance, at work we have a proxy server, and at home also. I do not want to type in the proxy server address each time, so I create a location or each. Then you can just set it to wherever you are and the proxy server changes.\n", "Q: How can I configure the keyboard layout for the FileVault 2 unlock screen? I installed Mac OS X Lion and enabled FileVault to have a full disk encryption of my system disk. I bought my Mac with a French keyboard (since I'm French and used to this layout) but my Mac is configured to be in English, except for the keyboard layout.\nHowever, after enabling FileVault, my Mac rebooted and I was greeted with the FileVault unlock screen and asked for my password. I entered it, and was told it was incorrect. After many try, I suspected that the keyboard layout was not French but US. I managed to enter my keyboard with this mapping and it was accepted (I'm lucky that I know enough of the Us keyboard layout to do that).\nI went to the System Preferences, but I didn't see an option to change the keyboard layout on the FileVault unlock screen. Nor did I see an option to changed it when I was blocked at the prompt.\nSo, I'm wondering how can I change the keyboard layout of the FileVault unlock screen?\n\nA: The following works.\nSystem Preferences -> Login -> Login Options -> Check Enable Show Input menu in login window\n\n", "Q: Folders in Applications not in sync with Launchpad I created a folder in /Applications to move all Games into a folder called Games. Launchpad is not in sync with the folders that I created. \nLooking at the folder Utilities, I was under the impression that creating a folder in /Applications would keep Launchpad in sync . \nIs there a way to keep these two distinct Applications (LaunchPad and Finder) which show me a list apps to respect the folders hierarchy ? \n\nA: The two hierarchies are separate, and cannot be kept in sync without third-party intervention. Even then, there would be difficulties. Note that Launchpad folders have capacity limits that actual folders do not have, and folders within /Applications can contain nested folders, while Launchpad folders cannot.\nIt's just a coincidence that the apps in /Applications/Utilities match up with the Utilities folder in Launchpad. On my machine, I moved Terminal out of the Utilities folder in Launchpad, but it's still /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app\n", "Q: Can I switch off disk while disk encryption is going on I am trying to encrypt a disk which is taking approximately 20-30 minutes per every 1% . \nCan I restart/switch off my Mac while the encryption is going on ? \nWould the Mac automagically resume encryption after switching it back on ?\n\nA: If you're using the Lion's built-in encryption, the answer is yes. You can just work with the disk as usual, and the encryption happens in the background, even if you restart the Mac.\nIn Terminal.app, you can check the encryption status with\ndiskutil cs list\n\n", "Q: OSX does not recognize the Scroll Lock key on my external USB Keyboard I am trying to share my monitor and keyboard/mouse between my PC (Windows 7) and Macbook Pro (1,1 - 2006, Snow Leopard) using a basic KVM switch (Trendnet TK207).\nBy hitting Scroll Lock twice the KVM switches from one computer to another. The problem is this works on Windows but not in OS X. OS X does not recognize my Scroll Lock key at all (even the Scroll Lock light doesn't work).\nAny ideas on how to debug/fix this problem?\n\nA: I made a small command line utility to fix this for my Trendnet TK-204UK. The trick is to toggle the Scroll Lock LED state on the keyboard because it seems to be monitored by the switch. Mac does not normally toggle the LED when you press the Scroll Lock key. I found an Apple sample program (HID LED test tool) that does low level access to the keyboard and modified it to flash the Scroll Lock LED. I called it kvm, put it in my /usr/local/bin and bingo no need to reach under the desk to do what I bought this switch to do. Here is the modified main function of the main.c file of the HID_LED_test_tool project. Note that you will probably have to change a setting of the Xcode project to compile it with the 10.7 SDK because it is configured to use 10.5.\n--- update ---\nThis solution works (thank you so much) but you are missing some of the code.  You need to go to http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#samplecode/HID_LED_test_tool/Listings/main_c.html and grab the function declared at the top.  \nAlso for anyone who doesn't know what to do with this, you need to create a new command line OS X application in Xcode and build this.  Then you can run it to switch your KVM.  You'll also need to add CoreFoundation.framework and IOKit.framework to the build.\n--- end update ---\n--- update 2 ---\nJust realized that if instead of building a \"Command line OS X application\", you create a \"Cocoa Application\" and then delete everything except for main.m and dump the code below in that, you'll create a 'regular' application instead of a 'command line' application and that will launch quicker (without loading up terminal) and can be docked on the dock, etc.  If you do go with the \"Cocoa App\" you'll have to update some of the build settings to correspond to the files you delete. \n--- end update 2 ---\n//\n//  main.m\n//\n\n// ****************************************************\n#pragma mark -\n#pragma mark * complation directives *\n//

Once you get into the iTunes mode (e.g. after clicking \"get more episodes\" on a podcast view) it seems you are stuck forever wandering the endless isles of the iTunes store.\nWhen you first open the iPod app, going to \"podcasts\" shows the podcasts that are downloaded to your phone. But once you've gone into \"iTunes mode\", clicking \"podcasts\" now reveals all the podcasts available on iTunes.\nHow do you get back to the original mode? The only way I've found is exiting the iPod app and opening it again. Is that really the way it's designed (presumably \"by Apple in California\")?\nAm I missing something here?\n\nA: What you refer to as \"iTunes mode\" is actually a separate application called iTunes. The only way to get back is to relaunch the iPod app. If you have a multitasking-capable device, you can double tap on the home button and the iPod app will be there as it was the most recently used app.\n", "Q: Where does Mac OS X save the list of items/icons it shows in the Finder sidebar? Because a problem of compatibility between Mac OS X 10.6 and 10.7 (the problem was that the computer with Mac OS X 10.6 and 10.7 were both synchronized with the same Mobile Me account), I see an icon the desktop in the sidebar of Finder, even if the icon is not selected to appear.\n\nI even tried to remove it dragging it off the sidebar, or clicking it with the right button and selecting \"Remove from Sidebar,\" but the icon is still there.\nThe problem is that the dialog box to open files shows two icons for the Desktop, in some applications.\n\nI think that the only solution is to manually edit the preference file containing the information about the icons that appear in the sidebar. Which file is it?\nIs there any alternative for to removing that icon, or a tool that helps with these problems?\n\nA: The Finder Sidebar is defined in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist. It may be stored in binary. If you have a property list editor, this won't matter; if you don't, you'll want to convert it to XML first:\nplutil -convert xml1 ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist\n\nThen, open it in a text editor.

This machine has Snow Leopard installed. When I try to e.g. boot from my Lion USB Recovery HD, i plug in the USB stick, press alt during bootup, both systems (the SL one on the disk & the Recovery on the USB stick) appear, I select the Recovery HD.. and again, the same (logo, then grey forever).\nWhat's going on here and what can I do?\nUpdate:\nfollowing the numerous suggestions below (thanks!), I checked the verbose boot logging, but nothing too troubling appeared, well sort of. Right before the monitor turns grey again, the color of the logging font turns from white to pink?\nThis:\n\nto this:\n\n.. (the image is kinda off, somehow it doesn't capture the pinkishness of the color) then grey forever again.\nAdditionally I could enter safe mode, but the same is here.. colors seem strange & not entirely correct (I suppose it's not intended that way, right?):\n\n\nI put the Nvidia 8800GT in the other slot on the mainboard, the same again. Is this a sign of a failing graphic card (the boot manager menu looks just fine)?\n\nA: This happened earlier this year to a friend. The cause was disk\n    directory damage. Upon start (during the Gray Screen of Doom) the\n    Mac was trying to repair the damage automatically, but failing.\n    Here's how I talked her through it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Power down the Mac.\n\n*Boot in Safe Mode (press Power button, listen for startup\ntone, immediately press and hold Shift, release Shift when you see\nApple logo).\n\n*Let the computer boot in Safe Mode. It may take longer  than\nnormal.\n\n*If the computer eventually reaches the desktop, simply reboot\n    normally and see if that fixed your problem. This is the point at which this procedure worked out for my friend.\n\n*If the computer is still having problems, boot from a Mac OS X\n    Install DVD (insert DVD, power down, restart hiding down C key).\n\n*When you reach the Installer screen, use the Utilities menu to\nrun\n    Disk Utility, then choose Repair Disk under the First Aid tab (if the hard disk doesn't show up in the sidebar in Disk Utility, the disk is likely irretrievably broken).\nIf these steps don't work, I'd suggest that you either a) Wipe the disk and do a full restore from your most recent backup; b) invest in a heavy-duty disk utility like Disk Warrior; c) take the computer to the nearest Apple Store for support help.\n\nA: Generally with this kind of problem the first trouble shooting step is to reset the PRAM by holding down  ⌘  +  ⌥  +  P  +  R  on boot. Also reset the SMC might help, but doing this requires a process specific to your machine, which can be easily found out on Google.\n\nA: Do you have any external drives (or peripherals) connected? I had this problem sometimes due to an external hard drive (I thought it was the enclosure, but it turned out the drive was itself failing and had to be RMAed). I disconnected it, and the boot sequence resumed.\n", "Q: External HDD problem with iMac OSX I purchased a 3TB HDD, which I put into an USB enclosure for my iMac.  The drive is recognized at boot, but it only shows 801.23GB. \nI formatted the drive with into two 1.5TB FAT32 partitions via Win7. My Windows machine shows the correct partitions, but when I attach the enclosure to my iMac it shows one 801.23GB partition.\nDo you have any idea?\n\nA: I have no idea why the Mac can't see the 2 partitions.\nTry using Disk Utility on the Mac to format the drive with FAT 32, then give it 2 partitions, and see if the Windows likes it.\nThat's the best I can come up with.  It works with thumb drives.\n", "Q: Installing from a .pkg or .mpkg file on Mac OS X Lion I have a strange problem since upgrading to Lion: Some .pkg and .mpkg files won't open the installer but instead will open the terminal, and no installation takes place.\nThe most recent example is the Microsoft Office 2011 Update 14.1.2.\nDoes anyone know of that problem?\n\nA: The update did not work for me, as I had already run it. It broke after the update. I still had the problem. In Finder, I could see that the file extension icon was not the gold/tan box icon that goes with Installer. There are two ways to do this. 1) In Finder, right-click, or get to the property window, and \"Open With\" and navigate to /System/Library/CoreServices/Installer.app. There is a checkbox to always open with this app. -or- 2) Open Installer itself and drag the mpkg file into it. Run the installer.\nBoth of these should run, and also change the mpkg icon in your Finder.\n\nA: Ha, I thought I'll have a look if there is a new mac osx update and—\"yes!\"—Mac OSX Update 10.7.1 solved the problem.\n", "Q: Can I have a second menu bar on my secondary display? Is there software that will allow you to add a second menu bar to a secondary display? I am using Second Bar, but I was wondering if there was other software out there that would do this. Note that I don't want to move the menu bar. I know I can move the menu bar in System Preferences. This is not what I want. I want a second menu bar.\n\nA: To the best of my knowledge, no there is not another app that currently provides the same functionality as Second Bar.\nMenuEverywhere or DejaMenu provide other workarounds to make menu bar commands selectable elsewhere, but I am not aware of any other program that puts a menu bar on multiple monitors.\n\nA: Multimon \n\"adds a menubar to your second (or third, or so on) display and gives you hotkeys to quickly move windows from one monitor to another. You also get a menubar icon to click and move windows. When it does move windows, it automatically scales and resizes them for you to match the target monitor's resolution.\" - lifehacker\nNote: not free ($10)\n", "Q: Window manipulation software \nPossible Duplicate:\nDo any window managers allow me to snap windows to the sides of the display? \n\nI was wondering if there is software out there that will make OS X windows act like Windows 7. For instance, you can \"bump\" a window at the top of the screen and it will fill the screen. Or, \"bumping\" the left/right will make the window become half-screen.\n\nA: I just found a nice app for these functions! It's called cinch and it is aviable in the appstore for 7$ (but you can also use the demo)\n\nA: An alternative to Cinch that is less mouse-based and more keyboard-based is DoublePane. It is available in the Mac App Store. It provides you with easy keyboard shortcuts to place windows side-by-side, full screen or back to their original positions. It is inexpensive and works as advertised. Hope this helps. \n", "Q: Changing the icon on the \"window bar\" Mac OS X I was wondering how I could change the icon in the \"window bar\" of my Mac app \nI've also added a picture of the icon I want to change since i believe window bar isn't the correct term.\n\nThank you in advance! :)\n\nA: You'll want to use -setRepresentedFilename:or the other similar methods. I don't think you can just change the icon to anything, it has to be associated with a file.\n", "Q: What extra features does the iOS YouTube application have over the HTML one? I also asked the same question for Android but I found that Android Browser has a bug that crashes when uploading big files, so you need the native app: What extra features has the Android YouTube application over the HTML one?\nIt seems that iOS 5 still provides the native YouTube app, but it seems it is obsolete:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.pcworld.com/article/200686/youtube_mobile_site_trumps_dedicated_app.html\n\n*http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/07/youtube-iphone-mobile-html5/\n\nA: I use YouTube for the simplest case - watching movies that have been sent to me. I don't do much posting or browsing.\nTo my knowledge, the iOS YouTube app hasn't seen a lot of changes since the 1.0.\nI think the biggest \"feature\" of the native app is the improved responsiveness. I've found the webapp to be slower doing things like full screen or changing screen orientation, and in the initial loading speed. However I wasn't aware of the decreased quality. I think it should however load the higher bitrate videos when you're on Wifi.\nAs for uploading, on iOS that's usually handled by the app that's recording/editing the video.\n", "Q: Archive emails on Google Mail using Apple Mail Is it possible to archive emails using apple mail? Or do I have to log in to the web UI to archive old mail? I am using 10.6.7.\n\nA: Two options work for this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Move the message to the [Gmail]/All Mail folder. Mail.app will show two copies of the message in there, but it will appear properly in other clients (definitely the web interface and on iPhones, should be respected elsewhere).\n\n*Goto the Mailbox Behaviours section in the Accounts tab of the Mail.app preferences and deselect \"Move deleted messages to the Trash mailbox\" and \"Store deleted messages on the server\". This way deleting messages out of your Inbox removes them instantly, but there's still the archived copy in [Gmail]/All Mail. Solves the duplicates problem, but if you really want to delete something, you've got to move it to the [Gmail]/Trash folder.\nHope that helps. Google has published some other guidelines for using Gmail in Mail.app that may be helpful.\n\nA: Obviously it's a non-trivial fix, but upgrading to Lion would also enable the feature you are looking for.\n", "Q: What do the small-sunrise / big-sunrise icons mean on F5 and F6 on the MacBook Air? What do the F5 and F6 keys do on the 2011 MacBook Air?  They are marked with what I interpret to be small-sunrise and big-sunrise icons.  I do not see any effect when I press them.\n\nA: These are for decreasing and increasing the brightness of the keyboard backlight. When the system senses low light and the keyboard is allowed to illuminate, the keys will work. Otherwise, they silently do nothing at all.\n\n", "Q: Ejecting CD from Mac after fresh install? I just installed Lion on a Mac Mini, and I can't get the CD to eject.  Currently, the computer boots up to the \"Welcome\" screen for new installs, where the Country/Region is selected.  I want to leave it at this point because I'm selling the machine, but want to eject the disk.\nWhen booting up, I've tried several keyboard shortcuts, but none of them are working:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"C\" -- to boot of the CD\n\n*\"Cmd + Option + F + O\" -- to bo into firmware mode where a cd can be ejected with a command\n\n*holding down the left-mouse button\n\n*\"option\" -- supposed to eject the disk\n\n*\"Cmd + R\" -- should go to the recovery console\n\n\nI'm using a wireless keyboard, which wasn't having a problem loading up Cmd+R menu before I did install.  I'm guessing the \"Welcome\" screen is bypassing all other commands.  Seems weird though.  I wonder if my wireless keyboard decided to start delaying when it connects with the computer.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: In the past when I have had issues with discs not ejecting I would restart holding option until a screen is displayed that will ask to boot from either the CD or the internal HDD, without making a selection hit the eject key. Then you can shut the computer down then.\n\nA: Push F12 to eject!\nhttp://www.faqforge.com/macosx/how-to-eject-a-cd-in-a-mac-mini-with-pc-keyboard-and-mouse/\n\nA: Traditionally, Macs with DVD drives had a small hole by the side that you could stick an unfolded paperclip into, which would mechanically force eject the disk.\nFrom a quick Google of photos, the 2010 Mini (the last with DVD drive) does seem to have such a hole.\n", "Q: Safari extension to get rid of Google redirect links in search results? I'm looking for a Safari extension that can rewrite the google search results so that it gives you the direct URLs rather than the long jumbled redirect links that often pop up. \nIf you're wondering what I'm talking about, Google often (but not always) gives you the results with redirect URLs like this:\nhttp://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CBgQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fextensions.apple.com%2F&ei=56lZTvqqCNP-sQKKzoGZDA&usg=AFQjCNG8RJkKTqQOF1SSdxFTGI4J6iArug\nwhich make it a pain when trying to share/copy&paste a link, not to mention whatever additional tracking nonsense goes on behind the scenes.\nIt's definitely possible, as there seem to be some Greasemonkey scripts available for Firefox, but I haven't been able to find any Safari extensions that do this so far.\n\nA: Canisbos has released another extension called gDirectLinks, which is a more efficient subset of LinkThing focused solely on the task of removing the hidden redirects from Google's links. It handles both regular Google search and the more modern Google Instant search (AJAX; most people are using that version these days without knowing it, as it's on by default). It also has the option of re-writing Google Images results to point directly to the image.\nIt's very important to note that gDirectLinks (and its big brother, LinkThing) is the only extension of its kind that properly handles Google Instant results.\nMore information is available at the official website. Enjoy!\n\n\nA: Here's the extension you're looking for:\nhttp://pedrocc.com/safari\nIt's called Disable ClickTracker by Pedro Campelo Cavalcanti.\n\"Disable ClickTracker\" removes click tracking on the initial page load. It will not work for people using Google Instant Search.\nThe only extension that handles both regular and Google Instant results is the new gDirectLinks.\n\nA: Clean Links for Google is another Safari extension that removes Google's redirects. Seems to work on Safari 10, and handles Google Instant. For those that are interested, here is the source code.\n\nA: I know this question is old but I found it trying to find an extension I had used on another machine (which no one else mentioned).\nSafari History Washer is what I was looking for, incase it helps anyone else.\n", "Q: Macbook fan problems :( For awhile now, my MB has been slowing down at times and I've been trying to diagnose the problem. Here were my hunches:\n\n\n*\n\n*old age?(only 2 yrs old)\n\n*needs more RAM(at 2GB - this is the late 2009 MB btw, the last one before the unibody)\n\n*fan problems\n\n*filevault?\n\n\nThe immediate thing I could do was to check the fans. So, I installed smcFanControl at first but then nothing was happening. I created a \"High RPM\" setting and even if I set it to that, fan stays at 2000rpm. When I open a flash app(say an fb game or even Steam) it lurches to 6krpm(not surprising i guess?)\nAnyway, I tried another fan control(Fan Control) for Mac and now I got this:\n\nthe right fan is at -1! Is this the reason? I am guessing it is somehow broken and that the left fan was compensating for the longest time, which may or may not have been the culprit to the slow down. Is it? Stupid question, but should a hot MB slow down in the first place?\n\nA: I had fan problems too on my macbook (Black 2006) and in fact I installed Fan Control too. I thought I would never have to see that app again! haha.\nOk. First things first. It is pretty normal that Flash makes your fan spin like crazy. It happens on my machine too, since it is really processor intensive.\nSecondly, as far as I know Macbooks have just 1 fan, unlike iMacs for example, so if thats the case of your machine (which most likeley is, but jsut to make sure research) than you must not worry for the -1. \nAnd finally: nope. Fan speeds should not affect the performance of your machine. I know because when I had problems with mine my macbook would just overheat/make noise but work as usual. The fan even died, and my macbook kept running (though it's dangerous to run a computer without a fan). I didn't notice this happened and it finally overheated to about 90-100 degrees Celsius which caused it to shutdown automatically for safety. My point? I didn't even notice, because my mac never slowed down. \nSo I'm guessing your issues are due to something else. \nFirevalut could be a reason, and a pretty big one if your disk is very cluttered. Even with Firevalut off, disk clutter can slow down your computer if its excessive, specially on startup.\nRAM could be, specially if your running memory intensive apps. Your macbook should be able to get an upgrade. Your manual should have some more info on that, like up to what you can expand it (perhaps 4 or 8 GB).\nWhat OS do you have? If your'e still running leopard I recomend Snow Leopard: it frees up Disk Space and has some other optimizations.\nAnd last, your apps. Check if any apps are eating your CPU in the background using Activity Monitor (Applications/Utilities/Activity Monitor). Also, check on System Preferences for any apps loading when you loggin (Accounts > Login Items tab). Try to get rid of some background apps you might not need. \nHope it helps! Anything else you need just tell me.\n", "Q: How do I record on a 13\" MBP? Where is the mic jack on a 13\" MBP? I want to plug in a 3.5mm jack (like the iPod headphone size) into the MBP. How do I do that?\n\nA: Physical location of the jack:\n\nThe audio-in jack on a 13\" MBP is a 3.5mm combination TRS port. \nIt will sense standard analog or fiber optic connectors. It also works with TRS jacks for stereo audio out as well as a TRRS jack which allows microphone input as well as control from iPhone/iPod compatible remotes. \nIt can work as a headphone out, line-in, or digital audio in/out depending what's plugged into it. It can also accept an iPhone-compatible headset with mic and use the mic (and remote functions for music). Some non-amplified microphone input requires further hardware to properly deliver the signal. According to the specs it doesn't, but it seems like if it takes an iPhone headset mic, the signal will be delivered, but in a less usable form.\nA popular USB connector like the Griffin iMic works well with more diverse input sources and contains an external D/A converter. The iMic support FAQ discusses the many aspects of sound capture and is a great reference on the topic.\nThis instructables guide on making a combination headphone+mic adapter might also be of use.\n\nA: The best way to get a good-quality recording is to connect a microphone or audio signal to  an external analog-to-digital audio interface with a microphone preamplifier, which connects to the MacBook via USB 2.0 or FireWire 400.\nThere are many devices by many companies that perform this function. Here is one, the AudioBox USB from Presonus.\n\n", "Q: How to make the \"Search with Google\" menu option open up in a new tab by default in Safari? I know I can Command-click it to achieve that. What I want is to change the default behavior from opening in the same tab to opening in a new tab.\nIs there an extension or a hidden configuration for that?\n\n\nA: In this article Jonathan Rentzsch creates a new service because he wants \"Search with Google\" to work in Chrome (his default browser) but a side benefit of following his tutorial is that your search should open in a new tab. \nIf your default browser is Safari it should open your new tab there.\nhttp://rentzsch.tumblr.com/post/5794765921/search-with-google-using-chrome\nWarning: This is essentially a follow directions, cut-and-paste affair but it does involve seeing code. I'm unaware of a easy to install extension to accomplish this same task.\n", "Q: How can I use a non-amplified mic on a MBP? How do I use a non-amplified/powered mic on a MBP? Or is it not possible without an amplifier/interface. I don't really want to get an amplifier or USB/Firewire interface, but if I have to, I will.\n\nA: You can't get good results with an unpowered microphone without a cable adapter or USB interface. The best bet is to purchase one of the many USB to audio interface dongles available. A favorite of mine is this one from Monoprice in California, which costs under $10. It includes a stereo headphone output and a mono mic input. It will also handle  powered microphones, such as the Audio-Technica ATR-3350 lavaliere mic. I have two of these mics, and they offer excellent value for money (about $20).\n", "Q: Changing a Volume's \"Device / Media Name\" I know a Mac volume can be renamed... obviously.\nBut if you look at the output of diskutil you will see that a volume also has a \"device name\" that corresponds to the name it was given when it was formatted:\ndiskutil info /dev/disk0s1 | grep 'Media Name'\n\nRunning it on your root volume you will probably get \"Macintosh HD\" (or else something like \"Untitled 1\" if that's how you left it when formatting in Disk Utility). It seems this doesn't change when you rename the volume after the fact.\nWhy do these different names for the same volume exist?\nDoes anything even refer to this hidden name?\nCan it be changed?\n\nA: The Device / Media Name is set when a partition is created on a disk. The only way you could rename the \"startup partition\" would be to startup from another drive. The initial name is set by Apple code by the way. \nOn Lion you will most likely find the following device names:\ndisk0: The make and model of your drive \n\n\n*\n\n*You'll never change this.\n\n\ndisk0s1: \"EFI system partition\" \n\n\n*\n\n*Extended firmware for your drive is stored here - you won't be changing this one either.\n\n\ndisk0s2: \"Customer\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Named for you, Apple's \"customer\" this is where your files are stored.\n\n\ndisk0s3: \"Recovery HD\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple stores a clean install of the OS here to make restoring your computer easier.\n\n\nIf you add your own custom partition to the mix you will find that Apple's tools (i.e. Disk Utility) will match the visible name and the device name.\nAll of that said there's no reason you should worry about changing this name.

I'm used to working on Unix/Linux and recently moved to Mac. In used to be able to do this:\nderick@linux1:~$ ssh -X linux2\nderick@linux2's password:\nderick@linux2:~$ xclock\n\nI've install X11 from maxports and I can do the same from my mac. If I try the reverse by ssh-ing into my mac from linux I can only run certain apps:\n\n*\n\n*/usr/X11/bin/xclock works fine\n\n\n*Something like /Applications/Preview.app/Contents/MacOS/Preview opens the GUI on the mac.\nIt seems that this is not possible on a mac? If not, how do I run an application remotely (on a mac) with a local (linux) display? Do I need some third-party app?\nUpdate:\nTo be more precise: I have synergy and use Mac for coding. On my linux PC I would like to see another application's display (GUI) from Mac. Thus, 'live screen sharing' apps like VNC will not work.\nFor example I'm working on my mac in app A (say Word) and want to see the output of Excel (running on mac) on my linux PC next to me. (Simulating a dual screen via the network). It worked nicely on linux, hoping for a solution for mac.\n\nA: As Sylvian mentioned, you can't run your Mac apps and display them on Linux. The best you can do is VNC. You'll see the whole screen, not just one app.\nEnable a VNC password in Screen Sharing Preferences:\n\nYou can then use any VNC client application on Linux.\n\nA: The Mac OS X native application do not use the X protocol for the rendering, but the Mac specific protocol. So you cannot use ssh X protocol forwarding as you could with a Linux workstation.\nAs you discovered, the reverse is not true, you can install an X server on Mac OS X and have the Linux program appear on your Mac.\nWhat you can do is use either Mac own desktop sharing facility or install a VNC server. Then from your Linux box, you connect to your Mac through VNC instead of ssh.\n\nA: So if I am not mistaken the the problem you have with VNC currently is that it is sharing the current Mac user's screen with apps open that you don't want to see on your other computer? Lion introduces the ability to screen share users that are logged in the background. Quoting the text from the link:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Enable Screen Sharing and set a VNC password. \n  \n*Take note of your computer’s IP address. \n  \n*Fire up a VNC client on another machine.\n  \n*Connect to your computer’s IP address along with the password you set\n  earlier. \n  \n*You will see the Mac OS X login screen that appears when you\n  first start the computer. If you log into the currently active user\n  you will be controlling the computer’s screen. If you select a\n  different user, you will be logged into that user’s desktop in the\n  background. It will not affect what what is seen on the physical\n  computer screen.\n  \n\nYou will likely just need to create another user for sharing.\n\nA: You're a little out of luck, but ScreenRecycler is going to get you as close as possible. Runs over VNC but convinces OS X the VNC connection is actually a separate monitor, it should allow you to get close to what you need. I've used it, it's pretty good, there's a free trial then it's quite cheap. I stopped using it purely because I was on a crappy network and there was too much latency unless I was directly networking the two.\n\nA: Getting a bit creative, but you can also run a java app using VNC that either has a http server, or in my case uses a loop to look for a file and create that file using SSH.\nHere is my java app.\n", "Q: Switch off keyboard backlight on new MacBooks Older MacBooks had a dedicated key to switch off the keyboard backlight (like the mute key). It was F8 if I'm not mistaken.\nIs it possible to replicate its functionality (e.g.: keyboard shortcut) on the new models?\n\nA: The easiest way is probably to just hold down the dimmer key. Should turn it off less than a second. However it sounds like you want a single press button to turn it off.\nIt's a bit convoluted, but it should work:\nUsing Automator, make an application out of the Applescript from this MacRumors thread. To do this, open Automator, choose Application from the options, search for the Run AppleScript action and add it to the workflow, paste in the script and save. You should end up with something like this:\nThat should give you an application that will disable the backlight.\nQuickSilver is free, and you can set a \"trigger\" to launch the app and bind it to any key you want. If you want to use a function key, try FunctionFlip. It lets you choose which function keys on your MacBook you want to work as actual F-keys and which you want controlling the hardware functions. You can rebind whatever F-key you like and still use the rest for hardware functions if you like.\nIt's worth noting that the Applescript seems to be a disable-only script. There are directions on the accompanying post to make an enable script. With a bit of modification you could probably make it a toggle script, maybe someone else could chime in with that?\nHope that helps.\n\nA: You can turn it off as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple menu > System Preferences...\n\n*Keyboard > Toggle \"Automatically illuminate keyboard in low light\"\n\n\nNote: If you disable the option, you can dim keyboard light with F5 and F6.\n", "Q: \"Could not find RubyGem rails\" on 10.7.1 Server I just cannot get Rails to work on my 10.7.1 Server installation.

Lots of threads on Apple.com support forums report the same issue, but without any working solution.\nWhat should I do? Should I bring it back to the shop? Should I try to take some steps to prevent the overheating?\n\nA: Because you have a base unit, your machine has an integrated GPU. So just looking at CPU cycles can be a red herring.\nYou can test this behaviour by turning on Cover Flow in iTunes and scrolling through your entire library for a minute or two. Since it is quite GPU intensive, after some time, your fans will ramp up to bring your chips temperature down. Bt if you consult your CPU usage, it will be quite minimal.\nIt could be the case (very likely) that Lion is working as intended. Lion introduced much more animations and graphically intensive processes, such as swipe animations when navigating websites using the trackpad, pop-up animations on dialogue boxes, swipe animations when sending mail, etc. Even moving or re-organizing icons in Finder now has an animation attached to it\nYou are certainly free to take into an Apple Store and talk to a Genius about your concerns, but I'm fairly certain they will test the unit and report that it is very much within \"spec.\"\n\nA: I've heard a few people complaining about heat problems with the new MBPs and Lion, why it's happening I have no idea as it seems to be different use cases for everyone, but there are two solutions. Solution one is take to an Apple store, tell them it's getting incredibly hot under low load and they'll either swap it or fix it, solution two is take it apart and see if there's anything wrong with the thermal paste.\nGoing out on a limb I'd say Lion is using the GPU for some specific tasks and it's causing issues, but I've not dug into it too deep. \n\nA: I have the same machine.  The only time I notice it really getting hot (and usually in the upper left corner, as you mention) is when I have it plugged in to charge the battery.  If I'm running on battery power, the outside of the case usually doesn't get too hot, even if the internal temperature increases enough to really kick on the fans.\n\nA: I have a Mac and I don't think I have this problem.

I get the same behavior from the built-in keyboard and mouse pad and wireless keyboard and magic mouse. \nRestarting doesn't usually help. Powering down and waiting 10 minutes usually makes the problem disappear for a few hours.\nI assumed it was an overheating problem and installed Fan Control. However, the last time I had the problem, the CPU temperature was only 54 degrees C and the case did not feel hot.\nI'd appreciate suggestions on how to diagnose this problem. \nThis is a company owned laptop and due to a \"frugal\" employer, I don't have AppleCare.\n\nA: The problem was the battery was expanding and pressing on the motherboard.

I'd like to wipe my hard drive clean and then install Lion on it (new) and would prefer not to wipe and install Snow Leopard and upgrade to Lion.\nRegarding the tutorials or detailed instructions on clean installing Lion - are there any that are (Most that I have searched online, including the one on Egg Freckles have been released [I]before[/I] the actual release date on Lion, and since I'm not that up to date on everything in the Mac world recently) detailed, and  I'd like to know if there is a comprehensive (new) tutorial regarding the clean installation of Lion?\n\nA: The best guide is all written up on Apple's support web site.\nA high level Introducing Lion Recovery covers the basics and the About Lion Recovery knowledge base article gets into the details.\nSome macs can use internet recovery to perform a one step / internet net boot / bare metal restore. All the rest require a [USB bootable recovery HD. Apple provides an official tool to make your own bootable USB device. Detailed instructions from About Lion Recovery Disk Assistant cover using an existing hard drive as well as a USB device to make your Recovery HD.\nOnce you are booted into recovery - use Disk Utility to erase / zero / repartition your drive and you now have a clean Lion install.\nThe following Mac models can perform a total internet recovery or use USB media.\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Air (Mid 2011) 13 inch and 11 inch\n\n*Mac Mini (Mid 2011) all models\n\nA: There are a couple relevant MacWorld articles that you may find useful, published shortly after the release of Lion, however you'll find there's nothing much different from the pre-release Egg Freckles article.\nMacWorld: Should you do a clean install of Lion?\nMacWorld: How to make a bootable Lion install disc or drive\nThe short answer is that yes, you can do an install of Lion on a wiped drive without installing Snow Leopard first. You'll need to make a boot drive of the Lion Installer on a USB stick or hard drive using your existing install. The other option is buying a Lion USB install drive from Apple, but you end up spending an extra $40 and it precludes you from installing from the App Store or Internet Recovery in the future.\nThe quick steps for making a bootable drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the Lion installer from the Mac App Store.\n\n*Right/command-click and click Show Package Contents\n\n*Find Contents/Shared Support/InstallESD.dmg\n\n*Use Disk Utility to \"restore\" the .dmg to a USB stick (must be partitioned as GUID Parition Table aka GPT, with a single HFS+ Journalled partition).\n\n\nYou can also use Disk Utility to burn the .dmg to a DVD if you prefer.\nIf you need more detailed instructions, check out the second MacWorld article above.\n", "Q: Two page continuous view in Lion Preview? Is there some way to get back the side-by-side page view from Snow Leopard with the continuous scrolling? From the View menu in Lion Preview, it appears they're mutually exclusive now. I can't help shake the idea that Lion was designed by someone without a desktop Mac.\n\nA: The free app Skim supports continuous-scroll side-by-side pages. To use that view, select the menu item PDF → PDF Display → Two Pages Continuous.\n\nAlso, if the left-hand page is wrongly displayed on the right side and vice versa, you can fix that by toggling Book Mode in the same menu.\n\nA: This is one of those things that really makes me wonder \"If it's not broken why fix it?\". \nOther than switching to another application that might give you back the lost functionality, I only have one suggestion at the moment. This is how I've been able to use Preview (5.5) and still get two page (side by side) continuous scrolling:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Open up your pdf, document, etc. in Preview.app\n  \n*File > Print or ⌘P\n  \n*In the Print Dialog Box click  Preview > Change to Layout [ 2 pages ]\n  \n*Lastly, click PDF > Open PDF in Preview.\n\nYou should now see your document layout as two pages and you can scroll continuously.

Can I stream any video played with VLC player to Apple TV ?\nAny additional plug-in for it...?\n\nA: It's not using VLC (although it uses some of its components and should be able to open anything VLC can open), but it looks like there's a way to do this. It requires on-the-fly transcoding for formats the AppleTV doesn't support (essentially anything not .mp4 or .m4v), which means it may take a fair bit of CPU power on your Mac, especially for HD stuff. It also means that aside from files the AppleTV natively supports, you're not getting bit-perfect renditions of the files, it's a lossy translation, but if you have a decently fast Mac, it should be pretty good.\nThe main tool you'll want is AirFlick. It's a pretty basic program that sends a URL to the AppleTV that tells it to open a stream from your computer. It also handles transcoding the non-native files. It's not very well documented; it looks like the latest versions use a built-in copy of ffmpeg for transcoding, but some of the resources around the web suggest that it may need VLC installed as well.\nUsage is pretty straight forward.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up AirFlick\n\n*Select your AppleTV from the drop-down in the upper-left\n\n*Drag the file you want to play onto the droplet, and hit play.\n\n\nIt should take around 30 seconds to buffer the transcoding, then start playing. It's definitely beta software, so YMMV.\n\nFrom what I can tell, the transcoding support is pretty simplistic. If you want to configure the transcoding process, you need to use custom VLC or ffmpeg command-line options and pass the output to AirFlick.\nThis guide from TUAW should give you a starting point for how to do that, but you'll want to consult other VLC or ffmpeg resources for specific configurations - it's beyond my expertise. The basic idea seems to be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use VLC or ffmpeg to transcode the source (in the example, that's dvdread:///dev/rdisk5@1:3-, replace that with the path to your file of choice) on-the-fly to an AppleTV compatible format\n\n*Pipe that output to mediastreamsegmenter which breaks the video into a streaming playlist the AppleTV can read\n\n*Host the streaming playlist on a webserver on your Mac\n\n*Use AirFlick to pass the URL of the playlist to your AppleTV\n\n\nA: I'm a Windows user and I'm streaming to Apple TV with Air Media Center. It is also compatible with Mac OS as well. You'll need an iOS device with the Air Media Center app instaled. The steps to stream are described as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the Air Media Center on your PC;\n\n*Open the Air Media Center app on your iOS device;\n\n*Select the file you want to stream and open it;\n\n*Click on the AirPlay symbol and it's done!\n\n\nThis solution requires all the devices to be under the same network.

If you have a movie file that doesn’t play well, we’d love to hear about it.\nWhy use Beamer and not Screen Mirroring?\nScreen Mirroring over AirPlay works great in general, but the video quality is a lot less reliable than when you are streaming a movie using Beamer (or iTunes for that matter). The video stutters every now and then. You may find this acceptable when watching a YouTube video, but it is very distracting when you are immersed in your favorite film or TV-series.\nBeamer offers smooth playback and consistent quality, because it builds a buffer of video to prevent stuttering.\nBeamer also enables playback control (pause, fast-forward, etc.) using the Apple TV remote and you can still use your Mac for other tasks while the movie is playing.\nCan Beamer play DVDs and DVD-rips?\nBeamer currently has no support for DVDs and DVD-rips. However, you can play the individual VOB files within the VIDEO_TS folder.\nAre subtitles supported?\nWe’ve added support for both embedded subtitles and subtitle files in version 1.5. Supported formats are: SSA/ASS, SubRip (SRT), SubViewer and MicroDVD. Your Apple TV software needs to be updated to version 5.1 or later for subtitles to work.\nIs surround sound supported?\nYes. Support for surround sound output was added in version 1.6.\nI don’t hear any sound (except a buzz or roar)?\nIf you play a file with a surround sound audio track, Beamer will offer the Apple TV a choice of playing either surround or stereo sound. Which choice the Apple TV makes is based on the setting ‘Dolby Digital’ (In the Settings app on Apple TV, go to ‘Audio & Video’)\nIf you don’t hear any sound or only a buzz, the Apple TV has picked the surround sound track. Make sure that your receiver is set to receive a Dolby Digital (AC-3) signal.\nAlternatively, if you don’t have a surround sound setup, set the ‘Dolby Digital’ option to ‘Off’.\nThe subtitles menu says ‘Automatic’ but I don’t see any subtitles?\nThe ‘Automatic’ settings means that Beamer will let the Apple TV determine if and in what language it needs subtitles. To make it work, take the following steps:\nSelect your default subtitle language from the Apple TV settings screen. Go to “Audio & Video” and select “Subtitle Language”.\nMake sure your subtitle tracks or files have a language code. For subtitle tracks this is usually already part of the metadata of the file, for external files you must put the language code after the name, before the file extension, e.g., movie-name.de.srt, for a German SRT file.\nIn the case of external files, make sure they have the same base name as the movie file. For example, for a movie called ‘movie-name.mkv’ its English subtitles file must be called ‘movie-name.en.srt’.\nIf you manually load an SRT file (e.g., by dragging it onto Beamer’s window), it will show the subtitles and ignore any language settings.\nCan Beamer send video to more than one Apple TV?\nYou can choose which Apple TV you want to use for video playback. It’s currently not possible to send video to more than one Apple TV simultaneously.\nDoes Beamer work with AirPlay receivers other than Apple TV?\nIt may work, but we don’t officially support it.\nCan I use my license for multiple Macs?\nYes, a license for Beamer is a personal license. You can use it on as many Macs as you (personally) own.\nWill I have to pay for upgrades?\nThe license is valid for all upgrades of version 1.x.\nCan I queue another movie file so it starts playing automatically after the current one ends?\nBeamer does not currently provide such a functionality, but the ability to create and run a playlist is on our roadmap.\nBeamer suddenly reports it cannot find my Apple TV. What’s wrong?\nWhen this happens, the Apple TV has trouble announcing itself on your local network. With some Wi-Fi routers his happens more often than with others. Try to restart your router, your Apple TV (unplug it and plug it back in) and your Mac’s Wi-Fi. For more information, please refer to this Apple Support article.\nApple TV just shows a spinning wheel when I start a movie. What’s wrong?\nApple TV fails to connect to your Mac to get the video stream. For most people, this is an issue with their firewall. You can check whether the OS X firewall is enabled: open System Preferences, select “Security & Privacy”, then “Firewall”.\nA movie plays, but stops to load sometimes. How can this be fixed?\nTry to restart your router and your Mac’s Wi-Fi. If that doesn’t help, the movie file may be too large to process fast enough on your Mac. We will keep improving compatibility in future updates.\nCan I play a movie with Beamer but let the sound come out of my Mac?\nYes, this is possible by virtue of a feature of the Apple TV and AirFoil Speakers by Rogue Amoeba.\nInstall and run AirFoil Speakers on your Mac\nSelect your Mac as AirPlay speaker via Settings > AirPlay on your AppleTV\nYou can also change the AirPlay speaker while playing a movie. Press the select button on your AppleTV remote until you see the menu. Here, you can also change the volume.\nCan I increase the size of the subtitle text?\nYes, this is supported through a feature of the Apple TV. Go to Settings > General > Accessibility > Style on the Apple TV. You can configure a wide range of styles and sizes.\nWhy is Beamer not in the Mac App Store?\nIt was turned down for using undocumented Apple technology. We use an undocumented way to communicate with the Apple TV over AirPlay. The same technology is used by Apple’s own apps, so it works well in practice.\nWill there be a Windows version of Beamer?\nWe have no plans to make a Windows version, but we won’t rule it out. There’s still a lot we want to improve in the Mac app.\nEmail us at support@beamer-app.com if you have any questions.\n", "Q: Inconspicuous microSD card adapter for MacBook Pro Does a microSD adapter exist that doesn't stick out of the MacBook Pro SD card slot?

After uploading photos to Flickr via the iPhoto \"share\" button, I find that iPhoto renames the photo titles to whatever I have in the description field. It'll then pass along those changes to Flickr. \nI like to change my titles to something short before uploading, but this overrides either my custom titles or the ones the camera assigns.  \nDoes anyone know how to turn this \"feature\" off? I'm using iPhoto 9.1.5 (that's iPhoto '11) under OSX 10.6.8. \n\n\nA: I don't think this can be turned off. Another effect this has is that if you delete a photo in iPhoto, it also gets removed from Flickr.\nTo avoid this, i use Flickr's free Uploadr rather than the built in tool. This lets you select the photos, give custom names, etc. It's easy to use, and if you make changes to the photos in iPhoto, there will be no effect on the images on Flickr. \n", "Q: Console + iMac 27\" 2011 External Display Can i use the iMac 27\" mid 2011 as an external display for, let's say, a Playstation 3?  \nIs this possible for the latest iMac?\n\nA: Three things need to align for a game console to send video out and have it be mirrored on an iMac.\nFirst, the iMac needs Target Display Mode.\nThe 2011 iMac and later run thunderbolt - so you need a legitimate thunderbolt video connection for Target Display Mode to work.\nThe older iMacs had Mini DisplayPort video out and video in, so you would simply need to get an inexpensive adapter to change HDMI to miniDP (note - most adapters go the other way - take a MiniDP signal and split out HDMI - this would need to function in the other direction.)\nI believe PS3 doesn't have native thunderbolt adapter or even a mini DP adapter, so you'd need additional hardware for Macs older than 2011 and I don't know of a box that takes HDMI and converts it into thunderbolt - so you might be out of luck on 2011 and newer iMacs.\n\nA: It is possible, but you'll need and adapter/converter to do it.\nYou can find a HDMI to Mini DisplayPort adapter on some sites, like this one, although it is a little expensive.\nOther models/types can be found here, for other input types, or Kanex's one.\nEditing: right now I'm reading the new iMac tech specs and it is clearly that it does not support input: Mini DisplayPort output with support for DVI, VGA, and dual-link DVI (adapters sold separately). Some users on forums are tolding that thunderbolt adapters are not ready and no one even know if it will be possible.\n\nA: You could use the Intensity Shuttle from Blackmagic Design to capture HDMI video to Thunderbolt, then use a program running in full screen on the iMac to display the incoming video stream.\n\nA: Besides using target display mode you can use say a elgato game capture, this will mirror your ps3 onto the iMac.\n", "Q: Can you add a specific link to IOS homescreen? I have a vbulletin forum I frequent in which I'd like to place a link to the \"new posts\" search on my homescreen.  Anyone familiar with vbulletin knows this is a url with search.php?do=getnew , once you access that URL it redirects you to a search ID which is cached for easy access later.  Thing is, you can't add that to your home screen as it wil just pull up the old search results rather than returning the newest posts.  I'd like to add a link to the new posts link on my homescreen but it seems there is no way to edit the homescreen links.\n\nA: Short answer: yes!\nI faced the same issue and basically tricked my iPad, you simply turn on airplane mode, you don't hit the redirect, you store the \"server not found\" page on the home screen and you are done :-)\nHope you can now resolve your 4 year old question.\n\nA: Yes - this works just fine for many web sites.\nFor example, these two links work very well when saved to the home screen on iOS.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=active\n\n*http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=newest\nEach will reuse an existing window and refresh the content to be sorted as specified (active versus newest) and they also work if you don't already have a \"tab\" open to this site on Mobile Safari.\nNot all websites will allow you to embed these codes, so you might have to shoot off an email to the webmaster asking if they have an URL that will set the proper cookies or yield the desired results. This is the sort of technical thing most web sites will provide for users with the smarts to take advantage of - even if they decide to hide that URL from most of the users that are browsing the site normally.\n\nA: Short answer: No!\nThere's only one possibility to add a website to homescreen: Tell the user to add it. It's also not possible to change the link for this.\nSo the user needs to navigate to your search.php and add this page to the homescreen. \nMaybe you could write a webapp with dashcode which creates a page for new posts..?\n\nA: I was also wondering how I could create a Safari icon on the home screen of my iPhone with the http://vbulletin-forum/thread-name-new-posts.html URL, which will take me to the latest page in a forum thread.  The problem is when you go to that URL in Safari, it will redirect you to a URL for a specific page in the thread (e.g. http://vbulletin-forum/thread-name-page-number.html).  If you try to add that to your home screen, you are adding the URL for that specific page, not the \"new posts\" URL.  There is no way to edit the URL for an icon already on the home screen.\nBut I found a free app called App Icons that lets you create a Safari icon with a URL and put it on your home screen.  After installing the app, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Touch \"Create Icon\"\n\n*Under \"Common Tasks\", touch \"Go to Link\"\n\n*In the \"TYPE URL\" field, paste or type in your desired URL\n\n*In the \"Go to Link\" field, type in a name for the icon\n\n*Touch \"Install\" and touch \"Install\" again\n\n*Touch the square icon with the up arrow\n\n*Touch \"Add to Home Screen\"\n\n*Touch \"Add\" and a Safari icon with your desired URL will be on your home screen\n\n", "Q: Does iOS have a transfer/write speed limit? Any time I want to do a batch transfer over FTP to my iPad (Using AVPlayer or Photo Privacy) the transfer only lasts for a short while before the application shuts down and I'm back to the iPad dashboard. Is this due to some internal security meassures in the iPad breaking any application that writes too much data? If not, what could it be that makes FTP servers on completely separate apps crash in the same way?\nAny answers even remotely helpful would be appreciated\nThanks\n\nEDIT\nI am of course running the application in the foreground. Also the iPad is not going to sleep. I simply start the FTP transfer, and after a few seconds or minutes the application abruptly quits and I'm back at the iOS dashboard.\n\nA: When any app quits abruptly and you are back at the springboard - that is a crash. iOS is designed to not make a big deal of crashes since most of the time they are temporary and starting up the program again will clean up the error. That doesn't appear to be happening in your case. \nYou can confirm it the next time you connect the device to iTunes or Xcode. Xcode let's you look into the engineering details as to why the program is crashing. \nITunes instead copies the crash report to your ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/MobileDevice folder. The first time this happens, you are asked if you want to send diagnostic information to apple. This sort of crash will then be sent in the future. \nYou can connect your device, right click on it in iTunes and reset all warnings to get the asking again - that way you can confirm that this is due to the program crashing and not some other cause. \n\nA: iOS will kill any process at any time when it's not in the foreground. It isn't as much a speed limit or any metering of the data as a rigidly enforced power usage control.\nYou need to keep tapping on the display to show you as the human in charge need the device to not to go to sleep. \n\nAre you keeping these apps running in the foreground? If not - you will have to contact the developer to see if they are using the background process calls to tell iOS not to kill them immediately. \nIf the developer is using the correct calls for these processes to keep going in the background - then it's up to you to not run other large programs that will cause iOS to kill off the background processes.\nYou can use the multitasking bar to \"force quit\" all the apps before you start the one you want to stay running under FTP - then leave it and start a second app. This is usually enough to not cause memory pressure and have iOS kill off the other FTP program while it's doing a short transfer. If you expect the transfer to go 3 to 5 minutes - you may have to baby sit that app - preventing another app from running and keeping the screen alive. iOS prefers to kill anything that would sap the battery - a long FTP process is exactly what iOS is designed to pause as quickly as possible.\n", "Q: Will @mac.com e-mail addresses continue to work after the MobileMe to iCloud transition? Will @mac.com (as from .Mac) e-mail addresses continue to work after the MobileMe to iCloud transition?\n\nA: Yes.\nYou will have to opt in to switch your account over, but it sounds like it will be fairly painless as long as you agree to all the new (unannounced as of yet) license terms. From the Apple FAQ on the MobileMe/iCloud transition:\n\nWill I be able to keep my MobileMe email address when I move to iCloud?\nYes. If you have an active MobileMe account when you sign up for iCloud, you’ll be able to keep your me.com or mac.com email address and move your MobileMe mail, contacts, and calendars, as well as your bookmarks, to the new service. When iCloud becomes available this fall, Apple will provide details and instructions on how to make the move.\n\nIf you do not opt in, you should expect your @mac.com and @me.com email to only work through June 30, 2012. \n\nA: Both my mac.com and me.com email addresses still work after my move to iCloud.\n", "Q: Is there a free hypervisor that runs on a Mac Mini? I need to run 4 instances of Mac OS X desktop (10.4 to 10.7) for our continuous integration setup (so they need to be on all the time). I've used PC hypervisors in the past (XenServer, ESXi, etc) but never for a Mac.\nIs it possible to run those guest operating systems on a Mac Mini hypervisor?\nEdit: Ideally, it should be managable remotely (like XenServer and ESXi), desktop virtualization software (like VirtualBox) isn't really what I had in mind.\n\nA: You might take a look at VirtualBox which includes a GNU GPL version as well. It offers limited/experimental capabilities to run virtualized OS X VMs, but I think Apple generally forbids virtualizing OS X via their licensing/usage terms.  \n\nA: There are licensing issues with the scheme that you propose. See this previous answer regarding the Mac OS X EULA, which will lead you to additional information. Summary: you can't do what you want as virtualization, as versions prior to 10.7 were not available for virtualization at all per their license.\nNeither VMWare or Parallels will talk publicly about circumventing the Apple EULA for pre-10.7 versions. VMWare Fusion actively prevents virtualizing the OS X client versions (there are one or more workarounds that I've seen; Google is your friend here).\nI know of no hypervisor software that will allow you to accomplish your goal, either. Sorry.\n\nA: You have confusion between PC and Mac, they are both x86/x64, they are the same as John Hodgman and Justin Long have demonstrated before.

So I'll try to do the screencapture when I can get a screen sharing session running at the same time.\nUpdate #2\nI tried doing the screencapture while another machine had a screen sharing session open on the same user account as the ssh session, no dice.\nHowever, interestingly enough I was in the same room as all the boxes in question and the target box made the \"shutter\" sound when I ran the screencapture remotely.\nLooks like it's not possible to screen grab on a displayless mac, without some serious additional work, I will VNC to it remotely instead.\n\nA: I'm not sure if this will work, but, it's worth a shot...\nWhat is you create an Automator script to take a screen capture, and then run that using the terminal?\nSimilar to what is described in this TUAW article, however, without the part that mails the screen capture to you.\n\nSave the Automator script as an application, SSH in, and run open /path/to/the/automator.app\n", "Q: Web Sharing Apache Localhost - Access permissions I want to install phpMyAdmin on the native Apache webserver that is bundled with Mac OS X 10.6. I turned on Web Sharing in System Preferences. Yet, me fear is that my computer is granting access to everyone on the web.\n\n\n*\n\n*Where are the user access restrictions for the Web Sharing / Apache webserver within Mac?\n\n*How to I restrict access for all computers except my own so that I can run applications on the localhost webserver (like phpMyAdmin).\n\nA: As has been pointed out already, unless you are specifically forwarding http traffic from your router to your machine, your locally hosted stuff will only be available to you and the other computers on your local network.\nTo answer your question on restricting access to your webserver to just your machine. You can do this a couple of ways.\nRemember, anytime you change apache configurations, you need to restart apache for those changes to take effect.\nMethod 1\nIf you want to limit everything on your local webserver to just your local machine, edit the file \"/etc/apache2/httpd.conf\". At approx line 195 you'll find a configuration block that looks similar to:\n<Directory \"/Library/WebServer/Documents\">\n    #\n    # Possible values for the Options directive are \"None\", \"All\",\n    # or any combination of:\n    #   Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews\n    #\n    # Note that \"MultiViews\" must be named *explicitly* --- \"Options All\"\n    # doesn't give it to you.\n    #\n    # The Options directive is both complicated and important.  Please see\n    # http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#options\n    # for more information.\n    #\n    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n\n    #\n    # AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.\n    # It can be \"All\", \"None\", or any combination of the keywords:\n    #   Options FileInfo AuthConfig Limit\n    #\n    AllowOverride None\n\n    #\n    # Controls who can get stuff from this server.\n    #\n    Order allow,deny\n    Allow from all\n\n</Directory>\n\nYou are going to want to comment out the bottom two lines of that block and add in new rules\nDeny from all\n\nand\nAllow from 127.0.0.1\n\nthat block should now look like:\n<Directory \"/Library/WebServer/Documents\">\n    #\n    # Possible values for the Options directive are \"None\", \"All\",\n    # or any combination of:\n    #   Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews\n    #\n    # Note that \"MultiViews\" must be named *explicitly* --- \"Options All\"\n    # doesn't give it to you.\n    #\n    # The Options directive is both complicated and important.  Please see\n    # http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#options\n    # for more information.\n    #\n    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n\n    #\n    # AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.\n    # It can be \"All\", \"None\", or any combination of the keywords:\n    #   Options FileInfo AuthConfig Limit\n    #\n    AllowOverride None\n\n    #\n    # Controls who can get stuff from this server.\n    #\n    #Order allow,deny\n    #Allow from all\n    Deny from all\n    Allow from 127.0.0.1\n\n</Directory>\n\nMethod 2\nYou can also use .htaccess files to limit who has access to a directory. In order for .htaccess files to work you first need to enable them. Open the same file I referenced in method 1 (/etc/apache2/httpd.conf) and go to the same configuration block I mentioned before (at approx line 195). You'll need to change (at approx line 215):\nAllowOverride None\n\nto\nAllowOverride All\n\nOnce you have done that you can create a file called .htaccess in any folder on your web server with the following information:\nDeny from all\nAllow from 127.0.0.1\n\nThat will prevent anyone besides your local machine from accessing the contents of that folder or any of it's subfolders.\nConclusion\nMethod 1 has the benefit of not having to worry about accidentally deleting .htaccess files or worrying about multiple configurations. Method 2 makes it very simple to only restrict access to certain directories of your webserver.\nAlso note that the .htaccess file must include that period at the beginning of the file name (it's .htaccess not htaccess) and that when you want to view your local webserver you have to do so by going to http://localhost (you can't use [your computer name].local).\n\nA: Rather than running the bundled Apache installation, which gives you limited or obscure configuration options, I suggest that you instead install the free MAMP (Macintosh, Apache, Mysql and PHP) package. It's better and more useful as a development environment, because it is designed as as a PHP development environment for Mac, and will save you much time and configuration problems. It's easy to install and (if needed) remove. MAMP's Apache portion is also more secure than the built-in Apache, in part because you can easily run it only when needed, and because by default it runs on port 8888, rather than the standard Web server port 80. The ports can be configured in the MAMP settings.\nFrom the MAMP FAQ (version numbers quoted in the FAQ may be slightly out of date, superseded by newer versions):\n\nWhy should I use MAMP? Isn't everything already installed in OS X?\nAt the moment, when using OS X, only Apache 1.3.x with PHP 4.3.2 is\n  pre-installed. PHP has to be activated by changing the configuration\n  files. The Apache/PHP versions provided by Apple are not always\n  up-to-date, and the Apache-PHP combination is quite slow. In addition,\n  MySQL has to be installed manually. With one click, and in just a few\n  minutes MAMP will install Apache 2, current PHP 4, current PHP 5 and\n  MySQL. Using the included eAccelerator, PHP-scripts are executed up to\n  ten times faster compared to Apple's pre-installed Apache/PHP. When\n  you use the MAMP programme, you can easily start and stop the server.\n  Thus, the server does not have to be running in the background all the\n  time, wasting precious resources. To \"uninstall\" MAMP, you only have\n  to delete the MAMP directory and everything returns to the original\n  state (MAMP does not alter anything on the \"normal\" OS X).\n\n\nA: You may also want to consider using https://serverfault.com/questions/211382/proper-way-to-disable-apache-listening-on-localhost\nIn short: change Listen 80 into Listen 127.0.0.1:80 in /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf\nI found that to be the easiest way.\nCheers!\n\nA: First of all, your webserver isn't shared with everyone on the web as long as your router doesn't forward your IP to your computer. This is a setting that isn't enabled by default so you probably are not sharing anything.\nAlso, you can secure your phpMyAdmin install with a password, just as it is done on many online installs (see config.php for options).\nAdditionally, if you do open up your webserver to the internet, you can limit access to phpMyAdmin by using .htaccess deny / allow settings.\n\nA: The by default installed version of httpd on MacOS Catalina has now a bit different syntax for allowing and denying access to Directories. \nIn my /etc/apache2/httpd.conf I have the following lines:\nDocumentRoot \"/Library/WebServer/Documents\"\n<Directory \"/Library/WebServer/Documents\">\n    #\n    # Possible values for the Options directive are \"None\", \"All\",\n    # or any combination of:\n    #   Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews\n    #\n    # Note that \"MultiViews\" must be named *explicitly* --- \"Options All\"\n    # doesn't give it to you.\n    #\n    # The Options directive is both complicated and important.  Please see\n    # http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#options\n    # for more information.\n    #\n    Options FollowSymLinks Multiviews\n    MultiviewsMatch Any\n\n    #\n    # AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.\n    # It can be \"All\", \"None\", or any combination of the keywords:\n    #   AllowOverride FileInfo AuthConfig Limit\n    #\n    AllowOverride None\n\n    #\n    # Controls who can get stuff from this server.\n    #\n    Require all granted\n</Directory>\n\nAccording to the httpd docs I had to comment out the Require all granted and to add Require ip  127.0.0.1 instead, to disable access from the local (or any other) network. And it works indeed. I can't now access the web server on my Macbook from my smartphone anymore. \nhttps://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_authz_core.html#require\nBut keep in mind, you have to place that rule inside any additional Directory you might add to the configs.\n", "Q: Selecting a default wi-fi connection I have multiple wifi connections in my campus (XYZ-Open, XYZ-Secure and XYZ-Guest) where XYZ-Secure is a secure connection and asks for authentication. Students use the secure connection which has a better bandwidth than the rest.\nThe issue is this: When my mac returns from a sleep mode or powers up, it chooses the XYZ-Open all the time by default and I need to manually switch to the secure connection each time. Is there an option to make XYZ-Secure the default connection which my mac should connect?\nThanks.\n\nA: You can change the preferred network simply by dragging it to the top of the list.\nLion: System Preferences -> Network -> Wi-Fi  -> Advanced\nOlder OS: System Preferences -> Network -> Airport  -> Advanced\n\n\nA: You should be able to \"forget\" the XYZ-Open network in order to never automatically connect to it again.\nWifi connections are connected to based off the strongest remembered one first, if I recall correctly.\nOpen your Network pane in System Preferences.\n\nClick Advanced there in the bottom right when the Wifi adapter is selected.\n\nThen click the XYZ-Open network and delete it, it should never be automatically joined again.\nSince it is an Open Network, there should be no concern in deleting it, as you can always simply rejoin it. What I don't know is how to select it, but doing so without remembering it. That's easy to do when you have to type in a password, but that dialog never appears on an Open network.\n", "Q: I interrupted a transfer with Migration Assistant (wirelessly)...am I in trouble? This is my first post...I was attempting to help a friend with my first-ever data transfer using Migration Assistant.  Before I was expecting it to start copying (I was expecting it to allow me to name a transfer file on the target location), the transfer started!  I suddenly panicked, thinking that all the data on my friend's target Mac might be overwritten!  There was no \"cancel\" button - so all I could do was shut the lids on both MacBooks.  At first, everything seemed fine. But when I tried to go back into the Power Saver panel to reset the energy saver on the target computer (instructions had told me to set it to \"never\"), it would not load the energy saver panel.  The sending computer seemed fine in every way.  All that was being transferred were files - no applications.\nDid something in the OS get corrupted in this interruption?  Thanks for any help!\nMike\n\nA: Unlikely. MA only transfer user files, apps, and any associated files those apps need to run (like Photoshop, which installs things into /Library, and not just your particular user's directory, although it does do that too).\nIf anything, the only thing you can break are the apps that are being migrated or fail to transfer some of your files (music, documents, etc.).\nThe Power Saver preference pane is located under /System/ and that is in no way modified by MA. Nothing under the \"/System\" directory is written to, and that is where the OS (and it's core files) are found (among other places, not openly visible to the end user).\nIt may be that the settings for Power Saver are corrupted (and those reside in the user's directory, specifically ~/Library/Preferences/).\nThe best solution, would be to boot using the recovery utility (or safe-mode) and delete the user's directory (e.g., /Users/{your username}) and start migration assistant again once you reboot normally (at which point OS X will take you through the registration process again). Obviously this would delete all the files from that user (music, movies, etc.) so make sure you have backups of everything.\nAlternatively, you can log into OS X, create a new administrator account (but don't use your regular naming convention, call it Jonny Appleseed/john, for example) using the System Preference's Users & Groups, log out, and log back in using that new account, and then delete your old administrator account, then recreate it using the same steps you did with the currently logged in account. Once that is done, log out and back in with your newly recreated account, and delete the extra administrator account. This will ensure your new account is set up using the same naming convention your original account was set to (making things easier for MA).\nRunning MA after that, should transfer all the files over again cleanly without having to worry about somethings getting overwritten or not overwritten.\nIt is also of note that MA just copies over files and doesn't move them. So all the source files are still there and once you delete the user directory, it'll be a total fresh start.\n", "Q: Pen drive does not show on mac on attaching but show error on removal? My problem is that when I attach my pen drive to any of the ports on my Mac, it won't show up on my Mac, but when I remove the pen drive, it shows the error, \"The disk was not ejected properly. If possible, always eject a disk before unplugging.\"\nThis means the Mac detects the pen drive on removal, but not on attaching.\nCan anybody tell me how I can fix this problem?\n\nA: If the drive is appearing in Disk Utility and shows up as being mounted, try this:\nIn the Finder, go to the Finder menu, then Finder Preferences, then General and be sure \"external disks\" is checked under \"Show these items on the desktop\". Then on the Sidebar screen and be sure \"external disks\" is checked under \"Show these items in the sidebar.\"\nThis should make the drive appear.\n", "Q: Can Lion be configured to use the three finger drag gesture anywhere in the window? With the proper gesture enabled, Lion allows using a three-finger drag to move a window. However, it only does this when the pointer is over the title bar; gesturing anywhere else in the window does a text highlight instead. Is there a hidden configuration or a hack that would allow three-finger window moving from anywhere inside the window's bounds? Thanks!\n\nA: Three-finger drag isn't a gesture for \"move the window\"; it's a gesture for \"click and drag.\" While there might (now or someday) be third-party software that could accomplish your desired behavior, it falls beyond the scope of a simple hidden preference.\n", "Q: Is it bad when my iMac is constantly on? Is it bad if I never shutdown my computer?\nI am asking solely terms of hardware so let's assume my software is stable and I reboot regularly to clean up software errors. \nIf running constantly is harmful, what can happen? (If not, why?)\nThe computer in question is an iMac (Mid 2011 - 27 inch) with a 3.4 GHz i7 processor. \n\nA: No, it's fine. The CPU's heatsink may warp over time (unlikely unless there were QA problems to begin with like some in the first generation MBP) and reduce the transfer of heat, leading to thermal thresholds being reached and the system shutting down.\nSome may claim excessive fan wear, leading to failure, but I ran the stock fans in my 2006 MBP at 6,000 rpm for over a year without problems—they are quite resilient and I suspect RPM throttling hurts them the most, not constant spinning.\nOther issues some might find distressing would be hard drive wear (again unlikely as heads are often parked if not in use).\nTruthfully, the only surefire downside would be the increase in power draw, but other than that, no, no ill effects or failure to hardware will occur.\n\nA: Modern macs are designed to run and properly cool and maintain themselves during constant use.\nWhen everything is working, you are keeping the air around the mac within spec, airflow is not obstructed, the temperature sensors will detect and monitor high heat generation if the software has everything going 100%. \nThe hard drive can be put to idle when it's not in use, the screen can dim and sleep, the fans will go to idle when the internal temperature is low enough.\nThere are many causes of failure - some are simple wearing out, but others are related to thhe start and stop. I have had machines that run in a server room for 5 to 8 years always on. By running all the time, you increase some modes of failure that whereas turning it on and off all the time causes other modes of failure to be more alike.\nTo be more specific, in the past, some generations of hard drives have had lifetimes in the tens of months (seagate, hitachi, IBM, WD all have had a bad crop or two but fixed it once they realized they had a design or manufacturing issue) and the displays (CRT and CCFL/fluorescent lit primarily) wear out due to use. The thermal stress of on/off temperature changes seems to hit CPU/GPU and power supplies harder than just letting them run.\nKeep in mind, your mac is priced and assembled from some of the best components and the lifespans of macs are statistically among the best in the industry. \nThese odds are very low of these failures in my opinion - we're talking one or two machines out of a hundred or more. Having had many repairs - treating the mac well with clean power and a cool room is all that matters to me.\nThere are great reasons to allow your mac to sleep by saving scarse energy, generating less heat, the reality that a monthly reboot or more is helpful to the many people that use a wide range of software (especially non server software - it takes great effort to ensure software is stable enough to run for months or a year at a time and to always clean up after itself properly). \nI look forward to reading other people's take on this. I feel it's a wash - the hardware benefits of controlling between aggressive sleep / off and always on are minuscule and not even statistically significant favoring one approach over the other.\n\nA: In addition to @cksum's excellent answer about hardware not really being affected adversely, I feel compelled to advise that, from a software standpoint, it does make perfect sense to reboot your Mac every once in a while. Doing so gives systems, processes, and the like a chance to start fresh, and reduces the chance of there being weird problems. Per my answer to a somewhat-related question, I reboot my Macs every Monday morning when I come into work. Beyond that, I only reboot when something fatally crashes with The Beachball Of Doom. I rarely have problems with the OS or the Mac itself since I started the weekly reboot. YMMV\n", "Q: How can I relocate an iTunes library from a Time Machine backup? I have used Setup Assistant from my last Time Capsule backup on my old iMac to start my new iMac. The new iMac has a 256 GB SSD and a 2 TB HDD. The old iMac had a nearly full 1 TB HDD.\nThis means when I used Setup Assistant I had to exclude from the list of things to copy, all of my Music and Movies folders as they wouldn't fit on the SSD.\nI have now been able to pull the Music/Movies off the old Time Machine backup and put them on the HDD, and all the system/app files are on the SSD. So that's all good up to now.\nBUT, all the guides I read about relocating iTunes from one HDD to another start with the library being in ~/Music and doing a 'consolidate'. In my case it isn't (and can't be due to space constraints) in ~/Music to start with. In fact, it's starting in the place I want it to be, HDD/Music\nSo my question is, how do I tell iTunes the library is now on the HDD, not in the default ~/Music location? \nIf I do the relocate in the iTunes Preferences > Advanced panel to the new location and then consolidate, I'm worried it'll overwrite the music that is already there, with the empty library in ~/Music.\n\nA: The preference in iTunes tells it where to read and write your files. It will not move the existing music library. You should set this to your HDD/Music, and you're done. Consolidate will then pick up the files you have left elsewhere (e.g. the now unblessed ~/Music) and copy them over for you.\n", "Q: Save and Restore Launchpad Layout? I've spent a lot of time arranging the apps the way I want them on my Mac and would like for them to stay that way. Is there anyway to save the current layout of Launchpad for a later restore if it gets all mixed up again? I already know about LaunchpadCleaner 2 but would rather not buy an AIR app.\n\nA: The database it uses (a simple sql database) is located in ~/Library/Application Support/Dock. That holds all your apps and their placement.\nYou could back up the file (or simply use TM) so that it can be restored at a later date.\n", "Q: Is there a GUI front-end to Apache for Mac OS X (Lion)? I am using the default Apache and PHP installs that are present in OS X Lion. But I would like to make some settings (like adding Virtual Hosts to Apache) using a GUI interface. Is there such a thing?\nI know of OS X Server of course, and also I think MAMP Pro has this. But I would like to keep using the stock servers and not install another version if I don't have to.\n\nA: There's no built-in GUI, but there are third party ones. One that I know of for managing virtual hosts is called VirtualHostX: http://clickontyler.com/virtualhostx/\n\nA: No, there is no GUI for the built-in apache. This is how I just set mine up so I can add my own VirtualHosts more easily:\nsudo -s\nmkdir /etc/apache2/vhosts\nchgrp admin /etc/apache2/vhosts\nchmod g+w /etc/apache2/vhosts\ncat << EOF >> /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf\n#\n# Load user-defined vhosts\n#\nInclude /private/etc/apache2/vhosts/*.conf\nEOF\n\nThis adds a vhosts directory under /etc/apache2/vhosts. You just need to turn on vhosts in the master /etc/apache2/httpd.conf file, and then it will look for all .conf files in that vhosts directory. I made it so as an admin user I have privileges to save in there.\nIt's a little tidier than trying to put everything in one file like the example vhosts in the config file.\n\nA: There's another GUI for built-in apache: WebMon for Mountain Lion. But this one is not as simple as VirtualHostX.\n", "Q: Apple Push Notifications SSL Error The APNS worked fine for various month until few weeks. Every time we send Push Notifications the connection aborts with the following error:\n\nPHP Warning:  fwrite(): SSL operation failed with code 1. OpenSSL Error messages:\n  error:1409F07F:SSL routines:SSL3_WRITE_PENDING:bad write retry\n\nIf I reconnect and resend or only resend the message to the Apple server I get the same error. Sometimes I can send to all devices without any problem. But sometimes it aborts at the 900th device, or at the 2000th device. It's not the I-have-not-collected-the-devices-from-Feedback-service-and-set-all-the-devices-to-inactive-Error. I'm connecting to the Feedback Service at regular intervals. It's another kind of error I don't know. Something has changed with the SSL connection. Can it be that Apple changed something with the SSL connection? Apple said it doesn't. And they doesn't support PHP.\nWe use PHP 5.3.3-7+squeeze3 with Suhosin-Patch (cli) (built: Jun 28 2011 08:24:40). This is the newest stable PHP version for Debian Linux Squeeze. This PHP version uses OpenSSL 0.9.8o (01 Jun 2010) on our server.\nPlease help.\n\nA: Had a similar problem in python, I guess the underlying ssl libraries are the same so the solution might be similar.\nSSL3_WRITE_PENDING seems to be caused when a socket write fails then you try to write again. In this case for whatever reason SSL_write requires you to retry the write with the exact same bytes as the original write or else it omits the SSL_WRITE_PENDING error.\nThe pattern of errors I was seeing was Connection Timeout, then lots of SSL_WRITE_PENDING errors. This was because first one of my writes failed (say with maybe a timeout error or connection closed error because I send a dodgy push request), then after that error I was continually trying to re-use the broken socket (and it was giving back the less-than-informative SSL_WRITE_PENDING error)\nAre you sure that you're using a new socket connection when you 'reconnect and resend'? Because I wouldn't have thought you should get SSL_WRITE_PENDING on a fresh socket connection to the APNS server.\nAnother thing that could help is using the enhanced notification format, because then if you accidentally send a broken push to the Apple server, it will send you an error code back before closing the connection on you. If you're not already using enhanced then it would be good to do so because then you can make sure you're not making simple errors like wrong token or payload too long things.\n", "Q: How can I exclude the display of specific pictures and videos in the Finder? I have some pictures and videos on my Mac (OS X Lion, OS X Snow Leopard) I'd rather have NOT show in Finder>Images. For example, if I'm in a meeting with clients and want to show some document, I have to fire up Finder and open said document, and when I click towards that, those pictures/movies show up and embarrass me. Think hmmm, strategic company workflows ahemf.\nIs it possible to tell Finder to NEVER show these?\n\nA: I am unsure if you are asking how to exclude folders from showing up in your finder spotlight search, or if what you are after is to hide specific folders from being shown in a finder window.\nIf you are after excluding folders from a spotlight search, you can do this in the privacy tab from system preferences / spotlight :\n\nIf you are after having the ability to show or hide files and folders from being viewed while you are in a finder window, then you can create an automator service to do just that :\nhints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20100719001040829\nNOTE : the tip above only toggles all files that have the hidden flag set, so if you need to quickly mark a folder or a file as \"hidden\", then you need to set this bit attribute for that file or folder.\nAn easy way to do this is via a free utility software download that does just this here (used to be shareware, but now free ) : gotoes.org/ShowHiddenFilesMacOSX/\nNOTE 2 :\nIf you are happy using the terminal command line, you can just type the following on the terminal :\nchflags hidden (drag your file or folder onto the terminal window here)\n\nor\nchflags nohidden (drag your file or folder here)\n\nHope this helps. \n\nA: If you have secure documents that you do not want to pop up in Finder » Images on a machine that might sometimes be facing others (in my case, diagrams for exam questions on the same machine I use connected to a projector in class), you could create an encrypted disk image using Disk Utility, and be sure not to store the password in the Keychain. When the disk image is mounted, you can search for and edit the secure files, but when the disk image is not mounted, the files will be safe from popping up in any searches, finder windows, etc.\n\nA: Another convenient way to exclude a folder (and its contents) from Spotlight results is to add \".noindex\" (without the quotes) to the end of the folder name.\n\nA: Re: don't show certain thumbnail previews in finder \nPutting a .noindex behind the folder's name, like notforyoutoseefolder.noindex did the trick for me in OS X Lion. \nOnce I had put that suffix the thumbnails of the movies (for instance) that you'd not want to be shown in Finder were in fact not shown anymore. \nIf only I had tried that before trying Daniel L's (smoothly working) method :) \n\nA: A simple way is to put those \"unmentionables\" in a separate folder and hide the folder.  You can move that \"special folder\" anywhere that you will remember, or you can searchmacupdate.com for a 3rd party app that will allow you to make it invisible/visible at will\n\nA: If you were messing with your roomies computer and you shouldnt have, change the date to 3 days back and re-open the pictures you watched.

I just noticed that when I hover with my cursor over a link, I don't get the url. I tried in maximized (full screen) and normal mode, and it doesn't show up in a popup or in a bottom bar as it does on Firefox. It's a bit annoying of course. I know about snowleopard's behavior, has Apple changed their stance or is still an external plugin the best solution?\n\nA: If you enable the status bar you can see the target URL without plugin. You might prefer the plugin still though.\nTo enable, go to the View menu and click \"Show Status Bar\".\n", "Q: What option should I give the sudo command to have the password asked through a graphical interface? This problem has ben bugging me for a while now.\nEvery now and then, I need to write a script file that should execute sudo commands. I do not necessarily know in advance that I will run as sudo so I am sure there is a way to open a nice graphical interface (such as the one popping up when installing software) but how ?\nThe man sudo says:\n-A          Normally, if sudo requires a password, it will read it from the current terminal.  If the -A (askpass) option is specified, a (possibly\n            graphical) helper program is executed to read the user's password and output the password to the standard output.  If the SUDO_ASKPASS\n            environment variable is set, it specifies the path to the helper program.  Otherwise, the value specified by the askpass option in\n            sudoers(5) is used\n\nSo I am pretty sure the solution resides in that -A and SUDO_ASKPASS tuple however I've managed to find what to put into those.\n\nA: OS X doesn't have an entirely clean way to do this, but there are a few ways to fake it.  First, AppleScript has a good way to do sudo-ish things based on a graphical authentication, and you can use that: \nosascript -e \"do shell script \\\"stufftorunasroot\\\" with administrator privileges\"\n\nYou can also use that mechanism to set the sudo timestamp, and then use the regular sudo (within the 5-minute timeout window) to do things:\nosascript -e \"do shell script \\\"mkdir -p /var/db/sudo/$USER; touch /var/db/sudo/$USER\\\" with administrator privileges\" && \\\n    sudo stufftorunasroot\n\nFinally, you can use AppleScript to prompt for a password, then pass that to sudo:\npw=\"$(osascript -e 'Tell application \"System Events\" to display dialog \"Password:\" default answer \"\" with hidden answer' -e 'text returned of result' 2>/dev/null)\" && /\n    echo \"$pw\" | sudo -S stufftorunasroot\n\n\nA: OS X doesn't come with a graphical front-end for sudo but you'll find cocoasudo or macsudo helpful.\n", "Q: OSX Second monitor/display background Is it possible to change the display default image on a second display connected to an Apple running OSX 10.6. ?

It works fine with every rectangular selection, but if you take a square shot (for example 150x150 or 280x280...) it captures 1 pixel in excess only in width: so, a 150x150 will eventually become a 151x150, forcing me to crop it.\nI was wondering if it's just me or if it's a known bug.\n\nA: I tried it in Lion 10.7.1 and can't confirm that issue.

However, after running the command, this is the output that I get:\nReading Driver Descriptor Map (DDM : 0)… Reading Apple\n(Apple_partition_map : 1)… Reading Ubuntu-Server 10.04 LTS ppc     \n(Apple_ISO : 2)… Reading Ubuntu-Server 10.04 LTS ppc (Apple_HFS : 3)…\n...................................................................................\nUsage:  hdiutil convert -format <format> -o <outfile> [options] <image>\n    hdiutil convert -help\n\nThen it returns to the command line. When I check the supposed location of the img file, it doesn't exist.\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Am I running the right command?\n\n*If I am running the right command, where is the img file?\n\n\n\nOn further examination I noticed the appropriate file is created when I run the command—but as soon as the \"Reading Ubuntu-Server 10.04 LTS ppc (Apple_HFS : 3)\" process finishes, the file gets deleted.\n\nA: Whenever a command line tool outputs it's Usage help text it means it couldn't parse your parameters. In this case you got the order of the arguments wrong, which can easily be gleaned from the man page (man hdiutil): convert image -format format -o outfile\nIn your case that'd be:\nhdiutil convert ~/path/to/ubuntu.iso -format UDRW -o ~/path/to/target.img \n\n\nA: Could you post the complete command line you used? I assume you didn't really enter\nhdiutil convert -format UDRW -o ~/path/to/target.img ~/path/to/ubuntu.iso\n\nsince that is only an example and you replaced the '/path/to/...' with the paths and filenames of your downloaded Ubuntu image and your desired output filename.\nIf the paths to the input and output file include any spaces you have to put them in quotes. Otherwise hditutil treats the parts seperated by spaces as different arguments:\nE.g. :\nhdiutil convert -format UDR -o \"~/CD Images/my-ubuntu.iso\" \"~/Downloaded Files/ubuntu.iso\"\n\n", "Q: Does installing rEFIt void my warranty? I would like to install rEFIt. Will it void my warranty, even though it can be uninstalled?\n\nA: No, rEFIt is software and therefore should not affect the hardware warranty.\nHowever, if you're concerned about that and want to avoid trouble (there's always the odd thickheaded customer service rep, even at Apple), you can simply wipe your drive and do a clean OS X reinstall before you send your machine in for service (and restore from backup once you get it back). rEFIt does not modify your EFI or anything else, so there'll be no trace left of it if you do so.\n\nA: I have a user with a rMBP that was told by the GeniusBar that his warranty was voided by using rEFIt to install Linux. Trouble is, the system never had Linux on it, only a BootCamp partition which has since been removed. \nThey said removing the \"unauthorized software\" would reinstate the warranty. \nRun the following two lines and reboot to remove rEFIt.\nsudo rm -r /efi\nsudo rm -r /Library/StartupItems/rEFItBlesser\n\n", "Q: Randomly order menu-bar-lets? I know it is impossibly to manage the order for the applets in the menubar (those which aren't apple's own). Yet is there an application or trick that enables this?\nEg. I have a calendar barlet that I would like to put to the left of apple's clock, and then apple's battery indicator, etc... \n\nA: There's no officially supported way to do this - the API that allows for them to be re-arragned is private. Some third party apps take advantage of this, some just use the officially provided status menu item API, which do not allow re-arranging. I know of at least one app that doesn't support re-arranging natively, but allows you to download a menu item which can be moved (Fantastical, by the way. Their FAQ has a link to the menu item).\nIn short, it's a mixed bag.\nWhat I've used as a workaround is creating an automator action that launches all the apps with status items in the order I want. So, the first app to launch puts its item all the way on the right, and the subsequent apps add them to the left, in order. Then, I save this workflow as an application and add that to my login items. This doesn't allow you to mix/match official/non-official apps, but it works well enough for me.\n", "Q: How do I prevent Lion Mail from marking a message as read after deleting/archiving another message? This is driving me nuts. I go through my mail in reverse chronological order. This means I look at the newest mails first and then go back from there. So this scenario happens dozens of times a day:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check out message, decide to mark it as unread to review/act on later\n\n*Proceed to next, older, message\n\n*When I decide to delete/archive the current message, Mail will highlight the message from 1. and mark it as read (because it is selected)\n\n*This forces me to REmark this last message as unread before proceeding\n\n\nAny ideas on how to solve this?\n\nA: Press ⌥+backspace to delete the message. No other message will be highlighted.\nWarning: This deletes the selected message(s) permanently.\n\nA: There's a plugin for Apple Mail called TruePreview (freeware, http://christianserving.org/project/truepreview) which let you define when a message should be marked as read. \nE.g I have set it to seven seconds so when I go through my messages (I do it the same way as you) they still are marked as unread. I have to stay on a message for seven seconds to be marked as read.\nYou can configure that behavior on a per account basis.\nThe plugin for Lion Mail is an alpha relase (please read the release notes)\n\nA: What works for me is to collapse the message preview section of the window, which requires clicking on a message index to open the message in a new window.  In SnowLeopard, drag the divider below the message index to the bottom of the window; in Lion, drag the divider on the right side of the message index to the right of the window.\nWhen using Mail like this, it won't mark a message as read until you open the message in a separate window.  So, when the selection moves around the message index, it won't automatically preview the message and mark it as read.\n", "Q: How do I mount a sparsebundle to a folder rather than an image? I have a encrypted sparsebundle and I want to mount to to a folder in my home directory and not under /Volumes. How can I do that?\n\nA: You might also be interested in http://blog.marc-seeger.de/2011/02/06/encrypted-diskimages-in-osx/ which explains step by step how to set up auto-mount to the specified mount point:\n\n\n*\n\n*run mount to identify the disk device (/dev/diskNsN usually)\n\n*run diskutil info /dev/diskNsn | grep UUID to get the UUID\n\n*use sudo vifs to add a line to /etc/fstab\nUUID=whatever-you-noted-before /path/to/mountpoint hfs rw 1 0\n\n\n*Add your disk image to your login items to have it automatically mounted on /path/to/mountpoint at the next login\n\nA: hdiutil attach /Volumes/ATimeMachine/Pictures/iPhoto\\ Library.sparsebundle -mountpoint ~/iPho\n\nIf this command is successful you should see something like:\n/dev/disk3              Apple_partition_scheme          \n/dev/disk3s1            Apple_partition_map             \n/dev/disk3s2            Apple_Driver43                  \n/dev/disk3s3            Apple_Driver43                  \n/dev/disk3s4            Apple_Driver_ATA                \n/dev/disk3s5            Apple_Driver_ATA                \n/dev/disk3s6            Apple_FWDriver                  \n/dev/disk3s7            Apple_Driver_IOKit              \n/dev/disk3s8            Apple_Patches                   \n/dev/disk3s9            Apple_HFS                       /Users/me/iPho\n\nwhere iPhoto Library.sparsebundle is on a DroboFS (NAS) and is a 500G \"hard disk\" image formatted MacOS HFS journaled\nRunning the hdiutil command mounts the image under my home directory. I tired to mount it on top of the original iPhoto Library, but the original was still visible in there after mounting, so I changed the name of the mount point to iPho instead. Then I decided it didn't really matter where the mount point was, it would be fine under /Volumes as long as iPhoto.app knows where it is.\nOption click iPhoto.app to launch it with a prompt to create a new library, and I did that in the mounted disk image. Then import all photos (previously managed with Picasa under a ~/Pictures directory tree) on my hard drive into iPhoto, which copies them into the mounted image, which resides on the NAS where it has some fault tolerance because of the DroboFS. This also frees up half the space on my small 500G SSD drive in the MacBook Air.\n\nA: The hdiutil command-line utility gives you more flexibility, and is extensively documented in man hdiutil. Something like this should do:\nhdiutil attach -mountpoint ~/myMountPoint mySparsebundle.dmg\n\n\nA: Just wanted to point out the -mountroot option:\nhdiutil attach -mountroot ~ path/to/image.sparsebundle\n\nIn this case, it would be mounted to ~/image.\nAlso note that with the -mountroot option, if ~/image already exists, it would automatically append the mountpoint and instead mount the volume to, for example, ~/image\\ 2.\nA word of caution: be sure you do not confuse the -mountroot option with with the -mountpoint option. This would cause the volume to be mounted in place of your home directory!\n", "Q: Does a Magic Trackpad have a button? Does a Magic Trackpad have a button, as opposed to just being a trackpad? I am not sure if this even makes sense, so let me know if I need to clarify.\n\nA: It doesn't have a \"button\" in the traditional sense, but clicking is supported in two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pressing down anywhere on the trackpad engages a click mechanism in the base.\n\n*Lightly tapping on the trackpad registers a click.\n\n\nA: Yes, it has two physical buttons on the edge lacking the battery tray. The two rubber feet on the bottom-front of the trackpad press against  internal switches.\nFor these to activate, you have to use it on a hard surface. The software tap-to-click that senses your finger pad deforming as it taps the immovable glass surface also will trigger a tap independently from the physical buttons. \n\nA: Yes.  But sort of hidden.  If you reach under the trackpad, the feet on the bottom front act as a single button when pressed.  \nIf you justs press the entire trackpad down on a hard surface to activate these buttons on the bottom.  But, if you are holding the trackpad in the air, squeezing one of the bottom feet directly will also work.\n", "Q: How do I remove a dmg from a bootable USB flash drive? I created a bootable flash drive using the instructions on Ubuntu's website using OS X 10.6, but it was for the wrong version of Ubuntu. Now, I want to remove the dmg from the flash drive, but diskutil isn't letting me remove it.\n\nA: Open the USB drive in Finder and delete the contents that way. Then empty the Trash before ejecting the USB drive.\n", "Q: trying to run Apache James (email server) on Mac -- getting \"Permission denied\" error -- help? I download Apache James email server on my Mac.  I extracted the zip to a \"james-2.3.2\" folder.  When I run \"./james-2.3.2/bin/run.sh\" I get a \"Permission denied\".\nI tried doing a chmod 755 on the run.sh but it still gives me an error (something about permission denied regarding a phoenix .sh file).\nI expect I'm doing something fundamentally wrong.  Any help is appreciated!\nrob\n\nA: You have to set chmod 755 for all the *.sh files in this directory. For that you could run\nfind ./james-2.3.2 -type f -name '*\\.sh' -exec chmod +x {} \\;\n\nThis command will look for files which end with .sh and sets the executable bit (okey, there are only two, the run.sh and phoenix.sh)\nBut you still have to set JAVA_HOME otherwise james will complain. And you have to run it as 'root' user since it the application will listen to a port < 1024. For me the following let me run james:\nsudo JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/Home ./james-2.3.2/bin/run.sh\n\n", "Q: Is there an app that can set time limits for Internet access? Is there an app that I can run on my iMac that will regulate Internet usage?\nSpecifically, I want to only allow internet to work between 6-8pm.\n\nA: Don't overlook \"the parent app\".\nIt turns on the logging of safari using parental controls. Sets the normal time limits when the mac can be on and off.\nThen it communicates to the children \"the rules\" and what happens when the parent determines that they have been broken. Why spend money or time on a more controlling solution if you can ensure they don't cover their tracks and will be caught if they stray.\n\nTechnically, managing this on the router is easier than on the Mac using the default Apple tools. \nApple has implemented timed access across the airport line, so fire up Airport Utility and set the times when you want access to the Internet. \nYou can set up default timed rules as well as specific policies for specific devices. \nIf you really want things to be controlled locally on the OS, turn on time limits under Parental Control under system preferences for each user account:\n\nAnd then prevent apps that you don't explicitly want them to use.\n\nI believe Firefox (if installed) defaults to on - so do review each and every app in the list. Your children can come to you as the administrator and you can over-rule these restrictions with your password - so this is the unattended default situation and you can grant them extra leeway with your password when needed.\n\nA: A simple lamp timer on your modem, router or access point device would be a low tech solution for a given fixed location.  No scripting expertise required.  Put tamper-proof tape on the jacks and plugs if you want to check for cheating.  If you only want to affect one iMac, put a separate router on its ethernet cable and/or use a separate dedicated WiFi access point, and plug that into the lamp timer.\n\nA: If the goal is to block time-wasting \"junk food for the mind\" websites, I can recommend the WasteNoTime plugin for Safari or Chrome.\nOther than that, even the cheapest Linksys router will support Access Restrictions whereby you can set up a schedule that would allow internet only between 6 and 8pm.\nWasteNoTime will optionally let you specify a number of minutes per domain that you're willing to budget. So, if you don't want to spend more than 30 minutes per day at TVTropes.com for example, WasteNoTime will block that domain after the 30th minute. I've used it to block a couple of sites, and my productivity is improving!\n\nA: If you own an AirPort Extreme, you can control access to the Internet via AirPort Utility.\nNote that this only applies to wireless connections. Anything plugged directly into the AirPort Express will not be limited by this restriction.\n\nA: The Parental controls panel in System Preferences will allow you to limit access to the Internet.\n\nA: SonicWall\nIf you want to control and restrict access for your entire company or LAN, the SonicWall line of firewall stand-alone hardware products provides a tremendous amount of granular control of everything having to do with Internet access, based on time of day, destinations, protocols, you name it. They have a full range of products from small-business to enterprise-level.\n", "Q: How can I see traffic from shared Wifi (Macbook AirPort)? I want to see a log.  Something like: 192.168.0.23 www.example.url 13:34 19 april 2011\n\nA: tcpdump is a command-line utility to see the traffic on any network interface.  It is full-featured, but can require some serious reading of the man page.\nWireshark is a full-featured application that will allow you to see all such traffic.  It provides a GUI (X-windows based) into which you can specify filters on traffic and collect statistics.  See more info and download it at wireshark.org.  I find knowledge of Wireshark to be very, very helpful with lots of network tasks.\n\nA: Debookee will do the job for the following protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, TCP, DHCP, SIP ...\nThere's also a scanner included that can show you all the devices on your network.\nBut the best to me is the interceptor tool that allows you to see the traffic of any device (mobile, tablet, other Mac or PC) on your network, like Cain & Abel for Windows.\n", "Q: How do you switch between built-in audio and headphone audio without unplugging? Once I plug headphones into my iMac I no longer have the option in the sound preferences panel to output audio to the built-in speakers. I have to unplug the headphones to get audio output through the built-in speakers. Since the plug is on the back of the display this is inconvenient. Does anyone know of an audio app that allows me to easily switch between built-in speakers and headphones for audio output?\n\nA: I think the condition has always been there.  I believe plugging into the headphone jack physically disconnects the sound output from the speakers.  I believe you will have to use bmike's suggestion to get the desired outcome.\n", "Q: Recommendations for USB 3 ExpressCard/34 There is a proliferation of portable and cheap portable USB 3 drives nowadays and nothing of the sort for Thunderbolt.\nI was wondering if it is worth my while getting an ExpressCard/34 USB 3 card for my 17\" Macbook Pro, to tide me over until some reasonably priced Thunderbolt drives come out.  \nI did a quick search and found a few drawbacks of the ExpressCard/34 USB 3 solution.\n\n\n*\n\n*It appears you need an external power supply according to this article http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=5985&review=aluratek+usb+3+expresscard+adapter\nCan anyone confirm this? That would be a pain, since I want to use portable drives, avoiding separate power supplies.\n\n*Performance is not as good using USB 3 through ExpressCard (although it is much better than USB 2, so this is not so much of a problem).\n\n*The need for drivers. Lacie provides one. http://www.lacie.com/au/more/index.htm?id=10112\n\n*Ugly (I'll forgive this one, since this is a temporary solution until Thunderbolt drives arrive).\n\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with a USB 3 ExpressCard?\nCan you recommend one?\nMy biggest blocking point is the need for an external power supply. Is there any card that doesn't require external power for USB 3.0 speeds? (Lacie don't mention this on their website as far as I can see).\nPlease don't answer with suggestions about Firewire. I currently have several Firewire 800 drives. This question is specifically about ExpressCard/34 USB 3.\n\nA: *\n\n*You'll need a power supply.\n\n*The express card slot has a gross transfer speed of 2.5Gbit/s.\n\n*3rd party hardware kernel extensions (drivers) are horrible (expect kernel panics and maybe even data loss).\n\n*The LaCie adapter will only work with LaCie drives. Use of any other drive will cause a crash.\n\n\nIt's simply not worth it.\n\nA: A) Consider eSATA instead of USB 3.0 if you just want storage.\nB) Most expresscard eSATA solutions reuse USB->eSATA bridges, creating a new bottleneck.  This is the major reason people complain about expresscard solutions in the first place.  Look for a true expresscard eSATA adapter.  The first indicator will be the price.  < USD40 is usually junk, > USD75 tend to be good.  I like the Sonnet cards: http://www.sonnettech.com/product/computercards/index.html#sataec34\n\nA: Since OSX Mountain Lion brings in native USB3.0 support, did any one try the seagate USB 3.0 upgrade cable package with express card adapter?\nAccording to seagate KB (http://knowledge.seagate.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/217951en#13) ,\nThe Express card Adapter would provide USB 2.0 speeds in OSX as there was no USB 3.0 support, but since now we have USB 3.0 support does the adapter work and give better speeds than before . \nI know the limitations of Express card bandwidth, and that it cannot give full USB 3.0 speeds for PCI based express card but a USB 3.0 support means a definitely higher speed for my 1TB seagate GoFlex Freeagent HDD. eSATA does not work for my HDD sadly, but this hardware might work now that some drivers are available from Apple.\nUpdate :\n@Jason S\nGuys I finally got a working USB 3.0 Express card based on ASM 1042 Controller for OSX and it works great with 1TB Seagate Goflex USB 3.0.\nRead my review of the same here - http://blog.indiandragon.in/2012/12/review-asmedia-1042-cheap-usb-30.html\n", "Q: Is there a QuickLook preview for plain-text files with unknown extensions? A similar question was asked here but the answer refers to something called QL Stephen, which only claims to preview files with no extension.  I need something that will show previews of files with extensions that are unknown to the Finder.  They are all plain-text files.  And, it needs to run on Lion (10.7).\nTo clarify: I'm not looking for a default QL for any unknown extension, but rather for one that will preview certain specific extensions (e.g., .sps, .fort) as plain text.\n\nA: You can use QuicklookStephen (https://github.com/whomwah/qlstephen).\nInstall via Brew:\nbrew install qlstephen\n\nand then reset the Quicklook plugins:\nqlmanage -r && killall Finder\n\nand you should be good to go!\nTested with both files without extension and files with \"unknown\" extension (e.g. .nfo)\n\nA: After a quick google, maybe this is what you need?\nhttp://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20071028184428583\nIt explains how to declare specific file types as plain text, QuickLook will use these declarations.\n", "Q: Is there a way to make QuickLook display a hex dump preview of files for which no other preview is defined? This question has two parts, I suppose.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to assign a default case to QuickLook (if no other preview applies, use this one) and\n\n*is there a good hex-dump QuickLook preview?\n\nA: I think you would need two things in order to make this work.\n 1.  You would need a hex editor that was tied into whatever black magic Apple is using to provide QuickLook.\n 2.  You would probably need to set hex editor as the default application for handling the specific file type...   \nIn short... no, I don't think you can do it out of the box.\n", "Q: How to make Finder show icon thumbnail for some Excel documents? I have two Microsoft Excel documents that are, except for the data contained within, virtually identical. One was created as an offshoot of the other.

That didn't work.\n\n*Checking Get Info on both and the only anomaly I see is that the offshoot is a larger file, despite containing fewer tabs and less data.\n\n\nHow to make the Finder show the icon thumbnail for all Excel documents?\n\nA: The document filename doesn't matter as much as its extension. Usually .xls or .xlsx will preview OK where comma separated values, tab delimited documents, or something other \"spreadsheet\" format, which are really just text files rendered in Excel or Numbers, may not preview the way you expect in the Finder.\n\nA: open Finder, locate the file and drag it to the sidebar\n", "Q: Calendar from Google Calendar not syncing to the iPad My iPad is really starting to infuriate me.

My new MacBook Pro uses Thunderbolt to connect a monitor. My monitors have all HDMI or VGA plugs. So I was looking for an Thunderbolt to HDMI adapter in my favorite shop. But I can't really find one. Am I missing something?\n\nA: Yes - you might be overlooking that all the Display Port adapters work perfectly well with Thunderbolt macs. \nJust place it at the end of the chain. It's not an issue since your VGA or HDMI device isn't going to have another Thunderbolt port in the chain to send the data further. You are necessarily connecting at the end of the line.\nThe Moshi is my favorite, but any of the Apple ones VGA, DVI are fine choices as well. You should find many \"equivalents\" from other vendors as well once you realize you can skip the Thunderbolt part for now.\n\nA: One thing to keep in mind is that you need a Mini DisplayPort-to-HDMI adapter plus an HDMI cable. Some retailers are still selling Mini DisplayPort-to-HDMI cables (Mini DisplayPort on one end, HDMI on the other), but these do not work with OS X Lion (I found this out the hard way).\n\nA: I'd recommend that if your favourite store doesn't have what you want that you use Google Shopping to search for a reputable store (one with lots of positive reviews) that stocks what you're after.\n", "Q: Iphone 3G is very slow when launch apps that use GPS I have a iPhone 3G is very slow when launching apps that use GPS, like Google Maps or similar. The phone becomes unusable until I restart the OS.\nOne trick that seems to work occasionally is to deactivate the push notifications and then I can use the Google Maps without problems. Other days it also doesn't work and simply freezes.\nHow can I fix this?\nMy iPhone 3G is a 16GB article, running iOS 4.2.1, it is not jailbroken.\n\nA: Well I used to have an iPhone 3G and when I upgraded it to iOS 3 it was painfully slow. So what I did was this: \n1) Switch off spotlight search (Or some elements of it) - Settings -> General -> Spotlight Search. \n2) Reduce the amount of mail accounts being fetched to only the ones I needed to be fetched. \n3) Try and keep minimal tabs open in Safari i.e. Don't leave all 8 open, keep closing them once you're finished. \n4) Reset network settings at least once a month - i've found this also helps when you have no service, it just comes back instantly for me sometimes.\n5) Try to use applications that are less resource intensive. This means stay clear of things like Infinity Blade. \n6) Try to minimize how many calendars, contacts etc you have syncing. \n7) Upgrade to iPhone 3GS/4/4S - they are all faster, the iPhone 3G has a slow processor.\nI hope this helps. This really helped me speed my iPhone 3G and make certain applications usable a few years ago. \n\nA: My assumption here is that when the GPS-enabled application initializes the GPS, it does not proceed until the GPS receives a \"fix\" (signal from 3 or more satellites).\nHaving never owned an iPhone 3G, I'm not sure what an appropriate amount of time for this to proceed is.  What you're experiencing may be normal.\n\nA: The first thing I would try is completely shutting down your iPhone by holding the button on the top right end down until you see the slider bar, and then slide it.  Now turn it back on (same button).\nThis is the same as restarting your Mac, in that it cleans up the system a bit and reloads the OS (in this case, the iOS).\nMy wife has a 3g iPhone and I have the 4G.  This shutdown-restart does cure some ills.\nNow you can re-try your process to see if the problem is cured.\nYou may have to connect to iTunes, backup, then Restore.  Read the iTunes Help menu to learn more about Restore.\n\nA: *\n\n*don't forget to do a hard reset.\nsimply hold both the home button & the power button (top right) for about 7 seconds - (continue holding both buttons until the slider comes up * keep holding both until the screen goes black) - if done right the phone will do a clean reboot.\n\n*go to 'settings' then to 'location services' then turn off the location services for all the apps that are not high priority\n\n*dont forget to quit apps that are not in use & do steps 1-7 from tushar747\n", "Q: An error occurred when configuring keychain syncing I'm using MobileMe to sync my keychain between an iMac and a MacBook Air. Since both machines run Lion this error message pops up every other system start (or when waking up from sleep):\n\"An error occurred when configuring keychain syncing.\" \nI have already reset the keychain on MobileMe and on both machines but the error message keeps coming.\nIs there anything else I can do?\n\nA: No solution yet, looks like an OSX Lion issue...\n", "Q: Is there a way to automatically sync iTunes to my music folder (which is on a different hd)? I'd like iTunes to automatically add any music that I add to my music folder to its library. I don't want to have my music on the same hard-drive as Itunes, though, so I can't just copy it into any of the Itunes music folders. Is there a way to do this? \n\nA: No, iTunes will not \"listen\" for music in a given folder (like the popular BT program Transmission, which will load torrent files once they've been downloaded to a given directory).\nYou have to manually add music by dragging it in the iTunes window or going through the file menu (CMD + O).\nHowever, you could achieve what you are after perhaps with some voodoo in Apple Script. Or simply sort the contents of your music folder by \"date added\" (provided you are using Lion) and manually add the songs as they arrive.\nBut then if you are going through all this trouble of manually managing files, you may wish to ask yourself, \"why\"? It might be less of a burden to just let iTunes do its thing (like it was mentioned before, you can tell iTunes to copy the music anywhere you like, on any drive connected to your system, even on a network) than micro-manage a bunch of files.\n\nA: Whatever you do don't use the Automatically Add to iTunes folder.\nThis will destroy any system you have for arranging and naming your files.  I had all my files in one folder named \"Artist - Album - Song Name\" now they are all Artist Folder/Album Folder/\"Track Number  Song Name\".  I wanted to use the automatically add folder not the organize files feature, but apparently you cannot add files without organizing them.\n\nA: I think the easiest way would to be manually manage your iTunes library yourself.  Under Advanced in iTunes preferences, uncheck \"Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to library\".\nThis will add reference to the tracks to iTunes without copying them to the iTunes library.\n\nA: This apple support file will guide through the steps required to transfer your media file to an external disk or any other location. There is also a link in the article you should follow if you are running itunes on windows\nTo populate iTunes with media on an external disk etc. just alt + drag your media folder into the iTunes window. This will make a reference to your files\n\nA: One way is to add all the files to an playlist automatically. You just need to run the following apple script (probably change the values in the first two lines)\nCreate a new script file in AppleScript Editor:\n\nset music_folder to \"/Users/username/Music/SyncedMusic\"\nset music_list to \"SyncedMusic\"\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set music_folder to (POSIX file music_folder) as string\n    get music_folder\nend tell\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    activate\n    delete (every user playlist whose name is music_list)\n    set newPlaylist to (make new user playlist with properties {name:music_list})\n    set view of browser window 1 to newPlaylist\n    set newPlaylistName to name of newPlaylist\n    add music_folder to playlist newPlaylistName\nend tell\n\n\nA: If you don't mind Itunes managing your music, there is a way.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open preferences -> Advanced\n\n*Copy your Itunes media folder location.\n\n*Open that folder in Finder.\n\n*There should be a folder named Automatically Add to Itunes.\n\n*Any file or folder you put there will automatically be visible in your library.\n\n\nHope it helps.\n\nA: Buy iTunes songs then open windows media and open I tunes folder , you want to burn the songs to a disc then rip the disk back on the computer  this really sucks but you can't copy iTunes music any other way\n", "Q: can I upload photos through mobile safari? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs it possible to upload files to a website from Safari on iPhone? \n\nI am designing a website.

I have a Mac for my work computer (that is company property).  Should I use my personal Apple ID, create an Apple ID with my work email, or ask for a corporate wide Apple ID (if that's possible).\nI've heard that it's possible to mix accounts, but am not sure of the consequence of doing so.  For example, what if I use my account, but wind up leaving the company?\np.s. The problems I've heard about mixing accounts are automatic updates for only one account and possible iCloud problems.\n\nA: There are arguments and reasons to go either way.\nFirst the facts we know (excluding jailbreak and cracking app store DRM):\n\n\n*\n\n*You can never change the Apple ID for each purchase once made. However, with MDM solutions evolving and VPP, there is the ability to purchase apps in bulk and then revoke the \"purchase\" by a subsequent AppleID and return a purchase to the pool for re-issue to another AppleID on later iOS versions. Perhaps that will come to the Mac at some future point.\n\n*Apple has a Volume Purchase Program to make the App Store work better for business use.\n\n*The consumer level Gift Program also exists to let one party pay and another redeem.\n\n*You can change the payment option on your account with great ease.\n\n*There is a 5 account limit on most devices.\n\n*Updating apps is a chore each time you have to:\n\n\n*\n\n*get updates for account A\n\n*go to store preferences\n\n*enter account B and the password\n\n*go back to the app store for updates \n\n*update again - entering password B a second time\n\n*go to store preferences\n\n*enter account A and the password\n\n\n*iTunes only backs up apps for which that computer is authorized. (this can be a benefit or a hassle)\nNow for some assumptions and commentary. Starting from the simplest scenario, you will either have to use a work credit card or work gift card on your personal Apple ID (juggling the payment options and providing these receipts to account for these purchases just like you would a cup of coffee, a hotel room and other petty expenses that the business just writes off.)\nHaving a \"work\" id means in theory - the work could ask you for the password (or force a reset of the password since they would likely maintain control of the email or request/force you to put their email as the contact when you leave the company). They could then issue that Apple ID to another person that would  then have use of the apps you once purchased. In practice - how would you feel getting a \"recycled\" Apple ID as the new employee or the boss welcoming a new team member. Even $1000 a year in app purchases pales in comparison to the training costs to a business for losing an employee. Company \"ownership\" of these app purchases is not a big deal in practice.\nIf you ask your employees to switch in the business account - what happens when someone fails to do that - you'll end up with an expense report anyhow or you'll have a grumpy employee. Banning personal Apple ID is a potential solution as well. That also is demeaning to someone that's going to be taking their work on the go with them - especially if work didn't buy the hardware.\nThere are times when I really want my work persona to be totally different than my personal. Having that work Apple ID separate from my home ID doesn't seem to work at all to have that separation. I would not be able to remember to switch my account - I would go to purchase - see the password and enter it. About half way through the download I would realize my mistake. I can see this working for some, but think through this if you embark on a two ID strategy.\nI would draft an addendum to your normal expense reporting policy to call for quarterly reports (if you don't report these expenses as they happen), urge you to use existing work credit cards to buy gift cards or have one work account gift apps to users that don't need many or are getting started. Once your company hits thousands of dollars of apps - you can look into the Volume Purchase Program which still lets the business send redemption codes to individual Apple ID. Make it a point to educate everyone - an executive summary (this is what we're doing/ how it will be controlled) as well as a detailed guide - who does what and when. \nOnce you think it through - the idea of work asking for a work Apple ID might make as little sense to you as it does to me. I would however, be sensitive to the finance department - the have long held practices on how to purchase software. Sitting down with them and showing them my purchase history and educating them how this all works. Handing them my phone and letting them buy an app - seeing it download and start using it is an eye opener. \n\nA: Work (current, previous, or the next) is not legally entitled to know whether I have a personal Apple ID or not, nor what I use it for (music, apps, job search or whistle-blowing emails, etc.) on my own Mac at home.\n\nA: This is a really tough issue to tackle.  Depending on the size of the organization and the type of roll out, I might just issue each employee a gift card and let them purchase the apps they need and then let them keep them after they leave.  I'd just chalk up the gift card cost to the cost of hiring someone.\n", "Q: Can't copy folder with files from external hard drive because of permissions? I can't copy a folder (with files) from an external hard drive because of permissions problems. (You do not have permissions to the files in this folder.)\nHowever, those files were created by me (on Snow Leopard - I'm on Lion right now). Is there any want to force or gain admin permissions on those files?\n\nA: If you are familiar with terminal you can use the following command;\nsudo chown -R username directory\n\nusername: your username\ndirectory: the folder in which the files you want to copy are located\nPS Requires an administrator's password\n", "Q: Can I use my UK Mac Mini (Mid 2010)  in the US? I'm from England and I'll be going to the US and I'd like to take my Mac Mini (Mid 2010) (not the newest version).\nMy main question is: would it be safe to use over there?\nI'm worried because of the voltage difference.\nIf so should I purchase a US power supply cable (does Apply even sell these separately) or a UK->US plug adapter? \n\nA: Yes it is safe. You will need a US plug adapter or a replacement cord, but the mac itself is good to go.   \nReading through the specs it states:\nElectrical and operating requirements\nLine voltage: 100-240V AC\nThe power supply can handle both the frequency and voltage changes. \nAnd for the question about buying a power cable or use an adapter -> Up to you I did use both and didn't have any problems. I'd go for a US power cable since that is less clunky, if you stay for longer.

But I am already loged in to my iTunes account and keep getting an error where my iPod tells me to log in to iTunes account on a computer\n\nI had originally pluged my ipod in to the computer as it would give me this message and not let me update my apps.  Once pluged in it told me there was ipod updates so i installed them.  In that process it told me there was a problem with my ipod and that i had to set it to factory settings.  So needless to say, i was not happy about losing all that i had on my ipod!  But still now it gives me the same message.  I deauthorized and reauth computer and i thought that worked as it let me uppdate an app and add a new app.  But then as i started to build my app selection again it would still from time to time tell me i need to log in to my itunes on my computer before the app could be added (even though i am still loged in).  This is the same computer, and connection i have always used for this ipod.  Now that i am at work i am using my Wi-Fi here and i have been able to add apps with NO problems!  So what could be causing the problem at home all of the sudden??\n\nA: You are doing everything right. Sometimes an error on the other end (apple's servers) can look like a local problem to iTunes. Most of the time, what you did would have fixed this.\nHave you considered getting a hand from the billing / account people that work for Apple? Start with the Account & Billing section on the left...\nYour computer needs the OK from Apple's on line servers to fix the errors. This is an account issue and you don't have to pay for this support (but may have to start by emailing apple if no one is free when you ask for help). \nYou could try authorizing your account on any iOS device or another computer to rule out problems with your online account as well. \nIf you get errors on your computer after you re-authorize, you might have to go through this article on iTunes repeatedly prompts to authorize computer to fix things. If the iPod is giving the error, be sure to restore the iPod (which will wipe everything that's not backed up) to get the new authorization to take on the iPod.\n", "Q: Is there a way to search my Samsung SCH-R500 phone through a Terminal window? I have my Samsung SCH-R500 phone connected to my computer via bluetooth. Though when I go to browse in the 'Bluetooth File Exchange' software, nothing comes up. So, I was wondering if I can navigate through my phone using a Terminal. Or, is there a way to get to it by going through the directory?\n\nA: There's probably not much you can do. I had an old Sony Ericsson phone which I could connect to with Bluetooth File Exchange; it allowed me to copy ringtone files back and forth but that's about it.\nOlder, \"non-smart\" phones aren't full computers in the same way that iPhone or Android phones are. When you use Bluetooth File Exchange the device is providing limited access to some data that it decides to export; you aren't interacting with the files directly. So even if you could access it via the Terminal, you wouldn't see a file system with files you could copy to your Mac.\nIf you're trying to recover specific data from your phone, like ringtones or address book info, you're better off asking a question about that (\"How do I copy ringtones from my Samsung XYZ phone?\"), and giving as much info about your phone (model number, version numbers on any info screens) as possible.\n\nA: This question is a good way to learn about what a Bluetooth profile actually does.\nMac OS X supports about ten of the 30 profiles listed on Wikipedia.\nEven if your phone had some profile that allowed it's storage to be mounted as a filesystem, until mac gets that support, it will only receive files one by one since that's how the Bluetooth File-Transfer-Protocol profile is implemented. \n(Adding to the confusion is Bluetooth FTP isn't at all the same as the older FTP file transfer which is why most marketing material calls it Bluetooth File Exchange and not FTP)\n", "Q: Java applications (eg.Netbeans&Eclipse) constantly quit unexpectedly After upgrading to Lion and installed the Java runtime for Lion, Netbeans and Eclipse became very unstable.

I used verbose mode to see where it was hanging (\"mDNSResponder: adding browse domain local\") and found some advice online that said repairing the disk permissions might help.\nSo I booted into single user mode, ran fsck -fy a couple times until it stopped complaining, ran mount -uw / and autodiskmount -va fine, and got stuck at diskutil.\nIt just hangs (over an hour, no output).\nIs there anything else I should try, or should I just revert to surgery and grab the hd?\n\nA: Sounds like your filesystem took a serious beating (if you have to run fsck multiple times, it probably discarded a bunch of stuff in the process). Permission repair (diskutil repairPermissions disk<X>s<Y>) relies on the package receipts kept in /var/db/receipts and will not work successfully if these are damaged or missing (although it shouldn't hang, but who knows what else got blown up).\nAssuming you don't have a recent backup of the system (if you do, restore from that), the next step would be to boot from the OS X DVD, launch Disk Utility from there and try it's permission repair. If that doesn't work either, exit Disk Utility and select Archive & Install, which basically moves all system files into /Previous System, reinstalls OS X and leaves the user files intact (or at least as intact as they are now). If you lack the disk space for that, you can also Install (without archiving the old system files). In either case you'll want to check the Preserve existing Users & Network Settings option.\n\nA: Diskutil won't start in single-user mode without starting the following five services first:\nnotifyd, configd, diskmanagementd, securityd and disarbitrationd.\nDetails and example-script here: http://www.system-fabrik.de/diskutil-single-user-mode/\n", "Q: How do I install software from a CD or DVD shared from a Windows 7 PC?

I have remote login enabled via the System Preferences \"Sharing\" pane.  When I ssh into the machine, bash sources ~/.profile, which I have set up to source my ~/.bashrc file and set up my MacPorts path.  The problem is that when I run ssh without a tty, like this:\nssh myhost echo \\$PATH\n\nOr run a git command that essentially uses ssh in the same way:\ngit clone ssh://myhost/~/code/myrepo.git\n\nMy ~/.profile file is never sourced, so my $PATH variable is missing /opt/local (where MacPorts has installed git).  I am aware that:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can configure git on my local machine to use /opt/local/bin/git-* on my remote machine\n\n*I wouldn't have this problem if I was forcing a tty with ssh -t\nBut I don't want to do either of those.  I want my remote machine to source my ~/.profile file regardless of whether or not I'm logging in w/ a tty.\nHow do I make that dream a reality?\nAlso: I checked the behavior on a couple Linux machines (Debian and Fedora), and both systems seem to source the ~/.bashrc file on login regardless of whether it is a tty.  I was under the impression that BSD and Linux both use the same OpenSSH and bash implementations, so it seems like the difference in behavior might come from differences in /etc config files?\n\nA: Here's a method to have bash source .bashrc on non-interactive sessions so that you don't have to hard code environment variables in multiple places:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set PermitUserEnvironment to yes in /etc/sshd_config (man sshd)\n\n*Set BASH_ENV to ~/.bashrc in ~/.ssh/environment (man bash)\n\n*Add this line to the top of your ~/.bashrc, which sources /etc/profile for non-interactive sessions:\n\n\nThis essentially duplicates the interactive login environment for non-interactive logins, without having to hard code environment values (e.g., $PATH) in multiple places.\nif [[ ! $- == *i* ]]; then\n        . /etc/profile\nfi\n\nStep 3. is needed only if you have the Macports path(s) set in /etc/paths like I do. But if you're setting those paths (e.g., /opt/local/bin) in ~/.bashrc, then I suppose you wouldn't need Step 3. \nFor your situation, you should be able to change ~/.bashrc to ~/.profile. \nI have ~/.bash_profile source ~/.bashrc, and I do not use ~/.profile. With this configuration (and the above changes), bash environment variables (e.g., $PATH) should look identical for interactive login, interactive non-login, and non-interactive sessions.\n\nA: Bash has special provisions in its source code to source ~/.bashrc when it's invoked by rshd or sshd. It's a compilation option, which given your experience seems not to be turned on under OSX.\nIf you're logging in with a key, you can (ab)use the command= option in the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.\nA key with a command option is good only for running the specified command; but the command in the authorized_keys file runs with the environment variable SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND set to the command the user specified (empty for interactive sessions). So you can use something like this in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (of course, it won't apply if you don't use this key to authenticate):\ncommand=\". ~/.profile;\n         if [ -n \\\"$SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND\\\" ]; then\n           eval \\\"$SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND\\\";\n         else exec \\\"$SHELL\\\"; fi\" ssh-rsa …\n\nNote that I put line breaks above for legibility, but this actually needs to be all on one line.\nHow can I set environment variables for a remote rsync process? may have other helpful suggestions.\n\nA: this was very annoying.\nuncomment this line in config-top.h and rebuild:\n/* Define this if you want bash to try to check whether it's being run by\nsshd and source the .bashrc if so (like the rshd behavior).  This checks\nfor the presence of SSH_CLIENT or SSH2_CLIENT in the initial environment,\nwhich can be fooled under certain not-uncommon circumstances. */\ndefine SSH_SOURCE_BASHRC\naccording the CHANGES in the source this behavior was changed in bash-2.05a-rc1.  but the current man page still claims the previous behavior:\n   Bash attempts to determine when it is being run with its standard input\n   connected  to a a network connection, as if by the remote shell daemon,\n   usually rshd, or the secure shell daemon sshd.  If bash  determines  it\n   is  being  run  in  this  fashion,  it reads and executes commands from\n   ~/.bashrc, if that file exists and is readable.  It will not do this if\n   invoked as sh.  The --norc option may be used to inhibit this behavior,\n   and the --rcfile option may be used to force another file to  be  read,\n   but  rshd  does  not  generally  invoke the shell with those options or\n   allow them to be specified.\n\n", "Q: MP3 player not able to play music (and not showing up in Finder or iTunes) I have a PoGo digital voice recorder. I'm trying to play the mp3s in iTunes. The device is not showing up in iTunes or in the Finder. Assuming that the cables are good, what else should I look for?\n\nA: I believe that a voice recorder would be seen by Mac OS X as either an MP3 player or a flash drive. In that case, one of the last articles published by Apple on support for non-Apple music players in iTunes is here. It is not a recent list, but I have very little reason to believe that any other players are being added to it. In fact, it would seem reasonable that Apple has stopped support for most MP3 players other than iPods at this time. \nThe best bet for any non-Apple MP3 player drivers for Mac OS X would be to go directly to the website of PoGo. After running a few searches, I could not even find their website (pogo.com actually takes you to an Electronic Arts gaming site). \nI am sorry to say that there may not be a way to access your device. I would think that Mac OS X would at least try and mount it as a USB flash drive, but since it didn't I am not sure what other options are out there for you. \nHave you tried using that same USB cable and PoGo device on a Windows machine? At the very least, if Windows can mount it that would tell you that both the device and cable are okay. Windows does reasonably well with its generic drivers for things like cameras and flash drives. \nFor illustration's sake, let's say that Windows is the only way to have access to your device. If so, then a way to get to use your Mac with it would be with something like Parallels, VMware or Boot Camp. You could have Windows load the files and those files would be accessible to you from the Mac's Finder. You could then drag the files into iTunes. But it just feels like too much effort installing all of that. But then again, the PoGo might be a great voice recorder. Hope this helps and good luck. \n", "Q: Why are Safari and Chrome not throwing warnings after removing the root certificates Certificates issued by DigiNotar have been blacklisted today by Mozilla. Viewing websites with certificates issued by DigiNotar with a nightly build of Firefox will render warnings.\nInstead of waiting for an update, for the certificates to be revoked on my own system, I removed the root certificates from my Keychain but Chrome still validates the website certificates and Safari isn't throwing any warnings.\nAm i missing something?\nCertificates removed:\n\n\n*\n\n*DigiNotar Root CA\n\n*Staat der Nederlanden Root CA\n\n*Staat der Nederlanden\nRoot CA - G2\n\n\nWebsite tested: https://as.digid.nl/\n\nHere's an alternate test site that shows the problem in Chrome 13.0.782.218: http://auth.pass.nl\nI have deleted the DigiNotar root CA from my Keychain. Chrome has been restarted. But Chrome still says this site is valid and lists the DigiNotar root CA as the authority on the SSL for the site.\n\n\nA: Every site I check that I have manually set as untrusted shows a warning. Perhaps things are changing on the servers so rapidly, different people doing the same actions are seeing different results.\n\nLet's set aside the concept of blacklisting in general and certificate revocation like (CRL) or online verification like OCSP and just pick apart the mechanism of SSL certificates in the browser. I will set aside Chrome/Firefox/other browsers and just focus on Safari and the Mac Keychain as that's trouble enough for this post.\nThe short answer is the site you list doesn't depend on the one certificate that was used in a way that has caused the press to run all the blacklist stories.\nIt was used to sign certificates that matched anything ending in google.com and they were spotted in use on sites that were certainly not google. This is a technological equivalent to someone constructing tunnels into a bank vault. Not plans to tunnel - but a working actual tunnel around a barrier everyone expected to be solid.\n\nNow onto how to know why Safari didn't flag the site you listed as \"bad\".\nI haven't deleted any certificates from the mac I'm on and just fired up the Keychain Assistant to use the Certificate Assistant (under the Keychain Access menu -> Certification Assistant -> Open...\nIn the small CA window, select continue, then View and Evaluate, then View and evaluate certificates, then continue.\n\nAs you can now see, https://as.digid.nl/ is serving up four certificates in the chain of trust:\n\n*\n\n*cert name - type - SHA1 fingerprint - status\n\n*as.digid.nl - SSL - 2D F7 4E 54 00 90 80 08 01 0A 2F 3E 5A EE BE 36 5F EC 82 F3 - invalid due to host name mismatch (harmless error - the tool evaluates that cert for your mac and my mac isn't as.digid.nl)\n\n*DigiNotar PKIoverheid CA Overheid en Bedrijven - intermediate - 40 AA 38 73 1B D1 89 F9 CD B5 B9 DC 35 E2 13 6F 38 77 7A F4 - valid\n\n*Staat der Nederlanden Overheid CA - intermediate - 29 FC 35 D4 CD 2F 71 7C B7 32 7F 82 2A 56 0C C4 D2 E4 43 7C - valid\n\n*Staat der Nederlanden Root CA - root - 10 1D FA 3F D5 0B CB BB 9B B5 60 0C 19 55 A4 1A F4 73 3A 04 - valid\n\n\nIn your question you stated you deleted the root key - if so, your safari is either cacheing the old values or when you looked, that site had a SSL certificate different than the one I saw making this answer. You'll have to reproduce the steps I just took to see which was the case.\nIn my case,\nI only had to mark the Staat der Nederlanden Root CA root certificate as untrusted to get Safari to balk and show this message when you load the site.\n\n\nSince all the press is specific about only the DigiNotar Root CA as being bad, I am going to undo my change to not trust the Staat der Nederlanden Root CA.\nI am going to mark the DigiNotar Root CA as never to be trusted and wait and see what Apple does. If you are interested in this sort of thing, do monitor the Apple Security page.\n\nA: It seems this is a serious bug in OS X.\n\nUsers can revoke a certificate using Keychain, but if they happen to visit a site that uses the more-secure Extended Validation Certificates, the Mac will accept the EV certificate even if it's been issued by a certificate authority marked as untrusted in Keychain.\n\nSource: http://www.computerworld.com\n\nA: The website doesn’t use the DigiNotar CA Root certificate. The root certificate in the case of as.digid.nl is from the “Staat der Nederlanden root CA” – which is safe (presumably). True, there is a DigiNotar certificate in the website’s chain of certificates but this is not the root certificate – it is merely a link in the chain, and is a different certificate.\n\nA: It's possible that the certs you are seeing are signed by multiple CAs (or intermediate CA certs are signed by multiple entities).  You would have to identify and remove all the signing CAs involved.\n\nA: As far as I know, some browsers (like Firefox) are not using the certificates in your keychain. Chrome is based on Webkit, so I assume it does use the keychain.\nRestarting Safari was not necessary for me; marking the root cert as \"untrusted\" and reloading the page was sufficient.\nNot that you can only mark the root (Staat der Nederlanden Root CA) as untrusted; the other certs are not in your keychain, but rather transmitted from the host every time you start an SSL session.\nCould you post a screenshot of the certifcate window when you load as.digid.nl ? Maybe that can shed some light on the issue...\n", "Q: Can Python/Ruby/Perl/etc (or even bash) replace AppleScript? I'm not inviting people to hate on AppleScript in general; I'm just wondering if what makes AppleScript useful can instead be used by other general-purpose scripting languages. I.e., Lion & Mac Apps probably give AppleScript hooks & APIs—could any language use those? Or is AppleScript in its own special category?\nContext: I'm learning about Unix and how it underlies OS X, and trying to become aware about opportunities and strategies for automation & abstraction. Aaaand I already feel like my brain is leaking, so if I have to add more to my plate I try to do so sparingly.\n\nA: In terms of general purpose Unix scripting, many languages like bash, perl, python, or ruby are more capable than AppleScript. But AppleScript has a special role in MacOS with great native support for Mac specific things, particularly related to the GUI.\nThere are bindings between other scripting language and MacOS events. For instance, see the MacPython OSA Modules°°° or Apple's Ruby and Python for Mac OS X°°°. In general I'd consider these efforts second class citizens; they may work and be a good choice but it will be a bit of an awkward fit.\n¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯\n°°° EDIT:\nBoth languages are not supported on latest MacOS systems. These links return:\n\nRetired Document – Important: The current version of Ruby (2.0) is not\n  supported as a Cocoa scripting language in OS X v10.9. The remainder\n  of the content in this document has not been reviewed for accuracy.\n  Apple recommends Objective-C for the development of Cocoa apps. [My highlighting.]\n\nDocuments are finished with this line: \n\nCopyright © 2013 Apple Inc. All Rights Reserved. […] Updated: 2013-09-18\n\n\nA: My answer would be: yes\nApplescript is a horrible anachronism from System 7 and in all my years of Mac use and development I could never bring myself to write a single line of it.\nOSA is a framework supported by Apple which allows you do access anything normally done over Applescript. Whether it's first or second class, only Apple knows. Java was touted by Apple as a first class citizen for Cocoa until Apple killed it. Python and Ruby are different though because they are modern languages while Applescript is an ancient mess and Apple knows it.\nSpeaking specifically from a Ruby background, you have a few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*rb-appscript - rather outdated\n\n*RubyOSA\n\n*ScriptingBridge for Cocoa. Also a good tutorial on it with MacRuby at Ars Technica.\n\n\nI've used these quite extensively in the past years and they do the job very nicely. Similar equivalents should exist for Python.\n\nA: AppleScript is in its own special category, as it is developed by Apple and has its own built-in mechanisms for interacting with the Apple Events system in OS X. I'm not aware of any such built-in support in the other scripting languages you mentioned.\nIn order to add that support into your scripts, you could use an event bridge such as appscript to allow you to leverage AppleScript hooks in apps from Ruby or Python. I've never used it myself, so your mileage may vary.\n\nA: The design philosophies of AppleScript and command-line scripting languages are two very different things. They both aim at getting things done, but go about it in very different ways.\nAppleScript is meant to help you automate common high level GUI based tasks, so you don't have to click this and type that over and over again.\nCommand-line scripts usually offer more flexibility and power than AppleScript (unless you really know your AS that is!) letting you dig deep into the guts of Mac OS X's unix-like APIs.\nTo summarize:\n\n\n*\n\n*AppleScript: Automate your GUI-based software.\n\n*Command-line scripts: Do most other tasks.\n\n*No, they can't replace AppleScript because AS is closer to the GUI for many tasks (it's a breeze to automate mounting a remote volume in AppleScript, I would not want to try it in bash or perl).\n\n\nA: javascript is officially supported since OSX 10.10. It is described by apple as \"javascript for automation\", shortened as \"JXA\".\nJust to clarify things, you can accomplish in javascript everything that is related to gui and automation, like applescript and more.

I used brew to install MacVim and it put it in /usr/local/Cellar/macvim/7.3-61/MacVim.app\nI would like to be able to go to spotlight and type MacVim to launch the app. I tried creating a symlink in the Applications directory to /usr/local/Cellar/macvim/7.3-61/MacVim.app. But that doesn't seem to show up in Spotlight. I set the executable bits on the symlink. open MacVim.app from the command line works. How can I get MacVim to show up in Spotlight search?\n\nA: The way I've solved this is using a shell script and appify.\nFor example make a script with a text editor that contains\n#!/bin/bash\n\n/usr/local/Cellar/macvim/7.3-61/MacVim.app\n\nThen get appify - http://git.abackstrom.com/appify.git \nRun appify on the shell script and it will make an application you can put in /Applications that will invoke MacVim. This will show up in spotlight.\n\nA: *\n\n*Symbolic links (ln -s) did not work well for me, it did not appear that Spotlight would see this as an application.  \n\n*Making a finder alias (as described by Daniel) worked better regarding launching from Finder, but did not when using Finder Open With..., the alias would remain grayed out.\nIn particular, like mentioned in other comments here, I also wanted MacVim to be available when using Open With... from Finder, but with either the symbolic link or Finder alias, MacVim would remain grayed out.\nWhat worked for me was the simple Automator script (as zim described), with the \"Run Shell Script\" command.  The only thing I had to do differently than what zim showed in his answer is adding the -a parameter to open:\nopen -a /usr/local/opt/macvim/MacVim.app $@\n\nWithout the -a, when used with \"Open With...\", MacVim would launch, but also the parameter filename would open with whatever its default application was -- so I would get both MacVim with empty document AND TextEdit with the file I had selected to open (rather than MacVim with my selected file opened).\nThe automator script can be copied or aliased to the Applications folder.  I also changed my automator script's icon to MacVim's icon by copying & pasting the icon from the Finder's Get Info popups.\n\nA: In the Finder, press CommandShiftG for Go to the Folder. Type /usr/local/Cellar/macvim/7.3-61/ and press return. Select the file (actually a folder) MacVim.app Press CommandL for Make Alias.

A better option is to use Automator to create an Application that runs a shell script:\nAlso, linking directly to the MacVim.app in the Cellar directory like some of the other answers suggest binds you to a specific version. If brew upgrades MacVim, your link will still point to the old version. Rather, you should use:\nopen /usr/local/opt/macvim/MacVim.app $@\n\nas this location is automatically symlinked by brew to the most recent version.\nThis worked great for me. I save the Automator file in iCloud so I can conveniently add the app on other machines.\n\nA: Best way doing it come from homebrew it self\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to make alias file to POSIX file \"/usr/local/Cellar/macvim/7.3-61/MacVim.app\" at POSIX file \"/Applications/\"'\n\nhere is the reference:\n\nA: The simple act of installing homebrew allowed me to create a symlink to Sublime Text.

I know that I can use an existing external hard drive and time machine can backup to it without affecting the other files.\nHowever, it seems that is only the case if the external drive is formatted as HFS+. So if I want to have an external drive that I can use to store files that will be used by both Mac OS X and Windows 7 (and possibly linux), is my only option to partition the external disk?\nPartition 1: HFS+ (Time Machine backups)\nPartition 2: exFAT (Docs, Music, Videos for use by W7 and OS X)\nIs there another way to accomplish this without having to partition the external drive?\n\nA: I would suggest using Mac Drive by Mediafour: http://www.mediafour.com/products/macdrive\nI've used their product for years and it has always been rock solid. I'd say at $49.99, it is reasonably priced too. And honestly, you may find a free solution, but to me, data integrity will always trump a slight to the wallet.\nThat is if you absolutely want one partition, but considering that one is a dedicated Time Machine repository, I would advise against it. While Time Machine makes a simple folder with all the backups (Backups.backupdb), it is ill-advised to store anything else on that particular partition. I know people that do it without problems, and all Apple says about the practice is the following:\n\nNote: Time Machine works best if you use your backup disk only for\n  Time Machine backups. If you keep files on your backup disk, Time\n  Machine won’t back up those files, and the space available for Time\n  Machine backups will be reduced.\n\nBut again, it's just good to keep things separate in my opinion. I'm not one for arbitrary compartmentalization, but in the case of backups, maybe letting them have their own room might not be such a bad thing.\n\nA: The only other option I can see is buying HFS+ drivers from Windows such as these,\nhttp://www.paragon-software.com/home/hfs-windows/ (like $20)\nor using a special application to browse the drive, such as this one:\nhttp://www.catacombae.org/hfsx.html (free).\nRegarding linux, this might be useful:\nhttp://www.ardistech.com/hfsplus/\nHope it helps!

I then (maybe not so cleverly) tried to restore a previous hard drive image to the hard drive. Unsurprisingly enough, the computer wouldn't start. So I decided that I would go with a fresh install of Lion.\nHowever, when I booted from the Recovery Partition, it told me it would take 5 hours+ to download \"Additional Components\" needed to install Lion.\nI'm assuming that it meant it was downloading the entire 4Gb Lion operating system! Is there not a copy of this on the \"Recovery\" partition? Is there anyway to install Lion without having to download the entire thing?\n\nA: The \"Internet Recovery\" function only contains a small system, just enough to boot up, let you do diagnostics, browse the web, and download the install packages. It doesn't contain the full install of OS X.\nA full installer can be created from the Mac App store download, but the newest minis and Airs use a special build, so that won't work for them. Even if it did, you'd still have to download it at least once.\nAt the moment I'm afraid your best hope may be to take it to an Apple store and explain your dilemma. They'll be able to get things installed, either by downloading it on their (hopefully faster) connection, or installing from a local copy/image.\nOnce you do have your system set up again, you may want to invest in a backup hard drive and use a tool like SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner to make a bootable backup that you can use as a restore drive.\n", "Q: Home Directory to NAS How can I store my home directory to a NAS device? I go to System Preferences\n->Accounts ->CTRL Click \"My Account\" -> Advanced Options... What do I enter in the Home Directory field to accomplish this? Is this possible? I can store my home directory on a USB or Firewire drive.\nThanks in advance for the assistance.\n\nA: First you'll need to make sure that the network volume you want to use is mounted first. Then you should be able to just navigate to whatever folder you're planning on using as your new home directory and select it. Network volumes in the OS X Finder can typically be found in the \"Network\" item under the main directory of your computer (in the Finder, you can hit ⇧⌘K to go there directly). The absolute path if you're using the terminal is typically /Volumes/Share Name.\nIt's worth noting that if you login without the network drive mounted, things could easily break. For this reason you'll want to make sure that you've set up OSX to mount the share on boot (prior to login). This doesn't happen with SMB (Windows file sharing) or AFP automatically, but there may be a way to hack it, maybe others can chime in with this part. NFS shares set up through Disk Utility mount automatically, but I'm not certain when in the boot process they do, I believe it's pre-login, but I can't find any information to corroborate this.\n", "Q: Is it possible to sort iTunes U other than \"Released Date\"?

If you click on the disclosure triangle for each collection, the lectures can then be sorted by release date in ascending or descending order. \n\nA: Easiest way around this problem is to create a play list in the add + playlist.

Is it possible to run Snow Leopard (Server) inside VirtualBox on a Mac running Lion, as a means of continuing to run legacy PowerPC apps (Eudora, Quicken, et.al.) under Rosetta, even on new Macs (Lion only)?\nThe EULA seems to allow running the OS in a VM on Apple Mac hardware.\nADDED:\nIf so, what VirtualBox configuration and/or settings should one try?\nHow big a virtual HD should one use?\n(My goal is to run authentic vintage apps, if possible, not work-alikes).\n\nA: Yup. You should be able to. Give it a try. :) \nThough, I hope apps will be updated to work on Intel, because this isn't the most resource-firendly solution. It probably takes more processing power / RAM / Hard Disk Space to install and run Snow Leopard than to run the app itself. \nYet, I think you can find alternative Intel apps. I really like using Apple's Mail for e-mail, and this article shows several alternatives to Quicken. \nAnyhow, its your choice. Give it a try and see what works better for you.\n", "Q: How can I prevent new iCal events from being all-day by default? Up until Lion, I could double-click inside a particular date (in Month view) and it would automatically create a new event whose time that day defaulted to one hour.  I could then change the starting time, and the ending time would automatically adjust to be one hour later.  This was often good enough, and made adding an event very straightforward.\nIn Lion, the same action produces an all day event, which I then have to bring up in the Inspector, switch off All Day, and edit both the starting and ending times.  It's a good deal more work.  I don't see a Preference for this.  Does anyone know how to restore the pre-Lion behavior?\n\nA: You can use iCal's new 'plain English\" approach to specify a starting time.\nDouble-click to create the new event, and include \"at 6pm\" or whatever when you type in the description. When you hit Return, your event will show the required starting time and will default to a duration of one hour.\n", "Q: iPod Touch Passcode doesn't work after restore from backup My son entered too many incorrect passcodes on my iPod Touch and apparently forced it to wipe my iPod clean.  Sadly, this has happened before.  I connected to iTunes and restored from my latest backup and then sync'd.  When I went to unlock my iPod, instead of being presented with the usual numeric keypad, I was given the full qwerty keyboard.  This was alarming, but I switched to number mode and entered my numeric passcode.  I was told \"Wrong Passcode, try again\".\nWhat has happened?  Why won't my passcode work, and where did this qwerty keyboard come from?  And most importantly, how do I fix this?\n\nA: The solution to my problem was rather simple, though I still don't understand it:\nReboot.\nMy battery drained completely, and when it came back on after plugging it in it presented the expected numeric keypad and accepted my passcode.  It seems rebooting was all I needed to get back to normal.\nIt doesn't make sense to my why it happened that way.  If you have an explanation, I'll happily accept your answer.\n\nA: That is normal behavior. Each reinstall of settings on a clean device requires a reboot. It doesn't matter if the device is 'clean' due an iOS upgrade or clean from a security wipe. iOS backups are not simply copied over. They are interpreted for security and compatibility.\nHave a look on the device next time you upgrade iOS. It should perform two reboots. One for the iOS and one after your settings are in place.\nOddly, he should have don't that second reboot on his own since its part of the procedure.\n", "Q: Hyperlinked iOS mail signature, any ideas?

However, I dont want to load such heavy program just to preview IE :(\nI need an alternative or faster way to view IE\n\nA: Wine claims to support IE 6, 7, and 8 with varying levels of efficacy.\nIt's not a simple solution, but it sure is a hell of a lot lighter-weight then a VM, and it effectively runs the full browser on OSX.\nYou need to be at least somewhat familiar with the command line to get anywhere with Wine, though.\nCrossover Mac is basically a MacOS GUI for wine. It has the same capabilities as wine, but the GUI makes installing things much easier. On the other hand, it's not free.\n\nA: You can either install Windows as a virtual machine (eg. VMWare Fusion or Parallels Desktop) or on a Bootcamp partition. Note that this requires a Windows license and media for installing. In Windows you can then install IETester for example.\nThere are some online services that will make screenshots for you in said browsers like Adobe Browserlab (https://browserlab.adobe.com/). Though that might not be ideal when wanting to quickly debug some problems.\nThere are even services where you connect to a remote VNC instance running a selected Windows configuration like http://www.browsercam.com/. But those generally do not come free to my knowledge. \n<= browsercam.com will be shut down FEB 1, 2013 <= http://www.browsercam.com/important-message/\n\nA: Buy a cheap used Windows XP Pro box (or rent a Windows VM from some cloud if you want to be more \"green\") and just leave it running.  Use a Remote Desktop or VNC viewer to view IE on it from your Mac.

How can I create passwordless keychain on OS X? Specifically, I'm wondering if it's possible to sign application without keychain storing p12 and developer certificates\nUsing 10.7.1 OS X\n\nA: Hold down Option when clicking OK with a blank password; Keychain Access will allow it.  Just worked for me on El Capitan.  Note-- when you log in (with a password) you will have to press OK to unlock it.\n\nA: You should be able to remove the password from the keychain. I don't have a password on my keychain. I am also on SL, so maybe Lion is different. I don't know why it would be much different. Try changing the password for the keychain, and instead of entering a new password, leave it blank.

(Suggest the best way for this.)\n\n*Do I need to buy any other hardware for the remote connection or I can do thru Wi-Fi available in both Mac mini and MacBook?\n\n*What about the performance compared to direct and remote connections as it is vital for virtual machine communication.\n\n\nA: \nCan I connect to Mac Mini Remotely from Mac book?\n\nYes. You can use OS X's built-in screen sharing. It's a VNC-based application that ships with OS X. You'll need to enable it on your systems in order to use it. Open System Preferences -> Sharing. And make sure 'Screen Sharing' is checked. I recommend the excellent ScreenSharingMenulet -- sits in your menu bar and lists any Bonjour-enabled screen sharing hosts in a drop down when you click on it for automatic discovery and easy connection to shared screens in your network.\n\nDo I need to buy any other hardware for the remote connection or I can do thru Wi-FI available in both Mac MINI and Mac book?\n\nNo additional hardware or software is required. You don't even need ScreenSharingMenulet -- you can find and connect to shared screens via Finder if you like.\nYou do say something confusing your question though:\n\nMy aim to have a logical system with 12 GB (8GB with Mac MINI + 4 GB in laptop)for running Virtual Machines on both Mac MINI and Mac Book and be able talk to each other.\n\nYou cannot tie the machines together using screen sharing. They won't present themselves as one logical, virtual device to any virtualization software with shared memory or CPUs or any such thing. They will act as completely separate machines, but they can be accessed, graphically, from one another.\nIf you're trying to tie the machines together to act as a single, unified \"super computer\" you need to look at much more complicated technologies than anything OS X ships with. Beowulf for clustering and something better than ethernet for inter-machine communication will be necessary like a fiber channel connection (and that will require more hardware).\n\nWhat about the performance compared to direct and remote connections as it is vital for Virtual Machine communication.\n\nIt is difficult to give an answer to this question as it all depends on what you're trying to do when it comes to communication between the machines. On the remote access side of things: over my local wireless network the performance is decent if you use adaptive mode on the screen sharing application but it can get glitchy if you disable adaptive quality scaling. If my macs are all on wires on Gbit ethernet then non-adaptive scaling is quite good. Processes running within VMs on my Macs have good sustained throughput to the Mac's built-in ethernet and wireless network interfaces. Inter-process communication between VMs running on separate Macs is going to be completely dependent on your network and your processes -- impossible to give an answer that'll cover all cases I'm afraid. If you get more specific with what you're trying to do I could possibly answer this more succinctly.\n\nA: Yes, you can connect remotely via VNC (Screen Sharing) and SSH. Both will work fine over Wi-Fi and you can create an ad-hoc network if you don't have an access point.\nWhat sort of virtualization software do you intend to achieve this \"logical system\" with though?\n\nA: It depends on which remote access. The easiest way to connect to a mac to other mac is \"Screen Sharing and Remote Management\".\nJust enable the screen sharing on both systems and then start screen sharing by using one of\nvnc://ip-address/\nvnc://machine-name-Main-Domain/\n\nYou can copy & paste any of these address in URL of Safari or Firefox.\n\nDo I need to buy any other hardware for the remote connection or I can do thru Wi-Fi available in both Mac mini and MacBook?\n\nWi-Fi should work just fine. For increased speed (and reliability) I suggest to use ethernet wires like CAT5e etc. You can get 25ft ethernet for less then $20.00 on Amazon.   \n", "Q: How do I close the editor in iPhoto? In iPhoto 09, how do you close the editor without closing the Event you're working in?\nFor example, you can enlarge a photo with space, then go back to the event with space again (single-clicking the image also goes back). However, if I'm editing the image, clicking \"Done\", double-clicking the image, and pressing Escape or Return all take me back to \"All Events\". How do you close the editor only, so you can go back to the thumbnail view of the event, or at least to the enlarged photo view?\n\nA: Since I got different results from @Brandon, I started experimenting again. Esc, Done, and others behave as expected when I follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Events from the Library group on the sidebar\n\n*Select your event\n\n*Edit a photo\n\n*Click done, press Esc, or any other quit-editing combination.\n\n*Voila, you're back at the event's thumbnail view.\n\n\nIf, however, you do as I've been doing while doing one-off imports of additional photos and merging them in to your existing event, you'll be in this situation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do work...\n\n*Select your event from the Recent group on the sidebar (first item under Recent, above \"Last 12 months\").\n\n*Edit a photo\n\n*Click done, press Esc, or any other quit-editing combination.\n\n*You're kicked back to the All events view, even though the sidebar shows your recent event is still selected.\n\n\nA: Not sure if this will but I put some pictures into iPhoto 09 and messed around with it to see if I could get it to what it looks like you trying to do. I pressed fn + esc. & it looks like it saves all edits and also brings you back to just that photo. Does this help?\n", "Q: How do I un-trust or remove blacklisted root CAs from mobile Safari on my iPhone or iPad? The DigiNotar root CA has been compromised and has been blacklisted by Mozilla and Chrome. I've already un-trusted their root CA in Keychain on my OS X devices, but how can I do something similar on my iPhone and iPad?\nEdit: I'd like to do this without having to jailbreak any device.\nEdit: The i0S 5 update from Apple removes the DigiNotar root CA from your iDevice and also gets rid of trust for MD5-signed certs. See this Ars Technica article for details.\n\nA: You don't. (not without jail breaking iOS) More sadly, we've gone from the situation on iOS 4 -> 5 ->6 -> iOS 7 and still cannot choose what certificates are trusted by the OS.\nThis is either a bug in the iPhone configuration utility or an unimplimented feature. If you care, do reach out to apple to ask for this. \nhttp://www.apple.com/feedback or http://bugreporter.apple.com\nUnless you are comfortable writing a technically correct bug, the feedback link is a better avenue. Calling AppleCare or asking for this at the genius bar might also be worthwhile. \n", "Q: How can you install new versions of Ruby, Rails, and Git without running into the old versions? I've been having this problem for the past several years where I like to stay up-to-date and install the latest versions of software like Ruby, Rails, and Git. However, I somehow always seem to have difficulty using the latest versions.\nFor example, I go to the terminal and type\ngit --version\n\nWhich tells me that I'm running git 1.7.3.4\nSo I go to the git website and pick up the handy installer file (git-1.7.6-x86_64-snow-leopard.dmg). Then I mount the disk image and run the .pkg file... successfully installed.\nHowever, when I go back and type git --version again, it still says I'm running git 1.7.3.4 and not the newly installed 1.7.6.\nGenerally whenever I've had these problems it has turned out that I had successfully completed the installations of the new software, I just don't necessarily know where it's installed. What is the best way to keep clean installations of these and not have a bunch of different versions lying around in different places on the file system?\n\nA: This would be the case where you may want to use a packange manager like MacPorts or Fink. They generally install in a seperate directory like /opt/local/bin so as not to collide with the already installed software. (Note that these download the source codes and dependancies and compile them instead of fetching a compiled binary, so it can take some time for larger packages.)\nAnother think to do is open up the .pkg file in Installer and Get Info (⌘I) to list all the files, and often where they go. You can also show the log (⌘L) to see where things have been written and what has been done.\n\nA: The general issue is your PATH. Go to the terminal and type echo $PATH On a plain OSX install you will see /usr/bin ahead of /usr/local/bin so the executables in the former are found furst which will be the older Apple supplied ones. You need to set the PATH in your ~/.bashrc file e.g. export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH which will set /usr/local/bin as the first directory to look in.\nAs to which directories you need to set on the path it depends. Most lain installs and builds default to /usr/local/bin but Git I think goes to /usr/local/git/bin. So you need to look at what the package installes. As @CyberSkull says using a package manage can make this easier/ For macports add /opt/local/bin and for Fink /sw/bin to the fromt of the path - but only use one of them.\n\nA: My newly installed git is in the /usr/local, and I export this path in my .profile to use the new git.\nFor Ruby, I installed the v1.9.2, following the instruction from: http://www.stevestmartin.com/2009/09/11/ruby-1-9-2-on-snow-leopard/, and using the RVM (http://beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/)\n", "Q: How can I detect if a phone has been jailbroken remotely? I manage multiple iPhones at my organization using Active Sync settings in Exchange 2007 as well as the iPhone Configuration Utility.  I've recently performed tests where I concluded that if I were to obtain a user's phone (ie they lost it), I would be able to access much of the information on the phone without their password by jailbreaking it to gain root access and retrieving .db files from the phone.\nI'm looking for a mechanism for detecting a phone has been jailbroken and automatically wiping or notifying us when it occurrs.  Note that this is for AFTER we've alreay pushed the configuration profile to the phone, NOT during initial configuration.\n\nA: I think this is more of a development issue than administrative--perhaps there's an admin tool for this, but I'm not aware of it.\nI do know that Apple inserted a jailbreak test in its iBooks app: when launched, the app would try to run some unsigned code (which should only work on a jailbroken iPhone). If the code ran, the phone was regarded as jailbroken, and iBooks would refuse to run. This was quickly defeated by the next version of jailbreaking software, which I believe circumvented that test.\nObviously this requires the user to do something in order to trigger the test (i.e., launch iBooks). It might be possible to get around that requirement with local notifications or push notifications (caveat: I am not a programmer).\n", "Q: Is Automator intended to create distributable stand-alone apps? I have a series of executables which I would like to wrap into a stand-alone .app. A bit like ffmpegx does for the executables contained under its /Resources folder.\nI've noticed that Automator allows you to create a stand-alone application, but it's not clear to me how to:\n\n\n*\n\n*include my executables within the .app package\n\n*specify a relative path when adding a \"run shell script\" action, so I can execute my executables when the user double clicks the .app\n\n\nIs Automator intended to be used as \"application maker\" or should I use something else? If Automator is the way to go, how can I solve the two above issues?\n\nA: It's not really designed for this, but I think you can hack it to do what you'd like.\nFirst, to get the relative path to the .app package, you'll want to add a Run AppleScript action before your shell script. The code for the AppleScript should be something like this:\non run {input, parameters}\n   set p to POSIX path of (path to me)\n   return {p}\nend run\n\nThat will pass the path to your .app bundle to your shell script action as an argument. Just set the Run Shell Script to pass input as arguments and you should be set to use the path in your shell script however you need to:\n\nOnce that's done, you can package whatever executables you need in the Contents/Resources folder of the .app bundle. You can get there in the Finder by right/command-clicking the .app and selecting Show Package Contents.\nImportant Note: Automator rewrites the .app bundle every time you save it, so you'll have to add the executables again every time after you make a change.\n\nA: Automator really isn't the right tool for this job. Instead, I suggest you look into AppleScriptObjC, which is one of the project types you can create using Xcode. You'll find help with AppleScriptObjC over on Stack Overflow.\n", "Q: USB 3 via ExpressCard/34 on a thunderbolt with parallels desktop Can I use an extenal  windows formatted USB3 harddisk on my mac connected via thunderbolt on the future Sonnet Echo-Expresscard/34-Thunderbolt-Adapter?

(It wasn't working in leopard or snow leopard neither, as far as I remember)\nMagical solution needed, anyone has a clue about it?\nDoes OS X Lion discard completely the use of non-writable drive icons?\n\nA: Will Candybar work for you? It allows you to change icons, but I'm not sure about drive icons. Lemme know if it works for you.\nOk, according to this article, you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Paste your icon (in the Get Info window) onto a USB thumb drive formatted as FAT32.\n\n*The name of the drive doesn't matter.  \n\n*Launch Windows through Boot Camp, Parallels Desktop, or VMware Fusion.  \n\n*Open the thumb drive in Windows.  \n\n*Select Folder Options… from the Tools menu, and set it to show invisible files.  \n\n*Copy the two files .VolumeIcon.icns and ._[cr]File, where [cr] is a carriage return, to the NTFS drive.  \n\n\nAccording to the article, that'll work.\n", "Q: Mail.app and Gmail - All Functionality All,\nI have Gmail and I'm currently using the Sparrow application, but I wanted to see if Mail.app was able to handle what I need.\n1) Archive AND delete functionality side by side. - Yes, I archive some things I want to search later and delete other things. Last time I checked, it was only one or the other.\n2) Labels\nBasically, (almost) everything that is available in the web interface. \n\nA: Actually Mail 5 (i.e. on Lion) handles Gmail much better than on previous cats. \n1) There's both Archive and Delete buttons. I think the Archive button isn't visible by default. Right-click (or control-click) the toolbar to \"Customize Toolbar...\" and you should see the Archive button. Drag it up to your toolbar. \n2) @adam-rice is correct that there's no direct analog for Labels in Mail. They are remapped to folders. If you just pretend Folders are Labels this does work pretty well. Mail does download a copy of a message for each folder/label it resides in. On previous versions of Mail this would clog up some inboxes/folders with the multiple copies. Mail 5 now recognizes and hides duplicates, though; it seems specifically designed to handle Gmail labels. In Mail's beautiful threaded conversation view you'll just see the one copy of each message, though you will see a note that it has duplicates.\nWith Mail 5 you can get pretty close to what you can do in the web interface. You might need to remap some keyboard shortcuts. Let Gmail's server do a lot of the heavy lifting. Go to Gmail settings>> Labels tab and check or uncheck the \"show in imap\" box for some inboxes/labels you don't want to see in Mail. I turn off the \"All Mail\" inbox and basically archive my emails out of Mail.app and keep them on the server. I also uncheck the spam inbox. Check the \"important\" inbox to recreate the priority inbox back in Mail.\n\nA: I know that labels just won't work the same. The nearest analog to Gmail's labels in Mail.app is folders, but they're just not equivalent, and there's no way to make them equivalent. There is a plugin for Mail called MailTags, but even tags assigned in it do not trickle back to Gmail.\nArchive and delete I'm not sure about--I'm guessing that could be done, but don't know.\n", "Q: Can my Time Capsule assign an IP address based on client's MAC address?

This will open up a dialog that allows you to create a reservation via MAC Address, or \"DHCP Client ID\".\n\nFill in a system name (does not necessarily have to be the specific hostname), click MAC Address, then Continue.\n\nFill in the MAC address, choose an IP address, then click Done, and then Update the Time Capsule!\nWhen the client computer next refreshes it's IP address (most computer's do this once every two hours or so), it should pick up the new reservation, now and forever.\nAlternatively you can just shut the interface on the computer and turn it back one. Or go into Advanced and manually renew the lease. etc. etc.\n", "Q: RSS app for iPad, that support https?

I don't know for sure that it supports this, but it might be worth looking into.\n", "Q: How can I bring back the \"bounce\" when scrolling in OS X? I just system restored after a kernel panic, and I am no longer seeing this feature.  It used to be that when you scrolled (say, down this page in Firefox), there was some physics in the scroll, rather than a hard stop and start.  Since system restoring, this is gone.  How do I bring it back? I am using Snow Leopard.\n\nA: I think you may be referring to the \"Scroll with inertia\" option, which is found in System Preferences > Trackpad. If it's set to scroll with inertia, but inertial scrolling isn't working, try toggling it to \"without inertia\" then back to \"with inertia\".\nIf that doesn't work, you can try deleting the preference file, \"com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad.plist\" found in ~/Library/Preferences. Then log out, log back in and check the Trackpad preferences again.\n\nA: Look at preferences for \"Smooth scrolling\"\n", "Q: Ability to give away iOS application, usually for sale I am wondering if it's possible to do \"mass giveaways\" on the AppStore, without lowering, changing or otherwise changing the listed application.\nIs it possible to distribute hundreds to, potentially, thousands of promo codes, legally, while still leaving the \"normal\" distribution channel of purchasing the app open?\nAn example of the above would be selling physical items in a store which have a bundled digital component available. Essentially you buy a product in a store, which comes \"bundles with a free app\" (BB and Android have already been dealt with, iOS is unclear). It would be nice to give the option to have a promo code in the box, that the user can then use to get the application for free. Is this possible?\n\nA: No. Apple allows for only a very limited number of promo codes for the lifetime of an application (versions 1.0 - n.0). The exact number escapes me at the moment but somewhere around 100 comes to mind. You are allowed to have more beta testers, but that requires manual management of every user and isn't scalable should you need to go beyond your limit.\nAt the same time, there are pricing strategies you are free to implement, like free for the first 30 days, holiday and back-to-school sales, and the like.\n\nA: AFAIK promo codes must be purchased through Apple (they will cost you). Once you have the codes, you can distribute them however you like (print them on a card, post them on Twitter, etc.).\nApple keeps strict control over their distribution channels and all purchases must be done through the App Store.\nThe use of promo codes will not affect the listed price of the app.\n", "Q: Where can I find this old app: Biorhythms by Andrew Regan The most recent version if possible. Maybe you have it ?\nThe developer's site has disappeared, here's the MacUpdate page.\n\nA: You can download it right from MacUpdate, can't you?\n\nA: You can also use The Wayback Machine. I've used it on numerous occasion to download something that doesn't exist anymore.\n", "Q: What is the best Shared Calendar implementation for machines running OS X? I would like to set up a shared calendar system for our office of 4 people. Optimally, I would like all (or as many of) the features from Exchange but built in such a way that it all ties together with our Snow Leopard/Lion machines.\nWhat solution should we go with? I think these are our options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lion Server: I tried setting this up last month (after launch) and it was a disaster. It was terribly slow on our MacMini server and Wikis just stopped working suddenly, which worried me that other services (such as calendaring) would stop too.\n\n*Exchange Server: Lots of overhead and pretty much overkill, as we already have an email solution and wouldn't use the other Exchange stuff. That said, I guess you can get hosted Exchange accounts for $10/mo from RackSpace.\n\n*MobileMe: Not really shared calendar because I can't easily see a coworker's schedule.\n\n*Google calendar: No.\n\n*...?\nApple fans, help me out! What are your suggestions?\nIf I'm making incorrect assumptions or completely glazing over something please let me know!\n\nA: For a small office, you may be able to get away with using BusyCal. It works well for sharing calendars with a small workgroup. You can turn your co-workers calendars on or off so you can see them, or not, depending on your need to de-clutter your calendar. It's worked flawlessly for us with MobileMe calendar sharing, or you can set up your own CalDAV server. Free trial, excellent support. I'm a big fan.\nYou said:\n\nMobileMe: Not really shared calendar because I can't easily see a coworker's schedule.\n\nI think I need more info, as I have no problems viewing the shared schedules of the other people on our system.\n", "Q: In Lion, if I keep pressing a key, why doesn't it repeat? I don't know if there are any settings to toggle, but I figured out that if I keep pressing a button on my keyboard it doesn't repeat it and displays only one character! Can this be fixed to go back to the previous repeating behavior?\n\nA: This is a new \"feature\" that Apple introduced in Lion.  To disable no key repeat, enter \ndefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false\nin Terminal, and then restart your computer.\nSource: https://discussions.apple.com/message/15678809\n", "Q: Command+right/left stopped working On a couple occasions since I installed Lion, the keyboard shortcuts ⌘+→ and ⌘+← have stopped working to navigate to the beginning/end of a line inside text fields and such.  Any ideas what's going on?\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*My computer doesn't beep when I hit these shortcuts.\n\n*Keyboard Viewer shows that when I hold down ⌘, pressing left/right doesn't do anything.\n\n*When I hold down both ⌘ and ⇧, the arrow keys work fine.\n\n*The left and right arrow keys still work by themselves.\n\n*⌘+↑ and ⌘+↓, and ⌥+arrows still work.\n\n*⌃+A and ⌃+E still work.\n\n*I don't have any particularly weird custom keyboard shortcuts set up.\n\n*If it matters, I use 4-finger swipes and ⌃+arrows for switching desktops, two- and three-finger swipes for navigation, and three-finger swipes for Mission Control & App Exposé.\n\n\nA: I just had this problem as well, for me, this thread on apple.com worked.\nThe solution proposed there is to restart the Dock. To do so, type the following in the Terminal:\nkillall Dock\n\n\nA: I've noticed that certain applications seem to trap the gestures, even when they're no longer active.\nThe only time I've been able to 100% narrow down something trapping various shortcut keys was with either Apple Remote Desktop (the built in screen sharing functions), or Microsoft Remote Desktop.\nEven though I clicked outside of the app and started using something else, something caused notably my ctrl+←/→ to stop working.\nI unfortunately do not remember the specific steps I took to resolve the issue. Whether it was explicitly sending focus into the remote connection window, and then (with the mouse only) explicitly out of the window, and onto another app that is not just the Desktop, might have fixed the problem. Otherwise, I may have just closed the window in frustration.\nEither way, this issue is one that you may have to do some personal diagnosing to figure out. Check for any running apps that are notably not native (Java, AIR-based, etc.), or have some other form of deep integration (trapping keyboard events and sending them to another computer is pretty deep), that may be causing this issue.\n\nA: No need to restart, these steps helped me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Swipe 4 fingers up to show Mission Control\n\n*Select a full-screen app in the list of desktops\n\n*Swipe 4 fingers up to show Mission Control again\n\n*Select a text editor app on the main Desktop\n\n\nA: It’s the second time I have this problem. This first time I restarted. Today I found your question and saw your remark about finger swipes. I switched desktops (I use two-finger swiped on the Magic Mouse) and now ⌘+←/→ works again.\nI don’t know if it will work again next time, but it’s worth a try before restarting.\n\nA: I saw the answer from Olivier, and the desktop switching gesture did not solve my problem.  I ended up doing the gesture to show the mission control (for me, 3-fingers swipe up), and after that  ⌘+→ started working again.\nUpdate 12/8/2011: This has resurfaced for me again and sure enough using the gesture to show and close mission control solved it!\n\nA: I've experienced the same problem since upgrading to Lion and found that it works ok again after a system restart.\n", "Q: Lion kills application behind the scene, how to put application on a do not kill list? I am encountering an irritating feature of Lion.\nSay I spend 30 minutes in XCode, then I go to iChat to talk to my girlfriend for 5 minutes, then I switch to Safari to check StackExchange, gmail, and whatever else I might want to check.\nThen I switch to Safari where I run another set of pages. For 5 or 10 seconds, the app resumes with beachball. This is annoying as hell (switch appnames around, they behave the same). \nHow can I prevent this from happening at all (unlikely) or at least mitigate it by making a list of apps that are not allowed to go into silently-killed mode?\n\nA: You can't. Check out this thread on the Apple discussion forum. You can also read this article from TUAW.\n", "Q: How to manage tunnels as background processes from a shell script? I need to set up a couple of ssh-tunnels from a shell script. I've tried running them as bg tasks using:\n#!/bin/sh\nssh -L 3000:server1:5029 me@server2 &\nssh -L 3001:server3:3306 me@server2 &\n\nbut the tunnels don't seem to work correctly when I launch them that way. \nThey work fine when I manually set them up in their own tabs, so my next idea is to have the script open new tabs in Terminal and run the commands in there as foreground processes.\nNote: this question was originally \"How do I launch a new terminal tab from the shell and then run a command in it?\", but I got two answers about dealing with the tunnels. For the \"opening a shell\" question, I found this on SuperUser, which will work , though new tabs in the background would be preferable to the foreground windows that it opens.\n\nA: I would suggest simply integrating your tunnels into your \"one for whatever\" connection.  You can make it easy by adding the appropriate entries to your ~/.ssh/config file:\nHost server2\n    HostName 10.1.1.1\n    User me\n    LocalForward 3000 127.0.0.1:5029\n    LocalForward 3001 127.0.0.1:3306\n\nYou can then simply log in by running:\n> ssh server2\n\nThe tunnels should come up and start working, leaving you with a single SSH instance in which to do \"whatever\".  If you need to open a second connection to server2, you might get an error, though:\n> ssh server2\nbind: Address already in use\nchannel_setup_fwd_listener: cannot listen to port: 3000\nbind: Address already in use\nchannel_setup_fwd_listener: cannot listen to port: 3001\nCould not request local forwarding.\n\nThis doesn't hurt anything other than your eyes.  You can also set up these forwards for multiple servers by adding similar lines for other servers, and it would all happen automagically.\n\nA: This is technically not an answer to the question asked, but rather an answer to your problem as described.  The ssh command has two switches that may be useful to you:\nssh -f -N -L 3000:server1:5029 me@server2\n\ntells ssh to hang around in the foreground just long enough to ask for any necessary passwords, and then put itself in the background, not executing any remote command but just handling the tunnel.\nIf you really want this to appear in a tab then you may want a different solution.\n", "Q: Mac OS X Lion Terminal cursor problem Before I installed Lion opening a terminal window placed the cursor at the end of the prompt like so:\nWed Aug 31{shirsch4@Susan-Hirschs-iMac}/projects/perl/perl/lib/Utils--><cursor>\n\nNow when I open a terminal window I get the cursor somewhere in the middle of the prompt like so:\nWed Aug 31{shirsch4@Susan-Hirsch<cursor>-iMac}/projects/perl/perl/lib/Utils-->\n\nHow can I correct this?\n\nA: In Terminal > Preferences, change xterm-256color to xterm-color:\n\n\nA: The problem is that the curses package that is in charge of drawing your screen is miscounting the number of characters because your prompt contains some colour escape sequences.\nTo see this you can go echo $PS1 at the command prompt and see that it contains something like \\[\\033[34m\\] at either end. This is the colour escape sequence.\nThe answer is to tell curses the correct terminal type so that it counts properly. Do that in Terminal > Preferences > Advanced - mine is set to xterm256color but any of the xterm choices should work. Note that this setting will only apply to Terminal windows created after you change the setting not any you have open when you make the change.\n", "Q: Is there a way to protect email using passcode in iPhone?

Now you can remove the email account in the email section of your phone. When you want to do mail, sign into the gmail app, and sign back out when you're done.\n\nA: Without jailbreaking, no. You cannot in the standard Mail app, and I know of no other iOS mail clients.\n\nA: Boxer App does this. It has a free and a paid version.\nUnfortunately, in my experience, it's a bit buggy, and it doesn't support Textexpander Touch snippets.

When I turned it back on, I just got the rEFIt logo (I have rEFIt installed). Usually, it takes a moment to populate the menu with a list of bootable devices, but this time it just hung there. \nI had an Arch Linux Live DVD in the optical drive, too, and I can't make it eject or boot into Arch Linux. The optical drive whines when the macbook is powered on, but it doesn't keep spinning. This optical drive is old-ish (original to the 2007 macbook) and refused to burn CDs starting a month ago, so I've been expecting it to go any day.\nPressing down any of the boot keys (D, O, option, Command-Option-O-F, C) would just get me that blue screen you get when you're normally booting, but hung there. Target Mode and Single-User Mode don't work, either.\nThe hard drive is original to the machine, too, but I don't think the hard drive dying would interfere with the boot process. I would think I would be able to boot to the DVD if that were the case, too.\nI asked this question on AskMetafilter last night. One of the things recommended was to reset the PRAM (boot with Command-Option-P-R) and the SMC (turn the computer off, take out the battery, and hold down the power button). That worked but didn't fix my problem. Now, I don't get the rEFIt menu, just that blue screen. Holding down any of the boot keys still doesn't get me anywhere.\nWhat happened? How do I fix it?\n\nA: If I remember correctly, holding down the button on the trackpad while booting will force-eject your optical drive. Have you tried that? \n\nA: First boot holding the Option key and wait till you see a solid grey screen. This will let the system enter the boot chooser - the eject key (F12 on some keyboards) will get the optical disc out.  \nIf you don't get to the boot manager, then you can struggle with the rEFIt software or burn an Apple irmware restoration CD - do check the downloads well - I don't know which version of CD is needed for a 2,1 model. Do make a comment on the model name of your mac (early 2008) or such from http://www.apple.com/support/manuals as the apple support articles use those names over the internal model numbers. \n\nA: It's possible that your failing optical drive is flooding the logic board with errors. Take it to an Apple store or disconnect the optical drive yourself if you know what you're doing and try again. \n", "Q: Why does it take so long to sync photos for my iPod touch  in iTunes?

If there will be compatibility issues then I would prefer the Apple, but if it's just the same (like not needing to buy a SuperDrive any USB DVD reader/writer will do) can a third party one be used?\n\nA: You don't have to but your mileage will vary between the adaptors if they work or not. The Apple ones have drivers built into OS X, most of the others should work but there'll be varying levels of success.\n\nA: Try downloading this driver for a generic USB-Ethernet cable, mine was available on plugable.com - NT-USBC.\n\nA: Apple does not provide USB 3.0 gigabit ethernet adapters, but e.g. Edimax and Kanex work for Apple and have adapters made for MacBook Air and more.\n\nA: You should be able to.

Two things I really like about 10.7 are the full screen apps and the Mail client.\nIs it possible to somehow upgrade/purchase the Mail client of 10.7 alone? It would be really nice if I could do that.\n\nA: These apps (and the full screen mode) require APIs that are not available on versions prior to Lion. Even if one could purchase Mail separately, it wouldn't run.\n\nA: It's not possible, unfortunately, and copying and pasting it won't work either.

I've recently become infatuated with TotalTerminal and am tempted to switch from iTerm back to Terminal just so I can use it, except that I rely heavily on a half dozen SSH bookmarks in iTerm.\nIs there a way, or extension, to save SSH bookmarks in OSX's Terminal? (or a way to use iTerm like TotalTerminal's quick visor\n\nA: I'm not sure how SSH bookmarks work in iTerm but you can create an alias in your shell to accomplish the same thing:\n\naliases allow a string to be substituted for a word when it is used as the first word of a simple command\n\nTo set an alias in the Terminal use the following syntax:\n$ alias myserver=\"ssh user@example.com\"\nNow just run myserver in the Terminal when you want to connect to your server.\nTo make the alias permanent you have to add the alias to your login script and reload your login script for the changes to take effect. If your using the default shell, bash:\n$ source ~/.bash_profile\nMore about aliases: http://ss64.com/bash/alias.html\n\nA: Simply open the terminal app and then type Command + Shift + K from within the app. This will open a window that let's you save connections. (At least in OSX 10.9 Mavericks)\n\nA: I'm not sure what SSH bookmarks are, but you might find the SSH config file useful. I would advocate it over the alias approach.\nThis option will work in all terminal emulators, and all shells (e.g. zsh instead of bash), and even other apps that use SSH (e.g. rsync, scp, git). Also, if you synchronise your dotfiles (e.g. via a github repository), your bookmarks/alias can be shared across machines.\nYou can store host specific settings (and aliases) in:\n~/.ssh/config\n\nInstead of doing:\nssh admin@mywebsite.com\n\nYou could type:\nssh mw\n\nIf you added the following to your SSH config:\nHost mw\nHostname mywebsite.com\nUser admin\n\nYou could also setup passwordless SSH and add the location of your identify file here. A bit more secure than storing passwords, and quicker than typing it out.\nFor more info about SSH config do:\nman ssh_config\n\n\nA: There are a few different ways to create ssh command bookmarks.\nSettings Profiles with Custom Commands\nYou can create new settings profiles, each with a different ssh command. Profiles serve as both appearance \"themes\" and as \"bookmarks\" for commands and remote connections.\nGo to:\n\nTerminal > Preferences > Settings\n\nThen either create a new profile or duplicate an existing one (there's a Duplicate command in the action menu at the bottom of the profiles list) and then customize the command:\n\nTerminal > Preferences > Profiles > [profile] > Shell > Run Command\n\nEnter the desired ssh command there.\nProfiles appear in the Shell > New Window and New Tab submenus. Choose one to create a new terminal and run the associated command.\nRunning Multiple Commands at a Time with Window Groups\nIf you want to automatically create several terminals at a time (which will also run their profile commands), you can create a set of terminal windows/tabs using each profile, then save them as a window group with:\n\nWindow > Save Windows as Group…\n\nWhen you open the window group it will restore all the windows/tabs and run the commands associated with each profile. You can even tell Terminal to open a particular window group each time Terminal starts in:\n\nTerminal > Preferences > Startup\n\nImprovements in Mac OS X Lion 10.7\nIn Mac OS X Lion 10.7 this gets simpler: you can tell Terminal to remember the commands for individual windows without creating a custom profile for each one.\nIf you use the Shell > New Command or New Remote Connection commands to create terminals, the command is recorded with the window/tab. If you save them in a window group, it will automatically restore (re-run) \"safe\" commands, and there's a checkbox to tell it to restore all commands. \"Safe\" commands include anything run from the New Remote Connection dialog, any shell listed in /etc/shells, plus emacs, vi/vim, pico, nano, screen, tmux and top.\nCommand Files\nYou can save shell commands (or, indeed, entire shell scripts) in a file with the filename extension \".command\", and if you open one of these files Terminal will open a new terminal window and tell the shell to execute the commands in the file.\nSome people use these as ssh bookmarks. To make it convenient to run them, you can put them in the Dock, or a collection of them in a folder in the Dock.\nAfter creating a \".command\" file, make it executable with chmod +x /path/to/file.command.\nFunction-Key Mappings\nYou can assign arbitrary strings to the function keys in\n\nTerminal > Preferences > Profiles > [profile] > Keyboard\n\nYou can use this to conveniently enter information like host names, or entire ssh commands including a linefeed, so typing a single key will start the connection. You can also begin the string with a Control-C to discard the current command-line input if necessary, making it safer to type the key without intermingling new text with old.\nIn combination with modifier keys, this offers dozens of custom function keys you can use for arbitrary snippets or commands.\n\nA: I've been looking for a way to bookmark SSH commands and eventually I developed a Mac app for our team, called TaskTips (https://task.tips/). Basically it can save you time by indexing your SSH commands, and autocomplete when you search SSH tasks, executing tasks automatically.\nIf it is also helpful for someone else, I would be really happy about it.\n\nA: You can duplicate profiles, give them any name you want and save the login.\n", "Q: Which process is periodically writing to the disk?

When I upgraded my iphone 3gs to iphone 4 they gave me a new sim card but it was basically a replica of my old sim card (eg.same number).\n\nA: The iPhone can't actually read messages from the SIM card, you need to back it up to your machine and set the iPhone 4 up with the 3GS backup\n\nA: iPhones don't use the SIM card that way.

I'm not asking about legal issues, I'm mostly interested in how Windows will behave.

When I set up my Mac this way, I just had to activate it twice, first booting directly into Windows 7, and again after setting up Parallels to use the Boot Camp partition. \nI think I may have actually had to activate it once again the next time I booted directly in to Windows 7, but certainly after a few activations, the activations in both environments finally stuck.\n", "Q: Why does my iPad screen feel sticky? Lately, I've noticed that my iPad's touch screen feels sticky to touch which makes it difficult to swipe in a smooth motion (particular when several swipes in quick succession have to be done in quick succession). As I don't use a screen protector, I initially suspected that this could be due to the build up of oils on the screen but wiping the screen with a microfiber cloth (even with a damp one) does little to help the problem.\nThe device is 4 months old at the time of writing; the screen should still be in reasonable shape. What could be the problem here and what can I do to fix it?\n\nA: There are cleaning kits targeted for the iPad that might give you a better result than just a damp cloth. I personally bought the Hama Premium Cleaning Kit for iPad and I'm quite happy about it.\nThe second parameter in the equation are ofcourse your hands, the dryness/greasiness of your fingers will influence the comfort of the moment. Personally, I've found that just after washing my hands I feel some resistance when swiping the screen, and it works best with a more natural greasiness.\n\nA: I've found that this is particularly a problem on very hot and humid days. The touchscreen reverts to the smooth user experience that on is used to in cooler, dryer situations.\nFor people who live in countries where hot and humid weather is normal (like me!), I'd say the only solution would be to use a nice and safe screen protector on top of the touchscreen for a consistent touch experience.  \n\nA: If you decide to use a screen protector to mitigate the problem, I would suggest using a good matte/anti-glare one. In my experience, the glossy screen protectors (especially cheap ones) will make your fingers stick even worse than on a bare screen.\n\nA: Yep, i hear u. Trick I use especially after washing hands and w/ humide weather in Hawaii is to rub your nose (a naturally greasy location on most people faces) with your thumb and finger you use. Once is usually all thats needed, but sometimes a second dose helps. Korl_B\n\nA: I use CalClear deluxe cleaning kit and it is used for numerous items such as glasses, iPads, TVs, computers, etc and it works like a charm!\n\nA: I mainly use a stylus, I found after awhile this got sticky, until I tried a silicone lubricant spray. It comes in a handy spray can and is readily available from any hardware store.\nMine is WD40, but there are many brands available and many uses for it. \nDon't spray it directly onto the screen, just a little on your finger and rub evenly over the whole screen.\n\nA: Just make sure that all your fingers are dry while using iPad.\n", "Q: I have replaced my hard drive in mac book pro with SSD drive - Can I use that hard drive to replace the optical drive and have 2 disks? If I do the above will the drive need a caddy or will it just slot straight in ?\n\nA: If you have a unibody (black keyboard) MacBook Pro, then yes, you can totally use the old hard drive to replace the optical drive. In fact, I'm writing this post on a MacBook Pro with that exact set up :)\nYou'll need a caddy indeed. I'm using an OptiBay, which works fine. You can find cheaper alternatives on eBay, but I'm not sure how well they fit. However non-unibody (silver keyboard) MacBook Pros use PATA for the optical bay, and thus this won't work unfortunately.\n\nA: +1 for Kiezpro but cheaper alternatives are available from macsales and from other sellers on amazon. Check those out as well.\n", "Q: iPad can't seem to view sites / pages that include the port in the URL? I've found that the iPad, using its Safari browser can't access web pages that include a port number in the URL:\nhttp://www.example.com:8080/\nor even\nhttp://www.example.com:80/\nIn either case, the browser displays a message stating \"Cannot Open Page, Safari cannot open the page because the network connection was lost.\"\nI understand that port 80 is the default port for the HTTP protocol (443 for HTTPS) and that usually it's omitted from URL's as most (all?) browsers know to use the default (including Safari when running on Mac OS).\nBefore you ask, yes the sites are up and accessible (obviously the links above are just examples of syntax) and other devices (non-Apple phones, pads and laptops) can access the site - there is no issue with 3G / network coverage etc.\nIs this a bug with the iPad - or is it something that's configurable?\n\nA: You might want to exclude 'www' if possible. This can cause the page not being available as www mainly is pointing to port 80. If that doesn't work it might not be an Apple issue, and SuperUser might be a better place to ask the question.\nOr you could set a redirect on a url pointing it to the right location with matching portnumber.\nI can run different sites with portnumbers in it, as stated in the comments above.\nExample: Synology NAS port 5000, works on my iPad.\n", "Q: Problem of installation xcode4 and then xcode3 I install Xcode4 first in the default path /Developer then I install Xcode3 in /XCode3 It seems that the installation was not completed because I can't see Xcode.app in /XCode3/Application. What should I do?\nUpdate!\nI noticed that while I'm installing Xcode3 in the window \"Install Xcode and iOS SDK\" in path of Custom Install the check box of Xcode Toolset under Essentials is disable with unchecked status. What should I do?\n\nA: I think the way to have Xcode 3 and 3 is to install Xcode 3 first - it will be in /Developer. Then Xcode 4 install will move Xcode 3 to /Developer-old  and install Xcode 4 in /Developer. So in your case delete /Developer and start again.\n\nA: Since your question infer that you're aiming to have both Xcode 3 and Xcode 4 installed on the same Mac, your approach (described in your first paragraph) is correct that you need both to be installed in different paths.\nIn my company, to achieve your goal, the engineers \n\n\n*\n\n*first ensure the development Mac is clean (i.e. no residual libraries, receipts, etc) by executing sudo <Xcode>/Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=all\n\n*after rebooting (to ensure any libraries in memory are released and their files can be deleted by emptying the Trash), empty Trash.\n\n*install Xcode 3 in a path other than the default /Developer path.\n\n*Install Xcode 4 in a path other than the path (specified in step 3) though majority of the engineers simply install at the default /Developer path.\n\n\nThe reason why we install Xcode 4 after installing Xcode 3 is to ensure the latest supporting development binaries & tools are installed. FYI, these binaries & tools are not in your specified /Developer folder but in default paths throughout the Mac startup  partition. \nFrom your description in paragraph 2, one possibility is you have \"nested\" installation of Xcode, one on top of the other. You'll have to remove the files installed or partially installed (by Xcode installer) to return your Mac to a clean environment before running the Xcode installer again.\n", "Q: Is there a imac mail app available? Is there a mail app for imac ? Closest thing I can find is thunderbird. Something similar to the iphone mail app ?\n\nA: There's Mail.app.\nIt's built in Mac OS X since at least Tiger, works with POP, IMAP and Exchange.\n", "Q: Keychain won't remember my SSH password when connecting to server I routinely develop on two different servers.\nOne server requires my private SSH key stored in ~/.ssh/id_rsa. This part of the story works fine.\nThe other server should not require any SSH keys, yet OSX shows me this password prompt every time I connect:\n\nIt doesn't matter whether I press OK or Cancel, because there's no public key on the server. And so obviously there's no password either.\nWhy won't the password dialog remember my password in the keychain? I've checked, and an SSH item shows up in my Keychain Access app, yet the prompt still appears, every time I SFTP or SSH to the server.\nI'm guessing it might have to do with either a misconfigured server, or the fact that the username I connect with is the same for both servers. If you could confirm that the problem is either of these it would be helpful, thank you.\n\nA: There is a lot of conflicting information I've read whenever I look up information on using ssh-agent (passphrase saving/reusing process) under Mac OS X. Most resources seem to suggest that simply issuing ssh-add -K will let you store your passphrase, and will automatically configure OS X to launch ssh-agent automatically and load your stored passphrase.\nNote: Running ssh-add -K will only work if you have your private key file in one of the common locations, those locations being limited to: ~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa, ~/.ssh/identity. If the file is located anywhere else you should specify that path after the -K in the command above.\n\nThe reason you are getting the key file passphrase dialog when connecting to the second (key-less) server is likely because the default configuration of SSH servers is to use public key authentication first, and 'keyboard interactive' authentication second.\nBecause you have a public key with a standard name/location (~/.ssh/id_rsa), your OpenSSH client helpfully submits the private key in order to allow the server to match it against an allowed authorized_keys file.\nThere are a small handful of ways to prevent this, the easiest two being to pass a flag on the command line, or add it as a permanent configuration item in your ~/.ssh/config file.\n\n\n*\n\n*When connecting to the secondary/key-less server, you can add -o \"PubkeyAuthentication=no\" when connecting. Something like ssh -o \"PubkeyAuthentication=no\" me@devserver2.\n\n*Open up ~/.ssh/config in your favorite text editor, create it first if you must, and enter the following:\nHost devserver2  \n    User me  \n    PubkeyAuthentication no\n\nNow, if you simply type ssh devserver2 the username and pubkey configuration will be read in and used, and you should be prompted for your password and nothing else.\n(Note: Replace devserver2 with the actual hostname of the server. Alternatively, pick a nice hostname, such as devserver2, and add a property between User and PubkeyAuthentication called 'Hostname' and put the name or IP address of the server there. Afterwards, you actually can simply type 'ssh devserver2' and all the configuration properties will work their respective magic.)\n\nA: It seems your private key (~/.ssh/id_rsa on your local machine) is encrypted with a password, so when ssh attempts to use the key for authentication it asks you for this password.\nIf you're connecting via terminal, try ssh -o \"PubkeyAuthentication=no\" your.server.com and see whether it still prompts you.\nThat being said, Lion continues to ask me for the password to my private key all the time, and refuses to save it. I have not solved that issue yet.\n", "Q: Is it possible to have different font sizes for editing and message actually sent? Recently I switched from Thunderbird and so far really love native Mail.app which is quite lightweight to my surprise!\nHowever the transition seems a bit hard as the size of the font while editing messages is too small for me... Can I have two different font sizes - one for editing and other for actual font size with which messages are sent?\nEDIT: My os is 10.6.8, but if you know the solution for 10.7.x, please share it as well :)\n\nA: The size you set in Mail > Preferences for viewing and composing does not actually have any effect on what is seen at the other end.  To do that you have to select the font for each outgoing individually in the New Message pane (and I think also have it different than the font in Preferences).\nMail's inability to set a default outgoing font annoys many users, who sometimes then switch to Thunderbird or Entourage/Outlook instead.  Also someone did an app here:\nhttp://messagefont.com/\n\nA: You could try Universal Mailer. It is a Mail.app plugin that lets you set the default font for outgoing emails. You just need to select the font from Mail.app preference panel and the font will be forced for you when sending the email.\n", "Q: Persistent Automator Applications? I have an Application created with Automator. Since the application starts a service in the background, I'd like to keep the application open even after the end of the workflow is reached. When the user quits the application, I'd like to execute a command to stop the service. How can I achieve the above?\n\nA: I don't know of a way to make a \"stay open\" Automator app, but you could make a simple \"stay open\" AppleScript app that can launch an Automator app to start your service, then, when the user quits the AppleScript app, it can launch a 2nd Automator app to stop the service. \nSuch an AppleScript would look something like this:\non run\n    tell application \"1st Automator App\" to activate\nend run\n\non quit\n    tell application \"2nd Automator App\" to activate\n    continue quit\nend quit\n\nYou could then replace \"1st Automator App\" with the name of the Automator app that will start the service, and replace \"2nd Automator App\" with the name of the Automator app that will stop the service.\nYou would then save the AppleScript as an application with the \"stay open\" option checked.\nDepending on what else your Automator app needs to do, it may be possible to skip Automator altogether and start and stop the service directly in AppleScript.\n", "Q: How can I download the source code for iOS? I read an article that said the JailBreakMe hacker reads through Apple's source code to try to find flaws.\nI am curious and wondering: how do we get the source code for iOS?\n\nA: iOS is a derivative of Darwin OS which is an open source OS released by Apple. You can browse Apple's open source archives and download the Darwin code from their Open Source Development site. That link contains the major release archives for all the Darwin-based operating systems Apple has produced to date.\nWhat you don't get with those archives is the proprietary layers that Apple places on top of Darwin to build the shipped iOS and OS X operating systems you interact with. These include things like the GUI framework and some hardware drivers and what not. In a nutshell: you don't get the polish that makes it an Apple OS. But you do get the engine.\nYou can also gain access to the developer APIs made available by Apple by joining their iOS Developer Program. If you'd like to access the developer APIs and documentations you can enroll in the Apple Developer Program and you'll immediately be given access to beta builds of iOS as well as all the developer API docs.\nI do not believe the JailBreakMe developer (at the time of writing he has accepted an intern position at Apple) had any special level of access to the proprietary and company-secret components that make up the iOS operating system. Just the Darwin source for the releases and the developer APIs.\n", "Q: Details of the proxy address which is being used by Mac Is it possible to get the proxy address that my system is currently using in order to populate HTTP_PROXY variable from command line ?\nI would like a command so that I could set it in my .bashrc file.\ncomplete solution for me was to update my .bashrc file with this \nfunction http_proxy { \n    export http_proxy=`networksetup -getwebproxy Wi-Fi  | head -3 | tail -2  | cut -f2 -d' ' | sed 'N;s/\\n/:/'|grep -v ':0'`\n}\nalias homen=\"networksetup -setwebproxy Wi-Fi '' ;http_proxy\"\nalias ofcn=\"networksetup -setwebproxy Wi-Fi proxy.examp.com 8080;http_proxy\"\nhttp_proxy\n\n\nA: Either get ProxyConf, which does exactly this.\nOr retrieve the web proxy with networksetup -getwebproxy Ethernet (replace Ethernet with the one you're using from networksetup -listallnetworkservices), then format the output into HTTP_PROXY format:\n$ networksetup -getwebproxy Ethernet | awk '/Server:/ {host=$2} /Port: / {port=$2} END { printf \"http://%s:%s\", host, port}'\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8228\n\nIf your network services (Ethernet, Wifi, etc.) vary or you use multiple at the same time, you may need to get a little more elaborate to figure out which one is being used. man networksetup and man ifconfig should have everything you need if you want to go there.\nFormerly there was also scselect, but networksetup incorporates all of it's functionality.\n", "Q: How can I remove unwanted apps, such as Chess or Address Book, from my Mac? There are a lot of applications that I have no use for that take up space on my Mac that I want to delete. \nWhen ever I try to delete them it says that it is an essential part of the OS but with Chess.app, I find that reason specious at best.\n\nA: Everyone knows the damage that comes with the use of sudo. However, it will help out for this situation.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your terminal and go to the Applications directory.\n$ cd /Applications\n\n\n*To view your currently installed apps\n$ ls\n\n\n*Locate the application desired to be deleted\n>>>WITH CAUTION<<<\n$ sudo rm -rf application.name\n\nThis will force to recursively remove application.name directory and all sub directories. Again, this operation is permanent and cannot be undone. If you are unsure of the application that you are removing then you probably shouldn't.\n\nA: While experimenting a bit further, I think that I may have solved the problem without using Terminal, which I have no experience with.\nI selected the unwanted application, got information on it, unlocked the Sharing and Permissions, and changed every listed user name to be able to read and write. I then closed the \"Get Info\" window and selected the application again and control-clicked it and chose the \"Move to Trash\" command.\nThis successfully moved the chosen application to the Trash where I was able to delete it without getting the window saying that the application was necessary to the operating system. I was not able to do this by only changing the permissions for my user account. It was necessary to change all of the user account permissions.\n\nA: Select the application you would like to remove and Get Info on it, either Command + i or from the Menu File>Get Info.\nAt the bottom of the resulting window, in the Sharing & Permissions section, change the \"everyone\" setting to \"Read & Write\". You will probably have to click the lock in the lower right corner first and authenticate as an administrator.\nOnce the setting is change, close the Get Info window.\nYou should be able to move the application to the Trash without any trouble.\n\nA: The games don't take up that much space and if you don't bother trying to delete the applications now, you may save yourself the time in working out how to delete these 'unwanted' apps and also saved the time required to fix your installation later. \nPlus, I wouldn't be surprised if during a later software update Mac OS tries to reinstall some of these applications. Then you may have to delete them all over again.\n\nA: I would recommend NOT deleting any apps native to the OS.  Deleting these apps now may seem harmless, but you  never know when that will bite you down the road.  Software update and other update look for those during the update process, and trying to put such apps back can get complicated.\nGo to the Apple site and try to find with app to download.  The only place you will find them is in the OS installation package.\nYou are better off by far doing the Monolingual thing, and using an external drive for data storage, if your data is that large.\nIt's false economy to skimp on drive space.  You will pay dearly in the end, somewhere down the road.\n\nA: That warning is there for a reason for that warning, I wouldn't suggest deleting those apps since they don't take up much space anyway... if your really tight on space try an app like Monolingual which can delete unused languages and incompatible binaries (duplicates of programs made to run on older Macs). The 2 combined will save you several gb off your lion hard disk\n", "Q: OS X assumes hostname of other network computer: how to prevent this? I just came across a strange quirck:\nI use my MacBook Pro in the office. Every computer is assigned their IP addresses by a DHCP server. It seems to be the case now, however, that my OS X changed my hostname by itself.\nI am assuming this is done because of the fact that my current IP address was previously used by the user with this hostname, but obviously, I don't want OS X to change my hostname without asking me to do so.\nHow can I prevent this from happening?\n\nA: This issue has been going on for years, and there is no way to \"fix\" it on the Mac.\nWhat happens is the machine gets an address from DHCP, and then performs a reverse DNS lookup to see if there is a hostname associated with the IP in DNS.\nIf you are on a Windows network, all of the Windows machines are automatically registered in DNS when they connect to the Domain.\nI went on and on with the techs at Apple about this... There is little that you can do at the level of your Mac.  It becomes an issue for your network administrator, and since there is nothing really wrong, he/she is likely to leave things as they are.\n", "Q: How to downgrade from iOS 4.3.5 to iOS 4.2.1? Just got a defect report that application is crashing in iPhone3GS using iOS 4.2.1. No problems with iPhone3GS using iOS 4.3.5 or iPhone4 using iOS 4.1.\nQuestion: How can I downgrade some device to iOS 4.2.1? Actually trying to upgrade iPhone4 running iOS4.1 to 4.2.1 using \"restore\" feature, if that makes any difference. Btw that device has never been upgrades, since iOS 4.1 was defined as lowest supported version.\nFound iOS 4.2.1 restore file for iPhone4 using google. Trying to install it gives error note:\nThe iPhone \"Device Name\" could not be restored.\nThe device isn't eligible for the requested build.\n[More Information / OK]\n\nWhen following the More Information link I get to page with a checkilist. Here's my answers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, I'm admin\n\n*Using iTunes 10.4.1, which is latest available. Too new?\n\n*Using Snow Lion 10.6.8, but I guess this should be enough\n\n*No other USB devices connected\n\n*Security settings should be ok, this computer has never been used for jailbreaking\n\n\niPhoneUpdater log says something about \"iTunes: Restore error 3194\" and that \"can't find SSOClient.framework\". First is according to google related to jailbreaking i.e. some redirection. I don't think that's the problem here (at least etc/hosts file is clean, no changes there). No idea what the second error note means or whether it's just a side-effect of the first one.\nLaptop is using Point Check harddisk encryption, but that shouldn't interfere in this way either. Right? Trying DFU mode didn't either help, not able to install 4.2.1.\nWhat could be the problem? What could I try next? Is jailbreaking REALLY the only possible solution... Why would Apple want me to do that? No, forget the last question.\nI'm using the device ONLY for development and got it (as well as the laptop) from customer. Could there be something about my login username not being allowed to update firmware, since device was first time used/registered/whatever by another username maybe in different machine?\n\nA: Firstly, search Google for \"download ios 4.2.1\" and download the correct version for your device. If it's in a zip, unzip it, but you should end up with an .ipsw file.\nOpen iTunes and select your device on the left. Shift-Click (or Option-Click on Mac) on 'Restore' and select the file you downloaded.\nThis should allow you to install whichever version of ios you have the .ipsw for\n\nA: If you have not got your SHSH for iOS 4.2.1 (it could be saved only if you have ever jailbroken your device), then Apple will reject downgrade the version of iOS.\n\nA: I think the only way to go backwards through the versions is to unlock/jailbreak it.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/2787671?start=0&tstart=0\nIt looks like some can downgrade using \"TinyUmbrella\", however I am sure this is not supported by Apple. Perhaps some people can downgrade using just iTunes (depending on various factors) and some cannot.\n", "Q: System Preferences crashes when trying to open time setting My System Preferences are crashing when I try to open time setting on my mac.

How it got out of whack is going to be tricky to solve, Unless you are good at understanding Console messages.  You could try typing Crash in the Console filter blank to see what might snow up.\nThe 2 steps above are what I would use to attempt a repair.\nThe next 2 steps are more time consuming, but may be required:\nA)  Download and re-install the Combo update for your OS.\nB) Reinstall the OS, then the Combo update.\nYour settings and data are safe in both cases UNLESS you \"erase and install\".  That would require complete backup beforehand to save important data/files.\n\nA: If you haven't tried creating a new user and checking if it also crashes in that user's account, I would suggest trying that.\nYou could try moving the following preference files out of ~/Library/Preferences/ then log out and back in and see if it still crashes.\ncom.apple.HIToolbox.plist\ncom.apple.menuextra.clock.plist\ncom.apple.systempreferences.plist\ncom.apple.systemuiserver.plist\n\n(These are all the preference files I found that seem to be related to date & time, but there could be more.)\n", "Q: Root access is gone on Lion Server 10.7.1 after update from 10.7 Under 10.7.0 Server I was able to activate the root user and I was able to login to my Mac Mini Server i7 as root.\nNow after I did the update to 10.7.1 Server, this capability has disappeared .

I am currently developing an iOS application. I'm considering not supporting anything less than iOS 3.1. I was wondering, can I expect a huge backlash from customers that buy this application and try to use it on devices that haven't been updated in years?\n\nA: You can find Marco Arment's stats on iOS version he collected from his Instapaper app (as CanuckSkier say in the comment, Instapaper is generally used by tech-savvy people, so \"real\"-people usage might be slightly less).\nHere's a graph: \n\nAs you can see, at least 98% of users are already on iOS 4.0 and 96% on 4.2. So I guess you can safely stop supporting iOS 3.x.\n\nA: Just to add to the good data already available, here's some June 2011 data from a free, \"who buys the next round\" app, which may be a bit more representative than Instapaper:\n\nWhile not quite as high as the percentage of Instapaper users, more than 95% on iOS 4 suggests you won't be missing out on a big number of users.\n\nA: You can check for yourself.  Look in the iTunes app store for popular apps which cater to the same customer demographic as yours, and which only run on later OS versions (3.2, or 4.1 or later).  Check the reviews for those apps, and see the proportion of negative comments they get for not supporting such-and-such.\nUsually the amount is tiny, as users of older devices, and people who don't update their OS, don't buy as many apps as people who have the latest devices and/or upgrade their OS.  Many popular and highly rated apps are only compatible with very recent OS versions.\nSo, no huge backlash.\n\nA: This is more of an opinion answer, but I suspect that the number of people with old iOS versions will decrease as time goes on, whereas the number of people with up-to-date iOS versions will increase a lot, both as more people buy iOS devices and as iCloud makes software updates easier (no iTunes required) and faster (delta updates).\nTime spent supporting even 3.1 is worth less as time goes on, whereas time spent focusing on the new features in later versions pays off now, and keeps paying off.\n", "Q: Can I select the architecture of a program from the command line?

And pretty. Maybe I'm expecting too much, but the fact that the last update to the app occurred June 23rd 2011 gives me pause. It's almost September. Then again, if the app works and is mature, that's not important. But that is rarely the case.\nThe Mac App only has a single review in the Swiss App Store, and it's one star. User says the UI for entering new notifications is terrible. That it's so bad he's actually faster doing it on the iPhone, defeating the whole purpose of a Mac client.

Or let me know what the reviews in the US look like? iPhone app reviews are also pretty mixed with an average of 3.5 stars out of 29 reviews.\n\n*http://notificant.com/\nI'm not sure what's up here, but this doesn't even show up when I search for it on appshopper.com.

I have MS Outlook installed on both my Mac and (work)PC. If I add a task, reminder, to-do on either of these three devices, iCloud makes sure it's present on all three devices. If I've set an alarm, I get a push notification on my iPhone and a pop-up window on my PC/Mac.\nIt's fast, it's easy and it's free!   \nYou just need a copy of Outlook (but I guess you can figure something out :))\n", "Q: Using three-finger drag and three-finger back on browser For OS X Lion 10.7, is there a way that I can use three-finger drag and still be able to use gestures to swipe \"back\" in Firefox or Chrome?\nI've found out how to do one or the other, but not both.\n\nA: You cannot use both.

Even after moving to the Trash, the directory PWD doesn't update path (with trash/tmp path)\nView the complete screencast (5.20 min / ~24mb)\nIs there a way to synchronize the command line with Finder for this scenario?\n\nA: In a nutshell, yes, this behaviour is expected. It's less than ideal but it's completely explainable and it's a biproduct of how files and directories are represented on the filesystem level.\nIt helps to understand how files and directories are represented on the underlying filesystem via inodes. And how moving a file on the same filesystem doesn't actually change the file blocks, it just shuffles the inode metadata around.\nLets step back a bit though and make sure we understand that: when you delete a file via Finder you're (for the most part) not actually deleting it. You're just moving it to a trash location that's on the same logical partition as the file. That the trash location is on the same partition is important. It lets the OS exploit the inodes to make the delete really, really fast.\nNow lets talk about inodes. For regular files, inodes hold the metadata for the file along with some pointers to the data blocks on the filesystem that actually hold the data for the file. The metadata is stuff like the creation date, the last accessed date, the owner and group, the permissions settings, etc.\nFor directories the inode holds all that metadata plus it holds a pointer to a list of all the inodes that are \"in\" that directory. So if I \"move\" a file on a filesystem all I'm doing is taking a reference to that file's inode out of its current directory's inode file list and moving it to another directory's inode file list. The list changed, but the inode reference to the file didn't.\nThis metadata shuffle means that the physical location of the file blocks and the inode for the file itself don't actually change on disk. Any program currently accessing the file (assuming file locking isn't being used) can continue to access it even while I'm moving it because all the references it needs have remained the same. The inode for a file or directory doesn't change as long as it's kept on the same filesystem. And when programs access files and directories, most of that access is done via inode references.\nPretty neat.\nBut it can lead to some jarring behaviour if you're accessing a directory from multiple places and then you move the directory. And this is what you're experiencing.\nIn your case you have a Terminal prompt in a directory. When you changed in to that directory your shell read the inode metadata for that directory and updated some data structures and environment variables. One of those environment variables was the PWD variable.\nThen you deleted the directory which placed that directory's inode under the .Trash directory's file list. The metadata for these two inodes was updated so the deleted directory now had a parent directory metadata attribute that points to .Trash and the .Trash inode metadata got a new entry in its list of children: the deleted folder's inode. But your Terminal app didn't know this happened. There's nothing that told it that it should reload its data structures. That's why pwd and $PWD continue to show the original path to the directory. You have to trigger an action in the shell that causes that inode metadata on the working directory to be re-read and the data structures and environment variables to be re-generated. It can be something as simple as called cd . to do a no-op change directory. Or you can move out and back in to the directory with absolute paths.\nThe reason the reason that cat in the Terminal works to show you a file in that directory is that the inode that cat uses to access that file didn't change just because its location on disk changed. So cat can still find it given you're using a relative reference to the file. If your file was originally located at /foo/bar/moo.txt and you tried to do cat /foo/bar/moo.txt after you deleted the bar directory via Finder you'd see that the cat call would fail with a file-not-found error. But cat moo.txt would continue to work because all the file system data structures that cat needs to use to find moo.txt in your working directory have technically not changed enough for cat at your Terminal prompt to lose track of them.\nThat's the long explanation. Hope I didn't lose you. :)\n\nA: I believe this is an expected behavior. Although PWD doesn't update the path right away, if you do something else like cd .. or even cd . you can see that the path gets updated.\n\nA: Moving something to the Trash in Finder does exactly this, it just moves the file/folder to a special directory (conveniently names .Trash). In Terminal.app you are working on Unix level and can still access the folder as usual. Once you empty the Trash it's gone for good.\n", "Q: Where does Mac OS X store the ssh passwords?

And there are quite a few of them: Start Session, copy files, close session.\nNow my guess it that the system is trying to log in with the old password and is not storing the new one after I enter is. Correct me if I am wrong.\nNow could anybody tell me where in the key chain Mac OS X is storing the passwords.\nAnd yes, I have a public key set up as well. That is what I used when I was still using Linux. But that does not work either.\n\nA: Mac OS X doesn't store passwords for the command-line ssh client. It can however remember the password to your private key in the Keychain if you are authenticating via keys.\n\nA: I am not familear with what Source Forge may be doing... but were you required to generate a key-pair and install them in your source forge account?  Some git repositories work in this manner...   \nIf that is the case you will need to delete the old keypair and generate a new pair... \nI don't know if I am going off the deep end here, and will provide instructions if this is the case.\nWhat files are available in ~./ssh  ?\nLet me know.\n\nA: you might try looking at Keychain Access, an application in /Applications/Utilities\n", "Q: How do I wirelessly stream my movies to my projector? I love using my Airport Express to wirelessly play my music.\nI have a projector at home, and I would like to wirelessly play my movies, which were not downloaded with iTunes.\nI was considering purchasing an AppleTV for this purpose. Do you think it is a good solution for my material which is not iTunes-related? \n\nA: The streaming of music and video to Apple TV is quite remarkable in my book. Having Safari on the iPad, iPhone seeing the AppleTV as a target for many video types is still like magic to me.\nNot everything streams, but if it's HTML5 video or something you don't mind placing under iTunes's purview - it's a great solution. As AirPlay gets more prevalent, the web sites that will allow this should grow over time. With media you control, it's ready to go with perhaps a re-encode if it's not something the Apple TV expects to play out of the gate.\n\nA: Depends a lot on what file formats you've got and what sort of quality you're expecting. If your library is mostly h.264 format (typically mp4, m4v, and most mkv files) then the Apple TV should work pretty well for you.\nAnything in an mkv container will need to be converted to an mp4/m4v container, but that can be done losslessly most of the time (i.e. no transcoding of video, just extracting the component streams and muxing them into an mp4 container - you may need to transcode the audio, but that's easy and quick to do).\nIf you have a lot of non-h.264 stuff (i.e. anything in .avi, DIVX, etc.), you'll need to transcode it, which means losing some quality and can use up a fair bit of CPU power. You can transcode ahead of time using a tool like Handbrake, or you can try transcoding on-the-fly, which requires less planning ahead, but for HD files you'll need a pretty beefy CPU, and the process is pretty haphazard. You can view the steps for doing that in my answer to Can I stream any video played with VLC player to Apple TV ?\nTranscoding ahead of time also has the advantage of being able to use iTunes as a library, so you can access the files directly from the Apple TV. This applies to other files as well - if you can get them in iTunes compatible format (basically any mp4/m4v as above), your life will be a lot easier, as you can access them directly from the Apple TV, rather than going to your computer and streaming them to the Apple TV.\nFinally, if you weren't aware of this already, you will need a computer running iTunes on at all times you want to access your library, unless you're playing files from the iTunes Store or Netflix.\n\nA: My suggestion is yes, get the Apple TV as I think AirPlay will become a huge part of Apple's living room strategy going forward. \nI've found a somewhat convoluted yet surprisingly effective way of streaming videos to my Apple TV from my computer, as long as you have an iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch. Get yourself the fantastic $2.99 Air Video app. This app, coupled with a free client app you install on your Mac, streams movies from your Mac to any iOS device. You tell the client app which folders to share, and from your iOS device, you see those folders and all of the videos contained within them.\nNow, and here's the best part. It does live transcoding to your iOS devices. It supports all sorts of file types: avi, mkv, xvid, you name it. This transcoding works incredibly well, and I've never noticed any sort of stutter or any problems when viewing videos from a 2009 MacBook Pro. So no manual transcoding, or setting up some VLC transcoding functionality.\nThe even better part is that now, Air Video supports AirPlay. So, you can beam videos from your computer, to your iOS device, to your TV, all while being transcoded live and being controlled from your iOS device. This setup works great, with again, virtually no lag or stutter over a standard 802.11n network.\nOne caveat, I'm sure there's some sort of quality loss, and I haven't done any detailed comparison or anything to see what that loss is. Everything looks pretty good to my eyes, though my 40\" TV is smaller than a projector. But give it a try, as again, it makes watching videos from your computer to TV incredibly fast and simple.\n\n", "Q: Select All shortcut key Command+A no longer works This morning, I found out that the Command+A shortcut key for selecting all failed to work. I have gone into the keyboard shortcuts preference and did not find anything useful. Is there any suggestion on what to do to fix or at least troubleshoot my problem? Any help is appreciated.

I develop on Mac (Lion) with Eclipse and GlassFish 3.1. GlassFish uses ports 8080 and 4848. Suddenly, when I try to launch GlassFish it tells me it can't because there's a port conflict.\nAs far as I can tell, nothing is using that port. I shut down everything and restarted the Mac and still get the same error when I ran GlassFish. I uninstalled GlassFish, deleted all the directories, restarted my machine, reinstalled GlassFish and same problem.\nI created a new test user on my Mac, log out as me, log in as him, install GlassFish under that users account and it runs fine there.\nIt's like there's something in my user account that makes my Mac or GlassFish think that port is in use.\nDoes anyone know how I might solve this problem? I hate the idea of having to create a new account on my Mac and transfer all of my data there. Seems like an excessive solution.\n\nA: NMAP will provide a listing of open ports and programs that are currently using them. It is actually a powerful networking tool that can perform a wide variety of network maintenance tasks.\nYou can read more about it here: http://nmap.org/book/inst-macosx.html\nIt is a small commandline utility (although GUI front-ends are available) that is quite easy to use and should give you a detailed view of your current network state.\n\nA: You can use lsof -i TCP:8080. The only problem, I think, is that it will find out that Java is using that port; if you kill that java process, you still won't be able to start Glassfish.\nMy solution is to delete all the domains in the glassfish directory, and then delete the Glassfish server, and installing a new one with a new domain.\nFor me it's a domain issue.\n\nA: netstat -nap would also work. If the process isn't your own you'll need to use sudo. It'll list out all the open ports, with their status, and the PID of the owning process.\nSomething like:\nsudo netstat -nap | grep 8080\n\n", "Q: Permissions error when exporting slideshow as a movie in iPhoto I recently upgraded to Lion. \nNow when I try to export an iPhoto slideshow as a QuickTime movie it goes through the initial rendering process but an error message appears with the iPhoto logo saying that I don't have permission for this task. \n\nA: I've seen some people report issues with permissions and the desktop and/or other user folders.

Not easily anyway.  I am sure somebody could hack something together, and it would involve opening up the case of the Dell, and possibly the Mac.\nHowever, you could use VNC on the Dell, to view what the Mac Mini is \"displaying\" \nI don't think you can use the Kick Start utility to start the screen sharing service on the Mac Mini, so you will need to borrow a monitor form somewhere to get the Mac set up in the first place... \nThen, after setting up the Mac, go to System Preferences -> Sharing, and set up Screen Sharing.  Also you will need to allow computers using VNC to connect to it.  It's all there is the settings pane.\nThen...  You will use VNC on your ubuntu box (ick, don't use Windows) and connect to the Mac using it's IP address.  You will be able to view and control the mac, from the Dell's monitor, Keyboard, and Mouse.\nThere will be some lag...  such is life with VNC...\n\nA: I think that based on the HDMI ports you can in fact use a Mac mini to your advantage.\n", "Q: Can you pair Mac AND iPad with same Apple Wireless Keyboard? Can you pair both a Mac and an iPad 2 with the same Apple wireless keyboard, but not at the same time?  Or do you have to un-pair one, and then pair it with the other?\n\nA: Yes you can.\nFirst, make sure Bluetooth is turned off on your iPad. And enable it on your Mac (make sure the box that says \"discoverable\" is checked). Then turn on your keyboard and follow the steps to pair it using the Keyboard System Preference pane. Once the keyboard is paired, uncheck \"discoverable\" (which should remain off unless you wish to pair another device) and then turn off Bluetooth.\nNext, head over to your iPad and enable bluetooth. Turn your keyboard off (hold the power button till the light glows and then dims). Turning it on again will get the iPad to pick it up and a prompt will ask you to enter a 4-digit sequence of numbers and the \"ENTER\" key. Follow the steps. Once that is done, it will be paired.\nTo use the keyboard on the iPad, make sure the device has bluetooth enabled and that your Mac has that service disabled (you should disable the service before trying to connect the keyboard to the other device).\nI just tested it using my Mac and my iPhone 4 and it works perfectly. Sometimes the device takes a second attempt to locate the keyboard, but it does indeed work.\n\nA: For those who are looking to do follow the accepted solution with the Apple Magic Keyboard: it is not possible. As @bmike points out, the firmware of the keyboards remembers the last paired device: Can you pair macOS and iOS device with same Magic Keyboard and switch between them?\n\nA: Back in 2011 it was possible: https://www.scottallen.com/2011/04/how-to-use-a-bluetooth-keyboard-with-two-devices/ with the above technique.\nIn the context of 2020, your best bet is to pair the current apple keyboard (and trackpad!) with your iPad while just connecting them to your more stationary device with their lightning cables.  Of course, the lightning cables also works with the iPad so you could reverse the situation.\nAlso, if you find yourself connecting your ipad and keyboard to the same USB hub which is then connected to your paired computer, the iPad \"wins\" and your keyboard will then control your iPad.  This will not break the last pairing and will go back to connecting via bluetooth to the last paired device.\n\nA: I had the same problem; I also did not know how to make the BT device undiscoverable. What I did was removed my keyboard device from my iMac (Go to System Preference and then to Bluetooth) by clicking the cross icon when you select the device. I then turn on BT on my iPad, waited a while and the two got connected without a problem. Hope this helps.\n\nA: Paul above notes that there is a problem with iMacs if they are using only a Bluetooth keyboard. I don't know if there is an easy solution to this. I have the same issue, but I also have a separate wired keyboard, and a separate wired mouse which I can connect if I need to reconfigure the wireless keyboard, mouse or trackpad.\nI only do it relatively infrequently, so not too big a problem, but if I did it a lot it would be. I have bought another cheap keyboard in the hope that I will then not have to swap between machines too often.\n", "Q: How to get Finder in Lion to set group permissions to read/write by default? To have group permissions set to read/write by default in Snow Leopard and Leopard, I used /etc/launchd-user.conf to set the umask to 002.\nThis still works in Lion in every app except the Finder. Actually, Lion's Finder does apply the umask when setting permissions, but if the group (or everyone) bit is set to zero, the Finder will treat it like it's a 2, which makes new folders' group permissions read only.\nOut of curiosity, I did try using the old technique I used in OS X 10.4, using the defaults command to set the umask and NSUmask, but that doesn't work (which was expected).\nI'm hoping to find a solution without having to use ACLs.\nDoes anyone know of another way to get the Finder in Lion to set group permissions to read/write by default?\n\nA: You can use BatChmod for setting permissions of files. You can also use it to chmod a batch of files. Download link: http://download.cnet.com/BatChmod/3000-2248_4-19574.html\n", "Q: Can a Mac's airport card run 802.11 N, G, B or A only?

Might alternative drivers be available or some developer testing tool to exert this level of control over the WiFi chipsets in Macs.\nI want to force this on the mac end for cases where I can't control the base stations or want to test a specific channel of a simultaneous dual band router that is live with other traffic.\nmac:bin mike$ airport --scan\n                            SSID BSSID             RSSI CHANNEL HT CC SECURITY (auth/unicast/group)\n                     na ala hele 00:26:36:9c:32:23 -59  2       Y  US WPA(PSK/TKIP/TKIP) WPA2(PSK/AES,TKIP/TKIP) \n                     na ala hele 00:26:bb:79:23:1f -59  2       Y  US WPA(PSK/TKIP/TKIP) WPA2(PSK/AES,TKIP/TKIP) \n                fast na ala hele 00:26:bb:79:23:20 -74  149,+1  Y  US WPA(PSK/TKIP/TKIP) WPA2(PSK/AES,TKIP/TKIP) \nmac:bin mike$ airport --getinfo\n     agrCtlRSSI: -75\n     agrExtRSSI: 0\n    agrCtlNoise: -86\n    agrExtNoise: 0\n          state: running\n        op mode: station \n     lastTxRate: 81\n        maxRate: 300\nlastAssocStatus: 0\n    802.11 auth: open\n      link auth: wpa2-psk\n          BSSID: 00:26:bb:79:23:20\n           SSID: fast na ala hele\n            MCS: 4\n        channel: 149,1\nmac:bin mike$ ls -l /usr/local/bin/airport \nlrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  89 Sep 13 11:40 /usr/local/bin/airport -> /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport\n\n\nA: Maybe this help, you can access to the airport command utility with\nsudo ln -s /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport /usr/sbin/airport\n\nThen, type\nsudo airport en1 prefs JoinMode=Strongest JoinModeFallback=KeepLooking\n\nJoinMode = Ranked and JoinModeFallback = Prompt are the defaults, if you want to switch back\n\nA: If you just want to check whether the base station is sending on the right channel, Kismac may be of use to you. This will show all modes that your Airport card supports, including dual-band base stations. It's also great for checking wi-fi coverage with the built-in signal monitor, which can chart signal strength as you walk around with laptop in hand.\n\n\n\nA: From my understanding, I think this is only possible at the router level. So that router's will only accept \"X\" traffic, and not at the broadcast level (your NIC).

My PSD's are never color managed. This is the way I've designed since I can remember and I have always had great results. Until now.\nI'm designing an iPad interface and while my blues are blue in Photoshop and soft blue/greys are soft blue/grey - saving as a PNG (not converting to sRGB), emailing them to my ipad and previewing them in the Photo app makes my blues dull and my soft blue/greys more like a brown grey.\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: Well, using the monitor profile in Photoshop means the colors in your file is right on only one device on the planet, which is your monitor. To make it more universal, you need to convert the colors in your file to a device-independent profile like Adobe RGB.\nIn color management world, you can only assign or convert colors. Assigning doesn't change the numbers in your file, but changes the appearance of colors. Converting changes the numbers in your file, but tries to preserve the appearance of colors as much as possible. Thus, in your case, you need to convert colors to either Adobe RGB or sRGB, which is a bit more dull-looking saturation-wise, but is more stable from one device to another. And by device here I mean devices like monitors.\nNow I don't know what profile is the iPad using by default to display colors onscreen, but I would assume that it is either Adobe RGB or sRGB. It could be a custom profile, but this is difficult to know. But I assume also that Apple has built support for color management in iOS, aka ColorSync.\nTry either of them and let me know if it helps.\nBtw, you could improve your workflow by assigning Adobe RGB to new documents from now on, as it is device-independent, and then convert them to a destination profile that matches the target device. It's just a suggestion, but a well calibrated and well profiled monitor and an Adobe RGB based workflow in Photoshop (or any other image editing app) can get you a long way. \nThe logic and science behind color management is extremely complex, but using it is very simple and constant. :-)\n\nA: 2017 update: Display P3 Macs will display incorrect colours if you use the strategy below. I should write more about the setup required for the 5K iMacs and 2016 MacBook Pros.\nYou're well on track if you use \"Don't Color Manage This Document\" for your PSDs. That's part of the issue solved. And by disabling \"Convert to sRGB\" in the Save For Web window, you've solved another big issue (profile conversion on export shifting colours).\nEmailing photos isn't really the best way to do on device previews though. If you can, use something else (there's a few apps that do it).\niOS devices have a gamma that's identical to OS X and Windows, so the main difference you're seeing is a difference in the display and their profile. Do not listen to anyone who thinks you should be assigning a colour profile in Photoshop or trying to saving colour profiles in exported images — they don't know what they're talking about. PNGs and other image formats have their embedded colour profiles ignored by iOS at runtime (in some cases, Xcode may display with colour management, so you should make sure you test on the device itself, or at the very least, in the iOS Simulator).\nThe real goal when designing app interfaces is to perfectly match the colours displayed on screen in Photoshop and saved in files with what’s displayed in other applications, including the iPhone Simulator. You want the colours to not just look the same, but the actual values saved into files to match the colours we defined in Photoshop perfectly.\nSo what you're after is for colour values entered into Photoshop (i.e. #FF0000) to remain that value on in the PSD, in the exported PNG and to be on the device, in memory as #FF0000.\nIt's possible and actually not that difficult.\nFull instructions can be found here (I'm the author of the article, I hope it's ok to post it here):\nhttp://bjango.com/articles/photoshop/\nHowever, the displays found on various iOS devices (even of the same generation/type) can be subtly or quite different. The absolute best way to get good results is to do realtime device testing, using an appropriate app for that (and one that knows enough about this stuff to get it right).\n", "Q: Process \"mtmfs\" is using 98% of cpu, heating up the core and runing the fans flat out Process \"mtmfs\" is using 98% of cpu, heating up the core and runing the fans flat out.\nI have quite the process through activity monitor, but does anyone know a longer term solution?\nI am running a MacBook Pro 2.2 GHz Intel Core i7 with 8GB RAM and OS 10.7.1\n\nA: Presumably you're using Time Machine?  mtmfs is Mobile Time Machine file system daemon.  Have you tried disabling Time Machine?\n\nA: I was running a search on EasyFind and forgot about it - started up Clean My Mac 2 - this is when mtmfs started cranking up my CPU/fan. I quit EasyFind and the CPU % went down immediately. Took a few minutes for fan to slow down. I think maybe the two programs running a thorough search at the same time did it.

With Snow Leopard one chose the number of Spaces before hand (in preferences); in Lion one must create spaces one by one. Are there shortcuts to create & remove Spaces/Desktops?\n\nA: At the moment there is not shortcut to add/remove spaces in Lion\n\nA: I'm assuming that your question is just as it reads, that you want to find the fastest way to add/remove Desktops.\nBy default, Mission Control is invoked by hitting F9.\nSpaces are now called Desktops in Lion.  I will not comment on that change.\nIf you hit F9, then moving the cursor over each Desktop should give you an \"X\" in the upper left corner of that Desktop, allowing you to click on that X and remove the Desktop.  I believe you maybe required to remove the highest numbered Desktop first.\nYou also may run into trouble if you have assigned apps to Desktops, and try to remove the Desktop without first re-assigning the apps.\nIn that same F9 window, there should appear a translucent square in the upper right corner.  It will have a \"+\" in it, allowing you to add a Desktop.\nI believe these are as close to a shortcut as you will find native to the OS.  It's not really lot of effort to hit F9, and you are there.  I don't know how much faster you could make it without causing problems elsewhere.\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: I haven't found a way to add a desktop via a shortcut, but you can call Mission Control through any way you choose, not just default F9. Open Sys Prefs > Mission Control on the top row. Set your modifier keys, plus whatever you want to you.\nAs for switching, Control + Arrow lets you slide through each desktop && fullscreen app.\nI find switching via keyboard much easier, but creating desktops with a mouse to be prefereable than the old Spaces. \n", "Q: Open .theme file in Mac OS X Snow Leopard I've done a brilliant stupidity...\nI have a Jailbroken iPhone and have iFile on that.

Possibly over FireWire or so, something that I could plug a monitor (or two) into but ideally does some of the work that would normally all be lumped onto the laptop CPU/GPU.\nProbably a far-fetched idea, but it would save me buying a desktop PC as well as my laptop. I am currently using a cheap USB to DVI adaptor, which works ok, but is noticeably slower and obviously adds a bit of load on to my laptop.\n\nA: The answer is no (correctly answered by @JFW), this is not possible using Firewire because the protocol simply does not provide the required bandwidth. However, when the day comes you purchase a machine equipped with Thunderbolt, continue reading.\nSonnet recently announced the release of several \"add-on\" components that make use of a Mac's thunderbolt port. These include a RAID assembly, an ExpressCard, and even a PCIe expansion bay, that can accept any PCI Express 2.0 adapter card.\nSonnet's product listing: http://www.sonnettech.com/product/thunderbolt/\nVillage Instruments one-upped them by committing themselves to manufacturing exactly what you're in the market for. However, before you jump for joy, you might want to head over and have a read. While the card will outperform integrated cards provided by the lower end MBPs, they still aren't up to snuff compared to some of the bigger cards available for PCs.\nHead on over and have a gander: http://www.extremetech.com/computing/92160-external-thunderbolt-graphics-card-for-macs-will-not-blow-you-away\nSo even with Thunderbolt, it is possible, it may not give you the bang for your buck you're hoping for.\n\nA: No external GPUs currently that are (fast enough) for gaming. Monitor is possible, but you need an express card for that, and only the 2008 unibody versions of the 15\" MacBook Pros have it. \nI don't think FireWire is fast enough, and Thunderbolt is probably the only interface right now that would realistically be possible for an external GPU to run from.\nSorry. :(\n(I also researched into this subject myself a few years back, looking for a way to increase the gaming capabilities of my MacBook Pro. No solution, unfortunately.)\n\nA: Xcode features a distributed build architecture. The Final Cut software uses QMaster distributed rendering for this sort of acceleration. It's very doable based on the software you have installed and what particular problem you are attacking.\nIt would be hard to beat a hardware solution you mention as not so good, though. A FireWire or powered and Ethernet link would be faster, but your mac still has to juggle all the bits which is why all the solutions are slow. Nothing short of thunderbolt will allow something to be faster than your GPU. \n", "Q: Deleting a partition in Disk Utility fails.

What I did to resolve it was go in to Disk Utility in my host computer then erase the contents of the connected drive that way. It objected and said there was an error. When I went back to terminal the \"virtual\" and unencrypted disk2 was gone, but I reran the erase command and now it's going.\nPerhaps that might help with someone having partition issues.\n\nA: As pointed out by JFW, the error is raised when trying to erase a CoreStorage encrypted device (e.g., encrypted by Time Machine). If you want to erase the whole drive you can solve the error on the terminal by:\ndiskutil cs list\n\nNow find the Logical Volume Group' lvgUUID (the long hex number) that you want to erase. Re-check that all volumes in this group are safe to be deleted. If so you can delete the volume group with\ndiskutil cs delete lvgUUID\n\nThe disk will be erased, formatted as HFS Plus volume and re-mounted. You can use Disk Utility as usual to change the format.\n", "Q: Simple remote access to another Mac or PC I frequently get asked by various poeple to fix or help them with their computers (Windows XP, Windows 7, OSX Leopard, OSX Snow Leopard, OSX Lion).

Then, as user admin, I installed Homebrew by executing /usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731)\". Moreover, I installed giter8 by running brew update && brew install giter8.\nNow, as user admin I can run command g8 which is installed in /usr/local/bin. However, using my regular restricted user account, I cannot run this command, as its permissions are too restrictive:\n$ ls -la /usr/local/bin/g8\nlrwxr-x---  1 admin  admin  29 Sep  2 11:12 /usr/local/bin/g8 -> ../Cellar/giter8/0.2.0/bin/g8\n\nAs you can see, g8 has permissions 750 and is owned by admin:admin; so, as regular user, I have no chance to run g8. But, what is even more strange, some crucial folders have similar - too restrictive IMHO - permissions:\ndrwxr-x---  3 admin  admin   102 Sep  2 11:12 Cellar\ndrwxr-x---  7 admin  admin   238 Sep  2 11:12 Library\n\nThus, even after fixing the permissions of symbolic link g8 (readable and executable by all users), regular users cannot execute commands / run programs installed via brew install..., as regular users cannot access folder Cellar, nor folder Library, which both contain crucial files for most programs.\nIs this by design, or is this a bug?\n\nA: Very old question but I thought I'd mention that some people (including me) chown the homebrew /usr/local/ directory so you can run everything in it without issue. I used:\nsudo chown -R `whoami` /usr/local\n\n", "Q: can I use my OS X Lion upgrade on a different machine? If I buy a new mac that comes with a free upgrade to Lion, can I use the upgrade on a different machine instead of the new machine, or is it tied to the new machine? The upgrade site requires the serial number of the new machine. I prefer to have Lion on the old machine and Snow Leopard on the new one, then maybe I will buy Lion for the new machine if I decide I like it.\n\nA: It is tied to the new mac. The store verifies the mac rather than the Apple ID to allow the download if you need to reinstall the OS.\nSome people are reporting that the few macs that shipped with Snow Leopard from the factory, but were changed later get a redemption code that works more like you purchasing an upgrade. That purchase seems to work on 5 macs like the other App Store purchases.\n\nA: Not 100% sure, but I think that when you buy a new Mac with Lion, is not like if you bought Lion through the Mac App Store. So you'll have to buy Lion for your old machine.\nAnd most importantly, some people reported that Snow Leopard doesn't work that well on machine with Lion pre-installed, so you might not even be able to install Snow Leopard on your new machine.\n\nA: Any OS X disc can be used on any compatible mac and has no form of serial numbers or registrations to worry about. I'm not sure new Macs with lion come with discs though, you should check that out online.\n", "Q: Native RNDIS USB tethering support for OSX Android phones can be USB tethered via RNDIS protocol on Windows and Linux.

It's FOSS too.\nhttp://www.joshuawise.com/horndis\n\nA: RNDIS is a Microsoft-proprietary protocol and it's highly unlikely that Apple is going to support it just for the sake of Android tethering.\nhttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNDIS\nYour best chance is for a 3rd party to write a Mac OS X driver for RNDIS. Don't expect this to be free (as in beer) though.\nHowever you should be able to use the Android phone as a USB dial-up modem, which was the standard way for tethering before the iPhone came about and still a supported method in OS X and others.\n\nA: horndis is a brilliant solution - just started using it yesterday and it's completely stable\nI couldn't get my Andriod phone to work as a USB modem.\nI compiled it from source for 10.6.8 then used packagemaker and the included packagemaker project file to create a package to install.\nOnly gotcha was using sudo su to change the ownership and permissions on the installed kext manually\nsudo su\nchown -R root:wheel /System/Library/Extensions/HoRNDIS.kext\n\nchmod -R 755 /System/Library/Extensions/HoRNDIS.kext\n\n", "Q: Command-Control-Arrow beeps (plays alert sound) in Lion I've noticed since upgrading to Lion that if I press Command-Control-Left/Right (and sometimes Down as well; see below), my computer beeps at me (plays alert sound).\nIt doesn't occur in all applications:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Console, I can press any of the above key combinations, and there's no beep.\n\n*In Mail, it beeps if I press Command-Control-Left/Right, but not Up/Down.\n\n*In most every other application, every combination except Command-Control-Up causes a beep.\n\n\nI can't seem to find any menu commands that it might be trying to invoke, although even if that were the case, applications such as NetBeans and PhpStorm are the proverbial monkey wrench here:  I have Command-Control-Left mapped to \"go to last edit\".  When I press that key combination, my Mac still beeps at me, but it it also does move the cursor to the last edit location.\nWhat does Command-Control-Left/Right/Up/Down map to that my Mac is complaining about?\n\nA: Depending on the version of your macOS, you have to do the following:\n10.11 El Capitan through 13.0 Ventura (from Adobe/Brackets)\nYou'll need to create the ~/Library/KeyBindings directory first. Then create the file ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict with the following content.

A new message will be created but if you type Command-N you will hear the audible bell. This is because Command-N is no longer mapped to anything. We replaced it.\nSo when you hear the audible bell it often means that you are trying to do something that is not possible (i.e. typing a key command that has no meaning for the current application).\n\nA: If you want Command+Alt+Control+arrow to also suppress the chime, use this:\n\"@~^\\UF701\" = \"noop:\";\n\"@~^\\UF702\" = \"noop:\";\n\"@~^\\UF703\" = \"noop:\";\n\n(only tested in Monterey)\n\nA: If you have issues with control+option+command+arrow as well, then also add these: (tested with Monterey)\n    \"@~^\\UF701\" = \"noop:\";\n    \"@~^\\UF702\" = \"noop:\";\n    \"@~^\\UF703\" = \"noop:\";\n\nDon't forget to close and re-open the app that you are using to see the effects!\n", "Q: Copying formatted text from a web page to an Applescript input dialog I have an Applescript which - simplified - looks like this:\n...\ndisplay dialog \"foo\" default answer \"\"\n...\n\nOne of the users of this script runs Lion.

I would like to connect to a directory on the second hard drive of machine REM. Both machines are running Lion 10.7.1. I use Finder on LOC and Command-K to connect to a server. I type in afp://192.168.1.3 (IP Address of REM) and authenticate as a user on REM with Admin priveleges. I am presented with an option to connect to any of several different folders, all of which reside on REM's primary (boot) hard drive. I would like to connect to a folder which resides on a second internal drive in REM, but I am not given this option. The folder on the second hard drive is owned by the Admin user I am connect to REM as, and has 755 permissions. I have created a symlink on REM under the home directory of the user I authenticate as. When I am logged in to REM locally as that same user, clicking on the symlink takes me to the folder on the secondary drive.\nHow can I access this folder via AFP from another computer?\n\nA: Yes.\nSet up sharing on REM to share the root directory of the second drive.\nYou can right click and do it from the Finder or go in and manage all shares from the sharing system preference.\n\nA: Well, I ask for the information (CMD-I) of the secondary drive, and set the \"shared\" box. Then afp  is able to mount the secondary disk. Some difficulty may arise from \"symbolic links\" between drive (the links you create with unix command  ln -s ), and I had to use \"hard link\" (\"create alias\" from Finder menu, and probably Unix command \"ln \", without option \"-s\").\nNote that I have done all this not on the REM itself, by through the  \"screen sharing\" button that appears in the Finder window of the remote disk !  Fine application that avoided me to run between the two computers !\n", "Q: Software written for Mac that was later ported to Windows What notable software is there that was originally written for Macintosh and then later ported to Windows? What makes this software notable?\nLet's stick to actual software packages that stand on their own and not ideas or implementations like a window system or menu idiom.\n\nA: *\n\n*Microsoft Word in 1984 \n\n*Microsoft Excel in 1984 \n\n*Aldus PageMaker (later Adobe PageMaker), circa 1986\n\n*Adobe Illustrator, 1986\n\n*Fontographer, the first commercial scalable-font authoring software, 1986.\n\n*Microsoft PowerPoint, 1987 (originally called Forethought Presenter) \n\n*Adobe Photoshop circa 1987 \n\n*Adobe Illustrator circa 1987\n\n*QuarkXpress, 1987\n\n*Macromedia Freehand\n\n*Avid, the first professional personal computer-based video editing software, 1988\n\n*Make Music Finale circa 1989, the publishing industry's leading application for typesetting sheet music\n\n*AOL, 1990-1991. America Online and its client software application were originally Mac-only.\n\n*Digidesign Sound Tools and Pro Tools, starting 1989\n\n*Adobe Type Manager, circa 1990. The first scalable screen fonts on a computer display.\n\n*FileMaker Pro database software (an independent division of Apple), circa 1986\n\n*Apple QuickTime\n\n*Apple iTunes\n\n*Apple Safari\n\n*Scrivener, 2009\n\n\nThe Mac and its operating system went on the market in 1984. Remember that while Microsoft Windows existed in various forms in the late 1980s, it did not catch on and become widely adopted until Windows 3.1 in 1991. Before that time virtually all PC users were still using MS-DOS with a text-only interface and no graphics, GUI or mouse.\nMicrosoft provided text-only applications called Word and Excel (no graphical user interface or mouse) for MS-DOS before 1985, but the first programs called Word and Excel with a GUI were designed and written for the Macintosh. It's not accurate to call them a \"port\" from MS-DOS as they had to be re-designed and implemented with the Apple Macintosh assembly language and proprietary new API for the mouse, GUI and specific user interface elements in mind. So practically speaking, Word and Excel as we know them were first written for Mac and then ported to Windows.\nThe entire industry of digital photo editing and desktop publishing was born on the Macintosh platform, which was the first platform to support PostScript laser printers (and Apple designed and marketed the first of those printers, the Apple LaserWriters, with PostScript software licensed from Adobe. HP or Hewlett-Packard laser printers did not support PostScript, resolution-independent fonts, or graphics until some time later.)\nAll of the original software applications for editing photographs and doing text layout and typography first appeared on the Mac. Those that survived the marketplace competition and flourished were later ported to Windows. This includes essentially the entire Adobe product portfolio throughout the 1980s.\nMicrosoft and Adobe also bought software from smaller independent companies and adapted it to their needs. The predecessor to PowerPoint was an independent Mac-only company, and the very first version of Microsoft PowerPoint was Mac-only. Aldus was an independent company that made the first great desktop publishing program, PageMaker. It was bought by Adobe.\nThe adoption of personal computers for editing film and video for the industries of motion pictures and broadcast television also began with applications on the Macintosh platform, starting with the Avid offline film editing program. \nThe same thing happened with the music and recording industry. While there were MIDI sequencer applications for MS-DOS and other platforms, the first widely-successful personal-computer-based programs for recording and editing music appeared on the Mac, from Digidesign and others. This hastened the demise of professional multi-track analog tape recorders. I should mention that with regard to music and audio, capable Windows-based programs that were not ports (Cubase, Sony Acid, etc.) appeared very shortly after the first Mac programs. At this point, in the early-to-mid 1990s, computer processing power was more up to the task and Windows was becoming a viable alternative to the Mac platform, so implementing solutions on Windows rather than the Mac became more attractive to developers.\nAOL (America Online) was originally for Mac users only and its original software was licensed from Apple Computer. But some time after the launch for Mac users, AOL ported their GUI Mac application to Windows and accepted Windows users. All this was well before AOL had any connection to the Internet. It was a stand-alone closed system accessible directly by dial-up modems.\nBefore Adobe Type Manager, circa 1990, computers could not display fonts at any arbitrary point size, or \"zoom in\". Fonts for screen display before that time were only fixed-size bitmaps, and text on the screen of Macs or Windows could look quite blocky and hard to read. I seem to remember that Adobe Type Manager for Mac predated Adobe Type Manager for Windows by some length of time, but I have not confirmed this. Subsequently Apple and Microsoft worked jointly to develop the TrueType font scaling specification and method of screen display, which was rolled into the Mac operating system and Windows, circa Windows 98 in 1998. This made Adobe Type Manager obsolete. I have not researched the exact dates.\nThe entire Microsoft software development division that wrote games for the XBox was created when Microsoft bought Bungee, which was up until that time a Mac-only game company. When Microsoft absorbed Bungee, they cancelled all their Mac products. The developers who created Halo, therefore, had been working on Mac products only--up until the time that Halo for XBox was released.\n\nA: iTunes was originally developed for Mac and ported to Windows much later. Another program that was also ported is one of my all-time favorites, 1Password by AgileBits. \n\nA: A list of applications that began their life as Apple-only and were then ported to Windows.\nThis answer is a community wiki answer and can be added, edited by anyone. Please add new software to this answer instead of starting yet another answer.\nWhen adding an application to the list try to give an approximate date when the conversion began.

Access the volumes and files locally\" means that what you're seeing in the sidebar is your own computer, not a different machine... why you're seeing it is the real question, and unfortunately I don't have any great answers for you.\nMore troubleshooting is in order, and if this were shorter I would have posted it as a comment....\nThere's a very similar question on SuperUser which unfortunetly has no answers... if I were you, I would comment on that question and link to this one. That will bump that question and possibly get an answer to it.\nSomeone has the exact same issue on MacWorld's forums however they never returned to give any more detail or let us know if the problem was solved...\nDo you have an Airport Extreme with a drive attached to it? This person and this person also mentioned seeing the same message with an Airport Extreme device which had an attached USB hard drive.\nA lot of people refer to this problem when talking about virtualization software. That was my first thought, but you said you're not using it.\nIf you turn off your airport card, does the share go away?\nIf you open the Terminal and type/paste in: ping -c 5 otseeley-remote.local, what do you see?\nEDIT: Let's see if this reveals anything. If you use a program like Bonjour Browser, do you see otseely-remote under any of the services? (You can expand all the levels of the tree by option-clicking on the topmost disclosure arrow twice)\n\n\nA: I've added a possible answer over on SuperUser\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/268380/mysterious-shared-server-with-same-name-appearing-disappearing/338732\n\nSounds like you might have SMB (Windows) Sharing turned on.\nTo check, go to the System Preferences and click on Sharing. In the list on the left click on 'File Sharing' then there is a little button on the top right called 'options'. In the drop-down that appears check that SMB sharing is un-ticked.\n\n\nA: Similar to what josh is saying, I would try and see if you hit this with some sort of network trace. What I recommend for easiest use is Bonjour Browser. This program lists all the bonjour services and who is advertising them, in this case we are talking AFP probably. I use this often at work to find who is using an iTunes shared library in two clicks.\nJust run the app and it will display all computers on the network who offer Bonjour services and you can expand the type of service to see which computers are offering it.\n\nA: In 10.7 removing the \"shared\" phantom computer can often be done by going to System Preferences>Sharing – then toggle on and off all the radio buttons that contain the word \"sharing.\" This should reset the sidebar to default.\n\nA: You may have a stowaway computer on your AirPort network.\nHere are a few steps to check this possibilty:\n\n\n*\n\n*activate your AirPort network;\n\n*open a Terminal\n\n*type arp -i en1 -a\nCheck all the MAC addresses displayed by arp. They should all belong to your own Mac, PC, iPhone and Co.. If not, then you have identified a\nstowaway computer on your network.\nThis would mean that your AirPort network is not secured.\nThen you can identify which kind of computer this stowaway is by looking at the 3 first digits of its MAC address and locate them within the :\nIEEE OUI official list.\nFrom the described symptoms, this uninvited computer is on the far limit\nof your AirPort network. This may be a few hundred meters in outdoor, and about 25 m far in a concrete building.\n\nA: This may not be the answer, but I got rid of mine by going to the System Preferences > Sharing and unchecked Remote Login.  I don't have a clue how I happened to enable that before!\n\nA: This may be meaningless to your situation, but I found this article educational -- about how a person's mac has two MAC addresses associated with it (one for its wifi identity and one for its non-wifi, ethernet identity.)   One of those \"jekyll and hyde\" existences is likely the other mystery machine for SOME of the people with this problem -- namely ME.\nTake a read through this --\nhttp://www.macmousecalls.com/files/who_is_invading.html\n\nA: I tried all the tricks I could find without success, but eventually solved it with the clue here that the phantom names on the network were \"stowaways\" on the Airport network.\nI had about 8 variations on the name of the Mac Mini on our network: some were names I gave it, some were simply appended numbers to one of the names. All three computers (two Mavericks and one Yosemite) on the network showed the same shared ghost devices. Must be a router storing the names of the phantom computers. I have a FiOS router, plus an Apple Airport Extreme connected to FiOs via ethernet, and also an old Airport Time Capsule for backups only (no wi-fi) daisy chained off the Airport Extreme, so there were three possible culprits.\nI unplugged both the FiOs router and the Airport Extreme, waited a minute, then plugged the FiOS router back in; after it was back online, I plugged the Airport Extreme back in. Partial success! Some of the newer ghost names went away, but four of the older ones remained. Must be the old Airport Time Capsule. I unplugged it, waited, then plugged it back in. Success! All the phantom names on the network are now gone from all the computers. This is not a problem that can be fixed locally by changing settings or trashing .plist files.\n\nA: I turned WiFi on and off and it got rid of the shared computer.\n", "Q: Winebottler's IE 7 looks different to my PC's IE 7 I've been testing my new site on my PC's IE 7 (actually IE 8 in 'IE 7 mode'), and yesterday I installed WineBottler's 'IE 7'.\nTesting across both, WInebottler's IE 7 looks significantly older, and significantly worse.\nDo you know why this is and how I might be able to fix it?\nRelated question, if I decide Winebottler isn't working and I'd like to go with Parallels or VirtualBox, do I need to shell out the $200+ for Windows as well?\n\nA: Your description about IE 7's looks is a little too unspecific to give you a definite answer. I'm guessing that you are referring to text rendering. Wine uses a few open source libraries to render texts. These produce different results from Windows' built in text rendering. Also, it replaces some (all?) fonts with free alternatives because of copyright issues. The result is that text does look different between Wine and Windows.\nAs for your second question, yes, you'd need to buy a separate Windows license. If you don't need to test with IE 9, you can go with an XP license. They are dirt cheap these days.\n", "Q: What's the optimal Handbrake setting to convert AVI for editing in iMovie/Final Cut? A friend has a Canon still camera (the PowerShot G9) that has a movie mode. My research shows that the camera produces 30 fps VGA-sized AVI files (probably uncompressed). She wants to send the footage via iDisk or Dropbox to someone else to be edited (in iMovie or some flavor of Final Cut), but is being frustrated by the large AVI file sizes (more than a MB/sec). I know that she'll want to convert the raw movies in Handbrake before sending, and I've seen with my own movies that converting AVI to some version of MPEG4 can result in significant size reduction.\nTwo parts to this question:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the optimal Handbrake setting (preset preferred; this is a non-technical user) to convert AVI to an editable format?\n\n*If there is more than one editable format, which one will produce the smaller files? Since the source material is only VGA quality, I don't think that resolution will be a major issue, though of course we don't want to degrade video quality.\n\nA: Don't forget the built-in Automator actions for encoding. The video plugin is very nice and has pre-sets starting with 480p (VGA size) and up.\n\nThe Encode for: Greater compatibility toggle keeps the audio and video at a lower bit rate. Depending on what your tolerance for \"less degradation\" is, you might experiment with Higher quality if you see too many H.264 artifacts on the default setting. It's unlikely as the encoder has a lot of room with 1.5 Mbps as the ceiling for the video data rate.\nYou could set up a few services to test the various settings and then make a folder action to apply your favorite encode setting to anything you drop in that folder.\nAutomation is fun—you might even be able to set up a folder action to do your uploading as part of this process.\n\nA: I would suggest you convert it to MP4 with the H.264 Codec. Handbreak is a pretty straight-forward applicaiton in terms of video conversion; in the video tab you can see the input and output size in pixels (so your video getting reduced in size should be avoided in a single glance), the framerate, which is best to keep on \"same as source\" and your target quality. Here is where the quality/size question arises. \nAs explained in the Handbrake wiki:\n\nWith the average bitrate or target size methods, you control the size\n  of the output file but give up control over the video's quality.\nConstant quality mode does the opposite; you specify a quality level\n  and HandBrake adjusts the bitrate (that is, the size) to meet it.\n\nhttps://trac.handbrake.fr/wiki/ConstantQuality\nSo basically you can select a target size, and your video will be squeezed to that, at the expense of quality, you can choose an average bit rate, and all your video will be set those many kilobytes per second, or you can select a Constant Quality and handbreak will make sure your video looks as you want it, regardless of size. \nIts a tough decision, and depends greatly on your source video. If youre uploading to the internet I's suggest you select \"2 pass encoding\" and set the bit-rate to arround 1MB. Because this depends a lot on your video (eg. vids with lots of grain and movement usually need a higher bit rate) this might be enough or might not (I'm pretty sure it will though :))\nGood luck! \n", "Q: Tell Safari to Download Certain File Types? There are certain file types that Safari automatically opens natively.  Various kinds of video files, for example.  Is there a way to configure Safari to not open these files and instead default to just downloading them?\nI'm using Safari 5.1 on OS X 10.7.1\n\nA: I don't know about permanently, but you can hold down the option key when clicking on a link, and that will always download it instead of opening it.

How do you increase the font size in the Mac App Store? I have just gotten a new Apple Cinema Display and I'm getting used to the higher resolution. I like it and don't wish to lower it. I have just been increasing the font size etc. wherever I can. The only place where I've found it to be a real issue is in the Mac App Store.\n\nA: Having just checked all prefs that I thought might have an effect on this, the only option I found was in the \"Seeing\" tab in Universal in System Preferences.

They have a ton of adapters, cables and other accessories, which in my experience have all been of good quality, for much cheaper prices.\nThey have the specific MiniDisplayport or Thunderbolt to HDMI Adapter you need for under $7. They've got a pretty extensive collection of cheap HDMI cables to go along with it as well.\n\nA: I bought the adapter from Apple to get the HDMI output from my MBP (same as yours).  You can visit the Apple Store for the adapters - I bought one of each adapter available, as I wanted to be prepared for whatever need I came across.  The Thunderbolt port is to be used with the adapters.\nI also both several different lengths of HDMI cables.\nMy TV has several HDMI input ports.  The MBP automatically recognizes the TV as another monitor, so the only effort left is to get the TV setup to use that HDMI port as the Source.\n\nA: Any video adapter that is either a Thunderbolt adapter or a mini Display Port adapter is designed to work when plugged into any Thunderbolt mac.\n\nA: Part of the thunderbolt protocol is Display Port (the next gen video interface standard like VGA and DVI) and has a mini display form factor that any mini display adapter can fit into. This means you can pick up a minidislpay port to HDMI adapter and use that. IF you need HDMI cables, apple sells really nice 1.8meter long ones for like $18\ntip: if you use an external monitor, i suggest a mini display pot to DVI adapter, and then just use a DVI to HDMI adapter when needed\n\nA: Just got to Walmart. I bought a thunderbolt to HDMI adapter and it worked perfectly.\nKind of stupid if you ask me since their new MacBook Pro models have HDMI. \n", "Q: Why my MacBook Pro 15\" (2011) power adapter turns orange? I bought an early-2011 MacBook Pro 15\" (highest-spec model) in June. It's running Lion.\nI have a problem which happens occasionally. My power adapter (while plugged in) from time to time (particularly when I play games) turns orange and shows me on the bottom of the screen that there is \"0:09\" or \"0:10\" minutes left. However, when I push on the battery menu icon for the detailed information, it shows me \"99% Full\".\n\nA: It could be that your battery is defective.\nIf you go to System Information > Power, what do you see under \"Battery Information\" - \"Charge Information\"?\nMine says:\nCharge Information:\n  Charge Remaining (mAh): 4693\n  Fully Charged: Yes\n  Charging: No\n  Full Charge Capacity (mAh): 4744\nHealth Information:\n  Cycle Count: 219\n  Condition: Normal\n\n\nA: I have read it somewhere before (here) that on some heavy loads (especially GPU loads), 2011 MacBook Pro charger may not supply enough charge. There are no official confirmations, though, as far as I know.\nPlease check, however, that the \"0:09\" minutes are referred to the remaining time and not the \"remaining time until fully charged\". I suppose it is the latter. \nI may also point out (but only as a last thought) that if you keep your Mac always under charge, the battery may stop charging at certain times to preserve lifetime. \n\nA: First, unlug your Mac and use it until the battery is at  2% or 3%. Then, shutdown your Mac and plug in again. After that battery should be fully charged.\n", "Q: How do I share purchased iOS apps without my Mac? Is there a way someone else can share a purchased iOS app with me when I only have my iOS device with me but no Mac but the other person has both his Mac and his iOS device around?\nIs there also a way when we both only have our iOS device around?\n\nA: Yes. Assuming they haven't run out of authorizations, they can sign into the app store on your iOS device and download the apps they wish to \"share\".\nJust go to the preferences app, Store and sign in another Apple ID. \nYou'll have that app to run until you erase it or the whole device. It of course won't transfer that app to a computer where your friend hasn't authorized iTunes, but iOS will be happy to run that version of the app indefinitely. \n", "Q: How many times can really I share a purchased app with other people I understand I can share apps with up to five other iOS devices of other people (with different apple IDs). But is this on a per-app base? I.e. can I only register five devices I want to share with once or can I share one app with 5 people and another app with 5 other people?\n\nA: The limits are only enforced on the authorization level. The license terms of the app store are very confusing to me (I have to read them many times and I never know if I'm remembering some past wording or what it really says today). It also has all the various stores - each with different terms for rentals, movies, music, subscriptions, Mac Apps, iOS apps, business use and personal use.\nhttp://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/us/terms.html\nOne computer that is authorized to download apps can sync over USB to hundreds of devices. I have never heard of a hard limit to the max number of devices per computer.  Via USB, you can share any or all your apps with countless people. This is called out in the current license terms as follows:\n\n(i) You may download and sync an App Store Product for personal,\n  noncommercial use on any iOS Device you own or control.\n\nIf you sync in manual mode, you have to designate this account as the \"primary\" account. That's it\n\nThere are further restrictions when you want transfer that app to another computer or update the app. You don't have to register the iOS device containing your app unless you want to update over the air ( OTA ) from the app store instead of from the computer you control. \nEach device is said to have a 5 account limit ( according to the license wording - i've never tested it to see this happen in practice)\nYour Apple ID likely has a 10 device limit - 5 of which can be computers. This limits your ability to share your Apple ID. ( but not the apps themselves )\nI haven't poured over the store license so keep in mind that you might have more technical capability to share than your license permits. I am also not a lawyer - so I don't know if two people can be considered to \"own or control\" the same device. Just like you can drive without a license - you can operate software without a license. Be nice and know what you are getting in to. \n\nA: It's based on the honor system. There aren't any actual [software] restrictions on the number of devices, but legally speaking, you are supposed to refrain from installing on any devices that aren't your own. That 5 person limit is strictly for iTunes [the desktop app].\n\nA: I could be wrong, but I think the sharing ability is limited to YOUR Apple ID and devices, and not for sharing with others.\nThe key is \"any device you own or control\".  I believe it is no different than sharing an OS. You can put an OS on each of your devices, but shouldn't participate putting it on a device belonging to a friend or relative.\n", "Q: In Lion's new Mail.app, is it possible to change the font size of the mailbox list? I have a small screen and MANY email mailboxes. I'd like to make the side panel font size smaller, but I can't find an option for it.

All good. I now want to share it with my windows 7 pc. I did this by using the \"File Sharing\" feature in System Preferences.\nI can access the shares on the HFS drive but not the ones on the NTFS drive. Any help would be awesome. Windows just tells me:\n\"Windows cannot access \\192.168.1.150\\d\"\nDetails: 0x80070035 (path not found)\n\nA: This is the reason why you can't share your NTFS drive from OSX to Windows: In OSX Lion Apple replaced the open source samba with apples own version which unfortunately ignores anything that isn't hpfs. So it hasn't anything to do with your drivers or such.\nThis topic was discussed at length at MacRumors.

I mac can read from an NTFS drive, but it cannot write to it.  Thus, it cannot make changes to the permissions on the drive in order for for file sharing to work.\nSorry about that.\nDoes the drive need to be in NTFS?   Could it be formatted Fat32 instead?  Then you should be able to read and write to it from both the Mac and Windows machine.\n", "Q: Uninstalling an incompatible color theme Today I did a mistake I normally never do - I blindly installed a software on my mac without knowing what I was doing.  \nI was looking for a dark color scheme and ran into this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT1CqiHqUXI \nWent ahead and installed the software from here http://wavespell.deviantart.com/art/Snow-Leopard-Dark-Dock-wK-155508613\nOnly after installing I realized that it didn't work on Lion.  Everything looks awful.  The uninstall program does not work either.  Is there a way to go back to defaults without having to reinstall the OS?  (All user accounts on this Mac are affected by this change).  Thanks in adv.\n\nA: You should be able to manually delete it. I would say that you need to open the installer again and go up to the point where it installs it, but don't install it. It should tell you where it is going to install it. From there, you can manually delete it.\n", "Q: Composing messages in Apple Mail: Displaying text on screen in larger size without changing font size When composing messages in Mail.app, as I now have an HD screen on my MBP, the default Helvetica 12pt appears quite small.  \nI would like to be able to enlarge the text size, but only locally, without changing the font in the message, as I don't want the recipients to have jumbo-size text on their screen.\nIs there a way to perform this kind of \"zoom\" without using the \"Universal access\" zoom features which are a little bit too much.\n\nA: You can go ahead and set it to what you want in Mail Preferences.  These settings have no effect on what is seen at the other end.  To do that you have to change the font for each outgoing individually in the New Message pane.\n\nA: I believe that this will allow you to increase font sizes in Mail.app for you but not for recipients of your messages:\n\nQuit Mail and run this in Terminal (adjust \"16\" to the desired font size in pts):\ndefaults write com.apple.mail MinimumHTMLFontSize 16\n\nSource: http://protips.posthaven.com/making-mail-dot-app-fonts-bigger\n\nA: You can also use Command + to enlarge the message font size display, just like in a browser. (although oddly, you can't use Command 0 to revert to 100% zoom?)\n\nA: When going to \"Mail > Preferences > Fonts & Colors > Message Font\", it changes the font of the message to be sent, and not the font that one visualizes on screen.\nI cannot report the exact menu, as I am away from my Lion at the moment; it could be the menu it is not where I said it is.\n", "Q: I can't get gcc to compile DevIL library I'm writing an OpenGL application in C++ using Xcode 4 on Lion. To load textures, and keep the application platform independent, I plan on using DevIL.\nTo install DevIL on my mac I ran ./configure and noticed gcc was no longer on the $PATH. I created a symlink from /Developer/usr/bin/gcc-4.2 to /usr/bin. Then I re-ran ./configure, it now finds gcc but fails with this:\nchecking for gcc... gcc\nchecking for C compiler default output file name... \nconfigure: error: C compiler cannot create executables\n\nI'm not sure what this means:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shouldn't I have symlinked gcc? \n\n*Do I need another gcc?\n\n*Is the problem DevIL related?\n\n\nThanks in advance\n\nA: As for your first question: The cleaner alternative to symlinking would be to add /Developer/usr/bin to your $PATH, so the other utilities needed for compilation can be found. That's easy to do:\nexport PATH=$PATH:/Developer/usr/bin\n\nYou could put that into ~/.profile so the path get set each time you open a terminal window.\nAnd I'm certainly not a GCC/LLVM expert, but to me it seems like DevIL's configure script does expect a different version of gcc, one which doesn't expect an argument to the -V switch. My best bet would be to ask around on the DevIL developer's mailing list, as there probably are people who have been confronted with the same problem.\n", "Q: How do I disable quarantine on Lion?

I'm using the MagSafe power adapter from my old multibody Macbook Pro:\n\nOn my new unibody Macbook Pro:\n\nThe MagSafe power adapter has become very hot and emitting a faint burning smell. It's not scalding hot. I can still hold it in my hand. If I were to guess, it's 150 Fahrenheit. The smell is similar to what you would smell when you turn on a cheap blender for too long. It is properly charging though. I see the percentage increase on my screen. I'm not in a foreign country, so voltage is not the issue. So I'm wondering, is the unibody Mac not compatible with the multibody Mac's power brick?\n\nA: Yes - an 85 W magsafe adapter is an 85 W magsafe adapter no matter what the end cord arrangement. The newer adapters have a thin barrel more like the 45 W macbook air barrel style adapters first required due to the limited space where it connected.\nThe heat and burning smell could be a safety issue (especially if your sniffer isn't very sentitive)  - have it looked at by a professional that sees a lot of adapters or just replace it if your sense it it's not working properly.\n\nA: Yes they're compatible, however if the wattage of the charger is less than what the MacBook needs, it may not charge while the MacBook is running. That's typically only a consideration when you're using a charger from a smaller MacBook on a larger one. It shouldn't cause a burning smell or other malfunction.\nIf you're smelling burning, I'd get it checked out. Those things have been known to melt, particularly around the Magsafe connector, or where the cable meets the power brick. Check for frayed wires, etc. But I doubt it's related to using it on a different MacBook.\n\nA: I had the exact same issue, old 85w brick as a back up for a new mbp. I kept the new brick at work in order to travel. I also had occasional smells until it ultimately failed and shorted. The plastic around the wiring at the brick melted away. No damage to the mbp.\nI spoke with a fella at the Mac store who said the point where the wire meets the brick is a common failure point. Seems many users, myself included, would wrap the wiring too tight. Over time the wires fail. He suggested leaving and inch of leeway before wrapping tightly.\n\nA: At work, we have various MacBook Pros ranging from 2008 to 2011 models. In meetings, we share the power without any problem at all. \n\nA: I agree with the others that the power adapters should be interchangeable, but that the heat + burning smell is cause for concern.  I had a brick that was doing that and then one day, it gave off a \"pop\" sound and sparks, and melted a section of the cord, near the point where the cord enters the block.  Scared the crap out of me!  If that had happened when I wasn't nearby, depending on the materials nearby, it certainly could be a significant safety risk.\nI've seen the recommendation to pub a spring from an old ball point pen around the cord at the inflection point, to prevent the wear and tear that comes from repeated bending there.  Haven't tried it myself.  But if you are already getting a smell I'd use that on the replacement power adapter, and retire this one.  \n", "Q: Why do movies sometime lag on my 15\" MacBook Pro (2011)? I have a new 15\" MacBook Pro with the highest specifications, running Lion version 10.7.2. However, when I watch movies they sometimes lag on my computer: frozen screen (for 3-4 s) with lots of broken cubes and with the audio track still playing).\nWhat could be possibly wrong with my computer?\nFor example, today I watched the Fast Five Blu-ray movie (which is almost 50 GB) with the VLC media player and suddenly it started lagging on some episodes (especially on intense action ones with lots of special effects). Moreover, it lags not only on Blu-ray movies but movie files ripped from standard definition DVDs and other formats as well.\nI play all those movies with the power plugged in from downloaded files, not from optical DVDs. Even Stanford University lectures from iTunesU sometimes lag for me.\nUPDATE: I was in the Genius bar several times, reinstalled Lion by my own and also in the Apple Store.\nAfter the fresh install I tried to test videos. I watched House, M.D. season 8 episode 2 (395.9 MB) yesterday, and it started lagging all over again.\nI do not really know what to do. Is this a bug in VLC, iTunes, and other media players,  or it is something wrong with my hardware (they actually tested my Mac in the Genius bar with their cable plugged in but did not find any problems)?\n\nA: When formulating a question, it's best to ask it accurately. In this case, the issue has nothing to do with Blu-Ray or DVD files. You aren't playing back from disc media. Instead, you are playing back from very high-bitrate files ripped or copied from the disc media. You are using the free VLC player to view the ripped files.\nLet's analyze: a 50 GB file of Fast Five (130 min running time) would appear to be a copied, uncompressed file, since you can find .mkv or .mp4 files of the movie on torrent sites that run between 6 and 10 GB. So the file you're talking about is a very high-bitrate video file. You don't say, but I'm guessing it's a .m2ts file.\nTwo things:\n\n\n*\n\n*The problem could very well be in VLC. Its support for .m2ts files is not optimized (due to licensing issues and other problems, the Blu-Ray format is not publicly well-documented).\n\n*I don't think there is anything wrong with your Mac. You are simply throwing a tremendous amount of data at it, and the software you are using for the video playback can't keep up. \nSuggestion: obtain a 1080p version of the movie in .mkv or .mp4 format, then attempt to play that back with VLC. If the movie plays well, with acceptable quality and without lag, then you have your answer, and can watch future movies accordingly.\n\nA: While many people use it and like it, I find VLC to be an AWFUL player, and for me it has been buggy and slow on OS X since its first release. I expect that it always will be. It is also ugly.\nConsider Movist as an alternative. I use it on my late-'08 15\" MBP on 10.7.2 and can watch 1080p movies (h.264 .mkv files) with no issues. Your vastly superior hardware should have the same results.\nIf your file is 50GB, am I to assume that it is an uncompressed Blu-ray rip? If so, look for an encoded version and see if that helps (if simply switching players does not).\n", "Q: sudo dscacheutil -flushcache = ?Invalid command I'm getting the following response when I try and run dscacheutil -flushcache\n\n?Invalid command\n\n\nA: Turns out I'm a complete idiot.

I'm trying to free up space on an external drive, and after deleting a bunch of stuff, it's still showing very little actual free space.  I went to the trash can, but can't seem to delete the files there other than by emptying the entire trash.\nAm I missing something?  What's the point of having a \"staging area\" for stuff you (probably) want to delete, if you can't get rid of the files in it individually?  The drive will be used on an embedded system, so just \"putting files in the trash\" doesn't actually make space on the drive, as far as the consuming device is concerned.\n\nA: You could create an Automator service like this one\nfor f in \"$@\" \ndo\n    rm -rf \"$f\"\ndone\n\n\nto then be able to delete individual selected files with a command from the services menu.\n\nA: The keyboard shortcut ⌘ command + ⌥ option + delete removes the file permanently. This works from anywhere in Finder (including the Trash) on El Capitan and higher, but not on previous versions of OS X.\n\nA: The Trash isn't intended for files you may want to delete later but rather as a safety net if you delete the wrong files. If you want to mark files for later deletion, either use a dedicated folder (as already mentioned in another comment) or mark them with a specific label/color.\nTo delete individual files from the Trash\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the trash in the Finder\n\n*Open Terminal.app\n\n*Type rm -rf and then one space character at the end\n\n*Drag one or more files to be deleted into the Terminal window ('til you see the green + sign)\n\n*Press Enter in Terminal.app\n\n*Puff, files are gone!\n\n\nIf you need this very often, I would recommend writing a service using Automator or getting more familiar with Terminal.app/bash.\n\nA: What I do is right click (secondary click) on the items that I don't want to delete and then from the menu I get I tick the checkbox says \"Locked\" under \"General\" and it locks the item that you don't want to delete.\n!\nAfter doing it for all the items that I don't want to delete then I click \"Empty Trash\" after which it asks whether to delete all or to delete only the unlocked items (which are the items you didn't lock and you want to be deleted) so choose \"Remove Unlocked Items\".\n!\n\nA: This seems to work on El Capitan.

Then right-click on any of the selected files and choose 'Delete Immediately' as described above.\nFinally, you can select multiple files by clicking on the first one, then pressing 'Command' and clicking on a second one, then a third one, etc. Then right-click on one of the selected files and choose 'Delete Immediately' as described above.\n\nA: I tried the Terminal approach- it works as a good alternative to what I do! \nI am a Parallels Windows7 user (I'm not really \"ashamed\" - dunno why I should be- maybe I'm just a Po'ol' Third-Worlder who does not share the exotic tastes & prejudices of the first world haha!) \nAnyway, what I do is I open my Windows7 desktop through Parallels and just drag stuff from my Mac (any folder, FTM) right into the Windows7 RecycleBin and, Voila- Selective, safe, effective deletion!\nBest of both worlds, I say.\n\nA: If you restart your Mac, you can delete it from Trash.\nWhen I move an app to Trash, some plist file the app used will be moved to Trash too, if you empty the Trash now, you will get a warning like \"xxx.plist is using , you can not delete it\", but if you restart your mac, you can delete it, restart system may unlock some plist from system, so you can delete it, also, you can delete it in Terminal described before.\n", "Q: Access iPod from Windows Explorer I just got my new iPod 4.\nI wanted to use it as a storage device copying to it music and eBooks, but it doesn't show up on my computer.\nI followed the direction in this page, but unfortunately, the option \"Enable disk use\" doesn't show up (iTunes 10), I've checked \"Manually manage music and videos\" instead, but it doesn't do the trick, and the device doesn't appear in Windows Explorer.\n\nA: Do you mean an iPod Touch? IIRC \"Enable Disk Use\" is only for non-iOS devices. I don't know of a way in which you can manually copy songs from your computer to your iOS using the file system and have them play in the iPod.app on your iPod Touch. I believe Stanza allows you to copy ebooks from your computer to your iOS device but I'm not sure if it uses iTunes for that process. \n", "Q: How can I record my iPhone's screen? I'm wondering how I could record the screen of my iPhone without jailbreaking? Are there any Apps that will do this? I know how to take a screen shot but I don't know how to record video.\n\nA: Since iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, you can connect the iPhone to your Mac using the Lightning connector, and it will be available as a video camera. Then you can record video of what happens on the screen using QuickTime Player. \n(Source: https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-previews/)\nWith previous versions of iOS and OS X, you can use AirPlay mirroring on your phone and  an AirPlay receiver/recorder like Reflector or X-Mirage.\n\nA: I don't believe there's a way to do it without jailbreaking. Because of the security restrictions on what apps can access, and particularly the limited functionality when running in the background, I'm pretty sure it's impossible without jailbreaking (and maybe even if you do jailbreak).\nIf you're looking to make a screen-cast or something similar, the technique I've heard is popular (at least with Adam Lisagor, who does a lot of iOS app videos) is using the iPhone simulator included with Xcode.\n\nA: You can use the Apple 30 pin to HDMI cable (meant for iPads) and hook it up to a Tivo. This will only work if your using an iPhone 4, no other iPhones will work with the cable. \n\nA: You can use an OS X app like Reflector or AirServer to make your Mac simulate an AirPlay display. Then you select your Mac as an external AirPlay display on your iPhone. AirServer and Reflector provide features to record the output.\nOS X 10.10 Yosemite has an iOS screen recording feature built into QuickTime.\n", "Q: How can I mount a drive with Truecrypt through a script based on its UUID? I keep an external drive on my desk at work that I used as an off-site (ie not at home) backup. Because it could easily get taken I have a partition on it encrypted with TrueCrypt. I've got a script to mount this encrypted partition then do a backup via rsync then un-mount. It looks like:\ntruecypt /dev/rdisk1s2  /Volumes/untitled\nrsync -myRsyncOptions /Users/me /Volumes/untitled/me\ntruecypt -d   /Volumes/untitled\n\nIt works well, so long as my drive is seen as /dev/rdisk1s2. If not the script breaks. The trouble is that I need to point Truecrypt to the correct device file in order to mount the volume correctly. Sometimes the device file will change. Once the first line in the script works the rest of the script works.\nIs there anyway I can use UUID or otherwise to ensure that my encrypted partition always gets the same device file attached to it so Truecrypt can mount it successfully? I've seen a few examples of using UUIDs in the /etc/fstab file but I don't think they apply in this case. Thanks!\n\nA: Here's a quick and dirty guide to specify the mount point based on the UUID. It works in Linux and since OS X respects fstab, it should work there too: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-finding-using-uuids-to-update-fstab/\nNote: You might have to modify it a bit as some of the entries specified are not used in OS X. Give it a shot.\nAdditionally, I'm wondering if you could just change up your script to pull the device name instead of the mount point, that is, use the device name (e.g., /Volumes/YourDrive instead of /dev/rdisk1s2) as that never changes (unless you rename the drive).\n\nA: It would be better to build up a filter and use diskutil list to \"find\" your drive no matter where it gets mounted. If you edit the question to show what the desired volume looks like to the OS before the first truecrypt command, perhaps we can assist with some ideas to get the appropriate /dev/rdiskXs2 value dynamically using diskutil\n", "Q: How can I write-protect (make read-only) a USB drive in OS X?

How can I make the drive read-only or otherwise write-protect it by the OS so that I can ensure nothing is modified on the drive?\n\nA: Seems like editing the fstab file would be the best solution as you don't need to unmount/manually mount the volume each time. It sounds very low level solution, so not even the system/root/spotlight would modify the drive.\nhttp://www.macissues.com/2014/09/02/how-to-make-secondary-boot-partitions-read-only-in-os-x/\n\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Open Disk Utility in the Applications > Utilities folder, and then select the volume in the device list on the left-hand side of the window.

For an automated solution, have a look at MarcoPolo or write a launchd command (see e.g. here for inspiration).\nOption 2: Use access control on the drive\nDoes the drive really need to be formatted in FAT32 or do you only access it from a Mac OSX system anyway? In the later case, you can save the drive content on another drive, reformat it as a Mac OSX drive, move/copy the content back and take away any write rights from anybody.\n\nA: If you leave the USB drive formatted as FAT32, you can't. I would propose a different solution: use Disk Utility to create an ISO9660 (\"DVD/CD Master\") disk image with your data and write it to the USB drive. Unfortunately, Disk Utility doesn't seem to be able to write an ISO9660 image to a USB drive. so you'll have to do it below:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, insert/mount the drive once, run diskutil list from Terminal.app and take note of the device representing the drive (should be something like /dev/diskN with N being any number).\n\n*Eject the disk by running diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN replacing N by the number noted in the first step\n\n*Finally input sudo dd if=/path/to/your/image.cdr of=/dev/diskN\nJust wait and done.\n\nA: Found Disk Arbitrator makes it very easy and straightforward. \nAs mentioned on tinyapps.com:\n\nOS X: Mount disks as read only or block automounting altogether\nAaron Burghardt's open source Disk Arbitrator provides a simple GUI\n  for changing OS X's automount behavior. Automounting can be disabled\n  completely (especially handy for drive imaging / data recovery via\n  ddrescue, etc) or mounts can be forced as read-only (for forensics,\n  etc, though a hardware write-blocker is still recommended).\n\nand from Aaron Burghardt's project page on GitHub:\n\nDisk Arbitrator is a Mac OS X forensic utility designed to help the user ensure correct forensic procedures are followed during imaging of a disk device. Disk Arbitrator is essentially a user interface to the Disk Arbitration framework, which enables a program to participate in the management of block storage devices, including the automatic mounting of file systems. When enabled, Disk Arbitrator will block the mounting of file systems to avoid mounting as read-write and violating the integrity of the evidence.\nIt is important to note that Disk Arbitrator is not a software write blocker---it does not change the state of currently attached devices nor does it affect newly attached devices to force a device to be read-only. The user still must be careful to not accidentally write to a disk with a command such as \"dd\". Owing to this fact, a hardware or software write-blocker may still be desirable for the most sound procedure. Disk Arbitrator compliments a write-blocker with additional useful features and eliminates the typical forensic recommendation to \"disable disk arbitration.\"\n\n\nA: If it were my data, and I really needed to not write on it, I'd put a master copy in a safe place and only ever mount a copy of that master.\n\nA: I would recommend using a USB flash drive that has a secure element capable of enforcing read-only mode (see https://istorage-uk.com/product/datashur-pro2/).\n", "Q: Offline Maps application for Mac Can anyone recommend an offline mapping application for Mac (something similar to Google Maps, but that works when not connected to the internet)? Ten years ago, Microsoft Streets and Trips worked well for Windows, but I'm looking for something similar now for Mac.\n\nA: Planito seems to be a good app for offline map viewing. It allows you to cache and view many different maps:\n\nPlanito does cost $4.99, but there is a trial available.\n\nA: RouteBuddy is a dedicated off-line mapping tool that seems to fit your needs. It's not cheap ($60 plus taxes) but it is very impressive. \nI downloaded the trial version which comes pre-loaded with vector street maps of Santa Fe, NM and a topographic map of Yosemite National Park. You can (without internet) easily search addresses, navigate, set waypoints, etc. and their website also lists several other features such as route statistics/elevation data/GPS support, among others, which I presume is available only in the full version.\nSince this is an offline mapping tool, you'll have to download the maps and check everything before your trip. Although it feels a bit slow to zoom in the first time, it's faster the second time onwards, once the data has been cached.\nBelow are a couple of screenshots of Santa Fe, NM and Yosemite as seen in the app.\n\n\n\nA: OpenStreetMap Wiki\n...has listed a large collection of software which uses it's data for Mac/PC or mobile devices.\n\n\nA: This is a terrible cop-out of an answer, but the best solution I've found so far is to run Microsoft Streets and Trips under Windows on my Mac.\nI tried Garmin BaseCamp with my GPS attached to the computer via USB cable. The software was slow, clunky, and unwieldy, compounded by the fact that I had a large item hanging off of my computer. So amazingly and unfortunately, the best mapping software I've been able to run on my Mac involved booting into Windows.\n\nA: This might be working for you. It's not been updated in a year, though, and requires a tiny bit of extra work upfront to get it up and running. Offline support is advertised.\nhttp://code.google.com/p/maps4mac/\nThen there's also http://www.mifki.com/planito/ which costs $4.99 but has a free demo. It's not open source.\n\nA: Exploring the app space on the OpenStreetmap wikipedia page I gathered the following.\nThere's a few iOS and macOS keyword hits on this page https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Using_OpenStreetMap_offline\nThere's a handful of apps listed here specifically for MacOS https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/MacOS#Viewing_maps\n\n\n\n\nApplication\nOffline Support\n\n\n\n\nCartograph\nYes\n\n\nJeography\nYes\n\n\nJGPSTrackEdit\n?\n\n\nLiveMapViewer – live changeset viewer\n?\n\n\nMaps4Mac\nYes\n\n\n\n\nThere's a recommendation for maps.me in this Apple community discussion How to download Apple Maps offline\n\nI highly recommend maps.me app for traveling. They do offer offline mode and they have all the paths which Apple Maps or Google Maps sometime do not have.\n\nUnfortunately in the app store there's no mention for MacOS\nhttps://apps.apple.com/app/id510623322 neither on their website https://maps.me/\n\nMAPS.ME: Offline Maps, GPS Nav 4+\n\n\naddendum\nThere's also the IOS page https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/IOS.\nSpecifically Guru Maps and Pocket Earth have mention of offline map support.\nIt's a bit unclear on this other wiki page but this table for Map display features has this curious column Stores map-data off-board (downloads from internet), sounds like offline support but maybe under different terminology hopefully? This may be a separate concept however, maybe with tiling, I couldn't find a definition of \"off-board\" in a reasonable time.\n", "Q: Whispersync-like experience for PDF or TXT files? When I start reading a PDF or TXT on my Mac and continue reading it on my iPhone, I have to waste time looking for exact place where I stopped reading on my Mac before continuing to read on my iPhone.\nIs there a web-based app or a Mac/iOS app that would remember where I left off, the way Whispersync does in the Kindle app?\n\nA: Here are a few options you could check out:\n\n\n*\n\n*Instapaper\n\n*\n\n*Acts a lot like Whispersync for any article you find on the web. \n\n*You can read via a nice iOS app or the web app.\n\n*You can also forward txt into your Instapaper account via email.\n\n*It's supported by a ton of additional iOS apps.\n\n*You can use actually link it right into your Kindle natively through Instapaper or using Ephemera.\n\n*It does NOT do PDF that I am aware of.\n\n\n*Simplenote\n\n*\n\n*A slick app to sync text files across devices including your Mac and iOS devices.\n\n*It has lots of third party support.\n\n*It does not do PDF or any of the Whispersync-like reading progress syncing.\n\n\n*Good Reader + Dropbox\n\n*\n\n*You can sync PDFs and other eBook formats easily between your Mac and iOS devices using Dropbox.\n\n*This solution will NOT do the Whispersync-like reading progress syncing.\n\n\n\nAs far as I have seen I think Instapaper is going to be your best option for getting a very similar experience to what you're looking for.\n\nA: Voice Dream iOS app was updated to version 4.0 which includes a new feature that will save reading locations to multiple devices using iCloud.\nHere's a quote from their notes on what's new in 4.0.\n\nLibrary Synchronization • Your entire library, including folders,\n  reading locations, bookmarks and annotations are synchronized across\n  all your devices using iCloud Drive.\n\nVoice Dream is meant as a text-to-speech app, but it also works well for times you want to read PDFs and other text without speech.\n", "Q: Are there less expensive alternatives to Apple-branded Mini DisplayPort adapters? I have a 2 years old 13\" macbook pro, and I admit I can't use my 6 months old PC when I just surf and code, since it's quite noisy and hot in the summer.\nI still have a nice 20\" flat monitor, and it'd be nice to use it, but Apple sells their adaptor 30 euros, isn't that a little bit expensive ? I'm reading this connector is not patented or licensed, do you think I can find cheaper ones ?\n\nA: I'm with you. I don't know why Apple has such a high mark-up for a simple adapter. But you can get them for substantially cheaper through aftermarket, 3rd party sellers.\nI purchased a Mini DisplayPort to DVI through Monoprice for $6.65 USD while Apple wanted $99 USD for theirs (which strangely came with a USB \"extender\" I had no use for). I thought it was a typo!\nHere's a full list of available Mini DisplayPort adapters from Monoprice.\nThey also provided free shipping and the while the quality of the adapter is not the same as apple's is it quite decent (reminiscent of a standard computer peripheral component from the 90's). But most importantly, it works just fine!\n\nA: There is a (lot of) confusion on this topic despite it's laden clear in Wikipedia. DisplayPort is a totally different standard than DVI/HDMI. However, most ports (inc. Apple) are DisplayPort++ which means they are capable of using the same pins to deliver a DVI signal so you just need a DisplayPort and a DVI connector and solder wires between the pins. This results in the so-called single link DVI -- fine for most purposes except 30\" DVI monitors. If you have a 30\" monitor with a double link DVI input you need complex electronics that take a proper DisplayPort signal and converts it to a DVI signal. This requires power which is usually taken from an USB port. And it's every expensive, indeed.\n\nA: Yes you can.\nYou have a lot of them on Amazon and also some 3rd party adapters on the apple store itself.\n", "Q: Make iPhoto overwrite my photos I'm new to iPhoto. Before importing any photos I unchecked the option \"Copy items to the iPhoto library\".\nWhen I rotate and edit photos in iPhoto (e.g. Enhance, Straighten etc), the original photo is unchanged and iPhoto creates its own copy of the photo which it stores somewhere else.\nCan I force iPhoto not to do this, and to modify the original photo?\n\nA: No.\niPhoto is designed to make non-destructive edits, preserving the original photo file. Overriding this feature is rather contrary to the basic nature of the program, which attempts to be careful to preserve, and never to modify the original photo files.\n", "Q: How can I use NTFS-3G installed using MacPorts? After upgrading to Lion I'm having problem mounting NTFS drives in read/write mode. This is because NTFS-3G distributed by Tuxera does not work with Lion.\nAt their suggestion I installed NTFS-3G using MacPorts. But as far as I can see it does not come with the usual preference pane. Its not enabled by default.\nDo anyone know how to enable it? Or how to have the Preference Pane for the NTFS-3G from MacPorts?\n\nA: NTFS-3G from macports works perfectly fine. Check this detailed and well-written instruction: http://fernandofig.wordpress.com/2011/08/08/ntfs-write-support-on-osx-lion-with-ntfs-3g-f/\n\nA: Are you having issues mounting the NTFS volumes or just enabling the preference pane?

I am new to Mac and I am looking for a Windows emulator for Mac OS X. I want to use an application which is not available for Mac.\nPlease recommend the strengths and weaknesses (including cost) of the various options available.\n\nA: Wine\nYou could try Wine and use the  Winebottler frontend for installing common Windows software.\nWith Wine isn't 100% compatible with all windows programs, so consider yourself lucky if all your applications work.\nVirtualbox\nVirtualbox is a PC virtualization software. You'll need to install Windows as a \"Guest operating system\", which requires a Windows license.\nVirtualbox is compatible with all Windows software, but has limited support for hardware 3D acceleration.\nBoot Camp\nFor 3D games you'll need to use Boot Camp.\n\nA: When using the term \"emulator\", it is important to distinguish between something that acts like Windows to applications (like Wine/Crossover) and something that acts like a PC to Windows (most of the other solutions) so that Windows can be installed.\nWine (Free)\nI highly recommend Wine, which allows for running Windows applications without actually emulating the whole Windows OS. I don't know how well it works with 3D stuff. I would also not recommend compiling it yourself. You do need to install the Developer Tools, included on your computer's install disc. I would recommend Winebottler, a free binary installer that also allows you to turn a Windows executable into a simple application that launches in X11.\nWine (and Crossover) do not require an actual copy of Windows installed on your machine.\nCrossover ($39.95)\nProfessionally supported enhancement of Wine\nQ (Free)\nQ is a great lightweight CPU emulator for OS X. Oddly enough, it runs on PPC Macs, in addition to Intel Macs. It supports emulating x86, x86-64bit, PPC PowerMac, PPC PREP, SPARC32, MIPS, and ARM processors.\nVirtualbox (Free)\nVirtualbox is not quite as lightweight as Q. It supports x86 and AMD processors. It allows multiple operating systems to run on your computer.\nBoot Camp (Free) - Comes with all Intel Macs\nI would recommend Boot Camp for 3D stuff. I haven't actually installed it on a Mac, I've used a friend's computer, so I can't help you with installation. As with anything Apple-related, it should be pretty straightforward. It also runs really well.\nQEMU (Free)\nAnother lightweight emulator. This one is somewhat confusing to download; I think you have to compile the emulator by hand.\nVMware Fusion ($80) by VMware\nI don't use VMware (I like the free stuff), but I've heard good things about it.\nParallels Desktop ($80)\nI haven't used Parallels, but it used to come for free with a new Mac. It still may, but I'm not sure.\n\nA: CrossOver ($40)\n(was not mentioned by the other two answers).\n\nA: Two possible solutions to the problem you seem to be trying to solve (as opposed to the question you asked):\n\n\n*\n\n*Dialectic, a shareware, script-able dialer.\n\n*Jon's Phone Tool, an earlier, discontinued, version from the same\nauthor.

Here's the trial link. \nThis is what my Intuit and MacBook help desk representative recommended. \n", "Q: How do I clone a dual-boot Macbook I have a Macbook Air set up for dual-boot (Lion & Windows 7) and am planning on buying a newer model. How would I go about cloning the entire hard drive to the new machine?\nDo I need to separately clone the Mac & Windows halves? Or is there a tool to move the whole thing verbatim?\n\nA: I would highly recommend Carbon Copy Cloner. I believe it copies invisible files.\n\nA: If you had any other Macs besides the MacBook Air, it would be trivial - put one Mac in Target Disk Mode, boot the other with the Installer disk, fire up the Terminal and dd from one disk to the other. If the new disk is larger, boot the new computer and either use diskutil resizeVolume to resize your OS X partition to take up the rest of the space, or create another partition in the free space (if the free space is not adjacent to the OS X partition).\nHowever, since you have two MacBook Airs, this gets considerably more tricky. The MacBook Air does not have a Firewire port, so it doesn't support Target Disk Mode. And you can't boot from the Installer disk (to bypass mounting the internal HD) because the new Air comes with a recovery partition instead.\nThe only thing that could conceivably work is to buy or make an installer USB drive and use that to boot your new Air and use the restore USB that came with your old Air to boot that one, connect them to the same network (via USB to ethernet, if you have the adapters) then pipe the dd through nc. This will take a long time, especially over Wifi, but it's in theory possible.\n\nA: You can use SuperDuper!\n", "Q: Is there a way to make the alarm clock much much louder? I'm trying to treat my iPhone as an alarm clock. But, it's not working. I'm not a light sleeper and the iPhone \"alarm clock\" does not have that kind of explosive power my traditional alarm clock has. \nIs there a way to make the alarm clock much much louder? \n\nA: I would suggest that you try a few alert tones to see if any of them give you better performance. Volume dynamics vary from alert to alert. By going into the click app and tapping Alarm > Edit and selecting any alarm you will see the settings that you can change. One of the settings you can change for a given alarm is Sound. Tap this option to select the tone you would like to use.\nOne tone you might find more to your liking is the one titled \"Alarm\" — this tone is much more \"explosive\" than the standard \"Marimba tone.\nYou could also try recording your own tones in GarageBand. GarageBand has a project type for iPhone Ringtones. When you create your own ringtone you have much more control over the specifics of the ringtone and can even do things to increase the gain on the tone itself.\nOf course none of these tips will do anything to increase the actual power of the built in speakers (which are necessarily small). One thing you could do to help in that regard is to think carefully about where you place your phone. Placing your phone in a glass cup at night (while a bit dangerous in the morning when you go groping for it) can increase the volume significantly.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: There is not much you can do with the built in speakers of the iPhone. My biggest suggestion would be using external speakers connected through an auxiliary cable or something similar. \n\nA: You could try...\n\n\n*\n\n*Plugging in some speakers or connecting a bluetooth speaker\n\n*Putting your phone in a container (like a Tupperware or a bowl) to focus the sound\n\n*Turning up your ringer volume all the way\n\n\nYou could also try downloading one of the following apps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Loud Alarm Clock FREE\n\n*Alarm Clock Free for iOS 8\n\n*SpinMe Alarm Clock - Guaranteed Wake Up for Deep Sleepers\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to Clock\n\n*Go to Alarm\n\n*Edit/Create Alarm\n\n*Go to Sound\n\n*Select Sound\n\n*Turn up volume with side up button while sound is playing\n\n*BAM!\n\n\nA: Why yes - there is an accessory for just that purpose.\n\nSeveral musical instrument recyclers/artists - notably Christopher Locke - make and sell a selection of iPhone, iPad and other amplifiers that will make your iOS alarm clock much louder.\n\nA: Yes you can increase the volume. Go to settings, then sounds the look for ringer and alerts. Slide the bar to increase or decrease volume. If you have an iPhone this will also increase the volume of your ringtone. \n", "Q: Can I detach the QuickLook window from the Finder? I use QuickLook a lot to quickly open PDF files. I like the speed and clutter-free presentation more than using Preview.\nBut unfortunately, it is tied to the Finder and disappears when I change to another app, so that I cannot see it side-by-side with another application. Is there a way to detach the QuickLook window so that it can exist on its own?\n\nA: Yes Thilo, there is a way. It will require a bit of command line wizardry though. As long as you're not allergic you can do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal.app \n\n*Change directories to the location of the file you want to view using QuickLook.\n\n\n*\n\n*For example, if the file you want to view using QuickLook is on your desktop you would type: \"cd ~/Desktop\" (no quotes, caps matter, and ~ is a shortcut to your home directory).\n\n\n*Now type: \"qlmanage -p filename.pdf\" (replacing filename with the name of your file and pdf with the extension of your file).\nA new icon will appear in your Dock called \"qlmanage\". This is the helper application that is usually launched headlessly by the Finder.

I recently enabled FileVault on OSX Lion. All seems to have gone well - it asks for my password before booting as expected, however it asks for it twice. Basically, it asks for my password, boots for a 30 seconds, restarts, asks for my password again - and then everything boots OK.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this (annoying) normal behavior? (From everything I've read - it isn't).\n\n*If not, does anyone have a remedy, or at least suggest a place to start looking as to why it might be doing this?\n\n\nHardware: MBP 13\" Early 2011.\n\nA: FileVault will ask for the disk encryption password to unlock the disk before booting the OS - once the disk is unlocked, it proceeds with booting as normal, at which point it will ask for your login password. Only certain users are allowed to unlock the disk. So, when you first turn it on, it'll ask you to authenticate to unlock the disk, then it'll ask you to authenticate to login. This sounds like what you're experiencing, and it is normal.\nEDIT: Check the answer below, this is in error. Are you unlocking the drive with the same account you're logging in to?\nThis article goes into more detail. Specifically:\n\nUpon selecting \"Turn On FileVault\", if your Mac has multiple user accounts, you will be asked to identify the user accounts that will be allowed to unlock the encrypted drive (to start the computer or recover from sleep or hibernation).\nUsers not enabled for FileVault unlock will only be able to log in to that Mac after an unlock-enabled user has started or unlocked the drive. Once unlocked, the drive remains unlocked and available to all users, until the computer sleeps, hibernates, or is shut down.\n\n\nA: Per the comments, I decided to re-install Lion to see if the problem would go away. It did. Once I started setting everything up, the issue popped back up again. After doing trial-and-error, I've concluded that the problem is related to Parallels Desktop 7. Uninstalling the product removes the symptoms, and re-installing brings them back. I've opened a support ticket with Parallels to see if they are aware of the issue.\nOnce I narrowed it down the Parallels, I did some digging on their forums and it turns out many other people are having the same issue.\nUPDATE:\nThis has been fixed via an update tp PD7.\n\nA: I don't know enough about how login info is passed from the preboot authentication/unlock system to the OS login to know what might've broken, but here are some generic test/info gathering steps:\nCheck the log files in the Console utility, and see if they indicate any problems during the boot process.  Click Show Log List in the toolbar to get shortcuts to the standard log locations.  The most relevant logs are probably All Messages, system.log, and /var/log > secure.log.\nTry changing your password, and see if that resynchronizes something.\nTry creating another account and see if it works better (it should automatically be set up for FileVault).\nFinally, the brute force option: try turning FV off & back on.  Note that while FV handles being turned on & immediately back off well, turning it off & back on is a little flakier.  I recommend turning it off, waiting for the disk to finish decryption, then rebooting, and only then turning it back on again.\n\nA: *\n\n*No it's not a normal behavior.\n\n*Try re-setting your password.\n\n\nThe most probable reason is that OS X's record of your password and FileVault's record gets out of sync. (FileVault2 is a pre-boot environment and starts before OS X boots). Re-setting your password (after you have logged in, of course), forces these two records to sync.\n", "Q: What do the new Terms and Conditions for the iTunes Store mean?

It is free in the Mac App Store.\n\nA: Apple Configurator\nApple released another program in April 2012 with considerably expanded capabilities. \nThis should come much closer to meeting your needs.\n\nPrepare devices\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Configure up to 30 devices at a time \n  \n*Update devices to the latest version of iOS Create and restore a backup of settings and app data from one device to other devices \n  \n*Import apps into Apple Configurator and sync them to new devices\n  \n*Use the built-in editor to create and install iOS configuration profiles \n  \n*Enroll devices with your Mobile Device Management solution for remote management\n  \n  \n  Supervise devices\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Organize supervised devices into custom groups\n  \n*Automatically apply common configurations to supervised devices\n  \n*Quickly reapply a configuration to a supervised device and remove the previous user’s data\n  \n*Import apps into Apple Configurator and sync them to supervised devices*\n  \n*Define and apply common or sequential names to all devices\n  \n*Restrict supervised devices from syncing with other computers\n  \n  \n  Assign devices\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Add users and groups manually or autopopulate via Open Directory or Active Directory\n  \n*Check out a device to a user and restore the user’s settings and data on that device\n  \n*Check in a device from a user and and back up the data for later use, possibly on a different device\n  \n*Apply custom text, wallpaper, or the user’s picture to a device’s Lock screen\n  \n*Import and export documents between your Mac and Apple Configurator\n  \n*Sync documents between assigned devices and Apple Configurator\n  \n\n\nA: You may want to have a look at Apple's iPad Enterprise Resources page. It has deployment guides, but I think the options you can set are more along the lines of security profiles and such. I'm not sure if general settings type options are in there. Worth a look however, as to my knowledge it's the only way of managing iOS settings other than manually on each one.\n", "Q: What Does A \"There is a user sharing this computer...\" Window Mean? I was trying to turn off my Macbook Pro and suddenly got this message. As far as I know, there's no reason why this should be happening. Anyone want to fill me in on some possibilities?\n\n\nA: Apparently, you've enabled File Sharing in the Sharing section of System Preferences. Someone on your network has connected to your computer, either as a registered user or as a guest. \nUnless this kind of access is absolutely required, it's good security practice to disable both File Sharing and the Guest user in System Preferences -> Sharing and System Preferences -> Accounts and Groups, respectively.\n", "Q: Is there an utility which can profile and report on the activity of a single process? Activity monitor can report on a single processes's disk and cpu usage at a single point in time.\nThe \"Sample Process\" feature is good for debugging, but doesn't provide easily digestible information.\nApps like iStat are just pretty layers on top of activity monitor.\nIs there an app for OSX which will sample a Processes's resource use over time and then provide a report with nice graphs?\nSomething like DaisyDisk but for cpu and disk usage for a single process over time?\n\nA: I think BigTop is what you're looking for. It comes with the Developer Tools (which are on the install disc that came with your Mac)\n", "Q: Magsafe adapter not \"fitting\" in to MacBook Pro I have a Mid-2009 MacBook Pro, and all was well before the weekend. Now when I try to fit in the MagSafe charger to the macbook, I am unable to fit it in correctly (but as you can see, it is charging):\n\nWhen I tried to see what was in the macbook side of the adapter, I see some small balls:\n\nThese are not stationary but are sticking to the magnet there. Tiny little balls like this:\nThe plug looks like this:\n\nNow, I am worried whether the magsafe power adapter has somehow started \"disintegrating\" (touch wood) or are these some kind of debris I collected somewhere. All was fine on friday and I travelled with my macbook pro over the weekend. I did not use the charger, neither did I travel to some industrial area to collect metallic debris.\nLong story short: should I remove these balls and forget all these, or is it something bigger to worry...\n\nA: You might want to check your power adapter's plug as to whether the debris stems from there. If the plug is all right, I'd just remove the debris and not worry any more about it.\n\nA: I have a macbook air bought in 2017. As I put it into my laptop bag with power pin at the bottom, it picked up a used stapler pin lying there. Power pin just would not sit properly. I removed it and it is working good now! Advice and lesson learnt - put the laptop with power pin facing upwards!\n", "Q: Can an app window be minimized by clicking its Dock Icon? Something that bothers me as Windows user on OS X is that I can't minimize an app window by clicking the dock icon of the application. Is there a hidden setting for enabling this behavior or a utility that someone could recommend?\n\nA: Right click on the Icon and choose Hide\n\nA: ⌘+M  or double-click the window title bar to minimize the window.\n\nA: As you can see, there isn't a way to click the dock. Another option past the accepted answer of using a keyboard shortcut is to enable hiding from clicking the window's title bar.\nOpen System preference, select General, select Double-click a window's title bar to minimize'. On Lion this is above the control for Sidebar icon size.\n\nA: click and hold on the applications icon in the dock and choose hide \n\nA: The trouble is, if you hide (ALT-click or CMD-H), you hide all windows of that application. You probably don't want to do that, just to minimize the current window.\nIn OS X you don't have the Title Bar, with an item for each open window (eg. 3 different items for 3 windows of the MS Word) - but instead, an indicator for applications that have open windows, but nothing indicates how many windows are open... so you don't actually know where to click in the Dock to minimize which exact window (if more windows of the same app are open). You can right-click on the app in the Dock, then you'll get the list of the open windows, but that's for people with muuuuch time to spend clicking. For Zen practitioners :-)\nSome Windows-like behavior can be achieved with 3rd party tools like HyperDock, but I don't remember I had a way to click a window to minimize it. But frankly I tested it for a really short time.\n\nA: Simple answer is it'll bring the window to the front. Command H hides the window however, so that might be a bit more useful to you.\n\nA: One thing that is significantly different between Windows and OSX is how OSX treats, well, windows in an app. An application can have more than one individual window. Each window is treated independently of the application itself. \nSo, if you want to minimize a specific window, instead of the Dock icon (which is for the application) you want to use any of the options for window minimization:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the yellow ball in the title bar\n\n*Command + M\n\n\nYou can't actually minimize an application (you can get that effect if there is only one open window and you minimize that window). The \"Hide\" effect is probably what you are looking for. \n\nA: You can hide an active application by option-clicking (alt-clicking) its icon in the dock. You can also hide the active window and open another window by alt-clicking whatever application you want to open in the dock.\nBut I agree with you that it would be more symmetrical to be able to click to minimize all the open windows in an application. I am a long-time PC user and this is one area where PCs got it right. That and combining closing and quitting (and the related window management issue).\n\nA: Press and hold ⌘, use tab to select the application and then press H to hide it. Now release ⌘.\nDo the same to unhide the application.\n\nA: In MacOS if you use HyperDock you can press Shift+Click on Dock icon, and it will Hide the application. It's equivalent to pressing keyboard shortcut Cmd+H - Hide.\nBut realy it hides ALL the app windows. \nHyperDock currently does not have option to Click to minimize/hide..\n", "Q: Is it possible to increase history length on iPhone Safari? Is it possible on Safari for iPhone to increase the length of the browsing history? It seems to only keep one week of browsing history, which makes it hard to go back to stuff more than a week later. \n\nA: I don't think this is possible without a jailbreak of your iPhone.\nThe history should clear it's self twice in a month - but how the logic is (every 1. and 15. ??) - I don't know.\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to have more than 1 week of history... by upgrading the iPhone to iOS 7 or newer.\nOn iOS 7, Safari keeps roughly 1 month of history.\n", "Q: This PDF displays with question marks instead of letters Something is wrong with the rendering of this PDF in Preview (or Quick Look). This is how it looks:\n\nI can see it in Adobe Reader on Windows. I'm not sure what font it is using, and I have Office 2011 installed, so I have all of those fonts. Why is it displaying question marks on everything (except the text in the bottom left)?\nI'm using Lion 10.7.1 on a 2010 17\" MacBook Pro.\n\nA: Try Adobe Reader for Mac.  Sometimes Preview is not a perfect substitute for that.\n\nA: Opening the PDF in Chrome makes it readable.\n\nA: It looks like all the previous answers to this question are completely uninformed. I suggest that you completely disregard all of them. It is unlikely, for instance, that telling the document creator that what they did was faulty will really get you anywhere.\nFirst, it's likely that they did not embed fonts, yes, but there are many fonts that carry flags telling apps NOT to embed them. This is an especially favorite trick of Microsoft products. Presumably they do not want people to be successful using non-Microsoft products (at least, that's what the documents in their antitrust case indicated), so they make it as painful as possible to transfer documents from Windows to Mac. Other companies know about this, and they may try to compensate. For instance, Adobe may license fonts to make the process more transparent to the end user but Apple may not have the same license for Preview. There is a lot going on behind the scenes. \"Correctly\" embedding the font won't get to the root of the problem either.\nSecond, you say that this document was created by someone \"already not very good with computers.\" It would be ridiculous to tell such a person to correctly embed fonts. It's not even fair to consider the lack of font embedding as an error since you could quite possibly install the fonts, depending on the license, in a place where Preview can see them.\nThird, it is naive to claim that Preview is at fault because it can't find a font when you have not told it where to find the font.\nYou can compensate for this. I can think of at least three ways.\nFirst, if the creator wants to embed fonts, they may be able to and they may be able to choose similar fonts with different licenses if that is the source of the problem. In the displayed example, there is a correctly rendered font in the lower left hand corner. The creator could possibly use that font throughout.\nSecond, if you don't want to go to the document creator, you can apply one of several software solutions. I prefer open source software so, when I receive a file like this, I use the free, open source ps / pdf tools you can get with Xpdf. The problem with this solution is that many people don't want to use open source or feel uncomfortable with it. There are projects to make it easier on Mac. I use a package installer called macports to make it easier for me. Having done that, I would solve this problem by typing the following two lines in the terminal:\npdftops badfile.pdf intermediatefile.ps\npstopdf -o goodfile.pdf intermediatefile.ps\n\nThis will effectively replace the non-embedded fonts in badfile.pdf with their nearest Postscript core font equivalents. For me this is usually adequate. If the image in the above picture is going to be part of a book, you may need the fonts to match. In this case, you must either learn more about fonts or purchase non-free software. Depending on the circumstances, the options to the commands mentioned above may be modified to match fonts precisely.\nThird, if this is a book project and you are uncomfortable with free software, you should try using a combination of Adobe Acrobat (not the free Adobe Reader) and Adobe Distiller to convert the document from pdf to ps, put the desired fonts in place, and convert the document back to pdf. I just googled and saw that there are a number of hits for tutorials for doing this process.\nBy the way, as a former professor, I feel that students who don't \"try and get them to change their ways\" are not doing me or the other students a favor.\nSometimes there are legitimate reasons why professors resist change. I don't know about your cases. If the professor is \"already not very good with computers\" you might want to use psychology. Since you are in a college or university, there are probably some experts around who could help you. Maybe the prof feels threatened or confused in an area outside his expertise. Maybe he's afraid students will think he's generally stupid. Who knows? ... But you might be able to figure it out and help everyone in the class. Good luck!\n\nA: The problem is most probably not with displaying the PDF on the Mac.\nThe problem is most probably that this is a faulty PDF created by someone who made an error, or does not understand how to make them correctly.\nThe person who generated the PDF on Windows used a method which did not embed the fonts from the source document into the PDF. Therefore anybody who views this PDF, on Windows, Mac or any other platform, will not see the fonts unless they happen to have that particular custom font already installed on their system.\nYour best hope is to contact the person who generated the PDF and ask them to make a new PDF from the source document and to make sure that fonts are properly embedded.\nIf you open this PDF in Adobe Reader you can use File: Properties and then the Fonts tab to get a list of the names of all the fonts that are referenced in the document. It should also list the names of the fonts which are NOT properly embedded. You can use this information if you can get the person who created the PDF in the first place to make a new one.\n\nA: In my case, I embed the font in the pdf file. Acrobat Reader for Mac display the font properly (the intended font, not a subtitute). Preview show black squared, some sort of a bar code.\nIt's a Preview problem. \n", "Q: Unopened .mac box - any value? I found an unopened .mac box. It's still in its plastic wrap, so the subscription code has not been used. Is this of any value or should it simply be thrown away?\n\nA: Apple takes applications for refunds for MobileMe boxes. I don't know if they would give a refund for .Mac or not, but it's worth trying.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4445\n\nA: If you can't get a refund (you may need a receipt to do so), since it's an actual box, you might think about donating it to\nShrine of Apple. New site set up looking to collect and preserve every Apple product they can find in an online museum of sorts.\n", "Q: Will my iPhone charge slower if I connect it to my laptop? \nPossible Duplicate:\nCharging an iPhone, difference between USB port and power outlet \n\nWill my iPhone charge slower if I connect it to my laptop than if I connect it directly to the plug ?\n\nA: Most computer can’t charge an iPhone as rapidly as the dedicated wall chargers sold by Apple. The exception to this generalization is some macs do charge iOS devices rapidly. The iPhone 4 and most other iOS devices are designed to charge at higher currents than the baseline USB can power. \n\nMany newer Apple products will provide up to 1100mA of charging current at 5V even though the USB specification limits current to 500mA at 5V.\n\nThis will certainly charge an iPhone 4 faster than most computers or \"by the spec\" USB chargers. The The iPad 10W charger is much faster than the iPhone charger so I don't know who would win in a race - a mac with extra operating current, the US iPhone adapter, the UK iPhone adapter or perhaps the Swedish iPhone adapter\nThe Mac/USB bus details are documented at Apple Computers and Displays: Powering peripherals through USB as well as in the iPad: Charging the battery article. The nice picture is from the \"Powering through USB article\".\n\nA: If your laptop is a MacBook it is actually possible that it will charge faster than if connected directly to the plug. This is because MacBooks are able to provide a bit more power through their USB ports than the USB standard specifies (specifically to charge iPads).\nAt least this is what I observed with my iPhone.\n\nA: Charging via your laptop will be slower than charging via the wall.\nYour computer's USB port does not deliver the same amount of power as plugging it directly into the wall. It also does not deliver a constant amount of power. USB will deliver a different amount of power depending on a number of software and hardware related variables.\nSometimes the OS will give you a \"USB low power notice\" when it no longer has enough power to supply the attached devices.\nYou can can confirm this by reading this Apple Knowledge Base ticket:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht1476\nHere's the relevant excerpt,\n\nFor the quickest charge, connect iPhone or iPod touch to a power outlet using the USB cable that came with the device and a USB power adapter.\n\nSome things that make charging via your computer even slower include having multiple USB devices plugged in while you are attempting to charge, or charing while also syncing your data.\nYou should also note that Apple produces a couple of different wall chargers. This probably wont make any difference with your iPhone but if you have an iPad as well it will. Some suspect that an iPad charger may charge an iPhone faster but I have found no evidence to support this conclusion.\nhttp://store.apple.com/us/question/answers/product/MC359LL/A?pqid=QYDH9JY74XJHX2A7HATYY4CK7XHD42UHJ\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Mouse movement in Windows like Mac While most people seem to want the Windows mouse movement on their Mac, I'd like it the other way around!

I've got an iPhone 4 (running iOS 4.3.5) and iTunes (v10.4.1) on a Mac running OS X (10.6.8). \nWhen connected to iTunes, I've got the Music -> Sync Music -> Include voice memos option unchecked, but that seems to have no effect. Each time I sync the phone, all the new voice memos are pulled down to iTunes and dropped in my library. \nSo, the question is: How can I prevent iTunes from pulling down the voice memos and just leave them on my iPhone?\n\nA: Currently, there doesn't seem to be a way to prevent iTunes from pulling in the voice memos. The closest I've been able to figure would be to have a script or launchd item that simply removes anything that it sees. Preferable copying them to another directory for storage. \nUpdate: October, 2017\nI've switched to using Just Press Record which is dedicated to voice memos. It's fast to start and also creates transcripts. They're pretty good most of the time, but sometimes they get pretty far off. It's a nice feature, regardless.\nThe app costs a few bucks, but it's well worth it. (And, I like to support developers so they can keep working on software I like.)\n\nA: It's not that weird.  It does it for me too on 4 different Macs in my home.  The Apple Support Discussion site contains statements by many others experiencing the same thing. I don't know if it's a bug in iTunes, the voice memo app, or what.  Just be careful.  If your sharing your music library on a network you're also sharing those voice memos with everyone on the network since they're in your music library.\nWish Apple would create a separate category for Voice Memos in iTunes and get them out of the music library. And they need to fix this syncing issue. I've written feedback submissions about this. I encourage others to do the same.\n\nA: I figured out: You have to MARK \"include music videos\" and not mark \"Include voice memos\". It´s strange, since what I wanted had nothing to do with music videos. If you not mark \"include music videos\" it doesn't work.\n\nA: My solution is not perfect, but it is better than hearing some private voice memo when the music library is played among people... It is also better than having to remember to delete them all the time.\nThe solution is the following: \n1) go to \"/Users/yourusername/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media\"\n2) right click on the \"Voice Memos\" folder and select \"Info\"\n3) in the \"General Properties\" section select \"Locked\"\nThat's it. This prevents all apps from accessing the Voice Memos folder. This also means that iTunes cannot copy voice memos to that place. \nThere is only one slight inconvinience with this solution, however. When trying to synchronize new voice memo iTunes shows an alert complaining that it was unable to access the disc. But this only happens during the first synchronization after new memos have been added. Until You add new memos, the alert box will not appear. So I would say this is only a slight inconvenience compared to necessity of remembering that memos have been added and deleting them. Or listening to Your private memos being played to people listening to Your music...\nSource: http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-come-on-voice-memos-in-itunes.1533972/\n\nA: Did you try looking on the device's \"Music\" tab?\n\n\nA: First, select all voice memos in your library. Then right click on the selected multiple items and open 'Get Info'. Open the 'Options' tab and select Media Kind as 'Voice Memo' and keep the box checked. Close it.\nThen, unckeck 'include voice memos' from the Music section on the iPhone in iTunes.\nNow sync your iPhone without including voice memos !\n", "Q: Useful Chrome extensions for OS X I know there is already a post out there for Safari extensions, but Chrome extensions are completely different.

Seen various solutions.  But practically all of them are for people who want to see their Ubuntu desktop on their Mac, with both machines on the local network.\nI want to log into an Ubuntu server that lives across the continent.  I can easily log in over SSH, and I managed to get X11 configured such that I can SSH in, run sudo synaptic, and get the Synaptic window to come up on my machine to manage packages.\nHowever, what I would really love is to be able to log in to the remote machine and see the desktop as if I were physically standing there.\nRemote machine is running Ubuntu 10.4, I’m on OS X 10.6.8.  I have admin rights on both machines.  I also updated the bundled X11 on OS X to the latest version of XQuartz.\nAnyone know if (and how) this is possible?\n\nA: You can do it easily using ssh port forwarding. Open terminal and enter\nssh -L 5900:localhost:5900 remote_ip\nwith any other applicable settings you need. This will forward port 5900 on your local machine to port 5900 on the remote machine. If you need to change to a different local port (say, if you're already running a VNC server on your local machine), change the first 5900 to something else.\nThen once the ssh connection is running, just VNC to localhost:5900, and you should get a connection to your remote machine.\nIf you don't have a VNC client already, there's one built in to Mac OS X. Open Finder, press ⌘K and enter vnc://localhost:5900 as shown below, and hit connect.\n\n", "Q: Keynote - Print Slide with Notes I know there is a way in Keynote to print your slides with notes. However, on some of my slides I have notes that are VERY long (as in a couple of pages). I'd like to print these off as handouts, but after the text gets to this point (in length) the slide (when printed) will SHRINK the text to fit. I'd prefer if the overflow text would go onto a new page. So that when it prints I have one page with the slide at the top and then notes beneath and then the rest of the notes print on the additional pages. \nCan this be done? If so, how? \n\nA: I don't believe there is a way to overflow the text. Your easiest bet is to make do with the smaller text size. Another alternative (which may require more work but could lead to a nicer design) would be to export a PDF of just the slides, then use Pages/Acrobat/Word/etc to build a document with both the text and slides by hand.\n\nA: There are a couple of AppleScripts / Automator Actions around that will extract the text from the Presenter notes, so that you can easily create a Pages/Word document to act as handouts.\nYou can also export your slides as images to add to the pages/word doc.\nSee:\nhttp://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/2010/07/07/extracting-speakers-notes-from-keynote/\nAn automator action from David Weinberger to extract speakers notes.\nhttp://www.tuaw.com/2012/12/10/send-keynote-presenter-notes-to-evernote-with-applescript/\nSending Keynote presenter notes to Evernote with AppleScript.\nand http://humbledown.org/keynote_speakers_notes.xhtml \n\nan XSLT stylesheet that you pass your Keynote presentation to, and it outputs an XHTML document with the titles and thumbnails of each slide along with the speakers notes \n\nI have not tested these yet!\n\nA: You can control the size of the text in the speaker's notes. Pulling back to a 12 point font will greatly increase how much text displays. \nBut if, even at 12 points, you have multiple pages of notes for the slide, your best bet maybe to insert text pages into the handout.\n\nA: A simple workaround is to duplicate the slide and split the speaker notes across the two (or more). If you have no transitions between slides, no one in the audience will know that you clicked between them.\n", "Q: What does 9:41 mean? As you may have noticed, the time in iPhone/iPad advertisements has always been 9:42 am, and it's recently (?) switched to 9:41.\nWhy the original 9:42, and also, why the switch?\n\nA: I've heard it was used because that was the approximate time at which the iPad was revealed originally, and given the Apple attention to detail, the clock had to match up. It was used in everything else because a lot of the same materials were used in the presentations as in the ads.\n", "Q: How do I send C-/ (that is, control-slash) to the terminal? I'm trying to run Emacs in a terminal. I've turned on the \"use option as meta\" in terminal preferences and so it's about 95% working right.\nThe key sequence ctrl-/ (or in Emacs notation C-/) is \"undo\". This key sequence just causes the terminal to ring a bell. How do I fix this?\n\nA: Control-/ is not a part of the set of standard control codes. It is not directly representable as a keystroke in many terminal emulations. Such a keystroke is only properly detectable in certain platform-specific “scancode modes” or “GUI mode” (where the API tells you exactly which keys and modifiers are being used). Your terminal emulator is beeping because it is effectively an invalid keystroke.\nThe standard control codes only cover “Control” versions of\n\n\n*\n\n*@ A–Z [\\]^_ (ASCII 0 - 31), and\n\n*? (ASCII 127)\n\n\nIn most terminal emulator programs running with most US key layouts you may need to press Shift to generate some of the “Control codes”:\n\n\n*\n\n*C-@ is ControlShift2 (since @ is Shift2)\n\n*C-^ is ControlShift6 (since ^ is Shift6)\n\n*C-_ is ControlShift- (since _ is Shift-)\n\n*However, C-? may not always be ControlShift/ (since ? is Shift/); C-? is usually generated by either Backspace (on Apple keyboards, the key labeled just “delete” without the additional symbol ⌦) or Delete (the one with ⌦ on Apple keyboards).\n\n\nIn tty-based Emacs, you can usually use C-_ for undo instead of C-/.\n\nA: Ctrl-/ sends 0x1f which is equivalent of Ctrl-_ since the days of VT102.  There are many VT100 emulators but they are actually VT102 emulators. iTerm2 works because it's following this behavior.\nOnly emulators that strictly conform to VT100 specification can't send Ctrl-/.  I believe the Terminal app is one of them.\nVT100 masks 2 most significant bits of 7 bit ASCII when the control key is pressed.  / is 0x2f, o is 0x6f.  When the 2 bits are masked they are both 0x0f.  VT100 can send Ctrl-o but not Ctrl-/.\n\nA: FYI, my problem is to know how to keymap Ctrl+\\ and it turns out this is helpful: https://www.physics.udel.edu/~watson/scen103/ascii.html.\nyou can use this as an example to find what you want Ctrl+/\n\n\nA: Thanks for this answer: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/260566/472959, add this content to ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict:\n{\n    \"^/\" = \"noop:\";\n}\n\nthen reboot, this annoying bell will disappear.\n", "Q: What is the difference between .command, .tool, and .sh file extensions? I saw a couple of questions about executing command line scripts? I saw that the .command and .tool extensions were mentioned. I have always used .sh. What is the difference between these different scripts? Do some extensions allow for different commands?\n\nA: I believe that .sh files are \"owned\" by Xcode by default, so if you were to double-click on one of them, it would open in Xcode instead of executing.\n.command and .tool files are owned by Terminal by default, so if you double-click on one of them, it will open and execute in Terminal.\nI am not aware of any other differences between them.\nI, too, have used .sh for shell scripts, but I've recently stopped because I've started writing my shell scripts in Zsh instead of sh, and it was confusing to try to remember whether a certain command ended in .sh or .zsh, so I finally just put them all in ~/bin/ and made sure they were executable, and don't use file extensions on them at all.\n\nA: *\n\n*.command - (Terminal shell script) Specifically associates a shell script with Terminal. Sometimes referred to as a \"Terminal File.\"\n\n*.tool - (Terminal shell script) Same as the \".command\" file extension.\n\n*.sh - (Shell Script) A basic shell script that is associated with Xcode 4.1.\n\n\nProgrammatically, I'm sure the difference between the first two (.command vs. .tool) are subtle, while the third is essentially a simple, default shell script. And does in fact associate with Xcode 4.1.\n\n", "Q: Change computer Apple TV uses to connect to iTunes I have the newest version of Apple TV. Firmware is up to date. \nI set it up in the apartment I used to share with my girlfriend until about a week ago when I moved away for school. After I left, she found herself not only without companionship but also unable to access Netflix or the iTunes store.\nI'm guessing this is because I set up the Apple TV using my mac, which is no longer in the apartment with the Apple TV. Assuming this is the case, I'm wondering: is resetting the Apple TV and going through the setup process again the best way for her to \"associate\" her mac with the Apple TV? Or is there an easy way to do this that won't wipe out all of the configurations we've made? \n\nA: On the Apple TV:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > Computers\n\n*Turn off Home Sharing\n\n*Turn on Home Sharing (it will ask if you want to use your Apple ID or connect using a different one)\n\n*Select the option to connect using another account\n\n*Have her enter her Apple ID and password in\n\n\nOf course for this to work, she will have to enable Home Sharing on iTunes on her Mac. For directions, see Apple's guide on setting up Home Sharing.\nAs for Netflix, you should just be able to log out and log in with a different account.\n\nA: Check that the network connection is functioning properly.  I agree with Q. Sheets' answer about resetting Home Sharing, but that should only affect iTunes/Store related items.  If Netflix isn't working, it's more likely a network problem as she should still be able to use your Netflix login.\nTry YouTube or some other Internet app to make sure the network is functioning.\n", "Q: What happened to some of the symbols in Mac OS X Lion? I was trying to make a mock-up for a video player on my browser and couldn't find the character for a speaker with three sound waves like you would normally see at the top of the screen for audio. When I went online to find the character value for it, I found this &#x1F50A; which renders 🔊 (what is now the Emoji speaker icon). How can I get the symbols I knew back?\n\nA: You may need to reinstall the fonts Symbola or Quivira on your Lion OS.  Also you may need to specifically select these fonts for the text where you want them to display.\n", "Q: How do I connect a Mac to an analog TV? Is it possible to connect my MBP with a Thunderbolt port to an old CRT TV? I think the TV has composite inputs at least, and maybe S-Video too.\nI'd also like to use other computers with the same TV, including one with a Mini DisplayPort and one with a DVI output (I think).\nI do video-editing and it's helpful to see my work on a TV.\n\nA: Instead of the 2-part chain Mini-DisplayPort-to-VGA-adapter --> VGA-to-RCA/composite-or-S-video-converter,\nyou could use this one-step converter:\nMini DisplayPort/ThunderBolt to RCA-composite/S-video converter (NTSC/PAL) (Amazon.com)\nMini DisplayPort/ThunderBolt to RCA-composite/S-video converter (NTSC/PAL) (HDTV Supply)\nIn addition to the above links, here is a corresponding Google search.\n\n\nA: The latest Mac models with either Thunderbolt or Mini DisplayPort can't directly output composite/S-Video (older Macs with micro-DVI could do this when using the right adapter).\nTherefore you need a converter box (powered via USB or separate power supply) that takes a VGA signal and converts it to composite or S-Video, which can be connected to the TV. You need to get one that can supply the correct video signal for your TV (PAL/NTSC/SECAM), although most will support all of those. These converters are available in a wide price range - generally the more expensive, the better the quality (of the signal).\n\nYou will also need a Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter to get a VGA signal from your Mac (this also works with the Thunderbolt MBP). For the computer with DVI output you will hopefully have a graphics card that can output a VGA signal, in which case you merely need a DVI to VGA adapter. If it outputs only DVI, you're in trouble, as you'll need another converter that converts this digital signal to a VGA one.\nAlternatively you could get a USB graphics card that outputs TV signals directly, although I can't seem to find one right now. This would be act like an additional monitor, which may be preferable.\nIn case your TV has SCART inputs (Europe mostly) instead of composite/S-video, you'll also need a SCART adapter, although this may be included with some of the products mentioned above.\nThe whole setup would look like this:\nMac -> Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter -> Converter box -> [SCART adapter] -> TV\n\n", "Q: How do I restore the default certificate settings in Snow Leopard? After the DigiNotar certificate debacle, I tried to remove their certificate from my Keychain. However, I think I deleted the wrong one. I am not sure which one it was, but trying to go to https://github.com in Chrome shows me a Error 202 (net::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID).\nWhoops. How can I restore the default certificates into my keychain?\n\nA: You want the two files ending in *.keychain found in /System/Library/Keychains (note that they may differ depending on your region, I'm not sure if things change depending on your geo-location). \nUnfortunately, there is no way to roll back unless you have a Time Machine backup, or the install files from the OS (then you can extract them using something like Pacifist).\nAlternatively, you can run Keychain First Aid from the Keychain Access menu and hope it fixes things but those likely will only deal with errors or anomalies in your user's keychain, not the system's.\nATTENTION: For those in a similar position, these are all the files located under /System/Library/Keychains from a default installation of Snow Leopard 10.6.8 (in North America).\n\nA: The fastest way back is to restore /System/Library/Keychains from your backup. Do make a backup now in case your system doesn't work properly after a reboot. \nThe next best is to install a clean copy of Snow Leopard onto an external drive. If your installer is older than the latest (or your preferred) patch level, do run updates ( or download and run the combo updater for your preferred ) to ensure you get any changes made to these files. Copy the same keychain files over once you've patched your rescue OS. \nFailing these, you might have (or want) to reinstall the entire OS. Things in /System or /Library can easily break the normal functioning of your mac if modified. \n", "Q: How I can browse servers over SSH in visually? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to mount SFTP/SSH in Finder on OSX Snow Leopard? \n\nI remotely manage many servers every day. I'm currently using Nautilus in Ubuntu and it's awesome. \nBefore buying a Mac, I'd like to know if there's anything similar or equivalent to browse SSH servers visually over SSH for OSX.\n\nA: You could connect to your remote host via sshfs over fuse. An implementation for OSX is MacFUSE. A nice fronted for macfuse is MacFusion.\nA crossplatform solution for accessing ssh/sftp enabled hosts is MuCommander which provides a commander-like interface to your remote host.\n\nA: Cyberduck does sftp so it can display remote files through an SSH connection.\n\nA: ssh -X \n\nwill do it in mac, this will open X11 on your mac when you start an x application in your ssh session to your server.\nthe ssh client is native to mac (because it is BSD based) and can be started from the terminal\nIf you are managing windows servers RDP for mac is excellent as well.\n", "Q: Playlist folder not showing songs from all child playlists I have created a playlist folder which contains 2 regular playlists (i.e. not smart playlists).  The hierarchy is like this:\nOccasions\n|\n+--- Party mix 1\n|\n+--- Party mix 2\n\nIn iTunes, if I click on the Occasions folder, I can see all of the songs from Party mix 1, but none of the songs from Party mix 2.\nI can't see any difference between the 2 playlists, and because it's not a smart playlist there aren't any settings available.\nShould a playlist folder automatically include all songs from its child playlists?  Any ideas about why it wouldn't be showing songs from both playlists?\n\nA: I had this happen to me for the second time recently. I just fixed it!\nI thought I looked up a fix the first time, which I haven't been able to find.\nHowever this is what I did just now.\nI copied the name of the playlist to the clipboard,\nthen I simply deleted the whole playlist (for me this was fine because it was one of MANY playlists in the folder, this one only having one song in it).\nCreated a new playlist in the folder, pasted the name in, then added the song to the playlist! Pop! It showed up in the folder now!\nFor you, I would probably drag all the songs to a new playlist outside of the folder, delete the playlist inside the folder, then either re-create the original playlist by creating another one in the folder and dragging all the songs from the 'backup' (outside the folder), or perhaps try dragging the 'backup' back into the folder straight away.\n*you could also try using the \"New Playlist from Selection\" function (command-shift-n) (under the file menu) (assuming Mac Platform).\nI of course can't try any of these other methods until I encounter this problem again.\nPLEASE NOTE: deleting the SONG from the playlist and then adding it again had NO EFFECT. The reference to the playlist itself seems to be the problem/bug.\nI'm running v10.5 (141), but this happened on an older version as well.\n\nA: The bug is playlist-specific and is created when you right-click a song in a playlist in a folder and choose \"add to new playlist\". This playlist will function properly in all ways except when when iTunes auto-generates a playlist containing all songs from a folder it does not recognize the said playlist. The playlist will be bugged until moved to another folder.\nThere are several ways to resolve this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fix a bugged playlist\nIf you know what playlist has the bug, simply move the playlist in and out of the folder once.\n\n*Avoid creating new playlists with this issue\nUse Cmd-N (or on Windows Ctrl-N) to create a new playlist instead of \"add to new playlist\". \n\n*Fix all bugged playlists\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a folder containing all your smart-playlists. \n\n*Put all other (non-smart) playlists and playlist folders into a new folder. \n\n*Create a smart-playlist outside the new folder which is set to generate all songs that are NOT in the new folder. \n\n*Right click each song in the new smart-playlist and move mouse over \"show in playlist\". If the result contains a non-smart playlist then that playlist is bugged, so fix it according to #1. If the result contains nothing, or only smart-playlists, then organize this song into a playlist which will remove it from this smart playlist. When this smart playlist is empty your library is not only bug-clean but all your songs exist in at least one playlist. You can keep this smart playlist for the future to find new bugged playlists and to help you keep your music library well organized. \n\n\n*Fix all bugged playlists (simplified)\nIf you dont want to go through all your non-playlist-organized-songs - because your library is a mess and you are too lazy to clean it up - then you should to do a manual re-set of each folder. The most efficient I have found to do this is to create a new folder in each folder, drag each other playlist and folder in OLD into NEW, then drag out NEW to the parent directory and then delete the now empty OLD. This will fix all bugged playlists. Now you need to fix all your smart-playlists which were pointing at folders, since the folders have been replaced.\nAlso, since you did not use #3 you need to be very careful to always follow follow #2 to not create new bugged playlists, since it could result in you needing to redo #4 once again. \n\nA: I was able to simply drag the playlists out of the folder, then drag them back in again.\n", "Q: Limit Spotlight to mail The thing is I hate Spotlight like every software burning my cpu for no reason when I am working and I could put my cpu to better use BUT it is required to search in mail bodies with Mail so I still keep it...\nWhat I really want to do is stop Spotlight to index anything but my emails, is there a way to do that ?\nI already added the biggest folders to the ignore list but it does not seems to be enough since as I am writing this mds is happily using between 10% and 30% of my cpu :/\n\nA: If mds is continually using that much CPU then something else is wrong, that's not usual behaviour. Once the index is created, it's incrementally updated and shouldn't be using that much CPU at all.\nHowever, you could try telling Spotlight only to display Mail Messages in searches. You'll find that option in System Preferences in the Spotlight section.

So I am thinking it has something to do with my Mac's keyboard (since it is a laptop keyboard, and not the full keyboard)? Or is there a setting that may be wrong?\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Is it possible that you have a global shortcut associated to the key sequence Ctrl + S ? Such a shortcut would get the sequence before it is sent to the Terminal and it would explain why it doesn't work with Term.app and iTerm2.app.\nYou can check for registered shortcuts in System Preferences, Keyboard, Keyboard shortcuts.

THe best solution is to upgrade your RAM or if it's already maxed, consider getting an SSD.\n\nA: I have a 2.16 GHz Core 2 Duo iMac that recently had this problem (I suspect it was caused by too many windows open under Safari) and I had searched on this site for a possible fix.  Nothing I tried worked, so I unplugged the iMac and planned on taking it in for a repair.  I got to thinking about the possibility that the mac's internal battery may be preserving the condition, preventing me from recovering from the freeze.  After having the Mac off the mains for 24 hours, I re-plugged it and fired it up and the freeze was gone.  I don't know if this was just dumb luck, but I don't have the freeze anymore.\n\nA: The thing is moving from Snow Leopard to Lion should not have caused a slow-down.  Period.  If it was running fine on SL, it should run fine on Lion.

Using the up and down arrows only move the screen one line at a time; is there any way to scroll faster?\n\nA: You can open man pages in a single, scrollable window from Terminal's Help menu. Just type the command into the search field in the Help menu, then click the command in the search results to open its man page. It may occasionally take a few seconds for the command to appear in the search results.\nYou can also find most man pages online, with Apple-specific man pages found on apple's developer library. I generally google with apple man [command] replacing [command] with the actual command. One nice thing about this method is you can easily bookmark man pages you use frequently.\n\nA: If I understood you correctly, you want to skim through manual pages more efficiently.\nBy default, man uses less as its pager. In less, you can use:\n\n\n*\n\n*Space or f or Control ⌃-f to advance one page\n\n*d or Control ⌃-d to advance half a page\n\n*b or Control ⌃-b to go back one page\n\n*u or Control ⌃-u to go back half a page\n\n\nYou can get the full list of less keyboard commands in its manual page. If you don't like the default pager, you can set MANPAGER or PAGER environment variables to specify a different program for controlling the pagination of man pages that are longer than one screen.\n\nA: Shift ⇧-Page Up ⇞ and Shift ⇧-Page Down ⇟ will move man pages a page at a time.\n(On a laptop or other smaller keyboard, the keystrokes are usually Shift ⇧-Fn-Up Arrow ↑ and Shift ⇧-Fn-Down Arrow ↓.)\n\nA: For non-Apple specific commands which tend to be the same across various UNIX platforms something I do is Google man [command] in a browser.

F3 still invokes Mission Control, and the other function keys, without modifiers, have their respective meanings (volume, play, etc), but I can only invoke LaunchPad with my hot corner or the Dock button.\nHow can I reset this to default behavior?\n\nA: One solution is to rm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist and log out and back in. I just tried this and it seems to have restored the binding, no hack like FunctionFlip required. My other special keys all work, too. However, I lost my other customized Keyboard Shortcuts, like ctrl+← for switching spaces Mission Control. They worked after I re-enabled them.\nIt looks like com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist is the preferences file, and MacOS works fine if it's missing. After I'd edited my Keyboard Shortcuts via the preferences panel that file was recreated and everything's back to normal except Launchpad launches again. Based on a diff of the two plist files I'm guessing the keycode for Launchpad is one of 118, 119, 64, or 65.\nI found this solution on a MacRumors discussion.\n\nA: To not lose your custom shortcuts, open ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist, look for the key named \"160\". Edit it as follows:\n\nThen Log Out and back in.\n\nA: I lost the F4 binding too, and after some investigation I got it working again. It's a bit of a hack, but here's what worked:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install FunctionFlip, a free preference pane to modify the function keys.\n\n*In FunctionFlip click F4: Launchpad, so it's checked.\n\n*In System Preferences / Keyboard / Keyboard Shortcuts, doubleclick on the keybinding for Show Launchpad and press F4.\n\n\nFunctionFlip should not be necessary: it should be enough to set the binding in Keyboard Shortcuts. The problem is by default the F4 key does not actually send the keycode for F4, it sends the magic code for LaunchPad. (Just like F8 isn't F8, it's pause iTunes.) And the Keyboard preferences pane won't let you bind that magic LaunchPad key. FunctionFlip solves the issue by making it so the F4 key really sends F4.\nNote that FunctionFlip is a bit tricky. For it to work, you have to enable System Preferences / Universal Access / Enable access for assistive devices. Also there's a \"Start FunctionFliip at Login\" preference that you probably want to enable. \nThe FunctionFlip page points to two tutorials for LaunchPad: TUAW and Josh Sunshine's. Same procedure as I describe above.\n\nA: I have just upgraded from Snow Leopard to El Capitan, and have the F4=Dashboard key on my keyboard.\nI have set fn+F4 to Launchpad, and turned Dashboard on, in System Preferences > Keyboard, but I wanted them the other way around so Launchpad would default.\nI did not want to add anything i.e. FunctionFlip\nThanks to Kentzo's answer above, I downloaded TextWrangler, opened\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist \nchanged Item 1's number from 118 to 130, \nlogged off, now working as desired.\n\nA: Ok, this is pretty weird. The item for Show Launchpad has to be checked (but not necessarily assigned to any regular shortcut) for fn+F4 to work:\n\n\nA: For anyone seeing this in 2017 on a Macbook Pro with touch bar, chances are you are using Spotify and it is the cause of the issue (see discussion). As of this post's date, there isn't a fix. The simplest workaround is to stop using Spotify.\n", "Q: Mac Pro gets stuck in \"safe mode\" after Lion upgrade Late 2009 Mac Pro, 8GB RAM, 1TB disk. \nI upgraded to Lion about a month ago. Running 10.7.1 now. Things started getting unbearably slow (windows slow to scroll), can't switch between programs without a long pause, etc.) Nothing obvious is running (checked ActivityMonitor, CPU is largely idle).  \nSome Googling suggested running Disk Utility to repair permissions. I did that, it finished quickly and without issue. For good measure I decided to reboot in safe mode and let it do a disk repair.\nBut it never gets past about the 10% mark in whatever it's doing when it enters safe mode (I just have the gray progress bar and spinner.) I let it run for about 4 hours and it didn't budge.  I powered it off, repeated, and same deal- always gets stuck in the same place in safe mode.\nAny suggestions on what could be wrong? The disk is large (1TB), but only 357GB in use. Should I let it run overnight? I miss the good old days when Unix kernels would print gobs of messages to the console, so you could at least figure out what it's doing.\nUpdate: so I re-ran Disk Utility and got the following: \nhttp://i.imgur.com/aG66g.png\nI don't have physical media for Lion, so I'm not sure what to do here. Can I do a disk repair from a Snow Leopard DVD?\nUpdate 2: Booted into the recover partition with Cmd-R. Ran the recovery successfully, system boots, it's fine. \nBut if I try safe mode it still hangs. Booting Cmd-V shows a quick fsck, then it boots up normally, so I can't see any problems there. It just seems to hang in safe mode.  \nUpdate 3: Booted single-user, ran fsck -fy as suggested by bmike. I let it run overnight, and it found no problems. Interestingly, I do get:\nE:[AppleUSBBluetoothHCIController][InterruptedReadHandler] Received kIOUSBHighSpeedSplitError error\n\non the console when I powered on my monitor. It repeats if I power-cycle the monitor. I have a USB Bluetooth wireless plugged into that monitor (which is in turn plugged into the Macpro's USB). \nThe USB-Bluetooth is there because my Macpro's internal Bluetooth arrived non-functional from the factory 2 years ago, and I gave up with Apple customer service on getting it repaired. I settled for the USB-Bluetooth plug to handle my bluetooth mouse.\nI wonder if having this USB-Bluetooth is somehow causing the Safe Mode hang.\n\nA: Boot to single user mode (Command-S) and see what fsck shows. \n\n\n*\n\n*/sbin/fsck -fy\n\n*repeat the prior up to three times if needed\n\n\nAssuming it boots, you can halt and then boot in verbose mode (Command-V) to restore all the console glory. \nYou can also peek at /private/var/log/system.log while on single user mode to see what was happening when the clock was passing faster than the gray progress bar. \n\nA: I was only able to solve this by doing a clean install of OSX Lion, then used Migration Assistant to copy over my data. Now I'm able to boot to safe mode successfully.\nWhat forced me into doing the clean-install was that my Time Machine backups started failing. I don't know why, but it would fail repeatedly trying to copy the same files (I could cp -a them just fine on the command line). Looking at the system logs, it was the same files every time.\nTM also failed to backup the system to my backup-backup TM drive (I alternate between two physical TM disks). It was only happy after I formatted one of the drives and started from scratch.\nHere's what I did in detail:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disabled Time Machine\n\n*Used Disk Utility to erase my TM drive (yes, I lost my historical backups).\n\n*Re-enabled Time Machine, set it to use the newly-formatted TM drive.\n\n*Let TM do a full Backup.\n\n*Booted using Lion installer on a USB key\n\n*Used Disk Utility to erase my Macintosh HD\n\n*Performed Lion install\n\n*Once booted to Lion, ran Migration Assistant to transfer my data from TM.\n\n\nI'm really not happy about losing my older backups, but I needed a stable system more than I needed the old data. \nThis has been a really frustrating experience. I'm very careful about backups, yet every other release or so, OSX manages to trash them for me.\n", "Q: Mac blogging client similar to Windows Live Writer Can someone suggest a really good blogging client for Mac OS? \nI am looking for something having similar functionality like Windows Live Writer (on Windows).\nBlog details: WordPress (installed on Windows).\nI have a Mac laptop at home, and am trying to decide on a blogging client for WordPress.\n\nA: I haven't had any exposure to live writer, but maybe you might want to give MarsEdit a try.

I'm always hearing that there is practically no malware threat in Mac OS: clearly claims that there is no Mac malware are exaggerated, but the received wisdom is that they are a negligible threat and anti-virus software isn't generally used unless required by a corporate policy.\nSo that being the case, why does OS X warn me before running an app downloaded from the Internet? What's the perceived risk exactly? Either there's a credible malware threat out there (in which case everyone should be running AV software) or there isn't (in which case the warning is unnecessarily obstructive).\n\nEdit for clarity in response to some surprisingly hostile replies: apologies if my terminology is misleading. I'm using \"virus\" loosely to mean malware that an anti-virus product would protect against. For example, a software site is hacked and the genuine download replaced with an infected version. A user downloads it in good faith and runs it. That's the kind of thing a good AV client would be expected to deal with: that's what I'm referring to.\n\nEdit for clarity 2 (not by OP): changed \"virus\" to \"malware\" in the question to further the distinction.\n\nA: Okay, I'm going to chime in.\nFirstly, let's look at your first question: Why does OS X warn a user before they launch it for the very first time?\nOS X had instituted the added precaution for one important reason: so that apps wouldn't seemingly launch on their own. Obviously it would be crippling to workflow if the confirmation popped up every time the app was launched, so a first-time only policy was instituted. And that seems to be sufficient if you give it some thought, as that means any app that runs without the confirmation has already been approved once before, thus making it a \"trusted\" application.\nThe implications here aren't measurable beyond this simple strategy. Apple wanted some assurance that programs wouldn't just be run without a level of consent. If they somehow happened to find their way on a user's machine, they wouldn't be thought of as something \"old\" or something \"trusted.\" It's not meant as a total safe-guard against malware, but rather almost as an important training tool. It gets the user to understand that OS X monitors these things. And that if an app is run, the system will be there to provide a little protection. If a user stumbles on a strange file somewhere, and double clicks on it, the system will check to see if it meets certain criteria. If it does, it'll notify the user that it's never been launched and is to be deemed \"potentially\" dangerous. It is then to the user to decide if they should run. It is a safeguard that does more to for user behavior than actual, hardcore system protection.\nSo it's not that there is a definitive threat. It is more a user-land security measure and perhaps even to be better thought of as a \"pre-emptive\" strike. To label it a clear cut case of either implement a security measure for a specific threat or axe it doesn't apply in this case (for the reason's above). Think of it more along the vein of Apple being pro-active (and quite clever). And it's not that obtrusive is it? Windows gives warnings each and every time. OS X delivers one just on the first run. It's a sane compromise.\nNow, to get to the second tail of your query (and excuse me if I'm paraphrasing here, but I think this is what you're driving at): Why doesn't OS X have an anti-virus program to deal with these threats instead?\nFirst, I think it's important to square away the terminology. There are no known viruses that have propagated into the wild for OS X. OS X is based on a Unix structure, which poses a seriously problem for virus-makers. In a nutshell (and excuse the oversimplification) Windows marks everything with executable rights. From images, to text files, to even music. This is ultimately what allows virus-makers to, for a lack of a better term, go to town. Unix doesn't exhibit this trait. It's crafty with its privileges. So the likelihood that OS X (and all Unix-based systems for that matter) will ever need an anti-virus is remote. Windows and Unix are fundamentally very different. Essentially, if you wanted to get a virus on OS X, you'd require either root access or significant user activity. You could not deliver and run it from simply opening up an email.\nNow that does not speak towards security, per se. OS X is not any more secure than Windows and this is a common misperception. This of course depends on your definition of security. It is largely immune to viruses (I use the term \"immune\" loosely here) but it is still susceptible to buffer-overlows that can allow root access. Charlie Miller has razed OS X in seconds numerous times at the Pwn2Own competition. He's a masterful security researcher, but putting that aside, he shows that OS X (along with pretty much everything else) is not an iron horse. It can be exploited just like every other system.\nBut the chances of being targeted by Lulzsec are rather slim. You'll likely face a gauntlet of script-kiddies that pack ready-made tools that serve more to aggravate than deliver a focused attack. To this day, only one has managed to make the rounds—enough to force Apple to step up it's security measures: Mac Defender. And even with Mac Defender's seaming success, it still required the user to navigate through a series of prompts via its native OS X installer (note that later versions didn't require an administrative password). So you have to take the \"success\" of Mac Defender with a grain of salt. It was likely successful because it was the first of its kind, and exploited more the user's blind faith in OS X than the system itself. People readily installed it thinking they were safe from harm because they aren't running Windows.\nSo in closing, OS X does not require an anti-virus because quite simply, there are no known viruses making their way out in the wild. Proof-of-concepts do exist, but again, the likelihood that they will one day wreak havoc is very remote simply because propogation is incredibly difficult to sustain. Malware, on the other hand, has shown itself to be a cause for concern. OS X now contains a built in safety feature (called a \"safe downloads list\") that can be viewed under the Security & Privacy section of System Preferences (General tab). This should protect users from future malware that follows the same trend as Mac Defender. Additionally, Lion has implemented sandboxing and privilege separation, which is a real significant step towards not only preventing malware, but solidifying the overall security of the system from even focused attacks.\nI hope that provides you with more insight into why Apple has decided to implement what looks like half-measures. It's important to bear in mind that security is always in direct conflict with usability. So the former must always be in balance to provide a semblance of the latter.\n\nA: The warning message about which you complain doesn't protect you against viruses, but against trojans, which are a different kind of malware. There aren't many trojans for OS X either, but they're much easier to create than viruses, and the warning is a sensible precaution to at least make you think once before opening something you just downloaded.\n\nA: Your question seems biased from your point of view. There is a real risk when running programs downloaded from the internet especially cause malicious websites don't need user interaction to actually download a piece of software.\nSo to me (and to Apple), it seems appropriate to warn the user a single time before running software downloaded from the internet, mentioning the actual source of the download.\nWindows does this as well nowadays btw.\n\nA: There is a credible threat. You have to understand that virus means different things to different people, but the entire reason of it is to let a user know that there's a possible attack vector there. \nFor example, I don't think it counts as a virus when you've entered your admin password and installed a piece of software that trashes your system, it's just malicious software. I do however think something that propagates without user knowledge is, Apple seems to take a tighter view of security in general so the warning is for the casual user, just so they know to be careful.\n\nA: You should note that there is a SIGNIFICANT difference between a self installing, under cover virus that automatically spreads itself and a malicious application the stupid enough user enters in their admin password.\n", "Q: iTunes/Mp3-Player and actual multi-tagging of MP3s I search for a software to allow multi-tagging.\nMeaning, i want to add more than one genre to a song/album to be able to easily access specific songs i.e. (\"female singer, jazz\" or \"duet, jazz\") which i can not realy do by choosing just one genre.\nIs there an option to do this with iTunes?\nIf not, is there a player able to do this?\nMaybe even with pandora/last.fm/musicbrains interface so i don't even have to tag all the songs myself?\n\nA: For a thorough analyse of the topic, read Ways to store multiple genres in your digital music, where Dan says:\n\nMP3. MP3s (or rather, the ID3 tagging format used by MP3s) don't support multiple tags for genre. Instead you must useone existing tag and use a delimiter character to separate the genres within that tag. \n\nIf you use iTunes player, I'd recommend to use the Grouping tag for that purpose.  \nNow, can you do that automatically ?\nAs you pointed out, Last.fm offers an interface to retrieve tags for songs.\nAnd bdefore used that API to develop an iTunes Multi-Genre Tagger (description blog post here, last version of the script here).

Does anyone know of any iPhone app that tracks distance accurately ?

I want to measure the distance I have jogged.\n\nA: The Nike+ GPS with a foot sensor has two sorts of input and can be more reliable than apps that only rely on GPS.\nThe main sources of foot sensor measurement error are:\n\n\n*\n\n*an odd gait (which will throw off the foot accelerometer - even when calibrated)\n\n*incorrectly calibrated foot sensor\n\n*your run routine typically covers several uneven stride lengths\n\n\nYou might be better with a foot sensor over a pure GPS application, but it's hard to tell in general.\nI find the hassle of a foot pod not worth the extra accuracy and use GPS only apps. The best for me is made by Abvio. Their GPS apps are superb and allow detailed control. The only downside is this adds complexity to the UI and you need to know a little to operate the tuning controls properly. (I chose the Runmeter over Cyclemeter or Walkmeter since I like a red color and the shoe icon's looks - they are all exactly the same engine and you can use all of the settings on any app - you don't need more than one to get all the route types.)\nThe developer is very responsive to email support - I was getting errors on my motorcycle settings and they guided me to get the accuracy I wanted since each activity type has some assumptions that can cause errors for some users.\nDepending on where and how you jog - this app allows you to tune and filter the raw GPS data to your liking. Since you can recreate this one path again and again, you should be able to get things dialed assuming it's not a problem with jogging in a canyon or under heavy tree / large buildings where interference and multipath effects will render all GPS faulty.\n\nA: I've been very pleased with RunKeeper on my iPhone 4, and my wife has been very disappointed with it on her 3Gs. We can only conclude that the GPS gear on the 4 is better than the 3Gs, though I don't recall that being in any of the marketing goods.\nWhen we run together, her phone routinely shorts us by maybe .1 mile every mile or so. But mine seems dead accurate. Same app, same version.\nThe conclusion is, the app doesn't have that much to do with the accuracy of the captured distance. \n\nA: This may be one of those questions where there is not a definitive answer. \nWhile it is up to each app developer to know how to better track, add and store each translation delta, how to determine the delta itself is up to the hardware, not the app. Location-aware apps use the same location-aware hardware and iOS' internal libraries via the Core Location API's. \nWhat this means is that not because an app is lousy in your neighborhood, that means that it will consistently be lousy everywhere else. It ultimately depends on how much information Core Location has available: Your phone will try and use triangulation to determine your translation deltas by looking at where things like cell phone towers and Wi-Fi hotspots are located. If all of this fails, then it will rely  on the actual GPS-provided location. \nAgain, this is all independent of which app you are using. So if you are in a location where there are not many Wi-Fi hotspots or where cell phone towers are not within reasonable reach, then you may want to use the Nike+ app--the one that does not use Core Location. This app requires you to have a Nike+ shoe with a transmitter. I have both apps and the shows with the transmitter and they measure distances around my neighborhood in a reasonably similar way. Hope this helps. \nUPDATE: \nA good source to understand how the iPhone location services work is by reading this article. I was wrong in stating that GPS is a fallback mechanism. Instead, the Wi-Fi and cellphone tower data assist the device in getting an initial location faster, before starting the actual GPS tracking. The reason for this is that the initial tracking is the most time and resource consuming operation. So GPS is still used at the end, just not right away. \nI believe the original point still holds: As the article states, your actual location may determine how well the device performs when using location hardware services. And because that is beyond the control of individual apps, I think that the same app may not perform the same way when compared to other apps in the same place versus a different place. That is why I think that this question cannot have a definitive answer that tells us that an app is truly always better than another one. \n\nA: My app of choice when it comes to GPS tracking is Kinetic GPS (iTunes link). From my answer to this question:\n\nIt's described as a swiss army knife for GPS tracking and I tend to agree. I had originally bought it to track backwoods bike rides but quickly found myself using it for all kinds of tracking: walks, runs, even car drives.\nThey have a modular approach to configuring the application. You can slice and view the data in all kinds of ways thanks to the pluggable interface. Analyze it over time for peaks, overlay it on a map. Very cool stuff.\nAnd important to me: you can export your data in one of three common formats.\n\nI use it to map the mountain bike trails in my neighbourhood and find its accuracy is excellent, even at higher speeds, as long as it has a strong enough signal from the cell towers (the satellite signals in the trees tend to fall off pretty quickly). When I get to the fringe service areas its accuracy drops off. But that would be the case for any GPS app.\n\nA: I have used Cyclemeter (equivalent to Runmeter) a lot when riding, and have played with a few other GPS loggers. The problem with all these apps is not that they are inaccurate themselves; it is that they are reliant on the underlying iOS Location Services, which is what reports your current position to all those apps. Sometimes the GPS system on your phone just freaks out for a few seconds (or more) and you wind up with some very unrealistic data. I know that the Abvio apps will report how much time of your workout is spent with an unreliable signal (Location Services reports the radius of confidence along with your current location to the apps—sometimes that radius is measured in kilometers). I know that dealing with dodgy data consumes a lot of development resources for the companies producing these workout-loggers. In short, I'd say \"don't blame the apps.\"\nThere are a number of apps, including Runkeeper and Kinetic, that can interface with ANT+ devices through a gadget called a Fisica dongle. This would let you monitor heart rate and footfalls, which (I think) could be used by these apps as a reality check on your GPS track.\n\nA: I'm not a jogger, but I've made fairly good experience with RunKeeper for cycling. It's not extremely accurate either, but it was always sufficient for me. The free Light version will be fine for almost all uses.\n\nA: If you want to check if it fits your needs, I use Motion X GPS Lite (which, like most of the Lite apps, it's free). \nMain limit of the Lite version is being able to save only 1 track at time. Which is enough for me. However, the PRO version is available on iTunes Store.\n", "Q: Complete Deletion of an App on iPad I have downloaded a game on my iPad (hopefully free), played for a while. Then, after several days, the app crashed. The current situation is that this app starts, but during initial loading, it crashes. I've deleted the app and then re-downloaded it from the App Store, believing that the corrupted file had been deleted too. But the problem stays the same: crash at startup.\nSo my question is: when I delete an app, does it leave some files on the system? And if it is the case, is it possible to get totally rid of an app?\n\nA: Due to the way iOS sandboxes apps, when you delete an app, it along with its data are gone. The only remains are in the App Store purchase history. The iOS security means you can't easily undelete these files via a jailbreak - so if you want to ensure the data gets securely erased, you should erase all contents and settings which will either destroy the key used to encrypt.\nDon't forget to delete the app from iTunes on any computers you have and then make a backup of your iPad with the app deleted. That gets rid of two other potential copies of the app.\nThe game is probably just buggy. You can tell the developer and make sure to mention what iDevice you have, its iOS version, and specifically what the bug is.\n\nA: The problem might not be with the app or it's data, but something else on your iPad.  Try rebooting (slide to power off) your iPad, and then reinstalling the app.\n", "Q: What affects the order of applications in Lauchpad? When opening Launchpad I've noticed that every page has different amount of applications laid out. Also, they doesn't seem to be ordered by any criteria (name, usage frequency or size). What are the sorting parameters for applications in Launchpad?\n\nA: On a clean install, the core Mac OS X apps are originally ordered alphabetically. Newly installed apps will be appended at the back on an empty spot starting with page 2 (they will never be appended on page 1, even if there is room available, but you can ofcourse drag them there).\nApps can then be arranged manually, and they should remain in the order you sort them. However, I have noticed quite some buggy behaviors, mainly apps changing position after a reboot, and MAS updates pushing apps of the page.\nI hope these will get ironed out in a coming update.\n\nA: I'm not sure there is a fixed order.  When I first started LP, they were in alphabetical order.  I moved some around, combined some together, moved some to page 2 and vice versa.  That new order has stuck over many shutdown and startups, even through the SU.\nWhen I add a new app, it shows up on page 2.  I move it to page 1 and it stays there.  It can be tricky to get them exactly where you want, as each time you move one, another moves as well.  It's kind of like trying to solve 2 Rubik's Cubes at once.\nHope this helps, even though it is just my experience and not a hard fast rule.\n", "Q: Delete a purchased file from ITunes Download Queue without downloading file This is related to an earlier question, but the advice there doesn't work for me. My disk space is full. Whenever I open iTunes, it tries to download some purchases that I don't want anymore (old Lost episodes) that I haven't wanted for years. All that I want to do is cancel these downloads. Deleting them in itunes doesn't work. The recommended advice on an earlier question is to finish downloading them, then delete them, but I can't do this for diskspace reasons (there are about seventeen episodes, so it's not practical for me to sit there and slowly deleted enough diskjunk to download an episode at a time, then delete the episode - and even if it were, it seems rude to hog this much bandwidth.) Any other solution?\n\nA: In iTunes Downloads folder (open Terminal, type: open ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes\\ Media/Downloads/), delete list.plist file to remove the queued downloads.\nThen restart iTunes.\nYou may also want to delete other files in there too since they are certainly not needed.\n(From my answer, https://discussions.apple.com/message/24479839#24479839)\n\nA: I had a download (a Lost episode in fact) that wouldn't stop downloading.  Even though it was already in my library, it would download every time I checked for purchases and then error out at the end of the download.\nI don't remember everything I tried, but a tried a LOT of things to get it to stop.  The only thing that eventually worked for me was contacting iTunes Support: http://www.apple.com/support/itunes/contact/\nThey had the item removed from my queue within a couple hours.  It will probably expedite things if you give them the exact episode names and numbers as they appear in the iTunes Store.\n\nA: Remove Them from Store=>Purchased Playlist\niTunes 10.7.0.21 on my Windows 7 machine seems to automatically download only those items in  the Store=>Purchased \"playlist\".  In my case, deleting a movie from Store=>Purchased stopped it from being added to the download queue automatically.\nTo download purchased items that have been removed from Store=>Purchased, go to Store=>Purchased=>Download Previous Purchases and find the item there.\n", "Q: Spotlight reports \"Indexing and searching disabled\" in Lion Lion keeps \"losing track\" of Spotlight information. Directories and Applications disappear, full text searches stop working, etc. I seem to need to re-index it once a week or so. \nHowever, now it appears to not work at all.\nRunning \nsudo mdutil -i on /\n\nfrom the Terminal I get a message\n\"Indexing and searching disabled.\"\n\nI have tried trashing preference files, deleting the whole V100 folder, repairing permssions, etc but Spotlight still thinks indexing is turned off on my entire Volume (Yes have added/deleted whole disk from Spotlight's privacy preferences\").\nIn the console I have quite a few errors that look like this\nmds: (Error) Server: Disabled store registered for scope \"/Applications\"\n\nHowever, I do not know how to tell it to re-enable that scope as mdutil gives an error when I try to turn on indexing and gives an error when I try to delete the index \nEDIT: I reinstalled Lion.

Then steps 4 and 5 worked as expected.\n\n\n*\n\n*turn indexing off\n\n*delete Spotlight folder\n\n*delete metadata file\n\n*turn indexing on\n\n*rebuild\n\n\nA: I had the exact same problem, with all solutions above failing identically. Then I reexamined the directory listing for / and found a hidden file .metadata_never_index in the root directory. I removed this file and was able to turn spotlight on again with \nmdutil -i on /.\nmds is now reindexing the hard disk, all looks good for now.\n\nA: After all of the initial troubleshooting steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*Rebuild the index \n\n*Attempt in another user account\n\n*Dump prefs/cache and start over\n\n\nI found the issue lied in what was enabled/disabled. In terminal, I ran \"mdutil -sa\" and got:\n/:\n    Indexing enabled. \n/Groups:\n    Indexing disabled. \n/Shared Items/Public:\n    Indexing disabled.\n/Users:\n    Indexing disabled. \n/Users/sarah/Documents:\n    Indexing enabled. \n\nI noticed \"/Users: Indexing disabled.\" That's the problem there. The fix: \"sudo mdutil -i on /Users\". After that, it re-indexed /Users, which took significantly longer than it had before, and before it was finished, it was searching my Mail!\n\nA: This can also be caused by getting stuck in safe mode.  To fix that, you need to reset the  NVRAM by holding down the Command ⌘, Option ⌥, P, and R keys immediately after rebooting (before the gray screen appears).\n\nA: sudo mdutil -i off /\nsudo rm -rf /.Spotlight*\nsudo mdutil -i on /\nsudo mdutil -E /\n\n1 - turn indexing off\n2 - delete Spotlight folder\n3 - turn indexing on\n4 - rebuild\nDoes this help?\nAlso it seems you could use these commands:\nsudo mdutil -a -i off\nsudo mdutil -a -i on\n\n\nA: The other solutions didn't work for me, however the following was the culprit in my case.\nMake sure your root/main hard drive isn't in the \"privacy\" settings for spotlight. For some reason I had the whole hard drive under the \"Prevent spotlight from indexing the following locations\" list.\nYou can access this section from System Preferences -> Spotlight -> Privacy\n\nA: I noticed this issue after my iMac installed the software update 10.7.4 to my machine. Most of the suggested command-lines would produce 'Indexing and searching disabled'. sudo mdutil -pEsav gave me 'datastore publishing not implemented.'\nBelow is the solution that worked:\n\n\n*\n\n*edit /etc/hostconfig\n\n*add the line  SPOTLIGHT=-YES- at the bottom (this line was missing)\n\n*reboot\n\n\n(after reboot make some soup while your machine prepares the index)\n\nA: Only the combination of -E and -i on worked for me:\nsudo mdutil -E -i on /Volumes/blah\n\n\nA: This worked for me: Re-enable Spotlight Indexing\n\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist\n\n\n\nA: I've tried for days about every solution out there for Big Sur, and the combination of these steps seemed to solve it for me.

It seems like I cannot execute AppleScripts on my Mac.\nI am running OS X 10.7.1 and when I try to compile an AppleScript, even a script as simple as display dialog \"Hello World!\", I get a syntax error.\nIn the preferences for the AppleScript editor there nothing in the Default Language drop down menu on the General preferences page.\nDoes anybody know what might be wrong? Is it possible to reinstall just AppleScript?\n\nA: So actually the problem has been solved by restarting my Mac with \"resume\" feature turned off.\n", "Q: out of diskspace because of sparsebundle My disk is out of space all of a sudden and I found out that a directory in /Users/.harith/harith.sparsebundle is using 178 gigs of space. What is this directory? How/Why is my mac using it. Is it safe if I remove the directory?\n\nA: /Users/.harith/harith.sparsebundle is the encrypted contents of your home directory. When you are logged in (as user harith), then the unecrypted contents of that same directory are visible under /Users/harith, that is, your home directory.\nSo what you're seeing is, your hard disk is full. And your home directory is taking up 178 GiB of space.\nIT IS NOT SAFE TO DELETE /Users/.harith/harith.sparsebundle!!!!! This is your home directory's files, and deleting this will delete or corrupt your home directory!!!\nWhat you will want to do is look for large files within your home directory, and move those to an external drive. As @lemonginger mentioned, movies and music are good places to look, but not so they're not being decrypted as he said, that's irrelevant. And don't just move them anywhere, you need to move them to a different hard drive otherwise you won't solve the problem.\nIf you don't have a second hard drive, consider moving files to a cloud-based storage system, such as Apple's iCloud service or Amazon's Cloud Drive. This can be either a permanent solution, or a temporary storage space until you can expand your local disk storage. Amazon may be a good choice because they offer 5 GB at no cost, and I believe you can get up to 20GB free if you purchase any MP3 from them.\nIn order to reduce the size of your home directory's encrypted sparsebundle, you need to log out. After you log out, if you have deleted files from within your FileVault home directory, you will see a dialog appear with a progress indicator which states \"Reclaiming unused space in  home directory\". What this is actually doing is removing the parts of /Users/.harith/harith.sparsebundle which are no longer in use (because you have deleted files).\nA side note: /Users/.harith/harith.sparsebundle is only when you are logged in. When you log out, /Users/.harith/harith.sparsebundle is moved to /Users/harith/harith.sparsebundle, and it's moved back when you next log in.\n\nA: It sounds like you are running File Vault and that is your Home directory. A useful tip if you are using older versions of File Vault is to store a lot of your music and movies outside of your home folder, so that they aren't being encrypted and decrypted all the time. Or upgrade to lion, which handles encryption completely differently (and much better IMHO)\n", "Q: How to Properly Uninstall Brother Twain Drivers in OS X 10.6 I recently had a situation where I wanted to uninstall a Brother TWAIN driver and rollback to an earlier version on my MBP (OS X 10.6.8). I found instructions on the Brother web site and followed them to the letter. However, I was unable to reinstall the older version (freshly downloaded from the Brother web site) - the installer provided a message indicating that a newer driver was currently installed on my system.\nI ended up manually reinstalling the older driver by going into the DMG and extracting the files.\nQuestions\n\n\n*\n\n*Are there any other locations that I should have looked to remove files from the newer Brother TWAIN install?\n\n*Are the Brother uninstall instructions complete?\n\n\nA: To answer both questions at once, it seems that the Brother instructions only cover system level files.  This will not remove any files that you as a user created or installed.  I would go through the instructions again, then repeat the instructions, but for every location where it says \"Macintosh HD > Library > x\", I would also check at \"Macintosh HD >  Users > YourUsername > Library > x\". \nIt is also possible, depending on what version of OS (I see that you are rolling back to 10.6.8 - does that mean you were on 10.7?) that they are system installed.  I wouldn't recommend removing anything from your system folder, but it may be finding the drivers under \"Macintosh HD > System > Library\".\n", "Q: Startup items no longer load in Lion When I first upgraded to Lion, my startup items loaded as normal. Now however, no startup items load (even though they all appear in the startup items preference pane as normal). I thought maybe it had something to do with Lion's behavior of saving the system state on restart, but that's not it.\nAnyway to debug the startup process and see if it is getting stuck somewhere or aborting somewhere?\n\nA: Looking in the console log is the first place to look for launchd errors to debug the process. \nI use Lingon to look into the actual launchd configuration files - it automates finding the files and editing the plist files. \nYou can look in your (now hidden) ~/Library/LaunchAgents  directory to make sure the items are enabled. \nLastly ( or perhaps firstly ) try deleting all the items from the account pane, reboot and add them back to see if that helps. \n\nA: Something changed between the point where it worked and then did not work.  Unless you can remember what that was and undo that change, you have to resort to some other method of recovery.\nThere is a software glitch somewhere.  It could be a corrupt preference (.plist).  Try booting in Safe mode.  That does a Repair Disk during the startup process, so it takes longer than usual.  Safe boot will then present a login screen when completed.  Select Restart to reboot normally, which gets all of the functions back that Safe boot disables.  See if that cures your problem.\nAnother possible cure is to reset PRAM (see your Help menu in Finder).  You have to be very quick to get this to work.  It resets a lot of things, including software switches.  I have used it successfully when a Safe boot did not fix a problem.\n\nA: The actual problem on this one was that my keyboard had shorted out and it thought the \"shift\" key was stuck down. Because of this, it was bypassing any user-defined startup items on startup. Now that I got my keyboard replaced, the startup items show up again. So a bit of an odd answer to this one, but good suggestions in the other answers as well for someone that might be experiencing this. \nThanks for Lingon suggestion, nice program!\n", "Q: Legality of iTunes sharing Are there any legal issues with iTunes sharing? I responded to this question on Super User, and if you look at the comments, the point was brought up that iTunes sharing may or may not be legal.\n\nA: At least in the US agreement, Apple only authorizes people to use iTunes content for \"personal, noncommercial use.\" Nothing I find in the agreement licenses the user to share their content with others at the workplace. So yes, there are potential legal issues.\n\nA: The iTunes Store Term and Conditions are available in almost any country and can be found here. The Terms and Conditions, as outlined by Apple, should address your broad question.\nAs Daniel has raised the issue of \"sharing in the workplace\", it is a point of contention that one can argue what \"sharing for personal, noncommercial use\" entails. Does that cover other parties that listen to the music? Do you have to be in the room (or within earshot) with them to have the sharing fall under \"personal\" use?\nI'm inclined to think that sharing your library at work while you are in the office would not be something that would see you land in court. I can't see a judge in their right mind agreeing to anything more than a C&D, if that, under such circumstances.\nYou may consider reaching out to the Electronic Foundation Frontier for a more fleshed out answer.\n", "Q: Send specific traffic through VPN based on the domain I'd like to access Hulu and similar sites from outside the US, so I'm using blackVPN via PPTP. Works great, no major problems.\nIs there any way to use the (consisting) VPN connection only for a small list of domains like *.hulu.com or *.youtube.com, while not having the other traffic sent through the VPN?\nThanks in advance!\n— Ben\n\nA: You're looking for static routes and the 'route' command.  'man route' from the shell for full info, but something like route -nv add -net 66.22.138 -interface tun0 (or whatever your VPN interface is) should route traffic bound for hulu.com over the VPN.\nYou'll probably want to establish a default gateway so that you are assured of routing your traffic correctly.\nroute add default 192.168.1.1 would add a static route for your router.  Replace 192.168.1.1 with the actual IP address.\nNote that these settings will not survive a reboot.  If they work for you, you'll want to put them in a launch agent file.\n", "Q: iCal and Mac Office 2011 I have a MacBook Pro user who uses Mac Office 2011 and he has been getting iCal invites from another user. When he gets them, he can't seem to respond to them (accept or decline).. the generated response seems to just sit in his outbox and never get sent.\nAnyone seen this before?\n\nA: Unfortunately, it is my experience that iCal and Outlook STILL do not play very nice together, although inviting from Outlook and accepting in Mail/iCal still seems to work much better than going the reverse direction.\nThere are some third party programs that tweak how ical sends invitations to make them more compatible\nhttp://www.zamain.com/\nBut, yes this has been a known issue for years as any quick search for \"ical outlook\" will let you know! I thought this was supposed to be fixed once and for all with Office 2011, but I guess it has not been.\n", "Q: OSX update cache: does it accumulate over time? I bought my MBP 2.5 years ago, it came with a 240 GB drive. I don't remember how much free space it hat to start with, but let's just say 200 GB.\nI mostly use it for personal use (different machine at work). I don't have movies/music stored on it (all on external drive) and have some applications installed (total app folder size: 20 GB). My ~ dir is also approx 20 GB.\nMy drive now says 140 GB free. I can't explain the 20 GB difference. I think apple isn't removing downloaded updates after installing. Where should I look?\nAnother idea was mail cache folder. Where is this folder?\n\nA: I suggest you download a utility that shows the size and arrangement of your files. Personally, I use DaisyDisk. It is shareware, so for your purposes, it would suffice to trial the software.\nMail attachments are stored in ~/Library/Mail Downloads/\nIt is unlikely that OS X is keeping packages after installation through Software Update. You should first look to your cache ~/Library/Caches/ and perhaps your sleepimage, which is located under /var/vm/sleepimage (note that the sleepimage is recreated every time the system goes to sleep. Read more about disabling it here if you are concerned with HD space).\nDaisyDisk (or equivalent) will do a much better job at identifying where the \"growth\" has occured on your filesystem so that you may excise it than we ever could. I suggest you give it a try.\n\n\nA: Grand Perspective gives you a visual overview of what is taking space on your disk.\nTry it:  it's free and open-source.\n\n", "Q: Osascript error I was messing around with some external libraries, and for some reason when I enter any Osascript command, I now get this error (before it did work):  \n2011-09-07 19:13:43.306 osascript[1083:707] Error loading /Library/ScriptingAdditions/Adobe Unit Types.osax/Contents/MacOS/Adobe Unit Types:  dlopen(/Library/ScriptingAdditions/Adobe Unit Types.osax/Contents/MacOS/Adobe Unit Types, 262): no suitable image found.  Did find:\n    /Library/ScriptingAdditions/Adobe Unit Types.osax/Contents/MacOS/Adobe Unit Types: no matching architecture in universal wrapper\nosascript: OpenScripting.framework - scripting addition \"/Library/ScriptingAdditions/Adobe Unit Types.osax\" declares no loadable handlers.\n4:5: syntax error: Expected “given”, “in”, “of”, expression, “with”, “without”, other parameter name, etc. but found unknown token. (-2741)\n\nHelp please?\n\nA: The dlopen error means it can't load the Adobe Unit Types scripting addition, because it only has a 32-bit binary, but the process loading it is 64-bit. This may or may not be a problem for your script, depending on whether your script uses the handlers provided by the addition.\nNormally, all available additions are loaded at once, whether you're using them or not, so we can't tell whether this is an issue without seeing your script.\nThe syntax error may or may not be related to the inability to load the addition. Even if you resolve the addition-loading issue, the syntax error may remain. Have you tried compiling the script in AppleScript Editor to see where the syntax error occurs and to verify whether it's a valid script?\nTo isolate the problem you can try any of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall the scripting addition. The path to its location is in the error message. Just move it to another location, like the Desktop.\n\n*Run osascript in 32-bit mode. To do so, invoke it via the arch command, which lets you select which architecture a program uses: arch -i386 osascript …. Similarly, you can run AppleScript Editor in 32-bit mode using Finder's Info window—select the application in Finder, open an Info window and select \"Open in 32-bit mode\". \n\n\nUPDATE: If running in 32-bit mode fixes the problem, then as joelsef suggested the solution is to upgrade the Adobe Unit Types scripting addition. The latest version has a 64-bit executable.\n\nA: You could try updating Adobe Unit Types.osax file to the 64-bit version, if it's not already updated to version 2.1.0. You can find the download link at this Adobe KB article.\nThe KB article talks about Photoshop specifically, but using the updated Adobe Unit Types resolved some obscure error I was getting that had nothing to do with scripting Photoshop.\n", "Q: Lion restoring windows throws DO NOT HAVE permission When I restart my computer it tries to restore my open Preview PDFs. Clearly I opened them (and I've tried every which way to do that so the whole new sandbox methods will retain permission), and yet I keep getting it. \nI nuked the Saved State Folder (which oddly is the only app, Apple or 3rd, with a symlink to within its Container…) and it went away for a bit. But I just got it again. Oddly though it was only for half the open files. (five PDF whitepapers open in one window, sitting in the same folder, three opened, 2 gave Permission Errors) \nAny ideas? It keeps restoring because every time I close the laptop it goes into deep sleep immediately. I have no idea if this is a fluke on my machine or a Lion thing. Upon wake up it just stalls and then does an entire reboot — thus trying to restore everything that was open from before. \nDespite that having its own degree of obnoxiousness at times, it's somehow worse when it does it but fails. And it makes no sense to me that it'd only fail on some files and not others, especially when they're sitting in the same folder. The sandbox permission shouldn't relate to the Saved State restore, anyway. \n\nA: To solve the permission errors, just boot from your recovery cd(insert cd and reboot while holding alt/option) and click in the menubar on 'Utilities' and select 'Disk Utility'. When you are there, you can choose 'repair disk permissions' (get ready for about 2 hours of not being able to use your computer).\nIn preview, close each document and then quit the app, that should do the trick.\n", "Q: How do I boot my MacBook Air running Lion in safe mode? I follow the instructions in http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1455 to boot in Safe Mode, but it appears something different happens with Lion.  After holding the shift key when hearing the startup tone, the icons for the two accounts I have configured come up as usual.  If I hold the shift key after logging in, the screen stays grey and a status bar appears with a \"sunburst\" waiting animation.  (I don't know what the canonical name for that is.)  After the status bar fills, the waiting animation continues and then my MBA reboots.\nHow do I boot my MacBook Air (running Mac OS X 10.7.1) in Safe Mode?\n\nA: In my 2011 MacBook Air running Lion, when I select Restart... from the  menu, if I then hold the shift key through the restart process, the boot process is distinctly different than a normal reboot. There is a progress bar across the bottom of the screen, and then I am deposited at the login window, despite normally automatically logging in. I suspect that a Safe Boot has indeed been performed. The difference between this an Safe Boot in previous versions is that no \"Safe Mode\" text appears on the login screen for me.\n", "Q: What's the canonical name for the \"sunburst\" waiting animation? Is there an accepted name for the spinning animation that's displayed when one needs to wait for an indefinite amount of time?  It looks like this:\n\n\nA: The technical term for it is a Throbber.\n\nA: The canonical name is the \"asynchronous progress indicator\" but in most user documentation it is described as \"a progress indicator (that looks like a spinning gear)\". The Apple Publications Style Guide (non-Apple source!) is a nice reference for learning what Apple considers the correct terms for writing about these details correctly.\nThe four specific types of generic progress indicators that Apple provides to developers are:\n\n\n*\n\n*asynchronous progress indicator (spinning gear)\n\n*determinate progress bar (moving bar)\n\n*indeterminate progress bar (spinning striped cylinder)\n\n*spinning wait cursor (colored pinwheel)\n\n\n\nI'm writing a short postscript since many confuse the spinning gear with the colored pinwheel:\nThe colored pinwheel is colloquially known as the spinning pizza of death or SPOD cursor due to user frustration when it appears to signal a hung process. It is the worst indicator for the user to see since it means the programmer either didn't or couldn't keep the main program responsive. We as users have no clue what part of the program is waiting for something to progress, only that it's stuck. \n\nA: It is called the \"Asynchronous Progress Indicator\". You can read more about it, and other elements of Mac OS X, in their OS X HIG Guidelines.\n", "Q: Does reinstalling Lion from Recovery partition delete data? I've decided my install of Lion is hopelessly botched. Spotlight doesn't work, kernel panics, etc etc etc. Want to reinstall. If I reinstall Lion from the recovery USB key I have, it will retain all my data correct? ie; not format the drive and reinstall.\n\nA: No, Lion does not perform a format of the drive, it simply replaces the contents of your system with a default installation.\nOnce you install Lion again, all your files, your user information, account settings, installed programs, etc. will still be there.\nMoreover, it does not leave a copy of your old system, like Snow Leopard before it.\n", "Q: How can I use tmutil to figure out which files just got deleted? I'm on Lion and until ten minutes ago I didn't know that the nifty new tmutil existed. But now I'm a little uncertain with all its options and sub-commands which to use to try and figure out what went wrong and how to fix it.\nA program ran amuck and started deleting files from ~. It made only a little progress before I stopped it, but doubtless I lost some files. I just can't tell out of a drive with hundreds of thousands of files, which ones went away.

Can I transfer my data from from a NTFS formatted disk on my PC to a Mac?\n\nA: Yes, files can be transferred from a NTFS drive to a Mac.  Apple provides documentation on the process. This is a relatively straightforward process.\nThe bigger challenge is not reading files from a different disk operating system, but rather proprietary formats used by particular programs. Common formats like jpeg, html, etc. will pose no problem, and programs like Microsoft Office or Adobe Photoshop are available on both platforms. Files from Microsoft Publisher, however, or other more obscure Windows programs can be ported to the Mac, but you may find yourself without a program on the Mac that can read or edit those particular files.\n\nA: You will need to use the migration assistant check out support.apple.com/kb/HT4796 don't start the computer until you read the article especialy the subsection \"Click here if the Mac is starting up for the first time and Mac OS X Setup Assistant appears\"\nIt seems that the transfer can be made over the network so no NTFS problems ;)\n", "Q: How to make Safari remember zoom level per site? Safari's default font size is not large enough for my eyes so I have to press ⌘++ for a while on every website I visit. I could've used CSS to set the default zoom level in Safari but I want different zoom levels for Twitter, Facebook, StackOverflow, etc.\nIs there an extension or other way available to make Safari remember per-site zoom level settings?\n\nA: Yes,\nThere is an extension for this called ZoomBySite. Here is a description of the software from it's website:\n\nZoomBySite is a Safari Extension that will automatically zoom each\n  site to the zoom level of your last visit to the site. A site is\n  defined by a unique domain name (so www.apple.com is considered\n  different from store.apple.com and each could have its own unique zoom\n  level).\nIt does this by intercepting the Zoom In and Zoom Out keyboard\n  shortcuts [...].

There are two reason I took the wifi only model:\n\n\n*\n\n*I am not planning on taking the iPad everywhere I go. That's what the iPhone is for.\n\n*I have an unlimited data plan with free tethering on the iPhone. If I ever need Internet on the go, I just make a personal hotspot and use the iPhone's connection on the iPad.\n\n\nHowever, in order to join that hotspot, I need to first take the iPhone, go to settings and then I can join the hotspot with my iPad. I guess it's a nice security compromise, however it is still a real pain if I use the iPad 2-3 times per hour over the day at work and have to go to the iPhone's settings every time. This also happens if my GF's iPhone 3G wants to connect to my hotspot (she has no data plan).\nIs there a way to allow certain devices to join the hotspot at a moment's notice, without taking out the iPhone itself?\n\nA: If you connect to the iPhone not via wifi but via bluetooth, there is no need to do anything on the iPhone, just establish the connection using the iPad's bluetooth settings. Of course, bluetooth on the iPhone must then remain always switched on. I do this all the time, the iphons remains in the pocket ... \n\nA: It’s a power saving feature not a security issue.  People forget to turn the hotspot off and that drains the battery.  It appears apple has decided that with no settable waiting period the hotspot should shut down if there is no traffic which is what happens when the iPad goes to sleep.\n\nA: What happens to me is that I pick up the iPad after some inactivity, and it is disconnected, and fails to connect automatically.  However, instead of going to the iPhone's settings, I go to the iPad's WiFi settings and tap the hotspot's SSID.  Once in a while, just opening settings triggers it connecting, but usually, I have to actually tap on it.\n\nA: no there isnt but yes it is a good security compromise.\n", "Q: How to determine quickly what is the currently running OS volume? Is there a quick way to find the volume on which is located the current running OS ? I've noticed that the sort order of the volumes list can be changed manually, so the current system volume is not always on the top of the list. \nPS : And, in my case, of course, there are several volumes with a System Folder. \n\nA: If in terminal, one could type open / which opens a Finder window for the root (similar to what @andersmoldin described).\nYou could also drag the volume's icon to the Finder's sidebar for quick access later on.\nOr you could drag it to the Dock.\n\nA: How about - in the Finder - hit Cmd + shift + G and then type /, does that work for you?\n\nA: The terminal command \"system_profiler SPSoftwareDataType\" should show the name of the volume you booted from. If you have multiple system folders on a volume, then \"bless -info\" should show you the current blessed system folder.\n\nA: The trick I use is to right-click on a drive.

An Applescript saved as an App might do the trick as well.  I know very little about either, but someone here might help.\nAn Applescript would likely contain something like the following:\nopen Terminal.app\nRun shell script \"xxx\"\nThat would give you the info in an open Terminal window.  You could map that to an F key or put it in the Dock, giving you 1 step to get the info you want.\nI don't know enough about any of these to give advice beyond what I have.\nThis might help:\nhttp://hintsforums.macworld.com/showthread.php?t=111057\nSince you didn't say you wanted to get this info on a \"random\" Mac, I did not consider that.\nOpen Disk Utility and cycling thru the volumes to find the one that will not allow you to \"Repair Disk\".

To search inside applications, you just need to check \"Package Contents\" in the sidebar.\nFor a quicker search, you can limit the search to just the Applications folder by using the menu under the search field (on the far right).\nCommand Line - Find\nIn Terminal, you can use the find command:\nfind /Applications/foo.app -type f -name \"bar\"\n\nReplace foo.app with the name of your app, and replace \"bar\" with the name of the file you want to search for. \nIf you want to search all apps in /Applications, leave out the /foo.app part of the command.\nIf you want to include folders, remove -type f, if you want to search only for folders, change -type f to -type d. You can also use the * wildcard in your filename to get partially matching results.\n\nA: I wouldn't think so, but I'll be happy to hear otherwise. It's quite easy from the command line, though:\nfind /Applications/<YOUR APP>.app -type f | xargs strings | grep <YOUR SEARCH TERM>\n\nYou can also search through the whole Applications folder with\nfind /Applications -type f | xargs strings | grep <YOUR SEARCH TERM>\n\nThis will take quite a while, as it actually searches through the files instead of using a cached index, like Spotlight does.\n\nA: Find Any File\nis a third-party utility that can do this. It costs US $4.00 and can be downloaded from the developer or purchased in the Mac App Store. It is a good alternative to using the command-line tools that come with Lion.

I came across a thread about installing an SSD drive in MacBook Pro.\nSomeone in the comments also recommended to disable the swap file but didn't say why:\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist\nsudo rm /private/var/vm/swapfile*\n\nI wonder why one would want to disable the swap file in Mac OS X.\nDoes it increase performance? Stability?\nAny downsides?\nFinally, does it make any sense to disable swap file when not using SSD?\n\nA: I'll be the naysayer here: I disabled swap on my late 2008 unibody macbook pro and it improved performance noticably: Less waiting, faster switching between applications.\nMind you, I keep an eye on my free memory and I have 6GB installed. The few times that I hit the memory limit, the system crashed :-D\nOn my new MacBook Air I wouldn't dream of disabling swap, it's already fast with it enabled and it only has 4GB to begin with.\nAnother good reason people disable swap on an SSD is because they get tiny SSDs and need all the space they can get. In any case, don't do it.\n\nA: My experience is similar to w00t's.  I have disabled the swap file on SL and Lion because the performance increase works for me.  Wired usage does get out of control after a week or so but a simple reboot fixes that.  I do not have a SSD but a slow 5400rpm disk.  SSD lifespans aren't actually as bad as people try to make them out to be though.  If you're doing it simply because you're afraid of wearing out your SSD please see:  http://www.anandtech.com/show/4159/ocz-vertex-3-pro-preview-the-first-sf2500-ssd/2  and http://communities.intel.com/thread/21717?tstart=0 Intel rates their drives for over 20GB a day, every day, for up to 5 years on a 80gb drive.  Bigger sized drives will last even longer.  The average user doesn't even use 10GB/day. \nI make sure to monitor my 4GB memory usage with iStat Menus and use an Automator script with the \"purge\" bash command (requires Xcode to be installed) to clear out inactive memory and open up more free memory frequently.  The few times I have had apps with memory leaks use up all the RAM, I did have to do a hard reset.  The rare occasions of that happening and the speed up in general makes it worthwhile to keep the swap file disabled for me.  I realize that I can't have as many apps open at once because of this as stated by others but I'm able to work with that.\n\nA: Just throwing in my 2 cents for those who wish to disable swap BECAUSE of small SSDs: the sleepimage uses far more disk space. \nAnd, for those concerned about the limited life of the SSD (particularly those with MBA's and hard-wired SSD chips that CANNOT be replaced), if your computer sleeps many times per day, the rewriting of the sleepimage may be a concern. My laptop sleeps a half dozen times/day easily. That writes 48GB of data to my SSD daily.\nThe solution in each case is to disable hibernation, and then delete the sleepimage file that is as large as your installed RAM (8GB in my case). \nThe downside risk: if your battery dies while your laptop is sleeping, your current state will be lost. This will be equivalent to a forced hard restart. No physical harm to the laptop, just a loss of productivity. If you disable hibernation, then run your battery low and can't charge, just have the code handy to enable hibernation!\nTo disable hibernation, in the Terminal, the command is as follows:\n sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0\n\nTo enable hibernation, the command is as follows:\n sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 3\n\nTo delete the last sleepimage to free up SSD/HDD space (only makes sense if you turn off hibernation, else a new one will take up that space next time your computure sleeps):\n sudo rm -rf /var/vm/sleepimage\n\nSource: man pmset\n\nA: \nwonder why one would want to disable the swap file in Mac OS X.\n  Does it increase performance? Stability?\n  Any downsides?\n\nI suppose people would do it for an SSD drive because those drives don't have the same lifetime as standard magnetic spinning-disk drives. There are a more limited number of write cycles, so presumably using them with a swap file would use up these cycles more quickly.\n\nFinally, does it make any sense to disable swap file when not using SSD?\n\nIf you have a lot of RAM, this would possibly speed up performance, but it's not a good idea in general. If you do run up against the memory ceiling, things are going to get flaky.\nAlso, wired memory isn't released when it becomes invalid, it is only released when a page out event is triggered, which won't happen if Virtual Memory is disabled. So it won't take long for all your memory to be gobbled up even if it is no longer used.\n\nA: Disabling swap does increase performance. For example I regularly use Aperture and when swap grows performance worsens and when it goes beyond 1Gb I have to restart OS to clean it and restore performance. Note: machine has 6GB of RAM and NOT all of it occupied, about 3GB is free, but 1G is swap significantly degrades performance.\n\nA: I've been disabling swap on machines for many years, both on OS X and other UNIX variants.\nI use a tool to alert me when memory is running low, and never worry about my system crashing.\nMy iMac has 12GB, and with swap disabled I almost always have 4GB free, even with multiple development tools, apps, browsers etc. open\n\nA: The reason they disabled the swap file is likely paranoia about SSDs having a maximum number of writes per block. Swap files can be written to frequently, possibly causing disk fragmentation (as well as file system fragmentation) and, eventually, possibly causing the disk to fail sooner.\nThat said, this is definitely a case of premature optimization. It is almost always a HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE idea to disable your swap file. The swap file is there for when your running programs consume more memory than you have physically installed. If you disable it, you may not be able to run as many programs at the same time (and the limit is far lower than you'd expect) or you may have issues (like freezing and having to hard-reboot the machine) when you run out of memory.\nThe latter I've experienced (with the swap file enabled) when running out of disk space. I had a 120 gig drive with ~3 gigs free. While playing Civilization IV (a large, full-screen game), the system ran out of hard drive space (~50 megs free) and presented the \"kill apps now\" window. This was hiding behind the full-screen game, so the system just locked up. If I hadn't been able to ssh in from another Mac to kill several apps remotely, I'd have had to hold down the power button. \n\nA: The primary reason to disable the swapfile isn't speed - it's disk space.\nIf one is a user who routinely runs within 5 GB of a full drive, disabling swap will stop the constant nagging of running out of space; I routinely wind up with a 4+ GB swapfile from routine browsing.\nThe speed improvement is astounding on older machines; it's not that impressive on SSD equipped modern machines. (Under OSX 10.0 on an iMac, using virtual memory halved the speed of many operations, including copying files between drives).\n\nA: You have two great answers that explain why this is a bad idea in almost all cases where the system can write to a storage device. \nThe reason you can disable swap is so the system can run on read only media such as a CD, DVD, locked network image using NetBoot or a read only USB fob like the new Lion installer or recovery fob that ships with some macs that lack optical drives. \nHaving virtual memory means that the system can run substantially faster and use less RAM when many programs use the same common library code. Each program thinks it has a private copy of all the code it needs, but when virtual memory exists, the system has a nice way to map the same physical RAM to different programs. \nDisabling swap prevents the mac from using a tiny portion of your drive as a cache for some memory that has been calculated but the program wasn't smart enough to write those results itself to a proper cache. \nIf you have a backup and time to experiment, why not turn it off and see how your experience changes. \nI would keep my swap on even if I knew for certain I had to pay for a new drive annually. The speed up that swap gives me is HUGE. This is not always so, and at times when the system is thrashing or paging - you can have the opposite. Many people choose to run without swap so that they get a memory allocation error rather than let their mac start paging since that can slow down a machine when things aren't running smoothly.\nYour case with a SSD could be different, so do let us know if you try it.\n\nA: The repeating pattern here is this:\nThose who HAVE disabled swap file experienced improved performance (with sufficient physical RAM)\nThose who have NOT disabled swap space are certain that it will not work, and something terrible will happen, and are ardently advising that you not do it.\nThis is due simply to two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Outdated ideas about the scarcity and high cost of physical RAM which are no longer valid\n\n*A really poor swapping mechanism in MacOS causing use of swap files when there is sufficient physical RAM.\n\n\nA: Just a personal experience.\nMemory Amount    |\n 4 GB            | Don't disable it, Mountain Lion itself boots with about 1 GB.\n 8 GB            | Do if you don't run apps that requires more than 1 GB of memory, in short, virtualization software, Photoshop, and stuff.\n16 GB or more    | Do it! Even Xcode or Final Cut won't use more than 4 GB of memory, at least as I've seen. Just don't run too many virtual machines though.\n\nA quick note: If your Mac uses integrated graphics, its memory is shared with your main memory with kernel_task. Thus, you will have to subtract that amount from your total usable.\nSSD users, it's satisfying to have more space, but it's important to know that virtual memory thrives on SSDs, you can get whole lot of performance gain from it. Does it hurt the SSD? Yes, but you will long replace your Mac before you notice.\n\nA: Executive summary\nA swap area (called swap partition, swap file or page file) is just a mechanism to augment the physical memory addressable by the OS.\nIf you are low in available physical RAM, and on today's machine, I would say if you have 4 GB or less RAM. Then you should probably have a swap. But this depends on your workload and how you use your machine.\nIf you have more than 4GB of RAM, there is a good chance that your system might never use the swap. So if the swap is enable or not, this won't change much.\nAlthough this depends on other factors, the longer your machine will be running the more likely the OS will swap small unused portion of the RAM to the swap eventhough there is plenty of place left apparently. However, often the system use the \"free\" RAM for file buffers and other stuff, and some workload might make your file buffer use all available RAM.\nBackground information\nAny way what would happen if you disable the swap and your memory is completely used? Well, the next time an application request more memory (like with a malloc or realloc), it will receive an error! If it is properly coded, the application will detect it, but handling such an error and terminating the program gracefully could be a challenge still! However, many developer don't test for successful memory allocation and often the application crashes as soon as this non allocated memory is going to be used. So there is a strong chance that the application will crash, and actually that many application will crash because you have more than one application usually running at the same time. Hopefully, the kernel itself should be immune, but in my experience it was not always the case.\nIf you have swap, you will have the same behaviour, but you have a higher limit so chances are that you won't reach that limit.\nI have personnaly 2 machines with 8 and 16 GB of RAM. My personal usage of these machine should never bring me close to use all of this RAM (today! perhaps in a few years that could be different). The only reason I would hit the physical RAM limits is that a process got rogue and is consuming all the RAM. Having no swap is a relief, the kernel will promptly kill the rogue process as soon as it hit the RAM limit. If you have swap, you will get a painful experience (maybe not on SSD...) as your system will swap and swap and swap and become sometimes totally unresponsive until hopefully your kernel kills the culprit!\nAdvises\nYou should not be scared by people telling you something horribly wrong might happen if you remove swap. If you do so, your physical address space will be reduced, much like if you would go from 4 GB of RAM to 2 GB. Would you do such a thing? Then you should not remove the swap. You can however decide to limit it, and that would be wise.\nIf one thinks his workload might bring him to use close or more than the available physical RAM, or if one needs a lot of I/O (read/write to disks), then swap should be kept.\nWhen swap should be kept, a user should try to set limits to the amount of memory a process can use. On a Linux system, one could use cgroups memory limits to avoid that some process gets out of control, I don't know the equivalent on OS X but that should be the way.\nHowever, if one has more than enough available memory for his workload, then he could safely disable swap or he could keep it. It won't change much even in terms of performance because if the system does not use the swap, then you don't get hit by a performance drop (especially visible on an old rotational hard disk, less so on SSD).\nUsing the same trick as above to try to set memory limits per process or group of processes is also beneficiary in the case of more than enough available RAM.\nMy own example\nI have an old PC with 1 GB RAM, there I do have a big swap: 4 GB so I can run Firefox and other application on it. I tend to use as little application (or tabs in Firefox) as possible to have a correct user experience though.\nI have a small server with 8 GB RAM. There I know exactly my work load and I do not want my server to slow down because a process got rogue and is consuming all memory. There I have no swap and cgroup memory limit enforcing barrier, so applications or services can crash but not the kernel. Btw, this is a Linux machine.\nThen, I have my Mac with 16 GB RAM. I am not the sole user of it, and we would not mind waiting when switching user. There we do have swap, it is difficult for me to plan the work load of other users of this computer. Even if I would be the only one I would use swap. I often run several VMs and use memory consuming applications, but not all at he same time, so I would not mind the OS swaping in an unused app so I can get faster disk I/O or launch yet another VM. Althoug up to now, I haven't seen this machine swapping!\n\nA: I just disabled the swap file on my 2011 Macbook air (4GB RAM, 128GB SSD) because I was sick of the swap file slowly eating up all my remaining HD space and then having to restart. This way, the idea is that I will just run less programs. \nI'll see if that really works, or if I will have to restart anyway to clear the \"Wired\" memory, but for now it appears to be working well. The one time the memory got really full the computer slowed down just as much it does when my SSD runs out of memory - but it recovered a lot faster as soon as I quit applications. (And I was actually able to quit applications, which I usually am not when the SSD fills up).\nI'll see how it goes stability wise, but so far I'm a happy camper. It also forces me to run fewer applications (and Chrome tabs) at a time, which is good for task focus. \n\nA: Some say: disabling swap improves performance.\nThis is true. Any use of virtual memory is a big slowdown – even a fast SSD is a thousand times slower than DRAM; a disk more like a million times slower. You only need a small fraction of memory accesses to go to swap to make a big difference in run time. If e.g. 0.1% of accesses go to your fast SSD, that theoretically halves your speed. However, multitasking hides this – while waiting for your swap device, the CPU can be kept busy doing something else. So as long as you have a reasonable level of multitasking so something is ready to run when you have a page fault, the performance loss is not that extreme. Too much stuff with high memory demands running at once leads to thrashing: swap activity dominates performance.\nBut: without swap, if you run out of physical memory, that is like running into a wall. Possibly you can sprint faster if you reduce your weight a bit by not wearing your glasses; the logic of this doesn’t get better if you have really heavy glasses…\n\nA: Why to disable the swap file in Mac OS X ?\n\nDoes it increase performance?\n\nYES - because when #OS start use swap it decreasing performance ⬇️ -- BUT under 2GB it is OK ✅\nmany times I have 15GB file and macos don't know what have to do first , high disk IO , and after reboot windows are in Desktop:1 ❌\n\nStability?

The trackpad only has one physical button, so it cannot detect a primary and secondary click at the same time, neither can any Apple mouse for that matter.\nBut, two-button mice come cheap...\nAlternatively, perhaps the game allows custom keybindings, or has alternate keyboard shortcuts available.\n\nA: In system preferences/settings (or whatever that is called in English), you can setup that if you click on the right of the trackpad, it will do a right click. I have no idea if that will work as I do not own a game with which I can test that...\n", "Q: What scriptable OCR Software exists on OSX for a paperless office I'm planning to get a paperless office and for that, I a need good scriptable piece of OCR for OS X?\nI've read a blogpost by Marco Arment about a few programs. Are there any workable ones there that allow me to script things?\n\nA: OCRKit has both AppleScript support and a CLI. From their help page:\n\nAppleScript\nYou can also script OCRKit to integrate it into your specific workflow.\n  For example process incoming files, via shared folder, from MFP copy\n   machine, etc. and simply tell OCRKit to open and thus process is via\n  AppleScript:\ntell application \"OCRKit\"\n   -- the wonders of AppleScript POSIX path handling, ...\n   open \"Users:admin:Desktop:orderform.pdf\"\n   open POSIX path of \"/Users/Admin/Desktop/orderform.pdf\"\nend tell \n\nCommand line\nSince OCRKit version 2.5 direct command line scripting is supported.\n  This greatly simplifies the use of OCRKit in batch processing, allows\n  to set more options and is also more robust and cross-platform than\n  AppleSCript.\nOCRKit.app/Contents/MacOS/OCRKit \\ \n    --lang en | de | fr | es | ... \\\n    --format pdf | html | rtf | text \\\n    --no-progress \\\n    --output out-file in-file\n\nSince OCRKit version 16.9 additional command line options are supported:\n-r, --recursive directory\n\nScan directory recursively for new files.

I have it, but I haven't used it in a long time, so I don't exactly remember how good it was. I think that it didn't do the first few documents very well, but it learns.\nOh, and I'm not sure about scriptability. I'll check it.\nIt looks like Readiris has a scripting dictionary, and it's pretty good, too.\n\nA: ABBYY FineReader Pro for Mac does OCR well and is scriptable. From their blurb page:\n\nProcess Batches of Documents and Automate Conversion Tasks\nAchieve new levels of productivity and enjoy greater flexibility when converting documents with support for Automator actions and AppleScript commands.\n\nIt supports both Applescript and Automator. I hadn't tried to automate it previously but after looking into it, I have some plans to do some basic stuff.

We have a 'web service' iPhone app where users can generate new content (which is publicly viewable) by uploading texts.\nSo, wanted to confirm: is it okay if they discuss/chat on benefits or on how to jailbreak?\nWill the Apple take action once they find out? Or considering it to be user generated content, it will be ignored?\nEDIT:\nThe app is not specifically meant for discussing Jailbreak. The app has many categories, including a \"general chat\" category, where it is being discussed by the users.\n\nA: Unless Apple is hosting the user-generated content and the discussion of jailbreaking is in violation of the terms of use of that site, I don't see how Apple could take any action  against such a discussion.\nThere are certainly people using various Facebook, Twitter, and other public communication apps on their iPhones to discuss jailbreaking.\n", "Q: When and why did Apple make \"On My iPhone\" the default account for Contacts? I've been using Exchange with Google Contacts to manage my iPhone contacts. Recently, I noticed my Google Contacts wouldn't sync when I added a new contact to my phone. Today I found a setting under Contacts for \"Default Account: Exchange or On My iPhone,\" and the second one is chosen by default.\n\nWhen did they make this change? Why did they make this change? And is there any way to merge the two contact groups now that I've added a number of contacts to my phone?\n\nA: Contacts are added to your native iOS Address Book (called \"Contacts\" and located on your home screen) by default. This ensures contacts are added locally and synced properly (through iTunes)\nThe addition of an outside contacts manager (as seen by using Gmail) is an added feature and brought along with Gmail. However, some may simply just want to use Google's email services without storing their contacts. Keeping contacts stored locally on the device is always more beneficial because it has less chance to cause commotion or confusion. Tech savvy people can always change this behaviour, but by default, it is not the optimal choice.\nSo it's not a change they made, but rather the default setting that simply takes precedent. I'm not sure what version that setting snuck it's way into iOS, I'm sorry.\nIf you'd like to transfer your contacts from your iPhone to Gmail, you can do the following:\nIn Windows 7\n\n\n*\n\n*In iTunes, make sure you select syncing of your contacts with\nWindows Contacts under the Contacts section.\n\n*Once they are present in Windows Contacts, export them to CSV.\n\n*Then head over to Gmail, log in, pull up the Contacts page, and\nselect \"Import\" from the \"More\" drop-down menu.\n\n\nNote: An easy to follow tutorial can also be found here.\nIn Mac OS X\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Address Book after you've synced your iPhone with iTunes.\n\n*Click on an entry and hit CMD+A (this will select all the\nentries).\n\n*Then go to File > Export vCard...\n\n*Then head over to Gmail, log in, and follow the same \"Import\"\nprocedure above.\nNote: Additionally, Gmail supports syncing your contacts with your Mac using their Contact Sync service.\n", "Q: iMac SDD+HDD - noise? If the new 2011 iMac is equiped with SSD and HDD at the same time, is HDD running (so fan on) even at times when HDD not used for a longer period?\nContext: I need the computer to be really silent (bedroom), and only when exceptionally accessing e.g. video files to use HDD. So if HDD would run all the time, I would rather go for an option of sole SSD in iMac and external HDD which can be unplugged. Otherwise I would go for both in iMac.\n\nA: Definitely make the SSD your boot/app disk and set your computer to put hard disks to sleep. But even then there are many factors that can cause the drive to spin up even. Sometimes just getting an open dial box will cause it to spin up. \nI'd first make sure your HDD is not shown in the sidebar - if it is there it will definitely spin up every time you get a save or open dialog box or a finder window. \nEven after doing that I still had it spinning up more than I wanted so I followed this blog post on Dae’s blog to make an apple script that will unmount or mount it so I can explicitly control when it sleeps or doesn't sleep. Incase the link dies, here is the script. It even does Growl notification:\nset myVolumeLabel to \"Storage HD\"\n\ntell application \"GrowlHelperApp\"\n    set the allNotificationsList to {\"Disk mounted\", \"Disk unmounted\"}\n\n    register as application \"Disk Mounter\" all notifications allNotificationsList default notifications allNotificationsList icon of application \"Disk Utility.app\"\nend tell\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set diskDev to do shell script \"diskutil list | grep \\\"\" & myVolumeLabel & \"\\\" | grep -o 'disk[0-9]*' \"\n    if not (disk myVolumeLabel exists) then\n        do shell script \"diskutil mountDisk \" & diskDev\n        tell application \"GrowlHelperApp\" to notify with name \"Disk mounted\" title \"Volume mounted\" description \"Disk “\" & diskDev & \"” with volume “\" & myVolumeLabel & \"” has been successfully mounted.\" application name \"Disk Mounter\" icon of application \"Disk Utility.app\"\n    else\n        do shell script \"diskutil unmountDisk \" & diskDev\n        tell application \"GrowlHelperApp\" to notify with name \"Disk unmounted\" title \"Disk unmounted\" description \"Disk “\" & diskDev & \"” with volume “\" & myVolumeLabel & \"” has been successfully unmounted.\" application name \"Disk Mounter\" icon of application \"Disk Utility.app\"\n    end if\nend tell\n\nOne thing to note - this unmounts (\"ejects\") an entire drive - not just a single partition. \n\nA: Have you checked off the \"put the hard disk(s) to sleep when possible\" in the energy saver preference pane?\n\n\nA: Pavel, \nThat would depend on how you set up your machine.\nIf you have you system installed on the SSD drive, and just use the HDD for additional storage then the HDD should only spin up when you access that information or if you have Time Machine backing up to it.\nUsing the SSD as your main drive should keep the machine cooler to as there are no moving parts to get warm, so the fans should also be spinning much slower.\n", "Q: How can I convert a .mov into a .gif (or a .apng)?

I have suddenly come into a dire need to run PowerPC apps.\nMy understand is that Lion will never support 32-but PPC code. It seems like the only solution, therefore, is to install Snow Leopard.\nMy MacBook Pro was the last to come bundled with the Snow Leopard DVDs. Is it possible to use those to install it on a new partition? And if so, can I use Boot Camp?\nI know that Boot Camp supports Windows, and I have Windows 7 installed. But I don't know if it supports Snow Leopard. Also, it would be great to know if my Snow Leopard license covers this kind of usage.\n\nA: Is this on your MacBook Pro? If so, the disks should work both legally and pragmatically. You wouldn't need to use bootcamp though, since bootcamp is designed just for Windows. Nevertheless, it's pretty easy. Here are the basic steps I would follow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert your install DVD. Shutdown your computer.\n\n*Start your computer pressing the C key to boot from the DVD. \n\n*Once in the installation assistant, go to Disk Utility under Utilities > Disk Utility. \n\n*Select your disk. Select the Partition tab and click on the \"+\" to add a new one. Call it whatever you please, add at least 10GB of disk space (enough to install Snow Leopard), and make sure it's in Mac OS Extended (Journaled).\n\n*Apply the settings. Go through the installer like you normally would, though when it asks you where to install it, tell it you want the Snow Leopard to be on your new partition.\n\n\nThis should let you boot on Snow Leopard by pressing the opt/alt key, just like when you boot Windows. \nHope it helps!

I'm using Disk Utility to get around this, but it's frustrating to have to open that up when I'm staring at Finder all day long. \nThis is a recent development, as it was working fine before. I haven't installed anything new that I can associate with when this started happening.\nETA: I managed to fix this myself. Trashing the Finder and sidebar preferences and then restarting Finder did the trick.\n\nA: If this behavior persists past a reboot, you might need to go down some general problem isolation steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Isolating issues in Mac OS X\nThere used to be an article (it's gone or I can't find it at the moment) that walked you through setting aside the application preferences or testing this behavior in a new user. In your case - it looks like you figured it out, but I wanted to at least mention the official guide in case others have the same symptoms but a different cause.\n\nA: Easier way than trashing Finder is to restart its service by the following commands:\nlaunchctl stop com.apple.Finder\nlaunchctl start com.apple.Finder\n\nThis should fix any glitches associated by Finder.\n\nA: EDIT:\nI have found and solved the problem:\nThe reason why I could not eject from Finder was, because I apparently put a check-mark in Tinker Tool where I shouldn't have.\nThis is one of the first things I do after freshly installing a macOS, take Tinker Tool, Onyx and so forth to tweak the system to my liking. Since this is a MacBook Air and it doesn't have a DVD drive, I must have thought, let's hide the eject function.\nDuh! This also eliminates the possibility to eject everything else, like DMG's, servers and so on.\n\nORIGINAL POST:\nI'm having the exact same issue as OP but under Mojave. And it's also a recent issue that didn't exist from the beginning but I don't know what I have changed since that might have caused the issue.\nI cannot eject anything (external drive, network drive, mounted volume) from the Finder by clicking on the eject symbol. I get no reaction whatsoever. I CAN eject from Disk Manager.\nRestarting Finder with the launchctl command does not work, neither does deleting the Finder preferences neither in normal nor in safe boot mode. (I don't know what \"sidebar preferences\" are, but I also deleted desktop and dashboard prefs -- not effect.)\nNeither does clicking control, alt or command with the eject button.\nI'm flabbergasted as to why this happens and what could be the culprit.

I have an external HDD with 4 partitions.\nMy question is the following: is there a way of telling the OS to mount just two of them (One FAT and one HFS+) when I connect the HDD? It is rather annoying to have 4 \"disks\" connected on the finder, and it makes ejecting the drive a test to my patience. \nI would appreciate your suggestions. If it's impossible I guess I'll just have to fiddle around and get everything in 2 partitions... :/\n\nA: You can add entries in /etc/fstab to prevent volumes from mounting. This is similar to the technique @cksum describes. Here are some example one-liners. They will create an fstab file if it doesn't exist, otherwise they will append. You need admin privileges.\n\n\n*\n\n*Prevent an HFS (Mac) volume named Archive from mounting. If it is mounted manually, it will be Read/Write.\necho \"LABEL=Archive none hfs rw,noauto 0 0\" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab\n\n*NTFS volume named BOOTCAMP. Read-only.\necho \"LABEL=BOOTCAMP none ntfs ro,noauto 0 0\" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab\n\n*FAT32 volume named PMBPORTABLE. Read-only.\necho \"LABEL=PMBPORTABLE none msdos ro,noauto 0 0\" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab\n\nA: Yes. You'll need to create a file called \"fstab\" in /etc if it is not already there:\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nNext, we'll need the partitions Unique Universal Identifier (UUID). Open Disk Utility, and highlight the partition you'd like to no have auto-mounted. Then hit CMD+I and you'll be greeted with the following screen (notice the UUID highlighted):\n\nWe will then need to enter the following line into our fstab file. The following example will prevent my \"Shockwave\" partition from auto-mounting:\nUUID=27C2148B-1734-3900-B89C-FE3EB7E11DBC    none   hfs   rw,noauto\n\nHit CNTRL+O to save when you're done. You can add as many as you like; one per line. Reboot and those partitions specified in fstab will not be mounted. \nThe UUID is the partitions unique identifier (consult the man-page below if you'd like to use device's label instead). The noauto tag tells OS X not to auto mount on load. You can still mount them using Disk Utility, but OS X won't do it for you initially. \nIf you'd like to learn more about fstab and what you can do with it, you can view it's respective man-page.\n", "Q: Skype two way screen sharing Is it possible to do two-way screen sharing on Skype mac? if I share my screen with someone, the other person is unable to share theirs with me (thought their camera works). Is this a Premium feature? I've looked on http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/features/allfeatures/screen-sharing/#t_tab_mac but its unclear if this supports two way or not.\nthanks\n\nA: Screen sharing on Skype is one-way only. Only one person in the call can share their screen with the other callers at one time. With the free accounts the sharing is limited to one-to-one. With the premium accounts you can do a one-to-many broadcast and share your screen out to multiple people at the same time.\nThis does make some sense, two-way sharing has to overcome a huge problem of mirror-in-mirror replication. The same sort of effect you get when you place two mirrors, facing each other, and look into them. There's an infinitely repeating, but gradually reducing, view of the other mirror, in the other mirror, in the other mirror, in the other mirror...\nA similar thing would occur if you were to do a 2-way share.\nIf you use VNC for screen sharing you can actually force the two-way share to happen and see the effect for yourself.\n\nA: What do you want to share? I am a Windows User, and there I use Visual Studio Live Share, which is great for code / development.

If the goal is to keep all the machine's factory-installed parts intact, it would appear you would have to use an external SSD.\n", "Q: How fast should my MBP internal drive be? I'be been experiencing an ongoing (if not precisely measurable) feeling that my MBP is underperforming, and it seems to be related to disk IO. I recently downloaded a disk benchmarking tool, to see how the disk is performing. The issue, however, is that I don't know from that how the disk should be performing. Where can I find numbers to set my expectations?\nThis is a late-2010 17\" MBP with a 7200RPM Hitachi HTS725050A9A362 drive.\nI'm also not sure 100% if the issue is in disk I/O; I'm trying to narrow the problem down. Other slowdowns, for example, include text entry in this form; typing the word \"slowdowns\" back there, for example -- I'd completely finished typing it before the text appeared in the form field. So, it seems likely that there are other things going on.\n\nA: Yep. That's not a disk issue. My suggestions / theories:\nFileVault could be a reason for slowdown, and a pretty big one if your disk is very cluttered. Even with FileVault off, disk clutter can slow down your computer if it's excessive, specially on startup (though not when you're typing). I consider \"disk clutter\" to be about 80-90% of your disk space used. \nRAM could be a factor too, especially if you're running memory intensive apps. Your manual should have some more info on how much RAM your MacBook can have: up to what you can expand it (perhaps 8 GB). When your RAM gets full (you can see how full it is in Activity Monitor), it starts transferring memory pages from RAM to your HDD, which is considerably slower than the lightning fast RAM. Perhaps this could be an issue, because when your apps need that cache, it needs to load it from a slower source.\nAnd last, but probably the biggest: your apps. Check if any apps are eating your CPU in the background using Activity Monitor (Applications > Utilities > Activity Monitor). Also, check on System Preferences for any apps loading when you login (Accounts > Login Items tab). Try to get rid of some background apps you might not need. Flash is a CPU hog, and it has happened to me that it slows my whole web browser down to the point where even typing is slow.\n", "Q: How much current/power can be drawn from iPhone 30-pin connector?

Does it mean one must register before getting the official hardware specifications regarding 30-pin connector?\n\nA: Somewhere around 160 mA.\nKineteka sells a 30 pin breakout board and pin 18 supplies the 3.3 volts. I just connected a 500 ohm pot between pin 18 and ground and lowered the resistance while measuring the current. It tops out around 160 mA.

I made some capacitive styli with my brother, following this video on Cnet. \nI tried using it with the Wacom notebook app, and the handwriting is a teensy bit too large to work as well as a real live \"dead tree\" notebook.\nAt the moment, the app feels like a wide ruled notebook, and I'd love to be able to write as much as a college ruled notebook.\nIs the problem the tip of the sponge on my styli, or is it the resolution of the iPad? \nWhat can I do to improve the accuracy, so that I can fit more handwritten text on the page? \n\nA: This is a limitation of the iPad screen. No stylus will feel like a real pen. Future versions will likely have more sensitive screens. The best you can do is think of it as a giant index card and a fat marker. \nThe Wacom software improves the situation a tiny bit by having the zoom mode when writing.

There are known issues with the graphics drivers and glitches in the software as a result. You can get SL to install, but the performance and stability are lacklustre at best. And Apple is unlikely to add driver support for SL in future revisions of that operating system.\nAdditionally, you cannot manually add drivers for core components to OS X. You may be able to modify kernel extensions, but not at the level required to get the old OS operational. You may be able to port the graphics driver from Lion, but that is certainly a long-shot.\nYou can follow a discussion over the the Apple Forums for additional information, where it has been reported that the new Air installs a special build of Lion that carries with it a unique graphics driver. One user claims they got SL installed, but it does not recognize the internal display. That's a pretty big show-stopper, unless you want your new Air to be a desktop.\n", "Q: Graphics Card on Windows 7 on MBP I was just wondering was it possible to use the \"AMD Radeon HD 6490M \" card  of MBP on Windows 7  by installing Win7 either on\na) Boot Camp\nb) Parallels\nc) VmWare\nas I like to play games on Win7 for which I need t graphics card.\nThanks\n\nA: I have VMware and it does support native use of the video card. Boot Camp, of course, supports all of your Mac's hardware as well once you install the Apple driver set. I do not regularly play games anymore, so I cannot speak to how well something like Call of Duty would perform. What I can talk about is how well Windows performs in general when using VMware versus using Boot Camp. \nWhen I had the stock amount of memory on my MBP (4 GB), Windows seemed to be \"dragging\" under VMware. Under Boot Camp it ran great. The main app that I use on Windows is Visual Studio, which is pretty resource intensive--although perhaps not as much as a game. \nOnce I added the maximum amount of memory that my MBP can take (8 GB), VMware's performance became respectable. I can now use Visual Studio side by side with the rest of Mac OS X and it doesn't feel \"dragging\" anymore. Of course, when I switch to Boot Camp I can tell the difference right away--with 8 GB of RAM this MBP became the best Windows PC I have ever had.\nIn summary, if you have a sufficient amount of RAM, I would give it a shot under VMware for gaming. But Boot Camp will always be your best bet. Hope this helps. \n", "Q: How to recover .profile on Mac OS? I have mis-configured ~/.profile while adding new environment variable. I want to restore my original .profile for my Mac OS, I am not mac expert please help me. None of my shell command is working for me like ls, java, php etc Please help\n\nA: Show hidden files in Finder. Then you can either fix the problem in TextEdit, or simply remove/rename the file. There is no default ~/.profile on Mac OS X, only a global /etc/profile (and you may also have a ~/.bash_profile).\n\nA: If you still get to the shell prompt, you can use : > ~/.profile to create a new and empty file. Afterwards open a new shell in Terminal (by opening a new tab or window) and your environment should work again. \nIn addition: When editing .profile (or .bash_profile) it is always helpful to open a shell (terminal window) before you start editing. So even if you mess up the edit, you still have a working shell to fix issues (because .profile is only read once at start so further edits don't impact a running shell unless you source .profile again). And as usual: make backups.\n", "Q: Turn off automatic preview in apple mail Is it possible to turn off automatic preview of attachments when composing an e-mail?\nNOTE: Yes I know that I can manually ctr+select the attachment and disable preview, but I want this done automatically\n\nA: There is an extension for Apple Mail called Attachment Tamer.  It has all kinds of settings, but the most useful is the one that defaults attachments to the icon view.\nhttp://lokiware.info/Attachment-Tamer\nIt is $15 but well worth it.\n\nA: To expand on @user43521's answer, there are two ways to solve this problem:\nFirst solution:\nIf you drag-and-drop files—even images—into Mail.app's compose window, they'll be sent as real attachments (Content-Disposition: attachment).\nSecond solution:\nIf you open a terminal and enter this command, it will always make attachments real attachments:\ndefaults write com.apple.mail DisableInlineAttachmentViewing -bool yes\n\nYou only need to do this once. To revert to normal behavior:\ndefaults write com.apple.mail DisableInlineAttachmentViewing -bool no\n\nThe Viewing portion of this is very confusing; this affects how your outgoing mail is sent. If you receive mail with inline attachments, they'll be displayed as expected. In fact, it's even more confusing than that, because regardless of this setting, both inline and attached images that you receive will be displayed inline.\n\nA: In Terminal, type:\ndefaults write com.apple.mail DisableInlineAttachmentViewing -bool yes\n\nIf you want to turn it off again, use \ndefaults write com.apple.mail DisableInlineAttachmentViewing -bool no\n\nYou may need to restart Mail after running this to change the behavior.\n", "Q: Upgrading RAM/HDD in latest MBP I planning to buy a 13 inch MBP this month. Is it a good idea to stick to the standard 4GB of ram and 500GB harddrive, and upgrade it myself to 8GB/1TB? This would save me about $350. I have experience opening/repairing laptops, but I never had a MBP.. would this void my warranty?\n\nA: that's an excellent idea. Apple clearly overprices hardware upgrades. \nAnd don't worry, it's super-easy to do (be sure to buy a Philips #00 and a T6 torx screwdriver) and it doesn't void your warranty! \nfor detailed step-by-step guides you can go to ifixit.com . \n", "Q: Apple Server - how to exclude a subdomain?

I do not use Mail.app, instead using Postbox 2 for all my email needs. I do use iCal for my calendaring, syncing it with my Google Apps accounts.\nWhenever iCal wants to send a reminder, it tries to open Mail.app to do so, which is highly annoying.\nCurrently the only solution I have working is to zip up Mail.app in /Applications so iCal can no longer access it. However whenever the OS updates (i.e. from Snow Leopard to Lion) it replaces Mail.app and I have to do this again. This seems overly hackish.\nIs there a way to force iCal to stop trying to open Mail.app without having to manually remove Mail.app?\n\nA: The instructions below (posted here) did it for us as our permissions were, actually, on \"Read Only\" and the Mail.app was still launching. \nNote: If iCal still opens Mail.app for mailing an event after you have set Postbox as your default mail client:\n\n\n*\n\n*Within the Finder, right-click on the iCal icon and then select Show Package Contents.\n\n*Navigate to the \"Contents\" folder, then the \"Resources\" folder. Right-click on the folder called \"Scripts\" and select Get Info.\n\n*Expand the Sharing & Permissions box and click the Lock Icon in the lower right hand corner to unlock this setting. Change any permissions that are listed as \"Read Only\" to \"Read & Write.\"\n\n*Restart Postbox.\n\n\nIf more information is needed, check out a more detailed Postbox iCal Integration page for more options and troubleshooting tips.\nHave a great day!\n\nA: The non useful way is not to set email as the reminder action in iCal.\nMore constructively is to write an Automator action that uses Postbox and then use that automator action as the reminder action.\nI have an automator as an app and this is entered in the iCal GetInfo as\n\nTo create an iCal Alarm - Start automator and the first thing offers options for the workflow and one of them is an iCal Alarm - The automator then can include a shell or applescript script to call your mailer\n\nA: I had the same thing and found the answer on SuperUser:\n\nTherefore, unless you disable Mail.app responding to this AppleScript call (tell application \"Mail\"), there's really only one way to kill Mail.app (as per my comment on waiwai's answer):\n\nsudo chmod 000 /Applications/Mail.app/Contents/MacOS/Mail\n\n\nTo reverse:\n\nsudo chmod 755 /Applications/Mail.app/Contents/MacOS/Mail\n\n\nA: You can try this :\nOpen the Mail App. Then, in the Preferences Dialogue Box, change the value of the pop-up menu parameter called \"Default email reader\" to \"Postbox 2\".\n\n\nA: A similar question was recently asked about Sparrow here: How can I use Sparrow to send iCal e-mail notifications instead of Mail.app?\nIn answer to that question I found a script that does close to what you want but for Sparrow (an alternate mail client for OS X). You might be able to alter that AppleScript to achieve what you are after with your mail client of choice.\n", "Q: How do I capture video in real time from a Canon 5D Mark II to iMac in Final Cut Pro? We really need your help.\nWe are shooting a movie and searching for a solution how to capture video from HDMI port of Canon 5D Mark II to an iMac 27 inch in real time. The iMac doesn't have an HDMI port. We have a Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter, but it's not bidirectional so we can't use Mini DisplayPort for input.\nIs there any way to capture video in our case? Are there other adapters that are bidirectional or something else?\n\nA: You may be able to use the Log and Capture window (File>Log and Transfer):\n\nHowever, this requires you to hook up the camera in such a way that Final Cut Pro recognizes. IIRC, the Canon 5D Mark II doesn't have a Firewire cable. The HDMI capture card might work, as long as FCP recognizes it.\n\nA: You can try with a capture card. Blackmagic offers several options with HDMI.\nBlackmagic has two models in the Blackmagic Intensity series that provide inexpensive external stand-alone HDMI converters that you can connect to a Mac with Thunderbolt or USB 3.0, respectively. Prices are about US $190 to $290.\n", "Q: Remote connection to Time Capsule I've found the link below which provides useful info on how to configure Time Capsule for remote connection.  I've followed this and am able to connect to remotely manage the TC (via Airport utility) but still cannot connect in order to access files.  I'm trying from a Windows PC.\nHow can I access my Time Capsule remotely?\n\nA: The first thing to check is if the Time Capsule was told explicitly to share the files over the internet using bonjour or simply sharing to the WAN.\nHave you verified that the active profile on the Airport is set to allow this?\n\nMy example has these turned off (you can see them under the guest access control)\n\nA: Make sure that you have a clear path to the Internet in terms of firewalls, and ensure that TCP port 5354 and UDP ports 4500 and 5353 are open and unrestricted.\nOnce you've done that, make sure you are logged into iCloud on your computer, and that the remote Time Capsule is on (also making sure those ports are unblocked on that end).

I installed the second keyboard layout the way I usually do, but when I pressed Alt-Shift to switch, nothing happened. After playing around with the settings a bit more, I was able to switch to the other keyboard layout, but not back to the regular American English layout. No language bar either.\nalt+shift does not work, nor does Ctrl+shift, nor does specifying a separate key combination for each layout like Ctrl+0 | Ctrl+1 | Ctrl+shift+0\nInterestingly, the Text Services and Input Languages dialog box dies with I select the United States (Apple) layout and click on Properties. \nI am running W7 64-bit on an 20\" early 2009 iMac. I have the version of the wired, USB Mac keyboard without the keypad and the middle group of keys. Bootcamp is up to date.\nUpdate\nI did a bit more troubleshooting and discovered that for some reason, ctfmon.exe, which I believe is the process that handles switching between keyboard layouts and displaying the language bar, isn't running. I also encountered several other posts on the Net with people complaining of similar issues when running Windows under Bootcamp, but unfortunately no solution. \nAnyway, trying to run ctfmon.exe manually (from the start menu or Run dialog) or adding it to the Run section in the registry does not fix the isssue because ctfmon.exe simply refuses to run.\n\nA: I had this problem and fixed it by: Control Panel -> Regional Settings -> Keyboard and Languages (tab) -> Change keyboards (button) -> Selelct the top language added: (English United States) -> then click \"Add\" -> Navigate between the options to (English United States) -> click on \"keyboard\" -> now check the option \"US\"\nThis solved my problem, I hope it solves yours\n\nA: I'm to some extend sure that this is a problem with the Apple English Keyboard dll. Here is why I think so. Go to \"Text services and input languages\". If \"United States (Apple)\" is among the input languages, try to double click it. If it crashes the dll host then you have the same problem as me which I think has something to do with bootcamp drivers.\nI tried to solve this by remove the afformentioned keyboard layout and add another English keyboard.

This will allow me to put the MacBook in clam shell mode and still have two monitors.\nWhat is the best way to make this happen?\nThanks \n\nA: Updated with more detail below...\nIn order to power your LG LCD your best bet may be to use an external device to power the monitor. Matrox's Dual Head 2 Go would fit your needs. It has been updated for Thunderbolt equipped Macs.\nYou may run into some strange side effects of using a system like this though. Up to now Matrox's DH2GO causes a Mac to recognize the two monitors connected as a single display. This means your main menu is split across the monitors and dialogs that pop up may show up somewhere between the two.\nConjecture Lies Below\nI don't know how Thunderbolt may change this (either at a hardware or software level) but it's likely that it could as Apple will need to pay attention to this type of setup now that they are advertising a MacBook powering two displays via Thunderbolt.\nThey may also use it as a way to push people toward two Apple Displays instead of a hybrid setup like you suggest.\n\nUpdate\nApple has added a knowledge base article on this topic which may answer many of your questions. You can find it here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4885\nHow the displays work will depend on the exact computer you have (including the screen size of a MBP) check the details included in that article.\nAlso, there's an article in Macworld with some details on what happens if you connect an older monitor to Thunderbolt chain.

I want to have an SSD for the OS, and the existing disk that came with the unit.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: There are three possible models of Mac mini that came out in 2009: Early 2009, Late 2009, and the Late 2009 server variant. \nThe server variant comes with two hard drives already (and no optical drive), so I'm assuming you don't have that one. However, since the server and non-server variants use the same case, it seems a safe assumption that you could fit a hard drive in the space usually taken by the optical drive. Getting the hard drive to be held properly in that spot might be difficult, but maybe one of the optical drive replacement caddies could help.\nThere doesn't seem (and I don't remember there being) a significant physical difference between the early and late 2009 models, so I think the same assumption would apply.\nIn any case, be sure to check the iFixit (or similar) teardown before you start and do tell us if it works (or if it doesn't)!\n", "Q: Remapping keyboard shortcuts in Chrome and Firefox I recently switched from Windows to Mac.  One of the things that's really ingrained in my muscle memory is hitting Alt+D in a browser to go to the address bar.

Click \"+\" to add a new app shortcut and then select Google Chrome from the list of Apps.\nNow, you must assign \"Bookmark This Page...\" to something else first so that you can truly override command+D. I chose to select shift+command+B.\nAfter that click \"+\" again, and assign \"Open Location...\" to command+D. Now it should work.\nI can't believe how long it took me to find this answer, I guess everyone else uses Alt+L or Firefox.

Some of them (DVD rips, photos) I want to be available to anyone on my network, and some (backups, personal file storage) I want to restrict to certain users.\nI know that I can change the permissions for different folders by modifying the \"Sharing & Permissions\" attributes in the \"Get Info\" window, but how does that work if the user is coming from a different computer? Obviously that's no good if someone can just make a new user on their own computer with the same name and then have access.\nAll machines are running OS X Lion. Is this something I need Lion Server for?\n\nA: The \"Sharing and Permissions\" attributes are directly related to other users on your computer. In System Preferences, you can enable \"File Sharing\" which allows others on your network to connect to your machine and access folders that you designate.\nIn the configuration for File Sharing, you designate \"Shared Folders\". You can set them up to be read (or even written to) by \"Everybody\" or only designated users. Those designated users would need to have an account on your machine to authenticate themselves; the name of their account on their own machine isn't the factor here.\nNone of this requires Lion Server.\n", "Q: Battery indicator is not moving further from 96% I bought a new macbook pro, till the day I bought the battery indicator is not moving further from 96%. \nI wonder if there is a problem with the battery because if I unplug my power cable it is still showing 96%. \nMy previous Mac used to show 100% or \"Charged\" but in OS X Lion it isn't the same, is it? \n\nA: Over time, a battery will stop holding 100% of its charge. This is normal. After a good 1-2 years of constant use, I have seen this happen on all of my batteries. \n\nA: You probably need to recalibrate your battery.

I currently have the Dock to the left.  In the Displays pane of System Preferences, I have the external display (if present) configured to be on the left side of the main built-in display; and the menu bar on the built-in display.\nProblem: \n\n\n*\n\n*when I connect an external display, the Dock jumps to it, separating it from the menu bar.  \n\n\nHow can I configure the Dock to stay on the main display with the menu bar?\nSome things to keep in mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*I prefer the Dock to the left. \n\n*I don't want it on the right, since that would interfere with the disk icons on the desktop.\n\n*I don't want it on the bottom, since I have widescreen displays and that would be wasteful of vertical screen real-estate. \n\n*I can't unusably configure the external display to be on the right side, since it's actually to the left, given the way my desk is setup. \n\n\nI'm using Mac OS X Lion on a Macbook Pro.\n\nA: As far as I can find, putting the Dock on the left side of the right monitor or the right side of the left monitor can't be done.\nBut let's look at other possible solutions to your problem. Point #1 notes that you don't want the dock on the right because it would interfere with disk icons on the desktop. And when you first drag the Dock to the right side, it does indeed cover the disk icons on the right side. But if you select \"clean up\" on the Desktop once the Dock is positioned on the right, it will move those icons over to make room for the Dock. This is a temporary solution, however, because newly mounted drives will still be buried by the dock. If you select \"clean up by name\", however, then newly mounted drives will fit into the grid created and not be covered by the Dock.\nNot the solution you were looking for, I know, but it might be a workaround.\n\nA: This question is old but here's how I solved this problem. I have a three monitor and so if I placed the dock right or left it went way too far afield of my main monitor.\nA simple but kind-of-clever solution: go to Settings->Display->Arrangement and place your left monitor ABOVE your middle monitor on the virtual arrangement. Now if you choose left side for your dock it stays on the left of the middle monitor. \nThe only weirdness is that you have to remember to move the mouse \"up\" to get to the left monitor and \"down\" to get back to the middle. I find this to be very easy to do... it feels a little awkward for at most five minutes or so.. then it works fine. \nI just started doing this so I'm not a 100% sure I'm not going to run into a surprising weirdness, but I can't think of what that would be...\n\nA: Hold shift while clicking+dragging the resize divider. It will allow you to reposition the dock, including to a different monitor. Though does not allow to place the Dock on a Edge to another Monitor.\n\nA: It's not currently possible to place the dock on a screen edge that borders another screen.\nOne solution for you might be to use the keyboard shortcut Opt + Cmd + D to show and hide the Dock as needed? When it is hidden, you can still mouse over to it and it will appear without needing to use a shortcut.\n\nA: The Dock need not conflict with items on Desktop\nHere with OS X 10.7.4, when I reposition the Dock – from bottom to right: \n\n\n*\n\n*icons of disks and other icons rearrange themselves on the desktop; no conflict.\n\n\nSnow Leopard was less tidy.

I'd like to know how to increase the font size for Eclipse so it adjusts the whole GUI to not look so darn small on my screen.\nFor NetBeans there is the --font-size switch which can be set in netbeans.conf, is there something similar for Eclipse?\n(In case it's useful, I'm on Snow Leopard.)\n\nA: Solution for Eclipse Oxygen at MacOS High Sierra (Dec 2017)\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal and run commands:\ncd /Applications/Eclipse.app/Contents/Eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.ui.themes_1.2.1.v20170809-1435/css\n\nvim e4_basestyle.css\n\n\n*Add a style:\n* {\n    font-size: 14;\n}\n\n\n*Restart Eclipse to apply changes.\n\nA: As far as I know, there's no way to increase the font globally. In Eclipse's Preferences, navigate to General > Appearance > Colors and Fonts.\nDialog font is the font used in the dialogs, and Text Font used in text editors, etc.\nI don't know how to increase the font for the rest of the GUI, though.\n\nA: Go to Preferences > General > Appearance > Colors and Fonts, expand the \"Basic\" folder and select \"Text Font\" and change that to whatever size you like. \nFor Eclipse Neon:\nTo Increase Ctrl +\nTo reduce Ctrl -\nfor Macs, use the command key, not the control key\n\n\nA: For eclipse luna :\nedit\neclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.ui.themes_1.0.1.v20141126-1957/css/e4_default_gtk.css\nand add at end of file :\n* {\n  font-size:14;\n} \n\nThis will make eclipse keep same font if you switch workspaces\n\nA: Inside the Eclipse.app is a setting for the font size. To make the fonts globally larger edit Eclipse.app » Contents » Eclipse » eclipse.ini and remove the line \n-Dorg.eclipse.swt.internal.carbon.smallFonts\nfrom the file. Save the file and restart Eclipse.\n\nA: I have Eclipse installed in a Linux machine. A while ago I did a Linux update and it messed up the fonts on the entire system. All the fonts got larger. So, I went all over the place resizing the fonts for each application.\nGuess what?! On the next Linux update, the fonts got back to normal. However, I had to go back and undo all the font resizing that I had previously done on every application. So, when it came time to reset the fonts in Eclipse, I couldn't remember exactly what I did. I went to the following location:\nWindow > Preferences > General > Appearance > Colors and Fonts > Basic > Text Font > Edit\n\nNo matter what I did on this setting, the font remained the same.\nI finally figured out what the problem was. I had also resized the fonts on the following location:\nWindow > Preferences > General > Appearance > Colors and Fonts > Structured Text Editors > Structured Text Editor Text Font (overrides default: Text Font) > Edit\n\nOnce I edited this setting, the fonts on Eclipse went back to normal.\n\nA: NOTE: For those coming from Google, this change has no effect on later MacOS/Eclipse versions of El Capitan and Mars, respectively. See this related question: Yosemite: How do increase font size of Eclipse globally?\n\nA: You go to colors and font and go to the java drop down and find java editor and edit the size and it should work as it has for me.\n\nA: eclipse on Mac, for the font in the tools bar, you have to go to the system preference->display->resolution, and change the system font.\n\nA: window --> preference-->general-->apperance-->colors and fonts-->basic -->text font\n\nA: Menu: window -> editor -> zoom in/out\n", "Q: What is a good processor speed for FCP 6 real-time playback? I currently have a 2.2GHz dual-core macbook pro (2007) and it doesn't seem to work very well with HDV 720p real-time playback. I am looking into buying a new iMac this or next year. What would be a good processor speed for rendering and real-time playback in FCP 6 or 7? They currently have quad-core 2.5, 2.7, and 3.1 GHz.\n\nA: Certainly get the fastest you can afford, but processor speed is only part of the equation.  You should also get as much RAM as you can afford.\nIt is a fallacy that higher processor speed = shorter task completion times.  A fast processor helps, but RAM is more important than processor speed.  More RAM means the processor can handle more tasks at once.\nA MacBook Pro tops out at 8GB currently.  For video editing, I always max out RAM on a laptop.  For a desktop, I might go to 16GB or more if I was planning to work with multiple uncompressed tracks.\n", "Q: Is it safe to remove ~/Library/Mail folders I just traded in Mail.app for Sparrow and want to clear up some space on my hard drive.

I meant both \"won't break Mail if I open it again and re-enable those accounts.\" and \"won't delete the messages on the IMAP server\"\n\nA: By safe, I assumed you meant \"will this screw up my computer?\"  \nThe answer is no, it will not mess up your computer...  your computer will be just fine.   Mail.app stores it's data in ~/Library/Mail/*  Removing this folder will not mess up the way the computer behaves, and if you launch Mail.app in the future, it will simply recreate these folders as needed.\nYou may however want to back up the files in case you realize that there was something in there that you needed... \n\nA: By safe, I assume you mean \"will not delete message on the server?\" That's correct, you can go ahead and delete those - think of the as a \"cache\" of your emails. As long as you aren't deleting and emptying the trash from within whatever mail client you are using, they will remain on the server.\nDo consider a backup before deleting ANYTHING from ~/Library (or any other Libraries on your Mac).\nIn this specific case, I would explicitly rebuild the mailbox indexes just in case the system will clean them up once you're done deleting things...\n", "Q: Problems with Apple's Security Update 2011-005 (Lion)? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhy folders keep shifting their positions? \n\nToday I downloaded Apple Security Update 2011-005 for Lion (http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1447). However, I got some issues here. After the update I noticed that some of the folders on my Desktop was rearranged. Moreover, my Mac started slowing down.\nDoes anybody else have same problems? \n\nA: The update replaces 3 files, all pertaining to your system's keychain. They are as follows:\n/System/Library/Keychains/EVRoots.plist\n/System/Library/Keychains/SystemRootCertificates.keychain\n/System/Library/Keychains/SystemTrustSettings.plist\n\nIt is impossible that the update has caused your problems.

I'm new to OS X. I'm running OS X Lion on a MacBook Pro. Is it safe to upgrade the bash shell using Homebrew:\n$ brew install bash\n\nIf safe, how do I make it the default instance of the shell I run through Terminal?\nThanks!\n\nA: I could be wrong here, but as far as I know brew would install it's own instance of bash, since brew works under /usr/local/bin while the system defaults works under /bin (and /usr/bin).\nAbout Terminal, you can make shells open with your own, custom command. Go to Preferences > Startup and select Shells open with: Command (complete path). Simply type the path to your new bash and vuala!\nHope it helps!\nBTW: Backup! Best advice in this situations!\n\nA: Well before you do anything, back up your current file (of course, but always deserves to be said)\nsudo cp /bin/bash /bin/bash.3.2.bk\n\nThen create a symlink to the bash executable that Homebrew downloaded. I think it will be in /usr/local/Cellar, like so\nsudo ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/bash/4.2.10/bin/bash /bin/bash\n\nNow /bin/bash points to the file in your usr/local directory\n\nA: Binaries in /{,usr/}{,s}bin/ should not usually be replaced with other files. Other programs expect them to be the versions that came with OS X, and they are replaced by OS upgrades.\nAfter running brew install bash, you can change the default shell safely by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adding /usr/local/bin/bash to /etc/shells\n\n*Running chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash.\n\n\nSettings in Terminal or iTerm 2 don't normally have to be changed.

The Apple keychain application will not let you remove system roots, it will only allow you to disable them. It will only allow you to disable them one at a time. For each one, you need to go through 3 UI panels and type your password. Is there a way to either automate this or do it all at once? I do not like Apple's current selection of system roots.\n\nA: Backup keychain before trying anything.\nListing root certificates:\nsudo security dump-keychain /System/Library/Keychains/SystemRootCertificates.keychain\n\nJust look in a dump for a names or SHA-1 hash values of certificates that you want to get rid of and write them down.\nNow you can delete that root certificates using security delete-certificate command. \n\nUsage: delete-certificate [-c name] [-Z hash] [-t] [keychain...]\n-c  Specify certificate to delete by its common name\n-Z  Specify certificate to delete by its SHA-1 hash value\n-t  Also delete user trust settings for this certificate The certificate to be deleted must be uniquely specified either by a\n\nstring found in its common name, or by its SHA-1 hash.

The iMac froze whilst using Chrome, and I was forced to reset it.\nAfter the reset the screen seemed to freeze on the apple logo, with the spinning wheel. I've followed several steps on different sites with weird results.\n\n\n*\n\n*I've reset the PRAM/NVRAM as Apple suggested.\n\n*I've tried a safe boot, the progress bar got to about 35% then gave up and showed the screen I have now\n\n*Tried booting from an install disk (Snow Leopard) to use Disk Utility.

As you can still access the iMac via SSH it might be possible to fix it.\nBut as single-user boot seems to work without problems you might be better of with having a look at TS2570.\n\nA: I had this issue before. My solution is to use AppCleaner for uninstalling Chrome, and then restart the Mac. After that, reinstall Chrome should fix the problem.\n\nA: Try booting holding the Option or R key.  That should give you the Recovery Disk option.  That should fix what's wrong. \n\nA: It sounds like you could have some incompatible Kernel Extensions that are causing an issue with the Window Server (the bit that runs the GUI), though I would have though the Safe Boot might work around that.\n", "Q: Why does my AirPlay stream distort at high volume? I have an airport express connected to basic (but not crappy) speakers. When I run audio directly to them it plays fine, but when I run audio from either my iPhone or Mac to the speakers via AirPlay, I get crackly distorted sound if the volume slider is above about 75%.\nDoes anyone know why this could be? I have the airport set to extend my current network; could that affect it? \n\nA: Network issues only ever result in the audio cutting out, they can't really change the content.\nDistortion means your speakers get overloaded. Turning down the volume is your only option.\nThe reason your speakers are fine on the Mac is that after the slider in iTunes the sound gets further attenuated by the system volume buttons on your keyboard. If you turn those up far enough you'll get distortion as well.\n", "Q: Skype is showing up in Launchpad twice — why? How do I fix it? Skype is showing up in Launchpad twice. It's been acting like this for a while but if I remember correctly I think it first started when I let Skype auto-update itself a while back.\nAny ideas why Skype is showing up twice?\nHow can get rid of the extra Skype instance?\n\nI have searched my hard drive using spotlight including \"system files\" for an extra application bundle. None exists.\nWhen click either of the Skype icons in Launchpad they both seem to launch the same application (Activity Monitor confirms this — they are at the same path).\n\nA: Well, a bit more research and I may have found a solution. \n* Proceed with caution. Backup files. Be smart. This worked for me YMMV. *\nThe Easy Solution\nThe most straight forward way to fix this problem seems to be to delete the SQLite database that stores Launchpad's data. To do this simply open the following folder,\n~/Library/Application\\ Support/Dock\n\nand delete any .db files you find in there. They'll have a file name that looks like this,\n58357ED0-F8D5-4EB3-9A1F-E6B71B0A001D.db\n\nThen open terminal and type this command followed by return:\nkillall Dock\n\nBut be careful, you will lose any icon groups you created in Launchpad. I didn't like this solution for that reason so I while this worked to get rid of the duplicate icons I used the following solution on my machine.\nThe Hard Solution\nI opened the above mentioned folder and located the above mentioned file and then opened that file in SQLite Database Browser by dragging the file onto the icon for the db browser.\nOnce I had the file open I clicked Browse Data and then selected Apps from the Table menu. \n\nI then scrolled through the list of apps until I found one of the duplicate records for Skype and selected it.\n\nWith the duplicate record selected I clicked Delete Record.\n\nI then quit SQLite Database Browser and acknowledged that I wanted to save my changes. \nThen I switched to terminal and typed this command followed by return:\nkillall Dock\n\nAnd Skype's doppelganger was thereby vanquished from my Launchpad.\n\nA: The EASIEST solution. Download the LaunchPad Control Preference pane, and use it to hide the pages, groups or single icons you don't want, like the duplicated Skype icon.\n\nA: An addition to the answer of Samuel Mikel Bowles. When editing the Launchpad database, best is to remove all references to the app. \nThe structure of the database is as follows:\nTABLE items This is the table where all items of your launchpad are stored. This is the first place to delete an app. The column \"rowid\" correspondents to the apps table \"item_id\". The column \"parent_id\" correspondents to the groups table \"item_id\".\nTABLE apps This is where all apps are stored (with a human-readable app name in the column \"Title\"). Find the app that you want to remove here and remember the \"item_id\" so you can also remove it from the items table.\nTABLE groups Contains the groups you created in your launchpad. The \"item_id\" column of this table correspondents to the \"parent_id\" column of the items table. I had some orphaned groups that I deleted by removing the entry from this table.\nThis is off course the die-hard way, but gives you full control. Easier is to use Launchpad control.\nUpdate: deleting a row from the items table seems to also delete the entry in the apps table, so no need to delete it in different tables. They are linked I assume.\n\nA: Simpler, less potentially destructive, solution found on this forum: \n\n\n*\n\n*Move the Skype.app  application from your applications folder to the trash, but DO NOT EMPTY IT.\n\n*Open Launchpad and click on the Skype icon in Launchpad, the Skype icon should show a \"?\", then disappear from Launchpad.\n\n*Move the Skype.app application from the trash back to your applications folder.\n\n*Open Launchpad again, there should be only one Skype icon now.\n\n\nA: Its because of update. You just remove the old one from dock by right clicking the icon and then selecting remove from dock.\n", "Q: How can I prevent Homebrew from installing a duplicate of software I installed through other means? I like using Homebrew for installing Unix software on my Mac, and appreciate that it doesn't try to install multiple copies of things like Python.  There are some packages I've already installed manually, though, and I don't want Homebrew to install its own copies of them.  \nIn my current situation, I installed OCaml using the standard installer.  Now I want to install Coq via Homebrew.  I see via brew deps coq that it depends on OCaml.  I know I can tell it to skip installing OCaml this time via brew install --ignore-dependencies coq.  However, I'd rather not have to do that every time I install a Homebrew package that requires OCaml.\nHow can I make Homebrew pretend that it installed software that I installed through other means, so that it doesn't try to install a duplicate copy?\n\nA: Take the path that you used for --prefix= during your ./configure and sym-link that into the Cellar/ directory that Homebrew is using. Homebrew will see these directories and see the dependencies as satisfied (unless you need to have them compiled with or without certain features to make Homebrew's formulas compile correctly). If your manually-compiled deps aren't compiled correctly, you'll probably get errors out of Homebrew.\nln -s /path/from/prefix/ /usr/local/Cellar/path/from/prefix\n(Note the trailing slash on the first path, and lack of trailing slash on the second. OS X can be picky about these slashes when creating sym-links.)\nThis is the wrong way to do it, you should just be using --ignore-dependencies coq — that's what it's there for.\n\nA: A slightly different take, whichs ends up with a similar solution to @Bryson's answer but the way to get there may be more general and helpful to more people.  Also, I disagree with the statement that the proper way to do this is to use the --ignore-dependencies flag. When you use that flag is says\n\nWarning: --ignore-dependencies is an unsupported Homebrew developer flag!\nAdjust your PATH to put any preferred versions of applications earlier in the\nPATH rather than using this unsupported flag!\n\nAdditionally I don't like that solution because you have to remember to manually check the dependencies of everything you install going forward, and manually do the work of installing all of those dependencies other than the one you want to avoid. I think that's a pretty bad solution.\nThe warning actually contains a suggestion for how to fix the problem; adjust your path variable.  I ran into this with Java, not OCaml, but the solution should be the same for any software.\nbrew puts executables into /usr/local/bin/ so the directory with the executable of the dependency which you want to use must be earlier in your path than /usr/local/bin/.  So I check what Java executable is being used\n$ which java\n/usr/bin/java\n\nAnd I check my path to see where that is relative to /usr/local/bin/\n$ echo $PATH | tr ':' '\\n'\n...\n/usr/local/bin\n/usr/bin\n...\n\nI could change the order of those in my .bashrc or .bash_profile but I actually want to keep that order, so instead I'm going to create a symlink in /usr/local/bin to point to the executable of the dependency in /usr/bin then brew will be able to see my version of the depedendency at the same level as all the other brew dependencies.\n$ ln -s /usr/bin/java /usr/local/bin/java\n\nNow brew will not try to install a different version of Java, or whatever dependency you are dealing with.\n", "Q: Checking number of reallocated sectors of HDD through Disk Utility, Mac OS X My MacBook was purchased in 2008. Yesterday I checked the number of reallocated sectors of the hard drive using Disk Utility. It showed there were no reallocated sectors. That seems strange since I haven't replaced my hard drive since 2008. Can I rely on Disk Utility for this information or I need to download additional software?\n\nA: Reallocated sectors frequently (but not always) appear when a hard drive stars to fail. Just a few back-of-the-envelope calculations here:\nIf you bought your computer in the beginning of 2008 and used it 24 hours a day, you'd have used about 32,000 hours of hard drive time. I don't know what model of hard drive your computer has, but the mean time between failures for not-pariticularly-impressive hard drives from that era is about 300,000 hours. So in the heaviest-use scenario, you've used your hard drive for about 10% of its expected life.\nI don't think there's anything strange about a lack of failed sectors at this point.\n\nA: Typically, I don't see any relocated sectors for years, then dozens appear at the same time when the disk is about to fail.\nI tend to demote disks to being used as backup devices or file transfer disks in an external enclosure after 3 years of active use because that's around the time I find they usually start to fail.\n", "Q: share purchased movies with friends Sometimes when I visit friends and don't have my Mac around I still would like to watch some of the movies I purchased on iTunes together with them. How do I do this? Can I share movies with others just as I can share Apps?\n\nA: You can authorize up to five computers to use your iTunes account. If you have not used all five computers and you trust these friends, you could authorize their computer on your account, watch your movie, and then de-authorize the computer.\n\nA: Yes, you can.\nEven if your friend's computers are authorized they would still need your password to purchase movies.\nIf you have used all of your 5 authorized computers you will have to either remove them from each individual computer via iTunes:\n\nOr, log into your account and deauthorize all the computers at once:\n\n", "Q: Ecler NUO 2 mixer connected to MacBook Pro? I have maybe a silly question here.

You need to buy Scratch Live, two or more of their special LPs (one for each deck) and then a special box like the Rane SL 2 for Scratch Live that sits between your mixer's mains output and your computer. This box converts the analog signal from the mixer (which, with the special Scratch Live LPs is not something you should try to listen to -- it's not human-friendly and can damage your speakers and hearing) in to a digital signal that Scratch Live uses to match the playback of audio on the computer, to the rotation of the LPs on your decks.\n", "Q: Is it possible to connect iTunes playlists to folders? Is it possible to connect iTunes playlists to folders so that playlists update automatically when I add new song to a folder?\n\nA: Yes, but you don't do it within iTunes. If you want the song files you drop into a particular folder to automatically be added to an iTunes playlist, you use Automator to create a folder action like this one:\n\nYou start Automator, and create a Folder Action. You select the folder you want as the source of files.\nThen, the action is \"Import Files into iTunes\" at which point you select the playlist to which you want the songs added. Then you save the Folder Action.\n", "Q: Where are Automator's \"Watch Me Do\" files saved? Where are Automator's \"Watch Me Do\" files being saved?\n\nA: They appear to be part of the workflow, which means they would be saved wherever the workflow file is saved.

I hear a lot about the good aspects of using Time Machine, particularly the fact that it's so easy to use that people actually do backups!\nWhat are the downsides to using Time Machine compared to other contemporary backup programs? My particular interest is the disadvantages of using it in a (semi)-managed environment i.e. at a university.\n\nA: One substantial downside to Time Machine is that unlike clones produced with CarbonCopyCloner or SuperDuper, the backups it produces are not bootable.\nDisclosure: I have no affiliation with any software company, but for one term in college, I was roommates with the author of CarbonCopyCloner.\n\nA: In addition to the other downsides noted:\n\n\n*\n\n*System performance is significantly degraded while preparing and running a backup.\n\n\n(To mitigate this I generally avoid mounting my backup drive whenever I have a performance-critical process running.)\n\nA: I would like to add some more points here as a drawback of Time Machine:-\n\n\n*\n\n*Time Machine doesn't give you much control for backup data:-  You can tell Time Machine to ignore particular files or folders by adding them to its Do Not Back Up list,\nBut, you can’t exclude files based on certain criteria e.g  all movie files over 2GB in size.\n\n*It Doesn't compress files:-  It doesn’t store duplicate copies of identical files, so it doesn’t compress your files.\n\n*Not compatible with FileVault:- Time Machine backs up FileVault-encrypted user folders only after logged out session—and does not permit file-by-file restoration of your FileVault.\n\nA: I agree with your comment that the main advantage of time machine is that it is easy to use and is low maintenance, so users will actually have backups. It works well for incremental backups, but may not provide a permanent archival snapshot of a system on an old date.  The reason for this is that it prioritizes recent changes over older data if backup space is limited. The recommended solution is to have a Time Machine drive be several times larger than the sum of the volumes that it is backing up, but this is not always feasible, so it is good to have a secondary mechanism for occasionally archiving critical data. \nTime Machine will make it easy for users to recover data, from a local backup,  that they recently lost on their boot drive, without the need for I.T. personnel intervention. Without Time Machine this problem typically goes unaddressed and users just suffer in silence. As an I.T. manager you will probably be called upon to assist in storage and recovery of archival data, or may need centralized management tools not provided by Time Machine. So my feeling is that Time Machine would be a great addition, one that would make your Mac users very grateful, but it won't supplant your need for other archival or recovery tools. \n\nA: Here are some of the limitations you have to accept or mitigate if you choose Time Machine:\n\n\n*\n\n*Time machine requires an apple specific HFS+ filesystem to store backups.\n\n*The backup isn't bootable.\n\n*The backup doesn't record differences inside a file. Large (database) files with tiny changes make each incremental save longer and move more data. This also can eat up storage space faster if these type files are not excluded and potentially backed up another way if they can't be regenerated after a restore (like mail stored on IMAP servers)\n\n*It must be an external drive or an official apple network destination like TimeCapsule or Mac OS X Server to be a supported by Apple. \n\n*It will delete backups according to the official scheule ( hourly backups combine and expire after a day. Dailies expire after 31 days. Weekly backups can be deleted if there isn't enough space to contain the estimated size of the next backup.  In odd cases or if there is a bug, you could end up with all the history gone an one copy of the last backup. \n\n*The destination volume must be larger in size than the boot volume. \nOnce you are aware of these limitations, it's fairly easy to work around all but the first limitation with some planning and/or extra software / hardware. The HFS+ format for storage is pretty inflexible with no realistic mitigation or workarounds. \n\nA: Another thing worth mentioning, rather than which backup application to use, is the entire strategy behind your backup plan and the physical issue: If both your computer and the external drive with Time Machine are in the same location, and the building burns down, you lose both of them, and all your data. So people who are paranoid in a good way would back this up further with a cloud-based solution for backing up a sub-set of their critical data off site (say over the Internet using Carbonite, Mozy, and/or iCloud), or they would have multiple physical hard drives or tape backup systems and they would physically move a backup volume to a remote location (in another building, in another part of town) on a regular basis. Not everybody needs this extra security, but it's worth considering in the larger question.\n\nA: I'll add my answer from my own experience. With time machine:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can only really backup to one location automatically, be it USB or network, and to backup to two or more locations requires fiddling around in either System preferences each time or with complicated stuff on the command line\n\n*Network linked TM locations e.g time capsules use broadcast protocols to negotiate the connnection, which doesn't scale well on large networks\n\n*For the above reason you can't trivially backup to a network location in a different subnet - which ties in with one of the other comments needing to backup offsite\n\n*You can't change backup schedules easily\n\n*You can't easily anticipate what old backups TM will delete - I've been burned a few times by TM deleting my backup history when I've accidentally included too many files\n\n*It's not trivial to offer large amounts of TM backup space to end users. I'd like to allocate say 8TB for users to do TM backups but what should I use to do that? A mac-mini with a drobo attached??\n\n*It takes a bit of effort to move TM backups between media, e.g Upgrade time machine storage?\n\n*No deduplication, but that may be asking a bit much.  \nIn my work environment we use Commvault Simpana to backup our servers and some desktops. We are able to backup offsite and onsite simultaneously to multiple locations and media, on a schedule we choose. Commvault is a difficult to set up, expensive backup suite so I'm not making a direct comparison here, but it's interesting to explore nonetheless what other backup software offers that TM doesn't. Please feel free contradict anything I've said above with examples, as I'd love to be able to get around some of these issues I've outlined.\n\nA: Time Machine was evil to me.  It did not properly prompt me how to deal with the file vault situation.  I am forever drag and drop and carbonite.  Note:  Carbonite does not store pictures and videos in the big format you may have them in so if you want your FULL DATA of your photos (bigger files with more detail) then you need to drag and drop them to an external hard drive and let carbonite deal with all the smaller files.  Carbonite does not turn your file vault data into encrypted data that you may NEVER have back again and it is LOST FOREVER!!!  Carbonite saves it (even while file vault is running) as perfect just the way you see it except as I said before larger files such as photos and videos.  \nI hope you all stay away from Time Machine if you have precious data and forget when you had file vault on or off.  There are no prompters like a window popping up saying \"Please before doing this time machine back up turn off your file vault, log out of your computer and log back in and THEN run the time machine\".  That would be a very simple window to have pop up don't you think?\n", "Q: How can I add signatures to Preview.app in Lion without using the web cam? Is it possible to add a signature e.g. from PDF files or from JPEG images instead of using a web cam? The problem is that I don't have a web cam and I would like to use this feature in spite of that.\n\nA: It appears that at present, that isn't an option. When I created a signature file using the FaceTime camera, I see that first of all, there is no unencrypted graphic file created by Preview. Preview did a new key in Keychain titled \"Preview signature privacy\", suggesting that the signature files go directly from Preview's camera interface to an encrypted file. There isn't a supported way to add a graphic as a signature, and the encryption makes it difficult to bypass the approved new signature process.\n", "Q: Which standalone player or system plugin works well for WMV media on Mac OS X? I want to be able to play a WMV file on my Mac, but can't decide which plugin/software to install.  In particular, I need something that will interface with Adobe Acrobat reader, as Adobe currently do not have a media player plug-in that supports the file format.  Essentially, I have created a beamer presentation using LaTeX that contains an embedded WMV file.\nIn the original post, I mentioned that my options were Flip4Mac, Xvid or VLC.  Since then, perian has also been suggested.  Having decided on Flip4Mac, I discovered that while it does function according to specification, it does not interface with Adobe Acrobat reader.  Adobe, however, do suggest visiting the Apple web site for QuickTime....hence my reason for installing Flip4Mac!!!!\nOne caveat of Flip4Mac is that it cannot play WMV videos that use Windows Media digital rights management, so some videos may not be viewable even though Flip4Mac is installed.\nAn Xvid quicktime plugin available for Mac but is not well maintained at the moment, according to the Xvid FAQ. The developers, however, are currently working on improved Quicktime support, which will become part of the Xvid core code base.  How good/bad is it?\nVLC seems to be the popular choice, however, does it include a plugin to Quicktime, or is this a stand-alone product?\nPerian, on the other hand, can be used with all QuickTime supporting apps like QuickTime Player, NicePlayer and QTAmateur, however, it does not support all formats.\nAlso, would downloading them from the MacPorts Project suit my purpose, or would downloading the latest versions from their respective home pages be better?  Note that this is more a question of compatibility than anything else.  Also note that I am running Mac OS X Version 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard).\nAny advice/suggestions/feedback would be appreciated.\n\nJust to let you know that I posted a similar question to the Adobe forum.  This is the reply that I received:\nPutting it bluntly, you shouldn't be embedding WMVs in PDF files anymore -\nit's called \"legacy media\" and it's been discontinued for security reasons.\nYou can't author it in Acrobat X, and playback is disabled in all current\nversions of Acrobat and Adobe Reader unless the user changes their security\noptions. Authors should be using Rich Media annotations, which embed FLV or\nH.264 video and play cross-platform via an internal copy of Flash Player.\n\nThe weblink fired by Reader when it encounters legacy media for which the OS has\nno registered handler understands that you're on a Mac - and as there are no\nprimary players for WMV files on OS X, that's what it tells you. Adobe does not\nlink to third-party add-ons for other software, and even with those installed it\nwill continue to complain unless the add-on has changed the file type\nassociations, so that WMV files +automatically+ open in Quicktime.\n\nIn view of this reply, it's clear that I cannot view WMV files embedded in PDF files, no matter what third party software I have installed under Mac OS.  Nevertheless, I appreciate the feedback that I received from each of you.  While VLC seems like the most attractive alternative, the reason I chose flip4mac is because I do not wish to clutter my system with duplicate/redundant media players.  While this solves my problem of being able to play WMV files under Mac OS, it does not solve my original problem concerning Adobe Acrobat Reader.  It seems like I will have to use Rich Media annotations to do this.\n\nProblem solved!  I ended up converting the WMV file to MP4 (a format that Adobe Flash Player and QuickTime understands).  This allowed me to play the media file embedded in the PDF document.  For the complete story, have a look at the TeX-LaTeX.SE group.\n\nA: I've tried them all flip4mac, perian... trust me, VLC is your simplest and most efficient solution. It handles almost every single video type known, including WMV. Perian with Quicktime would come a good second, but still doesn't beat VLC as it doesn't have VLC's codec coverage. So that would most definitely be the best solution.\nBut is there any specific reason you're looking for a quicktime based solution? If only \"playing\" a video, is your primary requirement, VLC takes care of that (and pretty darn well i might add).\nCheers.\n\n(I've written a post on my blog covering most of the \"good\" software that I use. You're welcome to check it out. VLC was my final vote there. Excuse the shameless self promotion. Ignore if offended)\n\nA: I havent seen any videos with Microsoft DRM in a while. Most people I know go with flip4mac and perian so you can play most things without opening a secondary player.\n\nA: I normally use \"Mplayer OSX Extended\" for all my Video Files. I think WMV will also work just fine with it. But I think it wont't play DRM WMV either.\n\nA: M Player is a great media free player for all kinds of formats. VLC is another good alternative.\n", "Q: When I delete \"Watch Me Do\" from Automator, does it get deleted forever? Is Automator's \"Watch Me Do\" action permanently deleted when it is removed from the action sequence?\n\nA: If you are referring to the changes you made being deleted (i.e., the stuff it watched you do), I expect it is permanently deleted.\nThe action itself (in the source list) oughtn't ever be deleted.\n", "Q: Is it possible to clear Automator logs? How do I clear Automator logs?\n\nA: Go to ~/Library/Logs/ find the log file, and delete it. Or, if there isn't a log file for Automator there, go to /Library/Logs and find the file there.\n", "Q: How to switch between mail and safari on iPad 2? When reading email using mail, I always click on a link and it open in safari. But when I want to go back to mail, I need to press the button and then find email. Is there a better way to seamlessly switch back to mail, with a gesture or something?\n\nA: As far as I know there isn't a gesture: but you don't have to find email again. If you double click on the button the lower bar will show all the (open) applications in order of recent usage. Mail should be the first one.\n\nA: You can use multi-touch gestures to swipe to the last app you used, in this case will be mail.\nFirst make sure Multi-Touch gestures are turned on in the settings panel.\nOnce this feature is on, you can swipe from right to left with four fingers or more to cycle through the apps you last used.\nIf you do not want to use that, you can double tap the home button top bring up the last few apps used.\n", "Q: Arrange by exact file type (not just by kind) in OS X Lion Currently .mp3, .aac, .m4r, etc. are all looked as \"Music\". So when I do an Arrange or Group By in the Lion Finder, all of these files get displayed under the heading \"Music\". Is there an option to make this arrange by Kind setting respect the exact file type?\n\nA: It sounds like you want to \"sort\" your files rather than \"arrange\" them.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Finder open up the folder you would like to sort by kind (file type).\n\n*Click the Action button (gear icon).\n\n*Choose Show View Options.\n\n*Set Arrange By to None.\n\n*Set Sort By to Kind.\n\n\nYour files can be sorted more specifically now.

It provides me with the menu item to sort by when I would like :)\nSo, in this case, I right click in the folder, hold down the 'alt' key, choose Sort By, and choose Kind.\nI hope this helps :)\n\nA: Open the folder in a new window, then search for the format: for instance .mp3. Make sure the search is only for the folder you have open. \nThere you should find all of the mp3-files contained in that particular folder.\n\nA: When in column view, select the folder you want sorted, but no files in the folder.

I am afraid that if I plug the iPhone to my computer it will sync the other way around and delete whatever I had stored as a back up on my computer…\nAny of you know how to get those contacts back on the phone?\nThanks!!!\n\nA: If you have sync'd your iPhone very recently, but just before the disappearance of the contacts, then you should be ok.  The first part of each iTunes sync process is a backup.\nI would make sure the Address Book data in the Mac is backed up. I would then connect the iPhone, open iTunes, and sync.\nIf still no joy, then restore (an option in iTunes) the iPhone from an earlier backup to get them back, and then update the apps as needed.\nIf your iPhone is jail-broken or otherwise hacked, don't try the above until you have proven beyond a doubt that no haerm will be done.\n", "Q: How can I show a slideshow of pictures in multiple subfolders while keeping them in order?

I'm open to other tools is there's something reasonably priced.\n\nA: While iPhoto may work for some, it doesn't come bundled with every Mac and it's not free. It also relies on a library.\nThe quickest, cheapest (free) and easiest way to view/slideshow a folder and its subfolders is using Sequential. Just drag it to your Applications folder, run it once so it shows up on your Open with menu, right click on a folder, choose Open with > Sequential and hit the 5 key (for a 5 second slideshow).\nCheck its preferences if you want it to always start in full screen and its menus for aditional hotkeys (show thumbnails bar or skip to previous/next subfolder, for example). Besides supporting images, it also supports PDFs and archives (.zip, .cbz, .rar, .cbr) and you can choose to display them sequentially (folder's default order) or randomly.\n\nA: Does iPhoto not let you do this?

These volumes are real: drag files to your SFTP server, save a small graphic to your Amazon S3 bucket directly from Photoshop, or roll your own iDisk-like backup volume. It's all possible in T4.\n\n\nA: No you can't get around the read-only access, but here are some great FTP clients:\nCyberduck\nA great free FTP client. This is my go-to application. Anytime I need FTP access, I use Cyberduck. It's not quite as lightweight as Fugu, but it adds a lot more functionality than Fugu. I like the Growl integration with Cyberduck.\n\nFugu\nAwesome little free FTP client. As I noted above, this is a lightweight FTP client. It is great for simple FTP transfers and browsing. I do like the dual panel navigation.\n\nLast, but not least, you can use the CLI. Just type ftp username@foo.com at the prompt. If you've used the command line before, you know that ls lists directories, cd changes directories. Example: ls ~/Desktop lists the contents of your Desktop (the \"~\" is a shortcut for your home folder). cd ~/Desktop changes to current directory to your Desktop. To download files, you can use mget or get. Here's the Apple man page on FTP.\n\nA: No, but you can use any one of many third-party FTP clients, some of which are free.\nFileZilla.

In non-full screen mode your iPhone shows up in the left side bar under the 'Devices' area. In full screen mode there is no left side bar. I tried File -> Import to Library... but there's no iPhone listed in the Finder window that opens up.\nHow do you import photos from your iPhone when iPhoto is running in full screen mode on Lion?\n\nA: Use iCloud’s Photo Stream feature. As you noticed, you can’t access an iOS camera device connected via USB from iPhoto in full screen mode (in fact, iPhoto will leave full screen mode when you connect such a device). Photo Stream however is available in full screen mode (in the “All Albums” section). You can even setup iPhoto to automatically import photos from Photo Stream (sorry for the German screenshot, but you’ll get the idea).\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to check whether an app explicitly supports Resume or not? Is there any way to check whether an app explicitly supports Lion's new Resume feature or not? For example, as of right now, Safari supports Resume, meaning all the tabs are reopened, however in Google Chrome, this is not the case.\n\nA: Most \"Lion-Ready\" apps will also support the new full-screen mode, so if you see the little full screen button, it is likely the application will also support Resume. However, there is no definitive list that I am aware of yet, nor is there a way (beyond a mention in the app's documentation) of knowing whether it will support Resume.\nHowever, there is now a list of \"Enhanced for Lion\" apps on the appstore which might be a good place to start.\n\nA: Activity monitor has a column with yes/no for apps that support sudden termination which should be a good proxy for resume functionality. \n\nA: The combination of bmike & lemonginger's answers may be better than either one alone.\nbmike is referring to a developer API that was added in Mac OS 10.6 (and therefore may not be a perfect proxy for the full resume support). \nFrom Apple's developer documentation:\n\nMac OS X v10.6 includes a new mechanism that allows the system to log\n  out or shut down more quickly by, whenever possible, killing\n  applications instead of requesting that they quit themselves.\n\n(You may need a developer account to view this document. I'm not sure.)\nHe suggests it because support for \"sudden termination\" is a prerequisite for Lion resume support. As bmike suggests this makes it a reasonable proxy for support even if it is not a guarantee of support.\nleonginger's is basically suggesting that an application that has been updated in any way for Lion is more likely to include resume support. This is a faulty assumption on its own but becomes more powerful when combined with bmike's suggestion.\nLogic: if an application has obvious signs of having been updated for Lion (such as fullscreen support) AND the application has support for sudden termination the chances are quite high that that application supports resume.\n\nA: The new (in 10.7) NSWindowRestoration protocol is the entry point for restoring windows.  Due to Objective-C's dynamic nature, it won't be a perfect test, but there's probably a very good correlation between an application containing a reference to this symbol, and that application supporting Resume.\n$ grep NSWindowRestoration \"/Applications/QuickTime Player.app/Contents/MacOS/QuickTime Player\"\nBinary file /Applications/QuickTime Player.app/Contents/MacOS/QuickTime Player matches\n$ grep NSWindowRestoration \"/Applications/Photo Booth.app/Contents/MacOS/Photo Booth\" \n$ \n\nIf this symbol is present, it means the programmer at some point in the program at least mentioned the name of the new API which is only used for Lion Resume.  This isn't a guarantee of anything (it could even be a string that says \"I don't support NSWindowRestoration yet, sorry\"!), but it's good circumstantial evidence.\n\nA: open the app, open a generic new file and hit command+Q. then relaunch the app. does it re-open the previous file? then if it's been updated in the last 2 months it supports lion's resume. \n\nA: In short, it appears that most document-based apps will work with Resume, and non-document-based apps (such as web browsers and terminals) probably (or at least possibly) will not work with Resume.\nEven old apps such as Photoshop CS4 and Word 2008 will have their documents reopened with Resume in Lion. Apps such as Safari and Terminal indicate that non-document-based apps can be developed to explicitly use features of Resume.\nI've tried a variety of document-based apps, old and new, and they've all worked with Resume to have their documents reopened. I've also tried Chrome, Firefox, Opera and iTerm2, and none of them work with Resume.\n", "Q: App that turns the menubar black/dark? Is there an app that can change the color of the menubar?

You can close your System Preferences because the Quit command in Adium has been remapped to a less-likely-to-be-accidentally-typed shortcut.\n", "Q: How do I prevent iPhoto from opening every time I plug in my iPhone \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I prevent iPhoto to open everytime I plug my iPad? \n\nEvery time I plug in my iPhone to my MacBook Air iPhoto pops open, how do I make it stop?\n\nA: You might want to look at this question: How can I prevent iPhoto from opening everytime I plug my iPad/iPhone?\nThe summary is that Image Capture has an option to change what happens when a camera is attached to the computer.\n", "Q: Why isn't iPhone Mail working right with Google Apps Email? I am having a big problem with my iPhone's Mail App. For some reason, emails are not going to my iPhone. I have all of my settings right and I have IMAP on in settings and this still keeps popping up: \n\nI followed all of the steps on this page for Google Apps users and nothing will work, this used to work and all of a sudden it quit working. I have a lot of emails that are coming to my email account online but my iPhone mail hasn't been working for a while now. (hence the last update at the bottom in my screenshot above, 9/5/11)\nDoes anyone know what would cause this? \n\nA: Have you tried removing the account and then adding it again? (This may help if some setting has become corrupted. doing so will force iOS to start a \"fresh slate\" for the account.) \n", "Q: Quicksilver will not open on my Mac (OS 10.6). Can you help? I installed Quicksilver and due to some problems I have with the \"shelf\" feature I decided to uninstall it (using appCleaner). \nWhen I tried to install it again the application wouldn't install the second time and it gave me this option\n\n\"The previous version of Quicksilver was located in \"Quicksilver 3\".\n  Would you like to move this new version to that location?\"\n\nI clicked \"OK\" and the QS logo came up but disappeared within seconds.\nThere is no file on my computer with the word \"quicksilver\"\nIs there anything you can recommend I do?\nI am new to the Mac (got it only 2 day ago).\n\nA: Here is the excerpt from Quicksilver's User Manual that should deal with your problem (note the \"~\" denotes your user account home directory):\nThe Quicksilver.app is usually in /Applications/ or ~/Applications/. When first used, the following per user files and folders are created:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/Application Support/Quicksilver/\n\n*Actions.plist - list of installed actions\n\n*Catalog.plist - the configured catalog sources\n\n*Mnemonics.plist - learned inputs, defaults and abbreviations\n\n*PlugIns.plist - the list of available plug-ins and how they are configured\n\n*Triggers.plist - the configured triggers\n\n*Caches/ - another cache folder\n\n*Indexes/ - folder of indexed items\n\n*PlugIns/ - installed plug-ins\n\n*Shelves/ - where items on the Shelf and clipboards are stored\n\n*Actions/ - not installed but create this folder to add scripts that implement actions\n\n*Templates/ - not installed but create this folder to use with the Make New... action\n\n*~/Library/Preferences/com.blacktree.Quicksilver.plist - stores various preferences and internal state\n\n*~/Library/Caches/Quicksilver/ - stores various state in binary files\n\n\nTo do a complete uninstall use the Uninstall Quicksilver button in the Application preferences, or remove the above files and folders.\nIt can also be useful to move or rename these while trouble-shooting a problem. If you are having trouble installing plug-ins check that the owner of ~/Library/Application Support/Quicksilver/ is the current user and not System. If it’s not, change it and restart Quicksilver.\n\nA: Quicksilver is activated by a hotkey. That's why the logo appeared then disappeared. I believe the default shortcut is Option + Space\n", "Q: is there an application to manage bookmarks? I hate the in-built book mark managers of all browsers, it quickly becomes too messy and important links are hard to find\nIs there desktop application which deal with bookmarks? something that has multiple options of fitters: categories, folders, tags and more \nFor example the task manager, omnifocus, is as simple or as complex as you want it to be, is there anything like that for bookmarks\n\nA: Take a look at Xmarks. It stores the bookmarks on an Xmarks-server, so they are available from everywhere. It's compatible with Safari, IE, Firefox and Chrome.\n\nA: In addition to the other answers posted here, I suggest looking at a few different online bookmarking sites:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://diigo.com\n\n*http://pinboard.in\n\n*(and yes) Delicious.com \n\n\nMost of these services have add-ons or extensions to access the bookmarks. :)\n(I really like diigo.com)\n\nA: Try URL Manager Pro. It's been around for a very long time, and is still under active development. It has received excellent reviews. It's Lion-compatible, and is also available in the Mac App Store.\n\nA: I created a different kind of bookmarking app for Mac: http://fetching.io\nIn addition to all the bookmarking features, it saves a full copy of every web page you visit then let's you easily search your index to re-find pages later. It' a totally different way of doing things. You don't have to remember to save anything since everything is saved and super easy to find later, even months or years later. \n", "Q: Where can I find a list of bugs in the current release of OS X? I thought perhaps this question would be a list of bugs, but it's been closed.\nIs there another place out there where I can find this info? And when I say the current release I mean whichever release is current at the time that you're looking for the information.\n\nA: Certainly Apple does not provide such info and I have never seen any place which systematically compiles user complaints into that kind of list.  So as far as I know, the answer is \"no\".\n\nA: As far as I know apple does not publish that information until they implement a fix in an update. At that point they publish what the bug is and how the update plans on fixing the bug. \nIf Apple published a list of their bugs in the OS, hackers could take advantage of the bug. Only in rare cases are bugs published, but never by OS suppliers. The bugs are published by security firms when the bug is so dangerous the public needs to know of its existence to avoid being hacked.\nMost issues with mac are not bugs in the OS but problems due to slight differences between the OS X series. This issue is especially noticeable when compiling code from MacPorts. \n", "Q: Problem booting from a DVD: How do I eject the DVD? I tried to install Windows 7 on Bootcamp, but the Windows 7 boot CD has a boot problem about code 5.\nThe Windows 7 installation DVD is in the DVD driver.

I want to record an application window for a demo/tutorial, and I'd like the video to be a particular resolution.\nIs there a trick/tool already installed in Lion that allows me to take a window and resize it to a specific resolution? For instance, take a window and resize it to 1280x720 in preparation for a HD 720p video recording?\nIf not, is there a tool I can get from the internet that will do this for me?\nIt just occured to me that perhaps Automator would help me here, but I'm not able to find an action to resize a window. An Automator script is OK as well.\nBasically, any free/cheap tool/trick/script that would do this.\n\nA: You could try an AppleScript like this:\n  set the_application to (path to frontmost application as Unicode text)\n\n  tell application the_application\n      activate\n      set bounds of window 1 to {1, 1, 1281, 721}\n  end tell\n\n", "Q: Why can't I download the latest Boot Camp installer when first configuring Boot Camp? I have a white Macbook that is released near the end of 2007, with an Intel Core 2 Duo.  And now that I want to try installing Windows XP or Windows 7 on it to see how robust it is running Windows, with Boot Camp Assistant, it tried to \"download files needed\" but it always says \"The Windows Support Software is not available\"\n\nwithout any further info. This Macbook is running Snow Leopard already. Is there a way to complete the process of installing Windows 7 using Boot Camp?\n\nA: You should be able to select the option \"I have already downloaded...\" this will let you continue with the Boot Camp partitions and then install Windows from the disc. \nYou should install Boot Camp within Windows from your Snow Leopard Install CD and then you can update Boot Camp by downloading the Updates from support.apple.com.\nI had this issue with my Mid-2010 MacBook Pro at first.\n\nA: My best guess is that Apple dropped support for Boot Camp downloads under Snow Leopard.\nMy advice is to upgrade to Mountain Lion (or install it in a external drive) and try to download the Bootcamp-provided Windows Drivers from Mountain Lion's Boot Camp Assistant.\n", "Q: An iOS GPS application that shows satellite locations and lock-on details? I'm a big fan of Kinetic and use it track my bike rides as well as map the local trails. Lately it's been giving me some grief though and telling me I have a weak GPS signal at the outset of rides. It shows a bar for the signal strength and it's definitely below the 50% mark.\nUnfortunately that's all it shows.\nOn my old GPS unit I used to be able to see which satellites were in range of the unit and which ones the unit was locked on to for positioning information at any point in time.\nIs there an iPhone app that'll let me see similar information? I'd like to see if it's local interference that's suddenly getting in the way or if it's Kinetic that's the problem.\n\nA: In general, on iOS it's not possible to display detailed satellite information. As noted in mspasov's answer, the CoreLocation API doesn't give access to GPS specifics.\nA complicating factor is that most of the time, your iPhone doesn't use GPS to find its position. Instead it uses the locations of nearby wifi networks and cell phone towers. Those methods are generally more accurate and quicker than using the GPS chip, and in cities you may never see the GPS activate. I don't believe an iOS program can even find out which source of location it gets at the moment, although you can make a good guess based on the reported accuracy.\nThere are external GPS receivers for iOS devices that can generate more accurate fixes. Bad Elf, for example, has a developer list and in the past has said they intend to make an API available to access more detailed GPS info.\n\nA: There is no such interface available for iOS, since everything is enclosed within the CoreLocation framework (no way to access NMEA data).\nYou can monitor some variables (like horizontalAccuracy, verticalAccuracy) but that's it. The easiest way to obtain this information is to run some GPS application that displays this information, such as \"GPS Status-\".\n(Be aware of multiple apps with very similar 'GPS Status' names are not all identical.\nAt the time of this edit, \"GPS Status-\" by Fawkes Wei is much more positively reviewed and kept up to date (last update 25 May 2019) than the \"GPS Status\" by PocketGPSWorld.com Ltd (last update 5 June 2011).)\n", "Q: rEFIt menu takes around 10 seconds to even show up I'm using a macbook pro 8,1. I've installed rEFIt so that I can dual boot with Ubuntu. This is all \"working\" except that each time I turn on my laptop, it takes ten or fifteen seconds to even get to the rEFIt menu for me to select an OS.\nAt this point, I have done nothing special except to make Ubuntu the default OS and reduce the wait time in the rEFIt menu from 20 to 5 seconds.\nHow can I reduce this lag between startup and OS selection?\n\nA: Assuming you have rEFIt installed on one of the partitions on the hard drive, the following steps should remove the delay:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot via the Mac OS X Install DVD/USB.\n\n*Launch Terminal (Utilities Menu).\n\n*Enter diskutil list to list all available disks and partitions.\n\n*Looking at the list of partitions for \"disk0\" (internal drive), identify the partition that contains your rEFIt boot files.\n\n*Enter bless --setBoot --device /dev/disk0s2 --legacy assuming that \"/dev/disk0s2\" was the rEFIt partition.\n\n*Enter reboot to reboot your Mac\n\n\nYour Mac should now boot to rEFIt with a minimal delay.\nThe same method also works with Windows 7 direct booting (Boot Camp) which can present an extremely long boot delay on MacBook Airs and Minis if Windows 7 is your startup disk and the above steps have not been taken.\n", "Q: Git missing after OSX migration \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhy is Git not found after installing OS X Lion? \n\nI've recently migrated from an old mac pro with leopard to a new mac pro with snow leopard, everything seems to have gone right so far during the migration process, however I cannot initialize git anymore, my git repos still exist and I can seem the .git folder for my projects but in terminal git init doesn't work anymore and I get a not found error when trying git --version\nHow do I fix this, do i need to reinstall git, would this effect my existing repos?\n\nA: Best Guess - your path variable got re-written.\nFrom the the terminal enter: sudo find / -name git\nYou should see every instance of git on your system. Assuming the git binary is located, make sure its directory is in your path, or instead of typing git init you could type /path/to/git (assumes git binary is ia /path/to).\nAlternatively, you could re-install git.

I have several PNG images I want to view as a single document in Preview, Lion OSX. \nUsually I just select several images and open them in Preview, but when I do that, I can't set the view to \"Continuous Scroll.\"\nThe default behavior for PNG images in Preview seems to be to zoom out after you flip a page, meaning I have to resize every page scroll down. That gets tedious.\nIs there a way to put these PNG images together in one, single Preview document so I can select \"Continuous Scroll\" as an option and don't have to resize each page?\n\nA: Ok, here's what you need to do:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Open up the first PNG image in Preview. Make sure the side bar is showing.\n\n\n*Open the second image in Preview, and from the sidebar, drag the thumbnail image from the second window to the first window's sidebar.\n\n\n*Now, you'll notice that the title bar says \"2 documents, 2 total pages.\" Continue dragging images into the first image until all the images are combined into one PNG. Make sure you save it. :-)  \n\nA: You can drag PNG files as pages into a single PDF file. If you pick one of your PNGs in Preview and export it as a PDF, you can then drag the proxy icons of the others into the left-hand page preview bar and they will be (nondestructively -- the originals are preserved) added to that file. I don't know if that will make your previewing easier or not, but it's an option.\n\nA: Ok, well this is way too obscure of an answer because a) it involves Terminal and b) it involves installing 3rd party software in Terminal.\nIf you install ImageMagick from the official site and then go into Terminal:\n\nmontage \"$F1\" \"$F2\" -tile 1x2 -geometry \"${TARGET_WIDTH}x${TARGET_HEIGHT}+1+1\" out.png\n\nwhere F1 and F2 are files, and \"TARGET_WIDTH\" is the widest of the files.\nThe file \"out.png\" should be a combination of F1 and F2… you should be able to add more \"F3\" and other files.\n", "Q: Where do I find the logs for OS X authentication attempts? I'm on a personal computer, with Lion running and only a single user account on the computer. Is there a log file for authentication attempts (both for login attempts and password protected screensaver aka sleep mode)?\nMostly interested in the unsuccessful attempts. Is it possible to also see the passwords that were used to make those unsuccessful attempts?\n\nA: It's found in the secure.log (the path is /var/log/secure.log) and the entries would look something like this:\nauthorizationhost[5917]: Failed to authenticate user <cksum> (error: 9).\n\nIt does not log password attempts (the password they tried to use), just the actual unsuccessful (or successful) login attempt.\nAdditionally, to focus your search exclusively for failed login attemps, open Terminal.app (found in Utilities folder) and run the following command: \nsudo grep 'Failed to authenticate' /var/log/secure.log\n\n", "Q: What is the safest way to triple boot Macbook Pro? I recently purchased a MBP 13.3 i5 system, and I'm keen on making it triple boot (Lion, Win7, Ubuntu 11.04). What is the safest way to do this ? I found quite a few websites online, but I'm not sure of whether they are entirely accurate/updated for Lion etc. \nI would really appreciate it if someone could post a link that has worked for Lion/Win7/Ubuntu 11.04.\nAlso, would this action invalidate the warranty of the MBP ?\n\nA: Lifehacker's guide to triple booting has worked well for me in the past. You will also definitely need refit. I've seen varying reports of how well refit works on Lion - it seems to be that if you don't have FileVault enabled, you should be fine. Obviously make sure to back everything up before starting - any sort of partitioning/boot loader editing/etc is always slightly risky.\nThe basic steps are: \n\n\n*\n\n*Install refit\n\n*Partition all the necessary partitions (OS X, Windows, Linux). Be careful at this step, it can be very difficult to resize partitions that aren't HFS+. You'll need three additional partitions: Windows, Linux, and Linux swap. \n\n*Install Windows, then install uBuntu. \n\n\n(Lastly, this does not invalidate the MBP's warrantee.)\n\nA: If you want to be really really safe and you don't mind a drop in hard drive I/O performance in Ubuntu, I'd recommend installing Windows normally with Boot Camp then in Windows installing Wubi: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/windows-installer. You can then boot into Ubuntu through the Windows bootloader.\n", "Q: How do I map a key on the A1048 109-key Keyboard to provide an \"FN\" button? I have an Apple A1048 109-key keyboard that I really like, except it does not have an FN button, which is a bit annoying.  Is there any way to remap one of the keys (I'm thinking the 'help' key) to function as an FN key?\n\nA: You will not be able to do this.  The controller in the keyboard sends a keycode to the OS whenever a key is pressed.  That keycode is unique to every key on the keyboard... except for the Fn key.\nThe Fn key, modifies other keys on the keyboard, as does Shift, Alt, Ctrl, Option, etc... the only difference is that each of the latter modifiers is recognized by the OS.  In other words, the keyboard controller tells the OS that \"shift\" was pressed, at the same time as the \"s\" key.  The OS then iterprets that to mean the user wants a capital letter \"s\" or \"S\".\nThis is not the case with the Fn key.  The fact that it is pressed is captured by the keyboard controller and a separate, unique, keycode is sent when you press the next key.  For instance F1 sends a keycode, lets call that keycode \"xyz\"   When Fn and F1 are pressed at the same time, a different keycode is sent to the OS.\nWhat you could do is discover what those keycodes are...the ones that are issued when you press Fn + F1-f13.  Then if you wern't using the function keys for their original purpose, you could map those to the new keycodes (the equivalent of pressing Fn+Fx) and go from there to get your volume keys and all the rest of the goodies that Apple hides up there.\nCheckout this article form Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fn_key\n\nAlternatively, the Keyboard settings pane of System Preferences will allow you switch whether you wanted a single keypress of any function key to send the keycode equivalent of Fn+Fx or simply Fx.   Perhaps you can use that checkbox to get what you want...  though I don't think it will work with your keyboard.  I think you need a newer keyboard to get this to work.\n\n\nA: Many articles online claim that Fn key is fundamentally different and there is no way to remap another key to Fn. I blindly believed them. It is not true.\nAt least on Mac, you can install Karabiner-Elements, the powerful keyboard customizer for macOS. You can remap the key you desire, such as help or F16, to Fn.\nNote: the help key on A1048 is actually a standard insert key. So choose insert in the From key dropdown menu, do not choose help. See attached picture below. Nonetheless, help is kind of a good name for a Fn modifier.\nFor A1048, the top right 4 keys: -vol, +vol, mute, eject, cannot be remapped. It seems Karabiner doesnot recognize these media keys (as in its Karabiner EventViewer).\nEnjoy the new key! I believe this also applies to other non-Apple PC keyboards.\n", "Q: Installing Windows 7 on Mac. A required CD/DVD drive device driver is missing I'm installing Windows 7 on my Mac via Parallels.  During installation I'm getting. \"A required CD/DVD drive device driver is missing.\" message. Doesn't give me any option to proceed further.  What am I doing wrong?\np.s. I hit same message using bootcamp.\nI'm using Macbook Pro OS X, Core i7. Trying to install Windows 7 Pro  64bit.\n\n\nA: Everyone seemed to think that re-burning the disk would fix the issue. It did for a lot of people. But I had a purchased copy that I didn't burn.\nThe fix for me was to let Windows boot up. You'll see the black screen with a progress bar where the windows installer starts up. Start tapping F8. You might have to hold Alt/Option while tapping. I tried both just to be sure the menu would pop up. Then select: Disable Driver Signature Enforcement.\nDoing that let me continue through the installer.\n\nA: This error commonly occurs when the Windows 7 DVD, or the ISO image used to create said DVD, is corrupted. I see this at work once every month or two so know it well.\nRe-download the Windows 7 ISO image to use with Parallels. Also re-burn the new ISO image to DVD if you still need a physical disc (for Boot Camp).\nIf this error occurs with a retail DVD try and ask for a replacement or check that your optical drive is in full working order (having tried using a CD/DVD lens cleaner on it first).\n\nA: You are using the USB flash drive option. Avoid booting from a USB flash drive; use a bootable DVD for installation and this will never happen again.\n\nA: I went through all the post, tried most of them and a lot of them were not making any sense. Unfortunately I cannot come up with the exact way I solved the issue but here is what I did.\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete your actual VM, it is no good.\n\n*Update your Parallels Desktop, I am working with 8.0.18608. \n\n*Create the VM using a brand new downloaded ISO for which I used a\ndownload manager (ex. Folx)\n\n*Recreate your VM, it workes just fine for me.\n\n\nHonestly I don't think the iso file is the problem. If I were you I would try with the one you have right now. After I updated my Parallels it wasn't working until I realized I was still trying to install with the VM I created with the previous version. When I deleted and created a new one it worked.\nSo if you are reading this, just update your Parallels, delete your VMs and start over, don't worry about configuration it didn't do anything good for me, IDE or SATA. Just make sure you start fresh.\nHope it helps, cause for me, none of the other posts helped.\nDominique\n\nA: Actually I have found out that this also occurs if you are using usb3.0 ports.  If you only have usb 3.0 ports you need to go into the bios and tell it to treat them as usb 2.0 ports in preboot\n\nA: There is an absolute solution this problem;\n\n\n*\n\n*Burn iso image to DVD, period. Because this error appears just with USB stick.\n\n*Want to use USB stick (like me) I know you won't believe me about my weird (odd) solution but it works :) Whenever I try to install Win7 from USB stick, this problem shows up. Then I examine USB stick's light. When error occured that light blink harmonic. I try to pull and push USB stick slowly and smoothly in its nest a couple times. When i see that light blink continuously then this error go away. Just pull and push very carefully.\n\n\nBefore that I tried USB stick to put another USB socket or other USB sticks but it didn't work because neither my USB sticks nor USB ports don't broken.\nFinally the last word is Windows in Bootcamp doesn't like USB sticks much :D\n", "Q: IP address changing too frequently My Macbook pro is connected to my router over the AirPort. The IP address it gets changes every few hours. Is there a way on the mac to request the same address.\nI do not have access to the router to configure it.\n\nA: Unfortunately this depends entirely on the configuration of the router. Perhaps the DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) server is configured with a very short lease time for clients, and a new IP address is assigned whenever a client has no network activity for only a short time.\nTo fix the problem you will need to ask the administrator of the router to lengthen the lease time, or consider creating a reserved IP address for your MacBook Pro. The means of doing that vary with the make and model of the router.\nAfter you have worked with the administrator to reserve an IP address, you will want to create a custom network profile on your MacBook Pro for use when you are connecting to that particular WiFi router, to disable DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol), and configure a static IP address.\nIf all of the above is not possible, perhaps someone could propose a means of writing a script on the Mac that would cause the Mac, every few minutes, to renew its IP address lease to the DHCP server that the WiFi router uses, in order that the IP address assigned by DHCP would not expire, and the DHCP server would not automatically assign a new IP address.\nTRY THIS TIP: Leave Apple Mail open all the time and configure it to automatically check for new mail every 60 seconds. This might be enough to keep your IP address renewed on the DHCP server of the WiFi router.\n\n", "Q: What are some good screencapturing applications? \nPossible Duplicates:\nCreating a professional looking screencast?\nRecommendations for video editing + screen capturing software\nCamtasia, Screenflow, or “Other?” \n\nWhat are some good screencapturing applications for OS X? I am specifically looking for an application that records in HD video. I have used QT Player X, but I'm wondering if there are some alternatives out there.\n\nA: I'm partial to Screenflow. It works well, it's easy to use, and it's good for both capturing the screen, capturing audio (or even video via FaceTime camera) of you narrating the screencast, and can handle mixing the different sources of input. At $99, it isn't cheap, but it does work well.

I'm looking to create a website on my Mac, with content coming from a database also on the Mac. The website is static, and I'll probably need to write some scripts that will periodically (1) create new HTML pages on my Mac based on new content in the database, (2) sync the HTML pages on my Mac to the web server on the Internet using SFTP.\nCan this be done using Bento, or should I be looking into Filemaker Pro instead?\n\nA: Bento isn't well-suited for your needs, in my opinion. It's possible to export information from Bento into a variety of formats, including text files, Numbers, or Excel. But it doesn't have the hooks needed to be queried by a Website creation tool. As you mention, FileMaker Pro does have that ability. Here is their web publishing page.\nThis may be overkill for you, but if you're familiar with SQL databases, you might also take a look at Sequel Pro.\n\nA: As far as I know, there would be no way for scripts to directly access the data in a Bento database, so you would need to manually export that data every time you need to update the website. If you don't have too many sets of data, or if the site doesn't need to be updated too frequently, this might work well for you.\nAlso, Bento is fairly limited when it comes to building relational databases. It can handle flat databases and very simple relationships, but lacks the ability to set up complex relationships between tables. If you don't need complex relationships, and manually exporting your data is acceptable, then Bento would be a viable option that's relatively inexpensive and fairly easy to learn and use.\nOn the other hand, FileMaker Pro is very scriptable, allowing for almost complete control through both its own internal scripting language as well as through AppleScript. It also handles much more complex relationships. Of course, this advanced feature set also comes with a higher learning curve (and price tag). However, FileMaker does have a large and active community of users that are very helpful, and there are plenty of tutorials and sample databases to help get you up to speed.\nWhile FileMaker does have built-in web publishing, there is a limit of 5 concurrent users unless you get FileMaker Server, or host your database on a 3rd party FileMaker hosting service.\n", "Q: Uncheck \"Reopen windows when logging back in\" by default The shutdown/restart dialog has a check-box Reopen windows when logging back in which is checked by default. I need to change its behavior to be unchecked by default. Is this possible? If yes, how can I do that?\n\n\nA: Edit: since 10.7.4, the \"Reopen windows when logging back in\" checkbox has stayed unchecked if you uncheck it once, so the hacks below are not needed anymore.\nOne option is to set the LoginwindowLaunchesRelaunchApps key to false in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist:\ndefaults write com.apple.loginwindow LoginwindowLaunchesRelaunchApps -bool false\n\nYou could also save this property list as ~/Library/LaunchAgents/logout_saves_state.plist:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC -//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\nhttp://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd>\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>logout_saves_state</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>defaults</string>\n        <string>write</string>\n        <string>com.apple.loginwindow</string>\n        <string>TALLogoutSavesState</string>\n        <string>-bool</string>\n        <string>false</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThen load the property list by running launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/logout_saves_state.plist or by logging out and back in once.\nTALLogoutSavesState sometimes got reset to true when I logged out and back in, so just running defaults write com.apple.loginwindow TALLogoutSavesState -bool false once wouldn't have worked.\nNeither of these options actually makes the checkbox appear unchecked, but they have the same effect.\n\nA: This bug has been fixed with the Lion update 10.7.4:\n\nThe OS X Lion v10.7.4 Update includes fixes that:\nResolve an issue in which the \"Reopen windows when logging back in\"\nsetting is always enabled.\n\n\n(click here for more information)\n\nA: For Mojave, none of the options above worked for me, however, someone else mentioned the following, and it's sufficient for me:\nClose all windows, except terminal, and run:\nchflags uimmutable $HOME/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow.*\n\nTerminal and Finder will now be the only apps which will open on reboot.\n\nA: No, it is always set to \"on.\" However there does exist a script you can run, that disables the feature. The box will still be checked, but the feature will no longer function:\nPaste the following into a single line within the Terminal:\ncurl http://goo.gl/Z4EFC -L -s -o ~/fixlogin.sh && chmod +x ~/fixlogin.sh && sudo ~/fixlogin.sh ; rm ~/fixlogin.sh\n\nThat command downloads a script, places it in the appropriate location, makes it executable, and then removes the temporary file. If you are wondering, the contents of the downloaded bash script are the following:\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"#!/bin/bash\" > /tmp/loginfix.sh\necho \"rm /Users/*/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow.*\" >> /tmp/loginfix.sh\nmv /tmp/loginfix.sh /usr/bin/loginfix.sh\nchmod +x /usr/bin/loginfix.sh\ndefaults write com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook /usr/bin/loginfix.sh\n\nIf you ever want to revert back to the default behavior of this OS X Lion feature, just type the following defaults write command:\nsudo defaults delete com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook\n\nAnd you’ll be back to be able to select window restore based on that checkbox’s choice.\nSource: http://osxdaily.com/\n\nA: This has changed in Mac OS X Update Version 10.7.4.\n\nResolve an issue where the \"Reopen windows when logging back in\" setting is always enabled.\n\n\nHere is the new option, as you can see (although it isn't proof in itself as it's easy to uncheck and then screen grab, but please trust me - I was pretty stoked when I checked out this update as this bug was really annoying me!)\n\n\nA: For the record, we’re talking about this:\n\nThe problem is that OS X doesn’t remember if you uncheck the checkbox on the last shutdown — it will always keep the checkbox checked by default on subsequent shutdowns.\nI found two different solutions for this problem, that seem to do the trick, although they aren’t ideal.\nOpen Terminal.app and enter the following commands:\ndefaults write com.apple.loginwindow TALLogoutSavesState -bool false\ndefaults write com.apple.loginwindow LoginwindowLaunchesRelaunchApps -bool false\n\nThis effectively disables the “reopen windows when logging back in” option, although the checkbox will still appear to be checked. You can just ignore it.\nI’m afraid there’s no better solution, at least not at the moment.\n\nIt’s possible to disable Resume on a per-app basis, too.\nThere’s also a system setting that allows you to disable it for all apps, system-wide. Go to System Preferences → General:\n\nAlternatively, you can run this command in Terminal.app:\n# Disable Resume system-wide\ndefaults write NSGlobalDomain NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool false\n\n(Taken from my .osx file.)\n\nA: Unchecking \"Reopen windows when logging back in\" did not resolve the problem for me. Apps were still reopening after restart from Apple Script, or with shutdown command in Terminal.\nPermanently prevent macOS High Sierra from reopening apps after a restart\nWorks in macOS El Capitan, Yosemite, Sierra, High Sierra.\nSolution: deny OS X access to the file it uses to store your session state.\nIt prevents reopening apps even after reboot/shutdown from Terminal, from AppleScript, and system crash.\nGUI method\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder\n\n*Cmd+Shift+G (Go to folder)\n\n*Copypaste ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/ and confirm\n\n*Find the file starting with com.apple.loginwindow\n\n*Doubleclick (opens in TextEdit)\n\n*Remove all content and save the empty file.

The file doesn’t exist.\nDid anybody else met this error before? (I tried googling, but I didn't find any solution).\n\nA: The problem with GUI editors is that when launched from the command-line, they generally do not halt the process in the shell. That's why when editing a property, svn will create the temporary file, launch the editor, and wait for the exit signal to read and delete the temporary file contents. Because the GUI editor returns the exit signal immediately upon launching, the file will no longer be there.\nSome GUI editors like TextMate and Sublime Text support a -w (wait) option from the command-line, forcing them to halt the SVN process until the file is closed. I am not aware of TextEdit supporting such an option.\nYou probably want to change your SVN editor to something more appropriate, like vim or nano. You can change the editor command in ~/.subversion/config\n\nA: As Gerry pointed out calling TextEdit directly will not work but you can use open:\nopen -e -W -n\n\nin your case\nexport SVN_EDITOR='open -e -W -n'\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-e opens with TextEdit (you can use -a to specify another application)\n\n*-W waits that the application exits\n\n*-n opens a new instance (so that you will not have to quit an eventually open TextEdit)\n\n", "Q: Lion login screen when using two screens When logging into Lion with a second screen attached, does the second screen always have a plain grey background as opposed to the textured background that the primary screen has?\nIs there a way to change the login wallpaper on only the second screen?\n\nA: I believe the answer is \"no\". You can select a custom desktop picture for Lion, but I know of no way to select different pictures for each screen.\n", "Q: Move all events from one iCal calendar to another I would like to consolidate several iCal calendars.  So, I'm wondering if there is a way to move all events from one iCal calendar to another.

You'll need to find someone with a copy of it (what Mac have you got?), then copy it back over somehow, probably by mounting the drive with another machine, then cross your fingers and hope OS X plays nice with it.

I noticed that many useful applications are unavailable in Russian App Store, as US Store seems to be the primary target for developers. I wonder if there is any legal way to obtain a US Store account (I'm interested in iPhone and Mac Apps, no music) if I don't live in the United States.\n\nA: I'm not sure if using a fake address would be legal. \nTechnically, you can create an account in the US Store using an iTunes Gift Card and a fake address/phone number. You can buy iTunes Gift Cards in eBay (some sellers will expedite things by sending activation codes by email).\nIf you're only interested in free Apps, you can create an account without the Gift card. There is an Apple support document describing the process. \nRegardless of payment, Apple asks for a valid US address to establish an account, so the legality of this depends on where you live. \n\nA: I have a US mailing address, and  US Bank information. With this, I can purchase through the app store when I'm overseas (which is quite often). These are linked to my Apple ID.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Restart OS X GUI I need to restart the WindowServer (OS X's GUI);\nI know this can be achieved using the command sudo killall -HUP WindowServer \nbut this closes all your open applications. Is there a way to restart the WindowsServer without it quitting all your open applications?\n\nA: The WindowServer is responsible for drawing all Windows and Windows Content for all Programs (incl. Finder), so it would not be possible to kill the Process without killing all Applications.\nYou can read about the Window Server in the Apple Technical Note TN2083 for OSX 10.5.\nEven though it is announced in that Document that Apple plans to change the Behaviour in future Systemversions, it's in your list of required OS's.\n\nA: There is no way to restart window server without closing all apps; logging out & then back in is the best option\n\nA: You can also try:\nkillall -KILL Dock\n\n\nA: killall Finder         # what should work\nkillall SystemUIServer # what to run in addition if it does not\n\nIf any of the two do not restart (finder sometimes does not automatically reboot in my experience), then run these commands after the initial set:\nopen -a Finder\nopen -a SystemUIServer\n\nThis set of commands (specifically killall Finder) is almost exactly like taskkill /IM explorer.exe within the MS-DOS command line.\n\nA: If this is to restart the GUI  without quitting all applications (to solve UI jitter, a duplicate mouse cursor, etc...)

I believe the Internet is filtered through Bluecoat, so I was wondering how to browse the Internet as it's trying to request my Active Directory username but the browser is not picking it up.\nI've had a look at the settings in Safari, but I just can't see anything about this.\n\nI tried using Authoxy but I still can't browse or go to the app store. I have no problems with Active Directory as I can log in and can see all the other computers and servers.\n\nA: Sounds like your proxy server requires NTLM authentication (this is a way in Windows where the logged in Windows session is used to transparently authenticate to the proxy). Authoxy supports this on OS X.\n", "Q: Is there a way of \"re-locking\" an internal FileVault 2 encrypted partition? As an alternative to using encrypted disk images, I created a FileVault 2 encrypted partition in Lion for some important data on the SSD in my MacBook Air. The password is not stored in a keychain. Once it is unlocked, I can unmount and mount it again without authenticating, even after logging out and back in again. Nothing short of restarting seems to lock this partition again. \nRe-locking an internal encrypted partition while logged in is possible in other implementations of whole-disk encryption, and for FileVault 2, according to the man page for diskutil, specifically, for the command diskutil coreStorage unlockVolume,\n\n\"This verb unlocks an LVF by providing that authentication; as the LVs are thus appear\n  as dev nodes, any file systems upon them are automatically mounted. To \"re-lock\" the\n  volume, make it offline again by ejecting it, e.g. with diskutil eject\"\n\nWhile this does work as it should with encrypted external drives, it does not seem to work on my encrypted internal partition. I can eject the logical volume, which is \n/dev/disk1, but it does not get locked. Trying to eject its containing Logical Volume Family, Physical Volume, or Logical Volume Group, results in errors, even using administrator privileges. I tried variations, using unmount, unmountDisk, referring to the device UUIDs, with no luck. What am I doing wrong here?\n\nA: Due to the limitations, you might want to use an encrypted disk image rather than whole disk encryption.\nCome to think of it - why not use both? \nYou could always turn off FileVault if you felt it too much a hassle, but to get around the limitation you caught (thank goodness you did catch it),  consider using Disk Utility to make secure the parts of your data you need to force into a locked state when that disk image is unmounted. This will let you sleep your mac and not compromise that data by allowing it to be re-mounted without the appropriate passcode being supplied.\n\nA: This is the response from Apple I got to my bug report: \n\nWe are aware of this issue.  It is being addressed, and we would like to thank you for taking the time to pass it along to us.\n\n\nA: The only problem I can think of with disk images which \"re-lockable\" internal partitions wouldn't have concerns Time Machine backups. Since FileVault 2 makes it possible to have an encrypted TM drive, it now makes sense to have secure data backed up and easily accessed from within Time Machine. For a disk image, this means backing up its contents rather than the image file itself. This requires various hacks and may not be possible in Lion. Personally, these issues aren't deal-breakers, but those working in more secure environments may want to be aware of them…\nAs for the original issue, a quick search seems to indicate that re-locking without rebooting is possible for partitions on a boot drive in Linux and Bitlocker for Windows, so perhaps this isn't an inherent limitation of FileVault 2, and some future iteration will implement it.\n", "Q: Password dialog appears for password-less SSH private key I installed my SSH private key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa. There is no passphrase associated with the key, however, whenever I connect to an SSH server, a dialog pops up and asks me to enter my password to access the id_rsa file.\nIf I cancel the dialog or enter an empty passphrase and click OK, the Terminal prompts me for a passphrase.\nI have verified that the key is valid and does not require a password by connecting with the same key via other machines.\nSomething odd about my particular set-up is causing the problem but I can't figure it out. I'm currently running OSX 10.7.1 but the same problem was occurring with OSX 10.6.8\n\nA: I had this same problem.  However, when a generated a new password-less private key, using the following command:\nssh-keygen -b 1024 -t rsa -f id_rsa -P \"\"\n\nI no longer saw the password prompt.\nAdditionally, ssh-add failed to add the old key, but added the new one as expected.\nI generated the old key on Leopard in 2009, using what ever version of OpenSSL I had grabbed, built and installed back then (that Mac died, so I can't log in and check what I was running).  Something about that key was incompatible with Lion's native SSL libraries.\nI backed up my old key, so if anyone wants to suggest some checks, to identify the key's specific properties, let me what to check and I'll report back.\nAnother clue - I noticed that my old id_rsa.pub file had extended attributes.  i.e. it's permissions flags looked like this r--------@ instead of r--------\nxattr -l id_rsa.pub.old\n\nreturned:\ncom.macromates.caret: {\n    column = 0;\n    line = 1;\n}\n\ncruft left over from TextMate.  I don't know if removing it would have fixed the issue without my having to replace the key. I think it's unlikely.  \nIn case you (future reader) are seeing the same thing, you can remove the extended attribute as follows:\n xattr -d com.macromates.caret id_rsa.pub.old\n\nYou can stop TextMate from adding them by first exiting TextMate and then issuing this command: \ndefaults write com.macromates.textmate OakDocumentDisableFSMetaData 1\n\n\nA: For me, I have found that some stray text or an imperfection in the keyfile can cause this prompt. The latest for me was this:\n\n -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n\nNotice the extra space there. That was causing this bizarre password prompt to appear on this passwordless key.\n\nA: Older versions of the ssh utility will ask for a passphrase any time it can't interpret the key file.

I'm running OSX 10.6.8 and XCode 3.2.4.\n\nA: I had the same problem at one point with gcc.  gcc and g++ usually link to a version-specific binary.  Look in /Developer/usr/bin for something like g++-x.y, where x.y is the installed version of g++.  You'll probably see gcov, gcc, etc. there as well.  Just create a symbolic link from the versioned g++ to g++.\nFor example, on my machine, I would type ln -sf g++-4.2 g++.\nHope this helps.  If the versioned compiler tools aren't there, you may need to reinstall the Developer Tools.\n\nA: Okay, this is embarrassing. But reinstalling XCode from the OS X disc DID work. I just didn't think to try it because I already had it installed.\n\nA: If you have more than one account try executing g++ from the other account.

Recently I have found that sometimes a \"dead spot\" appears to my USB Apple mouse in the lower right quadrant of my left monitor. When my cursor was in this area, nothing was clickable (making a window active, scroll bars, buttons, etc.) on that part of the window. Other parts of that window that were out of the dead zone were clickable. I noticed that some of my Safari windows straddled the junction of the two monitors, so when I dragged those windows to be totally in the left monitor, the problem seems to have gone away. Any ideas as to what might be going on? I have had this hardware configuration for several years but this problem is very recent.

Can I use a pair of Powerline ethernet adaptors to make the connection?  If so, any advice as to recommended make/model.\n\nA: Yes. From a network point of view, power line communication devices act like a bridge (or a switch, if they support more than 2 ends). That means they should act completely transparent (not accounting for transmission errors or other problems).\n", "Q: Simplest way to record voice on Macbook Air I'm looking for the simplest way to record voice -- a two people conversation -- with a Macbook Air. The goal is then later to listen to it on the Mac and transcribe it.\n\nA: Open QuickTime Player and select File -> New Audio Recording from the menu. This is a new feature (not sure whether it was in Lion, Snow Leopard, or an independent QuickTime update). Previously your options were:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a QuickTime Pro key ($29.99)\n\n*Third Party, commercial: Voice Candy ($12.95)\n\n*Third Party, open source: Audacity (free)\n\n\nA: The simplest way is to use either Quicktime (simply choose File>New Audio Recording) or a free and open-source app like Audacity. Your MBA has a built in microphone, so all you need to do is click record and then start your conversation.\nIf you do this regularly, it way be worth investing in a USB mic that has better sound quality than the built-in mic on your Macbook. Something like the Samson Go Mic is fairly well regarded for field recordings, dictation, and interview recordings.\nLastly, transcription can be a huge pain without software that supports easy pause/resume/rewind capabilities. There are a couple free ones out there, like Transcriptions or more expensive commercial solutions. (Hint: Get a foot pedal!)\nSound-to-text technology is getting increasingly more accurate (though not foolproof as anyone who uses Google voicemail transcription knows), so depending on the quality of your source material and the time you spend training, you can also eliminate a large chunk of the manual transcription with something like MacSpeech Scribe\n\nA: Scenario 1: You're both in the same room\nOpen up QuickTime Player. Select File -> New Audio Recording.... Make sure the source is set to Built-in Microphone (see screen shot below). Hit the big red Record button. Talk away.\n\nScenario 2: You're using Skype or something like it to converse\nThis is a little trickier but not impossible. You'll need the SoundFlower app from Cycling '74. If you're using Skype you'll set it's audio output to be the SoundFlower input. Then in QuickTime you'll set the audio input to be SoundFlower's 2-channel output. This routes the audio from Skype in to QuickTime. Record as above.\n\nA: The simplest manner is to open Photo Booth and record a movie.\nI count 4 clicks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Keyboard command for Launchpad\n\n*Click Photo Booth\n\n*Click the movie control (lower left)\n\n*Clock record\n\n\nAs long as you have space for the video, you can review the recording quite easily and delete it.\n", "Q: Why do full-screen applications change their order in Mission Control? How are fullscreen apps organised? This is usually my workflow:\nDashboard / Desktop / Safari / Pages\n\nI sometimes go to Pages and type some things and go back to Safari, and then I find that it becomes like this:\nDashboard / Desktop / Pages / Safari\n\nIt has shifted location for some reason.\nWhy?\n\nA: Mission Control automatically rearranges your spaces according to how recently you accessed them. Desktop 1 is always Desktop 1 though. You can turn this behaviour off by going to System Preferences -> Mission Control and unchecking the Automatically rearrange spaces based on the most recent use option. This will keep your additional desktops and full screen apps in the order you start them or place them via the Mission Control view.\n\n\nA: \nUncheck it if you must :). Then it will retain 'as launched/created' order.\n\nA: Since the 10.7.2 update, all Desktops can be reordered, but Desktop 1 and Dashboard. It seems that the overall order is based in usage, the most used is moved to the left side.\nIf what you want is to keep an specific order, try what ghoppe suggested here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn ON automatic-ordering (System Preferences > Mission Control > Automatically Rearrange Spaces)\n\n*Command-Tab through applications on each space until you get the\norder you want (they will automatically reorder themselves.)\n\n*Turn OFF automatic-ordering.\n\n", "Q: Thunderbolt to VGA I'm buying a new MacBook Pro tomorrow, but I'm unsure on which adapter to buy for a VGA adapter. Is it the Mini DisplayPort to VGA Adapter? The MacBook Pro doesn't say it has a Mini DisplayPort, only Thunderbolt. So am I going to buy the correct one?\n\nA: Yes.\nThunderbolt is Mini DisplayPort for all purposes. (Note: not all practical purposes, all purposes.) Technically, Thunderbolt is PCI Express and DisplayPort multiplexed, the upshot being that every Thunderbolt port is a MDP port and can be used exactly the same as a normal Mini DisplayPort port. This fact is unchanged as you travel down the daisy-chain of Thunderbolt devices (assuming you have any).\n", "Q: Can I use the Sites folder for whatever I want? Not realizing that OS X creates a ~/Sites folder when you enable web sharing, I started putting my sites for MAMP within a ~/Sites directory, which did not exist on my new laptop. Is this ok, as long as I don't enable web sharing? Even if I did enable it, would something happen to the other files I put in there?\n\nA: It's fine, just realize the built in apache server will share the files you have placed there unless you change the apple supplied httpd.conf should you start up web sharing. \n\nA: Any files you put in the ~/Sites folder will be treated the same way most web hosts treat the files. HTML, images & scripts (scripts may need special changes to htaccess & httpd.conf) will be served normally from http://my-Mac-name-here.local/~jjeaton/ .\nSo, like a typical webserver, whatever files you put in there will not be changed unless you youself edit/move/delete them.\nYou should also double check the permissions so that only you have read/write/execute permission and group & others only have read/execute.\n", "Q: How do I check my Mac's RAM? I know there is MemTest86+ for PCs, but what can I use to see if my RAM is actually good in an Apple product? Whether it's a MacBook, MacBook Pro, iMac or Mac Pro? What symptoms would show that RAM is bad?\n\nA: I've had bad RAM that still allowed the machine to boot - a stick of memory in my Mac Pro apparently failed gracefully overnight. \nThe first step would be to check system profiler to see if the memory is being recognized. If indeed it is, there's a version of MemTest for OS X: http://osxdaily.com/2011/05/03/memtest-mac-ram-test/\n\nA: Kernel panics, the black screen & beeps (referenced elsewhere), or weird crashes that you can't attribute to anything else all can be caused by bad RAM.\nI use Rember which provides a GUI interface to Memtest. It was suggested to me by a tech support rep at One World Computing as their approved way of checking for a bad module before returning ram for exchange. I didn't want to waste their time and resources if my problem, periodic kernel panics, wasn't, as I suspected, caused by a memory upgrade. It turned out that the memory was to blame.\nMemtest and Rember will sometimes find problems that Apple's Hardware Test won't and I highly recommend using one of them if you're looking for bad memory modules.\n\nA: Some signs of bad RAM also include black screen 3 beeps in 5 seconds, this may happen continuously, You can use the method that EpiGrad mentioned or alternatively you can test it with Apple's Hardware Test, if you still have the OSX Disc, insert disc, hold down d on start up memory test should be one of the main categories listed, unless it has been updated since i last used it.\n\nA: It's not as exhaustive as MemTest and Rember, but there's a userspace utility called memtester. You can call it by using memtester 4G. Call memtester to see other options as well.\nYou should also be able to call memtest86 from a LiveCD for Ubuntu or most other operating systems. Give it a try.\n\nA: I would highly recommend using memtest. It's a proven tool and often catches things that the built-in macOS tools will not. It's also worth noting that for best results, you should probably run it single-user mode. Test as much available memory as the program will let you, and run a few loops to be sure.\nIf you relied on the Rember UI for memtest in the past (the developers haven't updated it in 7+ years), I've written a UI for memtest just like rember, but built for the modern cocoa runtime (rember uses a ton of deprecated macOS). It's free and open source, available here: https://memoria.vsanthanam.com\n", "Q: Is it possible to duplicate images in LittleSnapper? The reason is that I have some screenshots of full websites. Though for inspiration and illustration reasons I need to crop them to show different parts of that website. I know that when you crop an image in LittleSnapper it does not damage the original but I really would like to be able to see the full image AND the cropped version\nSo that is why I need to know if there is a way to make copies of the image. Of course there is always a long way of doing it; such as drag it to the desktop and drag it back in, or go back to the web page. But does the application have a copy and paste (images) feature\nThanks\n\nA: LittleSnapper keeps it's images in special library file, so the only way to copy images is to do the long way that you described.\nI'd recommend you get on the LittleSnapper discussion board over at RealMac to add your voice to the group of users who'd also like to get at their images in a more flexible way.\nhttp://support.realmacsoftware.com/discussions/littlesnapper/\n\nA: You can do it easily by using Windows Painter. Just go to your desired page, click \"Print Screen\", then open Windows Paint and paste onto it. After that, crop as you need.\nKeep in mind, coping images or webpages may be subject of copyright.\n", "Q: Manage a multilingual iTunes library? I just imported a huge music library to iTunes.\nThis library contains plenty tracks that are already in my library, but the info is in a different language, my question is, is there a way to have the file info multilingual, so I'll be able to merge the files while keeping the info in both languages?\n\nA: No. Every field is part of the songs ID3 (or meta tag) and only one field can exist at any given time. A song can only have one track name, one genre, one composer, one album title, and so on:\n\nWhether you set the name of the song, for example, to English, or some other language, it doesn't matter as it would require two distinct fields for one ID3 entry, and that is not supported in the metadata container.\nThis is not a limitation of iTunes, but of the songs container.\n", "Q: How to determine how much RAM I can put in my Mac Pro I have a Mac Pro 4,1 (Dual 2.66Ghz, 6GB Ram).  I want to increase the RAM, possibly adding 8GB to my existing 6GB.  The RAM slots are used as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*SLOT1: 1GB\n\n*SLOT2: 1GB\n\n*SLOT3: 1GB\n\n*SLOT4: OPEN\n\n*SLOT5: 1GB\n\n*SLOT6: 1GB\n\n*SLOT7: 1GB\n\n*SLOT8: OPEN\n\n\nWhat are my options without removing the RAM that I already have?  \n\nA: It looks (according to my copy of Mactracker) that your max RAM is: 16 GB for a quad-core or 32 GB for an octo-core.\nYou're already using six gigs, so if you have a quad-core machine you can put in up to ten more. They don't make five-gig sticks that I know of, so four gig sticks would be your maximum, for a total of 14 GB. If you have an 8-core machine, you can put in up to 26 more gigs. If you can find 12-gig sticks (which I doubt), you can put an additional 24 gigs in, but it is more likely that you can put two 8-gig sticks in for sixteen more gigs. This will bring you to 20 GB or (more likely) 22 GB of total RAM.\n\nA: I think you can put more than 16Gb in your Mac Pro. Apple tends to not put the real number in. Check this page:\nhttp://eshop.macsales.com/shop/memory/Mac-Pro-Memory\nRAM prices are ridiculously low these days, better put as much as your budget allows you. You can have 32 Gb for 320$ US, or 16 Gb for 165$.\nAnd since you have 1 Gb modules, you should put them in the slots, like 3 & 7, or 4 & 8, if you intend to use them. i.e.: put your biggest modules in the first slots, and then go down in size the further you go. And RAM modules have to be similar for alternating slot positions, i.e. 1 & 5, 2 & 6, etc...\nIf I may ask, what is your goal with putting more RAM in your machine?\n", "Q: Create audiobook from mp3 files? How do I transfer a folder containing mp3 files to my iPod/iTunes to be recognized as an audiobook?\n\nA: I use iTunes 10 in Windows 7.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the tracks.\n\n*Right-click and select Get Info.\n\n*Open the Options tab.\n\n*Set:\nEquilizer Preset = Spoken Word\nMedia Kind = Audiobook\nPart of a compilation = No\nRemember position = Yes\nSkip when shuffling = Yes\nGapless album = No\n\n*Press OK.\n\n\nAlso, make sure the correct track numbers and disc numbers are set for each track.\n\nA: I used to do the method that Hand-E-Food used. It works fine, but you still end up with a ton of individual mp3 files. This was a pain for me because of the way they showed up when I plug them into my car stereo. \nAfter a bunch of looking around, I found AudioBook Builder. It takes all the mp3 files and converts them into a single .m4b audiobook file. Assuming you are on a Mac, it's worth a look.\nThe app is available directly in the App Store. I've only used it a few times, but that's only because I don't have that many audio books. It was quick and easy and more than worth the price for the hassle it saved me. \n", "Q: How do I make invisible files (like bash profile) visible in the finder? question is in the title. There's some files that most Apple users don't need access to, but if you program you do need access to. in particular the bash profile. anyone know how to make these visible in the finder? \ni'm using a macbook pro 10.6.8\n\nA: All you need to do is set the AppleShowAllFiles preference to \"true.\" From terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles true\n\nIf you'd like to reverse the change, enter the following:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles false\n\nFor the changes to take effect, either restart the Finder or logout and back in.\n\nA: I've gotten very attached to an utility which makes toggling \"see invisible files\" trivial; I highly recommend it to anyone else.\nTotalFinder: http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/.  At time of writing, the author is asking $18, but he also gives away free license (for a number of reasons).\n", "Q: Lion Server wireless filesharing for iPad, what are the file type limitations? I've been searching for information about wireless file sharing for iPad through webdav, which is new in Lion Server. However, I can find nothing more than the few lines Apple has to say, which has been re-blogged around the place.\nTo keep to Q&A, can anyone provide instructions for setting this up, and what types of files can I share? Am I limited to certain file types and why? Is there a way around any file type limitations?\n\nA: There doesn't appear to be any file-type limitation. WebDAV file sharing is enabled in the new Server.app under the File Sharing Service. Click the share you want, and then check \"Share with iOS Devices (WebDAV).\" \nThere isn't anything specific about file types, and Server.app seems to treat WebDAV as just another file-sharing protocol.\n", "Q: How to trick Mozy into thinking network share is local USB disk? Mozy does not support networked mounted drives, but does support USB drives.  I don't want to disconnect a drive I have on my linux server just to do the mozy backups, so can anyone think of a way I can make this drive look like a regular/local disk?\nI mounted the drive via Finder -> Connect to Server.  Then I tried creating a symlink to /Volumes/mynetdrive to ~/Desktop/netdrive, but Mozy still X's the files out\n\nA: For the last couple years, I was basically the primary developer of the Mozy backup client for Mac. I worked primarily on the background process that actually identifies and uploads the files you've selected, and less on the user interface, but I'm still quite familiar with the code in question. I believe this makes me one of the most qualified people in the world to answer your question.\nOn a UNIX-based system such as OS X, information about a filesystem ultimately comes from the statfs(2) system call. One of the pieces of information this call can return is called f_mntfromname. This \"mount from name\" is basically the name of the raw device where the mounted disk originated. For physical volumes, it will probably look something like /dev/disk0s2. For an AFP mount, it looks something like this: afp_3gfD0q3eeRWD4jJmgS0DVWMM-1.2e000004. For a SMB share, it's something like this: //bjhomer@macbook-f2a0b3/Some%20User's%20Public%20Folder. Anyway, the point is that in order to determine whether a file is on a network share or not, Mozy checks whether a file's filesystem was mounted from somewhere inside /dev/, which is where all physically-attached devices live.\nUnfortunately for you, /dev/ is owned by the kernel, and as such not susceptible to simple tricks like a symlink. You'd probably have to resort to a kernel extension (kext) that mimiced the contents of your remotely mounted volume as if it were a locally-mounted volume. I'm not a kext expert, so I'm not even really sure if that's technically feasible. And remember, since Mozy can start a backup at any time, your kext would need to make sure the volume is there at all times, handling any network glitches or the unavailability of the remote volume gracefully. (Any errors are likely to cause a kernel panic.) And you'll need to make sure that the simulated volume is mounted just like a normal volume and can handle all the system calls correctly. It's probably possible to do all of this, but frankly, it seems like a lot of work for very little benefit.\nAll that being said, it's hard to bet against the creativity of the internet. So if someone comes along and thinks of a good way to do it, all the better for you. But know that a good deal of thought went into the design of this particular behavior, and I don't anticipate a simple workaround. Of course, now that Mozy has moved away from their unlimited storage plans, one could argue that continuing to limit the availability of network backups to MozyPro customers seems odd. I'd agree with you. Maybe this limitation will be removed some day, but in the meantime, this is what we've got.\n(For the record, I no longer work at Mozy; it's possible that the implementation of this behavior has changed since I left. I would doubt it, but it is possible.)\n\nA: I might be wrong, but it could be possible to use something like Transmits \"Kernel Extension / Network-Drive Mounting System\".\nFork Lift has this feature too. and it shows up as a \"Generic File System (OSXFUSE)\" on my MacBook Air.\nIf you really want it, it's worth a try because both have a demo version.\n", "Q: How can I configure my computer to run an AppleScript at a specific time? Caveat: without using iCal Since upgrading to Lion, I have seen a sleight decrease of productivity when it comes to using iCal. As a result, I am trying alternatives such as BusyCal. The application seems great, however I cant set an alarm to run a script as I could in iCal.\nHence, I want to become independent from iCal and have an AppleScript run everyday without having to keep iCal running. Any idea of how to do this?\n\nA: In recent versions of OS X launchd is preferred to cron. Here's an excerpt from man crontab under Mavericks:\n\nDarwin note: Although cron(8) and crontab(5) are officially supported under Darwin, their functionality has been absorbed into launchd(8), which provides a more flexible way of automatically executing commands.\n\nYou can control launchd using the built-in launchctl but many people (including me) use a GUI called Lingon.\nUPDATE: I now use LaunchControl instead of Lingon. It's a lot more powerful, though the interface is more complicated.\n\nA: You can run a cronjob using crontab. \nSo basically, to run a cronjob, you will need to type nano ~/crontab in Terminal. This will create a new file called \"crontab\" in your home folder, and open up a simple text editor in Terminal. Type:  \n* * * * * osascript ~/Desktop/theScriptToBeExecuted.applescript\nThis will run an AppleScript named \"theScriptToBeExecuted.applescript\" located on your desktop, every minute. The five \"*\" before the osascript command specify the time. Here's a table to show you what each field stands for:\n\n*     *     *   *    *        command to be executed\n-     -     -   -    -\n|     |     |   |    |\n|     |     |   |    +----- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0)\n|     |     |   +------- month (1 - 12)\n|     |     +--------- day of        month (1 - 31)\n|     +----------- hour (0 - 23)\n+------------- min (0 - 59)\n\nSo to run the same command at one minute past midnight (00:01) of every day of the month, of every day of the week, type this in the file:\n1 0 * * * osascript ~/Desktop/theScriptToBeExecuted.applescript\nIf you need more info, check out this article on cron.\nTo save the file that you're working on, type Control+X (exits), then Y (tells Terminal that you do want to save the file), then Enter Now type at the prompt cron ~/crontab This tells cron that it should be looking at the crontab file, if your file is named \"crontab\" in your home folder.\nAnother alternative is Cronnix It's a GUI for crontab.\nScript Timer is similar, but it runs specified AppleScripts at specified times. It's a little easier to use, but it costs $12. I would recommend just going with Cronnix (free) or crontab (also free!)\n", "Q: Is it possible to export safari's reading list on Safari 5.1? Subject sums it up. Just curious if there is a trick to be able to export your reading list from Safari, any format. Where on the HD is the info stored? bookmarks.plist?\n\nA: You can convert it into XML in a Terminal/command window using:\ncd ~/Library/Safari/\ncp Bookmarks.plist Bookmarks.plist.xml  \nplutil -convert xml1 Bookmarks.plist.xml\n\n\nA: Yes. The file is called Bookmarks.plist and it is located in ~/Library/Safari/. This houses not only your Reading List bookmarks, but all your bookmarks.\nYou'll want to look for entries under the key ReadingList. They will look something like this (file viewed in xCode 4):\n\nUnfortunately, the plist file is stored as a binary, and you'll either have to open it using xCode or another tool that can handle binary plist files.\n\nA: You can't export from Safari but you can import from Chrome\nHere it is on Google support: https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/96816?hl=en\nAlternatively you can open the Terminal application on a Mac (search it in Launchpad if you can't find it) and paste this:\n/usr/bin/plutil -convert xml1 -o - ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist | grep -E  -o '<string>http[s]{0,1}://.*</string>' | grep -v icloud | sed -E 's/<\\/{0,1}string>//g'\n\nHit return and it will list all your Reading List links as text which you can copy and paste elsewhere.\n\nA: In OS X Yosemite, go to ~/Library/Safari/ReadingListArchives\n", "Q: How can I back up 2 internal drives to a single Time capsule? I recently reinstalled Lion on an SSD and have all my media on the original HDD on my MBP.  I was hoping Time Machine would recognize my existing backups in Time Capsule but it wants to start a new backup image. Also, it looks like Time Machine wants to only back up my SSD. So, my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I back up both drives to one time capsule image as if they were a single logical drive?\n\n*How can I access my old backed up data in the existing image?\n\nA: Time Machine's thinking is backup everything except what you tell it not to and the time machine hard drive itself. It should not matter how many drives you have connected, they should all be backed up to the time capsule just fine. In other words, you can backup multiple sources but only on one destination, as long as this destination shows up as a single logical drive in the Finder.\nJust check in Sys Prefs > Time Machine > Options if the other HD isn't just simply added to the list of exceptions, don't see how it would end up there by itself, but just in case.\nAnd I don't think you can keep working with the same backup, since you divided the data in to 2 separate logical drives. Time Machine just does not think like that. Better start from scratch, perhaps backing up the current backup set to another drive if you need to preserve all the previous backups... Some people need to be able to go back in time to a specific point. I care only to have one up-to-date copy, don't care much about having 30 different ones.\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes you can back up the drives, but not as one logical drive. The backup will be of your computer then, inside the computer's backup will be the two drives.\n\n*I have never mounted a Time Machine image, but on a Leopard Time Machine backup (which doesn't have an image), you can see and access each of the drives separately. So, my guess is that you more than likely can.\n", "Q: How can I export an MS Outlook .pst file to Apple Mail? I want to export an MS Outlook .pst file to Apple Mail. How can I do this?\n\nA: Do it via an IMAP server, which you can install on the Mac. I used dovecot, created an account on it, added that account to Outlook and just moved it all over. Then in Mail, I created the same account, and copied everything over.\nI prefer this method because it completely preserves all the properties of each message, including attachments. Exporting and importing through another method (including Thunderbird) doesn't preserve everything properly.\n\nA: You can use Outlook2Mail. It can export mails, contacts and calendar entries.\nBut there are a few caveats:\n\n\n*\n\n*12,95USD\n\n*Only U.S./English versions of Windows and Outlook are supported at this time. Little Machines does not guarantee the successful conversion of non-English characters, languages other than English and date formats outside of the United States.\n\n*You need a computer which is still running Outlook to export.

If the sidebar has SHARED in grey writing with nothing under it then try placing the cursor to the right of the word (near the right edge of the pane) and either Hide or Show will appear, allowing you to toggle the list.\n", "Q: Is it possible to run lion, ubuntu, and backtrack on my imac? Would it be possible to do this? To run lion, ubuntu, and backtrack all on the same machine?\nOr even just lion and backtrack would do the trick. If so, how would I go about doing this?\n\nA: It will be easiest to run Ubuntu and Backtrack in virtual machines rather than setting up a multiple boot configuration, and you'll be able to run everything simultaneously (assuming enough RAM). You'll need a copy of Parallels or VMware Fusion (which cost money) or VirtualBox (which doesn't).\n\nA: The Ubuntu MacTel Community documentation should be able to get you started. It admittedly fails to cover a \"Mac OS X with multi Linux\" install, but once your HD is partitioned and rEFIt is up and running, I think it should be fairly straightforward to get both distros installed (well, at least \"straightforward\" by Linux standards).\n", "Q: First steps after acquiring a new MacBook Pro (w.r.t ensuring optimal battery life)? I just unboxed a new MBP 13.3 inch i5. I wanted to know what is the best way to start using it, so as to ensure optimal battery life i.e. \n\n\n*\n\n*Should I charge it to full capacity, before even booting it ?\n\n*Should I start using it out of the box on AC ?\n\n*Also, going forward, what must I do to ensure that the battery lasts longer, and the average capacity doesn't go down with the years ?\n\n\nWhile I appreciate individual experiences/suggestions, I'd really like links to articles/reviews from respectable websites that could authenticate the information - there are simply too many opinions out there :).\n\nA: Nothing. Use it and charge it when it gets low. There aren't any \"tricks\" to ensuring a healthy battery anymore, but Apple does recommend the following:\n\nBe sure to fully charge your portable when you plug it in for the\n  first time, and then run Software Update to ensure you have the latest\n  software.\n\nThe new Apple notebooks (2009 and up) monitor the health of your battery and charge it accordingly, so there is very little maintenance required anymore. In fact, they no longer even require battery calibrations. All new Apple notebook batteries are pre-calibrated and ready to use.\nAs for usage trends to ensure longevity, that too is all handled by the OS and you can consult Apple's battery article for more details.\nTo be honest, storing the battery in the fridge or freezer, running it down and then charging it, pulling it out when using AC, or all the other myriad of \"tricks\" you'll read about are snake oil. Batteries have a limited life-span, and they start to deplete as soon as they are manufactured. That is the nature of batteries. Using them only exacerbates this phenomenon. There is no magic wand to turn back the hand of time.\nIn closing, Apple has some tips on how to maintain your notebook's battery. Just follow their recommendations, and enjoy your new computer.\n\nA: I've been suggested to finish all the battery without pluging the charger when unboxing my Macbook Pro. Then Recharge it for about 14 hours then start using. But the light on the plug has already turned to green after 4 hours recharging first time. I won't wait for 14 hours of course. There is s.thing that I suggest not to use a Lithium-Polymer Battery while it's on charge. And it's recommended trying to finish all the energy before recharging again.\n", "Q: Xcode 3.2.6 and iOS 4.3 SDK installation problem on Mac OS X Lion I recently brought a new Mac mini running Max OS X 10.7 Lion.\nI downloaded the iOS SDK 4.3 and Xcode 3.2.6.dmg from Apple.\nThe download was successful and I was able to install it without any problem. But after installing, I cannot find Xcode in the /Developer/Applications folder.\nAll I do see there are performance tools and utilities folders.\nCan anybody help me in properly installing Xcode on Lion?\n\nA: For Lion you need Xcode 4 (not 3.2) This is available from the App Store or from a paid Developer account).\nThis will install the installer in /Applications, run this to install Xcode to /Developer\n\nA: Look again in Applications.

I currently have a 3,1 Mac Pro with dual quad xeon CPUs, 20GB RAM, 1TB SSD (8x256gb in two RAID 10 groups), ATI 5770, running Lion.  I currently have every DVD and BluRay I own ripped to a set of eSATA direct attached storage arrays at about 38TB (76TB in RAID 1).\nI'm looking at the new (2011) 27\" iMacs and wondering how they would compare.  I'd probably buy a non-SSD version and migrate some of my existing SSD into the new machine, and I'd do the usual \"minimum amount of Apple RAM\" and max it out on my own.  I'd put the noisy Mac Pro[1] in the basement and use it as a file server as well as a xgrid compilation node, remote Mathematica kernel, and random server.  My main concern is compute speed.\nI use a lot of RAM and fast disk for Java/Scala/Erlang/Mathematica/Haskell/R/Rails/Mono/iOS development (often 3-4 of these at the same time), along with a bad habit of keeping too many Safari and Chrome tabs open (Chrome to sandbox Flash, which is otherwise uninstalled on my system).\nI've reached a point where I feel as if I've topped out on this machine, and need to upgrade.  Even with 4+ GB RAM free, it can't keep up with my \"needs\".\nThe 3,1 was pretty magical in that the price variance from the low-end quad core to the top-end octo was only about USD1k-1.5k.  Now, to get a \"hot\" Mac Pro, I'd be looking closer to $5k.  With that, I'd still have a machine without Thunderbolt ports, which require motherboard support, according to Apple.  (Take that as you will.)\nI'm not up to date with the advances in Intel CPUs over the past few years.  What comparison could I draw between the i5 and i7 options?  Clock for clock, are they significantly faster than my Xeons?  Would the 3.1 or 3.4 ghz i7 zoom past my 2008 (westmere?) CPUs?\nI do use all eight cores very frequently, as I write and use a lot of parallel code.  I've been using multiprocessing systems for about 20 years now, so it's my native mode of developing.\nThanks for any/all help!\n[1] It's not loud, but it hums at about 35dB at a frequency that causes my ears to ring when I leave the room.  I often wear noise-canceling headphones or ear plugs, but I am oversensitive to noise.  I can still hear the transformers in CRTs from 50+ feet away and behind walls at the doddering age of 39.\n\nA: It would be a lateral move in terms of processing performance. The following are scores taken from Geekbench (how fortuitous that they were right next to each other?):\n\nAs you can see, it's a slight downgrade in processing power, and I stress slight, if that is indeed your current model (3.2 GHz). The other variants (3.0 GHz for example, which can be seen if you scroll down the list) clock in at slightly lower numbers (~9000). While you would gain the use of an additional Thunderbolt port, the 6 Gbps controller, and a faster FSB, they may not offset the cost of buying a new machine.\nIt really doesn't look like it would be a significant upgrade from your current Mac.\n\nA: I can't answer directly, but maybe Marco Arment can. \nI think it'll come down to your personal usage, there's been a lot of stuff floating round from Geek Bench for the i5s and i7s since Apple dropped them, and if I remember rightly they basically outperform a lot of 3 year old Mac Pros in certain aspects but not in others. \n", "Q: Use the Airdrop network to access a computer? I'm using airdrop to transfer files and stuff to another macbook. Looking at the output of ifconfig, I can see that airdrop creates a VNIC to communicate with the other computer. \nIs there a way I can use that connection as a full fledged AdHoc network connection, i.e ping the other computer, use normal file sharing etc.? \nBecause even though I can use airdrop while being connected to another wifi network (i.e the network card can connect to an adhoc connection as well as an infrastructure connection simultaneously), if I use an adhoc network through the wifi icon in the top bar, I am disconnected from the other wifi connection.\n\nA: Yes, the VNIC created when an AirDrop window is open can be used by any application. AirDrop simply runs Bonjour (mDNS/DNS-SD) on that interface to discover peer and the TLS to transfer files. Any network application that can be configured to use a specific interface and supports IPv6 should work.\nFor example, pinging (replace X with whatever the interface number is in use, see ifconfig for example): ping6 -I p2pX ff02::1\n\nA: AirDrop is limited to the sending and receiving of file only, and cannot be hijacked for any other purpose.  It's one of those \"Do 1 thing well, and nothing else\" tools.  There may be other software available to create a virtual NIC whilst leaving your existing connection uninterrupted (you may be able to manually create one using the command line and iifconfig tools or similar) but the only way I can think to allow you to have a multi-homed macbook is to have multiple genuine network adapters, and as such a USB dongle for your ad-hoc connections.  Not perfect, but better than trying to bend AirDrop to do something it isn't designed to do.\n", "Q: I am not able to see or use cut/paste in lion I upgraded to lion on the day it was released. After that I updated my system twice even then I am not able to see any cut paste option as specified here.\n\nMine is still:-\nNote: Command+Option+V  is not working for me. Nothing happens :(\n\nA: You have to press the Option key BEFORE clicking Edit on the Menu. This will dynamically change the menu to show the \"move\" option.\n\nA: Assuming you have tried (Command ⌘ + C) and (Command ⌘ + V), as sometimes it will not show in the edit menu, try a P-RAM reset on the computer. Turn your computer off, then turn on while holding Command ⌘ + Option ⌥ + P + R, the computer will turn off and on, wait for four charms before releasing.

I installed Call of Duty: Modern Warfare on it at the weekend only to find the on-board GPU can't cope with it.\nI'd like to do a bit of gaming on it, but am concerned that modern titles are going to be too much for it. Can anyone suggests workarounds to let me game on my otherwise lovely laptop?\n\nA: OnLive actually works surprisingly well on those little MBPs, I was using it for a while as I'm not a particularly hardcore gamer so don't mind the graphics not looking amazing.\n", "Q: How does Keynote decide which display to appear on? The scenario: I go into class, hook up my laptop to the projector using mini-display port adapter, and fire up Keynote.  Keynote opens with it's window on the projected display, showing off the hidden slides or completed builds or slide #42.  I'd rather have it open on the laptop display so the only thing my audience sees is the title slide.  I then spend two minutes trying to get a mouse over the titlebar so I can pull the window back to my laptop display.\nI'm not sure this is a Keynote specific question.  I just don't end up using other apps in the classroom.\nSo, how can I control which display an application will open on when started?\n\nA: More recent versions of keynote don't have that preference.\nInstead: start the presentation. On the presenter notes screen you'll see these icons:\n\n\n\nClick on the one that's second from the right (that looks like 2 screens being switched :-)\n\nA: In Keynote's prefs, under the \"Slideshow\" tab, there's a pair of radio buttons to set which display to do the presentation on, and which to do the \"presenter view\" on. Took me a while to find it too, but there it is!\n\n\nA: I did a google search finding this thread because I had the same issue as Bill Nace.  I didnt find the answer anywhere so I thought I would share how I resolved it after trial and error.  \nKeynote seems to open the presentation on the display with the highest resolution.\nSince my 'projector' display was the largest resolution when I would open a new keynote file it would open on that screen and then I would have to drag it back to the 'laptop' screen for any editing before starting the presentation.  I increased the 'laptop' screen resolution and the keynote files started opening on that screen.\n\nA: Keynote uses the primary display as the display for the audience view. The secondary display is used to show a \"presenter view\" which shows the current and upcoming slides, an elapsed time timer and anything else you've set up the presenter view to show (to customize this view go to Play -> Customize Presenter Display...). You can turn off the Presenter Display on the secondary monitor by going to Preferences..., clicking on the Presenter Display tab and unchecking the Use alternate display to view presenter information option.\nIf you want the audience view to appear on the project you need to make the projector display the primary display before you play your Keynote presentation. To change which display is primary and which is secondary, connect your Mac to the projector and then goto to System Preferences -> Displays. Click the Arrangement tab in the settings box on the primary display. Drag the white strip, which represents the menu bar, from the display that is your MacBook, to the display that is the projector. This makes the projector your primary display while it is connected to your MacBook. When you disconnect, the primary display designation returns to the MacBook automatically. Next time you connect to the projector you shouldn't have to go through this -- the MacBook should remember that you liked the projector to be the primary display in this setup.\n\n", "Q: How do I enable fine volume control via a keyboard shortcut in Lion? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs fine volume adjustment possible in OS X Lion? \n\nIs there a way to re-enable the fine volume control using\nshift + option + volume\n\nIt has been removed in Lion, but I use it often.\nMaybe there is a globals pref that works?\n\nA: Yes, you can do some modifications & scripting to get the effect.\nSee instructions here: http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/jrgxx/how_to_quarter_step_volume_adjustment_in_lion/\n", "Q: Why are my events disappearing in iCal after upgrading to Lion and how can I fix it? I have several calendars synced using MobileMe and after upgrading to Lion it is often the case that a day's worth of newly added events all disappear. This generally happens when I am in another application. Often, if I re-add the same event later, the old events re-appear, giving me duplicates.  However, if I never re-add the events, the old ones never come back.  \nThe events that are missing from my Mac still appear on my iPhone, but attempting to re-sync does not bring the events back to my Mac.\nI have tried clearing my iCal cache and preferences while the events are missing, but this does not seem to bring them back.\nSo, why are my events disappearing in iCal and how can I fix it?\n\nA: iOS 5 and iCloud should be coming out tomorrow.  There should be improvements in this area.  Hopefully this will help you.  I know it is not what you would want to hear, but I have seen disappearing content like you describe.  Especially with Exchange, and OS 10.6.x \n\nA: MacWorld just has an article: How to make Lion's iCal less annoying, where the last Q&A is about the MobileMe sync on Lion's iCal, maybe can solve your problem.\n\nA: I've had the exact same problem (except under Snow Leopard, so I don't think it's specific to Lion).  I asked about this on Apple's Support Communities but did not receive any useful responses.  However...\nI use VPN (Cisco's VPNClient, specifically) to log into my employer's internal network.  I noticed that this dissappearing problem only happens to events that are added to iCal while VPN'd to work.  I suspect that something is being blocked when my Mac tries to sync with MobileMe.  Possibly the event is getting to MobileMe (which is why it shows up on my iPhone) but that a confirmation is not making it back through?  Now I only add events while not using VPN and the problem has not re-appeared.\nAre you using VPN?\n\nA: I have this problem with BusyCal/Snow Leopard, and they tell me it is a known MobileMe bug. They didn't know whether iCloud would do better.\n\nA: Ok, When you create an event on your iTouch or iPhone you must specify what calendar to use in the event setting. Depending on what calendar is synced with iCal that is the one you will choose.\n", "Q: Is possible modify the App Store purchased listing (delete or hide some/unhide other hidden apps)? I have an application listed in my bought applications. I prefer to not see or hide some apps I have purchased in the list of purchased apps. Is there a way to do this? Can I reverse this and unhide these hidden apps at a later date?\nFor example:\n\n\nA: Not on any version of the Mac App Store and iTunes App store for iTunes versions older than 10.5\nIt appears you can now hide iOS App Store purchases in the recently released version of iTunes.\n\nAnd you can see them once they're hidden as well as un-hide them if you wish.\n\n\nA: No, Apple has not provided a way to do this on either the Mac or iOS app stores.\nPlease file a bug report with Apple at http://bugreport.apple.com/. You can copy and paste the bug report I filed regarding this issue from here: http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=1338401 and be sure to note that it is a duplicate of rdar://10115627.\nApple encourages duplicate bug reports as it helps them prioritize issues. This is one I'd love to see resolved.\nHere's a copy of the bug report I filed:\n\nSummary:\nSince the addition of the \"purchased\" tab in both the iOS and Mac App\n  Stores it is trivial for anyone using your device to view a full\n  history of every app ever purchased on your account.

Every time I listen to music on iTunes or VLC, I notice that the process coreaudiod causes an unusually high CPU usage (5% or more).\nAre you having the same issue? What's the reason for such a high CPU usage?\n\n*\n\n*Recent OS X updates have not changed this observation. Restarting (or killing the process so it respawns) doesn't fix the problem. After a couple of seconds, CPU usage of coreaudiod goes above 5% again.\n\n\n*It's important to note that using line out makes the problem go away and coreaudiod's CPU usage goes down to 1%-2%.\n\n\nA: A tab in google chrome running WhatsApp keeps the system awake; in particular, coreaudiod is running.\nSee https://webdiary.com/tag/coreaudiod/\n\nA: The high CPU usage of coreaudiod is due to the ambient noise reduction software working (surprisingly, even when the built-in microphone is not in use).\nGo to System Preferences > Sound > Input and uncheck the Use ambient noise reduction box.\nThen, either reboot or run this one-liner to reload coreaudiod, and you should see coreaudiod CPU usage drop to 1% or less.\n\nA: This appears to be a know issue, and hopefully will be fixed in an update in the future.\nFor now though, there are one or two things you could try (it goes without saying that make sure all software is updated to its highest stable version)\n\n\n*\n\n*First of all, restart your computer. \n\n*Second of all, install Onyx. Install and open, and click on the 'Cleaning' tab. Under that, make sure, on the 'System' section, that the 'Audio Components' option is checked. Click execute, and let it do it's thing. \n\n*Then open Disk Utility, select your startup volume, and repair all disk permissions. Let it run, then close all apps and restart again. \n\n\nI hope this helps relieve the problem in some way, but I cannot guarantee it, having not been afflicted with it myself, however this is the course of action I take whenever my CPU usage is higher than I would expect it to be due to a process.\n\nA: This is indeed due to Google Chrome browser continuously using the microphone to listen for the hotword 'OK Google'. While unchecking noise reduction in the system audio preferences will decrease CPU usage (in my case from 12% to 8% coreaudiod) this does not fix the underlying issue.\nTo completely resolve the issue open Google Chrome -> Settings -> Search -> and disable 'Enable \"OK Google\" to start a voice search'.\nMy coreaudiod CPU usage went from 12% to zero.\n\nA: Seems like creating the folder Library/Preferences/Audio worked for at least some people. Have you tried it?\n\nA: Certain applications appear to be triggering this problem when interacting with the microphone.  The problem goes away a minute or two after the problem applications are closed.\nProblem applications\nThese applications need to be restarted in order to restore normal CPU usage.  They do not release their hold on the microphone properly.\n\n\n*\n\n*HipChat after first time camera/mic are used, such as when opening preferences (see HipChat forums)\n\n*Boom by Global Delight Technologies (reference)--as far as I can tell, this shouldn't be using the microphone\n\n\nBackground applications\nThese applications could be running in the background while using your microphone.\n\n\n*\n\n*Any VoIP application such as Skype or FaceTime\n\n*Adobe Flash in a web browser\n\n*Virtualization software such as VMware, VirtualBox, or Parallels.  These will likely \"listen\" to your microphone whenever you have a virtual machine running, even if that virtual machine doesn't seem to be using the microphone at the moment.  Most virtualization software allows you to disable audio hardware virtualization, which should solve this, although some may not be granular enough to disable the microphone without also disabling the speakers.\n\n*Specialized audio software such as that developed by Akai Pro (example report for EIE Pro with Logic X)\n\n*Voice search/recognition software, including Google Chrome's \"Ok Google\" voice search capability (reported as partially fixed by Chrome developers: Chrome will stop listening when switching users)\n\n\nA: This could be audio plugins that run under core audio.\n\nA: I just had the same issue on 10.8.4.\nQuitting Boom.app seems to have resolved it for me.\nI think Boom uses similar technology as AirFoil, so it might be worth quitting or uninstalling anything that somehow captures and modifies or redirects the audio-stream.\nPerhaps the app afflicting you saves state per output device, and it's state for your built-in speakers is borked somehow.\n\nA: Disabling \"Google Voice Search Hotword (Beta)\" extension in Google Chrome helped... OS X 10.9.1 Mavericks\n\nA: Here in 2020, I had a couple of clones of iOS Simulator running an (otherwise idle) app. coreaudio was taking about 18% CPU, and quitting the Simulator dropped it to zero.\n\nA: I found that killing Flash fixed the problem for me.  \nI rebooted yesterday to see if that would fix the problem, but by this afternoon, coreaudiod had accumulated 6 hours of CPU time. I have not used any audio apps (VLC, iTunes, etc.).\nI turned off \"ambient noise reduction\" and there was no impact - still at 8-10% CPU. I noticed Flash running with a much lower CPU (~1%), but I did not realize that I was visiting any Flash-based websites. I killed Flash, and coreaudiod disappeared from Activity Monitor. When I re-enabled \"ambient noise reduction\" there was no impact - coreaudiod still gone. (This all on OS X 10.9.)\n\nA: Some people claim this helps:\n$ sudo launchctl unload /system/library/launchdaemons/com.apple.audio.coreaudiod.plist\n$ sudo rm -r /Library/Preferences/Audio/\n$ sudo mkdir /Library/Preferences/Audio\n$ sudo chown -R _coreaudiod:admin /Library/Preferences/Audio\n$ sudo launchctl load /system/library/launchdaemons/com.apple.audio.coreaudiod.plist\n\nFor me it turned out the cause was this HipChat issue.\n", "Q: How to obtain glyphs from the \"Apple Symbols\" font in Lion? I'd like to make use of the special iOS symbols found in Apple Symbols font, e.g. the \"Reload\" and \"Action\" glyphs. In Snow Leopard, I could obtain and insert them via the \"special characters\" pane where I could show (and select!) all the symbols of any given font. In Lion, however, this feature seems to be missing (said pane now only contains some given character ranges) and when I preview the entire font repertoire in font-book, I can't select and insert text from the preview area.\nIs there a way to obtain those symbols in a copyable form (i.e. to insert them into another application) on Lion?\n\nA: Snow Leopard's CharacterPalette.app still works on 10.7:\n\nThose \"iOS symbols\" shown in the screenshot above are glyph variants that are specific to Apple Symbols. For example the turned arrow icon is a variant of Ꮿ.

Is there a way to have Bluetooth automatically restart when I wake the computer?\nEDIT: I should mention that this has only happened since I upgraded from Snow Leopard to Lion last week.\n\nA: Try re-pairing the trackpad. Go to System Preferences then Trackpad then Setup Bluetooth trackpad... Select the trackpad and then Unpair. Then select it again (using your built-in trackpad) and select Pair.\n\nA: You might want to check the batteries again. I had the exact same issue with fairly new batteries that looked like Duracell but not Duracell. After trying a few recipes from Google search and calling Apple support to no avail, I thought I'd resort to the final technique of shaking and knocking the trackpad. That's when I heard a rattling noise inside the battery chamber. Sure enough, the batteries (Power Source AA from Costco) were about 1/2 mm shorter than the standard AA batteries, resulting in a loose connection. Can you believe that!?\nThe trackpad is working fine after replacing the batteries with Duracell (or other standard AA batteries). I hope this is the issue in your case. \n", "Q: Web clips on Dashboard not always updating correctly in OS X (Lion) I am having problems with Web Clips. Had the problem in OS X Leopard and now in Lion.\nMy problem is that I have clipped the \"Major Stock Indexes\" part of this page: http://online.wsj.com/mdc/page/marketsdata.html and sometimes it updates when I go to the dashboard, sometimes not (the timestamp in that section can be up to 24 hours old), which is frustrating. Going to the page in Safari shows me an updated page with a timestamp as of now, so it's not the page compatability with Safari that's the problem but I suspect something to do with web clips / the OS X dashboard functionality.\nI have (of course) googled for a solution, but found none.\nAny ideas of how I could solve it (or if not, how can one report a bug to Apple so they actually look at it/fix it)?\nThanks :-)\n\nA: You can submit a bug report here. It requires having a free Developer account. You can also submit feedback here which doesn't require a Developer account. I would suggest reporting on both.\n\nA: As a workaround until this gets fixed, you can click on the widget in question and hit Cmd-R to manually refresh it.\n\nA: While Googling for the same solution (or workaround) I came across this page that offers something: http://mandogmachine.com/2010/10/how-to-fix-empty-dashboard-web-clips-in-snow-leopard/\n\nHere’s the workaround, step-by-step. It assumes that you already have\n  two or more Web Clips from the same site in your Dashboard and one or\n  more of them are coming up empty or they’re being resized so they\n  don’t display the correct part of the web page.\nFirst, in Safari go to the Safari menu item and click Reset Safari. In\n  the dialog that appears check at least the first four items and click\n  Reset. This will clean up Safari and generally make it less likely for\n  the problem to occur. Then, open Dashboard. Click on the widget that’s\n  not displaying correctly. Press cmd+R and immediately close Dashboard\n  while it’s reloading the widget by either clicking in an area without\n  a widget or by pressing the Dashboard key on your Apple Keyboard (F4).\n  You need to exit Dashboard while it’s reloading the Web Clip,\n  otherwise it won’t work. Reload Dashboard. The widget should show its\n  contents and it should stay that way. Repeat this process for every\n  Web Clip that comes up empty when you open Dashboard. Once you run\n  through the steps above, it seems to stick.

There are a number of actions you could copy for file movement, etc., and attach them as folder actions to A, B, and C.\nIt should also be a simple matter to pick and choose which actions and workflows you would require for this.\nEven better, the underlying technology for these actions are just shell scripts.  If you can write a shell, ruby, python, etc. script, you can create your own Automator action.  You could easily store state regarding files in A, B, and C that have already been copied to D and only copy them again if certain criteria are met, such as a change in file size, modify date, or md5 hash.\n\nA: Try using the application Hazel it's $22 with a free 14 day trial.

How can I prevent Terminal from showing me my old output when it starts? \nI would like it to always start with a clean window.\n\nA: Besides setting the preference to always suppress Resume, you can also control this when quitting by pressing the Option modifier key, so that \"Quit …\" becomes \"Quit and Discard Windows\". e.g., you can type Option-Command-Q to quit without saving state. You can also press the Shift modifier when an application is opening to prevent it from restoring state for Resume.\nThere is also a Terminal preference (without UI) for controlling how many lines of the scroll-back to restore, which you can set to zero, although it still restores the display contents:\ndefaults write com.apple.Terminal RestoreScrollbackLines 0\n\n\nA: You can change terminal only with this one command to write a new preference for that specific app.\ndefaults write com.apple.terminal NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool false\n\nThis is general, so of course, substitute safari or quicktimeplayerX or whatever in the com.apple.terminal portion of the command as needed. This setting switches the default save behavior upon quitting that one app. You'll find many of the other apps that work well with this setting by searching on NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows.\nOf course, you should issue this defaults command after closing all windows and then quitting the application to ensure the settings are read the next time Terminal starts.\n\nA: There seems to be one case where disabling NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows does not work: When the Terminal is killed by killall Terminal, and probably also when it crashes or when it is forced quit.\nI use killall Terminal regularly, but when the resume kicks in, it messes up my bash history. Basically, commands from the session after the resume will not be saved. Normal saving behaviour is only restored after I quit and reopen Terminal.app. It appears, though, that completely disabling any resume features fixes bash history:\nchmod a-rwx ~/Library/Saved\\ Application\\ State/com.apple.Terminal.savedState\n\nThanks to willWorkForCookies’s answer to How to prevent one app from saving/restoring any Saved State.\n\nA: The only way to do this is to completely disable the resume feature in Lion\nhttp://www.macrumors.com/2011/07/20/how-to-disable-lions-resume-feature/\n\nA: You can actually deactivate \"save state\" on per-app basis, have a look at https://faqintosh.com/risorse/en/sys/swapsaveability/\nHTH\n", "Q: Internet Sharing failing on Mac OS X Lion Server Before I upgraded to Lion Server, I was running 10.7.1\nI setup Internet Sharing in the preferences\n(Share from Ethernet 1 to Ethernet 2).\nAfter the upgrade, sharing doesn't work unless I take the following steps\n\n\n*\n\n*Login\n\n*Turn off Internet Sharing\n\n*Turn Internet Sharing back on\n\n\nSo the question is can I have Internet Sharing on and running even if no one is logged in?\nThanks\n\nA: The answer is yes.\nI'm typing you this answer through an InternetSharing\nconnexion provided by an iMac running MacOS Lion (10.7.3) where no one is connected:\nme -> MBP    ………Wi-Fi………   iMac   ………Ethernet………   Internet \n      10.6.8               10.7.3\n\nI'm using such a connection for professionnal use\nsince MacOS 10.4 with no one connected (on the Mac running InternetSharing).

I have a third-party NAS drive (Western Digital MyBook World II) which I used for time machine backups in Snow Leopard.  I've upgraded to Lion and the first backup has spent over an hour 'Verifying Backup...', what is OS X actually doing here and if I choose to skip verification what are the consequences?  It seems to be stuck on 69%...\n\nA: If it's your first backup in Lion, you need to leave the computer awake and connected to the Time Machine volume and let it do its thing, perhaps overnight. Once it makes an initial backup it has to construct an elaborate index database so that the Time Machine restore functions can work correctly. If you interrupt or cancel the process, it will have to start over from the beginning again at some other time, and this will indeed take up time and system resources. I have heard complaints from others that the initial backup, verifying, indexing, etc. takes a great deal of time in Lion, but you need to allot the  time necessary to let the system do its thing in order that it work correctly.\n\nA: I've had this same issues on later versions of Mac OS X, including Yosemite. What's happening is that the system is running fsck to check the integrity of the backup. \nFound a solution here. Basically, to get around it, go to System Preferences, and set the sleep time to 3 hours or longer. Per some of the other posts, the long time may be needed for some cross-linked files.\nAfter modifying the sleep time, my backup issues were solved.\n", "Q: An app or script to watch folder and display new images in full screen?

She no work!!!11  In the absence of any meaningful log data (that I could find) to go on, I decided to just plop the whole thing into the default document root (\"/opt/local/apache2/htdocs\").  Voila!  Immense anger!\nSo, does Mac OS X have something like SELinux that might prevent Apache from doing something silly, like serve files from the place I want to serve them from?  I read a little about Mac OS X's MAC framework, but that didn't seem to be what I was looking for.\nI was using virtual hosts, as initially configured by Macports.\n\nA: To answer your question as stated: Yes, MAC OS X has something similar to SELinux providing mandatory access control security polices and roles. As you have discovered it's called MAC and I believe it's based on the TrustedBSD implementation of the same name.\nTo answer your implicit question: No. MAC should not interfere with the ability to serve documents out of your home directory. Most likely either your permissions or your virtual host configuration is incorrect.\nIf I remember correctly the logs should be in /var/log/apache2 or /var/log/httpd. Please edit your question to contain the relevant parts of your virtual host configuration and logs.\n\nA: Might this provide a clue?

I'm a little confused here. Should I buy modules especially labeled as \"Apple\" type?\n\nA: You can find the specifications for your computer here.\nSpecifically, the unit has the following (with a maximum RAM capacity of 8GB):\n\n\n*\n\n*RAM Type: PC3-8500 DDR3 SO-DIMMs\n\n*Min. RAM Speed: 1066 MHz\n\n\nSo buying RAM that meets those specs is sufficient. As for buying \"Apple\" branded memory, it doesn't seem necessary. I always look to Mushkin, which sells \"Apple\" tested memory and have relied on them exclusively, but I have read others running Macs with Kingston, Crucial, or any one of the many other brands available without reporting issues.\nMatch the type and speed, and you shouldn't have any problem. Newegg has a 4GB package (2x2GB sticks) and a 8GB package (2x4GB sticks) for relatively cheap. They should give you an idea of what kind of prices to expect. Searching google yields quite a few results if you are interested in other brands or other configurations.\nLastly, consult iFixit for details on how to upgrade the memory for your specific model.\n", "Q: Where is nmblookup in Lion?

Check your $PATH to see if it has been included by typing echo $PATH at the system prompt.  If it does exist in your path, then you can run the command which nmblookup, as suggested by @Lyken.  Otherwise, to find a command that is not located in your path, type the following commands at the system prompt.\ncd /\nfind . -name \"<name>\" -print\n\nThere is also the whereis command, however, this only checks the standard binary directories for the specified program.\nThe alternative to nmblookup is nslookup.  This is also located under /usr/bin.\nNote that I am running Snow Leopard 10.6.8.\n\nA: If you must have nmblookup you may install samba3 via MacPorts and probably brew, I don't use brew so I'm not completely sure.\n", "Q: Windows 8 on the iPad?

With Lion, you can use screen sharing to connect to a \"virtual display\", meaning that you log in to a new session instead of 'hijacking' the currently active one.\nIs there a Windows program that can make use of this feature and let me start and operate a remote session on a Mac?\n\nA: Since RDC requires windows to be running, that's a non-starter unless you are running BootCamp or virtualization and don't care to see the OS X windows.\n\nOne big advantage of RDC / Terminal Services was the ability to log in a user that wasn't using the main screen. With Lion, this is now an option out of the box.\nDo note that on Lion, Remote Management behaves differently than Screen Sharing.  Enabling screen sharing seems to offer the most vanilla VNC-compatible stack. RealVNC seems to be the best client for working with 10.5 through 10.7, but I'm not often on windows lately.\nDo also read up on Are the changes to Lion's screen sharing documented anywhere publicly? for a discussion of the Lion specific changes. Especially Apple's latest ARD release notes.\n\nA third party VNC viewer will always be connected to the login window.\n  If the login window is not on the display, a new login window is\n  started that is not shown on the display. The screen sharing user can\n  then log in with any valid account on that computer.\n\nIt shows the intent that all VNC clients will get a login screen - and not hijack the current session (if there is a current non-login screen session)\n\nA: I think screen sharing in Lion is still based on the VNC protocol, so any VNC client should work.\nThere is a fairly comprehensive table on Wikipedia of VNC software, you can probably find a free Windows client that you can test this on.\nEdit: Based on the comments Screen Sharing looks to have changed quite a bit since the last version (where it was more or less vanilla VNC), so I'm changing this answer to a community wiki where we can all put up suggestions.\n\nA: I see some kind of ambiguity in answers here :-)\nI'd suggest to tell technologies and underlying protocols apart.\nVNC: uses RFB protocol.\nApple Screen Sharing [SS] (which is enabled by checking \"Screen Sharing\" in System Prefs): it is a vanilla VNC plus some Apple-specific extensions, e.g. pasteboard auto synchronization, display selection, screen locking, encryption, drag & drop and file transfer in latest servers. Another thing it has is the Apple-specific \"codec\", which is easy to recognize by JPEG-like artifacts. It also includes new authentication types (by username and password and by requesting permission from remote user) and the very feature you're discussing - Session Select, which allows you to log in as active user or to create invisible (\"virtual\") user session.\nApple Remote Desktop [ARD] (\"Remote Management\" in System Prefs): uses Apple Screen Sharing as a base for the screen sharing and another very different protocol (name it ARD protocol for instance) for computer management things, like performing spotlight searches, running shell commands, sending messages, transferring files and so on. \n@zneak asked for a client that supports Session Select feature. Unfortunately, as far as I can see, even Mac OS X clients rarely support Apple Screen Sharing features. These are: first, Apple’s built-in Screen Sharing client; next goes Remotix for Mac, which seems to support almost all of SS features including Session Select; JollysFastVNC which supports Apple authentication, display selection and screen locking, and Screens for Mac that supports only Apple authentication.\nAs for Windows, all I could find was already mentioned here Remotix for Windows, though it was marked as beta for a long time.\nProbably all these things are obvious for some of you, but I spent a good couple of hours sorting it out. Hope this post will save some time to someone :-)\n\nA: I just found a very cool solution.  It isn't perfect, but was very easy to set up and works for windows, mac and linux.  Google has released a remote desktop sharing client that is in beta.  It litereally took seconds to setup and I'm off running.  Give it a shot. Here's the link to the article.\n\nA: I have been furiously \"googling\" for the last hour and have finally found a solution.\nI have a Windows 7 PC in a corporate environment and need to be able to connect to a Mac running OSX 10.8.2.\nWhen using all other VNC methods, I would get prompted for a Mac username and password to get access to the box. This is very secure, but it doesn't help me to offer remote assistance to a colleague as I do not see there screen, I see my own loaded profile.\nThe solution is to use this software:\nhttp://www.nulana.com/remotix-windows\nIt has OSX authentication built in. Upon connection you get the option of logging on as yourself or viewing the users screen. \n\nA: I believe the initial question speaks of Mac emulation on a Windows box. Maybe an SSH connection could then spawn a Mac screen independent of the actual Mac screen so the box could be used remotely and locally at the same time.\nI do this currently with my Linux box.\nA good option to try would be NoMachine. I also use this with my Linux box and will give it a try on Mac soon.\n\nA: I was trying to figure out how to connect to my Macbook using \"Screen sharing\" from my windows PC.\nI was suffering the same problems as discussed here: any windows VNC client just shows a \"gray\" screen with no way to get to the actual screen.\nAfter some digging on the internet, tried {tight!real!any}VNC client, I figure out how to actually PASS THE LOGIN screen:\nJUST TYPE YOUR USERNAME and PASSWORD\nBum, the screen comes magically on the remote viewer!!!\nCaveats: you must set a vnc password in the Screen Sharing preference panel:\n- click on computer setting\n-select \"VNC viewers may control screen with password\" => insert the password\nIt then allows you to connect to the VNC server on your Lion PC. Once the \"gray\" screen is shown, type your username and pwd...\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Installing Windows 8 Preview on a Mac? I'm just wondering if anyone has figured this out yet.

I really like the \"Quick Event\" mask in iCal under OS X lion: insert event name, start time, date and you're ready! except for the fact that sometimes I'd like to add an event to a particular calendar instead of the default one! \nI've tried to add \"in *calendar_name*\" or \"calendar: *calendar_name*\" at the end of the sentence, but none of them works! \nIs there a way to achieve that?\n\nA: You can enter events to specific calendars by holding down the + button\nSee here the entry from iCal help:\n\nAdd events to a calendar\nYou can add any kind of event to your iCal calendars. For example, you can add meetings, doctor appointments, and family activities.\n  You can’t add events to a calendar you subscribed to.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open iCal\n  \n*Click Add (+) at the top of the iCal window or press Command (⌘)-N.\n  Events are added automatically to your default calendar.\nIf you want to choose a different calendar for the event, hold down the Add button (+), and then choose a calendar.\n  \n*To change your default calendar, choose iCal > Preferences, click General, and then select a calendar from the Default Calendar pop-up menu.\n  \n\n\nA: Unfortunately, no, you can not add Quick Events to specific calendar. \nIt seems the design conceit here is that having to think about which calendar you want to add the event to would make it not-quick.\nThat said, here are a few workarounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can change the calendar that your event is added to after you hit enter in the pop-up box. Unfortunately you can't do it from the keyboard. For some reason Apple does not allow you to tab into the calendar drop-down menu.\n\n*You can always switch your default calendar in iCal's preferences. If you are adding a bunch of events to a calendar and want to use the Quick Events box this might be an option for you. Unfortunately I looked at iCal does not have a AppleScript hook for changing this preference. You could use UI scripting but I find that fragile and annoying as it will often break with OS updates.\n\n\n*If you are a fan of natural language calendar entry you might want to take a look at Fantastical. It's very well designed, the natural language engine behind it is a bit more powerful than iCal's and it does allow you to tab into the calendar drop-down. You can also select a different calendar by adding /first letter of your calendar name. I have a feeling the small company behind Fantastical will be more responsive to a feature request than Apple would be though.\n\n\nA: This is the best work around I've been able to come up with: set the default calendar for new events to 'selected calendar', and select the required calendar in the calendar list either by moving through it with the arrow keys, or by jumping to a calendar by typing the first few letters of its name.\n\nA: The \"quick event\" feature simply drops a new entry in the default, so no.\n\nYou could do something like use a keyboard shortcut to trigger a automation made in Automator (or perhaps an AppleScript) that uses Universal Scripting and Watch Me Do to automate the clicks to change the preference for a calendar to your preferred \"alternate\" calendar.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a hot key and FastScripts to activate a new default calendar.\n\n*Use the quick event from iCal to drop events.\n\n*Optionally you'd have other hot keys to set other default calendars. \n\n\nThis is going to be a lot more hassle than just making an event the old way and choosing the calendar from the list or filing things that were initially in the \"tentative\" or whatever default calendar you have set up for you to catch all the events that come from Mail and \"quick event\".\n\nA: Open the inspector window, then double click wherever you want your event. Now edit the event in the inspector window and select calendar as desired.\nI use this solution because on my default calendar I automatically add four alarms but on my secondary calendar, which I use more as a diary, I don't want any alarms at all. When creating event with ⌘-n events where added to my main calendar and had four alarms added to them as well. When changing calendar the alarms remained and I had to manually remove them.

Now, I get worried that I left tons of support files and stuff in various Library folders. The reason I realized that is that, this morning, Office offered me to update “Open XML File Format Converter”, which I think is now a remnant of the past (and is not part of Office 2011 any more).\nSo, how can I remove old Office support files and directories, without hurting my current install of Office 2011? Where should I look?\n\nA: In general, when removing Office (or any application that comes with an uninstaller), it's advisable to use the uninstaller for the application, instead of just dragging things into the Trash. The best way to get a clean system would be to remove the old version completely, then install the new version. However, this is not an option for you any more, due to already having trashed (some of) the old files.\nThe files installed with every Office version are recorded in /var/db/receipts, in files starting with com.microsoft.office.*. There's a lot of those files, as Office comes in parts (Excel, Word, Proofing Tools, etc.) and also one for each update installed. The versions numbers in there are the \"raw\" office versions:\n\n\n*\n\n*14: Office for Mac 2011\n\n*12: Office 2008 for Mac\n\n*11: Office 2004 for Mac\n\n*10: Office v. X\n\n\nHowever it's not as simple as removing all files referenced by older packages, as some of them will be shared between them and doing so may leave your current Office install in a damaged state. Therefore the cleanest way to really remove all Office junk would be to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall what you can, using the uninstaller supplied (Microsoft Office Setup Assistant)\n\n*Remove the package receipts and the files they reference (but carefully, as many of them will reference system directories that should not be deleted unless empty). DesInstaller does this, but it hasn't been updated in a long time and I'm not sure if it still works on Lion.\n\n*Remove any leftovers, using either a cleaning tool such as CleanMyMac or the already mentioned AppCleaner, which work by looking for identifiers such as the com.apple.microsoft.office described earlier, or simply using mdfind or locate on the command line.\n\n*Reinstall Office for Mac 2011 - and before doing the next upgrade, use the uninstaller.\n\n\nA: have you installed \"Hazel\". Its a remarkable application which will do as you require plus much more.\n", "Q: Do I need to install the Boot Camp update in Mac OS X and Windows 7? I'm running Windows 7 on a Boot Camp partition on a 2010 Mac Pro running Lion. \nEvery so often I'm prompted to download and install the latest update to the Boot Camp software under Windows but this doesn't ever seem to update the installed version of Boot Camp. I also get prompted to do this when in OS X. \nShould I update both or one of them? And if the latter, should I do one before the other?\n\nA: I would update them both and I don't think you need to do one before the other. I have not had any problems updating one before the other and I manage large networks of Macs.\n\nA: I found a thread related to Display Drivers in Windows that stops the 3.2 and 3.3 Updates from installing correctly.\nThe core point is that if there are other display drivers showing in device manager other than the default display adapter (users reported issues and resolution after removing VNC or LogMeIn Mirror display adapters).\nThe original discussion is here Bootcamp 3.3 fails to install\n\nA: Boot Camp essentially consists of 2 functions.\nOne is the capability to provide for dual booting, doing the legwork required to get Windows to boot from the Mac EFI BIOS for want of a better description, performing the relevant partitioning etc (note you can do this yourself).  This portion is really the Boot Camp Assistant part, namely an executable Mac program.\nThe other part of a collection of drivers for Windows systems that allows your Windows install, once completed, to gain access to all the functions your hardware has to offer, so making sure your Facetime camera works, providing a sensible (well, sort of sensible it can be argued) keyboard mapping and trackpad driver, and various other bits and bobs.  For example a recent update in this area allowed bootcamp installations to not fall over and die at the sight of a Filevault 2 protexted Mac filesystem...\nWhen an update to bootcamp is available, it could be an update to the assistant program that you won't really need once you have already installed Windows, or updates to the driver packages etc.  Depending on what type of update, this may or may not increase the version number of the BC Assistant.  Some are large, some are small.  One Bootcamp assistant update did nothing except remove the Beta tag that it had when Tiger first introduced bootcamp.  Others are very large, such as the one that provided Windows 7 drivers for all your hardware.  Some are small but very important, such as the FileVault update.\nYou may as well update whenever you see one available.  if you are worried, give it a week and see if a poo storm erupts on the internet after release.\n", "Q: Can I manually limit the %CPU used by a process? I would like to limit the amount of CPU time dedicated to certain processes (e.g. Firefox, Safari, ...).\nI can't understand why such programs, even when not used (nothing loading, no animations, running in the background, ...), are so resource hungry. Why must a browser eat 50% or more of my CPU? Can I limit it to 10%?\n\nA: The link that Nicholas Smith posted doesn't work anymore. So I found one other app that does the trick for the people who are searching it again. the app calls Apppolice.\nhttp://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/49836/apppolice\n\nA: This is based off a previous answer, but adding the trap for ctrl+c to make sure the process being throttled gets left in a continue state, and adding  set -e so this script will exit cleanly if the process itself exits:\ntrap ctrl_c_fn INT\n\nfunction ctrl_c_fn() {\n    echo \"caught CTRL-C, exiting\"\n    kill -SIGCONT $pid\n    exit\n}\n\necho \"enter process id\"\nread pid\necho \"press Ctrl-C to exit\"\n\nset -e\n\nwhile true; do\n    kill -SIGSTOP $pid\n    sleep 0.009\n    kill -SIGCONT $pid\n    sleep 0.001\ndone\n\n\nA: There is a simple one-liner for doing all that:\nps axu | grep Chromium | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | sudo xargs -n 1 -I'{}' sh -c 'cputhrottle {} 10 &'\n\nWrite your app name instead of Chromium and desired percentage instead of 10 and you're good to go!\n\nA: Use cpulimit\nbrew install cpulimit\n\nand use as cpulimit -l (Number of threads x 100) -p (PID)\ncpulimit -l 200 -p 947\n\nwhere 200 means two threads.\n\nA: cputhrottle is the tool you need. You can install it with Homebrew.\nYou can monitor a series of processes by name by running the Bash script below. I'm not quite sure how to turn this into a login item since cputhrottle requires superuser permissions. Run it as a script, in an Automator workflow, whatever:\n# Get the Process/App names from Activity Monitor and put them here\napps=(\"AppOne\" \"AppTwo\" \"AppThree\")\n# Set the respective limits here\nlimits={30 40 50)\n\nwhile true; do\n  for app in ${apps}; do\n    for limit in ${limits}; do\n      for pid in $(pgrep ${app}); do\n        sudo /path/to/cputhrottle ${pid} ${limit}\n      done\n    done\n  done\ndone\n\n[Edited]\nI've added a different version for this script (a bash script), which might be useful for people looking for limiting the CPU for multiple applications.\nThis new script also allows you to specify a list containing the application name and the CPU limit for it.\nThe main difference is that you can add cpu limit per application, and it will run only once per application. I've also added the option for killing all cputhrottle processes.\nThe script assumes that both cputhrottle and pidof are installed before running it.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [[ $EUID > 0 ]]; then\n  echo \"Please run this script as root/sudo\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\n# Pass --kill as argument to kill all running cputhrottles\nif [ $1 = \"--kill\" ]; then  \n  echo \"Looking for running cputhrottles...\"\n  pids=`pidof cputhrottle`\n  for pid in ${pids}; do\n    echo \"> Killing PID ${pid}\"\n    sudo kill ${pid}\n  done\n  echo \"Done!\"\n  exit 0\nfi\n\ndeclare -a applications\n\n# Syntax='application;max-cpu'\napplications[0]='Chrome;40'\napplications[1]='Firefox;50'\napplications[2]='pycharm;40'\napplications[3]='webstorm;40'\napplications[4]='Safari;35'\n\nfor i in \"${applications[@]}\"; do\n  app=(${i//;/ })\n  app_name=${app[0]}\n  cpu_limit=${app[1]}\n\n  printf \"\\nLooking for ${app_name}...\\n\"\n  pids=`pidof ${app}`\n  for pid in ${pids}; do\n    echo \"> PID=${pid}, CPU=${cpu_limit}\"\n    sudo cputhrottle ${pid} ${cpu_limit} &\n  done\ndone\n\nprintf \"\\nDone!\\n\"\necho \"Run this script passing '--kill' as argument to remove all cputhrottles.\"\n\nSource:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://gist.github.com/golimpio/692145a19666582f84e0e66bb5dd2b2b\n\nA: this sh worked for me\necho \"enter process id\"\nread pid\necho \"press Ctrl-C to exit\"\n\nwhile true; do\n    kill -SIGSTOP $pid\n    sleep 0.009\n    kill -SIGCONT $pid\n    sleep 0.001\ndone\n\n\nA: The script Dimitri wrote does work well (on macOS), but it keeps running with errors after the application is closed. I changed it to make it finish (with an error message about PID not found):\necho \"enter process id\"\nread pid\necho \"press Ctrl-C to exit\"\n\nwhile kill -SIGSTOP $pid; do\n    sleep 0.009\n    kill -SIGCONT $pid\n    sleep 0.001\ndone\n\n\nA: I just found CPUSetter, which, for me, is better than any of the previous options.\nThis app comes with additional control over hyperthreading, number of used cores, preference of physical CPU and separate power-related settings.\n\nA: This is my final script, keep clean the command cputhrottle\nonly execute new one if doesn't exist\n#!/bin/bash\n\n###\n# setup cputhrottle if doesn't exists\n###\nset_service_cpu_limit(){\n    service_pid=$(pgrep $1)\n    limit=$2\n    if [[ ! -z $service_pid  ]]; then\n        service_cpu=$(ps aux | grep \"sudo cputhrottle $service_pid $limit\" | grep -v grep | wc -l)\n        if [[ ! $service_cpu -gt 0 ]]; then\n            sudo cputhrottle $service_pid $limit &\n        fi\n    fi\n}\n\n###\n# main loop\n###\nwhile true; do\n    set_service_cpu_limit bzfilelist 2\n    set_service_cpu_limit bztransmit 2\n    sleep 0.5\ndone\n\n\nA: I use AppPolice. It is a bit unstable and clunky but since there are no other options and the problems are minor I think it is a decent solution. Works on Catalina.\n\nA: You can indeed! There's CPUThrottle, which allows to specify a PID to restrict.\nNote, they're trying to use that much for a reason, it's a useful tool but whether it'll make it better or worse for you on a day to day will be something you discover.\n\nA: Its not exactly what you wanted, but, in regards of google drive and chrome this what did the trick for me:\nGoogle Drive (\"Backup and Sync\") \n\n\n*\n\n*de-prioritize:\nfor f in $(pgrep 'Backup and Sync'; pgrep 'FinderSyncAPIExtension'); do renice +20 -p $f; done\n\n\n*set back to normal:\nfor f in $(pgrep 'Backup and Sync'; pgrep 'FinderSyncAPIExtension'); do renice 0 -p $f; done\n\nChrome \n\n\n*\n\n*de-prioritize all current processes:\nfor f in $(pgrep 'Chrome'); do renice +20 -p $f; done\n\n\n*set back to normal all current processes:\nfor f in $(pgrep 'Chrome'); do renice 0 -p $f; done\n\n\nA: Although not a direct answer to the OP's question, if you're having an issue with a particular process taking up too much of your CPU time, and making your computer unusable, and you don't mind how long that process takes to finish the task it's working on, you can use the renice to alter the priority of that process, making it behave nicely (hence the name). \nFirst, you need to find the PID of the process that's using up the CPU resources. You can either do that in Activity Monitor, or in Terminal.app with the ps command - e.g. to find the PID of the Safari browser, type: \nMacBook:~  ps -ef | grep Safari\n  501 17452   263   0 11:36pm ??         4:15.60 /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/Safari\n\nThe second line above is the output, and the PID is 17452 in this particular case. \nThen, the next task is to change the priority of the process (let's say it's Safari we want to make behave nicely). To do this, in Terminal.app type: \nMacBook:~  renice -n 10 -p 17452\n\nThe -n option changes the nice level by adding 10 to the current value (0 by default). The range of values are -20 to 20, with lowest value meaning highest priority. As an ordinary user, you can use values 0 to 20. To assign a negative value, you need to have root privileges (e.g. use sudo command). Read more about nice and renice by typing man nice and man renice in Terminal.app.\nnice and renice don't limit the percentage of the CPU available to a given application per se, they do however allow to change the scheduling priority, or in other words how much of the CPU time a process will get. This is all relative to the CPU load on your system, so if the system is under utilised, you most likely won't see any difference. \n\nA: cputhrottle (refer to fny and Nicholas Smith's answers) works on macOS 10.15 as long as you sign the executable.\nYou can do so simply and quickly by following the steps listed here: https://web.archive.org/web/20191223180139/https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/PermissionsDarwin\nYou can download cputhrottle here: http://www.willnolan.com/cputhrottle/cputhrottle.html\n\nA: This script is what I use: this code runs the app at full speed when the screen is locked else it runs at about 50% of the speed. On my M1 Pro MacBook Pro this works great for an app that normally takes 800% CPU. The computer remains responsive while the app is running in background.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nPID=$1\n\nif [ \"$PID\" == \"\" ]; then\n    echo \"no process id given!

That's great, and if AppPolice meets your needs, you can be happy!\nBut if you use your computer professionally, the time you've lost on processes sucking down resources is probably vastly higher than the tiny cost of AppTamer.\nAll the options that AppTamer offers that AppPolice does not are there for a reason.\nAppPolice requires you to configure each process individually. The only thing it can do globally is stop throttling.  (Which could be done by closing it anyway.)\nAppTamer on the other hand can distinguish before foreground and background apps, so that you can throttle an app in the background but give it full power in the foreground. Browsers, for example.\n\n", "Q: Cisco Smart Tunnel crashes Safari. Can it be made to work on Mac OS X? I deal with a customer who has provided me a SSL VPN address.  When I log in it downloads a .jnlp file, and then some files are created in /tmp.\nThe meat of how it works, is it tries to run Safari with a downloaded library included:\nDYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/tmp/narwhal.dylib /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/Safari\n\nSafari soon crashes with a segfault:\nPlugIn Path:       /tmp/narwhal.dylib\nCrashed Thread:  3  Dispatch queue: com.apple.networking.connection.0x7fe0d0468fc0\nException Type:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)\nException Codes: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x0000000000000068\nOS Version:      Mac OS X 10.7.1 (11B26)\n\n(See the full stack trace.)\nThe only other mention I can find of this error is on the Apple forum, which suggests it worked in 10.5.8 but not 10.6 or later.  I have a colleague that is running 10.6.8 and it works for him.  I am running Lion (10.7.1). Running Safari in 32 bit mode does not seem to make a difference, nor whether I prefer 32- or 64-bit Java.\nMy end goal is \"connect to the SSL VPN\".  The administrators of the server aren't able to support Mac users.  I can connect fine with Windows.\nIs there a way to fix this, or perhaps take the details from the .jnlp file, and use a different Cisco client, which works on Mac OS X? \n\nA: As of May 30, 2012, Smart Tunnel on OS X 10.7 is officially not supported by Cisco and it looks like it won't be an easy fix to support it because it shares many attributes of the Flasback Trojan. I use VMware Fusion to run a Windows VM on my Mac for just this sort of thing. \n", "Q: How can I forcibly shut down my Mac at an appointed time? I'm looking for an auto shutdown app that will forcefully shut down the computer at an appointed time.\nThe most important part of this is that the shutdown should not be cancelable (unless the process is extremely onerous).\n\nA: This can be scheduled in System Preferences > Energy Saver > Schedule. I'm not certain that this will initiate a forced shutdown, you'd have to try it out. But that's a built in option to automate scheduled power down/up.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can also forcibly shutdown the system with a terminal command (requires root):\nshutdown -h now\nYou could put that command into a launchd or cron scheduled task.

Even though the Mac thinks that the screen works properly (I can move the cursor out of the Mac's screen), the external monitor's led blinks as there was no signal at all. Changing screen resolution doesn't help.\nI've browsed many similar questions on the internet, unfortunately most of them suggest upgrading the OS. I'm using Mac OSX 10.6.8 Snow Leopard. What should I do?\n\nA: This most likely means the Mac is outputting a video mode that the screen can't display.  Try reducing the resolution and Refresh Rate (in System Preferences -> Display) until you get something on the screen, then work your way up the list again. A good starting point would be 1024x768 or even 640x480.\nThe other possibility would be that the signal isn't arriving intact, either due to a cable/plug fault or that the screen or Mac have a hardware fault (which you can rule out by connecting the Mac to another DVI screen with the same adapter and by connecting the monitor to another computer).\n\nA: I've had the problem as well and only by resetting my monitor am I able to get it to work.\nOther posts suggesting it is something to do with the PRAM, but I've not seen the problem being on the Mac end of things. As this problem is persistent, so it seems I will have to reset the monitor each time so it recovers from the failure, but doesn't seem to address the root cause so I have yet to find a more permanent fix. \n\nA: Problem\nThe display worked before. Then without reason it gone black and didn't wanted to show anything. DisplayManager from Mac showed the displays without problem and I could change all settings - for no difference.\nSolution:\nRemove everything (in my case ethernet and 2 USB devices) from the adapter und replugged the HDMI.\nAfter that it worked again. And could connect the other cables again aswell.\nMy setup\nMacBookPro 15\" and 3x HP_Z32n via a QacQoc adapter from HDMI to USB-C. I have 3 external displays connected and use the internal one aswell.\n\n\nA: I solved my problem so far by installing this app (Display Menu) from the Mac AppStore.\nThe screen flashed and I got image.\nIt might not work for you, but worth the try.\n\nA: I had the same problem. I reset my monitor to the factory setting and this solved the problem.\n\nA: I had the same problem, and I think I found what causes the problem. My macbook air was detecting the display, but only thing I saw was black screen.\nEither your monitor is using VGA signal even if you are using DVI cable or you are using DVI to VGA adapter in between. MiniDP to DVI only produces digital signal.\nFor more information check a blog post of mine.\n\nA: Same problem here. Using dell 1920x1200 monitor connected to RMBP 2013 in clamshell mode with nvidia card. \nIf I open RMBP and check the display preferences, it shows TWO display settings, one for the built-in and one for the 1920 monitor. I can change the res. But external stays black all the way. Log out and log in again does not help.\nRebooting the RMBP helps right away. No need to mess with the monitor or cables. This is purely a software problem in the RMBP.\n\nA: I had a black screen for quite some minutes now and I found out that the monitor, even though it is brand new, does not automatically switch to the active input channel. So choosing the input channel manually on the monitor fixed the problem for me.\n\nA: Try another HDMI cable. That's what worked for me. I first had a 'normal' one which didn't work.

I believe what's happening is it's losing WiFi and killing the Air Play connection.\nAny solutions for playing an evening's worth of music through Air Play from my pocket, without pulling the phone out and restarting it every few minutes?\nEDIT: I should have mentioned, this phone is not jailbroken and I'd prefer not to jailbreak it. I'm a developer and my phone is one of my testing devices. I need to be able to test it in the conditions most users will be in.\n\nA: If you can avoid bumping the sleep/wake button, you should have hours of playing time using AirPlay. Once the screen is dimmed due to a time-out, you can press sleep/wake to show the current track, just avoid pressing it to force an immediate sleep/screen dim. Let the timer do the work to ensure music playback.\nI have Auto-Lock set at 5 minutes (with no passcode lock) and often set down my iPhone on the counter or place it in my pocket while I walk around the house, playing music until a low battery warning pauses playback. If you have to, shorten this setting during the party to avoid uncomfortable musical silences.\n\nA: There is an app in Cydia called Insomnia which keeps the wifi alive even when the iDevice is locked. Try jailbreaking - if you haven't already - and install it. Works great!\n", "Q: Lots of inactive memory after watching HD/DVD movies I'm the owner of mid 2010 iMac (core i7) with 16GB memory installed.Normally, Mac OS X (SL and Lion) never uses swap (that is page ins/outs = 0), there are always 3-8GB of free memory. But after watching a few DVD/h264 movies, there are only 50-100*MB* of free memory and swap is used actively. Looks like video files are mapped into system memory, since the amount of inactive memory ~= size of files. The only workaround is to use purge utility.\nI'm looking for a solution which is better than running purge every time I looked a movie.\nuptime:\n4:08  up 3 days,  7:35, 5 users, load averages: 0,71 0,76 0,71\n\nvm_stat:\nMach Virtual Memory Statistics: (page size of 4096 bytes)\nPages free:                         738409.\nPages active:                      1715722.\nPages inactive:                     536891.\nPages speculative:                  857329.\nPages wired down:                   344323.\n\"Translation faults\":           1067897384.\nPages copy-on-write:               6068992.\nPages zero filled:               591232281.\nPages reactivated:                 1906255.\nPageins:                           5019598.\nPageouts:                           861857.\nObject cache: 16 hits of 1354202 lookups (0% hit rate)\n\n\nA: What you're seeing is normal, and desired behavior.\nOS X, like Linux and BSD, has a disk cache. This means anything read from or written to disk is kept in memory. The \"Inactive\" memory includes this disk cache.\nThis answer on AskDifferent explains it, as does this post on macosxhints.com:\n\nHowever, X's underpinnings (ie the UN*X kernel) provide both these\n  features without any inputs being needed by the user. It's called the\n  file system buffer cache. The one most significant difference is that\n  the size of this buffer cache is dynamic. It starts of with some small\n  size and can grow and shrink as the i/o demands and Apps memory\n  requirements vary over time. \nIt's called a 'buffer cache' because it buffers the i/o data on its\n  way to/from the disk. When an App writes data it first will be\n  deposited into the Apps file buffer memory region and will\n  subsequently be requested via library routines to have the kernel (the\n  OS) copy it from the App's buffer to disk. The kernel will oblige and\n  will copy it first to its buffer -- the file system buffer cache. If\n  the kernel requires more room in its buffer cache it will obtain it\n  from the free memory. When this happens the free memory value, in say\n  the Terminal's top command, will immediately show a reduction of free\n  memory. At some later point the kernel will copy this data (referred\n  to has dirty buffers) to the appropriate disk location. I believe the\n  frequency of this being done is 30 secs -- called sync-ing to disk.\n\nNote that having memory paged out to disk is not always a bad thing. If memory pages are completely inactive, paging them out to disk can improve performance, because they are wasting RAM which could otherwise be used for disk cache. Once they are paged out and you stop watching movies, when needed they will be paged back in, automatically replacing the buffers and disk cache. You don't need to run purge each time. Just let OS X manage the disk cache as it was designed to do.\nFor more information on this, consult the wikipedia article on paging, and the article on the Page cache.\n\nTL;DR information:\nHere's an article describing how swap works under Linux. WHile not 100% applicable to OS X, the concept is the same. I'll quote the relevant part:\n\nWhen an application needs memory and all the RAM is fully occupied,\n  the kernel has two ways to free some memory at its disposal: it can\n  either reduce the disk cache in the RAM by eliminating the oldest data\n  or it may swap some less used portions (pages) of programs out to the\n  swap partition on disk. It is not easy to predict which method would\n  be more efficient. The kernel makes a choice by roughly guessing the\n  effectiveness of the two methods at a given instant, based on the\n  recent history of activity\n\nSince you're watching a DVD or a movie, the most recently active pages of memory are the disk cache, so OS X decides to keep that in RAM and swap out pages of memory which have been inactive from before you started accessing the video files. Once you stop accessing video files and access the programs using the memory pages which were swapped out, the reverse is true: OS X will discard the disk cache containing the video data and replace it with the memory pages which it swapped out. Then your swap usage will decrease.\nHere's a bit more information, specific to FreeBSD (which is similar to Mac OS X):\n\nFreeBSD will use 'all of memory' for the disk cache. What this means \n  is that the 'free' bucket typically contains only a few pages in it. \n  If the system runs out, it can free up more pages from the cache\n  bucket.\nSystem activity works like this: When a program actively references  a\n  page in a file on the disk (etc...) the page is brought into the \n  buffer cache via a physical I/O operation. It typically goes into  the\n  'active' bucket. If a program stops referencing the page, the  page\n  slowly migrates down into the inactive or cache buckets (depending  on\n  whether it is dirty or not). Dirty pages are slowly 'cleaned' by \n  writing them to their backing store and moved from inactive to cache, \n  and cache pages are freed as necessary to maintain a minimum number of\n  truely free pages in the free bucket. These pages can still be \n  'cleaned' by allocating swap as their backing store, allowing them  to\n  migrate through the buckets and eventually be reused.\n[...]\nThe VM buffer cache caches everything the underlying storage so, for \n  example, it will not only cache the data blocks associated with a file\n  but it will cache the inode blocks and bitmap blocks as well. Most \n  filesystem operations thus go very fast even for tripple-indirect\n  block  lookups and such\n[...]\nFreeBSD has arguably some of the best swap code in existance. I\n  personally  like it better then Linux's. Linux is lighter on swap, but\n  doesn't  balance system memory resource utilization well under varying\n  load  conditions. FreeBSD does.\nFreeBSD notes the uselessness of existing pages in memory, and decides\n  that it might be advantageous to free memory (enabled by pushing pages\n  to swap), so that it can be used for more active purposes (such as\n  file  buffering, or more program space.) It is a terrible waste to\n  keep unused  pages around, for the notion of saving (cheap) disk\n  space. Since low  level SWAP I/O can be faster, with less CPU overhead\n  than file I/O, it  is likely desireable to push such unused pages out\n  so that they can be  freed for use by higher overhead mechanisms.\n  (note 1)\n\n(Emphasis mine, check that bolded part for specifically what you're asking about, that is, \"Why is swap being used when I have inactive memory?)\n\nA: For what I know (and have noticed) you don't have to worry about this \"inactive\" memory. The system will reallocate it on demand. It happens when the system have huge file transfer to process. This kind of operation use as much memory as possible to speed up the process. When the transfer is finished, the memory state remains as \"inactive\", but you could as well considered as free...\n", "Q: OS X Lion: Authorization Plugins I tried to install an authorization plugin on mac OS X 10.7 that previously worked on Snow Leopard but all I'm getting is a white screen with the cursor.

I have MacBook Pro. I am used to using windows/dell laptop/ibm thinkpad laptop.  \nI am not being able to understand the mouse. It is one big rectangle with a slightly elevated small rectangle below it. What is the purpose of these 2 each? Right now, both serve as a left click. How do I simulate right click?\nWhen I wanted to click a new link in new tab, earlier I would just right click and select open in new tab. In MacBook Pro, how do I achieve it? I can do it by clicking command+ left-click. but what if I just want to be able to achieve it by only right hand and not have to use both the hands to achieve something as basic as this.\nThanks,\nUpdate\nI just found out that tapping with 2 fingers will simulate right click and it is working. But is that the only solution, because I am finding it very cumbersome to switch between one finger and 2 fingers tapping.\nHow long new users usually take to get used to this concept?\nUpdate\nI am able to tweak time response of touchpad as you mentioned above. I also notice that while typing (say blogging etc), if I have to go a few words back, my keyboard response to <-- key is very slow. So either I use mouse to click at desired place or wait for <-- key to reach to the place. This key response is noticeably slower than what I am used to in ibm thinkpad/dell etc. My CPU is of decent configuration, so I don't think the system speed should be a hurdle here. Any way to configure keys response time too??\n\nA: You should be able to fine tune the behavior of your track-pad with the System Preferences panel (see Mouses, TrackPad and Keyboard).\nIf it's not enough, then you should have a look at Better Touch Tool. (It's free)\n\nA: You can activate a secondary click (\"right click\") by holding down control and clicking. In Lion (10.7), you can use System Preferences to configure the trackpad to use the two-finger tap, or either of the bottom two corners of the trackpad as secondary click areas. I don't have a Snow Leopard machine near me to verify what options are available in that version of the operating system. If your Macbook Pro supports multitouch (your description of the hardware sounds like it is not the latest generation, and I don't know how old yours is), there are third-party add-ons like Better Touch Tool that give you more options.\n\nA: As you already discovered, 2-finger tap on MacBook's trackpad is equivalent of a right mouse click. You'll get used to 2-finger taps very quickly.\nAlso holding ctrl while clicking simulates right click, but again - requires a second hand (doable with one, but not too convenient).\nIt's worth noting that OS X Lion is full of multitouch gestures - two, three and four finger swipes that do magic. I suggest you get familiar with gestures by accessing System Preferences > Trackpad.\n\nA: To repsond to your updated question of adjustment - I find that the two finger tap is more natural when used in conjunction with the two-figure scroll gesture.  That way, your right click and your scroll are the same fingers, and you have to spend less time trying to get the right number of fingers on the trackpad.\nTo enable the gesture (if you haven't already) just go into System Preferences -> Trackpad & check the box to enable it.\n", "Q: How can I Transfer Dashboard Information from one computer to another? How is it possible to transfer all my information from dashboard(in stickies) to my new macbook pro? Is there an easy file just to transfer or do I have to copy and paste them to an email? Also I have 10.6 running on my macbook and 10.7 on my new macbook pro if this makes a difference in how you can transfer them. \n\nA: All of the preferences/info from Apple supplied Dashboard widgets resides in ~/Library/Preferences. Do a search for anything beginning with widget-com.apple.widget - those are all your widgets. \nFor stickies specifically, copy widget-com.apple.widget.stickies.plist to the ~/Library/Preferences folder in your new machine, and you'll be all set.\n\nA: While it is true that ~/Library/Preferences/widget-com.apple.widget.stickies.plist contains the data associated with each widget, the file ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dashboard.plist contains information that causes the individual sticky widgets to be displayed.\nIf you hope to transfer stickies from one machine to another, both of these files will need to be copied. Note that this will clobber all the widgets on the target machine, not just Stickies. If this is not the desired behavior, some judicious plist editing could merge in just the entries for Stickies.\n\nA: Why not just use the User Migration Assistant? It will transfer everything over from your account on the old machine.\nOne bit of advice: If your account name on the old machine is the same as your account name on the new machine, it may not transfer. I'd recommend creating and logging on to a temporary administrator account (in System Preferences -> Accounts), rename your account on the new machine if necessary, and run the user migration assistant from the temporary admin account.\n\nA: How many stickies do you have? Why not just copy the text out of the stickies and email it to yourself? Then check your email on the new machine and copy the text back into a new set of stickies.\n", "Q: Can't connect to app store after installing VPN software I started experiencing problems after playing with hotspotshield.com,\nit may have done something to the core apple connection preferences.\nI have looked all over the internet and I can't find a solution..\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are my specs - Lion 10.7.1\n\ndo you have any other connectivity issues and did you knowingly change any network configurations when you were using hotspotshield?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*I had no other connectivity issues beforehand and no i didn't change any network settings to my knowledge.\n\n*I've tried connecting thru Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and iPhone USB tethering.

I have not yet had to recover from Lion, so I don't really know what you are going to find.\n\nA: You can't install lion from dvd or usb; 10.7 lion has to be installed from a HDD that has a partition that lets you goto internet recovery.(pressing cmd+alt+r)\nin your case you HDD is clean... you must now install os x 10.6.8 first (you can still buy the snow leopard dvd from the online store) and install lion from the app store afterwards.\nhope this helps !\n", "Q: What SMS apps exist on the iPhone that support ascii emoticons, not emoji? This is an open question, but it is a logical followup of my previous question asking for an emoticon keyboard app.\nIt appears it is not possible to define a system-wide keyboard that supports ASCII emoticons. Instead, specific applications can provide a custom keyboard or another way to easily input emoticons.\nSo what replacements for the SMS app do provide shortcuts to input ASCII emoticons? For use by people unfamiliar by all those weird punctuations.\nI am looking for something similar to the Messaging keyboard on Android. (Thanks to VxJasonxV)\nThe app should not require a jailbreak.\nBonus points for apps that also display ASCII emoticons graphically.\nUPDATE: Now iOS does allow system-wide third party keyboards, so this question is no longer really relevant. However I keep it alive because the answer \"no third party app can do SMS\" is still correct and useful.\n\nA: Apple does not allow SMS nor Phone replacement apps in the App Store, so this will never be possible without jailbreaking. Since you indicated you would prefer not to jailbreak, you will not be able to do this.\nThe closest you will be able to get would be to use a third-party SMS service which may either cost or perhaps force you into using a different phone number for SMS specifically with that app. You will need to review third-party apps available to see if they provide a custom keyboard to do what you wish to do.\nLong story short: Built-in? Not possible outside of jmlumpkin's suggestion.\n\nA: I don't know if this is entirely what you are looking for, but it looks like the iPhone does actually have something 'like' this - I guess they are a bit more elaborate than smileys:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/knc2j/i_was_messing_around_on_my_iphone_when_i_found/\nGo to Settings -> General -> Keyboard -> International Keyboards -> Add New Keyboard... ->  Japanese Ten Key\nthen, click the 'globe' icon when the keyboard is up, and you should see some (look at the picture linked to on reddit for examples)\n", "Q: DefaultKeyBinding.dict - old-style NeXT format vs XML plist format DefaultKeyBinding.dict\nThe ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict file lets you define your own key bindings in Mac OS X. It can be in one of two formats: old-style NeXT format (example) or modern-style XML plist format (example).\nRebinding ⌘+⌫\nI wanted to rebind command-backspace (⌘+⌫) to deleteWordBackward:, and I got some help over in this AskDifferent thread. It was suggested that I use this as my DefaultKeyBinding.dict file: \n/* my keybindings */\n{\n\"@\\U007F\" = \"deleteWordBackward:\"; /* delete backwards one word */\n}  \n\nThis advice worked (thanks, guys!), but I already have a working DefaultKeybinding.dict in the XML format, so I wanted to try to get it working that way. I first added just this text near the bottom of my existing file:\n<key>@\\U007F</key>\n<string>deleteWordBackward:</string>\n\nAnd I also tried creating a brand-new XML-formatted file with just the  ⌘+⌫ entry: \n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>@\\U007F</key>\n    <string>deleteWordBackward:</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nBut neither files worked. The apparent situation, then, is that you can rebind ⌘+⌫ only in the old-style NeXT format, and not in the XML plist format. My questions are: \n\n\n*\n\n*Is this accurate, or should the syntax change somehow when I'm switching to XML format? \n\n*Will I regret moving the rest of my DefaultKeyBinding.dict file over to the old syntax? It wouldn't be much work to do so - it's only one or two dozen entries - but I'm not sure if the old style is deprecated or ill-advised for some other reason. \n\n\nEdit: Original DefaultKeyBinding.dict\nSomeone requested information on my original file in the comments, so I figure I might as well include the whole thing here. \n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key></key>\n    <string>complete:</string>\n    <key>^ </key>\n    <string>setMark:</string>\n    <key>^a</key>\n    <string>moveToBeginningOfLine:</string>\n    <key>^e</key>\n    <string>moveToEndOfLine:</string>\n    <key>^j</key>\n    <string>setMark:</string>\n    <key>^v</key>\n    <string>pageDown:</string>\n    <key>^w</key>\n    <string>deleteToMark:</string>\n    <key>^x</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>^m</key>\n        <string>selectToMark:</string>\n        <key>^x</key>\n        <string>swapWithMark:</string>\n    </dict>\n    <key>~</key>\n    <string>deleteWordBackward:</string>\n    <key>~&lt;</key>\n    <string>moveToBeginningOfDocument:</string>\n    <key>~&gt;</key>\n    <string>moveToEndOfDocument:</string>\n    <key>~^h</key>\n    <string>deleteWordBackward:</string>\n    <key>~b</key>\n    <string>moveWordBackward:</string>\n    <key>~d</key>\n    <string>deleteWordForward:</string>\n    <key>~f</key>\n    <string>moveWordForward:</string>\n    <key>~n</key>\n    <string>scrollLineDown:</string>\n    <key>~p</key>\n    <string>scrollLineUp:</string>\n    <key>~v</key>\n    <string>pageUp:</string>\n    <key>~</key>\n    <string>deleteWordBackward:</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\n\nA: I don't think you'll have any issues using the older format.  All the examples I've found use the old NeXT notation.  Although I can't explain why the XML format didn't work, there is a workaround for this particular keyboard shortcut which would mean you can leave your existing DefaultKeyBinding.dict untouched.  \nThere is an application called KeyRemap4MacBook which is free to download and you can see from the screenshot below, you could remap the ⌘+⌫ keyboard shortcut without converting the rest of your DefaultKeyBinding.dict file and this method is not limited to Cocoa applications.  \n\n\nA: \\U007f can't be used on XML property lists. You'd need to replace it with &#x007f; or a literal DEL character.\n\nYou can convert an old-style plist to XML with plutil:\nplutil -convert xml1 test.plist\n\nAnd from XML to old-style with pl:\npl -input test.plist\n\n\nMy DefaultKeyBinding.dict is currently 151 lines, and I haven't run into any issues storing it as an old-style property list. The ones posted by Brett Terpstra and Jacob Rus are in the old-style format as well.\n", "Q: Spotlight pop-up effects I saw someone with a Macbook Pro using the Spotlight feature several times, and every time the Spotlight opened, it used a certain effect that's not like what I see in other Macs (I use Leopard). \nThe effect I'm talking about is like a vanishing \"teleport\" effect, it opens up starting with a thin, long horizontal bright line which shortens and expands in height until it reveals the Spotlight. To see a similar effect, use a recent version of Safari with several tabs open, and drag one of the tabs down as if you're going to break it off into a new window.\nDoes this effect happen to be OS based, or exist from a third-party tool (Something like Compiz, but for Mac)?\n\nA: It sounds to me like you may be describing Quicksilver, which is, among other things, an application launcher.\nhttp://qsapp.com/index.php\nI use it daily and it can look very much the way you have just described.

I formatted the new 100Gb to FAT 32. \nWhen I restarted my computer, I received the \"No bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key\" error. I restarted and logged into Lion and the Startup Disk utility still recognized the boot camp install but I still couldn't restart into Windows. I was still able to see the content of the files in the Boot Camp partition via Finder. I tried running from Windows 7 DVD and repairing, but Windows repair didn't recognize any installs.\nIn the Disk Utility, I deleted the new partition I created (100gb).

I never updated because my optical drive went out and I never got it fixed. I called Apple and they said that I could upgrade to Snow Leopard, but not Lion.  So I have purchased Snow Leopard, but don't know how to load it.  Here's what I've tried:\n1) Remote Install- from an imac and mac mini.  It won't recognize the connection.\n2) I made an .iso of my Snow Leopard disc in disc utility.  I put it on a flash drive and tried to boot.

I suppose when it reboots, it loses the mount and doesn't begin the installation.  \nLong story short, any suggestions?\n\nA: You will need a USB drive (8GB) and access to another Mac. You can use any external drive instead of a USB drive, but be aware that you'll have to format the drive and you'll loose any content on it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert the Snow Leopard DVD and the USB drive into a Mac with a working optical drive\n\n*Start 'Disk Utility'.

On the non-install machine, pop in a Snow Leopard DVD and restart while holding down the T key with both machines connected via FireWire.  If you just have an ISO, create a new partition on the non-install machine and copy the iso to that partition via Disk Utility. \n\nA: If you don't have access to another Mac, but you have access to a PC with an internal DVD drive, you can share that drive with your Mac using the remote disk feature (see Use the CD or DVD drive from another computer with your Mac).

This would create new preferences, eliminating an \"bad, old preferences\" that may have been the cause of the slow down.\nRe-installing will take more time, and apps like those from Adobe that require key #s are going to be a pain, but the end result of a properly performing Mac is your goal.\nThe problem with Migration is that it can bring the problems with it, as you have seen.\nThe problem with re-installing is that you will never know which caused the problem.  You won't be able to avoid creating the problem again.  It may not have been anything you did, but a built-in glitch that is going to occur whenever a particular set of apps and actions are present.\nPerhaps a faster way to solve the problem of what causes the slow down:\nMake sure all 3rd party apps are in the Applications folder, or have aliases there, so all User accounts have access to them.  Then log out of your account and into another account and test for performance problems.  I have an account called \"Test\" (non-Admin) just for this purpose.  This account will have its own preferences for those apps, different than yours.\nNow, in that Test account, start using the apps and your Mac, watching for slow-downs.\nWhatever you do to solve this, please come back and report it- what worked and what didn't.

Disconnect the device and put it in DFU (Deep Firmware Update) mode. This will force the phone into a recovery state (note this results in a different restore than using the option found with iTunes). Connect the device to iTunes again and it will notify you that the device is in recovery mode. From there, following the prompts and install the latest firmware (4.3.5). Activate the phone once the process is complete, but do not restore the device or set it up as a new iPhone just yet. Try making a call. If the receiver still doesn't work, then it is a hardware failure.\nI strongly encourage you to bring it to an Apple Store (not a certified Apple repair store) and talk a Genius on hand. If it is still under warranty, they will happily fix it. If it is out of warranty, they will diagnose the fault and give you a quote for the price of repair.\nSometimes, depending on how long it's been since the warranty has expired, they will either repair it for free regardless, or fix it for free should you purchase Apple Care (which adds an additional year to the warranty).\nApple's customer service is truly amazing.

I have it there, but maybe it's because I've bought Xcode 4.0 when it was released and there was no Lion yet.\n\nA: it's available!\nhttp://adcdownload.apple.com/Developer_Tools/xcode_3.2.6_and_ios_sdk_4.3__final/xcode_3.2.6_and_ios_sdk_4.3.dmg\nXCode for Mac Snow Leopard\n", "Q: How to safely charge your apple device at a charging station? Recently there has been alot of news about how free charging stations could be reading data from devices that are plugged into them. The obvious solution to this issue is to place an adaptor between the charging station and the device that is only wired to transmit power.\nI would sugest that the ideal design of would be a USB micro female to Apple dock male connector. This could be small enough to be carried around in a wallet and as USB micro is the current device charging standard compatability would be good.\nThis would also have an impact for non Apple devices where a USB micro passthrough addaptor could be used.\nDoes anyone know of any such device on the market?\nThis article is the inspiration behind my question.\n\nA: I know of no device that is sold to act as a write block that also allow full 1A charging, but Apple's patent covering potential upcoming changes to the dock connector might help you if you wanted a DIY hardware solution for the older 30 pin USB connectors. \nIn the mean time, you have several ways to secure the data without needing a custom piece of hardware.\n\n\n*\n\n*Lock your iOS device with a passcode before connecting it. This ensures the data is encrypted. \n\n*You could go a step further and be ready to power off the device as soon as it's connected - shortening the window for the OS to be available to the charging station. The devices will still charge and shouldn't wake up unless it detects a disconnect/reconnect of the USB cord.\n\n*Be careful to not establish trust with unknown chargers and computers by tapping when prompted by iOS 7.\n\n\nFurthermore, if you upgrade to iOS 7, anytime you connect to a computer which could potentially read your data, you are alerted to this fact rather than having the device share all data because it's not locked with a passcode.\n\nThis new \"trust this computer\" functionality prevents any access to your device's storage without a positive user step to allow that access.\n\nThe device won't talk data to the \"charging station\" until the passcode is entered on the touchscreen. (Or the astronomically unlikely but theoretically possible chance that the charging station provides the one and only unique to you secure certificate generated and stored on your primary iTunes computer.)\nThe charging station can't try entering passwords one by one - so it's not like you are at more risk by charging an hour versus 2 minutes. \n\nA: If you use something akin to a Zoom Energy Bar you should be able to connect the mini USB at the charging station to charge the energy bar, then connect your device to the USB port. It should maintain the charge on the energy bar battery and charge the device(s) on the other end.\nAdded benefit of having a portable battery with you to charge various and sundry devices.\nI have one of those energy bars, but I have to admit that I've never tried what I am proposing here.\n\nA: I recommend powering down the device before you connect it to any unknown docking stations or power chargers. The data is not accessible when the power is off and it will also recharge faster.\n\nA: You could take a spare cable and remove the data pin from the plug that connects to the iDevice, so only power is transmitted.\n\nA: I think this device  fits the requirements. It has a switch to go between \"Charge only\" and \"Sync and charge\".\n\nA: I just wanted to chime in with a completely alternative answer. The data locking cable is really neat, but if you're really concerned, don't use a charging station.\nGet a battery case, Or a battery pack. Or both.\nNaturally, be sure to be on top of recharging them when you're in a safe place.\n", "Q: Difference between Phillips 00 and 000 I'm not really at home in the screwdriver world, and since this question relates to my purchase of a MBP I figured I could ask the question here. Whats the difference between a Phillips 00 and a 000 screwdriver?\n\nA: 000 is smaller and has thinner blades. \n00 is larger and has thicker blades. \nUsing a tool that doesn't exactly match the screw means you can't get proper surface contact. This increases the chance of stripping the head of the screw on removal - especially if the screw threads have locking adhesive.  For assembly, the wrong tool makes it harder to torque the screw properly.\nWith a high quality tool and a screw that isn't too tight, you can sometimes mix 000/00 for screw and tool, but it's not ideal as the difference is significant for the tolerances in a MacBook Pro. If you're looking for an entire kit, this driver set is quite nice as well. You do get \"a little play\" any time there is a socket/bit connection; but for home use, iFixit sells great value and good quality tools.\n\nA: A difference in sizing, I don't think it's particularly a large difference. \nThere is a difference though, if you're looking after your screws then the correct driver is always best.\n", "Q: Why does sshd only accept connections from within LAN? (Snow Leopard) The \"server\" (\"mini\", running OSX 10.6) has SysPrefs>Sharing>RemoteLogin enabled.  I can log in from another machine on the LAN with ssh me@mini.local just fine.  To enable access from WAN, I assigned a static IP address to mini (192.168.1.102) and added a portmapping entry in my TimeCapsule, mapping port 10221 to 192.168.1.102:21.  I have a DynDNS hostname, so I should be able to log in via ssh -p 10221 me@my.homeip.net but it just hangs and eventually times out.\nI verified that DNS is mapping my.homeip.net to my correct public IP address.\nIs there another setting on 'mini' that I've overlooked, that allows local connections but disregards non-local ones?\n\nA: You are forwarding to port 21 on your mac mini. SSH uses port 22.\nYou are also not forced to use a different port on the router: you could map port 22 to 192.168.1.102:22 \n\nA: Port 21 is reserved for FTP. Why not set the public and private port to 22? Try \"the usual way\" first to see if it works, then try wacky port numbers if you're truly keen on securing-by-obscuring.\n", "Q: Adding movie-style sound effects to the Terminal I want to have movie style sound effects in the terminal. You know, when every keystroke and line emits a cool little beep. (Something like this.) I've used KeyClick, but that's only for keyboard typing. I also want effects when characters are read across the screen, etc. \nI know this is superflous as hell. And I'll probably get annoyed by it within five minutes. But it will be a glorious five minutes. \n\nA: Fun question :)\nI'm not sure how you would get sound effects for everything but you could do something like this to get sound effects for a few things:\n1) Open open your .profile (or .bashrc or wherever you like to keep your customizations) by opening a terminal window and typing:\nopen .profile\n\n2) Add the following few lines to the bottom of the file:\nfunction top() { afplay /System/Library/Components/CoreAudio.component/Contents/SharedSupport/SystemSounds/accessibility/Sticky\\ Keys\\ ON.aif; command top;}\nfunction ls() { command ls; afplay /System/Library/Components/CoreAudio.component/Contents/SharedSupport/SystemSounds/accessibility/Slow\\ Keys\\,\\ Key\\ Registered.aif; }\n\n3) Try typing 'ls' for a directory listing or 'top' to see the list of running processes & you'll get to hear the results of these commands.\nBy adding these two lines we are declaring two new functions with the same names as existing bash commands. We override the command itself so that we can play a bit of audio and then run the command itself (or vice versa as shown the 'top' example).\nThe audio files I am currently using are default audio files (at least on Lion) that are used for accessibility features. I chose these so that you could cut-paste, and see the trick in action but you could use any audio file in place of these.\nHere's a site with a bunch of sci-fi sound effects you could use in place of these ones I'm borrowing from the OS:\nhttp://fxhome.com/sounds/\n\nA: Not sure about the keystroke bit... but you could have it print the output of a terminal command like in the movies, i.e. each line is printed character by character and plays a little beep for each one. It looks cool initially and then gets really annoying. Would be fun to have a terminal that you could switch this on and off.

How do I do it?\n\nA: You can Export your notes in Entourage by going to File > Export... or selecting Shift + Command + S, and then check boxing only Notes. When this is exported to a location of your choice (e.g. Desktop), it saves as a .rge. This file type cannot be opened in Apple Mail. Show Package Contents reveals a Notes folder with your exported notes encrypted inside that can only be opened via Entourage. I more or less ran into a dead end trying to figure this out for you.  As far as I could figure out, this cannot be done any easier way than the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Entourage\n\n*Go to Notes\n\n*Go to Edit > Select All (or Command + A) to select all of your notes\n\n*Go to File > Print (or Command + P) to act like you will print all of your notes\n\n*Select PDF > Save As PDF... and select a location of your choice (e.g. Desktop)\n\n*Try and import these into Apple Mail, and if unsuccessful import the PDFs you just created into Evernote\n\n*Rejoice or sulk depending on the situation and/or your mood\n\n\nLet me know if you have any futher questions, and I promise that you'll enjoy Evernote if forced to use it.

Unfortunately our Computing Security folks will not allow a Mac Server with NetBoot on our network, which puts us in a real jam.  How do we boot up to get an image?\nWe are stuck using USB devices to boot from - a huge expense and a lot of trouble.  I would like to be able to boot to the Lion recovery partition and use Terminal to execute the Casper Imaging app from a remote share.  Is this possible?  What are the terminal commands to mount a remote windows share from the (non-writable) Recovery Partition?  If I can do that then we can at least get to our images without needing a 16GB USB stick loaded with the Mac OS.\nIt would be awesome to have a bootable ISO that would have a Mac runtime environment and network.  Is there anything like this?  No \"WindowsPE\" for Mac?\nThanks !   \n\nA: Tell your network people that you want a VLAN that you can use to image your macs on.  Chances are they're worried your net boot env will mess with existing machines on the network.  A VLAN would allow you to run your net boot stuff without affecting the rest of the network.  The problem with this method is that in order to image a machine you need to also place the target machine on the same VLAN.  Depending on your situation this might not be a problem. \nAt any rate, I think your network people are being lazy, this is an easy problem to solve.\n\nA: If you opt for the sneaker-net method, use an external FireWire hard drive, not a USB stick. Installs will be much quicker. Also, learn how to use Target Disk Mode with FireWire between a working Mac laptop and the target machine you want to re-image. This will save you a great deal of time.\nCarbon Copy Cloner and SuperDuper! are great and inexpensive third-party disk cloning and restore tools for Mac OS X.\nUsing a working Mac laptop with Target Disk Mode over Firewire, and a utility like Carbon Copy Cloner, gives you a \"Windows PE\" and much more.\nWhether you can work out a network method or not, understanding FireWire external drives, Target Disk Mode, and the use of a Mac OS X disk cloning tool should be important parts of your IT support toolkit.\nI also want to point out that you can use a SINGLE image for all Intel-based Macs, even if they are of many different models and model years. This is in sharp contrast to the Windows world where you need a different image for each make and model of PC and all the various network interface cards and variant hardware between them. None of this is necessary on the Mac platform.\n", "Q: Leopard won't remember default programs Everytime I restart/boot my mac and open up a mail application (thunderbird) or a web browser (firefox or chrome) I am always asked if I want to make it the default.

However, I try to avoid using closed-source software whenever possible except from major vendors like Apple and Skype. \nI am wondering, is there an open source screen recorder for Mac OS X? \nOr if not, does Apple include such a thing with the OS? Or how about using Skype? I'm running Snow Leopard.\n\nA: You've answered your own question, but I thought I would flesh it out a bit.  \nYou are correct that QuickTime will record a window, or the whole screen, but it only does so with the version of QT that ships with Lion. It wasn't available in earlier versions of QT or OS X (I'm not sure if the latest QT would do this on an older OS - I don't have one to try it on.)\nI was pleasantly surprised to see that it now had that functionality - there really aren't any other free or low cost options.\n\nA: Kap is a great option.

Other applications don't generally use them as such, whereas symlinks act as aliases for the Finder as well but also act as symlinks for any Application. Aliases are actually MUCH better than symlinks for Finder-type uses as then don't break, and you can do things like, for example make an alias to a file inside of a disk image -- if the disk image isn't mounted when you click the alias, FInder will mount the disk image, then open that file.\n2) Here is a video that shows you how to create symlinks with automator.\n2a) There are also a number of Automator addons that you can use that are made for creating symlinks/\n", "Q: awk/sed output from system_profiler on 10.6.8 If I have:\nfoo\nbar\n..and I'd like to awk/sed this to:\nfoo-bar\n..what's the syntax?\nI'm trying to use:\nsystem_profiler SPMemoryDataType | awk '/Type/ {print $2} /Speed/ {print $2}'|sed 's/\\r$/a\\\"-\"/'\n\nto output type-speed (ie DDR-1067).\n\nA: Use this sed instead:\n|sed '$!N;s/\\n/ /' \n\nsystem_profiler SPMemoryDataType | awk '/Type/ {print $2} /Speed/ {print $2}'|sed '$!N;s/\\n/ /'\noutput:\nDDR3 1066\nDDR3 1066\nDDR3 1066\nEmpty Empty\n\n\nA: Awk can easily do this on it's own, like so:\nsystem_profiler SPMemoryDataType | awk '/Type:/ {type=$2} /Speed:/ {speed=$2; printf \"%s-%s\\n\", type, speed}'\n\n", "Q: What software has the features I need to replace Skype? For the past few years Skype has been getting progressively worse with each iteration. Skype 5 moved away from the compact 2.X era interface to an interface that's much more wasteful and less usable. Features like videoconferencing went paid-only, and now the latest betas are integrating with Facebook and have ads.\nI've been on the fence a while regarding Skype; for all its faults it still is useful, but I've gotten to the point where I don't like the direction the software is taking and I'm looking into potential replacements.\nThe following is a list of Skype features that I use; I'm looking for a set of software/services that will cover most of these:\n\n\n*\n\n*audio calling\n\n*video calling\n\n*audio conferencing\n\n*video conferencing\n\n*Mac client\n\n*iOS client\n\n*Windows client (for family without Macs/iOS devices)\n\n*calling phone numbers\n\n*call recording (I use Ecamm's CallRecorder for Skype)\n\n\nThere are other features, like chatting, sending files, SkypeIn, and voicemail, but the above features are the ones I need. Any suggestions?\n\nA: At the moment, I am sticking with uninstalling \"new Skype\" and going back to the old Skype.\nBut, VBuzzer is also a very good choice. They are based on open standards and can do most of the above, including video conferencing without a download (i.e.; in browser). (No Skype-in type number though). They also have mobile applications for both iOS and Android.\nGoogle Voice + Gchat + Google Plus hangouts is always an option as well\n\nA: Trillian would be my choice and it should hit all your requirements except perhaps the phone calling extension. (I haven't used it personally in a while)\nGoogle voice isn't a shoe in replacement for that one aspect since it's not a true VOIP - but you might have to choose amongst your requirements. Skype has the pockets to hit all the points you mention and I don't see anyone else with the pockets to do all those clients with all those features. Perhaps if others get fed up with Skype, another service will pop up that is reasonably priced so as not to need to be ad supported.\n\nA: I use iChat wherever possible - not nearly as ubiquitous as Skype but the tight OS integration, stability, performance, and no ads should make it at least a consideration.\nIf you can use AOL IM accounts on both ends you'll get screen sharing and video.

The problem is, when the network drive with the library is not mounted or unreachable by the computer then iTunes creates a new local Library on start up. \nCan I stop iTunes from doing that or even better notify me if the drive is not mounted? I really would like to avoid creating a local Library. Otherwise files end up on multiple location and it seems hard to consolidate this.\n\nA: I've had this happen as well. \nThe best solution is not to let iTunes open unless the drive is connected, but I see how that isn't always possible when on the road. \nI found that (in OS 10.6 and iTunes 9, at least), if you make the MUSIC Folder in your home directory (~/Music/) read-only, it will not be able to automatically create an iTunes directory in the default location, and thereby it will prompt you to find the iTunes library. \nAs an alternative, you can hold down the Command key when opening iTunes, which will prompt you to connect to a Library. \nAlternative 2: If you make a Symbolic link to the iTunes Library in your music folder, it will attempt to mount the drive in order to find it. \n\nA: What do you mean files will end up in multiple locations? Are you syncing a device or adding files?\nI do something similar with a work computer. I have two iTunes libraries. One is on an external disk and has all my songs files etc. The local library is there when I do not have my external drive or is otherwise unmounted. I keep it to listen to the radio only, so that I have something while I don't have access to te external. \nTo change from local to remote, you launch iTunes by holding alt. You are then prompted to define which library to connect to. I havent found a way to launch iTunes from Quicksilver and be prompted. I am not adding things to my library, however. \n\nA: I don't think (by default) the iTunes library is automatically created because I also keep my library on a AFP network mount. If it is not mounted, iTunes displays an message box prompting to quit, create a new library or locate the library.\nMy suspicion is that you already have a library created on your local machine, try removing this (assuming it is empty) completely  first. Then hold ⌥ when launching iTunes with your network share mounted. Then choose your network library from the folder dialog box\n\nA: Your library is always local but the media may be distributed anywhere on your network. Except you connect to a remote shared library, but then its not yours/local but remote. You cant use iTunes without an locally accesible library - the local library is part of itunes and will be recreated when missing everytime!\nLeave the library local and use the media from your network, thats what i do and it works with both options \"automatic management/add media to local library\" turned off.\n", "Q: iPhone Backups on Network drive By moving my iTunes Library to a network drive, will iPhone/iPad backups also be stored on that network drive? (If not, is there a way to set this up?) \n\nA: On a Mac, iDevice backups are stored in strangely (seemingly randomly) named subfolders in ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/\nThis is outside of the ~/Music/iTunes folder (standard Library location on Mac OSX).\nYou'd be wanting to take a copy of all the files and folders within this folder and put them on your network drive. I've not tested if a restore of these items works following a system reinstall and I suspect that iTunes may do some extra stuff behind the scenes to pair these backup folders and files to the devices that they came from.\nBackup location on Windows (Assuming system drive is C:\\)Windows XP\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\user\\Application Data\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\nWindows Vista/Windows 7\nC:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\n(edit) Just realised that this probably doesn't fully answer your question, however, I've found this discussion which is along the lines of changing where iTunes reads/writes its backups\n", "Q: Can OS X Lion Server automatically set up Mail using Open Directory information?

But it doesn't automatically configure the Mail.app.\nI searched on the internet but Lion differs a lot from (Snow) Leopard at this point. Is there anyone who can help me find the right setting to configure this?\n\nA: Log into profile manager as an administrator using Safari and set up a profile for a user to change mail settings.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://server.local/profilemanager/\nYou will want to spend time making sure DNS and SSL are correctly installed - starting with making a self-signed certificate if you don't want to pay for a real SSL cert for your server.\nHere's what to look for when you want to test setting IMAP settings for users.\n\nAs you might be able to see - pick a user, then edit their settings and finally choose email.\n\nA: you need to use profile manager, your users can setup their entire mac enviroment with installing just one tiny profile\n"]
