["Q: How can I make 3 external displays function with my 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro (Mid 2014)? How can I make 3 external displays (4 total, or 3 if running in closed book mode) function with my 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro (Mid 2014)?\nRegardless of closed-book/clamshell mode, I am unable to make 3 external displays function. I am able to connect it all and power any given two at a time and it obviously has enough power, but it doesn't seem to want to run 3.\nI've read mixed answers as to whether it can support 2 or 3 external displays. Someone in a thread on OWC says it can and they show a 15\" MBP powering 3 externals.\nIs there something I'm missing or a work-around?\n\nA: The 15\" and 13\" MacBook Pros are vastly different machines. The 15\" has a dedicated video card that may help support that many displays. The 13\" uses Intel's embedded video hardware, and it likely does not (at least not in OS X). As the user states in that post, it seems technically possible to run 3 in Linux, but it appears restricted in OS X.\nThat said, you could always find a USB-based video adapter and use it to run and additional display. It would function independently of the internal hardware.\n", "Q: How do i quickly silence all notifications except for ringer on an iPhone 6? Sometimes I'm on call for work overnight and would like to know a quick way that I can silence all notifications except for the call ringer.  The closest thing I see is allowing calls from everyone on do not disturb but that will allow messages to ring as well.\n\nA: Actually, Do Not Disturb is indeed your solution as it blocks ALL notifications EXCEPT the calls which you specifically allow. It will block message notifications. \nAfter you have configured the settings in Settings -> Do Not Disturb, all you need to do to enable it is swipe up from the bottom of the screen and tap the moon icon. \nYou can configure it to only allow certain contact groups, favorites, all callers, and/or repeated calls. \n\nA: You can also head to Settings->Sounds->Text Tone and set tone and vibration there. You can configure texts for no sound and/or no vibration. Similarly, you can allow ALL calls (from any number) to ring as you have set in Settings->Sounds->Ringtone\nI was just dealing with the same issue as I expect and need to hear work calls (any number) but can't have my phone buzzing from a bunch of texts all the time.\n\nA: Try and place your do not disturb button on, \"ON\"  and that would just allow your phone to ring and will block all other incoming notifications.\nI have iphone 7\n\nA: With the 7/7 Plus you simply engage Do Not Disturb and select \"Allow Calls\" from \"Everyone\". Nice and easy.\n", "Q: Why Doesn't OSX root user automatically default to the same shell as other users Why doesn't the root user on OSX automatically default to the same shell as other users?\nSeems like this would avoid a lot of complications, but I guess there must be complications with the shells being the same for root as others, but I just don't know what they are.  I have googled this and searched Stack Exchange, and have not found an explanation for it.\n\nA: Probably because on standard Unix operating systems, each user has its own shell, and root is just another user.  Mac OS X is more or less Unix-derived.  So, lacking any sufficiently powerful reason to change that, it's not surprising that Mac OS X follows Unix conventions.\nAnd it would be very surprising if changing bob's login shell also changed root's login shell.  That'd be a security risk (ordinary users shouldn't be able to change root's login shell), could cause system stability problems (if you choose a bad login shell or one that is on an external partition), and would violate the principle of least surprise.\nAlso, probabilistically speaking, I suspect that most users who know enough to log in as root, also know enough to be able to change root's shell to whatever you prefer.\nBut only Apple can tell you for sure why they did it this way.  The rest of us can only speculative.\n\nA: On my system (OS X 10.10 Yosemite), root is configured to use a /bin/sh shell by default (in both /etc/passwd and through OpenDirectory). Other users (aside from daemons) are configured to use /bin/bash by default.\nThere is no significant difference between the two in everyday usage, although Bash has had some high profile security issues lately (reference: ShellShock and the Apple security patch at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201393). Maybe Apple made the choice to set root's default shell to /bin/sh by default, in light of that?\n", "Q: Does disabling Siri replace it with Voice Control in IOS 7+ If you disable Siri in general, will holding the home button (when phone is locked) activate the old Voice Control instead?\n\nA: If you disable Siri, it will then activate Voice Control when you hold the home button. Being on the lock screen or not doesn't make a difference.\n", "Q: Safari keeps warning \"malicious javascript detected on this domain\" Safari keeps warning malicious javascript detected on this domain, and there is only a OK button to click. \nIt is stupid to click OK again and again.\nHow to prevent this?\nI think the so-called malicious javascript is just some code for ads, because I saw this warning at a few websites of large company.\n\nA: JavaScript of Baidu Ad and Statistics are redirected to GitHub urls https://github.com/greatfire/ and https://github.com/cn-nytimes/ It is in fact DDoS due to large population. \nGitHub returns an alert page in order to stop the recursive JS running for each user. \nThis is possibly done by GFW (Great Fire Wall) as the two URLs are not welcomed by them and only people outside mainland China faced this issue today. (GitHub cannot function well in China).\nA detailed analysis can be found on WooYun (in Simplified Chinese)\nhttp://drops.wooyun.org/papers/5398\n", "Q: iMac and MacBook Air shared monitor I have used a thunderbolt connection and pressed Command F2 to allow my track pad and keyboard on my MBA to run both screens. However, I want to use the wireless track pad and keyboard that comes with the iMac instead of the laptop track/keyboard. In other words, I would like the iMac to be the primary computer and use the laptop as a secondary screen (with all control remaining with the iMac). Is this possible?\n\nA: Simple answer, no it's not possible. The Target Display Mode is a function specific to the iMac and this functionality isn't incorporated into MacBooks.\nYou could of course pair the wireless keyboard and trackpad to your MacBook and use TDM on the iMac, but if you're trying to leverage the iMac's CPU power you're out of luck I'm afraid. You'd be better off buying a small cheap monitor if you need a secondary display for use with the iMac.\n", "Q: Screen resolution of MacBook Pro Retina I have a MacBook Pro 13\" Retina-display (Late 2013 model)\nI recently bought a very cheap HDMI cable to plug it on my tv in my room (for Screen Mirroring and sometimes, Screen extend). Since it's cheap, I'm quite worried on a possible effect it would bring to my MacBook's resolution or display or maybe performance or at least, something.  \nWill it ruin my MacBook in any sort in the long run? Should I just forgo the cheap HDMI and invest on a better quality albeit being a bit more expensive, or Thunderbolt, perhaps? (Never tried Thunderbolt)\n\nA: No, if a cheap cable works between your TV and Mac you won't find an expensive cable works any better, and a cheap cable isn't going to have any effect of your Mac's longevity. Use it and enjoy the fact you could have paid so much more for a cable and gained nothing at all ;-)\nAdditionally, using a Thunderbolt/mini-DisplayPort adapter uses the same signalling protocols as HDMI and the output to your TV would be exactly the same.\n", "Q: iPad is iCloud locked to a defunct address I was gifted an iPad from a restaurant owner. This iPad was provided to the restaurant and used to relay orders from a third party service who would deliver their food outside their normal delivery range.\nThe third-party company that provided the iPad is now defunct, and the iCloud email address has been out of use for long enough to bounce emails back to me immediately.\nI am aware of the concept of circumventing iCloud activation lock and that is not what I am looking for. I am looking to have Apple verify that the current account is defunct and to legitimately remove the account from the iPad.\nWhat steps do I take to have Apple review and potentially remove an iCloud account from my iDevice? \n\nA: You can present the original purchase receipt showing the serial number to Apple to have them unilaterally remove the lock.\nThe alternative is to revive the \"defunct\" account. Since Apple doesn't delete them, you can go through the password reset procedure to reclaim access to the defunct iCloud account. Once you are logged in to the locking account, removal of the lock is trivial.\nOtherwise, bypassing the lock is not feasible.\n", "Q: Dotted underlines in Word for Macbook users 2011 I am doing an editorial job and need to underline some words with red dotted underlines. How do you do this using Word for Mac users? The version I have is 2011, on a MacBook with Snow Leopard software.\n\nA: Select the text you want to underline, right click and select 'font'. \nNow you can set the underline style and color. \n\n", "Q: Cannot connect to Apple TV My Apple TV works perfectly as a stand alone machine. It plays the channels I want to watch. \nHowever, Neither my MacBook Air, My iPads, my iPhone 6 and my iMac will no longer connect to AirPlay.\nAll these devices worked perfectly until recently, AirPlay was a wonderful method by which I could stream videos to the Apple TV for watching on the 'big screen'.\nNow, none of them connect. they are all on the same wifi network and 'AirPlay' is switched on on the Apple TV.\nUsing the iPad, the 'Airplay' button is there, when I choose to play to Apple TV, the iPad says\"PLaying on Apple TV\" but nothing happens on the TV.\nBoth the MacBook Air and the iMac are unable to connect to Apple TV. The AirPlay button is there, and when I choose Apple TV, after some moments I get a message \"Unable to connect to Apple TV\"\nEven though this says unable to connect to Apple TV, when I use iTunes to stream MP4 files, I go into the menu on Apple TV, Choose 'Computers' and I can access the MP4 files and they play perfectly.\nBut, as the computers 'cannot connect' I am unable to Mirror my computer screen, hence, I cannot use 'Beamer' to stream other file types such as .avi or .mkv from them to the TV.\nAlso, when I stream live TV from my iPads, they say \"Playing on Apple TV\", but the Apple TV does not respond by playing the files.\nI have reset the Apple TV twice and everything is as should be as far as set up is concerned, and I have checked everything I can think of on the computers and have checked all the settings. \nWhat's gone wrong? I hope someone has an idea that I haven't already tried over the last 5 days of searching for answers on the internet and checking settings on all my devices.\n\nA: Try restoring the Apple TV to its factory setting via iTunes, Apple Support article here.  We've had a handful of Apple TVs with odd behaviour, and restoring via iTunes has fixed them.  You will need a micro-USB cable to do this.\n", "Q: How do I know a mac needs to restart? Is there a way to figure out from a script whether a Mac needs to reboot? A file, the presence or contents of which I could monitor perhaps? \nI'm looking for an equivalent to the file /var/run/reboot-required found on my Ubuntu boxes. My use case would be to centrally monitor my servers (and perhaps laptops) using Puppet, collectd or… well, something.\n\nA: Like Linux, OS X is designed not to require restarting. There is no system wide means to determine if a restart is required - or even requested by a process.\nFor situations where a restart is required, the process responsible for needing the restart is also responsible for organising the restart.\nTools that update OS X are most likely to request a restart.\nsoftwareupdate\nTake a look at the  softwareupdate manual page for the most likely candidate to request a restart.\nsoftwareupdate prints a message at the end of the updating process stating if a restart is required. The calling script or user is then responsible for restarting.\nDelayed Updates\nIf an update requires a restart to be successfully and safely installed, OS X will delay the updating process. The update will wait until the next restart or shut down.\nThis approach allows updates to be downloaded as part of a schedule but not interrupt or interfere with running processes or active users.\nPending Updates\nTo see if an update is pending, check the contents of /Library/Updates/. This folder appears to contain property list files documenting packages and updates queued for installation.\nYou can use the tool defaults in your scripts to read plist files such as /Library/Updates/index.plist:\ndefaults read /Library/Updates/index.plist InstallAtLogout\n\n", "Q: What must I check after I got my new refurbished MacBook Pro 13\"? My friend wants to buy new refurbished MacBoook Pro 13\" mid 2014 MGX72 in Malaysia. He's afraid of defects. So he needs advice on how to check whether it has problem or not. If it has, he must report it as soon as possible to the Apple Reseller where he bought it in Malaysia, before going home to Indonesia.\nI know this site is not for a question of which Mac I should buy, but I ask about technical advice on how to check a new refurbished MacBook Pro 13\" after I got it, so if it has any problem I can detect it and report it soon, so I won't have any problems when I'm home.\nWhat I currently know is only check whether the display doesn't have dead pixel, and checking the battery (is it running up to around 9-10 hours as promised and calibrate it).\nWhat else should I test?\n\nA: A simple answer, start the MacBook and hold down the D key when you hear the startup chime. This will start the built-in diagnostics and any problems that are found will be listed here. Apple link here.\n", "Q: Unable to re-enable Spotlight on Volume I've been trying to debug a \"Waiting for index to be ready\" issue with my Time Machine volume, and one piece of advice that I've encountered is re-creating the Spotlight index on the volume.\nTo do this I ran the following commands (as sudo):\nmdutil -i off /Volumes/Backup\nrm -R /Volumes/Backup/.Spotlight-V100\n\nHowever, I'm now trying to re-enable Spotlight with the reverse of the first command, but this is what I'm getting:\nmdutil -v -i on /Volumes/Backup\n/Volumes/Backup:\n    Indexing and searching disabled.\n\nIt simply doesn't want to do it, and I can't figure out why. I've tried manually recreating the .Spotlight-V100 with ownership set to root:wheel and mode set to 700 (exactly as the folder on other volumes is configured), and while mdutil has now created a VolumeConfiguration.plist file, it still won't enable indexing.\nI can't find anywhere to get more information; the -v option of mdutil doesn't give any additional output, and nothing extra seems to be logged anywhere. There doesn't appear to be any physical problem, as the drive is new and reporting no I/O errors or other issues; aside from the \"waiting for index\" slow-down, Time Machine is otherwise working perfectly and I can view the contents of its backups without any problems.\nAnyway, are there any other steps that can be followed to force Spotlight to re-index the drive, or find out why it's failing to do-so?\n\nA: There are typically user immutable flags set on Time Machine backup volumes so that even root can't directly chown or chmod. You can look at these with:\nls -laeO /Volumes/*\nls -laeO /Volumes/Backup/Backups.backupdb/\n\n\nMac:~ me$ ls -laeO /Volumes/Backup/Backups.backupdb/\ntotal 0\ndrwxr-xr-x@  7 root  wheel  -  238 Mar  3 04:40 .\n 0: group:everyone deny add_file,delete,add_subdirectory,delete_child,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\ndrwxrwxr-x  20 root  wheel  -  748 Mar 25 12:29 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x   3 root  wheel  -  102 Mar 27 12:04 .RecoverySets\ndrwx------   7 root  wheel  -  238 Mar  6 10:47 .spotlight_repair\ndrwx------   2 root  wheel  -   68 Mar 27 14:28 .spotlight_temp\ndrwxr-xr-x@ 40 root  wheel  - 1360 Mar 27 18:31 Mac\n 0: group:everyone deny add_file,delete,add_subdirectory,delete_child,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\n\nCross reference with diskutil list to double check your mount points and volume names. My experience is that since Time Machine requires spotlight to make hard links is that if you tamper with the stores where those databases are resident on the filesystem you can't put \"humpty dumpty\" back together again and should archive off the snapshot backups you need using Finder/rsync or by making a dmg of those instants and then wiping the drive to start with new slate of .dotfiles and .dotdirectories with associated stores.\nClearly, someone with internal knowledge of how Time Machine and spotlight self check might step up and explain things, but I've not seen this level of detail publicly documented by Apple so far. I'd start at http://pondini.org/OSX/Home.html if you haven't checked there for any community knowledge on the innards of Time Machine + Spotlight\n\nA: I had the same problem, but fixed it by taking the affected volume out of the privacy list in the Spotlight system preferences pane. A simplistic approach, but it worked.\n", "Q: Run OS X Yosemite inside OS X Yosemite I have a MacBook Pro and I am looking for a way to run another OS X Yosemite inside it.\nI tried Virtual Box, and installed OS X, but it doesn't support guest additions for OS X guests. It keeps the display at 1024x768 and the mouse moves very slowly.\nWhat is the best way to run OS X inside another OS X? Note that I have a legal OS X and I am not talking about Hackintosh!\n\nA: Both Parallels Desktop 10 and VMWare fusion support virtualising Yosemite. Both are better than Virtual Box.\nIn Parallels you can create a virtual machine with Yosemite immediately by using the recovery partition.\n\nA: I have VMware Fusion running on 10.10 Yosemite. It has no problems at all running OS X back to 10.5.\nYou do, however, need lots of memory. Virtual machines need the guest OS recommended memory in addition to the host OS recommended memory. Since Yosemite likes 4GB bare minimum, you won't be happy running two of them on a 4GB machine.\nI have 24GB of memory, and right now I have 6 different versions of Mac OS running side-by-side. It does slow down noticeably when I try to update or reboot multiple guest operating systems, but that's more a function of them all being on the same external disk drive than anything else.\n\nA: VMware Fusion 7 supports OS X Yosemite and OS X Yosemite Server - \nhttps://www.vmware.com/au/support/fusion/faq/requirements#supported_guest\n", "Q: Where is ken burns effect in iMovie 10.0.7?

I mainly run 10.6.8, as I have a large software investment I'm not ready to abandon. As part of my migration to the present day OS, I have multiple startup drives, 2 PCI based SSDs. \nWhen I am running 10.6.8 and attempt to reboot into 10.10, I see this;\n\nObviously not 10.10. So I attempt a boot and disc utility comes up offering the usual menu to restore the OS drive. When I quit the utility, I'm offered a choice of startup drives:\n\nNow, the startup choices appear correctly, and boot me into 10.10. When running 10.10.2, I get a fast boot back to 10.6.8. \nAs it stands, I need 2 boots to get into 10.10 when running 10.6.8 prior. Why does the system still see any remnant of Lion? \nEdit - perhaps the right question is - \"Sagan SSD contains 10.10, why does this show as 10.7 when trying to boot into it while running 10.6.8?\"\nIn response to the comment, diskutil list shows -\n\nand it appears to me that when I try to boot Sagan SSD it's the recovery HD that tries to boot. \n\nA: Did you try to press the \"option\" key during startup? This will prompt you to select the startup disk if several are available. Set the system to boot into the one you will boot into most often, and if you want to boot into the other, press \"option\" when you switch the Mac on and wait for the prompt.\n", "Q: iOS mail inbox does not show addresses I use a catch all email address on my domain, and would like to be able to figure out what address is being sent spam email.  Unfortunately, I can't find a way to see what address an email in my inbox was sent to. Is there a way to determine the addressee of an email in iOS 8?\n\nA: You would likely have to have an email app capable of displaying the raw headers of the email to trace this information. I do not believe the iOS 8 Mail app has this capability; it simply displays the most user-friendly information (your catch-all To: address). However, if you can access the same account through the Mac OS X Mail application (or Outlook, etc.), you can view the raw headers there.\n", "Q: Sprint factory iphone 5 unlocking I want to factory unlock my iphone 5 from Sprint operator.

If you are currently off the contract, see this.\n", "Q: Bluetooth headphones automatic connect I have LG HBS 730 Bluetooth headphones. I would like them to automatically connect to my Retina Macbook pro. How can I achieve that?\n\nA: They should automatically connect as soon as you have paired them. They won't automatically reconnect if you take them out of range without turning them off first, to reconnect them, go into range and briefly press the call button on them. If you turn them off, then turn them on again and they don't connect, this is either a product issue, or your MacBook might not have the right settings.\nMake sure that your MacBook is discoverable via bluetooth.

That's NTP. You can pick a default Apple NTP server, or set your own, eg. pick one from here: http://www.pool.ntp.org/zone/north-america\nFor UTC time zone, click over to the Time Zone tab, and enter \"UTC - United Kingdom\" as the Closest City.\n", "Q: No Battery Available I have a MacBook Pro 15\", early 2011. Earlier this week, I brought it home and plugged it in, and there was an X through the battery. Did an SMC reset, and it started charging again. The next day it stopped again, and the message in the menubar said \"No Battery Available.\" I opened up System Information, and under Power it said there was no battery installed. \nDid another SMC reset and System Information was unable to load information for Power. I recently did another SMC reset, upgraded to Yosemite, and am still getting the no battery available symbol. But now this is what's showing up in System Information:\n\nIs my battery completely dead? Is there any way to recharge it, or do I need to replace it?\nUPDATE: I forgot to note, I did an AHT on the machine a couple days ago, and it said there was nothing wrong with the hardware. If the battery was jostled loose, wouldn't AHT flag it?\n\nA: You probably knocked the battery connector out. Here's a link to a repair guide to replacing the whole battery, which is more than you need. Do steps 1 and 2 to open your computer up, and then make sure the battery connector in Step 3 is 100% plugged in. If it's fully plugged in and it's still not working, the battery itself is probably shot.\n\nA: Possible bad news, you should have gotten Replace Battery warnings way before, that you could not missed.\nWhat it indicates is your Logic board is failing where the SMC chip sits on it. You can open it and take battery out, then place it back in, but that is slim hope.\nBefore you spend a fortune in replacing the logic board:\nThere is a small circuit build in the battery that reports its presence and status to the SMC chip that then reports it to the system (you). If that one is dead then just replacing the battery would do the trick.\n\nA: Unfortunately I can't see the image you posted right now (due to proxy filtering) but if it says \"Service Battery\" you can either live with it or buy a new battery. Chances are the battery's integrated status monitor is either correctly identifying a battery failure or the the monitor itself has failed. There isn't a \"fix\" for this other than replacement. If your battery dock icon is showing an \"X\" then, as above, live with it or replace it.\n\nA: I had similar problem, where the battery was showing as not existing. Took it to the Apple Store, and their tests showed no battery, which confused them. \nThey took it in the back and returned a few mins later. It was the battery power meter on the side of the MacBook Pro, you know the one that lights up with 6 tiny white lights?  The battery pack is connected thru the meter to the power port. The meter had a problem and thus disconnected from the battery.\nBattery was fine, but the system could not access it. \nSuggest you get Apple to look at it.\n", "Q: iOS got a very long repeating Settings list The application list in Settings is becoming very long.

When you click it it asks you if you want to re-download it event though it is installed. (Downloading from the purchases tab is different from downloading from the product page I believe.)\n\nA: Did you run the YosemiteBetaAccessUtility.pkg? \nAccess via the Apple Beta Program\nYou'll need to sign in or create an account to get to that link.\nYou can't get to the betas without it.\nYour error message looks like the one you would get if you just tried downloading the current Yosemite release again.\n\nA: This is another scenario that illustrates why creating USB install media is a good idea, as opposed to simply downloading and running the installer.

Of course, all the world is not a Mac, but passwords are ubiquitous.\nWhen I am using a Mac under my control I can use the Keychain Access app to look up my single-site passwords, but sometimes I'm on someone else's computer, which is usually not a Mac, and sometimes I use a Linux device, and so on. Even with iOS apps, sometimes I need to use my website password to log in using the app, and most apps don't seem to support iCloud passwords (although a few thankfully do!).\nI do always have an iOS device with me, so are there any applications for iOS that allow you to access the iCloud Keychain to retrieve the plaintext password, like OSX's Keychain Access?

In my case I had to also reboot the remote machine but that may have been specific to my setup.\n\n\n\nThe windows 10 machine I remote into looks much better once I toggle this on.\nChris\n\nA: Microsoft Remote Desktop doesn't support Retina throughput and scales the content by changing the resolution that is advertised. You can change this by setting the resolution of your display to a non-HiDPI resolution, such as literal 2880x1800, however everything will appear tiny unless you are able to directly set the HiDPI setting on the server which you are connecting to.\n\nA: Here's something you might want to look at, as I have this issue connecting from my Win7 PC at work to some other PCs at work: Pixellated type.\nIt may be that cleartype is turned off for the RD session:\nRight click on the desktop in the RD session and select Screen resolution. Then click on the \"Make Text and other items larger or smaller\" link and then the \"Adjust ClearType text\" link. There you can see if cleartype is off, if so check the \"turn on cleartype\" checkbox and go through the brief wizard (I usually just click next on each screen as the defaults are usually fine).\nWhen you are done the type (at least) is much better.\n", "Q: Erase certain messages in Messages on OS X I like having the Messages app on my Mac, but I have one problem: When I delete a message thread on my iPhone, it doesn't delete from my Mac. In other words, if I delete three messages from the same person, on my phone, I see the previous messages and the later messages but not those specific ones. But on my Mac, they're all still there. And I don't see a place to delete them on my Mac the same way you delete them on the phone.\n\nA: Deleting messages on an iOS device doesn't delete them from any other device.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can remove message threads by clicking the × on the right of the contact.\n\n\n*You can remove individual messages by right-clicking the message and selecting Delete.\n\n\nA: There's an important detail missing in this answer, for those of you/us who are \"click challenged\".

I need to deploy that to a bunch of other computers around campus. The usual process for me in the past has been to use an external USB drive, with OS X installed, to boot the target Mac and capture an image. That really doesn't seem to be working in Yosemite. I can boot to my 10.10.2 USB drive and run Disk Utility, but odd things happen when I try to create an image. When I try to image the partition, OS X doesn't dismount the target partition/disk. In past versions of OS X, the target partition was immediately dismounted after I entered my password. Lastly, I cannot \"scan the image to restore\", that part fails even though I can successfully create the image file. The error message is: Unable to scan \"image.dmg\" (internal error). Has anyone else seen this? I've tried making several images already.\nThanks\n\nA: If you are able to mount the drive, you can use Copy Copy Cloner or even better (IMO) SuperDuper! from Shirt Pocket. SuperDuper! will not copy caches and unnecessary files that are re-created upon boot, saving space. These both give you clones of the drive, but not images. If you can restore the clone, then this might work.\nIf you're savvy with a Terminal, you can use the basic diskutil and dd commands to get a disk image - this is what Disk Utility is likely doing under the hood. Just be careful with the input/output parameters of the command, to ensure you don't overwrite something you're not supposed to.\nFor example, you can find a disk and the partition you want with:\ndiskutil list\n\nThen, to unmount the disk:\ndiskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk<n>\n\nwhere the \"<n>\" is the disk number of the drive you want to image. Finally, create an image using some form of:\nsudo dd if=/dev/disk<n>s<p> of=/path/to/image.img bs=1m\n\nwhere the \"<n>\" is the disk number and \"<p>\" is the partition number you found above. Do not type any of the brackets (<>) as part of the command. There are other options you can add, and you can adjust the block size (bs) accordingly.\nI just found more information at another post here: What is the best way to clone a disk between two Macs?\n\nA: The short, simple answer is DeployStudio. It's free and it's built for the exact purpose of creating and deploying OS X images. It can run in a standalone configuration or it can be configured on a server to capture and deploy images over a network. It has a host of post-flight operations available including performing Active and Open Directory binding. We've used it on our campus for the last three years and it's a massive time-saver, network images can be rolled out in minutes, depending on your network speed. There's a bit of a learning curve but this is the tool you need - check it out.\nIf you need to avoid using network deployment due to speed restrictions etc., DeployStudio can be set up to work from a bootable external disk. A brief setup guide can be found here.\n", "Q: How can I trouble shoot \"Your message could not be sent. #### is not registered with iMessage\"?

I'm currently at college (living away from home) and my iPod Touch is at home. Its jailbroken and has OpenSSH installed through Saurik's Cydia repo. Is there any way I can SSH to get a theme file that I installed on the phone and pull it to my computer? I can ask my parents to unlock the phone to make sure its connected to Wifi as well as to tell me the Local IP address of the phone as well. What other steps do I need to connect from my computer to my phone? \nShort version with no explanations\nI want to SSH into my phone from a different wifi network. \n\nA: Firstly ask your parents to turn on your iPad and connect it to the local network.\nIf you have remote administration on your router you'll be able to do the next steps yourself, else you'll need your parents to do it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Login to your router's administration page\n\n*Get the external IP address of your router (if you can set up dynDNS this will make your life easier in the future)\n\n*Work out the IP address of your iPad\n\n*If your router allows you to, it'd be useful to assign it with a static IP address\n\n*Navigate to the port forwarding page (probably under security or firewall)\n\n*Configure port 22 (standard for ssh) to forward to your iPad (some routers will allow you to forward it to a MAC address making it doesn't matter if the devices IP address changes)\n\n*Now, from your computer SSH to the external IP of your router (or dynDNS address if you have that)\n", "Q: Changed default mail client, but Spotlight still opens Mail.App; how to change it? Because of some other bugs with Mail.App's handling of certain email formats, I've installed Thunderbird to give that a try. I configured it to be the default (from the Mail.App preferences). That seems to work.\nBUT if I search for an email via Spotlight (Thunderbird's search is...well, I'm using Spotlight), clicking on a found mail item from Spotlight still launches Mail.App.\nI suspect it's a setting in a plist; how can I convince Spotlight to open Thunderbird instead of Mail.App?\n\nA: The best way I've found to set any default app is with RCDefaultApp - freeware - old but still works in Yosemite.\nIt installs as a Control Panel item called Default Apps; you can then set many defaults - simplest are the 'Internet' ones, first tab - dial in your preferred app from the drop menu.\ne.g.  \n\n", "Q: Automatically start multiple user sessions when OSX starts I need to get several users session logged-in as soon as the computer starts.

If everything you use Homebrew for is\nworking fine: please don't worry and just ignore them. Thanks!\n\nFollowed by a warning similar to yours about config files that brew can see which are part of an Anaconda Python install.  So, if you're not having any problems, you shouldn't feel too bad about taking their advice and just ignoring the warning.\nHowever, the reason that you're getting the warnings is because the MacPython install process added a symlink in /usr/local/bin/ to it's Python directory under /Library/Frameworks/....  There's nothing wrong with this per se, but, as you've found, it's always possible that it could conflict with assumptions made by other stuff that uses /usr/local/bin/ (e.g., Homebrew).\nYou might want to look into virtualenv as a way of managing your Python development environments in general.  I haven't given this much thought, but I'd be tempted to remove those links that MacPython put in /usr/local/bin/ and create a virtualenv that points to whichever MacPython version you want to use for a particular project.\n", "Q: OS X Lion Virtual Machine on Yosemite? I have a Mid-2014 MacBook Pro (Retina), running OS X Yosemite. I would like to run OS X Lion within a virtual machine.\nIs this setup supported by Parallels/VirtualBox/VMware, even though this MacBook would not run Lion natively?\nIf so, how can I obtain a copy of Lion to install in the virtual machine? Would it help if I had access to a Mac Mini running Lion?\n\nA: Lion works fine as virtual machine - as well as all Mac OS X' since Snow Leopard* - in all of the mentioned apps. VMware/Parallels usually offer a better system integration and better performance though - with the downside that they aren't available for free.\nTo get the OS X Lion installer, check your purchases in your App Store account. If you have downloaded it previously on the MacMini, it should be available there.\n\n*: It's a bit tricky to install Yosemite in VirtualBox and performance is sluggish.\n\nA: If you haven't downloaded it before, you can purchase OS X Lion (10.7) for $19.99 (USD) and use the redeem code to download it.

However, you can confirm that everything is working by noticing that the server sent the time string (it's the line that starts with 57126 in the example above.\nIf this test works, then you know it isn't your firewall, router, or ISP.  That means we have to look at the NTP service running on your Mac.\nIf it dosen't work, chances are, something is being blocked.  Try turning off the firewall on both your mac and router (just temporarily for diagnostics).  Does it work now?\nRe-enable the router firewall and re-check.  Still working?   If not, your router is blocking the traffic.  If it is, re-enable the firewall on your mac.

I observed, that I couldn't connect USB flash drives to that Windows system, so I installed all Boot Camp drivers from the Boot Camp Assistant. I copied them to a USB flash drive and installed them on the Windows 7 partition. The problem was, that when I connected a USB flash drive to my Windows 7 partition, it was recognized as Generic USB. I actually couldn't eject it anymore. I read somewhere that this error was caused due to a version of the Intel USB driver i had installed earlier. That's why I deleted the Intel USB driver in the control panel. Now I can't seem to connect USB flash drives at all. I tried to drag the drivers to the Windows 7 partition via VMware, but it didn't work. When I double-click on setup.exe, it won't start.\nI have access to following programs or systems: VMware Fusion, Boot Camp Assistant, Windows 7, OS X partition.\nHow can I install the Intel USB drivers since I can't use an USB on my MacBook?\n\nA: You could upload the drivers to a service such as Dropbox...\n", "Q: Animation for charts in Keynote Does anyone know how to do the shrinking of chart animation in WWDC for the speed of swift?\n\nA: Keynote '09 supports chart builds, where individual segments/series of a chart can be separated in a build and animated individually.

So I wouldn't worry about the Fans running at full speed. Recently I've started to do more casual things. I've noticed when I turn my computer on the fan starts running at full speed. My computer's temperature is usually about 170 (150-220). The fan stills runs at full speed even when the total CPU usage 4% and with a low GPU usage. The only way I can turn my fans down is to open Macs Fan Control and set it to \"auto\". I have installed some fan control apps in the past but I uninstalled those. Could it be possible some leftovers are messing with my fan?\nEDIT: I have removed all leftovers and the problem still continues\n\n\nA: You mention that you use iStat Menus for temperature and a separate app for controlling the fan speed. iStat Menus has functionality to control fan speed by itself—make sure that you do not have the fan speed set to maximum in iStat Menus as this will override OS X unless another app then overrides iStat Menus.\n\nA: I had my fan always on very high and couldn't find the cause. With some research I found my solution. This might only apply to me, however, I thought I share it anyway, just in case.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Activity Monitor I realized that the process \"launchd\" uses up more than 80% of the CPU.\n\n*In Console \"system.log\" I found these lines repeating every second:   \n(com.google.keystone.system.agent[79014]): Could not find and/or execute program specified by service: 2: No such file or directory: /Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle/Contents/Resources/GoogleSoftwareUpdateAgent.app/Contents/MacOS/GoogleSoftwareUpdateAgent\n\nIn the folder ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ I simply deleted the file com.google.keystone.agent.plist.

On my iPad mini, when the screen is locked, I unlock it by just sliding to the right. This is very nice. \nI want to be able to do the same on my all new iPad Air 2. \nIt seems that the only way to do that is to turn off Touch ID (the fingerprint reading). I don't want to turn off Touch ID.\nHow can I be able to unlock my new iPad by just sliding to the right? Without turning off Touch ID.\nOn the new iPad, I have iOS 8.2.\n\nA: This isn't possible. Enabling Touch ID enables a passcode, which must be entered on the lock screen. If you do not wish to have a passcode, then you must disable Touch ID too. Also, because you have Touch ID enabled, you are unable to adjust the Require Passcode time in Settings → Touch ID & Passcode → Require Passcode.\nThe only workaround is to go to Settings → Touch ID & Passcode, disable iPhone Unlock, then set Require Passcode to After 1 hour. This means that you won't be prompted for a passcode if you use your device less than an hour after you last used it.\nVideo demonstration of workaround: Touch ID Require Passcode Timer\n\nA: You could theoretically jailbreak and install Mesalation.\nI may have already done this on my iPhone 6+. It may be working quite well. \n", "Q: Cannot install applications: error code -60008 I am trying to install new applications, but I keep getting this error message from the \"Copy\" application:\n\nThe operation can’t be completed because an unexpected error occurred\n  (error code -60008).\n\nThe applications I am trying to install are:   \n\n\n*\n\n*git from git-2.2.1-intel-universal-mavericks.dmg\n\n*SourceTree from SourceTree_2.0.5.2.dmg\n\n\nThe message is given after I drag the application on the destination directory, and after being asked if I want it to replace the old one. \nIn the past I had no problems with them. \n\nA: After many attempts, the only way I could install these applications has been through a manual copy from the command line:  \nsudo hdiutil attach ./SourceTree_2.0.5.2.dmg\nsudo cp -r /Volumes/SourceTree/SourceTree.app /Applications/\n\n", "Q: How to limit the bandwidth on a per-application (or per-process) basis in OS X Yosemite? Whenever I use Homebrew or Apple Store to download a large application, it sucks all my available bandwidth and I am then unable to browse the web.\nHow can limit the bandwidth per-application or per-process in OS X Yosemite (command line preferred, but GUI apps accepted)?\nI've played a bit with IceFloor application, which suggested I use ALF firewall, but I don't know how to set it up.\n\nA: The feature you want is confusingly called Quality of Service or \"QoS\" for short.\nThese days it is usually configured for an entire network, or subnet, using the management interface on a smart switch (which costs a little more than an Ethernet hub with the same number of ports, but not much more--here is a representative model from Cisco for under $100).\nThe closest equivalent that runs on OS X directly is ThrottleD from IntraArts:\n\nThrottled Pro [gives you] weighted network queues (WF2Q+) that guarantee bandwidth for all your essential network services like web browsing, email, and online gaming. In addition, it provides ACK packet priority which speeds up downloads when you are sending out a lot of data. This combination assures that you get the most out of your internet service.\n\nThe GUI version is $20, while the CLI version is donationware.\n\nA: Charles Proxy can do throttling. The app functions as a proxy server on your machine. You can redirect traffic that you want to throttle to its way. The throttled app has to come with its own proxy settings.\n\nA: The best way to throttle bandwidth on macOS is using Dummynet, which is built into the macOS kernel and works with the pf packet filter.\nThe only way to effectively tune bandwidth on a per-process basis is to identify which local ports are bound by the process and then create the corresponding pf dummynet rules. As far as I know the only macOS app that offers this option is Scudo (I'm the developer). \nScudo 1.0 beta 3 is currently available for free, more info about Scudo per-process bandwidth tuning can be found here: http://www.murusfirewall.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1919&p=3281#p3281 \n", "Q: Is there a way to change the iOS low battery warning to pop up at 25%? I have a jailbroken iPhone 4 running 7.1.2., I tried using the cydia tweak lowpowerbanner but I don't think it worked.

I would have expected to be able to right-click (secondary click) on a thumbnail of a picture and have the contextual menu give me the option to show the original picture document in Finder... but it's not there and I can't find it anywhere.\nI couldn't stand iPhoto, but at least it would allow you to access the original file directly in Finder. \nI understand why the Apple want to restrict direct access to the originals (stops users from moving files and screwing up their library), but what if I want to do something other than email or post the picture to social media?\nEDIT: I know I can just \"Show Package Contents\" or use the terminal to access ~/Pictures/Photos Library and hunt through the folder structure manually, but it's painfully inefficient considering all the sub folders\nIt may be a (deliberately) missing feature, but if anyone knows any way of jumping directly to the original instead of copying or exporting it, that would be great to know.\nUPDATE: I have got used to the way Photos works by now. Basically the thing to do is just to relax, let it manage your collection and only export what you need to as a copy, which you can later add back into Photos when you are finished with it. It is certainly a deliberate design choice by Apple, not a mistake.\n\nA: This is another approach:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Photos and go to the photo you want.\n\n*Right mouse click and choose Get info. Here you can copy the photo's file name\n\n*Click on the Magnifying glass icon on the top right corner of the screen. Paste the photo file name there. \n\n*Maybe you have to wait some seconds, then Double click \"Show All in Finder\" in the search dialog. \n\n\nA: As far as I can tell, there isn't an Apple-sanctioned method. The following is a workaround.\nThe original, or \"master\", picture has information not otherwise accessible through Photos, such as the focus point chosen by an SLR camera.\nClick on the picture in Photos. Press command i to read its Info. Double-click on the file name then copy it by pressing command c.\nOpen a Terminal window and paste the filename in the line below.\n> cp \"`find Pictures -name \"_DSC5407.JPG\" -print`\" ~/Desktop/\n\nThis may take a few seconds. In one step you'll locate the file and copy it, sparing yourself the trouble of copying/pasting the full path to that file.\nNow open the program you'd like to use to access the picture and/or its meta-information and use the copy on the Desktop. Delete that image when you're done.\nCompared to the ritual forced on users of every other major picture management software of doing organization themselves until Photos appeared, I find that the virtues of Photos still more than offset this major weakness.\n\nA: Photos expects you to export unmodified originals as copies, to preserve the integrity of the internal file management and for collection protection in the same way a database works – it's central to keeping the iCloud storage of your photo collection synced, stable, and functional.\nOnce you have exported a photo, you can then use mdls and mdfind to see what the \"copy\" looks like and where the original was stored.\nIn my case, they are all in ~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/Masters/2015/04/08 and such stored by year, month and date for my US locale computer. You'll only have to do this exercise a few times to nail down the internal storage for each time Apple chooses to change it going forward.\n\nA: I know this may not be exactly what you're looking for, but if you drag the photo to your desktop, it will make a copy there. I find this to be sufficient for most situations where I need to access a photo in the Finder.\n", "Q: Symbolic link to Emacs 24 not working I like to create a bin directory in my home directory and make it the first item in my $PATH.

I frequently use Command-Option-Power shortcut to send my Macbook to sleep (especially since closing the lid when I have external monitor doesn't trigger sleep). \nUnfortunately, this shortcut is very similar to Command-Control-Power which invokes cold reset of my Mac. I quite often accidentally press Command-Control-Power instead of Command-Option-Power. \nMy question would be: is there a way to disable Command-Control-Power completely (i.e. just use long power button press when I want to do cold reset)?\n\nA: Not easily. The keys trigger the SMC directly as far as I can discern, so you'd need to rewrite the firmware to make this change.\nYou can test this by powering off your Mac (or waiting until you next mistakenly command this) and hold the option key. While it's in the boot manager, only firmware is running and that key combination is effective.\nI'm also not aware of any OS X modification that would allow this, but asking people that make and use Karabiner might yield either another opinion or confirmation that my estimate of the difficulty is correct.\n\nA: When I had a problem with the cmd+Q shortcut, I went to system preferences, keyboard, shortcuts and changed the help menu shortcut to cmd+Q.  \n", "Q: Fan of my MacBook Air is Running at High Speed and Making Noise I have this noise problem recently.

Now I want to share my internet with my iphone. In the preferences, I found the option Internet Sharing, but there is no \"wifi\" option under \"To computers using:\". \"Only ZTE WCDMA Tech\" and \"Thunderbolt Bridge\".\nWhat to do?\n\nA: You can not bridge from WiFi to WiFi. You'll have to connect to the internet via a different port if you want to share the connection. I'm assuming the reason you don't connect to the network directly with your iPhone is some kind of client limit. You could use a Wireless Router to connect to the WiFi and repeat and reroute it. If you use an Apple Airport make sure you disable bridge mode. \n\nA: Please understand following.\nYou can not receive and transmit from same device (unless is it equipped that way). You Mac is not capable to do that, it is either or.\nIf you for example receive Internet via cable to your Mac then you can share (transmit) it using your Mac WiFi. \nSo the input and output can not be the same.\nSince you are receiving WiFi, your iPhone and mac should be able to get it from the source.\n", "Q: Can I run my MacBook Pro on just AC power? I have a used little MacBook Pro 13 inch Late 2008 5,1 and I was told it needed a battery. It charges, then it doesn't, and it shuts off at the most random times, so the thought occurred to me to take the battery out and run it straight from AC power. \nIt worked without a problem for a bit, then it just shut down. It would not come back on until I plugged the battery in to it.\nDo I need to keep a battery in my MacBook Pro in order to run it off A/C power?\n\nA: For some operations certain models require more power than the Power Supply alone can deliver at a given time. For this incident it relies on additional power from the battery. It is to be assumed that that is your machines issue. You'll probably need to get that battery replaced. The price is usually between 120-150 at an Apple Certified Repair Center in Austria. \n*My information is based on statements from AppleCare and their internal chat service for Certified Technicians.\n\nA: According to Everymac's MacBook Pro listing, there is no such thing1 as a MacBook Pro 13\" Late 2008 5,1. The earliest 13\" MacBook Pro was a June [Mid] 2009 5,5. The smallest Late 2008 5,1 model was only 15\". To clear things up:\n\n\n*\n\n*Maybe you mean MacBook and not MacBook Pro?\n\n*Is it a Unibody model, or Pre-Unibody?\n\n*Is it really a 13\" or 15\"?\n\n*Is your battery integrated? That is to say, can you easily remove the battery without opening the case up using a screwdriver?\n\n\nPlease clarify your question, and specify the correct MacBook [Pro] model. If you could provide a link to the model on the Everymac site, that would be useful. The more accurate the information you provide, the more accurate the answer. As Kevin Grabher implies in his answer, each model is different, and behaves differently.\nRegardless, I have been running a 17\" 2.4GHz MacBook Pro Mid/Late 2007, Santa Rosa model, 3,1 which for all intents and purposes as the same as an early 2008 4,1 (power wise) without a battery for two years, without an issue.\n\n1 If the Everymac site is wrong, and you do indeed have a 13\"\" MacBook Pro 5,1 then I apologise.\n\nA: I'm not sure about Macbook Pro 13 inch Late 2008 but today I unplug the battery from my MacBook Pro 15 inch late 2013 and it still works.\nI see the performance is a significant decrease. Laggy and slow response.\n\n\nA: My experience with my MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) is consistent with what Kevin Grabher posted: that the power adapter is not sufficient all the time.  \nThe power adapter that came with it, however, is much better than the one I used before the battery ceased to charge.  The one left over from an old MacBook would allow it begin booting before it would crash, every single time.  If you can find an adapter with a higher wattage rating than the one you're currently using, it might be good enough.  But I can't guarantee anything.  Since power adapters are also pretty expensive, I think you're better off getting a new battery.  But if you can borrow a high-watt adapter to try it out, it's worth giving it a shot (and please let us know if it worked). \n", "Q: VLC Player Staying On Top Of The Opened Applications On Desktop I want my VLC player not to minimize while I am on the windows of other applications.

This is an administrator account, every other newly created account on the system works fine.\nThis happened after creating multiple different certs for my NAS with alternative names and installing a different one every few days during some testing. After the final certificate was installed to the NAS, I deleted all old certificates from the keychain. Now all alternative names mentioned in an older version result in the above problem, while the newly added alternative names working well:\n\n\n*\n\n*mynas.local doesn't work (primary cert name)\n\n*old.mynas.local doesn't work (very first alternative name from early tests)\n\n*new.mynas.local works fine (new alternative name from last cert generation)\n\n\nBoth work fine on other systems, or with a newly created user.\nI tried the following without success:\n\n\n*\n\n*deleting ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.plist like mentioned in the other post above\n\n*resetting my default keychain\n\n\nA: Seems I finally found the solution (after trying so messing so many things up due to other solutions):\nUsing \"Internet Accounts\" to add a CalDAV account for the server.\nAs soon as I tried to add a new CalDAV account for \"https://old.mynas.local\" I got a \"untrusted certificate - what should I do\"-dialog and could successfully trust the new certificate. Then all problems in Safari vanished as well.\nIt seems OSX internet accounts uses its very own certificate system and this trusted one of the old certificates due to a CalDAV account previously configured and thus forbid access to the https server now serving the \"wrong\" certificate. The creepy thing: the dialog popping up was in English although my OS language is not English. \nThis solution might even work if one doesn't use CalDAV, because the certificate dialog should pop up as soon as the https connection is established, even before trying to check for DAV functionality.\n", "Q: Migration Assistant won't transfer files from 10.8 to 10.9 I tried to transfer my wife's files from her MacBook, running 10.8.4 to my MacBook Pro running 10.9.5.\nWe have identical logins on both computers.\nI was using Migration Assistant on both Macs which are on the same local network.\nI got the following error message:-\nThe selected source cannot be used for migration.\n\nYour other Mac is not running the latest version of OS X.

It seems pointless that you can't migrate from an old Mac. \n\nA: You shouldn't have any problems if you use Firewire/Thunderbolt Target mode (hold T at startup). Depending on what ports you have you will need a Firewire 800 cable or a Thunderbolt cable, or Thunderbolt to Firewire adapter if you're transferring to a newer Mac without a Firewire port from a model with a Firewire port.\nI've just tested this with a dummy account on a 2011 MacBook Pro running 10.6.8 transferring to a 2012 MacBook Pro running 10.9.5 - via Firewire - and it transferred fine with no errors.\n", "Q: MobileBackups is using too much space I am running short of space on my OS partition for some large files I want to install.\nI note that du shows 15G /.MobileBackups\nI have 2 Time Machine drives.

How can I figure out what's wrong with my server and/or setup?\n\nA: Here's how I'd troubleshoot things using terminal. You can use the console app as well to look at logs, but the serveradmin commands are more detailed than the server app allows currently and historically.\n\n\n*\n\n*curl localhost - this tests that port 80 is listening and a web server is running.\n\n*sudo serveradmin status web - this tests the service named web - n.b. you could have the curl command work and have apache running on port 80 but have your web status STOPPED as several other \"services\" start up apache such as Xcode, Profile Manager, etc...\n\n*Depending if the status was stopped, issue a start sudo serveradmin start web or issue an orderly shutdown and restart sudo serveradmin stop web && sleep 15 && sudo serveradmin start web\nIf you are not getting anything that makes sense from curl - perhaps look over the web logs:\ntail /var/log/apache2/access_log\ntail -20 /var/log/apache2/error_log\n\nOnce you've narrowed down if the problem is running apache and basic networking/DNS to get localhost to work or if there are problems with the code/content you can take next steps.\nAlso, looking over the tutorial/lesson - it looks like the selection was on HTTPS and not HTTP, so go back and ensure you are using https://myserver.local and https://localhost or http:// throughout and the server app is configuring the port (80 for http and 443 for https). For simplicity, I've just used port 80 for this answer and my server setup.\n", "Q: How to remove, but not delete, podcast episodes? I want to remove podcast episodes on my iPad to free some space.

It gave sound on power on but after stays grey. I tried all options available on net CMD+C, C, SHIFT+CMD+V but no success. \n\nA: Here is the set of Start up keys that you can try.\nI would try the Safe mode first, followed by Apple Hardware Test.\nIf it does not boot in Safe mode and passes the Apple Hardware Test, use the OS X recovery \"cmd+r\" to restore your OS X installation.\n\n\nA: Have you tried just command-v at startup? If it doesn't start up after that, check for any disk I/O Errors in the startup process.

In Xcode ⌘F hides the “Find and Replace” section of the dialog and only displays the “Find” part.\nIn TextEdit, ⌘F sets the focus (which means your text marker is in the box) in the “Find” textbox. ⌘⌥F sets the focus in the “Find and Replace” textbox. Pressing ⌘⌥F followed by ⌘F keeps the entire dialog open. In Xcode the focus is ALWAYS in the “Find” dialog, no matter what hotkey you invoked it with.\nI prefer the TextEdit behavior, but would also like consistency. Is there any way to make Xcode behave as TextEdit in this regard?\n\nA: Here is a Part solution for setting the focus for ⌘⌥F\nSave this Applescript down as a Text file instead of a script.\n#!/usr/bin/osascript\ntell application \"Xcode\" to activate\ndelay 0.5\ntell application \"System Events\"\n\n    tell process \"Xcode\"\n\n        keystroke \"z\" using {command down, option down}\n        delay 0.3\n\n        keystroke tab\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nIn terminal.app\nMake the script file executable by running \nchmod  +x /path/to/foo.applescript\n\nIn Xcode  go to the Preferences-> Key Bindings Tab.  \nAnd change the Find and Replace (menu) 's hotkey to ⌘⌥z\n\n\nNow still in Preferences go to the Behaviours Tab\nClick the '+' button to add a new custom Behaviour.\nName it and give it the hotkey ⌘⌥f\nOn the right hand pane of the Behaviours Tab scroll down to the bottom\nAnd using the Run  dropdown choose script. Select your Script file.\n\nNow you can use the ⌘⌥F and the find and replace will appear and focus will go to the replace field.\n\nAs to replicating the keeping the Replace in view if it is already showing when you hit  ⌘F.

I am on Yosemite. \nThanks for any help!\n\nA: The program Ukelele can be used to create custom keyboard layouts, including remapping control keys. It's not he simplest program to use, but it does give you more flexibility that what you have tried.\n\nA: It's no problem to add custom key-bindings to the predefined key-bindings in Karabiner/KeyRemap2MacBook.\nThe default method is to create a private.xml in ~/Application Support/KeyRemap4MacBook or ~/Application Support/Karabiner (depending which OS X is installed: KeyRemap4MacBook works in 10.4-10.8 and Karabiner works in 10.9-10.10).\nThe xml code you have to add to private.xml probably should look like this:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n    <item>\n        <name>Numpad-0 to Control_L</name>\n        <identifier>remap.numpad02controlL</identifier>\n        <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::KEYPAD_0, KeyCode::CONTROL_L</autogen>\n    </item>\n</root>\n\nReload the xml by hitting the ReloadXML button in Preferences -> Change Key after finishing the modification.\nThe non-standard way is to edit one of the numerous pre-defined key-bindings located at *.app/Contents/Resources/include/.

If a formula tries to write a file to this directory, the\n  install will fail during the link step.\nYou should probably chown /usr/local/etc\nWarning: The /usr/local directory is not writable.\n  Even if this directory was writable when you installed Homebrew, other\n  software may change permissions on this directory. Some versions of the\n  \"InstantOn\" component of Airfoil are known to do this.\nYou should probably change the ownership and permissions of /usr/local\n  back to your user account.\n\nIt's easy enough to reset the permissions back to my username. Afterwards brew seems to be fine.\nBut what is causing this to happen?\nIs there a log that shows what is causing the permissions to change?\n\nA: Turns out Filewave is the culprit. Filewave is a system management software used by our school to push software updates. Thanks for the input.\n\nA: I have just a rough idea how get the permission thief. This is not a solution to your problem, but more some sort of workaround.\nWhat about writing a watchdog in Automator or with Hazel (folder actions) for watching this particular folder but instead of adding a function like Scale images you just use a shellscript which executes several shell commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the folder is changed in any way, just snapshot the permissions and the currently accessing process id with fuser <foldername>.\n\n*then you lookup in the process table the process id (ps auxwwwwww | grep <process id>) and finally\n\n*write an email to yourself with these collected informations.\n\n\nUnfortunately I am no Automator sadhu, but I found out by Google there are plenty of solutions for such a similar problem.\n\nA: I had this exact same issue, and it turns out Sophos auto-update was to blame. I figured this out by running: sudo fs_usage | grep \"usr/local\"\nIt took a while, but eventually I saw Sophos's helpfully named \"Installation\" daemon messing with /usr/local's permissions.\nI'm still trying to figure out an appropriate work around for this behavior.\nEDIT: I believe Sophos has fixed this issue, see the link in the comments of this answer. It seems to be fixed for me at least!\n\nA: If you use Time Machine, you can find the approximate time when permissions changed by exploring Backups.backupdb in Terminal. Use ls -ld in the timestamped folders, e.g.\nls -ld /Volumes/Backup/Backups.backupdb/Mac/2015-12-25-120000/Macintosh\\ HD/usr/local \n\nWhich will show owner and group information.\nOnce you have the date the change occurred, you can sleuth out what else might have changed then on your system. A simple technique is to use Finder's File › Find and add a Last modified date criterion. Other good tools are find and mdfind in Terminal.\n\nA: Have you used Disk Utility select Macintosh HD then run Verify Disk Permission and then Repair Disk Permission if needed, rather than doing it manually?\nNow this shouldn't fix on your issue, but it's a good 'known' starting point to see when home-brew changes the permissions.  It could show up the underlying issue if you are luck.\nAlso new update -v for more verbose output, plus old logs are here ~/Library/Logs/Homebrew as per Where does homebrew log?\n\nA: This is a side effect of updating your system; OS X probably does some across-the-board permission \"repair\" during the update process as /usr/local is nested in a root-owned folder.\n", "Q: Can I search for something on Google directly from Spotlight?

Installed Yosemite as soon as it was out. The SSD works perfect until day before yesterday. Mac has become too slow, every click takes 15 seconds to respond, boot takes 5 minutes. I then cloned the SSD to a normal HDD and replaced it with it. It boots and works very well from the HDD. I have tried fresh install on the SSD by placing it in the same main harddrive bay and left it for 10 hours but it won't finish installing.\nThen, I have tried placing it in a SATA to USB cable and tried installing Yosemite on it. It finishes within 15 minutes, boots and works very well. I placed it again in the harddrive bay and its totally slows down. I then figured that the problem could be with the SSD and its compatibility with my mac.\nSo, to check, installed windows on the SSD while keeping in the harddrive bay of the MBP. It installs and works perfectly. So, it ain't a hardware compatibility issue.\nFinally, after quite a testing, the problem is when the SSD is placed in the main harddrive bay of the MBP and Yosemite is being installed or installed. With Yosemite and the SSD in an USB, it works perfectly.\nHas anyone experienced a similar issue or have any suggestions for a fix?\nDetails: Macbook Pro 8,1 (Early 2011), ADATA 128GB 6gbps SSD\n\nA: The problem seems to be only with that particular SSD and Mac OS X, because it works with other SSDs. My feeling is that garbage collection or TRIM are to be blame in this case. TRIM is disabled by Apple for third party drives and ADATA SSD I had didn't have any inbuilt garbage collection. \nBought a Samsung EVO now, it has inbuilt garbage collection and doesn't necessarily need TRIM. If you have an SSD which can't do garbage collection, there are options to enable TRIM on Mac OS X, look for them and enable TRIM.\n", "Q: How to mirror iPod Touch 4th-gen to TV?

Since putting back the old drive did not clear the problem, it's worth checking if this may have somehow happened. \n", "Q: Windows appear in odd places in Yosemite Since upgrading to Yosemite when it came out, windows in different apps randomly appear in odd places - eg, not connected to their parents window. Here's the Chrome search bar:\n\nSometimes it's worse, sometimes it's better, but it's never 100% OK. This happens in multiple apps. Restarting the OS or the app does not help. How can I made windows appear in normal places again on Yosemite?\n\nA: Might be worth trying to login as another user, either creating a new user, or using the guest account to see if it happens there also, if it does not. It would suggest the issue is with the preferences in your user account, especially if it only happens in some apps, you can look to clear their caches and preferences. However if it continues, I would suggest backup and reinstall the operating system.\n", "Q: How can one get last wakeup from screen saver time on Mac OS One can use pmset -g log to get to the info about Wake and Start events of Mac OS. But pmset doesn't seem to make any special assertions to the log when system goes into screen saver mode, and what particularly of interest to me, when the screen saver quits. \nWhat command or log file I can use to find out when the last wake from screen saver event occurred?\n\nA: Your two filters to type in the Console log would be:\nFor screen saver activate: screenshot\nFor screen saver end: DidWake\nOpen the Console in the Utility folder and while having selected \"all messages\" type the above in the filter/search window.\n", "Q: Making Favorites in Finder collapse according to number of items in it I know favorites can collapse completely but how possible is it to make a dropdown collapse inside the Favorites itself so that when the items reach about 5, it automatically hides all others with a dropdown arrow for seeing the others?\n\nA: This is currently not possible.

If I move a photo from iPhoto to the desktop, and then trash, is the original still saved in the library?\n\nA: Yes.\nYou can't move a photo from iPhoto out of the library simply by dragging it. It'll be a copy, therefore deleting it from the desktop will not remove the original from the iPhoto library.\n\nA: If you moved it, no.\nIf you copied it, yes.\nIt really depends how you 'moved' it.\n", "Q: How to auto-complete url in safari Can someone tell me what is the keyboard shortcut for auto completing a URL in the safari address bar? \nPS: Like in chrome or Firefox the keyboard shortcut is Control+return, Command+Return.\n\nA: When the list of suggestions comes up use the up/down arrow keys to scroll through the options.

I do have a bunch of ghost photos that I can't delete though. They are from my old phone which is not an apple product and I am having storage issues because of it.\n\nA: Assuming you have an iPhone; probably best to backup your phone through iTunes then do a factory reset and restore your data. If they are ghost/misbehaving photos then they won't be included in the backup and hence won't be restored back onto your phone.\n", "Q: Old Users App Store Account is still active on my computer I just picked up a used Mac for a great price (I might add but doesn't have much to do with my question); and the old users App Store Account is still linked to him, even though I have everything else going with my iCloud account and or Apple password.

Check the pictures:\n\n\nSo right now I'm unable to install OSX... Any ideas?\n\nA: It may be that your hard drive is no longer working properly and needs to be replaced.  However, you can try to diagnose using the Apple Diagnostics.\nIf hardware problems are indicated or Apple Diagnostics does not recognize your hard drive either, it may be worth looking for a Retail Store or AASP to get it looked at.\nIf you are still in Apple's hardware coverage, such repair will usually be free of charge.\n", "Q: Textedit Yosemite erase function In OS X Textedit, I was able to remove unwanted material from images scanned to JPEGs by using the select tool to define the area to be removed and then pressing \"delete\", resulting in a white area on a white background. How do I do that using Textedit Yosemite?\n\nA: That can not be done with TextEdit application.\nYou were probably using the Preview and it will do as you say. \nApplications that allow you modifying the JPEG are many but the simplest one are Paintbrush or Gimp.\n", "Q: Have the Retina MacBook Pro GPU Hangs been fixed? I have an early 2013 15-inch retina Macbook Pro running the latest stable version of Yosemite on which I've encountered the fabled GPU hang-ups, detailed in this question. I'm almost certain I have the same issue as described; I see similar messages on the console, and it seems to only happen when I open an intensive app like photoshop, thus causing the computer to switch between graphics devices. \nIn the way of possible fixes, I understand that one can disable graphics switching, but that decreases battery life, which I'd like to avoid. However, I haven't seen the issue in a few weeks anyway, which makes me wonder if it hasn't been fixed. The app store doesn't show any major system updates in the past 30 days. Was there an update I didn't notice that fixed this issue?\n\nA: Bring it into your nearest Apple Store or Apple Authorized Service Provider and they can run a VST (AST Video System Test). That specific MBPr model is eligible for a repair program right now, so you'll get a free Logic Board replacement if it fails the VST test.

VirtualBox detect the pen drive but its name is greyed our in GUI. And I couldn't pick it from the list. How can I use this pen drive with the virtual machine? \n\n\nA: I found the solution myself. All I need was to eject usb pen drive from mac's desktop. When the drive ejected, it became available in VirtualBox.\n\nA: I had to eject my USB from the host OS (macOS) but I was also using a USB 3.0 so I had to:\n\n\n*\n\n*stop my VM\n\n*select my VM from the master list\n\n*Go to Setting > Setting > Ports > USB > USB 3.0\n\n*Add my USB\n\n\nA: The reason that it is grayed out is because it is in use by the host system.

I now want to use this hard drive as the Time Machine drive hooked up to my AirportExtreme. Will doing so require reformatting the HD? Or will it be a simple plug-and-play\n\nA: I have done this before and all I had to do was connect the HDD to the AirportExtreme and point Time Machine to the new location.\nI would recommend copying the backups from the drive to another drive if you can before doing so, there are some instances where Time Machine will reject the backups and then you will need to format the drive.\n", "Q: iPhone app that records audio during specific time I was looking for an app that records audio during specific time.\nFor example: I want talk for 1 minute and this app should record just 1 minute.

In order to run Chrome from the Terminal application, I have to do\nopen -a \"Google Chrome\" index.html\n\nrather than just something like \"chrome index.html\".\nThe same also seems to be true for Firefox.\nIt's not because I can't open any GUI applications from the command line. For example, I can do mate . to open TextMate.\nWhat's the rationale for web browsers not having a command like \"chrome index.html\"?\n\nA: It's probably safe to say that most Mac users do not open GUI apps via the CLI, which is why most GUI apps do not include the CLI support like TextMate does.  In other words, TextMate actually includes a binary executable named mate which is installed in $PATH, which is why one does not need to preface it with the open command like opening a GUI app which does not include that type of CLI support.\nIf you want to emulate that behavior then create a script named chrome placed in the $PATH, typically /usr/local/bin/ for something such as this.\nExample:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ -n \"$1\" ]; then\n    open -a \"Google Chrome\" \"$1\"\nelse\n    open -a \"Google Chrome\"\nfi\n\nSave the above code in a plain text file named chrome and make it executable by:\nchmod +x chrome\nThen you can start Google Chrome via CLI by chrome or chrome URL where URL is properly formatted if not just a filename in the $PWD.\n\nA: To open a application from the terminal it has to be in one of the paths of your $PATH environnement variable. \nBy default /Application/ where Chrome is located is not in your path. Therefore you can't launch an application without giving the full path to your app. \n/Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome http://google.com\n\nWill work. \n", "Q: MacBook Pro battery percentage jumping down and up Recently, my 2011 MacBook Pro 13' produces strange instantaneous jumps in battery percentage.

I see one can download \"A USB flash drive image file\" containing rEFInd. I believe you would be better off using my instructions. If you have any problems with my steps, let me know.\nSteps to Install rEFInd on a USB Flash Drive\n\n\n*\n\n*Download \"A binary zip file\" from The rEFInd Boot Manager:\nGetting rEFInd page. I assume this will be saved in your Downloads folder.\n\n*Insert a flash drive into a USB port. Open the Disk Utility application and partition the drive as follows.\n\nThe format of the second partition does not matter. I happened to use MS-DOS (FAT). Before applying changes, click the Options... button and make sure \"GUID Partition Table\" is selected.\n\nApply the changes and quit the Disk Utility.\n\n*Open the Terminal application.

(Hint: To get a better view, open this image in a new window.)\n\nSteps to Uninstall Automatic Booting to rEFInd\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to OS X.\n\n*Open \"Startup Disk\" from the \"System Preferences\" window. The \"rEFInd\" text, under the external disk icon, should be highlighted. \n\n*Click on the internal disk icon representing OS X. The highlighting should switch to the text under this icon, as shown below.\n\n\n\n*Quit System Preferences, shutdown the computer and remove the USB flash drive.\n\n\nWhat is next?\nThe icons files are store in the following folder.\n/Volumes/rEFInd/System/Library/CoreServices/icons\n\nIt should be just a matter of substituting your icons for the default ones.\nIf you find any of this useful, let me know. The next step would involve installing rEFInd on your internal hard disk. I do not yet know enough about the partitioning of your internal disk to answer the questions I have. Mainly, I need to see the output from the commands given below.\ndiskutil list\ndisktuili cs list\nsudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0\nsudo fdisk /dev/disk0\n\nNone of these command change your computer.

The recommended use of pf is to block all incoming ports and then open those you need.\nI want my system to work properly and don't miss things like Automatic Updates, AirPlay, AirDrop, etc.\nI came across the following list but it doesn't specify if it is incoming or outgoing. \nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202944\nHow can i find out?\n\nA: As a rule of thumb: If you provide a service on your Mac, you have to open the appropriate incoming port(s).\nExample:\nIf you have a standard web server running on your Mac, you have to open the incoming port 80 (http) and/or port 443 (https). You may customize those ports in the web server config (e.g. 10080/10443) and then would have to open the respective ports and close the default ones. To access the web server you would have to enter www.mywebserver.home:10080 in your browser.\nFrom the viewpoint of a client the ports mentioned in the Apple list are all destination ports (To which port do i have to send a message to get a proper reply?). The source port may be an arbitrary one (mostly above port ~10000).\nFrom the viewpoint of a server the ports mentioned in the Apple list are all source ports (or \"incoming ports\").\nSo if you don't provide any services you may block all incoming ports.\nAs such Automatic Updates is no service you provide on your Mac, because you don't run a Software Update Server.\nA different thing are AirDrop, AirPlay (and besides some push services), which don't look like servicing (like a traditional server) but indeed do. If you didn't exclude local networks previously in the firewall settings, you have to open the respective incoming ports on the servicing host(s).\n\nA: I would recommend you to use PFLists that acts as a GUI on top of pf:\nbrew install pflists\nIt comes with different presets and a list of services with associated protocols / ports.\nIn your case the Airdrop service uses port 8770 (tcp/udp).\nSee complete list of ports from the PFLists screenshot below where you can find AirPlay, notifications, etc.\n\n", "Q: Getting quotation marks to the bottom of a line Quotation marks go to the top of the line in MS Word, like “this”.\nHowever, official EU text as well as some Dutch publications use quotation marks as follows: \nVan Slingelandt: „We vinden het belangrijk dat gemaakte afspraken nagekomen worden.”\nThe opening quotation marks are at the bottom of the line. How do I get MS Word to do the same? Is there a setting in MS Word, or do I need to do something in the Apple/Mac environment?\n\nA: On my (german) mac keyboard \n\n\n*\n\n*I get „ when i press ALT + SHIFT + w \n\n*I get ” when I press ALT + SHIFT + 2\n\n*and I get “ when I press ALT + 2\n\n\nOn your keyboard this can be different depending depending on the language and/or setup. Another option I recently saw here could be as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*get „ when you press ALT + . \n\n*get “ when you press ALT + [ \n\n\nIn order to find the right key combination it can be useful to turn on the keyboard viewer from \"preferences > languages and text > input sources ...\"  as described here. \n\nA: There is a setting in Word (which I thought was enabled by default) which is called \"Smart Quotes\" in the auto-correction part.  Since I am not with the Mac at the moment, I do not know the exact location or wording, however.\nNOTE: Smart Quotes depend on the spelling language you use at the cursor location.  So, if the set language of the part of your document you are currently working on is set to US, it will use the upper quotes.  If it is set to Dutch, it will use the correct ones for that language.\nTo make sure that the entire document is set to the correct language, highlight all text (Cmd+A), then choose the spelling language.\n", "Q: Unable to restore iPhone 5 after it dropped I have dropped my iPhone 5 last night and since then its either been flashing the apple logo on and off or just stuck in recovery mode. I have tried restoring it, but I just get error 21 or error 2002. I have tried using reboots, holding the home button and the on/off button and nothing seem to work.\nHow can I restore the iPhone?\n\nA: Error 21 indicates issues with the power source/battery, error 2002 usually is a connection problem. Given the fall your phone did, it's a safe guess that something broke or got disconnected on the inside.\nIt's probably best to go to your nearest Apple Retail Store (if this is an option), your vendor or a local iPhone repair shop. If you are used to fixing electronic devices yourself, you may also find instructions on ifixit.com (search for the error number).\n", "Q: Using my own server instead of iCloud I am currently paying like a dollar a month for 20 GB iCloud storage, but I am just now building a new computer and am hoping to install an Amahi server on it so that I can have my own 'Dropbox' type of cloud access wherever I go.\nAm I able to use a service like Amahi (or anything else) to redirect my iCloud backup from apple's servers to my own? Instead of paying $12 a year for 20 GB of storage, I could be paying no subscription for 3+ TB of space.\n\nA: I found OwnCloud (and its successor nextCloud), which does at least appear to give the option to host your own cloud on your own server, that is to sync files across devices: desktop, Apple, Android etc.\nIt's open source and free, with iOS/Android apps around $1 USD / $0 USD respectively.\nIt has been thoroughly tested on many different architectures.\n\nA: Now with a fully vetted files app and new file sync provider API on macOS and iOS it’s much easier to bring whichever file storage solution you want. Automated device backup is still challenging, but ensuring your main file storage hit other accounts should let you ride the free iCloud tier for backups - especially if you can turn off categories you don’t need backed up to iCloud due to cost considerations.\nIn 2015 and the following couple years, it was much harder to avoid iCloud and then, the simplest way to accomplish equivalent functionality was to set up several things.\nThis isn't meant to be a full iCloud dopplegänger but instead to serve equivalent high level functions of iOS backup and iOS file sharing endpoint.\n\n*\n\n*Disable iCloud backups and instead back up to iTunes via WiFi.\n\n*(optional) Set up a VPN profile on iOS to have the device be able to VPN in to the local WiFi while on the road.\n\n*Set up WebDav server - optionally expose it to the internet with either a static IP address and/or one of the dynamic DNS services.\n\n*(bonus) set up a cloud or single point backup so that the server is backed up offsite. Look at CrashPlan or Amazon's various storage options (glacier or S3 are written up in several places on the internet with \"How To\" and their new cloud drive offering might also work well)\n\nThis allows DropBox like file sharing over WebDav - your own personal cloud that is optionally backed up outside your house periodically (but not a true cloud where your iPhone could hit multiple storage tiers at once). You could then decide if backups while on the road are needed and set up/test the VPN access to iTunes for networked backups.\n\nA: In a nutshell: No, you can't.\nApple uses proprietary protocols for iCloud access (both data and backup) so you can't just switch backends by redirecting some DNS entries. And as far as I know, nobody has reverse engineered the protocols yet (at least not the full set required to implement an alternative server-side solution).\n\nA: Western Digital makes a NAS device that will automatically back up your iPhone photos to it's hard drive and act the same way as iCloud, but without a fee. Plus you will be hosting the data on your home network. check it out.\nhttp://mycloud.com/\n\nA: You can take a look at iCloud DNS Bypass... it connects to a remote server instead in between.. its not backup thing, but thought it might help..\n", "Q: Trouble re-downloading paid Apple apps bundled for free with new Mac I recently bought a 13\" retina MacBook Pro. I set it up with my Apple ID. I subsequently changed my Apple ID password on my iPhone. When I came back to log into the MacBook, it wouldn't let me with my new password. So I tired my old password which didn't work as well. I performed a factory restore on it and that seemed to work. But I then noticed that it deleted certain apps that where already installed on the computer such as iMovie. When I go to the Mac App Store to re-download them, they are shown as paid apps.\nHow do I download them again for free?\n\nA: To obtain the paid apps that were included for free with your Mac, launch the Mac App Store and login with your Apple ID. Check under the Updates section and see if the apps appear there, with Accept appearing where the Update button normally would be (towards the right).\nIf you cannot access them that way, check your purchases by going to the Purchases section in the Mac App store. They must have already been linked to your Apple ID.\nIf both the above options fail, open a case with Apple Support. They can verify your ownership of the computer and can issue download codes and/or link the purchase to your Apple ID. That way, you will be able to retrieve them for free.\n", "Q: How can I prevent iTunes from auto starting when I plug in an iOS device? i know we already have topics about it, but i did not found my solution.\nSo i don't want to start iTunes, when i plug in iDevices.

I have already turned off the autosync.\n\nA: Run this command in a terminal to disable that behavior:\ndefaults write com.apple.iTunesHelper ignore-devices 1\n\n\nA: The only way I know to not have to set it for each & every device individually is to disable the iTunesHelper app from Users & Group control panel\n\npicture source http://www.redmondpie.com/disable-automatic-itunes-launch-when-iphone-is-connected-to-windows-or-mac-how-to/\n\nA: If the problem you're experiencing is that the iPad connections trigger a New iPad activation dialog, you can turn this off by typing this terminal command when iTunes is not running:\ndefaults write com.apple.iTunes StoreActivationMode -integer 1\n\nYou can turn on the new iPad Activation dialog with this command:\ndefaults delete com.apple.iTunes StoreActivationMode\n\nRemember, iTunes cannot be running when either of these commands is run.\n", "Q: Mac pro early 2008 won´t boot from pendrive with yosemite install app Mac pro 8 core early 2008 mountain lion installed.\nI need to clean install Yosemite.\nThe pendrive does not show when you press alt, at the boot screen.\nNevertheless it shows on configuration startup disk, but is not booting from this volume.\nThe problem does not seem to be on the pendrive, since it works fine on a macbook, but does not show on the mac pro.\nPlease help, I´ve tried many times with no success.\n\nA: Here's something to try...\nIf your Mac Pro has issues with booting from USB but will boot from a DVD, create a DVD from the USB installer. If you know how to do this then ignore the rest, grab a dual-layer DVD and get cracking. If not, read on...\nFirst, mount your USB installer and then go to Disk Utility. Highlight the partition Install OS X Yosemite on the upper left pane then go to File > New > Disk Image from \"Install OS X Yosemite\". Select DVD/CD master as the image format then hit the Save button when you're ready.\nAfter a few moments you will have a disk image with the extension .cdr. This should be listed in Disk Utility on the lower left pane - highlight it and select Burn. You will need a dual-layer DVD for the burning operation.\nIf you can boot from the original Apple installation discs you should be able to boot from your newly created DVD, and hopefully it will appear as a boot option. Be warned, booting from the Yosemite DVD will take a small eternity, the installation itself will take quite a bit longer. Still, it's better to get there slowly than not at all ;-)\nAlternatively, if you have a spare hard disk you could clone the Yosemite USB installer partition onto that using Disk Utility's Restore function. This should in theory be much quicker but I've not tried it out yet. I have had a successful boot and install from DVD on a MacBook (school's out for Easter so no access to a Mac Pro at the moment) so at least we know it's possible to create a working DVD installer.\nSmall addition - when installing from DVD the progress bars will lead to you to believe it's actually going to take forever, if not slightly longer. However, these do tend to stick at certain points while the system's busy and the whole process should be done in just over an hour. \n", "Q: Macbook Pro 2012 md101 gpu throttling When playing games on Macbook Pro 13 inch 2012 md101 under Windows 8.1 the temperature rises to 100 degrees pretty fast and gpu starts throttling giving a huge slowdown in games. Is this a normal behaviour of this Macbook? If not what should I do to fix this? \nThis notebook has Core i5-3210M and Intel HD Graphics 4000\nI was thinking about changing termal paste.\n\n\nA: Yes this is perfectly normal behaviour. You can change the thermal paste if you want but you won't see any great difference in thermal levels. The Intel HD4000 GPU is integrated in the i5 die and CPU/GPU throttling is the main protection mechanism for thermal limiting .\n", "Q: Why will Xcode not update? Software update always tells me Xcode 6.2 is available.  Other updates install when requested, but when I click the XCode update button it asks me for Apple ID and password.  Other items update without asking.\nWhen I enter those, I never get an error message, and the button dims.  But nothing else ever happens.  Other things will show a progress bar and change the button text to say what is happening.\nI accepted the workaround even though it's not exactly an answer to the question as asked.  But it's worth noting here that whatever caused it has been magically corrected.\n\nA: As a workaround, you can download it directly from Downloads for Apple Developers if you have a (free or paid) account.\nUpdate:  At one time the included link above would take one directly to Downloads for Apple Developers after signing in, however as time goes by things change. So once logged into your Developer account add downloads to the address in the address bar so it shows as https://developer.apple.com/downloads and then press enter.\nYou should then be at the Downloads for Apple Developers section as shown in the cropped clip below.\n\n", "Q: Why does iBooks Author refuse to open .epub? I have an epub for a hundred-year-old book with the illustrations from the original missing, and no links from TOC to the appropriate places.  Wanting to correct that, I tried to open it from iBooks Author 2.2.  The pub is grayed out in the Open dialogue.  If I select \"all files,\" it is un-grayed, but either way, it cannot be selected.\nI don't think the problem is DRM, because the file came from project Gutenberg.  Also, Calibre allows me to convert to PDF and back, but the result still cannot be loaded.  Talking New Media claims that this version of iBooks Author adds the ability to open these files.\nThe \"advanced\" option to \"add to ibooks as proof\" also won't open it.  Experimenting, I created new epubs from several PDF originals with calibre, and it won't open those either.\n\nA: iBooks Author only opens iBooks Author projects (.ibooks). You need to create a new iBooks Author file and import the ePub into it. Go to New → New from ePub file….\n", "Q: Anything in Mac OS to interfere with using a disk through a USB hub?

I have done that, and the error message did not occur when I quit.  But what is really surprising is that I have since opened and closed iTunes several times not in safe mode, and the problem seems to have disappeared!  I am not quite sure what happened, or how I fixed it (or if the fix will last), and I will still happily award the bounty to anybody who can explain what was and is going on here.\n\nA: The EtreCheck scan has found multiple pieces of adware on your Mac, remove them all. My guess is that one of these adware were trying to hook into the iTunes executable (or the operating system itself) and causing the crashes when iTunes was trying to terminate.\nYou can find instructions on how to remove Conduit here. I'd remove this first and then open the Extensions window in Safari and uninstall the three extensions that were identified as adware.\nYou have Sophos installed. I'd make sure it is up to date and updating regularly. Ideally you'd have hoped it would have caught and prevented these infections.\nIn the interests of system stability, I'd also go through the list of installed software that EtreCheck has found and remove anything you no longer use. For example the Startup Items which no longer work in Yosemite.\n", "Q: How to make fullscreen app's space appear next to the current space? How to make fullscreen app's space appear next to the current space?\nNormally it goes to the end of the list of spaces.\n\nA: Clicking the fullscreen icon \n\nwhile pressing the alt key will put it right next to the current desktop, at least on Mavericks.\n\nA: I assume you mean that, when you make an app window enter fullscreen mode, you want that window to appear next to the current Space (by default it appears at the end of the Spaces list, as you say).\nOn macOS 11 Big Sur (and possibly older versions), you can do this as follows:\n\n*\n\n*Drag the (non-fullscreen) window you want to make fullscreen up to the top of the screen.\n\n*Mission Control appears. Keep holding the mouse button.\n\n*The window you're dragging turns into a little thumbnail.\n\n*In the row of Spaces at the top, drag the thumbnail to the left/right of the Space where you want it to appear. A new space will open up, named after the app you're dragging.\n\n*Let go of the mouse button to drop the app into that Space in fullscreen mode.\n\n(If you mean, how do you move an existing fullscreen app so it's next to another space, then just go into Mission Control and drag the app's thumbnail in the row of Spaces at the top.)\n", "Q: iPhone 5 cannot see campus network I have an iPhone 5, which works great at coffee shops, home, work etc.. but when I am on campus it cannot find the wireless network. There is not even a listing for the network, or the guest network that also exists. But, anywhere else it works fine.  I tried resetting the device, but the behaviour persists. \nWhat could be wrong? Please help me figure this out.\n\nA: Is it at all possible that the campus network does not broadcast it's SSID?\nTry this, go into Settings -> Wi-Fi and tap on \"Other...\"\nType in the name of the campus WiFi network and its password.\nWill that allow you to connect?\n\nA: *\n\n*Get Airport Utility \n\n*Open Settings App and turn on Wi-Fi Scanner for that app\n\n*Open Airport Utility\n\n*Tap Wi-Fi Scan\n\n*Optionally enter the network name if you care only for that SSID\n\n\nAfter getting a minute or two of scans, you can inspect the RSSI to make sure the network is viable from a reception point.\nIf that's good, then you need to get help from the admin on that network to know why a specific base station isn't letting your iPhone on. Alternatively, you could open a support ticket with Apple and see about getting the raw logs from the iPhone. You'll likely have to pay for that option either by being an enterprise account, have apple certifications or pay per incident, so you'll likely want to make sure the campus resources can't help you out before going to Apple.\n", "Q: iTunes 12 fails to sync on my iPhone 6 (iOS 8.2) and also other apps In order to fix this bug I've been trying everything I could find on the internet. Basically whenever I try to sync music or videos from iTunes to my iPhone (they have both the latest version) and during the last step of that, iTunes would randomly stop just few songs from the start and it would wait until sync timeout.\nThen I've also tried to export the songs with CopyTrans Manager which is a 3rd party tool similar to iTunes, but I get the same error: sync -> then stop at a random song -> app timeout. \nThen I've tried an app from the store called PlayerExtreme, and I've tried exporting song to that using iExplorer but I still get the timeout.\nThe only error I got was that my iPhone disconnects during the process, which is weird since I've tried using 2 different USB cables (both original) and both of them randomly disconnect during the sync and they both reconnect few seconds later.\nOther stuff I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*toggle sync / no sync music from iTunes\n\n*sync only selected music and videos\n\n*manually manage music and videos\n\n*delete all music from my iPhone\n\n*resetting network settings (someone got it to work with that)\n\n*airplane mode\n\n\nI've also read it could be because of duplicate songs in the library but I'm sure I don't have any duplicate song.\nAlso I'm not a iTunes Match customer.\nEDIT: I get this error quite often : \"This accessory may not be supported\". Especially when I'm charging it on my PC and the battery percentage gets closer to 100%. I got the same error with both my 2 original USB cables.\nEDIT 2: IMO it's either an iOS 8 bug or some kind of weird problem with my USB ports.\n\nA: Changing USB port fixed my problem. At first I was using an USB 2.0 port on my case, then I moved my iPhone to the USB 3.0 port of my motherboard and it worked.\n", "Q: safari cannot play audio in wikipedia The safari in my iPhone 6 can not play audio file in Wikipedia,  for example, the following picture shows a audio file one a Wikipedia page but I cannot play it. what's wrong with it and how to fix it?\n\n\nA: Actually, Wikipedia provided solutions for this, Wikipedia:Media help (audio and video)\n\nIt is highly recommended that you use a program which is capable of playing both Vorbis audio and Theora video since these two different media formats are often in the same digital container format, Ogg.\n\n\n\nA: In Wikipedia create an account and login. Then you can play ogg files. For example this:\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cher_-_Dark_Lady.ogg\nFor other sites I don't have any specific solutions. But obviously Safari supports ogg, at least in iOS 14.2\n\n\nA: Safari does not support playing OGG files. I haven't checked but there are probably apps available that allow you to play OGG files, a simple App Store search of \"ogg audio player\" should yield some results.\n\nA: Safari does not natively support OGG audio files, you need install an OGG plugin. Or just install another web browser on your phone which supports OGG files.\n", "Q: \"File\" NOT \"App\"... can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer got an mp3 via email from a musician friend of mine today. when i try to open it (in any app... itunes, quicktime, vlc, etc), i get this message as if it's a new Application that i just downloaded from the internet.\ni KNOW what to do if it's an app (keep my system prefs security settings & secondary-click on it & choose open that way) that i trust, but i've never experienced this happening before with \"Files\" that i trust.\nis this normal & safe to open as if it was an app? or could something have happened to it & opening could be bad? or could it have been intercepted & actually be some sort of trojan or something?\n\nA: I had the same problem just now after I right-clicked on a file and changed the application it opened with using \"Open With > Other...\" and then selecting the application. The problem was solved when I right-clicked on the same file, went to Get Info, and changed the application it opened with there using the dropdown menu and then the \"Change All...\" button. It's \"more permanent,\" is how I conceptualize it.\nI should say, it seems that I had to do the above for each file that I had tried to open after changing the app with \"Open With > Other...\" That is, I tried to open 2 or 3 mp3s with the new app after using \"Open With > Other...\" so I had to change the default app for each of those particular mp3s using Get Info. All other mp3s open just fine in the newly-default app.\n\nA: I have two guesses:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is an application masked as an mp3 file. Yes, you should not open it.\n\n*Mac OS X gives warnings \"blabla downloaded from internet\" for anything, not just apps downoaded from Internet. If you are sure the file is fine, play it back.\n\n\nBy the way, mp3 files must be able to play back by just quick previewing them (Space bar).\n\nA: The file has been \"Quarantined\" by macOS. There are various situations where this can happen.\nConsider wether the file might be malware, and delete it if so.\nOtherwise, you can un-quarantine the file by right clicking on it and selecting \"Open\" - you will be given a warning, which you should read, then confirm you wish to open it from that dialog.\nAlternatively to remove a large number from quarantine with the following at a command:\nxattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/file\n\nA: This is clearly a bug in (some version of macOS) - I have the same issue.\nI have an MP3 - it plays in iTunes. I can open it with Quicktime - it plays okay there. As soon as I right click on it and tell it to always open using Quicktime, suddenly, macOS doesn't trust it anymore - it won't open it because it is from an unidentified developer. But as soon as I tell macOS to open ALL mp3s using Quicktime, macOS trusts it again. Clearly it is not a problem with Quicktime or with the file itself being or looking untrustworthy, but with a bug in macOS that gets confused between files and apps when an individual file is set to \"always open with\".\n\nA: No - this is neither normal and possibly unsafe.\nApple and macOS is telling you there isn’t something right with that file - use caution.\nIt could be as simple as the web site didn’t correctly explain what file type or the name is mangled due to a character encoding issue like someone using an illegal filesystem character on the upload side.\nIt also could be that bits of script or program are hidden inside the file and it’s malware / adware or some sort of key logger or installer to then make other changes to your Mac.\nThere are many examples of bad files being passed off a photos / word docs / mp3 / pirated movies. Here’s one very technical write up of some “advertising” software that truly takes over your computer as the root user and listens for commands from the internet to install more things any time the advertiser sells access to [your|our] computers in the future if their installer ever runs on your Mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.cybereason.com/blog/targetingedge-mac-os-x-pirrit-malware-adware-still-active\n", "Q: How to get OSX to pick the strongest wifi signal with identical SSIDs? I have a Netgear wireless router in one room, and a TP-Link powerline adaptor with wifi in another room. I'm using a 2014 MacBook Pro with Yosemite 10.10.1\nPreviously I had separate SSIDs for each of the wireless access points, which meant that I needed to manually change the wifi network when moving around the house.\nThe advice at How can I get the same SSID for multiple access points? is to set the same SSID on both wifi APs, and the laptop should automatically pick the one with the strongest signal:\n\nGive both APs the same SSID, security type and wireless security\n  passphrase... A client will scan all channels looking for APs publishing the SSID it wants, and will pick whichever one suits its needs best (usually that means whichever one shows the highest signal strength).\n\nSo I set identical SSID, security and password on both wifi APs. Unfortunately, OSX Mavericks isn't automatically switching between the networks when moving around the house.\nWhile located near the TP-Link powerline adaptor, I connect to the network, as shown by the bolded first line in the Wifi Explorer window (this is the expected behaviour as that is the strongest network):\n\nBut when moving closer to the Netgear wifi router, Yosemite doesn't disconnect from the TP-Link access point and connect to the Netgear access point (even though that network is much stronger):\n\n(I left the laptop on overnight and it hadn't changed after 12 hours, so it's not related to timing)\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there anything I need to do in Mavericks to select the strongest network automatically?\n\n*Do I need to ensure that all properties are identical between the access points? eg Channel, Width and Mode are different - does that matter?\n\n\nEdit: as per an answer at https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/144832/84752 I changed:\nsudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport prefs joinMode=Strongest\n\nbut this has no effect when moving between rooms. I'm not sure whether that suggestion only applies to Airport products (given the name of the command).\n\nA: I've been trying to figure out the pattern here as well. I found this doc by Apple to be very helpful:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206207\nIt explains pretty plainly:\n\nmacOS clients monitor and maintain the current BSSID’s connection\nuntil the RSSI crosses the -75 dBm threshold. After RSSI crosses that\nthreshold, macOS scans for roam candidate BSSIDs for the current ESSID.\n\nAnd regarding selection criteria:\n\nmacOS always defaults to the 5 GHz band over the 2.4 GHz band.\nThis happens as long as the RSSI for a 5 GHz network is -68 dBm or better.\nIf multiple 5 GHz SSIDs meet this level,\nmacOS chooses a network based on these criteria:\n\n*\n\n*802.11ax is preferred over 802.11ac.\n\n*802.11ac is preferred over 802.11n or 802.11a.\n\n*802.11n is preferred over 802.11a.\n\n*80 MHz channel width is preferred over 40 MHz or 20 MHz.\n\n*40 MHz channel width is preferred over 20 MHz.\n\n\nIn my case, it turned out to be because one WAP only supported 802.11ac, even though all other settings were the same as the WAP supporting 802.11ax.\n\nA: I know this thread is old, but I'd like to leave here what solved the problem for me. You need to check if you have the same security in both access points. For example, I had one access point secured with WPA/WPA2 and another with WPA2 only. After changing both to the same, everything was fine.\nTo check your access points' security, you can do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*While holding the option (alt) key, click the WiFi icon in the menu\nbar\n\n*Click \"Open Wireless Diagnostics…\"\n\n*Go to \"Window\" > \"Scan\" (or press CMD-4)\n\n*Check if the security is the same for both your access points\n\n\nSolution source: http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/wifi-roaming-issues-two-aps-with-same-ssid.1208584/\n\nA: fixed it by making the security identical\n\nA: Your issue is being caused by OS X's handling of a wi-fi parameter commonly referred to as roaming threshold. This parameter dictates the point at which an OS will switch to a stronger signal. Windows gives easy access to this parameter, example here, but no simple option exists in OS X.\nThis document from NYU suggests OS X has \"aggressive\" roaming characteristics and shows the command line to disable aggressive roaming. However, our experience on campus with OS X clients shows OS X to be anything but aggressive, insead preferring to \"stick\" to an AP it has associated with in spite of being in range of closer/stronger signals - like your situation.\nSo, there you go, there's not a lot you can do to alter OS X's roaming behaviour. What you can do though is alter your wireless environment in an attempt to force OS X to switch between APs. Options that you may have, depending on your wi-fi hardware, include setting your APs to strict 5GHz-only mode (if they are dual-band devices) - this will reduce the transmission range and therefore reduce overlap between APs. You may also have a setting on your APs for wireless transmission signal strength - this is another method for reducing overlap between APs, potentially forcing OS X to switch to a stronger signal sooner. Finally, you could try moving your APs to the extremities of your house, again to reduce their overlap.\n\nA: For everyone else stumbling on this problem: try giving your APs different channels!\n\nA: As seen in the screen captures, the BSSID is different because the WiFi settings are different.  Make all the settings identical on each AP as far as security settings etc and it should work.\n", "Q: Remove OTA installed iOS 8 and reinstall on itunes hey guys i have the iOS 8.1 update on my iPhone 5s. I have downloaded iOS 8 over-the-air and it takes up too much storage space. So I was wondering if it is possible to delete that update to go back to iOS 7 and re-download iOS 8 on itunes so it can take up less space.....\n\nA: There is no difference in space required after the upgrade whether you upgrade iOS over the air or via iTunes. The only known problem is that you need more free space on your iOS device before/during the upgrade if you do it over the air. But as you already seem to have downloaded the upgrade to your phone this doesn't seem to be an issue for you, so just apply the upgrade on the phone and you are done.\n", "Q: Hi we have a iPad Need to reset We have forgotten pass codes to iCloud and need to update ect....

I have backed up everything to my external hard drive though and currently my storage in the macbook is showing 29.01gb BACKUP, I was thinking if by switching the Time Machine could it allow more space on my disk?\n\nA: These are local snapshots. They should be on your external hard drive if it has been connected.

It is my guess that Apple updated some of the code in the O/S that checks for issues with RAM and it noticed a problem.\nThat it now works with the RAM effectively swapped is even more puzzling. It is possible that there is an issue with something in the RAM slot itself, either physical or \"electro-mechanical.\"\nIf the RAM is within warranty I would contact the folks you bought it from and swap it out on the chance that there is a strange issue with the RAM itself.\nSorry, no real definitive answer.

It's highly unlikely it's your SATA controller - if your MacBook can read DVDs or CDs then it's definitely not your controller as it's the same one that the HDD/SSD will be connected to (Intel Series 7 Platform Controller Hub).\nAs for why these cables fail I've yet to get to the bottom of the issue, but the ones I've replaced have no visible mechanical damage whatsoever, and replacing them has restored full SATA functionality.\nThe question/answer I linked to has some information that may make your cable change slightly easier.\n", "Q: How to bring to front or order layers in Preview?

A friend of mine found an iPhone 6 in a festival but she didn't have a way to charge the phone for a couple weeks. She is a maid here in Brazil and didn't have the proper charger neither knew how to use the phone. When she finally gave the phone to me to charge and try to find the owner, I've found out that the phone had an iCloud activation lock. \nWe took the phone to the carrier but they said that the sim card was deactivated already and belongs to a corporate account with more than 100 numbers associated. \nIs there a way for me to contact the owner via Find My iPhone or iCloud? If I wipe the phone, start over and try to activate will that notify the owner via Find My iPhone? If that happens maybe I could just put another valid sim card and wait for the person to text me via iCloud and I can text him back to see how I can return.\nI don't want to take it to the police because I'm pretty sure they will just sell the parts (the Brazilian police are super corrupt) and I really want to return this phone because I lost mine already in the past and I was very glad that the person who found returned it to me.\n\nA: If the SIM card is deactivated, replace the SIM card with one that is functional and will provide the device with a data connection. This will allow the phone to communicate its location to Find My iPhone which the original owner can use to locate the device.\nYou can't restore a device with an active Activation Lock (except DFU and that just puts it back in Activation Lock), so “wiping the phone” isn't a possible avenue.\n\nA: Little know fact is that Apple has a program to return lost devices to the original owner.  Bring it to the Apple Store, you get a receipt and Apple should take care of it.\nAlternatively if the store is too far away, you can call Apple Support and they'll send a courier over to pick it up on their expense (or give you a shipping tag).

My voice memos range from < 1 minute to a max of ~10 minutes.\nI tried using Dragon Dictate 4 for Mac and found this application a nightmare to use and very unreliable. I would be happy to purchase a slimed down version of this application that only transcribed audio files but I can't find such a product on the Nuance website. Unfortunately I could not get this application to work reliably enough to look for an API or scripting interface ... and I'm a little skittish about this vendor after reading about similar experiences from other users.\nI've also looked at cloud services as well, but the ones I've found seem to be rather expensive - $0.20/minute and with limitations on the max audio file size that can be uploaded.\n\nA: I doubt you can find command line commercial application.\nYou can better use some open source library like pocketsphinx http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net\nTo transcribe a file you can use latest version 5prealpha:\n   ffmpeg -i file.mp3 -ar 16000 -ac 1 file.wav\n   pocketsphinx_continuous -infile file.wav -logfn /dev/null\n\nthat should give you an automated transcription.

In short, I'm getting a ton of errors in my system.log along the lines of:\nCloudKeychainProxy[307]:  __39-[UbiqitousKVSProxy doSyncWithAllPeers]_block_invoke_2 <UBK-s-pC---> syncWithAllPeers (null), rescheduling timer\n\nThis happens once every 5 seconds - kind of silly, right?\nThe first thing I wanted to do was to sign out of iCloud because something has obviously gone wrong there. I open the system preferences, navigate to iCloud and try to hit Sign Out. One by one the iCloud services are all disabled, each asks me if I want to keep a copy of the data locally. This process finishes, and then I get an error stating:\nYour iCloud account couldn't be removed at this time.\nTurn off all iCloud services and try again.\nThe one holdout in the iCloud preferences pane is Keychain. When I uncheck the box, it immediately re-checks itself, the moment I answer the keep or delete data question (and regardless of the answer selected).\nA look in system.log via Console shows this error appearing the moment the box is rechecked:\ncom.apple.preferences.icloud.remoteservice[645]: [AOSAccounts] : [SetEnabled] : Did not call SSRemoveSyncedKeychainData as we had an error in SOSCCRemoveThisDeviceFromCircle for account myaccount@site.com  error: (null)\n\n(actual email address replaced with \"myaccount@site.com\")\nSo. I can't sign out of iCloud since I can't disable iCloud Keychain. WTF?\nIdeas that did not work\n\n\n*\n\n*Repairing permissions, both in Disk Utility, and my home directory permissions from the Cmd-R-on-boot Recovery system. No effect.\n\n*Checking for disk errors - there are none.\n\n*Booting in safe mode - No effect.\n\n*Clearing every cache possible (via OnyX), including LaunchServices, dyld, XPC, kernel, boot, and system components. - No effect.\n\n*Changing my password on iCloud.com - this results in a prompt for a password which is never accepted, and attempting to cancel out of it results in System Preferences crashing!! After reloading it, it appears that my modified password was accepted, but no other changes have been made. No effect on the problem.\n\n*Removing all third party kexts (anything that shows in a kextstat | grep -v apple). Only stuff I had in there was Virtualbox and Little Snitch, both of which were uninstalled totally. No effect.\n\n*Signing out of all other iCloud devices, including another Mac, an iPhone, and an iPad. No effect.\nIdeas that are not acceptable\n\n\n*\n\n*Creating a new user account. This is a workaround, and does not fix whatever's been broken. The same problem could happen again, and just abandoning my account anytime it does really isn't a tenable solution.\n\n\nOther notes\niCloud appears to work fine except for the keychain bits. New passwords saved in Safari do not synchronize across devices. Mail, notes, calendar, etc, work fine.\nApple Support was useless on this matter, suggesting everything I tried above, with the only other option being a full iCloud reset, which is both the nuclear option (all my synced data goes away), and may not fix the problem on the mac anyways.\n\nA: Signing in in my iPhone and enable iCloud Keychain did the trick to me. So I restored the keychain in my iPhone and then the keychain switch in my Mac changed to  off state as magic\n\nA: I have a separate personal + apps-only (was before family sharing came along) Apple IDs. I signed in to iCloud on my MBPr using my apps-only Apple ID so I can setup family sharing. I can't seemed to do this via web.\nWhen it was time to sign out of the apps-only Apple ID, I encountered the same problem but the posted solutions doesn't work for me since I never signed in to iCloud on my other iDevices with the apps-only Apple ID. I've always used my personal Apple ID. the apps-only Apple ID is signed in though on iTunes but I don't think that's related.\nAnyway, the solution for me was to delete ~/Library/Application Support/iCloud folder and ~/Library/Preferences/Mobile*.plist file. Restart OS X and sign in again! :)\n\nA: Disabling iCloud keychain in on all devices did the trick for me. I had an old iPad who still was enabled. Now I can disable the Keychain.\n\nA: Try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable keychain on all of your devices.\n\n*Sign out of iCloud on your Mac.\n\n", "Q: Wrong working directory, if bash script is opened via double-click I wrote a bash script in order to directly start eclipse from different workplace locations.

But when I double-click it, it uses the home directory as working directory and thus starts eclipse not from the directory that contains the script.\nApparently scripts are executed from ~/., which is the cause for my trouble. What can I do to fix this? Or how can I change my script to get the desired behavior?\n\nA: If your script is stored at ~/workspaces/myproject/launch.sh and you want to be in that directory when you run, change to that directory, you can get the directory where the script is saved with this one liner:\nDIR=$( cd \"$( dirname \"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\" )\" && pwd )\n\nSo the first few lines of your script become:\n#!/bin/bash\nDIR=$( cd \"$( dirname \"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\" )\" && pwd )\ncd \"${DIR}\"\n...the rest of your script...\n\nThis will put you in the directory where the script is stored no matter how your run the script.\nIf you want to learn more about detecting the location on disk of a script at execute time see this excellent StackOverflow answer.\n", "Q: Safely alter the plist on Calendar.app I want to add <key>LSUIElement</key> <true/> to the plist of Calendar.app like I would other apps because I don't want it in the dock or my task bar.

You'd have to jailbreak your phone, at which point support for applications would not be covered. All app store applications run in protected sandbox mode purposefully to limit this type of interaction with the device.\n(edit to clarify that the phone does have bash but not accessible to the everyman)\n", "Q: iPhone 4s, version 5.1.1 upgrade to 8.1.2 I downloaded the Iphone4,1_8.1.2_12b440_restore.ipsw on my laptop and I pressed shift plus update it started extracting and said unknown error3194 finally after finishing.

I had an empty external drive already hooked up so I went ahead and installed Yosemite on it and copied up my latest Time Machine backup onto it. Starts up fine but I need to get my SSD back online. After researching I figured out that Trim Enabler and Yosemite were now bitter enemies.\nI am just trying to figure out now how to \"disable\" Trim Enabler from the SSD. Since I can't access the drive through Disc Utilities I'm not sure how to go about doing this. Do I have to take the drive out and hook it up as an external to disable Trim Enabler?

Deleting from the Finder and deleting from the Terminal prompt are vastly different things that each may use different permissions (ACLs versus Unix-like permissions).\nRight-click the file in the Finder, and select Get Info. Then, click the triangle next to the Sharing & Permissions panel. Make sure you have the permissions you need there (i.e., \"Me\" has Read & Write).\n\nA: have you tried just dragging it to the trash can in the dock? I don't think that dragging it to the trash will work any better than the other methods you were having trouble with, but what it may do is give you an error dialog that can help you. If it does let you move it to the trash, make sure it lets you empty the trash before you think you have solved the problem.\nBy the way, there won't be a delete button in the right-click box. Macs use \"Move to Trash\", not delete. Does the move to trash option show up? \n\nA: I had the same problem. Restarting the Finder didn't fix it, but restarting the Mac did it for me.\n\nA: It may be an ACL issue. If you try to rm the file in terminal and note the error message that would give you a better indication. Furthermore, if you sudo rm to act as root and it works, you will have at least identified it as a permissions issue not something like a file lock.\n", "Q: I have two Macs on the same Apple ID. Sharing issue When I access the internet on Mac 1, the other Mac (Mac 2) has a extra icon pop up and can see what I access. Both Macs use the same Apple ID and are on the same domain.

That person could click the icon and see what I am seeing.\nHow do I stop this?\n\nA: This is called hand off\nIt allows you to continue where you left off in an app on one Device when you are accessing another device.\nIt works via the AppleID not the local user.\n\nWhen your Mac computers and iOS devices are within Bluetooth range of\n  each other (about 33 feet or 10 meters), they can automatically “hand\n  off” what you’re doing from one device to another. For example, you\n  can start writing an email in Mail on your iPhone, then instantly pick\n  up where you left off in Mail on your Mac.\nHandoff app icon in Dock Handoff works with several apps that come\n  with OS X Yosemite and iOS 8: Calendar, Contacts, Mail, Maps,\n  Messages, Notes, Phone (iOS only), Reminders, and Safari.

Is there any way to find what apps are downloading stuff in the background? And what stuff they are downloading? I've done a little research and gather it's the Background Transfer Service doing the work. But no hint of how to monitor what its doing. This other question is a bit more general and the answer was \"there's no way to know\" but it's a bit old and the answers aren't authoritative.\nAbout once a week when I plug my phone in and it's on WiFi I find it's suddenly downloading hundreds of megabytes of data. I can figure out a bit of what's going on from my router, an HTTP connection to aaplimg.com, but all that tells me is it's something on Apple's CDN. Short of running a packet sniffer I have no way to see what is being downloaded or by what.\n\nA: Do you have iCloud Drive and/or iCloud backups enabled? If so, that's what it's probably doing. You may also want to check which apps you have enabled to refresh in the background. See: Settings > General > Background App Refresh\n\nA: \nAbout once a week when I plug my phone in and it's on WiFi I find it's suddenly downloading hundreds of megabytes of data.\n\nThat sounds to me like it's just doing an iCloud backup, since those are the conditions under which a backup will run.\nIf you go to Settings > iCloud > Backup, check if iCloud Backup is enabled. If so, see if the date and time of the last backup correlates with when you last noticed that data usage. Or trigger a backup manually and see if it makes the same connections that you saw previously.\n\nAlso, go to Settings > Safari and see if Fraudulent Website Warning is enabled. I believe iOS periodically downloads updates to the list of fraudulent sites when plugged in and on wifi (although I can't currently find any documentation on this).\n\nA: Have you checked the app data usage under Mobile Data?  That would indicate what apps are using the most data on your cellular connection.  By process of elimination, you can uninstall the apps that use the most data on mobile and see if that affects the data use on Wi-Fi.  It's a tedious, annoying solution, but it's the best method I can think of.\nDo you have your iPhone set to sync data to iCloud over Wi-Fi?  That might be a factor too…\n", "Q: iPhone 5 my iMessage doesn't work I do not have a SIM card in my phone. Before my iMessage used to work even without a SIM card.

I just limited all my SSL ciphers to TLS 1.X and TLS1_RSA_AES and my up-to-date OSX machine is no longer able to connect to the server via Outlook 2011.  \nI can use Safari to connect to the same host, so this is probably an app-specific issue.\nHow do I, in OSX, figure out what TLS cipher and protocol is being used to connect to a given host?\nThis is necessary to remove security risks with SSL3, BEAST, CRIME, POODLE, and other security risks.  \nIdeally I will remove all ciphers locally that use RC4 and other risky protocol negotiations. \n\nA: As you already remarked, the use of ciphers and protocol version is application specific. The easiest way to check which ciphers and protocol version is currently used by an application is to either use wireshark to sniff and look at the TLS handshake (ClientHello contains the cipher offers) or to use some server which displays these information from the SSL handshake, like SSLLabs.\n", "Q: My MacBook Pro will boot up but won't login My 2013 MacBook Pro will turn on fine and go to the user profile page.

This is because Mac O/S does a bunch of maintenance routines during safe mode, including disk and filesystem repair, so give it time.\nOnce you are at the login screen I would bet that you can now log in. Now back up your important stuff just in case and try turning off items that run at startup.\n", "Q: Will AirDrop use the data allowance from my phone and wifi modem? I'm successfully able to transfer files from my iPhone to my MacBook Pro using AirDrop, when connected to my home wifi network. But I'm unable to determine how AirDrop is creating the connection between the phone and laptop.\nThis page says:\n\nAirDrop uses Apple's Bonjour technology to listen in on a wireless\n  connection for another Mac to announce AirDrop capabilities\n\nand this page says:\n\nAirDrop uses Bluetooth to create a peer-to-peer Wi-Fi network between\n  the devices.\n\nWhen my laptop is connected to a wifi modem, and my phone is using 4G data, will AirDrop use the wifi and 4G connections, eroding my data allowances on both devices? Or are the phone and laptop directly connected to each other (\"peer to peer wireless network\"), and therefore not eating up my data allowances? \n\nA: With airdrop it is always a direct connection (usually wifi or a mix of wifi + bluetooth) between the 2 devices. No internet connection is required at all. So you can transfer as much as you like and it will all be local between the devices; \"peer to peer\" like you say. Your internet quota won't be used at all.\n\nA: Both my iPhone and iPad have wifi + cellular. I transferred photos between them with airdrop. Vodafone charged money.\n", "Q: How to download files from MediaFire directly on iPad?

Unbound supports DNSSEC.   Next, you need whatever apps you want to use, to be aware of and respect the results of the DNSSEC validation that unbound does.  As an example, SSH can use DNSSEC along with SSHFP to validate the fingerprint of the server that you are connecting to.\nHere is a blog post that details how to install unbound. https://spatof.org/blog/2013/8/unbound-on-osx/\nAs to having IPSec using DANE, I believe that is still something that it being worked out.\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-osterweil-dane-ipsec-02\n", "Q: Strange noise when holding MacBook Pro I recently bought a MacBook Pro Retina and for now I'm a little bit worried.

Although these methods may not achieve exactly what you need but they may help to avoid unwanted or accidental interaction with the external drive.\nOne caveat that I have found with chflags is that you don't seem to have Finder access to the disk unless you unhide it. It does support having an iPhoto Library on the external disk. I tried this by making an test iPhoto library on a disk without chflags hidden and then hiding it with chflags nohidden. iPhoto can access the disk but it does not show up anywhere besides the apps such as Disk Utility.\nTo see the chflags options do:\nman chflags in the Terminal.app\nHere are two articles relating to fstab and chflags that you might find interesting and possibly help you achieve what you have described:\nhttp://www.macissues.com/2014/08/27/how-to-hide-a-hard-drive-partition-on-your-mac/\nhttp://julipedia.meroh.net/2007/01/hide-volume-in-mac-os-x.html\nAs far as accidentally un-mounting goes I guess if you have something open on that drive the system will automatically protect it. You might be able to use a LaunchDaemon of some sort to detect requests to unmount a drive also. On the other hand, there is no protection against physically pulling out the cable.\nI hope these help.\n", "Q: Excel always opens spreadsheet in read-only mode I understand this issue arose over the past 2-3 years, but I haven't seen any solution.\nA workbook created on a Windows PC using Office 365 - transferred to Mac (Yosemite installed) - opens in read-only mode in Office 365 for Mac.\nThe workbook doesn't have a \"/\" in its name. I made sure there is read/write access for the file and also the folder. It contains macros, some of which work, others will have to be redone.  \nAfter saving it with a different name, I may work as usual with it like updating, saving and closing it.\nAfter reopening it, it's again in read-only mode. \nAfter all this time there must be a solution for the problem.\n\nA: You actually may have a hidden lock file in the same directory as the main file is stored (usually happens to me when I use an USB stick to copy Microsoft files from somebody else). To resolve\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*cd to the directory containing the file\n\n*ls -al FIRST-CHARACTERS-OF-NAME*\nIf there is a small file with the same name as the file which only opens read-only but a different suffix -> rm THAT-FILE.\n\nA: I had the same problem. I could see the attributes set as Read-Only under the preferences but couldn't change them. I completely closed out of excel on my mac and changed the name of the excel file. That seemed to have changed the Read-Only status of my file when I opened it next. Hope this helps.\n\nA: This just happened to me; opening Excel files found via Finder was causing them to open in read-only mode. This really puzzled me, until I checked the file path - Finder had somehow decided to open the file from a Time Machine backup rather than where the actual current version of the file is located.\ntldr; Check the file path of your Excel file is opening from where you expect it! (and not from a Time Machine backup, for example)\n", "Q: Installed App with Brew Cask Over Existing Install, Did it Remove the Old App Files? I upgraded to the latest OpenOffice (from 3.4.1 to 4.1.1) with brew-cask without realizing OpenOffice 4 was already installed:\n$ brew cask install openoffice\n==> Downloading http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/openofficeorg.mirror/Apache_OpenOffice_4.1.1_MacOS_x86-64_install_en-US.dmg\n######################################################################## 100.0%\n==> Symlinking App 'OpenOffice.app' to '/Users/shwaydogg/Applications/OpenOffice.app'\n  openoffice staged at '/opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/openoffice/4.1.1' (3180 files, 385M)\n\nI'm worried that the old install with ~400MB is still there just not linked.  Or does brew-cask writing the the symlink over the old app effectively delete the files?  / Perhaps BrewCask was smart enough to take this into account?\nHow could I check?\n\nupdate:  did as @njbook suggested in comments:\n$ brew-cask cleanup\n==> Removing dead symlinks\nNothing to do\n==> Removing cached downloads\n/Library/Caches/Homebrew/openoffice-4.1.1.dmg\n/Library/Caches/Homebrew/Casks/openoffice-4.1.1.dmg\n\nThere's no mention of the an old install being removed.\nAnother way to phrase my question perhaps more directly is in a unix system if a directory is replaced with a symlink pointing elsewhere are the files within the directory still taking up space on disk and if so how can they be found?\n\nA: Cask does not clean up old versions by default. It stages the installs in /opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/$APPNAME and then symlinks them in to ~/Applications or /Applications depending on the brew recipe. And then it leaves the old versions around until you run brew cleanup.\nYou can see old installs of OpenOffice under /opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/openoffice. You can safely delete the old installs from there, though brew cleanup is supposed to do this for you.\nIf you had previously installed OpenOffice using their DMG installer and not Homebrew Cask, it was most likely installed in /Applications and not ~/Applications. Cask won't install over top of an existing installation that wasn't previously Cask-installed itself. So check /Applications and make sure you remove the old version from there if hadn't installed it via Cask. If you had installed it via Cask all you need to do is delete it from /opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/openoffice as mentioned above.\n", "Q: kernel_task hundreds of % CPU yet cpu frequency is being lowered I'm trying to solve the mystery of a crazy high cpu usage on kernel_task.\nMacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012), 2.7 GHz Intel Core i7, Yosemite 10.10.2\nI saw some advice to download the Intel Power Gadget. That showed me that the my CPU is slowing way down. How do I fix this? When this happens, I can sometimes cycle the power on the MBP. But this is driving me crazy.\n\n\n\nA: In my case, I had a MBP used continuously for 3 years. The local Mac store opened the case and cleared out the dust. That FIXED the problem!!!!\nBasically the extra dust caused the CPU to overheat.\n\nA: Apple documents this.\n\nActivity Monitor may show that a process named kernel_task is using a large percentage of your CPU, and during this time you may notice a lot of fan activity. This process helps manage temperature by making the CPU less available to processes that are using the CPU intensely. In other words, kernel_task responds to conditions that cause your CPU to become too hot. When the temperature decreases, kernel_task automatically reduces its activity. \n\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203184\nYou might want to reset the SMC one time to be sure it's not stuck and providing incorrect temperature readings to the processor.\nIf the SMC or high temperatures is the root cause, you should be able to correlate the various internal temperature sensors and physical measurement of the case and exhaust air temperature with the design throttling of the kernel scheduling and the clock rate adjustments the chipset is designed to make in response to thermal measurements.\nWorst case, you have a hardware issue with faulty temperature sensors or an out-of-spec CPU that generates more heat than it should for a given GHz clock rate.\n\nA: My current MB Pro Retina(late 2013) suffers from this. I installed Ubuntu on my laptop just so that I can barely run the browser and terminal.\nThe reason behind my laptops throttling seems to be faulty temperature sensors. Some of the sensors are reporting a reading of -127C which starts the throttling. I have compiled temperature readings from sensors in this github gist.\nSo far, there's no solution in sight. I have tried cleaning, modifying kernel extensions and resetting SMC.\n\n", "Q: App Store asks for old Apple ID when installing updates I got a MacBook that a colleague of mine had used previously. It runs OS X 10.10.2. I created a new administrator account for myself and turned off the \"admin\" flag on the old account.\nI also entered my iCloud / Apple ID account, so that it syncs my calendars and contacts correctly, and even in the App Store, I am signed in with my correct account.\nBut when I try to install pending software updates (that is, OS X system updates!), the window that pops up has the the e-mail address of my colleague filled in and greyed out—and I can't change it. \n\nNote that I'm signed in with a different (correct) account in the App Store. When I go to Featured and click Account on the right, it has my correct e-mail address filled in:\n\nHow do I make the App Store \"forget\" the old Apple ID?\nI found a thread where it just says \"it's not possible\", and that apps are glued to the original account the Mac was set up with, but that doesn't make a lot of sense, especially in a company where laptops may be handed over from one person to another.\n\nA: It won't 'forget' the old ID as each download from the Mac App Store embeds the purchasing account. Those previous apps were purchased/downloaded for free on that ID & are only licensed to that ID.\nThe only way round is to either use that ID for those apps, delete and redownload each affected app one by one or to wipe the machine & start over being careful to not copy back apps from backup copies and only to use the new account in the store. \nFor corporate use, it would be far better to not purchase through the App Store, but to buy multi-seat licenses directly from the app creators. \n\nA: To delete the application from the Launchpad. Hold down the icon until they all jiggle and the (x) appears. Click that on the app you want to delete, then confirm.\nIf you do this while the App Store's Updates page is displaying the application, you can then just update!\nIf not, you will have to download it again. This might mean paying for it again. But if it's family plan eligible, it will show as needing to buy it and you'll have to confirm payment, but then it will inform you that it's family plan eligible and you'll get to download it again for free.\nIf going through this leaves the app missing from the Launchpad (it did for me one time), then drag the app to the trash (confirming with your password if necessary), wait 10 seconds, and drag it back (possibly confirming again). That should alert Launchpad to its presence.\nI hope this helps people in the future. I wasted a lot of time figuring this out, and couldn't find a clue on the web.\n\nA: That OS X asks for the old apple id is probably because you didn't do a clean install. \nYou could make a backup of all your data with time machine and start your mac in recovery mode (press cmd+r) on startup. Here you can erease the hard drive and install os x again.\n\nA: my computer prompted me to update iphoto, but had my daughter's email/apple id and i couldn't change it. That version wasn't compatible with my 2016 MacBook pro 13, so i deleted it (the icon had a no smoking circle/slash over it). after that the App Store stopped prompting me to update the program. \n", "Q: iPhone 5 moving of contacts I do not know what account my contacts were earlier synced to.

I am using an iPhone 5 with the iOS 6.1.4 and usually it will get notifications to update the iOS. What are major differences between these two and WHAT ARE BENEFITS OF RETAINING THE 6.1.4 AND THE BENEFITS OF UPDATING TO 8.2? My dad is using the same phone as me however, he is experiencing battery shutdowns quite often and he using iOS 8.2 I would like to know whether retaining my iOS without updating is good? or is it better for me to update to 8.2? I would like to listen to good experience and knowledge before I proceed further.\n\nA: In short, it is impossible to run most modern applications under iOS 6. So, yes, updating to iOS 8 is long overdue.\n\nA: Neither is better nor worse. Each has their strong-points and uses in the industry.\niOS 6.x, although having less features, requires a less powerful device to run on. iOS 8.x will require a more up to date device to run on.\nMore than often, I see iOS 6 and 7 still used in businesses on internal devices. As a personal device, I'd personally say move to iOS 8.\nIf your device is on iOS6, although many of the \"newer\" applications won't run on it, the App Store is designed in such a way to filter applications that will ONLY run on the platforms that your device supports. ergo, if you're on iOS6.x, the App Store will list iOS6 and lower applications...\n8.x is aimed at eye candy as well as \"handy functionality\", by this I mean you have interesting features such as the \"health kit\" which constantly measures your steps in a day, the height you walked up and down in a day etc... to get a general idea of your health regime.\nSo it's entirely up to you which you'd prefer to stay on. Do note that apple no longer support various devices (they call it EOL - end of life) and with that comes the operating systems they were designed for! So do read into the T's and C's of whichever OS you're going to sit on and make sure that :\n1) Apple will support it\n2) Your Apple Cover Plan will cover it\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: change flag in menu bar to Indian flag For India they have Hindi language but it does not have an Indian flag on it.

Open Activity Monitor, search for \"Dock\" and force quit the process. Some users in a thread in the Apple discussion forum also suggested hiding and un-hiding the Dock (press  Cmd ⌘   Opt ⌥  D twice) might fix it, but I haven't tested that.\n\nA: I had a similar issue when using a second display on El Capitan on a macbook pro.

I am disappointed to learn that the Parallels 10 (and earlier) does not support hardware accelerated 2D (nor 3D) graphics when Mac OS X is the guest OS. \nThis means Yosemite inside Parallels runs noticeably slowly in its screen rendering. Menus are delayed when dropping down. Highlighting menu items cannot keep up with the mouse movement. The Dock magnification appears chunky and delayed as you move the mouse across app icons. Windows in the Finder jump an inch or two at a time while dragging to move them. Generally it feels sluggishly delayed similar to screen-sharing over a very slow DSL internet connection.\nIn contrast, Mountain Lion performs so well in Parallels 9 and 10 that I forget I am using a virtual machine. Really! I set the Dock to the opposite side of the screen to remind myself that I'm using a VM. Apparently the difference is due to a \"software emulation of 2D/3D acceleration officially supported by Apple\" (per the tech note linked above).

This may be a strange question.\nBackground: I usually work in a multiple monitor setup, where I can plaster the screen with all my windows so nothing I might need to switch to is ever hidden from view. \nOn a laptop, that's obviously not possible.\nA while ago I wrote scripts that give me keyboard shortcuts to move windows around into half/quarter/other convenient arrangements for essentially gridding the display. In researching this question I learned that these are essentially duplicated by some open source apps, but I found nothing that solves the greater problem of switching between these windows easily and painlessly.\nIn particular, I use spaces as a substitute for multiple monitors, plastering each one with a grid of windows. But I often find myself frustratedly trying to switch between applications in different spaces with no quick way to do it.\nE.g. cmd-tabbing to the application makes me go linearly through a bunch of open applications and doesn't pick up applications open only in other spaces.\nUsing mission control only shows me the windows open in the present space; I have to switch spaces first to use it to get at another window open in another space.\nI've considered using only one space and switching via mission control, but having only one space can lead to serious window clutter, with windows hiding behind each other and ending up in the \"wrong order\" so when I need to drag things between windows, etc., they're not activated at the right time. (In separate spaces I can leave paired windows side by side with nothing in front of them.)\nI'm wondering whether someone else who has faced these frustrations has come up with a clever solution or workflow. I'd prefer something open source but am willing to learn a new workflow even with a steep learning curve if it means faster performance eventually--where performance is defined, I think, as reliably and quickly switching between many open windows, though I may end up editing this question as answers reveal that I'm actually looking for something more detailed. E.g. if a multiple-window-using guru of window-management best-practices can explain something like \"I faced this problem, and I realized after many years that the right way to do it is work in a single monitor, and always follow steps A B C, and use tool D\" then I am all ears.\n\nA: The info contained in this answer, though some prefs have changed appearance, should be good for any macOS from Lion to Monterey.\nI'm a Spaces user of long-time habit, even though I've always had 2 screens.\nI find the best way to get around is to pin specific apps to specific Spaces [then remember where they live, which is the only difficult bit]\nIf no apps are yet assigned this way, then switch to the chosen Space before launching the app, then right click the app in the Dock & pin to \"This Desktop\". You can do this without needing to launch first, if it already appears in the Dock, otherwise launch then pin.\n\nMission Control, as you've discovered, is fine for finding where an app is if you forgot, but not great as a quick way of getting there.\nI really tend to use it if I did forget which Space I put an app in, as you can click directly on any of the app's windows in the window 'overview' at the top of the screen & it will switch & bring it to the front…\n\nBut… in my ideal world of remembering where each app is, my method of choice is to use\n Ctrl ⌃   num  to switch directly to my required Space. This is set in System Prefs > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Mission Control [You can only see as many 'Switch' shortcuts as you have Spaces.]\nIt will remember which app you last had frontmost when you switch Spaces in this way.\n\nNote - if you have an extended keyboard with a 10-key, by default the Ctrl/num shortcuts are set to the 'qwerty' numbers, not the 10-key numbers & you will have to change the shortcuts manually if you prefer the 10-key. [Rather irritatingly, you cannot tell just by looking which is assigned to which key type.]\nI specifically never use apps in Full-Screen, as they add themselves to a new, random, unnumbered Space & break that key-switching.\nPro Tips\nIf I ever need, for instance, to add an email attachment from Finder (Space 1) to an email (Space 4) then simply grabbing the header bar of the email & hitting  Ctrl ⌃   1  will move that single email to Space 1, where I can drop in the attachment from Finder.\nIf you ever need an app to 'follow' you around - sometimes I keep Activity Monitor tucked in a convenient corner - then assigning to All Desktops will make it always appear, whichever Space you're in.\nLate addition - Pro tip\nOnce you start using Spaces like this you will absolutely want to prevent Finder from re-numbering them all by itself.\nSystem Prefs > Mission Control\nUncheck 'Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use'.\nThis will fix the order of all your regular Spaces - but not Fullscreen spaces, which always go to the right of existing numbered Spaces.\n\n", "Q: Messages on MacBook Pro not working I can't get Messages to work on my Macbook Pro (retina).

I am attempting to download and install both SciPy and VisualPython so that I can get them to work with each other. I've looked at the release notes for SciPy 0.14.0 and 0.15, and they  appear to be compatible with Visual Python, which requires Python 2.7.9. After downloading this version I checked (using python -V) that my computer uses this version. \nI downloaded Anaconda and Visual Python, but upon running two test files provided by my professor, each returned the following error: \n    $ python elect.py\n/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python: can't open file 'elect.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory\n\nI tried running these programs while in the parent directory, where I got this error: \n    $ python elect.py\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"elect.py\", line 2, in <module>\n    from scipy import *\nImportError: No module named scipy\n\nI have MacPorts and Homebrew installed (though MacPorts is not updating libgcc, but that's another question) if you think those will help. I would have linked to the release notes too, but I haven't got enough reputation. A search for SciPy release notes 0.x should yield the correct site. Thank You!\n\nA: When you install Anaconda, it installs a different version of Python, which has SciPy, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and whole lot of goodness bundled with it. However, those libraries won't automatically become usable by your other Python version that comes pre-installed on your computer (or any other Python version that you installed yourself).\nFrom the command line, try which python - this will tell you which Python you're using on the command line right now. If what is printed has the word 'Anaconda' in it, you are fine, and you should be able to use scipy. If not, then that is not the right Python associated with scipy.\nIn your shell configuration file (typically .bashrc or .bash_profile) Anaconda makes the required change to make sure that you start using the Anaconda version of Python. From your output, it seems that it didn't get your username right. In the path, the username should be your actual username on the computer. Try to make that change, restart your terminal or a shell session, and try again. It might also simply be that you never restarted your terminal.

I open Activity Monitor and the applications are still open using up to 1GB of RAM each.  I have to click on each app and Quit (not Force Quit) them in order for the RAM to open up and be freed up.  Why aren't these apps closing out automatically each time instead of being closed via Activity Monitor?  These two apps take up a lot of RAM on my macbook.\n\nA: Closing the last window of an application doesn't necessarily close the application.\nFor example, opening two TextEdit windows and then closing them both (kbd>Cmd-W or click the red close button top-left of window) will not close TextEdit. This allows one to click File>New (or Cmd-N) to open and work on a new TextEdit document.\nYou may be familiar with how Microsoft Windows manages applications. It actually opens a new instance of Firefox, for example, for each window that you open. On the Mac, that's not necessarily the case.\nPeople who learn to use Microsoft Windows before learning the Mac are often confused at first because the Mac uses a different conceptual model. This is how Macs have always been, more or less. \nMac users get used to typing Cmd-Q if they want to completely quit an application. Often, this is not necessary. But if your machine doesn't have much RAM, you may notice memory hogs like browsers slowing things down.\n\nA: Clicking the close button (the red x in the window's title bar) will usually only close that window not the application. \nUse command-Q to quit the application.\n", "Q: Read files from vintage DOS 3.3 .dsk I have a .dsk file, as used by Apple II emulators.

Sometimes it just won't power on. It works fine. I shutdown, then when I go to turn no it just does nothing. Previously I removed the battery and the charger, pressed the power button for a few seconds (so as capacitors can decharge etc) and then it powered on.

Observe, if your macbook does not turn on on rainy days, especially when you live in tropics where humidity and condensation are extreme, do the following : unscrew the screws, remove the back lid and dry the inside with hairdryer for about a minute. Also you can take your mackbook for a short while to an air conditioned room, which also makes it turn on. Google this topic, there are more reports of this and also solutions available. Crazy, huh ? Of course you should not keep electronics in such humid conditions but realistically, how are you supposed to comply with that in some climates ?

I suspect that I've created it by accident while using terminal.\nI know about using ~ as an alias to quickly get to the current user and I use it extensively, so there is a reasonable chance that I've been wanting to create a new file and possibly been in the process of writing something in the lines of touch ~/new_filebut changed my mind and accidentally pressed enter after touch ~?\nBut that does not explain the fact that the file is 3.1MB?\nFurthermore, the file appears as a file in Finder, but if I try doing either cat ~ or vim ~on it in terminal I'm told that it is actually a directory.

It doesn't have the execute bit set, so can't be executed as a binary file by Terminal. A malicious app probably won't be creating a ~ file in the root of your hard disk.\n\n\n  \n*Can I log what or who wrote the file somehow?\n  \n*Can I figure out what's inside it?\n  \n\nYou won't be able to find out what wrote the file unless it was a process which wrote to the console (/Applications/Utilities/Console.app). You can look for processes which are currently accessing the file with sudo opensnoop -f \"/~\".\nSeeing which processes (if any) are accessing the file may give you an indication as to what is inside the file, or you can open it with a text editor or hex editor and certain phrases might be recognisable to you, which may give you an indication as to \n\n\n  \n*How can I make sure it is safe to delete this file/directory or whatever it is?\n  \n\nIf opensnoop says that nothing's currently accessing it and nothing accesses it whilst you use your computer, then you're not breaking anything by removing it.

I just need to wait for the gray screen where my mac gets stuck, close the lid and wrap my mac with a blanket until it overheats and auto-shutdowns. I immediately then turn-on the overheated mac which will make it boot with the integrated card, and problem solved! After I login I use gfxCardStatus to set the graphics to integrated only. \nThe problem is if I close the lid to sleep my mac at some point, it will never open again unless I redo the entire overheating process. I'm aware Apple recognized the problem recently and is now offering free fixes to it but where I'm living right now there's only Apple recognized providers but no official Apple store. The Apple service provider representative told me that they will have to send my Mac abroad to fix it and that can take over a month which is too long for me... I have a project going on and I have to wrap it up before mid May.\nMy Mac works perfectly with the integrated card, and I'm thinking to keep it awake for about month until I finish my project then schedule a proper repair with AppleCare, which sounds safer than overheating my Mac every time I boot or wake my mac. My question is: is it too bad for my Mac to stay awake for over a month?\n\nA: Won't fix your issue, but, anecdotally…\nMy Mac has been running 24/7 since 2008, never sleeping & only ever rebooting/shutting down for OS updates/hardware clean etc. \nNo issues so far.\nSo I'd say, yes, it's perfectly safe to leave it awake, so long as it has adequate cooling.\n", "Q: What's the difference between \"open with\" and \"recommended apps\"? Some applications show up in the \"Open With...\" menu for a given type. But some applications that don't show up in that list still show up in the Recommended Apps list if you choose \"Other...\" and choose manually.\nWhat is the difference between these two lists, and what would cause an app to appear in one but not the other?\n(Lightroom is one example that doesn't appear in the Open With menu, but does show up in Recommended Apps.)\n\nA: \"Open with...\" menu shows up the \"by default\" App that the extension of the file is associated with on the system, as well as the other Apps that the system is certain that can handle that file extension too. Example: An image .jpg. Can be by default the \"Preview.app\", but will also offer you (in the case you have those Apps) Photoshop, iPhoto, Internet browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc. summarizing: any App that the system knows that can manage .jpg files.\nThe \"Recommended Apps\" list are the Apps of the \"Open with...\" menu + the rest of Apps that for some reason (mostly developers not specifying it) the system is not certain if is able to open it or not, then you can see some Apps \"disabled\" because the system knows that it cannot handle that extension. Example of a disabled App in this list is trying to open a .mp3 with the \"Preview.app\" which is intended to handle image file extensions and not audio file extensions.\nHave in mind that the \"Recommended Apps\" list could offer Apps that are not able to handle the file you're trying to open because the system has no mean (for that App) to know if can or not.\n", "Q: Can I make my website respond to Apple voice dictation for navigation?

I've got two 2009 Macbooks. One has 4 gigs of RAM and runs os 10.10; one has 2 gigs and runs os 10.5.\nI'm considering upgrading the latter machine to Yosemite (10.10), but I'm worried that it will run slowly with so little RAM. In order to get a sense of what the performance would be like, I'm wondering if there's some way I could \"turn off\" half the RAM in the higher spec machine. If I did this, I could get a sense of how Yosemite would run on the 2 gig machine before actually doing the upgrade.\nIs there some way to temporarily disable RAM without physically removing the chip? \n\nA: Yes - use the memory_pressure tool to apply real memory pressure to the system.\nIt's not a perfect analogy to removing the memory chip since the virtual memory tuning still knows there is 4 GB or RAM and the -p percent_free argument won't allocate a constant amount of RAM, but keep the system close to X percent free.\nIt should allow you to very quickly see if your workload is amenable to a system with 2 GB ram even with the imperfect analogy.\nIf you can physically remove the chip - you can first simulate things and get a benchmark and then do the hardware change if you need to verify it's accurate.\n\nA: Adding to OSdweeb's Answer:\nSince El Capitan editing the com.apple.Boot.plist file is only possible when disabling the System Integrity Protocol (SIP) (see this thread).\nYou can, however, set the boot flags with the following command:\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"maxmem=2048\"\n\nA: There's no need to take out RAM, create a RAM disk or use a VM.  Simply boot the OS using the maxmem= boot flag value that's been created for this purpose and been around for decades.\nSimply open Terminal as a sudoer and enter\nsudo nano /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist\n\nAfter entering your password change \n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs$\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n        <key>Kernel Flags</key>\n        <string></string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nto\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs$\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n        <key>Kernel Flags</key>\n        <string>maxmem=2048</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nand write the changes to disk with ctrlo and quit nano with ctrlx\nRestart your Mac to apply the changes.\nTo revert the changes remove 'maxmem=2048' with nano again.\n\nA: Another solution would be to use a virtual machine to simulate the lower-RAM Mac. Install VMWare Fusion, Parallels, or VirtualBox (if you're adventurous) and install OS X in that. Then you can manipulate the number of cores, amount of disk space, and (as you were requesting) amount of RAM available to OS X. VirtualBox is free, but currently limited to 3Gb for OS X until the developers allow 64-bit kernel operations. The other two products have 30-day and 14-day trials, respectively.\n\nA: Just create a RAM Disk with the size 2 GiB to reduce available RAM for the system and running applications. \nTo get the necessary number of blocks to create such a disk, multiply (RAMdiskSize in MB)*2048.\nIn your example that's 2048*2048=4194304. \nThen open Terminal and enter:\ndiskutil erasevolume HFS+ 'RAM Disk' `hdiutil attach -nomount ram://4194304`\n\nYou will get a message similar to that one:\nStarted erase on disk9  \nUnmounting disk  \nErasing  \nInitialized /dev/rdisk9 as a 2 GB HFS Plus volume  \nMounting disk  \nFinished erase on disk9 RAM Disk  \n\nthen use dd and the path to the volume and fill the disk with random data:\ndd if=/dev/random of=/Volumes/RAM\\ Disk/random.dat bs=1024k\n\nThe command will write 1 MiB chunks of random data to the file random.dat in the RAM Disk volume until it's filled to capacity.\nThis should artificially reduce your available RAM by ~2 GiB until you unmount the RAM Disk or restart your Mac.\nAfter some testing this doesn't seem to work as reliably as in older system. The reason is the new memory management in the latest systems (10.9 and up).\nThe memory used by the RAM Disk shouldn't be swapped to disk but depending on the quality of the random data file it might be compressed a little bit. You may increase the RAM Disk size by 5-10% to ~2.1 GB to get a more realistic picture.\n\nIf you want to do this in 10.5-10.8 the following command seems sufficient to get a reliable result (to get the Disk Identifier check the output of the diskutil... command):\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rdisk9 bs=1m\n\n\nA: To TAKE OUT RAM, you can:\nIf your macbook is Aluminium, you take the whole bottom off and the RAM should be right smack in the middle.\nIf it's white, take of the little compartment in the corner and access the ram that way.\nSource: https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT1651\n", "Q: Where are my emails stored and how can I mark them as read from commandline?

Rather than relying on parsing out the raw messages, you can create a rule to filter on the bad status messages and then run an AppleScript, and another on the Ok.\nTo learn about AppleScript and the Mail dictionary: enter Introduction to Scripting Mail\nMail rules are set in Preferences on the Rules tab.\nAppleScripts for mail are installed in $HOME/Library/Application Scripts/com.apple.mail/ Helpfully, when you choose AppleScript from the rules dropdown it'll give you the option to open that folder.\nYou can probably accomplish this with a single script, run when an OK message is received, to check the inbox for bad messages and mark them as read, along with the current message.\nAssuming you mean shell scripting by command line, which is comparable to AppleScript - if anything AppleScript is easier, being designed to be English-like and quite readable.\nTo view the available commands in AS for Mail.app you can open Script Editor (Applications/Utilities), then File->Open Dictionary. Open the Mail dictionary for the command reference guide.\nAlternatively, you can try this the *nix way here, but, on a Mac, the Mac way is often easier.\n", "Q: Do Macs run the full Windows OS making full use of Windows functionality? So I now know that Macs can run Windows, but I just want to confirm if it runs Windows like a normal Windows would run on a PC, with full functionality. In other words, just like you get an HP-Laptop with Windows in it as the operating system, is it the same thing with installing Windows on a Mac? I just want to be sure that they are one and the same, and not just some emulator with restrictions.\n\nA: There are basically two ways you can run Windows on a Mac.\nYou can run Windows in an emulator like VirtualBox, Parallels or VMWare. You get the entire functionality of Windows, but it is running within a VM on another operating system so you don't get the entire performance of the Mac as the resources are shared between Windows and OS X.\nBut you can install Windows directly on a Mac with the help of Boot Camp. When you do this you are running Windows directly on the Mac hardware and get the entire functionality of Windows with all the performance of the hardware as OS X isn't involved.\n\nA: I think what you are asking is:\n\n*\n\n*Can the internal drive be partitioned MBR? There would be no GPT partitions.\n\n\n*Can Windows then be installed using the traditional BIOS boot method. No OS X and therefore no Boot Camp Assistant.\nI have never tried to do this, but I accidentally installed Fedora 21 workstation 32 bit mode this way from a live DVD. The machine was iMac7,1 (iMac 21 inch Mid 2007).\nIf it worked for Fedora, I don't see why it wouldn't work for Windows.\n\nHere Is an Update to my Answer\nI took an old iMac4,1 and booted from a Windows 7 SP1 32bit install DVD. I deleted all partitions and created a single NTFS partition. The install proceeded normally, just like a PC. After installing, I removed the DVD and did a few reboots. Each time, a question mark momentarily appeared in the center of the screen, then the Mac booted to Windows 7. My guess is the firmware was looking for an OS X and when absent, settled for a Windows BIOS boot.\nFor this model, the Boot Camp drivers for Windows Vista are stored on the Apple OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard install DVD. I inserted the DVD and Windows automatically asked to run Setup.exe. I let setup proceed and the Boot Camp drivers installed. Upon successful completion, I was prompt for a reboot. The reboot proceeded with the DVD still in the optical drive.\nThis time the Mac booted to the DVD and starting the OS X install process. I proceeded to answer a few question and eventually reached the point were a could open a Terminal window. I ran the commands distutil list /dev/disk0 and fdisk /dev/disk0. The results confirmed the disk had only a MBR partition scheme with a single NTFS partition on /dev/disk0s1. At this point, it occurred to me to enter the command bless --device /dev/disk0s1 --setBoot --legacy. After doing so, I quit the Terminal application and canceled the OS X install. (Actually, the installer never reached the point where it ask were to install. Therefore, no part of OS X was ever installed.)\nThis reboot resulted in a direct boot to Windows 7. The DVD was ignored and there was no question mark. After removing the DVD, I did a few more reboots. The question mark never appeared. My Mac is a PC.\nI should point out a two things.\nFirst, for most iMacs, the Boot Camps drivers can be directly downloaded from the web.  See the link \"System requirements to install Windows on your Mac via Boot Camp\". One should also make sure their iMac firmware is up to date by visiting the link \"EFI and SMC firmware updates for Intel-based Macs\".\nSecond, there is an alternative to entering the bless command from a OS X Terminal window. Once the Boot Camp drivers are installed, a Boot Camp icon will appear on the Windows Control Panel. (Hint: Open image show below in a new windows for a better view.)\n\nClicking on this icon will open the Boot Camp Control Panel shown below.\n\nClick on the Windows folder icon (labeled here as BOOTCAMP) to highlight it.\n\nClose both windows. (A restart is not required.) You now have blessed the Windows partition and the question mark should not appear on startup.\n\nA: Macs have made some of the best PC's in the last 5 years.\nThe 2015 article by PC Magazine ranks only two computers higher than 4.0 out of 5.0 round dots.\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro\n\n*MacBook Air\n\n\nSee http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2369981,00.asp for the full roundup and reviews. Also, if you drop the one Intel Celeron N2840 powered unit, Apple's laptops have the two longest battery run time of the 10 editors picks when running Windows OS despite being last year's models.\n\nA: Due to low reputation, I cannot comment to David's response. I wanted to add how you \"bless\" a boot partition without using the Terminal.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can either use Boot Camp Control Panel which comes with other software you can prepare by BootCamp Assistant,\n\n*or even simpler - boot with Alt (Option) key pressed, and then, with disks displayed, hold Control key. Icons change to hint that when you click a disk, it will become THE boot disk.\n\n", "Q: iPad is getting calls from my iPhone My iPad keeps ringing when I get a call on my iPhone.  I have disabled FaceTime and Messages, but it still doesn't work.\n\nA: Under Settings > Facetime there's a seperate switch for \"iPhone mobile calls\" (on the iPad). That should be off. If you're still getting the calls try resetting your iPad, make sure you have a backup first.\n\nA: Check if handoff is on that could be why you are receiving calls on your device.\nTo do this,  go to settings > general > handoff and suggested apps\n\n\n*\n\n*the toggle for handoff should be at the top of that page\n\n", "Q: Bootcamp puts content in Macintosh Harddrive I am using Paragon HFS+ for reading my Macintosh hard drive in windows but when I open my Macintosh hard drive I saw lot of window's garbage that I never kept inside of it. Can I delete .exe files and EULA stuff? How to stop windows from keeping it again automatically to Macintosh drive?\n\n\nA: If I remember correctly these files belong to the VisualC++ redistributable. When the installer runs it extracts these files to the root of a drive and then installs to the correct folder. Once the install is complete, these files can just be deleted.\nThis isn't really anything to do with Boot Camp.\n", "Q: How do I uninstall all Apple preinstalled programs from Macbook Pro? I just purchased a Macbook pro and I would like to get rid of all the programs from Apple that came with this computer. I don't need a reason to do this nor will I offer one as it doesn't help reach the ultimate goal of this post.\nHelpful responses include a list of software products Apple put on the Mac, special instructions for each piece of software if needed, caveats for uninstalling a piece of software.\nI am able to delete standard programs by dragging them to the trash. However, many programs say they cannot be deleted because they are required by the OS, such as the Chess game that's included with MacOS.\nThis question could be answered by first giving a general how-to, and then I hope to build upon that answer if there are any exceptions to the general process; as there certainly will be. \nRemember, the ultimate goal is to minimize vestiges of Apple's software short of uninstalling MacOS.\nThanks in advance :)\n\nA: All front end apps which are meant to be accessed directly by the user are located in the Applications Folder. You are free to delete those who can be deleted by trashing and delete supporting files from the Library, there are several 3rd party apps that will help you with that.\nFor any app that leaves you with a warning that it cannot be deleted, that warning is there for a reason. You can use terminal to rm it of course but odd behavior and problems with updating are to be expected.\nAnother location of apps is the /System/ folder which holds tools like the installer-base or an unarchiver. Several system apps rely on each so you will probably face some severe usage troubles if you delete any of these.\nYour question is very unspecific so we can't really know what you'd like to keep and what not and it's therefor impossible to really answer. If you want to go to the very minimum of OS X, well - get BSD or something.\nIf you want to delete all apps and keep your system perfectly usable delete only apps from /Applications/ which OS X permits you to delete.\nAnything beyond will result in a system that is not fully operational.\nAnother thing to be noted is that all these apps that you can delete are not running unless you use them and therefor don't cost you any performance. All you'll gain here is a few MB/GB of disk space, possibly at the cost of a well functioning system.\n\nA: The typically default method where an application specific uninstaller does not exist, one just drags the application bundle to the Trash and then empties the Trash.  Yes, it's typically that simple however there is a nice freeware app called AppCleaner that works nicely.  Note though that by default it will not uninstall default OS X Apps unless you change its Protect default apps preference.\nAs an example if I look at deleting /Applications/GarageBand.app, the application bundle is rather small compared to the support files that would not be deleted had I just dragged it to the Trash.  See image below.\n\n", "Q: File Open/Save dialog boxes hang infinitely Today for the first time I have this issue where any app showing a file browser (load/save) dialog box hangs indefinitely until I kill it.\nThe Finder works just fine however.

I haven't found a common point in the traces where the apps hang, so I'm not sure what might be the cause.\nHere's the relevant sample from TeXShop when I tried to save a document (before that I had to kill VLC twice after accidentally hitting Cmd-O; opening a video in a different way was no problem though.

I wanted to install windows 7 on the hard disk with boot camp with a USB and ISO image.\nAfter searching I found that I need to modify my plist.info to allow my boot camp to create a bootable USB (since normally it doesn't have the option to create the USB for my model since it came with a disk drive). \nAfter doing so and seemingly having a fine (but long) install process onto the USB. I told boot camp how much space to partition windows on and hit install.\nThen the computer restarted. When it came back up it was stuck on a grey apple logo screen forever (I waited 15 minutes to ensure it wasn't just \"thinking\"). I force restarted and the next time it turned on it got stuck on the grey logo for a bit but then proceeded to go to a black screen that said \" No bootable device - please insert a bootable device and hit any key\". I tried hitting keys with he USB in but nothing happened.\nI had to eventually remove the USB and reset PRAM to get it to boot into osx again\nIs there any way to install windows 7 from a usb on my macbook pro using boot camp?\n\nA: UPDATE\nAn improved procedure for installing Windows 7 can be found at Installing Windows 7 Pro 64 bit without DVD or Flash Drive\nNote:\nThe updated steps, for installing Windows 8.1 using the procedure given below, can be found here.\n\nMy hardware and software differs from yours. I will first document how I tested my answer and then try to adapt the answer to your needs. Since this is a fairly long answer, the adaption will be given as a separate answer.\nMy computer is an iMac (20-inch Mid 2007). The version of OS X is 10.10.5. I will be installing Windows 7 Professional SP1 64 Bit.\nI have only one internal drive. It is a 1 TB hard disk using the Apple hybrid GUID partitioning scheme. Hybrid means Windows will see the drive as MBR partitioned, while OS X views the drive as GUID partitioned. I will be following Apple's recommendations and installing Window using the legacy BIOS. I also have a working internal optical SuperDrive which is not used to install Windows.\n(Hint: For a better view, click on an image or open an image in a new window.)\n\n*\n\n*Aquire the Boot Camp Support Software (the drivers). The software\ncan either be downloaded using the Boot Camp Assistant, downloaded\ndirectly from the Web or copied off a OS X installation DVD. See\nSystem requirements to install Windows on your Mac via Boot\nCamp for details. This procedure does not require the use of\na flash drive. If your Boot Camp Support Software is stored on a\nflash drive, then follow the special instructions given in certain\nstep that follow.\n\n\n*Make sure your firmware is up to date. See EFI and SMC firmware\nupdates for Intel-based Macs.\n\n\n*Download and install a free copy of VirtualBox from Oracle. I\nused VirtualBox, Version 5.0.0 r101573, Copyright © 2015.\n\n\n*Inside your \"Documents\" folder, create a folder named \"VirtualBox\".\nThis is where you will keep the files created in the rest of the\nsteps.\n\n\n*Create a MS-DOS (FAT) formatted partition to install Windows. You\ncan use the Bootcamp Assistant, the Disk Utility, or commands\n(distutil, gpt and/or fdisk) entered in a Terminal window.\nOther third party tools, such as gdisk, can also be used.\nGive the label for this partition the name \"BOOTCAMP\".\n\n\n*Determine the disk and partition numbers of the partition named\n\"BOOTCAMP\". To do this, highlight the partition in the Disk Utility\napplication and click the \"Info\" button. A popup window should\nappear. The values shown will be used in the next step.\n\nThe information, in this pop up window, shows the disk and partition\nnumbers are 0 and 4, respectively. If your numbers are different,\nyou will need to substitute your numbers in the rest of the steps.\nIf your partition number is greater than 4, then you can not install Windows on this partition. (Technically, this may not be\ntrue, but it is beyond the scope of this answer to explain how to do\nso.)\n\nDo not close the popup window.\n\n\n*Open the Terminal application and enter the following commands in\nthe Terminal window. This will set variables to be used in later\ncommands. In the next command, replace α with the \"Disk Number\"\nshown in the Disk Utility popup window. The usual value for α is\n0.\nDISK0=/dev/diskα\n\nIn the next command, replace β with the \"Partition Number\" shown\nin the Disk Utility popup window. The usual value for β is 4.\nPARTITION=β\n\nThe next command sets the variable PARTID to the disk identifier of\nthe partition. This should be the same as the \"Disk Identifier\"\nshown in the Disk Utility popup window. The usual value for PARTID\nis disk0s4.\nPARTID=\"$DISK0\"s\"$PARTITION\"\n\nNote: the letter s is lower case.\nClose the Disk Utility popup window.\n\n\n*With the Disk Utility application still open, select \"File→New→Blank\nDisk Image...\" from the menu bar. In the popup window, enter the\nvalues shown below. Note: \"Where:\" should be the \"VirtualBox\" folder\ncreated in Step 4. If the Boot Camp Support Software is stored on a\nflash drive, you can use the default \"Size:\" of \"100 MB\".\nSave As: bcssoftware\nTags:\nWhere: VirtualBox\nName: BCSSOFTWARE\nSize: Custom...

To\ndo this, highlight the partition in the Disk Utility application and\nclick the \"Info\" button. A popup window should appear. The values\nshown will be used in the next step.\n\nThe information, in this pop up window, shows the disk number is 1.\nIf your number is different, you will need to substitute your number\nin the rest of the steps.\n\nDo not close the popup window.\n\n\n*Using the same Terminal window, enter the following to set the\nvariable DISK1. Replace γ with the \"Disk Number\" shown in the\nDisk Utility popup window. The usual value for γ is 1.\nDISK1=/dev/diskγ\n\nQuit the Disk Utility.\n\n\n*Copy the Boot Camp Support Software to to the partition labeled\n\"BCSSOFTWARE\". I used the Finder application to do this. You can\nskip this step, if this software is already stored on a flash\ndrive.\n\n\n*Mark your partition as active in the MBR by entering the following\nin the same Terminal window. The input for the interactive command\nfdisk is taken from the variable INPUT. If a password  is asked\nfor, enter it.\nINPUT=$(printf  \"f  $PARTITION\\nw\\ny\\nq\")\nsudo  fdisk  -e  $DISK0  <<<\"$INPUT\"\n\nNote: To display the value for the variable INPUT, use the\ncommand echo \"$INPUT\".\n\n\n*Allow VirtualBox read/write access to your physical partition by\nentering the following commands in the same Terminal window. If a\npassword is asked for, enter it.\ndiskutil  unmount  $PARTID \nsudo  chmod  go+rw  $PARTID\n\nThis will allow VirtualBox to install Windows on your physical\npartition. Note: This access will only last until OS X is\nrebooted.\n\n\n*Create the files that map the virtual partition and disk to the\nphysical partition and disk image. In the same Terminal window,\nenter the following commands.\ncd  ~/documents/virtualbox\nsudo  vboxmanage  internalcommands  createrawvmdk  -filename  \"$PWD/bootcamp.vmdk\"  -rawdisk  $DISK0  -partitions  $PARTITION\nsudo  chown  $USER  bootcamp*.vmdk\ndiskutil unmountDisk $DISK1\nvboxmanage  internalcommands  createrawvmdk  -filename  \"$PWD/bcssoftware.vmdk\"  -rawdisk  $DISK1\n\n\nNote: If a password is asked for, enter it.\n\n\n\n*Open the VirtualBox application and click on icon above the New\nlabel. Enter or select the values shown below, then click the\n\"Continue\" button.\n\nUse the default settings  except for the hard drive. Choose the\n\"Use an existing virtual hard  drive file\" button. Navigate to the\nVirtualBox folder created in  step 4. Open the \"bootcamp.vmdk\"\nfile. Your window should appear similar to what is shown below.\n\nClick the \"Create\" button.\n\n\n*Enter  the following command in the same Terminal window.\ndiskutil  unmountDisk  $DISK1\n\nReturn to the VirtualBox application's \"Oracle VM Virtual Manager\"\nwindow and click on the  icon above the \"Settings\" label. Next,\nclick on the icon above the \"Storage\" label. Right click on\n\"Controller: SATA\" and select \"Add  Hard Disk\". Choose existing\ndisk by opening the file \"bcssoftware.vmdk\" stored in the folder\ncreated in step 14. The attachment \"bcssoftware.vmdk\" should appear\nas shown below.\n\nIt has been reported by other users that the \"Use Host I/O Cache\" box needs to be checked on if VirtualBox boot fails with error VERR_NOT_SUPPORTED.\n\n\n*Highlight the Empty CD/DVD and select \"Choose a virtual CD/DVD\nfile...\" to attach your Windows installation iso  file. (Hint: Look\nfor the CD/DVD icons)\n\nClick OK to close the  window. Your \"Oracle VM Virtual Manager\"\nwindow should appear similar to what is shown below.\n\n\n\n*Before clicking the icon above the \"Start\" label to begin installing\nWindows, enter the following command in the same Terminal window.\ndiskutil unmountDisk $DISK1\n\n\n\n*When you reach the window shown below, select \"Custom (advanced)\".\n\nIn the next window, click on \"Drive options (advanced)\".\n\nSelect the \"BOOTCAMP\" partition and click on \"Format\". The error\nmessage shown below will disappear. Click on \"Next\" to continue\ninstallation.\n\n\n\n*The rest the virtual machine installation will be repeated again\nafter booting Windows on the physical machine. Use the provided\nanswers when the following windows first appear. When asked a\nsecond time, you can provide your own answers.\nWhen the following window first appears, I would enter the Product\nKey and uncheck the \"Automatically active Windows when I'm online\"\nbox.\n\nTo be safe, I would not let any updates download or install until\nafter the Boot Camp Support Software (the drivers) is installed.\nTherefore, I would click on \"Ask me later\" in the window shown\nbelow.\n\nVirtualBox creates a virtual Public network for your virtual\nmachine. Therefore I would click on \"Public network\" in the window\nshown below.\n\n\n\n*Once the installation has completed on the virtual machine, you\nneed complete the following instructions to make a copy the MBR\nbootstrap code. From the Start Menu, select \"Computer\" to open a\nwindow containing the hard disk drives and devices with removable\nstorage. Determine the drive letters for  the hard disk drive\nlabeled \"BCSSOFTWARE\" and the CD (optical)   drive. The image below\nshows the drive letters on my computer are  D: and G:,\nrespectively. Your drive letters may differ from mine.\n\nClose the window and open a Command  Prompt window run as an\nadministrator. Select \"Start Menu→All  Programs→Accessories\",\nthen right click on \"Command Prompt\" and  select \"Run as\nadministrator\", as shown in the image below.\n\nIn the Command Prompt  window, enter the command shown below. If\nnecessary, substitute your drive letters for G: and D:.\nG:\\BOOT\\BOOTSECT  /NT60  D:  /MBR\n\nThe results of running this command on my computer are shown below.\n\nClose the Command Prompt window.\n\n\n*Copy the Boot Camp Support Software from the partition labeled\n\"BCSSOFTWARE\" to the \"C:\\Users\\Public\\Public Documents\" folder. I\nused the Windows  Explorer to do this. You can skip this step, if\nthis software is already stored on a flash drive.\n\n\n*You need to prepare Windows to run on your physical Mac. Open the\nWindows  Explorer and navigate to the \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\sysprep\"\nfolder. Open the \"sysprep\" application. Select \"Enter System\nOut-of-Box Experience (OOBE)\", \"Generalize\" and \"Shutdown\" as shown\nbelow. Click OK and wait for the virtual machine to shutdown.\n\n\n\n*Once the virtual machine has shutdown, quit VirtualBox. Enter the\nfollowing in the same Terminal window. These commands will update\nthe MBR bootstrap code, set the Windows partition identifier to 7\nin the MBR and then mount the partition. The input for the\ninteractive command fdisk is taken  from the variable INPUT. If\na password is asked for, enter it.\nsudo  fdisk  -u  -y  -f  $DISK1  $DISK0\nINPUT=$(printf  \"s  $PARTITION\\n7\\nw\\ny\\nq\")\nsudo  fdisk  -e   $DISK0  <<<\"$INPUT\"\ndiskutil  mount  $PARTID\n\n\n\n*Close all other applications. Open System Preferences and select\n\"Startup Disk\". Highlight the \"Untitled Windows\" icon and click the\n\"Restart\" button.\n\nIf something goes wrong, you will need to hold down the \"option\" key\nat startup to return to OS X. Hopefully, nothing will go wrong and\nWindows will start.\n\n\n*When Windows finishing installing, install the Boot Camp Support\nSoftware (the drivers). This software is either in the\n\"C:\\Users\\Public\\Public Documents\" folder, or on a flash drive.\nCOMMENTS\nOn OS X El Capitan (10.11) the System Integrity Protection does not allow editing the MBR with fdisk, so disable SIP following these instructions for the duration of the install.\nI ended up having to create two user accounts. If you only want one account, you have two options. First, delete one of the accounts. Second, disable one of the accounts so it will not appear. The former can be accomplished from the Control Panel, the latter requires entering the command control  userpasswords2 in a Command Prompt window. For example, below is the window were one can enable or disable the rpj account. If you need help let me know.\n\n\nA: Here's one way of doing it, it's not elegant but it will work.\nDownload and install Virtualbox and install Windows on it from your .ISO file. This will verify your .ISO is working. Once you've got Windows installed, download Rufus. This will create a bootable USB drive that will boot your MacBook, assuming the .ISO is good to begin with. Once that's done you can bin the virtual machine and Virtualbox, ready to install Windows for real on the Boot Camp partition (if that's where it's going).\nIt's worth noting you don't need to use Boot Camp if Windows is going onto a drive of its own - BC is designed to create a hybrid partition table that will allow OS X and Windows to co-exist, and simply isn't needed if the OSes live on separate drives.\n\nA: I was able to fix it by disabling System Integrity Protection (rootless) a new security feature in El Captain.\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart and enter recovery partition by holding down keys: Command + R\n\n*Open Terminal from menu and enter csrutil disable; reboot\n\n*Restart hold key R and select El Captain partition. \n\n*Open bootcamp and re-format/install Windows\n\n\nThis then worked this time automatically restarting windows. \n", "Q: 2011 i5 27\" imac wired keyboard does not power up I have tried 3 keyboards and every one does not get power until after OS X starts it's boot sequence, it seem the USB bus is not getting power until about a minute after startup.

This worked perfectly, but after syncing the songs to my iPhone, the tag does not show up in the Music app.\nI figured it was an issue with how I added the tag, but then today I downloaded one of the free songs of the week, which displays a [C] in the iTunes app on my phone. I downloaded it and went to it in the Music app, but it does not show the [C] tag in any playlist, in the song tab, or in the Artist tab (navigating to the song on that tab). It also does not show a [C] or [Clean] on the Now Playing screen.\nHow do I get the tag to show up in the Music app? Or does the Music app simply not show the [Clean] tags (and only shows the [Explicit] tags)?\n\nA: Going along with Stuart H's comment, I believe the music app for iOS only looks for explicit tags on a song because they can be used for setting restrictions on the device, clean tags are unnecessary because the songs are considered to be clean unless an explicit tag is found. So having a tag for every song would be pretty useless and clutter up the UI. \n", "Q: Macbook Pro on Yosemite - screen going to black I have a fresh install of OS X Yosemite.

I don't merely want to \"arrange them\".\n\nA: System Prefs > Displays > Arrangement.\nDrag one monitor over the other to the opposite side, then move the Menu bar to whichever monitor you prefer.\nThe actual screen is given a large red outline as well as the representation in the control panel as you drag, so you're certain which one is which.\nBTW, that tenacious holding onto which display is which is a whole lot better than it used to be, where it would randomly decide 2 identical screens were the opposite way round on occasions - back in 10.6 & before.\n\n\n\n", "Q: Check if an OS X user is an administrator? In a script, how can I check if user \"Bill\" is a member of the admin group (group 80)?\nI plan to use this in a script to check if he is and if he is not, make him an admin user.\n\nA: See the man page for id.\nid -G user \n\nwill output a space delimited list of groups for a particular user.

I have purchased a few apps but none do the job properly, they are still there the next day, I have 3 hard drives so plenty of space. The pictures seem to get duplicated every time I try something. I have tried iPhoto but still get the same problem.\n\nA: There are many options – and at least three different approaches to this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a third party application to find (and remove) duplicate files. Probably the most convenient option – there is a variety of different apps like Duplicate Detective available – but you'll have to buy a license. There used to be a free demo version of Gemini, if you just want to find duplicates and delete them yourself. Haven't tried it for years though. \n\n*Use the search function of your finder. This is a bit clumsy, but good method to find duplicates occasionally. You can search for \"*\" (asterix/wildcard) and then narrow your results down by using the filters and the sort options – e.g. \"only images, modified after 1st of January 2014\" or the like.\n\n*Use Terminal Commands or Apple Script. You should probably only go this direction if you know what you're doing.\nThere is a blog post \"How to Find and Delete Duplicate Files in Mac OS X\" that goes deeper into these three approaches. \n", "Q: iBook G4r system installation I have an iBook G4, HDD wiped clean.

Also, did it shutdown because although the disk is Tiger... which it should run, the installation disk was not configured for the iBook?\n\nA: Press the power button then hold the spacebar down.\nIf the keyboard is working, the system firmware will interpret that as a request to force eject the CD/DVD before continuing to start the OS.\nUnless the firmware or hardware are faulty - then you might need to disassemble things to rescue the CD.\n", "Q: Combined in/out audio with one 3.5mm 4 pin jack - Macbook Pro (2015) I recently bought a 3.5mm 4 Pin to 2x 3 Pin 3.5mm headset splitter adapter.

I tried modifying my info.plist so i could create a USB install of my windows iso but when I create a boot camp partition and hit install it restarts into a gray screen and nothing happens. If I attempt to force restart from this It boots into an apple logo that hangs until it goes to a black screen that says \"No bootable device found - please insert a bootable device and hit any key.\" I then force restarted and held down option and when it loaded it didn't show my USB as a device (only my main ssd drive and my optical bay hard disk).\nI found a YouTube video of a Czech guy who used virtual box to start the install and then move it to the desired disk and used refit to access it, but when I installed refit it didn't even show up in my boot devices when I held down option... \nMy question is how I can go about installing windows 7 on my 2010 macbook pro that has an ssd in the main hard drive and a hard disk on the optical bay drive. It can be installed to either disk but I suppose the ssd would be better since its faster to boot. I have a working ISO (showed working from virtual box installs) and a USB drive.\n\nA: Since this question has been marked as a duplicate, I have moved my answer to the other question.

The problem is similar to Windows when Explorer crashes and you get no OS chrome.\nBy randomly pressing keys we've been able to make iTunes appear and from there we can get into settings etc. but still no Dock.\nSpotlight doesn't work either!\nWhy might this have happened and how do we fix it?\n\nSpecs: MacBook7,1, Mac OS X 10.6.8 (10K549), Darwin 10.8.0.\nIt would be useful know if there are any default keyboard shortcuts that handle things like 'launch Finder' or 'open Applications folder' - this would be extremely useful as it would make the Mac usable should this happen again.\n\nA: You can use spotlight (⌘-Space) to do most anything. ⌘⇧A opens Apps folder, ⌘⇧H opens Home folder.\nTo fix your problem: Try opening the Terminal app (launch via Spotlight). Then type killall Dockand press return. That will attempt to kill the Dock process and relaunch it.\nIf that doesn't work you can check Activity Monitor (launch via Spotlight) and search for the Dock process to see if it's running at all, and if so, if it's hanging.\n\nA: cmd-tab will toggle you between applications. use this to get to the finder.\nonce in the finder alt-cmd D will show or hide the dock\n\nA: Safest bet would be reinstalling OS X or creating a second user and see if the problem persists there. The finders Go To menu shows you all the shortcuts. \nCmd + A for Applications for example.\n\nA: I have a few ideas:\n\n\n*\n\n*Look into the preferences - maybe it's something trivial such as dock hiding on the side or on a second monitor.\n\n*log in with guest account and see if it is normal there (you can activate it in the preferences)\n\n*when you are logged in as guest you could try to look in the \"console\" for errors.\n\n*i suppose you could also fire up a terminal there and do some stuff in her account - but that might be dangerous so report back before trying anything.\n\nA: Some things to consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*Finder is designed to re-launch itself always. If you can kill the process via ssh or terminal or Activity Monitor, do that one time\n\n*Dock will restart itself, so try killing it too - one time. \n\n*collect system diagnostics if you expect is to be something that persists - you will need that to work with support and engineering - sudo sysdiagnose Dock\n\n*Spotlight should always run, so try the keyboard shortcut to open Activity Monitor. If that fails, more than the dock and menu bar are wedged. \n\n\nNow, unless you have ssh or Remote Desktop enabled, your practical next step is to power down the Mac and hope you don't need to wipe it and restore from a backup.  If you don't have a back up that's current, don't power on the Mac until you've gotten some help on how to do a back up.\nOnce you have a back up or have decided you can risk losing your work, you can try starting the machine back up. In the vast majority of cases where the UI gets hung like this, it was an unlikely event that caused to hang and you won't be able to reproduce it. (i.e. your Mac should fix itself in most cases.)\n", "Q: headset doesn't works on my iphone My headset doesn't work on my iPhone (4) \nBut it works on another iPhone.\nSometimes when I turned off my iPhone & unplug the headset it works but now.\nHow can I fix that?\n\nA: I had the same issue.

Is there a way to create an easy-to-restore backup file / iOS image that I can put on an hard drive and then use for a quick and painless restore after I get the new macbook? \nAppreciate any suggestions, thanks in advance\n\nA: The easiest way to copy your old setup (including your data) onto your new machine is to use Migration Assistant on the new model. This requires both computers to be connected \"somehow\" (with this \"somehow\" being as fast as possible, so a LAN is usually better than WLAN for instance). \nIf you don't have access to both machines simultaneously, I would use an external drive, use Disk Utility (or CCC or SuperDuper!) to create a full backup of the old computer and then use this backup as the data source for Migration Assistant. Creating a full image usually is faster than using Time Machine, you can then use the drive as a Time Machine destination after the migration.\n", "Q: Assistive Touch on iPad mini is getting turned off automatically Assistive Touch on my iPad mini is getting turned off automatically and when I go to Settings to check the status it will be in the off state.No-one is changing the status from on to off.I don't know why this happening.\n\nA: At the very bottom of the assistive preferences there's an option to put something on \"shortcut\" - meaning pressing the home button 3 times. \nAny chance you have that on assistive touch and do it by accident?\n", "Q: How to deactivate iPhone USB tethering when OSX is connected to a wireless network \nI have enabled USB tethering from my iPhone to my MacBook pro, and it works perfectly.\nNevertheless, I would like to automatically disable USB tethering when the MacBook Pro is connected to a wireless network, to save mobile data consumption.\nHow can I configure that in OSX?\n\nA: First things first, you do not need to worry too much about mobile data consumption when connected to Wi-Fi.  As depicted in your picture, Wi-Fi is listed above the iPhone USB interface and will take precedence as the primary interface.  In other words, all traffic will be sent to Wi-Fi until it is no longer available or you manually change the service order to have Wi-Fi listed BELOW the iPhone USB interface.\nIf, you really want to permanently disable that connection, you can do two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Highlight iPhone USB, then select the \"Deactivate\" option from the cogwheel underneath the list (you can activate it the same way again later)\n\n*Highlight iPhone USB, then click the minus (\"-\") button to remove it.\n\n\nAgain, deactivating or removing this interface is not important as long as other connected interfaces are listed ABOVE iPhone USB.\n\nA: Recent versions of macOS, including Sierra, include a feature to automatically do what you seek, disabling the tethering device unless needed (i.e. no other network adapter is active):\n\nThis option only works if there are no other active interfaces, some of which might not appear in the network preferences pane (such as on late 2016 Macbook Pros).\n", "Q: Safari 8 fails to play any (mp4) video in-browser I'm using Safari 8.0.4 on OS X 10.10.2. Anywhere and everywhere, Safari refuses to play any (mp4) video on any website. Youtube and Apple's website are the only places where Safari plays any videos.\nEven on my own Google Drive account, my uploaded videos fail to play.\nThis is what I see:\n\nHow can I resolve this?\n\nA: It could be caused by a corrupt or incompatible video codec or interfering third-party software. Playing MP4 video files should work in any browser.\nHere is what you can try…\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing the latest OS X Yosemite Updates also updates the Quicktime framework which is used by Safari. Safari loads video Codecs from the /Library/Internet Plug-Ins directory. So make sure Safari is updated by going to App Store -> Updates -> Safari (version 10.x is the latest version).\n\n*Make sure that the Internet plugin-ins checkbox is enabled. Safari -> Preferences -> Security -> Internet plugin-ins -> Allow Plug-ins\n\n\n*Does using a browser with Flash built-in (like Chrome) allow you to play mp4 files? If so, try deleting or updating Flash in System Preferences, which could fix Safari. \nIf none of this helps, just try switching to a different browser (popular ones include Chrome, Firefox, Vivaldi, and Opera) or a different WiFi network.\n", "Q: Boot MacBook Pro from USB stick Concerning a MacBook Pro with Snow Leopard. As you know when pressing alt during startup there is the possibility of selecting which disc/drive/memory you want to boot from. For example if you have a CD/DVD inserted in the computer or Bootcamp Windows installed they can be selectable to boot from.\nHere's what I want to do: I want that when I have a USB stick inserted to the computer, I want to be able to boot from that in the same manner as can be done with e.g. a DVD.\nThe problem is that when I have a USB stick connected to the computer during startup and press alt, the USB is not selectable to boot from. So the question is: How can I enable the computer to (during startup) select a connected USB stick to boot from?\nI have tried a program called rEFit, which gives you another menu during startup, where you can for example select if you want to boot from any partition that you created. Unfortunately it still doesn't enable booting from a connected USB stick, at least not automatically. So I wonder how to enable booting from a USB stick, either in this program, or otherwise.\nIf you have done this yourself, or if you have any good ideas on how to enable it, please share.\n\nA: USB thumb drives behave much like internal hard drives in terms of booting from it on a Mac.  Therefore, it depends on what you have on those drives.  If there is \"just data\" on the USB stick, it will, very much like \"data\" hard drives, not show up at the boot picker.\nAs a test, you can try to install a for your system supported version of Mac OS X onto the USB stick and then see whether it shows or not (I would understand that it will show thereafter as all Intel Macs can boot from USB).\nNOTE: For obvious reasons, you should back up whatever you have on the USB stick before attempting this.\n\nA: You can only boot from a USB device if it contains the necessary startup files required for your Mac, generally either an operating system or operating system installation files. You could install OS X on a USB stick or drive, or you could use Disk Utility's Restore function to copy a bootable DVD/CD (or disk image) to a USB stick.\nWithout the necessary startup files there is nothing to boot the system - only bootable devices will appear in the Mac boot picker. \nREFInd/rEFIt is simply a boot selector/manager that hooks into the OS X startup sequence, giving more flexible options for alternative boot sources. It isn't any sort of boot enabler and doesn't make devices bootable in the absence of an operating system or startup files.\n", "Q: Allow system to sleep even with audio stream running For a bit of background info: I have a 2010 MacBook Pro 15 with OSX 10.10.2 installed.\nI'm looking to make the laptop go to sleep even when a proccess that sets PreventUserIdleSystemSleep=1 is open. In this particular case, it as coreaudiod.\nI was thinking of something similar to the Windows powercfg -requestsoverride for specific processes/drivers.\n\nA: You can use a third party tool like Power Manager to make your Mac sleep after a period of inactivity.\n\nUnlike OS X's Energy Saver, Power Manager can put your unused Mac to sleep even when an application or process has requested otherwise. \nDisclaimer: I wrote Power Manager and can answer comments about how it works.\n", "Q: Shutdown cause: -104 I have Macbook Pro retina, model 2013.

It did not help. The hardware test found no errors. I have tried to google the meaning of shutdown code \"-104\", but I could not find anything.\nCan anyone please provide any info about what's going on and possibly how to fix it? Thanks.\n\nA: It appears to be battery related. It may be related to -103, however both indicate that you should check the battery. Try running the laptop from the charger and see if the laptop still unexpectedly shuts down. Also check to see if there are any spurious sensor readings for the battery using iStat Menus or equivalent which may indicate the laptop trying to protect itself by shutting down.\n\n-103\n  Battery cell under voltage detected.\n  Check battery.\n-104\nunknown\n  Check battery.\n\nSource: Shutdown Causes\n", "Q: \"Find My iPhone\" locked my Mac Yesterday my MacBook Pro started to be blocked.\nWhen it boots it asks for the password for the Guest account. No password is right. According to various sources of information I found on the Web, this may mean that the computer has been locked from iCloud using \"Find My iPhone\".\nFrom https://www.icloud.com/#find the Macbook seems to be blocked:\n\nBut there is no \"unlock\" button on iCloud:\n\nWhen I click \"Play Sound\" a sound is effectively played by the Macbook:\n\n\"Find My iPhone\" is not able to locate the computer's location, but it is here, on my desk!\nWhen I power off the MacBook Pro something changes on https://www.icloud.com/#find and a button \"Remove from Account\" appears. After I clicked that button the MacBook Pro is removed from the device listing. But as soon as I reboot the Macbook will reappear in the listing.\nI don't understand what is wrong: I own the computer, I own the iCloud/Apple ID account but I can neither use it, nor unlock it.\nI tried to call Apple, today they won't respond (today it's Sunday, tomorrow is a holiday in my country.) I can't wait till tuesday.\nDo you know how to solve my issue?\n\nA: Solved following these steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Removed my macbook from iCloud\n\n*Followed this guide: http://www.tomsguide.com/forum/id-1317787/unlock-apple-macbook-pro.html\n", "Q: Will signing in to iMessage on another device send an email to the Apple ID notifying of this? I was told I could monitor my 13 year old daughter's messages on an old iPhone through Wi-Fi. I was told to set up message on the phone with her Apple ID and password.\nMy question is will Apple send her an email asking her to allow the messages to be sent to my phone? I know they send one telling her someone accessed her account. If they only send one saying someone signed into her account that's ok.\n\nA: It will send an email telling her iMessage has been enabled on a device. But there's no grant/deny option, it's just an informational email.\n", "Q: How do I edit an Info.plist file? I want to edit three lines of file\n\nWhenever I try to edit it this comes up\n\nI already gave myself permission to Read & Write (I'm 21muffinp)\n\nThe same thing still comes up, saying I do not have perimission.\n\nA: You need read/write permissions to the containing folder as well as the plist itself for Xcode to modify the file in place.\nA workaround for this if you are unable to change the permissions of the containing folder is to copy the file out, edit it, then copy it back over the top of the existing file. Alternatively, you can use a different property list editor such as the CLI ‘defaults’.\n\nA: As already mentioned, you will need write permissions for the folder as well as the file. You can't write on a bit of paper that's stored in a room you can only see in to. ;)\nAnother workaround is to use an editor such as BBEdit (or TextWrangler if you don't need all the features) which will elevate to the correct privileges for you when you attempt to edit the file. Make sure you download the non-App Store versions of these apps, however, otherwise you won't have the option to elevate (because of Apple's sandboxing restrictions for MAS apps).\nIf you're okay with using Terminal, take a look at using PlistBuddy (which can be accessed at /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy) to edit your .plist files. I prefer it to defaults because it allows you to really drill down in to dicts and arrays when you need to (defaults has an issue with nested keys). Make sure you run it with sudo though otherwise you'll still have permissions problems.\nEDIT: The above still holds somewhat true in 2021, but you may find that the BBEdit/TextWrangler approaches don't work for some newer .plist files due to the fact that binary PLists are preferred over the older XML-based PLists. (Full disclosure: I haven't worked directly with PLists for a few years now.) You can, however, manipulate binary PLists with a VSCode plugin so it might be worth checking that out if you want a modern GUI approach.\n\nA: Under El Capitan you need to temporarily disable the System Integrity Protection to be able to edit the .plist file.\nTo do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the Apple menu.\n\n*Select Restart...\n\n*Hold down Command + R to boot into Recovery mode.\n\n*Click the Utilities menu and select Terminal.\n\n*Type csrutil disable and press return.\n\n*Close the Terminal app.\n\n*Click the Apple menu and select Restart...\n\n\nYou should now be able to modify the file, after you can repeat these steps with csrutil enable to secure your machine again.\n\nA: Try to run Xcode with root privileges:\nsudo /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/MacOS/Xcode\n\n", "Q: Difference between Express and Standard Replacement Service for iPad battery Can a user use Express Replacement Service to get a new battery if still under warranty? \nHow's that different than Battery Replacement Service again under warranty?\n\nA: With express service you'll get a replacement device before sending back your old one. That way you don't have to spend time without a device. \nIt's available under warranty but will be charged. \nPrice in Austria is 29€ incl. TAX to give you an idea. \n", "Q: IPad Battery replacement criteria under warranty, no applecare does the complimentary one year warranty cover replacement of batteries that go below 50% of original capacity? What is 50%...? Like how fast does it have to drain? Is there a way to measure without bringing the iPad to an Apple store?\n\nA: Yes, the warranty covers battery failure. \nThe batteries capacity can be measured in mAh.\nIf Apple sells it with 1000mAh, then 500 would mean 50% (example numbers). I'm not sure at what percentage Apple considers a battery failure but I'm strongly assuming 50% within a year is considered a warranty case. \nCall AppleCare or take it to a store. They will give you a URL to enter in Safari (something like diag://12345)\nThat will send the test results to Apple (including battery capacity) and they'll tell you your options to get your battery swapped. \nThere is no official way to check your battery capacity yourself (there are possibilities with jailbroken devices AFAIK). \n", "Q: What does (10 hours)² mean? (specifications) I was looking at the specifications of the MacBooks (pro) on Apples website and I saw this. Built-in battery (10 hours)².\nWhat does the '²' mean? Why (10 hours)² and not 10 hours?\n\nA: There is an explanation in the footnotes:\n\n2 Testing conducted by Apple in February 2015 using pre-production 2.9GHz dual-      core Intel Core i5–based 13-inch MacBook Pro units. The wireless web test measures battery life by wirelessly browsing 25 popular websites with display brightness set to 12 clicks from bottom or 75%. The HD film playback test measures battery life by playing back HD 1080p content with display brightness set to 12 clicks from bottom or 75%. Battery life varies by use and configuration. See www.apple.com/uk/batteries for more information.\n\n\nA: ‘²’ indicates there’s a footnote. It means, see the second footnote. It doesn’t mean the battery life is 10² hours, though that would be awesome.\n", "Q: Game Center saves my Clash of Clans account? I going to sell my iPhone.

I tried to log into my daughter's iMessage on an inactive iPhone. She called Apple because she got an email. They told her it was an iPhone 5c black. How did they know that? Do they know who the owner is? Is there a way to block my old iPhone so Apple can't trace it?\n\nA: They store device information thats linked to the UDID of the device. As far as I know, they can't tell who the owner is for sure. Moreover, I also doubt you can block the old phone.\n\nA: The serial number has the device information included. Their database just pulls up the record according to the serial number. You can try and see it for yourself with any Apple device by using the support page. There, click on \"Browse by Product\" and type in your serial number. While this search does not necessarily give you the color or size, the type of device (e.g. iPhone 5c) will show up as first search result.\nAnother of their pages will show some more information and allows you to even get what support you have left by entering the serial number: Check Your Service and Support Coverage\nSo, nothing fancy or ill-meant really.\nThe owner gets registered when the iPhone is used with the iTunes Store or iCloud the first time.

I use the keyboard viewer as a cheat sheet so I can guide myself in the horrible fields of OSX keymaps and I realised that pressing some keys will display a few keys in orange. What does that color indicate?\n\n\nA: Those keys in orange are so-called dead keys. It's a key that does not necessarily generate a complete character by itself but may modify the character generated by the key struck immediately after.\nThe usage of those dead keys in a text editor or in the Terminal is usually indicated by a yellowish background. You may then enter the main character you want to modify to finally get the desired one.\nNot all combinations of a dead key and a normal key are used. Typing altn (=~) n will result in a 'ñ'. But altn (=~) t just gives '~t'.\n\nA: The orange represent accent characters to add to the next inputed letter. It is functionally equivalent to accessing OSX’s accent menu - holding down a key and seeing:\n\nFor example. So, alternatively, you can type optionu followed byu to add a diaresis to the letter ü\n\nA: It means that those symbols overlay themselves onto whatever letter you next. For example, Optionu followed by u would type ü, rather than ¨u.\n", "Q: Is there an iOS spreadsheet app that can do data filters? Google Sheets only does data filters in the browser, their mobile app does not support that feature. Is there another iOS spreadsheet app that does support such a feature?

Everything worked fine, but it had belonged to a school, and it had DeepFreeze installed on it, and it really bothered her. She got her hands on a Snow-Leopard Installation Disk, and tried to reinstall OS X. When she put the disk in and held down C, it booted up in Snow-Leopard, but it said \"this OS X Cannot Be Installed On This Computer\", and proceeded to try to go to TimeMachine. So this is where it gets interesting. She read somewhere to ignore any messages that pop up, and she went ahead and in the Disk Utility, she deleted the \"Macintosh HD\", so there is no longer an OS on the drive. \nI am a PC guy, and I have no idea what to do now. Is there any way to get the Snow-Leopard OS X disk to work on an Early-2009 MacBook, or will I have to torrent a Leopard Image and go through the process of putting it on a proper DVD?\n\nA: Leopard  (10.5) came out in 2007, Snow Leopard (10.6) was in 2009.  Most of the time when this error occurs, it's because the hardware didn't exist when the installation media was created, so it doesn't know how to install.  Typically, the hardware contains hardware for which the installation media doesn't contain proper drivers.  More importantly, though, Leopard and Snow Leopard are out-of-support.  \nThe early 2009 MacBooks will support the latest version of OS X, Yosemite (10.10).  To ensure you're running a supported OS, I would install OS X 10.10.  If you or her were to take this laptop into an Apple Store, they can assist with installing Yosemite.\n\nA: Though the Early-2009 MacBook runs Snow Leopard perfectly well, it's obviously not on the list of allowed Macs on this installer DVD.\nIf you receive an error “OS X Cannot Be Installed On This Machine” under those circumstances, this is due to using a non-retail version of OS X meaning it was part of a restore suite that came with another Mac model. Although the disc contains the full retail version of OS X, there is a machine verification string that takes place during startup which excludes all Mac models except the model(s) the disc(s) came with.\nHere or there are lengthy and time-consuming guides how to modify a non-retail DVD to allow installation on all capable Macs. You need another Mac though or at least a VM running Snow Leopard or later to accomplish that.\nThe other options are buying a retail Snow Leopard, asking nicely in an Apple Store to install Snow Leopard (I don't know if they still support that) or indeed torrenting some retail Snow Leopard DVD.\nP.S. If you want to install Leopard choose at least Leopard 10.5.6 - that was the preinstalled system the Mac originally came with.\n", "Q: \"Import Files into iTunes\" automator action not working I'm having an issue with a simple automator action, \"Import Files into iTunes\".

(audio bit depth / sample size) I have a large iTunes library of lossless music. Some of it is 24-bit, which does not work on iPhones nor with Google Play (most audio is 16-bit, and this metric only applies to lossless formats). I'd like to isolate the 24-bit files so that I can convert them to 16-bit formats. How can I find them?\niTunes is aware of this as \"sample size\" - it appears in each file's \"get info\" under \"File\" tab. However, it is not a sortable column. It is not in Finder \"get info.\" \n\n\n*\n\n*Using the appropriate filters in Finder search, does not do anything (all files appear), or, perhaps I'm not doing it right, in which case please tell me how!\n\n*I know about the auto downsampling option for iPhone sync, which is great, except that it forces you to a lossy format (max 256 kbps). There is no option for 16-bit lossless downsampling, and this does not help at all with Google Play. \n\n*My files are in Apple Lossless format (Some were converted from FLAC using XLD and some were ripped from CD directly). \n\nA: I've been fiddling with this all day - so far all I can say is 'I agree, Finder search does not find files by bit rate or depth'. MediaInfo will tell you - but that would be really tedious. \nI did notice too, that the 'Bits per Sample' flag in Finder's column view always just shows a double dash '--'\nIt's fine for AIF & WAV, but not FLAC, ALAC, MP3 etc\nI did think I had a late revelation…\nEasyFind (freeware) can nearly do it. It generates false positives on some flac files I tested it against, but it did find all the 24-bit files… it just 'found' some 16-bit too for no reason I can discern.\nTest 2, on 16 & 24-bit ALAC files - fails, doesn't even find all the 24s… back to the drawing board.\nI thought I'd just post this 'non-answer' as a 'this isn't being ignored' & see if anyone else can get any further.\n", "Q: My iTunes account shows an incorrect device How do I change my device in iTunes.

As such, the damage is now beyond our ability to repair- we will replace the disk drive mechanism and return the repaired unit.\"\nI find this interesting, because I may not have found out about this problem until after I loaded critical data on the drive. I was able to format the drive and copy to and from the drive without issue...encrypting the drive exposed the problem. I still need to confirm that the \"repaired unit\" will encrypt as expected, hopefully I will receive that back soon.\n\nFinal update: after receiving the new drive, everything encrypted as expected. My advice is to try to encrypt every drive when you first get it, as a failure may detect some glitches that you'd want to see sooner rather than later...\n\nA: I understand that you're running into issues, so this is going to be more for others looking for info on this topic.

Simply go to the Time Machine settings, \"Add or Remove Backup Disk...\"\n\nand check the \"Encrypt backups\" checkbox:\n\n", "Q: Does it make any sense to complain about App Store app review? Apple has refused my app, but I can not accept reason. They said it is not able to fully loaded, but on all device, conditions etc. work well for me.  \nDo you think is it any chance they read my complain, and tries to recheck my app, or better to submit and wait an other 1 week for review?\n\nWe discovered one or more bugs in your app when reviewed on iPad running iOS 8.2 and iPhone running iOS 8.2 on both Wi-Fi and cellular networks. Specifically, we found that your app is unable to fully load and function.\n\n\nA: You can request the review board to review the complaint.\nHowever, I would ask them what screen caused the bug - I've heard of times when a tester tried to use PassBook on an iPad when that functionality only loads on an iPhone. By asking politely, you'll better understand what code to cut from this submission rather than have to do that blindly and resubmit. You could also resubmit that exact build to TestFlight and ask to have it approved so you can have coverage for that build of that device from your testing pool.\nWithout seeing the text of the rejection it's hard to know what or why you got the no. Absolutely, make a new build and submit that for review. Even if it takes a week or two due to the crush of new apps for Apple Watch - you can always then make an appeal if the rejection doesn't make more sense in 48 hours time once you've looked it over and/or reached out to other developers to get their opinion of the situation.\nPersonally, I would thank them for the rejection. Offer a fixed build to address their specific complaints and only revert to an appeal after 6 weeks of unsuccessful attempts to get the initial version passed.\nYou don't say if this app has ever been approved - so allowing several months for that is realistic if the app isn't clearly something that has had significant engineering put into it.\nAlso - I find putting the app into TestFlight for beta allows you to discover sooner what points Apple sees as problematic with your app without it being a \"go live\" or \"die in a fire\" scenario.\nTL;DR - find any way to give the reviewer what they ask in all or in part and try to avoid taking it to the review board until you're sure there is no other option.\n\nA: If you've addressed their concerns in the Resolution Center and still think you want to continue, you're only option is to submit an appeal.\nAccording to Apple: \n\nThe App Review Board provides the opportunity to appeal the rejection of an app if you believe that the functionality or technical implementation was misunderstood. You can submit additional details to the App Review Board to help them determine if your app should be reconsidered.\n\nAfter that, you're done.  If they still reject it there isn't anything left to do.  I wouldn't go public with the app and the reason for the rejection, Apple doesn't look kindly on that.

Is it the GPU (Nvidia GeForce 300M) or the logic board? I've heard that many people had the logic board changed. I suppose a 'logic board' is the 'mother board', right?\nQuestion 2:\nI'm the owner of a MBP manufactured in 2010, but I haven't upgraded the OS so far, so I'm happy with my Mac. But now I need to upgrade, and I'm afraid I could have a bad surprise.\nIs there a way to detect if my laptop is affected by this hardware bug before upgrading the OS? Maybe a testing tool to examine the hardware under stressing GPU switching? If anybody can suggest a proven test to run on Snow Leopard, I'll be grateful.\nQuestion 3: being that a hardware related issue, it's not possible to be fixed by software patches. Why has it been latent on many Snow Leopard OS powered machines, then?\nThanks for your help\n\nA: I am posting this answer to 5 similar questions. I tried everything from the Kext changes to the Github patch. I also tried to use Gfx. However, here's what worked for me. The latest version of Gfx doesn't set the MBP to use the Integrated card permanently. However, GFx version v1.8.1 does. Open it and set it to use Intel.\n\n\nI have not had a GPU panic for 2 days. I also disabled SIP and installed the Github patch, but I still had Panics after that (however, this might be a solution thats GFx only, or maybe the patch also helped. Try Gfx 1.8.1 first)\n\nA: Try installing gfxCardStatus, which is a free/open-source utility that could solve the problem instead of a $2,300 graphics card. In addition to a zipped download, it can also be installed as a Homebrew Cask (source):\nbrew cask install gfxcardstatus\n\nMy system was severely affected with these panics, but that stopped happening after using that utility.\n\nA: i never had the problem with Snow Leopard, Lion or Mountain Lion. When I upgraded to Mavericks it started to crash the os..Kernel Panic after an hours use. I figured Mavericks was buggy and upgraded to Yosemite which caused the crash very rapidly and would crash even if there was no software installed (just the os installed)\nThere is a test you can do\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202731\nMy understanding is every unit will have this problem after getting taxed by the higher demands of the new operating systems. The fact that Apple charges for a repair which was caused by their operating system blows my mind.\n", "Q: Lock vertical resize of the dock in Mac OS X I can't find a way to make my dock only resize horizontally when new apps appear.

I want 2 Apple IDs on my phone and the content off 1 computer backed up on another. I am only 11 years old and don't have the best understanding of Apple devices. I have one computer that I have downloaded iTunes on and have many apps and songs on it. Another computer I have also has iTunes on it. I currently have my iPhone 4S connected to the computer with all the stuff on it. The problem is, that this computer is is old and takes forever to load up. It has so much stuff on it on my dad's Apple ID. I want to transfer this content off the old computer and onto the other newer one. I also don't know whether I can buy songs and apps on my own Apple ID and keep my dad's Apple ID connected to my phone and have both Apple IDs content on the phone at the same time. I have a very negative view on Apple and their need to keep all music and apps exclusive to apple devices. I know this question will probably sound stupid to you and if so, I would appreciate it immensely if you politely informed me that it can't be done. Otherwise it would be great if you could tell me how to do it. Thank you for bothering to read this far and please answer if you know how to do it.\n\nA: Thank you for posting today. I'm sure we can find a workable solution for you today.\nApple allows multiple computers to hold and play content, sync to devices, and all of that via iTunes. For you to play the content from the older computer on the newer one, here is what you will have to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy over the content from the iTunes Media folder on Computer A (old computer) to the iTunes Media on Computer B (new computer). Typically, the iTunes Media folder is located under C:\\Users{your user}\\My Music\\iTunes\\iTunes Media. (See special note on Step 2)\n\n*Import the music and all other files to your newer iTunes library. The easiest way to do this, if you want all content, is simply to place all of the files when copying them over into the \"Add to iTunes\" folder located within the iTunes Media folder.\n\n*When the item is in the new iTunes on Computer B, try playing one of the files. You will be prompted to authorize your computer for your dad's account.\n\n*Sign-in to your Dad's iTunes account to authorize. This can be done on up to 5 computers, including the original, and can be modified at a later time via iTunes Store -> My Account -> Authorized Devices\n\n*You should now be able to sync as needed with your iDevice and others\n\n\nPlease note that if you had apps under the older account and sync those to your phone, if they need to be updated it will require the other login (though this is about to be phased out). Music, however, should load without issue as long as the computer that you synced with retains authorization to play. The iPhone won't care which AppleID bought it, as long as it is able to make it onto the device (either by purchase on the iPhone or by purchase/authorization/etc on the computer and synced up).\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Simple Low-Cost Network Backup System - Drobo? Alternatives? I'm hoping to graduate from manually copying important files to multiple external desk or portable drives; affordably.\nWe have 3 Macs and an iPad or two. I have just now learned about Drobo, who as I understand it offer a very user-friendly RAID system, which for any uninformed readers is a redundant array of independent discs, so that your data is backed up on at least two discs, interfaced as a single drive (very simplistic explanation/understanding).\nIt definitely seems more sensible to be purchasing a single \"case\" for multiple hard drives as opposed to more than one portable drive, and then adding/replacing the functional aspects of the drive as needed.\nI'm not looking for full Time-Capsule style OS-system backups here - just reliable back-up of specific files.\nThe Drobo conversations I'm finding here on Ask Different seem to be a few years old.\nDoes the Dobro include software as well as hardware. Is it a minimal computer that is specifically for managing a RAID system? Is this kind of like getting a TV with a VCR built in? \nA more recent discussion on MacObserver including someone's RAID system in an Other World Computing drive bay.\nI'm hoping for some input from the community before making a purchase. What are some of you using and please share experiences/recommendations and any pros and cons that come to mind.\n\nA: First thing I would like to comment on is \"just reliable back-up of specific files.\" and you asking about Drobo RAID.  RAID is not a BACKUP, RAID protects you against a physical drive failure, it doesn't protect against deletion, corruption, overwrites, etc. Just copying your files to a system with RAID (i.e. Drobo) isn't backing them up, it is just making a copy of them. A true backup solution will let you restore a file to a point in time, reverting changes or restoring it completely if it was deleted.\nNow you CAN set this up with an external NAS like the Drobo. For example most of these devices (QNAP, Synology, Buffalo, etc.) have support for TimeMachine (Apple's backup service) on them. I know you said you didn't want OS-system backups but TimeMachine backs up up only a small subset of the OS, it is mainly a user's files and can be configured to ignore directories that you don't care about.\nI am currently running a 6 Disk QNAP TS-659 which I have as a TimeMachine target backing up 3 Mac's (1 Mini, 2 MBPs).  My QNAP is then running CrashPlan which backs up the other files from configured network shares on the QNAP to their Internet based service.\nIf you want to add another device to your network you could just back up directly to CrashPlan, they support individual encryption keys so they can't see your data and their unlimited data, 10 computer family plan is less then $200/year.  I actually purchased it for my family so I have my parents, in-laws and immediate family all backing up to it.\nAnother option is the CrashPlan free program which can use an external disk to create backups on (not file copies). Though since you are running Mac's this is duplicating TimeMachines functionality.\nNow if you want a Drobo or it's like for more then just actual backups and want to use it as a file share between multiple systems then that is a different story. The original Drobo's and OWC's drive bay's (or other's by caldigital, etc.) require a connection to a host computer through USB, FireWire or now Thunderbolt. Then the unit shows up as an external drive to the system. If it's a RAID unit then the primary benefit of it is that you can configure the disk's RAID to provide striping for fast access or RAID5 for lots of storage (not backups).\nNewer units from Drobo and ones from QNAP, Synology, Buffalo, etc. are actual NAS's (Network Attached Storage). They are a standalone unit that attaches to your network (wireless or wired depending on model) and then is configured through a web based GUI. You can create separate user accounts on them so multiple people can store their own files on the system and basically run it as a SOHO File/Print server.\n\nA: You might check out Transporter. It lets you attach a usb hard drive (or comes with one built in if you get that option) to your network and gives you a \"private cloud\" to store your files. Think of it as a Dropbox or Box like solution where you control the physical storage. They even let you connect them so if you have friends or family out of state you can have a remote backup mirrored across the network. This would give you some of the benefits of Drobo while also having backups in multiple locations.\nYou could even plug a Drobo into a Transporter if you wanted all the benefits of both.\n", "Q: Why am I so short on physical memory? My computer is getting old (almost 6 years old I think) and is becoming increasingly slow. The past few week were pretty bad and I am now realizing that my computer is continuously short on physical memory. Here is a screenshot of the memory activity showing that 3.98GB out of my 4GB of physical memory are used.\n\nThis screenshot was taken while I was using my computer as I usually do, not very intensively. I had 2 Safari windows open (gmail and StackExchange), I had two .txt files of about 10kb each opened with Sublime Text 2 and had the R (programming language) console opened but nothing really heavy was running and no particularly big objects were stored. I had 4 terminal (Bash) windows open to manipulate files and some ssh connections but nothing was running at the moment of the screenshot. I also had a 328kb pdf was open in Preview.\nSafari is taking much memory (at least more than what I would expect), so I switched to Google Chrome (but Google Chrome is known for taking much CPU) and to Firefox but the problem was not persisted.\nAre those applications taking too much memory? If yes, how can I solve this issue? Am I just overestimating the capacities of my computer (but I felt like I didn't such issues before)?\n\nFYI: My machine is a MacBook Pro running on OSX Yosemite (10.10.2) and here are some other screenshot in case it helps!\n\n\n\n\nA: Your memory and CPU usage are normal. And you don't appear to have anything massive running.\nModern computers utilize as much memory as possible before swapping anything out to the (much slower) disk. If you have more than 1-2 programs open you should expect to see the memory mostly full. The OS will handle swapping / clearing it as needed.\n\nMy computer is getting old (almost 6 years old I think) and is becoming increasingly slow.\n\nComputers do not slow down with age. But they do accumulate stuff. How full is your disk drive? If you have less than 20Gb or 15% free space your disk will take a lot longer to return results.\nOr your disk is having issues. Either way, installing an SSD is a simple and cheap way to get a huge performance boost out of an older machine. The drives cost under $200 now, changing one takes 15 minutes but on a macbook Pro will require some special screwdrivers.\n\nA: Apple computers (As well as a few PC's) use hard drive space as RAM if they need to. \nIf your hard drive is packed, it will effect your RAM as well. \nSSD will definitely speed up your mac but it will shrink the amount of hard drive space you have (most likely, depends how much you spend). I would first try cleaning out anything you don't need from your hard drive first. \n", "Q: Maximizing windows like on Windows Is there a way to maximize windows by dragging the window to the top of the screen? I'd also like to be able to drag windows to the side of the screen and have them take up half the screen like in Windows.\nI'm new to MacOS, and it seems that the green button in the upper right hand corner (that would normally maximize the screen in Windows) makes the window full screen, and I have to swipe back workspaces to get to the other windows. This is a great feature, but I would also like to be able to do a regular window maximization.\n\nA: Apple has its own charm. Instead of working like on a Windows screen, you may create additional Desktops, as many as you want.\nPersonally I work on multiple \"full\"/maximized screens.\nPress the F3 Button. \nNow from the right top side, move your cursor to the top and press + .\nFinally you can swipe between multiple screens simply by swiping 4 fingers right or left.\n\nA: As noted, there are 3rd-party apps. The one that I've been using for years now is MOOM. It's like Aero on steroids, and in my mind gives you better control using either hotkeys or right-click:\n\n\nA: You can use Better Touch Tool. There's the possibility to maximize the the window, take only half of the screen etc. Just like in Windows.\nAdditionally You get great tool to assign custom keyboard shortcuts and mouse/touchpad gestures.\n\n\nA: http://www.bettertouchtool.net/ has a 'Window Snapping' setting which will work exactly as you want.\nIn fact, I believe it's better than the way windows does it as it can also snap to the inside edge of a multiple display desktop!\nI also use it to reverse the scroll direction for left-right window changes without also changing the up/down scroll directions!\n\nA: In most applications, double click on the title bar to maximize a window, similar to the previous function of the green button. \n\nA: There are many 3rd party applications that brings Windows aero snap like abilities to OSX. I suggest iSnap. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/isnap/id420332190?mt=12\n\nA: Hold down option and hover over the green traffic light button in the upper left corner of the window.\nYou'll get options to zoom or fill the left or right halves of the screen.\nAlso: you can move the mouse to the corner of the window where it becomes a resizing arrow and option double click to fill the screen, WITHOUT going into full screen mode.\nDouble clicking on any side when the resize arrow is visible will move that side to the edge of the screen. Adding option makes it affect the opposite side as well.\n", "Q: How do I search for recipients in Apple Mail?

OS X does not have a Registry, however applications may store similar information in PLIST files in the /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Preferences folder.\nTypically if you want to remove every trace of an application, you need to check the following folders as well as removing the application bundle itself.\n /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Preferences\n /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Application Support/APPLICATION OR COMPANY NAME\n /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Caches/APPLICATION OR COMPANY NAME\n /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Documents/APPLICATION OR COMPANY NAME\n\nRarely software may also store files in the following extra folders. Be VERY CAREFUL making any changes within these folders. Make a bad decision and your Mac might not boot anymore.\n /Library/Application Support/APPLICATION OR COMPANY NAME\n /Library/Caches/APPLICATION OR COMPANY NAME\n /Library/Extensions\n /Library/LaunchAgents\n /Library/LaunchDaemons\n\nAs you can see it can be quite a lot of effort, which is why unless you are confident in what you are doing it is probably a good idea to use something like AppCleaner as recommended by Kevin in the previous answer.\n\nA: There is no registry on OS X. Related files get distributed in your user's or systems library (usually Application Support, and Preferences).\nTo completely uninstall an Application either use the official Uninstaller if the developer/company provides one or depend on external tools like AppCleaner.\n", "Q: Need to regularly check windows for changes I'm looking for a fast and reliable method to monitor changes in some windows belonging to a application.\nAfter I hit a hotkey I'd like a method to monitor those windows for a change in specific pixels, and if it detect any changes it should trigger an action (more specifically move that window to other coordinates).\nI've got a copy of Keyboard Maestro, which could be certainly a help.\nAlso GrabFS may help.\nWhat's the best way to achieve my goals?\n\nA: PixelPeeper is the only OS X app i've found that comes close to achieving this goal. Unfortunately it only watches a single pixel and has no adjustments for sensitivity.\nI too wish to find an app to monitor multiple specific regions of the screen and activate a script when significant changes occur.\n", "Q: Folders disappeared from iCloud Drive following path name change So that GNU Make could access my iCloud Drive folder, I removed the space in 'Mobile Documents'.\nSo I changed my iCloud Drive path from:\n~/Library/Mobile Documents/\n\nto\n~/Library/MobileDocuments/\n\nAs far as I can tell, my Mac has automatically re-created ~/Library/Mobile Documents/ (ie, it has re-created my iCloud Drive folder).\nOn my Mac, the only folders that are now showing in ~/Library/Mobile Documents/ are Preview, Numbers and Pages (ie osx and iOS apps).\nOn my iPhone, I can access my iCloud Drive folder in all apps, but the only apps in which files are syncing via iCloud are Preview, Numbers and Pages. In apps such as Textastic, which I only have installed on my iPhone, the files are no longer syncing via iCloud.\nAll my apps and their files that were previously in ~/Library/Mobile Documents/ are present in ~/Library/MobileDocuments/. Therefore, I tried transfering apps and their files present in ~/Library/MobileDocuments/ to ~/Library/Mobile Documents/, but my Mac said the files are all present in ~/Library/Mobile Documents/, even though they are not showing.\nCan anyone tell how I can revert my changes? Therefore, how can I have all apps and their files returned to iCloud Drive and syncing using iCloud? \n\nA: Depending on the number of files you have, iCloud Drive can take a while to get itself situated.\nI would move the files somewhere safe that is not part of iCloud and is easy to get to. Leaving them where they are should also work. Then, turn off iCloud Drive and follow all the prompts. It’ll want to “finish updating,” which you can skip. It’ll leave a folder in your home folder that’s an archive of some files it thought may not be uploaded yet.\nOnce everything is off, re-enable it. Wait until everything comes back. This can take a long time (hours) and it may look like nothing is happening. It will finish.\nOnce everything is back, make sure your data is all there and delete the old stuff.\n\nA: Doing things from the ~/Lbrary/ is dangerous, try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*I would first move all the documents from ~/Library/MobileDocuments/ to your desktop so they are no longer considered iCloud files.\n\n*Delete the ~/Library/MobileDocuments/ folder.\n\n*Delete any and all files from iCloud Drive as normal, not from the\nMobile Documents folder. \n\n*Wait a hour or so, then copy the files from your Desktop back into iCloud Drive, again, using the standard method.\n\n", "Q: What's the better way to expand my small SSD? I have a retina MBP (MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014)) with an SSD of 256GB.\nUsing it for a month or 2 now, I'm noticing that I'd like some more space (for using a Virtual Machine).\nThere isn't yet a way to upgrade the interal drive, and I've been wondering what the more efficient upgrade is: \n\n\n*\n\n*Transcend Jetdrive Lite\n(Claims Read speed of 95MB/s, Write 60MB/s)\n\n*USB3 memory stick (Bigger in physical size, smaller in disk space)\n\n*External USB3 SSD / HDD (Which is what I'd least like in physical size)\n\n\nThe ideal \"upgrade\" would be small size, so I can leave it in and forget about it, but fast enough to use for my Virtual Machines (and big enough).\nBeing a Windows developer I need to run full blown VMs. Currently I have 2 VMs on my SSD, both of which use the storage quite a lot (a server and a compile machine). I'd now like to use another VM, mostly to use as a thin-client to connect to customers' servers. This means that the third VM (the one on the extra storage) doesn't need to be as fast as an SSD, nor does it need to be as big. I think it currently sits at around 30-40GB.\nCurrently I do not know what kind of read / write speeds are enough for my thin-client VM, because it's more of a 'i'll know it when i see it' problem.\nDoes anyone have benchmarks or advice on how to proceed?\n\nA: A traditional USB flash stick will not cut it for your purposes. This is not a question of R/W speed. Regardless of the R/W speeds (I own an excellent 128GB PNY Turbo stick), the on-board controller (the microchip that serves as the brains behind the drive’s operation) is built for low-cycle I/O operations. If you plan to run virtualization software from an external drive, with portability/size being the caveat, your best bet is purchasing an mSATA-based SSD with an exclosure. \nHere’s a good image to put the size into perspective:\n\nBottom line: you won’t be able to reliably run a VM from a USB based flash drive. You need a dedicated external drive with a controller engineered to handle the operations you plan to execute.  \n\nA: I'll go for the MBP SSD replacement because it'll not void any Apple warranty (as written in this thread and the last link to Apple warranty). \nIn my case I'm working with a Samsung SSD 850 Pro 256GB and an external WD HD 500GB 5200rpm for Windows VMs.\nI'm using VMware Fusion and I'm not experiencing any kind of slow down or lag spike. \n", "Q: Can I prevent OS X from resizing and moving windows when sleeping while attached to an external monitor? I have my Retina Macbook Pro connected to a ASUS 2560x1440 display via the HDMI port. I keep the laptop lid closed so the monitor is the only display in use.\nWhen I sleep my computer (via hot corners if it matters) and wake it back up, all the windows are resized and in the upper left hand corner. My assumption is that it is resizing and repositioning them for the built in display. Is there a way to prevent this from happening so I don't have to resize and move all my windows when I use the computer again?\n\nA: Go into the menu on your external monitor. If there's an option that allows one device to toggle the power on the other via HDMI, make sure this is deselected (honestly, I don't think this will have an effect as your laptop is doing the driving, but for the sake of troubleshooting...).\nI too use an MBP Retina with external monitor (via HDMI). If I shut off the external monitor while it has application windows in its desktop, the screen on my laptop refreshes and said windows are moved to my laptop's display. However, if I power the external monitor back on, these application windows \"automagically\" move back to where they were (same location and size) on the external' Desktop (as long as I haven't shut down the computer in the meantime). So, it seems one solution (if you're hard set against also using your laptop' display) is to leave the laptop open, but decrease the brightness of the screen to 0. I do this all the time when watching a movie on the big screen, and, truly, the laptop' profile is no less \"bulky\" than it would be if it was closed. An additional benefit to this method is that the laptop stays cooler (than it otherwise would by closing it). You can verify this with any free temperature-monitoring app.\nIf the above does not work or is otherwise intolerable, I would guess that a solution could be programmed, though I'm not sure where one would start with this.\n\nA: I don't know if you can prevent it, but I use an app called Stay by Cordless Dog ($15, free trial), which keeps windows in place between display configuration changes.\n\nA: The brightness issue was a bug which was fixed in 10.15.4; the resizing and placement issue of windows is an HDMI problem and how the Mac sees it.  \nIf you have a DisplayPort, use that connection.  It solved all the problems!\n\nA: On recent versions of macOS set a user password to wake from sleep. The machine will then wake to a login screen and by the time you have entered the password, the external display will have been recognised and should then restore all the original window positions correctly.\n\nA: I had this problem for a while and tried lots of apps to fix it. Finally found a solution which was to use a HDMI to USB-C cable instead of HDMI-HDMI.\n", "Q: Can view apn but cannot change it I've been using my iphone 5C with operator Mobile Vikings (prepaid) without a problem in Belgium.

I'm using iPhoto '11 (version 9.4.3) on a Mac running (10.8.5).\nI often need to remove a lot of poor quality photos on my iPhone from within iPhoto (ex.: 50 photos to remove). I want to manage this process from within iPhoto because I have a global vision of what I'm destroying and the risk of error is lower.\nI know how to remove photos within iPhoto, and this isn't my question.\nI know that tranferred photo could be located within my library and then Photos > move to trash will really delete the selected photos.\nBut I would like to avoid the time waste and the risk of errors due to these 2 independant operations (total loss and duplicates).\n\nIs there some hidden menu entry which permit to straight forward remove a bunch of photos without transferring them?\n\nA: Perhaps not quite what you're asking, but Image Capture will quickly list the entire contents of the iPhone's library & allow single or multiple deletion [or indeed transfer] with shift/control select.\n\nA: Once you import the photos from your iPhone to the iPhoto application, iPhoto should ask if you would like to delete those photos from your device (iPhoto). \n", "Q: Terminal: limit my bandwidth Is it possible in Yosemite to limit my downloading bandwidth use to for example 300kbps using the terminal?

My only option is to restart my iPhone completely, meaning to erase all my data and media on it. I'm\nwondering if this was disconnect the service with my Verizon carrier...\n\nA: The phone is connected to Verizon via the SIM card, not the phone itself. So, no, reseting your phone will not deactivate your service.\n\nA: Nope. Your iPhone will activate itself automatically upon startup.\n\nA: for anyone who reads this and has a problem where their phone does deactivate the carrier you can still have it reactivated and keep the same number.  they cannot give your number to anyone else for 60 days after deactivation of service.\n\nA: The other two answers are false when restoring my old iPhone once it did deactivate it. My carrier advised I had to call to reactivate it. Take it to the Apple Store if you really need it restored it sounds like the part that reads the memory storage has gone wonky.

The only option you have is to disconnect your device(s) from iCloud and just stop using it unfortunately.\nThe reason you provide for not using the iCloud account though is because of bombardment of emails from services you have subscribed to.  I suggest a 'block sender' use on your email client whatever that may be, or alternatively the option suggested by @patrix.

What I'd like to learn how to do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*get the cursor in the search field, then use up down arrows with enter to select the right note\n\n*it would be great to also cycle through notes with the keyboard, similar to cmd+shift+[ and cmd+shift+] in Chrome\n\n\nHow can I learn to do these things?\n\nA: The app I use for this is CheatSheet  since some shortcuts come from the system (screen shot, etc..), some come from third party apps, and some are from the app itself.\nI count 51 keys active in Notes on my Mac, so I'm not going to list them all. Yours are probably different than mine, since I have third party apps that have services with default keys enabled.\nThe movement request is best served by Mouse Keys - which came from X11 days and has been chosen/implemented as Apple's accessibility solution for using a number pad instead of the mouse/trackpad for you to navigate to the search field. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/accessibility/osx/\n\n*http://www.mediaatelier.com/CheatSheet/\n\nA: *\n\n*to get the cursor on the search bar you can press the 'Note List Search...' shortcut (cmd+option+f)\n\n*to focus on the Notes list, you can go to the search bar first by pressing cmd+option+f, and then press tab.

After installing NTFS write software on my mac, I found two problems.\n\n\n*\n\n*The Windows system in bootcamp does not show in the startup disk in Settings app.\n\n*Parallels Desktop can't suspend the Bootcamp virtual machine because such software installed.\nBoth the problems can be solved by removing the software.\nWhat's the reason behind this?\n\nA: You do not mention what software you're using to mount the NTFS volume read/write in OS X, nor which version of Parallels you're using, nor do you say what model Mac you have.  This is important to give you accurate information.\nParagon NTFS works with Parallels just fine.  MacFUSE or other NTFS read/write utilities do not.  Also, Parallels 8 and lower have issues with Paragon HFS if you have that installed on the Windows side.\nAlso, you should never suspend the Parallels Boot Camp VM.  If you attempt to boot to Windows via Boot Camp while the Parallels VM is suspended, you can cause data corruption.\n\nA: I will conjecture here; feel free to downvote if you think I'm completely off-base:\nPerhaps the NTFS utility puts the NTFS volume \"in use\". That is, other OS's try to access the disk but they can tell MacFUSE is already using the disk (or so they think). They're programmed to not interfere with other disk operations so they take a 'hands off' attitude so as to prevent data corruption that would result if two systems tried to write the same data at the same time.\nAs to why MacFUSE would leave the disk busy when it's not even using it (or running), that would be a question for the developers.\n", "Q: Using HD monitor with 2011 Apple Macbook Pro I was wondering if I can set up my laptop with a HD monitor. My computer is a 2011 Macbook Pro and doesn't have HDMI output, but it has the Thunderbolt one. \nDo I just need to get a Thunderbolt cord and plug that into the monitor? Will it work if the monitor is a HD one? \n\nA: Your machine will support up to 2560x1600 on an external monitor.\nHowever, using a converter thunderbolt to HDMI will output max of 1920x1080. If the monitor you are planning to connect to your laptop is HD(720p) or Full HD (1080p) then you are good to go and can use a converter thunderbolt to HDMI. If the monitor's resolution is higher than 1080p then you will need a minidisplay port to display port adapter(mini display port is the same thing as thunderbolt, but it is cheaper to find it looking for a mini display port). Make sure that the monitor has a display port, otherwise you will need to use dual DVI cable with an apple adapter, which is well overpriced and may be considered as an overkill.

I make intensive use of Office autocorrect feature for fast typing (which I use as a kind of autocompletion - shorthand / stenography). I have been able to modify the ACL file for Office 2011 applications (which works great in Word), but Office 365 comes with a separate 2015 version of Outlook and I cannot find the dedicated file for autocorrect entries.\nAfter a few tests, I found out that Outlook does take the Mac OS system dictionary entries into account (which are stored in an .sqlite file in /Library/Dictionaries/CoreDataUbiquitySupport/username/UserDictionary/local/store/UserDictionary.db - in case you're wondering where it was...). So I have been able to add my own dictionary entries in this sqlite file and Outlook does take them into account. Heck, Outlook gets real slow when this system dictionary is fed with more than 3000 entries (I bet you're wondering wtf is in this list, never mind).\nLuckily, I found out that Outlook's Autocorrect feature also uses its own set of entries (which can be manually updated through Outlook Preferences > Autocorrect) - these work better and faster.

As far as I understand this is something that the referrer should join and then I would not have much control over it.\n\nA: The iTunes Affiliate Program will get you a bit closer to understanding the marketing of your book but unfortunately it's not a silver bullet.  \n1.) To see the clicks that are generated on links to your book those other properties will need to use YOUR affiliate links.  Anyone using their affiliate links or a raw iTunes / iBooks link won't provide you with any insight.  \n2.) You won't be able to attribute which clicks / referrers actually resulted in sales of your specific books.  iTunes reports back affiliate sales at a category level, not a product level.  \n3.) iTunes Affiliate links are only active for 24 hours (or until the user clicks another affiliate links).

I've tried everything with keychain, and I can't get it to just leave me alone. It pops up and says it can't find a keychain to store something, giving me choices like \"cancel\" or \"reset to defaults\".\nIf I try \"cancel\", the same dialogue box pops up immediately. If I try \"reset to defaults\" it asks for my login password.

A very good mail client, btw.\n\nA: Depending on how simple you need your notes, flags might cover what you need.\nApple Mail allows you to put a colored flag on your mail by right-clicking it (you can add it to the menu bar as well). As soon as you start flagging mails there will be a view besides/under your inbox which organizes them by the different flags.\n\nA: Just found Nylas N1, an email client built open source and web-based. Has already a tagging feature and more but you can easily extend anything you want with JS-Skills. In future there should be a plugin for everything.\n", "Q: Why won't iBooks wirelessly sync epubs or PDFs to my iPad? I'm aware of this question but it is now quite old. If I create a collection in iBooks on OSX (Yosemite, 10.10.3) and add a book (epub - not puchased via iBooks), it does not sync to my iPad (3rd gen, iOS 8.2) over wifi. The name of the collection itself is synced to the iPad but it is empty. Both devices are on the same wireless LAN and connected to the internet.\nI believe syncing used to be via iTunes and this was the only way I could get books to sync to my iPad previously but this should now work using only iBooks. I have already performed the 'Move books from iTunes' operation from the iBooks menu on OSX.\n'Sync Collections' is switched on in the iPad iBooks settings. I'm looking for a wireless solution, not USB sync.\n\nA: I don't know if you still need this issued solved, but I struggled a lot to sync my ePubs (not bought through Apple) between my Apple Devices.\nHere is the solution I've come up with (This can be done on both OSX or iOS):\n\n\n*\n\n*Save your ePub/PDF file on iCloud Drive (inside a folder, just for organizational purposes);\n\n*Then open that file from the iCloud Drive folder into iBooks.\n\n\nThis way, the instance  of your ePub/PDF will be the same running on both your iDevice iBooks and your Mac iBooks. \nAll changes that you make (add bookmarks, highlights and current page) will also sync.\nRegarding your collections, they will behave as they should syncing normally between devices.\n\nA: I had this issue before when moving over to iBooks app entirely. What resolved this for me was \"Authorize Computer\" within iBooks via \"Store>Authorize Computer\" in the menu (which for some odd reason wasn't authorized) and all the content(iBooks purchased and third party epubs) I had synced on iBooks started synching to my iPhone/iPad.\nLet me know if that worked for you.\n\nA: I noticed a (not-bought-through-Apple) ePub missing from my iPad after upgrading to Yosemite.\nI solved this by selecting it in iTunes (on the Mac) > iPad > Books* > Sync Books. Then sync the iPad (I use USB, but I expect wi-fi sync would work). That's with \"Selected books\" chosen at the top. Choosing \"All books\" should work too.\n*the \"Books\" under \"Settings,\" not under \"On My Device\". \nApple support article on syncing PDFs which works for ePub.\n\nA: Try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update to OS X El Capitan 10.11.4, it adds the ability to store PDFs in the iCloud  for iBooks (Official Changelog)\n\n*Sync iBooks via iCloud\n\n\nIf that doesn't work:\n\n\n*Update iOS on your iPad and try again.\n\n", "Q: Post-boot and login notification I am using 10.10.2 and I have limited experience with Terminal. I would like to create a script which would notify me (on screen) when all of the startup processes are completed, post-login. The boot process on my MBP (mid-2012) is not excessive but I would like to know when the OS is ready to start an application through the dock or other means, e.g. a notification which flashes Ready as a notification: maybe by detecting a certain percentage of CPU idleness? \nAre there any simple guides available or can someone direct me to an online resource that could provide a guide to a script that might do that?\n\nA: For OS X system files you cant not determine the end since it keeps working, but if you have start up apps you can do it for those.\nFor the OS X you could use the first phase of boot process.\nit is indicated in the Console as bootlog[0]: BOOT_TIME 1428512373 0\nAfter that the OSX is running mostly customization, like finding and connecting to your network ect..\nOr you could move to next stage in the process and monitor the WiFi connection...and so on.\nYou could use something like this to Monitor Console automatically in Terminal and make sound if certain message comes.\nsyslog -w|while read l;do [[ $l = *'message text'* ]]&&afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Blow.aiff;done\n\nReplace \"message text\" with what you want from the Console log as your trigger.\n\nA: The Dock should be ready to take commands (e.g. mouse-clicks) as soon as it shows.\nIf you are keen to know what is going on at login, you could add Activity Monitor to your login items and monitor CPU and disk activity as well as \"task build-up\" (like seeing what tasks are popping in to the list).\nAnother approach would be to kick off the start process of login items using a script. I did this once with an AppleScript to make sure applications a) started in a specific order, and b) more importantly not all at once but with a delay in between each of them. If you want to do this, all included login items with the exception of your script itself needs to be removed from the login items in System Preferences.\nFor AppleScript the language guide can be found here.\n", "Q: Strange behavior within MS Word: using Command-Shift-L launches Safari sometimes It seems that Command-Shift-L were tied to safari. It is however also tied to \"create bulleted list\" in Word - which is an action I happen to (want to) do frequently.\nHow does one change or disable the built-in shortcuts for apps (in this case safari) ?\nUpdate  I found the following under system preferences | keyboard |shortcuts|apps\n\nBut as you can see there is nothing specific to Safari here.\nAnother update I just closed down Word and opened it up. The behavior seems to have been fixed: bullets are now appearing.  It is very strange that the given key combo had been consistently and repeatably redirecting to safari before Word was restarted.\nYet another update  This behavior recurs - even after restarting Word. The shortcut works a few times, then a bit later - and I do not understand what triggers the change in behavior - the shortcut changes behavior to launching Safari   Just have no idea what is happening here.\n\nA: The issue was a bit difficult to find: that shortcut is linked to \"Search with Google\".  But the result is that Safari is launched - with whatever is in the clipboard as the search query to google. \n\nThe resolution is to uncheck the \"Search with Google\" checkbox in the services | shortcuts | searching area.  Afterwards the Mac shortcut for bulleted paragraph works properly (and always)\n\nA: When Word is the frontmost application, all keyboard shortcuts are sent to it. Therefore ⇧⌘L will create a bulleted list before any other action that is set to it.\n⇧⌘L is not a standard keyboard shortcut for Safari, therefore you need to look for whatever app has set up this keyboard shortcut to override Word.\n", "Q: Disabling app updates I have iOS 8.2 running on my iPod Touch (7); and since I downloaded iOS 8, all of my apps update automatically.

I just noticed a thing called \"Hazel\" has appeared in my System Preferences. I've no idea what it is or how it got there.\nWhen I googled hazel mac, it looks like it's a popular app with glowing reviews...\nSo how did it appear on my computer? I'm a developer and I like to think I'm usually pretty good at avoiding drive-by installations of crapware on my computer...\nHas anyone else had this happen?\n\nUPDATE\nIt was me being stupid. It looks like I installed it myself via Homebrew Cask when I ran a bunch of slapdash copy+paste commands when setting up my machine.\nBy the way, I emailed Hazel support while I was trying to work this out, the developer emailed me straight back; can confirm Hazel is reputable :)\n\nA: It's extremely unlikely to be malware as the Hazel program is a reputable utility that automates file actions by extending spotlight and file change detection systems of OS X. It does exist as a System Preference panel, so you could easily miss it's footprint on disk if it were not for the menu bar icon.\nYou can get updated versions and uninstall info from the vendor:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php\nIf you have Time Machine, you can use spotlight to determine pretty much precisely when it appeared.\nNow, with the NSA and hackers and all sorts of people making software modifications and using back doors, your installation of hazel could be malware masquerading as an honest program. Without forensic analysis - it's hard to know. I'd start with reinstalling the latest version and doing a sanity check to make sure you're happy with it.

Whenever I send her a message using a device other than my iphone and I type in her email address will she still get it on her iphone or will it only go to her email account?\n\nA: iMessage is a service from Apple which works from iOS devices and Macs with OS X 10.8 and later only and is using the device's data connection rather than the regular phone connection.\nUsing the e-mail address with another device's text messaging system will most-likely result into an error telling you that the e-mail address entered is an invalid phone number.\nSending a message with ANY device as regular e-mail will result into your friend receiving the message as e-mail instead of an iMessage.\n", "Q: Dictation with browser : have Mac Book Pro speak out web pages Can I use dictation to have Firefox/ Safari to read me pages? \nUsing a MacBook Pro - OS X 10.9.4\n\nA: In Safari: \nMark text, secondary click (aka right-click), speech.\nAlternatively it's also in the edit menu.\nSettings can be adjusted in System Preferences -> Speech\n\nA: Another way though Safari is good most cases (copy paste URL if its not your preferred browser and you just want a few pages read aloud):\nAs did copying to Text Edit, after removing formatting  (In text edit can use Menu Format / Make Plain text or paste to text wrangler and then copy afresh and paste to Text edit.)\n", "Q: Changing Calculator Format I am using a Mac computer, and my calculator looks like the one below.

Running kextstat | grep realtek returns the following:\ncom.realtek.driver.AppleRTL815XEthernet (1.0.15)\n\nWhenever I opened Chrome (right now at v54), a few moments later I would consistently get a kernel panic, so I stopped using my USB hub altogether. Then I happened upon a weird Chrome feature called Web USB.\nchrome://flags/#enable-webusb\nBy disabling the Web USB feature, the kernel panics have vanished.\n\nA: It is definitely the Realtek driver; I've had the same problem with the same driver version (1.0.8) and the same Anker hub on my 2012 Macbook Air. The kernel panics seem to be triggered by any significant network IO. So it'll work for web browsing for a while, but as soon as you transfer a large file or start a download it's game over. As of now that is the latest version so the only fix is to remove the kernel extension. There is no uninstaller so you need to do that manually.\nIf you go to /System/Library/Extensions/IONetworkingFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/ you will see two files named AppleRTL815XEthernet109.kext and AppleRTL815XComposite109.kext. Delete both of those (with rm or,  if you use the Finder, make sure you empty your trash).\nAfter that, clear your Kernel cache and reboot, then you should be free of kernel panics:\nsudo rm -rf /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kext.caches\n\nUnfortunately the ethernet performance without the driver seems to be pretty terrible - in my case, worse than wi-fi, rendering the hardware pointless. Hopefully an updated driver will be released at some point.\n\nA: I installed the the Realtek driver v1.0.16 (white Anker AH212) and experienced a Kernel Panic. Rebooted, and the system still wouldn't leverage the ethernet part of the adapter. I ran the uninstaller, and noticed that it could not delete the drivers from the PlugIns directory. I reinstalled, and that the drivers were not installed there. However, the .kext dirs did exist in /Library/Extensions.\nI copied the files from /Library/Extensions to the PlugIns directory like so:\ncd /System/Library/Extensions/IONetworkingFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/\ncp -a  /Library/Extensions/AppleRTL815X* ./\n\nand did the Google Chrome flags fix from above, then rebooted. No kernel panic after that and ethernet seems to work.\n", "Q: How to create a bash alias on OS X?

That will delete all locally stored photos and albums (other than the camera roll).\nAlso, you might update to iOS 8.3 which allows you to manage your entire Photo Library in the cloud in which case you can delete the offending photos and albums using a web browser on any computer or iOS device that's linked to your AppleID for Photos app.\n\nA: I had this problem, and it was driving me insane. In the end, I was able to delete the photos using iFunBox, which allows you to browse the phone's filesystem and delete files directly. Choose \"Raw File System\" in the sidebar (use the \"List\" view for easier navigation), and look through the phone for the photos. In my case, I deleted all the directories under PhotoData/Sync and under PhotoData/Thumbnails/V2/PhotoData/Sync.

Has anyone found/created a working solution for searching inside Google Docs using Spotlight (their contents, not just their names)? \nPrecipitate used to provide this functionality, but unfortunately no longer works and is no longer maintained.\n\nA: I used a version of the answer supplied here with sudo mdutil -E /Volumes/[DriveName] but first I had to make sure the Google Drive was mounted.  So I did this:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.google.drivefs.settings DefaultMountPoint '~/GoogleDrive'\n\nSource: Configure Drive File Stream\nIt's very important that you don't put a space between Google Drive, as shown in the Google support column, because Terminal takes this as a hard return when entering the index command.\nThen restart the Mac so the Google Drive is mounted as GoogleDrive, then:\nsudo mdutil -E \n\nSource: Terminal 101: Rebuild the Spotlight Index On the Fly\n\nA: I don't believe that Spotlight is technically able to index the content inside the Google Drive files, at least not files that were created from within Google Drive's web interface. For example, if I go to drive.google.com and create a new file (e.g. a Document) and insert some content (text) in the document, that new file representing that document will show up in my Mac's directory (i.e. /Users/myname/Google Drive/filename.gdoc). However if I take that file and open it in a text editor, I can see that the only content in the file is a link to the online file and some other information. The actual content of the google document is not in the file that's on my computer. Since the content of the document isn't in the file that's on my computer, there's nothing for Spotlight to index.\nI think this is really unfortunate. The idea that I could use Spotlight to search through all of the files that I created online is really great, but it appears that Google Drive isn't downloading the content of the files, so there is nothing for Spotlight to index. As you noted Precipitate provided that functionality, but it doesn't work any more and it's no longer developed.\nOne non-spotlight alternative is to use the app Alfred to search:\nGoogle Drive Search with Alfred App\nAll this really is is a shortcut to open your google drive in a web browser and initiate a search- not really what you (or I) want.\nThere is also an app called Found that is able to search Google Drive, but that company was purchased and the app is no longer being developed. I haven't tried the most recent version (which is from 2013), and the reviews on macupdate.com are mixed about its current functionality, but it might be worth a try.\n\nA: I was confused at first because Spotlight didn't index that drive. However once I forced it to then I was able to search just fine. You can rebuild the index for a specific drive by following this tutorial.\n\nsudo mdutil -E /Volumes/[DriveName]\n\n\nhttp://www.techradar.com/how-to/computing/apple/terminal-101-rebuild-the-spotlight-index-on-the-fly-1305684 \n\nA: There is a way.  It is not pretty.\nUse an app such as CloudPull that backs up Google Documents to your local drive.  Then Spotlight will find the local copy.  That gives you the name of the found file.\nUse Google Drive to back up the shortcuts to the Google Documents that open the real document at Google.\nUse Spotlight to search for the content you want, then take the found name and search for that to find the Google Documents shortcut and open that, in order to open the document at Google.\n\nA: This happens automatically for any Google Drive folders/files you have synced locally using the GD app, because the files technically are on your system. The Spotlight results then become hyperlinks to the online Drive file, opening in your browser. \nJust make sure anything you want to be able to search this way is saved in \"My Drive\" and that you have that, or whatever sub-folders you designate, syncing to your local directory.\n\nA: TLDR: Spotlight indexing on Apple Silicon is not supported.\nThe answer below is from Google's documentation for Known Issues Spotlight in Google Drive for Desktop:\n\nSpotlight—Drive for desktop versions later than version 47 don’t support Apple Spotlight indexing on Apple silicon devices, on macOS Monterey or later, or for Gmail accounts. You can use the integrated Google Drive search released in version 55 to search for files.\nWorkaround: For Google Workspace users there is a convenient search (magnifying glass) on the top menu bar when you click on the Google Drive icon.\n\n\nA: If you are willing to try a Spotlight alternative, namely Alfred, you are good to go. \nAlfred is technically a launcher/file-searcher, but it is capable of much more thanks to workflows. Without going into much detail it works basically as Spotlight: after a keyboard stroke you get a rectangle in the middle of the screen, where you can type your search query, and you get answers (much faster than Spotlight). There are really good tutorials for it, at the developers' website, and the learning curve is very shallow. To use workflows you need the Powerpack option which is not-free-of-charge (Alfred is), but I highly recommend this on time purchase.\nAlfred uses the Spotlight index database to execute document searches. But I have found - and Oh man I've tried - that Spotlight is very unreliable working with network drives. And even if you mount google drive with CloudMounter or Mountainduck etc. you can not index it. (You can index a mounted network drive on the local network, but I only now a temporary solution. )\nBUT Alfred, fortunately, can do a lot with workflows. And there is a workflow for google drive search. You can download it here. It is not a workaround, it is a native solution. \nSimply double-click on the google_drive.alfredworkflow file, and add it to Alfred. You will be asked probably to update it, but once you are done, you can search your google drive files in the Alfred window typing the letter d and the search term. You will see the hits in a dropdown list, you can select them, and they will open in the browser. It is lightning quick.\n\nA: The latest versions of Google Drive for desktop include Spotlight integration, which supports both name & content indexing. It seems to be disabled by default for some unknown reason, so check your Google Drive preferences.\n", "Q: Preferences Error on IMac Yosemite 10.10.2 Preferences app launches fine and all but one prefs pane work well -- the Desktop & Screen Saver preference pane yields the following message:\n\"Preferences Error.

If your external IP is dynamic (regularly changing), I'd recommend using a service like dyndns (which keeps track of your IP and binds it to a domain). \n", "Q: password built in an app for restricted download?

But I'm not sure that it's possible to do this. I hope my question is now clearer. Thank you.\n\nA: You will have a very hard time getting the app approved is my guess, but you can always try.\nIt's not clear why you aren't using the newsstand functionality - and that will certainly be on the reviewer's mind when they are deciding if the app store needs another app added to the pile.\nTechnically, you can offer apps that require payment - see HBO Go, various major league baseball apps, but they all either have a free period to explore the paid content or significant free capabilities to justify being available on the app store.\nUnless you can show huge value to some people, you'll be facing a hard sell once it's time to get it past review. If you can, start by submitting a test app to the beta testing review using Test Flight. That will only cost you $100 and the time to develop the initial version of the app.\nFrom there you will have a dialog with the review team to judge if or how they will respond to your specific app.\nAll the above goes out the window if you are selling the app B2B and your purchasers are only VPP businesses.

Specifically, for about five seconds, the screen dims but does not turn off and the backlight on the keys remains on, and then the computer turns off. When I turn the computer on, I have to select the user, enter the password, and login, after which applications start normally. There does not seem to be a pattern to when it will crash. It has crashed less than a minute after restarting, during Internet browsing, and while using R Studio (for statistical analysis). It seems to crash more frequently when it is not connected to the power supply, but it also crashes when it is connected to the power supply.\nTo troubleshoot, I deleted applications that were in preview (Microsoft Office 2016 and R Studio 0.99), updated all applications and deleted one I recently installed (Fantastical), and ensured the operating system was updated to OSX 10.10.2.

Any advice or direction outside of third party solutions would be very helpful and appreciated. \nThank you, \n\n\nA: I was having this exact same issue all night and wasted a good 3 hours troubleshooting it.  I didn't have to go through all of the steps that the other answer provided, but my fix was simply deleting my existing XCode from /Applications using an app called AppZapper (the OS X equivalent of Revo Uninstaller for Windows).\nAppZapper makes sure to delete all of the other files associated with the application you are trying to remove.  You have to select a checkbox in the preferences in order to be able to delete Apple applications, but as soon as I zapped my existing XCode and emptied the Trash, the new XCode immediately started downloading from the Mac App Store.\n\nA: Just managed to get it downloading by requesting the web version (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12) of the app store to trigger an external request (press allow).\nOn that \"page\" in the app store (where you may see screenshots of xcode) a button should also state \"Update\". And pressing that update button worked - different than the button in the \"Updates\"-Section posted by OP.\nDon't know why, but saved me a ton of time not having to remove everything and redownloading.\n\nA: I had this problem.  The issue was I had two copies of Xcode.  I had recently upgraded to a new drive and had the old one mounted to copy things over.  Xcode in /Applications was updated, but the one in /Volumes/OldDrive/Applications was not.  After unmounting the old drive and relaunching App Store the update went away.\nTo look for other versions of Xcode, open Spotlight, search for Xcode and wait a moment for the full Spotlight search to open up.  If there's a list of Applications right below the Top Hit that may be your problem.  Also check in /Developers/Applications.\nIf that doesn't work, try resetting the iTunes Store cache.  Quit the App Store, open iTunes, and in Preferences -> Advanced and click Reset iTunes Store cache.  Then reopen the App Store.\nFinally, try Cmd-R in the App Store to refresh the Updates page.\n\nA: I was able to fix this problem by correcting the permissions for Xcode.

When opening a folder, even a simple one, it takes seconds (from a few to some dozens) to display its content.\nOne MacBook Pro, 2011 non-retina, has a normal spinning hard drive: it takes ages for the Finder to display the files in a folder. Even if there are only a bunch of them, the spinning wheel stays spinning for too long. At the beginning I thought I had a faulty HD, but...\n... the other MacBook Pro, even if a little dated (2008, the first unibody),  has an SSD hard drive. It was incredibly fast with Mavericks, overall slow on Yosemite. However, also on this computer the Finder spins the wheel for a very long time.\nBoth the computers were upgraded to Yosemite, none had a fresh installation of the OS. For me, Yosemite was like Vista for Windows users: perfectly usable computers became sluggish. I can live with a little slow MBP, but I cannot wait seconds each time I open a folder.\nIs there anyone who had the same problem and could suggest a solution? \n\nA: Speed Up New Finder Window Generation by Changing All My Files\nAll My Files is a smart folder that uses Spotlight to access any and all files owned by the current user.

Our daughter has an old MacBook Air (2010 model) that worked fine until a few recent OS upgrades. Now it's almost unusable with its 2GB RAM that can't be upgraded, so she is considering cleaning her MBA and reinstalling an old OS.\nI wonder whether this is going to work smoothly in relation to apps she was using. Will the apps she will install from AppStore require her to upgrade the operating system?\n\nA: Minimal OS version requirements vary from application to application, so there is no general yes or no. The minimal OS version is part of the application description in the store though, so the best approach here would be for your daugther to look at her key applications in the store and check whether all of them will work with earlier OS versions as well.\n", "Q: how to connect 3 dell non-thunderbolt displays to a 2014 15\" macbook pro so i have three 'standard' 24\" Dell displays (1920x1280 resolution). they have hdmi, display port (normal) and vga. i would like to connect all three of them to my new macbook pro 15\".\ni think i could get two mini displayport to (full) displayport cables, and connect two of the monitors this way; and the third via hdmi.\nhowever, i would also like to make use of a gigE ethernet card. i suppose i could get a usb<->ethernet adapter.\nbut, i would very much like to minimize cabling as much as possible.\nis there a docking solution out there that can, say, enable one thunderbolt connection to all three Dell monitors?

You will need 3x miniDP to DP cables for your Dell monitors.\nYou will then need to pick-up a USB 3.0 network adapter which will support Full Duplex 2Gbps to complete your set-up as described.\nUnfortunately if you want to cut down on cabling you will need to spend some cash on getting Thunderbolt enabled monitors, which are nice, but overpriced.\n", "Q: How to downgrade the OS to the original one on a MBA 2010? Continuing the thread about whether it's worth downgrading the OS on an  old MBA Late '10, I'd like to check the downgrade options.\nI am not sure my daughter still has an original CD with the OS. I assume not. And she has not been using TimeMachine. So what she can actually do to install the original OS?\n\nA: The MacBook Air came pre-installed with Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, which was available with a physical installation media only.\nHere is what I would do in your situation:\nParts Replacement (USB Key Installation Media):\nContact Apple and ask if they still replace the missing parts (costs will apply, but I do not know how much).\n\nOrder a Replacement Disc:\nAsk, if they still sell replacement discs.  The costs were reasonable the last time I heard (~$15-20).\nNOTE: The MBA being a Late 2010 may require an installation media unique to its build.  So a general-purpose replacement disc of Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard may not work with it.  Ask Apple specifically if it works with your daughter's model before you decide to buy it.\nCreate a USB Thumb Drive from a Replacement Disc:\nShould the general-purpose disc work, knowing that the MBA does not have an optical drive, if you have a different Mac with an optical drive, you can create a USB drive from it by just cloning it over using Disk Utility.\nBuying an Optical Drive to Use Disc:\nIf creating the USB thumb drive is not an option for you, you may want to look into buying an optical drive and use that with the disc (obviously only if the general-purpose disc is an option in the first place).  The optical drive can be used for other things as well and even used with a potential new Mac computer lacking an optical drive.  So, the costs of $79 for the drive would not be wasted for a single purpose.\n\nA: Have you attempted to use the OSX recovery utility or tried to do an SMC reset?\nAn SMC reset may solve the issues that she's having but you've regretfully not told us about.

I develop iOS apps. Of late I have been running out of space. I delete as much as I can and the space keeps filling up. I have an external drive that I can move thing to. So I moved a bunch of stuff last night so I had 8 GB free and tried to do the update. In the morning it said the update failed because I don't have enough space (400 MB available). I deleted Xcode 4 which freed up 10 GB of space. Immediately the available space started to drop and now it is down to 8 GB. The only thing that seems to be running is Application update. \nQuestion: When an application update fails does it keep the space it is using? That is, do I have many copies of multi-GB partial downloads of xcode hidden somewhere on my disk? if so, where?\n\nA: There's a possibility that it's Time Machine local storage; though I'd use something like GrandPerspective to see what is taking up the most space.\nIf it is local backups...\nDisable Time Machine Local Backup Storage\nHere’s how to turn off local backups:  \nLaunch Terminal from /Applications/Utilities\nEnter the following command:\nsudo tmutil disablelocal \nEnter the admin password when requested to disable local backups\nRe-Enable Local Time Machine Backups\nsudo tmutil enablelocal\nRemember, if you disable this feature you will not have local backups anymore, so if something goes wrong you will be out of luck.

From Jason Snell at Six Colors (emphasis mine):\n\nMac users are probably more familiar with the concept of soft links, also known as “symbolic links.” Mac users would recognize the idea of a soft link from the long-time Mac concept of aliases. In both of these cases, there’s something that looks like a file or folder/directory that’s actually just a reference to the real version of that file somewhere else in the filesystem.\nHard links aren’t like that. The best way to think of a hard link is that the contents of a file appear to exist in more than one location. If a file has two hard links, and you delete one, the file isn’t deleted—because it’s still linked to from another location.\nThat’s what the iPhoto import inside Photos does: It creates hard links to the contents of your iPhoto library inside the Photos library. If you delete your iPhoto library, the files that were hard-linked from the Photos library still exist in the Photos library and aren’t deleted. For Mac users used to the a-file-is-a-file approach of the Finder, it’s a bit of a head-scratcher.\n\nSince iPhoto's library gets frozen when you import it into Photos (i.e. further changes don't get synced), you can safely delete it: you won't have neither more nor less space then before. \nEDIT: You can also check out this answer: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/180313/10159\n\nA: I already deleted my iPhoto libraries and everything looks OK. As already reported, there is no disk space gains doing that but I like to keep everything clean.\nStill not so comfortable with Photos but it has potential to improve.\n\nA: I'd say stick to the iPhoto Library if that's the app you're going to continue using for now.\nWhen you eventually swap to Photos, do the import again.\nThe Photos Library is greyed out if you attempt to open it from iPhoto. Any changes you make to the iPhoto Library will not be reflected in the Photos Library, meaning you'll gradually go out of sync until such time as iPhoto no longer works (OS X 10.11, who knows?) & you'll need to reimport at that time.\nPhotos Library Storage Space\nThe Photos Library is actually just a collection of hard links to the actual data on the disk & therefore is not taking up anything like the amount of space that Finder is reporting.  \nMore on hard links from Ars Technica:\n\nA hard link is simply a reference to some data on disk. Think of a file as a combination of a name and a pointer to some data. Deleting a file really means deleting the name portion of that duo. When there are no more names pointing to a particular piece of data disk, then that disk space can be reused.\"\n\nThis means that so long as one of the pointers to the data still exists, the data is still in use. Only by deleting both will the data actually be deleted.\nRef: Apple KB - Photos saves disk space by sharing images with your iPhoto or Aperture libraries\n\nA: The easiest way to test this is to back up one of the library files onto an external drive, then delete it off the main drive.  Then look at whether your disk usage went down or not.  In my case, I like Photos, and am done with iPhoto.  However, if hard links are used, I am worried the new Photos library will break when the old iPhoto library is deleted.  I had 2 30GB libraries.\nSo, I tried it.  Deleting the old iPhoto library did not save me 30GB.  It did save me about 4GB.  So the disk space reported is not accurate, even if you're using Omni DiskSweeper to measure it.  But nothing bad happened.  All my photos are intact in the new Photos software.\n\nA: absolutely takes up double the space. My get info shows this. I called Apple and they said 'ignore get info'. Well, I can't ignore that my hard drive has less space on it!!!! This is so frustrating. \n\nA: It looks double space to me too. I'd be careful to delete anything before i absolutely sure if it is not double space, or, which library is the real one or a linked one. \n\nA: For me it did use twice the disk space (had 12GB free before the import and less than 2 right after, also Disk Inventory X confirmed that). Deleting iPhoto library returned the free space.\n", "Q: Installing SSD using time machine & external hard drive I am wondering if someone could help me with the following:\nI have a 15\" macbook pro late 2011 and I am trying to find a way of changing to an SSD.

The 4th generation Time Capsule has a security slot at the far right of the back panel:\n\nHowever, the manual does not mention what kind of lock I can attach to it.\nWhat locks are compatible? For instance, does the Kensington MicroSaver work?\n\nA: Yup, that's a Kensington slot and the product you linked will work and is on the high end in price and fit/finish. Anything compatible will work - you can open http://amazon.com and then search for \"kensington type laptop lock\" for dozens of vendors at various price points and key/cable configurations.\n\nA: The slot is a standard Kensington compatible lock style slot, or t-bar lock. All Kensington Locks will work with this slot, including the Microsaver line.\nKensington offers a smaller lock as well, reserved for tablets and ultrabooks, whose slot is less than 12mm. This uses a different attachment mechanism, but whose mechanism (Cleat) is backwardly compatible with the original slot.\n", "Q: Hard Drive not working with VirtualBox on Mac OS X 10.10.2 Basically, \nI have a Seagate Expansion Drive (1TB), I have ejected it from my MacBook and mounted it into the guest virtual machine, it comes up with the message:\n\nThis USB device can perform faster if you connect it to a Hi-Speed USB 2.0 port.\n\nas if it were recognized, and then when I go to Devices and Printers, the Hard Drive is in the \"Unspecified\" section, and has a warning sign next to it, I click on it and then it says it needs troubleshooting, I go through the troubleshooting process, and it says that I need to re-install the device driver, so I click \"apply\", and it searches for a driver, and then it shows that it's installing the device driver software and it comes up with:\n\nDevice driver software was not successfully installed\n\nIt says the hard drive has a driver problem, when I have been using it fine on OS X?\n\nA: Windows 7 does not natively support USB 3.0, which is what the Seagate® Expansion Desktop 1TB USB Drive - Specs interface is.

After installing Apple Photos as part of the 10.10.3 update and attempting to migrate my Aperture library I get an error message about \"permissions\" on my Aperture library:\n\nWhat does this mean and why is it happening?\n\nA: Apple often uses custom permissions to prevent users from going inside library files and deleting files that need to be in place since they are thumbnails and/or database files or referenced in database files.\nHere's an official knowledge base article on the permissions required and steps to fix it.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204484\nReading your alert, the step is probably precautionary to ensure that all the files are readable and ready to transfer.\nYou can check the locking with Finder - select the Aperture Library and choose File -> Get Info. Observe the locked button and expand the Sharing & Permissions portion if needed. You probably need Read & Write permission on the folder and all it's contents.

I then went to my settings and my non-existent 'photos' are taking up 3.1 GB of my storage. I don't understand.\n\nA: This may have been caused by a bug in iOS 8.

Is it possible to delete a file from a folder via the Dock? I know I can drag the file to the Trashcan but I'm curious if there is some key combination perhaps that I can use to click on a file via the Dock Grid and delete it quickly and without closing that Folder in the Dock.\n\nA: I'm assuming you're taking about either the grid or fan-out folder on the doc (e.g. documents)? I don't believe you can use the keyboard to select files on the fan-out display (haven't tried it) and thus you'd be limited to the mouse drag method you mention.\nFor the grid display, you can select files with the arrow keys. However, I would imagine that if it was supported, it would be Command-Backspace (the delete key at the top right of the main keyboard region, not the individual one under the 'insert' key). At least, that would be consistent with the keyboard shortcut for the Finder.\n", "Q: Can I delete my local photo library now that all my photos are on iCloud? I updated to the new OS X last night and uploaded my 70gigs worth of photos to iCloud. I plan on doing a backup on my raid as well, just to be safe, but am I okay to delete all my photos that are stored locally on my computer?\n\nA: Yes - if you trust Apple to never lose the photos, you can delete all your local copies.\nPay attention to which devices have full resolution images and which have \"optimized\" settings.\nAlso, I've been doing this for iTunes Match for some time. I have only lost a few dozen songs in two years of trusting the cloud. For that reason, I now set alarms every 6 months to download a local copy of all the songs from iCloud and back that up to an external HD. I'll be doing the same with my iCloud photo library to be sure I never lose all the photos.\nI would add, that if the thought of losing a dozen photos or having to wait several weeks if your account should get messed up for engineering to work out the problem isn't your cup of tea, you might keep your originals on hard drives and in filesystems you know you have the tools to work with directly.\n\nA: I thought that Apple had solved the local storage problem and made it simpler, but they seem to have repeated some prior problems of iPhoto Libraries.   First, it appears you can indeed delete all your new local Photo Library items.  However, when you want to look at them in Photos on Mac again it will re-download them all again.   Apple says (https://support.apple.com/kb/HT204264) that using Optimize Storage setting makes this all fine but if you have 10 years of photos, even in some optimized format I think they will take up tons of space.   I just started loading a few months and my local \"Optimized Storage\" is 2.5 GB already.  \nTaking a look on the Finder, I see Apple is again creating some type of Packaged folder with all the library items and tons of metadata.   This is the same thing they did that was problematic for iPhotos and caused lots of people to create multiple libraries through (hidden features to switch libraries, initially) and have to move libraries around between local and network storage to deal with space limitations. \nNow, Apple seems to imply that the Optimized Storage feature is smart enough to 'manage' my local storage for me.   However, I have no controls to tell it to limit its use to, say, 10 GB.  We will all find out soon just how good it is at managing this.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use `tmutil delete` or another command to delete one file from all backup intervals? I'm having problems clearing our a backup drive. I want to get rid of a couple large files so I can preserve the other incremental backups.\nI can't use the tmutil delete command on entire backups since I'd lose all files from that interval and not just the offending file I want to purge.

I also expect that script would let me discover which file in the package the GUI is refusing to prune since I can debug a script easier than I can Finder and the Time Machine interface.\nIn case this is a simple permissions issue - the library package file/folder:\nMac:~ bmike$ ls -laeO  /Volumes/Backups/Backups.backupdb/Mac/2015-04-09-072338/Macintosh\\ HD/Users/bmike/Pictures/Photos\\ Library.photoslibrary \ntotal 0\ndrwxr-xr-x@ 10 bmike staff  - 340 Apr  8 20:05 .\n 0: group:everyone deny add_file,delete,add_subdirectory,delete_child,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\ndrwx------@ 28 bmike staff  - 952 Apr  9 09:38 ..\n 0: group:everyone deny add_file,delete,add_subdirectory,delete_child,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\n 1: group:everyone deny delete\ndrwxr-xr-x+  2 bmike staff  -  68 Apr  8 09:07 Attachments\n 0: group:everyone deny add_file,delete,add_subdirectory,delete_child,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\ndrwxr-xr-x+  2 bmike staff  -  68 Apr  8 09:07 Masks\n 0: group:everyone deny add_file,delete,add_subdirectory,delete_child,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\n\nWhen I use the Time Machine interface, it errors out and I don't know which file or instance has errors:\n\nI'm looking for a way to delete these protected files from all backup intervals in a similar manner to the Finder Gear icon action of Delete All Backups of \"Photos Library\" \n\nIs this selective pruning of a file/folder possible across all time intervals with Apple's built in tools, a custom script and/or other tool?\n\nA: Yes, you can use the \"TM Safety Net\" helper bypass to bypass the ACL restrictions allow you to use rm the way you normally would. Except, of course, Time Machine uses \"hard links\" so rm does not entirely work the way you normally expect it to work.\nThe bypass program is not meant for people to use and can be hard to find, and it has moved around in various versions of OS X. I find it using this command:\nlocate TMSafetyNet.kext | grep bypass\n\nThen you use it to authorize rm\nsudo /System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/Helpers/bypass rm -rf /Volumes/Backups/Backups.backupdb/Mac/2015-04-09-072338/Macintosh\\ HD/Users/bmike/Pictures/Photos\\ Library.photoslibrary\n\nKeep in mind, as mentioned, that because of the way Time Machine uses hard links of directories, this rm command can remove the file from other backups. I would not recommend using it unless you are trying to remove the file from all backups.\nIn fact, in general, I would not recommend using hidden commands like this. Use the GUI as Apple intended. Of course in this specific case, where you have a lot of computers to execute the same command on and you fully understand the impact of hard links, then go ahead.\nIf you are going to script this, your script should make sure that Time Machine is (a) disabled and (b) not currently running a backup (because unfortunately (a) does not guarantee (b)) before running commands using bypass. You probably should do that when running commands manually, too.\n\nA: Here is a way to exclude folders from timemachine.\n\n*\n\n*Hold the command key and type the space bar to bring up Spotlight.\n\n\n*Type Time Machine and open the system preference (not the application).\n\n\n*Click the Options... button in the lower right corner of the Time Machine system preference panel.\n\n\n*Click the plus button then navigate to the folder you want to exclude.\n\n\n*Click on the Exclude button.\n\n\n*Click on Save.\nhttps://www.imore.com/how-exclude-files-time-machine-backups\n", "Q: Getting old photos from Camera Roll to Photo Stream I have over 7,000 pictures on my iPod Camera Roll. I recently signed up with iCloud but only the pictures I take after signing up with iCloud go to my Photo Stream. How do I get the first 7,000 pictures onto my Photo Stream?\nI want all of my photos to be available on any iOS device where I sign in with my iCloud account.\n\nA: I'm doing this by using Photos on a Mac. I connect the phone to the computer and Photos lets me import and then delete the originals. \nOnce that is done, the Photos app pushes them up to the iCloud Photo Library and the phone has free space to re-download the photos over time.\nIf you have a PC or don't want to use Photos, you can transfer the photos using iTunes and then use a web browser to upload the photos to iCloud.\nHaving a computer to do the upload is working much better than having an iOS device which goes to sleep and uses battery instead of wall power.\nI've gotten 15k photos into the cloud so far with 10.10.3 and it's been solid for a day. Fingers crossed it stays that way.\nAlso, as Buscar웃 astutely pointed out - your iCloud Photo Library can grow to arbitrary size but the Photo Stream has limits - 10,000 photos per 24 hour upload period / 25k per month. These limits are only in effect if you don't store all your photos in the iCloud Photo Library using iOS 8.3 or later. Then, you are limited by your total storage space and bandwidth as far as I can tell so soon after release of the product.\n\nA: What you are asking specifically to do is not possible. It's also possible there may be a confusion in terms here.\nPhoto Stream is intended to upload from the device which took the picture, in order for it to be distributed to all of your devices. Pictures are only uploaded from the point where you turn the service on, going forward, and are only stored for up to 30 days. It is not a permanent storage solution. Therefore uploading thousands of photos from your Camera Roll to Photo Stream would not really do you any good, even if it was possible (which it is not).\niCloud Photo Library, which has now officially launched with the release of Mac OS X 10.10.3 and iOS 8.3, is intended to be a permanent storage solution. Original files are uploaded to iCloud Photo Library and each device can choose to download original files or previews (which are intended to save space). Your entire photo library is then available from any iOS device, Mac, Windows (with iCloud support installed) or the web. Note that your iPod touch (4th generation) cannot upgrade past iOS 6.1.6, and therefore cannot use iCloud Photo Library.\nSince you are looking for a permanent storage option, given the iOS limitations of your device, the best solution is to physically attach it to a computer and import the photos into the program of your choice. If that's a Mac running 10.10.3, you can use Photos and enable iCloud Photo Library. Once you have a newer device running iOS 8.3 or later, you can then enable iCloud Photo Library on the device to view all of your pictures.\n", "Q: Routing traffic internally from Ethernet-Thunderbolt adapter to Ethernet I have  Mac1 connected via ethernet to a router.\nThe Mac1 has the IP 10.0.1.5\nOn this IP I have a Python-server listening to incoming UDP packets.\nNow there is another Mac2 connected to Mac1 via a Thunderbolt-Ethernet Adapter. The IP of Mac1 on this adapter is 192.168.20.1\nMac2 sends UPD packets to this address.\nHow can i route this traffic internally on Mac1 from  192.168.20.1 to 10.0.1.5?\nBoth machines are on MacOS 10.10\nThanks a lot!\n\nA: There is no need to route anything. Just let the python-server also listen to incoming UDP packets at eth2 (192.168.20.1) assuming eth2 is the TB-Ethernet interface.\n", "Q: Grayed out \"Redirect\" option in OSX Mail.app Running recent Mavericks (10.9.5)\nI am wondering why I can only sometimes redirect messages, as opposed to forwarding, as in principle being offered via \"Message > Redirect\".\nSometimes this works, sometimes not, i.e., \"Message > Redirect\" is a grayed out option. \nTs there a somewhere documented pattern for this behaviour?\n\nA: Redirect is disabled for Exchange accounts (last §), presumably because the sender address is enforced by the Exchange server (to prevent spoofing).\n", "Q: Windows 8.1 Boot Camp automatic repair loop After successfully installing Windows 8.1 on my 2010 MacBook, running Yosemite as its primary OS, my Windows OS rebooted 5 minutes after a fresh install and now I'm stuck in the \"automatic repair loop\". I also get this error after trying to repair: \n\nThe drive where Windows is installed is locked. Unlock the drive and try again.\n\nAlso even after I installed the Bootcamp drivers my system was still void of this \"boot camp control panel\" which leads me to think this maybe a driver issue. \nThis is the second time I've gotten this issue so I don't think another install will resolve anything. \nIs there anything I can do to stabilize my Windows OS and successfully get the Boot Camp control panel to work as well?\n\nA: If you did not use the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows, then you likely installed Windows 8.1 in UEFI mode, which neither Apple nor Microsoft support on a Mac.\nIf you don't want to use the Boot Camp assistant, then the trick here is to have created an empty FAT partition on the drive with Disk Utility BEFORE you attempt to install Windows.  Disk Utility will create a hybrid MBR on the disk, and the presence of the hybrid MBR causes the Mac firmware to use BIOS emulation which is required for Windows to run correctly.\nThe use of Windows 8.1 in UEFI mode on a Mac is possible, but it's asking for trouble and you should only run it that way it if you really know what you are doing.\n", "Q: How to set a screen resolution other than what is displayed in the scaled list? I need to set my screen resolution 1280x720 (this is a requirement for a screencast I need to create).  When I go into the Display - Scaled menu this is no longer available as an option on Yosemite, even though it was available on previous versions of the OS on the same laptop.\nIs there a way in Yosemite to access or force different screen resolutions for this?\n\nA: You can install John Ford's screenresolution utility via brew install screenresolution. Alternatively you can download and compile the source here.\nOnce the utility is installed you can see all available resolutions via screenresolution list. Assuming the appropriate resolution is listed you can set your display with something like screenresolution set 1280x720x32.\n", "Q: iOS contacts app that can print data from vCards Is anyone aware of an iOS app that can sync with CardDav to get a contact list and can then print off a nicely formatted contact card?\nBasically, I want to be able to print information for referrals for patients.  Contacts can work great for holding this information, but we can't print it from iPads\n\nA: The way to get the contacts out is to use the Workflow app as it can receive contacts from the Share Contact control and then parse the input.\nIf you want the address, just dump the entire contact to the printer. If you want to customize things, you can select specific fields or set variables / pass the data to a python script that runs in Pythonista.\n", "Q: Events or Albums in Photos for OSX I have upgraded OSX Yosemite and now have Photos instead of iPhoto.  I have a question regarding usage of Events and Albums.  \nSay I go to the Zoo with my family, take some pictures and then import into Photos. Is that an Event or an Album? I always used Events with iPhoto, but now it seems as though it should be albums.\n\nA: I've found that turning on the sidebar has helped me adjust to Photos much more quickly.\nEvery import dumps photos into the All Photos album as well as the \"Last Import\" view. You have to create each album by choice and there are now no events that you can control directly.\nYou can choose the \"summarize photos\" option or uncheck it to get more or less detail when browsing by time, but Photos makes decisions based on the date metadata with each image.\nCollections seem to replace events, but again - they are generated algorithmically and not something you can edit. Best case, change the metadata and export the original photos you wish to \"edit or change\" and then delete them. By re-importing the original images, you can perhaps influence the collection and ordering by algorithm, but the algorithms themselves remain the same.\n", "Q: How can I correct a typo with Apple ID? How can I use iTunes with an email address that isn't actually an email address? \n\nA: The answer depends. If you are using an apple email (such as me.com, iCLoud.com, mac.com, etc) then that email address is by default an apple id, and I don't know of a way to edit it.\nIf you are using a 3rd party email address (such as hotmail, gmail, yahoo, your own domain etc) as your appleid, then you should first TURN OFF FindMyIPhone on your device if it is enabled.  (DO NOT change your primary Apple ID with FindMyIPhone enabled, it can be enabled again as soon as you are done with the changes.)\nNext navigate to http://appleid.apple.com and choose the \"manage\" option, then log in.  An \"Edit\" button will appear next to your primary appleid.  (if the Edit button does not appear then you are using an apple generated email address such as me.com, iCloud.com, mac.com etc.)\nNext on your phone go to the settings app, and log out and log back in for iCloud, iTunes and App Store, iMessage, Facetime, Game Center, and update email accounts if needed).\nOnce everything is working as expected be sure to turn FindMyIPhone back on.  (It is possible to get out of the mess you create attempting to do this with FindMyIPhone turned on--i did it-- but it is much simpler to just turn it off before starting and re-enable it at the end of the process).  \n\nA: There are two ways I can see you getting out of this jam if Tyson's answer on the normal method fails you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Contact your email provider and explain the dilemma. Say you'll need delivery of the \"broken\" email for several hours while you change the AppleID to be the correct email. That way you can receive the validation emails from Apple.\n\n*Contact Apple support and explain the dilemma. They might be able to see it's a new account and the mistake an understandable one and get engineering involved to make things right. They might also explain another way to recover or delete that account and let you start over.\nUnless you have a gmail account where you can take advantage of things like punctuation and +this_extra text gets ignored. (if my email were bmike@gmail.com - I could use b.mike@gmail or b.m.i.ke@gmail and it would all go to my account. Again, this last idea is an oddball thing where you'd have to luck into the proper typo to have it work.\n", "Q: Manage and update many machines with the same settings I have a small renderfarm of mac minis and they should all have exactly the same settings, get the same updates, etc. etc. I'm sure there is a solution for this and I would love to stop repeating myself :). How does this work at the enterprise level?\nEDIT:\nSorry for being vague. I have just four computers currently but may expand, though likely staying below ten. I frequently have to install software upgrades, configure licenses, update network mount points, etc. \nI've done some rudimentary google searches but am having trouble finding the terminology. \n\nA: For that level of computers, your best bet is to get a license of Apple Remote Desktop to manage them.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/remotedesktop/\nSince it's Apple software, you can leverage AppleCare to get technical help and guidance. It scales very well for situations under 50 computers. Even managing thousands of Macs is possible, but I'd put my money on a different horse when crossing 100 Macs under management.\nSeriously consider trying out bushel as well as osquery along with ARD to get started.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://osquery.io\n\n*http://www.bushel.com\nYou get free support from bushel and can stick with the free plan to see if it suits you while learning about MDM options.

(I also put the the folder on file share available read and write to everyone and guests could access just to make sure that was not an issue)\nRegardless, my workaround for now after trying so many things like checking my files are shared on the server etc, is to hit continue when I get the error then hit Command + R.\nNow that I'm on Runtime how do I upload an image to this computer I just booted to the network with. Was the .nbi the image? Do I have to create something on the workflows? What is the process.\nPlease keep in mind that when I hit \"Create a master from a volume\" on any Mac it tells me that there is no volume available and then it has an arrow pointing to >>>>>>> Repository.\nThat's how I thought I would create the image but I can select a volume.\nI hope that was enough info for someone to answer my question. \nPlease help and thank you in advance. :D\nUPDATE: I resolved the repository issue (it was an issue with the url I provided for the network sharepoint).\nNow I'm trying to create an image from an already set up computer with all applications I need. I booted from mini and it was able to create an image. I booted from a Pro, however, and the volume is grayed out. Any ideas?\n\nA: The .nbi is the NetBoot set, it's the disk you are booting the Mac you want to image from that contains DeployStudio Runtime. From there you will run a workflow, that can incorporate an image if you want. The workflow is created in DeployStudio Admin.\nTo create images, I like to use AutoDMG: https://github.com/MagerValp/AutoDMG\nOnce you get your image, you'll want to make sure it's named with a .hfs.dmg (AutoDMG will take care of this for you).\nYou copy the image on to your DeployStudio repo, by mounting the file share and copying the file into a folder called Masters and a subfolder inside that called HFS (I'm doing this from memory so that name may be slightly off).\nOnce your Master is in place, you should be able to select it from the Imaging step in a new workflow you create in DeployStudio admin.\nMake sure the fileshare and its contents are accessible by the user you setup for DeployStudio... that may be the issue.\n", "Q: Mac Pro Tower, randomly hanging convinced its a hardware problem but Apple think otherwise Just about ready to launch this machine out the window it's driving me crazy.\nOk so a rundown of what has happened thus far.\nBought a Mac Pro Tower around 2010, worked like a dream for 3 years then due to circumstances it had to be put into storage for the past 2 years.\nAnyway when I got it out of storage a few weeks ago and fired it up I noticed that it keep randomly hanging and nothing would allow me to resume control. Due to the age of the machine I figured it could have been a failing HD, so replaced it with a new one and done a clean install of Snow Leopard. \nThat didn't make any difference, so after asking around on here I got told it could have been the PRAM battery, so I then replaced that too and again it made no difference.\nAt that point I took it into the Apple Store, it crashed twice when they loaded their own OS on it so they kept it in for further investigation. They then called me up to say that they couldn't find any hardware faults but that they did install a newer version of Snow Leopard.\nSo I have just got it home, set it up and it crashed yet again.\nAny ideas what I should do now?\n\nA: Yes - troubleshooting this could be easy if you take some time. Get a notepad and write down the times of the problems - day, minute, second. Over time a pattern will emerge.\nSave the logs - after it crashes - run the command sudo sysdiagnose as this will package each crash and the logs for later analysis.\nPay attention to what crashes - is it a kernel panic, a freeze, an abrupt reboot. The steps to diagnose each is slightly different. We have a [chat] for getting troubleshooting help if you need a start.\n", "Q: How to install Windows 8.1 on MacBook Pro from USB? I'm on a 2011 MacBook Pro trying to install Windows 8.1 from a USB. I tried creating bootable FAT32 and NTFS USBs from my Windows ISO with Rufus, but still I don't see anything in Startup Disk in Windows or OS X:\n\nUpdate 1:\nAttempted to write ISO to USB with Disk Utility in OS X, but it wouldn't let me select the ISO (see JeremyKun's comment).\nUpdate 2:\nManaged to write the ISO to USB with dd in OS X, but still I don't see it in Startup Disk.\n\nA: Non-retina display MacBooks cannot boot anything other than OS X from a USB flash drive.  It's a limitation in the firmware.  Apple fixed this with the retina models because they have no optical drive, meaning USB is the ONLY way to install Windows.  On a retina display MacBook, the Boot Camp assistant even makes a USB flash drive for you the same as Rufus does.  However, they never backported this fix to non-retina models (and the Boot Camp assistant on non-retina models does not have the USB option).\nThe only way to boot a USB stick for the purpose of installing Windows is to use rEFInd and bless the rEFInd directory as your startup folder (which itself must be done from the command line as the Startup Disk control panel won't even show it as an option).\nrEFInd will then take over the boot process and will allow you to boot to USB media.  If you don't like rEFInd you can remove it after Windows is installed.  You will then see Windows and OS X as options in the Startup Disk control panel.\nHere is a link to the rEFInd home page, and here's how to install and bless the rEFInd directory.\nNOTE:  Use Disk Utility to create yourself a FAT-formatted partition on the disk BEFORE you attempt to install Windows.  This will create the hybrid MBR that Windows needs to boot.  You can reformat it NTFS during the Windows install.  I you already have an NTFS partition (as your screenshot above shows), you can skip this step as you already have the hybrid MBR created.\n\nA: I was able to install Windows 7 Ultimate on my MacBook Pro Early 2011 (MacBookPro8,2) using these instructions (archived instructions).  Basically you use VM software, such as VMWare, pointed at your bootcamp hard drive partition (instead of to a virtual disk, which is what VM machines normally do) to install windows which makes the bootcamp partition bootable.  Then you delete all of the files from the Windows partition and copy all the files from your bootable USB drive.  Then, using refind, you can boot to the windows partition, which will start the windows installer you just copied there, and you can  install to the same partition.\nYou already have found instructions for creating the bootable USB drive.  (Here are the instructions that allowed me to create the bootable USB from an ISO.)  I also needed to download the Bootcamp drivers manually and copy them to the USB drive myself.  Instructions for installing refind are available online too.  (To avoid System Integrity Protection, I installed refind in recovery mode. Since my downloads folder is on an encrypted disk that I couldn't figure out how to unlock while in recover mode, I copied the refind files to my USB drive and ran them from there while in recovery mode.  I still got the SIP warning during the refind install, but the boot manager works.)\nHere are the additional steps for posterity (but I recommend referring to the instructions I linked as they go through every step with screenshots):\n\n\n*\n\n*Obtain VMWare (there is a trial version that works.)\n\n*Create a new custom VM.\n\n*Using the command line, cd into the package that is your virtual machine.\nIn there, create a new virtual machine disk that points at your bootcamp \npartition.  You will need to determine the disk number and partition number\nof your bootcamp partition, one way is to inspect it using Disk Utility\n(e.g. disk1s4, 1 is the disk number and 4 is\npartition number.  Then run this command (while your current directory is the\nroot of your VM package:\n\n/Applications/VMware\\ Fusion.app/Contents/Library/vmware-rawdiskCreator create /dev/disk[X] [Y] win7_raw lsilogic\n\nwhere you replace [X] with your bootcamp disk number and [Y] with its\npartition number.\n\n*Now \"show package contents\" of your virtual machine, and edit the file named\nWindows 7 x64.vmx (this will have the name you used for your VM and the \nextension .vmx.  You need to edit two lines to cause the VM to use the \nVM disk you just created:\n\nscsi0.virtualDev=lsilogic\nscsi0:0.fileName=win7_raw.vmdk\n\n\n*Now attach the bootable USB to your VM using the VM options.  Start the VM.\nMy disk is encrypted, and I got a password prompt when the VM started.\nThis indicated to me that the VM was correctly configured to use my \nbootcamp partition. The attached USB should begin installation of Windows on \nyour VM.\nSince the VM is actually using your bootcamp partition, this will install\nWindows to your bootcamp partition.\n\n*But for some reason this version of windows is only part of what you need.\nI couldn't use the Windows installation as-is.  So what you do next is\ndelete all the files from the bootcamp partition and copy over all the files\nfrom your bootable USB.  (You can install a trial of Tuxera to allow your\nmacOS to write/delete files on an NTFS volume.)\n\n*Finally, boot to this volume using refind and your windows installer should\nbegin.\n\n", "Q: How do I switch my Apple ID email to a previously used rescue email? I originally had my current email address set as a rescue email, and my old email as the original Apple ID.  \nWhen I deleted my current email address off the rescue email list, I was unable to set it as my Apple ID address. \nHow would I be able to set my current email as my Apple ID?\n\nA: You are getting an error message because your primary email cannot be the same as your rescue email. You have to first change your rescue email. \nI just went through this. A source of confusion is that the instructions are not clear, and the option to change your rescue email is not easy to find. \nGo to manage Apple ID (https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage), and in the left navigation to password and security.   You need to enter answers to your security questions before you can go through. If you forgot the answers, there's a link to send security questions reset information to your rescue email.  \nOnce you have entered the answers to the security questions, you can change your rescue email - you'll have to enter one different from the main email, and you'll have to validate.   \nOnce this done, you can set your current email as your primary email, and then set it as your appleID. \nUpdate:  It was mentioned below, but worth adding it here to save headaches. Turn off Find my phone in all devices that are signed in to icloud.  Otherwise,  you won't be able to sign out, as your device will be signed to an account (used id) that does not exist.   Suggest making a backup first and then signing off from iCloud.  Make the ID change once all devices are signed off. \nIf you forget to do that, you will either have to restore the device, or will have at a later time to change your id back to the old email, log off the device, and then change it back to the new one. \n\nA: It depends.  If it's an apple email address... (i.e. @me.com @icloud.com etc) you may not be able to change it.\nNavigate to http://appleid.apple.com and click \"Manage Apple Id\" and log in.  If the \"edit\" button appears next to your primary email address then you can change the primary appleid. (if the edit button doesn't appear at all then your appleid is using an apple email address and you cant change the primary.)  First however you will need to delete that address as your alternate email address.  Once it doesn't appear as the secondary you can edit the primary and use that previous secondary.\nCAUTION turn off Find my iPhone before beginning this process.  Make sure to log out on your phone and log back in multiple places on your phone, such as iCloud, iTunes and app store, iMessage, Facetime, Game Center, possible email settings, etc.  Once the changeover is complete, don't forget to turn find my iPhone back on.\n\nA: The E-mail address you use as a login name on an Apple ID can not be changed. It's essentially your user name. You can change which E-mail address you get your mail regarding the Apple ID sent to on the Apple ID settings page.\n", "Q: What is the difference between Personal VPN vs VPN Configuration profiles? I noticed that the VPN menu in the iPhone settings menu has two different kinds of VPN connections and I am troubled by it. There are two different types of VPN connections shown, Personal VPN profiles and a type for VPN Configuration profiles. After searching for a while, I haven't been able to find out the difference between the two. ( iPhone 5, iOS 8.3 )  Do the two different types have different types of encryption? Different types of connections?Should one be preferred over the other? Any clarification would be appreciated. Thank you.\n\n\nEDIT: After reinstalling the profile, I realized the Personal VPN configuration isn't signed like the regular VPN configuration.\nEDIT #2: Often times when I use the normal VPN configuration connection, it gets detected by the wifi I am connected to as a proxy and I receive warning messages because of it. If this is relevant I hope it helped.\n\nA: The Personal VPN section contains VPN profiles added by applications that use the NetworkExtension.framework. These are traditional IPSEC VPNs that can use IKEv1 or IKEv2 for key exchange. \nSupported authentication methods are PSK (Pre-Shared Key) in the case of IKEv1, or X.509 certificates for both IKEv1 and IKEv2. The security is equal to (or greater than, in the case of PPTP) what you find in the VPN configurations in the \"VPN Configuration\" section.\nIPSEC VPNs should not be confused with SSL VPNs. NetworkExtensions.framework VPNs are IPSEC VPNs. Most commercial VPN products should support both IPSEC and SSL VPNs. \nIn the Open Source world, OpenVPN is an SSL VPN, whereas the SWAN software family (Strongswan, Libreswan, etc) supports IPSEC VPNs.\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to each type of VPN that are not in scope for a discussion like this. You can check Wikipedia for more details if you are interested.\n\nA: In short, no. Both are instances of VPN configurations profiles. \nBy default, the “VPN Configurations” pane should be the only one that exists if you are installing a VPN configuration profile under the natively supported protocols (PPTP, L2TP/IPSEC). \nThe “Personal VPN” option appears only after installing certain software, such as Unlimited Free VPN by Betternet, which requires that you deploy the configuration profile in the form of a “preference pane profile” rather than deploying it either from the web, say, or through manual configuration. Additionally, the authentication involves a certificate exchange:\n\nDetails:\nApparently, it’s an implementation of the Network Extended Framework API:\n\nThe Network Extension framework (NetworkExtension.framework) provides support for configuring and controlling Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnels. Use this framework to create VPN configurations. You can then start VPN tunnels manually or supply on-demand rules to start the VPN tunnel in response to specific events.\n\nI’m not a developer, but having read the documentation and browsed around a few Stack Overflow discussions on it, it’s basically a plug-in that allows the user to manage an otherwise unsupported VPN protocol (IKEv2), and to do so within the native iOS VPN preference pane. \n\nDo the two different types have different types of encryption?\n\nAt face value, no. If we are comparing the protocols, yes. The encryption depends on the protocol you are using and the VPN provider. With the exception of PPTP, the de-facto standard is 256-bit AES for transfer. IKEv2 supports and implements this.  \n\nDifferent types of connections?\n\nIn this sense, yes. \nSidenote: I use a third party application that supports OpenVPN to connect to my VPN provider (iPhone 6, running iOS 8.3) - as advised by them. The configuration profile appears as expected, under the default \"VPN Configurations\" pane. \nMy personal opinion would be to avoid all free VPN services unless you are rolling out your own. I use Private Internet Access, both on OS X and iOS, and highly recommend it. \n\nA: To break it down for you more simply: think proxy vs actual VPN. Notice when IPSec and IKev2 is used and when it isn’t,\n\nA: Personal VPN (Section: “PERSONAL VPN”)\nThese apps utilize iOS built-in VPN tunneling protocol implementations (IPSec, IKEv2, etc..).\nDevelopers of this type of apps, setup server-side infrastructure for particular VPN protocol, and design iOS app to provide a configuration required for connecting to the infrastructure. This configuration is then picked up by iOS and the system takes responsibility on connecting and managing VPN connectivity.\nNon-Personal VPN (Section: “VPN CONFIGURATIONS”)\nThese apps provide their own (custom) VPN tunnel implementation. It can be either an implementation of well-known VPN protocol (e.g. OpenVPN), or a custom implementation of custom VPN protocol.\nDevelopers of this type of apps, create a special application extension. The system launches the extension. After that, the extension picks up the configuration from Network Extension preferences, and takes responsibility on connecting and managing VPN connectivity.\nThese apps’ configurations fall into VPN CONFIGURATIONS section of VPN Settings panel.\nBecause these apps have their own application extension to tunnel user’s traffic, some cool features can be implemented here. For instance, an app can filter content, prevent malware resources to be loaded, or support a Kill Switch.\nNon-Personal VPN is also called Enterprise VPN. Perhaps, this implies that only BTB segment needs these features. However, we, as users also want this! Fortunatelly, a lot of VPN apps available on the App Store provide Enterprise VPN functionlaity these days.\n", "Q: Are OS X Security Updates Cumulative? I can't seem to find a definitive answer anywhere, but are Mac OS X Security Updates cumulative?\nThe update in question is 2015-004. I've checked https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204659 but it doesn't list any requirements.\nBackground: I've just finished deploying 2015-002 to some of our iMacs (running Mavericks 10.9.5), but now I see that 2015-004 is out. I was wondering if there was any point in continuing rolling out 2015-002, or should I just deploy 2015-004?\n\nA: I would assume not cumulative, based on 15 years on Mac, and continue with -002. \nAbsolutely there's a point, one never knows what little fixes are included in each Security Update, nor what might be dependent on previous updates. \nBite the bullet and play by the Apple book.  \n\nA: I agree with Zo219 and wanted to add some other thoughts.\nReading the article - the security fixes are present in both 10.10.3 and update 2005-004. Those fixes are clearly not in 2015-002 so you'll want to finish 002 and then evaluate if you're jumping to 10.10.3 or will need to apply 2015-004 as a stopgap before .3 can be rolled out.\nBased on how fast you could package, test and deploy 004 that would guide me in stopping work on 002. I'd only stop 002 if I knew I could deploy 10.10.3 and finish as soon as 002 would be done.\n\nAs a general rule, point updates almost universally roll in all intermediate security updates. So, 10.10.3 will have all the security updates post 10.10.2 - but if there are three hypothetical updates between 10.10.3 and 10.10.4, you'll need all three updates to be patched to be secure since they do not historically roll up.\n", "Q: How to show the map in Photos? I just upgraded to OS X Yosemite with the new Photos application. I have seen screenshots online where we can view photos on a map, however I can't get to that map.\nHow can I see all of my photos on a map, like in iPhoto/Aperture?\n\nA: You can type a location into the search box and one of the options usually is a location; if you select it, a map comes up showing all of the photos taken in that location.  For example, if you type 'Colorado' in the search box, 'Colorado - State' is one of the choices.\n\nA: For more recent versions of Photos.app (Version 2.0 that came with macOS 10.12 Sierra at least), there is a \"Places\" item avaialble under \"Albums\" in the sidebar (use \"View\" -> \"Show Sidebar\" if it is not visible). This gives a map view similar to that available in iPhoto.app.\nFor older versions of Photos.app, it does not appear that there is a way to see ALL photo locations on a map at one time, aside from a small Info window. Here's what you need to do:\nFor the small info window that shows all locations:\n 1. Go to the Albums tab in Photos\n 2. Right-click on \"All Photos\" -> Get info\n 3. Note the small window has a map included which you can zoom in/out of\nFor maps that vary by date:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to View menu -> Metadata -> Location\n\n*Go to the Photos tab and zoom all the way out to Years\n\n*Note that there are locations next to the year. Click on the location name\n\nA: Actually you can see all your photos on a map, it is just not obvious. Go to Photos and go all the way out to see all your images. You now see location names for all locations you have tagged your photos with, together with year or year interval. Simply click the location name and a map will be shown.\n", "Q: Messages app on Mac syncing text messages but not iMessages I am encountering problems syncing iMessages with my Mac. I can send and receive text messages and iMessages on my iPhone. I cannot send and receive iMessages on my Macbook, but I can send and receive text messages on my Macbook.\nMy Messages app on Mac was working perfectly until I deleted items in my Keychain. I repaired and verified my Keychain afterwards, too. I did do a hard restart and removed all my accounts on my Mac and added them back. I also deleted my iCloud account and re-added it.\nI have also disabled iMessages on my iPhone, then re-enabled it. Also de-paired and re-paired my iPhone and Macbook connection for iMessages. I still get the same behavior. \nDoes anyone have any idea what to do? I have googled and tried everything...\nAnytime I send an iMessage through the Messages app, I get the \"not delivered!\" notice. Is there an error log I can check for iMessages that might give me hints? \nThanks.\n\nA: The messages app on the Mac has it's own preferences. Check if you're iMessage account is set up there and has a password set – perhaps you deleted it through keychain. If that doesn't help remove it with the minus and re-add the account. \n", "Q: How to add a location to photos in the new photos app? I have tried anything I could think of and also consulted the \"photos\" help as well as google but I could not find a way to geotag photos in \"photos\".\nIs there a way to do this or is it really only possible to view photos on a map if they have been geotagged when imported to \"photos\"?\n\nA: It appears that this has changed as of Photos 1.1 (El Capitan).\nAccording to this article, adding and editing geolocation data is a new feature.\n\nPhotos 1.1 addressed this major customer pain point with the \n  introduction of an Assign a Location feature available within \n  the Inspector window.\n\nSee also the following excerpt from this article:\n\nIn Photos 1.1 you can add a location to an image or batch of images\n  that weren’t geotagged, as well as edit the location of data of\n  already-geotagged images. To do this, you open the Inspector window by\n  pressing Command-I. In a not-yet-geotagged image, the Inspector will\n  display a line labeled Assign a Location. Clicking in this area will\n  let you enter a street address or a name of a point of interest, and\n  Photos will search Apple’s Maps database. If that location isn’t good\n  enough for you, you can always click on the pin and drag it around the\n  map, placing it wherever you like.\n\n\nA: I am the developer of an alternative to HoudaGeo called Photo Geotag, which I believe is simpler –and cheaper. You can buy it from the Mac App Store. \nI'm always finding ways to improve it based on user feedback. In fact there's a new version coming out in a few days that removes the need for recompressing the image after geotagging.\n\nA: I can confirm that (at least in El Capitan) Photos app, geotagging using exact coordinates (from GPS or Dash Cam) is possible, just use the Inspector to type the coordinates in the form \"N39.5221 W83.8453\", it will suggest you the nearest named location in the drop-down, like \"59 Gano Road, Willmington, OH\", but will in the end assign the correct location after you press Enter:\n\n\nYou can actually enter the GPS coordinates in Deg, Min, Sec format as well as decimal. e.g. 49°01'33.4\"N 120°47'55.3\"W You can also use signed values (+ North, - South, + East, - West) with either format, e.g. 49°01'33.4\" -120°47'55.3\" or 49.0259 -120.7987  In short, you can usually just copy coordinates from a map or other application and paste them directly into the location in Photos and they will work.\n\nA: In OS X El Capitan this is now possible using the Photos app by selecting the photos you wish to geotag, right-clicking and selecting 'Get Info', then typing the location in the 'location' field. It will auto search for best results and select the one that is correct.\n\nA: In OS X 10.10's Photos application, location information is read-only.\nPhotos reads GPS coordinates from image files during import and displays the location in the Info window. It can also show photos belonging to a collection or moment on a map. The \"Photos Help\" puts it this way: \"If your camera has GPS capability (as iPhone does), or you’ve added GPS information to your photos, Photos can automatically display your photos on a map.\"\nUnfortunately location information is also read-only by the way of Apple Script. I develop the photo geocoding software HoudahGeo. When used with iPhoto or Aperture, this allows for a very elegant workflow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Import photos into iPhoto or Aperture \n\n*Geocode the photos using HoudahGeo or other free software.\n\n*Write geotags to the original image files\n\n*Have HoudahGeo notify iPhoto or Aperture of the newly added geotags\n\n\nThe last step of the workflow uses Apple Script to update the library to reflect the location information added to the files. This is not currently possible with the new Photos application.\nUntil Apple adds the option to change location information via Apple Script, we have to resort to a less elegant workflow.\n\n\n*\n\n*Import photos using the Image Capture application \n\n*Geocode the photos using third party software like HoudahGeo or other free software.\n\n*Write EXIF/XMP geotags to the image files \n\n*Import the tagged files into your Photos library\n\n\nThis workflow does have its advantages. The process of updating the iPhoto or Aperture library for thousands of photos can be rather slow. Adding the GPS information before import is faster.\nThe above workflow also ensures that GPS information is stored as EXIF/XMP tags within the image files. Just the same as if you had used a GPS camera. The location information will thus always stay with the images.\nUpdate for macOS Sierra:\nWith Apple Photos 2.0 and HoudahGeo 5.1 running on Sierra it again possible to notify Photos of changes made to location information. I.e. HoudahGeo will geotag orginal image files with EXIF/XMP tags and then pass on location information to the Photos app.  \n\nA: In El Capitan's Photos app you can add a location very easily:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Photos app and double-click on the photo you wish to add a location to         … (alternatively, you can select multiple pictures from the Albums or Photos view if you wish to apply the location to all selected images)\n\n*Click on the (i) button in the Photos menu bar\n\n*Last line in the menu… Click on “Assign a Location” and start typing the name of the location ex: City and country. You will have suggestion(s) as you type\n\n*Now you have the new location attach to the file and on a map.\n\nA: In short, you can't. Apple removed that functionality from the new Photos app.  If you want to add location data either export the photo, delete it from Photos, then use one of the 3rd party apps cited in the other answers (or your old iPhoto / Aperture if you still have them) to update the EXIF data manually, then re-add the photo to Photos again.\nI recommend you let Apple know how annoying this is and maybe they'll reintroduce the feature sometime in the future.\n\nA: Thanks for sharing - this is indeed the same(ish) functionality in Photos 1.1 as it was in iPhoto - something that I've missed loads.\nAs a side; the 'moments' section seems to use both my iPhone and SLR photos together, smartly assuming that they're taken in the same place (my SLR doesn't have any geotagging functionality) which helps. However when you haven't taken any iPhone 'companion' photos (which I usually do to quickly geotag things, like on safari/hiking/travelling) then you were kinda stuffed.\n", "Q: How to configure Mail v8.2 to supply a different default reply-to address in emails being sent? I'm using Mail v8.2 on Macintosh OS X Yosemite and would like to transition to a new email address.  Therefore, I'd like to keep using my old email address for the time being and I have configured my new address to forward all email to my old address.\nNow, I just need to set up my reply-to in every email I send, to default to specifying my new email address, so that recipients will eventually start using my new email address over time and eventually I can pull the trigger and drop the old one and switch to the new one.\nHow can I configure Mail v8.2 to use a different default reply-to email address for each email I send?

I also have installed Adobe Lightroom 5, and I have a bunch of photos synced to iCloud and available through the Photos app. \nI would like to be able to manage my photos through Lightroom, but have the photos synced through iCloud with my other devices. However, it appears that Lightroom cannot read the \"Photos Library.photolibrary\" file that is created with the Photos app.\nI have seen this other question regarding the iPhoto app and Lightroom.

I have just upgraded OS X and opened the new Photos app to import my Aperture library. Everything went well (Photos work fine) but I am surprised to see that I didn't loose 100Gb free space on my HDD.\nMy Aperture library is still there, and takes 100Gb+. When I read information on the new Photos library, it also says 100Gb+. However Daisy Disk shows the following report:\n\n\n*\n\n*Aperture library: 117 Gb\n\n*Photos library: 15 Gb\n\n\nAre there some \"symlinks\" involved in the background? Are photos being slowly copied (100% CPU usage for the last 5 hours): I should add that the migration is finished and I can use Photos fine.\nI am afraid at what would happen if I decide to delete either one of those libraries. I also wonder what happens if I edit photos in Aperture or Photos. I expect those to be completely separated (duplicated libraries) but apparently it's not the case.\nI don't mind HDD usage I have plenty of space.\n\nA: While the correct answer above notes that this may save space on Your hard disk but I believe I am finding that it still DOUBLES the space on your backup server... and I believe this includes time machine backups. \nI have a 1 terabyte OS drive which has 200+GB full. After my upgrade to 10.10 (and photos), I whacked my time machine backup so that I could start from scratch (not concerned about having many versions of each file at this point) and asked it to back up to the 1.5 Terabyte backup drive. \"Not enough room\".\nIn addition, Crashplan seems to need 24 more days after the upgrade to back up my system. It seems squarely focused on the photos library. My guess is that each file will be on the backup server TWICE!!!\nthe beauty of hard links is that programs that access the data don't know that there are not two separate files. And the beauty is also the problem. This move was not well thought out, and I believe we need to clearly note that users need to delete their iphotos library from the drive (and maybe the backups) to not double the backup space.\n\nA: Photos does not actually move the files or duplicate them when importing from an existing iPhoto or Aperture library. It simply creates hard links to the files in their original location from the new Photos library.\nSee how Photos saves disk space on Apple's site.\nMore on hard links from Ars Technica:\n\nA hard link is simply a reference to some data on disk. Think of a file as a combination of a name and a pointer to some data. Deleting a file really means deleting the name portion of that duo. When there are no more names pointing to a particular piece of data disk, then that disk space can be reused.\"\n\nYou can delete your Aperture library without any problems, however you will no longer be able to use Aperture (unless you set up a new library). Any changes made in your existing Aperture library will not appear in Photos, and vice-versa.\nBasically the actual image exists somewhere on the disk, and there are two pointers to the image (one from the old library and one from the new library). So long as at least one of those pointers exists, the data is kept. But when the last pointer is removed (i.e. the old iPhoto library itself is removed, then the image is removed from the Photos library), the data is also removed.\n", "Q: Cannot browse App documents after upgrading to iOS 8.3 I just upgraded my iPhone 5s to iOS 8.3.

Since I notice that some of the OSX created directories in my Home have this permission: \"drwx------+\" I worry that fixing my issue will have ramifications for permissions. \nCan I have what I want with the permissions Apple has set?\n\nA: I'm trying to refrain from starting with \"Why would you want to do that?\"\nYou cannot delete the Desktop Folder, the OS should tell you it is a required folder & not allow it. I suppose you could sudo it, but my guess is it would either replace it after a relog, or just cause problems.\nEven if you did manage to force it to remove the Desktop Folder, what would the OS then use as your Desktop? It certainly wouldn't default to your Home folder, that's not its job.\nI'm sure it would be far simpler all round, if you do want your Home Folders contents directly displayed on your desktop, to make Aliases of those folders & put them inside the Desktop Folder.\n\nA: Let's say you want to make this change for account bob.\nDo\nLog in as alice which is admin.\nThen enter the following sequence of commands (within a Terminal or xterm window):\ncd /Users/bob\n/usr/bin/sudo mv Desktop Desktop.orig\n/usr/bin/sudo ln -s .

Is there a way to see the contents of my clipboard in a way that shows me what formatting metadata is included?\nOr to get to the question behind the question: is there a way to generate output in a script so that if I pipe the output to pbcopy it will include the formatting?\nSpecific example: if I write a script that generates a newline-delimited list of names, and then paste it into a table in Confluence, it will just dump the results into a single cell. I'd like to be able to paste it so that the whole column is filled up (with one name per cell).\nI can do this by pasting the results into a Google Spreadsheet and then re-copying the column from Google Spreadsheet. For some reason that adds invisible formatting that allows me to paste the cells into Confluence, but when I inspect the clipboard (in Finder's Edit->Show Clipboard, or using pbpaste | hexdump) it seems exactly the same as the output of my script. I've often had this problem with formatting text for the clipboard, and I'd really like to know what tricks there are for viewing and generating this magical invisible formatting.\n\nA: An thing on the clipboard is actually an OO-style object which has methods to render itself appropriately in each context.  So the reason that your hex dump from PBCOPY is the same even when the object on the clipboard is different is because the text-only renderings are both the same.\nJust as a file on the clip board will render as its ascii file path in contexts that only accept text pastes.  I believe that pbcopy and pbpaste only operate with this textual format for the objects on the clipboard, so you cannot use them to do what you are aiming to do.\nIf I understand your objective correctly, you could hack it, by using an application like textedit, and feed the application as an rtf (rich text formatted file) then send a COMMAND-A, then COMMAND-C to the text edit application  (or perhaps a text-edit specific dictionary commands).\nThis is really hacky, and it would result in visible action on your screen, but it would be a scripted way to get ascii encoded markup onto the clipboard.\nPost a follow up, if you want help implementing this.\n\nA: For a GUI option:\nDownload Additional tools for Xcode from https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=xcode\nOpen Clipboard Viewer. It doesn't seem to have a CLI interface though.\nFrom Finder, you can also inspect the clip board from the edit menu\n\n*\n\n*Show Clipboard\n\nThere’s also a tool pbv which handles rich text better than the pbpaste command does.\n", "Q: How do i get full capacity from Fusion drive on vmWare ESXi 6.0 Mac Mini 7,1 I managed to install the free vmWare ESXi 6.0 hypervisor on a Mac Mini 7,1. It's running rather nicely from a USB memory.\nThe mini has a 2TB Fusion drive. My problem is that i can only get the 106 GB SSD drive to show for datastorage, not the remaining spinning platter capacity. Going to Configuration -> Storage -> Add storage will not discover any more disk (as won't connecting a USB3 HDD to the mac, but that doesn't quite surprise me).\nWhat should i do to get all the disk capacity to use?\n\nA: The ESXi 6.0.0 update 2 solves this problem. The Fusion disk is recognised as two separate disks (which they in fact are). With that, i now have two datastores, one on the SSD and another one on the HDD.\nWhat i usually do is install the guests on small virtual disks on the SSD datastore and give them a larger chunk on the HDD datastore.

Recently I needed more space on the Mac partition and whiled loaded only in the Windows partition, I have shrank my Windows partition by 10 Gb using Windows disk management tool.\nNow I can no longer start up the Boot Camp bridge while in the Mac OS X side to access the Windows partition. I suspect the Boot Camp file no longer recognize this modified Windows partition.\nIs there a quick to solve this issue without having to reinstall everything?\n\nA: This error occurred because in a Boot Camp setup, your hard drive has a hybrid GPT/MBR partition table, which is unsupported by Microsoft.  When you resized the partition in Windows, it only modified the MBR partition table because it was unaware that the GPT table existed.  You now have a situation where the GPT partition table and the MBR partition table disagree about the start/end boundaries of the Windows partition.\nTo fix this, you will need to use the gpt command line tool, and for that you must boot from OS X install media (either a USB flash drive, or Internet Recovery if your model supports that feature -- the recovery partition will not work for this).\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from OS X install media and open up a command prompt.\n\n*Type fdisk /dev/disk0 to see the MBR partition table. Write down\nthe partition number (it's usually 4), the start sector, and the\nsize of the Windows partition. The start sector and size will be big\nnumbers so make sure you write them down correctly.  This is\ncritical.\n\n*Type diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk0  This will unmount the disk\nso GPT can write to it.\n\n*Type gpt remove -i 4 /dev/disk0 NOTE that the '4' here\nreferences the partition number of your Windows partition you got\nfrom fdisk earlier.  This will delete the GPT partition entry for\nyour Windows partition (but not the MBR entry)\n\n*Type fdisk -d /dev/disk0 >/Volumes/fdisk.txt  This will  make a\nbackup of the MBR partition table.\n\n*Type fdisk -e /dev/disk0  This will put the fdisk command in\ninteractive edit mode. You will need to enter the following input.\nNOTE that the '4' here references the partition number of your Windows partition you got from fdisk earlier.  This will delete\nthe MBR partition entry for your Windows partition.\ne 4\n0\nq\ny\n\n\n*Type diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk0 again because the gpt\ncommand caused OS X to remount the disk and we need to modify it\nagain.\n\n*Type gpt add -b <start sector> -s <size> -i 4 -t windows\n/dev/disk0 where 'start sector', 'size', and '4' are the values you\nwrote down from the fdisk command earlier.\n\n*For good measure, type gpt show /dev/disk0 to view the GPT table. \nMake sure the partition number, start sector, and size match the\nfdisk output from step 2 EXACTLY.\n\n*Type diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk0 again because the gpt\n command caused OS X to remount the disk and we need to modify it\n again.\n\n*Type fdisk -r -y /dev/disk0 </Volumes/fdisk.txt This will undo\n the changes made in step 6.\n\n*For good measure, type fdisk /dev/disk0 to view the MBR table.

Otherwise it charges properly and battery duration is normal.\nThis is the product by the way: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Magnetic-Charger-MacBook-Retina-Display/dp/B00BJ97CWU\nThanks!\n\nA: A blinking LED is not a signal that the original MagSafe Power Adapter would output, so it's hard to say why it does that, perhaps contact the manufacturer. But it sounds like there's something wrong with the adapter.\nIt is technically possible that a faulty power supply hurts your battery or even your machine (as in logic board, etc.).

I want to edit some com.myApp.plist. I'm running OS 10.10.3, and I do have Xcode installed. But every time I try to edit the file, it's locked and I can't save my changes.\nIf I try to save it with Xcode, Xcode asks if I want to unlock it. I say \"Unlock\", but then an error says The file \"com.myApp.plist\" could not be unlocked.\"; it says that this is because I do not own it.\nIf I open the file in Sublime Text, its just the object code. \nHow can I make changes to the file? \nI have tried sudo chown $USER com.myApp.plist followed by sudo chmod u+w com.myApp.plist.

Doesn't work.\nNot sure what else to do. I could try something like \"apply to enclosing folders\" but that seems dangerous. \n\nA: You probably need to add an ACL to the immediately enclosing folder too. \nNot certain about the entire path, but you could always later remove with\nsudo chmod -R -N /path… at the highest directory level you reached to enable it, which will remove ACLs from the entire directory tree at & below your /path...\n\nA: The main reason that chmod didn't remove the lock is because you didn't have permission in the enclosing folder. It's like in a real world example: You cannot access a package in a room that you can only see to, and don't have the keys to.\nSimple Answer:\nClick once on the file, copy it. Then paste it into your desktop. Edit it. The lock will not be there. Then, just plop it back into private/var/db This will ask for your admin authentication.\nLess simple answer with use of terminal:\nBefore you dive in, make sure you edit every path to the path that your .plist is actually in\nFirst, get info on enclosing folder, say that it is right in /private/var/dbThen db would be the enclosing folder So:\nchmod -R 777 /private/var/db\n\nThen Open up terminal and execute:\nsudo chmod 777 /private/var/db/somefile.plist\n\n", "Q: Finder keeps crashing even in Yosemite 10.10.3 I have had a lot of crashes by Finder especially when trying to delete a file.

I have been using alfred for a long time. \nI currently using Yosemite 10.10.2\n\n\nA: It seems perfectly normal. If you have deleted files from another OS, if you want to get back to stability, boot to recovery HD and repair the OS X partition. Then boot to OS X and download the latest combo updater and reboot.\nI'd add the Mac partition to spotlight's privacy tab and close system prefs. Then I'd remove it from the privacy tab and let it sit for about 30 minutes and then run the combo updater.\nAs long as you have a backup of your files, worst case is you'll end up with a corrupt OS X side and have to wipe and reinstall. If you want to download the latest OS X installer during the 30 minute wait above, it's nice to have it on a USB thumb drive just in case.

Can the same logic be used for third party apps?\n\n\nA: Apple adds an access control entry to some apps, that denies delete access to the \"everyone\" group:\n$ ls -lde /Applications/App\\ Store.app\ndrwxr-xr-x+ 3 root  wheel  102 Feb 16 22:21 /Applications/App Store.app\n 0: group:everyone deny delete\n\nHowever, if the user you're trying to keep from deleting this is an administrator, they can remove ACLs, and then delete things freely. Admins can also remove or disable launch daemons. Basically, if someone has admin rights on the computer, they can get around your attempts to lock things down. See this previous question where CommaToast makes a valiant effort at figuring out how to lock something down against an opponent with admin rights... but I can still think of ways around his measures.\nOn the other hand if they're not an admin, then it's trivial: they can't delete things from /Applications anyway.\n", "Q: Does the new photos app still try to recognise faces?

I also tried plugging the laptop into another display with HDMI and that one also worked fine. Unfortunately, I don't have access to another display that has a DP port. My research prior to purchasing the laptop and monitor suggested that I should be able to connect them easy-peasy and get 4K at 60hz using either MST or SST signalling. However, I am very new to Macs, so my question is whether or not I need to do something special to get this to work? A Thunderbolt to DP cable perhaps?

I did a spotlight search for \"Xcode\" to find the previous version, and the user license agreement popped up.  Once I agreed, the installation finished.\n\nA: I encountered this exact problem myself and the only advice I can give you is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log out of App Store. Store > Sign out.\n\n*Restart your computer, hold down Command R and wait till disk utility appears. Then close the window, select your disk and finish the restart.\n\n*Relaunch appstore, log in, and restart again, no disk utility this time.\n\n*Then start Update/Download, make sure to monitor your computer and do NOT let it fall asleep. All done.\nHope this helps. This worked for me.\n\nA: Sometimes XCode updates depend on an OS \"Tools\" Update. If a separate OS update is available, install that update first before attempting to update XCode.\n\nA: I reviewed /private/var/log/install.log to find the error and couldn't find one,  so I removed it, and reran the install from the app store panel and it worked. \nDunno what and if something else had changed. \n\nA: None of the above worked for me.  I tried all of it (Shut off all anti-virus apps; deleted old downloads, rebooted; turned on App Store Debug;  debugged to the lowest level; restarted the App Store; cleared cookies; sacrificed a chicken to the Xcode gods) but no joy.\nI did find this following line in my /var/log/commerce.log at the time the install failed:\nblah blah:SoftwareMap: No app was found with bundle ID com.apple.dt.Xcode to upgrade to 7.3.1\nNow I have never had Xcode on my machine before, and that line suggests that the download (and install) failed because it was an UPGRADE and I did not have the previous version.\nThoughts PLEASE???\n", "Q: Key Needs to be Pressed Repeatedly to Start Working When I leave my computer alone for around five minutes, to get the \"w\" key to function I need to spam press it, after which it starts functioning correctly. Holding down the key for ~10 seconds also works. Thoughts?\n\nA: If there is a software issue - you could replicate it with an external keyboard.\nIt's likely a failure in the wiring or mechanics of the keyboard. Depending on how close the Apple Store is, you might have them check for lint or debris under the key cap.\nYou could DIY - but the pieces are very, very fragile and you might be out some $$ to order a replacement if you break things checking it out.\nAt the store, they usually have spares on hand and can order the right parts on their dime if they break it during cleaning / servicing.\n", "Q: Does Photos.app support a watch directory? Is it possible for Photos to automatically include all files in a given directory as part of its Library? Picasa, for example, offers this.\nI have a folder on my computer that is automatically synced to other devices via an online service (e.g. Dropbox, OneDrive, etc). Although I can manually import those files into Photos, that requires performing the import every time new files are added to that directory.\nI have tried creating a new Photos library (holding down Option on launch) in the directory mentioned earlier to see if it might magically add all the files there, but that has no effect.\n\nA: Photos does not currently support a watch directory - meaning that all photos have to be imported manually (by dragging and dropping onto the Photos window or File > Import...) or via iCloud Photo Library or My Photo Stream.\n", "Q: How to mitigate CVE-2015-1130 (Hidden Backdoor with Root) due to lack of Apple support? This is related to CVE-2015-1130, a.k.a Hidden backdoor API to root privileges in Apple OS X. It appears Apple has refused to fix it in OS X 10.9 and earlier. Emil Kvarnhammar, the one who reported this vulnerability to Apple states:\n\nApple indicated that this issue required a substantial amount of\n  changes on their side, and that they will not back port the fix to\n  10.9.x and older.\n\nI have an OS X 10.8.5 machine and an OS X 10.9 machine. I can't upgrade either machine due to requirements outside of my and Apple's control.\nIn the absence of Apple patching OS before 10.10, how can we mitigate this on OS X 10.8 and OS X 10.9 machines?\n\nA: I would say it's simply not possible. \nIt apparently took Apple months of effort to close this door. They specifically asked the reporter to hold long past the accepted announcement embargo period, in order to give them sufficient time to fix it before it went public. They say the reason for not back-porting it to earlier OSes is the sheer amount of effort involved.  \nIf they can't do it, I doubt anyone else could.  \nIf it could be even slightly mitigated by any action on your part, I'm fairly sure there would have been advice from them to that effect.\n", "Q: Cannot transfer rented movie from iPod to computer? I rented a movie on my iPod touch 5th gen and want to sync it to my computer so I can watch it there. It won't transfer however. What do I do? Do I have to rent it again on my computer?\n\nA: Per Apple, if you rent a movie on an iOS device or AppleTV, you cannot move it to another device or computer.\n(The reverse, however, is possible - you can rent on a computer then transfer to an iOS device.)\n", "Q: How to turn off emojis entirely on iOS? A lot of emojis replace characters that I already use, usually imported from a symbol keyboard; but it doesn't mesh well with monospaced, small, or formatted text; for example, I like to flavor my documents with text art (art made (usually) from a monospaced font, and its characters).\nSuch characters include;↔↕↖↗↘↙➡⬅⬆⬇⚪⚫⬛⬜, in this case (on my end) some of them worked properly. the rate at which this happens is inconsistent, even in the same document!\n\nA: Why do the same characters show up with a ‘text presentation’ in some situations and an ‘emoji presentation’ in others?\nThere is both a ‘text style’ and ‘emoji style’ for U+25B6 BLACK RIGHT-POINTING TRIANGLE (▶). Whichever style you get depends on whatever style the font you’re currently using has. For example, the font Apple Color Emoji has an ‘emoji style’ glyph for U+25B6 BLACK RIGHT-POINTING TRIANGLE while the font Lucida Grande has a ‘text style’ glyph for U+25B6 BLACK RIGHT-POINTING TRIANGLE. This is fine in a text editor, where you have control over whatever font you’re using for each character, but not in contexts where you don’t.\nHow can I specify whether or not I want the ‘text presentation’ or ‘emoji presentation’ for a codepoint in contexts where I have no control over the font?\nThe Unicode Consortium actually provided a solution for this issue in Unicode 6.1, detailed in this Unicode Technical Report.\nEssentially, they’ve designated two codepoints as emoji variation selectors: U+FE0E VARIATION SELECTOR-15 (for a text presentation) and U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16 (for an emoji presentation).\nLet me explain how they work. Whenever you enter one of those two variation selectors in a text field (whether through copy-pasting or other means), the text rendering system of your operating system—one conforming to the Unicode Standard, v6.1+—will change the glyph (through font substitution, if necessary) for the character immediately preceding the variation selector you just entered to one matching either ‘text style’ or ‘emoji style’ (depending on which variation selector you entered after the emoji).\nHere’s a demonstration:\n▶︎ (U+25B6 U+FE0E)\n▶️ (U+25B6 U+FE0F)\nFor people viewing this page on older operating systems, I’ve included some images below demonstrating the behaviour in a normal text box on OS X v10.11 El Capitan. \nThe system font on OS X v10.11 (which is San Francisco), has no glyph for U+25B6 BLACK RIGHT-POINTING TRIANGLE, so OS X’s text rendering system automatically performs font substitution and ends up using the Lucida Grande UI font instead, which happens to have a 'text style' glyph for U+25B6:\n\nUsing U+FE0E VARIATION SELECTOR-15 immediately after it forces it to be ‘text style’, so the result is the same:\n\nUsing U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16 immediately after it instead results in OS X’s text rendering system using a font with an ‘emoji style’ glyph for U+25B6 BLACK RIGHT-POINTING TRIANGLE instead, which happens to be the Apple Color Emoji font:\n\n(For the curious, the screenshots are showing the indispensable Split Up utility in UnicodeChecker).\n\nA: You can't. Emojis are part of iOS and can't be disabled.\n\nA: Messages on the Mac has an option to not replace conventional smileys with emoji.\nEdit > Substitutions > Emoji\nI have this switched off on my Mac & if I type ;-) that's what is transmitted.\nIf I do the same on my iPhone, the same happens, only ;-) is transmitted & received.\nI have no recollection of changing that behaviour on the phone, nor can I find any option that would let me - & changing it on the Mac doesn't appear to affect the phone.\nTom Gewecke is right, though, in so much as if the receiving device is not another iPhone, their device may auto-translate into emoji, over which you have no control.\nThe other thing is that you also have no control over what font is being used by the receiving device.\nHaving said all that, I was assuming you were talking about iMessage, but I realise that's not clear from your question. Maybe clarifying in which app you mean may change this & other answers.\nAlso, as far as I can see, none of those symbols you used are actually emoji, simply higher ascii or possibly unicode [I didn't check every one]\n", "Q: Which version of Windows will run on an iMac 24\" early 2009 model? I have an iMac 24\", early 2009 model with 2.66 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo and 4 GB RAM running OS X Yosemite.  I need to setup my Boot Camp and have done a lot of research, learned a lot but still unsure on a couple of points.  \nBased on my iMac's hardware, Microsoft tech support recommended the 64 bit version of Windows 8.1 Pro.  With Boot Camp Assistant 5.1.3, I tried and kept getting an error message that my Boot Camp only support Windows 7.\nI did see that on the Apple's Boot Camp Support site, my iMac model can only run 32 bit Windows 7.  However, on the EveryMac.com, it stated that some users reported success in running the 64 bit version with the correct drivers.\nSo here's my questions:\n1.  Which drivers are they talking about?\n2. Is my version (5.1.3) of Boot Camp Assistant the wrong one to use and that's why it failed to install the Windows 8.1 64 bit version?\nUltimately, I like to know which version of Windows (7 or 8, 32 or 64 bit) can I successful install using which version of Boot Camp Assistant?\nI'd appreciate any suggestions or advices.\n\nA: I managed to install Windows 8.1 Pro on my early 2009 24 inch iMac yesterday. Just a disclaimer: I DID NOT USE BOOT CAMP ASSISTANT TO INSTALL. For 2 days straight I troubleshooted boot camp assistant to try to get it to take my Windows 8.1 Pro to no avail. Out of frustration I googled 'how to run windows on a mac WITHOUT boot camp.' After finding a guide online, in a matter of about 30 minutes I had successfully installed Windows 8.1 Pro on my 2009 iMac. Here is the link to the guide....you can ask me any questions regarding this. \nSee \"How To Install Windows 8.1 On Mac Without Boot Camp\".\n\nA: According to the Apple Web site \"System requirements to install Windows on your Mac via Boot Camp\", your need \"Boot Camp Support Software 4.0.4033\". The web site also shows the only Windows operating system supported is Window 7 32-bit.\nHowever, you may be able to run Windows 8.1 64-bit on your iMac. To find out, you will have to try using the instructions found at \"Using Boot Camp Support Software 4.0.4033 to install 64 bit Windows 7 or 8\". I have tested the instructions on windows 7 Pro and 8 Pro, but not yet on 8.1 Pro. Although, I am currently running Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit on via a Microsoft Store upgrade. Also, note my iMac is a 20-inch, Mid 2007.\nAs for your questions, let us go through them.\n\n\n*\n\n*Which drivers are they talking about? Boot Camp Support Software\n4.0.4033\n\n*Is my version (5.1.3) of Boot Camp Assistant the wrong one to use\nand that's why it failed to install the Windows 8.1 64 bit version?\nNo\n\n*Ultimately, I like to know which version of Windows (7 or 8, 32 or\n64 bit) can I successful install using which version of Boot Camp\nAssistant? My guess would be all of them, provided you do not use\nany version of the Boot Camp Assistant. Both my 2007 and 20011 iMacs can.\n\n\nOk, I probably should elaborate. If the Boot Camp Assistance wants to cooperate, go ahead and use it. If it does not, then either you can not physically do what you are attempting OR Apple does not want you to. If you do not use the Boot Camp Assistant, then here are the general steps for your computer. \n\n\n*\n\n*Download the \"Boot Camp Support Software\n4.0.4033\" to a flash drive.\n\n*Create a MS-DOS (FAT) formated partition on your internal drive. The\nDisk Identifier for the partition must end in a number less than or\nequal to 4.\n\n*Bless the partition. This is done using the bless command in a\nTerminal window.\n\n*Insert the DVD and reboot the computer. Hold down the Option key\nduring the reboot and select the DVD to boot from.\n\n*Install Windows.\n\n*Insert the flash drive and install the \"Boot Camp Support Software\".\n\n\nPlease, let me know how things work out.\n\nA: I used bootcamp.  But still did research to make sure i installed it well.  It was successful.  I'm now running windows7 64 bit on a 2010 iMac core duo 3ghz with 4gb ram.  Bootcamp will really be tricky.  You have to have experience in hard drive partitioning.  And yah do research.  Like I found out that once bootcamp is setup you have to press the OPTION/alt key when your iMac restarts so you could get into the DRIVE CHOICE MENU where you will see your windows drive. What bootcamp does is do the preliminary tasks indicated in the link shared by David above.\n", "Q: mpd stuttering when run under launchd Background\nAs a terminal junkie, I've started messing around with a combination of mpd (Music Player Daemon) and a player, ncmpcpp (NCurses Media Player Client C++).\nI installed these via Homebrew - a simple brew install mpd ncmpcpp. A bit of configuration later, and the apps are running quite nicely. The effect is actually rather impressive:\n\nThe problem I run into is when I want to run mpd automatically instead of having it launch in my terminal. It comes with a launchd plist, so I install that, and it appears to work - The problem is that whatever I'm playing, be that an MP3, streaming audio from a server, or whatever, the audio stutters every 5 seconds\nThis absolutely does not happen when mpd is invoked directly from the command line, only when it's fired off via launchd.\nHere's what the plist looks like:\n<!--homebrew.mxcl.mpd.plist-->\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>homebrew.mxcl.mpd</string>\n    <key>ProcessType</key>\n    <string>Interactive</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/usr/local/opt/mpd/bin/mpd</string>\n        <string>--no-daemon</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>WorkingDirectory</key>\n    <string>/usr/local</string>\n</dict>\n\n \nThe ProcessType interactive was added by me in an attempt to force launchd to give the daemon higher priority, to no effect.\nDebugging?\nIf we dtruss the process, there is a huge blast of identical gettimeofday messages correlated with every stutter. It looks like this:\ngettimeofday(0x10A03FD40, 0x0, 0x1000)       = 1428698761 0\n\nThings I've already eliminated\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU / Disk IO\n\n\nThe system is relatively quiet - during the stutters, mpd is not even on the top 25 for memory or CPU usage, and load is well below 1.0\n\n\n*\n\n*Incorrect environment causing bad config settings to be loaded\n\n\nMy mpd config is the one being loaded from ~/.mpdconf - same as it is when I run it by hand.\nThis appears to be a symptom of the way launchd chooses to handle the process.\nThe ultimate question\nWhy is the daemon so misbehaved when run under launchd, but not when run via terminal? \nBonus question:\nWhat about the way launchd kicks off processes could be making this behavior manifest?\n\nA: I had the similar issue and google led me to this thread.

I'am an iPhone + PC (Windows/Ubuntu) user. Nowadays, I'm used to download photos from iPhone to local folder, sort them and then backup them by myself (by syncing to remote disk and burning onto bluray discs also).\nI like an idea of iCloud Photo Library + optimizing a storage on iPhone. For me, this also means that original photos are moved from iPhone storage into cloud, so I won't be able to download them via USB.\nSo, will it be possible (and easy and comfortable) to download all new photos (100+ at once) from iCloud Photo Library to local disk on PC? I mean a) download and keep on iCloud (copy), b) download and delete from iCloud (move)?\n\nA: I downloaded the icloud manager app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204283.\nThen in bottom right control panel on Windows (where the printer, volume, and wifi icons are located) clicked on the icloud icon then download photos then you can select ALL or by year. \nThis method doesn't prompt a thousand save as windows like doing it via icloud.com does.\n\nA: You can, by going to iCloud.com/#photos. Once there:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click 'Select Photos' to go into selection mode\n\n*Select a photo\n\n*Shift-click another photo, to select the range between the first   selection and your last selection (just like in Windows/OS X, you can use Shift or Cmd/Ctrl to choose exactly what you like).\n\n*Click 'Download' at the top blue bar.\n\n\nA: The best I've seen is that you can download a \"moment\" at a time with the iCloud web interface, which in Chrome on a PC as of 9/23/2015, downloads a pile of individual images named \"IMG_XXXX.JPG\" to your downloads folder.  Tedious, but at least it's not as slow as downloading individual files.  \nI'm thinking of running a Hackintosh virtual machine on my home PC just for the purpose running the OS X Photos app and maintaining an archive of full-resolution images while enjoying the seamless synchronization and low-resolution local storage of images on my iPhone.  This is a key part of the \"Apple ecosystem\" that is denied to PC users that really annoys me.\n\nA: iCloud for Windows from Apple allows you to download photos from iCloud Photo Library by year.\nSet up and use iCloud Photo Library on your Windows PC:\n\nNew photos and videos you add to iCloud Photo Library will\nautomatically download to your PC. You can also download your\ncollection by year when you follow these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Open a File Explorer window.\n\n*Under Favorites, click iCloud Photos.\n\n*Click Download Photos.\n\n*Choose the photos and videos you want to download and click Download.\n\n*Your photos and videos download to the location you set in iCloud\nPhotos Options.\n\n\n\nA: I just found a great way, this might be the longest method but it works toda.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install iCloud for Windows\n\n*Sign with Apple ID, complete the setup, etc.\n\n*click the icloud icon in the taskbar and hit \"Download Photos\" below iCloud photos. \n\n*They will be in icloudphotos/download\n\n\nA: I highly recommend ndbroadbent's fantastic Python program the icloud_photos_downloader project. The project repository can be found at his Github account: https://github.com/ndbroadbent/icloud_photos_downloader. \nThere are some great instructions on installation and use in the project README.

It makes it harder to see a folder/file name when it is truncated or non-wrapped.\nSo as an example; Williams Grand Prix Engineering Limited looks like Williams...ted as a folder title and I would much rather prefer to have it look like the old style;\nWilliams Grand Prix\nEngineering Limited\nIs there a setting somewhere or a terminal command in Snow Leopard where I can make this change? I have tried to explain to Apple Care multiple times, but they were stupid enough to not even know what the word truncate meant after I explained it and \"wrapping\" thoroughly.\nAlso, please do not suggest the use of just the other List views in My Finder, my inquiry is for the Icon view only as this is the only view which I use. It is such an important feature for me that it is pushing me to go back to Leopard 10.5 just to have that. \n\nA: With me (El Capitan) the following works fine:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder MaximumLabelLines 2; killall Finder\n\nOn my oldie iBook-G3, Tiger-OS 10.4.11, it is:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder FXMaximumLabelLines 2; killall Finder\n\nHere's a goodie for \"Tigers\" who'd like to have icon text to the RIGHT on their desktop, too:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder DesktopViewOptions -dict-add PropertiesLocation rght; killall Finder\n\n(BELOW is: \"botm\")\nMoreover you can define icons' grid spacing on your Tiger's desktop this way:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder FXLabelHorizontalPad [# of pixels]; killall Finder\ndefaults write com.apple.finder FXLabelVerticalPad [# of pixels]; killall Finder\n\nFor [# of pixels] insert a number -- try lower ones first (3 - 10) as they add up with lots of icons…\n\nA: I found this website that explains how to do it through terminal. Try it out on your Snow Leopard. It unfortunately didn't work for me on Yosemite, but it says the FX variant is as of 10.6, so you might be in luck.\n\ndefaults write com.apple.finder MaximumLabelLines 2\ndefaults write com.apple.finder FXMaximumLabelLines 2\n\nThis changes the maximum number\n  of lines a label will wrap to in icon view. 2 is the default, but\n  maybe you want more. The first version applies in older versions of\n  Mac OS X, and the second version (with the 'FX') applies as of 10.6,\n  but I'm not sure exactly when the change occured.\n\nLet me know if it works out for you!\nPS: Make sure to add ; killall Finder to the end of that command, or just call killall Finder after running it. That will force restart Finder in order for it to load the changes.

I made an App Preview video only for the iPad resolution and uploaded it to iTunes Connect.

With Yosemite, when I turn my system on, I am given the login screen immediately.\nDoes this indicate that the hard drive is not encrypted and therefore not decrypting? The FileVault option in Preferences shows that FileVault is on.\n\nA: The immediate login screen is part of the process of FileVault. Once you type your password into your user account it takes that extra bit of time to show a progress bar. That is it \"decrypting\" / reading the drive.\nIf you mean the giant padlock screen with a password, that is actually part of the Firmware Password, which you would enable by booting into recovery and clicking on the Utilities menu bar option.\n", "Q: How to access Edit functionality in new Photos application?

A disk's data directory seems to me to be the most vulnerable Achilles's Heel to protecting data.\nWith the 2 clicks of an accidental quick erase and format via Disk Utility, the roadmap to potentially multiple terabytes of data gets erased.\nEven if zero data files were overwritten and all of the data files get recovered (though it may take days), (please, please correct me if I'm wrong) data recovery software can't retrieve the filenames, folder names, and the organizational, hierarchical structure, which then can only be painstakingly rebuilt by hand.\nRelative to the size of the data, the directory is tiny. Wouldn't recovering a backup of the directory (that should always be automatically made as a fail-safe whenever an erase/format is done) make complete recovery fast and easy?\nThis seems waaayyyy too obvious to be overlooked, but everything I read indicates that with 1 click, it's gone and can't be recovered!\nIs there any way to recover a disk's catalog directory after a Quick Erase?\n\nA: That's how companies like\nProsoft (Data Recovery),\nMicromat (Tech Tool),\nCleverfiles (Disk Drill) &\nAlsoft (DiskWarrior)\nmake their money.\nThey each have different ways of protecting or recovering your data.\nData Rescue & Disk Drill are designed to recover files after the type of incident you mentioned.\nTech Tool goes further, by cataloguing each partition on every other partition, so it has a 'map' of where things were if anything goes wrong.\nDiskWarrior concentrates on being able to rescue & rebuild damaged directory & filesystem information.\nAll are exemplary tools to use for different types of disaster & in my opinion all worth the expenditure.\nHowever - nothing is better than a good backup strategy.\nTime Machine in-house, for if a drive goes down.\nBackblaze or CrashPlan for off-site backup, in case the worst happens & the house goes up in flames.\nThis is not a comprehensive list, just the ones I use or would recommend personally.\n", "Q: Macbook pro 2009 update not taking effect I downloaded the update for OS X Yosemite 10.10.3.

How do I solve this?\n\nA: In the Updates section of the App Store, if the 10.10.3 update is fully downloaded, the \"Update\" button next to it should be replaced by a \"Restart\" button. Click it, then click \"Restart\" on the notification that'll come up in the upper right of the screen, and then a restart will happen and the update will be installed.\n\nA: If for some reason an update appears to be stuck, even after following user24601's advice, then the next thing to try would be to download & run the standalone OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 Combo Update which contains all updates since 10.10.0 & usually will bring things back into line.\n", "Q: Can Startup Manager be used to boot Linux operating systems? This is a pretty simple question and I'm thinking the answer is no, but can Mac's Startup Manager be used to boot Linux based operating systems?  I'll probably end up installing a tool like rEFInd later on but I want to double check first.\n\nA: It should work if you don't have FileVault and if you plan to install it on a partition (which you probably do). You can just hold alt/option and it should show Macintosh HD, Recovery HD, and Linux (or whatever you named it). You can cycle through with arrows and hit enter to confirm. If that doesn't work, you might just install rEFInd :(\n", "Q: Can I preset the hibernation file size on a Mac so that it can always hibernate? The short version of the question is: is there a way to preset the hibernation file to be 8GB so that the Macbook Air can always hibernate?\nMy Macbook Air only has 256GB of SSD space, and right now it has about 3GB of free space.  And when the Macbook Air is not plugged in to the power, sometimes I come back and the machine is already powered down.\nIt used to be able to wake up from deep hibernation (writing all the RAM data to SSD), but I think because I have only 3GB of SSD space and there is 8GB of RAM, so there is not enough space, and as a result, I think Mac OS X actually did a shutdown instead of hibernate.  The bad thing is that in Google Chrome, I will lose all the webpages I opened.  I can look into history for them, but some pages were opened 3 days ago, and it is hard to hunt down every one of them.\nSo is there a way to preset the hibernation file to be 8GB so that next time I clean up the SSD and have 12GB, I won't accidentally use up 5GB and then the Macbook won't be able to hibernate again?  That is, reserve the space first, so that let's say if I clean up the Macbook Air to have 12GB of free space, immediate make the hibernation file 8GB, and then making the SSD only having 4GB to use?\n\nA: I don't think there is a way you can affect the size of the file /var/vm/sleepimage, which is the file created when the mac hibernates. You can move the location to which the file is saved to another drive instead of the boot volume using the command:\nsudo pmset -a hibernatefile /Volumes/OtherDrive/sleepimage\nThis other drive can be an external HD or perhaps a USB3 thumb drive. Another option is to purchase a Transcend Jetdrive to use for the sleepimage file, or, better yet, move files from the internal SSD to the Jetdrive. \nI have doubled the capacity of my 128GB MBAir using a Transcend Jetdrive and it is more than fast enough for iTunes and iPhoto libraries.\n", "Q: Turn emoji back to previous default after upgraded to iOS 8.3 Hello I just upgraded to iOS 8.3. My emoji is now default to kind of yellow colour, which is super annoying. Any ways I could set it back to previous default colour. Thank you!\n\nA: You can try holding down on the emoji you want and see if it brings up a menu to pick the skin color like this: \n \nThat feature is mainly only available on the more \"human\" looking emojis. Doing this will now set the default of that emoji to the color you chose, so I guess you could go through all of them and pick the one you want and they should stay as the new default instead of having to pick from the yellow one every time, but there isn't a way to \"revert back\" to 8.2 and earlier styles.\n", "Q: Notes on a different account (@gmail) and have icloud account.

However the notes are in different account and not on the icloud account and I am unable to see the notes when I login to my icloud account. I have notes back up turned on. Is there something I am doing wrong?\n\nA: I just found and fixed an issue that I had that may be related.  Somehow in settings on my iPhone I had Notes set with a default account of gmail.

With the introduction of OS X Yosemite every once in a while little snitch (network monitoring program) pops up a requestor asking for permission to allow nsurlsessiond a connection to some ip address. \nI understand that nsurlsessiond provides an API to allow any program using it to retrieve data via http or other supported protocol. In fact it acts like a proxy. \nIs it possible to see which programs are using nsurlsessiond and of course what they use it for?  I'm thinking of something like an access log file. Because in this current situation I am not able to do monitoring on applications using nsurlsessiond.\n\nA: The 'more details' button should at least tell you who it's trying to contact, from which you may be able to decide whether to allow.\nPossibly the main connections floater would give you more data…\n\nYou could always drop in a request to obdev or even see if there's anything in the forum\nI agree it would be a useful addition, to know what app is calling an API like that.\n\nA: The nsurlsessiond cache is at ~/Library/com.apple.nsurlsessiond and you can check the various configuration.plist and tasks.plist files to see which apps have active sessions.\n\nA: In System Preferences turn off \"automatically check for updates\" and \"download newly available updates in the background\" in the App Store Preferences \n", "Q: Safari, iTunes, Chrome etc. won't recognize root certificates after recent update to Safari 7.1.5 (Mavericks) After installing the most recent security and Safari updates (7.1.5) on Mavericks, Safari and other applications (those using NSURLConnection/CFURLConnection) no longer recognize any root certificates as valid. The root certificates in the System Roots keychain seem to be fine, as far as Keychain Access is concerned. However, Safari, iTunes, Chrome, etc. fail to validate all root certificates (\"This certificate was signed by an unknown authority\"). Already tried deleting the /var/db/crls/crlcache.db and /var/db/crls/ocspcache.db to no effect. System time is correct. Any ideas?\n\nA: Were able to solve the issue myself. For some reason, there were a few root certificates in my login Keychain, which have been revoked and replaced with newer certs in the System Roots keychain. Deleted those certs from my login keychain and everything works fine again.\n", "Q: How can carrier limit hot spot connections I have encountered this question and in accepted answer there is information that doesn't click\n\nFor instance, the iPhone 5 should theoretically be able to handle up to 14 connections, but both AT&T and Verizon limits it to 5.\n\nHow can carrier limit hot spot connections? \nTo clarify I own iPhone that uses sim card, and live in Europe.\n\nA: It's baked into the iOS as a configurable number and the carriers submit carrier profiles that contain their preferred limits.\nWhen the first iPhone came out there were legitimate concerns it would crash the carrier since they didn’t have controls to manage usage. This close alignment between the carriers and Apple exists to this day granting them control over many aspects of the radio configuration.\n\nA: There is a difference between theoretical and actual performance.\nTheoretically, the wireless hardware inside the iPhone may be able to do more than 5 connections at once, but Apple and the carriers have limited it to 5 for power and data usage reasons.  It's highly likely that having more than 5 connected devices would overwhelm your phone's battery, Wi-Fi radio, and cellular radio.\nThink about something like the CPU inside your phone: it can technically run at 1GHz or higher, but if iOS ran the CPU at full tilt all the time, your phone would get really hot and the battery would die really quickly.  Instead, iOS makes sure to only run the CPU at full tilt when you're doing something intensive (like photo editing or playing a game), and brings it back to low speed when you stop running the game (or the phone gets too hot).\nAs for carrier control, the iPhone (and cellular iPad) can download carrier profiles over-the-air and tell your phone how to connect to the cellular network and what restrictions exist (such as whether tethering is allowed or not).\n", "Q: Download iPhoto for Yosemite? How can I download the last iPhoto version for Yosemite?\nLooks like any links are invalid now that Photos is out.\nAnd upgrading a pre-Yosemite version does not work.

If yes, you should see it in App Store > Purchases tab.\nEDIT: The problem was: Clicking on \"Update\" button didn't update application.\nSolution: Delete and redownload application.\n\nA: Downloading from \"Purchases\" works for me (July 2015)\n", "Q: Is the iPhone 6 more powerful than a 1980s era Cray supercomputer? A friend today mentioned in conversation:\n\nYou know that iPhone 6 you're carrying in your pocket. It has more computing power than the Cray supercomputers of the 80s. \n\nThat sounded vaguely right, but I wasn't sure. \nMy question is: Is the iPhone 6 more powerful than a Cray supercomputer?\n\nA: It would really depend on which end of the 1980s we choose. A Cray 2, circa 1985 would be a good midline choice.\nCPU speed of the Cray-2 was about 250MHz, with what we would today call 4 cores. 256Megs of memory but at 64bits per address instead of 8, or as we would call it today 2 GB of RAM. In terms of raw power it has been compared to an iPad. that's if you use a CPU benchmark.\nHowever, supercomputers are usually optimized for parallel tasks or rather staggering amounts of input-output. It really isn't practical to say \"my phone could replace supercomputer X from year Y\" as they aren't capable of performing the same tasks. If we jump back a couple more generations we can say that an iPhone could have run the entire Apollo program assuming we hooked it up to a signal booster (and hold it the right way).\nThe iPhone beats the Cray hands-down in power consumption: 200 kW, 480 V 3-phase power coming in resulting in over 2000 amps internal power. Pressurized liquid cooling with an external heat exchanger the size of a car.\nLooks awesome sitting in your dedicated computing center though.\n", "Q: Where did \"Open in Safari\" go? Suddenly, the option to open in Safari is missing from my share menu. It's not even listed in the \"More\" options menu. The only unusual thing I've done recently is to install iCloud for Windows on my laptop at work. It never did fully install, however, so I'm not sure how that could affect anything as I sync to iTunes on a MacBook Air. \nThis is apparent in apps that use the horizontal icon-based share menu—e.g. Tweetbot or ABC News—the Safari option is gone. The share menu is different in other apps like Twitter or Facebook (where it's a vertical text list) and \"open in Safari\" is still an option in those.\nIs anyone else having this problem? I've tried Googling this with no success. I've also cleared all Safari data and tried a reset with no luck. \nWhat am I missing? I'm on an iPhone 6 running the latest iOS 8.3.\n\n\nA: One of the recent version update changelogs for Tweetbot states they made a change to the share sheet, which may in turn have caused a bug that is preventing Safari from showing up. This would best be reported to the developer of the app.\nIn iOS 8.x, a developer basically advertises \"I have this type of data to be shared, what apps can share it?\" The system responds with a list of apps that are capable of receiving that type of data. (Types can include text, a web URL, images, and so forth.) Depending on what type of data Tweetbot is advertising, it may not be compatible with what Safari says it can receive - Tweetbot might be advertising the URL in plain text format, whereas Safari might only be able to receive the URL specifically formatted as a URL.\n\nA: On iOS 9, it looks like Apple has intentionally removed the \"Open In...\" option on certain file extensions like PPT and XLS.\nIt has already been reported here: Cannot Save Documents in Safari?\nI have spoken to Apple Customer Support and they recommended to me several workarounds, which include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Converting the file into a PDF and reading it;\n\n*Using a third-party browser like Chrome, which brings back the \"Open In\" option.\n\n\nSecond option worked best for me.\n", "Q: Does the Buillt-in Apple Recovery Partition already have an OS X Image? Does the Buillt-in Apple Recovery Partition already have an OS X Image or does it download it over internet?\nI am asking because if it does download over the internet I want to create my own recovery partition from a Yosemite Install application.\n\nA: It has to download. In favor of saving space on your hard drive, the Recovery HD is 650 MB of various utilities including one to download and reinstall OS X.\n\nA: It has to download.  You can make a bootable partition that installs macOS using the free Install Disk Creator.  Just follow the instructions there on how to use it, but point it at a blank partition of 8GB or larger.\nSource:\nhttp://lifehacker.com/how-to-make-a-bootable-macos-sierra-usb-flash-drive-1786853248\n", "Q: Can't unlock Macbook after sleep until powering off and on The problem occurs after closing the lid of the laptop and it goes to sleep.

The new Photos.app does not come with Automator support (although there are third-party actions available). It does, however, have some basic AppleScript support, including support for importing a list of files.\n\nHowever, I can't get this action to work correctly. Any attempts to use it, such as via the following simple script\ntell application \"Photos\"\n    set theList to {\"/Full/Path/To/Some/Photo.jpg\"}\n    import theList\nend tell\n\nwill cause Photos.app to report that \"no metadata\" could be retrieved from the file because it may not be a photo (however, the same file can be manually imported). Further investigation reveals that the automated approach is failing due to the lack of permission to read the file.\nFrom the Console.app:\n4/11/15 9:07:49.333 AM sandboxd[253]: ([3934]) Photos(3934) deny file-read-data /Full/Path/To/Some/Photo.jpg\n\n(followed by a host of similar error messages). The third-party Automator actions I linked above have the same problem, for what it is worth.\nHow can I give the appropriate permission to Photos.app or the executing AppleScript/Automation workflow to perform this import? Note that the \"permission\" appears to be something other than (or in addition to) the usual file permissions, because setting the file and folder to \"read/write from by everybody\" (the nuclear option) does not change the behavior.\n\nA: Based on this from an old Applescript Release Notes on sandboxing…\n\nWhen sending commands to a sandboxed application, such as TextEdit in OS X Mountain Lion, parameters that refer to files must be of an explicit file-like type and not a bare string, or the target application will not be able to access the file. For example, file \"Macintosh HD:Users:me:sample.txt\", POSIX file \"/Users/me/sample.txt\", or the result of choose file would all be acceptable, but the string \"/Users/me/sample.txt\" would not.\n\n& \n\nNote: As mentioned under Compatibility above, sandboxed applications will not be able to access files referred to in commands using a string path. Any parameters or properties in your application that refer to files should be declared as type file, and not type text. Apple Event Manager will add sandbox extensions to events that have file-like parameters, but only if the parameter is of a recognized file-like type: typeAlias, typeFileURL, cFile, and so on. Without these extensions, the file will not be accessible from the target application’s sandbox, and the command will probably fail.\n\nIt would seem that the 'fix' is to use POSIX file to prevent the sandbox issue\nAfter some hammering at how to make Applescript work with POISIX file of a list, I came up with this…\ntweaked\nset theList to {\"/Volumes/Downloads/ScreenShot.png\", \"/Volumes/Downloads/ScreenShot2.png\", \"/Volumes/Downloads/ScreenShot3.png\"}\nset l to {}\nrepeat with f in theList\n    set l to l & (POSIX file f)\nend repeat\ntell application \"Photos\" to import l\n\nIt ain't perfect, as every import is a new one, but it works.\nNow works in one import.\n\nA: You can also insert this line anywhere before the export line in your code:\nopen for access file f\n\nThis seemed to do the trick for me.\n", "Q: iOS Xcode development on MacBook Air 2015 I am deciding to get a 2015 MacBook Air for iOS development, and was wondering how well my specs on the custom macbook I am ordering.

System information gave you the info about the device but not any way to edit it, or in my case delete it.\nThanks for your help. Problem resolved.\n\nA: By any chance do you mean delete everything on the MyBook Studio drive?\nIf so open Disk Utility, select the drive in the left-hand pane and then click the \"Erase\" tab, select the format you want (best bet: Mac OS Extended (Journaled)) and click erase.\nEverything (and I mean everything) on that drive will vanish in a cloud of unseen bytes.\n\nA: Deleting all history is hard. There are log files, backup logs, stored spotlight hooks to identify that disk's \"fingerprint\" so that Time Machine can know it's connected again. There can be thousands of drives named the same as your drive, but you Mac will only back up to that drive (or one with the same randomly generated ID).\nIn practice, just open Time Machine preferences and turn off that backup drive / delete it as a destination.\nThe interface to do this has changed in recent OS X versions, so use the built in help for specific guidance. If you want to ask a follow on question with a screen shot / details about your OS level and version, someone can assist further.\n", "Q: Simple telnet session fails on OS X I am learning Postfix and how it works with SMTP, and here's a sample session that the book shows as an example:\n\nI ran the command hostname on my Mac terminal, and it showed <some_id>.ant.amazon.com (it is my office laptop). So I tried\ntelnet  <id>.ant.amazon.com 25\n\nAnd I got the error message: \n<id>.ant.amazon.com: nodename nor servname provided, or not known\n\nThen I tried telnet 10.232.45.151 25 as well.

How do I have a session like the one shown in the picture?\n\nA: If you do not have a mail server running then there is nothing listening on port 25. Thus connection refused messages. So you need to run the mail server first.\nAlso unless you work for Amazon your hostname is not .ant.amazon.com  If you do ask your network admins.\nAnd this bit is a comment - I think you need to learn what telnet does before you start trying to run services.\n", "Q: iTunes on iMac won't start up after upgrade (error -10699) Yesterday I updated iTunes in my iMac running OS X 10.10.3. According to the information in App Store, the new iTunes version is 12.1.2.\nSince then iTunes won't start up. If I click on it, there is no response.\nI figured that there is probably a known problem with the upgrade, and that this would be fixed in due course. However, I've been monitoring discussions, and there does not seem to be anything else who is having this problem.\nSome research I did on how to solve this problem was to trash the iTunes preferences, and to download and re-install iTunes: I did both, but it still won't start up.\nNothing is logged on any error logs as far as I can see. I did a \"tail -f /var/log/system.log\" in Terminal App and then attempted to start iTunes, no messages were displayed.\nWhen I try and open iTunes from terminal (\"open -a iTunes\"), I get a message:\n\"LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed for the application /Applications/iTunes.app with error -10699.\"\nOpen With Role sounds as if there might be a permissions problem, I've repaired permissions with Disk Utility, and I've also tried starting iTunes from the command line using sudo, but no luck.\nAt this stage I've run out of ideas. Anybody else have an idea what I could try? \n\nA: I had the same problem and was able to solve it by deleting iTunes and reinstalling.\nThe Finder tries quite hard to stop you from deleting iTunes; instead you can open Terminal.app and 'sudo rm -rf /Applications/iTunes.app'. You can download the replacement copy of iTunes from https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/\n\nA: As a temporary solution, you can execute iTunes binary directly by doing /Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/MacOS/iTunes in the terminal.\nCode -10699 returned by open -a iTunes indicates some error in Launch Services (similar error codes are documented but the very thing is not). Executing binary in this way somehow sidesteps the problem.\n", "Q: Move Bootcamp to external drive - restored, fdisk - still not recognized as bootable!

Windows can ONLY run from an internal, non-removable hard drive.  That limitation applies even on a real PC.\n\nA: Thank you both for your replies, they helped my investigation. (David Anderson and Wes Sayweed)\nThere are many reports of both W7 and W8 running bootable from an external drive. I hoped that with the proper disk setup, activation, and EFI settings I could accomplish this, but I have discovered the barrier: you need a usb3 or thunderbolt connection, it cannot be done with usb2 by a limitation of windows itself.\nBTW, W8.1 officially includes support for booting from an external drive. Running W7 that way appears to require a couple extra steps.\n", "Q: How do I determine how full a remote volume is? I use a remote volume on my wife's Mac Mini as a shared music library.

What i'm asking is can iPhoto do any thing that the new photos app can't?\n\nBasically, should I keep using iPhoto or should I start using the new photos app?\n\nA: No, the photo app has all all the features iPhoto has (and more) and apple has discontinued iPhoto. Not to mention the design is much better and it has iCloud photo library implemented in it.\n", "Q: In Photos, how can I auto-split events upon import? I am having several issues making sense of the new OS X 10.10.3 Photos app after using iPhoto for years.  I imported some photos and am used to them splitting events by date into separate \"Events.\"  I don't know what the equivalent is for \"Events\" in this new product.  Am I required to make a new album for each date if I want them separated?  Is there a \"manual\" of sorts for the new app?\n\nA: Events are deprecated. Your library is just shown in an interface with date & location (if available). If you want further organization you can (have to) create albums.\n\nA: If you haven't already, turn on the sidebar (View menu > Show Sidebar). At the top of the sidebar is a button labeled Photos. That will show you all of your photos divided by date (multiple \"events\", or photo groupings, for each date will appear if there is more than one location involved). Beyond that, no, there is no feature directly comparable to Events in iPhoto, though you can create albums if you want to combine multiple \"events\".\n", "Q: Why is my Mac slow after the OS X 10.10.3 update? I just installed OS X 10.10.3, and it is noticeably slower than 10.10.2.

Make sure you back up prior to doing this. Or, you can restore from your back up that you hopefully made prior to upgrading to 10.10.3.\n\nA: I had this same problem with everything running slow after installing 10.10.3. I read that if you open your preferences in \"Photo\" and clicking the \"Cloud\" tab, then unchecking anything that is checked within this tab, it will resolve the problem. That is what I did and so far everything is back to normal.

(Does the iPhoto database consider Last Import to be an \"event\"?)\nI can tell that the lone album is Last Import because:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've moved all other albums out of the folder, but it still says that there is one album left inside, even though the view shows that it is empty inside.\n\n*When I go back to the top-level album view, the iPhoto Events folder is shown to contain one album thumbnail unlike the inside view. The thumbnail within the folder matches the thumbnail of Last Import.\n\n*When I move photos out of Last Import and import a different set of photos, both thumbnails update.\nNow here's the bigger problem: if I delete the iPhoto Events folder now, I will lose the Last Import album permanently with no apparent way to get it back through the UI or the application's preferences. (I imagine I can get it back by editing either the app's plist in ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Photos/Data/Library/Preferences or one or more files in the package, but I'm not sure where to look.)\nI've tried\n\n\n*\n\n*importing new photos to see if Last Import will reappear, but it doesn't.\n\n*repairing the Photos library using the same method as iPhoto (hold Command ⌘ and Option ⌥ when opening the app), but it doesn't help.\n\n*repairing the iPhoto library before migrating to Photos, but it doesn't help either.\n\n*undoing the deletion, but it just brings back both Last Import and the iPhoto Events folder.\nI have re-imported the original iPhoto library for now so that its original state is preserved. What can I do to separate Last Import from the iPhoto Events folder so I can safely remove the latter?\n\nA: I created a fresh new iPhoto library, populated it with some photos, and migrated that library to Photos, but I could not reproduce this problem. So it looks like another problem with my original iPhoto library. Great.\nSo I decided to look directly in the Photos library database to see what was going on. The Photos library database can be found in ~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/Database/Library.apdb; this is an SQLite database that can be opened using the command-line sqlite3 tool, or any GUI you prefer.\nIf you're about to follow the steps in my answer past this point, remember to back up the library file before proceeding.\nThe schema for RKAlbum contains a folderUuid column that associates an album with a folder (in RKFolder). In the Photos library that was migrated from the fresh iPhoto library, the Last Import album looks like this:\nsqlite> SELECT name, folderUuid FROM RKAlbum WHERE name = 'Last Import';\nLast Import|LibraryFolder\n\nBut in the Photos library that was created from my original iPhoto library, the album looks like this:\nsqlite> SELECT name, folderUuid FROM RKAlbum WHERE name = 'Last Import';\nLast Import|cQeJj7YPRmSxHysWN+ql4w\n\nNotice that folderUuid here is a generated string and not 'LibraryFolder'. Obviously, this is an arbitrary folder — specifically the iPhoto Events folder that is created as part of the migration process. And sure enough:\nsqlite> SELECT uuid, name FROM RKFolder WHERE uuid = 'cQeJj7YPRmSxHysWN+ql4w';\ncQeJj7YPRmSxHysWN+ql4w|iPhoto Events\n\nAs an immediate workaround, changing the column directly seems to work:\nsqlite> UPDATE RKAlbum SET folderUuid = 'LibraryFolder' WHERE name = 'Last Import';\n\nNow opening Photos and deleting the iPhoto Events folder leaves Last Import intact. Importing new photos doesn't cause any further problems; the Last Import folder behaves as it always did, and should.\n\nOut of curiosity I decided to find out what was causing Photos to place Last Import in the iPhoto Events folder in the first place.\nTurns out, in my original iPhoto library, the folderUuid of Last Import was not 'LibraryFolder', but 'AllProjectsItem' — the same as the original Events category:\nsqlite> SELECT name, folderUuid FROM RKAlbum WHERE name = 'Last Import';\nLast Import|AllProjectsItem\nsqlite> SELECT name, folderUuid FROM RKAlbum WHERE folderUuid = 'AllProjectsItem';\nEvents|AllProjectsItem\nLast Import|AllProjectsItem\n\nThis is not the case in the fresh iPhoto library:\nsqlite> SELECT name, folderUuid FROM RKAlbum WHERE name = 'Last Import';\nLast Import|LibraryFolder\n\nFixing the incorrect column in the original iPhoto library database (with the same UPDATE statement as above) seems to fix the Last Import folder when migrating to Photos as well. I think I'll go with this instead since it corrects both the old and new libraries.\nLike in my previous question, I don't understand why or how my original iPhoto library reached that state in the first place, or why repairing/rebuilding the library didn't help at all. Was I bitten by a rare bug in iPhoto? Was I using iPhoto incorrectly? Either way, I'm lucky that I know a thing or two about SQLite and was therefore able to fix this on my own — if in the unlikely event someone has run into this very same issue, I hope this post will be helpful to them.\nOnce again, be sure to back up the entire library first.\n", "Q: Why am I experiencing random bluetooth disconnects? I have an iPad Air 2 64GB now running iOS 8.3. I've experienced problems where when using Keynote on my iPhone 5S to remote control a keynote presentation on my iPad, the connection will be dropped at random times during the presentation. I attributed this to Keynote bugs, but then my iPad also started randomly losing connections to my Logitech Ultrathin keyboard cover (the onscreen keyboard would appear) or I'd type a certain character and it would start repeating ad infinitum. I removed the interference factor from the equation by noticing that the problem would also occur within my office with thick walls and no bluetooth devices nearby … so I had Logitech replace the keyboard, but the connection drops still occur. I also reset all settings on my iPad, which didn't help.\nSo my next question is this: could the bluetooth hardware on my iPad Air 2 be flakey? Everything else about it works fine.\n\nA: It sounds like you are not alone and no fix in sight at the moment according to this report.\nHow to potentially fix iPad Bluetooth Problems\n\niOS 8 Bluetooth problems are among the most common iOS issues and they\nwere a big problem inside iOS 8.

It hasn’t worked for\neveryone but there are a ton of people that are claiming success after\ntrying it on their iPhone. It should work for Apple’s iPad as well.\nTo do this, open up the iPad and head to Settings > General > Reset >\nReset All Settings. This is going to take a bit of time and users will\nlose all saved settings but the pay off is that it seems to be fixing\nBluetooth issues for many people. It’s certainly worth a try if\nBluetooth keeps acting up after Apple’s iOS 8.1 upgrade.\n\nFor the time been, you can file your report with Apple and hope for the best.\nhttps://www.apple.com/feedback/ipad.html\n\nA: On a whim, after upgrading to iOS 9, I tried the same Logitech keyboard with my iPad Air 2; the problems no longer exist!

BUT I still do not know if any of these deletions will cause additional, as yet undiscovered problems.... so far so good \n(if someone better qualified can confirm this is all OK that would be great)\nHope this helps!  :)\n\nA: I am using Macbook Pro Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013 with MAC OSX 10.9.5 and got the same issue with the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"iTunes can’t verify the identity of the server “init.itunes.apple.com”.\"\n\n*\"iTunes can’t verify the identity of the server “xp.apple.com”.\"\n\n*App Store login \"Connection Failed\"\n\n\nOpen Utilities => Keychain Access => search \"Verisign\" => delete the Verisign login in blue color.\nThen relaunch your App Store or iTunes. This should fix it. \n\nA: To solve \"Your connection is not private\" issue I went to keychain access, typed verisign in search and deleted them. Clicked keys emblem on left , they were gone, then rebooted chrome. Now it works. Thanks for the help.\nI have a MacBook OS X (10.6.8 )\n\nA: I followed instructions here, deleted all VeriSign certificates, but still got errors on ITunes etc.  What worked for me was after doing the above steps, I went into Keychain > Keychain First Aid and repair permissions.\nITunes and other failing certificate errors were fixed!\n", "Q: How to share a (non-iCloud) library in the new Yosemite Photos App? In iPhoto, I put a shared iPhoto library on a network external hard drive accessed by multiple computers in the family.\nEven though two computer cannot access the library at the same time, the whole family can add to and edit the same (huge) library.\nIn Photos, I can't seem to select the \"Photo Library.photoslibrary\" from a second computer (via network shared drive).\nIf it's no longer possible to share a library from multiple computers, that would be a huge functionality loss for us - to not be able to keep one library for the whole family.\nOur library is too large/expensive for iCloud Photo Library, which also would require all computers to sign in with the same iCloud account (no good for everything else).\nUPDATE: since my shared Photo Library resides on an external hard drive, I tried attaching it directly to the second computer and then was allowed to select it (Option-launch Photos App) as well as setting it as the system library.\nSo it appears that the difference with iPhoto is that I can no longer share the library via network File Sharing (tried both smb and afp with no luck).\nI really hope Apple allows this again as it's a hassle to detach/attach hard drives when we have high speed home network.\nUPDATE 2: following Kevin's suggestion below, I tried creating a new Photos Library with only one photo added, and was able to access this library from another computer via network share. When trying to open the much larger library (converted from iPhoto library) from network share, Photos app showed a spinning wheel for a while and then returned an error message saying it could not open the library. The spinning wheel can persist for a long time, so I suspected it might be the sheer size of the library choking up the app. Indeed when I brought the computer into the same room as the wireless router, it did successfully open the library.\nSo bottomline is it still \"works\" provided the network speed is able to handle the size of the library.\n\nA: Hold the alt (option) key while starting Photos App. You will be prompted to choose a Library.\n", "Q: Weird text alignment in System Information on Yosemite Somehow the text field in System Information appears truncated:\n\nIf I reduce the overall size, the content of the bottom pane disappears, kind of goes below the left-hand pane:\n\nIt kind of seems like there is a missing horizontal scrollbar below the bottom pane, but I am not sure if there should be one there.\nThis doesn't affect only Audio, but many other ones fields.\nI removed the font caches (although it is unlikely that it is caused by font issues); fixed the permissions (nothing that seemed related), but no go...\nThis is on a Retina Macbook Pro 13\" (mid 2014) running OS X Yosemite 10.10.3, and the issue was also present on 10.10.2.\nAny idea what is going on?\n\nA: As determined in comments above, it seems as though your scrollbar settings were the problem :)  I guess System Information is doing something unconventional with its window size due to the space taken up by the scrollbar when it's set to show Always...\n\nA: When the scroll bars are shown, System Information seems to set its margins based on the window size when it's opened. So what happens is you widen the window to show more info, then quit, then reopen it, and then find you have to widen the window more to get the margins wide enough. This cycle repeats until you can't make the window any bigger and are stuck with too-narrow margins.\nSo, here's a workaround I found (other than hiding the scroll bars): open System Information, narrow the window as far as it'll go, then quit, reopen, narrow again. Repeat until the margins are somewhere near the actual window size.\nAnnoyingly, to maintain this you have to widen the window every time you open System Info (to get the window wide enough to display things), then narrow it before quitting so it won't be screwed up next time.\nUpdate: this appears to be fixed in El Capitain (OS X 10.11). Also, I found another workaround for Yosemite: set the scroll bar mode for just System Information:\ndefaults write com.apple.SystemProfiler AppleShowScrollBars WhenScrolling\n\n", "Q: Location service not working as expected in iOS 8.3 The recent update to iOS 8.3 on my iPad mini 1 doesnt seem to have gone well with the location service.\nThe Location Service is enabled in the Settings but it doesnt really get my current location. When I ask Siri about my current location, it doesnt have an answer. Also, if I try to check in on Facebook App, it doesnt get the location either.\nIs it a bug? Is there a fix for this?\n\nA: The way to fix it is to power off the device and then open Apple Maps when it reboots.\nThat way you can determine if the maps app cannot work or if it's related to a temporary issue to a problem with the third party apps.\n\nA: It appears that many/most bluetooth connected GPS receivers will not work with iOS 8.3.  GPS information is received by the iPad, but the routing of this information to apps that need it has been broken by iOS 8.3.  I use a Bad Elf Pro and have experienced this problem, and know of others with bluetooth connected Dual GPS receivers that are also \"dead in the water\".  No legit fix (short of buying a wired GPS or one of the newer bluetooth GPS receivers that use a newer communication protocol) until Apple fixes the operating system and issues an upgrade.  My fix was to downgrade back to iOS 8.2, which you can still do as of today because Apple is \"nice enough\" to continue signing the iOS 8.2 firmware, but they could turn that off at any time.  A brief search on the web will show you how to do this, and it worked for me.\n", "Q: Accused of using company phone whereas a personal iPad was used My boss is going to sack me tomorrow, because he says I used my company phone whilst driving the company van. I definitely didn't use my phone.  Sometimes I might audio FaceTime my girlfriend on my iPad (which has a different SIM card and is not a company iPad.). And she may phone me back but even though it rings on my phone it also rings on my iPad. How does this happen?\n\nA: Facetime will ring on any device you have registered your email address for the Facetime.app on that device.\nThere is an explanation here on imore.com which goes into some  details on how it works and how to register, enable and disable an email address on a device.\n\nHow to enable or disable phone numbers and email address for FaceTime\nIf you don't want your iPad or iPod touch to receive FaceTime calls\nsent to your iPhone phone number, or don't want your work iPhone or\nMac to receive FaceTime calls sent to your personal email address, you\ncan easily disable -- or enable -- them on a per-device, and\nper-address/number basis.\n1, Launch the Settings app from the Home screen of your iPhone, iPad, or\niPod touch.\n2,Tap FaceTime.\n3,Tap on the checkmark to the left of any\nnumber or address you want to turn off (prevent from calling FaceTime\non that device).\nTo enable or re-enable numbers or addresses, simply\nreverse the process and tap the empty space to the left to number or\naddress to add a checkmark.\n\n\nIf you always carry both devices then there is no need to set up personal accounts on company equipment.\nIf the boss's entire case is based on a mobile call during a driving period (rather weak, you could have been parked / stopped etc.) then the whole situation is probably for another reason and this is just an excuse that will pass the labour board.\n", "Q: Reverse Tether - Share OSX Yosemite Wifi Connection Over Bluetooth I see plenty of old questions out on the web, but each has a myriad of people following up with issues. Now with Yosemite, I think things might have changed anyway.\nI want share hotel internet, from my 10.10.3 machine's Wifi connection over bluetooth to my phone. i.e. reverse tether. This tutorial explains in step 2 to enable \"Share my internet connection with other bluetooth devices\", under \"Advanced bluetooth settings\". Well, in Yosemite this isn't there.\n\nIn any case, I can pair my device, enable internet sharing in OSX and connect via PAN. But I can't seem to get internet on my phone. How can this be done in Yosemite?\nNote: My phone is a S5 on Lolipop. When pairing I can even select my MBP and choose to \"Use for internet access\".\nEdit: To rule out Lollipop I tried all this with my wife's S4 on Kitkat and it couldn't browse either. \nEdit2: I have the same issue as here. Setting the IP of the PAN to DHCP with manual address makes the PAN network show green (it was orange). However, internet on my Android still does not work.\n\nA: In order to do this in Yosemite, you'll need to go back to the main screen of System Preferences and click on the Sharing preference pane. In the sidebar, there will be an Internet Sharing option. Click on this to view its settings.\nNow set the \"Share your connection from\" drop down to Wi-Fi and then check the Bluetooth PAN checkbox in the menu below. Next just make sure to check the box next Internet Sharing in the sidebar.\nOnce this is done your Mac should be sharing its Wi-Fi connection to devices in your Bluetooth PAN.\n", "Q: Kernel panics

analogous to the mathematical direction to divide 5 by 0 \nThe kernel / core of the OS got an instruction that cannot make sense, so it dumps all it knows about what it sees looking backwards and forces the user to start over.\nThe kext are kernel extensions and you sometimes can catch one that causes this. Similarly, the page fault (type 14) has to do with memory access. Similarly, if you have the source code you can sometimes use the backtrace to see what code was running on that CPU before the problem was raised.\nOther times, the problem has messed up the logic so that none of the values make any sense.\nYou may notice that I'm not giving you a precise answer. That's because you usually need Apple's assistance to make sense of any particular log file - and even if you give them 10 log files with 10 corresponding panics, sometimes it's not clear what's causing it.\nCan you ask a follow on question with specific request - like how to disable the VMware kernel extension or how to make sense of a pattern of crashes (you'll need to summarize them and compare the type of fault, possibly the BSD process name corresponding to current thread (and sometimes this is an innocent bystander and not the culprit) as well as any patterns of the kext activity.\nYou can learn more about debugging a KP from this excellent but technically challenging article:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn2063/_index.html\n", "Q: iPhone: copy–paste of URL not working I sometimes want to tweet a link from my iPhone (4s / iOS 8). On iOS 6 I used to simply copy the URL from Safari and paste it into the text field of the twitter app. \n\n\n*\n\n*Placing the 'cursor' inside URL field inside Safari's URL field\n\n*choosing 'select all' from context menu\n\n*clicking on 'copy' in context menu\n\n*switching apps –> twitter\n\n*choosing 'paste' from context menu\n\n\nThis however seems to not work anymore on iOS 8. Workflow for sending an email with an URL was the same – and also does not work anymore. \nEverytime I try to copy a URL as I used to, anything I copied before that url is pasted instead. \nI do have a work around now: clicking the 'share by email' icon will open a new email with that link already in the text field which I then can copy to twitter. But I'm just wondering if anybody else has found a way how to copy URLs into other applications – or is this not possible any more by design?\nPS: clicking the 'share by twitter' option does not work – but that's a different story I guess.\n\nA: I tested and can't reproduce this (though I'm not trying to paste into Twitter, your issue sounds like the initial copy command is failing, so from that perspective it is working for me), but an easier workaround for sending to Twitter is selecting Copy on the bottom row of the share sheet (which copies the URL, though in a slightly different format), then pasting into Twitter.\n\nA: Apparently this is a known problem for some on iOS 9 (Apple bug rdar://23129518). Somehow the paste does the previous copy rather than the current copy. The only workaround for the general copy problem seems to be just doing the copy twice. \nMore details in this article - http://www.imore.com/copy-and-paste-not-working-you-ios-9-heres-workaround\n", "Q: What does 'current channel' mean in Yosemite wireless diagnostics? I'm trying to troubleshoot some wifi issues I'm having after I updated to Yosemite. I'm using Wireless Diagnostics to try to figure out what channel I should force my network on because I noticed events such as kernel[0]: wl0: Roamed or switched channel, reason #8, bssid ... very close in time to when my connection drops.\n\nAs you can see in the screenshot, I am connected to a network on channel 2 (the one in bold) but Network Diagnostics says that the current channel is 1. What is the meaning of current channel\n?\n\nA: Wi-Fi has multiple channels, which specify what frequency the network is communicating on.  On the 2.4GHz frequency, channels 1, 6, and 11 are non-overlapping channels, and all the others overlap on these channels.  (On the 5GHz frequency, the channels are spaced out to avoid overlapping).  You can think of channels as an offset value from 2.4GHz.\nCurrent channel is the Wi-Fi channel your router is advertising and the channel your computer is connecting to.  You might get better performance by using either a 5GHz channel if your Wi-Fi router supports it, or one of the non-overlapping ones on the 2.4GHz.\n\nA: “Current Channel” means “Number of Networks Using the Current Channel”.

I have a non Apple monitor that I wish to use. I have connected the Air and the monitor correctly. My Apple keyboard ( had a previous owner) will not work with the monitor or the Air? How do I get these to work?\n\nA: Your Apple (Bluetooth) Keyboard doesn't connect to your monitor, but to your Mac. Open System Preferences and go to bluetooth, there you can connect new devices. Make sure the keyboard is on (there's a power button on the side) - a green LED in the top right of the keyboard (front) should light up when you turn it on.\nLink: Apple's Support document with Screenshots.\n", "Q: How do I make my iPod 5 gen stop asking for my Apple ID password to update an app? The other day I went to update Pandora so I could listen to music and once I press update it asks for Apple ID password.\nThis does this to all of my other apps that must be updated.\n\nA: Agree with @Tyson, updates do not require a password in recent versions of iOS, presuming you are signed into the App Store with the account that originally purchased (or acquired) the app.\nIf you have multiple accounts, and each account has downloaded one or more apps, you are always going to be prompted for the password if the account that is signed in is not the same one as the account that purchased the app that you are trying to update.\nIt sounds like in your case you might have changed Apple IDs, or used somebody else's when originally acquiring the apps? In which case, you can sign out of the store (App Store > first tab > \"Sign Out [your email]\" at the bottom) and sign back in with the account that acquired the apps you are trying to update.\n", "Q: Creating an event from Last Imported in Photos.app How do I make an event from my last import using Photos? Does Photos only use albums rather than events? Is it still possible to merge events?\n\nA: Photos uses Albums instead of Events and you can create an Album from the last imported by selecting all in the Last Imported album and clicking the + icon on the toolbar. Albums are merged by selecting the contents of one, copying it to another, then deleting the first.\n", "Q: Share iPhone developer account for multiple devices I have a question, is it possible to share a developer account between a couple of devices?

Does this harm my phone's battery?\nUpdate [Oct 1, 2017]: Thanks for all your great answers. I noticed there is a related video which addressed my question well.\n\nA: No it does not. Nightly charging is the norm today for many people, and unlike older technology from a few years ago, today's lithium ion based  batteries use newer technology and battery life is not damaged with nightly charging. All batteries wear out eventually, but unless you are charging multiple times per day, your battery is likely to outlast your phone or at least last a couple of years.\n\nA: Technical\nLithium Polymer batteries, such as those used in the iPhone, are a very well understood battery chemistry and use specific chargers to manage their charging.\nWhile the latest charging ICs Apple uses are proprietary (they work with Dialog for their power management ICs), it is unlikely that Apple performs a significantly different charging process than every other battery charging IC manufacturer.\nThis process charges the battery as quickly as reasonable while protecting the battery from damage or increased wear and tear. Please note that the charging IC - or Power Management IC - is located inside the iPhone.  So this applies regardless of the external USB powering device you use to charge it.\nWhen the battery is full, the charger turns off the charging process.  The battery is left alone without current going into or out of it.  This is because most Lithium chemistry batteries don't like trickle charging (a process you may hear from others where a constant voltage and low current is applied to a battery all the time to keep it topped off).\nCharging ICs therefore turn the current completely off and power the phone itself from the charger. This is the only time the battery isn't charging or discharging - when it's full and the phone is plugged in.\nThe battery isn't discharged and charged in some sort of cycle after charging is complete.  I'm not sure where this myth stems from, because it would actually place additional wear and tear on the battery.\nSelf Discharge\nEvery battery has a \"self-discharge\" rate.  This is the battery's natural capacity loss when not connected to anything.  For Lithium Polymer batteries, this is a low (compared to other rechargeable battery types) 5% per month.\nThe charging IC does check up on the battery and if it loses significant charge over time while plugged in, it will start another charging cycle.  But this would occur perhaps once every two weeks after several percent of the battery charge has been lost - certainly not overnight.  If you leave your phone plugged in for a month, it might start another charging cycle once or twice in that time.\nConclusion\nThe phone and its battery, therefore, will suffer absolutely no damage being plugged in for days at a time.\nLong term storage\nThere is one caveat to this answer: Lithium chemistry batteries don't like to be stored with full charges.  They degrade more quickly if they aren't used and have a full charge.  If you are going to store your mobile device unused for more than a month, charge it up fully, then discharge it (watch videos over wifi or play video games) until it's 40-50% charged.  Then turn the device fully off.\nLong term use\nIf you are using an older iPhone in a fixed installation (picture frame on the wall, data collection, baby monitor, etc) while turned on and in use with it plugged into a charger all the time, you should consider disconnecting the charger and discharging it fully once a month.  Similar issue to the above - the battery doesn't like being \"stored\" for long periods of time at full charge, and the charger will keep it near 100% the entire time - degrading the battery a bit more quickly than desired. Going through a discharge cycle will exercise it and help it to last longer.\nPersonal\nWhile I use a newer phone now, I charged my iPhone 3GS every day for 8+ hours a day (ie, overnight) regardless of how much charge was left - and more often than not, I had used less than 20% on a given day. I used it for 4 years that way, and never replaced the battery -  it still lasted much longer than a day. Since then (3 years now), it's been essentially an iPod touch, being charged for days at a time when no one is using it, and being left in the car discharged for days (or weeks!) at a time when it's forgotten.  Battery is still going strong, and this is certainly more than 900 charging cycles for this device.\nMy iPhone 5 and iPad (3rd gen) were used the same way.  No negative impact from having them charge all night every night.\nI'm now using the iPhone 6+ the same way.  This is an expected use case for a mobile device, and it's running just fine. I expect that to continue to be the case.\nYou can leave your iPhone plugged in all night and it will not be harmful to your iPhone.\n\nA: Leaving the iPhone to charge overnight doesn't affect your iPhone drastically. As phones are very smart, once it gets fully charged, it knows when to stop the current from coming in to protect the phone from overcharging.\nBut there are also some reason which can affect your iPhone plugged in overnight, this can leads to slow down the lifespan of your iPhone.\nLithium ion battery is used in iPhone, which can react poorly if your iPhone experience higher temperature.\nLi-ion does not need to be fully charged, as is the case with lead acid, nor is it desirable to do so. In fact, it is better not to fully charge, because a high voltage stresses the battery. Choosing a lower voltage threshold, or eliminating the saturation charge altogether, prolongs battery life but this reduces the runtime. To satisfy maximum runtime, most chargers for consumer products go for maximum capacity; extended service life is perceived less important. \nTechnically the Li-ion charging concept is given below.\nLithium-ion operates safely within the designated operating voltages; however, the battery becomes unstable if inadvertently charged to a higher than specified voltage. Prolonged charging above 4.30V forms plating of metallic lithium on the anode, while the cathode material becomes an oxidizing agent, loses stability and produces carbon dioxide (CO2). The cell pressure rises, and if charging is allowed to continue the current interrupt device (CID) responsible for cell safety disconnects the current at 1,380kPa (200psi). \n\nA: As someone who works for a battery specific retailer and is asked this question a lot, the answer is \"it won't hurt it in the short term, but in the long term it will shorten its lifespan.\" Between your phone's charging system and the internal circuit board built into the battery itself, there are enough layers of protection that will prevent either your phone or the battery from being damaged under normal circumstances. However to my understanding, as part of that process, if it is left in the charger beyond the point when it is charged, it will start going through charge cycles - discharging a little bit and filling back up - as part of a safety measure, and those little charge cycles will add up over time. Since Lithium Ion batteries are rated to have 250-500 cycles during its overall lifespan before it is worn out, it's better to preserve those cycles when possible, especially given phone and therefore battery usage is oftentimes pretty heavy. A good example is eating cheeseburgers: one or two won't kill you, but if you do it daily for 40 years, you'll experience some pretty significant health issues. Same concept with leaving a phone plugged in.\nWhen my customers purchase a replacement battery from me, I oftentimes recommend they alter their charging habits. The most common is to plug it in prior to bedtime and leave it in all night. While certainly not dangerous or damaging to the battery, overall it will wear it out faster than if you didn't do this. Instead, I suggest they change their habit to charging their phone when they get home from work/school/shopping and go about your daily routine: cook dinner, wash dishes, watch television, etcetera and periodically check in on it. Once it's fully charged, unplug it.\n\nA: According to Apple, when an Apple device reaches full charge, it stops charging.\nIt's true for their macs and all other devices. \n\nA: The charge controllers which charge the battery are really smart. They are designed by really great companies such as ST Microelectronics.\nThese charge controllers typically have many features. (I don't know if the ST ones I linked have all of them. I just pulled those parts out of the air). Every Lithium battery charging IC will have a smart charging algorithm which WILL PROTECT AGAINST OVERCHARGING. Lithium batteries are different from NiCd batteries in which you can pump a small current through continuously which will be converted to heat directly. A Lithium battery will get destroyed (violently) if subjected to minimal overcharging.\nSome of the higher-end chips, like the ones used in Apple devices are really smart. They understand how a Lithium battery will last the longest and will adjust the charge and discharge to ensure the longevity of the life cycle of the battery. As mentioned in an answer above, Apple fast-charges the battery from 0-80%. The reason why they do this is because as you get closer to 100%, the charging efficiency becomes much lower. After this stage, the charging slows down. It typically goes into constant voltage mode where a specific voltage is set and the charge circuitry waits for the voltage to reach a certain threshold. However, after the battery is fully charged, there's no point in recharging it when it's voltage is 1/1000th a volt lower than what it should be. Instead, the charger has a set cutoff voltage when it will start charging again. This is often pretty low, like 50-70%. The battery is simply disconnected from the phone internally and the phone is powered off the power cord. The charging will only begin once the battery goes lower than the threshold which is set up by the manufacturer.\nThis prevents the wear and tear on the battery.\nAs a side lesson, the isolation between the battery charge circuit and the power adapter/cable you use makes very little difference to the charge quality as long as the design is not so piss poor that it causes too many voltage spikes and dips.\n\nA: No, it's not harmful.\nModern phones are smart enough to stop the electric current when fully charged. That may have been a problem before lithium-ion batteries, but nowadays you shouldn't have to worry about it.\nHowever, if your iPhone has a case that doesn't allow heat to escape very well, it might be better to remove the case to avoid overheating. Lithium-ion batteries don't like drastic temperature changes or extreme temperatures.\n\nA: If you use your phone while plugin\nit's not good if you do it on regular basis it can hurt your battery life. I don't recommend that you should charge your phone all night. I read some suggestions that you should turn off your phone and then plugin all night.\nI recommend Just charge it to 40-50% before going to sleep.\n", "Q: How to watch movies on iPad? Here is the setup:\nI have an iPad air 2 and a server in my homenetwork that runs torrent client Transmission and a Plex-server.\nI use the server to stream media to the iPad while i'm home, direct media to my chromecast etc.\nI need to solve two issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sometimes I want to add new torrents to the transmission-client on the server. From a computer, I currently do this using the transmission web-service.\n\n*Sometimes I want to download movies to my iPad and watch them while I'm not home.\n\n\nA: Plex Media Server offers \"sync\" functionality to devices if you have a Plex Pass subscription (starts at $3.99/month, less per month for longer subscription periods). You initiate the sync either from the Plex web app or device by selecting movie(s) to sync, and it then transcodes your selected media into a format appropriate for iPad. You then open the iOS app to download it directly to the device. See Quick Guide to Plex Sync for a run-through.\nFor adding torrents, the best solution I've found is to use Dropbox. If you don't already have a Dropbox account, set one up. Download the Dropbox client onto your server.\nIn the Mac menu bar, a new icon of an open box will appear. Tap on that, then tap on the folder icon to the left to open the Dropbox folder. Here, create a folder called \"torrents\" (or whatever you like).\nIn Transmission, go to Preferences > Transfers and set the Auto Add directory to the Dropbox directory you just created, which will be stored locally at /Users/yourusername/Dropbox/torrents/ or whatever you called it.\nOn the iPad, install the Dropbox client. Next time you want to add a torrent, act as if you're downloading it to the iPad. Since you can't actually download files to the iPad, the screen will change to show the filename, and will have a \"Open in Dropbox\" link at the top-right. Tap on that, then select the torrents folder you created in Dropbox. Tap Save at the upper right.\nAfter a few seconds, the file will sync to Dropbox from the iPad, then from Dropbox to your server. Since Transmission is watching the directory where it will appear on your server, it will be picked up and automatically added.\nThere's a few steps involved in setting this workflow up, but once done, it's maintenance-free.\n", "Q: Enabling both trackpad Drag Lock and 3 Finger Drag at once? OSX has two methods of dragging with the track pad, “drag lock” (double tap then drag until you tap to release) and “three finger drag” where you touch three fingers and drag until you release. The problem is, it forces you to select one or the other.\n\nIs there any way I can manually turn both options on at the same time?\nThe reason this is useful is because 3 Finger Drag is great for short quick drags, but for longer drags you often run out of room on the trackpad. Drag Lock is good for long drags but is quite slow when you have a bunch of drags because you have to double tap into and tap out of the drag lock each time. It’d be really great to have both at once. \n\nA: On OS X El Capitan 10.11.1, the following terminal commands seem to solve it for me on the Magic Trackpad (on the built in trackpad I can operate only one dragging mechanic at a time) : \n# Enable \"tap-and-a-half\" to drag.\ndefaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad Dragging -int 1\ndefaults write com.apple.AppleMultitouchTrackpad Dragging -int 1\n\n\n# Enable 3-finger drag. (Moving with 3 fingers in any window \"chrome\" moves the window.)\ndefaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad TrackpadThreeFingerDrag -bool true\ndefaults write com.apple.AppleMultitouchTrackpad TrackpadThreeFingerDrag -bool true\n\nsource: https://github.com/boochtek/mac_config/blob/master/trackpad.sh\nUpdate: dug up a bit more and found the \"tap behavior\" mouse defaults entry, which requires the \"2\" preset in order to get \"tap to drag\" on the built in trackpad\ndefaults -currentHost write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.mouse.tapBehavior -int 2\ndefaults write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.mouse.tapBehavior -int 2\n\n\nA: I went directly to the preference file for the trackpad to see if one could set both the Three Finger Dragging flag and the Dragging flag (with or without setting the DragLock flag) but though I could set both and the new values remained stable I was not able to get both Three Finger Dragging and Double Tap Dragging to function at the same time. (Actually, there are two preference files: one for the Apple Bluetooth Multitouch Trackpad and one for the Apple Multitouch Trackpad and I tested this with both just in case.) So I believe the answer is No, it can't be done.\nUnless my mind is going I'm pretty sure that it was  possible to set both types of dragging in an earlier version of OS X and it felt like something had changed but I couldn't say exactly what until I saw this question. Unless there was a conflict that Apple found between the various Three Finger settings or they have a plan for some new function that would require such a change I don't know why this ability would be removed. The preference files are capable of allowing the various combinations of dragging by using separate flags. The way it now exists allows the flags to be set inconsistently with how OS X performs dragging but it's only one part of that preference file that is badly designed; the whole set of prefs looks like they were thrown together without considering an overall methodology and makes the chance of introducing problems as changes are made over time more likely to occur. And having both ways, as the OP said, is convenient at times. \n\nA: This got it working for me. \n\n\n*\n\n*Set \"TrackpadThreeFingerDrag\"=YES and also \"Dragging\"=YES in

messages to appear up on older iMac Just upgraded older iMac with neatest software.  Now my spouse's text messages show up on iMac.  Her iPhone software is old and she cannot turn it off from her iPhone. Is there a way to turn it off from the iMac?\n\nA: Open the \"Messages\" App on the iMac, go to settings and remove the iMessage account.\n", "Q: Command to find out the version number of a .pkg file Does anyone know how to retrieve the version number of a .pkg file which isn't installed yet?\nI'd like to use something like pkgutil --pkg-info, but that only works for installed packages. \nI've also tried installer -pkginfo -verbose, but that doesn't show the version number.\nIs there a built-in command to do this, or alternatively, could someone suggest a one-liner please?\nThanks.\n\nA: The best I could come up with was this:\npkgutil --expand package.pkg /tmp/pkg; cat /tmp/pkg/PackageInfo | grep ./Applications | grep -m 1 .app\\\" | awk '{ print $3, $2 }'; rm -rf /tmp/pkg\n\nNot the most elegant solution, so I'm still searching for a way to do this without having to extract the .pkg first.\n\nA: Variation of @d3Xt3r answer:\ntar xOvf PackageName.pkg output.pkg/PackageInfo 2>/dev/null | grep '<pkg-info' \\\n    | sed \"s#.* version=\\\"\\([0-9\\.]*\\)\\\".*#\\1#\"\n\nAdvantage is that this is only pipe processing.\nNote my package had different structure, there is an extra directory output.pkg which contains file PackageInfo\n\nA: for a package structured as below,\nPackageName.pkg\n└── Package.pkg\n    └── PackageInfo\n\nadapted from @Marek R\nthe command to extract version information inline is:\ntar xOvf \"PackageName.pkg\" \"Package.pkg/PackageInfo\" 2>/dev/null | fgrep \"<pkg-info\" | grep -Po '(?<!-)version=\"[^\"]+\"'\n\n", "Q: Are the photos I share using the Photos app not really shared? When I share a photo to iCloud using the Photos app, subsequent edits to the photo in my library seem not so sync with the shared photo. Has sharing created a new copy of my photo?\n\nA: Yes - sharing the photo puts it in a cloud backed \"truth\" where that image is available for all participants of the album to download and modify their copy, but not to change the original.\nYou'll want to share the edited version and then clean old ones until such time editing directly that shared image is implemented.\n\nA: No, indeed.\nPhotos that you share are not shared [sic], but are copied and then shared, despite clear indications in the user interface that would lead to the conclusion that they are. \nFurthermore, as a consequence, albums are not shared at all: instead the individual photos in the album at the time it is shared are copied. Moreover, if you add photos to an album, and wish to add them to the shared \"version\" of that album, you must make sure to \"share\" only the added photos, as any photos that you \"share again\" will have new copies made for them in the shared album, and the order of the photos in the ablum will not match the order in the album that you \"share\" them from (the order is a frustrating combination of the order in which they are added and the date taken).\nSo albums are \"shared\" only in a marketing-speak sense.\n", "Q: How do Aperture stacks work in the Photos app? What happens when an Aperture stack is imported into photos? It seems that all of the images in the stack get imported as individual images with no relation to one another. Can that possibly be right?\n\nA: Here's what I know about Photos Version 1.0 (209.52.0):\n\n\n*\n\n*Albums you make in Photos are only sortable by date ascending or manually (drag the photos in the order you wish)\n\n*Shared Albums are not sortable - last in on the bottom\n\n*The All Photos album isn't sortable - last in on the bottom (and imports are multi-threaded, so don't expect photos to be arranged in any order like they were on the filesystem when you let the app loose on an import of more than one photo.)\n\n*Burst photos seem to stay grouped (most of the time) and Aperture stacks do not ever stay grouped.\n\n\nBasically, the rule is you don't even have a sort option enabled and when you do, it's one direction by time so you get one default sort to sometimes enforce in Photos 1.0\n\nA: As far as I can tell:\n\n\n*\n\n*All the images are imported.\n\n*The \"Stack Pick\" gets the keyword \"Stack Pick.\"\n\n*(Very unfortunately…) In all other respects, images that were parts of stacks are indistinguishable from images that are not parts of stacks.\n\n\nThis means it's not possible to automatically find all images that are parts of stacks, but not the stack pick. (To move them to a separate folder, for example.)\nUpdate I wrote a script to help \"fix\" this problem: you can use it to move the non picks into a separate album, export them to a separate directory, and then delete them from Photos.\n", "Q: Is there a fix for the Bluetooth issues in OS X 10.10? After updating my iMac (late 2013) to OS X 10.10.3, my cursor has begun to move very sluggishly and erratically. In addition, my Apple Wireless Keyboard and Magic Mouse both randomly drop their connection entirely, often taking minutes to reconnect. The keyboard will also occasionally send repeated keystrokes to the computer, continuing until I physically turn it off. I have tried to restart the computer (many times), reset the SMC and NVRAM, boot into Safe Mode, and turn Bluetooth, WiFi, and the peripherals on and off, all to no avail. Several times the machine would boot without any lag, only to begin lagging when I opened Messages or Safari. There is no Bluetooth interference, as none of my other nearby devices experience any Bluetooth issues. I have also noticed that USB peripherals work perfectly, without any lag.\nAre there any potential workarounds I haven't tried? Or will I simply have to cope until Apple pushes another release?\nUpdate: These issues, to a lesser extent, are still present in OS X 10.10.4.\n\nA: *\n\n*If you boot into safe mode, does the erratic behavior persist? (i.e. use the Mac in that mode for hours if possible as opposed to using it to rebuild some system caches and then reboot back into normal boot state)\n\n*If you make a new user account, does the erratic behavior persist?\n\n*Can you reproduce the keyboard issues in recovery HD and/or single user mode?\nThose are the first things I'd test to see if a workaround is possible. Also, get a sudo sysdiagnose every time the OS is laggy - those logs will help if you need to open a bug report with Apple. I've not heard of (nor experienced first hand) problems, but it's also soon in the release cycle.\n", "Q: Resolving problems with development tools on upgrading to Mac Yosemite I use software development tools including Java, MySQL, Apache, PHP, LaTeX and Homebrew on OS X 10.7.5. What problems might I encounter on upgrading to Mac Yosemite and how can these be resolved?\n\nA: I am a bioinformatician developing on the Mac and implementing on Linux. I have all of the following technologies that you mention running on Yosemite: Java, MySQL, Apache, PHP; I do not use LaTeX or Homebrew so cannot comment on them. In addition I run Tomcat, Perl CGI, Perl CGI with MySQL drivers, GD graphics for Perl, PHP with MySQL, Eclipse and Python. So in general it is definitely possible.\nYour question however refers to your current installations. The answer here is that your current install of MySQL should not be affected. (If you wish you could upgrade and install the latest version available for Yosemite from Oracle's website, although this requires a free sign-up.)  Your current installation of Apache will not be available and this will also affect how PHP runs. You will also have to update your Java.\nFor the record, let me try to summarise what you would need to do. (I'm assuming you are starting with something as different from Yosemite as Snow Leopard. I never had Lion running - only Mountain Lion and Mavericks - so some of this may already be familiar from Lion.)\nBasics\n\n\n*\n\n*Yosemite no longer has a Developers' Tools disc. Instead you should download Xcode from the App Store. It's free, but a huge download (ca 3Gb). However you are almost bound to need it.\n\n*You need to unhide the Library folder (so you can get to the Apache install etc.) which is now hidden by default (https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18928). To make the Library folder in your home folder always visible you right-click and select View Options and then tick \"Show Library Folder\". However I use the main /Library folder for web development and can't remember how I unhid this. Apparently the following terminal command should work:\nsudo chflags nohidden /Library/\nApache/PHP/Perl\nThe old option in System prefs of enabling the Apache website is no longer present for Apache 2. The following excellent article explains how to enable Apache 2 and the PHP5 and Perl modules: https://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-3083. Do exactly what it says. \nJava\nThere are three possible things you may be doing with Java, and as you don't indicate which you are interested in I shall mention them all. However the basic thing is that Apple no longer supplies its own Java, so if you need upgrades you get them from Oracle.\n\n\n*\n\n*You write Java programs. In this case download Eclipse for Java (https://eclipse.org/) — Luna is the current version. If it launches, you have Java installed. If not, you need to download it from https://www.java.com/en/download/mac_download.jsp? . Then you are fine.\n\n*You want to run Java applications on your desktop. You will need the download above, but Yosemite may try to prevent you actually running Java applications that ran fine before. If you have used the application before or trust the author then bypass Gatekeeper by right-clicking when you launch the app and tell Apple you want to run it (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491).\n\n*You want to run a Java Applet in a web browser. This is still possible but is now a real nightmare. Basically you need a signed applet and even then you may need to set your Java System Preferences specifically to allow applets from the website in question and also make sure that in Safari Prefs > Security > Allow Plug-ins is ticked and the allowed sites are listed in Website settings. Even then Safari may ask you to confirm you want to run the applet each time. The current policy on browsers now is to only allow Java applets to run if you are using the latest version of Java. I do have some self-signed applets I wrote myself that I can still manage to run. However because the whole plugin technology is being phased out, I think the Java Applet is a dead man walking. (Server-side Java is no problem though, and has advantages over PHP and the like.) More details of setting your browser up for Java applets can be found at http://humairahmed.com/blog/?p=8061 and on the Oracle/Java site.\nNote about Java 8 on virgin Yosemite\nIf you want to run an old Java application on a brand new machine with Yosemite installed (rather than upgrading from Mavericks or earlier), and download the latest version of Java it will be (April 2015) Java 8 and the application will not run. You need to install Java 6 from https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572. I'd download it while it's still there.\n\nA: This question is to broad for a simple answer.\nMost software will still work perfectly fine, some might break.\nThe only way to be sure is check the compatibility for each software you depend on. Usually the developer has some information on their page, further there are pages like RoaringApps which publish lists of application compatibility based on users feedback.\n\nA: From my experience, upgrading to a new OS will cause major applications to break. I would hold off on upgrading the OS.\nThis is from a linux stand point since you're looking to make a major upgrade (i.e. Lion to Yosemite).\n", "Q: Can't load music onto my iPhone 5S with my Mac running 10.6.8 My laptop (a MacBook) runs 10.6.8 and I want to use my iTunes to move my music across to my new iPhone 5s, but the two won't 'talk' to each other.\nThat is, there seems to be no drag and drop solution, like with other Apple products.\nDo you know why, and how I can fix this? Is my laptop too old? Do I need to upgrade? \n\nA: There are 2 options for putting music on your iPhone. Manually or Syncing. If syncing is enabled then there's a Music-Section when your iPhone is selected, where you can check playlists, artists etc. that you'd like to sync. Alternatively there's a checkmark that says \"Manage Music manually\" (or something alike - my system is german). When you can put music on your iPod/iPhone via drag and drop.\n", "Q: Disk space lost after quitting disk partition My MacBook Pro came with a 500 GB hard disk, and I used about 250 GB.\nI was trying to get a new logic partition using the OSX disk utility, and then my Mac Book Pro froze and I had to quit the Disk Utility. \nThen the available space just disappeared. \n\n\n*\n\n*Disk Utility shows that the logic partition has a total capacity of 498.88 GB, available 10.48 GB, used 243.75 GB, which does not add up.\n\n*Disk Utility shows that the hard drive has a total capacity of 499.25 GB, available 19 MB, used 499.23 GB.\n\n*running df -h shows \nFilesystem     Size   Used  Avail Capacity  iused   ifree %iused  Mounted on \n/dev/disk1     237Gi  227Gi  9.8Gi    96%   59509256      2559899 96%   /\n\nThings I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*all check and repair functions in Disk Utility\n\n*fsck -f \n\n*reboot and cmd+R and open the command line  tool, but I cannot mount /dev/disk0 with -t hfs. It tells me resource busy\n\nA: You probably tried to manipulate a CoreStorage volume with Disk Utility. Core Storage volumes are built after enabling File Vault 2, creating a Fusion Drive or often after updating to Yosemite.\nIf you don't have a second internal hard disk attached, disk0 is usually mounted to /. In your case disk1 is mounted to / which is a typical hint for Core Storage Volume Group - in case of an internal Fusion Drive disk2 is mounted to / and disk0 and disk1 usually don't appear entering df -h.\nOpen Terminal and enter diskutil cs list to get all CoreStorage objects in a tree-like view.\nUse this comprehensive list of documented and undocumented commands to manipulate your CoreStorage Volume Group.\n", "Q: how to check if it is safe to delete iNode file (or how to inspect its contents)? How do I check if it is safe to delete the following file?\n$ cd /lost+found/\n$ file iNode44670523\niNode46670523: xar archive -version 1\n\nNote: the date of the file indicates it is about 1 year old. the first 4 characters of the file are \"xar!\"\ncan I just delete it (it's probably backed up by Time Machine) and reboot and check that everything runs fine as it is? is there any simple way to inspect the contents of the file?\n\nA: If you're comfortable using the terminal, you might be able to figure out what the file is. If you're not comfortable using terminal, I wouldn't worry about doing this. I was doing this mainly for my own interest rather than any real need.\nOpen terminal and enter the following commands (enter the text following the $):\n$ cd /lost+found\n$ ls -l\ntotal 10087432\n-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  5164763151 25 Oct  2014 iNode10324487\n\n$ file iNode10324487\niNode10324487: xar archive - version 1\n\nThis tells me the iNode10324487 file is meant to be of type xar, which is an archive file. A quick search for \"binary file xar\" finds the man page for the xar utility on OS X. This tells me that I can view the list of files contained within the xar file with the following command:\n$ xar -t -f iNode10324487\nDistribution\nInstallMacOSX.pkg\nInstallMacOSX.pkg/Bom\nInstallMacOSX.pkg/Payload\nInstallMacOSX.pkg/Scripts\nInstallMacOSX.pkg/PackageInfo\nInstallMacOSX.pkg/InstallESD.dmg\nResources\nResources/ar.lproj\n...\n\nSo the orphaned file that I've got taking up 5.16GB on my disk looks like an OS X installer package. I'm pretty confident that I don't need that, so I can delete it.\n\nA: File in lost+found are fragments of files that have been found by a disk repair job (usually ran through disk utility). A more clear explanation in this thread. Extract:\n\nIf you run fsck, the filesystem check and repair command, it might find data fragments that are not referenced anywhere in the filesystem. In particular, fsck might find data that looks like a complete file but doesn't have a name on the system — an inode with no corresponding file name. This data is still using up space, but it isn't accessible by any normal means.\n\nThe file is probably unusable. The system doesn't rely on it, and if you don't have any use for it (which I'm assuming since you don't know what's in it) you are safe to delete it.\n", "Q: Custom keyboard layout: Command+V doesn't paste in Safari and Mail I have created a custom keyboard layout (.keylayout file) and remapped (amongst other keys) the X, C and V keys. However, I want to keep Cmd+X/C/V like on the QWERTY, because it's practical and I am used to it.\nSo in my layout, I have kept the original X, C, V mappings for when Command is pressed:\n<keyMap index=\"0\">  <!-- No modifiers -->\n  ...\n  <key code=\"7\" action=\"y\" /> <!-- my modified layout -->\n  <key code=\"8\" action=\"x\" />\n  <key code=\"9\" action=\".\" />\n...\n<keyMap index=\"10\">  <!-- command -->\n  ...\n  <key code=\"7\" output=\"x\" /> <!-- same as qwerty -->\n  <key code=\"8\" output=\"c\" />\n  <key code=\"9\" output=\"v\" />\n\nThis works well except for Command+. (which should do a Command+V, i.e. paste) in Safari, Mail and a few other Apple applications… In that case, using the original V key (on a QWERTY keyboard) does work…\nI don't understand why it fails just for this shortcut? I've read that some Cmd+… shortcuts are special and can't be overridden, but why does it work with cut/copy but not with paste? And why does it work in all applications except Safari and Mail?\n\nI've used the bepo (french dvorak) layout and edited it in a text editor. My version is on GitHub. I have opened my layout in Ukulele and it shows it quite fine, is there anything I could try with it to debug/detect problems?\nI have also tried to open+save my layout with Ukulele and it doesn't work anymore, it's not even detected by OS X. I have reverted back to my version. \n\nA: I'm not surprised you may be experiencing this issue with Apple Software. Basically the Command-. keyboard shortcut has been used by Mac OS for decades as a universal \"halt operations\" keyboard shortcut. \nIn a sense it works in a similar way to the ESC key. So I am thinking this is why you are experiencing problems with this keyboard shortcut. It used to be that software developers had to respect this Command-. keyboard shortcut for any software they developed for the Mac platform, but this is no longer the case, hence why your keyboard shortcut may be working with some software but not others. You may want to read the Keyboard Shortcuts page in the macOS Human Interface Guidelines.\nExtra Info\nApple first introduced the Command key in 1980 with the Apple III computer.\nThe purpose of the Command key was to allow users to enter keyboard commands in applications and within the operating system. The Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines have always recommended that developers use the Command key (and not the Control or Option keys) for this purpose. \nA small set of keyboard commands (such as cut and paste, open and save) are standard across all applications. If an application needs more shortcuts than can be obtained with the twenty-six letters of the English alphabet, double modifiers such as Command+Option are used.\nThe Macintosh keyboard's other unusual modifier key, the Option key, serves as a modifier both for entering keyboard shortcuts and for typing text — it is used to enter foreign characters, typographical symbols, and other special characters.\nAs mentioned previously, the Command-. shortcut was once a universal recommended shortcut, but this is no longer reserved by macOS. In fact, Table 67-3 of the macOS Human Interface Guidelines now only lists one keyboard shortcut with a period (.) in it. This is the Control-Option-Command-. keyboard shortcut for increasing screen contrast. You can read more about this in Accessibility Programming Guide for OS X.\n", "Q: Private WiFi network between OSX and Android I want to use a remote control app for presentations I'm giving offsite, using my Android phone as a remote for my MacBook. (the software is Unified Remote)\nI have no guarantee that I can access a WiFi network offsite (or that there will even be one), so I wanted to keep things simple and just setup a private AdHoc network.\nTo my dismay, I have discovered that Androids do not recognise the AdHoc network created by MacBooks.\nWhat other viable solutions are there?\nI have to give presentations often, so I'm hoping for a solution that is easily switchable between normal WiFi use and \"presentation mode\".\nOther options I've looked into\nUsing the connection sharing under Sharing -> Internet, but as I have no other active connection, this is disabled.\nI've tried the solutions listed in this Stack Overflow question but they seem to be windows only.\n\nA: Other than your self-found answer, my suggestion would have been to get an Airport Express base station and take it with you all the time.  All it is requiring is an extra power outlet.\nAny other router would possibly do as well, but the Airport Express is fairly small and fits into almost every pocket.\nSince you frequently do presentations and it can be used at home or elsewhere as well, the price tag would not be too bad either.\n\nA: Seems I was wrong about Apples Internet connection sharing, you can in fact share an inactive connection (eg internet), and create a Hotspot that Android can see in that way.\nAn example is at this site: https://gigaom.com/2008/05/22/create-a-wifi-hotspot-share-your-internet-connection-in-leopard/\n", "Q: Re-install Mac mini Server My friend gave me Mac mini Server saying its Mavericks. When I switch it on I see 2 hard drives only and no operating system. I tried to use my Apple ID but it doesn't work. In disk utility I saw 1st hard drive has partition named \"os\" which I am not able to delete. How do I completely format both the hard drives and re-install Mavericks on that. I have a very slow internet and I don't have another mac, of course I have Linux and Windows dual boot machine.\n\nA: In disk utility via safe mode, you should be able to format it completely by wiping the disk.\nThen after wiping the disk, boot into a DVD or USB of OS X and reformat from there.\n\nA: While we (and possibly you yourself as well) do not know what type of Mac Mini Server hardware you have, you can check this at the following Apple websites by using the serial number of your computer found at the underside:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check Your Service and Support Coverage\n\n*Tech Specs (click on \"Browse by product\")\n\n\nRespecting that you stated that you have a slow Internet connection, keep in mind that Mac OS X 10.7 Lion and later (Mavericks included) needs to be downloaded from the Internet, which is about 5 GB for each OS (plus 2 GB for the server extension in case of OS X 10.7 Lion).  The Mac Mini Server being a small computer, you can try to bring it to a friend to download it there, if they have a faster connection.\n\nNevertheless, here are some options for you:\n\nFor a Mac Mini Server (Mid 2010) or before, try one of the following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the installation media which came with the Mac (e.g. Mac OS X Server 10.6) to install the OS again (if you do not have an optical drive with it, you will need to have a different Mac sharing its optical drive or try to clone the disc to a USB thumb drive)\n\n*If a later version of Mac OS X is installed, you could use the built-in Recovery HD to install that version of Mac OS X the Recovery HD was created for (you will need to have obtained that version with your Apple ID or it will not work to authenticate the install).\n\n\nFor a Mac Mini Server (Mid 2011) or later, try the following option:\nAt startup, hold down Cmd+Alt+R to bypass any built-in recovery system and boot from the Internet Recovery (about 350-480 MB download).\nThis will give you the option to install the original OS which came with that Mac Mini Server.  Since that version is hardware-bound, no Apple ID is required to install it.\n\nOnce installed, you need to do the following to use Mavericks (or later):\n\n\n*\n\n*update the system to the latest version, then\n\n*\n\n*if you own Mavericks already, download it from the list of purchases from the App Store\n\n*if you do not own it, you can download the latest version of OS X, which is Yosemite\n\n\n", "Q: How to automatically switch to English when I switch to particular application? I use 3 languages intensively on my iMac - English, Ukrainian and Russian. In some applications, however, I'd like the input to be automatically changed to a particular language.\nFor example, in software development applications, in console and in launchpad, I'd like to always get English turned on automatically.\nAre there any ways to configure this?\n\nA: Go to Settings -> Keyboard and select the rightmost tab (Sorry only got German Os X at the moment, so I do not know the exact english words which will be displayed).\nAt the bottom there is a checkbox (the label is something with automatic change input source for documents ...) -> check it. Now you have to select the language for every document at first. But every time you switch back OS X will change the keyboard layout.\n", "Q: Can the Macbook 12 inch handle XCode/Eclipse for Android/iOS development? I know that Macbook 12 inch was created for battery life and it's lightness instead of performance, but I am really curious about it's performance for development purposes.\nDid anyone actually test it on the real device? If so, what do you think? If not, what's your opinion anyways?\nWhile XCode is compiling, will I be able to open safari without seeing \"the rainbow\"? Slow compilation is not a problem, but I want to know if it hogs the whole OS or not.\n\nA: The question is quite opinion based. Can it handle development - absolutely. Will it be fast enough - now that's a matter of your personal reception of \"fast enough\".\nThe MacBook is quite a capable machine. It will run Development-Tools without any issues. It will perform lower than a MacBook Pro CPU and GPU-wise, so it really depends on your personal needs. Use something like Activity Monitor to keep an eye on your current system load during your daily tasks. If your machine is often at it's limits, you will have to take sacrifices with a MacBook. If your machine idles a lot and is only pushed to the edge rarely, you'll probably be happy with the machine.\n", "Q: iCloud Photos: What happens when deleted from phone If I delete photos from my All Photos, will they be deleted from iCloud also?\n\nA: If you enable iCloud Photo Library all your devices stay in sync. So deleting/adding a picture on one device will delete/add it on all others (and the Cloud) as well.\n", "Q: How do i fully delete an old account so that it stops asking for updates? My ex-partner had an account on my Mac. When we broke up, we deleted his account. However, some of the applications that he has downloaded keep asking for updates. I cannot delete these apps, as it wants him to sign in but I do not have his log-in details. How can I delete these apps and stop the computer from continually asking for updates!?\n\nA: By the general term \"app\", you ostensibly mean App Store? And if you did delete his Apple ID, then it wouldn't ask for updates.\nYou can either use a third-party program to remove those apps, or first delete them from the applications directory, then from Application Support located at ~/Library/Application\\ Support/. If you cannot find it, then go to Terminal, located in Applications/Utilities  and execute:\nopen ~/Library/Application\\ Support/\n\nThen you can just delete the folder under the name of that app\nThen, simply logout of his Apple ID if you failed in deleting it, and login your Apple ID\n", "Q: New Photo app - upload speed to iCloud photos really so slow? I installed the new Photos app and imported my Aperture library (about 50.000 photos altogether. As I had a bad experience when my hdd with my pictures was stolen, I want to upload all of them to iCloud. (I am not a professional photographer)\nSo far so good: but in the last three days, only about 5000 photos were uploaded. In other words: 30 days to go...\nIs this to be expected? \nDoes anybody has any experiences with uploading that many photos?\nI am obviously uploading via ethernet (1000 baseT) and the internet connection is not nearly saturated.\n\nA: Just realized, it is on my side and my upload is saturated since I installed Photos - so it is not Apple's fault:\n\nIf I am not mistaken, it should be done in about 12-15 days.\n\nA: Looking at my speeds it appears that Apple presently is limiting it.  I have 1/2 a gig of upload speed but i'm showing about 200 gig going up and I have not limited by upload speed at all.  When doing an icloud backup from an iOS device it uses ALL the bandwidth and that slows other devices on the network and often disrupts connections so I think this may be intentional to throttle the upload of photos.  I have 50K pictures as well and I've been at it for several weeks with very little progress.\n\nA: You can try using the Network Link Conditioner (NLC) system preference panel from the Apple Developer site to limit your network connection speed.\nhttps://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action…\nAfter you install NLC, open it and create a new profile. Limit the Uplink speed. I chose about 60% of my available uplink bandwidth and that seems to work OK. Set the Downlink limit to something at least close to your ISP's bandwidth or above.\nYou'll probably need to play around with the limits. Remember that it affects all of the network traffic in and out of the computer so something like a Time Capsule backup might go really, really slowly.\n", "Q: How to change keyboard type if that option is no longer visible? I am using an EU keyboard layout and the button below the ESC key is \"double quotes\" on OSX 10.10.3\nSuddenly that key is automatically changed to the < >| key\nI checked keyboard layout and it is correct.\nI think the keyboard assistant (which asks you to press the button near the left shift) can solve this issue, but I can't find that utility. System Preferences > Keyboard no longer shows Change Keyboard Type. \nHow can I find/open that Keyboard Assistant or make that Change Keyboard Type button appear again?\n\nA: You might be able to launch Keyboard Setup Assistant manually, if the 'Change Keyboard Type' button is missing..\nIt's in /System/Library/CoreServices/KeyboardSetupAssistant.app\nI'm not sure what governs its running. I can run it manually on one Mac with Mojave, but not another on Big Sur [It looks like it's going to launch, but doesn't].\n\nA: I'm probably missing something, but try to go into System Preferences, Keyboard and then choose the Input Sources tab. Check the Show Input menu in menu bar (so you can choose your keyboard easily later) and -if needed- add any keyboard layout you may be missing from there. Btw, the only keyboards I could find with double quotes under the ESC key are Croation, Serbian and Slovenian... Is it one of these you mean with EU ?\n", "Q: Macbook pro late 2011 cannot access windows based server through VPN I am trying to use vpn to access a Windows based server. I set up the VPN when I was at the office, and was able to connect when I was connected to the internet at the office through VPN, but as soon as I went home, I tried it and it did not work.\nI have no idea what I am doing wrong I even read to send all traffic through the VPN and tried that and it didn't work.\nIs it possible to access VPN with a Mac into a Windows based server.\n\nA: When you were at the office, did you use a different network like a AT&T/Verizon/Sprint hotspot?  Next time, try testing at a Starbucks or another public wifi first.\nMore than likely the VPN server dosen't allow loop backs (meaning you are in the network to start, go out, to come back in).  It probably just connected you.\nWhat VPN (server) are you using?  What error message did you get?\nIn my past experiences, I have found that SSL VPNs are the way to go especially with Macs.\n", "Q: jailbreak gone bad - how to fix? (running ios 7.0.3 and used evasion) I've tried jailbreaking my 4S running 7.0.3 using evasi0n, but this resulted in a bootloop (i.e. stuck at apple logo) which seems to be quite common! :/\nAnyway, I've searched the net for solutions and it seems the only way to get this fix is to restore using IPSW.\nBut since I'm running on iOS7, I wanna keep it that way.\nIs there a way to restore my phone running iOS 7.0.3 to the same version? I've always seen replies where people says they can't downgrade to an earlier version because Apple has stopped signing. So I'm not really sure how this works when it comes to staying on the same but old version.\nThanks! :)\n\nA: Apple doesn't sign iOS 7 for the iPhone 4s any more which means that you can't install it, regardless of what your current version of iOS is.\nHowever, you may be able to do a semi-restore using semirestore7.\n", "Q: Safari: search producing unpredictable results I've observed something weird with Safari search. The search is unable to find words that are obviously present. \nFor example, I went to this page. I know that the phrase 'lincRNA' is present on the page, therefore I expect to be able to search for 'RNA' (which works), 'lincRNA' (which works) and 'ncRNA' (which fails).\nDoes anyone else have the same experience? Are you able to reproduce this?\nThanks,\nPaul\n\nA: I've just discovered a hidden feature in Safari search that solves my problem. The attached picture shows the solution.\nSafari can search both for instances 'containing' the query or those that 'start with' the query. I imagine the default is 'starts with', which is why I raised the above question.\n\n\nA: This is the desired behavior (by Apple). The only case in which Safari searches within a word is if it's parted through capitalization.\nAn example to explain why this makes sense. If I'd search for something like \"or\" it would then also find occurrences in words like \"door\", \"therefor\", \"store\", etc.\n", "Q: Is there a fan in the Late 2013 iMac?

What can I do to\n  activate the iPad and/or get my username/password combination?\n\n\nA: That sounds like you had \"Find my iPad\" enabled in iCloud. It's made to protect your iPad against theft (or at least make it potentially useless to thieves). You won't get around logging into your iCloud. \nIf you also have it on a Mac you could check if your password is stored in the Keychain (located in Applications/Utilities).\nElse you'll have to reset the password, you can do that on Apple's iForgot page. If none of the options on that page help you, you'll have to call Apple and they'll try to verify that you're the owner of the account and help you reset your password. \nAs a hint: your Username is usually you're E-Mail address. \n", "Q: What is a locked hard drive, and how does it relate to encryption? When I mount a Mac hard drive on another computer, I often get prompted to \"unlock\" the drive. What does this mean? Is a locked hard drive different from an encrypted one, or is \"unlocking\" just decrypting the drive for one-time use (as opposed to permanently decrypting)? When I boot the drive in its normal computer I'm not prompted for a FileVault password, which is what's making me wonder if this is encryption-related or not.\n\nA: A locked hard drive is a hard drive that is encrypted.\nWhen you unlock the drive you are telling the system how to interpret the encrypted data. Unlike permanent decrypting, the data on the drive stays encrypted, you are just telling it how to read the encrypted data on the fly.\nOn its normal computer information will have been saved into the system's keychain allowing it to access the drive without prompting you for a code. If you open Keychain Access on that Mac and search for the name of the drive, or sort the list by \"Kind\", you should find an \"encrypted volume password\" entry. That is what the Mac is using to unlock the drive without prompting you.\n", "Q: How can I get automator to select the correct already open document?

As of last week, I was running an external Dell 24\" monitor connected with a Thunderbolt to DisplayPort cable and rotated to portrait orientation without problems. This morning when I reconnected my computer, I could not get native resolution output to the monitor.\n![Resolutions before selecting native resolution][1]\nIn the Displays preference pane, I noticed it was set to scale to 1080p resolution. I clicked on the native resolution. The displays flickered. The external monitor display was restored but still running at 1080. At this point, there were no longer any resolution options in the box although scaled is still selected.\n![Resolutions after selecting native resolution][2]\nIf I select \"Default for display,\" that radio button turns on for a split second before reverting to \"Scaled\" with no resolution options.\nI changed the rotation back to standard, and the display runs at normal resolution. I called AppleCare and was told I would have to contact Dell. The senior support rep told me that the monitor rewrites the driver in the OS to provide the rotation setting and that it is not supported by Apple and is only a setting that exists after the monitor sends information to the computer (which sounds pretty wacky to me).\nAt one point, I switched the orientation to 270 degrees rather than 90 and got native resolution. When I then switched back to standard and again to 270, I was back to 1080 with the same issue as the 90 degree rotation.\nI feel like this has to be an issue either with the graphics driver in OS X or with the graphics card. Outside not being able to display above it's native resolution, I can't imagine the monitor is making a decision about what images to display based on their rotation. In fact, I don't think the monitor is at all aware of either its physical orientation nor of the orientation of the image. Am I right about this? Does anyone have a suggestion for how I might fix this problem?\nUpdate: Console output changing orientation to 90 degrees and back to standard: https://gist.github.com/raddevon/fcd76586bf4170bc4ae7\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem, with the same monitor, Dell U2713 / U2713H / U2713HM / U2713HMt. I had two of them plugged in to my late-2014 Retina Macbook Pro 15\" and only one was experiencing the problem. I tried 100s of different solutions (I can say for sure it's definitely not the cable!) and nothing worked. Just like you, I could get landscape 2560x1440 but not portrait. And I was getting the same error WindowServer: description_for_mode_number: IOFBGetPixelInformation failed (-536870206) when I tried to switch to portrait. That is, until I came across this: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5485930?start=0&tstart=0. I regenerated the EDID override for the screen using the Ruby script, copied it into the correct location, rebooted and now it works again. I think I caused the problem by playing a game (Trine 2) in vertical (720x1280) resolution - after that, I tried everything to get the screen back to displaying portrait 1440x2560 but to no avail. Until I got the Ruby script from the thread above which fixed it.\nJust to note, in case the linked thread disappears... the override file is in /System/Library/Displays/Overrides/ under the folder DisplayVendorID-10ac which is for Dell displays.

(Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be possible to post Automator code in a readable format).\nfor f in \"$@\"\ndo\n fileSuffix=\"link\"\n fileExists=`ls -d \"$f $fileSuffix\"`\n fileNumber=0\n\n until [ $fileExists==\"\" ]; do\n  let fileNumber+=1\n  fileSuffix=\"link $fileNumber\"\n  fileExists=`ls -d \"$f $fileSuffix\"`\n done\n\n echo \"$f $fileSuffix\"\n ln -s \"$f\" \"$f $fileSuffix\"\ndone\n\n\nA: While a symbolic link (UNIX alias) looks the same as a Finder alias inside Finder, they are two complete different types of aliases.\nA symbolic link will only hold the path it leads to and will permanently or temporarily break if the resource is moved or on a disconnected drive or share respectively.\nA Finder alias is technically an ordinary file with instructions for the Finder.  The Finder can use this information to locate a moved target file/directory to a certain extent.  If a target resource of an alias is on a mounted network share point, it also holds information of which Keychain item to use to log you in to the share point in order to open it.\nSo, unless you write a script or program to read out the Finder alias file, it will not use it as a directory, but as a file in Terminal.\nAlternatively, you can remove the current Finder alias and create a symbolic link in its place.  Command would be ln -s /path/to/original to create a symbolic link at the current directory.  The path can be a full or relative path.\n\nA: *\n\n*@markhunte's applescript worked, but there was a warning message:\nosascript[9807:7154723] CFURLGetFSRef was passed an URL which has no scheme (the URL will not work with other CFURL routines)\nBy the help of this tip, I modified @markunte's applescript to remove above warning message\n\n\n*@markhunte's applescript is slightly slow because it always invokes the applescript.

First create the file on your Desktop (or whatever location you'd like):\ntouch ~/Desktop/PlexConnect.sh\nNext, set the permissions of the file such that it is executable:\nchmod +x ~/Desktop/PlexConnect.sh\nYou can then edit the contents of the script with your text editor of choice, just make sure it begins with the following line so that the system knows to run it using the shell (Bash):\n!/bin/bash\nThe file can then be double-clicked, launching Terminal and executing it.\nA more elegant solution for this, however, may be to create an AppleScript application which runs the command for you. Open the \"Script Editor\" application and paste in the following:\ndo shell script \"/Applications/PlexConnect-master/PlexConnect.py\" with administrator privileges\nSave this as an \"Application,\" naming it whatever you'd like. When opening it, it will give you OS X's standard password prompt, execute the script, then close itself.\n", "Q: Where are TextEdit files that are not moved to iCloud Drive stored?

It does exist in System Preferences > Internet Accounts, but does not exist in Mail. \nI am updated to 10.10.3 and Mail.app is Version 8.2 (2098)\nAnyone have a fix?\n\nA: For me the problem turned out to be simpler. \"Mail\" was not enabled for my Google account. To fix it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Go to Internet Accounts\n\n*Check your Google account. Make sure that \"Mail\" is enabled.\n\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem with my Mail (8.2 (2098)). I think that the problem was caused by the fact that I was living in China, so the Great Firewall blocked (almost) all Google-related connections. I had to use VPN-connection to access Gmail.\nI tried your methods without success. Nevertheless, I found out that Google was actually blocking the Mail connection attemps so I had to \"unblock\" it by the next easy steps:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Start the browser on your device\n  \n*Sign in to Gmail\n  \n*Go here: https://accounts.google.com/b/0/DisplayUnlockCaptcha - press Continue\n  \n*Go back to your client and try the failed operation again.\n\nI hope this was helpful.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences and then Internet Accounts and tick off Mail. \nThis would work in the case that: you already have the account set up, but have Mail disabled on it. (For instance, you may have only Calendar and Contacts sync enabled on it currently).\n\nA: I read the other responses, they didn't work for me (and I don't want to log out of Icloud because that's a time waster).\nThis is the way I fixed it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a mail alias (you can find this in settings of outlook.com or\ngmail)\n\n*Use this alias to log in \n\n*Go to settings and set the alias to your original \n\n*Stop wasting time on this unprofessional bug of apple\n\n\nA: Yes - this can be caused by three things. iCloud being messed up (and trying to sync your internet accounts) and corruption on the Mail settings and corruption in general in your user settings.\nTo troubleshoot this:\nA. Write down your add/remove procedure and don't deviate from it. My guess is it should be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Mail and make sure it doesn't launch when you log in\n\n*Remove the account from system prefs\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Add the account in - optionally test something other than mail first like a bogus calendar entry to check the account and google servers.\n\n*Test Mail by enabling the account and then finally launching Mail\n\n\nB. Set up a brand new user account - with no iCloud and no Apple ID. Try adding the mail account there from System Preferences - Internet Accounts Preference Pane\nIf that doesn't work - your gmail is messed up or you need to reinstall the Mac from scratch (i.e. something is really wrong with the OS - this would be my last resort - make sure Gmail settings are clear at that point before backing up and wiping the Mac)\nC. Sign out of iCloud on your Mac with your normal account.\nGet a good backup before you delete content on the Mac. You will want to delete anything that's synced to iCloud to let the system clear out data that depends on iCloud. If you're paranoid, export data like Contacts and Calendar to a stand alone export/backup before you take this step. Then repeat the remove/add procedure.\nD. Go to the logs. You'll need to run sysdiagnose Mail and then get into Console app and perhaps Log Connection Activity by opening the Mail Connection Doctor and checking that option.\n\n\nA: Open System Preferences, click on Internet Accounts and Google (mail), then you see some checkbox so click on Mail app. Then you will easily be able to login.\n\nA: I was struggling with this and tried all of the other answers.  \nOn closer inspection in the Accounts list I found that during my El Capitan upgrade the installer had renamed one of my email accounts to be the same as another (I missed this in my list of a dozen or so accounts), and disabled the account.  It was the account that El Capitan said already existed.  \nI simply correctly renamed the account and re-enabled it. (And then had to go fix all of the many rules referencing the account and its mailboxes).\n\nA: My version of this issue is that:\n- my apple or iCloud id is user@gmail.com\n- the email account I'm trying to add is also user@gmail.com\nHere's what works for me:\n- remove iCloud account\n- add my gmail account\n- add iCloud account\nSeems like this may be a bug with Apple's \"internet account\" software.\n\nA: I did the following and it worked: I put in a wrong password, the whole info came up, put in the right password, and voila\n\nA: I tried many solutions, however the only thing that solved my issue was to add my gmail account using \"Add Other Account...\" with incoming server \"pop.gmail.com\" and outgoing server \"smtp.gmail.com\"... instead of clicking on the Google logo for adding an \"Internet Account\" in OSX.\n\nA: I had a related problem: I changed the password on my Google accounts, and discovered that I couldn't get Apple Mail/Internet Accounts to update -- I'd enter the new password but get the \"account already exists\" error message. The solution turned out to be easy. I went into my Keychains, looked for everything with \"google\" in it, and removed them all. Some of them were more than two years old, and I've changed my Google password several times in that period. Once that was clean, I was able to set up Google anew in the Internet Accounts section and everything synced. \n\nA: I have had the same problem on my new MacAir running 10.11.3, for both yahoo & Gmail.\nFor me it was solved by simply un-ticking & then re-ticking the mail option for both accounts -> Internet Accounts -> System Preferences. Both accounts then appeared in the Mail app and emails very quickly started to sync. \n\nA: I found a solution that worked for me and was pretty quick and easy.  It's posted over here:\nhttp://disq.us/p/1docj72\nIt basically asserts that the iCloud is conflicting with the account, so you log out of iCloud, then enter the passwords, then log back in.\niCloud will scare you (maybe rightfully so) by warning you that it will delete all your data when you log out - seems insane, doesn't it!  But, when you log back in, it will restore all that data (caveat, I don't use iCloud for much of my data, so you probably want to be sure to have a back up, just in case - TimeMachine will probably do)\n\nA: I did not have to delete my iCloud account and it turned out the answer was very simple. When you are in accounts, and it wants you to enter \"Outgoing SMTP account\" enter the name of the account that you already set up with the SMTP information. The User Name, Password, Host name, Port and authentication will automatically be entered. Press save.\n\nA: This helped me (and prevented me from doing a complete wipe out of my mac) : https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7260368?start=0&tstart=0\n", "Q: Are there two separate network systems on a Mac? One that is controlled through the GUI in OS X, and one that is controlled through the Terminal? I have a 2012 refurbished Mac mini running Yosemite 10.10.3. Often I \ncannot connect via Wi-fi. I am not usually given a specific reason, but it does actively tell me It can't connect. It does not just fail. However all my iOS devices are connected all the time and work with no issue. \nIn System Preferences, Network, only the wifi is active. In troubleshooting, I have systematically disabled all other network interfaces, which has helped a little. \nHowever, in Terminal, although everything is off in Mac OS X GUI, ifconfig says everything is up and running here. Lo0, en0, en1, en2, fw0, p2p0, bridge0, awdl0 all firing on all cylinders, promiscuous settings on, multicast, broadcast, higher than normal MTU (lo0 is at 16384) and a bunch of extra MAC addresses I have never seen or ever been able to utilize from Mac OS X. \nI know Network System Preferences matches to en0 Ethernet, en1 to Wi-fi, fw0 to FireWire. And of course lo0 is the loopback adapter. \nBut what about the others? With unknown MAC addresses? Some are piggybacking on my existing. P2p0 uses my Wi-fi MAC address. Bridge0 uses all zeroes which I think means it can use any available MAC address. \nWhen I turned all these extra interfaces off, via Terminal, my connection improves dramatically. But they were off already. They show as such in the network settings. \nSo Is this a separate system? With different devices? If not, why such discrepancies between whats turned on or off between the OS and Terminal?\nWhat can I do to get a little more control over my network?\n\nA: There is only one set of network interfaces on any Mac. But they have two different interfaces to manage them with different level of functions:\n\n*\n\n*a CLI (Command Line Interface),\n\n*a GUI (Graphical User Interface).\n\nMoreover, all the network interfaces are named differently through the 2 managment interfaces. Ex.: en0 / CLI = Ethernet / GUI\nThe GUI is for all users, from beginners to advanced GUI users. The GUI achieve a correct locking mechanism when you use different interfaces or other System Preferences which have to interact with any netwok interface\n(for ex.: Internet Sharing).\nThis is an interface with a simplified set of \"clickdrome windows\". This GUI doesn't give you access to all the interfaces functions.\nThis GUI maintains its own database (a set of plist files).\nThis GUI doesn't manage correctly every change you can do at the CLI level.\nThe CLI will make direct use of system calls provided by the underlying operating system (which is a Unix) but won't make any update to the GUI database.\nOn the other hand, the CLI is for network engineers or system admins who are at ease with pfctl, ifconfig, netstat, traceroute….\nMy personal experience is: be cautious when you use CLI that can modify details which are not visible within the GUI but are maintained within the GUI database.\n\nA: IMHO...The is one hardware piece (card/chip) and one of each networking protocols.\nFor example you can only have one WiFi active, or one Ethernet and so on. \nSome work in parallel when the Networking protocol does not interfere.\n", "Q: OSX Auto Audio Adjuster? On many smart TVs or Windows computers, there is a feature called smart audio adjustment. It basically prevents the audio from going too loud or too quite when playing files that has audio output, such as a movie. I like to know if there is a similar feature or if there is an OSX application that can accomplish similar goal.\n\nA: That depends what app are you using.\nFor example iTunes, you can set that up in preferences.\n\nFor example VLC player, you can set that up in Audio Effects.\n\nIt all depends what app are you using.\n\nA: Boom3D (paid, $17) can do this system wide for all applications. Enable \"Night Mode\" in settings. The little slider (headphone icon on left, speaker on right) determines how aggressively the program will limit volume changes.\n(I highly encourage disabling and ignoring all of this program's other \"features\", except for 3D Surround when applicable. The voodoo processing will ultimately just distort whatever you're listening too.)\nThe technical term for this is \"Dynamic Range Compression\", although you won't see Boom3D using that name either.\nEdit: I didn't realize Boom now cost $17—I'm pretty sure it was closer to $10 when I first bought it.

And I know that they sync between devices but do they sync screenshots and saved photos or only photos that are taken with the phones camera?\n\nA: If you have Photostream turned on and set it to download Photostream photos, then iPhoto will put them in an Event by month. It will look similar to other photo Events that you've created. iCloud Photo Library sees these as just normal photos and will upload them. Everything in the System Library (which means the default Photos library) will get uploaded, so the only way to stop it is to turn off iCloud Photo Library or put those photos into a separate Photos library.\nIf you have iCloud Photo Library turned on in your Mac and iPhone, then they will eventually sync up.\nAll pictures in your iPhone Photos app will get uploaded into iCloud Photo Library (including screenshots and saved photos from other apps/internet).\n", "Q: Suspicious NDTV notification pop-ups in my Mac Yosemite 10.10 I started to have notification pop-ups called NDTV since a week ago and I can't find a way to remove it.

If you open TextEdit and make a document, you never have to save your work or choose where the untitled document is stored. TAL saves it and then assists with versioning once you explicitly save the document to the filesystem or cloud.\nIf you're not convinced your running program ships from Apple, use mdfind talagent to examine where the tool is installed. It’s possible someone made software to look like a proper tool to do other things.\nApple runs it at 3 am on Mondays and Thursdays on your Mac by default, so there's not much mystery that it runs and then exits as opposed to something that runs forever waiting for work to do.\nIt's nice to double check since governments are now clearly equipped to suppress knowledge of their state sponsored malware by using legal threats and gag orders. I'd say some healthy skepticism is in order when you see something not right on your computer.\n", "Q: iOS data usage specifics - iTunes Accounts I'm trying to find out what does \"iTunes Accounts\" traffic stands for on iOS, since it has gobbled 850MB on cellular data in 13 days.\nI have iTunes Match on but have disabled the Music app to access data on cellular networks.\nI'm on iOS 8.3 since today, data was consumed on 8.2.\n\nA: Probably iTunes & App Store background downloads.\nYou can prevent these, so it only updates when you're connected to wifi, in\nSettings > iTunes & App Store…  by disabling Cellular Data\n[I also prevent all automatic downloads, so mine only updates from iTunes itself, on my Mac]\n\n\nA: Seems like it might be iCloud documents syncing Settings -> iCloud -> iCloud Drive (scroll to the bottom to turn off cellular data). \nAlso seems like iTunes music \"new music mix\" might come in under this. \n\nA: Wow, my phone (iOS 10 now) shows this as 129MB in the last month since reset, with all the above turned off\nI don't even play Music on my phone, only listen to Podcasts (which has a separate total of 74MB).\nSeriously confused!\nSorry I don't have an answer but thought this might be a useful data point confirming that a significant amount can be run up without the data being enabled tor iTunes & App Store\n", "Q: How to completely disable Ubiquity (iCloud syncing?) in Mavericks or above? I'm trying to debug a strange problem that is causing a Mac to unpredictably switch off instantly without warning. Looking at logs, the entries most recent before this last happened were to do with ubiquity, which I gather is to do with iCloud syncing (specifically, mmcs_engine_create, which I can't find any relevant info about), and TALagent, which I think might have been monitoring the live-ness of ubiquity.\nThe user doesn't use iCloud, so I'd like to completely disable it and related services to see if that stops the issue recurring. I've found guides on how to disable iCloud in Lion but the steps don't apply to Mavericks or above, and I'm struggling to find steps (it seems like Apple don't want to encourage users to disable iCloud, presumably because they hope to encourage its adoption).\nLooking at answers to How to completely uninstall iCloud?, it suggests simply signing out of iCloud to \"disable\" it, but the user in question has never signed in to iCloud, so there's nothing to sign out of (yet the logs show Ubiquity still periodically runs).\n\n(Mavericks answers would be ideal, but upgrading the OS might be an option, though I'd have to work around other compatibility issues, so Yosemite answers would be better than nothing)\n\nA: There isn't an \"ubiquity\" you can simply disable IMO. I would exhaust other avenues of solving this problem. Random shutdowns are irritating, but the best thing I have is to train the user to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get sysdiagnose each time it happens. (or right after the reboot / when the problem is noticed)\n\n*Log the date and time of the error on a piece of paper\n\n\nEstablish that you will review the results every 10 instances. Once you have 10 to 30 reports, you'll know quite certainly if there is a pattern or if there isn't. Also, you'll have enough logs to report a bug to Apple or open a ticket to get AppleCare (or whomever you pay for support) to look at the details and get a fix/suggestion. Without data, you'll be chasing phantoms and get so desperate you'll want to cut out the guts (or hopefully just an unused appendix) of an OS in hopes it will help.\n", "Q: How to change the PDF reader on Chome from Preview to Acrobat Reader on MacBook? How can I change the PDF reader on Chrome from Preview to Acrobat Reader on MacBook? The Adobe program is much more versatile and I prefer that one to Preview. In my Plug-ins in Chrome the Adobe Acrobat has the option to be de-activated as if it is the program I am using now.

However, the keyboard shortcuts only go up to \"Switch to Desktop 16.\" (i.e., System Preferences >> Keyboard >> Shortcuts >> Mission Control)\nI have twenty desktops, but the keyboard shortcuts only go up to sixteen. How can I fix this?\n\nA: Here's something I tried (on 10.9.5).  Unfortunately, it didn't work, but I'll note it here in case it inspires someone.\n\n\n*\n\n*I noticed that enabling System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Switch to Desktop 16 caused ~/Library/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist to update.\n\n*I found some information (1) (2) about that plist.\n\n*According to that second link, \"Switch to Desktop 1\" is action 118.\n\n*I tested enabling / disabling Switch to Desktop 16 in that System Preference pane whilst looking at the plist file, using /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Print :AppleSymbolicHotKeys\" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist and, as I expected, the \"enabled\" value for action 133 (=118+15) changed.\n\n*I added a value for action 134 based on action 133, which I hoped would cause ctrl-alt-6 to switch to Desktop 17: defaults write com.apple.symbolichotkeys AppleSymbolicHotKeys -dict-add 134 \"{enabled = true; value = { parameters = (65535, 22, 786432); type = 'standard'; }; }\"  Unfortunately this doesn't seem to have any effect on my system.\n\n*So: I think that the symbolichotkeys plist file contains a mapping from key presses to actions.  The actions include Switch to Desktop 1 through \nto Switch to Desktop 16, but there are no corresponding actions for desktops with higher numbers.  Sorry!\n\n\nA: If you cannot set your keyboard shortcuts past 16, then it is a limitation of the OS and nothing we do here is going to fix that.  However, you may wish to try out a utility called Karabiner.  \nIt allows you to remap and assign hot keys to pretty much anything so in theory, you should be able to map the remaining keys to your spaces. \nIt's free software but they do take donations. I encourage you to give it a shot and if it works I also encourage you to make a donation - whatever you feel the software is worth.  This allows you to try it out without a heavy commitment.\n", "Q: How can I use Applescript or any other utility to send a daily text message to my bank?

However this seems not true when I apply that backup in the initial setup-process of a mint MacBook—it will be a 10.10-version.\nIs there a way to restore such a updates from a Time Machine backup? Respectively are the OS-files actually stored in the backup anyway?\n\nA: Unless you excluded the OS files from the backup, Time Machine should've backed that up along with everything else; but in order to recover the entire OS (rather than just your user files), you have to do the restore differently: use the restore tool in Recovery Mode (reachable by starting the Mac with Command and R held down). However, there are a couple of warnings I should give about this route:\n\n\n*\n\n*I haven't tested it, but I think this form of restore will wipe out everything currently on the disk, replacing it with the earlier backup snapshot. Have you done anything important since the backup? If so, you should back that up before going this route.\n\n*If you'd excluded any files/folders from the backup, they'll be missing from the restore as well. It's fairly common to exclude the OS itself from backups, so if you'd done that this form of restore will not give you a bootable system.\n\n\nBecause of the above, I'd be inclined to stick with the restore you have, and simply reinstall the update.\nBTW, the question seems to contain a bit of a misunderstanding about how OS updates and backups work. Time Machine (and other backup systems) back up files and folders. An OS update isn't a file or folder that can be backed up as an item; instead, it's a bunch of changes to various system files and folders. If those files and folders are being backed up, the updated versions will be backed up; if not, they won't be. Similarly, you can't restore a system update, you can only restore the changed versions of the various system files (and since you don't know precisely which ones were changed, that pretty much means restoring all of the system files and folders).\n\nA: Time Machine doesn't back up the system, by design. Time Machine is for backing up your settings and your files, not the OS itself.\n", "Q: Opening Windows 8 through VirtualBox on a Macbook Air How do I open Windows through a virtual box on a Macbook Air?  I tried to select a virtual CD/DVD drive, but was not sure which file to select.\n\nA: Your question is a little unclear but if I understand you correctly, you can install Windows 8.1 as a virtual machine running within Mac O/S X.\nVirtualbox is a good (and free) download that will allow you to install Windows 8.1 inside Mac O/S X. All you need is a Windows 8.1 disk image file (on the PC it's called an ISO for it's file extension) that you purchase from Microsoft or someone who sells Windows downloads and a copy of the Virtualbox installer.\nThere is an active community that can answer any questions that the documentation does not cover right there on virtualbox.org.\nAnd that should get you started.\n", "Q: How to prolong battery life I have recently brought my self a MacBook Pro (2015) battery life because I was getting 4 hours or less on my MacBook Air (2010) that had about 800-880 cycle counts. Because of the battery issue with my MacBook Air I would like to know how to extend the battery life.\nIs there a way how I can make sure my battery lasts for more then 4 years while staying close to 10 hours?\n\nHere are a few things that I know about looking after batteries:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cycle counts (1 cycle count is 50% to 100% back to 50% etc.)\n\n*It is best to keep your battery between 20% and 80% (is it true?)\n\n\nWhat I want to know more of:\n\n\n*\n\n*More information on how cycle counts work (not sure if I fully understand them)\n\n*How to reduce number of cycle counts (less is better)\n\n*What is the battery life of an average use with 60% battery (between 20% and 80%) (need to last at least for 8+ hours without charging)\n\n*Any applications that prevents the computer being charged over 80% (if possible)\n\n*Any other tips for extending battery life\n\n\nMy end goal:\n\n\n*\n\n*I want to have good battery life (~10 hours) all the time and at least 8 (or as much as possible) hours in four years time (or 800+ cycles [which ever comes first]). \n\n\nThanks for the help\n\nA: Here is a place you can learn all about Batteries.\nBattery University.\nand from Apple here\nTo you question on 8+ hour, the new MacBook Air (2104 model) has that.\n\nThe 11-inch MacBook Air lasts up to 9 hours between charges and the\n  13-inch model lasts up to an incredible 12 hours.\n\nThe cycle count is only one of the indicator and can not be used as absolute measure of Battery status. You need to look at the Full Charged Capacity (in About This Mac- Power)to get total understanding of the battery status. That one indicates the capability of the battery to hold the charge indicating how many cells are not doing so well and not holding the charge.\nWith all that said, if you use the battery in the Apple prescribed manner, you can not prolog its life beyond the original design, or beyond the physics and chemistry involved. For example a battery will develop short circuits due to build up of Whiskers (growth of Li metal deposits) that short out portions of the cells during its life and there is not much you can do about that.\n", "Q: How to import older Aperture photo library after setting up new Photos app and a new library I was very timid to check out the new Photos.app, and therefore decided to just start a fresh library and have it sync what my phone had through iCloud Photo Library. \nAfter checking it out for a bit, I think I want to move forward entirely with Photos. But at this point, I don't know how I can add in my Aperture library without opening it as a different library (holding down Option), but then don't know how it handles the current iCloud Photo Library. \nI checked the menus, and import only preps you for importing photos, not another library. I can open my other libraries, but worried about what that will do with iCloud Photo Library. Do I just need to export everything? Do I open the other library and let it sync? \n\nA: There is no way to import an Aperture/iPhoto library except start a new Photos library and have it convert from an existing Aperture/iPhoto library.\nI think the best solution would be to start a new Photos library based on your existing Aperture library. Attach your iPhone to the Mac and wait for it to appear in the sidebar in Photos, then import everything it will let you from the phone. Finally, set it as the system library (Photos menu > Preferences > General tab > \"Use as System Photo Library\") and enable iCloud Photo Library (Photos menu > Preferences > iCloud > iCloud Photo Library).\nIn theory this should cause the images from your new combined Photos library (old Aperture library + what was on the phone) to upload to iCloud, while also downloading anything in iCloud that does not exist in your new Photos library. And in turn, your phone should download anything new that is uploaded to iCloud.\nThe step of syncing from your phone directly to the Mac should not be necessary, but is a backup just in case iCloud freaks out with the change in the System Photo Library and removes what you uploaded from your phone. It also saves Photos from having to download any of those photos, assuming it finds them to be duplicates of what's in iCloud.\n", "Q: How does Photos.app handle multiple libraries in relation to iCloud Photo Library? The new Photos.app allows you to hold down option to open up other libraries, for example Aperture and iPhoto libraries. \nHow does iCloud Photo Library handle this? Does it work in a way like iTunes Match, where a 'central' library lives in the cloud, and various libraries add to it? Or will you have to overwrite the library if you open another. \nThis question stems from another question I had on how to import an Aperture library after setting up a new one, but is more tied to how iCloud Photo Library handles this more than the Photos app - and the workflow/system around this. \n\nA: Only one library can be the \"system library\", which in turn is used for iCloud Photo Library (if enabled), but you can have as many other libraries as you want.\n\nA: Yes - that's exactly it. The library stored in iCloud is the \"truth\" and whenever you opt in a device to the cloud, two things happen.\n\n*\n\n*It prepares to upload - trying to not have two exact duplicates get uploaded to the cloud.\n\n*It downloads thumbnails for all cloud photos - trying to not have two exact duplicates in the final device version of the library.\n\nEach device can opt to get full resolution images or to further optimize (resample/recompress) the original.\nI say try since most people will find some photos they consider duplicates if they have long standing photo libraries, but it's actually pretty good in my experience. The wrinkle is that Macs can maintain as many Photos libraries as you wish, with only one tying into the cloud backed \"truth\".\nYou can work directly with that version of the \"truth\" Photos album through the Photos web app at https://www.icloud.com/#photos\nThe following information is synced through iCloud Photos:\n\n*\n\n*Photo Metadata (keywords, favorite status, date, title, name, description geolocation and other EXIF metadata about exposure, ISO, digitizer, lens, flash, etc...)\n\n*Photo Albums\n\nThe following information is not synced through iCloud Photos:\n\n*\n\n*Faces albums and databases\n\n", "Q: Adobe Illustrator CS6 with Java 8? Is it possible to run Adobe Illustrator CS6 with the current Oracle Java 8 rather than the legacy insecure Java 6 provided by Apple?\nI know this is related to this question where the generic answer was that it may be incompatible, but I'd like to know if there is some shady hack that makes it run anyway.\n\nA: On my Mac, the creation of these directories \nsudo mkdir /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk\nsudo ln -s '/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents' /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents\nsudo mkdir /System/Library/Java/Support/Deploy.bundle\n\nalone allow me to run Illustrator CS 6 even when neither Java 6 nor Java 8 is installed. Apparently, Illustrator only checks for the presence of these directories to determine whether Java is installed (it actually launches even when java itself is absent, provided directories above are created). I would like to know, which functionality in Illustrator CS 6 actually requires Java, as it apparently can launch without it.\nNote: On OS X 10.11 and later you'll need to disable System Integrity Protection from the Recovery HD using csrutil disable in Terminal. Have a look at: About System Integrity Protection on your Mac & How to Disable System Integrity Protection (rootless) in OS X El Capitan.\n\nA: After some experimenting, I found a working solution based on this discussion.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a directory /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk.\n\n*Create a symlink /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents to /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents from Java 8.\n\n*If missing, create an empty directory /System/Library/Java/Support/Deploy.bundle.\n\n\nYou'll probably need to be root to do this, so use sudo using an administrative account (consult an expert if you are inexperienced, use at your own risk):\nsudo mkdir /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk\nsudo ln -s '/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents' /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents\nsudo mkdir /System/Library/Java/Support/Deploy.bundle\n\nYou can ignore errors stating that something already exists.\n\nA: Just had to overcome this issue on mac os 10.12 Sierra. Then basically follow @Zac Jackson's guideline. Install java8 as supported on sierra (ie from oracle). The rest happens within recovery mode: \nBoot into the recovery partition by holding down Cmd-R upon startup. Then in the terminal app to disable \"rootless\", ie \"System Integrity Protection\":\ncsrutil disable\n\nCreate the directories:\n mkdir /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk\n mkdir /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/System/Library/Java/Support/Deploy.bundle\n\nThen reenable \"rootless\":\n csrutil enable\n\nRestart and Illustrator should be fine....\n\nA: To activate Illustrator CS6 on El Capitan, you may need to temporarily deactivate the \"rootless\" mode. To do this, boot into the recovery partition by holding down Cmd-R upon startup. Then use the terminal app to disable \"rootless\". The command is\ncsrutil disable\n\nIt will advise you to reboot. After rebooting, you can now create the directories\n/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk\n\nand\n/System/Library/Java/Support/Deploy.bundle\n\nThen you may reboot back into recovery mode, and run\ncsrutil enable\n\nto reactivate the \"rootless\" mode.\n\nA: Verified the last answer as a fix for the following:\nDreamweaver 5.5 \nIllustrator 5.1 <- crashes on exit\nBridge 5.1\nExtension Manager CS5.5\nFireworks 5.1\nMedia Encoder 5.5\nMedia Player\nAdobe Flash CS5.5, Adobe Flash Catalyst, and Adobe Flash Builder 4.5 \nall crash on launch with JVM errors. \nThis answers the question above concerning why Illustrator and other Creative Suite apps check for Java machine compatibility since all the Creative Suite products are supposed to be interoperable. For example, you are supposed to be able to launch Flash from Dreamweaver in order to insert a Flash object into a web page. \nAdditional details: Upgraded to El Capitan last night. using the Java 8 as provided by upgrade. I did not try to test Java in any browser yet.\nImportant note: The above instructions assume you know that you know you are supposed to be operating on your System Volume and where it is. When you boot up with  Cmd-R you will boot into the recovery partition. When you open Terminal you will be in the recovery partition. In order to get to the partition of your hard drive where your system volume is you must enter 'cd ..' a few times till you are at the top of the file tree then 'cd Volumes' and then 'cd [Your boot drive name]'. Then the directions above will accomplish what you want. I have yet to try the symlink solution because it doesn't seem applicable to El Capitan. \n[edit] In my first response I found that carrying out the fix suggested by archemdix and that solved the problem for most of the CS5.5 bundle. I apologize for the duplicate posts.\nI realized after a little research that when El Capitan wiped out the old Java and installed the newest version of the java runtime, it did not install the JDK. If you have just upgraded to El Capitan and you see the message \"It appears you do not have a Java Runtime installed\" when checking in Terminal with \"java -version\".\nI guess Apple figures developers are smart enough to figure this out.

So I created a .webloc file using a .vncloc file as a template (standard xml/plist format), but instead of opening in a Safari window, it is downloading the html of the website into a file.\nMy goal is to eventually write a cronjob that keeps the URL of a server with a dynamic IP address up to date in the file (in dropbox) so that I can just double-click it anytime and get the correct server page.\nThe contents of the file look like this:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>URL</key>\n    <string>http://**ipaddress...**:**port...**/</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nHow do I get the .webloc file to actually open and display in Safari, as if I were to have entered the URL myself?\n\nA: I found the simplest and most storage space efficient method:\n\n*\n\n*Open TextEdit (or any other plain text editor)\n\n*Paste this single line and update the URL in the quotes to your liking.\n\n{ URL = \"https://stackexchange.com\"; }\n\n\n\n*Save it as My Bookmark.webloc\n\n\n*\n\n*✅ Spotlight renders the website at the given URL nicely.\n\n*✅ A double-click in Finder opens the URL in Safari nicely.\n\n*Tested on macOS 11.6.6 Big Sur and Safari 15.5\n\n*Technically you have created a PLIST file in plain text notation (as Xcode offers it) with the file extension .webloc.\n\n\nA: This is not an entirely \"manual\" solution, it's dependent on a not-free application, Keyboard Maestro.\nIn this KBM forum thread:\nhttps://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/t/problems-creating-a-webloc-file-with-a-given-url/25787/\nuser ComplexPoint posted a macro that creates a webloc file on the Desktop (configurable) for whatever page is frontmost in Chrome at the moment it's run, using KBM's internal token %ChromeURL%. KBM also has a token, %SafariURL% for the frontmost Safari tab, which can be used instead.\n[Unaffiliated Review]At $36US, it's pricey for just this one task, but I'll argue that KBM can easily become indispensable in its ability to add features to other apps. There is a hugely helpful user forum and prompt support from the current developer. I bought it for myself for my birthday two years ago and I'm now using my custom macros many times per hour.

I'm looking to do something that I think is fairly basic, but I'm not aware of whether Airport Express hardware supports this scenario.  Basically, I just want to tunnel audio via IP packets / my home network, from a home theater, to a set of outdoor speakers.  [For the scenario, think:  being able to follow the action of a sports broadcast when I go from home-theater room, to outside my house, where my outdoor speakers are.]\nIf a pair of Airport Expresses can be configured as a 'dedicated, point-to-point audio bridge' then it seems like it'd work.  In other words - set up to just tunnel the audio input from one Express, over regular home-network IP, to the other bridge, where it re-emerges via line-out as regular audio out. Can those devices operate that way?  If not - is there an inexpensive way to enable?\nI'm not aware of any 'bridge' device pairs that tunnel audio over IP (TCP or UDP) from a 'transmitter' to a 'receiver.' (Devices like this exist for Bluetooth... but, I need to span a large distance, and figure I should be able to leverage the my wired/WiFi home network to achieve this, and not worry about audio quality; bluetooth profiles; signal strength - etc.)  \nNote, the goal would be to set this up once - and then not control them or manage them, using Airplay or anything else, thereafter.\nthoughts?\n\nA: The Airport does not have an Audio Input. It's audio-feature is essentially being an AirPlay receiver. Your plan will only work when playing your source material from a device that supports AirPlay.\n", "Q: Key to boot from USB on Ubuntu Macbook 2007 I recently installed Ubuntu 14.10 on my 2007 Macbook. I need OS X back. I burned OS X Lion (10.7) to a USB, now what?\n\nA: First step is to discover if the OS on the USB stick is properly formatted and built for a boot device.\nFor this you will need a Mac running OS X. Insert the stick and go to System Preferences → Startup Disk. If your stick is ready to boot a Mac it will appear in the selection pane :-\n\nIf it is there then your USB stick is bootable. Just insert it into your MacBook and hold down the Option key when it starts up and it will let you choose the boot device. Use the arrow keys to select your stick and then hit return.\nIf it doesn't show up the most likely reason is a badly formatted stick. Your stick must use a GUID partition table and the boot partition must be formatted Mac OS X Extended (Journalled).\n", "Q: Corrupt Photos Libray when migrating to new Photos.app I've downloaded the new Photos.app and migrated my iPhoto Library and now all my full screen images are replaced by a grey exclamation mark.\nThis is being logged in the console :\n14/04/2015 22:48:04,002 Photos[1373]: Unsupported item: IMG_0694.JPG of type 0`\n14/04/2015 22:48:04,029 Photos[1373]: Unknown version type: RDVersion(0x600003530860) modelId=23946 uuid=134LStKnROWcZ51vzo+yGg\ntableName=RKVersion state=persisted,readonly,local, IMG_0694.JPG 0\n\nDoes someone as any idea how to fix this ?\nIf I explore the package of my Library the Masters folder contains all my files.\n\nA: Since Photos is so new, it may be tricky to find solutions to issues.  However, applying iPhoto type fixes may help.  \nBefore beginning and repair, make sure you have a backup of your entire Photos/iPhoto library.  \n\n\n*\n\n*You can try closing Photos, then open Photos while pressing Command and Option.  This brings up a window for repairing issues.  Select the Repair option to start rebuilding the library.  These instructions can also be found HERE on Apple's website.\n\n*Unfortunately, the wonderful app, iPhoto Library Manager doesn't support Photos.app, but they are creating a new app that does, call PowerPhotos!

Until then, we must rely on Apples built in repair functions.  \n", "Q: Calendar won't let me add new events on my iPhone Suddenly my iPhone won't let me add new events to my calendar. In the upper right hand corner of the 'month' calendar there are 3 symbols.\n\n\n*\n\n*A rectangular box with 2 lines underneath. \n\n*A magnify glass. \n\n*A '+'\nThe first two are red and active\nThe third one is gray and inactive. \n\n\nI've read solutions to problems from others, but nothing has helped. \nI also have and iPad, and the calendar on it works fine. I have compared settings on both products, and they seem to be set the same way.\n\nA: I had the same problem, went into the calendar, tapped on \"Calendars\" in the bottom center, here there were two calendars listed - holidays, and birthdays.  I pulled down on these items (like scrolling, the screen refreshed then showed 5 calendars.  From some reason I-cloud was not selected, I selected this and all the calendars listed became active.\nI went back to the calendar view (by month) and am now able to add events.\nBTW, none of the other options I have tried worked, only this method.  Under general settings both my iCloud and Yahoo calendars were active, but under the actual program they were not.  Don't waste your time in the general settings change it from the program.  \n\nA: On my 5s when the above answer didn't help solve that when I created a new event on my calendar and pressed Add, it didn't register.  I discovered it was actually created but was invisible.  To rectify this problem, I went to the Calendars button on the tab bar (when calendar is open). At the top is a button titled either, \"Hide all calendars\" or \"Show all calendars\". Since you want all of your calendars to show, toggle it so that what you see is \"Hide all calendars\".  This will then show all of your calendars and the events you've created.\n\nA: Go into settings, scroll down to iCloud, make sure iCloud is \"On\" (or \"green\") for Calendars. As soon as I turned this on, I was able to create events again. The \"+\" sign was no longer gray, and it was red and active again.\n\nA: I had the same problem on my Iphone 5c.  I went to the plus sign like I was going to add a new event.  The scrolled down to where it says 'calendar.\"  Nextto it was the word home.  I cicked the arrow and it gave me the option to choose \"calendar.\"  I did and it is now adding the events to my calendar, but I have to choose it every time.  I need to figure out how to make it permanent so every event is added without me having to change that setting each time.\nHope this helps you!\n\nA: Went to calendar like that person said earlier, at the bottom of the page between \"today\" and \"inbox\" - check all iCloud and it fixes the problem.\n\nA: Below steps solved my problem. \n\n\n*\n\n*go to calendar app.\n\n*At bottom click \"Calendar\"\n\n*At top \"Make it Show all Calendars\"\n\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 8,1 hanging on startup I have a macbook pro 8,1 that is having issues starting up.

This is a problem new to Yosemite. I have a folder called \"com.acme.epub\". The Finder sees this as an ePub file and won't let me access it as a folder. I can access it as a directory via the Terminal but if I do \"open .\", then it launches iBooks (which is not my default epub application). How do I get the Finder to see this folder as an actual folder/directory and not as an epub file? Note: Renaming the folder is not an option.\nThis same behavior occurs with folders that end with a \".key\" string; it probably happens with certain other strings as well.\nI am using OS X 10.10.3.

After trying to get rid of them I'm now stuck with a large amount of empty space in my FusionDrive and DiskUtility won't let me fill it or resize anything regarding the empty space (I've tried this in recovery mode too).\nHere is what my DiskUtility looks like (ignore the 16GB USB): \nThe two drives my FusionDrive is compromised of are disk0 (1TB HDD) and disk1 (100GB SSD) from here:\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *120.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         119.7 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk0s3\n/dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk1\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         626.1 GB   disk1s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.1 MB   disk1s3\n   4:                        EFI NO NAME                 104.9 MB   disk1s4\n/dev/disk2\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           *739.9 GB   disk2\n/dev/disk3\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *15.9 GB    disk3\n   1:                 DOS_FAT_32 WININSTALL              15.9 GB    disk3s1\n\nYou can see that my FusionDrive is disk2, and shows up with around 740GB.\nHere is my CoreStorage list (I believe this is helpful): \nCoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found)\n|\n+-- Logical Volume Group 57932797-4AC8-4475-9836-82394CEBF536\n    =========================================================\n    Name:         LogicalVolumeGroup\n    Status:       Online\n    Size:         745750200320 B (745.8 GB)\n    Free Space:   353689600 B (353.7 MB)\n    |\n    +-< Physical Volume 68F90B2B-4004-4044-AFFB-9D3854006D2A\n    |   ----------------------------------------------------\n    |   Index:    0\n    |   Disk:     disk0s2\n    |   Status:   Online\n    |   Size:     119690149888 B (119.7 GB)\n    |\n    +-< Physical Volume 9CB6C261-6817-42F0-B2EB-09F057462EBD\n    |   ----------------------------------------------------\n    |   Index:    1\n    |   Disk:     disk1s2\n    |   Status:   Online\n    |   Size:     626060050432 B (626.1 GB)\n    |\n    +-> Logical Volume Family 9B947A52-7496-46CA-BFA5-A87DD47249FE\n        ----------------------------------------------------------\n        Encryption Status:       Unlocked\n        Encryption Type:         None\n        Conversion Status:       NoConversion\n        Conversion Direction:    -none-\n        Has Encrypted Extents:   No\n        Fully Secure:            No\n        Passphrase Required:     No\n        |\n        +-> Logical Volume 86417B41-6400-4F81-8F7C-43AA243CDAEE\n            ---------------------------------------------------\n            Disk:                  disk2\n            Status:                Online\n            Size (Total):          739901915136 B (739.9 GB)\n            Conversion Progress:   -none-\n            Revertible:            No\n            LV Name:               Macintosh HD\n            Volume Name:           Macintosh HD\n            Content Hint:          Apple_HFS\n\nHow can I regain my FusionDrive's empty space?\n\nA: Basically the same applies as in this question and the accepted answer.\nThe only difference is that you have a fusion drive and therefore some DiskIdentifiers differ.\nAdditionally you have a blocking partition on your HDD with certainty which has to be removed.\nThere is one undocumented command to resize or expand a CoreStorage volume group and an inherent logical volume:\ndiskutil cs resizeStack LVUUID size  \n\nThe command expands or shrinks the whole CoreStorage Volume Group including the physical volume(s), the logical volume family and the logical volume in one step to the desired size.\nBeware: The command is vastly undocumented and as such potentially destructive.\nPreparation: \n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your data.\n\n*Detach any external drive (especially your external Time Machine backup drive).\n\n*Restart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing alt cmd R at startup.\nThe prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.\nOn a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot to a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an apple/akamai server.\nI recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.\nAlternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (Mavericks or Yosemite) or a thumb drive containing a full system (Mavericks or Yosemite). The disk identifiers may differ then.

None in the weeks since I again uninstalled Java.\nUninstall Java: https://www.java.com/en/download/help/mac_uninstall_java.xml\nUninstall JDK:\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/mac_jdk.html\nI have reported the problem to Apple. Radar bug report #26992850.\n", "Q: Importing an iPhoto library in Photos I had an iPhoto library in a non-standard folder and it was not recognised by Photos (which is OK).\nI would now like to import all the photos and then delete the old library. How?\nIf I open Photos with option I can choose the iPhoto library. Will this copy all the pictures?\n\nA: If you have an existing Photos library and you want to import an iPhoto library use File -> Import (shortcut: cmd+shift+i) and select your iPhoto library.\nIf you want a Photos library with just your old iPhoto library, hold alt (option) while starting Photos and select your iPhoto library.\n\nA: If the Photos app complains that there isn't enough disk space on your startup disk to convert your iPhotos Library to a Photos Library, you may find this answer useful.\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit iPhoto.\n\n*Quit Photos.\n\n*Back up.\n\n*Make a Work folder on an external disk that has lots of space.\n\n*Drag-copy iPhoto Library from your Pictures folder to the Work folder.\n\n*Open the Work folder copy of the iPhoto Library in the Photos app by dragging it to the Photos app.\n\n\nThe Photos app makes a new \"Photos Library\" in the Work folder. Only the Photos app will be able to open this new Photos Library, and only the iPhoto app will be able to open the iPhoto Library in the Work folder (because the Photos app changes its filename extension when it's done converting).\n\n\n*Drag the iPhoto Library from your Pictures folder to the trash.\n\n*Drag only the new Photos Library from the Work folder to your Pictures folder.\n\n*Delete the Work folder from the external disk when you're sure everything went according to plan.\n\n\nIf you're going to do anything different from steps 8 and 9, here's something you need to know. The photo files in new Photos library are not copies of the photo files from (the Work folder copy of) the iPhotos Library. They are \"hard links\" to them. This means that for example the IMG_1234.JPG in the Photos Library and the corresponding IMG_1234.JPG file in the iPhoto Library are just two different references to the same blob of image data on the disk. This fact has two important ramifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*Whenever you're ready to delete the iPhotos Library folder,\n\n\n*\n\n*Doing so will have no effect on your new Photos Library.\n\n*You won't get much freed disk space (because the photo files remaining in your new Photos Library will still be holding onto the disk space they shared with the photo files you're deleting as part of the iPhoto Library).\n\n\n*If you want to still be able to open your old iPhotos Library in the iPhotos app, you have two choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't delete the iPhotos Library from the Work folder. You can still open it in iPhoto by drag-opening it, and from then on the iPhoto app will remember that this is the iPhoto Library it should open. In other words change Step 9 to delete only the Photos Library. from the Work folder.\n\n*From the Work folder, drag both the new Photos Library and the iPhotos Library to your Pictures folder, together, in the same drag. Dragging them both in the same drag will preserve the hard links between the image files in the two libraries (and thus save a lot of disk space). In other words, change step 8 so you copy both libraries at once; otherwise, you will not have the option to achieve the same effect later.*\n\n\n\n* As of probably 10.13, you will be able to migrate your startup disk to the new APFS disk layout. With APFS in place, you will be able to copy the iPhoto Library to your Pictures folder later without wasting disk space. This is because APFS will automatically figure out which image files are the same between the two libraries and will quietly share disk space between them similar to the way hard links do.\n", "Q: Bulk merge items sub-folders into new folder I have a main folder with about 80 folders in, each with about 10 items in. I want to be able to use a Terminal command or something to just move every item from each sub-folder into a new one (i.e the newly created folder would have around 800 items in, not separated by individual folders). Doing this by hand would be very tedious. Is there a way to do it easily and quickly? I have looked at ditto, but couldn't figure out how to use it for my use case. Any help would be much appreciated, thank you!\n\nA: Assuming the structure is like\nmain-folder\n    subfolder-1\n        item-1\n        item-2\n    subfolder-2\n        item-3\n        item-4\n\nand all the items are uniquely named, you can use\ncd main-folder\nmkdir ../target-folder\nmv */* ../target-folder/\n\nto move everything into a target folder on the same directory level as the main folder.

The bird daemon will re-download the folder from the cloud if you try. The developer that created those folders will have to implement a clean up routine (similar to how 1Password allows you to instruct the app to delete iCloud data and the program itself removes the data).\nIf you created the folder or document from OS X, then you can drag that folder to your desktop (or elsewhere) and you'll be notified of the pending \ndeletion from iCloud.\n\nPay attention to the kind column to determine if you need the App to delete things or if you are trying to delete a normal file or folder. For more information you can use the command brctl log --wait to see status, minor errors and warnings of the iCloud folder and file syncing from OS X using terminal.app.\n\nA: I followed those steps to get rid of the hidden folder (be sure to have a backup!):\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall the app on all devices\n\n*Delete the folder in the iCloud web interface \n\n*Delete every folder related to the application from ~/Library/Application Support/CloudDocs/session/containers\n\n*Delete every folder related to the application from\n~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/ as described in this Ask Different\nanswer\n\n*Reboot after a few minutes\n\n\nThis also caused iCloud to do a complete re-sync of all iCloud documents for me. But the hidden folder is gone.\n\nA: After abortive attempts to upload my iCloud Photos Library (iCPL) and then wiping it again in various ways, there were left behind \"All Events\" folders, originating from the old iPhoto Events folder.  Once the original copy on the computer was lost, it was not possible to remove the iCloud.com version.  They were \"orphaned\".  My question to Ask Different was about how to remove the orphaned folders. I got no answers or suggestions...\nI made many attempts to delete the library from iCloud and start afresh. Apple assisted in this, but thought that I must have something wrong with my library.  I had had to use iPhoto Library Manager to rebuild it, before I could get it to upload at all, because it contained a folder with 1.6Gb of iPod thumbs.\nI  had uploaded the library maybe twenty times and had exceeded my ISP quota for the month, which cost a lot of money.\nThen Apple deleted the library using the Preferences iCloud option, which I had done myself several times already. But since, this time, the Undo Delete also stopped working, I had to wait nearly thirty days, before they finally reset iCloud.com>Photos back to the splash screen.\nAfter installing a diagnostic profiler for Photos, I created a new empty library and re-enabled iCPL. Immediately the rogue All Events folder, containing 1266 images, reappeared in iCloud.com>Photos.  Maybe this convinced Apple that it was not being inadvertently uploaded from my computer.\nSo, after three months of investigation and liaison with Engineering in Cupertino, Dallas and Dublin, and uploading numerous diagnostic reports, I now note that on the 12th May 2015, this problem has finally been solved by Apple themselves.  Various posts on the Apple Support Forum (ASC) confirm this. e.g.: Apple Support Community\nOn logging into iCloud.com in Safari, the iCloud Photos Library (iCPL) was reloaded from a new splash screen, in my iCloud.com>Photos and is now being kept in sync with the library on my computer and iPhone.\niCloud.com>Photos\nicloud.com>photos Before\n\nMultiple Legacy All Events folders\n\nUnresponsive Recently Deleted folder\n\nUnable to Undo Delete\n\nComplete set of obsolete images in one All Events folder\n\nFinal corrected version\n\nReaddle...\nThere was also an orphan Readdle Documents folder in iCloud.com>iCloud Drive, after uninstalling the app.  \nThis Readdle Documents folder has been removed from Cloud.com.icloud>iCloud  Drive, but remains as a hidden file in iCloud drive on my computer.\nI now have an email from the developers at Readdle, saying that:\n\"It is technically impossible from our side to delete the folder. Only Apple manages this process. I recommend you to try signing out from your iCloud account on your Mac and re-add it. It may solve the issue.\"\nI am reluctant to take any action at present.\nEdit:  I finally got round to logging out of iCloud and back in again.  It has removed the Readdle Documents folder from iCloud Drive on the computer.\nPS.  The hidden folder appeared right back on to the computer, after a day or so...\nLegacy Readdle Documents Folder\n\nReaddle folder removed from iCloud.com>iCloud Drive\n\nReaddle folder still on computer, but hidden\n\n", "Q: Is there are tool that can store and retrieve monitor arrangements as presets?

How will i get the email address used for the icloud account? Can anyone help us out? \n\nA: Take it back to the dealer. See if they have the contact details. If not, get your money back, they should have checked before even buying it from the previous owner.\nThe entire email address is never exposed, so you won't be able to access it. \nEven if not stolen, if the original owner doesn't remove it from their iCloud account, there's no way to bypass the Activation Lock.\n", "Q: MBP Freeze + Graphics Card Problems I have an unusual but annoying problem with my MBP. The problem occurs often when running my laptop with an external monitor connected, and watching YouTube in Chrome. The problem is that the video will (seemingly randomly) freeze, audio will continue playing, and the computer becomes completely unresponsive aside from the mouse still moving. If I then shut the lid of my laptop, eventually the computer will sleep, but the screen remains black (no backlight) when attempting to wake it up again, although you do hear the CPU fan and HDD spin up like normal.\nI have located the exact location in the log files that the crash occurs. The relevant portion is here.\nI believe that the point at which the crash actually occurred is here:\n15/04/2015 10:44:05.000 kernel[0] NVDA(OpenGL): Channel exception! exception type = 0xd = Graphics Engine Error (GR Error 5)\n15/04/2015 10:44:05.000 kernel[0] IOVendorGLContext::ReportGPURestart\n15/04/2015 10:44:25.000 kernel[0] NVDA(OpenGL): Channel timeout!\n15/04/2015 10:44:45.000 kernel[0] NVDA(OpenGL): Channel timeout!\n\nMy question is this; is it:\n\n\n*\n\n*A hardware problem (with the graphics card)?\n\n*A software problem (with the OS)?\n\n*A software problem (with Chrome)?\n\n\nSince the crashes are sporadic, this is unfortunately not easy to reproduce at will, although they happen often enough to be a serious problem.\nMy MBP is a mid-2010 15-inch running OS X 10.10.3. The graphics card is a NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M 256 MB and I'm using Chrome 41.0.2272.118.\nAny help or advice on this problem whatsoever would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I ran into a similar issue a while back.  You will need to diagnose the video card with a diagnostic utility\n1)  Download, burn, and boot Ultimate Boot CD.  There are a number of video utilities you can run that will test out your video card for you.  Since you are no longer booting OS X when you boot this CD, you are bypassing any software issues you may be experiencing from Apple and OS X.  \nThere is a USB Flash Boot Drive option instead of a CD (I personally use this). \nThis will tell you if your video chip is good or bad.  If it fails at any point, then it is a safe bet that you have a hardware issue.  If everything passes, it's on to step 2.\n2) Install a pervious version of OS X; Mavericks or Mountain Lion will do.  The best way is to boot from a USB drive (don't overwrite the HDD in your MBP).  A small USB drive is fine 10/20 GB is more than enough.  This is just to install OS X 10.9.x or 10.8.x so you can do some diagnostics.\nDo a Time Machine Backup First!  Just in case you accidentally select the internal drive when doing this procedure.\nDo a fresh install of ML or Mavericks on the USB HDD.  Let it wipe and partition the drive.  \n3)  Boot from the USB HDD (hold down the option key before the boot chime to select boot device).  Install Chrome and watch videos as you normally would.  If everything works properly, you have narrowed down the problem to Yosemite.    Which means you will probably have to wait for a fix from the folks at Apple.\nAt that point, you have really only two options:  downgrade to Mountain Lion or Mavericks or wait for an update to Yosemite.\n", "Q: ios: workflow app, is there a way to open several new tabs?

So, my dog bit through my MacBook Air charger and i just ordered one online without really knowing what all the specs meant.\nNow my question, does it hurt my battery to use a charger with a higher charging capacity?\n\nA: Your battery will only take as much as it needs. Thus a larger charger will not harm it.\n\nA: In a well-designed device, it should never matter. In constant-current mode, the voltage is varied to keep the amperage going into the cell. If you are charging a 11.1 (3S) battery at 2A, for example, the charging circuitry will not send 11.1v to the battery. Instead, it'll start low, like 10v and slowly adjust until the current desired is met. The difference between the two chargers is the maximum continuous current they can sink before they burn out. In the constant-voltage stage, it really doesn't matter! The voltage is set to a threshold to help the battery complete it's charge cycle. The current is set to freely go up and down as it pleases. However, the more powerful charger still doesn't matter! The current going into the battery will rarely ever reach the current that the lower-end charger will produce.\n", "Q: Mavericks won't install on brand new SSD drive Mid 2010 MacBook Pro 6,2\nHad 10.9.1 installed on an SSD drive which failed.\nGot a replacement drive (same brand, model)\nHave a USB bootable thumb drive with 10.9.0 installation files on it\nMac boots from USB and install starts\nIt sees the new drive (formatted Mac OS Extended Journaled)\nI set the date via Terminal so that isn't the issue\nGoes through the preparing to install routine, and then eventually fails with the following error:  \n\nAn error occurred while preparing the installation.

It is unlikely that you obtained the incorrect battery, since AASP's source their parts from Apple to perform warranty-service repairs. I poked around online and noted that you are not the only one who has the bq20z45 part number from SMP, nor the only one to have a Full Charge Capacity different than ~8000. I found this via various user screenshots on Amazon. \nLikely, the battery is correct for your unit and will function as expected. If not, all warranty repair services are either covered by your Applecare Protection Plan or, if out of warranty, 90 days from date of service. Should you continue to have concerns, I'd call the AASP back to verify that you got the right item.\nEDIT: It may be worth it for you to calibrate your battery. Charge all the way to 100%, then unplug the unit and use it until it dies w/o charging it up again. Repeat once and that should get your battery reporting accurately as well.\n", "Q: How can I prevent my machine from automatically downloading deleted system files?

This worked and everything is fine now but as long as the machine is connected to the internet, it will keep downloading the drivers after I delete them and the machine becomes unusable again once the keyboard is enabled. How can I prevent it from doing that (without disconnecting it from the internet...)?\n\nA: I stumbled across this yesterday while performing maintenance on my server unit. Give it a shot and let me know the outcome (AFAIK this is only viable on Yosemite).\n\n\n*\n\n*Open 'System Preferences'\n\n*Select the 'App Store' pane\n\n*Deselect the checkbox marked 'Install system data files and security updates'\n\n\nHopefully, OS X should stop repairing your Extensions folder each time you connect to the internet.\nFailing that, perhaps changing permissions for the kext (rather than outright deleting it) will just cause it to fail to load but still be present and therefore not re downloaded.\n", "Q: How to paste from clipboard into a Preview edited PDF file It seems the clipboard does not work - either direction. I can not copy and paste into or from a Preview edited PDF doc.\nWhy is Preview so unfriendly/ difficult to use with external tools?  Any workarounds on this?  \n\nA: Can you confirm that the text you are viewing is actual text, rather than an image? For example, I opened a PDF in Preview, drag-selected text, right-clicked to choose Copy. I was then able to paste that text into a text editor.\nNow, with respect to editing, click the Show Markup Toolbar at the top-right. From here, you can create a Text object, paste your clipboard text, and then adjust the text size and color.\nWith respect to limited editing, keep in mind that a PDF is generally a compiled format (i.e., the layout for that PDF was created in another application). This is easy to forget when PDF viewers like Acrobat and Preview provide seemingly easy tools for editing and applying annotations. (I suppose that you could also try editing with Illustrator, though that could potentially get quite messy, depending upon the source of the PDF).\nAs a rule, it's better to edit a given document in its original application, and then recompile into PDF. However, if you have frequent need to perform touchups to PDF, then the Adobe Acrobat application is recommended.\n", "Q: Iphone 5 error, what can i do? Last night my phone just turned off even though it had 53% charge. it would only turn back on if I plugged the charger in, and after being on for 40 seconds or so the phone turns off again, the screen turns green and slowly fades away. It has been absolutely fine before this and the phone will not turn back on.

Reading from your MacBook model (MacBookPro10,1) it seems you either have a mid 2012 or early 2013 Retina MacBook Pro.\nGPU Panic obviously indicates that the system panics because of the GPU.\nDeducting from this, it is possible that your computer is eligible for the GPU replacement program that Apple recently initiated.\nVerify your model here and see if you are eligible. The problem is most likely this then, I had the same issue with my Early 2011 MacBook Pro and a friend in college got the same problem with his Retina MacBook Pro Mid-2012\n", "Q: Wi-Fi on hardwired iMac? I have a small network consisting of a couple of iMacs hardwired to an AirPort router via CAT 5e cable, and a couple of iPhones. Since the iMacs are hardwired, I'd normally leave Wi-Fi turned off on those machines. However, I have found Wi-Fi to be useful for AirDrop between the iPhones and the iMacs, and for AirDrop between the two iMacs.\nHere are my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any way to leave Wi-Fi on for the iMacs, but prevent them from using it to connect to the router? The AirPort is running WPA2, so I know I could simply omit the WPA2 password from the iMacs. Is there a better way?\n\n*Does it do any good, or any harm, to let the iMacs establish a wireless connection to the router, in addition to their wired connection? It occurred to me that the additional connection might boost throughput, if the router knows how to use it. Is that the case? \n\n\nThanks for your help.\n\nA: Without special software or hardware to do so, multiple connections are not combined for increased throughput, knowing as bonding. The connections are utilized in the order shown in System Preferences > Network (screenshot below). You can change the order by clicking the gear icon > Set Service Order.\nThere is no harm in letting the computer connect to the router, other than possibly a slight impact on load in the router - but assuming the connection is not being actively utilized, impact should be slight to none. The only way I am aware of to prevent the Mac from connecting to the router is to not tell it the password or turn Wi-Fi off.\n\n", "Q: Finder. No folder icon after upgrade to 10.10.3 After upgrade there is no folder icon in Finder:\n\nDoes somebody have problem like this? Could you maybe help me with some advice?\nPS. Everything is ok with list view option in Finder.\n\nA: Try killall -KILL Finder in Terminal. Usually clears up graphical glitches.\nTry resetting Finder preferences. Run these commands in Terminal:\nrm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist\nkillall -KILL Finder\n\nNote that you will have to redo any Finder preferences you had set.\nIf that doesn't work, follow these steps to reset the Icon Services cache:\nsudo find /private/var/folders/ \\\n-name com.apple.dock.iconcache -exec rm {} \\;\n\nsudo find /private/var/folders/ \\\n-name com.apple.iconservices -exec rm -rf {} \\;\n\nsudo rm -rf /Library/Caches/com.apple.iconservices.store\n\nkillall -KILL Dock\nkillall -KILL Finder\n\nAfter the first command, it will prompt you for a password.

How can I log it out without having the phone? I have changed the password and told the person who bought it to see if they can log it out, but it isn't working. \n\nA: You can remotely remove the phone from your account using the iCloud website. Apple has a page with instructions on how to remove your device from Find My iPhone.\n\nA: Log into the Find My iPhone part of the iCloud website.\nSelect your device from the drop-down list at the top of the screen.\nClick on \"Remove from Account\".\nThis should remove your account from the device and enable the new owner to use it.\n\n", "Q: How do I force iOS Reminders to sync? Reminders on iOS is often out of sync with Reminders on my other devices and iCloud. How do I force it to sync?\n\nA: Opening up the calendar and allowing it (or forcing) to sync will do the trick, though oftentimes imperfectly.\nTo force calendar to sync, open it up and the tap \"Calendars\" at the bottom, then swipe down.\nAs far as \"imperfectly\" goes, I mean it doesn't seem to sync all tasks all the time. I haven't figured out what the pattern is there, but it seems that it's usually recurring tasks that have issues.\n\nA: Unfortunately, from what I can find, there isn’t any way to manually sync reminders between devices; it just happens. There are some things that you can do, however (assuming you are on iOS 8.3 and OS X Yosemite 10.10.3):\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that both your iOS devices and your Mac are synced with the\nsame iCloud account. On your iOS account, go to Settings > iCloud and\nmake sure that Reminders is on. Then go to your Mac and go to System\nPreferences, then click on iCloud and make sure that Reminders is on.\n\n*If Reminders is on, turn them off on both devices. I personally like\nto wait about 5 minutes before turning them back on. Things should reset and start working again.\nThese are the only solutions that I have right now. If I think of more, I'll edit this answer and add them.\n\nA: I found that adding a dummy item in a list on my iPhone initiates a sync, i.e. it fetches changes from other devices. Similarly, adding items in my iPhone updates my iMac and iPad instantly. The issue seem to be the iPhone not initiating sync without local changes on the iPhone. Note that on your iPhone, sync will not happen until after you press Done (or possibly pressing return is enough) or select another list.\n\nA: Rebooting the MacOS device is the only thing that works with any reliability.\n\nA: After a reset, creating one test entry in each of the reminders in iOS forced the sync/download in my case.\n\nA: With iOS 14.6, check under Settings > Reminders > Accounts > Fetch New Data. In my case the device had somehow disabled these settings — maybe a bug in a recent iOS update? Anyway I turned on iCloud push and my reminders updated.\n\nA: Reminders have to be synced manually. Go into settings, find reminders and press synch all reminders. Then reminders will synch.\n\nA: Just swipe down! On your iphone, it will update everywhere else. \n\nA: you can refresh the reminders on iPhone by going into calendar and tapping on calendars and pulling down to refresh. I know it does not seem intuitive for reminders at all, but it works\n\nA: Invite a person to a shared list or create a shared list and it will update all reminders. This works 100% of the time for me and my family. \n", "Q: How to remove birthdays from iCal? Does anyone know how to do this? I already unchecked birthdays in the iCal > preferences \n\n\nI am the Admin\n\n\nA: I had to unsubscribe from birthdays in Google calendar in order to remove it from iCal.\n\n\nA: It's Google Calendar! Just uncheck birthday updates. And make sure you apply this to ALL of your Google accounts, school, default accounts, etc... \n\nA: You have to delete the birthday in Address Book.  Any birthdays in Address Book automatically show up in Calendar.  If you click on the birthday and press the delete key it should pop up a box telling you this.\n", "Q: Getting coordinates for frequent locations? In iOS, if “system services” are active in privacy, my “frequent locations” are recorded, but I can only see, for each of them, a fragment of a map and a quite generic description: the name of a road, for instance, which is less than useful for a long, out-of-town road without specific nearby points of reference. Is there a way to get more useful data, such as latitude and longitude?\n\nA: There is nothing directly on the iOS device to provide the coordinates. Through the iOS developer sdk you can access the CLVisit class which has the following properties:\ncoordinate- which will give you the geographic coordinates\nhorizontalAccuracy- gives the horizontal accuracy of the above coordinates\narrivalDate- date arrived to location\ndepartureDate- date departed location\nThere is also a CLFloor class which has the following property\nlevel- which will give you a value for the floor. 0 bring ground floor, 2 being 2 floors above the ground floor, etc.\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly, you're looking for something to provide maps, frequently visited places, and perhaps navigation. Have you looked at Waze?\nIt holds favorite and frequent locations, and quite a bit more.\nIt seems to be the app of choice for navigation these days. (My kids told me that). \nIt boasts a community of users who let each other know when there is traffic, problems and faster routes.\nFrom their site: \"In preparation for major events, or when unforeseen disasters happen, the Waze community updates the map with road closures and other obstructions, so everyone can bypass traffic and save time.\".\nFor planning without the \"social aspect\", Apple Maps is much better these days, and Google Maps of course, is great.\nHere is a shot of some of their settings, to give you an idea:\n\nOh, it's free, but has adverts you can pay to remove.\n", "Q: MacBook Air doesn't connect to known WiFi network automatically I have two WiFi networks: one at home and one in my office. Both are basically quite similar – same connection provider, same connection speed, same modem, same router – the only difference is that at home we use an AirPort Extreme station to broadcast the WiFi signal. \nMy MacBook Air (1.85 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, OS X 10.7.5) does automatically recognize and log in to the AirPort Extreme powered home hotspot – but it won't auto-login to the office hotspot even though it does remember the network and lists it in the Network Preference.\nIs there a way to 'teach' my MacBook Air to auto-login to 'whatever' WiFi network I want? Or does that only work with Airport Extreme powered hotspots? Or does it have anything to do with the Airport Extreme anyways? Thank you for any suggestions / pointers…!\n\nA: You can rule out your laptop for being the problem by resetting wifi configurations. Do Step 1, it's relatively safe.\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2014/10/25/fix-wi-fi-problems-os-x-yosemite/\n\nA: Found the actual problem and the solution for it: the network preferences still remembered the office network as a WEP connection. This has however changed some time ago since I switched to more secure WPA2 encoding. \nI made the prefs forget the network and re-added it – now the security prefs correspond to the actual setting and the computer does automatically connect to the network.

Under 10.10.2 Mail would simply not do anything. Under 10.10.3 Mail 8.2 crashed and corrupt the mail index. Simply fixing the rules did solve my problem. \n\nA: another setting can bring relief:\nMail->Preferences->Accounts choose accounts one by one and in the \"advanced\" button uncheck \"automatically detect and maintain account settings\".

(The last update with Photos ruined it.) Yesterday, all of a sudden, everything freezes. I forced Shut Down and since then, it´s all gone.\nI've tried every single possibility that I could find in apple support discussions forums. Tried to verify, repair, erase and partitioning the HDD and I just can't. The only possible way to boot my Mac is through Internet Recovery (cmd+R, because there´s no Recovery HD left). I tried to erase the HDD through Terminal, with diskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ MacintoshHD /dev/disk1*.\n*Sometimes the HDD I want to fix is disk0, others disk1...WTF!?\nI had no success. I tried to partition it without success. When I try to re-install the OS or restore from Time Machine, the hard disk doesn't appear. It's like it isn't mounted.\nIs there a way to solve this without buying a new hard disk? I don't mind going extreme, because I have backups. Is it possible it is something related with the fact that it was encrypted?\nUPDATE: I tried every single possibility I could reach (e.g. GParted, TestDisk, tons of different command lines on Terminal, boot from USB, from CD).

I have the Yosemite.app and a boot-able USB and windows. But i don't know how to install from the .app file . please help\n\nA: Check if your Windows machine has got a DVD-ROM or not.  If the computer can run Windows, it possibly can run Ubuntu or other Linux Live CD as well.  You cannot do something in Windows does not mean you cannot do so in other operating systems.\nRead this:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/550591/create-yosemite-usb-dvd-installer-on-ubuntu\nIt gives a link to make a bootable USB out of 10.9.  That shall be the same for 10.10.  The trick is: Once you have got the .dmg file, you can make the boot disk as if the USB key is a sizable DVD-ROM.\nHowever, make sure if your USB key has got enough disk space.

If they don't you either need to install a driver or it just isn't compatible. Big brands like Kingston or Sandisk will work 99% of the time.\n\n*If you're using SD cards there really is no difference if you're using it on a DSLR or a Mac. The storage medium itself is what is taken into account when using it. You shouldn't need to install an app for hardware like SD cards.\n\n*It should connect out of the box. But this question isn't really related to Apple since it's really dependant of the smartphone your using and what software or drivers the manufacturer provides\n\n*To have cross platform read/write support on your pendrive on both OS X and Windows the drive needs to be formatted as FAT32 or NTFS/ExFat.\nExFat is only supported starting from OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and NFTS has no out of the box write compatibility on OS X.\n", "Q: Finder unable to move files.

I have bought a new macbook pro 15\" retina in March 2015, but with less than 1 month of usage, I feel that my enter key is very loose and probably (or almost) broken.\nMaybe it's not broken and the quality of Macbook Pros is getting worse and things deteriorate really faster than the older ones. \nAesthetically the keyboard looks normal, but when typing, specially the enter feels horrible...I can't stop thinking I've spent 2K euros in something that is worse than cheap competitors.\nThe product is under warranty, but I don't know for sure if the authorised firms will do something about it — they might say that this behaviour is normal or that I used it badly (which is not true). \nHas anyone had any exprience with this?\nHow can I resolve this problem?\nThank you very much.\n\nA: It seems to be the problem of keycap. The plastic part was broken.\n\nA: Apple has changed the keyboard mechanism, that is why it feels different when pressed.\n\nButterfly Mechanism\nApple introduced the new MacBook keyboard butterfly mechanism this\n  way:\nTraditional keyboards use a scissor mechanism, which tends to wobble\n  around the edges. This creates a lack of precision when you strike\n  anywhere except the center of the key. We needed to reduce key\n  wobbling for a keyboard this thin; otherwise, striking a key\n  off-center could result in the keycap hitting bottom before a\n  keystroke registers. So we designed an entirely new butterfly\n  mechanism, which is wider than the scissor mechanism and has a single\n  assembly made from a stiffer material — allowing for a more stable,\n  responsive key that takes up less vertical space. This innovative\n  design improves stability, uniformity, and control — no matter where\n  you press on the key.\n\n", "Q: How can I add extra groups to Finder's recognised kinds presently when I attempt to group files in Finder (Yosemite 10.10.3) by kind the created Documents category creates a vast number of files including CSVs DOCX etc:\n\nIs it possible to make this groupings more efficient, by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Grouping files by extension -or-\n\n*Defining what extensions are classified where, for instance in case of the Documents category I would like for it to contain only PDFs and DOC/X-XLS/X files whereas CSVs could be in a separate data category. The developer category is particularly messy as it tends to contain hundreds of files, lot of them created automatically when working with *.tex files.\n\n\nA: Short answer: I don't think you can change or add to the defined groups. As best I can tell groups are defined on the system level, based on Apple-declared uniform type identifiers (UTI). I suppose one could (conceivably) add new UTIs by creating an app that declares them and propagates them to the system, but that seems like overkill.\nHowever, there are a couple of options you might try:\n\n*\n\n*Group by Application: This will group all files together by the default application that opens them. It's more fine-grained than Kind, but depending on how your application defaults are set up it might not produce the results you want.\n\n*Group by Tags: This will involve some prep-work setting up Folder Action scripts that will tag your files according to your desired criteria, but this gives you fine-grained control over how files are grouped in Finder windows.\n\n\nA: I would recommend creating several saved searches, each for a specific file extension within a given folder, and then add each saved search to the Finder sidebar. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Finder, go to your working folder, then type something (e.g., xxx) in the Search field.\n\n*This reveals the Search row; click the '+' at the far right.\n\n*Change Kind to File extension, and type one of the extensions you need.\n\n*Remove the \"xxx\" or whatever you had originally typed.\n\n*Click the Save button.\n\n*Type a meaningful name for your search (e.g., Documents - PDF), and tick the Add To Sidebar checkbox.\n\n\nNow that you have a saved search in the Finder sidebar, you can make duplicates of it.\n\n\n*In the Finder, right-click the Documents - PDF (that you just created), and choose Show in Enclosing Folder.\n\n*Duplicate your saved search, and rename it to something like Documents - DOC (i.e., for whatever you intend it to represent).\n\n*Select the duplicate search, and choose File menu >> Add To Sidebar.\n\n*In the Finder sidebar, click the Documents - DOC shortcut you just created.\n\n*Then right-click the shortcut and choose Show Search Criteria.\n\n*At this point, change PDF to DOC. Optionally, you could click '+' and add DOCX here, as well.\n\n\nUnfortunately, you can't modify the folder location that a saved search points to; this seems like an oversight, but there you go.\n", "Q: Change background of terminal based on host Is there a way I can have my terminal dynamically change covers based on the host I am on? For example, the default background (as determined by terminal profile) is black. Maybe there is another terminal profile that is the exact same except that it has a blue background. Now, if I SSH from black_host which is the default into blue_host, my terminal profile switches (or the background changes from black to blue).\nIs this possible? I often have anywhere from 5-10 terminals open at a time on 3-4 different machines and it would be nice to just look and see from a birds eye view which terminal belongs to which host.\n\nA: I believe this is exactly what you want:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/157959/how-do-i-make-the-apple-terminal-window-auto-change-colour-scheme-when-i-ssh-to\nAll credit goes to Yurii Soldak:\nPut following script in ~/bin/ssh (ensure ~/bin/ looked before /usr/bin/ in your PATH):\n#!/bin/sh\n\nHOSTNAME=`echo $@ | sed s/.*@//`\n\nset_bg () {\n  osascript -e \"tell application \\\"Terminal\\\" to set background color of window 1 to $1\"\n}\n\non_exit () {\n  set_bg \"{0, 0, 0, 50000}\"\n}\ntrap on_exit EXIT\n\ncase $HOSTNAME in\n  production1|production2|production3) set_bg \"{45000, 0, 0, 50000}\" ;;\n  *) set_bg \"{0, 45000, 0, 50000}\" ;;\nesac\n\n/usr/bin/ssh \"$@\"\n\nThe script above extracts host name from line \"username@host\" (it assumes you login to remote hosts with \"ssh user@host\").\nThen depending on host name it either sets red background (for production servers) or green background (for all other). As a result all your ssh windows will be with colored background.\nI assume here your default background is black, so script reverts the background color back to black when you logout from remote server (see \"trap on_exit\").\nPlease, note however this script does not track chain of ssh logins from one host to another. As a result the background will be green in case you login to testing server first, then login to production from it.\nIn the same post, Chris Page writes:\nA lesser-known feature of Terminal is that you can set the name of a settings profile to a command name and it will select that profile when you create a new terminal via either Shell > New Command… or Shell > New Remote Connection….\nFor example, duplicate your default profile, name it “ssh” and set its background color to red. Then use New Command… to run ssh host.example.com.\nIt also matches on arguments, so you can have it choose different settings for different remote hosts, for example.\n\nA: Set the terminal colours on each host.\nMy situation is slightly different than yours, in that, I'm not connecting to multiple remote servers concurrently, but the principles are the same.\nIn my case I wanted a simple way to change the colours of the terminal when I was connected to a remote server so that I accidentally did not run a development or test command on a staging or production server.\nTo accomplish this, I used the setterm command in my server(s) ~./bashrc file to inverse the colours of the terminal when connecting and restore the colours when exiting.\n~/.bashrc\n# Inverts console colours so that we know that we are in a remote server. \n# This is very important to avoid running commands on the server by accident.\nsetterm --inversescreen on\n\n# This ensures we restore the console colours after exiting.\nfunction restore_screen_colours {\n  setterm --inversescreen off\n}\ntrap restore_screen_colours EXIT\n\nI then put this in all the servers' ~/.bashrc files so that I know when my terminal is on a remote server or not. Works great.\nHowever, what this doesn't do is tell you which server you are connected to, which is what you're after.\nTo accomplish that you can simply use custom setterm parameters to set unique colours for each of your 3 or 4 servers.\nFor example, one server can be a white background with red text, like so: \nsetterm --background white --foreground red\n\nHere are all the options for setterm:\nOptions:\n --term          <terminal_name>   override TERM environment variable\n --reset                           reset terminal to power-on state\n --initialize                      display init string, and use default settings\n --default                         use default terminal settings\n --store                           save current terminal settings as default\n --cursor        [on|off]          display cursor\n --repeat        [on|off]          keyboard repeat\n --appcursorkeys [on|off]          cursor key application mode\n --linewrap      [on|off]          continue on a new line when a line is full\n --inversescreen [on|off]          swap colors for the whole screen\n --foreground    default|<color>   set foreground color\n --background    default|<color>   set background color\n --ulcolor       [bright] <color>  set underlined text color\n --hbcolor       [bright] <color>  set bold text color\n                 <color>: black blue cyan green grey magenta red white yellow\n --bold          [on|off]          bold\n --half-bright   [on|off]          dim\n --blink         [on|off]          blink\n --underline     [on|off]          underline\n --reverse       [on|off]          swap foreground and background colors\n --clear         [all|rest]        clear screen and set cursor position\n --tabs          [<number>...]     set these tab stop positions, or show them\n --clrtabs       [<number>...]     clear these tab stop positions, or all\n --regtabs       [1-160]           set a regular tab stop interval\n --blank         [0-60|force|poke] set time of inactivity before screen blanks\n --dump          [<number>]        write vcsa<number> console dump to file\n --append        [<number>]        append vcsa<number> console dump to file\n --file          <filename>        name of the dump file\n --msg           [on|off]          send kernel messages to console\n --msglevel      0-8               kernel console log level\n --powersave     [on|vsync|hsync|powerdown|off]\n                                   set vesa powersaving features\n --powerdown     [0-60]            set vesa powerdown interval in minutes\n --blength       [0-2000]          duration of the bell in milliseconds\n --bfreq         <number>          bell frequency in Hertz\n --version                         show version information and exit\n --help                            display this help and exit\n\n", "Q: Does the 2015 Retina MacBook have firmware target disk mode? I've read the user manual and FAQ on ports for the new 2015 Retina MacBook and can't tell if it supports target disk mode. \nApple's article on target disk explicitly says Firewire and Thunderbolt are required for target disk mode but the excellent iMore review article says:\n\nYou can transfer data at up to 5 Gpbs over USB 3.1, USB 3, or USB 2, or over ethernet with a USB adapter. (Including target disk mode.)\n\nFor the purposes of this question - target disk mode is exposing the internal MacBook storage using firmware and not the OS X installed on the computer itself.\nWhat is needed to place this Mac in target disk mode and connect it to another computer that would presumably see it as a USB 3.1 Gen 1 hard drive?\n\nA: Yes - you need an USB C data cable to use this and the power cable Apple ships isn't a data cable for these needs, but the firmware and hardware support target move over USB.\nApple's MacBook ports article now has a section titled \"USB Target Disk Mode\":\n\nUSB Target Disk Mode\n  Your MacBook with USB-C port supports USB Target Disk Mode. Enable Target Disk Mode for use with the following USB-C cables:\n  1) USB 3.0 or USB 3.1 USB-A to USB-C Cable \n  Target Disk Mode can be used with this cable to manually transfer data from any Mac notebook with USB-A port(s) to your MacBook with USB-C port. This cable cannot be used to migrate data using the Setup Assistant or Migration Assistant application.\n  2) USB 3.0 or USB 3.1 USB-C Cable (USB-C to USB-C)\n  Target Disk Mode can be used to migrate data from any MacBook with a USB-C port to another MacBook with USB-C port using the Setup Assistant or Migration Assistant application. \n  Note: These cables are not currently available from Apple.\n  To enable Target Disk Mode, hold down the T button on your keyboard while starting your MacBook. Then connect either USB-C cable described above. Note that the USB-C Charge Cable (2m) that comes with MacBook does not support Target Disk Mode.Your MacBook supports USB Target Disk Mode when you use it with a compatible, full-featured (“super speed”) USB-C cable. Note that the USB-C Charge Cable (included with MacBook) does not support USB Target Disk Mode.\nTo enable Target Disk Mode, hold down the T button on your keyboard while starting your MacBook. Then connect the USB-C cable. Use a full-featured USB-C to USB-C cable to connect to another MacBook, or a full-featured USB-A to USB-C cable to connect to a Mac with standard USB-A ports.\n\nSince this section was still available two days ago, and the MacBook launched on April 10, 2015 — I would say the answer is almost certainly yes, but not with the cable it comes with.\n", "Q: Messages with Adium or third party client Is it possible to use Messages (Apple iMessage) with Adium or any other third party client.\n\nA: Judging by the list of supported services on\nhttps://adium.im/help/pgs/Accounts-ListOfServices.html\nit looks like the answer would be no.\n", "Q: How to install OS X again with no access to a recovery partition?

Is there anything specific I need to do so the iCloud storage can be used for the update? I'm sure I ran updates based on free iCloud storage space alone in the past and worked fine.\n\nA: iCloud storage has no correlation to a Device's available space to allow installation of an update.\nTo show how much space is free on the device:\n Settings > General > Usage > Under 'Storage' > Manage Storage\n\nFrom here you can see what is Used vs Available, and you can even see what apps are using the most.\nYou can always update via iTunes by directly connecting the iPad to a PC/Mac, this will by pass any space issues on the device usually.\n\nA: There must be sufficient room on the device for the update to download & expand.\nThat's usually about 800MB or so. \nDeleting the update directly downloaded to the device & instead running the process from iTunes can sometimes give you just enough to space to do it; otherwise you will need to delete additional apps or data - usually something like a sat nav app can be large enough & also easily reinstallable without losing data.\nDelete the update from your iPad by going to\nSettings > Usage > Manage Storage > iOS 8.3 > Delete Update\n", "Q: Importing into Photos: Unable to get metadata I'm switching to using Photos and I'm trying to import all my old photos.

I was using Disk Inventory X to visualize my hard drive storage and help me find some extra space.  \nIt appears that iPhoto Library takes 52.0 GB and Photos Library takes 49.4 GB.\nIs this a known issue that moving from iPhoto to Photos duplicated everything or is this just a sym link under the covers?\n\n\nA: Short answer, no. The measuring tool you are using doesn't take the time to deduct the space saved when files are hard linked, so it over-counts the space used.\nThe Libraries are using 'hard links' to the real location of the files, so both appear to be approximately the same size, but each actual photo is only located in one place on your hard drive, with pointers from both Libraries.\nDeleting either Library will not affect the storage space, only deleting both would actually remove the 50GB of data from your drive.\nSee: Photos saves disk space by sharing images with your iPhoto or Aperture libraries\nMore on hard links from Ars Technica:\n\nA hard link is simply a reference to some data on disk. Think of a file as a combination of a name and a pointer to some data. Deleting a file really means deleting the name portion of that duo. When there are no more names pointing to a particular piece of data disk, then that disk space can be reused.\"\n\n\nA: If you work hard to clean up your photos after switching to the photos app, or tell iCloud photos to optimize disk usage, then your disk usage will actually go up, because the iPhoto library will still point to the old files, and they will not be deleted from the drive until you delete the old iPhoto library.\nI was just working on a Macbook Air that had a nearly full drive. No matter what I did to reduce the size of the photo library, disk space just kept going down. Deleting the old iPhoto library freed up 20GB of space!\n\nA: Ok, I believe it takes up double space. I just deleted my iPhoto Library.migratedphotolibrary which was about 90gig of space. HD went from having 220gig of free space to having now 316gig. So I freed up about 90gig of space. Plus when I went to empty the trash folder it took a few minutes. \n\nA: I've spent a lot of time to solve this issue and hope this it can help even if it's not the most common cause of the issue.\nThe problem for me here is to know if Photos and iPhotos store your photos twice in two different spaces of your hard drive or only one with a symbolic link. \nI said that to me this is two different places (and it is not a good thing)\nIf you look at the sizes of a particular picture in both directories, they are not the same. Thus to me it is not the same object (a hard link would have EXACTLY the same size)\nIf you do 'ls -lha' for these 2 files (same picture):\n/Users/doubelle/Pictures/iPhoto Library.migratedphotolibrary/Data/2015/01/18/20150118-110234/2pfRkFdYTrSDeax1Tqq6DQ\n\n/Users/doubelle/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/Data/2015/01/18/20150118-110234/2pfRkFdYTrSDeax1Tqq6DQ\n\nYou obtain these different file sizes\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 doubelle staff 38199 1 jul 22:47 IMG_0762.jpg\n\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 doubelle staff 37136 1 jul 22:48 IMG_0762_migrated.jpg\n\nThat way you can know if a file is linked or duplicated.\n\nA: If you are concerned with space, ditch iPhoto, Aperture or Photos and use a simple photo viewer (such as Lyn). Apple photo apps add about 30% in thumbnails & libray files before you start editing & adding versions etc. Right click your library & look at the size of the masters (true of Aperture) & compare it to your overall library size. \n", "Q: How can I change the encoding of a subtitle file?

I have used Windows for all of my life. In Windows, shortcuts are (almost) always initiated with the Control key. Modifications to those shortcuts are then done with the ⇧ key. So, for example, you move to the next tab using ControlTab ↹ and move to the previous tab using Control⇧Tab ↹.\nI have recently moved to OS X and I'm having a hard time remembering when to use ⌥ and when to use ⇧ in combination with ⌘. I almost never get it right. It is like it is random, but I want to think there is actually a rule.\nSo, does this rule actually exist?\n\nA: Well, coming from a Windows background myself, I can state the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Cmd key is usually like Ctrl on Windows (e.g., Ctrl+c == Cmd+c).\n\n*As with Windows, the Shift key is a common modifier to the Cmd key.\n\n*I believe that Macs traditionally had an Option key, which also came to be known as the Alt key (perhaps to help those accustomed to Windows).\n\n*Aside from that, both Ctrl and Option are treated like modifiers on the Cmd key.\n\n\nBetween different Mac applications, there is sorta an effort to have some consistency in what certain key combinations do. For example, Ctrl+Cmd+f is usually a full-screen toggle.\nHowever, the consistency of such keyboard shortcuts can vary per the software publisher.\nNow, as a person that is familiar with Windows, you'll notice that Alt doesn't activate a menu mode, such as being able to drill down to a specific menu item.\nHowever,you can create a keyboard shortcut via System Preferences >> Keyboard >> Shortcuts >> App Shortcuts. Just type the shortcut name as it appears in the application's menu.\n", "Q: Restore closed tabs with no back up (iOS) I accidentally closed all my windows in safari and wondering if there is any way to reopen them?

We have two different phone numbers.\nMy husband does not have his own iTunes account and prefers not to have a separate account. The phone is unlocked\n\nA: You need to disassociate your Apple ID from iMessage on his iPhone. You can do this by following the steps outlined below. Don't worry, iMessage/FaceTime account settings are separate to iTunes account settings (so you can choose to have different Apple IDs for each)\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Settings app\n\n*Scroll down to and tap 'Messages'\n\n*Scroll down to and tap 'Send & Receive'\n\n*Tap 'Apple ID' (which should list your Apple ID)\n\n*Tap 'Sign Out'\n\n\nThis will disassociate your Apple ID from iMessage on that iPhone and still leave it intact on your new one. Your husband will still be able to send and receive iMessages using his number. You will probably want to do the same for FaceTime too otherwise he will receive FaceTime calls for you and vice versa!\n\nA: I'm not going to ask why your husband does not want a separate account but if it's just for keeping billing iTunes purchases under your then that can be done now with Apple's family settings. Making an Apple ID is free and he can use his existing email. Remember he can access a lot of your personal info even if you disable the iMessaging. I know married people should have nothing to hide but you still need some privacy (like incase you want to surprise him on his birthday). He will have access to your calendar and noted without passwords and if he knows your password then there will be access to all.\n Regardless of all that, reset your old phone to wipe all content out and then set him up with his own ID on that phone. From there you can add him to your \"Family\" on your iCloud account and you can be set as the primary and even your payment method (for iTunes and other purchases) can be used for the whole family. You can also share photo and photo albums easier. It's a great feature my wife and I use now. You can also share location for an hour or indefinitely to not have to call or text to see when he or she will get somewhere (yes that maybe more privacy boundaries one might not want to cross but amazingly enough, my wife and I have found it very useful. \n\nA: Unless you want to keep the data on the phone, just go into Settings --> General --> Erase all Content and Settings. This will reset the phone to how it was when you purchased it (it will keep the iOS version it had when you reset it, however).\n", "Q: Changing iterm2 Terminal Color Is there a way to bold the color of the current active terminal tab in iterm2?

I'm wondering if there is any meaning to the combination of button presses I make to use keyboard shortcuts. I'm hoping to speed up the learning process of learning keyboard shortcuts in this way. I figure if I have an idea why (for example) I might press fn+delete that it performs the same function on a mac keyboard that traditional keyboards do when just delete is pressed. More examples of keyboard shortcuts are ones that everyone knows like command+c or +v or +x for copy, paste and cut.\nA helpful answer, if someone who'd like to answer doesn't have an end-game answer, would include trends they've noticed with different functions of the option, command, function, and control keys. Is one button perhaps typically used for a type of shortcut?\nThere must be a way they decide to make keyboard shortcuts assigned the way they do and I'd like to gain some insight into that. Questions? Please ask, I feel this question is appropriate to post here.\n\nA: Fn is simply a modifier to allow the same key to be used for two purposes. It started on laptop keyboards, where space was at a premium, and has since migrated to Apple's regular keyboards.\nAs far as Fn-Delete: if you are referring to the Delete key in the same column as Return, Mac has used Delete as the name of that key for a while (couldn't nail down a date, but it seems like it started shifting sometime in 2010). Windows has used Backspace instead (a holdover from typewriters, where it literally moved the carriage \"back a space\", to allow for overtyping). Regardless of what it was called, it has always deleted the character or space to the immediate left of the cursor. Delete seems more accurate, since you are not actually just moving the cursor, but removing the character too.\nThe key that is generally further to the right on the keyboard, labelled Del or Delete on most Windows keyboards, deletes the character to the immediate right of the cursor. This key is also present on full-size Apple keyboards. On laptop keyboards, where space is, again, at a premium, the key does not exist, so the modified key combination of Fn-Delete was implemented to allow this functionality to still exist absent a dedicated key.\nCommand is generally used for command execution. Command-Q executes the Quit command for the foreground program, for example. The majority of keyboard shortcuts use Command as a starting point, sometimes adding Option and/or Control as modifiers.\nControl in recent times is generally only used as a modifier to allow additional keyboard shortcuts to exist. It still, however, acts as a right click when using Control-left click, from when Mac did not have mice with more than one button.\nOption is generally also used as a modifier. In some applications, it changes what menu items are present. In Chrome's File menu, it changes \"Print...\" to \"Print Using System Dialog\" and \"Close Window\" to \"Close All Windows\". This extends to its use as a way to type characters not found on the user's physical keyboard, such as ¢ (using Option-4).\nApple's Human Interface Guidelines outline their philosophy on the creation of keyboard shortcuts:\n\nAs much as possible, use the Command key as the main modifier key in a keyboard shortcut.\nAvoid creating a shortcut by adding a modifier key to an existing shortcut, unless the shortcuts are related.\nUse the Option key sparingly.\nAs much as possible, avoid using the Control key.\n\n\nA: It's not always 100% logical to me, but I'll try my best here.\nTo learn shortcuts, the easiest way is to just look them up in the menus. When you often use a function from the menu bar often, the shortcut is usually next to it.\nOk, then:\nfn (function) is meant for the function keys f1-f12 (or more on larger keyboards). It's pure meaning is to switch between the usual f-behaviour and OS X functions (media control, brightness, etc.). It's also used for controls that are potential standard-keys but don't fit on the smaller keyboards (a larger [USB] keyboard from apple for example has a delete key, to save space the smaller keyboard put's it on a fn-function).\ncmd (command) is used for – you guessed it, commands. It's pretty much what ctrl is on windows. \ncmd + alt/option is the alternative command. It's often based on the command that you'd get without pressing alt, but slightly different (Save/Save As, Close Tab/Close other Tabs, Hide/Hide others, ..)\nCtrl doesn't seem to be used all that often. In fact, so little that I can't think of any good examples.\n\nA: option/alt and option/alt plus shift are normally used by Apple only for creating \"special characters\", i.e. characters not printed on the keys.  Exactly which ones can be seen by using the Keyboard Viewer.  Command, Control, and fn are not used for that function.\n", "Q: How do you lengthen the amount of time that Time Machine keeps hourly backups? Time Machine keeps hourly backups for 24 hours by default before purging for daily backups and I'd like to extend this further (to a week of hourly backups). Is there a way to change the backup retention policy config to allow for this? There doesn't seem to be an option in the UI.\nFailing this, I'll have to install something else and I'd rather stick with Time Machine because of a fairly large initial backup (millions of files, TB's of data, already under backup with Time Machine)\n\nA: The answer is this isn't easily done. Apple doesn't expose the timing which means it's likely to change if you apply any updates to the system or the change might even break backups so they don't run.\nI've left a comment asking about the use case. I've employed scripts to get around this in several cases for customers, but I'd need to know more about your actual use case before providing an alternate solution that would work even with the default Time Machine scheduling.\n\nA: One such script / app BASED on Time Machine is  one called  rsnapshot  (which is legal on apple products afaik (license wise) and you CAN set timing and frequency rather easily..\n\nA: There is no way for the user to change the backup retention policy of Time Machine, and I'm not aware of any third-party apps exist that extend it with that kind of configurability either.\nThe third-party apps that do exist can only flip Time Machine on and off for you to achieve a less frequent backup schedule than hourly. There is one on the AppStore called TimePreserver to manually back up your backups, but it cannot be run as a scheduled service.\nYou could potentially write a maintenance script to run periodically that would open the Time Machine server and copy off the hourly backups for safe keeping elsewhere. But then to recover that information, it's unclear to me whether it would be as simple as copying the hourly backup files back to the Time Machine server and trying to access them via the Time Machine client interface. This is something that you might test before writing the script.\nYou could also try preserving the hourly backups on the server-side by doing something similar with your own Linux-based Time Machine server or Time-Machine compatible NAS. You'd just have to create your own way to keep hourly backups from being deleted (an hourly maintenance script that copies them to a separate location or manages file permissions or something).\n", "Q: Magsafe 1 Charger to Replace Magsafe 2 Charger My current Magsafe 2 charger broker, and I was wondering if my other Magsafe 1 charger can replace this Magsafe 2 charger?\n\nA: It can, but you will need a Magsafe 1 to 2 adapter.

Hope someone here could help. \nI have been trying to connect my Windows 8 desktop to a Thunderbolt Display 27\" without success. My desktop only has HDMI and VGA output. Hence, I naturally tried two options: \n1, Desktop <==(VGA)=adapter=(Thunderbolt)==> Display \nResult: Thunderbolt screen remains blank/black/not turned on when I plug it in.

It is an active technology, all before it were passive. It is a combination of video & PCIe.\nYou can connect Thunderbolt to DisplayPort, but not the other way round.\nFrom how do I connect an Apple Thunderbolt display to a PC?\n\nIf the Wikipedia article is to be believed (and I do believe it is correct based on what thunderbolt is), then your configuration will not work.\nCompatability\nApple Thunderbolt Displays, like the video input on Thunderbolt iMacs,\n  drop compatibility with all previous standards, including VGA, DVI,\n  and DisplayPort.[3] As such, they cannot be connected to computers\n  lacking a Thunderbolt port, including pre-2011 Macs and the vast\n  majority of PCs.\n\nThunderbolt is not the same as Display Port.  Therefore you can only connect thunderbolt equipped Mac's (or some PC's with thunderbolt hardware and appropriate drivers) to the Thunderbolt display.\nFrom the Apple Mini DisplayPort FAQ\n\n\n  \n*My computer has the same connector but the symbol is different, what does that mean?\n  \n  \n  Some Apple computer have a Thunderbolt port instead of a Mini\n  DisplayPort. Computers with a Thunderbolt port will have the following\n  symbol next a port although the port physically appears the same as a\n  Mini DisplayPort:\nThunderbolt ports:\nAre compatible with all of the Mini DisplayPort adapters referenced\n  below in question 5 and with Apple Mini DisplayPort equipped displays.\n  Support adapters like Apple's Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter\n  and Thunderbolt to FireWire Adapter which are not otherwise compatible\n  with Mini DisplayPorts. See Thunderbolt ports and displays: Frequently\n  asked questions (FAQ) for more information on Thunderbolt.\n\nSo with your adaptor you can drive a DisplayPort based monitor to your PC, but not a thunderbolt display as it lacks support for DisplayPort.  That's why it didn't turn on and work.\nSome Googling and I haven't yet been able to find a USB based thunderbolt adaptor, it seems there is talk of such a device using USB 3.0 to thunderbolt although at reduced speeds.  There are a few thunderbolt PCIe cards available and some PC motherboards support thunderbolt.\n\nA: A Thunderbolt (TB) display is a bit of a misnomer.  It's actually a Mini Display Port (mDP) monitor with TB connectivity.)  So, in effect, your Apple TB monitors are just really nice high res DP monitors.

Java apps behaved almost like native Mac apps. \nOn the other hand, if you install the current Java SDK from Oracle, you can execute your Java application with java -jar YourApp.app/Contents/Resources/Java/yourapp.jar, but you get a generic dock icon, your menu items live on top of the window instead of menu bar. \nAnd if you don't have Java 6 from Apple installed on the machine, which is not included in recent versions of the OS but still available for download from Apple at this location (but it's pretty out of date at this point), then you just get an error message dialogue: \"To open YourApp.app you need to install the legacy Java SE 6 runtime.\" with a link to Apple's outdated implementation, even though you already have Oracle's Java 8 installed already. \n\nOn a Mac with Java 8 from Oracle installed, but not Java 6 from Apple, is there a way to open a Java app from finder, or retain these other native platform compatibilities?

Those answers are from Java 1.7 era, maybe it's outdated?\n\nA: From replies to a question I asked on Apple's java-dev list it would appear that on a Mac with Java 8 from Oracle installed, but not Java 6 from Apple, there is no current way to open a Java application bundle that was created using Apple's own old jar bundler technology. I suspect this is because the JavaApplicationStub is written to expect some aspect of Apple's Java not present in Oracle's Java.\nFrom a user's point of view the only thing to do would seem to be to download and install Java 6 from https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572 while it is still available.\nFrom a developer's point of view the safest bet would be to embed Java within one's application bundle using a tool such as jwrapper (www.jwrapper.com).

You will loose all your data.\nIf you have a (Time Machine) backup, you may now repair the Fusion Drive, check it for errors, quit Disk Utility, open Restore From Time Machine Backup, restore your backup data and finally reboot to the restored system.\n\n*Quit Disk Utility\n\n*Open Terminal in the menubar\n\n\n*Enter diskutil list\nExample list\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS SSD                121.0 GB   disk0s2\n/dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *3.0 TB     disk1\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS HDD            3.0 TB     disk1s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk1s3\n/dev/disk2\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     Apple_partition_scheme                         *1.3 GB    disk2\n   1:        Apple_partition_map                         30.7 KB    disk2s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS OS X Base System        *1.3 GB    disk2s2\n/dev/disk3-disk13 ...belong to the OS X Base System (your recovery system you booted to previously)  \n\nDisk0 is your SSD, disk1 is your HDD and disk2 is the OS X Base System of your Recovery HD\n\n*Now convert your main volume (the HDD) to a Core Storage Volume Group:\ndiskutil cs convert disk1s2\n\nIf you get a message stating that \"the disk can't be unmounted, converted volume won't appear until it's unmounted\", exit Terminal and reboot to Recovery Mode\n\n*Open Disk Utility and check the newly build Core Storage volume.\n\n*Quit Disk Utility and open Terminal\n\n*Now you have to convert the SSD to a Physical Volume.

I am wondering if there's a fix or easier workaround for this.\n\nEdit: I'm not even sure it can connect to any shared computer at all when this happens and it seems Finderaccess is fully broken.\nUpdate: I'm going to try a few other methods to connect to the server found on http://www.macworld.com/article/2012153/eight-ways-to-connect-to-a-server.html whenever the issue reoccurs.\nUpdate: I found that the process that (I guess) arranges the connection from OS X to the server using SMB hogs up a lot of memory. The command of the process is /usr/local/sbin/smbd -D -s /usr/local/etc/smb.conf. Killing it on the server remounts the drive on OS X and makes the slowness disappear. On another note: OS X also often mounts multiple instances of the server, appended with -1, -2 etc. I'm still not sure what causes the issue, but at least I have a quicker fix than a reboot.\n\nA: I was having the exact same issue.

Below is a quick copy and paste of one trusted site I use. Most anyone can do this. Just do a search for the files you need to download that are mentioned below. It is straightforward and minimal risk (especially on older phones you are on the fence about upgrading anyways). \nStep 1. Backup your iPhone 3GS and remember that you are installing the tool at your own risk. Think twice before you continue.\nStep 2. Download Whited00r7 for Windows or Mac and your iPhone / iPod touch model. You can get the program here.\nStep 3. You will have a zipped archive with the program and all the tools necessary for the installation process. Unzip the folder.\nStep 4. Launch Redsn0w program. You need to select “Extra” option and choose “Pwned DFU” button. The software will show you the guide so, please, follow it and wait till your smartphone is set into Pwned DFU mode [you will see the black screen at this point].\nStep 5. It’s time to install Whited00r7 program with iTunes. To do this, you should press / hold SHIFT on Windows PC and point to Whited00r .ipsw file located on your computer.\nStep 6.

Specs indicate just 1. Has anyone connected more than 1 monitor successfully? How many can you connect in total?\n\nA: From Everymac…\n\nIn addition to the internal display, this model can support an external display up to 3840x2160 via Thunderbolt 2 (4K UltraHD). Third-parties have discovered that it also can support two simultaneous 27-Inch Thunderbolt displays at 2560x1140 each in lieu of a single UltraHD display.\n\nI'm tempted to think that 2560x1140 is a typo & ought to be 2560x1440\n\nA: At least 2, and likely no more.\nThe Retina 5K iMac can support an external 4K (UHD) (3840x2160 @60Hz) monitor AND a second external monitor up to at least 1920x1200 (60Hz) at the same time.\nThis is the setup I am currently using. No special tricks needed. Machine: Core i5 3.5 GHz, Radeon R9 M295X 4GB VRAM graphics card (BTO upgrade), 16 GB RAM, Yosemite 10.10.5.\nI have the internal display set to scaled (\"Looks like 2880 x 1620\") and the 4K display set to 3840x2160 in Display Preferences.  These settings likely result in a reduction in performance vs. using the \"Best for Retina\" settings.\nUser interface animations (e.g., Mission Control) can be a little slower with these external displays running, but frankly it's not that snappy even without the external displays, if I have a lot of windows open. Hopefully El Capitan should fix this.  I don't do anything graphics-intensive, so can't comment on gaming/pro apps performance.\nThings I've done to improve UI performance:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences > Accessibility > Check \"Reduce transparency\"\n\n*Deactivate the Mission Control Animation with the following\ncommand in Terminal: \ndefaults write com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration -int 0; killall Dock\n\n\n\n*\n\n*To set Mission Control animations back to defaults: \ndefaults delete com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration; killall Dock\n\n\n\n*Used an app such as QuickRes to turn off the OSX Retina/HiDPI mode on the 4K display. Since I'm running it at native resolution, Retina/HiDPI pixel-doubled drawing puts pointless effort on the GPU (i.e., it doesn't serve to make anything appear crisper on screen). \n\n\nFWIW, this document from Apple says that the Retina iMac can support two Thunderbolt displays (2560x1440).  It also says that each Thunderbolt port can only support one display of any kind, and so that would limit the iMac to two displays total. It also suggests that the Retina iMac can support a 4K display (using MST) AND a Thunderbolt display at the same time (see footnote 5 in the table describing number of supported Thunderbolt Displays). That configuration is likely the maximum number of pixels the machine can put out across two displays (or possibly 4K & 2560x1600). \nIf you want to have more than 2 monitors, you can always use USB adapters utilizing DisplayLink's chipsets. I've used these to good effect on my Retina iMac.\n\nA: I have 2 Dell 27 inch 4k monitors connected to my iMac 27 Retina with 4GB AMD, I can if it was readable run all three at max resolution and 60hz without issue.\n\nA: The Late 2015 iMac 5K with AMD 395X can support two external 4K (UHD) displays (at the full 3840x2160 res) with the builtin iMac display set to 5120x2880 FYI. This is the configuration that I am currently running (with 10.11.2), using two LG 27MU67 displays attached via DisplayPort-to-miniDP cables on each of the iMac's thunderbolt ports.\n\nA: Take a look at this Article (4 screen set-up),\nhttp://www.zdnet.com/article/making-it-work-four-displays-on-a-monster-imac/\nwhere he has three additional screen connected ....\n", "Q: Migrating from Linux (Ubuntu, CentOS) to OS X (dev environment) I'm about to migrate from Linux to OS X and I wonder if will encounter issues with development, as I probably will need lots of packages which are available in apt, yum package management systems. How can I find out whether these packages are available for OS X as well?\n\nA: There’s a third-party package manager called Homebrew, which is in fairly common use in the Mac development community. It’s very similar to apt or yum on Linux systems, and will have a lot of the same packages.\nThe easiest way to find out if a package is available is to Google for “brew <package name>” (as brew install is the installation command, not homebrew install), or to look through a list of Homebrew formulas like http://brewformulas.org.\n", "Q: No colour dots to tag folders. Macbook Pro, OSX 10.10.3 I have just recently bought a used Macbook Pro with Yosemite installed. So far everything seemed to work ok, except today I tried to tag a folder with the coloured dot and found it not possible. The dots are there, but they have no colour. This doesn't look right and I haven't seen anything like this before.\nHas anyone encountered anything like that? I would greatly appreciate your help?\nPlease check the screenshot attached below.\n \n\nA: Probably the color tags have been disabled previously or some non-color tags are enabled instead. Just open Finder -> Preferences -> Tags and enable all color tags and all non-color tags you need.\n\nA: I can tag files, but when I click on a tag in the side bar, no files are shown.\nThis worked up until recently.  I did have to remove a bunch of Safari-related files to fix a problem with bookmarks; must have broken tags somehow.\n", "Q: Apple recognized repair service asking for password? I took my MacBook Pro to an Apple recognized provider for repair, and as part of the repair setup they asked for my account password... Is that a regular routine?\n\nA: It's pretty common for a repair facility of any kind to ask for a username/password for the sake of verifying functionality. This is why it's always a good idea to have a separate administrator account setup for these kind of tasks. Usually an \"Administrator\" account with a unique password works.\nI've worked in the IT industry for almost 20 years, and I've always appreciated when a user has a separate admin account. It makes working on the machine faster as there usually isn't as much stuff loading on start up. It also keeps me from seeing any of your information, which is great for legal reasons.\n\nA: Depends on what they need to do. If it's purely hardware they can boot it from an external or use the guest account (assuming you set it up properly).\nIf it's a hardware / software combination they may need to install something in your system, and that requires an admin password.\n", "Q: Keys and mouse randomly stop working briefly Since a couple of days, I experience the weird issue that OS X 10.10.3 does not react to keyboard or mouse inputs, except multitouch gestures like 4-finger swipes. The unresponsiveness will persist for ~20 seconds (I haven't counted yet) and then all clicks and key presses I made during that time seem to be executed quickly one after the other, as if they had been buffered somewhere and the buffer had then been flushed.\nI have associated this problem with the following log message in Console\nIOHIDSystem: postEvent LLEventQueue overflow.\n\nWhich makes sense as it fits the symptoms. However, I cannot figure out, what exactly triggers this behaviour. \nI have an MBP 9,2 with 8GB RAM, a 120GB Samsung EVO SSD as the primary drive and the stock 500GB drive in the optical bay. Both have >30GB free space. Also according to Activity Monitor, the freezes do not coincide with high memory pressure.\nI have never had the problem before the recent 10.10.3 update, but I cannot tell if it really relates (since updating, I also have occasional graphics problems, so it may be the update was buggy, it's impossible to tell).\nThe question is, how can I diagnose the problem exactly or how can I fix it?\nEDIT: The preceding log messages seem unremarkable, like this\n26/04/15 21:12:34,057   lsregister[5417]    LaunchServices: Begin database seeding\n26/04/15 21:12:34,057   lsregister[5417]    LaunchServices: Completed database seeding\n26/04/15 21:12:52,000   kernel[0]   Google Chrome He (map: 0xffffff80435524b0) triggered DYLD shared region unnest for map: 0xffffff80435524b0, region 0x7fff90a00000->0x7fff90c00000.

I believe it has to do with the library file that's created on your Mac when iTunes is ran for the first time. How I usually get over it is to do \"File>Add to Library\" and then pointing it to the folder with my iTunes media in it.

Normally, after I log into my home laptop, I darken the screen for both energy efficiency and privacy and that works fine.  However, when I log into my iMac at work, I noticed the next day that the screen-darkening trick is virtually pointless as far as privacy is concerned (I share an office).  The lowest brightness setting of the screen on my iMac is nowhere near a level that would prevent others from watching me work.\nIs there a way to darken or hide the display on an iMac when logged in remotely?  I've been searching for a solution and cannot find one.\n\nA: Awhile back, I discovered an even better, simpler, more reliable, and free way to accomplish the goal of screen sharing without people being able to mess with the remote mac or observe you working.  All you have to do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a secondary user on the remote mac.\n\n*Screen share into your account (assuming it's the one that has the screen locked).\n\n*Use fast user switching to switch accounts to the secondary account\n\n*Lock the screen of the remote mac using the apple menu -> \"Lock Screen\" option\n\n*End the screen sharing session\n\n*Screen share into your account again (which no longer is showing on the screen of the remote mac).\n\n\nViola!  You can now work without anyone messing with your keyboard or watching what you're doing.  Much more reliable of a method than Shades and free too.\n\nA: Apple Remote Desktop has a Curtain setting which hides the screen locally while the remote user still has access to everything.  There is information here about making ARD work with Back To My Mac.\n\nA: I did some searching on this issue and found a viable solution.  I had to try a few different apps, because many of these apps use an overlay and don't actually turn down the backlight of the LCD display.  What this means is, when you darken the screen with an overlay, it darkens the remote screen sharing window as well.\nHowever Shades darkens the monitor and not the screen sharing window on the remote client.  It's donation-ware, so it doesn't cost anything to try out.  It installs a system preference pane and has the ability to configure some keyboard shortcuts.\nI found it to be slightly buggy.  Sometimes, the menu icon doesn't respond to clicks, but stopping and starting the shades app via the system preferences pane works around the issue.\nI tested out the apps by darkening the screen and then initiating screen sharing from the remote mac to ensure I could share the brighter version of the desktop, but have the LCD display darkened at the same time.\n\nA: A good alternative to MacOS remote desktop is Anydesk.\nIt has a nice 'privacy mode' feature, if you enable it, your host machine screens will be turned off.\n", "Q: iPhone 5 (AT&T, ios8.3) Suddenly Can't Text One Number I've been texting my wife's number from this phone for months. Suddenly today I am getting an error message telling me I need to use a ten digit number. The number the error thinks I'm trying is my wife's number but with \"11\" added to the beginning.\nSo far I can still text other people without the error.\nA similar error error has been reported before. One of the suggested fixes is deleting and recreating the contact and deleting all the texts, but I'd really like to avoid that if I can. I don't want to lose all of those texts.\nI tried removing the \"1\" from the My Phone Number setting, turning MMS off and on, turning off dial assist, turning the phone on and off, manually deleting just her number and entering manually in a text message, and none of that has worked.\n\nA: I just fixed this after 2 years.  First- delete the contact altogether.  Second - delete every single message the person has ever sent you, including any group texts they are in (if it's not obvious to you, search for their name, and when the messages come up, swipe left on them and hit delete).  Third- re-enter their contact, being sure that there is a 1(xxx)xxx-xxxx format and that the selected type of number is iPhone (even if it Is not). \nSend a test message.  If it doesn't work, do a reset and do it all again.  If you don't delete every single old message, it won't work.  It worked for me!!\nI have no idea what the original problem was because I share contacts with my husband and he could text these two contacts.  I just know this worked.

OS X Yosemite 10.2.2, 2015 Every time I insert an SD card or a drive via USB, dang Image Capture pushes its way to the front of my screen.  This is just since the Yosemite update--I can no longer find an option to only launch this with certain SD Cards, etc.  There's no eject button in the bottom left corner.  I can't find any preferences or other features that would allow me to turn autorun off.  It's not listed in my autorun programs in System Prefs.  \nHere's a screenshot of the guilty app: \n\nAppreciate any tips! \n\nA: Plug in your device to your Mac. When Image Capture is open it should display the device that's plugged in. Select the device, then you’ll see, below the sidebar, an option allowing you to choose what happens when you connect the device.\n\nClick the menu that says Image Capture; you have several options, such as Image Capture, Preview, or, perhaps, other apps. But you can also choose No Application. Select that, and you’re good to go. In Image Capture, you can adjust this setting individually for each device.\nIf you don’t see the menu below the sidebar, click the little widget at the bottom-left of the window; that will display the menu.\nNote: if you’ve turned on Photos in the Cloud in your iOS device settings, you won’t see this option, since your iOS device no longer lets you add photos to iPhoto when it’s connected.

Is it enough just to have it on the App Store page or do I need to include it in the app? Do I need to display it to the users from within the app before the register for an account? Finding it hard to find any information on this.\n\nA: Having a link to the privacy policy in the relevant field in iTunes Connect has been sufficient for me in the past. Obviously having a link in the app may allow users to find it more easily, however just the link in iTunes Connect seems sufficient based solely from personal experience.\n\nPrivacy Policy URL (optional)\nA URL that links to your company’s privacy policy.

It was working great until I upgraded to Yosemite and the newer Parallels.\n\nA: If your machine is starved for RAM then it will be swapping pages of memory out to disk.\nYou can check this whenever you find your Mac stalling and performing poorly by opening Activity Monitor and checking the Memory tab. At the bottom of the window you should see a value labelled \"Swap Used\". If you regularly find a significant value against this then your Mac could likely use more RAM. Ideally you want this to say \"0 bytes\".\nThe coloured Memory Pressure graph can also tell you how efficiently your RAM is being used (i.e. is your Mac constantly having to swap things in or out of RAM). From Activity Monitor Help:\nGreen memory pressure: Your computer is efficiently using all of your RAM.\n\nYellow memory pressure: Your computer might need more RAM eventually.\n\nRed memory pressure: Your computer needs more RAM.\n\nSpeaking from personal experience, Parallels (or any software that runs virtual machines) need a lot of RAM to perform well. Of course it depends on how much RAM you are allocating to your virtual machines.\n\nA: Speaking generally, adding more RAM gives the operating systems more resources for managing applications in an efficient manner. However, with respect to using Parallels, I'll add the following:\nI've used Parallels for a few years now, with both a mid-2012 macbook pro (8 GB RAM), and a 2014 macbook pro (16 GB RAM). As a rule of thumb, you want to share the following evenly between Windows and Mac: CPUs, Memory, and Video Memory.\nBy equal sharing of resources, neither operating system should be starved of resources, especially when you're using many applications on both systems at the same time.\n", "Q: How to make a custom keybind that runs an applescript file?

I would like to share my iTunes with my niece who lives outside the US. \nIf I give her my iTunes ID and password, will she be able to listen to the music I have in my account? And more importantly, will she be able to access anything else other than my iTunes music?\n\nA: This is a tricky question to answer as it depends on what you use that ID for. If it is just for iTunes Store purchases, then all she will be able to access is whatever you have purchased on the store. Of course, this isn't limited to Music, but also Movies, TV Shows, Books and Apps. She will also be able to authorise purchases using that ID and password and so could max out your credit card renting the Frozen movie countless times (I'm just assuming she's about 8 or so here ;)) or buying more hearts on Candy Crush.\nIf you also use it as your main Apple ID for iCloud and other Apple services, she will have access to those as well. Whether she uses it for those purposes is up to her; if she knows she is able to and is inquisitive, you might find her logging on to iCloud.com and nosing through your iCloud Mail or your Calendar.\nThe best option would be for her to have her own Apple ID and for you to add her to Family Sharing instead. That way, she has access to all of your past purchases, but will not be able to authorise any (you will be able to authorise on her behalf though). Additionally, she won't have access to your iCloud information.\nIf she already has an Apple ID, then great! If not, and she's under the age of 13, you'll need to create a managed one for her through iTunes. If she is over 13, you can simply create an Apple ID by going to the Apple ID management portal.\nHave a look here for full information on creating an Apple ID for kids.\n", "Q: How do I get Safari on OS X to stop ignoring the protocol part of a URL when the hostname starts with \"ftp\"? I'm using Safari 8.0.5 on OS X 10.10.3. We have a server that's accessible over both FTP and HTTP. This server's name begins with \"ftp.\" Whenever I try to connect to this server over HTTP, Safari dumps the connection attempt off to an FTP client, even if I use \"http://ftp.example.com\" (for the sake of an example) in the URL.

You can find Apple's Quick Look documentation here.\nLuckily though Timac (aka Alexandre Colucci) has already created one. You can find Timac's Quick Look plugin for strings files here.\nJust download the compiled plugin, copy it to your /Library/QuickLook folder and run the qlmanage -r command in the Terminal to refresh the Quick Look plugin cache and you should now be able to view previews of files with \".strings\" extensions. He even made his plugin capable enough to read .strings files that aren't plain text; some .strings files are in a binary format.\nHe also supplies the source on his blog, at the same link above, which should help point you in the right direction if you wanted to create a plugin for other similar files that you want Quick Look to recognise.\n", "Q: Installation of Office 365 on 2008 Macbook with OS -X 10.6 failed I was installing Office 365 on 2008 Macbook with OS X 10.6  and about half way through the installation a pop-up said to close Safari to continue installation.

The solution I have found is to disable 'commerce' in the activity window. 'commerce' is just that it seems - everything Apple does to 'smooth' purchases on its platforms. With commerce disabled, my iMac is running fine. Haven't restarted yet though so I imagine it will restart commerce so I'll need to disable it again. Needs an Apple fix.\nUp date: I have now restarted and - yay! - so far no return to abnormal over use. 'commerce' is running again, too, as I expected - but all is - so far - fine\n\nA: My gmail account was also the culprit.  It seems that around the Yosemite upgrade and/or adding my gmail credentials to iCloud keychain things got confused.  I use 2-factor authentication on Google and had been using an app-specific password.   \nI ran the keychain access application, searched for \"google\" and \"gmail\" and deleted all the relevant entries.  Yosemite then asked for my Google password, and I was able to authenticate with 2-factor rather than using app-specific passwords.  Still had to set an app-specific password in the Mail preferences--not sure if that's intended.

I am preparing technical presentations with a lot of graphics using PowerPoint 2011 for Mac (version 14.4.9).\nWhenever I insert an image, it is set to crop to fill by default (the most useless option in my opinion). \nHere is how the default option looks like:\n\nThen, it turns out that for every image, I have to manually set it to crop to fit and resize the container box correctly. Just to look like that:\n\nIs there a way to override this default behavior to get the inserted images as they are without any funny cropping?\nI tried to research the problem, but without any luck.\n\nA: One way to do that is to use the \"Placeholder\" in PowerPoint.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use View → Slide Master, then choose your layout.\n\n*Select \"Insert Placeholder\" and choose Picture.\n\n*Use the cursor to drag the picture to size and position it.\n\n\nYou can make multiple placeholders, but you do not have to use all of them if a slide does not require it.\nFrom now on all new slides (with the chosen layout) will have the placeholders where you can insert a picture and they all will be cropped to auto fit the placeholder, or auto fill.\n\nWhat you are trying to do is not possible. The Crop to fill will take the original and without shrinking it will use the center part and fill it in the preassigned Place Holder. The crop to fit will have to reduce the original to show it as whole in preassigned place holder.\nHere is an example (left and right are place holders) while the middle is the original. So even if using the crop to fit as default the image size will be what your place holder was. Thus using the Crop to Fill is better option while using the Crop tool to move to the part of the image you wanted to show in full size. \nThe problem with your request is that the Crop to Fit will always require adjustment depending on the original image size.\n\n\nA: Use a CONTENT placeholder (and insert using the image icon) rather than a PICTURE placeholder.  The content placeholder should automatically fit the entire image within the placeholder, whereas a picture placeholder will crop the image to whatever size and shape the placeholder has been created as.\n", "Q: How can I deactivate bad RAM regions on a Macbook Pro (Retina 13\")?

Is there any way to know if my phone's SIM port is working, even though it's locked to Sprint and I don't have access to a Sprint SIM? I tried using another one but it says \"no sim\" instead of \"no service\". Should I go on with the unlocking or there is something else causing it to say \"no sim\"?\n\nA: This is what I did to solve the problem.\nPowered the phone down.\nI removed the SIM card.\nUse a small paper clip and insert in the sim card hole and push firmly. Don't use a large paper clip. While they fit the hole, are too large to push on the mechansim that pops the card up.\nI lightly cleaned the SIM card contacts with an alcohol prep swab (the kind they use when you get a shot). Just so you know, I did try dry cleaning the card with a soft cloth at first, but it didn't work for me. Try it, if you don't have the prep swab, it might work for you.\nI then made sure the card was dry of the alcohol before I reinserted the card in the phone.\nRestarted the phone.\nThis solved my problem. The phone booted up normally.\nI hope it solves your problem too.\n", "Q: Restore an iPhone from iCloud backup of newer iOS version I have an iCloud backup from an iPhone running iOS 8.3. Now, I'd like to restore another iPhone from this backup. The problem is that the other iPhone is running iOS 8.2 (this iPhone cannot be updated to 8.3 as I need it to run this very version).\nI found some guides on the internet explaining how to do a downgrade from a beta version (I didn't find anything about downgrading from non-beta versions). But they are about downgrading from a major release to another major release (eg: iOS 8 to iOS 7). \nMy thought is that, unlike the iTunes backup, iCloud backup saves only information about the data on your iPhone (a list of all installed apps, a list of all downloaded music, movies, etc.) and when you restore from an iCloud backup, it will just re-download this media from iTunes and the App Store.\nI didn't just try this yet as I don't know whether some data in iCloud may get corrupted by restoring to an older version.\nDoes anybody have any experience with this kind of thing?\n\nA: You cannot downgrade unless one of the following is true:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple is still signing installations of the previous version of the OS to which you wish to downgrade, or\n\n*Your phone is jailbroken, you have saved your SHSH blob from the prior version, and you have a way to run a replay attack with that SHSH blob to trick the device into believing Apple is still signing that version.\n\n\nYou can determine whether a particular version of iOS is currently being signed for a given device on ipsw.me. Simply change 8.2 in the URL to the version you want to check, such as 8.0 or 8.3.\nThis list of updates, from the same website, shows when Apple starts and stops signing a given version.\nIn your case, 8.2 stopped being signed on 5/4/15. Therefore it is no longer possible to downgrade. Generally the window is about a month or so after a new version is released.\n\nA: If you go to the folder that the backup was made there is a list of different coded long numbered folders there, use the list of the available iphone backups to determine the backup you want to restore. Inside that folder there will be an info.plist file open it with a text editor. It will have the version of the IPSW in that file. Search for \"Product Version\" and you should be able to find a string below with the version number of that backup. Edit that number to the version of the device you want to restore to and save the file. Then the backup should show up in itunes and you will be able to restore this backup to your device with an earlier IOS version.\nProduct Version\n    8.3\nKeep in mind this is experimental. \n\nA: I just got around this problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Setup the phone as a new phone, not from backup.\n\n*Go to General > Updates and update to iOS 8.3\n\n*Go to General > Reset and Reset all Data and Content.  This will keep the iOS version on the as 8.3.\n\n*Now you can setup the phone and restore those new backups!\n\n\nA: I had the same problem. You can put your iOS device into recovery mode, then restore it using iTunes.\nTry this approach from Apple, if you can't update or restore your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off your device and leave it off.\n\n*Plug in your device's USB cable to a computer with iTunes. \n\n*Hold down the Home button on your device as you connect the USB cable. Keep holding down the Home button until you see the Connect to iTunes screen.\n\n*When you see this screen, release the Home button. If you don't see this screen, try steps 1 through 3 again.\n\n", "Q: How to suppress the Delete From All Devices confirmation in the Photos app?

(Boot Camp) So I installed Windows 8.1 x64 using the Boot Camp Assistant on my Yosemite, iMac 5K 27\".\nThe max screen resolution is being reported as 3840x2160.\nI cannot explain what exactly is wrong, but my strain is huge after working in this setup for ~2 hours. It wasn't so in MacOS. I suppose the problem is with graphics driver.\nI updated Windows 8.1 - everything I could.\nWhat worries me is that the latest Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5640 does not list iMac 27' 5K:\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/DL1721?locale=en_AU\n.. and the AMD website where I wanted to try their driver here:\nhttp://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop?os=Windows%208.1%20-%2064\nsays:\nThis driver is not intended for use on AMD products running in Apple Bootcamp platforms. Users of these platforms should contact their manufacturer for driver support.\nThen, I tried to contact Apple Support - I have an extended support for 3 years (AppleCare). They asked me nicely to go and ask Microsoft for this.\nFinally, I contacted Microsoft Support and they proposed that I subscribe to their support service (e.g. spend another $100+) and they will solve my issue. They assured me they knew the solution and they even had an internal technical  note about a similar case. Besides the feeling of being cheated, I supposed there should be drivers for my case, but I can't find anything.\nPlease help me - how else can I try to solve the issue, what system info you want to know in order to give advice, and where should I look for more references / reading?\nUPD. I've also tried these drivers from AMD designed for BootCamp, but it did not help:\nhttp://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop/bootcamp\n\nA: Back in 2015 there was a Bootcamp Update that came through Apple Software update (ATI/AMD driver), which enabled full 5k resolution for Windows 8.1.\nSadly Apple pulled this update silently. I only know the version number of that gorgeous driver: 15.201.2001-15005a-295390C\nBut the only way to get it, is a private person, which did that update and did not delete the installer, usually located in: \"C:AMD/\".\nIf I once get that driver back, I will share with everyone! Maybe someone can help?\n\nA: Update 1:\nDid you check Apple Software Update. The updater should be installed on you computer. \nAlso, try Windows update. Most of the time any additional drivers will be listed as optional updates. You should also make sure the box: \"Give me recommended updates the same way I receive important update\" is checked off.\n(Ok, I see where you said you did all the updates already)\n\nThe instructions from Apple say to download the drivers using Boot Camp Assistant.\nSee System requirements to install Windows on your Mac via Boot Camp.\nAfter launching the Boot Camp Assistant, there should be a check box something like below:\n\nDid you install Windows with using the Boot Camp Assistant? Also, I assume you know how to change the resolution of your display once windows is installed.\nOn some models, the brightness is adjusted by clicking the Boot Camp icon on the Control Panel.\n\nA: The answer could be that Windows 8.1 simply not ready to manage that kind of resolution. Yet.\n\nA: From a little research I was not able to find anything that actually described getting the full 5K out of the iMac if you're on Windows.\nFrom a dated Mashable article:\n\nFrom what I can gather, that's because AMD hasn't updated its driver for the graphics card inside the iMac to support 5K. So at the time of this writing, the maximum resolution the display can use is 3840 x 2160.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to select which version of Swift to use in Xcode? There's an update for Xcode 6.3 and it includes a new version of Swift (1.2). If I update, do I have to migrate all my Swift code to 1.2 or can I select an older version of Swift?\n\nA: You have to migrate all your code to Swift 1.2 if you're using Xcode 6.3.  If you go to Edit > Convert > To Latest Swift Syntax, it will help find many of the changes.  However, there's still a lot of manual editing to do.\nIn the long run, it will serve you better to keep your Swift code at the latest version so that future migrations are easier and so that you can take advantage of future enhancements to the language.\n\nA: You can select which version of Swift you'd like to use in Xcode 7.3 via the following: (Menu) XCode > Toolchains > (select your version)\n\n\nA: You can install multiple toolchains for Xcode to use - wrote a small how-to here: https://medium.com/@pardel/using-old-versions-of-swift-in-xcode-4dd46644a257\nTL;DR - Download & install old Swift toolchains from: https://swift.org/download/#releases\n", "Q: How much Safari history is kept on iPad?

Such as the default Mail client?  I have my own that I use and like.\n\nA: Most if not all of Apple's own apps aren't removable like apps you download from the App Store. The only way to get them \"out of the way\" is either put them all in a separate screen, or put them in a folder (by dragging one over the other to create such folder) and then keep them there or drag the folder itself off screen (to a screen you don't use and don't have any other apps on)\nTo drag applications, either to change their placement or create folders, tap on any app and keep holding until they start to \"shake\".

This is how it looks right now\n\nThese are my \"Language & Region\" settings\n\nThere is clearly a bug involved. I don't want use an app to solve such ridiculously simple prolem. It should be reading this format from somewhere right?\n\nA: I don't know whether you ever got the above method to work, but it never did the trick for me. However, I seem to have found a way that works without resorting to a 3rd party app. I was pulling my hair out about this because I wanted to have a '.' as the time separator, and even when using the defaults command like so:\ndefaults write com.apple.menuextra.clock \"DateFormat\" \"EEE MMM d  H.mm\"\n\nIt would successfully assign the value, but every time I killed the menu bar, it would inexplicably revert to the default format. I'm not sure how permanent this will be, but I did a quick loop in bash and after running it for a few seconds, I killed the menu bar from a separate shell, and then returned to the loop and killed it - voilà!\nSo, basically from shell 1:\nwhile true;\n\n    > do;\n    > defaults write com.apple.menuextra.clock \"DateFormat\" \"EEE MMM d  H.mm\";\n    > done;\n\n...then in another shell:\nkillall -KILL SystemUIServer\n\nAnd then return to the first shell and kill the loop.

Later I noticed that when I try to speak on the phone I cannot hear a single thing, also if I try to play music or use siri I cannot hear anything, but if alarm sets off or a timer or I have an incoming call the sound is working.\nI tried restarting my phone but the situation remains. Not sure what is up with my phone and don't really want to pay for speaker replacement. Has anyone experienced anything similar?\nI have also noticed that when I try to increase/decrease volume it says Headphones, however the phone is not connected to any headphones neither wired not wireless\n\nA: I just worked it out. The entire time Bluetooth was on. Usually when I turn off my car the phone automatically disconnects. I guess this time something went wrong. Even after restarting the phone away from the off car the phone still thought it was connected. All it took is to turn Bluetooth off\n", "Q: Update my iPad Software If I update my iPad 4 to iOS 8 from iOS 6, will the standard Over-The-Air update procedure delete any of my data? I don't have a computer to back it up, so this is important.\n\nA: Generally, updating OTA (over-the-air) is pretty safe, but it's always advisable to have a backup. Doing an update won't clear anything on the device unless something goes drastically wrong.\nIn my experience, the larger the jump in OS build, the more risk there is of something going wrong with the update. 9 times out of 10, it goes off without a hitch, but every now and then something else comes in to play that can cause the update to fail.\nWhat I would suggest you do is back up your device to iCloud if possible, plug it in to make sure it has a constant power source and can't run flat, and then reset your settings. Don't worry, resetting your settings won't erase any content, but you will have to set things up again such as your home screen layout and your background. To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open \"Settings\"\n\n*Navigate to and tap \"General\"\n\n*Scroll to the bottom and tap \"Reset\"\n\n*Tap \"Reset All Settings\"\n\n\nYou may be asked for your pin and iCloud password at this point so go ahead and enter it. Remember, you won't lose any saved information!\nThe reason I recommend this is that sometimes there can be a preference that you've changed that can cause a hiccup, or the settings have corrupted somehow and the update will freak out about it (this happened fairly infrequently when I worked at an AASP). Doing this will make sure there's no residual \"fluff\" before you do the update.\n", "Q: Make Yosemite Installer USB drive that does not require internet access There are plenty of instructions on how to to make a Yosemite installer USB drive that work using either the createinstallmedia program or Diskmaker X. However, when I take that drive to a machine which cannot be connected to the internet or to wifi, the installer tells me the OS cannot be installed because an internet connection is required. For all previous versions of the OS, it was trivial to do this with Diskmaker X because the installer did not require internet access.\nAssuming this is possible, how can I make an installer USB drive which will not require network access?\n\nA: I just noticed that 10.10.3 was available and tried it again. I am guessing that others noticed this bug and reported the problem for 10.10.2. createinstallmedia works as expected.\n\nA: You could try installing a temporary OS onto a removable USB drive & use that to boot the other machine - then update it from that external boot using the regular installer.\n", "Q: Is it possible to stream from Safari to Apple TV with a MacBook Pro late 2008 with OS X 10.9.5?

After that, reset your SMC and reset your PRAM. Like so...\n\n\n*\n\n*In OSX, open Disk Utility (⌘ + Space and then type \"Disk Utility\")\n\n*Select your OSX partition on the left, on the right, click \"Repair Disk Permissions\"\n\n*When that is finished, click on \"Repair Disk\". If that is greyed out, select \"Verify Disk\" instead.\n\n*To reset SMC, shut down your Mac and connect it to power. While it is turned off, on the left side your keyboard press Shift + Control + Option + Power\n\n*You might not see anything happen at all. That's normal. \n\n*Next, reset PRAM. Turn on the computer and VERY QUICKLY press and HOLD Command (⌘) + Option + P + R (this takes two hands usually)\n\n*Wait until your computer does the restart ding a couple of times, and then release the keys. Let it finish booting.\n\n\nAt this point, any weird issues should be fixed. If you still have problems, you may need to reinstall OSX. If you still have problems after that, you have a hardware issue and need to take the computer to Apple for evaluation and repair.\n\nA: I would try a couple of things. \nFirst create another user and log in as that user and see if any of your issues repeat. If they do then it is related to the system and not the User environment. If they do not there is likely a start up item for that user that is causing the problem.\nThen reboot the Mac while holding down the shift key. When you see the gray Apple logo you may release the shift key. Boot could take a lot longer than normal, this is normal. Eventually the boot screen will show \"Safe Mode.\nOnce booted and logged in operate the Mac and see if you can duplicate the issue. If not then there is either something that was installed or the O/S has become corrupted. See safe mode turns off all user installed things and some parts of the O/S to give you a working environment. \nSo if problems persist in Safe Mode, back up your stuff, boot into internet recovery mode and re-install the operating system. If it is not too inconvenient and you have a good backup and copies of anything you have installed I would reformat the HD and start fresh, just to be sure you clear any damaged/corrupted/bad files/apps.\nThe less fun part about now is that there may be a hardware failure. In that case make an appointment with a Genius at your local Apple store and tell them what you have already done. Be sure you back up your Mac before taking it to Apple as they could reformat the drive while troubleshooting your issue.\nYou may also want to post all the long descriptions of the apps crashing as it may help narrow down the issue further.\n", "Q: Can I use the promotional Apple images in my apps tutorial screen?

As you can see, I use Time Machine to backup on drive \"Data\" on \"ZRH\" which is a Time Capsule. To the best of my knowledge, I selected \"Encrypt backups\" when I configured this backup a few weeks ago. But as I have a look into the configuration, the box \"Encrypt backups\" is not checked.\nI wonder whether my backup is actually not encrypted or whether this is just sort of a \"bug\" in the configuration menu that the checkbox does not show the actual encryption state.\nI have File Vault enabled.\n(Trial and error is not an option in this case, since it's a 500 GB backup which would take forever to rebuild.)\nIt would already help if a few of you could just have a look into their backup configuration and check whether the checkbox is checked for encrypted backups.\n\n\nA: I deleted the old backup and created a new one, with encryption on: \nYes, the checkbox in the above screenshot is displayed as checked if the backup is encrypted.\n\nA: Make sure the driver is partitioned in GUID format. If you do elect to reformat it as GUID, this will erase your data. Also, network backups can only be encrypted before the first backup is carried out.\nHover over the greyed out checkbox and I think you should be able to see an explanation.\n\nA: I know it is an old message but the answer can still be useful.\nIn the screenshot above there is a disk named \"Data\" in the \"Available Disks\". Click on it and it will be possible to enable encryption. This works at least in Sierra (not sure about earlier systems). Beware that encryption may take a lot of time. But you can eject the drive to pause encryption and reconnect to resume it automatically.\n", "Q: Getting an unsuitable terminal error when opening tmux after switching to homebrew Longtime macports user (tmux / 256color etc worked fine).

I wouldn't want to step on anyone's toes, but likewise, I'd like to let it be known that the game will more than likely be available on iOS upon completion.\n\nA: You could state that your game is under development for iOS, and if you are waiting for approval you can state it is submitted to the App Store or that it is Waiting approval for the App Store.\nIn Apples documentation it is known as 'Submitting Your App to the Store'\n", "Q: Changin IRC default client on Mavericks I installed Colloquy and then LimeChat IRC clients. I realized Colloquy opens automatically when clicking on a link like irc://irc.freenode.net/kolab\nHow can I changed these links to open in LimeChat?\n\nA: You can set defaults using something like RCDefaultApp (old but free & still functional)\nUse the URLS header & set your default app by finding the protocol in the URLs list & selecting the default in the drop menu on the right.\n", "Q: What is the best way to limit the time of use of iPad 4? I have iPad 4 with iOS 8.2. Also, I have a child. I want to set some time limit (per day) of use of iPad for my child. \nAlso, I want to have some profiles or something like that. Other words, I want to have time limit on Profile 1, but I don't want time limitation on other profiles, which have to protect by password.\n\nA: Sorry but iPads (and iPhones) aren't intended to be used as multi-user devices. At least not like you mean with different profiles like you would find in Windows devices or recent version of Android.\nThe closest thing on iOS devices is Guided Access, where you can lock the device to a particular application and specify time limits. You need to enable it in \"Settings > General > Accessibility > Guided Access\" choosing a password and turning on the Accessibility shortcut which allows you to bring up the Guided Access feature by triple clicking the Home button. Then you open the app you want to lock the device to, triple-click the Home button and it will allow you to specify time limits, and allow you to enable or disable certain parts of the device. Then click Start.\nYou can read more about Guided Access on Apple's website here.\nThere are other third party applications that promise to offer similar features, you might want to investigate them. Of the ones I looked at none stood out and the reviews didn't inspire confidence.\n", "Q: Where else can I download the legacy Java SE 6 runtime? I just upgraded to OSX Yosemite.\nI am trying to open my Adobe Flash CS6 app, but it says\n\nTo open \"Flash\" you need to install the legacy Java SE 6 runtime.\n\nA simple google search yields this page: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6604985\nThere are several links there - however, they all lead to the same site: a downloads page from Apple that offer the required Java SE runtime. The page is the following:\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_US\nBut it cannot be viewed, since it has a redirect loop.\nWhere else can I download this?\n\nA: Go to https://www.apple.com/support/ then search for DL1572\nSee Apple Knowledgebase pages often blank\n EDIT - or in this case, not… as it doesn't seem to fix it\nUpdate:\nOriginal KB link appears to be working again.\nWould appear to have been an Apple issue, now resolved.\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572\n\nA: The problem appears to be that the page is set to redirect to itself.\nUsing the Live HTTP Headers plugin for Chrome shows the following code being returned by the server.\nHTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily\nCache-Control: no-siteapp\nConnection: keep-alive\nContent-Length: 0\nDate: Sat, 18 Apr 2015 20:08:55 GMT\nLocation: https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_GB\nServer: AkamaiGHost\n\nEssentially telling it to redirect to itself.

And I cannot connect to my wifi.\nLast, I have a Crucial SSD (2 years old)\nIs there a way to know exactly what is going on ? I tried to boot in verbose mode (CMD + V) but it did not work neither.\n\nA: One would say it is your Disk, it got damaged. \nSurprisingly the Verbose does not work at all? \n\nthe \"s\" key for single-user mode. (Command-S) the \"v\" key for verbose\n  mode. (Command-V)\n\nIf you try the Single user, it should open the terminal.\nAlternatively you can use the Internet Recovery mode that already shows as option. Read this from Apple about Internet Recovery mode \nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314\nIf you have a bootable OS X - USB you could use it to try to fix problems as well.\n", "Q: Can i reset my iphone using my laptop? I dropped my iPhone 5c and the right hand side of the screen doesn't work but I need to wipe all my data from it, how can I do this using my laptop?\n\nA: From Apple's article on restoring iDevices using iTunes: \n\n  \n*\n  \n*Connect your device to your computer using the cable that came with it.\n  \n*Select your iPhone, iPad, or iPod when it appears in iTunes. \n  \n*In the Summary panel, click Restore.\n  \n*Click Restore again to confirm that you want to restore your device to factory settings and delete all data and content. iTunes will\n  download the device software file and restore your device.\n  \n*After your device is restored to factory settings, it will restart. When it does, you’ll see the \"Slide to set up” welcome screen. Follow\n  the steps in the device Setup Assistant. You can set up your device as\n  new or use a previous backup. If you restored an iOS device that has\n  cellular service, it will activate after you finish setting up your\n  device.\n\n", "Q: Apple TV Black screen (OS X Yosemite ) I have MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014) and also a third generation Apple TV. Lately, especially after 10.10.3 update for OS X Yosemite, I am having mirroring issues.\nI have checked all the links, forums etc on google and still no luck. \nThe problem is basically, my ipad 2/iphone 5 can successfully mirror to Apple TV, but when I try to mirror my MBP, it only shows black screen with audio..\nI cannot control the apple tv settings from my menu bar on MBP either. It does not let me choose whether to extend my desktop or mirror built-in display.\nOn web, I read forums with similar questions but they are generally left unanswered or did not work for me. \nThanks in advance xxx\n\nA: In cases where something appears to work, but it is not following your commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*Logging as different user and try again, to check if your profile/permissions needs repairs.\n\n*Open Disk Utility located in your utility folder, and use the Repair Permissions.\n\n\nA: I had this problem with two teachers:\n1) I un - replugged the ATV - that fixed the first one.\n2) Other teacher was recently upgraded to MacBook Air, then it worked for about a week before getting black screen, but audio ok. She could get it to work from her iPad, iPhone, and I could get it to work from my MBPro.\nFor Teacher 2 I changed the resolution IN THE APPLE TV. Did not help to change resolution in computer until after I found that using 1080p HD - 50Hz (TV Resolution) from ATV Audio/Video from menu was the resolution that worked.\n\nA: There seem to exist a multitude of possible reasons for this bug. Mine was having Duet Display installed. After some fruitless googling I followed a hunch and found this FAQ on their website:\n\nSome customers are reporting issues with AirPlay when Duet is\n  installed and they mirror or extend their desktop to an Apple TV. We\n  have consulted with lead engineers on Apple's Airplay team and they\n  are aware of the issue with 3rd party display applications but a fix\n  does not seem likely in the foreseeable future.\n\nSo there's that. In case of Duet Display this means deinstalling the app. Simply quitting the app won't cut it. Fortunately they made it really easy and added a Deinstall option to the app menu. It's just too bad Duet and Airplay cannot co-exist.\nEDIT: To extend on the symptoms I experienced, Airplay worked flawlessly out of iTunes. When activating Airplay mirroring or screen extension, the Apple TV only showed the black screen but played the mirrored audio.\n\nA: I was having this same issue. I just restarted my MBP and now AirPlay is working fine.\n\nA: This answer works for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and run uninstall for Air-Parrot http://support.airsquirrels.com/article.php?id=8\n\n*Manually deleted the following files:\nAPExtFramebuffer  located at: System/Library/Extensions\nAirParrotDriver   located at: System/Library/Extensions\nAirParrotDriver   located at: /Library/Extensions\n\n\n*Restart\nI found the answer here : https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5952624?tstart=0\n", "Q: How to find .bashrc or .zshrc? I just got a MacBook Pro and am in the process of trying to get GNU commands installed.

Already have Xcode installed. Total newbie at this.\n\nA: To know which shell are you using, use the following command:\n$ echo $SHELL\n\nIt will return something like:\n/bin/bash\n\nor\n/bin/zsh\n\nAfter you know the shell, if the file .bashrc or .zshrc doesn't exist in your home directory (echo $HOME to find out), just create it.\nIf you are using bash, you may have a file called .bash_profile where you can put your export command instead (don't know in zsh).\n\nA: Create your .bashrc with your text editor & add any files you want. Go to terminal and type in: ls -a   It will show some hidden files.\n", "Q: if i have used someone elses apple id to download an app, will it erase when i update my phone on itunes? i used my friends apple id to download a music app that she had downloaded as i could not find it on my apple id, will it erase if i update my phone on my iTunes off my laptop?\n\nA: The app will not be erased and you can use it. But as Tetsujin said, you cannot update the app to the latest version without your friend's app Apple Id.\n", "Q: Does App Store Review Board allow Photoshopping a screenshot to show fake content? I am preparing to submit an app that records trails (like Runkeeper) to the app store, and I think that it would be great if the screenshots of my app shows it filled with trails on the main screen. But the problem is, it is very time consuming to record trails and save them in the iOS simulator, and heck, I've got to do this time-consuming task for every iPhone and iPad required. You may think that it is less time consuming if I recorded trails with real devices. But I don't have all the devices. So I've come up with a solution to use Photoshop to fill the main screen screenshot (only the main screen, only one screen) with content, but fake ones, but they look really real, and it's hard to differentiate between a real one and a fake one. But does App Store Review Board allow this? Thank you very much.\n\nA: Only the App Store review staff can provide an absolute answer.\nHowever, many apps in the store show modified screenshots. Providing mock content is common place when advertising document based applications.\nSubmit your app for review. If the review is rejected, they will provide a reason and you will have the opportunity to resubmit.\n", "Q: Wallpaper flickering I've noticed after updating to the latest OS X update 10.10.3 my desktop wallpaper flickers frequently.\nThe flickering will momentarily go if I have a window cover the location of flickering but it will appear again about 10 minutes later.\nCould someone tell me how to resolve this? or at least troubleshoot the issue.\nI have a Mac Mini (Late 2012).\nUPDATE:\nScreenshot of my console as requested:\n\n2ND UPDATE:\nAdded screenshots of my screen settings and new console log.\n\n\n\nA: Thanks for the Console log:\nI see two item making problems with the User Interface (UI) in (WindowServer)\nOne is the VLC.app and the second one is the \"Transmit application\"\nI know what is VLC app, so just disable (remove) it to test.

I'm running OS X Yosemite 10.10.2 on my Mac Book Pro Retina 15\" early 2013 and find that starting back around Mavericks, my Adobe Acrobat Pro X and now XI crashes frequently.  Sometimes with Yosemite, I also see the finder crashing.  I'm not seeing issues with other applications.  I visited the genius bar today and the person there suggested to re-image my computer.  I'm hesitant to do this because it is a big time commitment and I'm not convinced it will resolve the issue.  I would have to back up everything and deactivate all my software, re-image, and then reinstall all my software.  I imagine this would take around 5 hours to complete all those steps.\nI report the crash to apple each time it occurs, but not sure that has any effect, as I've been reporting for a long time now, and it still persists.\nIs this likely a corruption of the operating system that a reinstall would fix or is this just a bug that would return upon re-image?  If it is a corruption of the OS, is there any other way to repair without doing a clean install that would take me many hours?\nHere is a portion of an example report:\nProcess:               AdobeAcrobat [17873]\nPath:                  /Applications/Adobe Acrobat XI Pro/Adobe Acrobat Pro.app/Contents/MacOS/AdobeAcrobat\nIdentifier:            com.adobe.Acrobat.Pro\nVersion:               11.0.10 (11.0.10)\nCode Type:             X86 (Native)\nParent Process:        ???

see the complete report here, which is too big to include in this question.\n\nI don't have a reliable way to cause either the Finder or Acrobat to crash.  The Finder crashes are much rarer.  For Acrobat, I do notice a couple patterns:\n\n\n*\n\n*Crashes sometimes occur just after saving the document (this is the case for the above crash report).\n\n*Crashes sometimes occur related to adding text to the document via the Add Text tool under Content Editing.\n\n\nIn either case, it seems that mouse movements might trigger the issue and thus I think I might be reducing the probability of crashing by avoiding mouse movements for a bit after either of the above two actions.\n\nHere is the Etre Check report for my system.\n\nA: I wouldn't reinstall an operating system because one application is misbehaving. That doesn't really make any sense. This could just be a bug in Adobe's software. If there is a way to report bugs to Adobe I'd try that, I'm sure they'll be more interested in faults in their own software than Apple will be in what is to them third-party software.\nAnyway.\nThe first thing I'd do is make sure I had all the latest updates installed. This could be a bug that someone has already reported and Adobe have fixed. It looks like you do have the latest version of Adobe Acrobat XI though.\nThe second thing I'd do is I would try the application within a new account. As you use an application is creates all kind of settings, cache, etc files throughout your account. Create a new account, which will essentially be starting from scratch without these files and see if it works reliably there without crashing. If it does then the case of the crashes are something within your own account.\nThe third thing would be to try cleaning up after the application in your own account. So locate all the files that Adobe Acrobat has created within your account and either delete or temporarily rename them (caches under /User/USERNAME/Library/Caches/Adobe..., preferences under /User/USERNAME/Library/Preferences, perhaps other files in something like /User/USERNAME/Library/Adobe, etc). And then try the application again. You can try this a step at a time, to try to identify which is causing the problem.\nIf there are a serious of steps you follow that reliably cause the application to crash, please update your question and we might be able to give a more specific answer.\n\nA: Besides the advice already given, have a good look at your fonts; a wonky font can cause Acrobat to misbehave.\nThere is also an utility available from Adobe (no, I don't have the link available right now), which does a deep cleaning of everything Acrobat; you might therefore consider running that tool and reinstall Acrobat.\n", "Q: iOS - Lower volume before playing video Sometimes I want to play a video but I'm in a meeting or a place where I can't afford to wait for the video to start to then quickly press the volume buttons to make it softer.\nIs there any way I can mute the audio for a video before playing it? It seems like a valid scenario.\n\nA: You can lower volume without playing the video.\n\nfrom another answer:\n\nThe control center works (swipe up from bottom of screen and slide volume slider as desired).\nIn iOS 9 at least, you can also go Settings -> Sounds and under the Ringer and Alerts section, turn off \"Change with Buttons\", then use the volume buttons on the side of the phone to adjust the media volume. You can leave this option off to always have media volume control with the hardware buttons if you are OK with the ringer volume being just off or on at a preset level using the silent toggle switch on the side of the phone.\n\n\nA: While there should be a better way to choose which volume to use, and changing the settings option of Change with Buttons to Off, there is a much easier way to control the volume of the media you’re watching instead of paying attention in meetings at work. \nSimply put (I assume you need it simple since you obviously have a low attention span), turn your privacy on. On the iPhone, it’s the little switch over the volume buttons on top left side of phone. \nThen, you can open your dancing piglets video, set the volume while it’s playing, then turn your privacy off again. \nThere.  Have a good meeting. Hope they don’t ask you any questions that aren’t about princess penelope and the piglets of penzance. \n", "Q: iphone 6: Making some apps not need passcode On my iPhone6, I have set a passcode to unlock. On a locked home screen, the screen can be slid up to run some apps (e.g. flashlight, timer/clock, calculator, camera, YouTube) in the locked state. Is it possible to add some other apps to run while it is locked? \nFor instance, I want the phone to have a passcode to unlock, but want to let the Dictionary app to be run without requiring to enter the passcode.\nIs that possible?\n\nA: With the exception of the Clock, Camera, and Calculator apps (which can be opened in Action Center (if you have it enabled in the lock screen)), there is no way to open any app without a passcode.\nThere is limited functionality with push notifications (but only on certain conditions, like, say, a tweet pops up in the lock screen and you can either retweet or favourite the tweet) and in Notification Center (if enabled in the lock screen), but that depends on whether or not the app has support for either one.\n", "Q: What is the difference between a 2011 i5, and a more recent i5? I am looking at my daughter's MBP.  It is circa 2010/2011, and has a 2.4 i5. Why are processors today called the same name, but are advertised with slower clock speeds? \n\nA: So lets compare the i5 family of CPU on MBP.\nThe i5 is a brand name for a family of processor, that is why is it still called i5.\nCore i5\" 2.4 13-Inch (Late 2011) features a 32 nm \"Sandy Bridge\" 2.4 GHz Intel \"Core i5\" processor (2435M), with two independent processor \"cores\" on a single silicon chip with a 3 MB shared level 3 cache.\nThe 2015 MBP has up to 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor (Turbo Boost up to 3.3GHz) with 3MB shared L3 cache.\nBased on this alone the 2015 model is >30% faster.\n", "Q: Trouble with IMovie? My friend can get iMovie for free on his iPhone, but I can't. I still have to pay $4.99 for the app. I've asked 3 other friends about the app and all of them get it free. Why can't I get this app?\n\nA: Here is what Apple says:\nFeb 3, 2015 - To qualify for these free apps, you need a device that was activated or purchased on or after September 1, 2013. \nWhen you upgrade to iOS 8 on a qualifying device or buy a new device with iOS 8, you'll have access to these apps for free: iMovie\n", "Q: Can I list donors' names in my app to thank them for donations made externally? Will my app pass Apple's review process if I list the names of donors in my app?  I don't have any link to donate in the app, and there is no way for users of my app to donate in the app.  All donations are handled externally.  Donors do not get any additional features.\nDonations are not to a charity or non-profit.  My app is free.  Would the answer be different if any of these were not the case?\n\nA: Yes, it turned out you can do this.  I submitted by app to the App Store and it was approved.  Apps cannot have a link to donate, but they can list donors' names.\nIf you are a registered non-profit, you can put a link to your site to donate in your app.\n", "Q: OS X firewall blocking torrents outside of VPN I've seen plenty of tutorials for this around for Windows but I'm wanting to do it on OS X Yosemite. Is it possible to configure the firewall such that torrent traffic will only ever be permitted when I'm a connected to a VPN?\n\nA: Yes it is possible, you can create a blocking rule using pf, that only allows traffic on the the port your torrent software is using, to/from the virtual interface created by the VPN. Take a look at a cheat sheet for pf for ideas. Or if you prefer a GUI you might check out icefloor.\n", "Q: 30hz vs 60hz 4K output I am currently using a MacBook Pro 13\" 2015 model with a Samsung U28D590 UHD display.\nCurrently I am using the HDMI port of the monitor with a mini-displayport to HDMI adapter and receive 4K 30hz output. The display is kind of laggy at the moment, with noticeable input lag with the mouse being the main issue. \nWhen I switch to a lower resolution it returns to 60hz output and it is much smoother (less pixels) and the mouse input lag is gone.\nMy question is if I just use a displayport cable and receive 4K 60hz output, will this input lag disappear?\n\nA: Most likely, yes. The only caveat being that OS X 4k @ 60hz support has been buggy for all of Yosemite.\nYou'll need a high quality Mini-displayport to Displayport cable. Look for DisplayPort 2.0.\n", "Q: To concatenate with BSD Join I want to concatenate in BSD Join. \nData\nModel Decreasing Constant Increasing\n2025 75.5 82.5 89.5\n2035 65.5 82.5 102\n2050 49.5 82.5 112\n\nand error configuration in ybar\nModel Decreasing Constant Increasing\n2025 2.5 2.5 2.5\n2035 2.5 2.5 5\n2050 7.5 7.5 7.5\n\nwhich should be \n2025 75.5 82.5 89.5 2.5 2.5 2.5\n...\n\nUnix variant join A B does work according to my friend. \nOutputs from Head\n$ head model1_ave.dat\nYear Decreasing Constant Increasing\n2025 75.5 82.5 89.5\n2035 65.5 82.5 102\n2050 49.5 82.5 112\n$ head model1_ave_err.dat \nModel Decreasing Constant Increasing\n2025 2.5 2.5 2.5\n2035 2.5 2.5 5\n2050 7.5 7.5 7.5\n\nHow can you concatenate the two files in OSX Join i.e BSD?\n\nA: join works for me here:\npse@Mithos:~/t$ join -1 1 -2 1 t1 t2\nModel Decreasing Constant Increasing Decreasing Constant Increasing\n2025 75.5 82.5 89.5 2.5 2.5 2.5\n2035 65.5 82.5 102 2.5 2.5 5\n2050 49.5 82.5 112 7.5 7.5 7.5\n\nIn case there are non-matching header lines in each file you need to get rid of them first, otherwise the joining will fail.\npse@Mithos:~/t$ join -1 1 -2 1 <(grep -v Year t1) <(grep -v Model t2)\n2025 75.5 82.5 89.5 2.5 2.5 2.5\n2035 65.5 82.5 102 2.5 2.5 5\n2050 49.5 82.5 112 7.5 7.5 7.5\n\n", "Q: Unknown tag in finder I have an external SSD which i used on my previous mac. The SSD had couple of files tagged in various colours (green, red etc)\nWhen i moved to new MAC, the files still retain their colours and is not corresponding to new mac, though the colours are same.\nGreen was from my old MAC, and I have no option of removing it from my new one.\n\n\nA: If the files you have issues with are self-created simple files like the text file you depicted, you can run a Terminal command on those files to clear out specific or all extended attributes.  This will effectively remove ANY tag you attached previously.  Once done, you can re-attach tags in the fashion you already know.\nKeep in mind that some applications may use extended attributes to complement the data inside a file.  So, deleting all attributes is not always the best idea.  For simple (text/image) files, it should be ok however.\nHere are the commands to clear the responsible extended attributes:\nxattr -d com.apple.FinderInfo /drag/your/file/from/Finder/here\nxattr -d com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags /drag/your/file/from/Finder/here\n\nHere is the command for clearing ALL extended attributes on a given file:\nxattr -c /drag/your/file/from/Finder/here\n\nTo know what extended attributes are attached to a file, you can run the following command in Terminal to list them:\nls -ld@ /drag/your/file/from/Finder/here\n\nOutput from that last command will look something like this:\ndrwxr-xr-x@ 2 youruser  staff  68 Apr 19 14:28 /your/file/from/Finder/here\n    com.apple.FinderInfo    32 \n    com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags 52 \n\n", "Q: Time capsule wired backup transfer slow with fast \"bursts\" I have recently bought a 3TB A1470 Time capsule (the latest, 'tall' ac model) to replace a 2TB A1409 (the 'flat' one, n model).\nThe Airport utility was helpful in moving the network settings over from one device to the next.\nI would also like to transfer the exiting backup as per these instructions, i.e. by connecting the old time capsule to the new one and connecting my macbook to the old time capsule.\nEverything works but according to the estimates, copying over 1.4 TB of backup would take 2 days over what is supposedly all Gigabit Ethernet connections...\nFinding this a bit ridiculous I decided to look at the troughput over my connections using Activity Monitor:\n\n300 GB in, the results are quite odd: most of the time, throughput is quite low, hovering around 5MB/s but every few minutes or so the speed will increase dramatically (as pictured) but these higher speeds can never be maintained.\nBoth TC's are on the latest firmware, as is my macbook Air. Wireless on both TC's is disabled and the computer is not doing anything else and fully up-to-date.\nCould it be that the TC's are throttling their CPU's or something?\nEDIT\nI also noticed that with increasing throughput, the CPU usage on the macbook goes up, but this might be normal as I am using the Thunderbolt GigE adapter.\n\n\nEDIT 2\nAfter giving rsync a try as outlined here it seems that my concept of what a .sparsebundle is, is wrong.\nAfter running rsync, it started to secures through thousands of files... so probably, the sparse bundle is not treated as a single huge file that needs to be copied but rather like a directory of files. This might explain variations in transfer speed? (just thinking out loud here)\n\nA: Time Machine runs as a low priority process by default, and this will cause it to be throttled whenever a higher priority process runs (and possibly to optimize energy usage on battery), hence the performance bursts.\nYou can disable throttling for Time Machine with:\nsudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0\n\nKeep in mind this might increase power usage on battery.\nThis setting will be lost on reboot. To make it permanent, create a launch daemon:\nsudo nano /Library/LaunchDaemons/nothrottle.plist\n\nEnter this text in the file:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n<key>Label</key>\n<string>nothrottle</string>\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n<array>\n<string>/usr/sbin/sysctl</string>\n<string>debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0</string>\n</array>\n<key>RunAtLoad</key>\n<true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nSave it and exit nano (Press ctrl+X, then Y when asked to save changes)\nThen enable the launch daemon:\nsudo chown root /Library/LaunchDaemons/nothrottle.plist\n\nsudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/nothrottle.plist\n\nBackups should now be performed at maximum performance.\n\nIn case you want to re-enable throttling, run:\nsudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=1\n\nIf you had enabled the launch daemon, run:\nsudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/nothrottle.plist\n\nSource\n", "Q: Daisy chain two dell UltraSharp u2414h to MacBook Air (mid 2012)? I have a MacBook Air (Mid 2012) and was thinking about buying 2 Dell UltraSharp u2414h monitors. Would it support daisy chaining these two monitors with the mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable connected from the MacBook to the monitor, and the other mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable connected from the monitor to the second monitor?\n\nA: DisplayPort protocol doesn't chain. It is a one to one technology, so you need two ports on the Mac. \nThunderbolt does chain, so you could have one Thunderbolt Display and then plug a second monitor (either Thunderbolt or Mini DisplayPort) into the first monitor's second connector. \nThat works very well. \n\nA: No, it wont. You must have at least a Thunderbolt 2 connector. Unfortunately Yosemite doesnt support daisy chaining.\n", "Q: Where did these creepy google/gmail icons come from? I just noticed them, I suspect/hope Chrome somehow placed them there, they are not removable by normal methods, they only open Chrome when clicked and nothing else\nGoogle is getting pretty creepy, when a new thing appears that I didn't put, I generally suspect malware\n(Photos icon kept for context)\n\n\nA: After slightly more digging, I see that Chrome now (it's a new behaviour, likely 2-3 months old) bundles them with new installs, since I use the chrome command separately to create new instances, it added those icons just now, for that instance specifically, so when I click them, they just open the main Chrome and not the webpages\nStill pretty creepy tho, they seem to be only removable from ~/Applications - and a restart is probably needed for a refresh\nEdit: After a while the icons disappear after removing the files\n", "Q: iPad plugged to charger turns off due to low battery My iPad is connected to charger yet battery level decreases (not as fast as plugged off but still).\nIs it a fault that can be directed to Apple Support for warranty or normal behaviour? I though that charging by cable and using device means power is taken directly from grid while battery loads.\nPS\nIt's charged by iPhone plug. iPad plug is bigger and I am in trip so took smaller one. Those end plugs give different charging capabilities? Is it safe to actually swap them like that?\n\nA: An iPad needs twice the power of an iPhone to charge.\nA phone charger will slowly be able to charge an iPad, but possibly not be able to keep up whilst it is in use & doing intensive tasks.\nIt's safe to swap them, an iPhone using an iPad charger will not be damaged, but as you see, the other way round, the iPad is not getting sufficient charge.\nEven switched off, the iPad may show 'not charging' at the top right - but it actually will still be charging, just very slowly.\n\nA: What was mentioned above is true. The ipod and iphone uses 1.2 amps, and the ipads use 2 amps. I have run over the same problem tons of times, i Close all apps besides the one i'm using, BUT I have to reduce the brightness to half or less in my device to stay on. If it is at like 50% Brightness  my battery level will remain the same, it will not charge but at least it won't die on me. if i drop the brightness to 25% it will start charging but slower than usual while in use. and if i almost get it back to the lowest i can see it will charge ok. \n\nA: I just had issue twice once in July and just this month it charged to 77% and no more swap cables same swap charging USB same so used it till got down about 36% plug it in charge all night next morning 100%. \n", "Q: AppleScript Quicktime Player to play audio file generates error My Quicktime Player (Version 10.3 727.4) can play mp3 files without any problems, but when I use AppleScript I get an error message: \n\nThe document “audio.mp3” could not be opened.

Any suggestions?\nI backed up my HD the day before dropping off my Mac for repair, and then tried again just before going to my appointment. During this last and final backup my Macbook Air crashed. I have since discovered that the drive will no longer mount, likely due to the crash that occurred during the last attempted backup. I am unsure if the drive can be repaired.\nMy logic board was short circuiting some where that controls the headphone jack. Initially this prevented me from using the jack but eventually caused my mac to crash several times before I brought it in for repair. I believe that it is the this crashing that is responsible for my back up not being accessible but that my data may still be intact.\nThanks for any help you may have!\n\nA: I'm assuming that the port in your macbook air has been confirmed to be in working condition. Another consideration is that the hard drive's port has been damaged.\nAre you able (perhaps through a friend) to test the hard drive functionality on another mac or windows system? Even if you had to reformat on a windows system, that would (hopefully) get the drive functioning, and then you could thereafter reformat for mac.\n", "Q: Brand New Macbook Pro 15\" Battery I just bought a brand new 15\" Macbook Pro (mid 2014) and it came with already 2 battery cycle counts, is that normal?\n\nA: That is great. It sounds like Apple tests their hardware well before sending it out. \nObviously without asking them you can't know for sure, but presumably those two battery counts are to ensure that the battery that you have in the laptop right now is a good battery that performs to spec. \n", "Q: App title hidden? \nWhy is the SE app title hidden?\nI'm jailbroken on iOS 8.1 \n\nA: Try respringing.\nIf you have SSH access, login as root or mobile (doesn't matter which) and type \nrespiring\n\nThis will temporarily make your phone freeze. It will bring you back to the lock screen when done.\nAlternatively, if you don't know how to install/use SSH, install \nSBSettings\n\nfrom Cydia. It will respiring your device when it's done. (When you have installed this, and need to respiring for some reason, swipe right on the status bar to bring up SBSettings.\n\nA: because either the app or your jailbreak went wrong somewhere.\nIt shows just fine on my phone.\nTry re-installing the app, or in iTunes - Backup; Reset; Restore.\n\nA: Try clearing the Springboard cache by running uicache as mobile then respringing.\n", "Q: Missing date in 'About this mac' window I'm looking for used macbook pro and found this one. Why there is no date of manufacture in 'About this mac' window? Can it be hacked mac?\nAlso on second screen shot there is mystical '1Tb flash storage', does it mean 1Tb SSD or why then this hard drive called 'flash storage'?\n\n\n\nA: There are other places in About this Mac, that can give you a hint, like Install date for applications.\nFlash storage means SSD. Apple started selling MBP with 1Tb SSD from 2013. You can check your specific model using the serial number at Apple.\nI did the check on Apple web site and it say you have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013)\nHere is the full report:\n\nAnd the full specs are here https://support.apple.com/kb/SP691?locale=en_US\n\nA: If you are trying to figure out which model of Macbook Pro that is, you can use the serial number from the screenshot.\nJust enter the serial number on a site like EveryMac's Ultimate Mac Lookup and it will tell you about the Mac. For example the below link tells you that this is a Late 2013 Macbook Pro.\nhttp://www.everymac.com/ultimate-mac-lookup/?search_keywords=C02LT3SLFH05\n\nA: If it is a custom order machine, it will not show the \"year\" information. Only standard off-the-shelf machines show that information, just another Apple quirk.\n\nA: This \"feature\" of showing the year in \"About this Mac\" didn't exist when that OS was released. I think it was added in Yosemite 10.10 or El Capitan 10.11. \n", "Q: Uploading images from a Mac to an iPad How do I upload my photos from my iMac to an iPad 3? My operating system is OS X 10.9.5\n\nA: Connect your iPad to your Mac. Open iTunes, select the iPad on the top and on the left you will find a photos menu where you can select what you'd like to sync.\n\nAlternatively, you can use iCloud Photos, which would have to be enabled on both your iMac and your iPad, which will then sync photos over the cloud (via your internet connection). However, if you have a lot of photos, you'd might have to buy additional space on iCloud.\n", "Q: Will two albums duplicate pictures in Photos.app? I am trying to put together several albums and some of them have a picture from another album. For example a parties album and a birthday 2015 album or a granddaughters 2015 album.  So how do I put the same photos in these 3 albums, and are they duplicated or just cross referenced?\n\nA: Just drag the photo from one album to another. The photo will be added to the second album and not removed from the first. Only one master copy of the photo is kept and is cross-referenced throughout the library regardless of where it is used.\n", "Q: Accidentally did rm -r ~/.Trash What should I do now? Will my computer be okay?\n\nA: Yup, the system will recreate it automatically. \nActually about .Trash, it is located on every drive you will connect to your Mac and where you will delete some files. Deleted files on external drive won't show in your local .Trash. \n", "Q: Why do my hidden photos still show up in the Albums? I have a bunch of photos that I have hidden, but I can still see them in my albums. Is there a way to hide them totally?\n\nA: You can delete it! Hide works only for moments, so in moments hidden photos won't appear\n", "Q: Why are my sounds lagging on my 13\" Macbook Pro? System information: 2.4 GHz Intel Core i5, 8GB 1600 MHz DDR3 memory, running on Yosemite 10.10.3, 2014 Macbook pro retina model\n\nSound on my computer keeps lagging, but not sound on videos or anything like that. If I get an iMessage to my computer, I'll get the message right away but it will make the sound for it 5 minutes or so later. \nSame with emails. The sound is delayed to actually receiving them. I've tried restarting my computer and looking around the web, but I don't think it's my RAM, because I've only had the computer for less than a year.\n\nA: I would RESET the Notification app:\n\n*\n\n*Open the Library folder in your Home folder. Hold the \"alt\"key and use GO in Finder that will show you the Library folder\n\n\n*In the Library folder, open the Application Support folder.\n\n\n*Locate the folder named NotificationCenter. Drag this folder to the desktop.\n\n\n*Next, open the Terminal application.\nCopy and paste each line of these commands into the Terminal window, in order. Press return after each line:\ncd getconf DARWIN_USER_DIR\nrm -rf com.apple.notificationcenter\nkillall usernoted; killall NotificationCenter\n\n\n*Close the Terminal app.\n\n\n*Restart your computer.\nWARING: be very careful with the rm-rf part and make 101% sure you copied the correct text.\n", "Q: Is there a way to completely remove all data access, including WiFi, on iPhone 4? We want to give our teen a phone for talk and text only. She has to earn trust again before having access to anything online. We are upgrading and would like to hand down one of our old phones. Our plan is through Sprint if that makes a difference. \n\nA: All iOS devices come with built-in \"Restrictions\" settings as a form of Parental Control. By enabling Restrictions, you can restrict access to certain functionality of the device, including web browsing and other capabilities.\nTo enable Restrictions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open \"Settings\"\n\n*Navigate to and tap \"General\"\n\n*Scroll down and tap \"Restrictions\"\n\n*Tap \"Enable Restrictions\" and enter a passcode. Make sure this is a passcode that only you and your partner will know. It will be used to deactivate restrictions once she has earned your trust, or to temporarily enable certain functionality.\n\n*Toggle off any functionality that you do not want your daughter to have access to (and toggle it back on if you want to incrementally allow her access again)\n\n*Browse through the extra settings and decide which you wish to restrict access to (Facebook and Twitter can come in useful here).\n\n*When you are done, simply tap out or close \"Settings\"\n\n\nWhile this isn't a perfect solution, you will be able to prevent her from browsing the web, using FaceTime or installing any apps this way until she has redeemed herself. \nTo further restrict her, you can do as @Buscar has suggested above and contact Sprint to limit her cellular data access, and I would recommend either changing your WiFi password to something she can't guess (and thus input to connect when you aren't looking) or, even better, block the iPhone's MAC address from your WiFi router. You can find the MAC address in \"Settings\" -> \"General\" -> \"About\".\nDoing all of the above will essentially limit her to simply phone calls and texts (she will be access any media such as music or photos loaded on to the device, however).\n", "Q: What is this 'findmydeviced' in my location icon on the top menu bar? I have location services on (for Maps & Safari only) and I randomly get this location notification on the top menu bar saying:\n\" Apps using location: findmydeviced\" \nWhat does this mean?\n\nA: \"findmydeviced\" is a daemon process that runs on OS X when you have enabled the \"Find My Mac\" option under the iCloud preference pane.\nFor some reason, it doesn't show up under \"Security and Privacy\" as an authorised system service (although this could be by design so that a non-Apple savvy thief wouldn't find it if s/he searched there).\nIf you no longer want to be able to track the location of your Mac via iCloud, you can uncheck the option by navigating to the iCloud preference pane. You may need to reboot in order for the daemon to unload fully.\n", "Q: Wifi per app monitoring on iPad Are there any apps to can monitor iPad network usage per app?\nWhat's going on is out of no where one of our iPads will start uploading to Amazon's datawarehouse. Even if I double-click the button and shut everything down, it still finishes it's \"sync\" -- whatever it's syncing.\nThe problem is we don't know what app is causing this or even why it's causing this. Nothing is set to backup within iCloud.\nFor instance, one of the servers we're uploading 100KB (yes, that's bytes): s3-us-west-2-w.amazonaws.com -- now keep in mind, 100KB is a fairly significant amount of data to be uploading and it's making us very nervous about what data is being sent to Amazon's storage cloud that some arbitrary user has.\nAll we have is the official Amazon app and the Kindle app but my iPad never does this upload action.\nIt does this for non-trivial amount of time (read: > 3 minutes) -- which is a considerable amount of data and makes gaming and web browsing less enjoyable (and by that I mean miserable).\nPowering off the iPad entirely and powering back on the iPad resolves the issue for a few days, which is interesting in and of itself.\nThoughts? I'm very interested in actually resolving the situation than just blocking at the router but can not find an app that allows me to identify which app is drinking my bandwidth like it's vodka.\nEdit 1: iPad is latest generation -- iPad Air 2 -- with WiFi only.\nEdit 2: How do I know what'g going on? I have a RT-AC87U router that tells me. I know it's just his iPad and I know how much it's uploading and downloading and where that data is going. I would expect regular updates / downloads but uploading large quantities of data has us baffled as all he has are video's, manga, Kindle, etc. Backups are handled manually.\nEdit 3: There's a few apps he got from the Apple store such as ComicGlass. I'm not particularly interested in enumerating all the other apps as if there's no way to identify what app is doing this we will wipe the app and iPad go from there. I'm let down that there's no real troubleshooting method to know what application is sending data, of some kind, to a location that we don't have control over that we haven't asked to back up -- and Apple doesn't provide troubleshooting tools to help locate rogue apps like this, so with that, I must confess defeat since no comments have offered more than a manual method of figuring this out.\n\nA: s3-us-west-2-w.amazonaws.com\nAWS in this domain name stands for Amazon Web Services, while S3  stands for:\n\nAmazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) provides a fully redundant data storage infrastructure for storing and retrieving any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the Web.\n\nUS and West probably refer to the location of those servers. (I use Amazon's Glacier to backup some of my data to the cloud so I recognize this pattern)\nThis means your iPad is uploading data to Amazon's cloud servers, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's Amazon's apps, since many developers utilize AWS within their own apps for tracking, monitoring, hosting, and storage. \nProposed solutions:\nI suggest either/both of the following, none of which are \"perfect\" solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*You're saying that no matter what you do, the data is still uploaded. This means that this app has \"Background App Refresh\" enabled. Go to Settings, General, Background App Refresh, and make a list of \"prime suspects\"1, disable background app refresh for these apps one-by-one and see if the uploading stops after you disable the background uploading for this app. (The app would still be able to upload if you use it)\n\n*(This won't work if your iPad is WiFi only) iDevices actually provide you with stats on cellular data usage by app. Go to Settings, Cellular, and scroll down until you see a heading: \"Use Cellular Data For\". Now, take a couple of screenshots at different times, and see if the data usage increases for an app that you haven't used since you've last seen the uploading process.\n1 Would be really helpful if you edit your question with this list as well.\n", "Q: How to disable auto password filling (Keychain) while in private browsing mode in Safari? Keychain offers to auto complete forms including passwords even in private browsing mode. How can I disable this? \nI'm using Safari 8.0.5 on Yosemite 10.10.3.\nEdit: The use case here is when other people need to borrow my computer. I'll open a private browsing window for them. I don't want my credentials auto-filling when they visit site. \n\nA: There is no way currently offered by Apple to disable auto-fill based on the browsing mode. However, you could try to switch auto-fill on/off based browsing mode by making a trigger-effect script or macro with AppleScript or an application like Keyboard Maestro.\n\nA: Not sure why do you need it, but my guess is to allow others to use safari without leaving traces of their activity. Private mode is not what you need. Private mode is useful when you need to access a website without tracking cookies and history and only then.\nWhat you probably need is enabling the Guest account in user accounts. Let others login as a Guest and everything they did, including internet, will be removed upon the logout.\n", "Q: Can I create a backup of a specific partition and restore it later? I have my beta partition on my SSD and I want to create a backup of it so I can identically restore it on a different partition, later.\nMy simple question is: Can I?\nI've got multiple partitions and I thought I'd create a time machine backup of that partition solely, excluding all different partitions, and then on a later moment have a fresh partition and restore that time machine backup. \nBut, it's the first time I would use TimeMachine to actually restore a backup, so.. I want to ask you guys, beforehand.. :)\n\nA: You can use every HDD for time machine except the system HDD, but if you partition ate your system HDD you can use the new time machine for Time Machine.\nRemember: don0t format all your HDD when formatting, you will format even your backup!\n", "Q: Specify connection on launch for Microsoft Remote Desktop client I'd like to be able to connect to a specific remote desktop when I start Microsoft's RDT client.  I'm running the latest RDT 8.0.15 client on Yosemite.\nHow can I do that?\n\nA: You can do this by launching from an .rdp file:\n* Create the Desktop bookmark in the app\n* Export the Desktop as an .rdp file to e.g. your Mac Desktop\n* Double-click to start the app and connect to the Desktop.\nAFAIK, there's no way to configure the app to launch a desktop at start.\n\nA: I'm pretty sure you can no longer do that. It was possible on older versions but recent versions insist on you choosing from the list. \nYou used to be able to store 'bookmarks' & launch those directly. \n", "Q: Restore gmail messages to mail.app after TimeMachine restore I have a dozen different email accounts for different roles, all of which I interact with through mail.app.  I had a hard drive disaster, and restored from TimeMachine.  It did an impressive job of restoring my complex email structure for backed up email, and of course new emails coming in are fine.  But I am missing the month (urgh) of emails between the most recent backup and the restore.  They are still on gmail (some POP and some IMAP accounts).  How do I mark them as not already downloaded, so that they'll be retrieved from gmail?  \n\nA: For the mailbox in question, in the Mail.app, go to Mailbox (top menu), and then select Rebuild. You may need to relaunch the app for the older messages to be downloaded.\n", "Q: Does App Store Review Board allow marking an app free and charging prices some days later? Because of marketing considerations, I think it would be best if I mark my app as free for the first, say, few weeks, and charging a price for it after that period has gone up. I think I've seen this practice on the App Store before, but I just want to make sure. Does App Store allow this? Thanks.\n\nA: Yes. You can change your app from \"free\" to \"paid\" as you desire. Keep in mind users who downloaded the app for free will continue to get free updates even after you change the price (unless those come in the form of in-app purchases). \n", "Q: How to show/hide invisible files and folders from Service menu?

At this time, I also upgraded from 10.7 to 10.8.5 (I believe these are the correct versions, not completely sure).\nAfter this, I noticed that things began to get pretty bad:\n\n\n*\n\n*MBP would restart itself randomly.\n\n*MBP would freeze up when watching a video or other visually intensive things (such as using corners to switch between programs, or when maximizing a program, it would freeze right in the middle of the maximization, creating a weird looking warped window.)\n\n*When frozen visually, the audio would still work.\n\n*Occasionally, when frozen, if I held down the power button (playing chicken with it), and released it just before I expected it to shut down... suddenly the freeze would subside and MBP would come back to life.\n\n\nMore recently, sometimes when booting, I get on the grey startup screen a cascade of error log text (white font, black background).

If you can't run safe mode smoothly, it probably is a hardware (or hardware compatibility) problem.\n\n*Run AHT (Apple Hardware Test) by holding D on startup.

I'm reluctant to delete them in case they have some of my much sought after photos on them. Is there any way I can access the photos and save them to my computer? \n\nA: Yes. If on OS X, use Apple's Photos app and save the pictures locally. If on Windows, download iCloud for Windows. \n", "Q: How to disable moving a window by its edge adjacent to scroll bar? In Mac OS X Yosemite, I find that the scroll bar is a small target for the mouse, and sometimes when I wish to scroll, I end up moving the whole window by grabbing its edge to the right of the scroll bar.  This is never the behavior I desire.\nHow can I disable the ability to move a window by grabbing anything other than its title bar?\n\nA: I try scrolling with scroll bar because there is a scroll bar. Sometimes it's better than scrolling with mouse. (smooth scrolling)\nTo change, go to System Preferences: General settings -> Show scroll bars -> Always\n\nA: Apple says this is by design. No use trying to complain about it. See an example post in their forum:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7491958\n\"It's not a bug but a deliberate design feature that was introduced a few versions of OS X ago.\" This reply is from years ago, already, so they do not intend to fix it at least for a while it seems.\n", "Q: Updating iTunes Says It Will Change My Hard Drive When trying to update my computers with itunes version 11.4, a message says it will change my personal computer's hard drive. What will it change?\n\nA: This happens when a application (like iTunes) or other try to modify your hard drive and install files on it, but your settings are such to prevent that.\nIt is advisable to set that alert so to prevent applications installing without your explicit approval.\nThe settings are in the system preferences - Security & Privacy - general tab.\nHere you can set your choice what happens when a new Application tries to Install it self.\n\n\nA: I'm going to presume here that you are running a Windows PC with Windows 7 or later, based on the wording in your question (a little clarification would go a long way :) ).\nIn the latest versions of Windows (from Vista onwards), Microsoft introduced 'User Account Control', or UAC for short. This was to prevent malware and viruses from making unauthorised changes to your computer without your knowledge. Whenever you install an application or program on your computer, the screen will dim and a small window will pop up asking \"Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your PC?\" to verify that you want to authorise an application to be installed.\nThe iTunes installer pops up with this window because it needs to install specific program files in a restricted folder on your computer (C:\\Program Files or C:\\Program Files (x86) on 64-bit machines) as well as some programs that will run in the background to monitor if you have plugged in an iPad, iPod or iPhone. It won't make any changes to any personal files or any other installed programs on your machine. It is perfectly safe to click okay on this window and allow iTunes to install, so long as you downloaded the iTunes installer directly from Apple, or are using Apple's Software Update program!\nIf you downloaded the installer from another source, I would recommend clicking 'Cancel' and getting another copy of iTunes from Apple directly at http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/ (which will also provide you with the most up to date installer).\n", "Q: Parallels vs VMWare for Mac I use Parallels on my iMac and Macbook Pro.  It seems to run fine on my iMac but kind of causes my MBP to become a little sluggish and fans to get pegged.  I was speaking with someone that runs several VMWare VMs on their Macbook without any problems at all.  They mentioned my MBP should have more than enough resources to handle several VMs.\nDoes VMWare generally perform outstandingly better than Parallels on Macs?\nHere are my machine specs (both running OS X 10.10.3):\niMac\n3.2 Ghz Intel Core i5\n16GB DDR3 RAM\nNVIDIA GeForce GT 755M 1024 RAM\n500GB SSD w/25GB free space\nVM is allocated 2GB of RAM\nMacbook Pro\n2.7 Ghz Intel Core i7\n16GB DDR3 RAM\nIntel HD Graphics 4000 1024 RAM\n500GB SSD w/47GB free space\nVM is allocated 2GB of RAM\n\nA: Parallels on Mac has a better performance. It integrates with OS X in a way which is not possible with VMware. I am using parallels with multiple VMs without any problems or sluggishness. I have allocated 3 GB RAM to each VM. Check how many CPU cores you have allocated to your VM.\n\nA: I have run both VMWare & Parallels on 11\" MacBook Airs - and on my current 12\" MacBook.\n(with 2, 4, then 8gb). Then only performance problem I have had - which is ongoing - is when I switch to retina mode in the VM (on my 12\").\nThis is substantially slower - especially on Parallels - often locking up for 5-10 seconds. I don't know if this is a driver thing - or if retina displays just require a lot more horsepower which lower end macs (and even higher end laptops) just don't have.\nI may try a new high-end MacBook Pro to see if this fixes it.\n", "Q: Hide Xcode's toolbar in fullscreen mode How can I hide Xcode's toolbar in fullscreen mode (cmd + ctrl + f)? \n\nI tried to hide it and then go into fullscreen but it appeared immediately. Also I tried to hide it using right-click -> hide toolbar but that did not work:\n\nI just would like to have a clear screen with just code on it, w/o any useless toolbars.\nCan anyone help me?\n\nThanks in advance :)\n\nA: This is not possible. On full screen the toolbar is always visible.\nYou can hide it only if you are out of full screen mode. If you want to do it with a key combination, you have to assign a shortcut on Preferences → Key Bindings (see the image below).\n\n\nA: Try https://github.com/wczekalski/Distraction-Free-Xcode-plugin, it's a plugin in the making to provide a kind of Zen mode.\n\nA: If you create a custom Behaviour (XCode → Preferences... → Behaviours) with the action \"Hide toolbar\" and set a keyboard shortcut for it (press the ⌘ icon next to the name), triggering it will hide the toolbar even in fullscreen mode.\n\n", "Q: iMovie 10.0.7 How do I mark my \"favorite\" part of a video and move it into the timeline Under the old version you could make the part of the video clip you liked and it would show GREEN after you moved it into the the timeline. This version shows the make area in the menu, but does not work. The menu is light gray and there is no \"heart\" icon on the screen for the \"favorite\" part of the clip. What am I doing wrong?\nThanks for the help.\n\nA: You can still favorite sections of your clips in iMovie by selecting a portion of your clip in the library and hitting the \"F\" key. Your selection will be marked by a green bar, like before.\n", "Q: Photos App & faces sync I am using the new Photos App (Yosemite). Everything is synchronised (iCloud) but the faces.\nIs this a feature or a bug?\n\nA: Smart folders — including Faces — on the Mac are (for now) local only. Not only will Faces not sync with iPads or iPhones, they won't sync with other Macs either.\n", "Q: iPhone 5S broken screen root access without iTunes authorization I have an iPhone 5S with broken screen.\nI need to save my photos to my PC/Mac; I can't authorize iTunes cause of course the screen is broken and I don't have iCloud, so the only way should be a root access, does anyone knows how to?\n\nA: Software\niExplorer claims to grant you root access to iDevices without requiring a jailbreak:\n\nWith iExplorer, you can access more files and folders without modifying (jailbreaking) your device than ever before. Need to access photos on your iPhone or iPod? Can do. Want to access the files and folders of your device's apps? Done. How about browsing through your iTunes backups? Check. What about the media folders containing your iTunes purchases? We've got that too. What about files in apps that are synced to iCloud? Yes, even that.*\n\niBrowse is a simillar, free software by the same company, but it doesn't grant root access (which I'm not sure you need in order to access photos).\nThe \"Windows\" Method\nFrom an answer on Apple's support forums:\n\nI plugged the phone into my Windows Computer and when it recognizes the phone is plugged in, a dialogue box pops up that asks if you want to import pictures and videos. You click import and it will pull everything off the phone and place it in a folder with the date as the name and put it in your pictures or my pictures folder. From there you can access the photos & videos!!\n\nI'm not sure this works either, update in the comments so I can modify my answer.\nOld Guide\nI also found a guide, written in 2008, and doesn't involve any 3rd party software: (Not sure it still works)\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Connect your iPhone/iPod touch and launch Applications >Image Capture.\n  \n*Go to Preferences >General.\n  \n*Under Camera, select Image Capture in the “When a camera is connected, open:” option, and then click OK. Now when you connect your\n  iPhone/iPod touch, Image Capture will be launched and you can choose\n  where you want to download your images.\n\n\nA: Also had that issue, used linux to format, then used photorec on the empty \"disk\"\n", "Q: How do I remove an iMessage account from OS X (Yosemite) Messages app? I added my iMessage account to my work MacBook and now I want to remove the account, but Messages won't let me.\nI Signed Out of the account and deleted the message history, but now when I start messages it still prompts me to login with the account, and if I go to Preferences the account still appears (inactive) in the list and the Remove button (- sign at bottom) is greyed out.\nIs there any way to remove the existence of the account completely?\n\nA: OK, I figured it out but it's not straightforward. I figured it had to be stored in a .plist file somewhere, so I searched all the .plist files in ~/Library/Preferences for ones that contained the Apple ID I used for iMessages. These were the ones:\n\n\n*\n\n*com.apple.ids.service.com.apple.madrid.plist\n\n*com.apple.ids.service.com.apple.private.alloy.sms.plist\n\n*ByHost/com.apple.identityservices.idstatuscache.5A488A33-7FF1-56F5-A3F6-CBC792D5C705.plist\nWhen I searched for com.apple.ids.service.com.apple.madrid.plist on the web I found a link to a very useful answer on the Apple forums that also helped out.\nSo basically, this is what I did:\nDelete the .plist files I mentioned above (note, the last one with the UUID in the name is likely to be different for each user):\ncd ~/Library/Preferences\nrm com.apple.ids.service.com.apple.madrid.plist\nrm com.apple.ids.service.com.apple.private.alloy.sms.plist\nrm ByHost/com.apple.identityservices.idstatuscache.5A488A33-7FF1-56F5-A3F6-CBC792D5C705.plist\n\nThen I removed all the chat history and archive:\nrm ~/Library/Messages/chat.db*\nrm -rf ~/Library/Messages/Archive\nrm -rf ~/Library/Messages/Attachments\n\nThen I restarted the Mac just in case. Now the account and everything about it that ever existed on this machine is gone :)\n\nA: I think that in iMessage app you can't delete the iCloud account (except if you logout your mac from all iCloud), you can't just logout from iMessage preferences and erase the history...\n\nA: Click on the iMessage app, click on Preferences, go to Accounts click on one the boxes on the left side that holds your account to your email whether it's Google or Yahoo and un-enable the one you don't want to be enabled anymore.\n\nA: Click on the iMessage app, preferences, then details, sign in when asked, then once signed in click on 'Manage Apple ID', it'll prompt you to an apple website, sign in again, then remove the emails under the 'account' section. It worked for me. \nI then reopened the iMessage app on my laptop, after removing the emails I no longer wanted, and the accounts weren't on there anymore.\n\nA: *\n\n*Sign into iCloud.\n\n*Click on internet services.\n\n*Click on service you'd like to remove.\n\n*Click \"offline\".\n\n*Click on \"details\".\n\n*Remove login info.\n\n*Click on Minus (\"-\") at bottom left of page (be sure the account to be removed is highlighted).\n\n*You will be prompted \"Are you sure?\". Click \"Yes\".\n\n\nService will be removed from list and message usage can be continued.\n\nA: I got to Internet Accounts by clicking on the minus sign (where +/-) at the bottom of the list of accounts (get here via Messages>preferences).  This prompted me to the list of accounts but in an 'internet accounts' window, i clicked on the '-' sign again and was asked if I was sure I wanted to delete - I was, and it has!\n\nA: In the Preferences, sign out the account that you do not want to show up there anymore. Then change the pre-populated email with a random string and a random password. Sign in fails and now your original account is replaced with this one. Yes, you may have to follow mluisbrown's solution if you do not want any entry at all. But if you just want to not show an entry with your email id then this works.\n\nA: I was having the same problem (\"inactive\"), but just wanted to get the Messages.app to connect with my iPhone again (so I could send messages via Messages.app on my machine rather than from my phone -- mainly when texting on my phone would take too long / be too cumbersome). I was able to resolve the issue by turning off two-factor authentication via the iCloud website. \nBefore disabling two-factor auth, I was getting into a weird loop where iPhone would (1) prompt me to allow or disallow my machine access [I clicked \"Allow\"] and then (2) my iPhone would deliver a six-digit authentication code, but I had no place on my machine to enter that code; that is, my machine was not giving me a prompt box to input the access code being displayed by my iPhone.\nEventually, I thought, \"maybe if I just disable two-factor, I can get around this and sign into Messages.app again\" -- that worked.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open the iMessages app on your Mac\n\n*At the top of your screen you'll see several options, hover your mouse over Messages\n\n*Several options should popup and select the one that says Preferences\n\n*At the top of the popup select Accounts and then click Remove Account\n\n*Done\n\n", "Q: How to stop mouse from zooming in when trying to scroll down In trying to zoom down, the mouse has taken to zooming in his entire screen.

Time Machine famously has problems backing up to a network drive ...just the other day I got the dreaded message where TM wants to wipe my existing backup and start from scratch again :(\n(that's from TM on my laptop going to a 'Time Machine-enabled volume' on my Drobo 5N)  \nI have tried Carbon Copy Cloner and Superduper but they both had trouble even completing the initial backup - they don't seem to handle network hiccups well at all and just give up... the part that TM does ok with.\nMost advice seems to be to don't backup up to a network drive and use a locally attached disk instead, due to fundamental technical problems with sparsebundle files over network etc.\nBut I really need to backup to NAS... we have have two laptops at home for a start, I can't plug them both into the backup drive at the same time so there'd be no way for backups to run automatically.\nIt's a bit odd then that Apple TimeCapsule offers network backups - does it suffer same problem?  I'd buy one if it works reliably, though I don't like that it's only single disk and no RAID.\nThen I saw that OSX Server also offers Time Machine backup over the network to clients. Does this work any more reliably than the desktop TM -> NAS drive scenario?  I'd consider getting a Mini and locally attached disk if I could be sure that would work.\n\nA: When two or more client access the TM service at the same time then a corruption can happen. TimeMachine on a TimeCapsule will create a lock when a backup takes places allowing only one backup being active at any time. Most third party implementations will not mark the TM as unavailable when another backup already is running. \nI have seen sparse bundle corruptions with a Qnap NAS. The advice (on the qnap) forums is to use one client only per NAS. Since I follow this advice (one mac will backup to my old TimeCapsule, the other mac backup to a TimeMachine service on the NAS) I had no more corrupted sparse bundles.\nEdit: \nHere is the post in the QNAP forum although the poster does not go into much details.  \n", "Q: Mail attachment quarantined on iphone I am having trouble with an email attachment that I received. I use an icloud email account and am accessing it from the Mail app on my iPhone. The attachment is a PDF file but when I try to open it, the file only contains this message:\n\"Trend Micro Antivirus has quarantined the previously attached file, if this is a genuine file please contact Consortium Group to have it unblocked.\"\nI do not have any sort of antivirus protection on my phone or on any of my devices. It would seem odd to me if the sender's antivirus would quarantine an outgoing message. So I am struggling to work out where the message was quarantined.\nThe attachment has also been renamed to:\n\"TREND_MICRO_ANTIVIRUS_QUARANTINED_ATTACHMENT.TXT\"\nI don't really want to ask the sender to resend the email because this is rather important and I don't want to seem incompetent and cause a hassle. So that would be a last resort but I may end up with the same result...\nI don't know who Consortium Group are or how to contact them. Do they actually have the pre-quarantined attachment that I am after or do they just modify their filters to allow it to be resent correctly?\nAny ideas on how to retrieve the attachment? Any clue as to at what stage and why it was quarantined?\n\nA: This has nothing to do with your iPhone, or your competence. You received a txt document, in place of the original document, so the original was never sent to you, or rather, it was restricted, by a security tool, from leaving the originators network. \nThis is very likely a Data Loss Prevention tool (possibly from Trend Micro) that sits on the originator's network, that is preventing the emailing of this document. These tools 'sniff' the contents of an email and attachment, and if they find strings similar to things like social security numbers, membership numbers, or other sensitive corporate data, they will remove the attachment and not allow it to be sent. They also can be set more generically, like not allowing any Excel document to be sent.\nYou will need to contact the originator, and explain that a security tool on their network is removing the attachment. They will need to ensure that the attachment meets their company's security standards before the system will allow it to be sent.\n", "Q: Is there a command similar to Linux's command-not-found? Most Linux operating systems have a package like command-not-found (http://packages.ubuntu.com/utopic/command-not-found), which provides suggestions when a shell command was not found, e.g. because the command was misspelt.\n➜ puthon\nNo command 'puthon' found, did you mean:\n Command 'python' from package 'python-minimal' (main)\n Command 'python' from package 'python3' (main)\n\nIs there similar functionality for OS X, e.g. through Homebrew?\n\nA: I created Homebrew-command-not-found just for that. It works exactly as you would expect, and supports 5000+ Homebrew formulae. it works with Bash, Zsh, and Fish.\nIt’s currently limited to correct spellings, e.g.:\n$ ghc\nThe program 'ghc' is currently not installed.

Personally, I use zsh and prezto, which results in this:\n\nIt's nice because the command is red while typing if it's not a valid program name, which means I usually catch the typo before I even press enter. Valid command names are green, though, so I know when I've typed it right.\nzsh can be installed via homebrew, and then adding something like prezto on top of that is easy (it's just a git clone ..., ln -s ..., and chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh).\n", "Q: Can I back up to an SD card?

I want to clean my hard drive to open up some operating space\n\nA: I'd personally recommend using a tool like DaisyDisk to get a clear indication of what files are taking up the most space. \n\nAfter that you could also run a tool like CleanMyMac (paid) or MacClean (free) to help you delete more hidden files like browser caches and language files. \n\nA: Download the app called Disk Inventory X. It will map out your entire drive and you can easily visualize what's taking up the most space. Also, the app is free!\nHere's a screenshot:\n\n", "Q: How can I view the original (or \"master\") version of a photo in Photos without reverting all edits? Most photo applications provides some way to toggle between the original (unedited) version of a photo and the current (edited) one.  \nIn Aperture, \"M\" toggles between the two, many iOS photo apps let you touch the screen to compare the edited or filtered version to the original, etc.\nI can't find any way to show the original in the new Photos app other than \"reverting,\" which removes all the edits.\nI don't want to remove them, I just want to compare the two.  \nI realize that I can \"revert\" then undo, but it's hacky, slow, and worse, dangerous - counting on undo to preserve work in any app is iffy, at best.\nNote: The fact that Aperture edits are saved \"less destructively\" than Photos shouldn't be relevant here.  Both applications DO retain the original, in edition to the edited version.\n\nA: While in Edit mode, hold down the Control and M keys.\nThis will show you the original version of your photo, with no edits applied. If you want to temporarily undo the effect of the color adjustments but keep the cropping and rotation the same, hold down M by itself.\nUnlike Aperture:\n\n\n*\n\n*It doesn’t work in “view mode”; you have to be in edit mode. (To get into edit mode via the keyboard, press Return.)\n\n*It’s a hold, not a toggle, so you only see the original photo for as long as you have the keys held down.\n\n\nA: For now you could toggle between CMD + Z and Revert to Original from the Image menu. \nAdditionally you can make the process faster by adding a keyboard shortcut:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts and then select App Shortcuts\n\n*Click the + and select Photos from the app list\n\n*Type 'Revert to Original' in the menu title field and choose a keyboard shortcut. I used CMD + Y.\n\n\nNow you can flick back and forth by pressing CMD + Y and CMD + Z\n\nA: Why not duplicate the photo (by right clicking) and then edit one of them. Now, clicking the right and left arrow will compare the original and your edits. You could delete the original when you're done, since it's still available by reverting the edits on the other image.\n\nA: I think you need to export them =(\n", "Q: Vertical green stripes when iMac starts to boot up An iMac has 5 green vertical bars/stripes that appear on the screen as soon the system starts booting.  The OS is Yosemite (10.10.?)  When I try to boot the computer normally, safe boot, or diagnostics the computer gets just beyond the Apple logo with progress bar and then restarts itself.  I can successfully boot into Single User Mode without the green bars appearing.\nMy first question is do you know of a fix/reason for the green vertical bars?\nSecond question:  Do you know of a way to create a backup of the drive or “Macintosh HD” volume while in Single User Mode?  It would be nice if the backup was bootable but not necessary.  I tried “asr” command but it had issues (“could not initialize Disk Arbitration…”) in single user mode.  Can some services be started so that “asr” works?\nThank you for any help\n\nA: Vertical bars/strips are usually indicative of a display malfunction. If you are also having booting problems, it is more likely GPU failure. You should take the iMac to Apple soon as it likely requires servicing.\nTo backup your iMac, connect an empty hard drive with enough storage to back up your iMac, then go to System Preferences > Time Machine. Turn Time Machine on, and select the disk you just connected. Allow your Mac to backup before taking it to Apple.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro: Why do colors vary on my macbook pro I recently noticed that the color blue looks kind of ultraviolet on my brand new Macbook Pro, I noticed that from the facebook header it's not really blue, it looks ultraviolet, is it because the screen is IPS screen? is that normal?\n\nA: Yes, that is completely normal. All monitors / displays fade over time and even vary out-of-the-box. All you need to do is color calibrate your monitor. If you are just using this for everyday use then go to system preferences. If you are using this for something like photography or printing then it is valuable to accurately profile your monitor with hardware calibration. \nSystem Preferences > Displays > Color > Calibrate. \n", "Q: Java update via Control Panel error Was trying to run the Java update earlier.

I've got a 2010 MacBook (MacBook7,1) with 8GB RAM running Mavericks 10.9. I recently replaced the stock HDD with a Samsung 850 EVO 250GB SSD and restored from a Time Machine backup. Though Disk Speed Test reports performance going from ~50MB/sec to ~250MB/sec (what you'd expect for the SATA II interface), I can hardly tell the difference in performance or even battery time.\nFor comparison, when I did an SSD upgrade for my OS drive on my MacPro3,1 it was honestly night-and-day; I figured that I should see the same with the MacBook. Unfortunately, boot times are only slightly improved and general performance of doing things seems hardly any better. For example, launching (say) Calendar.app on the Mac Pro went from several bounces on the dock to 1. I'd honestly say that the MacBook is bouncing the same number of times as are other applications.\nI do realize that the MacBook7,1 is a less powerful machine than the MacPro3,1 but honestly I am really surprised how little performance difference there is. Any thoughts on what I could check or has anyone else observed the same/different with their MacBook?\nFWIW, I am still on Mavericks due to smart card handling changes in Yosemite that prevent me from using the laptop for remote working with the office (Citrix hasn't patched it yet). As well, I HAVE installed Trim Enabler and did make sure the patch was activated.\n\nA: I had the same issue with the Samsung SSD. The main issue appeared to be with spotlight indexing. After installing the SSD the drive would not index. If you click on the spotlight search does it show indexing with a progress bar and estimated time with no estimate? If so this answer will help fix your issue. I tried several fixes before I solved the issue. \nTo turn off indexing you can do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*open the terminal app\n\n*type sudo mdutil -Ea -i off\nThis should help with performance issue if indexing is the cause.

I have never used a macbook pro other than to surf the internet. We recently went through a brake up and due to me purchasing the macbook originally we agreed i could take this, She was not happy that i took the MBP however it is by rights mine and therefore had no grounds to keep this from me. However to be as bitter as possible she decided to block me from using the icloud and itunes account and because my knowledge with MBP is very restricted i have no idea what i am doing to reinstall everything fresh.\nI went into Disk utils and formatted the Macintosh HD however when i try to reinstall Yosemite from the Recovery Partition it asks for her Login ID and that i no longer have as she changed the password.\nIs it possible to totally delete everything from the SSD including recovery partion and either install windows 8.1 pro i bought on disk as i have put this onto USB now, Or could i reinstall Mac OS X again fresh.\nTo do this i need to format the recovery partition so it removes her Apple ID, She was the most advanced out of us both with mac's and was her who persuaded me to purchase this.\nI just want my beloved computer back to normality, i much prefer windows and if possible i would like to 100% Totally format the SSD Clean and start a windows installation from scratch so she can not cause me any more hassle.\nShe told me she would block my MBP with find my mac if i try and login with her apple id, There is no reason for her to be so evil and i want her ID removed totally and any files she has on my laptop.\nI really am no good with macs however i understand how to follow instructions and would be extremely grateful for any help and advice given, She lives in the same State as me and use to go to the same university as me so i copied her university files onto USB and give her these but she still wants to be evil.\n\nA: I have been researching the topic for a while, and with success, I have created a bootable USB. If you still have any access to the mac, you should be able to do the same thing I did. Open the App Store, then click \"Store\" in the menu. click on the button that says sign out. \nPress sign in, then create a new Apple ID (it's free. say you don't have any payment info.) you will get a confirmation email. confirm your email, then proceed to the App Store and sign in. go to the following page https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-yosemite/id915041082?mt=12 \nWhile this is downloading, open a tab in safari and download the following assistant from Disk Maker. https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/118949/downloads/DiskMakerX4b4.dmg\nFind a USB stick (that is or is over 8GB) that you don't mind formatting, then wait for Yosemite to finish downloading. When it is done, open DiskMakerX4b4.dmg and open the App inside. It should ask you what disk you want to install the OS X installer to. Find the drive, then click choose. This will launch the installer, then put a recovery HD onto a USB. It will not ask for your ex's password. This may take up to (but not limited to) an hour. \nWhen your computer is done this process, shut it down, then use the following key: option then click on the drive that says \"Install OS X Yosemite\"\nOnce your mac has booted onto the drive, click the Disk Utility, then go to Partition. Click 1 partition, then name it Macintosh HD. Press apply or create. (it will be under the naming of the Partition)\nGo back to the main menu, then click reinstall OS X.

This will download and install the version of the operating system that shipped with the unit (likely Mavericks) and you can upgrade from there. Since this is using a factory-provided image and not the App Store upgrade, the account is not tied to it and the install will proceed without asking you for credentials.\nFor Find My Mac, your ex will have to remove the computer from her account. Otherwise the potential for her to lock it still exists.\nWindows can also only be installed via Bootcamp or other (unsupported) methods, so you will generally have to have a copy of OSX on the computer no matter what. However, it does not need to be the primary OS you boot into nor the holder of all of the disk space.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: iPad Air 2 Won't Take Screenshots Screenshot no longer works on my iPad Air 2. Tried turning on/off, resetting, resetting settings, rebooting. Both the home button and power button work individually and my iPad used to take screenshots. How can get my iPad to take screenshots again.\n\nA: The screenshot happens when both of the buttons are released at the same time, so if you can slow down your movements and hold down the buttons for a short \"two count\" or long \"one count\" - basically a second and a half, then release both precisely.\nIf that doesn't work, you either have full storage or a problem with the system being able to process the button release events in a timely manner.\nTo troubleshoot that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put the device in AirPlane mode and power it off.\n\n*Power on the device and don't connect to any networks.\n\n*Open Storage and make sure you have 1 GB free or more.\n\n*Delete apps, connect to iTunes and make a backup if you have nothing you can afford to delete long term.\n\n*Once you have enough space free - try taking a screen shot in AirPlane mode.\n\n*If that still fails - erase all content and settings on the device (or restore it over USB from iTunes or similar tool.\n\n*If the screen shot still doesn't work after deleting all your content or restoring - seek service - there's something wrong with the hardware.\n\n\nDepending on how much you deleted - restore your backup to the repaired / replaced / restored iPad. \n\nA: Since both buttons work individually, of course it has to be a software issue.Backing up your iPad with iTunes and then restoring the backup with iTunes is a great place to start when dealing with persistent iOS issues (click the links for help, as the link to Apple Support articles).\n\nA: My iPad 2 seemed to stop performing screen shots after 10.0.1 spoftware update. Tried all remedies suggested, even resetting. To no avail. Then whilst trying again to take screenshot found the solution. It now takes different actions to do screenshot. Now I have to press both buttons simultaneously, then release power button, screen goes blank and then clicks giving a screenshot. Prior to this I just pressed home button first then pressed power button like you would a camera shutter button. Prefer the previous action, seems more natural.\n", "Q: Completely Destroyed iPhone 6 Just today, my iPhone 6 was left on the top of my friends car and I forgot to take it down. So when we drove, it flew off the top and got destroyed by another car. When I went to go pick it up, the entire screen came off and the entire body of my phone is destroyed. It hasn't yet been a year since I bought the iPhone with AT&T. Do you think I can get a replacement for the phone? any warranty benefits? Again, my phone is completely destroyed but the SIM AND BATTERY are perfectly fine. What should i do?\n\nA: Warranty from Apple doesn't cover accidental damage.\nIf you have insurance from the carrier or AppleCare plus, they will pay some or all the costs to repair it.\nPut the pieces in a ziplock bag and call Apple or visit a retail store to get a quote for replacement in writing so you can provide that to the carrier and/or insurance company. Depending on how badly you need a replacement, you might pay for Apple's repair and check coverage later.\nBest of luck and have a look at cases like life proof and otter box that might help in bad situations if you decide not to insure the replacement.\n\nA: $199 will get you a new iPhone 6 when you take it in to the Apple Store. So that's your worst-case scenario. Been there, done that (atop the car and all; I also washed mine on a different occasion.) Every time you pay the $199, you learn another way to be careful with your phone.

I replaced the optical drive in a 15\" Macbook Pro (late 2011) with a new 2TB Samsung HDD in a caddy tray. It formatted fine and Disk Utility says it's OK.\nThe problem occurs when I try to copy a large set of files to the drive. It starts out alright, copies a few GB. Then it spontaneously unmounts in the middle of the copy and throws a Disk not ejected properly error.\nIf I open Disk Utility afterwards, it doesn't even see the drive. Restarting the computer doesn't bring it back. But if I shut down and then start up, it comes back on just fine.\nNormally I would assume it's just a faulty drive, but the exotic nature of the optical drive caddy makes me suspicious.\nHas anyone encountered this sort of problem? What is the likely cause? Any suggestions for troubleshooting prior to returning the drive? Thanks!\n\nA: I found out that this particular model (late 2011 Macbook Pro) has an issue with the optical drive SATA: It can only operate reliably in 3Gb/s mode, but reports that it supports 6Gb.\nThe drive I was using supported both speeds, and is supposed to automatically switch to 3Gb when necessary. But because the bus reports that it's compatible with 6Gb, it stays in 6Gb mode. This works fine most of the time as the actual transfer speed doesn't exceed 3Gb. But when it does, the bus misbehaves and all sorts of problems occur.\nAfter much frustration (and several different drives) I settled on putting a 3Gb (not 6/3) drive in that bay instead. Works great now.

17.1\n\n========\nI have a 3 week old mid-2014 15\" retina MacBook Pro (integrated graphics only) that experiences constant freezes and crashes that first start when browsing the web (such as when watching a YouTube video) and soon propagates to all the other system apps. Eventually, given enough crashes, the system fails to boot.\nOnly a full format, followed by a PRAM reset, allows me to reinstall OS X and get back to work.\nAdditional info: MBP initially shipped with Yosemite. I formatted the SSD and installed Mavericks--too many bugs in Yosemite.\nAlso, problem seems to only occur when an external display is plugged-in (in my case a Dell U2713HM).\nAHT shows all hardware to be 'normal.' DriveDx does not show anything alarming with the SSD (minus the fact that I'm wracking up forced shutdown errors from all the hard resets).\nEtreCheck log attached. Can't seem to find any kernel panics in console, but maybe someone can help me dig deeper.\nThank you so much for the help! I really appreciate it!\n\nA: Thanks for the Console log.\nWhat I see is:\nYou use Firefox with some plugins that create problems.\nStep one Disable Firefox add-ons and test without them. To do that click all the way to the right in Firefox menu bar, open the add-ons and disable them. If it works, enable plug ins one o´by one to check. Check your Firefox update to ver. 3702.\nAlso you need to repair your Fonts. Open the Font Book in the Applications and use Restore Standard Fonts.\n", "Q: Re-sync messages between iPhone and computer after period of not syncing them? I have recently re-setup the message app on my iPhone to sync with the messages app on my MacBook. New messages are now appearing in both places, however messages that had occurred before syncing these two devices do not appear on my mac. Is there a way to have my pre-sync conversations to appear in Messages on my mac?\n\nA: No. Only iMessages sent from the time you set up Messages on your Mac can be received.\nNote that you are not actually syncing between Messages on iPhone and Messages on Mac - you are adding a new device to receive a copy of each message sent. When you register a device for iMessage, a set of keys (a public key and a private key) are created. The public key is sent to Apple, while the private key remains private and known only to your device. When someone wants to send you a message, their app contacts Apple and requests your public key(s). If you have four devices registered, they will receive four public keys.\nAt that point, their device encrypts the message once for each public key. Only your private key for a particular device can open the encrypted messages intended for that device. So if (by some technical problem) the copy of the message intended for your iPhone was sent to your Mac by mistake, it won't be able to be opened, even though it's for you and was encrypted with your public key.\nHopefully this makes it clear why messages sent prior to registering your MacBook with iMessage cannot be retrieved - simply put, they don't exist in a form that can be read by your MacBook. Even if Apple kept a copy of the messages at the time they were sent (which they for up to seven days, or until the message is received by the intended device, whichever comes first), only your iPhone can decrypt them.\nThis page has a good overview of iMessage encryption (which goes into more detail on what I've outlined above).\n", "Q: Photos back to iPhoto? Is there a way to get iPhoto back after installing Photos? When I upgraded to Yosemite 10.10.3, it installed Photos. I am not really liking the format or the design.\n\nA: iPhoto is a separate application from Photos (though if you had iPhoto on your dock, the 10.10.3 upgrade replaced its icon with Photos). You can still run it by using Spotlight or going to your Applications folder.\nWhen you do run it, it may ask if you actually meant to open it, or if you meant to open Photos - choose the option to continue opening iPhoto. Your iPhoto library is still there and has not been removed. Keep in mind any changes made to your iPhoto library will not be reflected in Photos, so if you decide later that you do want to use Photos, you will need to create a new library in Photos to convert your iPhoto library at that time.\n\nA: If you open Spotlight and search for iPhoto, you should be able to still open it. Apple has discontinued development on it, however, and you could theoretically run into problems down the road if you keep using it. Apple probably won't ever straight up delete the application from your harddrive, but if you ever reformat, an OS X reinstall of 10.10.3 or later will not include iPhoto, but just the Photos app.\n\nA: My solution is in the last paragraph, I wrote the other paragraphs because I believe  the things I tried could work for others. \nIm not an Apple snob or have 500 hits - just a person who buys thousands of dollars of Apple products. Im just a mom who loved iPhoto because I could easily rate pictures, create albums and drag and drop between albums. I recently purchased the 2015 Macbook just to have more memory for all the kids Apple Photobooks.\nMy shiny new space gray Macbook came with iPhoto..... until I chose the \"System Update.\" All of a sudden iPhoto had a cross out sign and \"Photos\" showed up in the dock. So, naturally, I reset the mac back to factory settings. This may work for you.  Well guess what, iPhoto was now completely gone! iPhoto was not not in my spotlight or apps folder. So frustrating. Then I tried a new idea from forums - I went to the App store and planned to pay any amount of money for  iPhoto.  iPhoto was not in the app store - as some of the gurus below stated, I should get used to it as Apple aint going back. Well, I tried had tried Pages and Appeture with the \"get use to it\" attitude so I didn't give up since Apple finally realized that those apps were subpar. BTW every time I type \"iphoto\" it self corrects to \"iPhoto.\" Whatever.\nI was this close to returning this new Macbook for another new Macbook just to get iPhoto back...and promised myself never, never, never update again. \nThen I tried one last theory... I went to my former application purchases. See photo below. It is where you purchased WWF and Kindle. And there I found that I had purchased iPhoto back in 2011! I then clicked install and wha la - iPhoto is back! Yay! Photo stream - something I hated, I welcomed back with open arms of unconditional love. \n", "Q: I can't shrink my OS X Yosemite partition I recently reformatted my machine and am trying to shrink my OS X partiton to make room for a linux partition, following instructions at http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-linux-macbook-pro/ . I am at the Resize Partitions step, and when I opened up Disk Utility, there was no way for me to drag the existing partition to shrink its size and create free space.\nWhen looking at the GUI, the normal resize handle is missing, and the help text sounds much more restrictive than it has in the past.\n\n\nA: Essentially you have a CoreStorage Volume Group instead of an old-style partition scheme. You shouldn't use Disk Utility to modify the CSVG.\nTo shrink your CoreStorage Volume Group to get some unallocated space to install Linux or EFI-Windows just use an undocumented diskutil command:\ndiskutil cs resizeStack LVUUID size\n\nThe command expands or shrinks the whole CoreStorage Volume Group including the physical volume(s), the logical volume family and the logical volume in one step to the desired size.\nBeware: The command is vastly undocumented and as such potentially destructive.\nPreparation: \n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your data.\n\n*Detach any external drive (especially your external Time Machine backup drive).\n\n*Restart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing alt cmd R at startup.\nThe prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.\nOn a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot to a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an apple/akamai server.\nI recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.\nAlternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (Mavericks or Yosemite) or a thumb drive containing a full system (Mavericks or Yosemite). The disk identifiers may differ then. So check the human readable names and sizes and change the commands below accordingly.\nGet an overview:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open in the menubar Utilities/Terminal\nFirst you should get an overview of your disks and the partition layout:\n\n*Enter diskutil list\nExample listing (but I took the list provided by you in your question and included the netboot device):\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *250.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            249.1 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.1 MB   disk0s3\n\n/dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     Apple_partition_scheme                         *1.3 GB    disk1\n   1:        Apple_partition_map                         30.7 KB    disk1s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS OS X Base System        *1.3 GB    disk1s2\n/dev/disk2\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           *249.1 GB   disk2\n\n/dev/disk3-disk13 ...belong to the OS X Base System (your recovery system you booted to previously)\n\nDisk0 is your main internal disk device (SSD) containing an EFI-partition (dis0s1), one CoreStorage partition (disk0s2) and Boot OS X (disk0s3). \nDisk1 is a logical disk created by booting to the netboot image which contains a recovery system (OS X Base System = disk1s2) similar to the Recovery HD. \nDisk2 is also a logical disk residing in disk0s2 and it contains the CoreStorage stack.\n\n*Enter diskutil cs list\nExample listing:\nCoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found)\n|\n+-- Logical Volume Group 57932797-4AC8-4475-9836-82394CEBF536\n    =========================================================\n    Name:         LogicalVolumeGroup\n    Status:       Online\n    Size:         249150200320 B (249.1 GB)\n    Free Space:   353689600 B (353.7 MB)\n    |\n    +-< Physical Volume 68F90B2B-4004-4044-AFFB-9D3854006D2A\n    |   ----------------------------------------------------\n    |   Index:    0\n    |   Disk:     disk0s2\n    |   Status:   Online\n    |   Size:     249183200320 B (249.1 GB)\n    |\n    +-> Logical Volume Family 9B947A52-7496-46CA-BFA5-A87DD47249FE\n        ----------------------------------------------------------\n        Encryption Status:       Unlocked\n        Encryption Type:         None\n        Conversion Status:       NoConversion\n        Conversion Direction:    -none-\n        Has Encrypted Extents:   No\n        Fully Secure:            No\n        Passphrase Required:     No\n        |\n        +-> Logical Volume 86417B41-6400-4F81-8F7C-43AA243CDAEE\n            ---------------------------------------------------\n            Disk:                  disk2\n            Status:                Online\n            Size (Total):          249001915136 B (249.0 GB)\n            Conversion Progress:   -none-\n            Revertible:            No\n            LV Name:               Macintosh HD\n            Volume Name:           Macintosh HD\n            Content Hint:          Apple_HFS\n\nModify CoreStorage stack:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resize the CoreStorage volume with  \ndiskutil cs resizeStack LVUUID size \n\nwith LVUUID: UUID of the logical volume and size: the final size of your CoreStorage volume.    \nExamples:  \ndiskutil cs resizeStack 86417B41-6400-4F81-8F7C-43AA243CDAEE 200g  \n\nto shrink it to 200 GB  \ndiskutil cs resizeStack 86417B41-6400-4F81-8F7C-43AA243CDAEE 100000m  \n\nto shrink it to 100,000 MB (=100 GB)\ndiskutil cs resizeStack 86417B41-6400-4F81-8F7C-43AA243CDAEE 0g \n\nto expand it to the full available size (0g is a magic number here).  \nYour Recovery HD should be moved automatically - regardless of whether shrinking or expanding the CS volume - to the very end of it (right after the CoreStorage volume).\n\n*Enter exit and quit Terminal.\n\n*Open Disk Utility and check your shrinked CoreStorage volume for errors.\n\n*Quit Disk Utility.\n\n*Reboot to your main volume.\n\n*Now you have ~(250 GB - size) GB of unallocated space and may install Linux.\n\n\nP.S.

Quit Disk Utility.\n\n*Open Restore From Time Machine Backup and restore your data.\n\nA: The steps you linked skip a crucial point - you have to actually create a second partition. I think it's assuming you already have a second partition that you want to format for installing Linux.\nIn Disk Utility:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the hard drive on the left. Note that each drive has (at least) two lines: an identifier, such as \"251 GB APPLE SSD SD02...\", and a partition name which is Macintosh HD by default. Click on the drive identifier, not the partition name, in order to be able to partition the drive.\n\n*Click the Partition tab on the right side.\n\n*Click the + at the bottom of the partition list. (Screenshot 1 below)\n\n*Click on the new partition and enter a name. (Screenshot 2, #1 on image)\n\n*Choose the size of the new partition either by dragging the divider between the two, or by entering a size in the Size box. (Screenshot 2, #2 on image) Note that the purple shaded area in your original partition is used space, so that partition cannot be made any smaller than that.\n\n*Click Apply to make changes.\n\n\n\nA: There is a very simple reason for the lack of a resize handle on your current drive. Notice, in your screen shot, that in the left hand pane you have a disk labelled \"Macintosh HD\" which also has a volume labelled \"Macintosh HD\". With the disk highlighted, look at the bottom of the window and you can see that the disk is of the type \"Logical Volume Group\".\nNow, if we look at @tubedogg's screenshots, in the left hand pane we can see the serial and make of his hard drive (a 1TB Western Digital HDD) which has a volume labelled \"Ted\" (I'm going off the top-most drive here). The bottom of the window tells us that the drive is an independent drive connected internally via SATA. Perhaps you can already see where I am going with this?\n@qmlowery, it seems that you have a Fusion drive, and not a typical HDD layout, am I correct? If not, you say that you recently reformatted, so I'm guessing you created a Core Storage volume on your disk. These act differently to regularly connected drives. Imagine, if you will, that there was a resize handle for your Fusion Drive. You drag the handle to create 20GB of free space (in which you could put another partition or something). Where is that 20GB of free space located? On the 32GB of Solid State storage? Or on the remaining space which is conventional storage?\nFor this reason, resizing is not available on a logical volume group. OS X wouldn't know where to cut out the free space. In order to install your linux partition, you will need to ignore the steps that tell you to resize the partition, and instead just create a partition of the specified size using the \"+\" button.\nHope this clarifies things for you and helps you out. :)\nSource: My time fixing custom Fusion Drives at an AASP. :P\nEDIT: There's a lovely in-depth article on CoreStorage here.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro screen freaks out, goes psychedelic — I'm at a loss — suggestions? Been using and taking care of Macs since 1985, and I've never seen this before. Can't find anything online. Anyone? Graphics card going south?\nReboot fixed the problem, but it returned 2x the next day.\nHave zapped the PRAM, waiting to see if that helps.\n\n\nA: Chances are, it's hardware.\nDownload and burn a copy of Ultimate Boot CD  Insert the disk and boot your Mac by holding down the \"C\" key.  It's a Linux OS and will boot up in text mode (not graphics intensive)\nThere are a number of video related tests you can run.  Since it is outside of OS X,  you are removing the OS from the equation.\nChances are, you are going to run across something hardware wise.  \nIf you don't get errors reported back, it may be a connector or the display itself.  If you have an external monitor, hook that up and see if the problem manifests there.  If it dosen't, then you know it is something between the logic board and display. \nIf you do see errors, then you know for a fact it's your chip.\nDon't dispair.  I have used a service that will replace graphic chips on Apple logic boards and they have been quite reliable.  I can give you the name privately, if you like.  The cost was (give or take) about $100 including shipping.\nI have personally used the above techniques and vendor with zero failures thus far.  \nI hope this helps.\n\nA: Try booting it into Recovery and see if the problem persists there too. If it doesn't, you'll want to reinstall OS X from there. Be sure to back up all of your data before reinstalling as it will wipe the disk.\n\nA: I reset the NVRAM on my Mac (aka \"zapped the PRAM\") and so far it seems to have resolved the problem.\nThis is a simple procedure of restarting the Mac, and holding down the Command, Option, P and R keys once you hear the startup sound. You hold them until the Mac reboots again, then release them. This clears hardware settings that are stored in non-volatile RAM (NVRAM), resetting them to the system defaults.\n", "Q: Apple Mail generating Mail[378]: No worthy mechs found. What is it?

I use Time Machine as a backup, and hoped that it would backup these log files too, but have now discovered that they are not included (tmutil confirms that the individual files are excluded).  There are thousands of log files (one per day, for each of 10 virtual hosts) and at least 10 are generated each new day, so manually including a rule for each is not possible.  Is there a way to tell Time Machine to include the whole of /var/log/apache2 and its sub-directories (the TM Preference Pane makes it easy to exclude folders, but I don't see  a way of telling it to include folders)?\nI'm running Mac OS X 10.10 on a recent Mac Mini and using the MacPorts version of Apache, but I doubt that my question is specific to this hardware/software.\n\nA: Time Machine is designed around ease of use, rather than utility. It does not backup everything on the hard drive, typically not including files that are not necessary to recover from a failure. Log files seem to fit this category.\nThe first option is to see if you can remove the exclusion using tmutil, which is the commandline version of Time Machine.\n\ntmutil removeexclusion \"/var/log/apache2\"\n\nTypically, this command is used for exclusions the user has created, but its worth a try.\nThe other option is to use something like chron and bash (or Automator) to simply compress the log files into an archive (zip file) and place the archive in your documents folder. I would suggest that you perhaps name your archive file with the date, so Time Machine does not assume they are duplicate or simply newer versions of the same file.\n", "Q: Screen Sharing not working for non-admin local accounts on Yosemite Server Question says it all.

We've got an application that we're overhauling and putting a new skin on.  Marketing within our company has made the decision to cut ties with the previous application and try to market this new application instead.  Because of this, we have to delete the current application on iTunes Connect.  This I can do.  What is being asked is what kinds of ramifications are there to deleting the application?  What will happen on a customer's device that has already downloaded the app?  Obviously, if they never connect to the internet, it can continue to work as before.  But does Apple do anything special when a cert is canceled or removed or an application is deleted?  Do they wipe away the application if you try and sync the device to iTunes?\n\nA: No matter if you delete it on your developer account, the users will continue with that app until they will update or delete it. No more options here.\n\nA: When an user buy an app he become the copy owner so he own his copy on his device and ipa on iTunes and he can continue using and installing it forever as he want.\nHe simply stop receiving updates.\n", "Q: Sometimes Mail.app doesn't automatically apply rules, although all rules are active I have a pack of rules, which are intended for automatically marking as read & deleting messages when some criteria is met.

I think it happens more when I pull out the card up to 5 minutes after I copied something.\nIs this a cache problem? What's the course of action to find the root of this?\n\nA: It sounds like that SD card has a faulty controller chip. From your description, I'm guessing that you bought it second-hand through ebay, so you might have been \"burned\" there.\nSomething you can try is to open Disk Utility, choose the SD card, and then click Verify Disk.\nSomething else you can try (crossing fingers) is to reformat the SD card and hope for the best. However, if the SD card is acting flakey, then it might be best to scrap it for a new one.\nQuestion: In Disk Utility, select the SD card and choose Info.

F4U085) and I have a question to ask. The dock is attached to a Macbook Pro and everything works fine (audio, ethernet, USB devices etc). However, I cannot connect dual displays to it. My dual monitor setup is as follows: I want to attach one monitor via the HDMI port on the dock and the other via the thunderbolt port on the dock, using a MiniDP to HDMI adapter + HDMI to DVI cable to the external monitor. When I tried the setup, one of the monitors (the one connected to the HDMI port) has no output to it. If i connect it to the HDMI port on the macbook, it shows the output.\nAccording to the official product guide, it says:\nYes.  For dual display, at least one (1) display has to be Thunderbolt or Thunderbolt 2 technology.  For displays that are not Thunderbolt technology ready, Thunderbolt port is backwards compatible with Mini DisplayPort and dock supports either HDMI or Mini DisplayPort but not both.\nHow can I connect dual displays to the dock ? I find this somewhat unexplained. Do I need to use an actual thunderbolt cable for one of the monitors , not an adapter?  If I buy a thunderbolt cable and a thunderbolt enabled monitor, will I be able to use the HDMI port on the dock for the second monitor ? Or the only possible dual-display scenario is with thunderbolt daisy-chaining? Has anyone had any experience with this issue?\n\nA: The reason why the dual setup isn't working is that you are using MiniDP & HDMI when dual monitors via MiniDP and HDMI are not supported, as noted in the product guide. You will have to use a Thunderbolt-ready monitor with a Thunderbolt cable to allow both monitors to be driven from the dock. \nThe reason for this is that your dock is being driven by one Thunderbolt port, which does not allow for daisy-chaining displays (as far as the port on your computer is concerned) unless it is Thunderbolt 2 or the newest revision of DisplayPort. If you were to plug your monitor either into the spare Thunderbolt port on your computer (HDMI on the dock) or use the HDMI port on the computer (MiniDP on the dock) both monitors should work as a workaround.\n", "Q: Thunderbolt displays Besides the thunderbolt displays by Apple, are there any other monitor manufacturers that make monitors with thunderbolt interfaces? I could only find the Apple thunderbolt displays and 1-2 models from LG.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Are you looking for actual thunderbolt connections so you can daisy chain devices? Or just looking to avoid using a dongle to connect to a monitor? If so any display port monitor will work with a mini-dp to dp cable. \n", "Q: Downloading old Safari point releases (Ex: 8.0.4) I am attempting to build VMware Fusion images with each recent point release of Safari.

Having acquired a second hand Mac Pro (A1481) I want to upgrade the internal SSD drive from 256GB to at least 500GB.\nI have spent hours searching online, and can't find a provider other than OWC The one I have in place is Samsung, is there no online provider of these drives? furthermore, a few ebay auctions suggest that a MacBook Pro or MacBook Air SSD drive would be suitable.\nCan any one point me to a reputable source for these Samsung drives?\n\nA: The MacPro uses a proprietary interface - at least when it was first designed - for their SSD's It is a PCIe 2.0 x4 spec.  \nIt was called \"proprietary\" because no other \"workstation class\" computer used these types of drives.  They typically went with SATA or SAS (enterprise class of course)\nThe best price you are going to find for these drives is through Amazon. You may be able to win an auction on ebay, but for the time and hassle, I usually just went with Amazon.\nThese drive only work with the \"grey\" cylinder MacPro.  You can get more info from everymac.com\nWhat you might want to consider at this point is sticking with the SSD that you have and adding a thunderbolt drive.  I personally use the WD Thunderbolt Duo 6GB with my iMac (iMac has 256GB SSD).  It is super fast and expandable.  It has user serviceable drives so you can upgrade anytime you want.  There are other options out there, but after all my research, I picked this one and I have been extremely happy with it. \nUpdate (3.31.16)\nA year later and this hasn't changed much.  OWC is apparently the only aftermarket manufacturer of these SSD with the PCIe 2.0 x4 interface.\nAs far as SSD options, they seem to stop at 2013 for the MBA. I know, I have a relative that spilled milk on an MBA and have been looking for a USB to 2014 MBA SSD enclosure to transfer data and I can find none under $100.\nIt seems that the 2015 MBA SSD will work in the Mac Pro as they use the same SSD model (see below).  Source:  EveryMac.com\n\n\n\nThe 2014 MBA uses the PCIe 2.0 x2 so I cannot say if it will work or not (and I would be unwilling to test out this theory given the high cost of the components).  Source:  EveryMac.com\n\n\n\nA: Unfortunately there are still very few, very expensive options because of the proprietary interface. Your best bet is to go with an external storage option using USB 3.0 or Thunderbolt. However, if internal is the only way to go, here are pretty much your only options:\nA quick Ebay search turned up this: $800 for 1TB (http://www.ebay.com/itm/Apple-Samsung-1TB-PCIe-SSD-for-MacBook-Pro-iMac-MacPro-Late-2013-2015-NEW-/121939956104?hash=item1c64301188:g:PYUAAOSwgApW-z5W)\nAnd this: $950 for 1TB (http://www.ebay.com/itm/NEW-Apple-Samsung-1TB-PCIe-SSD-MacBook-Pro-iMac-MacPro-Late-2013-2015-SSUBX-/151605593746?hash=item234c65c692:g:6MUAAOSw5dNWmE6b).\nThe search was simply \"mac pro 2013 ssd\" on Ebay.\n\nA: As you likely known by now the Mac Pro uses a custom PCIe interface and drive form factor. This layout is unique to apple products and relatively new, so they are not readily available from third party manufactures. As you pointed out in your question OWC has developed a compatible drive. If you don't want to purchase the drive from them you will likely be stuck upgrading directly through Apple.\nIf you haven't come across it already there is a nice summary of the new drives on everymac.com.\n\nA: MCE announced a 1TB SSD upgrade for the Mac Pro this past March.  Looks like it is faster and easier to install than the OWC options.   \nhttp://store.mcetech.com/mm/merchant.mvc?Store_Code=mtos&Screen=PROD&Product_Code=1TBPCIESSD-MP13\n\nA: Is external a suitable option for you? \nThunderbolt 2 is very fast and there are SSD options available as well that are very useable. I have a dead hard drive and am running my entire system off of an external SSD connected via Thunderbolt until I can get it to the shop. \nIt is noticeably faster than even the internal drive that died.

I emptied the \"recently deleted\" and regained the space used by the deleted photos.\n\nA: In addition to connecting to iTunes (which is a great idea to back things up since when you run out of space, bad things can happen) you can log into iCloud.com and verify that your cloud storage and deleted items match what the device is telling you.\nIf there are items to come down from the cloud, you may have to clean it up there if the device has no room to move. It could be just wedged.\nI would go to usage under the settings app and delete some third party apps that use a lot of storage but that you can recover (say games that have saved state elsewhere online or don't need saved state) and then power down the device.\nClean things up online using a computer and then plug into iTunes if you can borrow a PC or Mac from a friend (set up a new user account - don't connect to their iTunes and mess up syncing further).\nWorst case, ask a follow on question detailing the usage stats and iOS version and we'll see what to do next.\n\nA: go to photos, then albums and the bottom listed one will be RECENTLY DELETED.\nIn there will be your deleted photos, select those, select all and then delete. Your space will be recovered.\n", "Q: How to share photos from Photos.app to Flickr retaining title, description and tags? In the new Photos.app application, the export of photographs to other services is via the OS X extensibility feature. Sharing one picture to Flickr shows the picture's filename as the title and empty description and tags even though the pictures had these three fields filled in the 'Info' window. This metadata was exported fine with iPhoto which had its own sharing mechanism so this issue is either with Photos.app or with the extensibility feature of OS X. How can I upload pictures from Photos.app to Flickr without having to retype all the metadata for each one of them?\n\nA: Nearly a year later you would expect Flickr integration to have improved. As of February 2016 I have the exact same experience. To investigate further I opened this forum thread:\nhttps://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/72157665235195925/\n\nA: I contacted Apple about the inability of Photos to upload titles etc. After admitting there was a problem, the technician told me they would get back to me! No news since then.\nPhotos seems to be a very inferior software compared to iPhoto. I guess we will have to wait for an update with \"improvements\". The glitches and mistakes in the \"improvement\" may be even worse!

How do I make sure that it reopens when it exits, and that duplicate processes aren't spawned?\nThanks\n\nA: You could create a launch agent, that starts when you first log in and re-starts if exited. Although I’m sure the app has created one for it self, and some setting might not be set correctly. Create on is quite simple. Here is an example if BetterTouchTool was installed in /Applications folder, and had the executable in MacOS folder in the bundle. You’ll have to restart after creating and saving this plist file in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ folder.\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN” \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>SuccessfulExit</key>\n        <false/>\n    </dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>BetterTouchTool</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/Applications/BetterTouchTool.app/Contents/MacOS/BetterTouchTool</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nIf you don't wish to restart, you can run this to start the agent: \nlaunchctl load <path to the newly created plist file>\n\nYou can change the value of program argument to what ever you like and read more about launch agents by typing man launchd.plist in the Terminal. This will tell you about all the available options. There are also GUI apps to create these plist files for you, my favourite is Lingon X.\nThough I would recommend you contact support for the app first, because this can result is in unexpected behaviour and mess with it’s functions.

In the new Photos app, you can still use face detection (or manual face tagging) to label faces, so you can easily pull up all pictures with a certain person in them, etc.\nFaces now lives in the \"Albums\" tab, where there's essentially a \"faces\" folder.  But when you open it...\n\n...there seem to be two categories:\n\n*\n\n*A few \"featured\" faces on top, which are larger (I'm not sure if these are \"most recent\" or \"most photos\"\n\n*All the other (smaller) faces.\n\nHow can I sort the full list of (smaller) faces in some way that lets me find a specific one.  Like, alphabetically, say?\nI have ~300 tagged faces, so browsing by face is simply not efficient when I'm looking for a specific person.\n\nA: There's now a sort by name feature! In Photos version 1.2, you can go to the Faces view and then do View > Sort > Keep Sorted By Name. Ridiculously, this is apparently turned off by default if you upgraded from a previous version.\nAnyway, this will make my use of Photos way way easier. (I have 1400+ faces.)\n\nA: Actually you can sort faces manually by dragging them including top faces\n", "Q: Can iTunes on Yosemite use ExFAT? On Mavericks I think you can Short version of the question: can iTunes 12.1.0.50 on Yosemite using ExFAT drive as the Library or how to make it work?\nI have some USB Flash drive and external SSD drive.  It seems that I can format them as ExFAT and then use it with iTunes 11.4 on Mavericks (using the drive as the iTunes Library), but when I use it with iTunes 12.1.0.50 on Yosemite, it gave me an error that iTunes cannot start.  So I have to reformat it in HFS+ (the Mac's file system), and then iTunes would run with it.\nMaybe it is due to iTunes or due to Yosemite... but I prefer ExFAT slightly over HFS+ because ExFAT can be used on a PC if occasionally I need to connect the drive to a PC.  Is there a way to make it work with ExFAT?\n\nA: I have my whole library on exFAT HDD. Just move iTunes folder from ~/Music to somewhere on exFAT hdd, create a symbolic link for iTunes folder and put it back in ~/Music.\nBut there is an issue. iTunes works a bit slowly than usual and shortly freezes while changing a tracks.\n", "Q: Can I upload an iOS app from OS X running on a VM to the App Store? I don't have an Apple device and I need to create a iOS app. I was wondering if I could do it from a VM running OSX.

I am able to use all apps etc perfectly. Any clues on what I can do and if this issue can somehow be corrected?\n\nA: Perhaps your Carrier Network Settings have been corrupted or altered in some way. In this case, the phone would be searching incorrectly for the carrier towers, or trying to connect and continually getting refused due to a setting error.\nApple provides details on checking and manually editing the settings, but getting them wrong can cause problems like you are experiencing. \nYou can also restore your phone via iTunes, which will wipe the iPhone, reinstall iOS, and redownload the carrier settings. After confirming the restore worked, you can then restore from a backup to get your apps and settings back.\n\nA: Try to get a new SIM card from your carrier.  Good Luck !\n", "Q: With New Photos app on Mac, how do I manage photos on my iPhone? I have 2 iMacs at the office and at home; an iPhone; and an iPad.\nI recently installed the new Photos app on both iMacs. In both cases, I’m using iCloud Photo Library. So, any new photos I take on my iPhone appear on both iMacs. This is great — now I know my photos are backed up (both on iCloud and on two iMacs), and they're available from any machine on which I'd like to access them.\nIn other words, as I understand it, Photos and iCloud are keeping all my devices in sync.\nThe problem is that I don't want to keep all my photos on my iPhone. Once the photo is saved to iCloud and my iMacs, I’d like to be able to delete it from my iPhone, while keeping it on both my iMacs and on iCloud. As it stands now, if I delete a photo from my iPhone, it also disappears from my iMacs.\nSo my question is, how can I delete photos from my iPhone without deleting them from iCloud or my iMacs? Is there a setting that makes this the default behavior?\n\nA: The default behavior is for iCloud Photo Library not to store full-size versions of your photos on your iPhone and iPad:\n\nThe theory is that only thumbnails are stored on your iPhone/iPad until you decide to view/edit/share the photo, at which point a device-optimized or full-size version of your photo is downloaded from iCloud.\n(Note: I know a full-size copy is downloaded when you edit/share, but it appears that if your iPhone has plenty of space it will download a full-size copy for viewing as well, as opposed to just a device-optimized version. This is likely to avoid having to do a second download later if you decide to share the photo.)\nWhen you start running low on space, iOS will begin pruning less-accessed photos and return to simply thumbnails or device-optimized versions of those.\nAll of this happens automatically in the background and you shouldn't have to worry about managing space yourself.\n\nA: iCloud Photo Library doesn't support doing that. All your photos have to be on all your devices where you've enabled it and deleting a photo anywhere deletes it everywhere.\nUnless you have a huge library, it shouldn't be a big issue. My library has 11K photos and 300 videos but only takes a little over 2GB of space on my iPhone. The total space used for photos & videos might actually go down as full-sized images taken on the iPhone or synced to it get replaced by \"device-specific\" resolutions.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Retina with more than 2 external displays I have an Macbook Pro with retina display and want to connect additional displays/monitors to it. But sadly 2+1 isn't enough for me, so I'm searching for solution:\nI want to buy two USB3.0 to VGA/HDMI adapters and my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will it blend... ekhm I mean will it actually display anything (I'm asking if are there any forced/purposed limitation on the macbook itself to only allow 3 monitors at any given time)\n\n*Will it be smooth enough to be usable?\n\nA: You can absolutely use display link drivers. I have an Intel Iris Graphics 6100 1536 MB graphics card in my 8gb Mac Book Pro (early 2015) 13 in. It drives 2 24 in Dell displays via with mindvi (normal fps) and four other Dell 24 in monitors using usb 2.0 -->minidvi adapters at 12-15fps. Not great for video or gaming, but just fine for email/documents/command line/etc. I still get full FPS on the two other monitors, so I'm not without media...  3.0 I imagine would be better, but more taxing on the system. \nAnyway, my opinion is that this will work even though Display link is a little buggy and support is not great. I love the mini display devices. Like I said, I imagine 3.0 would offer a lot better FPS... but I appreciate the price point and that the system is not heavily burdened by the 2.0 devices. \nAs you can see on the left I have (besides terrible cable management skills) a 7 port usb 3.0 hub off of which these four displays split. I have two small 4 inch fans pointed up at the display link adapters, and my computer is kept elevated on a small stand. The laptop is is new, and my room is air conditioned with a dehumidifier and a HEPA filter to keep dust from deteriorating the impact of internal fanning systems... but my machine does not run hot at all: \nMy 2013 mac book air can drive 5 displays... for some reason I am hitting a limit of 4 display port devices. You may have better luck though... \n[\n\nA: Overheat would appear to be your main hurdle.\nTwo displays daisy-chained over Thunderbolt, leaving a third to run from HDMI has been achieved, but at a cost…\nFrom Everymac\n\nHowever, in more detailed evaluation, a helpful EveryMac.com reader reported:\nI have a \"Mid-2012\" Retina Display MacBook Pro with two 27\" Thunderbolt Displays daisy chained in clamshell mode. I tried adding a third 1920x1200 Dell monitor via the HDMI port, and it actually does work. But here is the catch: with no external displays, the system fans hover around 2600 RPM. With two 27\" Thunderbolt Displays, regardless of what I do, the fans hover around 2800-3200 RPM. The GPU diode temp reads 69°C (156°F). If I force it via a fan control program to run at 2500 RPM, the GPU heats up. I was afraid of damaging my computer so I turned the fans back to auto-mode.\n  Now the kicker. I tried with the three monitors and the fans go up to 4800 RPM. That's without doing anything. If I start running a YouTube clip, or do anything remotely CPU or graphics intensive, the fans max out at 5900 RPM (which is the max the machine will do). I exceeded that by having a few videos running at the same time, fired up 3 virtual machines, and had it compile some code. The whole system became choppy and it began stuttering.\n  Since then, I've never used three monitors, just the two Apple Thunderbolt Displays. Apple probably doesn't officially recommend using three displays because it gets too hot.\n  The same helpful reader more recently followed up with:\nI've recently replaced the two 27\" Thunderbolt Displays with an LG 34UC97 Cineview Display, which has a 3440x1440 resolution. I tried this LG display with the \"Mid-2012\" 15-Inch Retina Display MacBook Pro and it works, but if I keep the MacBook Pro display open, the fans spin to 3500 RPM or so. When I power just the external display, it hovers around 2300 RPM.\n  I replaced the \"Mid-2012\" 15-Inch Retina Display MacBook Pro with a \"Mid-2014\" 13-Inch MacBook Pro -- specifically the MacBook Pro \"Core i7\" 2.8 13\" -- and this model has no problems, thermal or otherwise, running both the external 3440x1440 display and the internal display at the same time, even though the external display is higher resolution than Apple officially supports for either of the two external displays.\n  It seems like the Iris 6100 graphics processor can handle a much higher resolution monitor, but the performance in 3D games and such is no match for the NVIDIA 650M in the \"Mid-2012\" Retina Display MacBook Pro.\n  Ultimately, although the Retina Display MacBook Pro models are technically capable of running three external displays as well as the internal one, the above reader is highly likely to be correct that the notebook can overheat with three connected.\nConsequently, EveryMac.com does not recommend running more than two external displays on the Retina Display MacBook Pro models. However, it also is clear that some models can run a single external display that is a higher resolution than Apple officially supports for either of two external ones.\n\n", "Q: How to connect Macbook pro's Retina screen with my Mac mini?

The machine has only been up 4 hours so has been rebooted recently.\n\n\nA: I had similar issue with accountsd using 44 % CPU. The following steps solved the issue.\nIn Calendar.app > Preferences > Accounts... I disabled and enabled the account that Mail and Calendar kept trying to access.\n\nA: I had a Gmail account that was closed still signed into my Mac's system preferences.\nOnce I removed the account, accountsd went from 83% CPU to 0.01 after 30 seconds, my CPU temp went down from 183F to 106F, and my fans stopped running at high speed.\nI agree with most in regards to a Gmail account being the common denominator.  \n\nA: Could you please try to log out of all you iCloud Services, reboot and login again. \nI have the same issue, which occurs randomly. I'm suspecting iCloud or my Mail accounts in System Preferences.

I tried many solutions mentioned here but none of them solved the issue.\nIn my case OnyX app helped. I went to Maintenance and run with the following options (probably not all of those are needed). OnyX is available at https://www.titanium-software.fr/en/onyx.html\n\n\nA: *\n\n*The fix for this on Mojave is to install the 10.14.6 Supplemental Update - build 18G6032\n\n*The fix for this on Catalina is to install the macOS Catalina 10.15.7 Update - build 19H2\n\nAfter the reboot - check for build versions and that no OS updates are available. You don't need to delete any accounts or keychains or internal database files if you can patch your Mac with the Apple fixes.\n\nThe same problem still exists in 10.15.5. Some people have data in iCloud that triggers accountsd to loop. I followed the instruction from: https://waal70blog.wordpress.com/2019/12/16/accountsd-and-secd-high-cpu-usage-on-catalina/\nYou will see a folder that looks like a keychain under ~/Library/Keychains/ and you need to replace the xx...x part with that keychain.\nSolution: sudo rm -rf ~/Library/Keychains/xxx-xxx-xxxx-xxxxx and reboot.\nAnother set of triage steps is published at this site that lists many details from the perspective of people that administer Macs professionally.\n\n*\n\n*https://mrmacintosh.com/catalina-10-15-7-update-accountsd-using-400-if-using-icloud-mail/\n\nA: It sounds like that there is a bug in the file indexing of iOS. Sometimes, accountsd gets stuck in an indefinite loop while indexing the files in the computer (for Spotlight use). The way to solve it is to reset the indexing on your laptop:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences-> Spotlight-> Privacy \n\n*add (+) your hard disk (most probably \"Macintosh HD\") in the \"Prevent Spotlight from searching these locations\" list. \n\n\nThis will erase your previous index file and should solve your problem with the high usage of accountsd. However, Spotlight won't work any more. If you don't need it, don't bother to follow the rest of the instructions. \nBut if you need Spotlight back, remove Macintosh HD from the list by selecting it and clicking the - button. Do this over the night or sometime that you don't need your laptop for few hours as it is going to reindex your files and takes a lot of computer resources. \n\nA: What worked for me (macOS 10.15.7) is signing out of Apple ID and restarting. Logging into Apple ID brought the issue back so from reddit the following terminal command permanently fixed the issue\nsudo -v\nkillall -9 accountsd.iCloudHelper\ndefaults delete MobileMeAccounts\nmkdir ~/Library/Accounts/Backup\nmv ~/Library/Accounts/.sqlite ~/Library/Accounts/Backup/\nkillall -9 accountsd.iCloudHelper\nsudo reboot\n\nMy symptoms were accountsd at 300%,  no apps open, slow spotlight.\nYou can also check in Console application to see if accountsd has recorded any errors. Just open Console and enter \"accountsd\" . This is taken from an answer on a different thread, and probably the best place to start.\nI tried the answers posted in this thread but none worked. At the time of my post they included:\n\n*\n\n*Quit Mail\n\n*Remove Google accounts from Mail, Calendar (need to resync after reconnecting)\n\n*Add Macintosh HD to Spotlight privacy so it would not be indexed (HDD will need be indexed again by spotlight)\n\n*Delete all passwords in ~/Library/Keychain (Deletes passwords locally, but can resync from iCloud)\n\n*Signing out of AppleID (deletes all iCloud files on machine)\n\n\nA: Per someone else's suggestion on a similar thread, I deselected the Mail > Preferences > Accounts > Advanced > Automatically Detect and Maintain Account Settings and the CPU dropped back to normal range. I have 3 google, 1 yahoo, and iCloud accounts. Hopefully this fix will stick. I had run Disk Util multiple times for same issue, and there seem to be continual permissions errors popping up, so not sure if another underlying process or this was it. Good luck!\n\nA: I got accountsd to quiet down by exiting and restarting the Mail app. It went from around 60% CPU to 0% CPU. No reboot was required.\nI'm not sure what triggered its bad behavior, but I was looking at my accounts and provisioning profiles in Xcode for a very long time.\n\nA: In the Mail app, go to Window > Activity and try to cancel everything it is doing. That solved it for me\n\nA: Unchecking Calendars and Messages in my Google account solved it for me. It is no loss to me, regardless, as I only use Google for some mail at the moment (which I left selected). As to why this was an issue with Google, and why it only became an problem recently, I am at a loss.\n\nA: I met this problem when I just updated to 10.13.6, too. And I happily find this problem disappear after I restart my MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015).\n\nA: I solved increasing the space on iCloud.\n\nA: I tried all solutions. None worked.

It seems like we always need to run around and find out that program xyz can be called as 'abc'.\nFor example, Sublime Text's is 'subl', Kaleidoscope is 'ksdiff'.  Great, but you need to look these up for each and every program.  And there are lots of identical questions, about Finder for example.\nWhat is the best Mac approach to figuring out the command line \"alias\" for an any app?  Can I make use of the Activity Monitor if the program is open? Do I have to go nose around in the Applications folder?  If so, how can I tell the \"command line alias file\" from the others?\nOr can I use \"ps aux\" in bash?  For example, on Linux or on Windows, \"foo.exe\" in the list of processes means that you could just type \"foo.exe\" to launch that program.  But Sublime shows up as Sublime Text, not 'subl', so don't think that would work.\n\nA: Bot Sublime Text and Kaleidoscope are special cases as they install either a helper utility or themselves somewhere in your $PATH.\nThe easiest way to open any application from /Applications is to run\nopen -a APPNAME\n\nin Terminal, e.g.\nopen -a Pages       # opens Pages\nopen -a \"App Store\" # opens the App Store\n\n\nA: Just to elaborate on the answer by patrix.

They don't show any artwork on the iPhone. The mp4's do show artwork on Windows. Is there an easy way to use the artwork that I see in Windows on the iPhone? I've done the obvious but tedious step of taking a capture of the image in Windows Explorer, saving it, and using iTunes to set the image as artwork. It works, but way too slow. I've also tried to play an mp4 in itunes and use \"Set as poster frame\"; that did not work. Ideally iTunes would just use the same artwork I see in Windows, but failing that, is there a Windows tool that would batch export the artwork, then I could manually set the artwork for each file in iTunes (at least saving me the step of taking a screen capture).\n\nA: Why are you taking a screen capture rather than setting the artwork using the original jpg/png files?

I am trying to apply for the WWDC 2015 scholarship. I have an app that record trails (like Runkeeper) that I'd like to submit for the scholarship (and submit it to the App Store). However, in the scholarship app requirements, it states that the app must tell something about the developer, and the app must have the developer's name as its name. However, the app that I'm trying to submit neither tells about me, nor does it have my name as its name. Does the scholarship accept these kind of apps? I could extend my app to include info about me. But does Apple allow submitting an app to the app store and modifying it so it abides the scholarship requirements? I'm sorry if my question sound stupid :)\n\nA: The app needs to be an interactive CV/Resume that shows off your creative and technical ability, but also talks about your background and projects you've worked on. Submitting an app you've already made that serves another purpose isn't what they're looking for, though you can (and should) submit links to other pieces of software you've made in addition.\nMore detail is given in the scholarship requirements section 1: https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/scholarships/Scholarship-Guidelines-and-Terms.pdf\nGood luck! \n", "Q: Time Machine on a local drive, then make that drive a network drive (via Server.app) on a different computer I have two macs running OS X 10.10.3. One has Server.app installed, is connected to the internet via ethernet, and also has a 2 TB disk attached via USB, with two partitions - \"Backup\" and \"Storage\". My other mac is a laptop used for schoolwork.\nUsing the Time Machine feature of Server.app, I was able to use the standard Time Machine interface to begin backing up my local mac onto the \"Backup\" volume on the server mac over the network.\nHowever, I discovered that it takes 7 minutes to copy a 1 GB file over AFP, so backing up 300 GB on my local mac would take at least 35 hours.\nSo, I'm trying to figure out a way in which I could do the initial 300GB backup onto \"Backup\" over USB, and then connect that external hard drive to the server mac and continue doing backups over the network. That way, the incremental network backups would be much smaller than 300GB and could be done in a reasonable time period, e.g. overnight.\nAny suggestions? I read the man page for tmutil but I'm not very comfortable with it just yet.\n\nA: This MacSales article covers how to do this very well: \nhttp://blog.macsales.com/18406-speed-time-machine-past-88mph-over-your-local-network\nEssentially, you start with a fresh Time Machine backup. Start it on Wifi, then stop it, as it begins to backup files. This basically establishes the Time Machine archive. Then you attach your hard drive (or laptop) to the wired network, and resume backup. Once you have the initial backup done over the much faster wired network, subsequent backups will be much faster, as the are much smaller.\nYou establish the initial Backup over wifi because Time Machine does things differently over wifi vs directly connected. \nIn any case, best of luck to you: I have never managed to get Time Machine to work reliably over wifi, and especially if you tend allow your Mac to go to sleep during a Time Machine backup (shut the lid for example)\n", "Q: Will screen sharing work across different ISPs and over the Internet? I’m just beginning to learn the use of screen sharing between two Macs.\nToday I’ve successfully implemented it with two different computers on my desktop, using the \"Sharing\" section in System Preferences.\nWhat I wonder about now is, once those two computers will be in places very far from each other and using completely unrelated internet providers, will the screen sharing feature automatically work the way it does when both computers use the same internet provider ? Or need I specify some data about servers, ip addresses or something like that to one of the computers ?\n\nA: This question is quite broad, and there is no succinct answer. Many ISPs have filters on their networks and do not pass all IP protocols transparently.  I have experimented with Chrome Remote Desktop, however, and it seems to be work very well. I can access to my home iMac (on Verizon FiOS) through my school's firewall without a problem, and with my iOS devices, too! You might want to experiment to make sure it does what you need.\n\nA: Yes, built-in Screen Sharing will work across multiple ISP's as long as the two Macs can see one another. VNC in particular is a robust broadly support albeit it not particularly secure protocol. The routers on each end (not the ISP) but the local routers have to be set to allow at least VNC connections (illustrated guides for most routers).\nTo get across wide internet gaps and deal with automated login, there used to be a BackToMyMac feature in MobileMe which worked well and has now moved to iCloud and is free for users of iCloud (not me).\nYou can also access screen sharing via the \"Connect To Server\" (command + k) from the finder. Once there put in vnc:// followed by the host name or ip address.\nChicken of the VNC (now just Chicken) is a great free VNC client. JollyFastVNC is an even better (although paid) client (licenses $10 or $30).\nThere are several competing Mac compatible solutions. With these solutions, you don't have to worry about router configuration as the connection handshake goes through a central server and they remap the traffic to common http protocols, open on every internet connected network.\n\n\n*\n\n*Remotix will allow you to use VNC or Apple Remote Desktop with computers located anyway. Very good reviews at MacUpdate from pros. $40.\n\n*TeamViewer will allow you to control remote screens cross-platform. Personal use is free. Commercial use is very expensive. I've used TeamViewer quite a bit in the past and it's good but we had to give it up at work. New versions with stiff upgrades seem to come every year. TeamViewer is on v11 now and was v3/4 when I was using it.\n\n*LogMeIn is paid use only and has angered their users. I've not used it.\n\n\nRemote screen sharing is viable but it is significant IT overhead and does entail substantial security risks. If you can log on, so can a good hacker. There are automated bots out there scanning for open ports and machines which answer.\n", "Q: How to send non-HTML mail from Apple Mail?

I'm trying to diagnose a late-2011 MacBook Pro 15\", and I'm trying to get into the single user mode. I press and hold Cmd+S (the left Cmd, if it changes anything) but I'm not getting into the mode. I've tried pressing (and holding) it before pressing the power button, at the same time, a little after etc. I've tried all the combinations. It just won't enter. It will keep booting or let's say (try booting) into the OS where it gets stuck. When I press Cmd+S, however, I can see a very brief terminal in the middle for a very short/split second, and it disappears as I haven't pressed it all.

Before iCloud Photo Library and Photos.app in OS X 10.10.3, we had iCloud PhotoStream. iCloud PhotoStream synced its photos to the ~/Library/Application Support/iLifeAssetManagement folder (and subfolders). Even though PhotoStream only synced 1000 photos, that folder could get rather large, but you had to live with it.\nNow that iCloud Photo Library exists, and everything is stored in the cloud (and the cloud copy is \"the truth\"), I'm assuming that the iLifeAssetManagement folder is no longer used and can be deleted. Does any one know for sure if that's true?\nIn my case, the folder hasn't had changes since I upgraded to iCloud Photo Library, which would indicate it's not being used.\n\nA: The answer appears to be \"Yes, it can\". After a month of the folder not being touched I finally deleted it and it hasn't caused any issue whatsoever. However, if any device using your iCloud account is still using Photo Stream (for whatever reason), you may still need the folder.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro a lot slower after reset I recently had some issues with my computer and since I had a backup of all of my files I decided to just wipe the hard drive clean.  After, what I thought, was a full reset I am beginning to suspect I did something incorrectly.  What used to take about 15-20 seconds to go from powered off to using my computer now takes about 2 minutes.  Also, when my computer goes to sleep it says \"My_Name_MacBook_Pro(2)\" where as it used to just say \"My_Name_MacBook_Pro\".\nI was hoping someone could give a possible explanation as to what I might have messed up in the factory reset process before I take it in to the Apple Store.\n\nA: I had this issue recently, and I realized I had incorrectly reset the NVRAM.

After the list of printers is returned, click on the printer in question. It took me quite a bit of poking around to find the setting for single-sided/double-sided as a default (Print Type: under \"Finishing Options\" tab). I suspect one advantage to this technique is that it sets the default in the printer, where the Option key method may only set it for that print queue. Since deleting and re-creating a print queue is a standard troubleshooting step, the web browser technique might be a better long-term solution.\n", "Q: Can photos be added to a shared iCloud photo stream album even after it has reached 5000 photos?

I'm not sure this is the correct place where to ask this. If you can indicate me another Stack Exchange website I can use instead would be great.\nAnyway, I'm willing to move to a prepaid sim card for my iPhone to cut costs. That is, I don't want to pay a monthly subscription, but pay per minute/sms/internet traffic.\nI'm not calling or texting a lot, just very occasionally. And I sometimes use google maps via 3G.\nAlso, I would like to receive Facebook messages via 3G, but I don't need to be notified on time, the phone can check every 30 minutes for example for the Facebook inbox.\nCan I have this with a prepaid sim card? To have my iPhone to check every 30 minutes for incoming messages / mails, so that it connects just few times per day and it doesn't stay online all the time?\n\nA: This is perfectly doable. I use a prepaid SIM myself and get by without a problem (although my usage is a lot different to yours). Here are some tips to maximise your iPhone efficiency and minimise your bill.\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch off \"Background App Refresh\". I have mine switched off for all but a few apps but for your needs it isn't necessary. This will boost battery life as well as reduce data usage since apps won't be able to update their content while backgrounded.\n\n*Set your mobile data network to 2G, and switch to 3G only when necessary. Again, this will boost your battery and reduce data costs, while still allowing Push notifications to come through.\n\n*Switch Push off for Mail, Contacts and Calendars. You can set the default action to \"Fetch\" and then pick between 30 minutes, an hour, or manually. The iPhone will then only check that often for mail or updates to your contacts/calendars (unless you open their respective apps).\n\n*I don't use the Facebook Messenger app so I'm not familiar with its settings, but if you have Background App Refresh off, you will only receive Push notifications and the messages will only actually come through once you open the app. There may be an option within the app itself to restrict the fetch interval for messages (although I doubt it because \"Facebook knows best\").\n\n*Disable 3G for specific apps. If there are apps you only need an internet connection for when you are at home or in a WiFi area, disable cellular data for them. This makes sure they don't sneak any information past you if you inadvertently open them while out and about.\n\n*Disable Location Services. This one is always a controversial one. While it will boost battery life and reduce data usage, you have to weigh up the cost of using a little bit of data to be able to use Find My iPhone against the cost of replacing your phone if it gets stolen.\n\n\nThats about all I can think of for prepping an iPhone for prepaid use. I'll update this if I think of any more.\n", "Q: Mac equivalent of Ctrl + Space to select an item on a list I want to select non-consecutive items on a list, without using a mouse/trackpad - there should be no clicks involved.\nIn Windows and Linux (at least Ubuntu) an item can be selected using Space/ button, which, in combination with arrows and Ctrl key allows me to select multiple items in any environment (file manager, IDE etc.) - e.g.\nEnter a directory -> hold Ctrl -> down arrow twice -> press Space -> down arrow twice -> press Space.\nNow I should have items 1, 3 and 5 selected.\nIs there a way to do the same thing in OS X?\nPS.

I use a referenced library.\n\nA: Duplicating it simply duplicates the pointer within the library, it does not actually duplicate the underlying file. This occurs whether or not you have a referenced library. You can test this by using the Edit tools to make a change - such as cropping - then duplicating the image. The duplicated image has a \"Revert to Original\" button in Edit mode that takes you back to what the image looked like before the change, even though this \"duplicate\" image didn't even exist at that point in time.\nBased on this, it appears the duplicate function is intended to allow you to maintain multiple versions of an image at the same time, but still allow you to do so non-destructively.\nIf you want to physically duplicate the file, you need to do so in Finder and then import that file into Photos.\n@Tetsujin is correct about the hard link.\n\nA: I think the trick is to drag a copy out to the desktop, otherwise it will make a hard link rather than a copy. \n", "Q: Problems with the trash My iMac trash folder takes forever to clean out. I had 4 files in there today and when i went to empty it, it was saying there was 1,590,715 items in it.\nCan anyone help please.\n\nA: It's possible that there are hidden files in your Trash that are not being removed for some reason and are constantly being \"deleted\". If you are ABSOLUTELY sure there is nothing in your Trash you may want to recover, you have two options.\nSecure Empty Trash:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right (CMD) click your Trash\n\n*Press and hold CMD, you will notice \"Empty Trash\" changes to \"Secure Empty Trash\"\n\n*Click \"Secure Empty Trash\"\n\n\nThis forces Finder to remove files that may otherwise be stubborn. It may take a while depending on how many files need to be deleted as the reference to the data is not only deleted, but the addresses the data is stored at (on your disk) is also zeroed out. Be wary of doing this with a Solid State drive as it will shorten the life of your drive (generally only by a small fraction, but caution should still be taken). If you have a Solid State (or Fusion) drive, I would recommend the following instead:\nBrute Force Erase:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open \"Terminal\"\n\n*If you have altered your Terminal settings, type cd ~ and hit Return\n\n*Type sudo rm -rf .Trash and hit Return\n\n*Enter your password\n\n\nTerminal will remove the .Trash folder that stores everything in your Trash. This folder will be rebuilt by OS X as needed. This doesn't securely erase your data (by overwriting with zeroes) and thus is safe for use on SSDs and Fusion Drives. You can also use this if \"Secure Erase\" fails for some reason.\nAs @patrix notes, this will not remove anything from your Trash that was originally stored on an external drive as each drive has its own .Trash folder. If you have multiple user accounts, this will also not remove anything that another user has Trashed as each user has their own .Trash folder too.\nAs a precautionary measure, I would then verify your disk in Disk Utility (in case some data tables have been corrupted) and repair if necessary.\n", "Q: App Store Update stuck I've downloaded the \"Pro Video Formats 2.0.1\" update at least twice, but it keeps showing up in the Mac App Store.

It is probably caused by their database records being slightly out-of-sync.\nI ignored it for a couple days, and it went away.\n\nA: I had that issue with the 2.0.1 update as well. What finally worked for me (see this Apple Support Discussion) was downloading Pacifist and using it to install the update that I downloaded manually from the Apple Support site here. All you have to do is choose \"Open Package\" in Pacifist, select the Pro Video update disk image, and install the top-level item (\"Contents of [dmg name].dmg\").\nThis method seems to have worked for me. However, something about the installer seems to mess with file permissions, because Disk Utility had a lot to sort out after installing. This seems to have more to do with the Apple Installer itself, though, and not the method by which it is installed.\n\nA: From Apple Support Communities\n\nJust called Apple support... here is the official fix.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Move all files from /Library/QuickTime/ to a temp older on desktop\n  \n*Open AppStore and download/install update\n  \n*Reboot\n  \n*Copy any missing files from temp folder on desktop to /Library/QuickTime.

I keep these in the \"favourites\" bar in Finder for easy access. Most of my working days start like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*I open Finder, and click on the shortcut for the folder I need\n\n*Two things happen simultaneously:\n\n\n*\n\n*My Mac connects with the drive then opens the folder. So far, so good.\n\n*Finder sees that there was a moment's delay before the folder opened, while the network connection completed, and automatically deletes the shortcut\n\n\n*So I then need to go to the containing folder, and re-create the shortcut\n\n\nIs there any way to stop Finder doing this?\nI'm aware of workarounds like using a shortcut on my desktop, or manually connecting to the drive first, etc etc. I'm looking for a solution where I don't need to remember to stop myself doing something natural and intuitive like clicking on a favourites shortcut every morning. \nThinking about it, I'd also quite like to stop it auto-deleting any favourites links, even if they never work and are genuinely broken links: if a folder link breaks, I'll want to be able to look at the old file path to help me work out where a colleague might have moved it to. So solutions that turns off all auto-deletion of shortcuts is also welcome.\n\nTo add a little more info, once connected the shared drive appears in the \"Shared\" section of the Finder sidebar. \"Get info\" on it gives its \"Kind\" as \"PC\", and no further info. \nIt looks like Finder is set up such that if you click on a favourite, and Finder doesn't get back either \"success\" or some sort of specific known \"connecting\" message of a type that network Macs send to other Macs, it immediately deletes the shortcut. I'd like to have it not auto-delete shortcuts.\n\nA: This seems to be a somewhat prevalent issue, without a clear fix yet.

I have a MacBook Pro (early 2011) with a 320 GB hard disk, and I have a 200 GB storage plan on iCloud. The problem is that I cannot simply copy the Applications folder to iCloud Drive and restore it later in the event that I lose all of the disk storage. I would like to save all the operating system files, the applications and almost everything on the disk (I need about 150 GB for that).\nThe problem is that Time Machine asks me for a disk to save the data on. If I have a fast connection I think it's not totally worthless to save the entire disk to iCloud, but does Time Machine support this and if yes, how?\n\nA: Unfortunately, Time Machine doesn't support this feature and there are a couple of reasons why.\n\n\n*\n\n*Time Machine makes physical backups of all your files, not just links to them. If it backed up to iCloud Drive (which syncs to your Mac), it would duplicate 150GB on to your HDD. It would then try to back all of that up too (unless you exclude that location from the backup) so it would try to add another 150GB to the backup, and so on.\n\n*Time Machine makes incremental backups. Sure, your backup is just 150GB now. But you change a few files and it backs up an additional 25MB. You install a new app and it adds another 2GB. While you may keep your actual drive below 320GB, your Time Machine backup could end up over 1TB in size! In my case, I use about 400GB of storage on my Mac, but my Time Machine backup is over 1.3TB due to deleted files.\n\n\nHaving said all that, sure, theoretically it is possible. If you created a link to a folder on your iCloud Drive in /Volumes/ it should show up as a disk to back up to, and if you excluded backing up iCloud Drive through Time Machine it wouldn't double in size every backup. Your hard drive would fill up very very quickly though, and your performance would suffer. To me, at least, this seems a lot more effort than it is worth. \n\nA: Apple will add this feature surely soon, as 512GB isn't a lot with fibre.\n", "Q: Skype is showing the wrong last messages I have a conversation between three users.

The problem is that it's trivial to fake the sender of an email, so bouncing spam usually sends the bounce message to an unsuspecting additional victim; and if the same (innocent!) email address is used to fake the sender for a lot of spam, it would get inundated with bounce messages.\nAnd this is why we can't have nice things.\n", "Q: What happens if I create a file while Time Machine is backing up?

You cannot search for the app, see an icon, or open it in any way.\nI do not want to disable all browsers. In fact, that's the problem. The Parental Controls control all web things. And that's great. But if I want the default browser to be Google Chrome and I want to use a whitelist, then I can't use Parental Controls (at least since Yosemite). The Parental Controls option for a whitelist has been blocking everything from Chrome. Firefox has similar problems, but not as bad as with Chrome. If I use Chrome and Chrome's parental controls, then a user can just open Safari with no restrictions.\n\nA: You could change permissions for Safari.\nOpen the information window on Safari (from the Finder window, with the Safari application selected, push command+I or right-click), add the desired user, and set permissions to no access. \n\nA: Just open the terminal and type:\ncd /Applications\nsudo rm -R -f Safari.app\n\nIt will ask for your password and proceed to delete Safari from the system.

I am on Yosemite 10.10.3, though in the public beta program (which now is in sync with releases). I am also in the Dropbox beta, now on 3.5.58, for what it's worth.\nFile access is curiously slow now. It could be a hardware issue, like the old spinning HDD dying in my MBP. That said, things often stall when Save or Open dialog boxes open up, and more often than not the Dropbox extension crashes afterwards.\nDisplaying the contents of folders is also slow, in the dialog boxes or Finder windows themselves, like in this question.\nHow should one start diagnosing such an issue?\nI understand I could forget the Dropbox beta. I could also talk to them. But this has been crashing ever since Yosemite went to public beta testing, and no update to the OS nor Dropbox ever fixed this. The Dropbox beta is not that far ahead from the release anyway.\nIs there anything to check here other than a reinstall or even a migration to a new mac?\nI regularly run Onyx, so everything what it would do (incl. permission repairs) has been done recently. That said, Onyx's hardware check regularly complains about the disk, which needs to repaired after booting from the recovery disk. I don't know why this is recurring.

Apologies if this has been asked somewhere. I tried searching for a solution to this for a while to no avail.\nWhen I press CMD + TAB on my Macbook Pro (Yosemite 10.10.3) to open the application switcher, normal behavior allows you to release the TAB key and hold CMD to keep the switcher window open, then tap TAB as necessary to reach the desired application.

Do note however, that the fix is highly technical, and requires at least a competent understanding of operating systems and the CLI to safely apply it.

I wanted to buy this iMac. Does anyone know if I could upgrade the RAM to 16?\n\nA: This particular model that you're looking at is referring to the Late 2013 model of the iMac, 27\" display version (model number ME089LLAUZ from the linked store page and verifiable through Apple's own KB article). \nApple sells this on their store still, and you can order a custom configuration with up to 32 GB of RAM as specified on its product page. This would probably be the better option after a glance at the numbers when you add 16 GB of RAM to the order.\nHowever, for the model on the website you referred to, you can also purchase supported RAM yourself and install it in the two empty slots at the bottom of the machine (Apple has their own guide for that here). Note that the RAM you purchase must meet the following criteria (may seem like a lot, but compatible parts are easily found on Amazon and other suppliers):\n\n\n*\n\n*PC3-12800\n\n*Unbuffered \n\n*Nonparity \n\n*204-pin \n\n*1600 MHz \n\n*DDR3 SDRAM\n\n", "Q: Process running for several minutes in Sleep mode My Mac OS is OS X Yosemite (Version 10.10.2).\nNormally I put the mac in Sleep mode before going to bed, and I realize very often that the machine starts to run in the night just for several minutes and then back to silence.\nI guess there is some bad process/software in my Mac that wakes up the system from time to time.\nI know that Activity Monitor could check processes, but I have no idea how to see what is wrong...\nCould anyone help?\n\nA: As of OS X Mountain Lion (10.8), there has been a feature called \"Power Nap\" that allows the Mac to periodically wake from sleep while connected to a power adapter to retrieve emails, calendar updates, iCloud syncing, or to back up to Time Machine. This would be my guess for the reason why your Mac is waking up and running during the night and not an indication of a bad process on your Mac.\nIf this is unwanted behavior, it's an easy setting to switch off in System Preferences > Energy Saver: \n\nNote that another option here is \"Wake for network access\" - which would be along the lines of remote or local file/printer sharing while in sleep.

My office VPN called Juniper does not gets installed on Mac OS X. I am using Parallels to run guest Windows on my macbook pro with OS X Yosemite. I don't know what I am asking, and if it is even logical or not, but here is my question:\nIs there a way that I can share my guest operating system's VPN connection with host operating system? What I mean is, that I connect to my office VPN using my guest Parallels Windows OS and that can be shared with my host macbook Mac OS X?\nBy doing this what I want to achieve is, that I want to just open Windows using Parallels and then connect to my VPN and then minimize it and come back to OS X and then surf all my internet websites on Safari or Chrome (on Mac and not W indows).\nIs this possible? Could anybody guide me on how to do this if its possible?\n\nA: You may be able to share the connection from Windows to Mac, depending upon how it is implemented in Windows. Follow these steps, from this site:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add a Host-Only network adapter to the guest (Windows).\n\n*Launch the Guest (Windows).\n\n*Go to a command prompt and type:\nipconfig /all\n\nNote the IP Address of the Host Only adapter. Likely something like 10.37.129.2.\n\n*Assuming the VPN shows as a connection in Windows Network Connections, setup Internet Connection Sharing on this adapter. When setting up ICS, choose the Host Only adapter as the Private Network Adapter.\n\n*Once that’s done, connect to the VPN.\n\n*On the host, add a route to your VPN, specifying the IP address of the Host Only Adapter as the gateway. In this example, the subnet trying to be reached on the VPN is 192.168.40.0/24, and the IP address of the Host Only Adapter is 10.37.129.2, so in a Terminal window you would type the following:\nsudo route -n add 192.168.40.0/24 10.37.129.3\n\n\nA: It sounds like I have similar hardware and software setup. Are you able to setup VPN through the Mac's system preferences?\n\n\n*\n\n*Go System Preferences >> Network\n\n*At the bottom-left, click '+' to create a new type of connection.\n\n*For the Interface drop-list, choose VPN\n\n*Choose the VPN Type accordingly.\n\n*Confirm that Service Name is meaningful for you.\n\n*Complete the remaining fields according to your setup.\n\n*Tick the Show VPN status in menu bar checkbox.\n\n\nOnce that's done, go to the menu bar and click the \"VPN\" icon and choose Connect.

If it's frequently on the edge you probably won't be happy with the 12\" MacBook. If it's in the lower percentages usually, it should work quite well. \nKeep in mind that the MacBook is only available with 8GB of RAM. So if you frequently have issues with RAM usage now, you'll see a lot more of those errors..\n\nA: It runs parallels absolutely fine, I use it to run autodesk design review on external monitor whilst having Mac running excel on macbook screen, no issues and very pleased that it can do it as well as my 16Gb Ram quad core MBPro.\n\nA: Yes, I'm running vagrant and docker for development and have had no problems so far.

There are several ways to downsize the screen resolution to 1440x900px (and less for streaming movies on slow internet connections). Google for the following tutorial \"setgetscreenres\", it will lead you to a small compilable program that allows command-line access to changing the display resolution (which in OS X 10.11.5 is no longer supported in the system preferences). Here are the instructions\nChanging display resolution on Retina machines while in Command Line Mode\nOne can then make the whole thing \"clickable\" with a shell script command embedded in an apple script application \ndo shell script \"/path/to/script/set1440x900.sh\"\n\nor alike.\nthe script could look like\n#!/bin/bash\n\n/path/to/setgetscreenres 1440 900\n\nTo get the mac OS retina functionality back, just go to system preferences > display and select any of the options. However, performance of the VM dramatically suffers in full-screen mode, especially when handling graphics-intense tasks.\nOtherwise, I can confirm that the linux VM performance of the macbook 12 inch retina is comparable to that of a macbook air 13 inch, both with 8GB RAM.\nThe option with the unscaled retina display output in virtualbox 5.1 works, however it is not very useful with the standard configuration of desktop environments like xfce4. One needs to adjust fonts and pointer sizes manually and still the aspect is kind of awful. It is easier to use a lower overall resolution and profit from the much better graphics performance. I am certain that there will be improvements on the VBOX side as well as more adapted desktop environments for linux some of which already support these high-res displays.\n", "Q: grepping /Library and \"Too many levels of symbolic links\" I'm trying to clean up remnants of an application that was removed:\n$ sudo grep -R \"iNet Network\" /Library\n...\ngrep: /Library//Frameworks/Mono.framework/Home/lib/libmono-2.0.1.dylib.dSYM/libmonoboehm-2.0.1.dylib.dSYM: Too many levels of symbolic links\ngrep: /Library//Frameworks/Mono.framework/Home/lib/libmono-2.0.dylib.dSYM/libmonoboehm-2.0.dylib.dSYM: Too many levels of symbolic links\ngrep: /Library//Frameworks/Mono.framework/Libraries/libmono-2.0.1.dylib.dSYM/libmonoboehm-2.0.1.dylib.dSYM: Too many levels of symbolic links\ngrep: /Library//Frameworks/Mono.framework/Libraries/libmono-2.0.dylib.dSYM/libmonoboehm-2.0.dylib.dSYM: Too many levels of symbolic links\ngrep: /Library//Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/3.2.1/lib/libmono-2.0.1.dylib.dSYM/libmonoboehm-2.0.1.dylib.dSYM: Too many levels of symbolic links\ngrep: /Library//Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/3.2.1/lib/libmono-2.0.dylib.dSYM/libmonoboehm-2.0.dylib.dSYM: Too many levels of symbolic links\ngrep: /Library//Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/lib/libmono-2.0.1.dylib.dSYM/libmonoboehm-2.0.1.dylib.dSYM: Too many levels of symbolic links\ngrep: /Library//Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/lib/libmono-2.0.dylib.dSYM/libmonoboehm-2.0.dylib.dSYM: Too many levels of symbolic links\n\nIt's an unrelated issue to what I am trying to do, but I'd like to clean it up.

I migrated the iPhoto library to a Photo library almost immediately after upgrade.  I am seeing the following behaviors occur 6 or more hours after the migration completed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Thumbnails display as blank white rectangles for some photos in the library, including some taken last year.\n\n*Double-clicking on those thumbnails to open the photo will open the photo for viewing with some of them, for others, it will display a only the blank white background of the interface.\n\n\nDo I need to be patient and allow Photo to index all the photos, thereby rebuilding the thumbnails, again?  Can I instruct Photos to regenerate thumbnails again?  I tried Command+Option and opening Photos, but that just repairs the library.  I have read that does not regenerate the thumbnails.  Any suggestions are appreciated.\n\nA: In this case, the issue turned out to be caused by missing photos.  I discovered this when rebuilding the thumbnails on the unmigrated library using iPhoto.\nThis does not appear to be caused by any issue with iPhoto or Photos.

Recently my mom got an iPhone for herself.  She needs to now keep her Apple ID for personal use.  We would like to create a new Apple ID for the iPad now and continue to use the iPad shared among the entire family.  The concern is over losing app progress when the switch is made.\n\n\n*\n\n*How will app ownership be affected by this change?  Will apps disappear because the original purchaser is no longer logged in on the iPad?\n\n*Will saved progress disappear when a new Apple ID takes over the iPad?  Or does progress remain saved on the iPad hard drive?\n\n*What will happen to achievements in Gamecenter?  Will they update to where they were when the new Apple ID launches a game that has already been there for years?\nThanks!\n\nA: I think most people worry about this when they stop sharing an iPad. I used to hear these concerns all the time at the AASP I worked at. Let's address each issue in turn.\n\n\n*\n\n*Apps will still remain associated to your mom's Apple ID, but they won't disappear. If you sign out of your mom's account and sign in with the new one, the apps stay exactly where they are. The only snag is, when it comes time to update, you will be asked for your mom's Apple ID and password to update them.\n\n*None of the data saved in apps will disappear when you switch an Apple ID as it is all saved locally on the device (except in the case of online games such as Clash of Clans etc, but they usually require you to log in with a 3rd Party service such as Facebook which then stores your save data instead).\n\n*Unfortunately, the Game Centre achievements are linked to your mom's Apple ID and if you sign out of hers and in with another, those achievements will disappear. Often, games feature a local achievement board which will remain on the device, and there is a chance it would sync to the new Apple ID, but in most cases I'm afraid you'll have to get those achievements again. But hey, look at it this way, that old game you haven't played in months? You can have some more fun with it again trying to set your old high score! ;)\n\n\nYou can have a look at another post of mine here where I talk about backing up and restoring save games on an iPad when switching users. You can use the information in there to backup your saves, then delete the games and re-download them with the new Apple ID to circumvent the annoying need for your mom's Apple ID whenever they need to be updated.\nObviously, any purchased apps and games would need to be re-purchased if you do this, so I would recommend your mom enable Family Sharing on her Apple ID and add the new Apple ID to the family so you can access her purchases without paying for them again.\n\nA: 1. How will app ownership be affected by this change? Will apps disappear because the original purchaser is no longer logged in on the iPad?\n\nApps won't disappear. You can combine apps on the same device from different Apple ID's. Just switch Apple ID in the App Store at the bottom of the screen and download an app. The only downside is having to type different passwords when updates are available.\n2. Will saved progress disappear when a new Apple ID takes over the iPad? Or does progress remain saved on the iPad hard drive?\n\nProgress remains. Game Center achievements might not, though they are in the cloud anyway. If you want to take the app data from the old Apple ID to a different device, make sure iCloud is on with app data enabled.\n3. What will happen to achievements in Gamecenter? Will they update to where they were when the new Apple ID launches a game that has already been there for years?\n\nThat depends on the game. Often they won't, as they're linked to the other Apple ID and the game mostly won't check if past achievements have been entered into Game Center. The achievements will remain on the old Apple ID, as stated in answer #1.\nSummary: app data is often stored in iCloud and always on the device, so don't worry about losing progress. You might lose achievements, though they remain on the old Apple ID and as they don't align to your game progress anymore it will be a bit messy.\n", "Q: In family sharing, can non-organizers make purchases on their own? In family sharing, can non-organizers make purchases with their own credit card?  And will those purchases be private or shared?\n\nA: Non-organizers cannot make purchases with a credit card separate than the account owner.\nHowever, gift card credit is kept separate for each account. If a non-organizer loads a gift card, that non-organizer's purchases will come from that balance, while the other family sharing members' purchases will not.\n\nA: No, if you want to make purchases with a personal payment method then a separate Apple ID will need to be created or Family Sharing left.\n", "Q: how can I add photos from an external drive to the new Photos I have a large library of old photos stored on my External Hard Drive (EHD). I would like t bring these old photos into Photos (Mac OS X Yosemite). How can I do this, what's the best way to do this?\n\nA: Open the Photos app, go File -> Import, and navigate to the folder with the photos.\nIf the photos can't be imported using the Import feature in Photos and are in an iPhoto library, you could first open the library with iPhoto, go File -> Export, and export the originals. They could then be imported using the Photos app.\n", "Q: Character encoding in Safari Mobile I've developped a website using JSF, which is accessed by Safari mobile running on Iphone 5C.\nMost of the Iphones behave correctly, send the text encoded as it should, but on one of them, text is badly encoded.\nExemple: \"Début\" is written \"DÃ©but\" (it's french)\nI suspect one of the user changed the settings on the Iphone.\nWhat setting could it be, and how can you change it back ?\nEDIT:\nThe website is rendered correctly, the problem arise when the user type text in a textbox and submit it to the server.\n\nA: You could set the header to display UTF-8.

I am also open to other software or web app suggestions.\n\nA: Try using the Terminal!\nType: \nsips -r 5 --padColor FFFFFF test.pdf \n\nWhere 5 is the degrees, FFFFFF is for white (the background) and test.pdf is your pdf. To more easily use this, try only typing sips -r 5 --padColor FFFFFF and then drag a file on the terminal.\nEdit: as user3439894 correctly points out this only works for single page pdf's and overwrites the original. You can append --out newname.pdf to the orginal command to create a new file instead. With a multipage document you could also export single pages, run the command on individual pages and then combine them again, though that will take some effort.\n", "Q: Does Mac keeps a history of all actions I have done with files/folders similar to terminal? 2 days ago I accidentally deleted my work folder which include many projects aI have worked on them for last 2 weeks and I didn't packed them up at all.\nI used Dr.Cleaner to clean up \"un-wanted\" files, but it seems (i don't remember exactly) I deleted many files permanently and my work folder is one of them. \nAfter that I used my computer for many operations (read/delete/add/copy and past files and folders), for about 12 hours until, I discovered the sad news. \nUnfortunately I didn't use Time Machine, I didn't backup manually at all, and I didn't have any software installed prior deletion to help me to recover what I have lost.\nI stopped doing any internal operations (mentioned above) to avoid overwrite the physical part on my hard drive (hoping to recover that area using 3rd part software).\nRight now I'm using \"Wondershare Data Recover\", \"Stellar Phoenix Mac Data Recovery\" and \"Disk Drill\" to recover what I have lost, but nothing promising yet.\nI don't know if I just gave up and accept the fact my work file is gone.

Does it have one?\nLast thing, after all of that, do I still have a chance to recover my lost folder??\nThanks!\n\nA: To your first question:\nYes it does keep record of lots of stuff--lots of records.\nOpen the Console log and have fun looking through it.\nTo your other questions:\nOnly if you realize the mistake immediately some stuff is recoverable.\nIt also depends how full your disk is (theoretically), so the deleted information would not be immediately overwritten.\n", "Q: Rebooting a Mac with a frozen application I have just realized I do not know how OS X manages applications.\nToday Google Chrome froze on my OS X Yosemite 10.10.2. After it froze, I simply quit it using \"Force quit\". I have even sent a report to Apple.\nThe Dock kept showing it as 'running', but clicking on \"Force quit\" did not have any effect. I restarted both the Finder and the Dock, but Chrome kept showing as 'running'. However, no process reminding me of 'Chrome' was listed in Activity Monitor or in ps aux in a Terminal.\nSo I decided to restart my machine and it was embarrassing:\n\nSo I was rebooting because Chrome was not responding, but my machine refused to reboot because I had to quit Google Chrome first, which was not among the running processes. Luckily, Apple has not yet removed the power button from their laptops.\nWhen does this happen? Which \"lock\" file do I need to remove for telling OS X that a 'running' application is in reality not running?\nPS. Isn't this a MS Windows 95-like behaviour? What a pity...\n\nA: In the very rare occasion this has happened to me in the past, I started fiddling around with dtrace scripts to know what's going on. One ready to use script is opensnoop.\nSo, the next time you hit this issue, toy around with it as follows:\n$ sudo opensnoop -ve\n\nor limiting the output to what you'd expect:\n$ sudo opensnoop -ve | grep -i chrome\n\nShort-lived processes might not show up in your ps output, so another option is to us the function boundary tracing framework available to dtrace. Most probably, your OSX version will have simple entry points defined for the VFS layer (call it dump_vfs.d):\n#!/usr/sbin/dtrace -s\n\n#pragma D option quiet\n#pragma D option switchrate=10hz\n\ndtrace:::BEGIN {\n    printf(\"%-12s %6s %6s %-12.12s %-12s %s\\n\", \"TIME(ms)\", \"UID\",\n        \"PID\", \"PROCESS\", \"CALL\", \"DIR/FILE\");\n}\n\nfbt::VNOP_CREATE:entry,\nfbt::VNOP_REMOVE:entry {\n    this->path = ((struct vnode *)arg0)->v_name;\n    this->name = ((struct componentname *)arg2)->cn_nameptr;\n    printf(\"%-12d %6d %6d %-12.12s %-12s %s/%s\\n\",\n        timestamp / 1000000, uid, pid, execname, probefunc,\n        this->path != NULL ? stringof(this->path) : \"<null>\",\n        stringof(this->name));\n}\n\nCalling it is similar to above:\n$ sudo dtrace -s dump_vfs.d\n\nA functionally close feat can be achieved by the fs_usage command, especially if you suspect said process to be hanging in an event loop, though still accessing the fs layer using system calls.\nThis might be a bit of an overkill, since the most pragmatic choice is probably hitting the power button. Since you mentioned that you sent a report to Apple, you might want to check it out again under the following locations:\n~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/\n/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/\n\nThis should give you additional pointers as to why said application crashed in such a way.\nYour curiosity with regard to the OS handling such situations can probably be partially quenched by looking into the XNU kernel sources at bsd/kern/kern_shutdown.c. At some point, the shutdown process initiated via Finder will run into a timeout, which then logs the attempts of failed SIGTERM (extract from my local version 2782.1.97 copy of the Darwin kernel sources):\n    [...]\n    for (p = allproc.lh_first; p; p = p->p_list.le_next) {\n        if (p->p_shutdownstate == 1) {\n            printf(\"%s[%d]: didn't act on SIGTERM\\n\", p->p_comm, p->p_pid);\n            sd_log(ctx, \"%s[%d]: didn't act on SIGTERM\\n\", p->p_comm, p->p_pid);\n        }\n    }\n    [...]\n\nThis indicates that the Console application might show you the relevant log entries. Depending on a potential live lock situation regarding a file held on a network mounted partition which just lost its layer 1 signal, the kernel will enter a wait loop of 100 to 200 seconds, depending on some VFS mount timeout settings. \nAs a sidenote: I had very little joy stability-wise with Chrome on my MBP, mainly because I believe recent updates to the nvidia core driver inside OSX >= 10.9 together with elevated power management functionalities and now appnap, combined with recent advances in the shockwave plugin management of said browser, repeatedly caused havoc. On top of that, Chrome in 2014 for me was the most power hungry of all browsers.\nThere are probably half a dozen more scenarios as to why you were greeted with this unmotivated feedback GUI. None of which come even remotely close to the issues you briefly referred to by mentioning Win95 :).\nJust hit the power button, already! \n", "Q: If iMessage is off, and someone sends a message as iMessage, will she be able to receive it once she turn iMessage on? My friend doesn't have an Apple ID so she uses mine sometimes to just download apps. But me and my mom were talking about some really private stuff and we're using iMessage since she's living in another city so we don't have much time to see each other and talk about this. My friend never activated the iMessage feature on her settings, but if she does turn it on she might use my Apple ID right? \nMy question is, once she turns it on, can she receive those messages me and my mom sent to each other? Assuming that the time while me and my mom were chatting, the iMessage feature on her phone is still off. \n\nA: No. The messages will only pull through from the point iMessage is turned on. Only in a situation where iMessage is turned on but the computer is unable to receive them (sleep, offline, etc) will it backload messages.\n", "Q: Why isn't Finder updating a folder's contents? Today I had the strange behavior that I added some files to a folder in Finder (that happens to be in dropbox) from Outlook, but Finder did not show them.  I could see them from the Open File dialog of Outlook and of Adobe Acrobat Pro XI, but returning to Finder, still not there.  Hitting the F5 key to force a refresh, still nothing.  Finally, I forced Finder to quit and relaunch, and they showed up.  This is OS X Yosemite v10.10.2.\nWhat is going on?  Why would Finder not show the new files until forced to restart?\n\nA: I've known it happen if memory was being paged heavily, or if a drive was particularly full. \nF5 has no effect on a Mac, btw, it's a Windows command.\nThe only real equivalent - to a system that really ought to never need to be refreshed under normal circumstances - is to switch view style…\n…from list to column then back again, for instance…\n Cmd ⌘   3  then  Cmd ⌘   2  \n", "Q: VMB (Vodafone Mobile Broadband) without Java I have a VMB key that I use with a SIM card to connect my MacBook to the Internet while mobile.\nRecently I've formatted my Mac and I decided to avoid installing Java. No problem until I tried to install latest VMB software: it's based on Java!\nAre there some alternative softwares independent from Java?\n\nA: Luckily, there is usually a way to avoid installing Java while still using your mobile internet dongle.\nThe software they bundle with these devices is based on Java because it is multi-platform. They code one app to handle the functionality and deploy it. However, the drivers (for Windows) and kexts (for Mac) are not based on Java and use native code.\nYou need to ask yourself a question: do I need the SMS and extra functionality that their software provides? If the answer is no, then you can set up the device in the Network preference pane manually and avoid using their software (and thus avoid installing Java) at all.\nIf you have run the package installer they provided to you, great. If not, run it now. This should install the kext (and the horrid software) in to /System/Library/Extensions. You may find you get a pop-up notification when you do this telling you a new network interface has been found.\nOpen \"System Preferences\" and click on \"Network\" to open up your network settings and there should be an extra interface listed on the left named something similar to \"Vodafone Mobile Broadband\" or \"Huawei\" (depending on the make of the device). If not, click the \"+\" and add it to your interfaces.\nSelect the interface and on the right-hand pane you should see a few fields there; one for \"Number\", one for \"Username\" and one for \"Password\". Generally, these are consistent across all networks, but if the settings I provide here don't work then get hold of your service provider and they should give them to you.\nUnder \"Number\" type '*#99#' and leave username and password blank. Then, click the \"Advanced\" button to open the advanced overlay, and under \"Modem\" select the brand of the device that you have (it should be listed at the bottom). Leave the rest of the settings as they are, usually the defaults are correct, and simply change the APN to \"internet\". This is the one variable that will probably cause the most hassle as I know that at least here in South Africa each network has deviated from the standard \"internet\" now with the addition of LTE.\nClick all the \"OK\"s and \"Apply\"s to save the settings and, with the device plugged in, click \"Connect\". If all the settings are correct (and hopefully they are) then you should connect to the network and be able to browse. If not, then get hold of your service provider and ask them for the correct APN and dial settings.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Network Ports Used To Print (Network LPD Printing) I have been experimenting with an application that listens to network ports below 1024. \nI discovered that when that application is running, an attempt to print to a network printer (set up to print using LPD) will get stuck at \"Printing - Connecting to printer\". To be clear, the client is running the test application listening to sockets below 1024 and can't send print jobs to an LPD-enabled print server.\nI've tried configuring the test application to not listen to ports 631 and 515, but still the print job gets stuck. Killing the test application allows printing to work fine.\nMy question is: when trying to print to a network print server using LPD, what ports below 1024 have a printing-related process connect to them? I want to \"whitelist\" them from the test application so printing works while the test application runs.\nThis is being done on OS X 10.10.3\n\nA: You will want to try excluding ports TCP 721-731 as these tend to be the source ports for printing.

I need to know if I can select some text and copy it, and then paste it on an Apple Watch.\n\nA: No, there is no such functionality on Apple Watch as standard as there are no text fields for entering text other than dictation.\n\nA: I realize that this question has already been answered, but I wanted to contribute something I've found useful on the topic.\nWhile you may not be able to copy or paste at the time, there have been many efforts to create keyboards for Apple Watch. For example, a rather intuitive one (though it's not available on the Apple Watch yet) is Lunate, which uses a circular typing interface. There's also Weboard, which is still in development, but plans to use motion sensors to change which row of the keyboard you're viewing when you tilt your wrist, displaying one row at a time.\nThose apps aim to be keyboards independently, but there are a host of apps on the App Store that have functionalities like texting and searching the web while offering keyboards, no matter how intuitive. Try tinynote for jotting down notes, WatchWeb for web browsing, Next for Twitter, and eyeFree Messenger for texting. Most options are based on either Morse Code or a list of letters that you scroll through with the Digital Crown.\n", "Q: iTunes keeps opening on its own I'm using OS X 10.10 and my iTunes (version 12.1.2.x) keeps opening. the only behavior pattern I could observe seemed really bizarre - It would open when I would click in my Firefox window. I retested many times, but I couldn't reproduce this after I removed my headphones.\nI checked for anything suspicious in /private/var/log/system.log. I didn't see any odd interactions between Spotify and iTunes (i.e. an event in one that led to an immediate event in the other when looking at timestamps). The only thing sort of suspicious were these logs (there were many of these entries) from iTunes when I wasn't using it at all:\n/private/var/log/system.log:Apr 24 11:12:06 ITADMINs-MacBook-Pro-4.local iTunes[8626]: ### PlayQueue::StartPlayingNextInternal: played off the end of the queue\n/private/var/log/system.log:Apr 24 11:18:37 ITADMINs-MacBook-Pro-4.local iTunes[8680]: ### PlayQueue::StartPlayingNextInternal: played off the end of the queue\n\nWhat could be happening?\n\nA: WOW I finally figured this out. \nTampering with the audio jack will cause this to happen. I have headphones with the play/pause/skip control button, so the issue might not show up with standard headphones. If I tap (or double tap) the headphones where it is connected to the jack, the effect is the same as if I clicked the remote button that was designed to control playback.\nWhat's happening is my movement is jarring the headphones and even a very slight tug will open iTunes and start playing music. Very frustrating when I'm using my headset for a phone call!\n\nA: You can solve this by running this in the terminal:\nlaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rcd.plist\nThis will disable all remote controllers however.\nMore on this:\nhttps://medium.com/@gerswayne/stop-itunes-from-auto-opening-control-spotify-with-your-headphones-and-realize-all-of-your-dreams-63b3637d645e\n\nA: A nice app I found to stop this behavior is noTunes. It will run in the background and prevent iTunes from launching. It can be disabled in one click to make iTunes accessible again.\n", "Q: Recovering texts from iCloud I lost my iPhone 4 and really need my text messages.  I always backed up everything to iCloud.  I don't have a new phone, but I do have a computer.  \nHow can I go to iCloud and recover my texts?  \n\nA: If your computer is a new enough Mac, if it has Messages.app installed, that should contain all your iMessages.\nIf you have a PC, I believe there are some programs that can extract your messages from your iPhone backups.\n", "Q: VLC video doesn't play in main window After upgrading to 2.2.1, VLC videos plays in a separate window, but I want the controls to be in the same window as the video (just the way it was before I upgraded).\nAm I missing something?\n\n\nA: Yep they changed it.\nNow there is no more within the Video screen popup controls, unless you are in full screen mode.\nOption is to use the media keys on your keyboard, or right click to control it.\nNot sure I like the change.\n\nA: don't ask me how cos i really hardly understand these things, but i fiddled about for a bit and suddenly it worked. maybe this screensave can help\n", "Q: How do I copy a Mac volume using cp? I have researched this for hours. In Single User Mode, I used:\ncp -Rpvn /* /Volumes/MyBackup\n\nMy external USB is mounted on /Volumes/MyBackup\nThe issue however is that after 24hrs it still has not stopped copying 300GB of data to an external USB drive. I think it is having issues with symbolic links such as the /Volumes/MacHD volume also having a /Volumes/MacHD and /Volumes/MyBackup I am not sure about this however.\nHow do I copy a Mac volume using cp? Is cp -Rpvn /* /Volumes/MyBackup correct?\n\nA: If you want to make a faithful copy of the filesystem contents, avoid using cp.  Instead, use the ditto(1) command, which preserves hard links, file permissions, resource forks, and HFS metadata.  Unlike cp, ditto is meant to preserve as much of that information as possible by default.\nIt's just a matter of running sudo ditto src dest.\n\nA: Use rsync for this purpose since cp cannot faithfully reproduce all the files that exist on OS X. The benefits of rsync over ditto and cp are:\n\n\n*\n\n*interrupted transfers can restart easily with very little cost. \n\n*restarts even resume part way through a large file. \n\n*file exclusion and --dry-run allow easy testing and iterative thinning.\n\n\nThe simplest way to use rsync and preserve most things (permissions, symlinks, edit dates, etc) is to use the -a or --archive flag to archive. To see your progress use -P or --progress\nRsync works as:\nrsync options source destination\n\nIn your case I would recommend the following:\nrsync --archive --verbose --one-file-system --human-readable --progress /from/ /to\n\nOr in short:\nrsync -avxhP /from/ /to\n\nMind the lack of trailing slash in the /to location.\nsee comments for more useful flags\n\nA: You forgot to make an exclude-files list, and are likely copying things that can't / shouldn't be copied, including bottomless files like /dev/random.\nWhile cp can do the job, there are better tools. Rsync is one, Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper is another. To use a kitchen analogy, you are using a knife to open a can. Rsync is a can opener, Carbon Copy Cloner is an electric can opener. I use rsync regularly, but the settings needed to copy a running operating system are sufficiently complex I've never bothered to do it all myself.\n cp -Rpvn /* /Volumes/MyBackup \n\nIt looks like all you want to do is make a backup. Your Mac includes Time Machine expressly for this purpose. Open System Preferences -> Time Machine, choose the external disk, turn it on and then leave it alone. It works very well and requires under a minute of your time.\n\nA: You can create a time Time Machine backup from the command line with tmutil, the Time Machine utility. You can set a destination then order a manual backup.\nTo set the Time Machine backup volume:\n\nsudo tmutil setdestination /Volumes/MyBackup\n\nThen start the backup:\n\ntmutil startbackup --auto\n\nThe --auto flag will try to treat it as an ordinary time scheduled backup.\nOnce you have your Time Machine backup, you can then re-install OS X on your Mac, then import all of your files from the Time Machine backup.\n", "Q: What does the \"cancel\" icon in the volume prompt mean? I connected my earphone and when I tried to change the volume, I got a prompt like\n\nExcept that there was a small \"cancel\" icon in it (like this). I could not change the volume. I had to unplug and plug again the earphone.\nWhat does that mean?\nOSX Yosemite. Macbook Pro Retina Display, Mid 2014 model.\n\nA: It means that you cannot change the volume for the selected output device. For example, if you connect your mac to a TV using a HDMI cord, you will not be able to control the TV's volume with your mac. You'll have to use the TV's remote instead.\nThis shouldn't ever happen when you connect something into the headphone jack though. Perhaps you have a faulty set of headphones?\n\nA: It means that you cannot control volume for that output device.\nUsually I solve this issue going into sound preference panel and changing the output device to speakers and back to headphones. \nNow your volume control should work as expected. \n", "Q: AppStore formatting is broken My Macbook, Version 10.9.5 Build 13F1077, AppStore is somehow broken. It's like the formatting of it is broken. See attached image. Any idea's about what happened or how to troubleshoot or fix?\n\nAs a follow up to inquiries from @d-w @thomas-jones, yes, I am seeing bad formatting on some other Apple web pages. For example: \n\n\nA: Try opening Terminal and entering the following command to enable the App Store Debug menu:\n\ndefaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool YES\n\nThen, quit the App Store (if it was already open), and relaunch it. You should see a new menu after the Help menu labeled Debug. Open it and select Reset Application. \nIf that doesn't solve your problem, you might need to flush the DNS cache, the commands are listed below.\nYosemite:\nsudo discoveryutil mdnsflushcache\n\nLion, Mountain Lion and Mavericks: sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\n\nSnow Leopard: sudo dscacheutil -flushcache\n(to remove the debug menu from the App Store, enter the same command above used to enable it, and change the end from YES to NO.)\n\nA: I finally figured it out. In Keychain Access, I selected Preferences, then Reset my Default Keychain. After doing that, I restarted AppStore and it was working normally.\nWarning You may loose other passwords stored in the Keychain, so make sure you have a backup of them\n\nA: In case anyone's stylesheet is being blocked by a proxy, Apple seems to host the Mac App Store stylesheet at \"s.mzstatic.com\". I used the debug menu to download the page source and find out where the stylesheets were being hosted.\nSo, if you're facing network issues, ask your network admin to unblock *s.mzstatic.com* and you should be good to go.\n\nA: NO.. NO.. No, Nothing to do, It is purely CSS failure on server side on part of apple servers. Look at Apple discussions. Majority or All Macs upto sierra are affected and since these are Obsolete pieces as per apple..they are solving. Wait and watch...\n\nA: Try resetting your computer's Date and Time, the settings are located in Apple Menu > System Preferences > Data & Time. If the \"Set date and time automatically:\" checkbox is enabled, disable it, and manually set the time and date correctly. \nTry loading the App Store again.\n", "Q: Keep bootable backup with rsync I've ditched Carbon Copy Cloner now that it went commercial, well I felt guilty about using a closed source application anyways. \nWhat rsync options do you prefer when maintaining your bootable backups? \nrsync -avhHXR --delete --progress --hfs-compression --protect-decmpfs --stats --exclude=/Volumes / /Volumes/Backup\n\nJust by way of explanation : Any large recursive backup wants the archive option -a of course.  And ideally the -H option for hard-links.  We need -R and --exclude=/Volumes since we're using / as the source.  We want --delete to delete files not present on the source.  All the option -vh, --progress, and --stats only impact the display. And -X, --hfs-compression, and --protect-decmpfs preserve various HFS+ features.  \nAdd a -n for testing before running the actual backup of course.\nJust a few questions : \nIn Linux, you might want -S for sparse files, but afaik HFS+ lacks sparse files anyways.  I'd leave out -A too since HFS+ lacks acls too.  I presume that's correct?\nAre there any benefits to --inplace?  Would it reduce wear?  It's slightly risky if the transfer breaks perhaps.  It conflicts with -S in Linux, btw.\nAm I missing anything particularly useful here?  \nAnything about making a new disk bootable that isn't bootable already?\n\nA: Just found an open source backup script Counterpart (jedda.me) which does exactly this, seemingly does stuff CCC misses too. \n", "Q: How can I download a newer Yosemite installer? I have an existing Yosemite installer app from the original release of 10.10 (e.g. Install OS X Yosemite.app) but can't seem to download a newer installer.  When I click Download, I'm presented with this dialog:\n\nHowever, clicking Continue doesn't appear to do anything.  No update appears to be in progress, no network activity shows in Activity Monitor.\nThe same dialog appears if I click the Download button in Purchases, and the download never begins.\nHow can I get an updated installer?\n\nA: The problem appears to have been my copy of the installer that I had stashed away in a folder in my home directory, even though I'd originally made it by keeping a copy of the installer in /Applications (it was even owned by my user account instead of root!).\nOnce I removed that installer, the Mac App Store was happy to start the download for a new one.\n\nA: I've seen this happen to a few people - it seems that the system is thinking in doublespeak - believing 2 things at the same time; that you need 10.10.3 but that you already have 10.10.3\nMost times, this is resolved by downloading & installing the 10.10.3 combo updater, directly from Apple's Knowledge Base - https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1804\nThis will make sure you have all updated components since 10.10.0\n", "Q: Can I use a Early 2011 MacBook Pro 13\" charger with my Late 2013 MacBook Pro 13\" with the MagSafe Adapter? I bought a Early 2011 MacBook Pro 13\" but eventually upgraded to a newer Retina Late 2013 13\" model.  I'd like to get another charger, but I'm curious if I could use the old charger that came with that laptop with this new one if I buy the MagSafe to MagSafe 2 adapter.  They both use a 60W adapter, so I don't see a reason why they shouldn't work.\n\nA: Simple answer-- yes you can! there should be no any problems.\n", "Q: Lost/blocked my credit card, can't buy any apps because of billing info I lost (and locked) my credit card. Now whenever I want to buy an app from the iOS store, the transaction fails. What can I do to prevent this?\n\nA: From iTunes on your Mac: click on user icon on the top bar () > Account informations -> type your password -> billing information then remove your old card and insert your new card.\nFrom iPhone: App Store -> scroll bottom -> Apple ID: your mail -> Show Apple ID type your password -> billing information then remove your old card and insert your new card.\n", "Q: On Mac OSX Yosemite why does my computer download 500MB every day whether I am using it or not? I have Mac OSX Yosemite, 10.10.1 and halfway through last month my computer decided to download about 500MB every day. I even quit all programs and it still downloaded 447MB.\nI am seeing this number in the network section of Activity Monitor and the Process name listed is nsurlsessiond. What is this downloading and how do I stop it?\n\nA: nsurlsessiond deals with iCloud & also Spotlight.\n\n\n*\n\n*for Spotlight - Prefs > Spotlight > Search Results & switch off Spotlight Suggestions & Bing Web Searches.\n\n*iCloud, some suggestions…\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable iCloud Photo Library, Photo Stream & iCloud Photo Sharing from\nSystem prefs > iCloud - Photos [or equivalent, I can't remember the precise layout before Photos app]\n\n*If you have an iPhone, the same settings are in Settings > iCloud > Photos \n\nA: nsurlsessionhd can be disabled with \nsudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.nsurlsessiond.plist \nBUT you run the risk of some Apple (and maybe non-Apple) apps not being able to connect to the internet, specifically App Store, iTunes, software updater, etc. If that is the case re-enable by replacing unload with load in the command above.\n", "Q: Health data keeps disappearing without reason I'm using an iPhone 5 (running iOS 8.3) and update my health data manually with 'add data' feature. However in some mornings when I open health application, all data seems missing. Charts, dashboard settings, everything. Like I opened for the first time. If I reset or restart my phone, data comes back.\nHas anyone experienced this? If yes, is there a solution to keep it from happening?\nUpdate: I didn't restart my phone intentionally and my dashboard is still empty.\nUpdate 2: Issue is not happening for some time now. May close the question with some answer soon.\nUpdate 3: Still present with iOS 9.0.1 upto some extent. I'm starting to think it's a bug and slowly being ironed out.\nUpdate 4: Still happens with iOS 9.1, however less frequently. Let's wait and see what iOS 9.2 brings.\n\nA: Give it an hour then open it again.\nFor some reason, it can take a long time to catch up. \nDon't try to force it - I did that once in the early days & lost about 3 weeks of data - which replaced itself with a marathon 79,000 steps in one day, then 20 days of no info.\nI've noticed it is a lot better since iOS 8.3, in fact, I'd forgotten it used to do it until your post reminded me.\n\nA: Just switch off your phone, and then on.. All data will be back...\n", "Q: Can't Delete iTunes Content I have a MacBook Pro running the latest version of Yosemite and the most up to date version of iTunes.\nWhen opening iTunes up it shows that I have 6 songs, I've tried to delete these songs multiple times by right clicking, pressing 'show in finder' and then moving them to the trash, but they still won't disappear from iTunes no matter what I do. I've even removed the caches folder but no luck even after restarting.\n\nA: Removing them from your hard drive has no bearing on whether they show up in iTunes. You have to actually remove them from iTunes, too. (Right-click > Delete or Edit menu > Delete while the song is highlighted) The (nearly) only time iTunes knows whether a file in the iTunes library actually exists on the hard drive is when you try to play it.\nAlso, if you use the above method, it will offer to remove the song from your hard drive at the same time it is removing it from iTunes.\n", "Q: Preinstalled audio, photo and video data size Have recently purchased new MacBook Pro 13″ 2015 (128 GB) and noticed that \"About my Mac\" displays 1.31 Gb Audio, 750 Mb photo and 410 Mb Films. Does it mean that someone else stored this data on the notebook or it's preinstalled data by the manufacturer?\n\nA: It could quite easily be Garage Band, if not other app data too. My Garage Band folder at /Library/Application Support/GarageBand is actually 4.8 GB\nSource: Delete GarageBand to Save Precious Gigabytes of Mac Storage\n\nAs a rich media application, GarageBand installs relatively large groups of media files to several locations on your Mac’s drive. Based on a clean install of GarageBand 10.0.2 on OS X 10.9.3, key locations of large files include:  \n/Applications/GarageBand.app (1.16GB)\n/Library/Application Support/GarageBand (995MB)\n/Library/Application Support/Logic (880MB)\n/Library/Audio/Apple Loops (up to 10GB)*  \n*Note that the size of the Apple Loops directory will vary depending on the number and type of loops downloaded by the user. You should not delete this folder (or the Logic folder) if you are using Logic Pro.\nUnder normal circumstances, however, users looking to delete GarageBand can expect to save around 3GB of space. It may not seem like much, especially as storage capacities continue to rise, but 3GB can make a huge difference for those with small SSDs.\n\n\nA: Not having a fresh out-of-the-box MacBook on hand, I can only assume it's data from apps like iMovie or Garageband or Pages and Keynote. OS X could be computing the data those apps have as photos and audio and video. Background images might also be included. \n", "Q: Photos for OS X: How to generate album automatically at import In iPhoto I relied heavily on the events feature. I had about 100 events. In Photos for OS X I'm totally ok with the new albums that replaces events somehow. But I am looking to automatically create an album of the pictures I import.\nIn iPhoto you could drag a folder into the program and it automatically created an event with the name of the dragged folder. Is there some similar mechanism to automatically create an album? The only way I found to create the similar behaviour is to drag a folder to Photos for OS X, import all of the photos, go over to the last imported section and create an album out of these images. Is there a better workflow?\nThanks in advance for any ideas.\nEdit: I read the question here (Events or Albums in Photos for OSX) but it doesn't help me very much unfortunately.\n\nA: There's no way to do this in Photos, at least differently than what you're already doing.\nAlso, just as an aside - if you intend to use iCloud Photo Library and sync with a device, replacing events with albums will very quickly become unmanageable. Apps (outside of the iOS Photos app) do not necessarily sort them by anything useful, and do not respect folder structure, from what I've seen. I'm currently going through my \"albums\" (that Photos created from my iPhoto events) and tagging them with keywords and/or descriptions, then removing the album. It's impossible to find anything in (for example) Facebook Messenger's photo chooser with 500 albums. The keywords won't carry over to iOS, but at least I can use Moments to somewhat recreate the Events feature.\n\nA: I use the following AppleScript to import folders into albums. It only does one folder at a time [1] but even so that's a lot easier than doing it by hand in Photos.\n[1] Because folders with large numbers of images can be slow to process in Photos and sometimes the script will timeout waiting for Photos to finish. With one folder this is not a problem as it will still have been imported completely.\n(*\n    Imports a folder of images into Photos into an album named after the folder.\n    Whether the images are copied or aliased depends upon your Photos preferences.\n    No error checking!!\n*)\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    activate\n    choose folder with prompt \"Please choose a folder to import into Photos as an album:\"\n    set theFolderToImport to the result\n    set theFoldersName to the name of theFolderToImport\n    set thePhotosToImport to the files of theFolderToImport\n    set thePhotosToImportAsAliases to {}\n    repeat with b in thePhotosToImport\n        set a to b as alias\n        set the end of thePhotosToImportAsAliases to a\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\ntell application \"Photos\"\n    activate\n    delay 2\n    set theNewAlbum to make new album named theFoldersName\n    import thePhotosToImportAsAliases into theNewAlbum with skip check duplicates\nend tell\n\n\nA: I just wrote a small Apple Script to import folders and their subfolders as folders and albums into Photos.

You probably need El Capitan to have it work correctly.\n\nA: I will answer in German to allow all Germans to find this wonderful solution, which helped me to import all my Folders\nThank you very much a great solution:\n https://github.com/codez/ImportPhotoFolders.\nWer bislang ein Programm gesucht hat, welches die Ordner und Unterordner vom Finder mit allen Bildern nach Fotos importiert der soll bitte die Lösung benutzen: https://github.com/codez/ImportPhotoFolders.\ndas hat bei mir wunderbar funktioniert.\n", "Q: how long does it take to synch across devices I've imported 1,000 photos into Photos on my Mac, and my settings are \"Store in iCloud\", it is over an hour since I did the import and when I log into iCloud.com via Safari I can see the photos there in Photos however they do not show on my iPhone 6 (logged into the same iCloud account) which has iOS 8.3 and uses Photos. I wonder how long does it take to synch to my devices or is there another step I need to take to get it to synch.\n\nA: I am seeing the iCloud Photo Library syncing getting faster in iOS 11, even with my backup phone iPhone 5s. \nPrior to iOS 11, it takes as soon as several hours, and up to days for the new photos to show up on all my devices. And at that time, it needs WiFi connection for the sync to happen. **The feature is designed the way that plugging into power and connected to WiFi triggers syncing. **\nBut in iOS 11, the photos even sync on cellular (but limited, eg. videos excluded). And the photos show up on all my other devices almost instantaneously - within minutes. (And my home and office WiFi is upgraded at all)\nTo conclude, to make the syncing faster:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update to iOS 11 (it really helps with the photo syncing process)\n\n*Plug the device to power\n\n*Connect to good WiFi\n\n*Suspend other network heavy applications such as App Store Updates. \n\n\nA: Apple advertise the sync as \"instantaneous\"; however, doesn't state what time it takes to sync photos between devices.\nI have 7 devices and so far haven't found any obvious pattern with regards to syncing time. It varies from device to device, from network to network and from OS version to OS version.\nWhat I found is that newer doesn't necessary mean quicker.\nFrom my experience - it could take between minutes and days for photos to appear on the device.\nIf you have iCloud Photo Library turned on, then there are no additional steps needed to sync; however, you can try to force trigger the sync by putting your device into flight mode and back.\nAlso check whether you have enough space on your device. Sometimes it prevents photos from being synced if you have less than 300MB available on it.\n", "Q: Mac mini crashing multiple times a day My Mac mini keeps crashing multiple times a day.

You could try to remove devices like external bluetooth dongles or external wifi adapters for a while to see if it keeps crashing, and if you find the device causing it perhaps look for different drivers. I hope this helps you find the cause more quickly, as crash reports are hard to read and often incomplete.\n", "Q: Copy an iPhone's disk contents (filesystem) to a computer I like to get a clear view at how an iPhone's file system. Especially in the case of damaged data.\nApart from using a professional (and costly) data recovery service, what other ways do exist to transfer (dump) the disk data from an iPhone to a computer.\nIn particular, what options are there when the disk data is damaged to the point that it can't boot iOS any more, i.e. when the iPhone is in recovery mode but can not reboot, even with a tool such as iRecovery).\nI am not looking into breaking into someone else's data here. Assume that I know the iPhone locking password (I understand that this user-settable code is not the actual encryption key, but I hope that there is a way to get to the key when knowing the password).\nI am quite proficient with low level disk formats (partitions, HFS, etc.), for instance, I've written a disk editor (iBored), that's why I like to look at what's actually stored on the disk.\n\nA: One way to copy the data is to jailbreak the iOS device, then using a terminal program on the device or log in via ssh from a remote computer, then copy the data with the dd command, as explained here. But that only works if\n\n\n*\n\n*The iOS is bootable and\n\n*The iOS can be jailbroken.\n\n\nSo, this is not the answer I am looking for but it's still an option that fits the above question, somewhat.\n", "Q: Is it bad to store a mac on top of a windows laptop due to the magnetic power cord? I have a Windows Laptop and a MacBook and I like to keep them both in the same place.  Is it bad to stack them on top of each other?\nThis has been asked a couple different times (as in What computer components are currently vulnerable to magnets?), but with nothing explicitly addressing the close proximity of a non-magnetically placed power source right next to a mac.\n\n\nA: Unless the laptop comes from the mid-1980s and has the floppy drive directly below the magnet, no.\nThe components most affected my magnetic fields are the hard disk drive and the CRT display. Laptops haven't had CRT displays for quite a while now, and are largely losing their magnetic storage. If you do have a spinning drive instead of a SSD, the current ones are far less sensitive to external magnetic fields than they used to be: increased capacity -> less sensitivity.\nSo unless you have a massively-powerful rare-earth or electromagnet on the shelf, don't worry about it. The tiny magnet in the power connector won't even be noticed.\n\nA: Stacking them on top of each other does not seem to be a good idea - [see https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/84616].\nI recently placed 2 Dell laptops on top of each other (hinge-to-hinge) and that put my laptop to sleep.\n", "Q: Why doesn't the Apple Watch activity app count the activity recorded on the iPhone? When walking around with the iPhone and not the Apple Watch the iPhone records steps. However when looking at the Apple Watch activity app the previously recorded steps are not shown there. Why is that?\n\nA: The activity recorded on the Apple Watch is separate from the activity recorded on the iPhone. As such each is recorded as a separate source in health.app. Also only activity recorded on the Apple Watch is reflected in activity.app.\nSource: @pbur - Apple Software Engineer\nhttps://twitter.com/wahoo/status/591749264956461058\n", "Q: How do I find and remove compilers on my Mac? Some time ago, I installed Python, LaTeX, C, Perl, Fortran, etc. on my Mac for some college work. I think I used Homebrew to install at least some of them. Now I am not sure how to remove them as I don't can't find where they are. I went to the Library directory but don't know what to look for. \nWhen I go to the Launchpad, I find all of these things regarding LaTeX. I am not sure if all of them are needed. Besides, I am not sure if they are just front end apps.\n\n\nA: Those programs in the image can be removed by moving from Applications to the trash.\nIf you installed something from homebrew, the way of removing is the following:\nbrew list\n\nThis will show you a list of installed formulas. After the list comes to you, you have to select what you need to remove and use the command:\nbrew uninstall <formula>\n\n", "Q: How can I get notifications to show up on my Apple Watch again instead of my iPhone? For a few hours after I set up my Apple Watch, I saw iMessage and other notifications on my watch instead of my iPhone. At some point, however, the notifications started appearing only on my phone; the watch didn’t seem to catch them at all.\nI understand that notifications will go to my phone if I’ve been using my phone recently, but I’m pretty sure I’ve exceeded that threshold. What can I poke or prod so that notifications start coming to my watch again? I’ve already tried restarting both devices and disabling and reenabling Bluetooth on my phone.\n\nA: I restarted my iPhone to try to fix this. Then I took a look at the Messages settings for my iPhone in the Settings app. It turned out that Messages was logged in to the “old version” of my Apple ID—a couple of months ago I changed the email address of my Apple ID and Messages was still showing the old one. I logged out and back in, using the new email address this time, and now I’m getting iMessage notifications on my watch again.\nSince these notifications were working initially, though, I’m guessing that the Apple ID mismatch was a red herring and that restarting was what fixed the problem.\n", "Q: Can Not Transfer Voice Memos I can't seem to manage to transfer voice memos from my iPhone. I've read that all I should do is to check the \"Include voice memos\" box in iTunes Music Sync Settings:\n\nOf course, I've synced, re-synced, connected, re-connected, backed-up, re-backed-up my device several times, however, I don't have any \"Voice memos\" playlist appearing in my iTunes library:\n\nThe main reason I want to do this is because Voice Memos seem to be using a lot of space on my device:\n\nI've also read about transferring each individual memo using Air Drop which is great, but not when you have 50+ memos :(\nAnyway, got any ideas, maybe I'm doing something wrong?\nMy set-up is: iPhone 5s with iOS 8.3 & MacBook Pro with OS X 10.10.3 & iTunes 12.1.2.27.\n\nA: I'm assuming you are attributing the 5.93GB to voice memos? That would be about 75 hours of memos. (They use about 2MB per minute.)\n\"Other\" in iTunes is a large catch-all that includes things like mail caches, Safari browsing data, iTunes streaming caches, and more. The best way to identify how much space is being used is on the device itself - Settings app > General > Usage.\nAs far as the Voice Memos not syncing, check on your hard drive under <your username>/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/Voice Memos and make sure they aren't actually there (and just the playlist is missing). If they are not, uncheck the Sync Voice Memos setting, apply your changes, then reboot your phone (hold Home + Sleep until the Apple logo appears) and your Mac, then re-enable the setting.\n\nA: Ok, after spending literally hours on this, I found the answer that worked for me. iTunes did not like the voice memos I had because they were older (by a few months), so someone said to go back to the voice memo in your phone and trim it by any little bit(maybe half a second) second then save it as a new voice recording. It will say \"copy\". then go back to iTunes, click your device at the top right on the menu bar, click music to do sync. The only thing that should be checked off is \"Sync Music\" and \"selected playlists,artists,albums amd genres\". Do NOT check \"include voice memos\". Hit apply or sync at the bottom. When done, click on Music (music note) at the top left corner, then go to Albums and type voice memo in the search and it should come up.THEN,there is a process to turn it into an m4r(ringtone).First go to Edit(top left)>preferences>general>import settings>import using>AAC encoder, click ok.Go back to your file and play it.Then right click and there should \"Create AAC Version\".Click it. Then play the new file.Now you want to make sure that you are dragging the right file to your desktop so right click>get info>file>date modifed and look at the time. Which ever file has the latest time is the one you use.First go to control panel in START menu>folder option>View>Hide extensions for known file types(UNCHECK THIS BOX).Click and drag that file to your desk top. Right click on file and click \"Rename\". Change the \"mra\" to \"m4r and when it asks you if want to change it even though it might be unusable, click yes.Then go back into iTunes and DElETE the AAC version that you made.This was where I got stuck a second time till I found the answer.It's like the other files block the new one.Then go to your desk top and double click on the file and it should come up in tones.You can rename it what you like(right click>get info>details>title-change to what you want>ok)).When you sync it, you have to check it off AND all of the other ringtones that you have on your phone(from iiTunes). If don't have them checked everytime you sync it will remove them from your phone.But once you've checked them they should stay.It seems like alot,but once you do it it's pretty quick.Good Luck\n\nA: I moved the files out of ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/tones into a folder in my home directory then added them back to iTunes.\nAfter that I was able to add them to a playlist.\n\nA: I just tested this and iTunes will sync Voice Memos from the iPhone even with that option unchecked. Checking that will actually sync back Voice Memos to your iPhone. \nCould you try creating a \"Voice Memos\" playlist (that exact casing) and see if it syncs there? Perhaps iTunes is having problems automatically creating that playlist. \nTested on an iPhone 6 with iOS 8.3, OS X 10.10.3, iTunes 12.1.2.27. \n\nA: First select the list of voice memos you want to sync from iPhone in iTunes.\nThen right click to get info. Give the album a new name.\nThen sync again.\nThat works for me!\n", "Q: Is the retina iMac's GPU powerful enough for its huge display? The retina iMac has a display with the huge resolution of 5120x2880. While I'm pretty sure the included GPU (AMD Radeon R9 M290X) must be definitely powerful enough for everyday use, I wonder if under full-screen stress it would still be performant, considering I would also add a second monitor (a normal 1920x1080).\nI mostly use it to develop both 2D and 3D games with Unity, but I'd also like to be able to at least try the Unreal Engine.\nSo, the question is: is this graphic card powerful enough to handle this high res and still have good performance?\n\nA: This is the article you're looking for: The iMac and its 5K display... as a gaming machine? from ArsTechnica.\nNevertheless R9 M9290X is one of the most powerful mobile GPUs on the planet. That should be pretty powerful on development workflows (I'm a UNIX dev too and do development on GPU, mostly for crunching numbers though).\nEdit: 280X was a typo, but I looked to the charts for desktop and mobile parts and 280X and M290X. Frequencies doesn't differ much, but memory bandwidth does. Also texture fill rate is 30% lower, but pixel rates are similar. Processing unit numbers were not directly available, but it looks 20% to 30% slower on real world, not 50%. This doesn't make it smoking hot, we're talking a lot of pixels here, but probably the card wont't be bogged down by the display.\nWhat kind of development work you want to do? Level design? Hi-poly modeling? Engine development? \n\nA: BareFeats shows it outperforming other quad-core Macs in games testing. May not completely answer your question but that site is a good starting point.\n", "Q: Opening a subset of bookmarks in a Bookmark Folder I imported my bookmark folders from Chrome, which I now hate.  How can I open a subset of bookmarks in a folder, but NOT ALL bookmarks in the folder, each in a NEW tab.  I am using Safari 7.1.5 and OS X 10.9.5\n\nA: Which ever way you look through the Bookmarks in Safari, it will offer you the option a sub menu to \"open In Tabs\"\nExample: From the Bookmarks menu bar.\n\n\nA: Break your tabs down into smaller sets using the Bookmarks sidebar.\nYou can add folders, move content etc.\n\n\nA: I do not believe this is possible with Safari. Even opening the Bookmark Editor, where you can select multiple bookmarks at once, gets rid of your selection when you right-click and only chooses the bookmark under your cursor to interact with.\nYou would need to sort your bookmarks manually into the chunks of tabs that you want to open, each in its own folder.\n", "Q: What’s the difference between the “Indoor Walk” and “Indoor Run” workouts? The Apple Watch supports workouts called Indoor Walk, Indoor Run, and Indoor Cycle, and it also has Outdoor versions of these. The Apple Watch User Guide explains that\n\nOutdoor and Indoor Walk/Run/Cycle are distinct workouts because Apple Watch calculates the calorie burn differently for each. For indoor workouts, Apple Watch relies mainly on your heart rate readings for calorie estimates, but for outdoor workouts, Apple Watch works in conjunction with iPhone (which has GPS) to calculate speed and distance.\n\nBut it doesn’t explain the difference between e.g. Indoor Walk and Indoor Run. When I use a treadmill I go for long walks interspersed with some running. Which Indoor workout is more appropriate for tracking this kind of exercise?\n\nA: If it's a mixture of run and walk; go with indoor run. The sensors pick up your jogging stride differently when it knows your running so it will be more accurate when it expects your arms to be in a run position. \n", "Q: Why can't I see thumbnails in the finder? Most of the instructions I've found online (this, for example) say all I have to do is select \"show icon preview\" in the finder view settings.  But that doesn't seem to be working.  What's the problem here?\nThis is OSX 10.8.5.\n\n\nA: A couple of things to try.\nRemove the Finder preferences file. The system will automatically regenerate it. \n\n\n*\n\n*In Finder, press Shift ⇧+Command ⌘+G and enter ~/Library/Preferences.\n\n*Then find com.apple.finder.plist and move it to the Trash. \n\n*Right-click on the Finder icon in the dock and select Relaunch.\n\n\nIf this doesn't work, ensure that JPG files are associated with Preview. To do this, right-click on one of them and choose Get Info. Under the Open With section, select Preview, and then click Change All. You may need to relaunch Finder with this method too.\n\nA: Any chance you have DropBox installed?\nIf so try this:\nGo to /Users/youruser/Library/QuickLook/\nand if there is a DropBoxQL.qlgenerator move it to the trash.\nThen wait 5-10 seconds, and open a folder where previews weren't working.\nDropBox will create a new DropBoxQL.qlgenerator when you login next (either logout/login or on restart) so if you want to prevent DropBox from screwing with your previews again then you'll need to put a dummy file in place.\nIn terminal run:\nsudo touch ~/Library/QuickLook/DropBoxQL.qlgenerator\n\nThis will create an empty file owned by root that DropBox can't overwrite (since DropBox is running as your user when you log in).\nThis hasn't caused any issues I can detect on my Mac Pro (10.11.6) or MacBook Pro (10.12.2) but as always YMMV. \n\nA: From this link: https://www.cnet.com/news/files-in-finder-not-showing-previews/\n\nFrom the Finder's \"View\" menu select \"Show View Options\". Then select the option to \"Show icon preview\" and close the options window.\n\n\nA: When a file is not associated with a specific application, it will not show as Icon.\nTo change that right click on one of those files and select the Get Info, in that window select the Application to use to open, and then select apply to all (Change All).\n\n\nA: This just happened to me and it was fixed by relaunching Finder:\n\n*\n\n*Alt + Right Click Finder in the Dock > Relaunch\n\n*Cmd+Opt+Esc > select Finder > Relaunch\n\n\nA: I spent a lot of time trying all of the suggestions above, but nothing worked.  Finally I just turned the computer off and started it up again.  Now it works.\n\nA: I have OS 10.10.5, and have what sounds like the same problem.\nI can see the icons again if I go into Finder -> View and then set the icons to the larger size.  I can't seem to get the smaller view to work though. \nAfter trying that, I also found that it I go to Finder -> Show View Options, then I can make the font in the finder window slightly larger and then the icons show up correctly.  Then I don't have to make everything as big as the first method makes it. \n", "Q: Can your information security be compromised by opening attachments in Gmail in iOS? I know people can put virus or other dangerous programs in email attachments and send them to you, but is that just for the computer world and not tablets? I mean, if you get such an email to your Gmail account and open it on iPhone for example, is there still a risk of having your information secretly stolen or something?\n\nA: Theoreticly there's always a certain risk since no system is 100% secure. But given the measures Apple took/takes to make iOS as secure as possible that risk is kept rather low. Currently there is no known security hole regarding what you describe. \n", "Q: How to permanently delete text substitutions? How do I permanently delete text substitutions from System Preferences > Keyboard > Text.  I have deleted them several times using the (-) key, but they annoyingly reincarnate themselves after a restart. \n\nA: I have experienced this myself since OS X 10.10.1 and since iOS 8.1.x. I think it is an iCloud syncing bug. Old deleted entries return. Duplicates get created. I haven't attempted to, but I believe the only solution is to contact Apple support. Or wait for it to hopefully resolve itself. \n\nA: Indeed a severe annoyance.  I spent a lot of time on the phone to Apple and no solution was achieved, only \"wait\".  I ended up doing a simultaneous reinstallation of OS X 10.10.3 and my iOS 8 devices and this has apparently made them go away.  I have since upgraded to OS X 10.11 and iOS 9 and they disappeared for several months.  However, they have just come back this AM for no apparent reason on startup.  \n\nA: Do you have any other Apple devices? Text substitutions get shared between all of your iCloud enabled products. I had a shortcut for my email address (backslash plus the word \"email\") that kept triggering all over the place, because iOS and OS X \"helpfully\" ignored the backslash - great when I wanted to plug my actual address in, terrible when \"please email that file\" got turned it into \"please myaddress@domain.com that file\".\nThe only way I was able to kill this was to delete the shortcut from all of my Apple products in quick succession - for me that meant iPhone, MacBook Pro, and iPad. You'll need to have all devices you signed in to using your Apple ID handy to do this. You may have to do it more than once for it to \"stick\". Good luck.\n", "Q: Swap Batteries MacBook Pro & MacBook Unibody My MacBook's (late 2008, unibody, 13\") battery has just become very bad. I also have a MacBook Pro (mid 2012, 15\") which has a still-ok battery. Now, since I take my MacBook (the old one) everywhere I would like it to have a good battery life.\nCan I swap the batteries of the two Macs? I saw that the battery of my old MacBook has 45Wh and the newer one has 77.5Wh, is that going to be a problem?\n\nA: *\n\n*Will you even be able to fit the 15\" MacBook Pro's battery into the 13\" MacBook?\n\n*Messing with power like this only result in broken things. \n\n\nI highly recommend to get a new battery from Apple if it's still available. Or perhaps from a reliable third party. \n", "Q: Creating a Bootable USB drive for a PC on a Macbook I recently had a little mishap on my PC machine and now my HDD is completely cleared. \nI have a 32GB USB, a Windows 8.1 full DVD iso, and my macbook pro 2013 with Yosemite on it. \nI tried using Bootcamp to install Windows 8.1 on my PC but it doesn't launch so I'm assuming that'd only work on a Macbook (for some odd reason). All I get is the annoying flashing underscore thing. \nThe steps I took in BCA were I launched it and selected \"Create a Windows 7 or Later install disk\" and it ran from there. \nI checked out this question but it wasn't much help. Some say UNetBootin works others say it doesnt. I don't want to try anything that is not confirmed.\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: There's a simpler way than above. It's dd.\nIf you need a new .iso, Microsoft have Windows 10 USB ISOs on their website for download.\nPlug the USB device into your mac, and open terminal. \nType diskutil list and note what the address of your USB is (should be /dev/diskX where X is a number).\nIf you don't have pv installed, it's worth installing because you get a progress bar for the next bit. If you have Homebrew, then you can just run brew install pv in terminal.\nWith pv:\ntype pv -ptearb <full .iso path> | sudo dd of=<your usb address>. You should get a prompt for your password.  \nWithout pv:\ntype sudo dd if=<iso path> of=<your usb address>, enter password, and away you go. dd won't show a progress bar though, you need pv for that.\nTo speed up dd in both cases, you can use /dev/rdiskX rather than /dev/diskX. \nBe careful with dd - if you get the device wrong, you could overwrite your OSX drive\n\nA: The easiest solution would be to go and find a machine running Windows to create your USB installer. I also assume you have verified that the PC can boot from a USB port. Most of the newer machines can do this.\nHaving exhausted the easy way and if you don't want to spend any money, I suppose you could first install Windows 8.1 on your Mac. This would allow you to create the USB flash drive for use on the PC. I would suggest using Oracle VM VirtualBox since it is free and only takes 332 MB of space. I would proceed as follows.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install Oracle VM VirtualBox.\n\n*To get access to a USB 2.0 port you will also need to install the Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack. \n\n*Install Windows 8.1 using the VirtualBox default settings except for the DVD drive. This drive will need to be mapped to the Windows 8.1 installation iso. When installing Windows, you want to be sure to not automatically active the software. Microsoft will allow you to use a non-activated version for about 30 days. \n\n*Once Windows 8.1 is installed, shutdown Windows. Leave the iso file in the virtual DVD drive.\n\n*Download the Windows USB/DVD Download Tool. The file name should be Windows7-USB-DVD-Download-Tool-Installer-en-US.exe. This file will be used to transfer the contents of the Windows 8.1 iso file to the flash drive.\n\n*Format a 8GB or larger flash drive using the Disk Utility. You want a MBR partitioning scheme with a single ExFAT formatted partition. (I was able to use a 4GB flash drive with a MS-DOS(FAT) format. This may be because I was installing the Professional version of Windows 8.1)\n\n*Copy the the Windows 8.1 installation iso file and Windows7-USB-DVD-Download-Tool-Installer-en-US.exe to the flash drive.\n\n*Using the Disk Utility, unmount the flash drive. Once unmounted, add the flash drive to the ports of Windows 8.1 virtual machine.\n\n*Start Windows 8.1. Copy the files from the flash drive to the desktop.\n\n*Open a Windows Command Prompt Window as an Administrator. Enter the following command, then close the window. I assume your DVD drive has been assigned the letter D:.\nDism /online /enable-feature /featurename:NetFx3 /All /Source:D:\\sources\\sxs /LimitAccess\n\n\n*Open the Control Panel and select Programs->Turn Windows features on or off->.Net Framework 3.5 (includes .Net 2.0 and 3.0). You don't need the check mark, the small square will do. Click OK.\n\n*Execute Windows7-USB-DVD-Download-Tool-Installer-en-US.exe to install the tool. A shortcut will appear the the desktop.\n\n*Click on the shortcut to launch the \"Windows 7 USB DVD Download Tool\". Select the Windows 8.1 iso and the flash drive. Create the Windows 8.1 flash drive installer.\n\n*Eject the flash drive and remove it from the computer.\n\n*Shutdown Windows 8.1. At some point, delete Windows 8.1 from your Apple computer.\n\n\nI have tested this procedure using a Windows 8.1 Pro 64 bit iso. I then booted a PC from the flash drive in EFI mode. My version of OS X is 10.10.3.\nFinal Note: The flash drive has a MBR partition scheme with a single NTFS formatted partition. I ran Windiff to compare the files in the iso with those on the flash drive. There were no differences.\n\nA: You can give unetbootin a try.\n", "Q: How to disable face detection in Photos for OS X I don't like the feature that automatically detects faces in Photos for OS X because of the unnecessary CPU and disk space consumption. A photo library of 360 MB generated 50 MB of face detection data inside the Photos Library.\nIs there any way to disable this feature in Photos for OS X?\n\nA: Unfortunately, you can only side-step the issue by clicking the Albums tab > Faces, and select each found face & delete it. You cannot bulk select, so this must be done manually for each face.\nYou should log an enhancement request (or three) at the Photos Feedback page.\n\nA: Many people say it is not possible to disable that feature. But there might be some workarounds depending on your needs.\nIf you (and other users of the computer) do not want that feature, you might want to forcibly stop the program that performs the face detection/photo analysis.\nThe process (or program) responsible for the analysis is called photoanalysisd. you can be a bit bold about it and try to prevent the process from running altogether.\nForcibly stopping the program performing the analysis (2 alternative solutions)\nEither: (A) Using an app to forcibly pause the process that performs the analysis\nAs someone said here you can use an external app to pause the process before it goes nuts and makes your computer heat up.\nOr: (B) Forcibly disabling the process for the whole computer\nYou could go for completely preventing the photoanalysisd process from ever starting up by entering a command in Terminal. The command requires admin privileges and that SIP be disabled temporarily, otherwise you would get a permission denied error.\nSo you can enter the command in the Terminal of the Recovery Mode (booting with Cmd (⌘) – Option (⌥) – R) or from your user session while SIP is disabled (but do not forget to enable it again afterwards).\nIn a Terminal, enter the following command\nsudo chmod -x /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/PhotoAnalysis.framework/Versions/Current/Support/photoanalysisd\n\nIf you are running this in Recovery Mode, you might want to disable-reenable SIP all at once with the following:\ncsrutil disable\nsudo chmod -x /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/PhotoAnalysis.framework/Versions/Current/Support/photoanalysisd\ncsrutil enable\n\nBasically, it changes the permissions of the program file and forbids anyone from running it. This way, the system will not be able to start it and it won't be a burden for your CPU anymore.\nPS: If you update to a newer version of MacOS, you will need to re-do this B) step, since the permissions will be restored.\n\nPSS: If you ever want to enable it again, you might have lost track of this page... so put a note about it somewhere. At least, know that upgrading to the newest would reset.\n\nPSSS: Note that preventing the process from running might have side effects (even though I do not see any after few years).\nRestoring the functionality (if used option B)\nYou can always restore the permissions and everything would be back to normal with these commands run in Recovery Mode. Note the +x instead of the -x.\ncsrutil disable\nsudo chmod +x /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/PhotoAnalysis.framework/Versions/Current/Support/photoanalysisd\ncsrutil enable\n\n\nA: Apparently you can stop face recognition by quitting iPhotos,  opening a terminal and typing the following (and press enter):\ndefaults write com.apple.iPhoto PKFaceDetectionEnabled 0\n\nI guess you'll then need to manually delete all the faces it's recognised thus far.\nAs for the new \"Photos\" app, I don't think you can disable the face detection.\n\nA: There is a way to do this now in Photos Version 3.0 (3271.13.150).\nIn the sidebar select People. Then select all the faces that show up and right click. There is an option to delete/reset all saved face data.\n\nA: You can find the option in View > Hide Face Names.\n\nA: Here is how to remove the \"unnamed\" for each face in Mac Photos.\nJust open Photos and select View and click on \"HIDE FACE NAMES\"\n\nA: in search type 'face0'  all the faces will come up.  then select all and delete.   \n", "Q: bash- command not fount error I tried to install omnet++ on my Macbook pro (OS 10.10) yesterday. I got an error so I delete path in my bash-profile. \nNow, every command I try to run in my terminal shows an error of command not found. I try many ways but did not find a answer. \n\n\nA: First, get your PATH back for the current shell by running\nPATH=\"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\"\nexport PATH\n\nThen fix the PATH problems\n\n\n*\n\n*edit your bash-profile and put back the line you've deleted.

I am going to be replacing the Hard drive in my Mid 2010 Mac Book Pro (Snow Leopard 10.6.8) and I noticed that on the box the Hard drive claims to support Mountain Lion or Higher. I am wondering if this is just placed there for convenience (claiming to support highest firmware since most people will have it) or if this means that it will not run with OS X 10.6.8? \nHD model: WD WDBMYH0010BNC \nDoes the firmware impact how / if the Hard drive will function?\n\nA: For the Model WD WDBMYH0010BNC \nI found multiple places that claim it will work on 10.6.8.\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Western-Digital-2-5-Inch-Mainstream-WDBMYH0010BNC-NRSN/dp/B00D901NX6\nhttp://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=8433785\n", "Q: Accidentally created user with duplicate UID. How to fix? I accidentally created a user with a duplicate UID.  I need advice on how to fix this predicament.\nAs you can see, running dscl shows two users with the same uid:\ndscl . -list /Users uid | sort -nrk 2\njenkins                 9999\noriginal-user           9999\n\nThis happened because I was tweaking a package installer script and incorrectly assigned an existing UniqueId when creating a new user.  The UniqueId matches the uid for my own account.  Now when I login to OSX (with my own account), OSX has lost all of my profile settings (ie. Finder shows home for the new user instead of my own, browser has lost my history, etc).\nAlthough OSX shows the profile for the new user, Terminal correctly recognizes the user that I logged in as.

This is probably the best option if you haven't created any extra data or customization since the jenkins was created.  Be careful when deleting the jenkins user to make sure you don't delete original-user.\n\n*More kludgy: change the UID of one of the users by manually editing /etc/passwd, then use chown -R to change the ownership of that user's files appropriately.

I am going to be reinstalling OS X and I was wondering if there was a method for determining when the base (OS X 10.6) Operating System was installed?\n\nA: You can use the pkgutil command to get info on the packages installed on your Mac; pkgutil --pkg-info com.apple.pkg.BaseSystem should list the installation time for the base system. But it'll be in the form of seconds since the unix epoch, so you need to use date -r to convert that into a human-readable format. Here's an example:\n$ pkgutil --pkg-info com.apple.pkg.BaseSystem\npackage-id: com.apple.pkg.BaseSystem\nversion: 10.6.0.1.1.1249367152\nvolume: /\nlocation: /\ninstall-time: 1306707387\ngroups: com.apple.snowleopard-repair-permissions.pkg-group com.apple.FindSystemFiles.pkg-group\n$ date -r 1306707387\nSun May 29 15:16:27 PDT 2011\n\nEDIT: I misunderstood the question a bit -- I didn't realize the OS had been updated since 10.6. Unfortunately, the receipts system doesn't generally records for more than one version of a specific installer package (as defined by the package ID), so if you've installed more than one version of \"com.apple.pkg.BaseSystem\" it'll only have records from one of them. But you can find the oldest package you have records of, and there's a good chance it's a holdover from the initial system installation:\npkgutil --pkgs | while read pkgname; do\n    installtime=\"$(pkgutil --pkg-info \"$pkgname\" | awk '/^install-time:/ { print $2 }')\"\n    echo \"$installtime $pkgname\"\ndone | sort -g | head\n\n(Then use date -r to convert to the timestamp to a readable form, as before.)\n", "Q: Concatenating AVI files with multiple tracks I have a directory of AVI files that I would like to combine into a single AVI file.  These AVI files come from a dash cam and have two video tracks -- a front camera and a rear camera.\nI tried to use the suggestion here to combine the videos.  Specifically:\nffmpeg -f concat -i <(for f in $PWD/*.avi;do echo \"file '$f'\";done) -c copy output.avi\n\nThis works great for the first (front) video track but completely removes the second (rear) video track.\nHow can I concatenate these files and retain both video tracks?  Alternatively, is there a way I can specify the video track to concatenate?\n\nA: Basically what you need to do is demultiplex each file, then concatenate the resulting files. There is a way to do this with the concat filter, but it requires re-encoding everything as it goes.\nSo you need to do two operations. First, demultiplex. (Note this is untested with ffmpeg, as I don't have any video files to test with, but should theoretically work.)\nI=0;J=1;for f in $PWD/*.avi;do ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -map 0:v:0 -codec copy output$I.avi -map 0:v:1 -codec copy output$J.avi && I=$(($I+1)) && J=$(($J+1));done\n\nThen you can use the concat demuxer as usual:\nffmpeg -f concat -i <(for f in $PWD/*.avi;do echo \"file '$f'\";done) -c copy output.avi\n\n", "Q: MBP 2015 with Trim enabled by default?

I do have Homebrew-installed OpenSSL, if that changes anything.\nCould anyone help me fix this?\n\nA: (With great thanks to @Tetsujin for pointing me in the right direction)\nLooking up details of the certificates, in browsers that allow doing that and in Keychain Access, showed that all the breakage was traceable to a \"VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority - G5\" which was untrusted; I haven't figured out why that was, and it wasn't prominently marked as such in KA.\nAnyway, in KA I've set this cert to be \"always trusted\" on SSL, and everything is now loading well, though the other certs calling upon it are marked as \"signed by an untrusted authority\".\n", "Q: Why is there a doubled name in the Photos app when I search to name faces? The image below represents what I mean: Even though there is only one Bartłomiej Semańczyk in my Contacts, that person appears on the list below twice.\nHow do I remove repeated options on the list when I search to name faces?\n\n\nA: One is the original name tag you supplied in iPhoto, the other is the closest possible Contact in your Address Book.\nI went through the same process yesterday - trying to decide whether I wanted people tagged as names, or Contacts.  \nI can find no way to switch it off - nor, even more irritatingly, how to assign all photos with a particular face to the Contact instead of the original name, other than one at a time…\nEdit:\nSimpler than I first thought - Select one 'Face' in the main faces screen, click the name & start to type. Choose whether to use the Original tag name or the new Contact name. All similarly-tagged faces will be changed to the new system & the old tag will vanish.\nI made a silly one as an example…\n\n\n*\n\n*a. Start to type, you have 2 alternatives, select the Contact name\n\n*b. Hit Enter, the Contact Name is embedded\n\n*c. Try to repeat the process… there is now only one choice for that person [or cat]\n\nThere's a huge, detailed Photos guide on iMore - How to use Photos for OS X: The ultimate guide\n\nA: It happens because iPhoto, when facial recognising was born, doesn't support contact integration so, when you recognise faces you link them to \"handwrite\" labels, not a contact.\nLater, iPhoto was updated to support contact integration so, after this update, you can keep linking faces to handwrite labels or start linking them to contact labels. But iPhoto isn't able to merge handwrite whith contact labels and it generate confusion because, in lot of libraries, start born lot of faces with double labels.\nTo correct this issue you can merge manually all handwrite labels with contact labels. To do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*go into Photos faces screen.\n\n*find faces which has two label for the same person (for example, in your faces screen, you have two labels for Bartłomiej Semańczyk probably strewn between all your faces; one with, as picture in the circle, his faces rotated 90° (which is the handwrite label) and one while he's swimming (which is the contact label) ).\n\n*select one of the two labels for that face, I suggest the handwrite label (in your case the one with rotated picture), and click on the name label to rename it, start typing the name then, when appear the suggestion list, select the other label for that person (in your case the one while he's swimming).\nPhotos (or iPhoto, is the same) will merge that faces into the same person.\n", "Q: Amplifying the WiFi signal I am writing to find out the best option to amplify the existing WiFi signal in my house in order to be able to be online in my backyard with my MacBook Air. Would purchasing an AirPort Express be a good solution, or a simple extender/repeater would do the job?\n\nA: An Access Point would be sufficient - & cheapest. \n[just some examples from Amazon, no recommendations specifically. Note, the filter on Amazon isn't great, there are other device types in there, as well as simple Access Points]\nAn Access Point needs no additional functionality other than being able to push a signal further.\nYou wire it via your existing Ethernet to where the signal will reach the garden. All routing/DHCP functionality is then still provided by your existing router.  \nIf you can't, for any reason, get an Ethernet cable far enough to reach, then you would need a Range Extender, which is in essence the same thing, but wireless throughout. I'd still go for an AP as first choice, if at all possible.\n", "Q: iTunes Connect - Release time if app is set to specific launch date? My first iPhone app is currently in \"pending developer release\" mode.\nAt what time will the app be released if I choose to release it on a specific date?\nVia: >iTunes Connect >Select the availability date and price tier for your app. >Availability Date:\n\nWill the release date be at midnight (12:01 AM) US time? (I'm in Austria, Europe)   \n\nA: You can set only the date because it's impossible to release an app in a minute. From the pression of release button to effective global availability takes a few hour: there's the \"preparation for the store\" state which takes some minutes then your app start appearing in some stores all around the world but, if you try to get, you can get some errors then, in more or less 2-3 hours, it's stably on sale all around the world.\nSame thing from prices change.\nThat's the history of an update of my app:\n\nFeb. 24, 2015 13:33      Me....

I can't find any setting mismatches. Is there a setting somewhere which causes the behaviour I'm getting?\n\nA: This depends on the general behaviour of the apple watch. Make sure your apple watch is on your wrist before testing this.\nNotification distribution is depend on you are wearing it or not. \n", "Q: Chrome keeps creating Application folder in Home folder So has anyone noticed Chrome (around version 39?) keeps creating an Application folder in their Home folder?\nThe only way I've verified that it is Chrome is that after a fresh boot, it was the only app I ran and then the Application folder was created. I still may be wrong that it is indeed Chrome. \nHaven't been able to find any documentation on this and how to disable it. Or I may just be searching with incorrect keywords.  \nSo how does one disable this behaviour?\n\nA: Google Chrome has a feature called App Launcher. If you install any apps from that part of the store the browser will put shims for the apps in ~/Applications (it also puts an identical copy in ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Web Applications/LONG_RANDOM_IDENTIFIER/). If it is doing this then you should have a folder within ~/Applications called \"Chrome Apps\". You can see the Chrome developers making the decision to use the ~/Applications folder here. If you have installed any Chrome Apps, just uninstall them and delete the \"Chrome Apps\" folder and then Chrome shouldn't recreate the folder.\nIf you are using Chrome Canary, by default it installs shims for Gmail, Google Drive, Google Search and YouTube. But if you delete the \"Chrome Canary Apps\" folder it doesn't appear to recreate it.\nThere are other applications that install to that folder though. On my own machine Steam has installed shims for games and GitHub has chosen to install there app there instead of /Applications for some reason (I may have been prompted, I don't recall).\nLike Tetsujin said though, having an Applications folder within your own user account isn't really anything to worry about.\n\nA: I stumbled across this post while trying to get rid of what I see as annoying Chrome behavior. After fighting things for a while and trying different settings to prevent Chrome from adding its folder to my user folder, I decided to just hide it. It's a hack-y work-around, but doesn't offend my sensibilities. To do so, use the following command from the terminal:\nchflags hidden ~/Applications/\nAgain, this just hides the folder so you don't see it. It's still there and still visible in the terminal. \nHope this helps a little :)\n\nA: There's nothing wrong with having an Applications folder in your Home folder - that's where applications specific to that user live.  \nIt may be empty if it was created but either unpopulated or the app later deleted.\nThe test to see if it will be recreated by the OS itself would be reboot, delete it, reboot.\nChrome is not the only App to do this. Any app with different license requirements per user will do it by default, so will any app that allows each user the choice of customised installs.  \nExamples include:-\nSteam [per user license]\nStuffit\nParallels [per user options]\nRelated question - In OS X, is it better to put apps in /Applications or in ~/Applications? \n\nA: I have had the same issue and did not want to remove my Chrome apps. Even though I found this to be very annoying when trying to access my Applications folder in terminal.\nI have a simple fix though which is to just use a forward slash before Applications in terminal (e.g. cd /Applications). This then takes you to the correct folder.\n", "Q: How can I turn off receiving SMS (not iMessages) on os x mavericks? Is there any way to turn off receiving SMS on Mavericks but still get iMessages? I find it a security flaw for SMS code login for secure websites, if somebody gains access to my computer they could also login to these sites. \n\nA: SMS Handoff is not a feature on Mavericks, it needs Yosemite to function\n[Thanks to @tubedogg for the confirmation]\nTo enable it you would start from your iPhone…\nSettings > Messages > Text Message Forwarding - then add your computer from the list by switching on.\nThat will send a code to the computer, which you then enter on your phone to confirm the function - afaik, Mavericks will never receive that number, only Yosemite.\nSwitching off is\nSettings > Messages > Text Message Forwarding again & simply turn off forwarding that computer.\n", "Q: Messages.app not downloading messages send/received on iPhone I've been recently trying to fix an issues with Messages.app. My iPhone sends/receives all of the messages fine, on my Mac Messages.app will display these messages if the Mac is switched on.\nHowever, if I leave my Mac off then the messages do not appear in Messages.app which is incredibly frustrating.\nI have tried signing in and out on both devices, but nothing changes.

I have found that if I turn off cellular data it will usually connect. It is as if the two are competing. Anyone know why this happens or how to fix?\n\nA: If the iPhone decides that the cellular data connection will provide a better connection quality, it will choose that connection over a poor Wi-Fi connection. However, given no other choice (because you've turned off cellular data) the iPhone will attempt to maintain the poor connection over Wi-Fi.\nThere is no way around this other than to improve the Wi-Fi connection or to disable cellular data manually.\n", "Q: Run Node commands for _www user I've installed NodeJS for all users on my Mac and when I do a whoami in the terminal it says 'cameron' and I can access node, npm, and grunt globally.\nHowever when I try and run these from PHP e.g. exec('npm install'); I can't run them because they don't exist!

There are many posts with a google search that reveal the same answer. If you have Pages for the iPad you can remove the links but not on the simple notes app from Apple. \n\nA: use a comma for times (5,15 pm) and dates (10,17,2015), instead of colon (5:15 pm) and slash (10/17/2015) when writing in notes. \n\nA: It's definitely a frustrating issue. What I do is, after pasting the link into Notes, I add either text or punctuation to the end of the link, with no space in between. Typing a few periods is the easiest for me. That changes .html into .html..., which breaks its format. Notes no longer sees it as a viable address, so it will just be text. If you change your mind, or need to use it to get to the webpage, just erase those periods, and it will become a live link. \n\nA: To remove hyperlinks on Apple Notes, go to after the hyperlink (if you have more text after the link), but make sure that the cursor is touching the non-highlighted word. You should now be able to delete the link and re-type it after to make it non-highlighted.\nIf you only have the hyperlink and no other text, you must memorise it, delete the note, go to a new note and re-write the hyperlink there. If this doesn't work, keep repeating the process until it works.\nIf you are on Pages, highlight the link, and there should be an option to delete the link.\n\nA: This is probably a recently added function but just in case anyone stumbles on this answer like I did trying to figure it out.\nIn Apple Notes running in El Capitan (10.11.5) for me, you can right-click on the link and in the menu there is the option to delete the link.\n\nA: For iPad with iOS15.6 go to Notes, simply place the cursor inside the text containing the hyperlink (no need to select the whole text), then touch Aa on top of keyboard once, Title or Heading or Subheading twice will remove the hyperlink, but it will also make the paragraph containing the text Bold.\n\nA: Highlight offender, Right Click > Substitutions > Uncheck Smart Copy and Paste. \n\nA: To remove the hyperlinks, cut the text from the Note and paste into Word for Mac;  a small box will appear at the end of the text asking whether you wish to keep the original's formatting, adopt the formatting of the Word doc, or whether you want to keep \"text only.\"  Chose text only.  The hyperlinks are transformed into simple text.  Cut and paste this back into your Note.  Hope this helps.\n\nA: I just cut and paste in to a new \"Mail\" composition, cut that and repaste, clunky but the only way I've found that strips all formatting.\n\nA: Simply edit the text to include periods.  Whenever I type in an address or phone number in Notes and do not it become a hyperlink, I simply add periods.   Ex.\n333.-.333.-.1234. \nMr. Green jeans.\n3333. Green Lane.\nGarden City.

(Assuming the issue is on your side of the sending)\nYou could temporarily move the phone numbers to the notes section and delete them. Then sending a message has to go via iMessage if their email is registered for iMessage.\nIf not, just add back their mobile number and initiate an iMessage to them from the address book/contact card view. Tap the chat bubble next to their email or phone to initiate an iMessage transmission.\nIt's often required to start a new thread if you keep sending to the wrong email/mobile number since Messages wants to hold on to the way the last message was sent and not jump back to iMessage if the other person's AppleID hasn't claimed the mobile number, so keep in mind the problem might be on the other person's account - not your address book or contacts.\n", "Q: Copy and paste between Mac and Ubuntu using keyboard shortcuts via VMware Fusion I use OS X Yosemite 10.10.2 and have VMware Fusion 7.1.1 where Ubuntu 14.04 has been installed.

Here are some screenshots of the settings:\n\n\nCould anyone help?\n\nA: Look under the settings for that particular VM, not the \"App Preferences.\"  Each specific VM has it's own settings, and there are granular controls for Host <--> Guest sharing.\nI only have Parallels, or I would post screenshots, but it is quite similar, from what I remember of previous VMWare Fusion versions that I used at my old job.\nIn the \"Launch\" screen, there should be a gear or some settings button for that specific VM.\nHere it is in Parallels, FWIW.\n\n\n\nA: After a test install of Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS in VMware 7.1.1/Mac OS X 10.9.5, then using the following (shortened) guide to download the latest VMware Tools and applying the patches, copy & paste with keyboard shortcuts from the Linux guest (ctrl+c/v) to the Mac host (cmd+c/v) and the opposite direction just works.\n1. Checkout the repository:\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/rasa/vmware-tools-patches.git\n\n2. Download the latest version of VMware Tools into\n   the vmware-tools-patches folder which should reside in your user folder.\n\n    $ cd vmware-tools-patches\n    $ ./download-tools.sh 7.1.1\n\n3. Untar the tarball, and apply the patches:\n\n    $ cd vmware-tools-patches\n    $ ./untar-and-patch.sh\n4. Run the vmware-install.pl installer to install VMware Tools:\n\n    $ ./compile.sh\n\nMy VM-settings look like this:\n\n\nInside the Ubuntu VM I use the \"English (Macintosh)\" or \"German (Macintosh)\" keyboard layout.\nMy advice: trash the folder \"vmware-tools-folders\" in your user folder (or wherever you have downloaded it previously), download the patches, download the VMware Tools, apply the patches and install the tools like described in the above guide. You don't have to/mustn't reinstall/install the VMware Tools from the VMware Fusion menubar -> Virtual Machine -> Reinstall VMware Tools following the above guide.\n", "Q: WWDC scholarship I submitted my WWDC Scholarship app and the first time I tried submitting it, it just logged me out. The second time it worked but my .app file was in the Xcode project, is that ok?\n\nA: Do you mean your app was still located in the \"Build\" folder where Xcode put it, and you hadn't moved it out? I don't think the path to the app is part of the submission, and even if it is, Apple will figure it out.\n", "Q: What kind of SSD is compatible for MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2010)?

I can't figure out how to get Automator to automatically recognize when a specific file/folder has been changed or updated then automatically copy it somewhere else.\nSuggestions?\n\nA: You would use something called Folder Action.\nRight click on the Folder you want to monitor and select Folder action set up.\nIn the new window choose folder action workflow, and attach it.\nNow select it and choose edit workflow, which will open Automator.\nHere you do as shown below, while you can choose when it happens and where to save a copy.\n\n", "Q: Mac Mini with lots of I/O errors and related issues, trouble identifying culprit Setup:\nMac Mini 2011 with two drives:\n\n*\n\n*SSD with OS X Yosemite and admin account home folder\n\n*HDD with my user home folder\n\nSymptoms:\nIt began as many months of seemingly random slowdowns/beach balls, but the issues would go away (often after reboot, Safe Boot restart, or reinstall of OS X) then resurface periodically.  Recently (last week), problems escalated to being completely unable to login to my user account (logging into the admin account works fine).  When I try to login to my user, the loginwindow process crashes and it returns me to the list of users.\nIn Console, I’m also seeing lots of 'kernel: disk1s2: I/O error's (this is the HDD with my user home folder).  By lots, I mean it ranges from 1 per minute to 1 every 10 minutes or so.  Obviously the 3 big suspects are the HDD, the SATA cable, and the logic board.\nTroubleshooting:\n\n*\n\n*From the Admin account, I created a new user account stored on the\nHDD.  I have been able to login to it, but it is exhibiting similar\nsymptoms to what I observed in my primary user account (extremely\nslow, lots of beachballs).\n\n*I reinstalled OS X and tried multiple Safe Boot reboots (both of\nwhich have previously helped when encountering slowdowns and random\nbeach balls).\n\n*I replaced the SATA cable with no improvement.\n\n*I removed the HDD and used it as an external USB drive on another Mac\nand was able to access/scan the whole drive with no observed issues\nor slowdowns and no I/O errors.\n\n*Disk Utility ‘Verify Disk’ comes up clean every time and the\nS.M.A.R.T. status is Verified.\n\n*I ran the Disk Warrior hardware test and it said the drive is\nfunctioning normally.\n\n*I ran the Apple Hardware Test (Diagnostics tool) multiple times (both\nquick and extended) and it has never reported any errors with the\ndrive, logic board, RAM, or any other hardware.\n\nIt sort of feels like a hard drive problem, but I have no proof of it.  Since everything else comes up clean, I'm left with the logic board, but no way that I know to test it other than the Apple Diagnostics tool (which shows no problems).  I’d hate to waste money on replacing the hard drive or on repairing the logic board without knowing which is failing (if either).\nAny suggestions on further troubleshooting steps, particularly to determine if it’s the hard drive or the logic board?\nSide note - yes, I have backups to restore from :)\nThanks\n\nA: Look at something like Scannerz because it was designed to find those types of problems. Here's a link:\nhttp://scsc-online.com/Scannerz.html\nScannerz is fault detection software that monitors and looks for signatures associated with various types of logic board, drive, and system failures. I suspect either a cable, connection, or logic board problem.\nI hope it's OK for me to post that link and info.\n", "Q: I don't know what's wrong with my IPhone 5C My phone has been acting up. It turns on and off by itself. My apps also freeze and crash. Im not even able to back up my phone because every time I do it, it cancels. I turn my phone on and off all the time and I restart it (by pressing the home button and power button at the same time) and it's no help at all. I was thinking about resetting my phone but I'm afraid it won't work. I need help. I don't know what I should do.\n\nA: If you want to reset your iPhone, maybe first you should backup your data. You can try to backup your data on iCloud, and then restore your iPhone. Unfortunately, you said that you can not back up every time, can you connect it with your PC? If you still can't backup data, you can try to restore your iPhone 5c directly and see how it goes. Don't be afraid. Good luck.\n", "Q: Safari on Yosemite stops loading tabs if a new one is created If I visit a site in Safari, and before it loads, create a new tab or switch over to an existing one, the loading stops in the initial tab.\nHas anyone else experienced this as well? None of the Yosemite updates has fixed this issue for me. I've reinstalled the entire OS as well but the problem still persists.\n\nA: I've had this happen every time with OS X 10.10.2 and below. It has somewhat lessened with the 10.10.3 update. But it does still happen. The only way I've found around it is to make sure some of the site loads on the tab before creating a new tab (or even switching to an existing tab).\nSorry, I was hoping to just post this as a comment, but not enough reputation yet.\n\nA: I found the solution for this bug. It is indeed a bug in Yosemite that hasn't been addressed till now. This fixes it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Network Preferences\n\n*Go to Advanced\n\n*Go to TCP/IP tab\n\n*Change \"Configure IPv6\" to \"Local-link only\"\n\n*Restart the computer\n\n\nHopefully Apple will fix this annoyance in the near future. Until then, this solution works.\n", "Q: Do Pages, Numbers and Keynote for Mac/iOS offer real-time collaboration on shared documents like Pages, Numbers and Keynote for iCloud do? In Pages and Numbers (I guess Keynote too) for iCloud if you share a document and then send the link to other people you get real-time collaboration between the contributors as they edit the document and you can see the edits taking place live.\nDoes this work on Pages and Numbers for Mac/iOS?\n\nA: Yes, you can use Real Time Colaboration on a computer with at least\niOS 10 and macOS Sierra.\n", "Q: How can I copy the URL of a file downloaded by Google Chrome? As a new Mac user, I'm surprised to see that Chrome doesn't track the list of downloaded files anymore. I can't even see the current download speed in the Finder.\nI want to copy the URL of a file being downloaded, because I want to download it from another machine, in turn because the network I'm currently connected to is just too slow. How can this be done?\n\nA: Selecting the file and doing Command+i will bring up the file's Info. Under the More Info section you'll find the Where From information, which is the URL where the file was downloaded from.\n\nA: The terminal equivalent would be:\nxattr -l download.zip\n\nor for all files in a dir (with . being the current dir):\nxattr -lr .\n\nxattr's output is not easy to copy since it displays the data as binary.\nFor copy-paste friendly output use mdls:\nmdls -name kMDItemWhereFroms -raw download.zip\n\n", "Q: Annoying lag while searching in iOS Safari More or less from iOS 8.2 update I suffer a little, but very annoying, trouble in Safari.\nI open Safari, I type in the search bar what I need (web page or something to search on Google) then I've to wait from 5 to 20 seconds to launch the command.\nUntil the table under the search bar is empty, pressing search button doesn't makes happen nothing!\nAm I the only one with this issue?

I have a LaCie NAS at home which I use as a central place to park all home admin docs, Time Machine back ups etc.\nI want to be able to access it easily from my work iMac (different LAN) so it appears there in the Finder side bar as Dropbox does…\nI can access the file server via a web browser but this is slow and clunky.\nSomeone mentioned something about port forwarding and Bonjour so it appears as a server in the Finder sidebar?\n\nA: You can use this: http://www.chaoticsoftware.com/ProductPages/NetworkBeacon.html to create a sidebar icon on your Mac that links up to some address and port elsewhere.  Keep in mind it will show up regardless of whether it connects successfully or not, so don't take the appearance of your device in the sidebar to mean it's actually available.\nA quick sample configuration: I have a VPN I can use to tunnel back into my home network.  Once I'm connected I can start Network Beacon with the following settings, to get my server to show up in my sidebar and for me to get access to the files:\n\nWhere the service name is just how it shows up in the sidebar, the service type is \"AFP over TCP\" - there's a bunch of other services you can choose from, the port number is relatively obvious, and important if you're using port forwarding instead of something like VPN, and then the host proxy information is the hostname and IP address of the device you're connecting to.\n", "Q: To show videos in some CHM viewer CHM is an extension for the Compiled HTML file format. \nThere are many viewers with different quality. \nxCHM has been my choice because of robust search, here their homepage. \nI however just noticed that some files are incorporated with videos but my viewer cannot show them. \nHow can you view CHM videos in OSX?\nAny good option for this. \n\nA: Since I cannot comment your question for lack of rep, I'd suggest you try iChm 1.4.3 or 1.5.0. Latter was recently released, so if video doesn't work (a feature I didn't know about in CHM, by the way), I'd suggest you open an issue in the tracker.\n", "Q: Keeping wifi active during lock So I can find no good solution to this. I have a macbook pro running yosemite that will take down the interface when I lock it. How can I configure it so the network connection stays active when the computer is locked?\nAlso note that recommendations to install \"lock me now\" as a workaround won't work, as that app isn't available in my area (according to the app store).\n\nA: I'm assuming when you say \"Lock\" you mean that the screensaver kicks in so that you are prompted for a password.\nI use an app called Amphetamine (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?l=en&mt=12). It will make sure your Mac stays awake, but still allow it to start the screensaver (ie locking it). This way, any network activity continues (downloads, streaming, etc.), but your Mac is password protected.\n", "Q: Blur text in iMovie 10.0.7 I want to blur sensitive information in my video. How do I do that in iMovie 10.0.7? \n\"Adjust\", \"Video Overlay settings\" options are missing.\n\n\nA: I found an apple discussion that seemingly answers your question:\nQuestion\n\nI went to the help menu and it instructs me to click an icon that doesn't appear.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nAnswer\n\nYes I had this problem as well, I found out that you have to Drag the clip from EVENTS into your PROJECT.\nBut when you do so, make sure that you drag it just over the top, not actually into the clip. The icon should then appear.\n\nI am sure that Video Overlay settings have the same reason to not show up as the Adjust option\nHope this helps\n", "Q: What is the difference between `open (-a) ` and double click in finder/spotlight? I recently installed leksah on my Mac (once directly, once via brew cask).\nWhen I try to open it in Finder, Dock or use spotlight the window flashes open for a second and then closes immediately. \nWhen I open it via terminal using open -a Leksah or open ~/Applications/Leksah it opens just fine.\nOther users have experienced the same issue with other apps and other OSX versions as well. Is there a difference in behavior when opening an application using any of these methods? How can one debug what's going on?\n\nA: Well, one difference is that via Command Line, you can pass the file to be opened as an argument, but I guess this is not the difference you are after.\nThe behaviour you speak of appears to be a bug which can be observed when running Yosemite. The issue is still open: https://github.com/leksah/leksah/issues/37\n", "Q: How to change physical layout of the keyboard I bought my Mac in Spain. I cannot find change keyboard type in Keyboard preferences. I have set to English language but many keys are physically different.\nHow do I change the physical layout of the keyboard to standard British keyboard?\n\nA: OS X includes an British keyboard layout that you can switch to under Settings > Keyboard > Input Sources. If you hit the + button and search for British it'll come up. That'll give you Apple's version of a British keyboard layout.\nIf you'd like British to match a PC's keyboard, there's a second Apple mapping named British - PC.  This'll put the @ and | symbols where they should be in that layout.\nYou might find that Apple's British - PC keyboard mapping isn't quite right, as because their British keyboards aren't laid out as a typical British (BS4822) keyboard is. There's a great solution for this with a custom keyboard mapping. The one I linked there works like a charm.\n\nA: Besides using the UK-English keyboard layout get some replacement stickers and stick them carefully on your Spanish keyboard.\n", "Q: How to create a password protected ad-hoc network on Yosemite I just tried to create an ad-hoc network on OS X Yosemite and noticed there are no password options. Are they hidden? If so, is there any way to enable them? Is Terminal an option? \nIs it possible to create a password protected ad-hoc network on yosemite? If so, how?\n\nA: As a newer answer for making an ad hoc network that works in Mojave without a internet connection, while searching online, I finally found an answer! \nSmoooosher's answer only works with an active connection to share. \nTo create your own \"active\" network, in terminal run the 2 following commands.\nsudo networksetup -createnetworkservice Loopback lo0\nsudo networksetup -setmanual Loopback 172.20.42.42 255.255.255.255\n\nThis creates a new network conection that although it looks inactive, it can be shared from the internet sharing preference pane to wifi. \nsource: https://www.laszlopusztai.net/2016/02/14/creating-a-wi-fi-access-point-on-os-x/\n\nA: You can create a password-protected ad-hoc network by sharing your internet connection. To do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple Menu -> System Preferences\n\n*Go to Sharing preference pane\n\n*Select \"Internet Sharing\"\n\n*Choose the source port\n\n*Set your connection to be broadcast over WiFi\n\n*Click on WiFi options and set a network name and security\n\n\nWhile this is a little more involved than just creating the ad-hoc, it will serve the same purpose as well as having the benefit of sharing your connection. At this time, there is no way to add security to an ad-hoc only network on Yosemite.\nSource\n", "Q: Save Pages Shortcuts For All Documents In Pages you can set shortcuts for the different type of fonts:\n\nBut it only saves the shortcut for that one document.

Does it work and solve the battery life problem?\niPhone 5 new battery\n\nA: Before paying an independent dealer to replace your battery, first check if Apple will do it for free\nEnter your serial number on this page - Apple: iPhone 5 Battery Replacement Program\n\nA: It is relatively simple to replace an iPhone 5 battery. However, there are some tools which are highly recommended you buy first before continuing as you have to remove the display and can break cables in the process.\nLocal retailers would likely be able to fix your battery for about $45-$50, if you choose to have it services either by an AASP or an unauthorized repair shop.\nTo do it yourself, check out this guide from iFixIt.

So I've escaped it for now.\n\nA: Go to Settings> iTunes & AppStore > Password Settings > slide the \"Require Password\" switch. This worked for me for free apps. \n\nA: Go to your setting, change your language to some other than your default one, let it respring and after that change back to your default language. After that it should be ok again\n\nA: Whenever there is strange behaviour that doesn't seem to resolve itself, this tends to indicate that the device is hung up with respect to the sequence of steps that it needs to complete.\nTo force the device to take a fresh start at doing the task, you should restart the device.\n\nA: A solution to many strange iOS problems is to back up and restore the device. I saw this issue on an iPad before, and could find no solution besides restoring it. \n\nA: I'm having the same issue and I'm pretty sure it started with the last iOS update. One workaround I've found has been to purchase the app from iTunes on my computer. Then, go to the Updates tab in the App Store on your phone and click on Purchased items at the top. The app will be available there for download.\nThe only issue I'm having, and cannot resolve, is that I cannot make any in-app purchases and that's not something that can be done on a computer.

When I have 10-20 jpg or pdf files are there in finder, Im coping them and pasting in the email only for the txt message not attachment, i will get as full path for the individual images a lengthy one. \nany fix??\n\nA: I see what you are saying. If you select a picture file in Finder and Copy, then Paste into an Outlook message, you get text of the full path starting with \"file://\". That is because copying in Finder does not examine the contents of the file. It examines only the file handle and copies that path. \nIf you want to copy the contents of a file, whether it is a picture file, text file, or what, you must get access to those contents first. You must open the picture with something. \nSo whatever file you want to put in an email, double-click that file, then select all, then copy, then paste into the email.\nThe other option, as Kevin said, is to drag the file right into the email message. That will attach the file.  But it sounded like you wanted the content of the picture(s) in the body of the email.  My method above is how you do that.\n\nA: In theory, you can open the images in preview and copy them. It works when pasting into a text editor, but probably won't work with your webmail. It's a matter of the website (your webmail), not your Mac. \nPerhaps try drag-and-drop if that is supported.\n", "Q: Change window keyboard shortcut So there's this gesture on touchpads where you move 4 fingers downward so you change between multiple windows of the same application.

I upgraded to Yosemite and migrated my iPhoto library to the new Photos app. I'm happy with Photos and don't plan to go back to iPhoto.\nThis Apple support article makes it clear that the photos don't really exist in two places, but leaves it vague as to where they actually are.\nI don't like having an iPhoto Library that my Photos library is dependent on, and I'm bothered by the weird and misleading sizes reported by the Finder.\nHow can I get rid of the iPhoto Library without damaging my Photos Library?\n\nA: Once you are certain you are happy with Photos, & you are certain the Library has migrated successfully, you can delete the old iPhoto app & iPhoto Library if you wish.\nThe Library, as you mentioned, is 'virtual' as both are hard linked to the same files. Deleting either Library will not delete the pictures, only deleting both Libraries will do that.\nThe apparent size on disk is incorrect [or rather, somewhat misleading], as each Library will claim to be approximately the same size, yet they refer to the same files.\nAlso see - Does migrating to Apple's new Photos app actually double my storage requirements?\n", "Q: iCloud syncing seems to have stopped, can't delete folders I am using iCloud Drive on my Macbook Pro, and I noticed that even if the iCloud folder has my files, they're not really synced on the cloud.

As far as I can recall I've never installed an app called MobileCal. Please let me know i) how to remove this orphaned entry and ii) how it got there in the first place. I'm running OS X Yosemite 10.0.3. Thanks! Additionally I'm receiving the following error when I attempt to open a reminder from Spotlight Search:\n\nA: The MobileCal.app is part of Xcode's iPhone SDK, so the easiest way to get rid of that app is to either remove the Xcode completely or remove just the app. The file can be located inside the Xcode package:\nXcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator.sdk/Applications\n", "Q: In the new photos app, how can photos be deleted from device independent of import time? I go to photos app.\nI DO NOT select \"Delete after import\" (for the purpose of seeing if it mattered).  I import photos from iphone. \nNow I havent found an obvious way to go back and delete all of the just imported photos from my device.\nIf anyone has a way to do this that would be good.\nIf you do not want to deal with this, select \"delete after import\" when you are importing photos. This is for if you forget to do that.\n\nA: Easiest way is to use Image Capture from OS X\nYou can use it to Import too, to any app that can import pictures, or to a folder location.\nSelect any pictures you wish to delete & hit the 'no entry' sign to trash from your device\n\n\nA: Here's a way I found to do it.  In Photos on the Mac, click the device in the sidebar so all the photos are displayed.  Scroll to the top and there should be a section called 'Already Imported (xx items)'.  Click 'Show all', then select the photos you want to delete.  Ensure the 'Delete Items After Import' box is checked. Hit 'Import Selected' and wait for them to be imported.  Now you'll have duplicates of those pics because they were already imported.  Just go to the 'Last Import' Album and delete all those pics you just imported.  Then if you want you can go to 'Recently Deleted' and bin them for good.\nIt's a bit of a convoluted solution but it works if you have a whole stack of random 'already imported' photos on your device and just want to delete them reasonably quickly.\n\nA: I also had the same problem that the \"Delete after imports\" option in Photos seemed to have disappeared.\nThe key thing to bring it back was to UNLOCK your phone BEFORE connecting the USB. If the phone is unlocked and THEN connected, the option \"delete items after import\" appeared.\n", "Q: Iphone 8.3 Other Storage 89gb Upgrade to 8.3 at the time of backup I had 1.2gb of used Other Data.\nHooked up the watch, used it over the weekend and now up to 89gb of Other Data.\nTurned off the Watch, and restarted the phone but I can not find anyway to remove the Used space. Deleted my main Email account but that did not free up any space.\nLooked in Setting - Have 29gb of Video and other apps are around 500mb.\nNot enough small apps to make up 89gb.\nThe Apple rep requested I restore from my Upgrade backup.\nHas anyone see this happen?\n\nA: Try this:\nPlug your device into your computer. Download the app iFunbox. Go to the root file system, then open the directory \"Application Archives\" then delete all of the ipa files.\nAnother alternative (without ads) is iMazing it does an amazing job with my files. (It's a paid app)\n", "Q: How to clear the Photos icon badge For some reason that is not clear to me, the Photos app icon on the dock of my Yosemite OS now displays a badge (the number 1 in a red circle top right corner)\nFirst of all, I have no idea what that badge is suppose to represent.  Second, when I launch the app I have not idea what the thing is that I'm suppose to look at, acknowledge or in some way \"touch\" so that the badge goes away.\n\nA: If you haven't already, turn on the sidebar - Option-Command-S - then look towards the top and under Shared, click Activity. Likely there is some activity on a shared album or Photo Stream. It may also be someone inviting you to join a shared album or Photo Stream. (I'm not sure how that would show up in Photos, as I haven't had any invitations since Photos was released.)\nEither way I'm guessing once you take a look at that area, the badge will disappear.\n\nA: Supposing you're talking about iOS, the badge may mean somebody commented or liked one of your photos on a shared folder.\n", "Q: How reliable and trustworthy are the Objective-See Security tools (KnockKnock (UI), Dynamic Hijack Scanner and BlockBlock)? DHS found an issue \nIs this a false positive? Anybody else with the same message?\nI installed BlockBlock. What do you think about it? Do you trust those Security tools?\n\nBlockBlock (beta)\nBlockBlock provides continual protection by monitoring persistence locations. Any new persistent component will trigger a BlockBlock alert, allowing malicious items be blocked.\n\nURL: Free OS X Security Tools\n\nA: I use many of their tools and this is probably not a false-positive. The only currently known false positives stated on their Dynamic Hijack Scanner webpage (at the bottom) ia Microsoft Messenger (mbukernel) and Microsoft Messenger Daemon (mbuinstrument).\nAbout your scan results, I also have BitTorrent Sync installed on my Mac and I get the same message (tested on 2 other Macs). If I do a full system scan with DHS, I get many other applications that have the rpath vulnerability and the weak vulnerability, including iMovie and many Xcode tools. Please note that this is not something to be too worried about, as none of your Applications are \"Hijacked\" and dylib hijacking is quite a newly discovered vulnerability in OS X, and therefore your probably not going to see any in-the-wild attacks yet. If you are of the more technical sort, you can read their slides presented on this at CanSecWest here and the technical paper here.\nI do trust the tools from this company and the person behind this (Patrick Wardle) is clearly stated on their About page. He has published more of his OS X research papers that are available at the bottom of that webpage. He has also done many presentations at security conferences including DefCon, and is the Director of R&D at Synack.\nKnockKnock is a tool that scans for persistently installed items on your Mac, including Kernel Extensions, Launch Items, and Login Items and lists them on the screen.\nLastly, BlockBlock is simply a tool that watches for anything that becomes persistently installed (executed at boot every time your mac boots up), such as malware - the tool is still in beta as of this writing.\nAt the end, they are all great Mac security tools to check-up your mac :).\n\nA: Most of the tools by objective-see seem to be provided without source code. As this precludes verification of the stated functionality and the ability to build these products yourself, security conscious people should not install these tools. Given the fact that these tools often operate with high privileges cautiousness is paramount.\nShould I be wrong, then the information on getting the source code should at least be made more readily available.\n\nA: If you look at the code in the git repos, the author of a lot of the code is Patrick Wardle who appears to be a principal security researcher for Jamf. Seems pretty trustworthy.\n\nA: I've installed Objective-See's tools as well as communicated a few times with Warden about some questions.\nKnock Knock seems OK and includes a built-in link to Virus total with each report row so you can immediately get a VT scan for the item. Neat.\nBlock Block seems to catch anything attempting to install for boot launching. But it's beta, so mileage may vary.\nToday (4/27) Objective-See tweeted on nasty Mac OS malware discussion posted by Checkpoint. Bundled in the tweet are screenshots of Block Block picking the malware up and giving user a chance to block the install. (The malware at the moment is hitting European taxpayers in Checkpoint's report). A handful of Virus Totals AV agents have just been begun to pick it up. The fact that Block Block detected it by process and not a white list is exciting. \n", "Q: Apple MacBook Air mid-2012 A few days ago, I got my Macbook Air battery changed at an Apple store. Since then, about once a day, I've had a \"kernel panic\" crash, which seems to happen randomly while I'm working. (I've never seen this before.)  \nI did an extended memory test, which showed no problems, but a disk test on the built in 128 Gb SSD showed these errors: \nChecking catalog file.(It should be 67667 instead of 67668)\nInvalid directory item count(It should be 38 instead of 37)\nInvalid volume free block countFile system check exit code is 8.\nThe popup advised repairing the disk using the Recovery HD (Command R on startup). I've done this, but, from the recovery screen, the disk shows no errors, and Verify says the disk is fine. When I rerun the disk check inside OSX, the same messages pop up. \nAny idea what's going on here? Is it possible that the hard drive was damaged during the battery install? \n\nA: There is some \"corruption\" on some of your files.  Since you already ran the Disk Utility and it came back clean it is telling you that there are no physical errors with your drive.  That's the good part.\nYou have a couple of options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run fsck\n\n*Do a clean install\n\n\nRunning fsck.  You will need to do so in single user mode (hold down Command-S during boot)\nYou will know that this worked because you will see a black background with a ton of white text scroll down your screen.\nWhen you are done booting, you will see a command line prompt.  Enter the following command:\n#fsck -fy\n\n(Don't enter the hash tag)\nIt will complete and tell you that the file system was modified.  Keep running the above command until it tells you that the volume is \"Ok.\"\nWhen you are done reboot the computer by issuing the command\n#reboot\n\nYour MBP Air will reboot normally the error should go away.\nIf it dosen't it is time to do a fresh clean install.  \nThere are third party utilities that \"may\" work here, but I have found they cause more problems than they are worth.\nOh...most important part:\nMake sure you have a backup of all your data!!!!\n", "Q: How to select a photo from Mac OS photos from an open/attach dialogue box When in messaging apps such Telegram Messenger I sometime want to attach a photo. In these cases I am presented with a dialogue box like the below:\n\nAs the photo is invariably in my iPhoto (or more recently Mac OSX \"Photos\") library, it is very difficult to navigate to the photo I want via this dialogue. I also can't seem to drag and drop from Photos and a copy/paste results in the image file path being pasted rather than the image itself.\nIs there an easy way to insert photos into apps of this nature? Note this is not restricted just to messaging apps, but any app that offers importing of photos where one might want to use something from their OSX library.\n\nA: If you scroll down in the sidebar, you should have a \"Media\" section with a \"Photos\" item:\n\nWhen you select that, you are presented with a photos browser, where you can select any photo from the Photos app:\n\n\nA: You'd need to open Photos or iPhoto, drag the file to the desktop, then use the above dialog to open it. (Some applications do support dragging directly from Photos or iPhoto, it just depends.)\nAlso, you can urge application developers to support sharing extensions which would allow you to use a share sheet in Photos to open the photo in your chosen application automatically.\n", "Q: MAC Filtering in Internet Sharing How can I enable MAC Filtering on my MAC OSX 10.9.4?\nI tried adding\n<key>allow</key> <array> <string>0:17:43:a3:2d:45</string> </array>\n\nto my /etc/bootpd.plist, but every time I change it and start Internet Sharing again, it gets replaced again. How can I change this permanently?\n\nA: Have a look at this method I used for many years on Lion and Mountain Lion: How to stop InternetSharing overwriting /etc/bootpd.plist\nSince the culprit is still InternetSharing overwriting a standard\nconfiguration file, the method should work.\n", "Q: Need Help w/Step by Step for Restoring YouTube on 1st Gen iPad w/iOS 5.1.1 A generous soul shared some useful information about this issue here (https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/175075/123732), but there are a couple of details that might be obvious to a veteran Apple person that are not obvious to a newcomer such as myself. Primarily, it's not clear to me where the steps are executed. I'm assuming that all of these steps are happening on a computer with iTunes installed, and that step 4 is referring to plugging the iPad into the computer. That makes the most sense to me, but this is all new to me so some clarification would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks in advance! :-)\n\nA: The Youtube app on iOS 5.1.1 will no longer work, even if you happen to install it. This month (April), Google deprecated an API which the legacy app used in favor of a newer one extending functionality to the HTML5 web/iOS/Android app versions which have since been released in the App Store.\nPlease refer to source for more information. This change was announced March 2014 - source\nIf you really want to try and make it work, as an actual answer to the question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the iOS 5.1.1 IPSW file for the original iPad\n\n*Launch iTunes with your iPad connected\n\n*Back up your iPad\n\n*Option-Click (Mac) or Shift-Click (Win) the Restore button when viewing the iPad property page in iTunes\n\n*Locate and select the iOS 5.1.1 ipsw file downloaded in Step 1\n\n*Restore your device using the ipsw and, once completed, do not allow iTunes to update to iOS 6\n\n", "Q: Keep Finder On-Top While Dragging Links From Safari URL Bar In the previous version of OS X, Mavericks, I used to be able to have a browser window open and a finder window open, I used to then be able to drag a link from the URL into the finder window to drop links. \nIf the window was like this:\n\nWhere the finder is on top of the browser you were able to drag the URL link from the URL bar without the safari window jumping up on top. Now when you do it the finder window will get placed under the safari window. \nIs there any way to get this property back? Being able to have finder windows on top of the safari window makes it so much easier to drag links from the URL bar to the folder. \n\nA: You can just drag the link to the Finder icon in the Dock, and hold for a couple of seconds. That’s show you all the available windows of Finder, then you can select the one you want to drag the web-loc to. As @Phoenix mentioned in comment, you can aways ⌘+Tab to switch between open apps. Another way would be to use Mission Control, the shortcut of which is F4, or ⌃+↑ (configurable in Keyboard Pref Pane).\nIt should be expected behaviour to switch to the app you clicked on so Finder has to lose focus, for Safari to respond.\n", "Q: Changing OS X behaviour after crash recovery OS X tends to try and help out and reopen everything to just the way it was before it crashed. I mean this in two ways:\n\n*\n\n*If an app running within OS X crashes, OS X will remember the last working state of the app and resume at that point next time you launch the app.\nExample: Safari crashes because I've shamelessly opened way too many tabs and windows again. The next time I launch Safari I tax the system severely and fight to be able close windows or even force quit again.\n\n\n*If OS X itself crashes, the computer automatically restarts and loads OS X again, at which point every application, web page, and document that was open at time are simultaneously reloaded.\nHow can I prevent or alter the way such situations are handled?\n\nA: To your first question:\nOpen System Preference -General settings, and select following:\n\nTo your second question: (actually we do not like to have more than one question, but since they are related...) that is a Safari settings.\n", "Q: Can wiping and reinstalling OS damage the SSD? Computer is new 13\" retina MBP. 2.9GHz i5, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD.\nI have been working on some dotfile setup scripts for my new computer and thought I had them dialed in, but did not really work how I wanted. So I restarted, hit CMD+R and chose \"reinstall Yosemite\" because I wanted to try again.\nIt just occurred to me I was not sure if doing that, repeatedly if needed, can cause any issues with the hard drive or anything?\n\nA: You would have to do that at least a couple hundred times to even remotely becoming an issue.  \nThere was an article on hardware.info where these guys put some SSDs through some torture tests and ended up \"writing\" what equated to about 22 years of data.  \nThe bottom line is that the drive's reliability will outlast your ability to fill it up and buy a newer bigger one.\n", "Q: Kernel Panics during and after 10.10.3 update I have recently experienced two Kernel Panics on my MacBook Pro (13 inch, mid-2012). The first one happened during the upgrade process to 10.10.3 right at the end. The second happened today while browsing the web. Apple Hardware Test and Memtest turned up nothing.

What do I need to do to fix this? I've read that if I turn off iCPL on her phone and then delete all the pictures in her photos app including Recently deleted then restart her phone and turn iCPL again it will revert to optimizing again. Is this an acceptable method for fixing this what I consider to be a still in beta Apple app.                 Very disappointing.\n\nA: I turned iCPL, Photo Stream and iCloud Photo Sharing off in Settings/General/Photos & Camera, rebooted her phone and then turned on all that I had turned off. The phone then showed a spinning gear for about 5 minutes saying \"Turning On\" and after that I went to Settings/General/Usage/Manage Storage, and saw that her phone regained 2Gb of storage back from only having 388Mb available. I did not have to delete all of her photos after I turned iCPL off.\n", "Q: MacBook Air A1237 Recovery I replaced the hard drive on my Macbook Air. When I press the option key while powering on it takes me to a screen where I select a WiFi network and nothing else is on the screen. I connect to WiFi and then nothing happens. There Are no other options. What should i do?\nI have also tried the same procedure with the old disk, but the same strange thing happens.\nIt connects to the WiFi network but that's all.\n\nA: The MacBook Air (from early 2008) does neither have a Recovery HD by default nor an Internet Recovery.  You would need to install the original OS with the medium you received with your computer (Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard) or if you either have the disc or a USB stick version of Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, you can install that as well (disc version will require either a USB SuperDrive or a second Mac with an optical drive you can share). Once done, you can at least use your computer again already.\nIf you, however, want to reinstall Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, you will first have 10.6 Snow Leopard installed and fully updated (see above what that will require). Otherwise, you would need a USB stick with the Lion Installer on it to bypass installing Leopard or Snow Leopard.\n", "Q: How do I increase display by 120% of normal? Using Mac Air, Yosemite OS In Windows one can right click, head over to display preferences and have the OS increase everything globally ... icons, fonts, etc ... by a certain factor.   It's really helpful for \"old\" eyes.   Is there an equivalent for Mac?   I have found zillions of places to tweak things piecemeal.  But am looking One place, One setting.   Am certain it exists, but as a Mac novice I have struggled. \nAm using Mac Air; OS X Yosemite 10.10.2\n\nA: Use:\nSystem Preferences -> Accessibility -> Zoom\n\nMore details here\n\nA: The simplest way is the Zoom from Accessibility, instead of the annoying fullscreen mode you can do picture to picture that isn’t so annoying. To increase the everything you’ll have to change the resolution as @denisinla mentioned. That’s has the draw-back of not looking so good.\nOtherwise you’ll have to do increase size app by app. Most apps now have zoom options, like in Safari it’s under View menu, in Mail it’s under Window; just search in the Help menu and it should show. To make the icons bigger right click any Finder window, and Show View Options. There you can set it as you like, and click Use as Defaults. The sidebar size can be increased in General Pref Pane. You can also increase the cursor size Accessibility -> Display. The Dock can be resized by dragging the Line next to trash up and down, or in the pref pane. Also apps have a convention of using ⌘+Plus and ⌘+Minus or with Shift and Alt for zooming. You can always try that.\nSo options are there but there isn’t a global one, except the Zoom feature from Accessibility.\n\nA: How about increasing your screen resolution by adjusting it in \nSystem Preferences > Displays > Scaled > Adjust for Larger Text - More Space\n\n\nA: For permanent and full screen increase in fonts ect use System Preferences.\nSelect Display, now hold the \"alt\" key and click on scaled.\nHere I would choose the 1024x640 and if it is to large choose next one.\n", "Q: How to remove keyboard shortcut for app? Specifically, I am used to typing Command-1 in a WordPress admin area to specify some text as a Header 1, (and Command-2 to specify Header 2), but when I do this now in Chrome, that command seems to change the current browser tab.\nIs there a way to edit or remove the chrome keyboard commands so those commands will work with WordPress, (I am assuming that the Chrome commands over-ride the WordPress admin ones)?  \nUsing an iMac running OS X Yosemite.\n\nA: This is not a OS X problem. It's a Chrome problem.\nWhen a browser receives a keystroke, it needs to decide whether to apply it to the webpage first or its UI/chrome(lower-case). Google Chrome chose the latter as a design decision. Firefox made the opposite choice. As a consequence, when a Firefox user tries to COMMAND+ARROW to go back/forward, he might end up flipping through slideshows on that page.\nThere is nothing you can do on the OS end as everything passes through browser. You can use an addon to disable specific native browser shortcuts. I know how with Firefox, not Chrome. Or you can modify the javascript embedded in wordpress site, and come up with new non-conflicting shortcuts.\n\nA: I've used https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/ before, but I'm not sure if it will allow you to use it the way you've described. Perhaps reading their docs for re-mapping keys.\n", "Q: Can't boot off of USB on Early 2006 iMac and can't get to Startup Manager Recently, I've gone through the trouble of replacing the hard drive on my Mac with the model A1174, which the Internet says is a iMac \"Core Duo\" 2.0 20-Inch Early 2006. Needless to say that I do not have the install discs for it anymore! But I do have another Mac computer, so I followed these directions to create a boot USB but did the same thing for Yosemite:\nhttp://www.techrepublic.com/blog/apple-in-the-enterprise/how-to-create-a-bootable-usb-to-install-os-x/\nWhen I plug the USB drive in and boot it up, I still get the blinking questionmarked folder. When I press the Option button to try and get into Startup Manager, it does nothing.\n\n\n*\n\n*Did I do something wrong making the USB drive, or are these Macs\nnotorious for not wanting to boot off of USB?\n\n*Why wouldn't the\ncomputer then boot into Startup Manager anyway?\n\n*Is there like a BIOS\nscreen where I can see that I successfully installed the hard drive?\n\n*Will this require an install disc after all and how will I know that it'll work?\n\n\nThanks so much.\n\nA: Yosemite is not supported on the Early 2006 iMac - it can only go up to Snow Leopard v10.6. You will either need to order a set of restore discs for this particular system (as discs do not necessarily work between models, make sure to get the right ones) or find a retail copy of either Tiger (Make sure it is newer than 10.4.6), Leopard or Snow Leopard.\nYou can find retail copies of the discs on eBay or other various sites. There is a remote chance that you may be able to order the recovery media through Apple's phone support - we used to do it when I worked for Applecare - but due to the age it is less likely that they would have it and/or would have shipping times under 2wks.\nIt is highly recommended that you opt right for the Snow Leopard retail DVD as there is no upgrade path from Tiger -> Snow Leopard for free.\nEDIT: To answer your questions in order:\n\n\n*\n\n*The operating system you made the drive from is not supported on your computer by a few generations, likely causing the issue. Booting from USB is supported on your machine\n\n*There is no operating system, recovery system, really anything to support booting into from your disk selector\n\n*No, not directly. The closest you would get would be Single user mode, which is just an extension of the operating system itself. Through there, you could use diskutil to see if the drive was recognized.

The metadata is there and can be read by Photos on the iOS - I'm just not sure that there's a good way of automatically doing it and grouping them as you want.\nBut try this: launch Photos on your phone, hit the search magnifying glass, and start typing someone's name.  It'll give you a menu list of all of the people, locations, albums, keywords etc that match your search.\nMy guess is that 'smart searches' will be coming soon, where you can then save that search and then later just pull it up as though it were an album.  You can do the same in Photos on OS X but it doesn't sync that album over to iOS ... yet.\n", "Q: I want to make VLC my default player on Mac OS X 10.10.3 I have seen people say to click get info then do something with the 'open with' but when I go to get info there is NO open with option, no options to change at all.

I know that I can open a file with an external program from the Terminal with open, and that works for most applications. However, when I try to use a command like open -a Preview info.txt, it launches Preview, but the file is not opened.\nI am on Mavericks 10.10.2.\nIs there a way to use the open command (or any other built-in command) to actually open a file in Preview from the Terminal?\n\nA: \nNB - If there are\n  any further questions about this answer please comment.\n\nUPDATE\nThere's nothing wrong with the other answers, this one leverages a system command to convert the text file to a compatible filetype for Preview (i.e. PDF). \nGiven a sample file  you can run:\ncupsfilter info.txt > info.pdf \n(to hide the debug output use cupsfilter info.txt > info.pdf 2> /dev/null)\nAfter which one may apply the original answer to open the new info.pdf file in Preview. You can learn more by running man cupsfilter. I believe this just exposes the basic Save As PDF functionality that exists in the CUPS print system. \n(Source)\nAdditionally\nAs noted in the comments one can simply pipe the command to open a file directly into Preview. This worked for me:\ncupsfilter info.txt 2> /dev/null | open -f -a Preview\n(Original Answer)\nTo open a supported Preview file from Terminal, such as pdf, png, jpg, gif, tiff, bmp:\nopen -a Preview <nameOfSupportedFileType>\nSo for example:\nopen -a Preview avatarMask@2x.png \nOpens the png from the current folder in Preview. \n\nA: There is, but you need to convert the file to postscript or PDF first. For example, I have a function pman which works exactly like regular man, but opens the man page in Preview.app:\npman () \n{ \n    man -t $* | open -f -a /Applications/Preview.app\n}\n\nThe -t option tells man that the output needs to be formatted (using groff) as postscript.\nYou want to open a text file in Preview.app. For the \"convert to PDF\" stage I use paps, which I installed using brew:\nbrew install paps\n\nAfter that, it's easy!\npaps info.txt | open -f -a /Applications/Preview.app\n\nThat'll open info.txt in Preview. If you do this a lot, you'll probably want to create a function (in your ~/.bash_profile or similar):\npreview ()\n{\n    if [ -z \"$*\" ]; then\n        echo \"Usage: preview [FILE]\"\n    else\n        paps $1 | open -f -a /Applications/Preview.app\n    fi\n}\ncomplete -f -X '!*.txt' preview\n\n\nA: Preview only works with PDF files and some image files (png, jpg, gif, tiff, bmp) so you won't be able to open a text file on Preview.\nTo open your info.txt file from terminal you need to choose an application that can open text files, like TextEdit or any other text editor.\nYou also could use open -e file, to open any file using TextEdit.\n\nA: \nQuickLook scans file contents before you open those files. Usually this just lets you view a file quickly. But you can also use this same technology from the command line to bring about a change to the Finder without actually opening a file. To access QuickLook from the command line, use qlmanage.\nqlmanage -p ~/Desktop/MyTowel42.pdf\n— Charles Edge\n\nYou can add following function to ~/.bash_aliases:\npreview () { qlmanage -p \"$*\" >& /dev/null; }\n\nFound here: https://clburlison.com/preview-files-from-terminal/\n", "Q: How do I restore the default Postscript printer?

I have a 2011 Macbook Air.\nThe original Magsafe cord was getting flimsy, so I cut the old cord, got a spare one from eBay and soldered it to the power adapter.\nHowever, I realised the wattage rating information built into the connector's chip is 60W in the new cord (which was probably obtained from a dead 60W adapter), as reported by \"System information\" and CocoaBattery, while my adapter's actual rating is 45W.\nSo far the Air seems happy with this new cord, but I wonder what risks this might incur, especially since 60W adapters are supposed to deliver 16.5v, instead of the 14.5v the Air needs.\n\nA: If I'm reading your description correctly, then the replacement cord has a higher rating (60W) than the 45W that is drawn by the 2011 Macbook Air. This is fine because all it means is that the cord has a thicker gauge to handle a higher wattage (than what you are are actually using).\nThe replacement cord would not affect the voltage, so your adapter would still be delivering what it is specified for, namely the 14.5 V.\n", "Q: MacBook Yosemite WiFI drops when other devices possibly interfere I am having serious WiFi issues on my MacBook Pro (retina Mid 2012 with Yosemite) where the connection continuously drops making Internet impossible to use. \nI have already tried all of the options described on various blog posts, including Fix Wi-Fi Problems in OS X Yosemite.\nThe problem is only happening on my MacBook Pro.

It doesn't seem predictable what will happen when I press the \"play\" key, so in cases where it's not based on focus, how does OSX route keyboard events?\n\nA: I'm not sure how OS X decides which app to send the command. It might have to do with launch order, or last visited order.

I have a friend who has never owned a Mac. He has just built a \"hackintosh\" by installing VMWare on his PC running Windows, and downloading a pirated, hacked copy of Mac OS X Yosemite in a portable VMWare virtual machine volume from somewhere online.\nHe claims to be astonished and unbelieving when I tell him that what he's doing is illegal. He's stealing. He's committing piracy.\nHe tells me that he installed some hacked \"distro\" of Mac OS X called \"Niresh\". He tells me that he assumed that it was legitimate because it appeared to be supported by a large community of computer enthusiasts. He actually said to me \"It wouldn't be on the Internet if it was illegal\".\nNow he's hitting me up for help doing further hacks to make his \"hackintosh\" behave exactly like a real Mac. He's asked me to run a Terminal script on my Macintosh to output my UUID, MLB (Main Logic Board serial number) and ROM values from my real Macintosh so he can clone these identifying numbers to his \"hackintosh\" volume.\nHe says, \"No way. I've payed plenty of money to Apple. I bought four iPhones for my family, and an iPad too. So what's wrong with running a Hackintosh?\"\nHe's a research scientist, and I believe he might pay attention to an authoritative published source that explains why what he is doing is illegal.\nCan anybody help me find information that I can use to prove to him that what he's doing is illegal?\nUpdate\nI sent my friend @cmason's information about the Apple OS X License Agreement, and I believe I have convinced my friend that what he is doing is not legal or ethical.\nI also warned him that because he'd installed a version of Mac OS X that had been completely and thoroughly hacked, cracked, and had all its Apple-built-in security disabled, this means that it would be likely that what he downloaded and installed is pre-infected with any manner of root kits, rats, malware and viruses, and that he might now be part of some criminal enterprise's botnet. That helped to get his attention as well.\n\nA: \nNo way. I've payed plenty of money to Apple. I bought four iPhones for my family, and an iPad too. So what's wrong with running a Hackintosh?\n\nIt sounds like your friend is either already aware or doesn't care that what he is doing is in violation of copyright law.\n\nI thought those people had ethics\n\nSomething being illegal and something being unethical are two different things. Based on his rationalization above, it seems your friend was trying to convince you that he thought what he was doing was ethical because he felt he had already compensated Apple sufficiently.\nThere are some people who view copyright law as a whole as itself unethical and thus view any form of copyright 'piracy' as perfectly ethical.\nBut if the problem is that your friend really doesn't know that what he's doing is actually illegal, see cmason's answer.\n\nA: The mere fact that Apple claims that creating a hackintosh violates the DMCA, and that their EULA is an enfoceable contract, does not make either so. There are rulings in their favor from the Psystar case, but it is not clear whether those rulings apply to end-users or only to companies like Psystar who were reselling hackintoshes.\nThe chance of an individual being sued is essentially zero, because Apple doesn't want the bad PR of exposing their morally repugnant, monopolistic, anti-consumer tactics to the public any more than necessary.\nIt is my (totally non-authoritative paralegal-school dropout) opinion that even if Apple's EULA were ruled enforceable, the clause forbidding use on non-Apple hardware is clearly a tying agreement in violation of the Clayton anti-trust act of 1914, and so would be thrown out.\n\nA: Google gives the following definition of \"illegal\":\n\ncontrary to or forbidden by law, especially criminal law\n\nHowever, your friend appears to have only committed copyright infringement, and possibly breach of contract if you believe that end user license agreements are enforceable contracts and that he formed a contract with Apple by using its operating system.\nI am not a lawyer, but I think that in most countries breach of contract and small-scale non-commercial copyright infringement are civil wrongs rather than crimes, so perhaps \"illegal\" is not the right word to describe your friend's use of a hackintosh.\n\nA: How about the Apple OSX License Agreement:\nhttp://images.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/OSX10103.pdf\nin particular, Part 2, section I:\n\nI. Other Use Restrictions. The grants set forth in this License do not permit you to, and you agree not to,\n  install, use or run the Apple Software on any non-Apple-branded computer, or to enable others to do so.\n  Except as otherwise permitted by the terms of this License or otherwise licensed by Apple: (i) only one\n  user may use the Apple Software at a time, and (ii) you may not make the Apple Software available over\n  a network where it could be run or used by multiple computers at the same time. You may not rent,\n  lease, lend, sell, redistribute or sublicense the Apple Software.\n\nThe License earlier says how you may obtain a license to the software, which is basically: buy a Mac, buy OSX in App Store, or get a volume license. In any case, none of these grant running OSX on anything other than Apple Hardware. You can run it in a VM, but only on a VM hosted on Apple Hardware.\n\nA: \n\"It wouldn't be on the Internet if it was illegal\".\n\nLOL! I guess he hasn't used the Internet much. Anyway, moving along...\nPirated software is certainly illegal, but for the sake of discussion we'll assume that your friend owns a legal license for OS X that isn't currently being used on another computer.\nAs mentioned in other answers, making a hackintosh is definitely against Apple's EULA.\nDo companies expect users to comply with their EULA?\nI would say that companies hope that people read and follow the EULA, but have the common sense to realize that they won't.\nFrom anecdotal experience (having contributed to a EULA for work once), EULAs are written with the full understanding that the user:\n\n\n*\n\n*Won't read them, and\n\n*Certainly won't follow them.\n\n\nThey're written because they provide some protection for the company in the event something bad happens. However, if there's something you really want the user to know, good companies know they need to make it show up somewhere the user will actually look, like a popup window in their software or in the user manual in bold, brightly-coloured print.\nI don't know if Apple has done this, but their company persona makes it abundantly clear that they wouldn't approve of people doing this kind of thing.\nAre EULAs legally binding?\nDisclaimer: I am not a lawyer.\nAs to how legally-binding EULAs are, it's a bit of a coin-toss. I'll address the US here, since Apple is an American company, but all of this may not apply to non-US citizens. \nSome court cases have upheld EULAs as legally-binding contracts (ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg is the big one that often gets referred to). There are also court cases that ruled against EULAs being legally binding: (Step-Saver Data Systems, Inc. v. Wyse Technology)\nThen is it legal to build a hackintosh?\nProbably the most relevant case to answer that question is not a EULA case, but Apple vs. Psystar. Apple has successfully shut down the hackintosh company Psystar by claiming not only that they violated Apple's EULA (which is kind of a gray zone as demonstrated above), but also violated Apple's copyright by installing OS X on non-Apple computers. Copyright law is a veritable jungle in the United States, but I would think that this case sets the precedent that hackintoshes are a violation of copyright.\nI would think it's very unlikely that Apple would come down on your friend since he's not selling them or hurting Apple's business, but it probably is legally dubious if not explicitly illegal. Apple likely will come after Hackintosh Zone or Niresh or whoever's behind the cracked software build of OS X that he's using at some point.\nIs it ethical to build a hackintosh?\nThe objective answer is that this is something your friend will have to decide for himself. There's a lot going into this question, that basically boils down to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it ethical for Apple to have such restraints in their EULA? (I personally think not, but as I said that's up to your friend to make that call.)\n\n*Is your friend hurting anyone by building a hackintosh? (He is keeping Apple from one potential mac sale, but would he buy one anyway?)\n\n*Why does your friend feel like he needs to build a hackintosh? (The answer to this one is truly subjective.)\nIs it safe to use a hackintosh?\nMost likely no. OS X has had a couple of serious security issues recently (example 1, example 2), and I'm sure they aren't planning on providing patches for cracked versions of their OS.\n\nA: First off who cares, it is what it is, if hes truly blissfully unaware that it is indeed infact illegal that's his problem not yours. Second the reality of the matter is that it doesnt matter cause apple doesnt care enough to go after individuals for this. Lastly if he wants something free and better than Apple OS point him to distrowatch where he can choose from many different free open source linux distrobutions\n", "Q: My 1/8\" headphone output is not giving me full level in one ear My 1/8\" headphone output is not giving me full level in one ear.  After deciding it was not my headphones or the cable (it worked in my iPhone), I instantly went to turning my mac off and resetting the SMC.  Didn't work.  Do I have a hardware problem that will be a costly repair or is there another way?\n\nA: Short answer:\nWith your headphones plugged in, go to Preferences > Sound, and check the balance between your L and R channels.\nLong answer:\nI read that some people did not hear anything through their headphones and had solved the issue by unchecking the \"mute\" option under the sound section.  Mine was already unchecked.  The balance was fine too, but my headphones were not plugged in.  When I put them in and opened up Preferences > Sound and looked at the balance, it was pushed to the right.

Tapping on it in Pages on iPhone 6 simply rearranged the folders, and I don't have any tags assigned to any files in Drive (either on OS X or elsewhere - all I have in Drive is the example iWork documents).\nEven if it did do anything, I don't think it would do what you're thinking - that's a tab bar, meaning you select one of the choices. It's for sorting the presented list of files/folders, given that it contains Name and Date as well.\nI also can't find anything on tags in relation to iCloud Drive, even for developers.\n\nA: Im running iOS 9 and having the exact same issue. Not only does it as far as I can tell not reliably sort my files by their tags but when I try to search specific tags and filter the results that way it also doesn't work the way it does on the Mac as you've shown.

I've uninstalled the drivers and reinstalled them, I've tried looking for answers in the manual and nothing. \nWhen you want to scan something the scanner says I need to set my computer to scan. When I do that my computer can't find the scanner even though the connection is fine and sometimes it asks me to connect it with a USB cable which I don't have and it didn't follow the printer.\n\nA: Scanning is definitely possible over WiFi using the Pixma iOS app for iPhone/iPad, I use it often this way. To scan wirelessly from a Mac you need to use the Canon IJ Network Scanner Selector to install the scanner. Then you can scan using the Canon IJ Scan Utility 2 or any other scanning application. Note that the manual describes only the locations for Windows, but the utility is also there in Mac OS X if you installed the driver package or can be downloaded separately from the Canon website.\n\nA: I was having the same problem with Canon Pixma E560, can print but can't scan. The solution I found was in firewall settings. Go to firewall options in security & privacy in system preferences. Allow incoming connections for all canon utilities. \n\nA: I was just having the same problem -   I can't just walk to my scanner and press \"scan.\" I just keep getting  an error message saying \"set the PC to start scanning.\"  Finally figured out I have to control my scanner through my computer! It's a simple solution. I'm on a Mac, so I hit the magnifying glass \"search\" in the upper right corner, started searching for  \"Canon,\" and since I'd loaded the software previously,   \"Canon IJ Scan Utility\"  auto-filled in the search bar, along with a list of applications below the search bar. I double-clicked on the application that said \"Canon IJ Scan Utility2\" and my scanner options appeared. I wanted to scan a document, so I hit \"document.\" The message \"searching for scanners\"  appeared, and my Canon started scanning immediately.\nOf course, if \"Canon IJ Scan Utility\" doesn't auto-fill in your search bar, you may need to load the software driver. Good luck!\n\nA: The packaging for the Pixma printers is misleading. It's a wireless printer, but for scanning, you need to either tether to your computer, or plug a USB drive into the printer. When conducting the scan, you'll be prompted to choose the USB drive, and after scans are complete, you can walk the USB to your computer.\n\nA: I was able to scan from my Canon MG7500 scanner to my Mac with the pre-installed Image Capture program.  No need for any Canon software.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Reload your Pixma CD as though you were installing it for the first time.

Time Machine has been backing up to my WD external hard drives for years.  I just purchased a new 2TB My Passport using USB 3.0.  It's formatted in Mac OS Extended (Journaled).  The device shows up on by desktop and it does store files that I drag into it.  However, Time Machine does not recognize it.\nAny thoughts?  Is it Time Machine or the 3.0 USB?\n\nA: The following command line, using tmutil, will force Time Machine to use your mounted disk as its destination. If the disk is mounted as /Volumes/MyBackupDisk, run:\nsudo tmutil setdestination /Volumes/MyBackupDisk\n\nUse sudo tmutil setdestination -a /Volumes/MyBackupDisk if you want to add to existing Time Machine drives\nP.S. tmutil is very useful, also for deleting backups and working over the \"operation not permitted\" error.\n\nA: This article is quite old, but I think is probably the reason…\n\nThe partition map scheme describes how the drive stores its volumes. Drives originally set up for use on Windows usually use the Master Boot Record (MBR) scheme, as opposed to the Apple Partition Map (APM) scheme, the default for PowerPC-based Macs, or the GUID Partition Table (GPT) scheme, the default for Intel Macs. Although OS X supports MBR, there’s a catch: Mac OS Extended volumes can be no larger than 512GB on a drive partitioned with the MBR scheme. So if you have, say, a 750GB or 1TB drive, you must repartition it to use the GPT or APM scheme before it can work with Time Machine.\n\nSource: Macworld - Time Machine tips and troubleshooting\nApple's KB doesn't seem to quite be so explicit - OS X Yosemite: Disks you can use with Time Machine\nYou would need to go to Disk Utility & check the drive is formatted as not only Mac OS X Extended, but that the underlying structure is GUID [most 3rd party drives will arrive as MBR/NTFS usually for Windows]\nYou can only change from MBR to GUID by completely erasing the drive & starting over…\nSelect the drive itself [not the volume].

This morning, I saw a message on my desktop (I didn't shut down) that I failed to eject it properly.\nNow it will not mount.\nIf I run\ndiskutil list\n\nit dosen't show up at all.  It's not there.  Period.\nHowever, in system profiler, it shows up under the USB, but not under the storage.\n\nOk.  So I thought my drive is dying.  If I plug it into another computer, it works perfectly.  In fact, I plugged it into a Surface RT of all things and I was able to read and write with no problem.  It also works on another Mac (MBP 10.10.3) I go back to my iMac with 10.10.3 and nothing—it's like it dosen't exist.\nHere's the kicker: I have another FreeAgent Go drive, exact same model and size as the one that dosen't work, and if I plug it in to the exact same dock, it works.\n\nI have checked my console logs and the only thing that comes up when plug in the failed drive is the error message\n\nUSBMSC Identifier (non-unique): 0x00000000 0xbc2 0x2100 0x0, 2\n\nI have removed all USB drives, did a warm reboot, a cold reboot and even a reboot in safe mode: no joy.\nEverything I have searched for has something about not being able to boot and the fix is repairing the disk via recovery console.  That's not my issue.  I can boot just fine.  I just can't read this USB HDD.  \nAnyone else run into this?\n\nA: For my case:\n\n\n*\n\n*The device doesn't show in Disk Utility \n\n*It does show in System Information under USB \n\n*It works in other computers \n\n*Other USB sticks work in this computer \n\n*Changing USB ports makes no difference\n\n\nI just rebooted the system, then it's mounted and working correctly.\n\nA: I just started having this exact same problem with my FreeAgent Go drive which has always been working perfectly.  Like the original poster I cannot see the drive in Disk Utility but it does show up in System Information.  After a little more digging I found that the OS is trying to repair the volume BEFORE letting Disk Utility see it via an process named \"fsck_hfs\".  When I force quit that process in Activity Monitor (it's owned by Root so you'll need to give it permission), the volume immediately appeared in Disk Utility.  I'm running a repair on it now - fingers crossed.  My guess is that since this is formatted HFS+ Journaled something about the journal consistency got flagged and the OS is attempting to repair it from the journal.  I'm shocked that they hide it from Disk Utility while it's happening though - much better would have been to display the drive there without mounting the partition, and display a message that this is being done.  Oh well at least I can see why Windows would mount it but OSX won't now (any OSX machine would start performing the same repair process).\n\nA: The problem was VirtualBox.  Specifically, the Windows 7 VM instance I had running was \"grabbing\" the device for itself.  So, it unmounted it from OS X and passed the USB port to the VM.  It was doing it automatically so I couldn't see anything.\nTo fix, you uncheck the device next to the USB filter.\n\nThe filter automatically connects a USB device to the VM instance so you don't have to do it manually (like my Zune).\nNow, this is where it becomes confusing...I have  4 VMs running and all are set to autoboot when the host (OS X) starts.  I haven't changed the settings in any of those VMs in at least 2 months and the the Windows 7 machine in at least a year. I don't need to; as everything was working. Now, way back when I was configuring them, I did attach the USB drive to the VM so I could install programs, backup some files etc.  But when I was done, they were disabled.  Somehow, they got re-enabled. \n", "Q: as of 4/2015 OS X Kindle App: Where are the books located?

If this folder doesn't exist or is empty, you can open Terminal and run\nfind ~ -name '*.azw' -print\n\nto search for them within your user folder.\n\nA: In order to access the Kindle Content folder, the actual folders you need to navigate through will be visible. In Finder, click on either the Boot Drive on your desktop, usually your only drive, or on the Boot drive, or the item in your left hand panel that corresponds to your User name, and then navigate to the correct path is as follows:\n~/Library/Containers/com.amazon.Kindle/Data/Library/Application Support/Kindle/My Kindle Content/\n\nOnce you have access to your Kindle content, you can then copy the files to another folder to be processed for conversion, or whatever you plan to do with them. Once you've found your content folder, you can then go into Preferences in the Kindle App and change your destination folder.\n\nA: Kindle.app now uses the Apple Sandbox functionality.\nThis means that it can only affect and see files in a subdirectory under ~/Library/Containers. The .azw files are in ~/Library/Containers/com.amazon.Kindle/Data/Library/Application Support/Kindle/My Kindle Content\nThis directory is shown in the Kindle app in Preferences->General as the value of Content Folder and it appears that this can be changed there.\n", "Q: Flashing question mark when I start my Mac https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204323\nI tried everything in here didn't work. I am using a 13\" macbookpro retina, latest OS.\nStuff I did that might have cause this: \n\n\n*\n\n*I updated 3 apps 1 of them was Xcode, the other was something about OSX, the third I can't remember. \n\n*I installed Cocoapods but never used it. \n\n*Did some tutorials and learned a little bash commands, nothing extreme that should have caused this. \n\n\nAfter these actions I used the mac to write software, browser internet, watch videos, I used it for half a day and nothing weird happened.

If you don't have a backup, try some tools like DiskWarrior or TechTool on the Mac's drive. If those don't help, you'll probably have to format and lose your data.\nIf you can't format the drive, it will need to be replaced. \n", "Q: Do my original photos move to iCloud if imported to Photos? I have a large collection of photos (80Gb) stored on my Macbook and I've imported them to Photos, these are now available through Photos on my other devices with the same iCloud account. Does Apple move the originals into the cloud and free up the 80 Gb space on my Macbook?\n\nA: No - You don't initially save any space on your Mac if you choose iCloud storage.\nYes - if you set \"optimize\" in Photos preferences, then once you fill your storage with other files, the Photos library will shrink itself.\n\nYou can choose to store the original size images in the cloud and let the Photos app \"optimize\" and resample/recompress images to reduce the storage space burden on selected devices.\nFor example, if your 80 GB library is half RAW files and/or very large JPEG files, you might save a substantial amount of space by selecting Optimize and then filling up your storage with other files to trigger the optimization.\n\nAs you can see from Photo preferences, only when you run low on storage space will the optimization start to take place. I've not tested this yet, but hope to try it on a second Mac with limited storage to see how the library looks when space runs low and \"optimization\" kicks in.\n", "Q: Photos storage on iPhone How do I know what photos have been downloaded to Photos on my iPhone? Does Apple continuously remove the copies from my local device after a period of time so that I don't run out of space? E.g., I have 80Gb iCloud storage taken up by Photos. I browse my photos through the iPhone Photos app and it downloads images that I linger on. I only have 12Gb space in total available on my iPhone, will I run out of space in the near future or are these downloads removed and reverted to thumbnails at some point? \n\nA: Yes, your iPhone will remove originals that you have not browsed recently, and then re-download them when you next look at them. If you want to learn more about it, lookup a cache. With the new Photos app, the originals are stored in the cloud, and the images on your phone are just a cache. (Except that when you edit a photo in the cache, Apple preserves both the original and the edits in the cloud.)\n", "Q: Can I contact my friends to post reviews for my app in the App Store? I am releasing a new app to the App Store, and I think that I would be great if I can contact my friends to post reviews on the app. But Apple says that developers that attempt to fake reviews will be expelled from the Developer Program, as indicated in App Store Review Guidelines rule 3.10. However, I also saw an article on the Web that recommends the approach of contacting your friends and acquaintances to post a review on the App Store for your app (thinkapps.com/blog/launch/create-successful-app-4-ways-grow-users, in section Where to Start/Launch/Step 1). So will I be expelled from the Developer Program if I contact my friends to post reviews for my app? Thanks very much.\n\nA: I think if all you're doing is telling your friends about your app and encouraging them to post honest reviews in the App Store, that's probably fine.\nIf, however, you were trying to get your friends who'd never even used the app to positively review it in the App Store, that would probably be considered a breach of that rule.\n", "Q: Connect Apple TV iPad Air and hotel wifi Have iPad Air Apple TV 3rd generation and wireless internet at hotel but cannot get Apple TV to connect cause no login page to accept hotel agreement\n\nA: Try authenticating with the iPad, then mirroring its screen to the Apple TV.

I am seeing baffling behavior with my wireless mouse (connected via USB) and my gigabit ethernet adapter plugged in simultaneously.\nIf my mouse is plugged in and working fine, if I plug in my gigabit ethernet adapter (even without the ethernet port plugged in) to EITHER thunderbolt port, my Logitech m510 mouse stops working completely.\nI have plugged in my external monitor to both thunderbolt ports, and it doesn't affect my mouse at all. What the hell is going on here?\n\nA: The reason you are seeing the symptoms present when you connect an ethernet adapter to the TB port and not when you connect a monitor to the TB port has to do with what is being passed over the TB cable.\nTB multiplexes at least 2 signals over the same connection.  In this case, video and PCIe.  Yes, basically the same PCIe bus that you would find looking inside any computer is now on that cable.\nThunderbolt Technology Brief\nSo, basically speaking, when you are connecting the DP to TB, you only get video.  When you connect the ethernet adapter, you are connecting to PCIe.  When you daisy chain devices, you get both.\nYour mouse stops working because the ethernet adapter is generating noise that is interfering with your receiver.  It is the PCIe \"signals\" that is creating this noise within the ethernet adapter.  It is not interfering with the USB port - just the wireless radio reception/transmission of the receiver.  I know this for a fact because:\n1)  I experienced it myself. I have a Logitech Anywhere MX (non bluetooth) and bought a TB to Ethernet adapter.  I had the same issue.  I changed out my TB to Ethernet adapter to a more reputable brand and the problem went away.\n2)  I found this answer on Logitech support forum\n3)  Plug in a USB hard drive.  If it was interfering with the USB, the hard drive would fail as your mouse does.\nThe reason that when you move it from one port to another it \"sorta\" works is because you have lessened the wireless interference, not eliminated it.\nHere is the Apple Ethernet adapter that I bought that solved my issue.  \nIf you want to confirm this, buy a USB extension cable to move your unifying receiver to another location (sometimes logitech includes this with their mouse).  Or, plug in the unifying receiver into a hub away from the ethernet adapter.  The problem should go away.\n\nA: Well I swapped the USB receiver for the mouse to the other usb port and it seems to be working now but pretty erratically.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with a Logitech wireless mouse. I \"fixed\" it by relocating the mouse dongle. For some reason, when the ethernet cable is plugged in near the adjacent USB port, the mouse gets jittery, sluggish or even freezes. Simply moving the mouse receiver to the front of the case solved the issue, but I really have no idea why the ethernet cable should interfere with the mouse signal. \nDell Optiplex 755 (refurbished SFF)\nWindows 7 Pro 64 bit\n\nA: The problem has nothing to do with the mouse's nano USB receiver or the Thunderbolt Ethernet adaptor, and everything to do with the Thunderbolt port next to the USB port.\nIf you are running Windows on your Mac the Thunderbolt ports are not plug-and-play therefore you can plug a device into the Thunderbolt port and the mouse still works fine, however once you re-boot Windows with a Thunderbolt device, such as the Ethernet adaptor, plugged in and the device is recognized and the Thunderbolt port opened. Even if you \"hot\" unplug the device the Thunderbolt port stays open and continues to cause the problem\nIf you move the mouse within 1 inch of the USB receiver it works, but if it is further away it seem the open Thunderbolt port causes a problem, perhaps distorts the 2.4GHz signal from the mouse, or maybe the motherboard and Thunderbolt and USB ports are not well grounded from Apple.\nThe exact same problems occur even if you are running Apple OS-X Y, the only difference is that the Thunderbolt ports are plug and play therefore the problem is continuous from the time you boot the system no matter whether a Thunderbolt device is plugged in or not.\nIf you disable the Thunderbolt ports in Windows and OS-X Y there is no problem.\nThe question is: is this an isolated problem with just USB Nano receivers, or does the Thunderbolt port cause a problem for any USB device plugged in? If it does, this is a serious design problem because that would mean that a USB hard drive will cease to operate correctly while the Thunderbolt ports are open.\nYes, moving the USB device to the other side of the laptop computer also solves the problem, but that limits the use of all the ports which we paid for.\nMacs were nenver designed to use USB Nano mouse receivers. They were designed to use the Apple mouse which I think is Bluetooth.\n\nA: Try connecting a shielded/braided USB cable between the USB dongle and the USB port. This type of problem is often caused by electrical noise between the ports (generated by USB 3 or thunderbolt circuitry), using a shielded cable helps to absorb the high frequencies.\n", "Q: Recovery HD left in the middle I did some partitioning to install Linux. Then I decided to erase that partition altogether. Now I am left with a configuration like this:\n\nHow can I add the free space to main partition?\n\nA: I created a bootable usb with unetbootin and Gparted. I booted the mac with the stick. i moved my Recovery HD to the end. Then I rebooted normally, opened up Disk Utility, dragged the end of the main partition to the bottom.\n\nA: Another solution is also posted here. It works with standard (build-in) OS X system tools. Depending on your partition table and the CoreStorage listing some slight adjustments may be necessary.\n", "Q: How can I type unicode characters without using the mouse? I want to type unicode characters with the keyboard.  I'm looking for a solution with no mouse usage.  For example, below I have a line with the unicode \"PILE-OF-POO\" character:\n\nThe codepoint for PILE OF POO is U+1F4A9 and on a linux operating system I can create this character by typing:\nCtrl+Shift+u,\n1, \nf, \n4, \na, \n9\nspace\nHow can I do something similar on a mac keyboard?  Other answers I've searched involve fiddling with menus and switching input sources.  \n\nA: U+1F4A9 converts to d83d dca9 in unicode hex input, which is what OS X uses as an official input source across the OS.\nTo use the keyboard directly with their code numbers, first enable Unicode Hex Input in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Sources. Then, each time you wish to use that input method, switch to the Unicode Hex layout (this can be done via a keyboard shortcut that by default conflicts with spotlight) and then hold the option/alt modifier while you type the the utf-16 hex codes you wish (which is really two hex codes for characters beyond the Unicode BMP, such as 1f4a9, which is represented by d83d dca9).\noption held down then d,\n8,\n3, \nd, \nd, \nc, \na, \n9\nA which point, you will have summoned\n\nNot much fun to type.\nIf you have a finite number of such characters you want to make, you can set up keyboard shortcuts for them in system prefs/keyboard/text in the substitutions table.\n\nA: In System Preference, select \"Keyboard\", then select \"Input Sources\". The left hand pane will show your preferred language keyboard, and possibly alternates. If Unicode Hex Input is not there, click the + button beneath; you will get a long list of languages. Scroll to the very bottom and choose others. Unicode Hex Input will appear in the right pane, then click the Add button, bottom right. \nTab over to Shortcuts and choose the shortcut key. AltSpace and CmdSpace may already be taken by Spotlight. Either disable them, or reassign by clicking at the right-hand end of the column and typing your new key. I left them as they were and assigned CtrlSpace for Input sources. \nIf you do that, now when you type CtrlSpace, you will see the little flag, top right of the menu bar change to a U+. You can then enter your hex codes (which you can find out from the Emoji & Character Viewer) by holding Alt while you type the numbers. E.g. for U+2282 SUPERSET OF taken from any lookup source, Alt2282 produced the Set member symbol ⊂.\n\nA: Press Ctrl+Cmd+Space to bring up the characters popover.\n\nThen type in part of the character's natural-language name (eg \"arrow), or the exact Unicode code point (below) and press the down arrow to select the symbol.\n\nThen simply press Enter to insert the character at the location of your previous cursor.\nAdditional information:\nNote the icon in the top right of the character popover.  It changes the popover to the full Character Viewer, which cannot be navigated by the keyboard.  Click the icon in the top right of the Character Viewer to return to the popover.  Many thanks to @Tom Gewecke for this information.\n\nA: Another solution would be creating a custom keyboard layout which will include the characters you want.\nMost of the characters mapped to Option (⌥) + letters (e.g. Ω≈ç√∫˜µ≤≥˚∆˙ƒ∂ßåœ∑...) are probably never used by anyone so those can be remapped to output your own symbols/emojis.\nA mac keyboard layout can be an XML or a .bundle file and you can use the free app Ukelele to clone an existing layout, modify the mappings as you need, and then export and install the new layout. The app is only used the create the layout so it does not need to be loaded in the system memory like some shortcut mapping apps do.\nAlso see https://superuser.com/questions/665494/how-to-make-a-custom-keyboard-layout-in-os-x\n", "Q: Macbook Pro not charging My 2009 Macbook pro is not charging.  I recently bought a new power adapter and when I plug it in the computer starts up fine although the date is set back to Jan 1 2001.

It also always says the battery is at 42%.  The battery has been replaced once about 2 years ago.  When I unplug the power adapter it immediately dies.  Any ideas?\n\nA: Reset the SMC. \nFrom https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295:\n\nOn Mac notebooks with non-removable battery Mac notebook computers\n  that have a battery you should not remove include: MacBook Pro (Early\n  2009) and later, all models of MacBook Air, MacBook (Late 2009), and\n  MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, Early 2015).

Any idea what's the difference between \"Document Container\" and \"Folder Name\"? Also what's the expected value of \"Containing Folder Names\" - a slash-delimited list of folders?\n\nThis question comes to me because they don't seem to work as expected. For instance, I've setup a Smart Folder using \"Folder Name\" like this:\n\nThis doesn’t give me any result at all, despite the fact that I have several pdf documents stored in a folder named \"pdf\". The same goes with \"Document Container\":\n \nFor \"Containing Folder Names\", I don't even know how to specify the value that would hit a match. Trying this one doesn't give results either:\n\n\nA: Document Container seems to be specific to iCloud. And given that the other two reference \"project\", I would guess they are related to Xcode, except I have Xcode installed, and they don't appear on my system. They are probably related to another development IDE.\nTry running this command in Terminal:\nmdimport -A | grep '[Ff]older'\n\nThis will provide a list of metadata attributes installed on your system that contain the word \"folder\" somewhere in their identifier, name or description. \"Folder Name\" and \"Containing Folder Names\" should be contained in that list. All the way to the left on each line it will list an identifier, such as \"com_panic_transmit_dockSendEnabled\", which is the identifier for an attribute installed by Panic Software's Transmit. This should allow you to determine what application installed the attribute.\nIf the attribute identifier instead starts with kMDItem, then it is installed by default (and I'm wondering why I don't have it on my system).\n", "Q: Where does Photos.app store its library and files? I switched from iPhoto to Photos and now one feature that was important to me is missing: \"Show referenced files in Finder\".\nFor example, that feature was useful to me for selective sharing.

Quite obvious actually, it is next to the former iPhoto Library.\n~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary\nResearching a little more, because both libraries report the same size, the import from iPhoto to Photos changed all original files to hardlinks.\nSo either library contains a pointer to one file on disk, thus saving disk space.\nFor a full backup, I think it is sufficient to backup ~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary.\n\nA: If you go to the following path /Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary, then right click on Photos Library.photoslibrary and select ShowPackageContents.  \nThen you can select the masters folder and backup the original photos.\nHope this helps. \n", "Q: Connect from Macbook Air 2012 (thunderbolt port) to dell monitor (displayport) I just bought this Dell UltraSharp U2312HM monitor to use as an external monitor of my Macbook Air 2012 model.\nAnd, I'm looking for a cable that will connect from thunderbolt port (mini displayport) to displayport of the monitor and wanted to confirm\nif this cable is the right one.\nMini DisplayPort to DisplayPort Cable M-M 2m\n\nA: Yes, that looks correct.

It updates the same program copy which was installed by cask.\n\nA: To remove an application cask via Homebrew-cask, run this command: brew uninstall --force --cask <cask_name>\n\nA: No, uninstalling from brew-cask’s uninstall command will not remove the files in Application Support, Caches, Preferences etc. For that you’ll need  a third party app, like AppCleaner or iTrash.

Freezes are usually 2-3 per day, but once it starts freezing it will freeze again in due time\nIt freezes without any beach ball spinning up, the cursor remains where it is and the only solution is shutting it down via the power button.\nWhen I took it from my friend for fixing, it had only 2gb of ram and mavericks installed, and was painfully slow. I thought that was the culprit and installed 4gb of RAM, but it freezed again, today, just after installing the RAM, like nothing changed.\nAHT and memtest won't report any errors, and the system log reports warning like disk swapping but nothing too dramatic. Tried etrecheck too, apple support's app for checking your system and nothing wrong reported here too.\nHere is a list of what I tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*upgraded to 4gb of RAM\n\n*clean reinstall of mac os lion\n\n*tried swapping disk, Mac freezes the same.\n\n*opened up the bottom lid and checked if fan is on, it seems to be\nworking ok.\n\n\nI should add that the macbook has an erratic airport card. It often won't get detected by the system. Could a faulty airport card be the culprit of these freezes?\nI'm pasting what the system.log reported just before this morning's crash (I don't know if it helps):\nApr 29 12:30:44 macbook-di-luca iBackup[376]: \"download and install new plugins\"\nApr 29 12:30:54 macbook-di-luca mdworker[327]: (Error) Import: Couldn't recover plist from xattr com.apple.metadata:kMDLabel_xjx7qauyg5mltgjdmyyeartz4e     \nApr 29 12:31:41: --- last message repeated 5 times ---  \nApr 29 12:33:16 macbook-di-luca KernelEventAgent[43]: tid 00000000 received event(s) VQ_LOWDISK, VQ_VERYLOWDISK (516)   \nApr 29 12:33:17 macbook-di-luca Finder[125]: _GetISImageRefFromIconRefInternal: could not retain image ref 0x213c0055 (err=-2580)\nApr 29 12:33:17: --- last message repeated 1 time ---   \nApr 29 12:33:17 macbook-di-luca UserEventAgent[11]: Cleaning up local snapshots on volume file://localhost/Volumes/WD-GIGI/ \nApr 29 12:33:20 macbook-di-luca Finder[125]: ISGetIconFamilyFromStorage: seed mismatch for 22c20010, actual seed is 109cf92e    \nApr 29 12:33:20 macbook-di-luca Finder[125]: ISGetIconFamilyFromStorage: seed mismatch for 213c0055, actual seed is 39386575    \nApr 29 12:33:22: --- last message repeated 1 time ---\nApr 29 12:33:22 macbook-di-luca xpchelper[481]: for uid: 501 -- timeout while waiting on FSEvents flush; clearing cache.\n\nAfter that it freezed up for good like usual, without any warning. \nThanks a lot for any suggestion and help in advance. I'm quite discouraged and can't seem to find the solution to the problem, and I don't want to start swapping parts randomly.\n\nA: new SSD and new RAM didn't help similar problem here. Also missing airport on reboots occasionally. Suspect it's a current leak problem on the system board. No easy solution to that. Good thing is the fast reboot with the SSD.   \n\nA: I have a suggestion to avoid \"swapping parts randomly\".\nStart by disconnecting all unnecessary parts from the logic board to make a \"minimal machine\".  For example: disconnect optical drive, airport/bluetooth card, speaker (this might seem odd, but I have occasionally found faulty speakers to be the cause of issues which don't seem at all related to sound), battery, leave only one RAM chip installed.\nTest the machine for a day using this minimal machine.\nIf you see a freeze, unfortunately the issue relates to one of the components that remain.  In that situation, try to make the machine even more minimal.  (The ultimate here is logic board, RAM, power input, power button and speaker... if this setup doesn't give the startup chime, one of those components is faulty... unfortunately this won't help with your intermittent freezing, but I mention it to try and illustrate the minimal machine idea a bit more.)\nIf you don't see a freeze, probably the issue is caused by one of the components you disconnected.  Try adding one at a time, repeating the day-long test each time, to narrow down which is the cause.\nAn erratic airport card certainly could be the cause of intermittent freezes.  Before you try the minimal machine idea (which can take some time), I think it's certainly worth testing the machine for a day with that card disconnected.\n", "Q: How do I turn off automatic downloads and updates? I don't see any options for deactivating automatic downloads for OS X and individual apps in the App Store app.\n\nA: You can't disable automatic updates for individual apps.\nThe only options are to have automatic updates, or to not have automatic updates. It is not possible for granular control currently. You can provide feedback to Apple here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html\n\nA: System Preferences → App Store → uncheck options\n\n\n", "Q: Earbuds damaged by iPhone? Yesterday I plugged Apple earbuds into my iPhone 5 and the sound from the right speaker was very low, almost mute.  Assuming something was wrong with them and having just lost the 3rd party earbuds I normally use, I bought another set of 3rd party earbuds in the evening and found them to have the same problem, but now with those the left side is almost mute and the right is fine.  Of course my assumption then was my iPhone has a problem.\nNow I'm at work and just tried the new 3rd party earbuds in the Mac Mini I use, and I have the same problem.\nI really don't know what's going on at this point.  Did the iPhone damage both sets of earbuds?  Over the weekend I stayed in a house that was really cold at night, not sure if that had any effect on the phone; neither set of earbuds were in the house.  I've checked all the sound settings on both devices for sound balance and such, no issues there.\n\nA: Not having the device in person I can only make an assumption. The problem is not the headphones but the audio port on your iPhone.\nThe small connector balls on the inside of the port must be damaged. I'm guessing if you looked inside, there would be one that is stuck in. Try blowing some air in the port or using a small pin to clean the inside. It might still work.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: How to install iDVD on OS X Yosemite or Mavericks? I have an old Macbook with Snow Leopard on it, and a newer Macbook Air with Yosemite, and a newer Macbook Pro with Mavericks.\nThe old Macbook is taking about 4 hours to encode videos to burn to a DVD disc using the highest quality setting, so I wonder if I install it on the Macbook Pro, whether it can be much faster.  However, since iDVD is discontinued since Lion, there might be 2 ways to install it on the Macbook Pro or Macbook Air and I wonder if they will work.\n\n\n*\n\n*Buy iLife 11 (produced in 2011) from Amazon and install on Mavericks and Yosemite... but I wonder how compatible it will be, and whether the installation may write some outdated material over the newer, more current files (of the OS).\n\n*Simply copy the iDVD app from the Applications folder on the Snow Leopard machine to a USB Flash drive and copy it over to the Applications folder of the Mavericks and Yosemite machine.  But is there any side effects of doing so?  Often, the way general users install apps on the Mac is by download a .dmg file, and double click to see a virtual disc, and then just drag the app (which is actually a folder) to the Applications folder. So if I do the method (2) here, isn't the same as the .dmg way of installing an app?\n\nA: iDVD still runs on Yosemite. I haven't tested to see whether it still actually functions correctly, as I have no DVD video player to view the result on.\nEdit 2017: This method apparently still works on Sierra, but I haven't tested.\nI would go for the 'sneaker-net' method of install…\ncopy the app to a USB key & carry it over to one of the other machines.  Will take 2 minutes to discover if that works.\nEdit\nI trawled my boot drive for associated items for iDVD\nIt appears that the themes, which would be installed by the installer live in\n/Library/Application Support/iDVD/Themes & ~/Library/Application Support/iDVD/Installed Themes In folders by version, iDVD 4, 5, 6, 7 etc\nIt would be a simple-enough task to carry these over in the same way.\n\nA: You would need to buy a copy of iLife. Per comments found here you might want to buy iLife '09 (iDVD 7.0) and then enable updates in the application so it will download the newest version. If you go with iLife '11, it contains iDVD but does not contain some of the themes found in iLife '09.\n\nA: iDVD does not work on my 27\" iMac OS X 10.11.1  El Capitan. Apple says DVD production market has disappeared so they don't put anymore time in developing software or keeping the existing (iDVD) software working on the new system software (El Capitan).\nTip they gave: downgrade your system software or buy an old Mac for iDVD only.\nOr: try to use an external harddisk with older software and reboot your mac through the hdd for iDVD only and reboot from your internal disk and live in the present.\n", "Q: Do I need to upgrade my late 2011 Macbook Pro I currently own a MacBook Pro, Late 2011, With a 2.4ghz intel core i5, 4gb memory DD3. I use my mac mostly for web browsing and iTunes, and use (bootcamp) windows for programming. Recently, I have seen my mac slow down at times. When I click an application on my dock, takes aprox. 5-10 secs to open the application. I have seen lag when having multiple applications open at once. Running Windows 8, I do not see any lag unless I am running the debugger on visual studio but that could a VS issue. One of the reasons I want to upgrade is booting time. I am constantly changing going from OSX to Windows and can take up to 30-45 seconds to boot into either operating systems.\nMy question is asking for your opinion of what Should I do to improve performance. Do I upgrade my current MacBook as it is still In good condition and runs relatively fine. Or do I buy a new Mac with a better processor, more ram? \n\nA: TL;DR: upgrade your laptop with at least 8 GB RAM (2 x 4 GB) and a quality SSD.\nI have the exact same 13\" MacBook, same original specs and everything.  I got it used and immediately upgraded to 8GB RAM and a 128 GB Samsung 840 Pro SSD. It absolutely flies now!\nI use various IDEs, Logic Pro for making music, VLC to watch videos, lots of MS Word and Excel, and sometimes have ~20 tabs open in Chromium, never have any problem with speed or system freezes. It runs like a clock, whatever I throw at it.\nThe cost of the upgrade was about $240 (at the time) and it gave this computer a new life. Absolutely worth it. Note:  I used an optical bay adapter to install a second hard drive and have the SSD paired with a 500 GB 7200 RPM Seagate HDD.\nFor your particular usage profile, the only thing you would likely notice in going from an upgraded 2011 MBP to a 2015 MBP of same specs is an increase in battery life.  Probably not worth the extra $1000, since you didn't list battery life as a problem.\n\nA: It is about that time to start looking into your options at upgrading your laptop...probably wait till about June or July to see the new models...I have the same model. My video card finally canned today. Luckily for me, there were many 2011 models that had a defective video card too, so they are currently fixing it for free. The Mac guy told me that around that 4 year mark, your hard-drive might start to go too...so beware. \nI agree, maxing out your RAM will show a significant increase in your performance.... I would also suggest doing a clean install of Yosemite. It will be like having a new Mac all over again. Those are inexpensive things you can do to help out your Mac for now. \n", "Q: Is it possible for search terms to appear in the search bar of an iPad just from going to a \"bad\" website? I was told that some search terms appeared in the search bar of an iPad because that person had gone to a \"bad\" website and the terms must have come from that visit.\n\nA: The search bar should only offer suggestions based on your website history, your bookmarks, or searches that you have typed in and hit enter for.\nIt won't scour the pages you have been to, looking for related terms.\n\nA: There is always the potential for typos to generate irritating additions to your search.\nImagine you frequently visit porkchop.com [I have no idea if it actually exists, that's irrelevant] yet one day you accidentally typo pornchop & hit enter… and contra to all expectations that site actually exists.  \nAfterwards, every time you type por Safari will show you both sites as potentials.\nI once typo'd something [I don't know what I typed, but I meant to type home] into Google Maps so it would show me the route…\n…for 3 months afterwards until it eventually fell off the popular list, the first option it always wanted me to go to was the Houses of Parliament at Westminster...\n", "Q: Command and Option keys not working on one keyboard (not hardware) I am using a PC keyboard on my Mac. Today, it stopped recognizing the Command and Option keys.\nThis likely happened because I experimented with Karabiner and Yosemite Modifier Keys yesterday.\nI have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resetting modifier keys to defaults.\n\n*Checking private.xml through Karabiner (blank).\n\n*Undoing my settings on Karabiner.\n\n*Uninstalling Karabiner entirely.\n\n*Restarting OS X.\n\n\nNone of these things have worked. Keyboard Viewer is not registering key presses on Cmd (Windows key) or Option (Alt). Any ideas?\n\nA: I opened \"Keyboard Preferences\" and clicked on the Modifier keys. Clicked on \"Restore to defaults\". And the modified keys started working again. After that I switched the modifier keys back to my preferred set. And things are still working. Feel quite good. It saved me an avoidable reboot.\nI am in such a similar issue often. The problem used to get fixed after restart (probably will also work, after logout/login -- did not check). Today it happened again. I tried the defaults method above and it worked.\n", "Q: Multiple finder preference plists in mavericks I’ve had a very sluggish Finder recently on my Mid-2012 MBP 16GB 2.6GHz i7. \nLooking online I found that deleting the Finder preferences can solve the issue, but when I went to the Preferences folder to look for com.apple.finder.plist I also found files like these: com.apple.finder.plist.DUkfEQe and com.apple.finder.plist.DUkfEQe2 and others with random strings at the end. Any idea what these are and which one is my 'actual' finder plist?\n\nA: The com.apple.finder.plist file is the actual file.  I believe the ones with a random extension are renamed originals used to hold the changes until the .plist file is updated and then are deleted.\n", "Q: How can I prevent TextEdit from saving previous versions of a text file? I've got a simple text file that I keep in Dropbox for holding important notes.  I've name it so it shows up at the top of the directory, so that it is quickly accessible from anywhere - on my Mac, tablet, phone, etc.\nThe problem is, when I edit it on my Mac, TextEdit appears to be saving previous versions using some weird file naming scheme.  For instance, my file is called 000-Inbox.txt, and I see lots of files with names like 000-Inbox.txt.sb-abc123cb-XaedKL.  Currently I am counting twenty-two (22) (!) of these \"backup\" files.  This really messes up my directory listing; now all the other files which are supposed to be easily accessible at the top of the listing are pushed down out of site on my mobile devices.  My directly looks unsightly as well.  I don't want or need these files: Dropbox saves previous versions anyway, now it presumably is saving previous versions of previous versions which is just silly.\nI've tried deleting these files, but it is rather a chore to have to delete a file every time I save a file.  Is there some way to disable this previous version saving?  \nAnother issue it presents is if I change the file on another device, I have to close the file and reopen it, because reverting to the previous version is going to the previous version TextEdit has saved, not the latest version on disk.\n\nA: TextEdit and other app have a auto save feature enabled.\nYou can disable that in System Preferences:\nOpen the General preferences and enable the \"Ask to keep changes\", so it wont auto save, but ask you if you want to save it. This one would be system wide.\nTo do it only for TextEdit:\nTo disable autosave in TextEdit.app, run the following command in Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.TextEdit ApplePersistence -bool no\n\nTo turn it back on replace the no with yes.\n", "Q: Two identical iCloud Group lists in Contacts For some reason - & this has been the case for as long as I remember, years at least - I have two sets of iCloud Contacts in my Contacts address book.\nOne is called 'iCloud (me.com) the other just 'iCloud'\nThe content of each is identical, except for one thing, & I'm a bit scared to test this too hard for fear of breaking something...\nIf I delete a contact group from either list, it deletes it from both after showing the sync 'wheel' for a couple of seconds.\nThe difference is…\nIf I do this from 'iCloud' then  Cmd ⌘   Z  to undo, it restores the group to both lists within seconds.\nIf I delete from 'iCloud (me.com)' then undo, the group is not restored to the 'iCloud' list\nHas anyone any clue as to why this may be & if it is truly safe to delete one list entirely?\nSorry for all the blurriness ;-) The highlighted group is the one I just deleted then undid, which didn't return it to the duplicate group. The actual contacts, btw are still preserved in both lists, even though the group has now gone.\nIncidentally - my iPhone shows only one list… & appears to be a mirror of the 'iCloud' list [the bottom one in the picture, with one group now missing]\n\n\nA: Found it!\nI have no idea how it actually was set up, as I discovered a pref pane through another question on Ask Different which I'd never seen before…\nSystem Prefs > Users & Groups >[unlock] > Right click user name > Advanced Options...\nMy user@me.com account was listed twice in aliases.\nI deleted one - the duplicate iCloud account in Contacts disappeared.\nSo far I've seen no unwanted  side-effects.\n", "Q: Keychain trouble after changing password I have recently migrated from a time machine backup of my previous mac. I have three different accounts on both my macs and two of these seem to work well. However, when I log in to the third account, I have some problems, especially on the new mac.\nI have changed the password for all three users using the dialogue in system preferences.\nEvery time I log in, I see a screen that asks me to change my keychain password, or create a new keychain. When I choose to change my password, no input seems to be valid. When I create a new keychain, that does not seem to help either.\nAfter choosing either continue logging in or choosing to create a new keychain, my mac will then ask me to log in with my apple id, which I can also decline. \nIf I continue past the apple id dialogue, my mac tells me: \"Setting Up Your Mac...\" which is pretty scary, considering it is already \"Set up\". Fortunately so far it has not wiped my HD.\nIt then logs me in into my user account and most of the time I get a lot of messages telling me that this and that process wants to access my login keychain.\nI have tried deleting my keychain folder located at ~/Library/Keychains, as well as changing my password for the different keychains and checking the synchronise my keychain my user account checkbox under the preferences of the keychain utility. I have also tried to use the \"Reset My Default Keychain\" button. Two of these strategies are listed here. Unfortunately none of these seem to work.\nSometimes when I try to change the keychain password I find that I have to use my old password, sometimes the new one, and sometimes no input appears to get accepted (the last case happens when I try to change it from the dialogue that pops up when I try to log in).\nOn my previous mac I was also experiencing problems with this account. In particular it seems that any system preferences that I modified for would only last for one session, and would be forgotten when restarting my mac. One example is the hiding of the dock and also on my new mac osx forgets that I want to hide the dock.\nQuestion: Does anybody know what is causing all this?\n\nStrongly related: How do I delete or fix my Keychain after changing my password?\n\nA: There might be a problem with the users home folder permissions.\nRepairing Disk Permissions in Disk Utility, will only affect things outside your Home folder, though.\nThere is a home folder reset routine if you boot into Recovery (cmd+r).\nOnce booted, Open Terminal from the Utilities menu.\nType resetpassword and hit return. (no worry you will NOT be resetting the password)\nSelect your hard disk, then the user.\nClick the Reset Home Folder Permissions and ACLs button.\nQuit the utility and restart.\n", "Q: How to find rt.jar file? My virus scanner (Sophos) showed that it was scanning a file named rt.jar plus several other .jar files.

You don't need to download or install any extra applications.\nSimply issue the command:\nsudo find / -name rt.jar\n\nIt will ask your for your password; enter it.  Find will go through all of your directories and when it finds any instances of \"rt.jar\" it will output the directory to your screen.  You can then navigate to that directory via finder or through the terminal via the \"cd\" command\ncd /the/path/where/find/located/your/file\n\nyou can delete it if you like with the \"rm\" command\nrm rt.jar\n\nIf you want to see files in Finder just issue these commands in Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE; killall Finder\n\nAfter that, you will be able to search and view all of the hidden files. \nIf you want to go back to the default view just change the \"TRUE\" to \"FALSE\"\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE;killall Finder\n\n", "Q: How to fix \"xvinfo: Unable to open display /private/tmp/.../org.macosforge.xquartz:0\" error?

A couple of days after the update, I was watching a movie on my TV screen via HDMI. In the middle of the movie I removed the HDMI cable from the MacBook Pro and everything freezes. I forced shut down (Note: My HDD was encrypted). After I forced shut down, I tried to turn on and the loading screen would never stop loading - like, 14 hours stuck with the progress bar. Since I have backups, I decided to access DU and format my HDD. I tried everything. For real. Every command line I could type on Terminal to format, repair, erase and/or partition. I read almost every issue-related questions on the forums and stack exchange groups for a week (even posted my issue here: Erasing and Partitioning Hard Drive from Internet Recovery).\nSo, I decided that it was a HDD failure and bought a new one.\nI bought the Seagate 1TB SSHD Hybrid  - ST1000LM014. Installed the new fresh disk and guess what? All those same problems again. I´m not able to restore from Time Machine because it doesn't recognize the disk in the restore page. But the disk is recognized in the DU. When I try to erase or partition the new SSHD, the same old errors: File system formatter failed. Yes, I tired GUID Partition Table, all of the security options, etc.\nPlease. Any light that you can throw at this issue, I'll be very grateful for.

The design of the SATA cable path is so prone to failure....it's obvious!\n\nA: You might have blown the logic board…might have.\nThat unit uses an integrated I/O and video controller. I'd be afraid that pulling the video cable out may have produced a transient that damaged part of it. You might want to try putting one of the drives in an external case and see if it can work that way. Another possibility could be the SATA cable itself blew somehow (once again, transient).\n", "Q: How do I restore icons in Finder?

Now, especially after an application’s been open a few minutes, it takes forever from the time I press the mouse button on text until I can drag it. (If I try to drag it before the cursor changes form the text-insertion icon to an arrow, the text is deselected.) I’ve timed the delay a few times, and the longest one was about 35 seconds from mouse-down to cursor-change.\nI started noticing this about six months ago. The only change to the system that I can think of that coincided even slightly was Yosemite. I’ve noticed it mostly in Scrivener, which is almost always where I drag text. But it also occurs in Calendar and Mail. \nClosing the app and reopening it fixes it for a minute.\nI’ve tried the Terminal command to eliminate the delay, and it seems to have no effect.

I'm trying to upgrade my browser, as Gmail says it's out of date, and I can't access the playlist on amazon prime.\nI am not sure how to upgrade my browser.

I would recommend not using Safari on 10.6.8, since it is unsupported by Apple at this point, and the older versions of Safari have known compatibility / security issues.\nThe best way to \"upgrade\" would just be to install a third party browser (Chrome or FireFox, which I linked to below) and those issues should go away.\nTo clarify, Safari is a fine browser on later versions of OS X; specifically ones that Apple still releases security patches for.\n\nSafari\nOn Snow Leopard, Safari cannot be upgraded past version 5.1.10. Wikipedia article\nFireFox\nIt appears that you can install the latest version of FireFox, according to the system requirements for FireFox 37 page on mozilla.org\nGoogle Chrome\nGoogle Chrome's official download page says that the latest version runs on 10.6.x Google Chrome Download Page\n\nA: You cannot upgrade Safari beyond 5.1.10 on Snow Leopard.\nAt the moment, if you want a modern browser, your only option is Firefox. Safari on Snow Leopard is too outdated and many pages refuse to work (like youtube). Chrome does not work (I've tried it), despite Google claiming on their page that it should work on 10.6.8. \nI've tried a number of other alternative browsers like Vivaldi, Midori, Pale Moon, QupZilla, Opera etc. and none of them support Snow Leopard. \n\nA: I am still using an old Macbook 1.1 as well. This cannot be upgraded past Snow Leopard. Safari works but there are a lot of issues with it that I have given up the gas on it.  Chrome no longer works and Firefox now is no longer supported (So much for their open web mantra).  The only option that I can find is Sea Monkey.  It works but there are issues with it.  Videos in social media sites like Facebook don't always play. It can crash, but remember Sea Monkey is a browser suite of software products not just a browser. So the best option is to make sure you have very little open in the background. Also keep in mind your Mac is around 10 years old.  That is a long time for a free lunch. So bear in mind to upgrade your Mac soon.  It doesn't have to be the latest and greatest.

By that I mean that if I hit restart whilst in Windows, my computer would restart and boot up Windows and likewise for OS X. Ever since I was messing around with my system preferences and selected a startup disc, I now have to pick weather I want it to always restart in OS X or always in Windows. How do I get it back to the way it was (or was it never that way)? Thanks.\n\nA: The answer is it was never worked that way. If you want it to work that way, you have to install a boot manager.  The most common free one is call rEFInd. Most people install this software in the OS X partition, but this can lead to problems when you install updates. I installed rEFInd in its own partition to avoid such problems.\nI would go with @ryebread's answer and just use either \"Startup Disk\" on OS X System Preferences or \"Boot Camp\" menu on Windows Control Panel. An example of this is shown below. Here, Windows is set as startup.\n\nIf I want to switch to OS X, then I need to click on the OS X icon to highlight it. This is shown below.\n\nI am now set to boot to OS X. There is no need to do a Restart. I can just close the window. \n(Actually in practice, you will probably end up selecting the Restart button.)\nUpdate 1:\nIf you want to boot from OS X to Windows while leaving OS X as the default, then you would need to enter the bless command from a Terminal application window. Or, you can create a script launched as a Service via the Automator application. An example script is given here.\nUpdate 2:\nAfter some testing, I found if no system is highlighted in the Startup Disk window, then the computer always boots to OS X. I am not sure what your computer was doing originally. I think what you want is for the computer to always boot to the last operating system  that ran. If this is true, then rEFInd is probably the best way to go. On my computer, rEFInd only occupies 6 MB of space. If you need help installing, let me know.\nBTW, I removed the highlighting by blessing a flash drive.\n\nA: Firstly, if you hold down the Option key just after the boot chime, you can get to a \"boot menu\" where you can select the drive that you want to boot from.  It will look something like this:\n\nSecondly, selecting your boot drive in System Preferences does exactly what you are describing.  You select Windows, and then it boots to Windows.  When you restart, you come back to Windows.  When you switch to boot from OS X in the boot selector from within Windows, then you will boot into OS X until told to boot to Windows.\nAFAIK, if you switch the boot drive from the Option boot menu, that is a temporary change, and the next reboot will be whatever is selected in System Preferences.  I don't have a dual-boot machine here to test that theory, unfortunately.  However, since that boot menu can be used to boot onto optical media as well, it would make sense that it is a temporary change.\n", "Q: Mac Mini running Yosemite 10.10.3 Won't Recognize Mouse Neither my wireless Magic Mouse, nor my battery operated mouse will work with my Mac Mini, despite many attempts, including unplugging, etc.  The mouse curser appears on the screen but doesn't click.  The Magic Mouse isn't recognized, however they  both continue to work fine with my MacBook Air\n\nA: I think you are referring to your mouse.  Your cursor is the little black arrow on the screen.  The mouse is the physical hardware that you hold in your hand.\nTerminology aside, there are several points of clarification that we need from you, in order to help you better.\nIf you are referring to Apple's Magic Mouse, then there is nothing to \"unplug\" to reset. (other than the removal of the batteries.)  The first thing you should check is that Bluetooth is turned on under System Preferences.  You can search Bluetooth Preference in spotlight, and it should be the first hit.\nNote that a bluetooth mouse can only be paired to one computer at a time.  If you paired it to your MacBook Air, it will no longer be associated with your Mini, until re-paired with your Mini.  At that point, it will no longer work on your MacBook Air.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro trackpad click I am new to the MacBook Pro laptop.

It is a great app for things like this. It has many uses including the one you have described and for many other things as well. You could have it send you and SMS when a certain event happens, if you have the HUE light system it could change the color of the light bulb or flash the light so many times when an email come in from a specific person, etc. It is not just for email. It ties into many different services and apps. \nFor your needs:\nFirst search for IF by IFTTT in the app store and download it. \nNext create a recipe:\nFor the trigger set it to gmail for a new email based on your criteria you need.  \nFinally add an action to call you based on that trigger and save the recipe.\nThis is based on you having the gmail app installed.

It's running Yosemite 10.10.3. The graphics card uses the AMD drivers that ship with OS X.\nI am having graphical glitches - a couple of different ones, but this is the one that's bugging me the most right now. (Link is to a screen recording made with QuickTime Player.)\nThe system upgrades mentioned above happened in February, and I have only noticed this issue within the last month-ish, so I don't think they are related. I did notice this issue before upgrading OS X from 10.10.2 to .3, so I don't think that's related either.\nIt only appears to happen in Chrome, although oddly, one of the glitches that happens (not caught in the video, sadly) is a black rectangle appearing over the middle of the menu bar, outside of Chrome's window - but only when Chrome is in the foreground. Switching to any other application when that happens causes the black box to disappear instantly. Another manifestation places a gray rectangle over the middle of the tab bar. Clicking on a couple tabs usually makes it disappear, as does, again, switching applications.\nI found what may be a related bug in the Chromium bug tracker, but I am not seeing the extensive corruption/glitches shown in the screenshot attached to the bug (maybe I'm lucky?!?), nor am I seeing any issues in webpages themselves, only the tab bar, address bar and bookmark bar. I did add comments on that bug though.\nI was using Chrome beta (stable version + 1 basically) but have reverted to Chrome v42.0.2311.135 stable and am experiencing the same problems. I have disabled all extensions and Chrome hardware acceleration and the problem persists.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: After seeing it in Firefox too, I decided it must be hardware-related. To avoid having to open up the Mac and change out the graphics card (which required a bit of effort to get the new card in there in the first place, due to it not aligning precisely with the PCI slot opening in the back), I tried changing out the cord. (I recently switched from having it plugged in with a DVI output -> DVI cable -> DVI input on monitor to a Mini DisplayPort output -> MDP/VGA adapter -> VGA cable -> VGA input, and the cord has issues I guess.)\nIt seems to have resolved the issue.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install App in iPhone directly without iTunes or Appstore?

Thus at the moment I have only 1 hdmi, and 2 sub entries available to connect the additional monitor which has vga out. \nHow can you recommend setting up this dual monitor setup?\n\nA: If I understand your configuration, you have:\na. macbook, plus two external displays\nb. two thunderbolt ports, one for ethernet, one for display\nc. one hdmi port for the other display\nFor the VGA display, you need a Mini DisplayPort-to-VGA adapter.\nAnd the HDMI display can be simply hooked to the HDMI port.\nNow, to display different desktops:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go System Preferences >> Mission Control\n\n*Tick the Displays have separate Spaces\n\n*Set the other checkboxes according to how you prefer to work.\n\n*After step (2), you will be able to set different desktop backgrounds (for each display; the background will be reused when you add Spaces to a given display).\n\n\nA: Connect the display and deactivate mirroring in system preferences. \nTo connect the display user any of your free ports (HDMI or Thunderbolt) with an adapter do VGA. \nIf your first screen has Thunderbolt, you can daisy-chain an adapter through the display. \n", "Q: Whats a keyboard shortcut for cycling through open windows in Mail.app on Yosemite?

What is going on? \n\nA: As far as I know, Google still considers some apps (including Apple's) to be less secure, as they call them. As a solution to be safe, they can force you to reauthenticate from time to time.\nMy solution, that I'm happy with so far, is to use their App Passwords for every single app that is less secure and does this annoying reauthentication step.\n\nA: I've been searching for a solution to this for a long time and haven't found something suitable. As noted by @michal, Google was requiring App Passwords for different apps in OSX but as of 10.10.3, that requirement has been removed.\nNote: If you have iOS 8.3 on your iPhone or OSX 10.10.3 on your Mac, you will no longer have to use App passwords to use 2-Step Verification.1\n", "Q: Backup Disk 'doesn’t contain an EFI system partition' I have a 750GB Western Digital external HDD which I use for Time Machine backups (MBP, OS 10.10.3). Today I had the need to boot to recovery, which I did from said backup. But I was unsuccessful in doing it again, whenever I booted with ⌘-R, OSX went straight to internet recovery. I can still boot to recovery from it by holding ⌥ at boot and choosing the disk.\nNow, when booting from my internal disk and running a Verify Disk on the backup drive, it says \nError: This disk doesn’t contain an EFI system partition. If you want to start up your computer with this disk or include it in a RAID set, back up your data and partition this disk.\n\nMeanwhile, running diskutil list reveals\n/dev/disk3\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *750.1 GB   disk3\n   1:         Microsoft Reserved                         134.2 MB   disk3s1\n   2:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk3s2\n   3:                  Apple_HFS WD                      749.6 GB   disk3s3\n\nI never bothered to check it before, so I do not know if something has changed there, but firstly, I do not know where the Microsoft Reserved partition comes from, or what it is, secondly, I can see the EFI partition, so why does Disk Utility ignore it? And how do I make it useable for recovery without erasing all data? \n\nA: Unless I'm missing something here it shouldn't be much more complicated than booting into your recovery partition (assuming it's working correctly), reinstalling OS X and then restoring your data from the TM backup on your WD drive when prompted at the end of the OS X installation process.\nIf you have issues with the recovery partition go for Internet Recovery instead, using Disk Utility to erase your drive before attempting an OS X installation. This will allow the OS X installer to create a new clean recovery partition that should be accessible from CMD + R.\nThe WD drive should be usable for recovering your data in its present state as Time Machine will alert you the first time you try to use a drive if it has an incompatible file system. As you've made a TM backup the drive must already be correctly formatted. The EFI issue should only really affect you if you are trying to boot from the external drive, which you're not as it doesn't have OS X installed on it. If you've any doubts about your external WD drive then repartition it once you've restored your old data, this should flush out the Microsoft system partition and create a new EFI partition in the correct location on the disk.\n", "Q: Finish current album and queue next album In iTunes 12 how do I finish the current album and then queue another album.

I have checked my icloud and do not see this device in the list.  I have since changed the password to the icloud and my email.  Any direction would be helpful. \nThank you\n\n\nA: That alert will popup every time someone link your Apple ID to a new device. \nShort answer: if it's not your Mac, yes your account is compromised. \nWhen you try to activate FaceTime or other Apple service on devices you have to log in using you Apple ID and password. So basically someone just entered this info. \nFirst thing to do is to change your password, secret question and answer.

It validates the symbol and then does nothing. I have to remove a current stock and then only will it let me add a new one.\nIs there a max number of stocks I can watch on the list? I only have 20ish stocks right now.\nI tried to add/remove the widget and that did not work.\n\nA: You can find the default Dashboard widgets in /Library/Widgets. They are written using JavaScript, so it's pretty easy to access the code. For example if you right-click on the Stocks widget and choose \"Show Package Contents\" you will find a file called \"Stocks.js\" inside the bundle that contains the logic behind the widget.\nOn line 1319 of that file there is a function called \"addOrSelectItem\".\nAside from defining variables, the first thing that function does is check to see whether you are trying to add an existing stock (line 1321), if you are then it just selects the existing stock in the UI. However if you are adding a new stock the next thing it does is check if there are less than 20 stocks (line 1323), if there are less than 20 then it adds the new one. If there are already 20 stocks then it does nothing.\nSimplified code below. The comments are Apple's comments. Clearly having more than 20 stocks is not \"correct\". :)\nfunction addOrSelectItem () {\n    var index = symbolAlreadyInSet(lastValidEntry.symbol);\n    if (index < 0) {\n        // make sure we have the correct number of items\n        if (allTheData.length < 20) {\n            ...\n        }\n    } else {\n        // select the item that is already there.\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\nIn theory someone could make a copy of that Stocks.wdgt file, open it up, change that single line in a text editor to allow more than 20 stocks and save it. Obviously distributing that modified version would be a bad thing, but modifying a copy for your own personal use shouldn't be a problem.\nIf you do create your own version you might need to kill the Dashboard process for it to notice the changes. Just select it in Activity Monitor and Quit it, it'll automatically relaunch.\n\n\nA: The stocks widget for OS X is limited to 20 stocks. \nThis is from my experience and testing. I'm an app developer on all Apple platforms, iOS and OSX. \nI have several macs running different versions and all hit the 20 mark and stop. \nI have tried many combinations and have not passed 20. \n", "Q: Show read instead of delivered on my device for messages I send All my friends and I have read receipts turned on, and on their phones, delivered turns to read, but mine never does!\nCan anyone tell me why and how to sort it so mine turn to read as well?\n\nA: I'm assuming you are talking about the default Apple messaging app - iMessages. In iMessages, you (as a sender) can set your iMessage Read Receipt to ON/OFF. If it's set to ON on YOUR phone, when a person sends you an iMessage text and you read it, they will get a READ indicator on their phone. \nConversely, if you send a text to a person who has set their Read Receipt to off, you will only see \"Delivered\" when the text was delivered. There will be no \"read\" in this case.\nTake a look at this Engadget article which describes this in depth. \n\nApple's iMessage app provides message status updates that let you know\n  when a message has been delivered. It also has a handy feature called\n  Read Receipts that lets you know when someone has read the message.\nThis status update can be a blessing when you want someone to know\n  automatically that you have viewed their time-sensitive response.\n  Apple handles the status update so you don't have to do anything other\n  than open the message. Just read the iMessage and the sender will see\n  the \"Read\" timestamp in their timeline.\nAs useful as the Read Receipts feature may be, it also can cause angst\n  both for the sender and recipient. You can imagine the following\n  scenario -- a wife discovers she is pregnant and sends an excited\n  message to her husband. She sees that he read the message an hour ago\n  and is upset because he never responded. On the other end is the\n  husband, who viewed the message right before an important meeting. He\n  now is agonizing over how to respond while his boss is breathing over\n  his back, knowing that his wife is aware of the fact that the message\n  has been read.\nIf you wish to avoid such complicated message relationships, you can\n  easily turn off read receipts, which hides the fact that you have read\n  a message from the sender. The sender will still see the \"delivered\"\n  status, so they can be assured the message arrive on your handset.\n  They just won't know if or when you have read the message. Follow\n  these steps to turn off Read Receipts...\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro (2012 - MD101LL/A): Superdrive to SSD swap?

Now that the CoC game had a new update, it needs his apple ID to update it. But unfortunately I can't contact him. Is there another way for me to use my account? Please help me\n\nA: Unfortunately when you download apps, you take responsibility over the app.\nIf you want to update the app, you can do so by creating your own apple ID and downloading CoC (be sure to delete the app first).\nThis method works, and you can now download other apps – one major downside though, you lose progress on your Clash of Clans\n", "Q: How do you control the security of Firefox browser in Yosemite to run educational Java app? I am trying to run the following Java applet in the following web page:\nhttp://artint.info/demos/rl/q.html\nHowever, Firefox is blocking it due to a security issue. Not sure if it's an Apple issue but I tried adding it to the exceptions but it didn't do anything.\nI have attached screen shots of what the browser is showing me:\n\nand this too:\n\nand:\n\nAnyone knows how I run can it on my computer? In the browser or not?\n\nA: The issue isn't with Firefox or Apple. It is Java itself that is blocking the application.\nThe way to fix this is to add the website to the Exception Site List within Java Control Panel.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences and click on Java, which should launch Java Control Panel.\n\n*Select the Security tab and click the \"Edit Site List...\" button near the bottom.\n\n*Then on the Exception Site List window, click Add to add a new blank line and paste in the address for the website. Then click OK on the Exception Site List window and you should now have something like this...\n\n\n\nIf you close and reopen Firefox now it should prompt you to \"Allow artist.info to run 'Java Applet'?\" and if you click allow it should now load the applet.\nIf you've tried this and it hasn't worked, something might be remembering a previous decision. Try clicking the \"Restore Security Prompts\" button at the bottom of the Security tab in Java Control Panel, or clicking Firefox's plugin icon in the left corner of the address bar (the one that looks like a Lego brick) to get it to allow the Java plugin.\nAdding the site to the exception list, closing and reopening Firefox worked for me with Firefox 37.0.2 on Yosemite 10.10.3 and Java 1.8.0_45.\n", "Q: Make app notifications ring as loudly as the phone I have a the IFTT app set up to send me very important ios notifications. I need it to wake me up at night. How can I make the notification sounds max loudness and ring for as long as a phone ring?\n\nA: The phone ringing is, technically speaking, a notification sound, and uses the same volume setting as all other notifications (called Ringer Volume).\nAs far as notification tone length, you would need to contact the app's developer. You cannot set custom tones (at least, outside the app) for 3rd-party iOS apps like you can with Phone, Messages, etc.\n", "Q: How to put Photos.app main library on an external disk? I am using the new Apple Photos app on Yosemite, but I don't want to use iCloud for my photos, and I don't want to keep all of them on my computer. So I as wondering if it is possible to have my main photo library on an external network drive, and to sync only some of them with my computer.\n\nA: You do it exactly the same way as iPhoto:\nMake sure the drive is formatted Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\n \n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Photos\n \n\n*Copy the Photos Library from your Pictures Folder to the External Disk.\n \n\n*Hold down the option (or alt) key while launching Photos. From the resulting menu select 'Choose Library' and navigate to the new location. From that point on this will be the default location of your library.\n \n\n*Test the library and when you're sure all is well, trash the one on your internal HD to free up space.\n \n\n\nThe option in Preferences allowing designation of a System Library refers exclusively to a scenario where a: there is more than one Library and b: one is using iCloud. As only one library can be used with iCloud, that's how you nominate your preferred one. It has no role in moving the Library.\nRegards\n \n\nA: You can change the library location from the Preferences window on the General tab. Photos > Preferences... and select the General tab.\nAt the top where it says Library Location: click the Show In Finder button:\n\nIn the Finder window that opens, move the Photos Library.photoslibrary to the place where you'd rather it exist. This can take some time if it's a large library.\nOnce it's moved, double click on it in Finder and your Photos app will update and point to the new location. \n\nA: The top answers are good, but the completely correct answer is to manually switch between the libraries when necessary by repointing the app to the library you wish to manipulate. This implies you need to manually import your photos from the laptop library when you want to archive them to the external library (photos older than 1 yr per your example). I used apps that were developed for the iPhoto app in the past to do just that. They automated switching libraries and I archived via importing into the \"master\" library. Unless metadata can be lost through an import or some type of issue similar to that which I am not aware of, I don't see anything wrong with this tactic.\n", "Q: Photo captions not showing up on photos when viewed slideshow mode in Photos.app The captions I added to my photos in iPhoto are not showing up when I play slideshows in Photo. I can still see that the information is there when I click on a photo's Info in the album view.\nIs there a way to have the captions show up in slideshow mode in Photos.app?\n\nA: There are no settings for this, and it does not appear to be possible.\nThis is further confirmed by MacWorld's article on \"4 things iPhoto can do that Photos can't (yet)\".\n", "Q: bulk delete apps in iDevice I have a habit to download the latest apps gone free, however This results in many unused apps.

I know how to tell what the frequency was when it was emitted. I want to know what it is \"now\" so that I can use the Doppler effect to tell if, and how quickly, my laptop is moving relative to my router.\n\nA: They are all at 2.4 GHz router and your laptop, subdivided by channels that are about 20 MHz apart.\nYou router is broadcasting all 11 channels. Your computer is receiving all of them, but only one is selected (by you) to be used.\nHere is a graphical representation of some different frequencies depending on the Protocol used. \nIf you want to find out which one you are using, hold the \"alt\" key and click on the WiFi Icon. The first line tells you the protocol like 802.11n.\n\nSo the frequency is fixed and it does not change by distance from Router to laptop.\nWhat does change is the Power. It is sent at 100% from the Router but depending on the distance it could be much less at your laptop. The power is the first and main indicator of how much data can be transmitted (regardless of Frequency).\n", "Q: How do I keep an ssh tunnel alive using launchd?

Since you don't have it set it defaults to 3.  Try setting it to something higher than 3 and see if it relives some of your issues.  In your case it would disconnect if the server is not responsive for 180 seconds.  \nFrom the ssh man page:\n ServerAliveCountMax:\n\n     Sets the number of server alive messages (see below) which may be\n     sent without ssh(1) receiving any messages back from the server.\n     If this threshold is reached while server alive messages are\n     being sent, ssh will disconnect from the server, terminating the\n     session.  It is important to note that the use of server alive\n     messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive (below).  The server\n     alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and there‐\n     fore will not be spoofable.  The TCP keepalive option enabled by\n     TCPKeepAlive is spoofable.  The server alive mechanism is valu‐\n     able when the client or server depend on knowing when a connec‐\n     tion has become inactive.\n\n     The default value is 3.  If, for example, ServerAliveInterval\n     (see below) is set to 15 and ServerAliveCountMax is left at the\n     default, if the server becomes unresponsive, ssh will disconnect\n     after approximately 45 seconds.  This option applies to protocol\n     version 2 only.\n\n", "Q: Unable to do a partial screen recording on OSX with quicktime I am using multi-screen: I am using the primary screen of my MBP plus two external monitors via displayport\nWhen I start the screen recording, it is the message I see on my screen\n\nI go on to select an area for recording\n\nIt is where I get stuck: there is simply no way I can start the recording after the selection.

That means a very broad list of items will be considered as Other, including things like the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Documents and file types, including PDF, doc, PSD, etc\n\n*Archives and disk images, including zips, dmg, iso, etc\n\n*Various types of personal and user data\n\n*Anything in the system folders of OS X, ranging from temporary files, swap, voices, etc\n\n*User library items like Application Support, iCloud files, screen savers, etc\n\n*User caches and system caches, including things like browser caches and locally stored message media files\n\n*Fonts, app accessories, application plugins, and app extensions\n\n*Various file and file types not recognized by Spotlight, for example a virtual machine hard drive, Windows Boot Camp partitions, etc\n\n\nAs you can see, this is not unnecessary junk or clutter. Basically, anything that is not one of the media types that the Storage tab specifies will be shown as “Other”.\nSource: OS X Daily: What the “Other” Storage Space is in Mac OS X & How to Clear It Up\n", "Q: Photo wrong thumbnail In the Finder of my mac, it often happens that some photos in a folder are displaying wrong previews. The set of photos which have this problem is random and unpredictable: sometimes among 10 photos in a row there is one with a wrong thumbnail. The wrong thumbnail is always another photo in the same folder. Rebooting the machine does not help, which means the wrong information is stored somewhere. When I duplicate the photos (as an experiment), the new copy is OK.\nI wonder if there is a way to force refreshing the thumbnails.\nMacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2014), OS X Yosemite (10.10.2)\nI have also asked this question on https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6988345 but received no answer yet.\n\nA: A couple of things you can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the folder in Finder - click on the Actions button- select Show View Options - put a check next to Show icon preview. If it's checked, uncheck it, close the window, open it back up and check it again\n\n*Head for your home folder - Library / Preferences - move the com.apple.finder.plist file to the desktop - log out and back in. If this fixes it, you can delete the file. This is going to reset all your Finder preferences to default.\n\n*the thumbnails are stored in a folder called com.apple.QuickLook.thumbnailcache in a subfolder of /var/folders. The quickest way to locate it should be to run sudo find . -name com.apple.Q*. You could move that folder to a different location and restart the Finder process (killall Finder) to force a recreation of the thumbnails.\n\n", "Q: How to make inactive when I close application window by Command + W When I open an Excel file from Finder and close the Excel window by Command+W. The active window remain Excel.\nIs there a way to make Finder active window when I close Excel?\nIf I close the Excel window by Command+Q, the Finder become active but I prefer to keep Excel in memory.\n\nA: I'm not sure you can really have both…\nTelling Excel to close a window doesn't tell Excel to quit. It doesn't actually tell it anything other than you closed a window. It sits there waiting for you to tell it what to do next; it can't guess what your next action is going to be.\nOf course, if you Quit it, then it goes away & the last-used app will be frontmost.\nClicking the desktop is the quickest way to bring the Finder to the front.\n\nA: You can do this with Keyboard Maestro.\nCreate a macro group just for Excel, then create a macro that executes upon ⌘W which closes the window and switches focus to Finder.\n                 \n\nA: Update 1\nBased on the comments made by ironsand to grgarside's answer. Step 6 should be changed to:\ntell application \"System Events\" to set activeApp to name of application processes whose frontmost is true\nif length of activeApp is not 0 then\n    tell application (first item of activeApp) to activate\nend if\n\n\nMy Answer to Posted Question\nThis can be done by creating a Service using the Automator application. However, you will not be able to use the the COMMAND+W key. I would suggest using the CONTROL+W key since Excel has not yet assigned this key to any function.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Automator Application and click on New Document.\n\n*Select Service and click Choose.\n\n*Select File->Save from Menus and save service as \"Close and Activate Finder\". You should see the following window. (Hint: \"Open Image in a New Window\" for a better view.)\n\n\n\n\n\n*Drag \"Close Excel Workbooks\" to \"Drag actions or files here to build your workflow\" window. In the pop up window, click on \"Don't Add\".\n\n*Drag \"Run AppleScript\" to \"Drag actions or files here to build your workflow\" window.\n\n*Add the text line activate application \"Finder\" after the text line (* Your script goes here *).\n\n\nThe window should now appear as shown below.\n\n\n\n*Under \"Service receives selected\" choose \"no input\".\n\n*Change \"any application\" to \"Other...\". In the pop-up window, choose \"Microsoft Excel\". The window should now appear as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Select File->Save from Menus.\n\n*Select Automator->Services->Services Preferences... from the Menus. Find \"Close and Activate Finder\" at the bottom of the available services.\n\n*Click twice on the word \"none\" to the right of \"Close and Active Finder\". Enter the CONTROL-W key. The window should now appear as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Quit System Preferences and Automator applications.\n\n*Test using the Finder and Excel applications.\n\nA: What is the point of having Excel running without a document open? So that it opens the next document faster? If so, then make sure you have lots of memory (RAM) and then quit using CMD-Q instead of closing the window using CMD-W. \nWhen you have lots of RAM, modern operating systems cache or preserve most or all of the application in memory for when you need it next. This make starting the application next time super quick.\nYou can see this when you startup your computer. Any large application you start takes a while to come up. If you close it and then re-open it, it is very quick. This is because most of it was still in memory, kept close at hand, so to speak.\nBut, should you load an application that needs lots of memory, the system may remove Excel from its cache and the next time Excel needs to startup it will be slower…\n\nA: ⌘+W, ⌘+H is closing the active window and then switching to the previously active application with most decent applications.\nMost of the time this will be much more efficient than a switch to the Finder because we tend to go back to what was just interrupted before.\n", "Q: Different Volume Level for Headsets and Headphones over Combo Jack I have the Sony MDRX10. When I use the cable with the mic, I get lower volume level and distortions at max volume but when I use the headphone only cable, I get much better volume control.\nI tried using both cables with my smartphone, and they both produce the same volume. Also, I tested with a portable amplifier connected to my Macbook and then the cable with mic; this gave the same output as the one without the mic.  This makes me think the problem is associated with Mac OS X.\nMachine specs: Macbook Pro 13\" Mid 2012, Yosemite 10.10.4\n\n\nA: Your headphones come with two different cables:\n\n\n*\n\n*one without a microphone\n\n*one with a microphone\n\n\nThe sound quality differs when you use one of these cables, the rest of your setup stays the same. So it is high likely that one of your cables is of low quality or just broken.\n", "Q: How to solve audio sync issue on the Mac? (and it is not just by a constant out of sync amount) I downloaded a clip from 56.com or youku.com, and then found that the video and audio is out of sync.  At first, near 6:00, the video is about 0.7 second slower, and I used iMovie to \"detach audio\" and then drag the audio to play 0.7 second later and saved the video.  However, I found later that at around 50:00, the video was about 4 to 5 seconds slower.  So the video is constantly slower, not by a fixed amount. (I suspect that it is some 23.97 or 24 frame per second issue, but 4 seconds out of 50:00, and that is 0.13% off... (and 23.97 vs 24 is also 0.125%, so they seem quite close).\nIs there a way using HandBrake, iMovie, Final Cut Pro, or any other tool to fix it?  I only saw that in iMovie, I can set the video to play at 101% speed, but then it will be too fast.\n\nA: I made a workaround which works for short clips: at around 5:00 i split audio and resync second part (drag it backwards by around 0.4s so that is overlaps a little with 1st part). If clip is longer than 10 min I repeat operation at around 10:00; split audio again and resync 3rd part, and so on. \nYou can do it also for longer clips but it gets more and more tedious\n", "Q: Streaks in PDF when using preview When opening a PDF in preview there often are streaks like this:\n\nDoes anybody have an idea where this is coming from?\n\nA: There's a bug somewhere (maybe a PostScript bug related to Preview) in the Mac workflow when you Save as PDF. There is a rare occurrence where a line like that will occur, and the workaround is to repeat the Save as PDF command. The bug is rare, so you probably won't get a repeat the second time.\nI've encountered the bug a handful of times because I frequently use Preview to compile screenshots (from online seminars) into a single PDF for later review. Here is the workflow I'm using when I encounter the bug:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select all your screenshots, right-click, open with Preview.\n\n*Review the screenshots; right-click and delete any you don't want.\n\n*On the left, use [Cmd+a] to select all the screenshots.\n\n*Use [Cmd+p] to open the Print dialog, but at the bottom-left, choose Save as PDF.\nAfter step (4), I find it necessary to quickly skim through the resulting PDF, just to confirm that a random line hasn't occurred. If it has, then I repeat step (4) and check again.\nIf my descriptions above are not helpful to you, then another thing to check is the software that was used to generate the PDF. For example, if you open a PDF in Acrobat (I'm not certain about Adobe Reader), then use [Cmd+d] to open the Document Properties dialog, and the Description tab will list the software used to produce that PDF. Knowing this, you can potentially identify the source of issues.\n", "Q: Is there a Java IDE for iPad which can compile and run Java locally? I'm about to have a coding session with some buddies. Problem is, one doesn't have a laptop. He's pretty new to programming so I was going to set him up something either on a rickety laptop or my iPad with a bluetooth keyboard / mouse.\nIs there any app that would give me these capabilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*Java IDE\n\n*compile java locally\n\n*run java locally\n\n\nA: There are web-based IDEs that support Java like IDE One and CodeBox that should work from an iPad. Obviously there are limitations with both but they might suffice.\nThis is my immediate thought, because I believe Apple have rules against people creating apps that include their own runtime. Which I'd assume you'd require if you wanted to compile Java code directly on an iOS device.\n\nA: use PICO COMPILER APP on AppStore, works well, but you cant use SWING components as far as i am aware\n\nA: You can use iDos and if you are running iOS 8.4 or less you can easily use iFunbox and add dos Java compiler in the iDos app on your phone and use it. Note app sandbox is only available until iOS 8.4. If you are using 8.4 or above you have to go for online compilers, only there is no option available there.\n", "Q: Missing photos on my iPhone I have a Macbook Pro and an iPhone that share the same iCloud account. On my Macbook's Photos I have a smart album that contains 52 photos. On the iPhone the album contains 40, with 12 photos are missing. \nHow can I resync the missing 12 photos with the iPhone?\n\nA: Smart Albums are not fully supported yet. See https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204478\nI would suggest trying to create a new smart album, perhaps with slightly different parameters, and see if you can work around the bug. Or, worst case, you could create a regular album.\n", "Q: Unable to send email from Mac Mail App to one specific email address (all emails to all other emails addresses are sent) We have been trying to send emails to a specific gmail address that certainly does exist for many months now but we are unable to and receive this message: 'Cannot send message using the server x...x@x...x.com' - a message we usually get when our internet connection is off. We are still able to send emails using any of the servers to all other email addresses except this one. How could we fix this issue? \nThank you!\n\nA: I found a easy way to result this trouble. that's will work for gmail account.\n1-First you have to delete the account follow system preferences -> internet account-> select your gmail account in the left bar and delete it.\n2-Open your mail app go to preferences and tap the + sign for add a account. Select gmail and login into the new windows that show up.\n3- select the google account to the left bar of mail app and synchronize \"google\" by making a right click. that's it you will able to receive and send mail.\n", "Q: OSX 10.9 Sending files to a windows network drive I have a mapped network drive on a windows tower. I can connect to it, I can read from it. I can't send files to it, though.\nWhen I try and drag them from the finder window into the network drive window, nothing happens. Why is that?\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*All users who access the drive have full read write permissions  \n\n*I even logged in as the tower's administrator  \n\n*I have SMB enabled in sharing   \n\n\nDo I need to list the folder im trying to drag to the network drive?\n\nA: It is likely the flawed SMB2 implementation in Mavericks. Try connecting to the share using cifs://server/share instead of smb:// and this will force the connection to use SMB1 which should be more compatible. \n", "Q: Creating a new desktop on one monitor creates a desktop on all monitors Additionally shifting my desktop on the one monitor I created (with 2 monitors plugged into my MacBook Pro) shifts every desktop. I don't want this feature how do I turn it off?\nI just want to be able to create one desktop on one monitor and keep all the rest of my monitors desktops the same.\n\nA: Try System Prefs > Mission Control > Displays have separate spaces.\n\n", "Q: I want to backup my Mac partition, including the OS, so that I can use the backup to restore my hard drive to its current state I want to dual-boot Ubuntu (14.04) of my Mac running OS X 10.10.3. I want to make sure that I can use my backup to fix any issues I might have dual-booting. I have a bootable USB with Ubuntu on it, and a partition on my internal hard drive to install it on, but I want to back up that Mac partition, including the OS, so that I can use that to get everything back to how it is now, no matter what error happens during dual-booting.\nWhat is the best way to do that?\n\nA: Simply connect external hdd with enough storage and use Time Machine application (which is included in OS X)\nHere's tutorial from Apple\n\nA: I would highly recommend a small program called SuperDuper, which I use all the time. The problem with TimeMachine, is that it does incremental backups and eats alot of disk space. And you can't boot into your TimeMachine backups. So if something goes wrong with your dual boot system, TimeMachine is useless, because you need a system to boot into. They are for restoring a system to a previous state. SuperDuper will back up a partition perfectly and make it bootable, so you can use it as an alternate system if something goes wrong. Also you can do update backups and sandbox and use it to restore a partition.\n\nA: Carbon Copy Cloner, Super Duper, Disk Utility, and Phoenix. Disk Utility can do binary clones of one disk to another provided the target is as big or bigger than the source. Carbon Copy Cloner and Super Duper are fully featured cloning tools. Phoenix is really an auxiliary tool for the Scannerz package but it can be bought by itself and it can do basic cloning (it's really for creating emergency boot drives). There are also command line applications like asr and ditto that can also do this sort of thing, but as you might guess there a little more difficult to use.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Close window without closing application How to close a window without the application quitting? does not address my question, strangely.  I don't want to hide the application windows like Cmd+h does, and Option+click didn't actually do anything for me, and isn't what I want anyway.\nI work with a lot of different application windows, especially with the browser and the terminal (I'm a software engineer and run my coding editor, debuggers, servers, etc. from the terminal and am constantly switching between term windows and tmux sessions to develop/troubleshoot our solutions).  Sometimes (actually, most of the time), when I finish with a session, I want to close the window without closing the application.  I make heavy use of keyboard shortcuts, so it interrupts my flow to have to grab for the mouse and point->click the corner to close the window.\nIs there a way to get a shortcut to close windows in OS X without closing the entire application?  This is really interrupting my flow and productivity.\nI'm using Mavricks, btw.  I've also tried iTerm2 and the default Mac Terminal but couldn't find anything that lets me do this in either of those applications.  Chrome also doesn't seem to support closing just a Window.  Either terminal is fine, I have things configured to the point where tmux eliminates my need for a fancy terminal, because Tmux can do it anyway, plus some.\n\nA: Have you thought for a keyboard combination like cmd+w?\nIn Google Chrome you can close all tabs with cmd+shift+w, in Safari the same way.\nAlternatively you can write an AppleScript like tell application \"Terminal\" to close front window or as terminal command: osascript -e 'tell app \"Terminal\" to close front window'.\n\nA: This could also help you for the same.\ncmd + option + w\n", "Q: Syncing my iPhone 4 deleted all my music I have an iPhone 4 and just just downloaded iTunes on my computer.\nI wanted to save all my music to my iTunes so i could later transfer it but i synced it and all my music was deleted.

You can't recover music from iPhone...\n\nA: iTunes is the Master, the phone is the Slave.\nMusic only transfers one way, from iTunes to the phone [aside from iTunes Match or music purchased from iTunes Store].\nI'm afraid, unless you had a backup somewhere, the music's gone.\nRe: your edit. That's your backup, then. You need to see if you can get the data off the old drive.\n", "Q: How do I check I know the password for an encrypted drive? I've got an encrypted USB drive and I want to check I know the password. At the moment everything is in my keychain, so it works, and I can see its contents, but I want to make sure I'm covered if I need to replace my computer. \nI want to make sure I can keep the contents if it turns out I've forgotten the password, so I don't want to delete any data from the keychain. (If I've forgotten the password, I'll need to copy its contents off before reformatting it.)\nHow do I do this?\n\nA: You might be interested in exporting all of the KeyChain in to Text file that you can save for later uses. \nBe aware anyone with access to your computer can now plainly see that information.\nRun this in Terminal\nsudo security dump-keychain -d login.keychain > keychain.txt\n\nYou will have to click \"Allow\" till done, or use script that does that, but since it is usually one time action just do it manually.\n"]
