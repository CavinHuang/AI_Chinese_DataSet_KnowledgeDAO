["Q: Force resolution and make it stay on Ubuntu 15.10 I use Ubuntu 15.10 on my dell Ultrasmall optiplex 760 with a 19\" dell display.\nMy display supports a resolution of 1280x1024. But when I start ubuntu the resolution is 1024x768.\nAfter long time googling i have found a solution to be able to force my resolution to 1280x1024 by using these commands in terminal:\nsudo cvt 1280 1024 60\nsudo xrandr --newmode \"1280x1024_60.00\"  109.00  1280 1368 1496 1712  1024 1027 1034 1063 -hsync +vsync\nsudo xrandr --addmode VGA1 1280x1024_60.00\n\nBut when I restart Ubuntu I have to put these commands in the terminal again because the resolution doesn't stay at bootup.\nI've found a lot of topics about this to make the resolution stay but none have worked for me because of missing files which I had to edit in order to make it stay at bootup.\nAny help would be appreciated as I have been looking to solve this issue for almost a day.\nKeep in mind I am a real noob, and therefore every step to take for a solution should be explained to me step by step.\nThanks.\n\nA: You need to add the xrandr configurations to a startup file, so that you'll get your desired resolution upon reboot/startup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a bash script, xrandr.sh for example, and place your xrandr commands into it: \n\n\n#!/bin/bash\nsudo xrandr --newmode \"1280x1024_60.00\"  109.00  1280 1368 1496 1712  1024 1027 1034 1063 -hsync +vsync\nsudo xrandr --addmode VGA1 1280x1024_60.00\n\n\n*\n\n*Make the script executable with chmod +x xrandr.sh\n\n*Search for \"Startup Applications\" in the dash, run it, and add the script as a startup application.\nThe commands will now run every time you log into your account.  \nNOTE: You don't use sudo when executing xrandr commands.\n", "Q: Steam Install problems 14.04 LTS I've got a new pc yesterday, installed 14.04lts and had some problems with my graphics card driver (now fixed I believe).

I have seen other people on the Internet also having this problem but the solutions have been non-conclusive, so I wanted to bring it to attention again.\nAccording to this page in Ubuntu wiki:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables\nthe recommended way to set session-wide environment variables is to modify ~/.pam_environment.\nHere is what my goal is:\n\n\n*\n\n*I want to create an environment variable ANDROID_HOME that would have a path to a certain location in my home folder as a value.\n\n*I want to add two folders to the PATH.\n\n\nHere is what I did. The ~/.pam_environment file was non-existent, so I created it and added the following lines to it:\nANDROID_HOME=${HOME}/Android/Sdk\nPATH DEFAULT=${PATH}:${ANDROID_HOME}/tools:${ANDROID_HOME}/platform-tools\n\nLogged out and logged back in.\nThe result is not expected. I opened terminal and echoed $ANDROID_HOME and that's what I got:\n${HOME}/Android/Sdk\n\nLooks like the ${HOME} is not replaced with my home folder path. Why is that so?\nObserve cd-ing to $ANDROID_HOME (the Android/Sdk actually exists in my home folder):\nanvar@crazymachine:~$ cd $ANDROID_HOME\nbash: cd: ${HOME}/Android/Sdk: No such file or directory\n\nAlso echoing $PATH gave me this:\n/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:${HOME}/Android/Sdk/tools:${HOME}/Android/Sdk/platform-tools\n\nWhy are the variables not substituted with their values like would be logical to assume, especially when the example in the aformentioned site gave such an impression that variables can be used inside the values?\nWhat is the right way to set session-wide environment variables that also GUI programs have access to?\n\nA: The example in the wiki, for setting session variables via ~/.pam_environment, states in a note:\nThe syntax used for modifying PATH, which syntax differs from script files, is required for variable expansion to work.\nHence your first row should look like:\nANDROID_HOME DEFAULT=${HOME}/Android/Sdk\n\n\nA: Two suggestions:\n1st - the form of your environmental statements should be:\nANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk\nPATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools\n\nsecond, place your new environment statements in ~/.profile\n\nA: I think you may need an export HOME after setting up the path variable (in ~/.bashrc we do)\n", "Q: Wine on ubuntu 14.04, i'm a noob?

You'll notice you can actually install the same version of a snap multiple times if you're sideloading it, as the hash changes.

I mean is that gonna require some kind of loop? If that is the case please do an example of how to do that?\n\nA: passwd does not read passwords non-interactively e.g. via STDIN generated by pipe, as an alternative you can use chpasswd which reads password via STDIN but has a security issue.\nThe problem is chpasswd expects passwords to be given in clear text, following the format:\nusername:password\n\nTo make us somewhat less explicit we can save the passwords sequentially in separate lines in a file corresponding to the output given by the awk -F: '$3 >= 1000 && $1 != \"nobody\" {print $1}' /etc/passwd command. Remember you need to maintain the sequence of the output of the command while saving passwords in the file.\nThen we can use paste to generate the format chpasswd wants on its STDIN. \nFor example:\npaste -d: <(awk -F: '$3 >= 1000 && $1 != \"nobody\" {print $1}' /etc/passwd)\\\n          /password/file | sudo chpasswd\n\nHere /password/file contains the relevant passwords.\nAs a safety measure, we can remove the /password/file file afterwards. \n\nA: It's possible with usermod -p PASSWD USERNAME and while loop. Problem is that PASSWD cannot be in plain text, it has to be encrypted password. For that purpose you can use mkpasswd. That way \"newPassString\" is encrypted , and remains the same for all users.   Here's example of what can be done in just one line of code.\n$ cat userlist |  while read USERNAME; do echo \"$USERNAME\";sudo usermod -p \"$(mkpasswd \"newPassString\")\" \"$USERNAME\"  ;done\ntester\n[sudo] password for xieerqi: \ntestuser\n[sudo] password for xieerqi: \n\nNotice that i have to enter sudo for each sudo call - that's my personal setting. In regular, unaltered /etc/sudoers file, the timeout is 15 minutes by default, so you'd need to enter it only once.\nA better approach is to put the code into a script, and call with parameters  $1 as filename and $2 as new password string   :\n xieerqi:$ cat passScript.sh                                                                                        \n#!/bin/bash\nwhile read USERNAME; do\n   echo \"$USERNAME\";\n   usermod -p \"$(mkpasswd \"$2\")\" \"$USERNAME\"  \ndone < \"$1\"\n\nxieerqi:$ chmod +x passScript.sh                                                                                   \n\nxieerqi:$ sudo ./passScript.sh  userlist myNewPass                                                                 \n[sudo] password for xieerqi: \ntester\ntestuser\n\nxieerqi:$ su testuser\nPassword: \ntestuser@eagle:/home/xieerqi$ \n\n", "Q: Can i keep progress on a bootable usb To be more specific, i have a 16 GB USB with Ubuntu on it, and i use it to boot from it, but i want to save all my installations etc. so when i restart the computer or reboot again i wont have to restart my installations again.\nI also used terminal do install these programs, so will it be possible to sort of change the place where it is installed that way it will be on my C drive and ill only have to boot Ubuntu to run them.\nso in short I want to use the USB as another hard drive for the laptop.\nthanks,  \n\nA: Yes you can.

I often use Terminal to write code in vim, and as my Terminal is see-through I am able to see what it behind it, so if I have a manual behind it in a browser window or something like that, then I can refer to it without needing to switch to it or having to have it next to my Terminal window which I prefer not to do as both windows get rather small then.\nBut there is one downside, I often need to copy and paste text, move down the page behind Terminal, search for things on it, etc. \nAnd to do this, I then have to switch to it which I don't like doing, so what would be better would be if there was a way of making it so that in gnome-terminal, when I press a certain keyboard shortcut, for it to make my cursor go through the current window (which is see-through and should remain ontop) so that I may be able to interactive with the window behind (for instance to copy and paste text, to move down the page, and to search for things on the page) gnome-terminal without actually moving to it or putting it infront of the gnome-terminal window.\nOf course pressing they keyboard shortcut again - or maybe a different one if this can't be done with the same shortcut - should return things back to normal and how they were before I first pressed the shortcut which made me interact with the window behind.\nI would also like for my keyboard to interact with the window behind and not just my cursor. And I would also like for this to only  be the case for the gnome-terminal application as I don't want this to happen with any other applications.\nCan this be done?\nI am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18.\n\nA: Not literally what you asked for, but if you have a key combination that would automatically recognize both the gnome-terminal -window and the window directly below it, you could switch (toggle) between the two quickly without further effort.\nThe setup does exactly that: If (and only if) either the active window or the window directly below it is a gnome-terminal window, the script makes them switch places, as shown in the images. I left a few irrelevant windows to illustrate they don't take part in the toggle:\n\n\n*\n\n*Having a gnome-terminal window on top of a gedit window:\n\n\n*Pressing the shortcut:\n\n\n*Press it again:\n\nAnd so on. As mentioned, this will only happen if either one of the topmost windows belongs to gnome-terminal.\nHow to set up\n\n\n*\n\n*The script(s) need wmctrl\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\n\n*Save both scripts below in one and the same directory, since one of the scripts imports functions from the other:\nScript 1\nto be saved as (exactly) z_list.py:\nThis is actually a background script, keeping track of the z-order of windows. The z-order cannot be determined by the \"normal\" tools like wmctrl or xdotool. Running a simple script to keep track of the currently active window, will give us the z-order however.\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport os\n\nrootdata = os.environ[\"HOME\"]+\"/.focus_history\"\n\ndef current_windows():\n    try:\n        return subprocess.check_output([\"wmctrl\", \"-lp\"]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n        pass\n\ndef convert_format(w_id):\n    return w_id[:2]+(10-len(w_id))*\"0\"+w_id[2:]\n\ndef read_data():\n    return open(rootdata).read().splitlines()\n\ndef get_top(wlist):\n    try:\n        top = convert_format([l.split(\"#\")[-1].strip() for l in \\\n           subprocess.check_output([\"xprop\", \"-root\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").splitlines() \\\n               if \"_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW(WINDOW)\" in l][0])       \n        return [l for l in wlist if top in l][0]\n    except IndexError:\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    open(rootdata, \"wt\").write(\"This is an empty line\")\n    while True:\n        time.sleep(0.5)\n        wdata = current_windows()\n        if wdata != None:\n            wlist = wdata.splitlines()\n            # get frontmost window (as in wmctrl -lG)\n            top = get_top(wlist)\n            oldlist = read_data()\n            if not any([top == oldlist[0], top == None]):\n                # clean up closed windows\n                [oldlist.remove(l) for l in oldlist if not l.split()[0] in wdata]\n                # remove possible other mentions of the active window\n                [oldlist.remove(l) for l in oldlist if l.startswith(top.split()[0])]\n                open(rootdata, \"wt\").write((\"\\n\").join([top]+oldlist))\n\nScript 2\nto be saved as toggle_terminal.py:\nAs mentioned, save this script in one and the same directory, together  with z_list.py.\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport z_list\n\ntry:\n    termpid = subprocess.check_output([\"pidof\", \"gnome-terminal\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n    wlist = z_list.read_data(); top = wlist[0]; second = wlist[1]\n    if any([termpid in top, termpid in second]):\n        subprocess.Popen([\"wmctrl\", \"-ia\", second.split()[0]])\nexcept subprocess.calledProcessError:\n    pass\n\nHow to use\nSince the background script keeps track of active windows and creates the z-order that way, it needs to run before you open (at least) the windows you'd like to toggle, preferably as a Startup Application. \nTo test:\nOpen a terminal window, run the background script by the command:\npython3 /path/to/z_list.py\n\nOpen a new terminal window and (e.g.) a gedit window. Focus the gedit window and open a new terminal window on top of it. Then run in the terminal window the command:\npython3 /path/to/toggle_terminal.py\n\nThe windows should change places (order). Unfortunately you won't be able to run the command again (in the terminal) to bring the terminal window to top again, since the gedit window is now active :). You may assume however it will work from a shortcut key.\nIf all works fine, make the setup permanent:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add z_list.py to Startup Applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add the command:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 15 && python3 /path/to/z_list.py\"\n\n\n*Add script 2 to a shortcut key combination: choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the command:\npython3 /path/to/toggle_terminal.py\n\n", "Q: libpng16.so.16 not found - how to get it? I have recently attempted to install mupen64plus on my Lubuntu machine.

I've read that Ubuntu (ie 15.10) takes its code from Debian unstable. So where does the code for Ubuntu LTS come from? Is it also from unstable or more from the testing branch?\nI'd like to move from Debian to Ubuntu server with LTS so I don't have to do yearly upgrades and instead hold off for 2-3 years. I know Debian 8 now offers LTS, but a few of the packages can be a bit behind.\n\nA: It's true technically that Ubuntu LTS is based on a snapshot of Debian Testing whereas other Ubuntu releases are based on Debian Unstable.\nHowever, this is a simplistic way of looking at it.  It mustn't be forgotten that Debian Stable, too, comes originally from Debian Unstable, and Debian Stable is a very polished final product - so the fact that something spent time in Debian Unstable earlier in its life cycle is not an indication of its quality in the final release.  After Ubuntu branches off the packages it imports from Debian, Ubuntu and Debian then independently continue the process of fixing and tracking bugs and getting packages ready for release, following their own separate processes and timelines.\nIn the case of Ubuntu LTS, it branches off from Debian at a later stage in Debian's process: once Debian's branched it off into Debian Testing - implying Ubuntu will benefit from more of Debian's own testing and bug fixing prior to the point at which Ubuntu's process starts.  The primary way in which Ubuntu will benefit is reduced effort getting the packages ready for release.  Ubuntu has different release goals and requirements to Debian which indicates that an Ubuntu LTS won't necessarily be equivalent to a Debian Stable.\nAnother thing to consider is the distinction Ubuntu makes between packages it supports officially (eg main/restricted) and packages it provides only \"community support\" for (eg universe/multiverse).  The packages in the latter will be modified relatively little after the import from Debian.\nAnd lastly, there are quite a few packages in Ubuntu that are not sourced from Debian at all, for commercial or licensing reasons or because they are Ubuntu specific.\n\nA: First off the idea that each Ubuntu release is built on a snapshot of Debian is fundamentally incorrect. Ubuntu releases are based first and foremost on the previous Ubuntu release.\nDuring each Ubuntu release cycle there is a period where packages that were not modified by Ubuntu and where the version in Debian is newer than the version In Ubuntu are automatically imported from Debian.\nNowadays for both regular and lts releases Packages are imported from Debian unstable into the \"proposed pocket\" for the new Ubuntu release. After building successfully and passing some other consistency checks those packages then migrate to the \"release pocket\".\nSome (possiblly all, I'm not 100% sure) older LTS releases made before the \"proposed pocket\" was introduced did import from testing instead to reduce the chance of importing brokenness.\n\nA: LTS takes it code from Debian Testing. If you are running a server I would stick with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS until 16.04 LTS comes out. I probably won't switch to 16.04 LTS when it first comes out on my server.\n\nI switched to ubuntu because of issues finding the latest packages with debian.

You can set up a tunnel for the X protocol FROM the X client on the server TO the X  server on your remote management system  (man ssh), and tell the  X  server on your remote management system to accept remote connections. man xhost\n", "Q: Weird dependencies for gnome-tetris I tried to install games-tetris because that's the only one returned by aptitude search tetris:\n# aptitude install games-tetris\nThe following NEW packages will be installed:\n  angrydd bastet blockout2 crack-attack cuyo cuyo-data{a} flobopuyo \n  fonts-sil-gentium{a} fonts-sil-gentium-basic{a} freealchemist \n  freeglut3{a} frozen-bubble frozen-bubble-data{a} games-tasks games-tetris \n  gemdropx ghextris gtetrinet libadns1{a} libalien-sdl-perl{a} \n  liballegro4.4{a} libboost-program-options1.58.0{a} \n  libcapture-tiny-perl{a} libclass-inspector-perl{a} \n  libcompress-bzip2-perl{a} libfile-sharedir-perl{a} libgconf2-4{a} \n  libidl0{a} liborbit2{a} libportmidi0{a} libsdl-gfx1.2-5{a} \n  libsdl-pango1{a} libsdl-perl{a} libsdl-ttf2.0-0{a} libsmpeg0{a} \n  libtie-simple-perl{a} ltris netris petris python-gconf{a} \n  python-glade2{a} python-gnome2{a} python-numpy{a} python-pygame{a} \n  python-pyorbit{a} stax tasksel tasksel-data{a} tetrinet-client tetrinetx \n  tint xbubble xbubble-data{a} xwelltris \n0 packages upgraded, 54 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.\nNeed to get 51.5 MB of archives.

If not set, the user's home directory is used.\npam-systemd is the component that sets XDG_RUNTIME_DIR to /run/user/$UID, where $UID is the effective user id for the user. In your case, pam-systemd has not run or has otherwise misbehaved, that is hard to tell. But you can easily set the XDG_RUNTIME_DIR at boot time yourself, as follows: sudo nano /etc/profile and add the following lines:\nXDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$UID\nexport XDG_RUNTIME_DIR\n\nFrom the next reboot on, the .PID files will no longer clutter your home directory.\n", "Q: How can I uninstall python3.5.0 installed from source code?

The syntax is:\nssh user@destination 'command_1; command_2 .....'\n\nreplace ; with && to run a command depending on the success of the preceding one.\nSo, you can do:\nssh debian@192.168.7.2 'mkdir -p folder1/ folder2/folder3'\n\nNote that the directories will be created under the home directory of user debian. \nThe non-interactive session will be terminated once the mkdir command returns.\n", "Q: Mounting unknown filesystem from LG TV I'm a new linux ubuntu user. I have a LG smart TV, Toshiba External harddisk and already recorded few TV shows inside that Toshiba External hd. \nI want to mount that hard disk to ubuntu linux.

From the screenshoot you can see that it is unknown in the filesystem.\nOutput of my 'fdisk -l'\n\nA: Usually mount can autodetect the filesystem.  Have you tried mounting it with mount?\nmkdir /mnt/sdb1\nmount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/sdb1\n\nThere's a chance it's an unsupported filesystem, but most pre-formatted drives out there are some version of FAT, which is very well supported in linux.\n\nA: I know I'm very late to the party. Running\njfs_fsck /dev/sdb1\nmount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/sdb1\n\nfixed the problem for me. Apparently, the filesystem might be flagged as corrupted sometimes which is why mounting fails.\nHowever, as the OP pointed out, the recordings are encrypted.

Is there anyway to write a C++ backend for an Ubuntu Touch application that can access the internet, and download files?\nOr do I have to do that through QML, and pass it to objects written in C++?\n\nA: Yes, it's possible to access the Internet on the C++ side by using something standard like sockets or libcurl that is installed by default.\nOh, I've forgotten the obvious one: the Qt library has networking classes.\nLook at network examples that come with Qt: http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/examples-network.html\n\"HTTP Example\" is about downloading a file using QNetworkRequest.\nCMake and Qt5\nThe most recent CMake syntax for enabling Qt5 modules is:\nfind_package(Qt5Network REQUIRED)\n\n...\n\ntarget_link_libraries(my-binary Qt5::Network)\n\nThe name of the binary is the name of the file into which your cpp files will be compiled: an executable (in the case of a C++ project) or a library (in the case of QML project with C++ plugin).\nThe binaries are defined in CMake with command add_executable or add_library.

I am running Ubuntu 16.04 LTE (x64) on a VMWare Workstation 12.0.1 which is on a Windows 7 Enterprise x64 machine with AMD Radeon HD 5670 graphics card. \nEvery time I run Ubuntu, it runs in a smaller resolution 800x600; my native resolution is 1920x1080. So I searched around and found article's instructing to create a custom bash script which should've forced the system resolution to 1920x1080.\nFollowing the tutorial i created a \"setscreen.sh\" file with the following commands ->\nxrandr --newmode \"1920x1080\" 173.00 1920 2048 2248 2576 1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode Virtual1 1920x1080\nxrandr --output Virtual1 --mode 1920x1080\n\nBut after every restart the resolution goes back to 800x600. Then i have to run the custom \"setscreen.sh\" command again from the terminal to bring it back to 1920x1080.  \nI did more research and found another article which suggested to put the file in \"startup application\" after enabling the \"execute\" permission of the 'custom display' file to \"Allow executing file as program\". \nI did as instructed (marking the file executable and making a new entry in the Startup Application) and now after every restart the resolution would come to 1920x1080, but with a error message (Could not apply the stored configuration for monitors). When I close the error message the resolution goes back to 800x600. Then i have to run the \"setscreen.sh\" command again from the terminal to bring the resolution back to 1920x1080. (no error msg when run manually from the terminal). \nSince this was turning out to be yet another inconvenience, I followed this and this article to create a \".desktop\" file but it still does not fix anything and the issue persists. \nNow thinking that maybe i can't get this issue fixed i started looking at other ways to change the resolution and thought of manually running the \"setscreen.sh\" file from the desktop (GUI) by double clicking on it.

Also right clicking the file and selecting \"open with\"option and then \"other application\" and then \"View all application\" shows a bunch of application but not \"Terminal\". Here I did try to open it with the \"sun software\" option but that also does not fix the problem.\nI did further research to fix the problem by doing a search for every possible solution on askubuntu site but nothing i do seems to fix the problem. \nAlso I am sorry for not being able to keep this question short and concise  fearing lack of proper understanding of my issue and leading to potential delay. \nHope i have explained enough for someone to either help me resolve this issue or point me towards a resolution.\nThanks.\n\nA: After 13 months of struggle I have finally fixed my issue.\nFirst make sure that you are running the \"VMware Tools\" properly on your VM, and I did that by follow the instructions here!. \nThen I fire up the Terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) and enter the following commands\n(Note -> References to these 5 display command xrandr are a plenty here on this site, but without resolution to my problem.

For me it was Virtual1\nThen type the following command  cvt followed by your desired resolution. Please give attention to spaces in the following command. For me it was\ncvt 1920 1080\n\nThis generated the a output from which we need to copy (Ctrl+Shift+C) text after the word \"Modeline\" till the end and paste it (Ctrl+Shift+V) into the below code. Make sure to delete the _60.00 from between the quotes, before you run the code. For me  it was like this\nxrandr --newmode \"1920x1080\" 173.00 1920 2048 2248 2576 1080 1083 1088\n1120 -hsync +vsync\n\nObserve I have removed the _60.00 from the original \"1920x1080_60.00\". Next take the screen resolution from between the  quotes and enter into the following code\nxrandr --addmode Virtual1 1920x1080\n\nAfter this add the following command\nxrandr --output Virtual1 --mode 1920x1080\n\nThis should bring your screen resolution in Ubuntu to the desired one (1920x1080)\nAt this point if you restart then the new resolution will not be saved. So I went back to the System Setting -> Display. I now see that the desired resolution 1920x1080(16:9), (which was previously unavailable) has now become available in the Resolution drop down.\nNow when I select the resolution here and click on Apply, it retains the changes, even after restart.\nSo this way you don't have to make and custom resolution file and put it in startup items. i would like to say thanks to @DevRobot for this suggestions and efforts (he was the only one to do so). \n\nA: Raring Nautilus is the file manager used in Ubuntu. The instructions in this answer are only applicable if you're running Gnome, which you obviously aren't.\nThe way to make the bash script executable is by right clicking the script -> Properties -> Permissions -> set file as executable (or something very similar).\nOtherwise you can use the terminal: chmod +x yourscript.sh.\nIn case you did something wrong in setting up the .sh script to run on startup, I'll give you the instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a bash script, xrandr.sh for example, and place your xrandr commands into it: \n\n\n#!/bin/bash\nxrandr --newmode \"1920x1080\" 173.00 1920 2048 2248 2576 1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode Virtual1 1920x1080\nxrandr --output Virtual1 --mode 1920x1080\n\n\n*\n\n*Make the script executable with chmod +x xrandr.sh\n\n*Search for \"Startup Applications\" in the dash, run it, and add the script as a startup application.\nThe commands will now run every time you log into your account.\nIf you run into further problems, don't hesitate to contact me in the comments =) \n\nA: My solution for this problem was slighty different than the answer from DevRobot. Here's my approach.\nSo setting the custom resolution is done as mentioned by saj.\nxrandr --newmode \"1920x1080\" 173.00 1920 2048 2248 2576 1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode Virtual1 1920x1080\nxrandr --output Virtual1 --mode 1920x1080\n\nIn order to keep this customized screen resolution set after every reboot I did change ~/.xprofile.\nIn terminal gedit ~/.xprofile\nAdd following lines to the end of the file and save:\nxrandr --newmode \"1920x1080\" 173.00 1920 2048 2248 2576 1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode Virtual1 1920x1080\n\n\nA: I got it to work in rather a simple way. I installed vmware tools following the link sent above and then in VMWare VM settings, change video memory to 16MB which was previously set to 4MB. Windows 98 users would recall how limited options were with 4MB cards so there it is :).\n", "Q: Canon MP230 won't print on 15.04 Ubuntu I have a Canon MP230. I can scan with Ubuntu 15.04's simple scanner application, and I can print test pages, but I can't print doc files, pdf files, etc.\nWhat do I need to do to be able to print documents?\n\nA: I had the same issue with Canon PIXMA MP230 after upgrading from 15.04 to 15.10. \nWorked after installing the following Debian driver from Canon Website and adding the printer again in Ubuntu Printers:\nhttp://support-asia.canon-asia.com/contents/ASIA/EN/0100465901.html\ncd Downloads\ntar -zxvf cnijfilter-mp230series-3.80-1-deb.tar.gz\ncd cnijfilter-mp230series-3.80-1-deb\nsudo ./install.sh\n\n", "Q: Setup Ubuntu on a new drive - help needed I have an old laptop which had an HDD failure.\nSo I'm trying to fix it... got a new 128gb Solid state HDD.\nHowever, the windows(visa) sticker with the product code has over time lost some of the letters.

(the preserved space you can leave at 0 MB).\n\n*When this is successful, reboot, and select Unetbooting from the menu. This should start the LiveCD version of Ubuntu, and you should now be able to install Ubuntu to the external SSD drive.

required in Python? Regarding my previous question, I noticed that in both answers that used the open() function, there was no mention of closing the file.\nI've read that it's good practice to do so, but is there actually any need for it? Is it just unnecessary code?\nDoes the file get closed automatically?\n\nA: When do files get closed?\nAs we can learn from Is explicitly closing files important? (StackOverflow), the Python interpreter closes the file in the following cases:\n\n\n*\n\n*you manually invoke the close() method of a file object explicitly or implicitly by leaving a with open(...): block. This works of course always and on any Python implementation.\n\n*the file object's last reference got removed and therefore the object gets processed by the Garbage Collector. This is not a language feature, but a special feature of the CPython implementation only, so for portability don't rely on this!\n\n*the Python interpreter terminates. In this case it should close all file handles that got opened. Some older versions of Python3 would have also printed a warning that you should have closed them manually yourself. However, imagine a crash or you force-killing the Python interpreter and you will see that this is also not reliable.\n\n\nSo only the first (manual) method is reliable!\nWhat would happen if a file stays open?\nFirst, depending on the implementation of your Python interpreter, if you opened a file with write access, you can not be sure that your modifications got flushed to the disk until you either manually induce it or the file handler gets closed.\nSecond, you may only open a limited number of files on your system per user. If you exceed this limit by e.g. opening many files in a loop in your Python program without closing them as soon as possible, the system may refuse to open further file handles for you and you'll receive an exception. It may also happen that your program takes the last allowed open file and another program will fail because it gets declined.\nThird, open files on a removable device prevent it from getting unmounted or ejected. You may still delete the file on some file systems like ext4, where simply the file descriptor/hard link to the file's inode gets removed/unlinked but the program which opened the file may still access the inode through its own temporary file handler. This is e.g. also the mechanism that allows you to update packages while the respective software is running. However, e.g. NTFS has no such feature. It may however never get modified by two concurrent processes, so it will be still somehow blocked for others.\n", "Q: Leave old kernels installed could be dangerous? I have been using ubuntu for almost 2 years now and I always encounter guides on the internet on how to uninstall old kernel versions. \nEven here in Ask Ubuntu there are many questions in this way.\nMy question is: Must I do so?\nAre there problems or could it be dangerous to leave these old versions installed? \nAre there any advantages?\nEdit:\nJust two points to clarify the question:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm not asking instructions on how to remove old kernels.\n\n*I'm not worried with the safety in remove the old kernels. Instead, I'm worried about the safety of leaving them installed.\n\n\nA: The only problem you get by keeping all the old kernels is space. Every kernel-image along with the headers takes about 300 MB. \nEventually this can fill the partition and make security updates impossible. \nYou always want to keep at least one older kernel to have a fallback just in case. \n\nA: You do not have to leave old kernels, and you do not have to remove them.\nOld kernels just take space of your HDD. That's it. You can have one or two old kernels installed just in case you want to boot with one of them.\nOld kernels do not affect a working system in any way.\nSo it is 100% SAFE to leave old kernels installed if this was the question. They will not be used unless you deliberately boot with one of them.\n\nA: If you have a normal Ubuntu set up, and if you regularly run sudo apt-get autoremove, apt-get suggests the removal of older kernels. All you have to do is to reply \"Yes\"! The script that is responsible for the removal of older kernels always ensures that you have at least one fallback kernel available in case the newest one is not suitable to you.\nThe script I mentioned above is to be found here: /etc/kernel/postinst.d/apt-auto-removal. To quote from there:\n\n# Author: Steve Langasek \n#\n# Mark as not-for-autoremoval those kernel packages that are:\n#  - the currently booted version\n#  - the kernel version we've been called for\n#  - the latest kernel version (determined using rules copied from the grub\n#    package for deciding which kernel to boot)\n#  - the second-latest kernel version, if the booted kernel version is\n#    already the latest and this script is called for that same version,\n#    to ensure a fallback remains available in the event the newly-installed\n#    kernel at this ABI fails to boot\n# In the common case, this results in exactly two kernels saved, but it can\n# result in three kernels being saved.  It's better to err on the side of\n# saving too many kernels than saving too few.\n\n\nA: It is possible, though not very plausible that leaving old kernels installed is a security risk.\nNew kernel versions generally patch security problems. When you boot into a new kernel, you should be protected against these security problems.\nHere's a scenario in which it would be possible to exploit this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Attacker can remove kernels from your boot partition.\n\n*Attacker removes newer kernel versions, forcing the user to boot the older, unpatched kernel.\n\n*Attacker gets user to boot older kernel.\n\n*Once booted, the attacker uses the vulnerability to gain access to the machine.\n\n\nThis is possible, though not very plausible: generally if an attacker has access to your machine, you're going to have a bad day. He could almost as easily compromise your initramfs, even with full disk encryption enabled, and install a keylogger or worse.  \n\nA: Yes, it could be - if the console is accessible and the grub menu allows choosing which kernel to boot (not editing options, just choosing which one). If this is true, an unprivileged user could select an old kernel (either by rebooting the machine if they are allowed to do so, pulling the plug and restarting, or happening to be at the console when it boots) and proceed to exploit a local root escalation bug that's patched in the new kernel (random example: CVE-2012-0056).\nWhen new kernels containing security updates are installed, you should either remove the old ones or ensure they cannot be selected for booting by a malicious user.\n\nA: I see no danger at all in leaving old kernels in place - just having said that you take care for enough space under /boot, also for future needs.\nBut I have a special reason for keeping always one old kernel, one that does not get patches any more: oft it happens to me, that the newest active kernel gets patched, and then this one fails to start an important service - it is oft the wireless support. Then I reboot from my old spare kernel, and then reinstall the failing newer kernel, and everything works again.\nThe seasoned kernel brings only marginal danger: I use it only for short repairs!\n\nA: Having at least a previous Kernel can be positive in case of bad configurations or weird crashes. Which happen in Linux and since the OS is not OEM then there's no recovery system unless you make it beforehand. In the same page the crash or bad configuration can be so bad that it can't get fixed by falling back.\nYou can visit on using BTRFS snapshots AskUbuntu\n", "Q: Errors when installing LAMP on my Ubuntu server (apache2-bin, mysql-client-5.5, mysql-serer-5.5, mysql-server-core-5.5, php5-common) I tried installing LAMP following this tutorial: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP\nthe first command was: $ sudo apt-get install lamp-server^\nWhich gave me these errors: \n\nI tried installing apache2 separetly but I still get the first error for apache2-bin. \nI tried following these steps too: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18947426/apt-get-conflict-in-ubuntu\nwithout any success.  \nEDIT: \nTrying to install SSH server following this website: http://www.htpcbeginner.com/install-ssh-server-on-ubuntu-1204/\nfirst command output for this: sudo apt-get install openssh-server: \n\nEDIT #2: \nOutput for: uname -a; lsb-release -a; libck-connector0; sudo apt-get install libck-connector0\n\nEDIT #3: \nfor susspicious outpust: \nsudo apt-get install libck-connector0\n\n\nand: apt-get update; apt-cache policy libck-connector0\n\nEDIT #4: \napt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 16126D3A3E5C1192; apt-get update \n\n\nA: Ok, let's try something else:\n\n\n*\n\n*I see that at one point you had information, that you have held some packages, try to run dpkg --get-selections | grep hold to see those packages (they may be blocking other packages from being installed); if the list is empty, then proceed to the next point, if not, you can try to uninstall/purge some of those packages by hand\n\n*if above does not help, try apt-get -f install - which should force finish any pending changes - if it uninstalls/installs any packages, run apt-get update and/or remove repo information and then try to install LAMP\n\n*you can also try apt-get autoremove, but I've never seen such problems caused by unused packages, but who knows\n\n\nAlso found this to clean held packages:\n\n\n*\n\n*show held packages \n\n\n\napt-mark showhold\n\n\n\n*\n\n*un-hold them by\n\n\n\nsudo apt-mark unhold [package name]\n\nSource: E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages\n\nA: It seems that this instructions are for some older version of Ubuntu.\nTry:\nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get install apache2 mysql-client mysql-server php5 libapache2-mod-php5\n\nYou will be asked for all necessary passwords during installation process.\nApache and MySQL will be started automatically and addedd to start at boot.\nI'd also recommend installing phpmyadmin for database operations.\n\nA: Its possible that the repositories from where you are trying to install from have changed since your iso image was created.\nTry running these commands:\nrm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\nThis will remove the package lists.

To be absolutely sure, use a loop (which will be much slower than running head just once):\nfor file in *.txt ; do\n    head -n1 \"$file\"\ndone\n\n\nA: Using only Bash:\nfor f in *.txt; do <\"$f\" read line; printf \"$line\\n\" >>new.txt; done\n\n\n\n*\n\n**.txt is expanded to the list of folders / files ending with .txt in the current working directory (since there are only files folders ending with .txt are not a concern);\n\n*<\"$f\" read line reads one line from the file path stored in f and stores it in line;\n\n*printf \"$line\\n\" >>new.txt: appends the content of line to new.txt;\n\n\n% cat foo.txt \nline #1 in foo\nline #2 in foo\nline #3 in foo\n\n% cat bar.txt\nline #1 in bar\nline #2 in bar\nline #3 in bar\n\n% for f in *.txt; do <\"$f\" read line; printf \"$line\\n\" >>new.txt; done\n\n% cat new.txt \nline #1 in bar\nline #1 in foo\n\n\nA: You have tried it with awk, here is a awk version\nawk 'FNR==1 {print} {nextfile}' *.txt > out\n\n\nA: Another approach with AWK is to tell AWK to print, but then immediately go to next file\ntmp:$ touch file1 file2 file3\n\ntmp:$ printf  \"Line 1 \\n Line 2\" | tee file1 file2 file3\nLine 1 \n Line 2\ntmp:$ awk '{print;nextfile}' file1 file2 file3\nLine 1 \nLine 1 \nLine 1\n\nsed also allows printing of specific lines .

You can have as many as you want of those.\nIf you don't want you configuration files to clash, simply use different home folders for different versions. For example, if you downloaded firefox, extracted it and renamed the folder to \"firefox2\" in your home folder, do the following:\ncd firefox2\nexport HOME=$(pwd)      #sets current folder as your home for all programs invoked from this terminal or script\n./firefox --no-remote   #without \"no-remote\" firefox creates a new window for active firefox session\n\nNotice that linux created a \".mozilla\" folder in your firefox2 folder. You can have as many versions as you like and even run them at the same time.\n\nA: Short answer\nYou can't.\nLong Answer\nDownload the compressed browser package, extract it and locate the launcher.\nCopy the package over the different /home directories.\nFirefox packages: https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/1.0/contrib/\nChrome: Can't find any - Google doesn't seem to officially support compressed packages of its browser.\n", "Q: Examine processes and threads of a program in the terminal I would like to know if it is possible to view a running program entirely on terminal.

This is not too ubuntu specific but kind of.\nI wanted to setup a dedicated game server for Don't Starve together which is only avaiable in 32 bit. I installed it on ubuntu and it worked perfectly then I wanted to run it on my bananapi which has an ARM processor. I started coping all the librarys from my ubuntu computer to my arm machine and the server works.\nHow is this possible?\n\nA: Installing 32bit libs works on a 64bit processor because 64bit is a superset of 32bit CPU instructions. However ARM CPUs use a different instruction set. Even if you installed the libraries, you can't use them without also emulating a 32bit x86 CPU for everything to run through.\nYou can do that with Qemu (or another virtualisation option that supports ARM hosts), essentially running a second x86 version of Ubuntu in the background but it's obviously going to be quite slow. I woulnd't want to play a demanding game.\nThere are also commercial options in the space but they cost as much as another ARM board.\n", "Q: How to get desktop notification for new mails using mutt?

I also don't want to use a different mail client, like Thunderbird, I want to use mutt or maybe some other only for this purpose.\nIs there a way I can configure mutt to run regularly and issue a desktop notification?\n\nA: I know this is a 1-year old question, but aside from hacking a script to run mutt, you could just get some third-party app that checks your mail for you.\nI use Mail Notification and I've been enjoying it, don't have to rely so much on my tablets informing me of mail.\n\nA: One way to do this is to use offlineimap and then check the folders for new files (a new email in your inbox corresponds to a new file in the inbox folder). I would also highly recommend this if you do not check your email often because this way you can do everything very fast. The process is: download all your emails, and then process them fast (because they are already on your computer so mutt does not need to download everytime you open an email).\nI recommend offlineimap + mutt-kz + notmuch.

If you remove | wc -l from the command, it returns the files themselves. \nSee man find for more information on how to use find.\n\nEdit:\nThis is an excerpt from man find. As you can see, there are many possibilities to define the permissions in the search.

This will match a file which has mode 0777, for example.\n\n    find . -perm /222\n\n    Search for files which are writable by somebody (their owner, or their group, or anybody else).    \n\n    find . -perm /220\n    find . -perm /u+w,g+w\n    find . -perm /u=w,g=w\n\n    All three of these commands do the same thing, but the first one uses the octal representation of the file mode, and the other two use the symbolic\n    form. These  commands  all search for files which are writable by either their owner or their group.  The files don't have to be writable by both\n    the owner and group to be matched; either will do.\n\n    find . -perm -220\n    find . -perm -g+w,u+w\n\n    Both these commands do the same thing; search for files which are writable by both their owner and their group.\n\n    find . -perm -444 -perm /222 ! -perm /111\n    find . -perm -a+r -perm /a+w ! -perm /a+x\n\n    These two commands both search for files that are readable for everybody ( -perm -444 or -perm -a+r), have at least one write bit set ( -perm  /222\n    or -perm /a+w) but are not executable for anybody ( ! -perm /111 and ! -perm /a+x respectively).\n\n", "Q: run .py files in python?

Whenever I click the Firefox icon in the Unity toolbar it takes me to the workspace with Firefox currently open which is a useful feature. However, every time I click the Firefox icon I'd like a new window in Firefox to open. I know it's possible to right click the icon and click \"Open a New Window\" but I'd like \"Open a New Window\" to be the default.\nHere is a terrible hack that I implemented this morning but I'd like to learn a more elegant solution.\nFirst I created a script called openfirefox and placed it in my home directory /home/user\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfirefox &\n\nI made the file executable and then used the gnome-desktop-item-edit command to create a .desktop file and placed it on the desktop\n$ sudo gnome-desktop-item-edit /home/user/Desktop --create-new\n\nI entered the fields as follows\nName: MyFox\nCommand: /home/user/openfirefox\n\nThis created a .desktop file on my desktop. Now whenever I double click the MyFox.desktop file, a new Firefox window opens everytime. \nSo, is there a more elegant way to do what I want? Perhaps if I edit /usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop I can change the defaults? Maybe there is a Unity setting I can change?\nNote: I am also aware you can simply press the shift key to open a new window but I'm just wondering if there is a way to make it a default. If this is an unrealistic request I'll just make do with shift and MyFox.desktop\n\nA: We will make a copy of the Firefox launcher for your user account and modify the default action by adding the -new-window argument to the firefox command.\nFirst, we copy the original firefox.desktop to the right folder in your home directory:\ncp /usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/\n\nSecond, we can simply modify the correct line with the command below:\nsed -i 's/%u/-new-window %u/' ~/.local/share/applications/firefox.desktop\n\nThis searches for occurrences of %u in the file and replaces them with -new-window %u. That works because the %u argument place-holder only appears once in the Exec line of the default action. The modified line is:\n\n\n*\n\n*from: Exec=firefox %u\n\n*to: Exec=firefox -new-window %u\nIMPORTANT: You need to restart Unity afterwards by logging out and back in!\nOtherwise Unity doesn't recognize that there's a new file in your home directory that should override the system-wide one and you won't see any change.\n\nA: I think that you can put the .desktop file - that you created on your Desktop - in the Launcher. \nIf not, place it in ~/.local/share/applications/, on the next login it should show up in Unity and then you can put it in the Launcher.\n", "Q: Code::Blocks error: \"...project has not been built yet\" I'm a Lubuntu user.

Are you looking at a particular script that you want to behave a certain way?\nIf you have a script that accepts arguments you can specify an argument which might route through a certain part of the script.\nOther than that, if you start a script it will perform what it was set to do and run according to it's program unless it happens to encounter an error and crash.\nA function is virtually a routine.  A script might branch to certain functions according to conditions of the purpose of the scrip.  If you have a script to perform functions on files which might include creating temporary space (directories of files) for processing the files, it might also have a routine (function) to clean the workspace or temporary file.  It may be designed not to run the cleanup function if it didn't find any files to process.\nOther than running the script according to hit's design, you'd have to actually edit the script and make modifications to have it operate or skip the functions you don't want to have it run.\n", "Q: How to print \"-n\" without issuing a newline?

The best solution IMHO is\necho -e \"-n\\c\"\n\nIt does not add any extra characters.\necho -e \"-n\\n\"\n\nprints the same but with a new line char.\n\nA: I think if you definitely want to use echo only, this should satisfy you:\necho \"-n \"\n\nThis works because while -n is a valid option for echo, -n with a space after it is not. Since it isn't an option, echo just prints it.\n\nA: You guys are really overthinking it.\n echo -e \\\\055n\n\nOr with no trailing newline\n echo -en \\\\055n\n\n\nA: The problem is that echo interprets the -n as an argument. On the default bash implementation, that means (from help echo):\n\n  -n  do not append a newline\n\n\nThere are various ways of getting around that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make it into something that isn't an option by including another character. For example, tell echo not to print a newline with -n, then tell it to interpret backslash escapes with -e and add the newline explicitly.\n$ echo -ne '-n\\n'\n-n\n\n\n*Alternatively, just include a space\n$ echo \" -n\"\n -n\n\nThat, however, adds a space which you probably don't want. \n\n*Use a non-printing character before it. Here. I am using the backspace (\\b)\n$ echo -e \"\\b-n\"\n-n\n\nThis also adds an extra character you probably don't want.     \n\n*Use trickery\n$ echo n- | rev\n-n\n\nThe rev command simply prints its output reversed.   \n\n*Use the right tool for the job\n$ printf -- '-n\\n'\n-n\n\n\nA: In Bash script you can run:\necho -n -\necho n\n\nOr in interacive shell:\necho -n - ; echo n\n\nThis echoes a - character and an n character.\n\nA: To extend @A.B's answer, the only portable way to use echo is to refrain from using any options like -n. Consider use printf instead where available. This reference page provides more details and explains very well when and how echo and printf should be used:\n\nNowadays, echo(1) is only portable if you omit flags and escape sequences. \n  Use printf(1) instead, if you need more than plain text. \n\n\nA: Sometimes it's a good idea to use the right tool.

I am keeping it for the sake of completeness.\n\nA: Note: This answer got updated in January 2019 according to JetBrains' recommendations at that time and because GetDeb seems broken. To see my previous version of the answer, check the revisions.\nYou can visit the PyCharm Download page for Linux.\nThey offer three different ways to install PyCharm (Professional or Community Edition) there, in order of my personal preference. Decide on one of them:\nJetBrains Toolbox App:\nDon't download PyCharm directly, but instead get and install the free Toolbox App to manage all of your JetBrains IDEs easily. The Toolbox lets you conveniently manage and install all JetBrains IDEs and update them with a single click, all in one place. It can also centrally manage your account login, if you have a paid license. \nI would strongly recommend it, especially if you might want to use any other JetBrains IDEs like e.g. IntelliJ or WebStorm too. This method also doesn't need administrator rights, everything will be installed in your home directory (~/.local/share/JetBrains by default).\nTo go this way, download the Toolbox installer first. It comes as .tar.gz archive again, but only contains a single AppImage executable. Extract and run that to install the Toolbox. You can delete the downloaded archive and AppImage after that again. Then, launch the Toolbox App:\n\nIt will list your installed IDEs, and show all other available products below that. Just click the Install button next to the PyCharm edition you want (free Community or paid Professional) and it will do everything for you in background.\nYou should also probably check the Toolbox settings and adapt them to your preference. To do that, click the screw nut symbol in the top right corner. Most importantly in my opinion, decide if you want it to keep the previous version after an update as fallback. Note that each IDE will take roughly around 1GB disk storage, and if you have many IDEs installed and also keep fallback versions, this can add up to a lot of space if your Ubuntu partition isn't that big. You can also switch automatic Toolbox (not IDE) updates, Toolbox autostart and sending anonymous statistics on or off.\nInstall as snap package:\nJetBrains offers all PyCharm editions as snap packages for Ubuntu. This should be supported since 16.04. Some flavours of Ubuntu (like Lubuntu) might not come with snap support preinstalled though. Check this installation guide in that case.\nI have not personally tried this approach, but it looks like a good thing to me.\nInstalling a PyCharm snap should be as simple as running one of the below commands, depending on which edition you want:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo snap install pycharm-community --classic\n\n\n*sudo snap install pycharm-professional --classic\n\n\n*sudo snap install pycharm-educational --classic\n\nNext, run either pycharm-community, pycharm-professional, or pycharm-educational in the terminal, depending on which you installed.\nDownload as .tar.gz archive:\nYou can select and download an archive containing either the Professional or Community Edition from the page linked above. \nThis method should probably work on any system, but I would personally not really recommended it as you have to manually extract it somewhere and updates are also not that easy. \nIf you decide to go for this anyway, follow the instructions here after you downloaded the .tar.gz archive file for your preferred edition. For your convenience, here's an adapted version of the official instructions:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Unpack the pycharm-*.tar.gz file to the folder where you want to install PyCharm:\ntar xfz pycharm-*.tar.gz -C <new_archive_folder>\n\nThe recommended installation location according to the filesystem hierarchy standard (FHS) is /opt. To install PyCharm into this directory, enter the following command:\nsudo tar xfz pycharm-*.tar.gz -C /opt/\n\n(Personal note: I would advise against putting PyCharm in a location that requires sudo permissions to write. Pick a location somewhere in your home directory instead to avoid permission problems in the future, e.g. during updates.)\n  \n*Switch to the bin subdirectory:\ncd <new_archive_folder>/pycharm-*/bin\n\nFor example,\ncd /opt/pycharm-*/bin\n\n  \n*Run pycharm.sh from the bin subdirectory.\n\n\nA: There are a lot of resources around the web explaining that you should install it from a tar.gz or an unofficial PPA.\nWhile using a PPA is a nice solution, I wanted to point out that Pycharm is supported by ubuntu-make.\nUbuntu-make is supported by Canonical and is a way to install any IDE you may need.\nSteps are as follows:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-desktop/ubuntu-make\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-make\numake ide pycharm\n\nYou can now launch pycharm from the unity launcher\n\nA: PyCharm is also available as a snap package.\nsudo snap install pycharm-community --classic\nThis is the Ubuntu latest iteration at an app model and any package available as a snap should be preferred. Snaps can be installed on almost all versions of Linux (as long as you've installed the snap core).\nA benefit of snaps is that they update in the background, so you will always have the latest version.\n\nNOTE: --classic confinement may perform arbitrary system changes outside of the security sandbox that snaps are usually confined to, which may put your system at risk.\nWARNING: The publisher for this snap is joeborg, so you are trusting him.\n\n", "Q: Odd interface when running sudo ifconfig So, I've noticed an odd looking interface...

I have traced the problem to VMware Workstation 12 running on the system. The problem is triggered by suspending and resuming VMware Workstation.]\nSince upgrading to Kubuntu 15.10 (from 14.04 LTS), some programs that display JPEG and PNG files are taking a very long time to run.

Opening a file without those system calls is impossible\nYour question appears to ask whether a file can be edited without text editor. That is possible, as others have shown. My little contribution here is the following:\nawk '/^PermitRootLogin/{$2=\"yes\"}1' /etc/ssh/sshd_config > /tmp/sshd_config && mv /tmp/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\nBasically with AWK , we find appropriate line, replace field 2 , which is \"no\" to \"yes\", output everything to tmp file and replace original with tmp file using mv. \nRemember that ownership of that config file belongs to root , so you would need sudo access ( add sudo before mv )\n\nA: You can use Vim in Ex mode:\nex -sc '/^PermitRootLogin/s/yes/no/|x' /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\n\n\n*\n\n*s substitute\n\n*x save and close\n", "Q: install procenv on 12.04 I'm trying to troubleshoot a failing upstart script, and for that I need procenv. \nI tried sudo apt-get install procenv But that fails with E: Unable to locate package procenv.

Without TLP, you may still be using some of your laptop's power management options: TLP is just a package that offers fairly comprehensive control over a wide range of laptop power management features all in one place and its default configuration is good for battery life.\nYour tlp-stat output indicates that TLP is active, with this section\n+++ System Status\nTLP power save = enabled\npower source   = battery\n\nAnd you can also see all the devices whose power consumption it is controlling.\nAs for why the battery current did not update between two runs, I don't know the answer.  It is possible that the battery hardware in your laptop doesn't report this statistic correctly or averages it over a specific time period.  This in itself is not an indication that TLP is not working; a proper test should involve giving the laptop a known workload and timing how long it is until the battery depletes.  Of course this takes time.\n\nA: Sure it does, but it depends on your hardware ...\nWhat tlp-stat shows in current_now is the exact value the ACPI-BIOS gets from the battery pack electronics and signals it to the Linux kernel. So no interpretation or conversion in tlp-stat here.\nEven with modern LED backlight displays there is a typical difference around 2-4 W between min and max brightness.\nConclusion: something goes wrong between battery pack – ACPI-BIOS – kernel;  causing a wrong reading of current_now.\nAnother hint: your laptop has two graphics chips:\n/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:02.0/power/control = auto (0x030000, VGA compatible controller, i915)\n/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:04:00.0/power/control = auto (0x038000, Display controller, fglrx_pci)\n\nAn integrated one (Intel, i915 driver) and a discrete one (AMD, fglrx driver). The impact of two graphics chips is huge – possibly far more than TLP can save. You should disable one of them – preferable AMD – to optimize power consumption on battery. \nTLP intentionally doesn't have a feature to switch graphics, so please look for Ubuntu hybrid graphics tutorials. \n", "Q: Weird youtube logo today Anyone else see the youtube logo like this today?\n\nIt suddenly became some weird blue thing.

I have been installing various tools on ubuntu 14.04 from the kali linux repo, via katoolin. After installing the tools that I needed I rebooted my computer and removed the kali linux repo from the ppa, also via katoolin.

The language of the OS is still in English, however in settings under languages the locale is displayed as \"c\" and no others are available to choose from. The other concern this brings is that many programs wont install as locales is a dependency. I can't reinstall english locales as it also says that locales are an unmet dependency.

But after installing it I noticed that some Unity elements behavior changed.\nTypically I found that:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I scroll over the icon on the top-right of the screen representing the sound volume, I don't see the scale indicating the volume changed as I used to.\n\n*An error message is shown whenever I login to my account, this message shows that I some applications cannot access my account information. This message is because I changed one of my social media accounts password. So it's an expected message. But what's not expected is that the look and feel of the shown dialog has changed, it shows an orange strip on one of it's side. In the past it was just a gray hovering tooltip look-alike thing which visually integrated well with Unity.\n\n\nSo my question is how to restore how Unity behaved like before installing Mate without having to completely reset it and lose my settings and configurations such as the shortcuts I created on the Unity launcher ?\nIf reinstalling Unity is the only solution I'm willing to do it. I found someone posting the following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall unity\n\nBut they seemed risky. Would someone please explain how would these commands affect my system ?\n\nA: If you want to delete Mate and restore Unity, you can try this:\nOpen a terminal,Press Ctrl+Alt+T\nRun it:\nsudo -i\napt-get update\napt-get install --reinstall aptitude deborphan\naptitude remove '?and(?reverse-depends(mate),?not(?reverse-depends(?exact-name(ubuntu-desktop))))'\napt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\ndeborphan\napt-get --purge remove $(deborphan)\ndeborphan --libdevel\napt-get --purge remove $(deborphan --libdevel)\ndeborphan --find-config\ndpkg --purge $(deborphan --find-config)\napt-get autoremove\napt-get clean\nreboot\n\nThis removes the installed packages that reverse-depend on mate and not those for ubuntu-desktop.\n", "Q: How can I change my wireless card's regulatory domain (Dbm higher than 30)?

I wonder why they don't like each other. and what is preventing them from being associated...Any thoughts will be greatly appreciated!\n=====================================\ndmesg |grep wlan0\n[    5.902703] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): wlan0: link is not ready\n[    5.984403] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): wlan0: link is not ready\n[    6.292143] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): wlan0: link is not ready\n[   33.086486] wlan0: authenticate with <router mac addr>\n[   33.092328] wlan0: send auth to <router mac addr> (try 1/3)\n[   33.180050] wlan0: authenticated\n[   33.180218] iwlwifi 0000:03:00.0 wlan0: disabling HT as WMM/QoS is not supported by the AP\n[   33.180222] iwlwifi 0000:03:00.0 wlan0: disabling VHT as WMM/QoS is not supported by the AP\n[   33.184143] wlan0: associate with <router mac addr> (try 1/3)\n[   33.288048] wlan0: associate with <router mac addr> (try 2/3)\n[   33.392015] wlan0: associate with <router mac addr> (try 3/3)\n[   33.495959] wlan0: association with <router mac addr> timed out\n.....\n\nlshw -c network===============\n-network\n       description: Wireless interface\n       product: Wireless 7265\n       vendor: Intel Corporation\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:03:00.0\n       logical name: wlan0\n       version: 59\n       serial: <mac addr>\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list ethernet physical wireless\n       configuration: broadcast=yes driver=iwlwifi driverversion=4.2.6-040206-generic firmware=15.227938.0 latency=0 link=no multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11abgn\n       resources: irq:50 memory:e1000000-e1001fff\n\nlspci -nnk===========\n03:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Intel Corporation Wireless 7265 [8086:095b] (rev 59)\n    Subsystem: Intel Corporation Dual Band Wireless-AC 7265 [8086:5210]\n    Kernel driver in use: iwlwifi\n=====================================\n\n\nA: We see this in your wireless script in /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf: \n\noptions iwlwifi bt_coex_active=N swcrypto=1 11n_disable=1\n  p2p_disabled=1\n\nAs you can see, p2p_disabled is not a valid parameter:\nparm:           swcrypto:using crypto in software (default 0 [hardware]) (int)\nparm:           11n_disable:disable 11n functionality, bitmap: 1: full, 2: disable agg TX, 4: disable agg RX, 8 enable agg TX (uint)\nparm:           amsdu_size_8K:enable 8K amsdu size (default 0) (int)\nparm:           fw_restart:restart firmware in case of error (default true) (bool)\nparm:           antenna_coupling:specify antenna coupling in dB (default: 0 dB) (int)\nparm:           nvm_file:NVM file name (charp)\nparm:           d0i3_disable:disable d0i3 functionality (default: Y) (bool)\nparm:           lar_disable:disable LAR functionality (default: N) (bool)\nparm:           uapsd_disable:disable U-APSD functionality (default: Y) (bool)\nparm:           bt_coex_active:enable wifi/bt co-exist (default: enable) (bool)\nparm:           led_mode:0=system default, 1=On(RF On)/Off(RF Off), 2=blinking, 3=Off (default: 0) (int)\nparm:           power_save:enable WiFi power management (default: disable) (bool)\nparm:           power_level:default power save level (range from 1 - 5, default: 1) (int)\nparm:           fw_monitor:firmware monitor - to debug FW (default: false - needs lots of memory) (bool)\n\nI suggest that you do:\nsudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf\n\nUse nano or kate or leafpad if you don't have the text editor gedit.

Check yours:\nsudo iw reg get\n\nIf you get 00, that is a one-size-maybe-fits-all setting. Find yours here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 Then set it temporarily:\nsudo iw reg set IS\n\nOf course, substitute your country code if not Iceland. Set it permanently:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/crda\n\nChange the last line to read:\nREGDOMAIN=IS\n\nProofread carefully, save and close the text editor.\nReboot and tell us if connectivity is improved.\nYou might try installing more recent firmware:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install git\ngit clone https://github.com/OpenELEC/iwlwifi-firmware.git\ncd iwlwifi-firmware\nsudo ./install\n\nReboot.

I have a working ffmpeg command to combine an audio/video file with an audio file, and I am now trying to perform the same operation using avconv on Ubuntu 14.04.

The vast majority of hard disks today use 512-byte logical sectors, although I've heard of some high-end disks that now use 4096-byte logical sectors. Some external enclosures also re-map the logical sector size to be 4096 bytes.\nThe combination of 512-byte logical sectors with 4096-byte physical sectors can result in performance problems if partitions are not aligned on multiples of 8 sectors. Most partitioning tools today handle this automatically -- in fact, they typically align on multiples of 2048 sectors (1 MiB), which of course is a multiple of 8 sectors and so works well. (Using 2048-sector alignment also works with many RAID and SSD products that require alignment on power-of-2 values higher than 8, which is why 2048 is the default.) Older tools aligned on \"cylinder\" boundaries. In the distant past (1980s-ish), cylinder alignment produced performance benefits; but then \"cylinders\" became a convenient fiction, then an inconvenient fiction, then a serious problem. Linux tools adjusted to these changes rather slowly, but today all the major programs ignore cylinders and use 2048-sector alignment by default.\nYou can adjust the alignment value to anything you like with gdisk -- you must type x to get to the experts' menu, then type d to change the alignment value. Note that this option is on the experts' menu for a reason: If you don't fully understand what you're doing, you're more likely to cause problems than solve them by using this feature. Even if you're an expert, the space savings from changing from 2048- to 8-sector alignment will be trivial (under 1MiB), so even I almost never do this. (I'm gdisk's author.)\n\nA: Warning: You requested a partition from 4096B to 3001GB.                  \nThe closest location we can manage is 17.4kB to 3001GB.\nIs this still acceptable to you?\n\nWhat this is saying is that due to other things at the beginning of the drive (metadata about the partitioning scheme or similar) the closest it can get to the start of the disk is 17.4kB in.  You don't want this; you want it to start on a 4KiB boundary.  So you should cancel and try again, this time requesting to start the partition on the first 4096B boundary beyond that point (try 20480B).\nThe reason you have to go through this manually is you're using a low level partitioning tool.  A higher level tool like gparted will automatically align the start of a partition to a round number for you.  These days many such tools will align partitions to a multiple of 1MiB (1024x1024 bytes) as this neatly solves both the 512byte, 4096 byte boundaries as well as aligning with blocks on things like USB flash drives.\n\nA: Simply leave the calculation to parted using percents as units:\nmkpart primary 0% 100%\n\nWhich should result in aligned partition:\n(parted) print                                                            \nModel: ATA SAMSUNG MZ7LM3T8 (scsi)\nDisk /dev/sdb: 3841GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\nPartition Table: gpt\nDisk Flags: \n\nNumber  Start   End     Size    File system  Name     Flags\n 1      1049kB  3841GB  3841GB               primary\n\n\nA: GPT needs the first 34 sectors of your disk to store\n\n\n*\n\n*the protective MBR in the first sector (LBA 0),\n\n*the primary GPT-header in the second sector (LBA 1),\n\n*and up to 128 partition table entries in the following 32 sectors (LBA 2 - LBA 33)\n\n\nThese sectors are reserved, no other data can be stored in these sectors, a partition can not start in any of them. \n34 sectors with a size of 512B = 17408B = 17.4kB\nThat's why you get the warning The closest location we can manage is 17.4kB to 3001GB.\nYou should not proceed here, it would lead to a bad alignment of the partition, this is already covered in other answers you received.\nNote that also the last 33 sectors of the disk are reserved to keep a copy of the\nprimary GPT-header and the partition table entries.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table\n", "Q: Kubuntu gets hung up on udev whenever installing anything I have just installed Kubuntu 15 and I am an Ubuntu newbie .\nEverything went swimmingly during the install (I'm using the computer now) but when I click on the little red shield update button or if I try to download any software via the software centre, it gets to 'configuring udev' or 'udev' (respectively) and just seems to stay there.\nI have googled a fair bit but the only question that seemed to make any sense to me was one where the user suggested that the ISP bandwidth squeeze had scuppered an update and so he needed to delete the first set of files downloaded before restarting. That only makes sense to me because, having downloaded the OS in the first place I can imagine the 100 odd updates it suggested would have alarmed Mr Murdoch's broadband company.\nUnfortunately, I can't even figure out how to use the command line, let alone figure out whether that's my issue.

After the removal of /etc/apt/source.list, the folder /etc/apt usually contains only this folder.\n\nA: The sources.list can be generated in multiple ways. The GUI provided in ubuntu basically generates that file (it is in Settings -> Software). There is /usr/share/doc/apt/examples/sources.list which is in all the proper format. You can copy the example file to original file, cp /usr/share/doc/apt/examples/sources.list  /etc/apt/sources.list\nAnd there is also online generator https://repogen.simplylinux.ch/\nBut your file should remain in /etc/apt directory.

How can I recover it? I wanted to create dual boot machine with Windows 10 and Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS but something went wrong and I accidentally formatted Windows partition. After formatting, I cancelled installation. I didn't click on \"Install\" and so I think that data hasn't been overwritten. So, how can I recover the partition with all data (if possible)?\nI need this data badly as I don't have, unfortunately, a backup for them.\n\nI'm trying to use TestDisk on Ubuntu liveCD but I don't want to make another mistake. What do I have to do now?\nI'm at this point:\n\nHPFS - NTFS [OS] and HPFS - NTFS [DATA] should be the old partitions of Windows (C: and D:). If I select the first one and press P the terminal crashes, but if I do the same with both NTFS [DATA] partitions it shows me the list of a part of my files. But now I don't know how to proceed...\n\nA: It's extremely unlikely that you'll recover a fully working Windows installation. Although you haven't written any files to your Linux partitions, their mere existence means that you've overwritten parts of the original partitions, irretrievably replacing some data on them. If you're very very very VERY lucky, nothing important will have been lost; but chances are at least one or two critical boot files is now toast. If you're merely very very lucky, TestDisk might recover the partition in an intact-enough state to enable you to copy your personal files off. If not, you'll need to use PhotoRec or a similar tool to do a file-level recovery.\n\nA: \nThis solution was written by frak in the question and was moved here as an answer.\n\nI solved the problem in this way, recovering 99% of my files:\n\n\n*\n\n*downloaded the latest version of TestDisk from the CGSecurity site (and not with sudo apt-get install testdisk, it installs an older one that crashes when you have to list files of some partition, at least in my case)\n\n*started testdisk and made a deeper search, pressed P for listing files and then copied them to an external device pressing C\n\n*reinstalled Windows and Ubuntu\n\n*copied files from the external HDD\n\n\nAnd now it's all fine, thanks!\n", "Q: Moto G not listed by Qt Creator / adb after upgrading to 15.10 I developed happily with my Moto G on Ubuntu 15.04 a while ago.

There's there, because I can see from my software on Win7 that there is 10GB used on the disk, so it is Ubuntu I guess. Now I'm facing the problem, how can I make the external HDD bootable? Any ideas?\n\nA: Assuming your installation completed successfully, the drive should already be marked bootable. Enter your bios on boot(F2 or F12) to change your boot sequence and place your external disk(USB I guess) before hard disk.  \n\nA: Make sure you installed GRUB, on the external drive (Made that mistake once... or twice...).\nTo boot a removable HDD you need to catch not the bios config but the boot device menu (On one of my comps it's ESC, on one it's F8, on one F12) during POST, because as soon as you disconnect the device the bios will \"forget\" it.\nAlso, on my laptop I have to boot Windows on power-up and then reboot into Ubuntu because the USB ports aren't powered up early enough or something.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Can't detect Wily bootable USB stick under UEFI I hope this is not too much of a duplicate, I tried checking out old questions and answers but without luck, UEFI has been giving problems for 3+ years now but still I struggle with it.\nHere's the situation: I have an ACER Aspire VN7, I am trying to install Ubuntu 15.10 on it with dual boot (leaving the original windows 10 aside). But I can't succeed making the pc see the Ubuntu USB stick, no matter what.\nAs advised, I disabled Windows quick startup from the control panel, disabled the security lock in the BIOS (but there doesn't seem to be any quick startup option to disable there), but still the machine will ignore the bootable USB stick altogether.\nI also tried Rod Smith's rEFInd alongside, as he suggested on some old answer. The result is that my pc boots on rEFInd as it should but still ignores the Ubuntu USB (not even within rEFInd does it show up as an option).\nI managed to successfully boot from the same Ubuntu 15.10 USB stick after switching the BIOS boot to Legacy instead of UEFI, but UEFI has been standard for Windows for at least 3 years now and I would definitely prefer if a UEFI solution could be found.\nI will be very grateful to anybody who could provide advices or insights!\n\nA: How did you prepare the USB drive? Some programs for writing .iso files to USB flash drives omit EFI boot loaders and so won't work for booting in EFI mode. Some have options that affect bootability. Some create USB flash drives that work OK on some EFI-based computers but not on others. In short, you may need to try another program. I have notes on several programs here. In brief, Rufus under Windows seems pretty flexible and reliable. From Ubuntu, I generally use dd, but some people like UNetbootin. Even if you use a program that's generally reliable, though, it might be failing for your computer, so you may need to try something else.\nIf you are forced to do a BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode install, I recommend doing it as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the installer in its \"try before installing\" mode.\n\n*Open a Terminal window.\n\n*Type ubiquity -b. This launches the installer and tells it to not install a boot loader.\n\n*When the installation has finished, boot with the rEFInd USB flash drive you already have. It should detect your Ubuntu installation and enable you to boot it.\n\n*Install the EFI-mode version of GRUB (in the grub-efi package), rEFInd, or any other boot loader you like to the computer's hard disk. This should enable you to boot without the rEFInd USB drive.\n\n\nUpon re-reading your answer, it's unclear if you used rEFInd on a USB drive or installed it from Windows. If the latter, you may need to install an EFI filesystem driver for your Ubuntu filesystem (ext4fs by default), but if you're happy with rEFInd, you won't need to re-install it.\n", "Q: Two different ways of starting a service.

The microphone should be used only when recording, not for general use. Is Ubuntu into the business of leaving open back doors to violate our assumed \nprivacy? \nFor anyone  who  cares about his/her privacy, this default configuration \nshould not be OK. \nI have not used Ubuntu for  sometime now. Is the accepted default configuration?\n\nA: Ubuntu recognizes your Mic as an input device so applications can use it properly.  This is how operating systems work.  They create interfaces to interact with.\nI am not sure what you are getting at in terms of privacy, but it is not a concern as you are in control of your computer and what applications you install.\nIf you are worried an application will listen in to your MIC without your permission then you probably shouldn't install it, or at the very least do a security audit.\nI encourage your privacy conscious behavior.  It is most welcome in the Linux community.  One thing that is not really acceptable in this case is making accusations, or crying foul without having proof.  In other words if you are curious about something just ask about it, but if you do not know then I would just suggest you frame something you are worried about in the form of a question so you get a better response.\nYou can also disable your MIC if you wish.  \nalsamixer\n\nBut to answer your question, yes this is an acceptable configuration though.\n", "Q: HybridGraphics AMD/INTEL doesn't work Another trouble with HybridGraphics.

But to my surprise, the second backup took as much time as the first one, even though no files had changed between both backups. \nImportant note: the backup is on a samba network drive.\nShouldn't the second backup been much faster since no file had changed since the first one?\n\nA: You may want to include the -t command line argument to rsync, telling it to preserve the time stamps, as otherwise the time stamps are bound to differ, causing files to be transferred anew. Alternatively, you should include -I to tell rsync to ignore time stamps. Anyway, you might enjoy some quality time with\nman rsync\n\n\nA: By default, rsync checks file size and modification time before transferring to check whether the files are identical or not.\nThe rsync transfer time is rather misleading for files of same size and modification time, if you do rsync -vvv then you would see rsync spends most of the time doing the delta transfer check to make sure the files are identical, rsync does this chunk by chunk. In a nutshell, if the size and modification time remains the same, rsync won't do a transfer.\nAlso note that you can do a checksum before transfer by using the --checksum option.\nIn your case though, as the file sizes are same then it must be the modification time causing the files to be re-transferred. This is justified as you have used no option that preserves modification time on rsync.\nYou can use -t (--times) option to preserve modification time or -a (--archive) option that includes -rlptgoD options together:\nsudo rsync -vv -trP /inputFolder ~/backupFolder\n\nsudo rsync -avvP /inputFolder ~/backupFolder\n\n", "Q: How to install Red5 on Ubuntu with my vps company OVH How do I install Red5 on my ubuntu to support cometchat?\nI see some instruction but they don't explain to install Red5 with ubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.cometchat.com/documentation/php/admin/plugins/audio-video-chat-plugin/red5-or-fms-rtmp/\n\n*https://support.cometchat.com/documentation/php/installing-cometchat/advanced/installing-red5/\nWhich Java Script should I choose for Ubuntu/Linux:\n[root@red5-ubuntu local]# sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre\n[root@red5-ubuntu local]# sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk\n\nI want to install Red5 because I want to use video chat and sreen share with cometchat.\n\nA: To install Red5 run\nsudo apt-get install red5-server\n\nAll needed things (other packages like Java and so on) will be installed automatically.\n", "Q: Steam wont start up on Ubuntu 15.10 I get this error:\nRunning Steam on ubuntu 15.10 64-bit\nSTEAM_RUNTIME is enabled automatically\n[2015-11-23 19:36:32] Startup - updater built Nov  9 2015 18:23:22\nSteamUpdateUI: An X Error occurred\nX Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)\n\nWhen I try to run steam.

THIS WILL CLOSE STEAM! Wait for steam to finish its updating, and soon steam should ACTUALLY open! \nIf steam actually works and opens for you, then you did this all correctly!

Also, if you have a windows recovery partition, you can boot off of that and re-install windows.\nBest of luck!\n", "Q: Can I install ubuntu without windows mac or linux and using a hard disk drive? So my laptop has died. The hard disk was making a weird sound so I bought a new hard disk. Both, old and new hard disk showed me the same error that no operating system was found. I am quite desperate to find a way to check if other parts are spoilt without sending it to service. And one my friends suggested downloading a Linux system to test it out. So can I install Ubuntu without windows, mac or any os, and using a hard disk drive. My laptop is currently only capable of accessing bios. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\nMy laptop was an Acer Aspire series if that helps!\n\nA: Does the error message say something along the lines of \"Reboot and select proper boot device or insert boot media in selected boot device and press a key\"? If so, try flipping your laptop over and popping the battery out for a few minutes, then put it back in and turn it on. I get that error from time to time and that seems to fix it. \nBut to actually answer your question, yes you should be able to. So long as your computer supports booting from a cd or USB, and you've properly formatted it (if you don't know how, you'd need to borrow a friends computer to do this though). Just stick it in, open your BIOS, and prioritize CD or USB, whatever you're using, above everything else. \n", "Q: Installing things as root and accessing those things as normal users I'm new to Ubuntu and am now running 14.04 as a separate partition from Windows. \nTo install things I have to run sudo apt-get because I get permission errors otherwise. As such I use sudo -s to run most of the installation commands. \nThe problem now is that everything that I install as root will not work without root access. Stuff like node, meteor, ipython etc will get errors from accessing various folders. \nThis forces me to use root access for everything, and I am confused as to why this is the case. Am I doing something wrong here?\nEDIT:\nFor example, when trying to run node I get this:\n$ node> node.js:148\n          throw err;\n          ^\n\nError: EACCES: permission denied, open '/home/pewpew/.node_repl_history'\nat Error (native)\n\nRunning stat on /home/pewpew/.node_repl_history, I get:\n ~$ stat /home/pewpew/.node_repl_history \n File: ‘/home/pewpew/.node_repl_history’\n\n\n Size: 6            Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   regular file\nDevice: 808h/2056d  Inode: 1714569     Links: 1\nAccess: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)\nAccess: 2015-11-24 09:39:11.687765710 +0800\nModify: 2015-11-24 10:19:45.959716037 +0800\nChange: 2015-11-24 10:19:45.959716037 +0800\n Birth: -\n\nMeteor gets a similar error when accessing ~/.meteor folder and I used chown to change the owner of the folder to the non-root user.\n\nA: First: use sudo the way it is intended to be used in Ubuntu: for each command that requires it, no more. Don't use sudo to run a command unless it needs to be root. For example, most users would only need sudo for installing things.\nSecond: use sudo -i if you need a root shell. Have a look at this Unix & Linux post to see the effect of various ways of getting a root shell. In particular, sudo -i and sudo su -, both of which provide login shells, give the cleanest environment.\nLastly, take back ownership of your home directory:\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~\n\n~ is a shortcut for your home directory. Use -R so that everything in your home directory is chowned back to you.\n", "Q: Getting  +  to delete words in gnome-terminal and vim insert mode It seems like ctrl + W deletes backwards one word at a time. That's great, but I'd really really like that this works with ctrl + backspace like most other apps.\nWhat's the best way to do this? I'd need the change to affect gnome-terminal commands, command line vim and GUI vim.\n\nA: Use Alt+Backspace instead: it works just like Ctrl+Backspace and doesn't require any configuration.\n\nA: Up until very recently, gnome-terminal emitted the same code on Backspace and Ctrl+Backspace, hence you cannot distinguish the two in your application.\nThis was fixed in vte-0.42, which is part of Gnome 3.18 released this autumn.\nIf you're using Wily, you can find updated packages in Gnome3 Staging.\n\nA: [ for gnome-terminal ]\nuse stty tool, good for visualzing what bash keyboard shortcuts are binded.\nsee your current bash keyboard shortcuts (my system output):\nstty -a\n\nmy output:\nspeed 38400 baud; rows 41; columns 76; line = 0;\nintr = ^C; quit = ^\\; erase = ^?; kill = ^U; eof = ^D; eol = <undef>;\neol2 = <undef>; swtch = <undef>; start = ^Q; stop = ^S; susp = ^Z;\nrprnt = ^R; werase = ^W; lnext = ^V; discard = ^O; min = 1; time = 0;\n-parenb -parodd -cmspar cs8 -hupcl -cstopb cread -clocal -crtscts\n-ignbrk -brkint -ignpar -parmrk -inpck -istrip -inlcr -igncr icrnl ixon\n-ixoff -iuclc -ixany -imaxbel iutf8\nopost -olcuc -ocrnl onlcr -onocr -onlret -ofill -ofdel nl0 cr0 tab0 bs0 vt0\nff0\nisig icanon iexten echo echoe echok -echonl -noflsh -xcase -tostop -echoprt\nechoctl echoke -flusho -extproc\n\nwerase is responsbile for deleting an entire word.\nrunning this will set ctrl + backspace to erase a word when pressed.\nstty werase \\^H\n\n!note: this will set this option only to your current terminal/bash session. in order to apply this permanently you need to add previous command to .bashrc file at the end of it.\nsettings from .bashrc will be loaded every time you open gnome-terminal.\nafter this you are ready to go. enjoy.\n[ for vim and neovim ]\njust paste this in init.vim or vim.rc:\n\" Map Ctrl-Backspace to delete the previous word in insert mode.\n\" solution: https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Map_Ctrl-Backspace_to_delete_previous_word\nnoremap! <C-BS> <C-w>\nnoremap! <C-h> <C-w>\n\nthis will work in insert mode, ofc. thats the main point of defining this, for insert mode.\nworks in neovim 0.5 and lower versions and also in standard vim.\n\nA: Note that this will work in the terminal and the default emacs mode (which you are using if Ctrl+W deletes the previous word for you). It will not work in bash's vi mode and will not affect vi/vim itself. This is, therefore, only a partial answer but the best this emacs user can offer. \n\nThis sort of thing is managed by the readline library whose behavior can be controlled via ~/.inputrc. Edit (or create, if it doesn't exist) ~/.inputrc and add this line:\n\"\\C-H\":\"\\C-W\"\n\nNow, open a new terminal and it should work.\nExplanation\nThe \\C-H is actually Control+BackSpace. You can see keycodes by pressing Ctrl+V then, the key you are after. You will see that BackSpace returns ^H. \nNow, it should be possible to bind Control+BackSpace to the bash function that deletes the previous word (backward-kill-word or unix-word-rubout) by using \"\\C-H\": backward-kill-word. However, I can't get that to work. It works perfectly well with different keys (\"\\C-E\": backward-kill-word, for example, makes Ctrl+E delete the previous word) but for some reason, I can't get it to work with BackSpace.\nSo, as a workaround, we just map Ctrl+Backspace to Ctrl+W which is already mapped to backward-kill-word. So, when you press Ctrl+Backspace, that will be translated to Ctrl+W which, in turn, will send backward-kill-word. I got the idea for this workaround from this SU post. \n\nA: It works on my machine. Just make sure you use tmux from master and nvim from linuxbrew and control+backspace works in bash and vim too!\n(Get bash from linuxbrew too)\n", "Q: /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lX11 https://github.com/laazyboy13/linux-csgo-external/issues/6\nHow do I get it to find libx11-dev?\nwilliam@william-elementarylinux:~/csgohack$ make\nLinking CXX executable build/csgo_external\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lX11\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\nmake[2]: *** [build/csgo_external] Error 1\nmake[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/csgo_external.dir/all] Error 2\nmake: *** [all] Error 2\nwilliam@william-elementarylinux:~/csgohack$ ld -lX11 --verbose\nGNU ld (GNU Binutils for Ubuntu) 2.24\n  Supported emulations:\n   elf_x86_64\n   elf32_x86_64\n   elf_i386\n   i386linux\n   elf_l1om\n   elf_k1om\n   i386pep\n   i386pe\nusing internal linker script:\n==================================================\n/* Script for -z combreloc: combine and sort reloc sections */\nOUTPUT_FORMAT(\"elf64-x86-64\", \"elf64-x86-64\",\n          \"elf64-x86-64\")\nOUTPUT_ARCH(i386:x86-64)\nENTRY(_start)\nSEARCH_DIR(\"/usr/x86_64-linux-gnu/lib64\"); SEARCH_DIR(\"=/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu\"); SEARCH_DIR(\"=/usr/local/lib64\"); SEARCH_DIR(\"=/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu\"); SEARCH_DIR(\"=/lib64\"); SEARCH_DIR(\"=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu\"); SEARCH_DIR(\"=/usr/lib64\"); SEARCH_DIR(\"=/usr/local/lib\"); SEARCH_DIR(\"=/lib\"); SEARCH_DIR(\"=/usr/lib\");\nSECTIONS\n{\n  /* Read-only sections, merged into text segment: */\n  PROVIDE (__executable_start = SEGMENT_START(\"text-segment\", 0x400000)); . = SEGMENT_START(\"text-segment\", 0x400000) + SIZEOF_HEADERS;\n  .interp         : { *(.interp) }\n  .note.gnu.build-id : { *(.note.gnu.build-id) }\n  .hash           : { *(.hash) }\n  .gnu.hash       : { *(.gnu.hash) }\n  .dynsym         : { *(.dynsym) }\n  .dynstr         : { *(.dynstr) }\n  .gnu.version    : { *(.gnu.version) }\n  .gnu.version_d  : { *(.gnu.version_d) }\n  .gnu.version_r  : { *(.gnu.version_r) }\n  .rela.dyn       :\n    {\n      *(.rela.init)\n      *(.rela.text .rela.text.* .rela.gnu.linkonce.t.*)\n      *(.rela.fini)\n      *(.rela.rodata .rela.rodata.* .rela.gnu.linkonce.r.*)\n      *(.rela.data .rela.data.* .rela.gnu.linkonce.d.*)\n      *(.rela.tdata .rela.tdata.* .rela.gnu.linkonce.td.*)\n      *(.rela.tbss .rela.tbss.* .rela.gnu.linkonce.tb.*)\n      *(.rela.ctors)\n      *(.rela.dtors)\n      *(.rela.got)\n      *(.rela.bss .rela.bss.* .rela.gnu.linkonce.b.*)\n      *(.rela.ldata .rela.ldata.* .rela.gnu.linkonce.l.*)\n      *(.rela.lbss .rela.lbss.* .rela.gnu.linkonce.lb.*)\n      *(.rela.lrodata .rela.lrodata.* .rela.gnu.linkonce.lr.*)\n      *(.rela.ifunc)\n    }\n  .rela.plt       :\n    {\n      *(.rela.plt)\n      PROVIDE_HIDDEN (__rela_iplt_start = .);\n      *(.rela.iplt)\n      PROVIDE_HIDDEN (__rela_iplt_end = .);\n    }\n  .init           :\n  {\n    KEEP (*(SORT_NONE(.init)))\n  }\n  .plt            : { *(.plt) *(.iplt) }\n  .text           :\n  {\n    *(.text.unlikely .text.*_unlikely .text.unlikely.*)\n    *(.text.exit .text.exit.*)\n    *(.text.startup .text.startup.*)\n    *(.text.hot .text.hot.*)\n    *(.text .stub .text.* .gnu.linkonce.t.*)\n    /* .gnu.warning sections are handled specially by elf32.em.  */\n    *(.gnu.warning)\n  }\n  .fini           :\n  {\n    KEEP (*(SORT_NONE(.fini)))\n  }\n  PROVIDE (__etext = .);\n  PROVIDE (_etext = .);\n  PROVIDE (etext = .);\n  .rodata         : { *(.rodata .rodata.* .gnu.linkonce.r.*) }\n  .rodata1        : { *(.rodata1) }\n  .eh_frame_hdr : { *(.eh_frame_hdr) }\n  .eh_frame       : ONLY_IF_RO { KEEP (*(.eh_frame)) }\n  .gcc_except_table   : ONLY_IF_RO { *(.gcc_except_table\n  .gcc_except_table.*) }\n  /* These sections are generated by the Sun/Oracle C++ compiler.  */\n  .exception_ranges   : ONLY_IF_RO { *(.exception_ranges\n  .exception_ranges*) }\n  /* Adjust the address for the data segment.

If any system specs are needed I will try my best to provide these.\n\nSo, I have the (bad) habit of falling asleep while looking at cartoons. \nI unplug the power supply to the laptop and move it to my bedroom. The problem is, that it usually runs out of power completely (sometimes after going to sleep, sometimes without it) and when I plug it back in it seems to be stuck on an empty X Window instance (similar to what you get when you press Alt+Ctrl+F8), the underscore doesn't blink, instead it's stuck. \nIf I try Alt+Left to switch to another X Window, it doesn't work, neither does Alt+Ctrl+any function button. \nUsually I shut it down from the button at this point because it's totally unresponsive.\n1.) Is there any danger for my PC as a result of my actions?\n2.) Is there any way to avoid this issue\n3.) If this issue pops up again, is there any way to solve it cleanly, without powering down?\n\nA: It can't still be powered on if it ran out of battery [ubuntu would not be on the screen. It would be pure black darkness]; If it ran out of battery it would be booting back up into ubuntu after you turned it back on after you plugged it in.\n...So that makes no sense at all. Apparently, it can't be out of battery and is just in a frozen state. Why its freezing is something else and you would need to learn what's causing it to learn how to fix it.\nAt least on mine, when it runs critically low on battery Ubuntu shutsdown automatically. Then it needs to be turned on again. There's nothing unsafe about that.\nAs long as the hard drive isn't active, the head is parked, it shouldn't hurt it. Everything else really is motionless. I have no problem with forcing a locked pc or laptop down if its necessary cause what else to do? Throw it?

I've tried them 5 times only to have to cancel wget because it tried to download the entire domain instead of the projects folder.

I have a free partition that I want to install Ubuntu to but only /sda shows up as an whole block in the installer.\n\nA: This problem has nothing to do with partition alignment (although there may be alignment problems, too). Basically, the problem is that two primary partitions (/dev/sda2 and /dev/sda3) reside inside the extended partition (/dev/sda4). This is illegal. This problem can be fixed by my FixParts program, which is part of the Ubuntu gdisk package; but proper identification of what each of those partitions does is necessary before proceeding. In particular, boot partitions should not become logical partitions.\n", "Q: Ubuntu V14.04 login problem? I have Ubuntu 14.04 operating system.

I used to use full-screen consoles (those opened with Ctrl+Alt+F1...F6) actively and have come to an idea that I would like to try decorating it with a \"wallpaper\" of a sort (a rather dark and monotonous one of course so that it wouldn't decrease readability), perhaps this could look and feel nice (or not, but I need to try). It would even better if I could set different pictures as different console's background (one for Ctrl+Alt+F1, another for Ctrl+Alt+F2 etc).\nThe fact the consoles have much higher resolution that pure text mode provides suggests that full-fledged graphical mode is used for them and everything is possible. But how?\n\nA: Although Foogod's answer didn't work for me, it did lead me into the right direction, by providing half of the solution (namely, reading framebuffer data, while fbi is showing an image on TTY screen). Therefore I've awarded his answer the bounty.\nBellow is a script that makes it easy to launch fbterm with partial path to image as a single command line argument\nUsage\nScript must be saved in a directory that is listed in your $PATH variable. Preferably it must be in your personal $HOME/bin folder. Refer to How to add a directory to the PATH? on explanation how to add your personal bin to $PATH, but creating a directory called bin in your home directory is sufficient to add it to PATH on re-login.\nThe script also must have executable permission; you can set it with chmod +x /path/to/script.sh.\nFinally, it must be ran with sudo, to allow root access for reading and writing to /dev/fb0.\nScript Source\nAlso available on my Github repository.\n#!/bin/bash\n# Author : Serg Kolo\n# Date: Dec 5, 2015\n# Description: Script to render image and set it as background\n# in conjunction with fbterm\n# Depends: fbterm,fbi, awk\n# Written for: https://askubuntu.com/q/701874/295286\n\nfunction printUsage\n{\n  echo \"<<< Script to set background image in TTY console\"\n  echo \"<<< Written by Serg Kolo, Dec 5 , 2015\"\n  echo \"<<< Usage: scriptName.sh /path/to/image\"\n  echo \"<<< Must be ran with root privileges, in TTY only\"\n  echo \"exiting\"\n\n}\n\n# check if we're root, if there's at least one ARG, and it is a TTY\n\nif [ \"$(whoami)\" != \"root\"   ] || [ \"$#\" -eq 0  ] ||  [ \"$( tty | awk '{gsub(/[[:digit:]]/,\"\"); gsub(/\\/dev\\//,\"\");print}' )\" != \"tty\"  ] ;then\n\n   printUsage\n   exit 1\nfi\n\n\n\n# read the full path of the image\n\nIMAGE=\"$( readlink -f \"$@\" )\"\n\n# Launch fbi with whatever image was supplied as command line arg\n# then take out whatever is the data in framebuffer;\n# Store that data to /tmp folder\n\n( sleep 1; cat /dev/fb0 > /tmp/BACKGROUND.fbimg ; sleep 1; pkill fbi ) & fbi -t 2 -1 --noverbose -a  \"$IMAGE\"\n\n# This portion is really optional; you can comment it out \n# if you choose so\n\necho \"LAUNCH FBTERM ?(y/n)\"\nread ANSWER\n\nif [ \"$ANSWER\" != \"y\"  ] ; then\n   echo exiting\n   exit 1\nfi\n\n# The man page states that fbterm takes screenshot of \n# what is currently in framebuffer and sets it as background\n# if FBTERM_BACKGROUND_IMAGE is set to 1\n# Therefore the trick is to send the framebuffer data captured\n# in the last step (which will display the image on screen)\n# and then launch fbterm. Note, that I send output from the command\n# send to background in order to avoid the extra text displayed on \n# screen. That way we have clear image in framebuffer, without \n# the shell text, when we launch fbterm\n\nexport FBTERM_BACKGROUND_IMAGE=1 \nclear\n( cat /tmp/BACKGROUND.fbimg  > /dev/fb0 &) > /dev/null; sleep 0.25; fbterm \n\nAdditional info\nIt turns out that user doesn't necessarily need to use sudo; /dev/fb0 belongs to video group, so users could just add themselves to that group using\nsudo usermod -a -G video $USER\n\nThus, the checks for root in the above script become obsolete, specifically [ \"$(whoami)\" != \"root\"   ] || part.\n\nA: I'm pretty sure that the Linux console driver does not have this ability built in, however there is an application called fbterm which can do this.  In order to make background images work, you will also need a utility which can display an image on the framebuffer such as fbi:\nsudo apt-get install fbterm fbi\n\nfbterm does not actually read or display background images itself, it expects some other program to set up the background image on the screen before it starts. There are instructions in the fbterm man page on how to do this using fbv, an absolutely antiquated and unsupported utility I couldn't even get to compile on a modern Ubuntu system. fbi is a much cleaner and nicer image viewer for the framebuffer, but unfortunately does not have the \"set it and exit\" functionality of the simpler fbv, and thus interferes with fbterm if you try to use it directly.  However, I was able to come up with an alternative which works:\nFirst, you will need to use fbi and cat to display the image you want and then dump it to a \"framebuffer raw format\" image file.  As root, in a framebuffer console, run:\n( sleep 1; cat /dev/fb0 > nifty-background.fbimg ) & fbi -t 2 -1 --noverbose -a nifty-background.png\n\n(This will display the image for a couple of seconds and then exit, having saved the result in the file nifty-background.fbimg.  Replace nifty-background.fbimg and nifty-background.png with whatever filenames you wish, of course.)\nThe first part of the command waits for 1 second before catting the framebuffer contents to a file. At the same time, the second part (after the &) launches fbi to display the image on the framebuffer, so that when the cat command gets around to executing (1 second later), there's an image there to dump. The reason they're in that order is because I found that fbi had issues if it wasn't running in the foreground, which means it has to be the last command in the list.\nFrom then on, whenever you want to run fbterm, you can start it like so (you may want to create a little wrapper script):\nexport FBTERM_BACKGROUND_IMAGE=1\ncat nifty-background.fbimg > /dev/fb0; fbterm\n\n\nA: \nI can distinguish real text mode from its graphical emulation.\n\n… which is one of the ways in which the observant could distinguish a real BSOD on Windows from the actions of the joke BSOD screen-saver that did the rounds a decade or so ago.  The display of block graphics characters using the display adapter hardware in graphics mode was subtly different from the characters generated by the display adapter hardware in text mode.\nYes, the display adapter is in graphics mode.  It has been this way for quite some while, now.  It was always this way on systems without PC display adapter hardware.  In the early years of Linux, on PC compatibles the console would have the display adapter hardware in text mode.  But this use has quietly eroded to pretty much nothing.  Unicode support for most users nowadays requires a bigger glyph set than the text-mode hardware has.  The machine firmware (of course) uses graphics mode for splash screens (with pretty pictures and company logos), as does the Linux loader and system initialization.\nThere's a terminal emulator program built into the Linux kernel. It's layered on top of the framebuffer and the input event subsystem, which it uses internal kernel interfaces to access. It presents itself to application-mode systems as a series of kernel virtual terminal devices, /dev/tty1 and so forth.\nThis program is fairly limited compared to terminal emulators that run outwith the Linux kernel, as ordinary applications programs.  It only emulates a limited subset of a real terminal's functionality, and it lacks the added features of the latter terminal emulators.\nIt is those that you need to look to for this.  You may be familiar with the terminal emulators that use X for their input/output, such as xterm, lxterminal, gnome-console, konsole, eterm, wterm, and the rest.  Less well known are the ones that use the framebuffer device(s) and the input event devices for their input/output. providing user-space virtual terminals: \n\n\n*\n\n*zhcon (Ubuntu package), \n\n*fbpad, \n\n*fbterm (Ubuntu package) and its forks such as jfbterm (Ubuntu package), \n\n*bogl-bterm (Ubuntu package), \n\n*the nosh console-terminal-emulator and console-fb-realizer, and \n\n*kmscon.\n\n\nSome of these latter can do what you want.  \nfbterm can be configured to use whatever is in the framebuffer at startup as a background image, for example.  So all that one needs to do is use one of the several other utilities for displaying images directly to a Linux framebuffer deviceto set up a background image before running fbterm.  There are several such tools, including:\n\n\n*\n\n*dfbg (Ubuntu package), \n\n*Ali Gholami Rudi's fbvis, and \n\n*fbi (Ubuntu package).  \n\n\nfbvis and fbi clear the screen at exit, and require the convolutions that are explained in more detail in Foogod's answer.  dfbg, though, doesn't clean up after itself, making it more suitable for this particular task.\nFurther reading\n\n\n*\n\n*https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/177209/5132\n\n*https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/178807/5132\n\n*https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/194218/5132\n\n*Jonathan de Boyne Pollard (2015). \"user-space virtual terminals\".  nosh Guide.  1.20.  nosh.

The problem seems to be your CPU governor. This controls how the CPU behaves. Your options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Performance keeps the CPU at the highest possible frequency\n\n*Powersave keeps the CPU at the lowest possible frequency\n\n*Userspace exports the available frequency information to the user level (through the /sys file system) \n          and permits user-space control of the CPU frequency\n\n*Ondemand scales the CPU frequencies according to the CPU usage (like does the userspace frequency scaling \n         daemons, but in kernel)\n\n*Conservative acts like the ondemand but increases frequency step by step\n\n\nYou have it set to powersave so it's throttling the CPU in an effort to consume as little power as possible. Setting it to pretty much anything else will improve your performance. I recommend you use ondemand which gives the most flexible option, high speed when needed and low when not so as to not waste energy. \nRun this command to change the governor to ondemand:\necho \"ondemand\" | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor\n\n\nNOTE @CharlesGreen points out in the comments that you might only have powersave and performance available.

If bought from a trusted source it would be very unlikely that the installation would include malware, possibly even more unlikely than the typical Windows installation, but there is nothing that would make it impossible, and you only need to look at the examples from Lenovo and Dell to see how that might happen.\nAs for whether you need to worry, you can judge for yourself.  Wiping and reinstalling from an official Ubuntu installer might quell some fears, though you will lose any OEM-specific customisation or extra functionality.\nI can't answer your question about whether Ubuntu/Canonical try to police any changes to root certificate stores on OEM's derived installations, but I can't see how that would be feasible to do comprehensively enough.\n\nA: There is a simple way to check https://dellrootcheck.detectify.com on your pre-installed Ubuntu system.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server randomly becoming inaccessible and comes back if I reboot modem My Ubuntu Server is 14.04.03 amd64 with 3.19.0-33-generic kernel, running on an old laptop and connecting internet via wifi.\nI have no solution for this issue as I don't know what to do with it.

For example, how reply quoting is made in gmail and usual emails? Which formatting is used for that, flattext and \">\" at the beginning of every line?\nHow to use mail lists?\n\nA: Installing mutt pulls in a Message Transport Agent, because mutt by itself can only (on today's internet) talk to your local MTA.  If you prefer a different MTA than Postfix, you can choose Exim or Sendmail (for example) instead, but I recommend you stay with Postfix.\nFor your scenario, it sounds like you would want to define Gmail as your smarthost (where Postfix sends all outgoing mail for further delivery).  Another popular model is to use your ISP's smarthost.\nSMTP (not MSTP) is the protocol which mutt uses to submit an email message to Postfix, and which Postfix uses to talk to other mail servers.\nfetchmail is a popular tool for pulling down email from a remote account (such as Gmail) to a local set of mail folders.  It used to be popular for people who had intermittent Internet access through a metered connection; it still makes sense if for some reason you want your email to be stored in local files (perhaps because you want to process them programmatically, and can't run stuff over IMAP, or locally on a remote mail server).\n\nA: If you interested in going 'old school' perhaps (and don't want to use IMAP)  have a look at this Ubuntu Wiki guide:\nMutt And Gmail\nand this will give you some copy and paste instructions that only require minor editing to get you sending and receiving from Gmail.\n", "Q: Removing unwanted rows from csv file having more than 10 patterns to be matched I have a CSV file which has 2 columns and i have to match values in a single in row in both the column , if it matches the criteria we have to keep the column otherwise delete the entire row.

The man page for service says that it removes most environment variables. So I'm guessing that calling su depends on the environment somehow.\n\nA: The problem was that the user mule didn't have a shell. It was set to /bin/false.\nThe -m flag for su preserves the environment, so when I called sudo /etc/init.d/mule start the SHELL environment variable was set and passed down to su.\nBut when calling sudo service mule start the environment is cleaned. From service man page:\n\nservice runs a System V init script or upstart job in as predictable an environment as possible, removing most environment variables and with the current working directory set to /.\n\nTherefore the environment does not contain a SHELL variable and the user mule does not have a shell as well. So no command is executed it seems.\n", "Q: Power Outtage - Kubuntu 15.10 Can Kubuntu 15.10 normally recover from a mains power failure? \nComputer will not boot normally - always goes to Emergency Mode.\nIn the emergency mode i tried the options there - no result.\nSolved.\n\n\n*\n\n*In the end, it was very simple! The monitor is very bad, so the text cmds. on the emergency screen was not what i saw. \n\n\nI was able after this to get the log, and delete the file stopping the normal boot.\n\nA: Sure, but it depends what you mean by recover.\nThe ability of a computer to recover on any operating system depends on the following things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resilient hardware. Power failures are indicative of poor power networks. These can otherwise fry cheap and bad components. If you get a power spike post-cut (as is very common) your computers might suffer hardware failure.\n\n*Is BIOS set to turn back on after a power cut?\n\n*Disk integrity. Are your partitions using journalled write buffers? Are RAID cards using battery backed write buffers?\n\n*Are you applications saving stuff automatically?\nSo we can look at software and I'd certainly make sure things you use a lot are doing autosaves, but if you're in a situation where failure is likely, I'd seriously recommend sticking a battery between the computer and the grid.\nYou can configure Ubuntu to suspend on power failure. For most desktops this means you can get many hours of suspend. That's usually enough to get you through all but the worst power cuts and if that looks likely, you might have enough power to resume and save what you need.\n", "Q: Installing/Uninstalling via .run this question is more of the understanding of .run installation, when you download a file and use .run to install it, does it actually interact with Linux's package manager, or does it work just like a portable program, where once you delete the installation path, it's gone?\nFor example, if I download Qt Creator which has a .run file, and I install it in Documents/Qt, does that mean it's installed in that path and once I delete that folder it's gone from my system?\n\nA: .run files are simply executable files that contain a program's installation instructions.\nPackage managers can't track where the program's files are installed, so it's not really possible to uninstall the program. \nThe only way you can uninstall a program that uses a .run installer is if it provides an uninstaller. This is why programs that use .run installers are not recommended...\n\nA: It can interact with the package manager. It can do anything. They're just scripts. What they actually do depends on the people who write them. It is very possible that they build themselves a fake package to aid removal.\nI have had some installers do this. I honestly can't remember which they were but they built themselves little meta-packages to aid removal.\nThese were system-installed though. I think it's very unlikely that a home-installed application is going to request to elevate to root permissions to do the same though.\n", "Q: Is it possible to have four equally sized windows on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS? It is common to have two equally separated windows by either dragging each window to one side of the screen or Ctrl+Super+←/→, but I want to divide my screen into four quarters.\nI have encounterd many situations in which I had to switch windows between three or four. It would be sometimes easier to debug any code if I could have a screen with four equally divided windows so that I could see the entire system with one look.\n\nA: It is possible, as you can see from this example with four gnome-terminal windows:\n\nI did not manually resize and position the windows, which I could have done, but just dragged them into the corners of the screen to format them automatically. It's the same procedure as you described with placing a window into the left or right half by dragging it to the respective border of the screen. There are also custom keyboard short-cuts to achieve this.\nYou can set up whichever method you prefer or both.\nHowever, the corners are by default configured the same way as the side borders and the short-cuts are probably disabled, so we have to change these settings. \nTherefore we need the CompizConfig Settings Manager .\nYou can also install it from the terminal with the command below:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nAfter that, launch ccsm.\nNavigate to the category Window Management and select the Grid plug-in. Go to the Corners / Edges tab and you should see the following settings:\n\nSet all corner options according to my example above, so that when you drag a window e.g. into the upper left corner, it will get resized and placed into the top left quarter of the screen.  \nYou can also set up keyboard short-cuts to place windows into the grid. Switch to the Bindings tab and select the short-cut key combinations you prefer. I opted for Ctrl+Alt+NumPad 1-9 to put the windows into the respective screen halves or corners. See my example below:\n\nAll your changes take effect immediately, so just close the ccsm window.\nNow you can start dragging windows into the corners:\n\n\nA: Use ShellTile to get equally sized windows on Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS (Bionic Beaver).\n\n\nA: There is a little application called x-tile that can organize windows in several different ways, including the way you want (tile all quad). Make sure to manually install python-appindicator (missing depency -- filed a bug for it).\n\nA: All the described solutions do not work with Ubuntu 18 and up except ShellTile. \nYou can use the gTile gnome extension. This is my preferred solution which has more features. These are the default shortcuts:\n\nRead the github page for more shortcuts and settings.\n\nA: You can do this as well with the Unity Tweak Tool.\nInstall it with the terminal command below or by clicking here: unity-tweak-tool \nsudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool -y\n\nOnce you installed this tool, open it and go to Window Snapping and then you can configure the window snapping on Ubuntu.\n\n\nA: \nThe generic keyboard settings dialogue allows shortcuts to be set for view split on left or right.\nAdditional shortcuts can be added with the + button, although I do not know what the commands would be.\n", "Q: copy files by date How can I copy files in a folder based on when the file was last edited? Lets say I want to copy all my files that I last edited today from c: to my folder bak. How can I achieve that?\nI know that a regular copy command can be done like this: \ncp source destination\n\neg.\ncp *.c bak\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Using find, the files (and only the files) modified in the last day are found by: \nfind . -type f -mtime 1 \n\nso you can copy them with \nfind . -type f -mtime 1  -exec cp {} bak/ \\; \n\nMeaning: find all entities under the current directory (.), of type \"file\" (-type f), modified at least 1 day from now (-mtime 1, but it's subtle, follow the link to learn more), and for each one of them execute the command cp followed by the name of the file that match the previous conditions and by a literal bak/ --- in the exec clause, the closing semicolon (escaped to avoid the shell eating it) closes the command and additionally means that the command is to be executed once for every match.  \nNotice that the directory tree will be flattened in the bak/ folder, so maybe using an archive format would be better. \nFor example, this is my script that makes a backup of all files in my working directories modified today and since two days in tar files and then move them to my Dropbox directory: \n#! /bin/zsh \n#\ncd $HOME\ntoday=\"today-$(hostname)\".tar\ntwodays=\"twodays-$(hostname)\".tar\nmydirs=(bin Documents Templates texmf Desktop) # list your top-level working dirs here  \nrm -f $today $twodays\necho -n \"Starting today and twodays backups... \" \nfind $mydirs -type f -mtime -1 -exec tar rf $today {} +\nfind $mydirs -type f -mtime -2 -exec tar rf $twodays {} +\necho \"backups done:\" \nls -lh $today $twodays\necho \"Moving to Dropbox\" \nmv $today $twodays $HOME/Dropbox\nsleep 2\ndropbox status\n\nit needs zsh because I'm lazy and didn't try to adapt to the array structure of bash, but surely someone here can do that (hint, hint)...\n\nA: You can first specify which file that you modified last in your current folder with command\nls -lt\n\nOr, you want to specify which file that you access last with command\nls -ltu\n\nAfter that, you can copy the file with cp command.

Is there any way to specify which ubuntu installation I want to get selections for?\nOr if anyone can think of a better way of backing everything up that would be very helpful too!\n\nA: you might try to chroot into the old partition to do this, but i'm not sure this will work\nmaybe an easier solution is to just copy the downloaded packages from the old installation to a temporary location (eg. using a live image) by doing something like this:\n\ncp -r /mnt/var/cache/apt/archives /temporary_backup_location\n\nand after your new installation is done, you can copy the packages in your new /mnt/var/cache/apt/archives folder\nhope this helps\n", "Q: What to do with a 16gb m.2 disc? I've bought a Lenovo ThinkPad E540 back in 2013. It came with a 512GB hard disk, which I replaced with a 256GB SSD. When I ordered it there was something written about the 512GB hard disk, that it has a SSD cache on top. I never knew what was meant by that, until I opened my laptop yesterday to put in some more RAM. Then I saw, that there's a 16GB m.2 SSD sitting inside my laptop. It is mounted as /dev/sdb as it turns out.\nIs there something useful I can use that m.2 for? As I understand it, m.2 are currently not faster than SATA3, so I don't see a point in installing the OS to the m.2 drive (or is there?).\nIs there anything \"useful\", I can do with it?\nBtw. I found this post: 16GB SSD booster on ubuntu, but I think that doesn't apply to me, since I've got an SSD, not a traditional hard drive\n\nA: Likely the old 16 GB m.2 SSD will not be faster than your new 256 GB SSD you now had installed. Therefore we may not experience any performance boosts from moving the OS, cache, or tmp directories to that drive.\nNevertheless you may find the additional fast storage space useful for many purposes. Just a few examples that just came into my mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*format and use it as /swap space to replace Swap on the precious new drive. It will give you additional space on your main drive, it may not wear out much if you only use part of that drive, and if it dies of age you will still be able to boot your OS.\n\n*use it as a temporary backup directory to save your daily work.\n\n*install another OS for dual-booting from that drive.\n\n*hide it from the desktop to store your secrets there.\n\n\nEven if there was no use case at present it may be good to know that there is an m.2 slot in this laptop where we could install a larger SSD later.\n\nA: Your 16Gb SSD was probably intended for use in Intel Rapid Storage Technology. It caches reads and writes to the hard drive on a (faster but smaller) SSD. It would have worked on Windows 7 that I suppose your laptop originally came with.\nYou could probably tinker with it, find a driver that will work in Ubuntu (Intel provide some documentation) but as your main disk is now SSD, this is no longer worth it. Just see it as some extra space.\n", "Q: Where does NetworkManager store WiFi passwords on Ubuntu 15.10? I had previously learned that NetworkManager stores WiFi passwords in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/<wifi name> file. But in my case on Ubuntu 15.10 I can't find any password in that file.\nI tried this:\nsudo cat /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/cig | grep psk\n[sudo] password for edward: \nkey-mgmt=wpa-psk\npsk-flags=1\n\nhere does NetworkManager store WiFi passwords?\n\nA: The password files are saved in this folder :\n(in case the password is stored for all users)   \n/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections  \n\nExecute this command to show all information :  \nsudo cat /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/YOUR-SSID  \n\nWhen the password is stored for only one user, it is saved in gnome-keyring.\n\nA: You could consider using the nmcli command to update whatever NetworkManager does under the hood.  To show the current password for SSID \"example\":\nnmcli --show-secrets connection show id example | fgrep 802-1x.password\n\nTo update the password for the SSID \"example\" use:\n(IFS='' read -s -r -p '802.1X password '; nmcli connection modify id example 802-1x.password \"$REPLY\")\n\nMost of that command is to prevent the new password being displayed on the terminal, remaining in an environment variable, or being in the shell history.\n\nA: If you choose to only enable your user to use that wifi network, then the wifi password is stored in the gnome keyring of your current user.\nIf you let every one use that wifi connection, the password is stored in the file you mentionned.\nYou can also manually change where that password is stored in network manager settings for that wifi network, security tab, click the hdd+green arrow icon in password field and make your choice.\n\n\nA: If you just want to SEE the passwords and other info and not edit, and you prefer doing things gui style, in a terminal window type:\nsudo nautilus\n\nthen enter password at the prompt and you can navigate with the nautilus file manager to the file and read it.\nDisplaying in the terminal is more straightforward and probably more secure but some WinDOHs converts will prefer the pretty windowsy interface.\n", "Q: File containing a list of all installed software, including dependencies?

A file that is updated every time the a package/dependency is installed.\n\nA: Yes, there is a file.

I have a Bluetooth ThinkPad 2 Tablet keyboard that I want to pair with my Ubuntu Touch Aquaris E4.5. Due to GUI limitations, I want to try to do this in the terminal. I'm hoping that the process'll be similar to that on Ubuntu Desktop.\nOn Ubuntu Desktop 15.10, when pairing the keyboard, the following message is presented in a GUI dialog:\nPlease enter the following PIN on \"ThinkPad keyboard\" and press \"Enter\" on the keyboard:\n<6-digit number>\n\nEntering the 6-digit PIN on the Bluetooth keyboard and pressing Enter completes the pairing of the keyboard and it works fine. When I try to pair the keyboard on Ubuntu Touch, no GUI dialog is presented displaying the code that is to be entered on the Bluetooth keyboard. So, I want to try to pair the keyboard in the terminal.\nI have tried the following:\nphablet@ubuntu-phablet:~$ hcitool scan\nScanning ...\n        AB:CD:EF:GH:IJ:KL       ThinkPad Keyboard\nphablet@ubuntu-phablet:~$ bluez-simple-agent AB:CD:EF:GH:IJ:KL\nRequestPinCode (/org/bluez/863/hci0/dev_AB_CD_EF_GH_IJ_KL)\nEnter PIN Code: 0000\nRelease\nCreating device failed: org.bluez.Error.ConnectionAttemptFailed: Page Timeout\nphablet@ubuntu-phablet:~$\n\nWhat could I try next?\n\nA: You can try running bluetoothctl from the command line, make sure your device is on / ready to be discovered:\n$ bluetoothctl\n[NEW] Controller AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF device-name [default]\n\nAny other bluetooth devices will be listed here.  You'll then be inside a [bluetooth] prompt.\nFirst, turn bluetooth power on (if your device is off):\n[bluetooth]# power on\nChanging power on succeeded\n\nThen, make sure your agent is registered:\n[bluetooth]# agent on\nAgent registered\n\n[bluetooth]# default-agent \nDefault agent request successful\n\nNow you can scan for devices from the console:\n[bluetooth]# scan on\nDiscovery started\n[CHG] Controller AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF Discovering: yes\n[NEW] Device FF:EE:DD:CC:BB:AA Someone's Keyboard\n\nYou can manually pair from here as well:\n[bluetooth]# pair FF:EE:DD:CC:BB:AA \nAttempting to pair with FF:EE:DD:CC:BB:AA \n[CHG] Device C8:E0:EB:04:52:55 Connected: yes\n\nAt this point, you should be prompted to enter a pin code for pairing:    \nRequest PIN code\n[agent] Enter PIN code: 12345\n\nEnter a number (eg. 12345), and you will be prompted to input the same number from the device:\n[Someone's Keyboard]# 12345\n\nYou should then be notified that your keyboard has paired:\n[CHG] Device FF:EE:DD:CC:BB:AA Paired: yes\n\nHopefully this works for you, was trying to solve this for a while before I found any reference to bluetoothctl.\n\nEDIT: The Ubuntu Touch OTA9 release includes Bluez 5, enabling pairing with the ThinkPad keyboards. Here's the little BQ Aquaris E4.5 acting almost as a palmtop.\n\n\nA: Followed the steps by 1nfiniti on Ubuntu 16.04 amd64 and it worked great with Logitech MX5000 keyboard and mouse combo. But when I rebooted the computer, the keyboard didn't type again. It showed as connected but not paired on Bluetooth Settings. However, the mouse worked fine.\nHaving a look at bluetoothctl reference (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/bluetooth#Bluetoothctl) realized that a 'trust' command was used after 'pair' command to allow some devices to successfully reconnect.\nSo I started bluetoothctl, disconnected and unpaired the keyboard, connected and paired it again, and issued\n[bluetooth]# trust [keyboard MAC Address]\n\nThen I was notified that your keyboard has been trusted\nTrusted\n\nAnd that did the trick, now the keyboard connects flawlessly every time I start/restart the computer.\n", "Q: Better install Ubuntu 14.04 before upgrade to Windows 10 or afterwards? I have a laptop with Windows 8.1 and would like to install Ubuntu's latest LTS in dual boot with Windows.\nIs it better to upgrade to Windows 10 first and then install Ubuntu or is it better to install Ubuntu now in dual boot and later upgrade Windows?\n\nA: I recommend to upgrade Windows first, as it will probably check and overwrite the bootloader with its own.\nInstalling Ubuntu will also replace the bootloader, but with GRUB which usually detects all installed systems and allows you to boot each of them. The Windows bootloader however assumes it's the only OS and does not care about anything else.\nTherefore if you install Ubuntu as last step, you will automatically have a (probably working) GRUB bootloader in the end which detects and shows both Windows and Ubuntu.\nIf you upgrade Windows last, you will have the Windows bootloader which doesn't show Ubuntu and you would have to install GRUB again.\n", "Q: How to run the following command in Ubuntu and which path it is referring to? Following is my set of script that I need to run but I am not sure about the path it is referring to ? and should I put the whole script in .sh file and then run, or something else to execute the node project ?\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nredis-server --save \"\" &\nsleep 1\nredis-cli flushall\ncd ~/repos/class-prj/class-prj\nnpm run app.js\n\n\nA: You should modify your script to contain the full path to your redis-server executable and you should avoid cd or at least restore the current working directory afterwards (e.g. using pushd and popd):\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n~/redis-3.0.5/src/redis-server --save \"\" &\nsleep 1\nredis-cli flushall\npushd ~/repos/class-prj/class-prj\nnpm run app.js\npopd\n\nYou can save this script in a file with any name, the file extension is irrelevant and can also be omitted. What is important is to make it executable for your user instead:\nchmod u+x /PATH/TO/SCRIPT\n\nNow you may run the script by simply entering its full absolute path or its relative path. That means you have to write ./SCRIPT as relative path if it's in the current directory!\n", "Q: How to execute commands in gnuplot using shell script? What I want to do is write a script which first launches a program and then tells it to execute a bunch of commands and then quit. Lets go with an example.\nI wrote this script myscript.sh and it doesn't work the way I want it to. What it does is just run gnuplot and wait for it to quit and then runs the other commands; which obviously produces errors.\n#!/bin/bash\ngnuplot\nplot sin(x)\npause -1\nquit\n\nI guess it is clear what I'm trying to do; if not, then let me know in the comments.\n\nA: As explained in the man pages, gnuplot expects input from a command file in what is called an batch session. You can e.g. write the line plot sin(x) to a file myplot and then execute gnuplot myplot. \nIf you omit the command file, as your script does, you will get an interactive session.\n\nA: One way is with -persist:  \n#!/usr/bin/gnuplot -persist\nset title \"Walt pedometer\" font \",14\" textcolor rgbcolor \"royalblue\"\nset timefmt \"%y/%m/%d\"\nset xdata time\nset pointsize 1\nset terminal wxt  enhanced title \"Walt's steps \" persist raise\nplot \"/home/walt/var/Pedometer\" using 1:2 with linespoints\n\nanother way, if you need to preprocess data, is with a Bash Here Document (see man bash):  \n#!/bin/bash\nminval=0    # the result of some (omitted) calculation\nmaxval=4219   # ditto\ngnuplot -persist <<-EOFMarker\n    set title \"Walt pedometer\" font \",14\" textcolor rgbcolor \"royalblue\"\n    set timefmt \"%y/%m/%d\"\n    set yrange $minval:$maxval\n    set xdata time\n    set pointsize 1\n    set terminal wxt  enhanced title \"Walt's steps \" persist raise\n    plot \"/home/walt/var/Pedometer\" using 1:2 with linespoints\nEOFMarker\n# rest of script, after gnuplot exits\n\n\nA: From man gnuplot or its online manpage:\n   -p,  --persist  lets  plot  windows  survive after main gnuplot program\n   exits.\n\n   -e \"command list\" executes the requested commands  before  loading  the\n   next input file.\n\nSo what you probably want to run is the following command:\ngnuplot -e \"plot sin(x); pause -1\"\n\n\nOther variants I proposed but which are not that useful were:\n\ngnuplot -p -e \"plot sin(x); pause -1\"\ngnuplot -e \"plot sin(x)\"\ngnuplot -p -e \"plot sin(x)\"\n\n\n\nA: This might help\n{#set terminal postfile             \n{#set output  \"d1_plot.ps\"        \nset title \"Energy vs. Time for Sample Data\"    \nset xlabel \"Time\"    \nset ylabel \"Energy\"    \nplot \"d1.dat\" with lines   \npause -1 \"Hit Enter to continue\"\n\nclick here for more details\n\nA: The here-doc method mentioned is highly useful with Gnuplot and with many other programs as well. By using shell variables within the Gnuplot commands in the here-doc, you can parameterize your plots with inputs from your shell script's command line.  By cagily setting things up, you can mass-produce plots from vast troves of \"big data.\" I used to produce consistent-looking scatter plots with 20,000 to 80,000 points PER PLOT in hundreds of structural dynamics finite analysis runs using exactly this method. It's a very powerful method.\n\nA: gnuplot myscript.sh -\nThe trick is to put a dash '-' at the end of the command line.\nIt will leave the interactive gnuplot command alive.

I have an Ubuntu Server 14.04. \nIs possible to install VirtualBox in this Ubuntu Server just using a command, without GUI?\n\nA: VirtualBox can be installed on the command line, directly from the Ubuntu repositories. This will install VirtualBox version 4.3.10:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nTo update your package management system to use the most current packages.\nFollowed by:\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox\n\nTo install the main package and its dependencies.\nAfter that I'd recommend getting the VirtualBox guest additions iso, with:\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso\n\nThe guest additions are required to ensure smooth running of your guest OS, when you build virtual machines.\nIt is normally necessary to obtain a VirtualBox extension pack to use all of the features of virtualbox, here is the virtualbox old builds download page, the file is located under version 4.3.10 - Extension Packs - All Platforms. Alternatively the direct download link is here.\n\nA: You can install VirtualBox using apt-get, without a GUI:\nsudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install virtualbox\n\nFrom there, you will need to read the VirtualBox manuals for command-line instructions.

At first, I thought it was an issue with the dongle not being compatible with Ubuntu. But when I tried it out after a month with another SIM card, it connected.

Like KolourPaint, for example.\n\nA: OK, I've solved the problem myself by removing .kde folder. Yes, it's full solution.\n\nA: Maybe you had NVidia or AMD drivers installed manually? You would need to reinstall them now. When I once updated my system Xorg stopped working, and I had to reinstall NVidia drivers (the same way, i.e. manually, i.e. by NVidia's installer).

Period. \nWhen the operating system is broken 99% of the time it should be possible to fix any problem if the problem is software related. Either from the grub rescue prompt or from a live session. The problem though is what to fix and how long it takes to find the problem, diagnose is and fix it. My system I can re-install within 19 minutes so if I do not have the time to do track it down I might opt to re-install myself. \njournalctl -xb is the key here.

It assumes it is the only application accessing your ciphertexts and runs into undefined behavior when some other application (say your Dropbox client) modifies them.\nEncFS also has its problems as explained here.\nYou might want to take a look at CryFS https://www.cryfs.org\n\nA: You may want to use EncFS and it's --reverse option. Here's a quote from it's man page:\n   --reverse\n       Normally EncFS provides a plaintext view of data on demand.  Nor‐\n       mally it stores enciphered data and displays plaintext data.

How to save wifi configuration, while reinstalling Ubuntu I've tried Ubuntu and was pleasantly surprised that it is so much better now. I had only two problems to solve upfront. I had no wireless and only the nouveau video drivers. I've installed (Thanks to some help) the wifi drivers and even tried to install nvidia. I ended up with working wireless, but no X. I've made a backup too late, so I now have a clonezilla  img of a disk with working wi-fi, but no graphics.

Unfortunately, I have Windows 8.1 installed and I don't want to uninstall it because I still want to use it for gaming. \nAlso, because I have a motherboard made for gaming (gigabyte ga-z97x-gaming), it is making it extremely difficult to disable secure boot. That is why, it is very difficult for me to dual boot Ubuntu 14.04 with Windows 8.1. \nHowever, I read that Ubuntu 15.10 solves this problem. \nWhat I am afraid of is this: \nDoes Ubuntu 15.10 have enough bugs to make it inappropriate for a beginner like me? \nDoes Ubuntu 15.10 introduce new security bugs that make it a bit unsafe for daily usage? \nThank you for any and all answers. :)\n\nA: *\n\n*No. (BTW bugs are not intentional features.) Only when using a beta version should you expect major problems. \n\n\nWhat you really should be looking for is whether or not your hardware works with Ubuntu. Check that upfront by looking online or by using the Live feature of the installer. Most hardware is fine with Linux, however, and the main problem is generally graphics. AMD and NVIDIA are usually fine (although NVIDIA does cause problems). Other graphics cards are a hit or miss. SIS (if those are still around) is crap. \nAnother thing to worry about is what WiFi card you have. If you have one and it's Broadcom, take a look here. You need to be somewhat comfortable with a command line to follow it. \nPrinters: HP is good. Most others are problematic if they're newer models (In general Linux works better on hardware that was released a while ago since some volunteer needs to add it to the hardware stack and it can take some time before someone with the necessary knowledge can get a hold of the hardware).\n\n\n*No. Security on Linux in general is as good as it gets, and it ismuch  better than how Microsoft does it. But with security it is most of the time the user that is the problem: clicking on stuff one should not click; installing stuff you should not install; etc. Our software center is wonderful in that regard: no browsing the web for software, having you end up on some obscure website. Not handing out your admin password helps a lot.\n\n\n\nThe best thing to do is to install the newest LTS version (now 14.04). That one tends to be rock solid after a few months of release and only offers the next LTS version as an upgrade path by default.\nAnd just to make it clear: my 70 year old mother is using Ubuntu 14.04 for internet, emails, newsletters, listening to music, and watching YouTube videos. She even told me she found a very good Dutch instruction site for using Libreoffice Writer. And she brags to her friends about having a system that does not get viruses when one of them complains about Windows needing to be re-installed. \nIf she can use it so can you. \n", "Q: Only one monitor usable with dual monitor setup (Displayport MST setup) I am running a desktop computer with a Radeon HD6870 video card. The card is attached to a Dell U2515H monitor, to which another Dell U2515H monitor is attached (the displays are daisy chained together for a MST setup). This setup works in Windows.\nIn Ubuntu 15.10, however, the second monitor is not detected at all and it displays the same content as the first monitor. \nThe old Ask Ubuntu question Displayport 1.2 MST/daisy chain - Dual Monitor setup - Intel graphics contains some promising replies, and I would assume that the current kernel supports MST. However, not out of the box, apparently. How can I get extend the desktop to the second monitor using MST in Ubuntu 15.10?\nUpdate: I have found a news article Radeon DisplayPort MST Queued For Linux 4.1. As Ubuntu 15.10 uses kernel 4.20, it should theoretically work. The article says that \"While the open-source Radeon DP MST support will appear in Linux 4.1, it's disabled by default.\" I'll continue my research and update this question if I find out a solution.\nUpdate 2: Apparently the support is not just there yet, as of November 25th, 2015. I updated my kernel to 4.2.6 and set the kernel parameter \"radeon_mst=1\", which should have enabled MST support for Radeon according to various instructions in the Internet. However, this resulted in a black screen after boot-up. Researching some more, I found out the following open bugs describing this phenomenon:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-ati/+bug/1509997\nhttps://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92790\nApparently the only viable option is to wait for this bug to be fixed. Or use a hardware-based workaround: purchasing a graphic card with two DisplayPort outputs.\nUpdate 3:\nPossibly the problem could be solved by using the proprietary binary driver from AMD, fglrx. For me it's not a viable solution, as I have upgraded to Ubuntu 16.04, and the fglrx is not available for that version. I saw some hints of Radeon MST-related changes in Linux kernel 4.6 change logs, so I'm hoping that brings some improvement (with Ubuntu 16.10).\n\nA: The kernel parameter is \"radeon.mst=1\" according to other sources. Not sure if both are supported in the end.\n\nA: This works out of the box using kernel 4.15.2 (maybe earlier) with the open-source drivers, and no kernel command-line parameters needed.

Is there anything I am missing for the Ubuntu dual boot? \nHello everyone! I am aware of the fact that hard disk supports only 4 partitions and thus I have basically two partitions (I don't know if I should be counting system reserve as a partition or not). To install Ubuntu Mate 15.10, I shrinked the c: drive (where windows is installed) to create some unallocated space where Ubuntu can be installed. But when I tried to install ubuntu, the installer shows 4 partitions and some \"unusable space\" instead of showing free space. I have: \n\n\n*\n\n*checked the sha1 checksum of the iso,\n\n*disabled secure boot, fast boot, hibernate.\n\n*shutdown the computer completely before starting the installation process\n\n*shrinked c: to create some free space for ubuntu\n\n*made sure I have less than 4 partitions\n\n\nI am suspecting there are some issues with the partition but am not being able to figure it out. Could anyone shed some lights please?\n\nA: \nI am aware of the fact that hard disk supports only 4 partitions\n\nThat's not strictly true. Partitions are defined by data structures known as partition tables. One very common partition table type, the Master Boot Record (MBR), supports a maximum of four primary partitions; however, one of these can be an extended partition, which can hold an arbitrary number of logical partitions. The trick when using MBR is to avoid creating four primary partitions unless one of them is an extended partition. With an extended partition in place, you can have as many partitions as you like, although all but a maximum of three of them will be logical partitions. That's fine for Linux, but Windows can't boot from a logical partition. (Windows can still use logical partitions as data disks, though.)\nOther partition table types, such as the GUID Partition Table (GPT), have other limits. GPT supports up to 128 partitions by default. (Since GPT doesn't support extended or logical partitions, the modifier \"primary\" is meaningless with reference to GPT partitions.) GPT is important because it's more-or-less required when booting in EFI mode, which is the most common boot mode for new computers.\nIn any event, given your symptoms, you seem to have an MBR partition table.\n\nI have basically two partitions (I don't know if I should be counting system reserve as a partition or not).\n\nYour screen shot shows you have four partitions. You do count the System Reserved partition, but you do not count the areas shown as \"unallocated\" in your screen shot. One puzzling thing is that two of your partitions are marked as E:. I don't know if this is some Windows feature that enables you to tie two partitions together or if there's something weird going on.\nYou have a number of choices for how to proceed, given your current configuration. I recommend you read this question and my answer to it:\nWhere can I install ubuntu if I have 4 primary partitions?\nIn your case, if you want to stick with BIOS-mode booting from an MBR disk, you may need to move your C: drive up to the end of the disk. You should then be able to convert your 181 GB disk to logical form using FixParts. You'll then be able to install Linux in the free space. Be aware, though, that partition-moving operations are risky, so before you move C:, you should back it up. It's safest to move it using a Windows tool, but do not use the standard Windows tools to create new partitions; the Windows tools are dangerously buggy when dealing with logical partitions and may convert the disk from a conventional setup to a Logical Disk Manager (LDM) configuration if given half an excuse. The trouble with LDM is that it's pretty much impossible to install Ubuntu on an LDM configuration, and converting back from LDM is another challenge you don't want to face.\nAlternatively, if you're accessing your two E: partitions as if they were one partition, you might consider backing up the 181 GB partition (it looks like it's barely used), delete it, expand the 99 GB partition to fill its space (plus the 6 GB between them), and then restore your backed-up data. This will free up one primary partition, enabling you to create an extended partition after your C: partition. You can then put Ubuntu in logical partitions inside the extended partition. If E: is sufficiently weird or damaged, you might delete both of them and create a single new partition in their place, for much the same effect.\n", "Q: how to continue installing packages? so I was trying to install apktool using katoolin on Ubuntu 14.04LTS, while the installation was about to finish I accidentally closed the terminal.

That is the first error.\nI would also suggest to use another class of addreses for the interconnection. If you have servers connected to the network on 192.168.1.XX and 192.168.1.YY, then use another class for interconnection. For instance use 192.168.2.XX and 192.168.2.YY for the second network cards. Then you can ping 192.168.2.YY from the XX and 192.168.2.XX from YY.\nSo use 192.168.1 for the network and 192.168.2 for interconnections. But do not assign both servers the same address.

The screen's name needs to be the exact and complete name.\nHow it is done (the concept)\nThe explanation is mostly on the concept, not so much on the coding.\nIn the output of xrandr, for every connected screen, there is a string/line, looking like:\nVGA-1 connected 1280x1024+1680+0\n\nThis line gives us information on the screen's position and its name, as explained here. \nThe script lists the information for all screens. When the script is run with the screen and the window class as arguments, it looks up the (x-) position of the screen, looks up all windows (-id's) of a certain class (with the help of wmctrl -l and the output of xprop -id <window_id>. \nSubsequently, the script moves all windows, one by one, to a position on the targeted screen (using wmctrl -ir <window_id> -e 0,<x>,<y>,<width>,<height>) and maximizes it (with xdotool windowsize 100% 100%).\nNote\nThe script worked fine on the tests I ran it with. Using wmctrl, and even xdotool, on Unity can have some stubborn peculiarities however that sometimes need to be solved by experiment rather than reasoning.

How do i know if graphical file managers use ext 2,3 or 4?\n i am a newbie so please be detailed as possible\n\nA: EXT is the filesystem Linux uses. Similar to what FAT was and NTFS is for Windows. Instead of using a new name Linux used a number for the newer versions of this filesystem. So EXT2, EXT3 are older, and nowadays obsolete, versions of EXT4. There are also systems that use BTFRS. That one is suppose to be the next filesystem for Linux (it supports some nifty features like on the fly snapshots).\n\nHow do i know if graphical file managers use ext 2,3 or 4?\n\nYou typically do not need to know this except when installing (just like with Windows Linux needs to have a formatted filesystem, ext4 being the current default, for it to work). ext4 uses journaling and allows for permissions. And some other features Linux needs. \nIf you need to know the formatting of your system there are several ways.\nFrom command line:\nsudo file -sL /dev/sd* | grep ext\n\n/dev/sda2: Linux rev 1.0 ext4 filesystem data\n/dev/sda5: Linux rev 1.0 ext4 filesystem data   \n/dev/sdb1: Linux rev 1.0 ext4 filesystem data\n\nBut you can also use gParted.

You can change the gap between windows in the settings:\n\nThough currently this extension is not available for GNOME 3.18, so you will have to give this workaround a go.\n\nA: On the edge of posting a duplicate of this one (but the question slightly differs), the script below does what you describe, if you run it with the arguments\npython3 /path/to/script.py 2 2\n\nHowever, if there are more than four windows (or more than the cells of a grid, if you use other arguments than 2 2), the script places only the four oldest windows in the grid.\nWhat it does\nWhen four windows are opened, randomly placed on the screen: \n\nrunning the script will arrange them in a grid:\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\n\n#--- set your preferences below: padding between windows, margin(s)\ncols = int(sys.argv[1]); rows = int(sys.argv[2]); padding = 10; left_margin = 0; top_margin = 30\n#---\n\nget = lambda cmd: subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd]).decode(\"utf-8\")\ndef get_res():\n    xr = get(\"xrandr\").split(); pos = xr.index(\"current\")\n    return [int(xr[pos+1]), int(xr[pos+3].replace(\",\", \"\") )]\n\ndef check_window(w_id):\n    w_type = get(\"xprop -id \"+w_id)\n    if \" _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NORMAL\" in w_type:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# get resolution\nres = get_res()\n# define (calculate) the area to divide\narea_h = res[0] - left_margin; area_v = res[1] - top_margin\n# create a list of calculated coordinates\nx_coords = [int(left_margin+area_h/cols*n) for n in range(cols)]\ny_coords = [int(top_margin+area_v/rows*n) for n in range(rows)]\ncoords = sum([[(cx, cy) for cx in x_coords] for cy in y_coords], [])\n# calculate the corresponding window size, given the padding, margins, columns and rows\nw_size = [str(int(area_h/cols - padding)), str(int(area_v/rows - padding))]\n# find windows of the application, identified by their pid\nwlist = [w.split()[0] for w in get(\"wmctrl -lp\").splitlines()]\nw_list = [w for w in wlist if check_window(w) == True][:cols*rows]\nprint(w_list)\n\n# remove possibly maximization, move the windows\nfor n, w in enumerate(w_list):\n    data = (\",\").join([str(item) for item in coords[n]])+\",\"+(\",\").join(w_size)\n    cmd1 = \"wmctrl -ir \"+w+\" -b remove,maximized_horz\"\n    cmd2 = \"wmctrl -ir \"+w+\" -b remove,maximized_vert\"\n    cmd3 = \"wmctrl -ir \"+w+\" -e 0,\"+data\n    for cmd in [cmd1, cmd2, cmd3]:\n        subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd])\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*The script needs both xdotool and wmctrl:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool wmctrl\n\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as twobytwo.py\n\n*Test- run it by opening four windows (at least one terminal window to run the command), the run the command:\npython3 /path/to/twobytwo.py 2 2\n\nThe windows should move into a grid of 4, as in the second image\n\n*If all works fine, add it to a shortcut key: choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the command:\npython3 /path/to/twobytwo.py 2 2\n\nNote(s)\n\n\n*\n\n*in the head section, there is a section:\nleft_margin = 0\n\nI set this to zero, since gnome does not have the launcher on the left. For Unity, this should be (at least) 65, depending on the set width of the launcher.\n\n*As mentioned, the script, as it is, grids the four oldest windows. That means if you need more windows to be placed in the same grid, the script needs an edit. Please mention if so.\n\n", "Q: Package to configure Trackpoint on Dell Latitude E6410? I have a Dell Latitude E6410 running latest Ubuntu 15.04 (see Details at the end of this question).

Fail2ban then supplies temporary rules to iptables for blocking connections to IP addresses associated with failed authentication attempts. The number of times and failed connection attempts are configurable, but my point is basically that while you could have iptables start logging to a file, it makes more sense to either check the log files fail2ban monitors directly, or ask iptables to display a list of current rules (since this will include temporarily blocked IP addresses and which rule they were associated with).\nTL;DR try sudo iptables -S to list the current status. If any IP addresses are currently being blocked, you'll see them there instantly.\nThis DigitalOcean 'iptables basics' article is a helpful place to start learning more about essential commands. \n", "Q: Prevent Ubuntu from shutdown before background automatic updates complete I have installed a (x)Ubuntu 14.04 on a friend's PC. Automatic updates are set to \"download and automatic install updates\".\nThe problem is that, after some months of use, he unknowingly shuts down his PC before packages upgrade complete. That leads to broken dependencies/packages, which leads to updating being affected and the need to run sudo dpkg --configure -a\nIs it possible to make Ubuntu wait for the updates to complete before PC shutdown or reboot like Windows does to ensure that there will never be broken packages and that his PC will remain updated automatically?\n\nA: Molly-Guard is a program for exactly this purpose; it requires you do a small amount of setup, and have /usr/sbin before /sbin in your $PATH.\nOtherwise, according to this the exact details are highly dependent on the GUI / DE's implementation. Since we know your friend is using Xubuntu, this narrows it, but without recompiling Xfce with this support built-in (which would create further issues) it seems very hard.\nAccording to my bountiful research, you can theoretically just replace /sbin/shutdown with a script that checks if an apt job is up and executes sudo shutdown -c or sudo init 2 to cancel a running shutdown and wait for it to exit, but I'm not sure how robust this is.\nAccording to this, you could just make it hard for the user to shutdown, instead of hooking a script.\nFinally, as outlined here, you could install unattended-upgrades over whatever system you're using for autoupdates now, and make sure it exits before shutdown as detailed in this answer.\n\nThere are many options, all of which are varying levels of unreliable, but I think the best one, which solves what I think is, to some extent, an underlying X / Y Problem at play here, is this:\nUse crontab to make his computer run dpkg --configure -a on every boot.\n@LovesTha: For your purpose, I recommend unattended-upgrades, or perhaps Molly-Guard.\n\nA: Introduction\nThe script bellow uses interrupt-driven  polling for specific messages from dbus, and whenever it sees request for shutdown/reboot , it will test whether or not a package manager such as dpkg or apt are running. If they are running, the shutdown request will be cancelled.\nSet up\nSince you have mentioned that your friend doesn't want to touch command line, you will either need to ssh into his machine, or come over and install this manually. \nManual setup\n\n\n*\n\n*mkdir $HOME/bin\n\n*Copy the script source, save into file named preventShutdown.sh\n\n*The script must be executable.

However, in order for some npm packages to work (such as those that require building from source), you will need to install the build-essentials package:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nFor More information take a look at this page.\n\nA: Official instructions:\nhttps://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/\nSimply scroll down to the \"Debian and Ubuntu based Linux distributions\" section, and you'll find the following commands for installing the latest versions..\nIe, for the latest NodeJS 7.x : \ncurl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_7.x | sudo -E bash -\n\nsudo apt-get install -y nodejs\n\nFor ubuntu, you might also want to install the optional build tools (recommended though, saves you from future headaches ssince notable npm packages USE it)\nsudo apt-get install -y build-essential\n\nNote: The instructions already installs both NodeJS & NPM, hence after doing so, you can already go \"npm install whateveryouwantgoeshere -g\" for any npm package.\n", "Q: Why is my interface now wlp2s0 instead of wlan0? Everything works fine I just want to know why would my interface change to wlp2s0 by default instead of the usual wlan0\n\nA: A new naming scheme has been introduced, to solve problems that arose from the old (eth0, wlan0) naming standards.\nHere is a short introduction and explanation of the concept:\nhttp://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/\nBasically, the first two letter describe the type of interface. 'wl' for wlan, 'en' for ethernet. The following code is often a description of the physical placement of the device in your computer - p2 is likely PCI bus 2, and s0 is likely slot 0.\nAs kyodake pointed out, this new standard was introduced when Ubuntu moved to systemd.\n\nA: Why Ubuntu with systemd have added native support for a number of different naming policies into systemd/udevd proper and made a scheme similar to biosdevname's the default. \nThe following different naming schemes for network interfaces are now supported by udev natively:\n(1) Names incorporating Firmware/BIOS provided index numbers for on-board devices (example: eno1)\n   (2) Names incorporating Firmware/BIOS provided PCI Express hotplug slot index numbers (example: ens1)\n   (3) Names incorporating physical/geographical location of the connector of the hardware (example: enp2s0)\n   (4) Names incorporating the interfaces's MAC address (example: enx78e7d1ea46da)\n   (5) Classic, unpredictable kernel-native ethX naming (example: eth0)\n\nBy default, systemd will now name interfaces following policy:\n  (1) if that information from the firmware is applicable and available, falling back to: \n  (2) if that information from the firmware is applicable and available, falling back to: \n  (3) if applicable, falling back to: \n  (5) in all other cases. \n  Policy (4) is not used by default, but is available if the user chooses so. \n\n", "Q: command line to get hidden attribute for file on a NTFS samba share I am using \"Ubuntu Server 14.04.1 LTS\" and I'm having a problem reading if a file on a NTFS samba share is marked in windows as \"hidden\".

The folks that developed SQL Developer recently added a command line version sqlcl. The problem is, this a Java application - and firing this up (jvm) each time I need to do a compilation can be expensive - with some reports of it taking ~20 seconds. \nOne suggestion I've seen was to use a named pipe, which if I do so manually, appears to work well. \nTerminal 1:\nmkfifo sqlconsole\ntail -f sqlconsole | /opt/sqlcl/bin/sql /nolog\n\nTerminal 2:\necho \"conn hr/hr@example.com/xe\" > sqlconsole\n\nAnd the statements are run successfully. \nThe issue with this though, is that in terminal 2, I'm not getting any of the output from terminal 1 (which I want). \n\n..\nI found this article about reading output from a named pipe, however even with that, the output from sqlcl is not re-directed (and, as writing this up, seems to have broken input)\n#!/bin/bash\n#consolereader.sh\ntrap \"rm -f sqlconsole\" EXIT\n\nif [[ ! -p sqlconsole ]]; then\n    echo \"pipe does not exist\" >&2\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nwhile true\ndo\n    if read line < sqlconsole; then\n        if [[ \"$line\" == 'quit' ]]; then\n            break\n        fi\n        echo $line\n    fi\ndone\n\nTerminal 1:\nmkfifo sqlconsole\ntail -f sqlconsole | /opt/sqlcl/bin/sql /nolog\n\nTerminal 2:\n./consolereader.sh &\necho \"conn hr/hr@example.com/xe\" > sqlconsole\n\n\nIs there a better approach I can take - such that I can leave sqlcl running in the background, and still get the output in the session I send the commands from?\n..\nEdit: Trying Germar's solution:\nsetUpPipes.sh (terminal 1):\n#!/bin/bash\nrm -f sqlconsole\nrm -f sqlconsole_out\nmkfifo sqlconsole\nmkfifo sqlconsole_out\ntail -f sqlconsole | /opt/sqlcl/bin/sql /nolog | tee -a sqlconsole_out\n\ncompileOracle.sh (terminal 2):\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"begin..\"\ntail -f /home/trent/pipedemo/sqlconsole_out &\necho \"about to run connection\"\necho \"conn hr/hr@example.com/xe\" > /home/trent/pipedemo/sqlconsole\necho \"select * from dual\" > /home/trent/pipedemo/sqlconsole\necho \"disconnect\" > /home/trent/pipedemo/sqlconsole\necho \"finished\"\nexit 0\n\n\n\nA: One approach you could take is to make use of the SPOOL command in your SQL interpreter.\nSo, start your named pipe as you were already doing so:\nmkfifo sqlconsole\ntail -f sqlconsole | /opt/sqlcl/bin/sql /nolog\n\nNext, make your SQL script, but this time enabling serveroutput and also spooling to a specified file.

Can this be achieved without uninstalling them (there still are dependencies and I even believe an occasion can heppen when I'll actually need them)?\n\nA: Yes, because you are using Ubuntu 15.10, you can now use systemd to disable these unwanted services.\nYou have two options: disable & mask.\nOPTION ONE:\nWhen you mask a service, you prevent any user or service from starting this service by creating a symlink to /dev/null.\nTo mask a service: \nFor example to completely disable apport, run the following command:\nsudo systemctl stop apport\nsudo systemctl mask apport\nsystemctl status apport\n\nIf successful, the last command should return the following:\n● apport.service\n   Loaded: masked (/dev/null)\n   Active: inactive (dead)\n\nOPTION TWO:\nWhen you disable a service, you prevent the service from loading automatically at boot time.\nHowever, the service may still start if called by another service when disabled and you can still start the service up by explicitly calling the service.\nTo disable a service: \nTo prevent apport from starting at boot, run the following command:\nsudo systemctl stop apport\nsudo systemctl disable apport\nsystemctl status apport\n\n\nRun the following command for a more complete list and use grep to narrow the results:\nsystemctl status -a\n\n", "Q: Custom key for Home/End on Ubuntu Gnome 15.10 My laptop is Thinkpad T440.\nBecause of Lenovo designing, Home/End key is on header, in the line with F1-F12 keys.\nFor my convinient, I want to make some custom shortcut key to map with Home/End key.

What is the actual purpose of every particular one to exist and into which should I put my application .desktop file in what a case?\nAnd where are application icons put to be found as referenced in the .desktop files?\n\nA: .desktop files\nGlobally installed applications have their .desktop file in /usr/share/applications. If a similarly named .desktop file exists in ~/.local/share/applications, it will \"overrule\" the global one (after log out/in after they were created). Local .desktop files are used for user-specific alterations of the functionality of the launcher, to add items to the quicklist (in Unity) e.g., or for locally installed applications.\nThe third directory you mention, /usr/share/app-install/desktop is used by Software Center, as explained here. Many applications don't use this one at all.\nIcons\ncan technically be stored anywhere. Small applications can have their files (including icon) e.g. stored in one self-containing directory in /opt/<application_name>, but most of them will be found in /usr/share/icons/. \nAn excellent Question/Answer(s) combination on icons can be found here.\n", "Q: Do applications need to be stopped before upgrading packages or restarted after upgrading packages?

The installation and removal scripts in /var/lib/dpkg/info start and stop the services for you, if it's necessary.

By doing this, the manufacturer ensures that everyone can use the full size of the disk.\nThis Seagate article gives a bit more information about these \"virtual\" disks. Seagate also provides a Windows tool called DiskWizard to format the HDD as one big disk.\nInstead of reformatting your disk, you can also use both disks as LVM partitions. They can then be used as one big disk. Create partitions smaller than 2 TB, and add them to a Logical Volume Manager (LVM) volume group, then create a logical LVM volume greater than 2 TB. Once the logical volume is created, you can format it with a file system of your choice.\nThis IBM article shows you one way of creating partitions bigger than 2TB on Ubuntu. Your kernel needs GPT support for that.\n\nA: This is hardware. You can not turn it off (The review you cited suggests you can reflash firmware).\nIf you want to use it as a single disk, there are several ways in linux to combine several partitions into one. I recommend to set up BTRFS RAID 0. Instructions here. It will not incur noticable performance overhead. With BTRFS you can also turn on compression, which increases the read/write speed for external HDDs. \n", "Q: Unable to connect to wifi my dell xps13 My dell laptop is xps13, card type is dw1560, but can't find this type of Linux network card.\nMachine type is XPS13D - 9343-9343.\n\n\nA: You have to use either an Ethernet USB adapter or a Wi-fi dongle to connect to internet to install the needed driver.\nOnce you are connected to internet, run :\n sudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source\n\n", "Q: Qualcomm Atheros Device [168c:003e] (rev 32) QCA6174 - Problems after kernel/firmware update (4.2.0-18-generic/firmware_1.149.2) I recently updated because of a missing wifi driver (Qualcomm Atheros Device [168c:003e] - ath10k_pci) to 4.2.0-18-generic/firmware_1.149.2.\nThe Wifi is still not working (even with the driver).\n\nlspci -knn | grep -i Net -A2\nrfkill list\nsudo lshw -C Network\ndmesg\n\n07:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Qualcomm Atheros Device [168c:003e] (rev 32)\n    Subsystem: Lite-On Communications Inc Device [11ad:0807]\n    Kernel driver in use: ath10k_pci\n08:00.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

It also lets you \"look inside\" an MP3 file.\nUnlike some programs that are designed to deal with a single topic (like fixing VBR headers or adding cover art), MP3 Diags is a one stop solution that identifies more than 50 different issues in MP3 files and provides the means to fix many of them (well, not everything is fixable; you can't make a 64kbps file sound like a 256kbps one.)\nSome of the more important issues that are found:\n\n\n*\n\n*broken tags / headers / audio\n\n*duplicate tags / headers\n\n*incorrect placement of tags / headers (ID3V2, ID3V1, LAME, Xing, ...)\n\n*low quality audio\n\n*missing VBR header\n\n*missing track info / cover art\n\n*broken track info / cover art\n\n*missing normalization data\n\n*character encoding issues (for languages other than English)\n\n\nSome of the fixes and changes that MP3 Diags can do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adding / fixing track info, including album cover; information can be retrieved from several sources: Internet, clipboard, file name, local files, and (obviously) keyboard\n\n*Correcting files that show incorrect song duration\n\n*Correcting files in which the player cannot seek correctly\n\n*Converting characters for non-English names\n\n*Adding composer name to the artist field, for players that don't handle the composer field\n\n*Renaming files based on their fields\n\n*Changing word case for track info\n\n\nAll infos taken from here\n", "Q: How can I disable the low battery alarm? I have the low battery alarm disabled in the BIOS settings on my Lemur laptop, but the alarm still sounds when the battery is low.  The sound is a very loud and annoying beep that repeats every couple seconds.

I found that if I mute my audio then the beep stops but I obviously cannot listen to anything anymore. If i turn the volume back on even to just 1% the battery alarm is audible again at full volume.  I remember there used to be a mixer somewhere that could control the internal speaker and so if I could find that again then maybe i could mute that and fix this problem. \nI have Ubuntu 14.04.

I have something i want to download that is not available on Ubuntu and can't be open with Wine. I want to delete and switch to Windows. Can anyone give me step by step how to change to Windows 10?\n\nA: First of all, rethink this. Make sure you backup the files you want. If you are sure about the decision follow the steps:\n1- Buy a Windows 10 License\n2- Download Windows 10 ISO file from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO\n3- Burn the ISO file into a flash drive (there are several tools for that. Look it up)\n4- Put the flash drive \n5- Restart the device \n6- Go to the BIOS (See your device's catalog or google it to find the key combination that opens BIOS). \n7- From the BIOS Make the flash drive the Boot device (There is usually a list of boot devices. You'll find your computer's HDD and the flash drive. Make the flash drive the first on the list).\n8- Restart\n9- Now The Windows 10 installation screen should appear. Follow the steps. They include putting your license number. Also you need to perform a clean install to delete everything.

Then you should do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*add /MusClementine to the list of music folders\n\n*let Clementine import you music from /AFS/Music\nThis should fix your issue.\n", "Q: Error while setting up jdk8 on Ubuntu 14.04LTS i was trying to setup jdk 8 using this  guide.\nAfter downloading the jdk i got an error that asked me to manually configure dpkg.\nadeen-s@adeen-s-PC:~$ sudo dpkg --configure -a\nSetting up oracle-java8-installer (8u66+8u65arm-1~webupd8~1) ...\nInstalling from local file /var/cache/oracle-jdk8-installer/jdk-8u66-linux-x64.tar.gz\nRemoving outdated cached downloads...\nmv: cannot move ‘jdk1.8.0_66’ to ‘java-8-oracle/jdk1.8.0_66’: Directory not empty\ndpkg: error processing package oracle-java8-installer (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of oracle-java8-set-default:\n oracle-java8-set-default depends on oracle-java8-installer; however:\n  Package oracle-java8-installer is not configured yet.\n\ndpkg: error processing package oracle-java8-set-default (--configure):\n dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n oracle-java8-installer\n oracle-java8-set-default\n\nHow do i fix this ?\nUPDATE : Tried installing again after following @A.B.

So I have to boot it instead to wake it from the suspend mode.\nThis does not happen if I suspend the PC during the day as the room temperature is higher (around 20°C).\nIs there a way to solve this strange issue?\n\nA: It is a hardware effect. You have a buildup of condensation on CPU socket, it short-cirquits near the power lines and the motherboard protection switches everything off.\nMay be your power unit or motherboard has a protection that shuts PC down when too cool to avoid condensation.\nAnyway, you need a specially built PC to use in such conditions or at least a way to dry the air inside it. \n\nA: I learned that the my office often looses power over the night. I was not aware of it before, but figured I could ask to see if it's a hardware issue or not. \nSo I have no plugged the pc into the APC and I think this will not happen before. \n", "Q: Ubuntu server 14.04 LTS black screen after grub Motherboard: Asus H170-PRO\nCPU: Intel Core i5-6500\nHDD: 1TB x2\nFrom the BIOS I made the following changes:\nAdvancedMode -> Boot -> Secure Boot -> Os Type = Other OS (instead of Windows)\nEz Tuning Wizard -> Created \"Super speed raid\" with the 2 identical harddisks.\nIntel Rapid Storage is ON.\nSaved and restarted.\nInstalled Ubuntu (without errors).

Is there any way of bringing it to my Ubuntu installation?\nSuch feature would be really useful, because it makes more straightforward to restore previous system states.\nThanks\n\nA: Snapshot in BTRFS is a form of subvolume. By default, your Ubuntu installer on BTRFS created two subvolumes - @ and @home. If you create there a snapshot, say @backup, then you can boot from it by editing grub settings during boot to change the root subvolume name from @ to @backup. You may need to edit @backup/etc/fstab too. \n\nA: There is a Git repository that promises to solve that problem:\nhttps://github.com/Antynea/grub-btrfs\nIt provides a script and configuration to put to /etc/grub.d and /etc/default, respectively.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 Headphones No Sound I have purchased a laptop: Alienware 17 r2\nInstalled Ubuntu 15.10 (Kernel 4.2.0-18-generic) and am having

I have this connected up to a second monitor using VGA. As soon as I disconnect the cable and try and reconnect again the second display will not work. \nOnly if I restart  the computer can I get monitor to display again. I have tried different laptops and don't encounter this problem, so I have ruled out faulty cable and monitor issues. \n\nA: I have this problem on the same laptop so it might be model-related. The fastest workaround is to sleep-resume (which sadly does not always work with me), or restart X server by pressing Alt-SysRq-k.

Example: Once the add-apt-repository process has terminated, immediately run apt-get update - without having to enter the command manually.\nIs there a way to do this? Is it possible to set such a combination without the use of the sudo password? (although I don't mind either way)\nI'm asking the following: How can I link two commands together, so that whenever I execute a particular command, it always executes the the linked command after it?\n\nA: As normally,\nsudo bash -c \"command1; command2\"\n\nIf you want to run command2 only after command1 is successfully completed,\nyou can use as && rather than ;.\nsudo bash -c \"command1 && command2\"\n\nI'll use following command for your example.\nsudo bash -c \"add-apt-repository <repo> && apt-get update\"\n\n\nA: There are various issues hooking into this with an alias or a simple bash function, but you can write a little wrapper for a command and stick it in /usr/local/bin which takes priority in your path.\nThis is a little trick to create a script and chmod it at the same time.\nIt'll dump an executable wrapper script in /usr/local/bin/add-apt-repository.\nsudo install -b -m 755 /dev/stdin /usr/local/bin/add-apt-repository << 'EOF'\n#!/bin/sh\n/usr/bin/add-apt-repository \"$@\"\napt-get update\nEOF \n\nTo reverse this, just delete /usr/local/bin/add-apt-repository.\nIf you want to do something fruitier (like linking apt-get install and apt-get update so you always update before installing), we just need to expand the script to look at the arguments.\nsudo install -b -m 755 /dev/stdin /usr/local/bin/apt-get << 'EOF'\n#!/bin/sh\nif [ \"$1\" = \"install\" ] ; then\n    /usr/bin/apt-get update\nfi\n/usr/bin/apt-get \"$@\"\nEOF \n\nThough consider that this will run an update before every apt-get install call. This might sound helpful but could be really tedious in practice.\n\nA: To execute certain commands in a particular sequence shell scripting is used. All you have to do is - Open terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T\nAnd follow the steps - \n1. Type gedit filename.sh \n2. After entering this command a text editor will open, where you can type the required commands one on each line. For example, sudo add-apt-repository  apt-get update \n3. After typing all the commands, save and exit either by using GUI or press Ctrl+S and Ctrl+Q.\n4. Now you will return back to terminal. Run sh filename.sh on terminal and your commands will execute, provided there is no error in your commands.\nAlso, if you login from superuser account (root) you won't have to type sudo in your command.\n\nA: The easiest way to do it is to run:\nsudo add-apt-repository <ppa_name> && sudo apt-get update\n\nIf the first command is finished successfully, the second will be run.\n", "Q: What is the difference between +bbb and -bbb images in the 15.04 release?

When not synonymous, a GB is 10⁹ bytes.\nA literal GB is 7.3741824e7 bytes (~70MiB) smaller than a literal GiB…\nSo if you want to match your RAM, you want 4 Gibibytes.\n\nWhen talking about computing, most people use GB when they actually mean GiB. This is something we could try to correct but it's endemic now. This causes issues when comparing:\n\n\n*\n\n*RAM is made in binary-power quantities. You actually have 4 GiB of RAM.\n\n*Storage vendors don't though, because it means they can sell a bigger number.\nIt's a marketing trick.\n\n\nAnd that's why Gparted is so explicit about this. They straddle the line between these two worlds.\n\nA: Swap is a memory on your HDD where will your RAM data be stored when hibernating or things like that, since RAM has to be electrically maintained it will be erased when PC shuts down and then again data will be buffered from the swap partition to your RAM when booted up..

My workstation can only drive one monitor while my laptop can drive two (just the way it works out with the cables I have). I currently have my laptop booting from a USB drive and I have Synergy installed, but I want a fair amount of storage on each machine. I have both connected via ethernet currently. Is it possible to set things up such that my desktop shares a large partition on the HDD with the laptop over ethernet that my laptop can use as its /home partition while still being able to access it on the desktop? Or is this a fantastically terrible idea from the start?\n\nA: I'd be a little cautious 'exporting' a home directory from the desktop to the laptop, but you could.  You should be fine to export another partition/folder from the desktop using nfs, which you'd then 'mount' from the laptop.\nAlternatively you could mount a directory over SSH (simple and useful for lightweight file use and browsing).  If you are using the nautilus file manager try Menu->File->Connect to Server (select SSH).\nAlternatively you might want to use X11 forwarding.  Which would let you use remote apps from the desktop on the laptop.  Say run gedit on the desktop, but have the window and input on your laptop.  This would also allow you to bypass exports and mounts this way.\n", "Q: Is there a way to remove grub without a live cd I had installed Puppy Tahr alongside with Ubuntu 14.04,then I had do remove Puppy but the grub still remained installed. \nAnd even now,grub menu appears everytime I turn the computer on,showing the removed distro/partition and asks me to choose a one to boot with.\nHow can I remove it without using a live cd(I don't have it). \nThanks in advance ! :)\n\nA: sudo update-grub should do it. The grub menu is automatically generated based on configuration files and the current partition layout.

These new directories showed correctly on desktops.\nNautilus, and any other desktop file manager was not useful for such a task, as these such \"broken\" folders displayed as regular files via MTP. \nHard problem to explain, still not sure what happened exactly, but I got my data back into real folders.\n\nA: This seems to be a cache problem. On your phone go to settings->apps, Look for media storage and external storage and delete their cache and data. These apps may not be visible since they are system apps. In such a case, select show system apps from context menu. Exact name may be differ on different devices.\nThen reboot phone and wait a while for their cache to generate again. Cache generation is done on background so it does not show progress. It may take around 5 minutes to be completed.\n", "Q: Get disk quota when not administrator? I'm logged into uBuntu 14.04 LTS at the University. After several hours of working in nvcc (cpp compiler for nVidia CUDA C), editing .cu (CUDA cpp) and make files in gedit I suddenly get a \"Disk quota exceeded\" error.\nHuh?\nI searched online and found that commands \"df -h\" and \"du -sh\" should show me my disk quota. But when I run either of these in Terminal, Terminal hangs and I have to kill it. I'm assuming this is because I don't have rights to run these commands. There is no error message, just a hang.

Then tried the \"quota\" command suggested in the comments by @mark kirby (which failed due to not being installed)...then I tried \"df -h\" again and it worked! Don't think it was trying \"quota\" that did it. Perhaps I was so close to my limit that tmp files required for \"df\" could not be created.\n\nA: First, du -sh takes a long time to execute, because it has to look at all files in all subdirectories all the way down to find the size of the files. How long did you wait?  \ndf -h (I'd use df -h .) should return quickly. Again, what do you mean by \"hang\"?\nYou can recover some disk space by removing object (*.o) files, which I assume you can recreate through your .cus and Makefiles. find . -type f -name '*.o' -ls will show them to you. Replace -ls with -print0 | xargs -0 rm to delete them all. Read man nvcc to find other leftover temporary files.\nHow many levels of source file backup do you keep?\nYou can use gzip (man gzip) to compress files you are not using at the moment to regain some space.\nquota --human-readable (and man quota) will show your disk quota. du will show your disk usage (man du). df (man df) will display disk volume information.\n", "Q: No WiFi connection & wireless card is Intel 7265 After executing dmesg | grep iwl I got the following \n\najay@ajay-HP-ENVY-x360-m6-Convertible:~$ dmesg | grep iwl\n[    7.380746] iwlwifi 0000:08:00.0: Unsupported splx structure\n[    7.656699] iwlwifi 0000:08:00.0: Direct firmware load for iwlwifi-7265D-15.ucode failed with error -2\n[    7.657559] iwlwifi 0000:08:00.0: Direct firmware load for iwlwifi-7265D-14.ucode failed with error -2\n[    8.032821] iwlwifi 0000:08:00.0: loaded firmware version 25.30.13.0 op_mode iwlmvm\n[    8.231836] iwlwifi 0000:08:00.0: Detected Intel(R) Dual Band Wireless AC 7265, REV=0x210\n[    8.232167] iwlwifi 0000:08:00.0: L1 Enabled - LTR Enabled\n[    8.232610] iwlwifi 0000:08:00.0: L1 Enabled - LTR Enabled\n[    8.320209] ieee80211 phy0: Selected rate control algorithm 'iwl-mvm-rs'\n[    8.339011] iwlwifi 0000:08:00.0 wlp8s0: renamed from wlan0\n[   29.034771] iwlwifi 0000:08:00.0: L1 Enabled - LTR Enabled\n[   29.035221] iwlwifi 0000:08:00.0: L1 Enabled - LTR Enabled\n[   29.097485] iwlwifi 0000:08:00.0: L1 Enabled - LTR Enabled\n[   29.097928] iwlwifi 0000:08:00.0: L1 Enabled - LTR Enabled\n[   34.748671] iwlwifi 0000:08:00.0: L1 Enabled - LTR Enabled\n[   34.749440] iwlwifi 0000:08:00.0: L1 Enabled - LTR Enabled\n[   34.811700] iwlwifi 0000:08:00.0: L1 Enabled - LTR Enabled\n[   34.812143] iwlwifi 0000:08:00.0: L1 Enabled - LTR Enabled\n[14461.349721] Modules linked in: rfcomm bnep nls_iso8859_1 arc4 iwlmvm(OE) intel_rapl uvcvideo mac80211(OE) x86_pkg_temp_thermal hid_multitouch hid_sensor_accel_3d hid_sensor_gyro_3d hid_sensor_magn_3d hid_sensor_rotation hid_sensor_incl_3d videobuf2_vmalloc videobuf2_memops hid_sensor_trigger videobuf2_core intel_powerclamp v4l2_common coretemp videodev industrialio_triggered_buffer acer_wmi kfifo_buf hp_wmi sparse_keymap industrialio snd_hda_codec_hdmi media kvm btusb hid_sensor_iio_common snd_hda_codec_realtek snd_hda_codec_generic btrtl snd_hda_intel snd_hda_codec btbcm snd_soc_rt5640 snd_hda_core crct10dif_pclmul snd_hwdep crc32_pclmul snd_seq_midi ghash_clmulni_intel iwlwifi(OE) aesni_intel snd_seq_midi_event aes_x86_64 lrw btintel snd_soc_rl6231 gf128mul glue_helper bluetooth snd_soc_core ablk_helper\najay@ajay-HP-ENVY-x360-m6-Convertible:~$ \n\n\nAnd also the following after running rfkill list all\najay@ajay-HP-ENVY-x360-m6-Convertible:~$ rfkill list all\n0: hci0: Bluetooth\n    Soft blocked: yes\n    Hard blocked: no\n1: acer-wireless: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: yes\n    Hard blocked: no\n2: phy0: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n\nPlease advise further instructions to be executed \n\nA: Support for your device is supposed to be in Kernel 4.2, which is included with Ubuntu 15.10.

The gateway mus be the IP of the ethernet card (not wifi) of the computer connected to wifi, but the IP can be random. \n\n*disconnect the router and create on the computer an ad-hoc wired connection with the  IP set as your router gateway. To do this, you must set in the conf file \"shared\" type of connection. \n\n*connect again to the router using the PC cable and enter in it via SSH or Telnet and check with ping if you have internet. I couldn't find any guide to \"how to create ad hoc connection via terminal\" and I'm not sure it's possible to connect a router via ad-hoc connection. So, as you can see, it's very very tricky.\nMoreover, if you can do all this stuff and it works, my experience with ad-hoc connections tells that they are crap, they are slow, they go down for no reason if you have too much traffic, so I don't suggest using them.\nThe best way for you is to buy a range extender (repeater) and configure it with a computer using the GUI, with a fixed IP and getway etc, then set up (via SSH or Telnet) your cabled router, and connect them via LAN cable. \nA second option is this: you need 2 computers: take computer number 1 and connect it to the wifi, check ping, if you have internet, connect via LAN cable to computer number 2, after connecting it create on computer number 1 an ad-hoc connection. \nThen create on computer number 2 a new ethernet connection with the right IP and Gateway for the ad-hoc connection.

I have a Nvidia GeForce 8600 GT graphics card that worked on windows before I switched to Ubuntu 14.04. When I booted up for the first time the screen had white pixel sized rectangles appearing and moving around (similarly to a tv screen that is staticky) and the screen would freeze. I tried switching to A Nvidia proprietary driver but none of those were Nvidia GeForce 8600. I went to the website to download the driver manually but I would never get far enough before the computer would freeze and I would have to enter the R.E.I.S.U.B command to shutdown the computer. After this happened a few times i finally decided to switch to the integrated graphics card. It has been working fine but now I want to change back to my Nvidia card because it is faster and compatible with more games but every time I try to turn it back on from the shutdown menu settings and boot it up It either partially boots and then blacks out or fully boots and shows \"acpi ppc probe failure\" then quickly freezes. I am starting to wonder if my graphics card is compatible with Linux since on the box it says \"built for Vista\" Is there any way to make it work?\n\nA: I have a GeForce GTX 860M on newer hardware that was giving me problems after installation of 14.04. My problems are a combination of video card and other unsupported hardware. I updated my kernel and driver and that has resolved most of my problems. One relevant glitch that persists is my system boots to a black screen because the nVidia driver doesn't know how to switch the output to the LCD correctly. (Solution: close lid of laptop after boot. System goes into suspend. Then, open lid and unsuspend. Video driver figures it out and login dialog appears.)\nTo do what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a newer kernel. It is not clear to me from your description if you need this but it is fairly safe and fully reversible. sudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-vivid It will leave your original kernel in place. Make sure you have some extra free space on /boot if you are going to let Ubuntu auto-update both series of kernels. Afterwards pay attention to the kernel that GRUB selects when you boot up.\n\n*Install the xorg edgers ppa and then sudo apt-get install nvidia-352. to get a newer nVidia driver. Note that 352 is not the newest release. I am using it because the newer ones have/had a bug in them that conflicted with my upgraded kernel.

The VirtualBox network configuration is in bridge mode.\n\n\nI've have SSH access to the virtual server from the host machine. The virtual web server, configured with Apache, it's also reachable from the host machine putting the IP address into the browser. But only because I'm in the same network.\nIf I try to access either of the static IP's from outside the network, it's not working.\nSo, I would like to access to the virtual server IP from the Internet (I've a domain and I'd like it to redirect to this IP).\nI've tried several answers searching through interent, but I'm not able to accomplish my objective. I've come to think that por redirection is the solution, but I don't know how to apply it.\nCould I access directly to the virtual server static IP or should I access to the host machine static IP? What do I need to do?!!\n\nA: There are two ways to approach this, depending on how you've configured networking for the VM.  either way, you have to port forward on the router to internal somewhere.\nIf your networking is set up to be 'NAT', then you set up Port Forwarding on your network at the border router to point to your host machine/computer.  You then edit the VirtualBox networking of NAT to add port forwards where necessary.\nIf your networking is set up to be 'Bridged Network', then you set up Port Forwarding on your network at the border router to point to the IP address assigned to your VM by the router.\nSeveral concerns.  Security concerns are bold, other ones are italic.\n\n\n*\n\n*Port-forwarding Port 22 is not the best thing to do - you will have brute-forcers and other attacks trying to breach the machine.\n\n*Not all ISPs permit you to run web servers.  You may have blocks put in place for this going forward.\n\n*Your router may actually listen on port 80 or 443 for administration connections.  This means your router is using those ports and you won't be permitted to use them.  Also means you may be exposing your router administration ports to the net which is even worse.\n\n*You will not be able to use any URL or hostname from the Outside to connect to your system, without getting additional things from Dynamic DNS providers, and doing proper configuration. You will need to set up Dynamic DNS on your router with a dynamic DNS service to provide a domain name that 'updates' based on your router's current IP address (or other equivalent discovery system), and then the internet would be able to reach your site (provided port forwarding is done correctly, and your web server on the VM is configured correctly.)\n\n\nA: If you want to access your server (virtual or otherwise) from outside your local network, you setup your router with the appropriate port forwarding... In your router set ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS) to forward to 192.168.0.10, but setting 22 to port forward in is a serious security risk. The \"Internet\" does not comprehend and cannot talk directly to your internal LAN, only your public IP address, so you would have to register your domain to your public IP address, not the 192.168.x.x address, and manage the forwarding of the proper services yourself. Remember that in doing this you should use a DDNS registration of you get your public IP address via DHCP, or you should have a static public IP address if you want to do a standard domain name registration.\n", "Q: 404 Not found error when I type sudo apt-get update In a terminal when I insert this command line\nsudo apt-get update\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/gwibber-daily/ppa/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not Found\nE: Some index files failed to download.

Recommended is to install the required tools for successful package generation.\nOptionally, you can run commands to ignore these dependecies but end result may not be as expected. Not recommended\n\nI already installed the headers for 4.2.0-18-generic kernel, and solved the \"version.h\" missing according to this post. But can't proceed with building the ATI driver...\nCan someone help, please !?\n\nA: I had the same problem and solved it by following the instructions from this page. The page is written in spanish, but all the commands are in english, so it's pretty straightforward. \nAccording with this page, there is a bug in the Ubuntu/wily AMD installation script. That's why you can't install the new driver.\nJust to warn you, the command \nsudo ./amd-driver-installer-15.30.1025-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/wily\n\nmay take some minutes to finish, so don't think that the terminal is frozen.\nAnd there's also a little mistake in the command\nsudo dpgk -i *.deb\n\nThe correct command is\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\nHope that it helps!\n\nA: It looks like you are trying to build the package with the GUI.\nThe GUI checks for dependencies using a file list rather than dpkg.  This is a bad method, and breaks with certain kernel updates.  The solution is to simply run the build package from the command prompt.\nsudo ./amd-driver-installer-15.30.1025-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/wily\n\nFurthermore, as mentioned above by someone else, you shouldn't rely on the tools to install the package for you, as again the scripts are problematic at best.  \nJust use \"dpkg -i ./fglrx*.deb\" instead.\n", "Q: Dell Inspiron 15 5559 hangs at shutdown, wierd start ups I just bought a new Dell machine.

I like to play around gedit and than just compile it in terminal. \nAnyways, I did install Ubuntu. Problems started arising as soon as I did. After I finished installing it for the first time, I heard a crackling noise in the speakers. I tought that was strange, checked online, wrote a few lines in Terminal and that was solved.\nThan the major problem I had was that I couldn't reboot or shut down the laptop normaly. It woud hang at shutdown with a big list in front of me of some adresses. After I checked online and couldn't find anything that could resemble my issues I reinstalled it and started from scratch.

I've been running Ubuntu on this laptop for about 3 years without any issues related to the touchpad until now.\nI was running Rstudio and attempting to install the package \"rgl\". The installation failed due to the following error:\nchecking for X... no\nconfigure: error: X2 not found but required, configure aborted.\nERROR: configuration failed for package 'rgl'\n\nOn the basis of this thread:  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=787464 I tried to install xserver-xorg-dev, but ran into the following error message:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\nunity-control-center : Depends: libcheese-gtk23 (>= 3.4.0) but it is not going to be installed\n                       Depends: libcheese7 (>= 3.0.1) but it is not going to be installed\nE: Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages.\n\nDespite the fact that my current versions of libcheese-gtk23 and libcheese7 are 3.10.2, and so shouldn't cause an issue.\nThis bug has already been reported (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity-control-center/+bug/1428972) and the advice in the comments suggested running\nsudo apt-get install canonical-certification-client libcheese-gtk23 libcheese7 libclutter-1.0-0 libclutter-gtk-1.0-0 libcogl15 libclutter-gst-2.0-0 gstreamer1.0-clutter\n\nBut after running this, I still had the same bug with installing xserver-xorg-dev.\nI decided to try to install xserver using the synaptic package manager, which I'm pretty sure is the point where I messed everything up. I chose to install xserver-xorg-dev, and didn't pay attention to the packages that were going to be removed in the process of the installation.\nSynaptic installed xserver-xorg-dev, removed other packages and finished. I installed 'rgl' in R with no issue.\nWhen I next restarted the laptop, there was no visible cursor and the touchpad didn't work. This thread (Ubuntu 14.04 no cursor after fresh instalation) prompted me to have a look in System Settings, only for me to find out I didn't have unity-control-center anymore. I reinstalled unity-control-center which fixed the cursor issue, but the touchpad is still not responding.\nxinput shows that the touchpad is detected:\n⎡ Virtual core pointer

probably removed a huge portion of your system when you installed the xserver-xorg-dev package. At this point you can either try to fix your current system, or save your files and re-install the whole system. \nAs from my understanding you essentially installed files to support the one package, that overwrite/remove your normal stable operating system.\nSo the problem is not directly related to the touchpad, rather its now your operating system as a whole. Fixing the mouse would be fine, but you might end up with further problems with installing other software that gets confused with your mixed operating system. \nI am pretty trigger happy when it comes to re-installing Ubuntu on my machines, and because you have had the system for 3 years I suggest waiting before completely nuking your setup.

I don't know) amount of time, the whole system just freezes completely, not accepting any command; only hard power off is possible. I think it may be linked to the above, though, since an older laptop of mine experienced similar complete freezes (albeit much more rarely) and the problem disappeared after activating the proprietary drivers (which are unfortunately unavailable for my network card...)\n\nA: I finally managed to find a solution to my problem on the Ubuntu forums:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2303541\nThe proposed solution is for an MSI GT72S 6QE, but the problems it displayed were exactly the same and installing the Git development driver at kvalo.

I am new to Linux and want to restart Ubuntu. Is there a way that I can erase everything, but still keep ubuntu? Somewhat like a factory reset. \n\nA: \nSomewhat like a factory reset.\n\nDid you get Ubuntu with the system? I doubt it so a factory reset will not be there unless you make a backup of your system yourself. You could make one by creating a partition of about 1Gb and putting your current system in there. You need to create an installer from an ISO by adding in all the software you need and then have \"grub\" boot from it. Pretty difficult to do though :)\nIt is far easier to do a full re-install. When you have an SSD as boot disk probably takes a 20 minutes (without the post install script). \n===\nI would do the following (and have been for several years now):\n1 time preparation:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a partition where you store all your personal data.\n\n*Move all normal directories from /home/$USER/ to that partition and edit ~./config/users-dirs.dirs to point to it. Save a copy of that file on your partition.\n\n*on the same partition create a file with all the \"apt-get\" instructions you do post-install. If you remove or add software from the base install toss all those commands in that script.\n\n\nNow a re-install is done by ...\n\n\n*\n\n*formatting / and mounting it \n\n*if you use a /home/ partition formatting /home/ and mounting it \n\n*mount the data partition\n\n*after the install finishes you copy users-dirs.dirs over the original and press f5 on the desktop. \n\n*re-install the software you use from the post-install script you made.\n\n\nA: Simple.  Just do a 100% reinstall from the DVD.  You can download the images from http://www.ubuntu.com/download and select the appropriate image for your system.  You will need to select the \"Erase Ubuntu and install\" option in the installer.\n\nA: As far us i know, there is no factory reset in Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Dual-booting Windows 10 and Ubuntu 14.04.3: safely convert BIOS Ubuntu installation to UEFI I've successfully installed Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS 64-bit on my MSI GE62-2QF (full specs here). As with the norm these days, the laptop came with Windows 10 pre-installed.\nI followed the instructions as usual, but grub does not show up when the laptop is booted. I suspect this is because the laptop is in UEFI mode, and Ubuntu was installed (accidentally) as legacy.\nI'm able to boot into grub if I switch the firmware to use legacy mode, and prioritize the Ubuntu partition when booting. But I want to use grub correctly for both Windows 10 and Ubuntu!\nHow do I get grub to work as usual? I understand I need to convert my Ubuntu installation to UEFI, and that I can use boot-repair to do the conversion. But here are my concerns:\n\n\n*\n\n*I want to use grub as my primary bootloader into both Windows 10 and Ubuntu (i.e. I want to be able to boot into either OS using grub).\n\n*Can I use boot-repair to sort this all out without having to use a separate LiveUSB session? Can I just run boot-repair on my current local Ubuntu installation to do all of this?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: To do what you want, you must install an EFI-mode boot loader for Linux. There are two approaches to doing this that are relatively easy and likely to produce results reasonably reliably, although neither is 100% guaranteed to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot an Ubuntu installer in EFI mode and select the \"try before installing\" option. You can then run Boot Repair, which should detect the EFI-mode installation and install an EFI-mode version of GRUB. This approach will use GRUB, which is what you say you want; however, it's something of a leap of faith -- if Boot Repair gets it wrong, the situation might not improve, or might even get worse. Such errors are rare but they do occur from time to time.\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager, prepare a boot medium, and boot it. (You may need to disable Secure Boot, at least temporarily.) With any luck, rEFInd will enable you to boot both Windows and Ubuntu. If so, boot into Ubuntu and install rEFInd to your hard disk using the rEFInd PPA or Debian package. This approach has the advantage of being more incremental and lower in risk than the Boot Repair approach. It uses rEFInd as its end state rather than GRUB, which is not what you specified -- but I'm not sure if that's because you're a GRUB fan or if you just specified GRUB because that's the Ubuntu default.\n\n\nThere are other ways to achieve the end state of being able to easily boot either OS in EFI mode; in fact, I've written a whole Web page on the options. Those two are the easiest to set up, though. The other options require more effort to set up initially and/or more ongoing maintenance effort.\n\nA: UEFI is how the BIOS is set up, in most of my installations on newer systems I need to switch the BIOS to legacy to allow me to change the operating systems from USB or disc. \nYou said you were able to get to Ubuntu by changing the BIOS settings. Once in Ubuntu run this command:\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis updates grub to recognized the Windows 10 partition and should allow you to change back to normal boot. Optimally you should be able to run the command, restart the system and get put into grub with your two boot options. If it works, restart and change back to UEFI. Things should stay as they were. Goodluck!\n", "Q: Ubuntu runs in Low Graphics mode after modifying Lightdm.conf I wanted to disable the guest login in my Ubuntu 14.04, so I opened the lightdm configuration file using:\nsudo gedit etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\nBut the file was Empty (There were NO lines like [SeatDeafaults] etc.. )\nSo I added following line in that file:\nallow-guest=false\nand saved the config file and restarted my laptop.\nOn restart it ran in low graphics mode.\nSo I was unable to try following to restore it to previous state:\nsudo gedit etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\nAlso, after pressing trl+Alt+F1 at window showing message of \"Low Graphics Mode\", I logged with my credentials and tried\nsudo nano etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\nBut when I tried to save the changes, it was showing the file doesn't exist.\nAlso failsafeX is not working for me.\n\nA: Create bootable USB Drive with Ubuntu using Startup Disk Creator software (which is pre-installed with stock ubbuntu) on another PC/Laptop.\nBoot from this USB drive and select 1st option \"Try Ubuntu without installing\".\nThen Ubuntu Desktop loads up, go to System Settings >> User Accounts.\nCreate an Administrative account Enable it (by clicking on Account Disabled.

After that, I just stop the operation.\nI noticed the above with both PCs but only with some USB sticks. In general the USB filesystem is FAT32 or NTFS. \nHow can I solve this issue?\n\nA: What you're experiencing is the real write speed of cheap MLC USB sticks: The OS starts copying to the cache and then a background process starts copying from the cache to the USB stick.\nOnce the cache is full, the OS can only add to the cache at the effective write speed of the USB stick, so you will see this happening if you copy:\n\n\n*\n\n*a single large file \n\n*a large number of small files.\n\n\nBoth of which exceed your cache. \nThe only thing you can do about this is to use more expensive SLC USB sticks.\n\nA: I solved the problem formatting my USB in exFat filesystem. If your pc doesn't find the drive, you will have to install exfat-fuse & exfat-utilus from Synaptic Package Manager\n", "Q: How to make a command execute once a certain command terminates? What I want to do: Whenever the apt-get install command is run and terminates, run another command immediately without any involvement on the user's part. In my case I want to run a script, but since I can substitute a command for that, a command would be preferable as an example.\nBy the way, I don't want to run a script that executes two commands, since it must then be manually executed, which is not what I want. The termination of the apt-get install command must prompt the execution of another command.\nNOTE: This may seem like a duplicate of this question, and while I do have an answer, I want to make my intention clear in case there are any other possible solutions, while also clarifying my requirements to other potential viewers to this question.\nEdit:\nTo clarify: I am trying to get one command that runs two!\nWhy? I want to generate a file containing a list of all the installed dependencies and software on my distro, which is updated every time the apt-get install command is used.\n\nA: The hard part is parsing the arguments correctly. You can handle simple apt-get install pkgname cases easily, but as soon as you want to handle apt-get -y install pkgname in addition, you suddenly need a full fledged option parser.\nAssuming the simple cases is ok enough, something like this wrapper script may suffice:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n/usr/bin/apt-get \"$@\"\nstatus=$?\n\nif [[ $1 = install ]]; then\n    read -rp 'Run this other thing too [Y/n]? ' ans\n    if [[ ${ans:-y} = [Yy] ]]; then \n        other-thing\n        exit # exit with other-thing's exit status.\n    fi\nfi\n\nexit \"$status\" # exit with apt-get's exit status.\n\n\nA: There's couple of ways, depending on your intention.\nSequential execution can me done with ; separator. It will be done in sequence, each command runs regardless for previous command's exit status. Example:\necho hello; printf \"\\n\\n%s\" WORLD\n\nConditional execution can be done with boolean operators || and &&.\nWith these, execution of the second program, depends on the exit status of first (first and second read left to right).\nFor && the behavior is as such: COMMAND1 && COMMAND2 , if COMMAND1 successfully terminated, COMMAND2 will run. You can remember this as \"if left succeeds, the right will run; if left failed, right won't run\"\n    [ -f /etc/passwd ] && echo \"/etc/passwd exists\"\nFor || it's opposite \"If left succeeds, right won't run; if left fails, right will run\"\n[ -d /etc/passwd ] || echo \"/etc/passwd is not a directory\"\n\nTo put these into one single command, there is couple of options. One obviously is script, but as you requested, you don't want a script. Alternative to that is bash function OR alias.\nBash function is preferred since you can pass arguments to them if you so desire.\nIn your specific case, you want apt-get install which may take multiple parameters\nfunction installStuff\n{\n  apt-get install \"$@\"\n  command2\n}\n\nPlace that into your .bashrc, somewhere at the top, close .bashrc and run source .bashrc. Now you have a bash function that always runs apt-get install first, with any number of packages requested, and then immediately command2\nLike so \ninstallStuff package1 package2 package3\n\nFor conditional running of command2 , use the && and || operators i've already mentioned.\n", "Q: Glade: glib GError when trying to use object attributes I'm using Ubuntu 14.10 but with the lubuntu desktop (LXDE) installed manually. I've designed my Python application's UI using Glade. Everything is working fine as long as I don't use attributes (<attribute>) in the XML file; when I do, I get the following upon a call to add_from_file:\ngi._glib.GError: <input>:18:41 <attribute> requires attribute \"value\"\nLine 18 is simply the first occurrence of the <attribute> tag in the file and looks like this: <attribute name=\"weight\">bold</attribute>.\nMy Python version is 3.4.3.\nWhat can I do to resolve this issue?\n\nA: As the error message says, you have to add an attribute named value.\n<attribute name=\"weight\" value=\"bold\" />\n\nIn your definition\n<attribute name=\"weight\">bold</attribute>\n\nis only one attribute with the name name. The text between the opening and closing tags isn't an attribute.

I booted from a live usb of Ubuntu 15.10 and tried to install it on another 16 gig Transcend flash drive. Made a root and a swap partition.\nI explicity set the bootloader installion to /dev/sdb (16gig Transcend).\nBut after the install, grub got installed on my laptop's hard drive and the system got installed on the flash drive.\nThe drive boots off of my laptop but not any other one. And if I go into the boot menu of my laptop(running windows 8) without inserting the flash drive, it shows an extra grub option, which wasn't there before. So I'm fairly certain that the installer went crazy and installed grub there instead of the flash drive.\nI've tried this at least 5 times now but I get the same thing.\nHow can I fix this? Any and all help is appreciated.\nThank you!\n\nA: From my understanding you want to a fully functional system installed onto the USB that runs on any computer. I haven't heard of anyone doing this outside of the after mentioned Live Boot. The installer is doing its job in creating the system partition on the USB as requested, but the boot loader is installed on the hard system. In other words it is on the computer. \nI do not believe its possible to do want you want. As the primary disc (where your windows is installed) has the boot loader partition, and thus automatically installs grub there. I don't think its possible for a working computer to refer to its normal boot partition, AND a partition created on an external USB. Unless it was setup with the boot partition on the USB in the first place. Which can be done on a system without a pre loaded boot partition.\nYour best bet is to stick with the live boot feature on the USB. \nGoodluck hope this helps, and isn't totally wrong!\n", "Q: Change color of Ubuntu MATE 15.10 As it seems the color green is default color of Ubuntu MATE. Highlighted text is in green, bars are in green, etc... How do I change it to something other?\n\nA: As Muzaffar suggests, you can change the 'Selected items' background color when customizing theme.\nHowever some greens won't disappear only just because of this setting, some GTK+3 objects remain green.\nI followed this post.\nWhat you have to do is to copy /usr/share/themes/Ambiant-MATE to: ~/.themes/Ambiant-MATE (or an other theme, if you want, ex.: Radiant-MATE)\n\nThen inside these files:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*gtk-3.0/gtk-main.css\n  \n*gtk-3.0/settings.ini\n  \n*gtk-2.0/gtkrc\n  \n  \n  Replace #87A752 (Ubuntu MATE's green) with #F17949 (Ubuntu's\n  Orange), and re-log in for changes to take effect.\n\nBut it still wasn't enough for me, because progressbars and checkboxes remained green. Then I found the gtk-3.0/assets folder. There, I had to manually change the color of every single greenish asset with Gimp. I used the Hue-Saturation tool with the following parameters:\nHue: -50\nLightness: 6\nSaturation: 68\n\nThis gave me brownish-orangish items, not quite like the modern default ubuntu orange, but much better than the mate-green. I think it's similar to the old color scheme from the ubuntu 8-era. If you play a bit with that numbers, you might get a better result.\nNote: I'm using Ubuntu Mate 16.04 however it's very likely that it works for 15.10 as well\n\nUpdate\nI simply copied the assets from a normal Ubuntu 16.04 installation. Now, every single control looks the same as in Unity.\nHere you can download both Ambiance and Radiance themes. You have to copy the gtk-3.0/assets folder.\n\nA: From top left corner go to System - Preferences - Appearance. (You can go through Control Center, as well  )\nFrom there go to Themes menu and click on the \"Customize\" button on the lower right corner of the window. \nGo to Colours tab and have fun:\n \n", "Q: Newbie grep question.... output is doubled I have been teaching myself bash scripting and I wanted to write a script that makes a txt file with specific hardware information. I figured that 'grep' would be a great tool for pulling the info I wanted from /proc and other places. \nMy issue is the output is doubled. What am I doing wrong?\n$ grep \"Mhz\" /proc/cpuinfo\ncpu MHz     : 1200.000\ncpu MHz     : 1200.000\n\n$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep \"MHz\"\ncpu MHz     : 1200.000\ncpu MHz     : 1200.000\n\n....I do understand that the commands above will not redirect into my txt file. I am trying to get the command to output what I want before redirecting.\n\nA: You have two CPUs, or at least two cores, or at least two threads. Ubuntu sees these as two distinct processors and /proc/cpuinfo reflects that.\nYou can artificially limit this to only pull the first match:\n$ grep -m1 \"[MG]Hz\" /proc/cpuinfo\nmodel name  : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU         920  @ 2.67GHz\n\nI don't understand the second part of your question. If you want to display that and write it to a file, use tee:\n$ grep -m1 \"[MG]Hz\" /proc/cpuinfo | tee testfile\nmodel name  : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU         920  @ 2.67GHz\n\n$ cat testfile \nmodel name  : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU         920  @ 2.67GHz\n\nIf you just want to write it to a file, just redirect it with >.

Do they share code, or is that just a tradition? Are there any other programs with similar keybindings?\n\nA: Short answer, common historical roots in vi. Their creators were both users of an earlier Unix program, vi.\nHere is a rough diagram to put their initial release dates and influence in perspective:\nvi 1976\n | \\      more 1978\n |  \\     /\n |   \\   /\n |     v\n |   less 1983\n v\nvim 1991\n\nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*vi, 1976\n\n*more, 1978\n\n*less, 1983\n\n*vim, 1991\nVim\nVim, by Bram Moolenaar, is a clone of the Unix program vi. From within vim you can look at the help intro: :help intro, you see:\n\nVim is a text editor which includes almost all the commands from the Unix program \"Vi\" and ...\n\nLess\nWhereas the creator of less, Mark Nudelman explains on his FAQ:\n\nBack in 1983, I was working for a now-defunct company called\n  Integrated Office Systems. Some of our software ran on a Unix system\n  and produced enormous log files of its transactions. We wanted to be\n  able to search these log files for error messages. But the version of\n  \"vi\" we were using couldn't handle files larger than a certain size,\n  and our log files often exceeded that size. So we were forced to use\n  \"more\" to view the files. The problem was, once we found an error\n  message, what we really wanted to see was the transactions leading up\n  to the error; that is, the lines in the log file immediately before\n  the error message. But more didn't allow backward movement in the\n  file.\n\nSo he was already using vi and more when he created less to overcome the limitations of both vi and more at that time.\nWhen you do man less, you see the connection to vi:\n\nCommands are based on both more and vi.\n\nVim and Less\nSo less and vim seem to coincidentally have commands similar to each other, only because, those commands are actually based on vi, which can be seen as their common ancestor.\n", "Q: Where is the actual admin password located? I'm just curious because I know the configuration for the password is located in /etc/passwd, but in the document I don't see my actual password anywhere, obviously for security reasons. I opened passwd- with less in the terminal and it can't be found there either.\nHow does Ubuntu know and read the password you give it?\n\nA: The password is not in /etc/password file in Unix systems ... some decades ago :)\nThe same policy is applied in Linux (Ubuntu too). Your passwords are encrypted in /etc/shadow file, and you need to be root to read the file. The passwords in /etc/shadow are hashed and this is an one-way operation. Ok, you will need (1) the string used for hash operation and (2) the hash algorithm used, and you can will try decrypt the /etc/shadow file (and remember, you will need root permissions for read this file).\nYou can find more details in this answer:\nHow to decode the hash password in ./etc/shadow\n\nA: Passwords are stored in /etc/shadow. They are encrypted. Integrity of /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow can be verified via pwck command:\npwck -r /etc/passwd\npwck -r /etc/shadow\n\nPasswords were once storred in /etc/passwd, but then they were moved to /etc/shadow to restrict access – while /etc/passwd can be read by any user, /etc/shadow is accessible only by root by default.\n", "Q: How to install dogtail script recorder in ubuntu 14?

I am trying to troubleshoot a ssh server connection. The daemon runs fine on a local network but for some reason will refuse a external connection even though the port is forwarded to the router. What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Internet Service Providers quite often block common ports like 22, 80, and the like.  It's possible that your ISP is blocking that port from incoming connections.  Try forwarding a different WAN port to internal port 22.  i.e., have public port 2222 forward to your PC's port 22.  So in effect, on an external machine you would run:\nssh -p 2222 [public_ip]\n\nto get access to your machine from the outside.  Just change the incoming port on the router to 2222 or something else (22222 is even less likely to be blocked).\n", "Q: Anyway to get Brawlhalla(a windows only steam game) to run on Ubuntu?

She said go to 192.168.1.1, login and click connect:-) I was like - if only it were that simple...!\n\nA: Answering my own question for others struggling with this...\nThe issue is grub seeing the USB modem as a second hard drive (/dev/sdb as reported by bootinfoscript) for a few seconds before the modem mode-switches to its final state. Looks like grub thinks someone physically pulled out a hard disk while it was running... or something. And therefore, it hangs.\nTo solve the problem, you've got to make sure grub doesn't see any \"mode-switching\" USB device - in this case the Airtel 4G Wifi LTE broadband modem dongle. The dongle should \"boot up\" completely before grub takes over.\nAll I did was to ensure we spend 30 seconds seeing the BIOS splash screen before letting grub takeover. In that time the USB devices mode-switches to its final state (in the unlikely situation that it doesn't, we're back to square one).\nHow to do it? Enter BIOS setup and set up Hard Disk Pre-Delay of 30 sec. That's it.\nWith this change, I can leave the dongle always connected to the USB port. I don't have go get into Windows if I don't want to.\nThe flip side of this workaround is that boot is 30 seconds longer. I don't mind it.\n", "Q: Auto Remove Safe? I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 and a little new to using it. So every time I install something through either aptitude or apt-get I get this message, as seen bellow. Aptitude won't let me continue installation unless I remove these packages, however, I worked around it using apt-get. Is it safe for me to remove these packages without messing something up?  \nThe following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:\n  gir1.2-totem-1.0 gir1.2-totem-plparser-1.0 libtotem0 linux-headers-3.19.0-25\n  linux-headers-3.19.0-25-generic linux-image-3.19.0-25-generic\n  linux-image-extra-3.19.0-25-generic\nUse 'apt-get autoremove' to remove them.\n\nA: When you install a package and APT needs to install one or more additional packages that you didn't explicitly request because they are dependencies, APT keeps a record that these were \"automatically installed\" - ie, that they were not explicitly requested.\nThe only reason it remembers this, is so that it knows it can automatically remove these additional packages when all the packages that depended on them are also removed.\nUsing apt-get, this is done by either\napt-get remove <mainpackage>\napt-get autoremove\n\nOr, you can tell apt-get to do the autoremove at the same time:\napt-get autoremove <mainpackage>\n\nNote: other APT front-ends such as aptitude can also take advantage of this.\nThe auto-remove statement tells APT to remove any packages that were marked as automatically installed, and no longer have installed packages depending on them.\nIn almost all cases, this operation is safe, because they will most likely be packages you never interacted with directly; only via the other package that depended on them.\nThe only scenario where this may cause a problem is when a package is initially installed automatically without being explicitly requested, but later you begin to start using that package directly.  When you do an autoremove after removing the original package that depended on it, you find that this new package you started using is also gone because it was originally marked as automatically installed.\nThis operation is pretty easy to reverse and is not usually a large problem, and it's a rare scenario.  With apt-get, you can ensure an installed package is never automatically removed by explicitly requesting its installation with\napt-get install <package>\n\nIf that package is already installed, it will remain installed and merely have its \"automatically installed\" status removed.\n", "Q: Installing R and getting error I am getting this error when installing R and did not get it before(was able to download it before but not anymore)\nI would appreciate any help as I am new to Ubuntu.\n Failed to fetch http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/bin/linux/ubuntu/vivid/r-doc-html_3.2.2-1vivid0_all.deb\n Could not resolve 'lib.stat.cmu.edu'\n\n\nA: DNS server might fail to resolve the name lib.stat.cmu.edu.

However, as some of the sites are QA / staging and others are production, I need to do this progressively. That is, I would like the QA sites to go first so I can check that upgrading PHP does not break anything, before rolling out to production. What's the best way to go about this?\nThe sites are all served through Apache and have their own vhost file.\nI'm imagining that I can (somehow) install a new version of PHP at a specific point and through configuration (Apache? vhost?), specify that a site uses this version of PHP (rather than the one at /usr/bin/php).\nThe PHP versions in question are fairly old: I'm upgrading from PHP 5.3 to 5.4 at this point. Although (obviously) I need to get to 5.6 pretty soon. So I'm after a process that I can re-use.\n\nA: You should probably have two or more different servers, one for testing, the other for production, etc.. VPSs are really cheap now, and a VPS based solution would be way easier than this to configure, maintain, update, etc... The principle to keep in mind is called \"KISS\".\nAnyway, back to the question: I would be looking into multiple FPM instances running on the same machine, one for each PHP version. This way it would be just a matter of one line of ProxyPassMatch to switch one site (i.e. vhost) from one PHP version to another. This would allow you to have a single Apache front-end with multiple PHP back-ends.\n(Multiple Apache's on the same machine look like a nightmare to me).\nPhp-fpm is a separate CGI server that runs PHP outside of Apache. If you are still using mod-php, then you should first migrate to fpm and learn how to do proxying with Apache.\nYou would need to build each PHP version from source and install it to a different folder, prepare all the configuration, and create your init scripts. It's not too hard. You can find  an example here (it's nginx based, but that's easy to migrate): http://www.sitepoint.com/run-multiple-versions-php-one-server/\nIf you do it, remember that you will need to keep PHP up to date with respect to security patches, so you will need to allocate time for downloading, recompiling and testing.\n", "Q: Notice of the city during the installation of Ubuntu Can I specify Yegor'yevsk during installation of Ubuntu?\nPlease, Help!\n\nA: From trial and error ..\nIt is simpler to just identify the correct timezone, and nearest major city (or cities), during install.\nThen later, after install, you can search for a closer match.\nNote: If you have already selected the correct country/region then matching your exact city is unnecessary. What is important is the correct timezone/summertime rules for your locality.\n", "Q: How to insert multiple lines with sed I want to add this\n#this \n##is my \ntext\n\nbefore the line\nthe specific line \n\nI tried this \nsed -i '/the specific line/i \\\n#this \n##is my \ntext\n' text.txt\n\nbut it only adds in 'text'.\nI also tried various combinations with \\ and \" \" but nothing worked.\n\nA: With newlines:\n% sed -i '/the specific line/i #this\\n##is my\\ntext' foo\n\n% cat foo\n#this\n##is my\ntext\nthe specific line\n\n\nA: When the replacement string has newlines and spaces, you can use something else.

But how can I detect these names during or before the autoinstall? Or how can I automatically rename the p2p1 interface name to the old eth0 name?\nTo set the static interface settings I use d-i preseed/late_command to overwrite the /etc/network/interfaces file. Right know I assume there is only one interface with the name eth0.\nI tried to overwrite/delete the /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules within the preseed/late_command. But this does not help in any way - it will be ignored.\nHow can I change the interface name to eth0? Or how can I detect the interface name during the autoinstallation, to write the correct name into the network/interfaces file?\nEdit:\nThe replacement now works great (thanks to \"muru\"!)\nThe Interface will initial written from another server and served internal via http wget in the preseed/late_command:\nwget http://{InternalServer}/{path}/interfaces -O /etc/network/interfaces;\n\nin the same line i load an additional replaceinterface.sh script with the content:\n#!/bin/bash\nsDevice=`ip -o link | grep 'link/ether' | grep -oE \"^[[:digit:]]:[[:space:]]([[:alnum:]]+)\" | cut -d\" \" -f 2`\nsed \"s/eth0/$sDevice/g\" $1\n\nAfter loading ,i fire chmod +x, execute it with sh /tmp/replaceinterface.sh < /etc/network/interfaces > /etc/network/interfaces;\nBut then, after installation is done, the /etc/network/interfaces file is empty (?) ...\nIf i do the same steps in another console manualy, during installation, i see the correct output / correct modified file\nBut that seems to be another question for askubuntu.com ..\nEdit²:\nThe Replacement works perfect now - thanks again to \"muru\" !\n#!/bin/bash\nsDevice=`ip -o link | grep 'link/ether' | grep -oE \"^[[:digit:]]:[[:space:]]([[:alnum:]]+)\" | cut -d\" \" -f 2`\nsReplaced=`sed s/eth0/$sDevice/g $1`\necho \"$sReplaced\" > $1\n\n\nA: Network interfaces are not available even during 'late-command'. They are available on the first boot after having done an automated install.\nThis is why 'ip -o link' will be empty if run during a preseed late-command.\nOne way to do this is to create a simple systemd unit that runs after the network is ready, then have that adjust interface names and/or netplan configuration.\nExample basic service that could be dropped into '/etc/systemd/system':\n[Unit]\nDescription=Run Once\nAfter=network-online.target\nRequires=network-online.target\n\n[Service]\nType=simple\nEnvironmentFile=\nExecStart=/root/runonce.pl\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nIn this example I setup a script to run things a single time, to make an easy method for running one or many scripts that you want to run once right after install. The corresponding runonce.pl:\n#!/usr/bin/perl -w\nuse strict;\n\nmy $folder = \"/root/runonce/scripts\";\nmy $donef = \"/root/runonce/done\";\nif( ! -e $donef ) {\n    mkdir $donef;\n}\nmy $outputf = \"/root/runonce/output\";\nif( ! -e $outputf ) {\n    mkdir $outputf;\n}\n\nopendir( my $dh, $folder );\nmy @files = readdir( $dh );\nclosedir( $dh );\n\nfor my $file ( @files ) {\n    next if( $file =~ m/^\\.+$/ );\n    my $full = \"$folder/$file\";\n    my $done = \"$donef/$file\";\n    my $output = \"$outputf/$file\";\n    my $output2 = \"$outputf/$file-error\";\n    if( -e $done ) {\n        unlink $done;\n    }\n    chmod \"0700\", $full;\n    `$full > $output 2> $output2`;\n    rename $full, $done;\n}\n\nIn order to set everything up from preseed, contents for preseed file:\nd-i preseed/late_command string \\\n    in-target wget -P /etc/systemd/system/ http://10.0.2.2:8001/kickstart/runonce.service; \\\n    in-target systemctl enable runonce; \\\n    in-target mkdir /root/runonce/scripts; \\\n    in-target wget -P /root/runonce/ http://10.0.2.2:8001/kickstart/runonce.pl; \\\n    in-target chmod +x /root/runonce/runonce.pl; \\\n    in-target wget -P /root/runonce/scripts/ http://10.0.2.2:8001/kickstart/fixnet.pl\n\nYou'll need to adjust this to have a location to fetch the files from.

I have exported my Unity game and it runs great on my Ubuntu machine.\nI would like to publish the game on the Ubuntu Store, but I have no idea how to do it, and if it is possible at all.

After doing\nsudo timedatectl set-timezone Europe/Copenhagen\ndate and date -u are now in synch.\n(The problem was \"Etc/UTC\" turning around +/-. Not only did setting the timezone solve the date problem. Our conversion issues disappeared as well.)\n\nA: The problem is Etc/UTC, that defines GMT-1 as one hour ahead of Greenwich (so in the east) and GMT+1 as one hour behind (so in the west), doing it in the opposite way as UTC does.\nI refer you to this discussion on Stack Overflow for more detailed explanations.\nSo, I suggest that you change your timezone to UTC+1 or, better, to something like CET, so that you will not have problems with daylight saving time.\nThis is my timedatectl\ntimedatectl \n      Local time: gio 2015-11-26 15:14:20 CET\n  Universal time: gio 2015-11-26 14:14:20 UTC\n        RTC time: gio 2015-11-26 15:14:37\n       Time zone: Europe/Berlin (CET, +0100)\n Network time on: yes\nNTP synchronized: no\n RTC in local TZ: yes\n\n", "Q: Permission not granted for creating file in /home I am new to Ubuntu.

I mounted the Ubuntu ISO image to an 8GB USB through LiLi USB Creator. I partitioned the hard drive and gave Ubuntu 100GB out of the 460GB available.\nThe problem is I have no idea how to access Ubuntu at all.\nI've noticed the USB has the Ubuntu logo and it's renamed itself 'Install Ubuntu' which I definitely didn't do.\nWhen I installed the first time, I reshuffled the BIOS. When the USB boots, I get this menu:\nGNU GRUB version 2.02~beta2-9ubuntu1.3\nTry Ubuntu without installing\nInstall Ubuntu\nOEM install (for manufacturers)\nCheck disk for defects     \nI go through the Ubuntu installer fine, then I'm told I need to restart, which I do.

I have very little knowledge in live USBs (I've only done this with TAILS before). So how can I fix this ? And start using Ubuntu? \nThanks so much in advance ! And sorry if this seems obvious\n\nA: At first glance, this looks like a Boot order issue in your BIOS.\nThe USB Stick you created was needed for installation, but once you installed Ubuntu you don't need to keep it plugged it. So, first thing: remove USB stick. :)\nThe next thing is to change your boot order to 'Ubuntu'. You will need to do this in the BIOS. \nHow to enter the BIOS can change from PC to PC. Sometimes it is hitting DEL when you first start up, sometimes it's F2. Your manufacturer will set that. Another option is to get Windows to go into the BIOS for you. \nPress and hold SHIFT while clicking on RESTART in Windows and follow the prompts (Troubleshoot->UEFI Firmware Settings) \nNow you need to find the Boot menu, and select 'Ubuntu' as the default. \nAs an alternative to select a one-time boot option, a number of PCs have F12 as the key to hit when first starting the computer.\nSee if any of these work.\nIf you are dual-booting (which I am assuming you are, since you only gave 100GB to Ubuntu) then this should bring the GRUB menu to select either 'Ubuntu' or 'Windows'. Once you select 'Ubuntu, you will boot into your Ubuntu installation.\n", "Q: How can I backup/restore Opera browser bookmarks? I was wondering if someone has successfully backed up and restored Opera bookmarks on Ubuntu?\nI dont see any options to do so and I cant find any useful information on the internet either.\nCheers\n\nA: One method is to use an extension for exporting the bookmarks, such as this one (sidebar extension): https://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/v7-bookmarks/. It will create an HTML file which should work with other browsers too.\nThen you can import bookmarks from here: opera://settings/importData (Select \"From: Bookmarks HTML file\").\nAnother method is to do it manually, by going to ~/.config/opera, and copy the file \"Bookmarks\", and later restore it.\n\nA: Today Opera has a sync feature which does an excellent job of managing bookmarks across all devices/platforms - their developer release is my browse of choice \nhttp://www.opera.com/developer\nOpera has really upped their game lately\n", "Q: Can someone harm my computer just using grub? I have passwords for my OS's but can someone actually harm my OS's, without loading them, just using the grub command prompt?\nIs there a way to disable grub command prompt or maybe password protect them?\n\nA: Yes they can; by editing GRUB to boot to single user mode.\nThey can then reset the root password simply by entering passwd. It is then possible to for the attacker to mount file systems and basically, do as they please...\nThis guide provides you with information on locking the GRUB command-prompt with a password: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Passwords\n\nA: DevRobot's answer is the correct answer for the question being asked. I wanted to make you aware (if you weren't already) that grub is probably not what you should worry most about...\nPhysical access is total access (for the most part). Your OS passwords are meaningless if someone throws a flash drive in your computer and boots from it. They don't even need to change your root password - they have their own and can suddenly access all the files on your hard disk. If you're more worried about uptime and stability, then that same person could format your hard disk or make any changes whatsoever from the flash drive that you could do physically logged in. \nThe best value physical security is just to encrypt your hard disk. You won't notice a difference, but access without the disk password is essentially impossible. \n", "Q: Take ownership of files as admin I'm somewhat new to Ubuntu but have been learning a lot on my own.   I am an admin user for my PC.  However, when I try to take ownership of most folders, like usr/local, it says I don't have permission and I'm not able to change any permissions.  It doesnt make any sense because I'm the only one who uses this PC and I'm an admin.  I even tried taking ownership using the terminal with no luck.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  I'm also using Ubuntu 14.0 \n\nA: You can change the ownership of files using the chown command. Run man chown to read the documentation. In short, you can use it as sudo chown USERNAME:GROUPNAME file.\nBUT:\nI would not recommend changing the ownership of file outside your home directory!

Thank you !\n\nA: Sounds like a DNS issue. You most likely setup your external DNS to point to your firewall/router (external IP). Your firewall then does an IP/Port forward to the correct IP on your network.\nFor this to work on your internal network, you will need to do a similar DNS setup. But you need to point the address to your internal IP address.\nYou can do it for your whole network via a DNS server you setup. \nOr if you only need this done for one computer then you can just make an entry into the HOST file of the computer:\n\nsudo nano /etc/hosts\n\nThen type: (according to this format IP HOSTNAME.DOMAIN ALIAS)  \n\nLIP.###.###.### chat.example.com example\n\nLIP = the local ip address of the server you are trying to access\nThen try to ping 'chat.example.com' and see if it points to the right IP.\n\nping chat.example.com\n\nBe mindful that if you use the host file that this will only work on that computer. Any other computer on the network will have to have a similar entry on their host file. If you have many computers trying to access that, then it would be worth considering setting up a DNS server.\n", "Q: How to disable lockscreen in kubuntu 15.10? How can I disable the lockscreen?

As I understand, Compiz can be installed as the compositing-manager on various desktop environments. I am using Ubuntu Studio 15.10 with Xfce 4.12 and I want to install Compiz in its basic configuration just to use simple fading, shadows and maybe the infamous Cube workspace-switcher, however I would like the visuals of my windows to stay as they are.\nSo far, I have only found old tutorials on how to install Compiz on Xfce that are sometimes dated multiple years back and often involve adding additional PPAs or plugins and applications that I do not want to use or can not understand the use of.\nIs it possible to just install and use the Compiz version from the Ubuntu Software Center to get what I am looking for? Or will I still need some additional software to make it compatible to Xfce?\nIt would be great if someone could explain a current way of installing just the basic Compiz functionality or point to an up-to-date website which explains this.\n\n[Edit]: I tried the installation myself and found out what is necessary to set up in the process. If you need a guide, please refer to the answer I posted blow.\n\nA: To answer this question for someone who is looking for the same explanation as myself:\nWhen installing Compiz just by itself, it will use its own built-in gtk-window-decorator, meaning that the window title bars will vanish on the first start without further configuration and if enabling the window decoration, the default blue theme will be used.\nI would advise to install/configure it in the following way without any additional PPAs or external window decorators:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start by deactivating any compositors: In the Xfce options by unticking \"compositing\" in the window management settings or, if installed, by removing custom compositors such as Compton from the startup applications.\n\n*Open a terminal and enter: sudo apt install compiz compiz-plugins compizconfig-settings-manager dconf-editor (The Compiz-Plugins are also needed for additional functionality such as animations and the Cube, dconf-editor for setting up the original Xfce Greybird-theme or another installed theme.)\n\n*Press Alt+F2 and enter dconf-editor to open it, then change the \"theme\"-value to your theme, e.g. Greybird in org\\gnome\\desktop\\wm\\preferences.\nYou may also look for the \"button-layout\" value and move the window buttons to either side here. The value works as such left-button1,left-button2:right-button1,right-button2. So by simply entering the button names (minimize, maximize, close), the window buttons will be situated to either side in order, seperated by a comma.\n\n*Open the CompizConfig Settings Manager from the regular Xfce-settings menu under Extras and at least enable the following plugins: Composite, OpenGL, Window Decoration, Move Window, Resize Window, Place Windows. (You may also want to add such things as Grid for tiling windows and Application Switcher for alt-tabbing windows and so on.) Also make sure that four horizontal workspaces are enabled in the general settings when wanting to use the Cube plugin. To find out what plugins I could/should enable, I used the following sources: How To Set Up Compiz In Xubuntu, Compiz Fusion on Your Desktop: Howto Ubuntu (Video Series), Xubuntu + Compiz = Pretty pretty Xubuntu\n\n*Press Alt+F2 again and enter compiz --replace to find out if everything works correctly before adding it to the Autostart Applications or changing any statup system files. If there are any problems, a simple logout/reboot will deactivate it again.\n\n*You may have to use the command bash -c \"sleep 2; compiz --replace\" in the Autostart Applications, in case it doesn't start with compiz --replace alone. \n\n\n\n[Edit] A few fixes, if you should need them:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you situate a panel with the Whisker Menu at the bottom (Windows-like look), the menu will pop up a few pixels too high when using the Place Windows plugin. Just add a rule in the plugin settings for a fixed window placement for title=Whisker Menu and simply leave all settings on default. \n\n*When using newer GTK+ 3 programs like Gedit or GNOME Disks, Compiz will sometimes draw the window frame incorrectly (square, with space around it). This can be fixed by installing gtk3-nocsd from the official repository and rebooting to force traditional window styling.\n\n", "Q: Manufacturer vs generic printer PPD I'm setting up a new printer on my desktop, and a dialog has opened asking which PPD I want to choose. It says the generic version is recommended, but it also has one from Canon, the manufacturer of my printer. Should I choose the Canon or the generic one? The model is PIXMA MG 6821.\n\nA: There are drivers available for your printer from the manufacturer - I would suggest that you try these first.\nThe drivers for the PIXMA MG 6821 are abailable here.  You want to download the 'debian archive' format.\nAnother post suggests that you may need to install some packages first, although I am unsure why they have chosen the particular installation method that they did.  I would suggest that you should download the driver .deb file to some handy location on your home directories, and open it with 'Ubuntu Software Center'\n", "Q: How to stop display from blanking on Ubuntu Server 15.10?

Download from here, or build from source.\nAnother option is to build liborigin, also gratis & libre (GPLv2). When you run the script like opj2dat ./foo.opj it exports all the data tables to separate plain text files.\nFinally you also could use QtiPlot, but you need the paid \"Pro\" version to actually deal with .opj files...\n", "Q: Why is Ubuntu 15.10 drastically slower than Windows 10? I have a PC that is dual booting W10 and Ubuntu 15.10 and I am noticing a drastic difference in speed between the two.  I was told that Linux is more efficient than Windows and should run faster.  Everything from slow boot times to slow application loading and page switching.  I have Dual Quad core 3.2Ghz machine overclocked to 5.4Ghz with 12 Gigs of ram so the PC shouldnt be the problem.  Any suggestions? I am new to Ubuntu and Linux in general so all help would be appreciated.  \n\nA: Those 2 operating system are impossible to compare. They are fundamentally different. \nTo compare: my Ubuntu has an SSD for the main parts of Ubuntu (/), a re-install is done in under 20 minutes. Booting takes less than 10 seconds (13-ish if there is a filesystem check). I have no problems with speed. Beta versions of Ubuntu tend to be difficult to use on my system (even though my system is no longer that new I always have a bit of problems with hardware).\nWhat you can do is check on the Ubuntu side...\n\n\n*\n\n*the boot process with bootchart. It is native to Ubuntu that uses systemd. Main issues for boot to take longer than needed are not correctly configured hardware. Main issue with those would be your wireless: if the wireless connection errors out it will retry several times and then move on. \n\n*the running system. Commands useful are \"top\",\"htop\",\"powertop\".  All of these show memory usage and things related to it. Check if something is hogging your system.\n\nI was told that Linux is more efficient than Windows and should run faster. \n\nTo me it is but that comment has problems.\n\"Efficient\" is a matter of knowing what to do when you want something done. That is something that takes time to get to learn. \"Faster\". Yes in my opinion it is. At work my older notebook boots a lot quicker with Ubuntu (14.04) than my newer desktop does using Windows 7. \n", "Q: Dependency problem when installing Kernel 4.2.6 on NUC computer running Trusty I installed Linux kernel 4.2.6 to get wifi working on a 3165 device on a NUC5 computer running Trusty new install.

I went through the link http://pythonhosted.org/juju-deployer/config.html#placement but have difficulty in understanding it). It is part of the yaml bundle for deploying openstack.\nkeystone:\nannotations:\n  gui-x: '500'\n  gui-y: '0'\ncharm: cs:trusty/keystone-31\nnum_units: 1\noptions:\n  admin-password: openstack\n  ha-mcastport: 5403\n  openstack-origin: cloud:trusty-liberty\nto:\n- lxc:3\n\n\nA: Let's have a look at your bundle. First of all, we need to ensure that we're both looking at the same file; from searching your config on Google I think I'm looking at: \n\n\n*\n\n*https://jujucharms.com/openstack-base/bundle/38/\n\n*https://api.jujucharms.com/charmstore/v4/bundle/openstack-base-38/archive/bundle.yaml\n(Please edit your question with the exact files you are deploying, it would help remove ambiguity)\nAt the end of every page of the charm store there is a list of each config option for every charm, so let's look at Keystone:\nYou can safely ignore the annotations segment, all that is is X/Y coordinates of where to put the icon in the Juju GUI.\n\n\n*\n\n*charm: cs:trusty/keystone-31 : This breaks down to \"Revision 31 of the trusty (14.04) charm that is in the charm store.\"\n\n*num_units: This means you'll get 1 unit of Keystone. That means either one container or machine (which we'll see is defined later).\n\n\nOk, now the good bits, the options, these first two are pretty straightforward:\n\nadmin-password: (string) Admin password. To be used for testing\n  only. Randomly generated by default.\nha-mcastport: (int) Default multicast port number that will be used\n  to communicate between HA Cluster nodes.\n\nThis entry is ugly due to formatting, so I'll replicate it here: \n\nopenstack-origin: (string) Repository from which to install. May be >one of the following: \ndistro (default),\nppa:somecustom/ppa, a deb url sources entry, or a supported Cloud\n  Archive release pocket. \nSupported Cloud Archive sources include:\n  cloud:-\n  cloud:-/updates\n  cloud:-/staging\n  cloud:-/proposed \nFor series=Precise we support cloud archives for openstack-release: *\n  icehouse For series=Trusty we support cloud archives for\n  openstack-release: * juno * kilo * ... \nNOTE: updating this setting to a source that is known to provide a\n  later version of OpenStack will trigger a software upgrade. NOTE: when\n  openstack-origin-git is specified, openstack specific packages will be\n  installed from source rather than from the openstack-origin\n  repository. distro\n\nI get the feeling you want to keep that as a default for now.\nHere's where I think you're asking for clarification (please edit your question if this is not the case): \nto:\n- lxc:3\n\nOk, so what does that mean? Well let's look at the top of the bundle:\nmachines:\n  '0':\n    constraints: arch=amd64\n    series: trusty\n  '1':\n    constraints: arch=amd64\n    series: trusty\n  '2':\n    constraints: arch=amd64\n    series: trusty\n  '3':\n    constraints: arch=amd64\n    series: trusty\n\nIn this section we are declaring the machines on the cloud, that means we are asking for 0-3 machines, for a total of 4. Each part of that bundle has a to: section. That means we are telling Juju exactly where you want a unit to go. \nIn this case to: lxc:3 means, put keystone in an LXC container on machine number 3. \nAs another example, look at where we put Ceph:\n to:\n    - '1'\n    - '2'\n    - '3'\n\nThere's no lxc: there, that means, no container, just put ceph on machines 1,2, and 3. And let's look at `ceph-radosgw:\n to:\n    - lxc:0\n\nThat means put ceph-radosgw on machine 0, in a container.\nSo why do we do this? Well, some services don't need to be everywhere, it depends on the use case, if you want a denser cloud then this bundle is probably what you want. If you're testing out openstack then getting an operational prototype on four machines is desirable. If you want to go with larger capacity, then you can feel free to edit the bundle, remove all the to: statements you see, and Juju will just ask MAAS for one machine per service; this will take up more machines though.\n", "Q: Chrome running slow in fullscreen mode (not Flash related) Got a new Intel NUC running Ubuntu 14.04.

Complicated, please read Allright, so as is says in the title, I'm not an expert. So I'm going to explain everything that I've done, and what I'm trying to do.\nOne day, I decided to build a low-end gaming computer, for use with games such as World of Tanks. One of my budget cuts was to use a laptop's hard drive with its copy of Windows 7 as my OS. As you could imagine, it started complaining that \"Windows isn't genuine\" so, after some time, I bought a HDD for my desktop, and went about installing windows on it. Now, this is where it gets confusing...\nI attempted to install windows using an .exe file my friend offered me on a flash drive. It appears to be the same thing that Microsoft offers on one of their recovery pages. The closest reference to what I have is found in this forum. (Hoping that helps, I can't describe it myself unless I were to paste the files here somehow.)\nBefore installing, I had to activate the new drive,and formatted it as a Primary, NTFS. During the installation, my computer rebooted several times. After the third reboot, I was presented a brand-new windows 7 desktop. The original Windows 7 data was preserved, although (obviously) not in this copy of the OS. (I can still boot to the \"Laptop\" windows 7 with everything on it.)\nIt's worth noting that to boot into this \"new windows,\" I had to select \"windows 7\" from the windows bootloader. It showed two windows 7's, one was the one on the laptop drive, and the other (here's my noob skillz in coding explanation attempt) linked to the separate HDD. \nNow, my master plan was to return the laptop drive back to the laptop. And that's what I did. Having some driver issues on the laptop, but that's to be expected, and dealt with later. I attempted to boot back into the separate HDD, only to find that there is not bootloader anymore. \nSo there's my obvious dilemma. I am currently running on the same built desktop, with an old HDD with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on it, and that's where this comes in. I want to have this Linux OS dual booted with my Windows OS, but on separate HDD; I.e. Windows on HD1 and Ubuntu on HD2.\nI've been looking for a way to modify the GRUB bootloader to allow me to select OS's and boot into windows, but (I'm assuming) because the MBR that allows me to boot to my \"new windows\" is on the laptop drive, Ubuntu's GRUB doesn't know there's an OS on my new drive. (Please remember, the Laptop drive is no longer plugged into the system. The system has the Ubuntu drive and the New Windows drive.)\nSo, finally, here's my question: What should I do? What can I do? Any help would be greatly appreciated! (I would rather not use a windows 7 installation CD, just because I'd have to wait for it to get here, so anything info I can do with my current hardware is appreciated.)\nI should note that I am not afraid to repeatedly open up my desktop and switch cables around; I am mostly limited by my 2 SATA data cables, currently shared between my 2 HDD's and my disk drive. \n\nA: Sounds like you moved your bootloader with that old laptop drive you put back into the laptop.\nThe one way I can think of to fix this is to CHROOT into your Ubuntu installation with a Live USB/CD. Then fix/install your bootloader.\nCHROOT:\nYou will need to have a bootable CD or USB stick of Ubuntu to boot up your computer to. Select \"Try Ubuntu before installing\" to boot into the Live environment.\nOnce booted, start a Terminal window and type:\n\nsudo blkid | grep ext4\n\nThis will list all partitions (and I am hoping you didn't change the default installation suggestions) and the 'grep' filters out all entries without 'ext4' in the line. This should show you the harddrive/partition you need to mount. \nVerify that it is the right partition/drive:\n\ndf -Th | grep ext4\n\nNext mount the partition into the Live environment:\n\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt\n\n.. where '/dev/sdXY' is the partition you found to be the right one in the blkid command.\nGet the chroot environment ready by mounting all the necessary folders:\n\nfor i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run; do sudo mount -B $i /mnt$i; done\n\nOnce you have mounted the folders, you can chroot into the old desktop drive to fix your boot loader:\n\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\nNow fix your bootloader by installing and updating it:\n\ngrub-install /dev/sdX \n\nNote that this is '/dev/sdX' and not '/dev/sdXY'. You don't want the bootloader in the partition, you want it on the drive (ie. /dev/sda). \nNext, create the Grub menu:\n\nupdate-grub\n\nIf there are no errors, you should now have install your dual-booting GRUB menu. If everything seems ok, type 'exit' and reboot.\n", "Q: Problem in installing packages in R In R, I am trying to run -\ninstall.package('rattle')\n\nbut terminal gives me following error -\nError in .chooseMirror(m, \"CRAN\", graphics, ind, useHTTPS) : \ncould not find function \"setNames\"\n\nR version - 3.2.2\nUbuntu - 14.04 LTS\nHow to solve this error?\nMaybe because I had few problems during installation of R-base -\nFrom Command Line, It would only install 3.0.2, but not 3.2.2.\nHence, I installed R-3.2.2 from Ubuntu software centre.\nFrom Software centre, it would not install r-base, and give following ERROR :\nPackage dependencies cannot be resolved\nhe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n\nr-base: Depends: r-base-core (>= 3.2.2-1trusty0) but 3.2.2-1trusty0 is to be installed\nDepends: r-recommended (= 3.2.2-1trusty0) but 3.0.2-1ubuntu1 is to be installed\n\nSo after that, from software center I tried first installing r-base-core-1trusty0, and then r-base-1trusty0.\nIt worked and I had R-3.2.2 installed in system.\nWhile installing a package from R, by install.packages(), It ask me to choose a mirror.

This is to some extent the same problem as time zones (every one has the same \"epoch seconds\" count, the TZ just says how it is formatted for output).\nYou have to find a \"locale\" that supports Buddhist dates (or create one). Then you PC will be compatible with the rest of the world (can still be kept synchronized by NTP servers, can exchange files with others, etc...). \nPS: As proof , these locales are defined as part of UTS#35 and indeed exist in Java for some variant of the Thai locale. For Linux, you may have to roll your own for the time being.\n", "Q: Boot into emergency mode because of nouveau: Error parsing PCC subspaces from PCCT I installed kubuntu 15.04 and upgraded it to 15.10.

I visualize this file with evince and want to print it in greyscale rather than in colour. Therefore, I activate the instruction to \"print colour as gray\" in the printer dialogue window. \nIn disregard of my settings, the preview of evince itself is in colour and so is the print. (Moreover, this occurs regardless of whether I set gray printing as default in the printer settings upstream of evince.)\nThis issue is recent is my computer. Previously there was a perfect correspondence between evince, its printer dialogue settings and the printer response. \nBeside the regular Ubuntu updates, the only change that I can obviously connect this new situation to is the driver upgrade from HPP00036.PPD v 19.10 to HPP0053.PPD v 19.12. \nThis issue is not new to HP printers, though. This post suggests to add the same printer once again, but this does not work for me. I get a responsive colour/greyscale toggle only if I install my printer as a M577 model instead of M277 (thereby giving in the duplex printing capabilities). This indicates that the glitch has to do with the driver devised for this specific model.\nIn the internet it's possible to find similar complaints on HP printers in Windows environments as well.\nI would like to restore a normal state of affairs. \n\n\n*\n\n*Has anyone had a similar experience? \n\n*Is the HP driver the actual culprit? \n\n*Is there a proven solution strategy to fix this? \n\n\nAddendum 11/12/15\nThe screenshot below shows the job attributes of one print that I intended to print in grayscale and was printed in colour instead. The line `HPPJLColorAsGray yes' is apparent. Even worse, the document is printed in high resolution, ignoring the EconoMode setting too. \n\n\n*\n\n*Does anyone spot a fault that could invalidate these settings? \n\n\n\n\nA: This is actually a workaround. If I add the existing printer HP Color LaserJet MFP M277dw once again as a new device and then claim that it is a Color LaserJet MFP M476, I obtain an interface enabling duplex printing and with a responsive colour/greyscale toggle. Not so for (some) other drivers of the same family, inclusive the very M277 as seen.\nAlso, it was interesting to observe that the driver for MFP 577 is still being recommended for a MFP M277 gadget. So one would be induced to oversee the driver for M277 that does exist, however glitchy, down the list.\nIn order to add a new printer (Ubuntu 14.04), go to System Settings -> Hardware/Printers and click on the Add button at the top left of the menu bar. \nIn my case the printer was already on and connected via the USB port. It might take a little time before the system scan the devices connected. Then the printer got recognized with its own true name. The rest is intuitive. The point of choice is a few steps later when you select the driver that actually works via the model name.\n", "Q: Can't mount my Ubuntu partition from Live USB I was trying to recover grub after Windows 10 installation.\nI tried BootRepair from Ubuntu Live USB, but nothing happened.\nSo I went to the manual way, but when I tried to mount my Ubuntu partition  with\nsudo mount /dev/sda4 /mnt\n\nI got the following error\nmount: /dev/sda4 is not a valid block device\n\nWhat happened?\nWindows 10 installation has corrupted my Ubuntu partition?\nThank you very much\nUpdate1:\nI run lsblk (thanks to the_Seppi) and this is the command output\nNAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\nsda      8:0    0 298.1G  0 disk \n├─sda1   8:1    0   100M  0 part \n├─sda2   8:2    0  97.7G  0 part \n├─sda3   8:3    0 121.5G  0 part \n├─sda4   8:4    0     1K  0 part \n└─sda5   8:5    0   7.6G  0 part [SWAP]\nsdb      8:16   1   7.5G  0 disk \n└─sdb1   8:17   1   7.5G  0 part /cdrom\nsr0     11:0    1  1024M  0 rom  \nloop0    7:0    0   1.1G  1 loop /rofs\n\nIn addition, this is my fdisk -l\nDevice     Boot     Start       End   Sectors   Size Id Type\n/dev/sda1  *         2048    206847    204800   100M  7 HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda2          206848 205006847 204800000  97.7G  7 HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda3       205006848 459859967 254853120 121.5G  7 HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda4       459864062 625141759 165277698  78.8G  5 Extended\n/dev/sda5       609142784 625141759  15998976   7.6G 82 Linux swap / Solaris\n\n/dev/sda4 must be my Ubuntu partition, because I can exclude each other.\nBut that 1k size in lsblk output seems that something went really really wrong!  \n\nA: TL;DR: There is no Ubuntu installed on your computer or the partition table is incomplete or broken.\n\nIn your partition list, sda4 is listed as an extended partition. This means that it doesn't actually work as a \"real\" partition, but as a container for subpartitions. This is done because MBR disks can only have 4 primary partitions. By doing so, one can create more than 4 partitions by creating subpartitions inside the extended partition.\nAlso, your partition list, you can see where your partitions start and end. Your extended partition starts at sector 459864062 and ends at sector 625141759.\nAs you can see, there is only one partition with its boundaries between those two values: The Swap partition, which is 7.6GiB in size and is located at the very end of the extended partition. All other partitions are outside this range.\nSo you have 3 primary NTFS partitions and one extended partition, which only contains a Swap partition. There is no partition which can hold a Linux installation; you don't have Ubuntu installed on your computer. \nOr you do and the Windows installer erased the partition form the partition table; in this case you should be able to recover the partition entry, e.g. with the instructions given here\n\nA: Ok, I solved with TestDisk - http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk .\nIt detected my Linux partition (there was, damn you Windows!) and setting it as Primary and bootable recovered both my Ubuntu installation and Grub boot selection.\nThank you very much!\n", "Q: Impossible to uninstall certain apps in ubuntu phone? I recently bought a bq smartphone ubuntu edition, and I was surprised to see so many pre installed apps that I don't want to use. Some of them are apparently easy to remove, by going to the ubuntu store.\nBut there is something that I don't manage to do. I'm in the Apps scope, and slide the screen upwards. Then, I see a screen with a list of the active scopes named \"Home\", and a second list named \"Also Installed\". In this list I see many apps that I don't manage to find in the ubuntu store, and therefore I cannot uninstall. For instance, 7 digital, Amazon, cnet, ebay... many of them. \nBut I'm not sure that the procedure of uninstalling them from the ubuntu store is really working: If I go to Settings->About this phone->Storage, I see a detailed list of the apps that are using memory in my phone. In this list there are some apps that I previously uninstalled using the ubuntu store procedure. For instance, BBC, BBC sport, facebook,facebook photos, Gmail... and many more are still using memory in my phone.\nMy question is: How can I really get rid of these apps that I don't want to have? I would like not to dedicate a single bit of space to those apps\n\nA: I am not sure, but I try to share what I know about the 'also installed' secion:\nIf you swipe up in apps view, you can manage your scopes, not you apps. You can select there which scopes are placed to the right of your apps view.\nRemember a scope is something like a search engine, which can be accessed by swiping from right to left in apps view.\nMany scopes can be installed over the appsStore.

I thought about version control, but I'd rather stick to something simple and more straightforward.\n\nA: You can use Back In Time to create snapshots. All snapshots (and also the live filesystem) can be compared by selecting the file/folder you are interested in and using View > Snapshots. Select the second snapshot to compare and press Diff. This will open a Side by Side view (using Meld) of both snapshots/live fs.\nI'm member of BIT Dev-Team\n\nA: There are a few different approaches to this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a sync or backup tool (such as one that uses rsync, such as backintime) to make backups of your system, and restore from those - rsync can quickly sync only the files with differences.\nSome such tools may even be designed for uses such as yours, ie they assist in the process of keeping backups of files from specific times.\nWith this approach however you can't be guaranteed an atomic snapshot of the whole volume at once, ie if you run it on a live system you can't guarantee that all files backed up will come from the same time instance.\n\n*Use an alternative filesystem that supports live snapshots, like btrfs.  There are filesystem-specific commands to create a snapshot with btrfs and you can read from that.  Snapshots are atomic and you can even manage multiple snapshots.\nbtrfs is not the only Linux filesystem that has this functionality, but it's probably the most general example.\nThis functionality is equivalent to Windows Volume Shadow Copy, which they integrated into NTFS.\n\n*Use an alternative storage medium or block layer that supports live snapshots.  LVM can do this.  You could use RAID 1 mirroring for this but it would be slow each time you remove a drive from the array and then replace it.\nThe drawback to an approach like this is you'd probably need an extra drive.\n", "Q: .cpp and .h files of new classes are not showing in Ubuntu SDK tree I've added new classes to my project via Ctrl-N >> C++ >> C++ Class.\nHowever, after the files are added to my models/my-project folder, it does not show up on the tree in Ubuntu SDK.\nWhy is this?

I want to install Go-Servre on my Ubuntu 14.04and I'm following this doc \nhttp://www.go.cd/documentation/user/current/installation/install/server/linux.html#debian-based-distributions-ie-ubuntu\nAccording to the doc this is the procedure:\n$ echo \"deb http://dl.bintray.com/gocd/gocd-deb/ /\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gocd.list\n$ wget --quiet -O - \"https://bintray.com/user/downloadSubjectPublicKey?username=gocd\" | sudo apt-key add -\n$ apt-get update\n$ apt-get install go-server\n\nHowever, I have problem in first line when I run the command and I get following reply:\n$ echo \"deb http://dl.bintray.com/gocd/gocd-deb/ /\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gocd.list\nbash: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gocd.list: Permission denied\n\nI even tried to change the permission but still I'm getting error:\n$ sudo chmod +x  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gocd.list\n[sudo] password for hesam: \nchmod: cannot access ‘/etc/apt/sources.list.d/gocd.list’: No such file or directory\n\nAny idea would be appreciated. Thanks.\n\nA: You should run the first (echo ...) command as a privileged user. So first switch to root by sudo su, then run the echo command.\nDoing sudo echo ... will not work, as the > redirection will be done before sudo is executed.\n\nA: Permission is denied because you are trying to create a file in a privileged location. And sudo echo doesn't work. However, there is a way to work around this problem.\nYou can use either of the following commands to accomplish the first step:\necho \"deb http://dl.bintray.com/gocd/gocd-deb/ /\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gocd.list\n\nor\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"deb http://dl.bintray.com/gocd/gocd-deb/ /\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gocd.list'\n\n", "Q: Computer slows down I am running latest Ubuntu having upgraded (twice now I think).

To check try to connect to it via a web browser. After connecting the camera to your WiFi network, first find the camera's IP by:\nnmap -sP 192.168.0.\\*\n\n(you might be on different network than 192.168.0.*, check with ifconfig). If you aren't sure it's a right IP look for the MAC address D8:49:2F:98:3F:04 you found in the settings by running command arp:\narp <some IP found by the nmap -sP>\n\ne.g. arp 192.168.0.1.

A new super-cheap version of the Raspberry Pi was recently announced. I'd like to stuff these all over my house doing cool nonsense.\n\nMy question is, will I be able to use Ubuntu on them?\n\nA: No, not on the Zero v1\nThe Raspberry Pi Zero runs the same architecture processor as the first RasPi, an ARMv6 arch ARM11. It's clocked faster than the original but it's not the ARM Cortex-A7 that the Raspberry Pi 2 has.\nUbuntu's ARM CPU support starts at the ARMv7 architecture.\nYou could recompile everything for ARMv6 but it literally would mean compiling and repackaging everything. It would be far more practical to just use Raspbian. This is a Debian redistribution that targets the original Raspberry Pi. Because it's Debian, it's technically very similar to Ubuntu.\nUbuntu's limited ARM support also means that Launchpad doesn't support ARMv6 so you won't be able to use Ubuntu PPAs either (unless they are naturally arch-independent, which some are).\n\nLater hardware versions have different CPUs on, v2 can run 32bit Ubuntu currently, though that is not what this question deals with.\n\nA: YES for Raspberry pi zero 2\nFrom this page https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi\nUbuntu Server 21.10\n\nUbuntu core\n\n", "Q: Filesystem is unknown for all of the partitions in grub rescue and I can't boot from a DVD I installed Ubuntu to dual boot with windows a few days ago.

I locked a users password with passwd --lock [userName], the man page and this answers tells me, that a locked password doesn't prevent other means of logins (e.g.: ssh key-based).\nQuote from man passwd\n\n-l, --lock\n            Lock the password of the named account. This option disables a password by changing it to a value which matches no\n             possible encrypted value (it adds a ´!´ at the beginning of the password).  \nNote that this does not disable the account.\n  The user may still be able to login using another authentication token (e.g. an SSH key).\n  ...\n\nThe last quoted sentence, tells me, that it won't affect ssh key-based login, but for my system it does. The user is no longer allowed to login via ssh with his private key.\nWhat conclusion should I draw here:\n\n\n*\n\n*The man page and the linked answers (as all other found online material) is wrong about the ssh-key-exception. And I should open a Bug-Report for the man entry (aka even rtfm is not valid in all cases).\n\n*The sentence includes a \"may\", so therefore I read the wrong manual or not the full manual and somewhere it is stated, that in some circumstance ssh honors the locked password flag and prevents locked user from login (aka rtfm is valid and I am to stupid to look into the right places).\n\n\nAs I am fallible, I guess the second conclusion is the right one. If so, could someone please point me the docs/connections/etc that I missed and which would explain the observed behavior?\n\nA: The openssh daemon/service has picked up that the account is locked and has disabled access.   (password field starts with !)\nThe man page for \"sshd\" indicates:-\nRegardless of the authentication type, the account is checked to ensure that it is accessible. An account is not accessible if it is locked, listed in DenyUsers or its group is listed in DenyGroups . The definition of a locked account is system dependant. Some platforms have their own account database (eg AIX) and some modify the passwd field ( \"LK\" on Solaris and UnixWare, \"*\" on HP-UX, containing \"Nologin\" on Tru64, a leading \"LOCKED\" on FreeBSD and a leading \"!\" on most Linuxes). If there is a requirement to disable password authentication for the account while allowing still public-key, then the passwd field should be set to something other than these values (eg \"NP\" or \"NP\").\n", "Q: I am not allowed to view Ubuntu Forums.

First i did pwd, it says:\n/home/user\n\nI changed my directory using :\ncd /Italic/Food/Places\n\nNow, I want to go back to original directory: /home/user. How can I do this?\n\nA: cd - returns to the previous directory. \nIf you want to go to home dir specifically, use cd, cd $HOME, or cd ~.\n\nA: To cd to the previous directory, you can use one of the following commands in bash:\ncd -\ncd \"$OLDPWD\"\n\nTo cd to your home directory, use one of:\ncd\ncd ~\ncd \"$HOME\"\n\nIf you want to undo multiple cds, cd can't help you. You'll have to use the pushd and popd commands. Instead of cd foo/bar, do\npushd foo/bar\n\nThen you can use the popd command to undo as many times as you have used pushd.\nExample:\n/tmp/lightdm-1.10.5 $ pushd ~\n~ /tmp/lightdm-1.10.5\n~ $ pushd devel\n~/devel ~ /tmp/lightdm-1.10.5\n~/devel $ popd\n~ /tmp/lightdm-1.10.5\n~ $ popd\n/tmp/lightdm-1.10.5\n/tmp/lightdm-1.10.5 $\n\nAlso see:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I use the pushd and popd commands?\n\nA: cd ~ will work. ~ is basically a shortcut for /home/user.

So I wrote a function that gets the package name as input and using dpkg checks if it is installed and prints an appropriate output.

But when it is not installed, it somehow doesn't redirect the output to /dev/null and prompts:\ndpkg-query: no packages found matching foo-bar\n\nIn a second attempt, I modifed the body of function to use it with grep -q:\ncheck_dependency() { \n    dpkg -s $1 | grep -q 'installed'\n    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n        # print something saying it is installed\n    else\n        # print something saying it was not found\n    fi\n}\n\nWhen the package is installed, again it seems to work fine, however, when package is not found and unwanted message from dpkg appears on terminal:\ndpkg-query: package 'foo-bar' is not installed and no information is available bla bla...\n\nUsing directly dpkg-query results in similar problem. How to make it silent when it fails to find package? \n\nA: You want to redirect both standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) to /dev/null.  To do this, replace > with &>.  This is a shortcut specific to bash.  So your code would be:\ncheck_dependency() { \n    dpkg -l $1 &> /dev/null\n    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n        # print something saying it is installed\n    else\n        # print something saying it was not found\n    fi\n}\n\nHowever, this would still count a package as being installed if it had been removed but config files remained (as pointed out by @A.B.).  Instead, you could try\ncheck_dependency() { \n    # Get the number of packages installed that match $1\n    num=$(dpkg -l \"$1\" 2>/dev/null | egrep '^ii' | wc -l)\n\n    if [ $num -eq 1 ]; then\n        # print something saying it is installed\n    elif [ $num -gt 1]; then\n        # print something saying there is more than one package matching $1\n    else\n        # print something saying it was not found\n    fi\n}\n\n\nA: Using dpkg -l $1 and checking the return code says nothing about the installation status of a package.\nUse awk and dpkg -l and check the status ii\ndpkg -l | awk '/^ii +'\"$1\"' +/'\n\n\nExample\n$ package=\"mc\"\n$ dpkg -l | awk '/^ii +'\"$package\" +' /'\nii  mc      3:4.8.13-3      i386       Midnight Commander - a powerful file manager\n\n$ package=\"foobar\"\n$dpkg -l | awk '/^ii +'\"$package\" +' /'\n<returns nothing>\n\nor\n$ package=\"mc\"\n$ dpkg -l | awk '/^ii +'\"$package\"' +/ {print $2}'\nmc\n\n", "Q: Removing popup notifications on Spotify Ubuntu This is the issue (and solution) I'm talking about:\nRemove spotify pop-up notification when a song starts\nHowever in terminal when I run the first command I receive a Permission denied error...any way I can get around this ?\nThanks !\n\nA: It's not a command.\n\nthen edit ~/.config/spotify/Users/[Spotify user name]-user/prefs [...]\n\nIt's asking you to edit a file.

Everything worked flawlessly. I removed the USB stick and booted from the SSD, perfect. I started installing my applications and suddenly strange things started to happen. The Launcher disappeared and the visual output was not what I expected. Eventually the whole system hung. I tried to reboot and nothing happened - blue screen.\nI thought there may be some driver issue and decided to try Ubuntu 15.10, just in case there was some updated driver there that would solve my problem. I was able to boot from the 15.10 stick and started the Ubuntu installation. When it got to the stage of formatting the drives, no drives appeared in the menu. I had no choice but to exit the installation process. Now I am not able to boot from the USB or the SSD, even to run Ubuntu from the USB (Panic not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount Root FS on unknown block(1,0)). \nNow when I look in Intel's VisualBios, under Devices > SATA, it shows Sata Port [not installed] and M.2 Sata [not installed]. I tried re-seating the SSD just in case, but to no effect.\nIt looks like something has gone wrong with my hardware(?), but is it the SSD that's broken or the NUC itself?

I know Ubuntu has a distribution which is for server purposes (Ubuntu Server Edition). But:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it necessary to use Ubuntu Server Edition?\n\n*Will working on Ubuntu only works?\n Please shade some lights about Prerequisites About Ubuntu Server Installation\n\nA: If you are looking for just using ubuntu for a server then it would be wise to use ubuntu server edition. If you are looking to do other stuff including using a server, you can install ubuntu desktop. It is not necessary to use ubuntu server for a server.\nIf you going to use ubuntu desktop, then using this tutorial, you can get a server up and running.\n\nA: Server will not ask you if you want autologin, will not allow easy connection to WiFi via Unity and Network Manager. You will be working in linux virtual terminal, installing Xorg, setting things up yourself. I recently installed Server and noted those things. It was like if I had to restore Xorg myself, and configure Network Manager via command line. That's fine thing to do, I had Server before and it was fine, but now I placed the netbook in such a place that it's hard to sit in front of it :) And without instant WiFi connection SSH wasn't an option.

I could not click anything but every now and then the Num and Caps lock would blink rapidly when it would \"part-way\" freeze.\n\nA: This is possibly a problem with your browser. Try using something else, or use 'wget'. Also, look through the kmesg logs for possible issues related to the kernel. \n", "Q: Much more verbose /var/log/* I remember the times when probably literally every log message was being put into /var/log/messages and /var/log/syslog. It was year 2000 if someone's curious. Now it is different. Log files are supposed to be in order but instead  they IMO just lack entries. In my perception 90% of problematic situations are just silent, no way to find anything in /var/log files.\nHow to have /var/log/messages back and have it really verbose?\n\nPS. As an example. When I install vsftpd and do:\nsudo restart vsftpd\n\nthen what goes into syslog is following line:\nkernel: [ 7167.143648] init: vsftpd main process (5823) killed by TERM signal\n\nThat's the only effect of restarting a FTP server. Think of it – is it possible that vsftpd doesn't output any banner on startup? It's hard to believe to me.\nAlso, the log comes from kernel, it is dmesg that is catching this. That's ridiculous. If kernel would not catch the TERM signal there would be no trace in logs about restart of FTP daemon. This is the case when proftpd is restarted via /etc/init.d/proftpd. No trace in logs except for /var/log/proftpd/proftpd.log which is proftpd's own log file configured by SystemLog option.\n\nPS2: I attach results from Virtual Linux, probably the first live CD created, based on Mandrake, from year 2001 (kernel 2.4.3-20mdk). Restarting proftpd yields there (in /var/log/messages):\nproftpd[2699]: ProFTPD killed (signal 15)\nproftpd[2699]: ProFTPD 1.2.2rc1 standalone mode SHUTDOWN\nproftpd: proftpd shutdown succeeded\nproftpd[2730]: ProFTPD 1.2.2rc1 (release) (built Sun Apr 8 09:53:35 CEST 2001) standalone mode STARTUP\nproftpd: proftpd startup succeeded\n\nOn 14.04 syslog is empty and following is logged into proftpd.log.\nproftpd[1326] asus-1201N: ProFTPD killed (signal 15)\nproftpd[1326] asus-1201N: ProFTPD 1.3.5rc3 standalone mode SHUTDOWN\nproftpd[2620] asus-1201N: ProFTPD 1.3.5rc3 (devel) (built Fri Dec 20 2013 18:04:47 UTC) standalone mode STARTUP\n\nOn VLinux following is logged into messages when sshd is restarted:\nsshd[2821]: Received signal 15; terminating\nsshd: sshd shutdown succeeded\nsshd[2924]: Server listening on 0.0.0.0 port 22.\nsshd[2924]: Generating 768 bit RSA key.\nsshd: sshd startup succeeded\nsshd[2924]: RSA key generation complete\n\nOn 14.04 syslog is empty, and following is logged into auth.log (why there?):\nNov 28 09:11:22 asus-1201N sshd[2500]: Received signal 15; terminating.\nNov 28 09:11:22 asus-1201N sshd[2634]: Server listening on 0.0.0.0 port 22.\nNov 28 09:11:22 asus-1201N sshd[2634]: Server listening on :: port 22.\n\nSo basically two lines when not counting the third IPv6 line. I then introduced an error into sshd_config and repeated the restarts. VLinux / messages:\nsshd[2924]: Received signal 15; terminating.\nsshd: sshd shutdown succeeded\nsshd: sshd startup failed\n\nOn 14.04 this time auth.log is empty and syslog is not:\nkernel: [ 2905.854777] init: ssh main process (2718) terminated with status 255\nkernel: [ 2905.854836] init: ssh main process ended, respawning\n\nOn VLinux there is detailed message about error in configuration file printed into console on which I issue /etc/init.d/sshd restart (\"Bad configuration option: ...\"). I wonder if when sshd would be started by system then the message would be logged into messages. My guess is yes, but I can't test this with live CD.\nRestarting proftpd with error in configuration logs full information on VLinux and on 14.04 it outputs error message into terminal when done for the second time, and nothing besides \"SHUTDOWN\" is logged into proftpd.log (syslog is empty).\nSummary:\n\n\n*\n\n*I couldn't prove clearly that messages had more information, however it can maybe be seen that what prevails now is to save disk space (?) and not log too much\n\n*one has to jump between auth.log, syslog and dedicated logs to find some information, and it's mostly meaningless content as apparently no output of the daemons is forwarded into logs and instead it's kernel that catches \"something\" or daemon's own work to manage own log file\n\n*I'm pretty sure that in case of some sophisticated error I would find something in messages, while in current syslog there would be typical kernel information about ending an process or so; I might yet came up with an idea of such test to show this\n\n*while I didn't show clearly that current logging misses things, I for sure showed how verbose messages was\n\n\nA: This is definitely one item where the new systemd excels - you get all logs in one place.\nI have to admit though that the amount actually logged is not that impressive either - the reason as pointed out by Gsxr1k lies in the fact that vsftpd logs exclusively to its own files under /var/log/vsftpd/\njournalctl -f\n\ntells systemd to show me the log continuously, so after \nsudo systemctl restart vsftpd\n\nor\nsudo service vsftpd restart\n\nI get\nNov 27 22:45:14 nb-re systemd[1]: Stopping vsftpd FTP server...\nNov 27 22:45:14 nb-re systemd[1]: Stopped vsftpd FTP server.\nNov 27 22:45:14 nb-re systemd[1]: Starting vsftpd FTP server...\nNov 27 22:45:14 nb-re systemd[1]: Started vsftpd FTP server.\n\n\nA: The config file for what gets logged where is (at least on Ubuntu 14.04 and 15.10) /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf.  Looking at that, everything is logged either to /var/log/auth.log or /var/log/syslog.  I think the second of these is even more verbose than the old /var/log/messages.\nIf you want to get the old /var/log/messages back, just uncomment the following lines in /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf (and possibly remove ,daemon from the third line):\n*.=info;*.=notice;*.=warn;\\\n       auth,authpriv.none;\\\n       cron,daemon.none;\\\n       mail,news.none          -/var/log/messages\n\n", "Q: Can Ubuntu read/write to CD-RWs and DVD-RWs? The questions asks all. I searched everywhere but found nothing related to the specific topic. \nI don't have problems creating a rewritable disk (assuming I already have a disk formatted as such).

The ususal hard disk writers are\nnot aware of the very long seek times and the quite limited\nnumber of overwrites before a block on the medium goes bad.\nTheoretically best suited would be DVD-RAM, Mount Rainier\nformatted DVD+RW (MRW), and BD-RE, because they have Defect\nManagement, which can replace a few bad block by blocks\nfrom the Spare Area.\nIn practice optical media often fail earlier with Defect\nManagement than without.\nCapable of random read-write access are:\nFormatted CD-RW, formatted DVD-RW, DVD-RAM, DVD+RW, BD-RE,\nand formatted BD-R with format type Pseudo-Overwrite.\nFormatted DVD-RW need the pktcdvd frontend driver which\ntakes care of the peculiar 32 kB granularity of the media.\nThis driver is recommended for CD-RW, too.\nIt gets set up by e.g.\npktsetup pktcdvd0 /dev/sr0\nand will then be used as pseudo hard disk device\n/dev/pktcdvd/pktcdvd0\nSee also\n  http://www.g-loaded.eu/2005/11/10/packet-writing-on-cdrw-and-dvdrw-media/\nSaid this, please be aware that sequential writing to\noptical media by a burn program is much less problematic\nthan random-access read-write operation.\n\nA: Long question, short answer :)\n\nBut not in the same manner as a hard drive.

I'm using ubuntu 14.04 LTS and I'm so new to it as I was using windows before.\nAs poeple told me I need three partitions ( Swap , ext4 , partition for normal files and folders ) it was recommended to me to make the third partition's format NTFS but it actually askes me to mount it every time I boot up my laptop over and over again .\nMy question is \"Is there any other format which is used for normal data for ubuntu or Is there any solution for it ?\"\nMy thanks in advance .\n\nA: You need to set the NTFS partition to be mounted automatically on boot. That can be done by adding info about your partition to /etc/fstab file, which is basically a list of disks/filesystems (and also respective options for those disks and filesystems, like read-write, read only, etc) that get mounted automatically during boot sequence. \nTo do that , open Terminal ( in Windows' terms that's CMD or PowerShell ), run sudo blkid command. There will be output for each partition; find the UUID for your NTFS partition. \nSample output,\n /dev/sdb2: LABEL=\"TI105866W0A\" UUID=\"4EBAAE53BAAE36FD\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n\nFor instance, if I wanted to have /dev/sdb2 mounted automatically (which is my windows partition on another disk ), I need that  UUID=\"4EBAAE53BAAE36FD\" part.\nNext , open for writing /etc/fstab file in text editor, with admin priviledges ( in other words add sudo or gksu before calling the editor, e.g., sudo nano /etc/fstab ). and add a line in the format as shown bellow\nUUID=1234-abcd-5678-efgh   /media/myMountPoint  ntfs defaults 0 1\n\n/media/myMountPoint has to exist as a directory, so I suggest you make a new directory with sudo mkdir /media/myMountPoint\nNote that opening the /etc/fstab file with root permissions, can also be done graphically with gksu gedit or pkexec gedit. Personally, i prefer command line editors vim or nano\nFor more info refer to MountingWindowsPartitions Wiki\n", "Q: How can I play the League of Legend in Ubuntu 15.04 (64-bit)?

I totally know nothing of this type of things.  My uncle gave it to me, and my family doesn't even know what to do with this.  I've tried upgrading, but it will not!  What steps do I need to do, and could you explain in thorough steps? Thank you for reading this and I appreciate your time.\n\nA: TL;DR: I think the best approach here is a full re-installation.\n\nThe upgrade path from 10.10 to a more recent release, 14.04 (Long Term Support) or 15.10 (latest), if even still possible, would go as follows:\n10.10 → 11.04 → 11.10 → 12.04 LTS → 14.04 LTS ( → 14.10 → 15.04 → 15.10 (latest release))\nSo as you can see, you would have to perform 4 subsequent release upgrades to get to the latest LTS release, and another 3 more to get to the latest release. In each of these upgrade processes, something could break. (And I'm currently ignoring the fact that this will take a long time.)\nAlso, you may run into performance issues. Ubuntu 10.10 is the last release to ship with the GNOME 2 desktop by default, since 11.04 Canonical shipped Ubuntu with its new Unity desktop, which is a hell lot more demanding on memory and CPU, although I don't know whether it will actually install Unity during a release-upgrade.\nSo a full reinstallation would be the way to go, if you want to keep using Ubuntu. An explanation on how this is done would be way to exhaustive for this answer, but you can find a very detailed guide here.\nAs already mentioned, the default Unity desktop may be too demanding for older hardware, but you are free to try ;) You can even boot Ubuntu directly from a DVD or USB, as described in the Installation guide. If it doesn't work well, you may want to have a look at Ubuntu flavors with more lightweight desktops, such as Xubuntu (with Xfce) or Lubuntu (with LXDE).\n\nA: Goto \"Search your computer and online resources\" And search Software Updater and from there you can upgrade to the newest version of ubuntu\n", "Q: Xephyr with KDE I am hoping someone can help me with this.

In other words, bash - is exactly equivalent to bash.\n\nBash takes its commands\n\n\n*\n\n*from a script file if it's provided on the command line, or\n\n*non-interactively from its stdin if its stdin is not a TTY (such as in your example: stdin is a pipe, so Bash will execute the contents of that URL as a script), or\n\n*interactively if its stdin is a TTY.\n\n\nIt is a misconception that bash - tells Bash to read its commands from its standard input.  While it is true that in your example, Bash will read its commands from stdin, it would have done so regardless of whether there was a - on the command line, because, as stated above, bash - is identical to bash.\nTo further illustrate that - does not mean stdin, consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*The cat command is designed to interpret a - as stdin.  For example:\n$ echo xxx | cat /etc/hosts - /etc/shells\n127.0.0.1 localhost\nxxx\n# /etc/shells: valid login shells\n/bin/sh\n/bin/dash\n/bin/bash\n/bin/rbash\n/bin/zsh\n/usr/bin/zsh\n/usr/bin/screen\n/bin/tcsh\n/usr/bin/tcsh\n/usr/bin/tmux\n/bin/ksh93\n\n\n*In contrast, you can't get Bash to execute /bin/date then /bin/hostname by trying this:\n$ echo date | bash - hostname\n/bin/hostname: /bin/hostname: cannot execute binary file\n\nRather, it tries to interpret /bin/hostname as a shell script file, which fails because it's a bunch of binary gobbledygook.\n\n*You can't execute date +%s using bash - either.\n$ date +%s\n1448696965\n$ echo date | bash -\nSat Nov 28 07:49:31 UTC 2015\n$ echo date | bash - +%s\nbash: +%s: No such file or directory\n\n\nCan you write xargs bash instead?  No.  curl | xargs bash would invoke bash with the contents of the script as command-line arguments.  The first word of the contents would be the first argument, and it would likely be misinterpreted as a script filename.\n\nA: The intention of the command is to pipe the output from the curl command to bash so it immediately executes commands returned by curl.  Basically it tells bash to get its input from stdin.  See https://superuser.com/a/1494190/234355\nHowever, there is some discussion about whether this actually works or not in that same answer.\nIf you just execute the first part of the command in the question curl --silent --location https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup, it will output a valid bash script.

It starts up fine and can open the start up menu, but the cursor lags, disappears while moving, and leaves a trail of glitches over the screen until the page is refreshed. And the whole thing freezes when I hit \"start\" after configuring the game. The only way to get out is to log out or reboot the system. I haven't been able to find any applicable patches for this release of wine. Any ideas? Thanks.\n\nA: If it is Wine's bug, you could try to install Wine-staging. It is an extention, which provides a lot bug fixes and more. You'll find more information on their websites.\n\nA: While this may not necessarily solve your problem, you often have a better chance of getting something to run with Wine by using the latest version of Wine. You can install Wine 1.7 by following the instructions on this page – or in short run the following commands in a terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install wine1.7\n\nIf that still doesn’t help, then you should look at Wine’s AppDB for the specific application you’d like to run. For the Gold Edition of Empire Earth there is also an entry; it suggests to run winetricks directmusic in a terminal to get rid of the freeze (run sudo apt-get install winetricks before, if you don’t have it, yet). The mouse issue will probably stay, though (which is also noted in the AppDB entry).\n", "Q: Unable to auto mount usb and \"mount: special device /dev/sdb1 does not exist error\" Unable to automount USB.\nI am trying to enable auto mount usb in Unity.

Under GPT, the same principles apply -- that is, a partition type code identifies the intended purpose of a partition. The difference is that GPT type codes are 128-bit GUIDs, vs. the 8-bit codes used under MBR. The nature of GUIDs means that it's not necessary to register codes with a central authority to avoid collisions; two GUIDs are statistically very unlikely to be identical by accident.\nAFAIK, there is no official repository of GPT type codes, but they are documented on the Wikipedia page about GPT. One disadvantage of GPT type codes is that, as GUIDs, they're long and awkward -- for instance, 0FC63DAF-8483-4772-8E79-3D69D8477DE4 for Linux filesystem data, vs. 0x83 for the MBR equivalent. Thus, most tools for partitioning GPT disks use some form of \"shorthand\" or \"natural-language translation\" in their user interfaces. I'm the author of GPT fdisk, and as my goal in writing it was to create something that was as similar to (MBR) fdisk as possible, I took the approach of using MBR codes as a base; however, because the correspondence between GPT and MBR type codes isn't 1:1, I multiplied the MBR type codes by 0x100 to get the GPT equivalents. Thus, MBR's 0x83 became 8300. This also enables related follow-on codes that don't exist in MBR, such as 8301, 8302, etc. These codes are easy to use for people who are already familiar with the MBR equivalents, but they're admittedly arbitrary for people who don't know the MBR codes. Internally, GPT fdisk translates these codes to GUIDs. You can see the actual GUIDs by viewing detailed partition information (via the i option in gdisk, for instance). You can also enter an arbitrary GUID rather than use the GPT fdisk four-character codes, if you like or if you need to use a code that GPT fdisk doesn't support.\nOther tools use other approaches. The libparted library (and thus parted, GParted, and other tools based upon libparted) translates some type codes to \"flags\" and completely hides other codes. This helps simplify things for some users, but it renders some tasks impossible -- for instance, you can't set an arbitrary type code with anything based on libparted. OS X's Disk Utility translates known GUIDs to plain-text descriptions. (IIRC, when you create a partition it sets an appropriate type code based on the filesystem created in a partition, similar to what GParted does.)\nFor the most part, Linux doesn't use type codes, for either MBR or GPT. That is, you can put your standard Linux filesystem on a (GPT fdisk) 8300 partition, or use 0700 (as was common in the past), or assign your own random GUID. Similar comments apply to RAID, LVM, swap, and other partition types. There are a few exceptions to this rule, though. For one, distribution installers often look at and set type codes, so you may need the right type code on a partition before it will be used properly. Another exception is that systemd is starting to make use of type codes as a fallback if /etc/fstab isn't properly configured. (That's where most of GPT fdisk's 830x codes originate -- they're part of the Discoverable Partitions Specification, which is a Freedesktop/systemd initiative.) Currently, Ubuntu is just using the main Linux filesystem type code (8300 in GPT fdisk) for filesystems, plus the appropriate codes for LVM, RAID, swap, etc. One big exception to the \"Linux doesn't use type codes\" rules is the BIOS Boot Partition code (21686148-6449-6E6F-744E-656564454649; ef02 in GPT fdisk or the bios_grub flag in libparted). This type code identifies a partition used by GRUB, and when you run grub-install, GRUB will install part of itself to that partition. If you install GRUB on a BIOS-booting system with a GPT disk, a BIOS Boot Partition must normally be present. (There are ways around this rule, though.) More importantly, if you mistakenly set this type code on the wrong partition, that partition will be damaged when you install GRUB! I've seen quite a few people make that mistake in various online forums.\nWhere type codes become more important is when dealing with other OSes. Windows and OS X, for instance, tend not to touch partitions with type codes they don't recognize. Their list of type codes excludes common Linux-specific type codes, so using a Linux-specific type code helps reduce the risk that Windows or OS X will trash your Ubuntu installation. These OSes don't care if you use the GPT fdisk 8300 or fd00 code, though. Problems can arise if you use codes that are recognized by these other OSes. For instance, at one time the Linux filesystem type GUID (0FC63DAF-8483-4772-8E79-3D69D8477DE4) did not exist. I created it and pushed it into both my own GPT fdisk and libparted because the common practice of using the \"Microsoft Basic Data\" type code (EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7) was causing problems in dual-boot setups. Specifically, certain Windows tools would think the Linux partition was a damaged or un-initialized Windows partition and offer to prepare it. User error at this prompt would be disastrous. See this page of mine for more on this subject.\n\nA: Lists of assigned partition types to be used in the partition table were originally maintained by IBM and Microsoft internally. \nWhen the market of PC operating systems and disk tools grew and liberated, other vendors had a need to assign special partition types to their products as well. \nSeveral industry experts in the 1990s started to research partition types and published partition type lists in order to help document the industry de facto standard and thereby reduce the risk of further conflicts. \nIt is up to an operating system's boot loader and/or kernel how to interpret the value.

It says There was an error launching the application. I'm new to Linux and don't know how and where to see the error details. Just in case, the .desktop file looks like this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nName=IntelliJ IDEA\nIcon=/opt/idea/bin/idea.png\nExec=\"/opt/idea/bin/idea.sh\" %f\nComment=Develop with pleasure!\nCategories=Development;IDE;\nTerminal=false\nStartupWMClass=jetbrains-idea\n\nBy the way, the launcher was created by the application (Intellij IDEA), not manually, but, anyway, I must be missing something.\nAlso, the desktop-file-validate utility yields no validation errors for the file.\nSo, the question is: how to see error logs, for more details about the problem?\n\nA: Validating .desktop files\nThere is a tool to validate .desktop files: desktop-file-utils\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the latest tarball from here. \n\n\nTo install\n\n\n*\n\n*Unzip the file, cd into the unzipped folder's directory and run the commands:\n./configure --prefix=/usr && make\n\nand \nsudo make install\n\nas described here\nTo use it\nQuoted from the link:, the desktop-file-utils can be run with the following commands:\n\ndesktop-file-edit \n\nis used to modify an existing desktop file entry.\n\ndesktop-file-install \n\nis used to install a new desktop file entry. It is also used to rebuild or modify the MIME-types application database.\n\ndesktop-file-validate \n\nis used to verify the integrity of a desktop file.\n\nupdate-desktop-database \n\nis used to update the MIME-types application database. \n\nThe third option, ran with the .desktop file as an argument:\ndesktop-file-validate <.desktop_file>\n\nwill no doubt be the most interesting for you.\nNote\nWhen I tested the desktop-file-utils, it seemed to be more picky then necessary, and there were not many .desktop files that \"survived\" the test without at least a warning.\nThe good news is then that it is unlikely that the error, that makes your file fail, will be missed by the utility.\n", "Q: Can I boot the latest Ubuntu with a USB just like the hard disk drive? Can I treat my 128 GB USB like the internal hard disk drive (HDD) and make an Ubuntu OS installation on it and whenever I want, boot the OS from it, and be as fast as using the original OS with a HDD?\nMy USB is the new fast 3.0.\n\nA: Yes, you can. Here you will find comprehensive instructions on how to do it:\nHow to install Ubuntu on an USB stick\nBut the performance will not be the same as if you install it on a HDD or SSD.\n\nA: Theoretically, it should work with a persistent USB.\nWhile creating the USB startup disk from an Ubuntu ISO file, make sure you select the option \"Stored in reserved extra space\" for storage of documents and settings. You should allocate a good amount of space to this heading if you are going to use Ubuntu from your USB for a long time.\nOnce the startup disk has been created, plug it into the computer you want to use it on, boot from it and select try ubuntu to use Ubuntu direct from your USB without having to install it.\n", "Q: Auto-Snap a Terminal (or Nautilus) when Opened Like 98% of the time I open a Terminal or Nautilus, I want to use it snapped to the right/left... especially if I am using more than one instance of them.\nCan I configure my Ubuntu to open any instance of Nautilus or Terminal in 'snapped' mode?\nI am using Ubuntu 15.10.\n\nA: What you could use is the -geometry option for nautilus shortcut.\nFor instance, I could set Super+E (which is same as Windows shortcut for opening \"My Computer\" ) to nautilus --geometry 250x250+0+0 . The geometry option is defined in man X page as WIDTH+HEIGHT+XOFFSET+YOFFSET.  +/- can be used and man page defines the corners as:\n+0+0    upper left hand corner.\n-0+0    upper right hand corner.\n-0-0    lower right hand corner.\n+0-0    lower left hand corner.\nWith terminal , that's a little different because gnome-terminal treats geometry option as in rows by columns. So gnome-terminal--geometry=\"250x250+0+0\"` will open a window that is just horribly large. \nWhat you also could do is to alter the .desktop files in /usr/share/applications folder, particularly the Exec= line to have the geometry option, so that launcher icons also  can spawn windows with specific size\n\nA: You could install the Compiz Config Settings Manager:\nsudo apt-get install compiz-config-settings-manager\n\nRun it from Dash and then under the Window Manager heading you should find options that let you customize how you want to mange your windows.\n", "Q: nslookup query not working in Ubuntu I am trying to use the code nslookup -q=mx gmail.com to find the mail server of gmail.com, but its not working on my Ubuntu.

Execute command in one terminal and get the output in another terminal\n\nA: Possible with something known as named pipe.\nHere's a basic demo:\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal window 1.\n\n*Type mkfifo /tmp/myPipe and hit enter\n\n*Type echo \"Hello Named Pipe\" > /tmp/myPipe & and hit enter\n\n*Open terminal 2\n\n*Run cat /tmp/myPipe to see the output\n\n\nAnother possible solution is to have a screen session running, and attach/detach to it.\n\nA: On the receiving terminal, execute the command w. This will print a list of currently running sessions, e.g. when I run the command, it prints:\n 13:39:22 up 11 min,  3 users,  load average: 0.32, 0.50, 0.33\nUSER     TTY      FROM             LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT\nsebastia tty8     :0               13:27   11:52  21.10s  0.31s cinnamon-session --session cinnamon\nsebastia pts/1    :0               13:36   10.00s 23.90s  0.29s sudo apt-get update\nsebastia pts/3    :0               13:37    1.00s  0.11s  0.01s w\n\nThe one you're in is of course the one with the command w (Listed in the column WHAT).\nIn this list, you'll also find a section called TTY. There you will see the name of the terminal buffer file, e.g. pts/3 for the one I executed w in.\nNow let's assume I want to execute the command running in pts1 to print its output to pts3. This can be done like this (using the command from above):\nsudo apt-get update > /dev/pts/3\n\nThis will forward all output to pts3. However, it will not take any input from there. Unfortunately, I didn't manage to find a solution for this. (Additions welcome)\n\nDepending on what you are trying to achieve, a terminal multiplexer, such as Tmux or GNU Screen may be better suited for this task. e.g. with Tmux, proceed as follows:\nStart Tmux with the command tmux. You'll be dropped to a new shell. Execute your command there.\nIn the receiving terminal, run tmux a to attach to the existing Tmux session. You can now interact with this terminal.\nIf you wish to do so, you can detach from Tmux anytime with Ctrl+B, followed by D. You can reattach from anywhere with tmux a.\n", "Q: Why is there more than one command in Bash for accomplishing the same task? I've read this post, but it doesn't address the issue of redundancy.\nAs an example, I've noticed that there are three different commands for returning logged in users:\n\n\n*\n\n*w (?) \n\n*who (print all usernames currently logged in)1 \n\n*users (list users currently logged in)1\nI know the output is slightly different, but is there an actual use case for having the redundancy in this example? Wouldn't it be better to have a single command with multiple parameters? I guess the question comes down to whether there is a policy in place that prevents merging of Bash commands and whether there is an index of the most appropriate commands to use when commands overlap in function.\n1 Purpose according to this index of bash commands.\nEdit in reponse to [on hold]:\nI'm not asking for opinions. I'm asking why there are commands that overlap because it's confusing. I want to know which commands are the best commands to use when commands overlap. I'm not negating personal taste. I know some people prefer certain software. @Rinzwind mentioned in the comments that my question is probably about backward compatibility and I think he is right. Is there a systematic way to include or exclude certain Bash commands in each new version of Ubuntu so that people like myself who were not involved since the Unix days can get maximum benefit from the OS?\n\nA: It's called freedom!\nIt is the freedom to use what you think is right. It is the freedom to be creative. The freedom to not have to endure limitations of software companies. It is the freedom of having to think for themselves.\nIt's Linux!\nProbably most of the programs are older than you and have their origins in Unix. But what is old, is not automatically bad.\n\nAnd as you say in your comments:\n\nMy concern is with whether similar commands violate the DRY principal.\n\nThis has nothing to do with DRY. Don't repeat yourself in your code, that's right. But fork code and change code; be creative!\nIf you need restrictions, use Microsoft, Apple or something else, but not Linux.\n\nRead more here: Linux, GNU, and freedom.\n", "Q: How to reset Ubuntu 14.04 completely I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 (dual boot - along with Windows 7) and I'm new to it. I needed to install Apache, MySQL and PHP as a part of my work. I installed each of those 3 packages separately using the tutorials given here and other sites.\nYesterday, I needed to remove and re-install the apache2 package due to \"internal server error - 500\". The installation was smooth but there were some errors since then. So, I decided to completely remove Apache, MySql and PHP. I removed it and re-installed again. But, the errors like \"javascript-common\" is still there. And I'm confused and not satisfied with the current status of my system.\nI think, I need to start over.

I've checked for the mail-notification-evolution package, it's not installed4 – but as notifications worked before the last reboot, this cannot be the reason.\nIn case it matters: I'm using LXDE as desktop environment, but Gnome desktop is installed as well (though not selected as default). Again, as it worked in the past (before that last update/reboot), all required components should be available.\nUpdate: I've just figured evolution-indicator should be responsible for notifications here. But there were no changes to that package either within the last year.\nAny ideas what I could check/adjust to make notifications from Evolution work again?\n\n1: I'm not sure which update exactly it was (there were no updates for Evolution itself); the issue started after the latest reboot. I assume it were the last kernel updates (3.2.0-94), but cannot tell for sure. Walking through the list of latest updates/installs in /var/log/apt/history.log doesn't reveal anything I'd recognize as related.\n2: Edit › Plugins › Notifications for new mails\n3: Edit › Settings › (Account_Name)\n4: according to dpkg -l mail-notification-evolution it never has been installed – it doesn't even have an install candidate in the stracciatella PPA I've used to install Evolution 3.4.2 from quite some time ago; the package in the \"standard repo\" depends on Evolution < 3.3 and thus cannot be(en) used anyway\n\nA: I'm not sure what finally did it – but currently, notifications are working again (and I hope they keep working):\n\n\n*\n\n*as root, I've executed ln -s /usr/lib/evolution/3.2/plugins/* /usr/lib/evolution/3.4/plugins/1: If that has been the culprit, how did it work before? Neither Evolution nor the Evolution-Indicator have been updated in the past 12 months.\n\n*checked and \"toggled\" notification settings (each one twice, so I've ended up not changing them but triggering Evo to write them again), see note 1 in the question. Did that before, and it didn't help.\n\n*after the above, restarted Evolution. I did that before more than once without any effect on the issue.\n\n\nMaybe it was the combination of tasks performed – or the two symlinked files in the plugin directory triggered some \"re-configuration of plugins\" in Evolution, solving the issue as a side-effect (which is what I assume).\n\n1: evolution-indicator plugins were located in the 3.2 directory only – and were the only (two) files residing there\n", "Q: How to trace the IP of a Tox user? I am a user of Tox, my client is qTox (if that makes any difference), and I was just reading their FAQs section when I came across these sections:\n\nHow does Tox Protect My Privacy?\nTox protects your privacy by removing the need to rely on central\n  authorities to provide messenger services, concealing your identity(In\n  the form of meta-data, your IP address) from people who are not your\n  authorized friends, enforcing Off-The-Record Messaging as the default\n  and only mode of operation for all messages, and by making your\n  identity impossible to forge without stealing your personal private\n  key on your own computer.\nDoes Tox leak my IP address?\nTox makes no attempt to cloak your IP address when communicating with\n  other users, as the whole point of peer-to-peer is to connect you\n  directly to your friends. A workaround does exist in the form of\n  tunneling your Tox connections through Tor. However, a user\n  cannot uncover another user's IP address using only a Tox ID to find\n  the user in the DHT, the IP address will only be discernible when the\n  users become “friends.”\n\nSo I tried to see if I could find the IPs of some of my contacts (I ask for their prior permission), so I first figured out with netstat -tnap which port qTox was running on, the port was 33445. I then launched WireShark to try and see if I could capture some packets going to and from that port, however I could not find the IPs of any of my contacts (some had given me hints to parts of their IPs and I couldn't even find similar IPs). Though there was such a large amount of traffic (mostly UDP and TCP, but some ICMPs as well) that it was hard to really see anything.\nSo how exactly can you trace someone's IP through Tox and make sure that it is their IP without asking them for their IP or a hint to it (not because I want to trace the IPs of my contacts without asking them, but so that my method is more foolproof than just capturing packets and asking people which packet came or is going to them)? Or is this the wrong way of doing it?\nI have also been reading this section which suggests that it can only be done when the friend request is initially sent? Is this the case?\nI am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18.\nInformation Update:\nI ran a test, someone gave me their IP, I then captured the packets going to and from the port which qTox is on, I captured the packets which where sent when I sent them a contact request, when they accepted it, and when we talked, however when I filtered out all the packets that were not either to or from their IP, no packets were left.\nSo even though Tox is meant to use P2P, it doesn't seem to directly connect, so how does it connect and is there any way of my tracing a contact's IP through it?\n\nA: When you use software to capture packets on your internal network behind a NAT router, you'll be capturing local traffic.\nIn that case, you will need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*turn on the router logging (preferably logged to your machine) and cross-reference whatever the router logged with whatever you captured on your machine.\n\n\nOR\n\n\n*\n\n*disconnect the router and hook your machine directly to the Internet and capture Internet traffic directly.\n\n\nA: Tox added Onion routing, similar to Tor, in 2014: \nBob then creates an onion (the packet will go through A, B, C and will end up at D) \nannounce request packet with his real public key, ping_id as zeros and\nsearching for his real public key.\n\nRead more here: https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/blob/522f90fee138087db660dccc08413c53f388f604/docs/Prevent_Tracking.txt\n\nA: To extend davidbaumann's answer: the onion routing is only used for friend requests, not for established communication. Once a user has accepted a friend request, the communication between those two users is directly peer to peer, minimizing latency. This has the side effect of exposing their IPs to each other.

I have changed all my icons(manually) in the unity sidebar. I just want to change some of them in system tray( for example Deluge,vlc) without using icon themes.How to do it? Where are they located?\n\nA: You could manually replace the icons by examining a *.list file, to find out where they are located. I don't know whether panel icons are set in .desktop files or not, however we could basically trick the program by saying \"Yup, this custom image is totally the same file, saved under the same name, so go ahead and use that.\"\nFor instance, I have a chinese-calendar application installed. By examining the /var/lib/dpkg/info/chinese-calendar.list, I found there s /usr/share/pixmaps/chinesecalendar-64.png image, which is the tray icon used on the Unity panel. The next step is to save your desired icon under the same name as that file, e.g. cp $HOME/my-custom-icon.png /usr/share/pixmaps/chinesecalendar-64.png.\nKeep in mind that the file is likely root owned, so you will need to use sudo, as well as back up that original icon just in case\n\nA: I needed this on Ubuntu 18.04, and set the icon in the dir /usr/share/icons/hicolor/22x22/apps/.\nChange it\n", "Q: I have got garbage in home catalog I want to clean my home directory from garbage, but I've got in trouble after I saw some weird files.

Is it safe to delete them? If not, how can I get rid of that fdisk output?\n\nA: I know this thread is old, but I came across it only recently.\nAfter installing Slackware 14.2 I got the same 16 RAM disks in the output of\nfdisk -l. I investigated a little further and found that in the 'util-linux'\npackage, which fdisk (among others) is part of, the selcetion of what fdisk considers as block device changed substantially. In the util-linux package version 2.21 this decision is based on the reported disk geometry while in the current version 2.72 the output of /proc/partitions is parsed.\nAccording to my searches on the internet the ramdisks have been there in Linux since kernel 2.4, fdisk did just not show them. Since I am annoyed by the listing of many \"disks\", which are no real disks, I made a patch for fdisk:\n    diff -Nur util-linux-2.27.1_ori/disk-utils/fdisk-list.c util-linux-2.27.1_fdisk-no-ram-disks/disk-utils/fdisk-list.c\n--- util-linux-2.27.1_ori/disk-utils/fdisk-list.c   2015-10-06 08:59:51.572589724 +0200\n+++ util-linux-2.27.1_fdisk-no-ram-disks/disk-utils/fdisk-list.c    2016-08-16 15:55:14.840952091 +0200\n@@ -312,6 +312,10 @@\n        if (devno <= 0)\n            continue;\n\n+       /* dont list RAM disks */\n+       if (strstr(line, \"ram\") && devno >= 256)\n+           continue;\n+\n        if (sysfs_devno_is_lvm_private(devno) ||\n            sysfs_devno_is_wholedisk(devno) <= 0)\n            continue;\n\nMaybe this helps some others...\n\nA: The post by Johannes is correct.  The ram-disks have been in the kernel for a long time, it is the behavior of fdisk that changed.  Instead of patching fdisk, I wrote a simple perl script (5 lines of code, 6 comment lines)  to handle the issue.

See: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1593293\n\nA: This is perfectly normal on Linux systems. It's kind of a preparatory action for the case that the RAM disks should be required. Each of them has a size of 64 MiB, a very low value. If necessary, the size will be increased automatically.\nWhy suddenly 16 RAM disks are available in Wily, can be explained only with difficulty.\nI have tested the default RAM disks on:\n\n\n*\n\n*CentOS 7 – No RAM disks\n\n*Fedora 23 – No RAM disks\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 – No RAM disks\n\n*Raspbian Jessie – 16 RAM disks (4MiB)\n\n\nSource\n\nThe RAM disk driver is a way to use main system memory as a block device.  It\n  is required for initrd, an initial filesystem used if you need to load modules\n  in order to access the root filesystem (see Documentation/initrd.txt).  It can\n  also be used for a temporary filesystem for crypto work, since the contents\n  are erased on reboot.\nThe RAM disk dynamically grows as more space is required. It does this by using\n  RAM from the buffer cache. The driver marks the buffers it is using as dirty\n  so that the VM subsystem does not try to reclaim them later.\nThe RAM disk supports up to 16 RAM disks by default, and can be reconfigured\n  to support an unlimited number of RAM disks (at your own risk).  Just change\n  the configuration symbol BLK_DEV_RAM_COUNT in the Block drivers config menu\n  and (re)build the kernel.\n\n\nA: No idea why fdisk is suddenly reporting /dev/ram. \nYou can however tell fdisk to only report specific devices.\nfdisk -l /dev/sd*\n\nWill list real drives. \nAlternatively you could also use parted and lsblk. \nParted output for one drive here.\nModel: ATA Samsung SSD 840 (scsi)\nDisk /dev/sda: 120GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\nPartition Table: msdos\nDisk Flags: \n\nNumber  Start   End     Size    Type      File system  Flags\n 1      2096kB  120GB   120GB   extended               boot\n 7      2097kB  26.2GB  26.2GB  logical   ext4\n 5      26.2GB  36.7GB  10.5GB  logical   ext4\n 6      36.7GB  47.2GB  10.5GB  logical   ext4\n\nCorresponding lsblk output\n    NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\nsda      8:0    0 111.8G  0 disk \n├─sda1   8:1    0     1K  0 part \n├─sda5   8:5    0   9.8G  0 part /mnt/Links\n├─sda6   8:6    0   9.8G  0 part \n└─sda7   8:7    0  24.4G  0 part /\n\n\nA: This behaviour is governed by kernel options that you can only change by recompiling a custom kernel. You can change the size of the ram* devices using a GRUB parameter ramdisk_size but not the count. This is useless, because even if you have lots of memory every ramdisk will increase to whatever size you set. So for instance if you want an 8GB ramdisk--which I do, see below--you'll get 16x 8GB instances. I don't know whether this is harmless if you don't use most of them, but I'm reluctant to brick my system if it isn't.\nI want to use a 8GB /dev/ram device to mirror with an 8GB hard disk partition for the specific purpose of putting a hot disk area on it. My application will automatically write the blocks out to regular storage based on the free space, so it doesn't matter that it's small.\nWith write-behind under mdadm,this should have the effect of making writes blazing fast if they are bursty, with the HDD side of the mirror catching up when things are quieter to provide at least some data protection. I have used this setup with Solaris, but it doesn't seem to be possible with Linux as it comes out of the box.\nSince RAM is orders of magnitude faster than SSD, this should be a win, but I can't try it. As others have noticed, if you build a RAID1 with tmpfs, it won't reassemble at boot because the step that initialises tmpfs is far too late in the boot process--at mountall. Your mds are well and truly built by then, so it fails, and you have to rebuild it manually.\nOTOH /dev/ram* devices would be perfect for this--if you could configure them. They are the very first thing that gets set up, and ram0 is the initial / filesystem.\n\nA: I've been bugged by this for a few years now. Jeff Norden made a cool perl script.

The Ubuntu partitioner will tell you what partition holds the OS by the way. \nIf you are unsure: check the size of the partitions in Windows first before trying!\n\nA: Yes it will. In fact, it will delete all the windows partitions C, D and E.

My partner and I want to use this to write journal entries / scrapbook in a collaborative way.\nI'm fairly certain about how to install WordPress locally using LAMP.\nWhat I don't want is to have done this in such a way that the WordPress site is accessible to the world-at-large.\nOf course, I can password-protect the site, but still: how do I ensure that I have not created a publicly-accessible web server in the process?\n(Note: I'm only interested in answers to this question, not recommendations on better ways to organize our collaborative journal efforts.)\n\nA: If you have a computer that acts as a server in your home, and you access the Internet through a router that does NAT (like any standard ADSL router), then the computers inside the network won't be visible from the outside world, unless you explicitly do some port mapping on the router. If your server-computer never leaves the network, then you should be safe.\nIf the site has to run on your laptop and you plan bringing it to the outside world, then you should secure it with at least a password, or shut off the webserver, because people on the same network could access it. The same is true if you plan to have guests on your network (they could be able to access your local website).\n\nA: Short Version:\nUsually the modem/router you use to connect to your home computers to the internet will control what gets into your network.\nFor an external entity to gain access to your internal WordPress installation you would generally need port 80 forwarded to your WebServer/WordPress install. This is something that can only happen if you (or someone else) explicitly allows. Without that, the world at large won't be accessing the install.\nBy Installing the basic tools of LAMP and WordPress and no other \"features\", you will not be sharing your install externally, and it will be safe.\nThat's not to say you shouldn't take extra precautions (for example, attacks from within your network), but largely you are covered.\nLonger Version:\nThere are a number of ways that an external person CAN connect to an internal WebServer, but they all involve explicitly creating an entry point, for example:\n\n*\n\n*(as mentioned) forwarding of port 80 (or other) from the outside world into your network (this would allow the world at large to connect to your WordPress install),\n\n*a VPN setup (which would allow only the authorised users access to the internal network).\n\n*a SSH tunnel (again, very explicit users), or\n\n*an entry point created via malicious means (malicious email attachment, malware file, etc)\n\nIf you and your partner are operating on your own secure network and already have a connection method between computers in your network (NAT within the router) then setting up WordPress as an internal CMS is very easy to do with several great resources out there to achieve that (I know you said you're probably fine with the installation, but I will share one great resource for installing WordPress on Ubuntu, and that is Digital Ocean's:\n\n*\n\n*LAMP on Ubuntu\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-14-04\n\n\n*WordPress on Ubuntu\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-wordpress-on-ubuntu-14-04\nAbout the only other consideration would be if you were installing it on a Windows machine, or a machine with an overly aggressive software/OS firewall, but you've mentioned Ubuntu and this will allow the share for you (once setup correctly).\n", "Q: Can you access an NTFS Windows portion with read write capabilities on Ubuntu? I'm thinking about switching to Ubuntu because I absolutely hate windows 10. I have a separate hdd  that has all of my media and games on it. If I install Ubuntu on my designated OS hdd can I access my media hdd from within Ubuntu and will I be able to have read/write capabilities?\n\nA: Yes. AFAIK all linuxes reads and writes just fine to NTFS partitions, as a matter of fact I formate most of my USB harddisks with Gparted as NTFS ! \nWhy I hear you all ask?   Well you see our windows machines only support Fat  and NTFS - as do our settop boxes for the tellys, and I think thatv NTFS is better than FAT, at least it support large files- movies for viewing on the big screen or record them from the settopbox! This results in some mpeg2 files (transmission streams) somefiles.TS.\n\nA: Yes. NTFS works fine with Ubuntu. If you plan to dual-boot windows and Ubuntu, I think NTFS would be your best choice of format because it would be readable on both.\n", "Q: Disabling Guest account bash script Hey I'm working on this all purpose script to tighten a ubuntu computers security and one of the things in it is to disable guest account through lightdm.conf.

Recently it won't connect to our home wifi but will connect at school and other wifi networks. I've been reading some of the fix-its listed here but so far none have worked. rfkill list shows no soft or hard blocking. I restarted the network manager but this didn't work. It tells me the signal is strong so it sees it. Password is correct. WPA2. It worked fine until 2 weeks ago. Help?\n\nA: I have intermittent wireless issues.  In our last flat, my Mac wouldn't play well with one router, but would with another.  I've had issues where a Windows laptop on the network would somehow interfere with my connectivity on another machine.  When they connected I'd effectively get no access until they turned their P.C. off.  A Windows P.C. at home frequently can't grab an address automatically (dhcp).  Giving it its own fixed IP, and DNS server fixes that.  I have another problem with my current router, another Windows box sometimes doesn't connect, even when others laptops do.  A router reboot seems to fix that.  At work one colleague had lots of problems, when we didn't.  Sometimes the placement of the machine can really matter.  There are many nuances.  Do state your router if possible.\nSome ideas:\nTry other devices, do they connect okay to the same access point?\nTry connecting with just the Lenovo.\nMove the laptop.\nTry connecting closer to the access point.\nTry removing and re-adding the access point connection in Network Connections on the Lenovo.\nTry a different protocol.\nScan locally with something like WiFi Radar to make sure your neighbour/s aren't on the same channel.\n", "Q: If I changed from Windows to Ubuntu, would I have to re-install all my programs? So i'm thinking of changing from Windows to Ubuntu, but don't know if I would need to reinstall everything as some windows programs are uncompatible with linux.\n\nA: Yes, you will have to re-install everything. Many programs that are available for Windows are available for Ubuntu, and if not, there are usually alternatives that do the same thing. In the case that some program isn't available for Ubuntu, you could try using it with Wine, but that doesn't work all that well, and if you get the program to even load, it is often buggy.\n", "Q: How to close, minimize, and maximize a specified window from Terminal? I am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18 and I am wondering if there is a way from Terminal to close, minimize, unminimize, maximize, and unmaximize specified windows?\nNote - I've looked at this Q&A - I am asking how to do it from Terminal... Not how to add the buttons... The buttons are already there, I don't need to add them.\n\nA: Adding to Jacob Vlijm's answer:\nxdotool windowactivate $minwinid\nxdotool windowraise $minwinid\nxdotool windowfocus $minwinid\n\nAlso works for unminimizing a window. The animation is faster for me.\n\nA: There are two important tools to manipulate windows from cli; xdotool and wmctrl. Both tools overlap each other in functionality, but the most important commands referring to your question:\nIn an (no doubt incomplete) overview, listing the commands I use most:\nClosing a window\nwmctrl:\nwmctrl -ic <window_id>\n\nMinimizing a window\nxdotool:\nxdotool windowminimize <window_id>\n\nUn- minimizing a window\nwmctrl:\neffectively un- minimizing is done by:\nwmctrl -ia <window_id>\n\nI mention effectively, since the command moves to the corresponding desktop, unminimizes and raises the window, but the command also does that on windows which are not minimized.\nMaximizing a window\nxdotool:\nxdotool windowsize <window_id> 100% 100%\n\nwmctrl:\nwmctrl -ir <window_id> -b add,maximized_vert,maximized_horz\n\nUn- maximizing a window:\nwmctrl -ir <window_id> -b remove,maximized_vert,maximized_horz\n\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*Both xdotool and wmctrl are not on your system by default:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool wmctrl\n\n\n*To run any of the commands on the currently active window:\n\n\n*\n\n*for wmctrl commands, remove the -i option, replace <window_id> by :ACTIVE:\n\n*for xdotool commands: replace <window_id> by $(xdotool getactivewindow)\n\n\n*In many cases, commands can be run by using either the window id or the window name. The -i option in wmctrl tells wmctrl to use the window id. I'd suggest not using the window's name as an identifier, to prevent name clashes. It happens more easily then you'd expect.\n\n*From my own experience, using maximizing in a script; \nUsing wmctrl to maximize / unmaximize can be a bit buggy on both Unity and Gnome, while the xdotool option works more robust in my experience. \nIn most scripts, I end up in using a mix of both wmctrl and xdotool.\n\n\nMore info on man wmctrl and man xdotool (mainly the section: WINDOW COMMANDS).\n\nA: Adding to Jacob Vlijm's answer:\nMinimizing a window w/ xdotool by window name:\nxdotool search -name '<window_name>' windowminimize\n\nTo get list of windows names use:\nwmctrl -l\n\n", "Q: Permission denied while doplying Tomcat 8 webapp on Amaon EC2 I can't find how I can get write and read permission into the tomcat folder. \nI followed DigitalOcean's tutorial on setting up Tomcat. The only thing I did different is that I used Java 8 instead of 7, but I don't think that this is causing the issue.\nWhen I log into the tomcat web application manager and upload the war I get following error:\n\nFAIL - Deploy Upload Failed, Exception: java.io.FileNotFoundException: /opt/tomcat/webapps/SimpleServlet.war (Permission denied)\n\nWhen I use Filezilla to connect to EC2 and I want to drop the file into webapps folder:\n\nError:    /opt/tomcat/webapps/SimpleServlet.war: open for write: permission denied\n  Error:    File transfer failed\n\nThe output of ls -la /opt/tomcat/webapps is:\ntotal 28\ndrwxr-xr-x  7 root root 4096 Nov 20 09:19 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  9 root root 4096 Nov 28 16:34 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x 14 root root 4096 Nov 28 16:34 docs\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 root root 4096 Nov 28 16:34 examples\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 root root 4096 Nov 28 16:34 host-manager\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 root root 4096 Nov 28 16:34 manager\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root root 4096 Nov 28 16:34 ROOT\n\nbut this is the folder structure that can be seen in FileZilla\n\nOn the tutorial I followed this step:\n\nThen create a new tomcat user.

It speaks about \"giv[ing] the tomcat user write access to the conf directory\" while changing the folder's permissions. Not having write permissions for the web application server's user to the software ran seems reasonable for production use (an attacker exploiting the tomcat process will not be able to modify software), this will also prevent you from deploying applications from withing the tomcat web application manager.\nI'd go for setting up tomcat as the webapps group:\nchgrp -R tomcat /opt/tomcat/webapps\n\nand when you need to deploy new applications, add write permissions for that group:\nchmod -R g+w /opt/tomcat/webapps\n\nwhich you remove again after deployment:\nchmod -R g-w /opt/tomcat/webapps\n\n(you will need to run those commands with super user privileges, so prefix sudo as needed).

Could someone point me to a USB 3.0 PCI (not PCI-E) card that works with Ubuntu 16.04 and is cheap? \nThe only ones I've found are 40-50 pounds and the compatibility is unknown.\n\nA: There is barely a market for PCI USB 3.0 cards, probably that's why prices are high. PCI as commonly distributed in the 32-bit at 33 MHz version only supports transmission of 133MB/s, which means pretty much 1000Mbit/s. Subtracting some overhead for the protocol, this already gets pretty close to the maximum speed of 430Mbit/s of USB 2.0. USB 3.0 would allow up to 5Gbit/s, far beyond PCI's capabilities. Don't expect any major improvement in transmission speed comparable to PCIe cards! Even a single USB 3.0 port will be able to occupy the link, which is of course shared among all USB ports on the card.\nA quick survey on PCI USB 3.0 cards reveals most of them is running the VIA VL80x chipsets, which is told to be supported by Linux since quite some years. As this is a PCIe chipset, there might be some issues because of PCI-PCIe bridge chips, but those are likely also supported well.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 live usb won't boot, seems incompatible with nouveau So it's seems to be a fairly common problem that ubuntu live usbs won't run because they lack the necessary nvidia drivers.

I have a couple of questions:\nIs there an older version of ubuntu that doesn't have this issue?\nIs there a way to try out just the terminal from the live usb and install the necessary drivers on a persistent image and then try the install?\n\nA: Boot from the Ubuntu installation USB media you already have created.  \nSelect (highlight) Try Ubuntu without installing and  press the E key.\nAdd the nouveau.modeset=0 parameter to the end of the linux line.\nThen press the F10 key for booting into the Ubuntu Live desktop.  \nNow you can explore Ubuntu - when you decide to install Ubuntu, do the same when booting the system for the first time.

Now I want the log file (that is \"logkeys.log\") generated in that server to be streamed to another machine at specific timings.\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: One very simple way would be to allow the destination (server B) to do a password-less SSH (or SFTP) connection to server A (where the file resides) and then create a cron job on server B that would copy the file at certain time intervals, by invoking scp (the syntax would be similar to: scp serverA:/path/to/logkeys.sys /path/to/destination\nPassword-less connection means, of course, using keys :-)\n", "Q: Freeradius Version I have noticed that the freeradius package in the repository is still 2.1.12 which is very old, and no longer supported.

Afterwards I followed the directions on this site, including this weird instruction:\n\nWhen the wizard comes up be sure to install into the following directory: /usr/local/bin**“/thinkorswim”**\n\nI don't know why the author of the post had thinkorswim in double-quotes but surprisingly everything worked. I now have a directory in usr/local/bin named: \n\nbin\"\n\nand in that folder is another subdirectory called: \n\nthinkorswim\"\n\nWhat's the purpose of the double-quotes in directory names and are they necessary?\n\nA: I'm pretty sure that asterisks were some leftover formatting from some wiki probably (they are gone from the source site, you cited), and quotes were there just to emphasize the name...\nWhy it worked? - Well, double quotes are valid character in filename, you just need to be extra careful when operating on them, to properly escape.\nSince asterisks were not escaped, I guess, what happened, was that they were probably stripped by the installation script and so you end up with bin\" (thing is, asterisks can also be used in filename, but I guess there was at least some sanitization on that input, pity, that it didn't left just a-zA-Z0-9_-. - rarely will you see anything else).\nAnyway, I think, you should reinstall it if you want to be sure not to have any troubles running application from that path.\nTLDR; it worked, because, in essence, there was no error...\n\nA: UPDATE FOR RUNNING THINKORSWIM on UBUNTU!\nOn Saturday, January 23, 2016 TOS released Thinkorswim version 1880.62\nThis version solves multiple problems with trying to run TOS on Ubuntu primarily because it uses Java 8.

That changed nothing.\nHow do I make the extra partition behave normally, e.g. be writable by users?\n\nA: For new ext4 etc filesystem, you need to change the permissions so your user can access it and read/write to it - using for example:\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER /data\n\nWhere /data is the path to where the drive is mounted - if you do this in the wrong place it will likely break things.\n$USER is replaced with the user's username by the shell.\nFor more info read the chown manual page [ 1] [2]:\nman chown\n\nAnd to view permissions on stuff you can use ls -ld /data for a directory, and ls -l /data for the files in it. \nFor some other filesystems - e.g. NTFS, you can specify the permissions via the mount options - see here.\n", "Q: Make work rtl8187 and ath10k together I have a problem since I have made work my Killer Wireless-AC 1525 working with Ubuntu.

You could uninstall the ath10k-dkms and then install another backports package\nwget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/backports/2015/11/20/backports-20151120.tar.gz\n\ntar -zxvf backports-20151120.tar.gz\nsudo dpkg -r ath10k-dkms\nReboot\ncd backports-20151120\nmake defconfig-wifi\nmake\nsudo make install\nRemoving the ath10k-dkms file also removes the firmware, we can reinstall the firmware by\ngit clone https://github.com/kvalo/ath10k-firmware.git\nsudo cp -r ath10k-firmware/ /lib/firmware/ath10k/\nAnd add the parameter setting with\necho \"options ath10k_core skip_otp=Y\" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/ath10k_core.conf\nIf you have an error with sudo dpkg -r ath10k-dkms you might have to use sudo dpkg -r ath10k-dkms --all to remove it then reboot and continue with the instructions.\nAfter a new kernel is installed through updates you will have to \ncd backports-20151120\nmake clean\nmake defconfig-wifi\nmake\nsudo make install\nThen reboot unless the new kernel supports the Killer wireless 1525\nIf I remember correctly the ath10k-dkms was done by Adam Lee and I understand why he did it the way it was done as DKMS makes you have a few entries in dkms.conf for every module you want to use and there would be a lot of work involved to make it support every wireless module supported by backports.\nReboot and both wireless cards should function\n", "Q: I restarted for a Ubuntu update and I now have a command line when it boots.

If this is the case, the following command should fix it:\nsudo ldconfig -v\n\nIt may also be a good idea to make sure that there aren't any other libraries that are missing that cmake needs to run.  You can do this with the following command:\nldd /usr/bin/cmake\n\nThis will print all of the shared libraries it needs, and where it found them in the filesystem (if it was able to find them, or tell you if it can't)\n", "Q: Send all OpenVPN traffic through proxy or TOR proxy?

I think it's actually fixed at this point, but there doesn't seem to be any plan to update the older packages.  Luckily, it turns out that fixing the broken packages after installation is quite easy.   You just need to download the correct libraries, and put them in the correct directory.  \nFirst, go to http://llvm.org/releases/download.html and find the matching version.

For local virtualbox, the default base os is boot2docker, and for remote, the default base os is ubuntu 12.04+. \nWhat confusing me is that I can find an ubuntu image on docker hub. My previous understanding is the docker images are just applications which can be run based on a linux os.\n\n\n*\n\n*But why there's an image which is a complete os???\nWhat's happening if I run an ubuntu image on an ubuntu os???\n\n\nAnother question is: docker container will share the same OS kernel, that's why the cost of running a docker container is very low.\n\n\n*which kernel they're sharing??

Hence Ubuntu 12.04.\nTo use a different base operating system on a remote provider, specify the provider’s image flag and one of its available images. For example, to select a debian-8-x64 image on DigitalOcean you would supply the --digitalocean-image=debian-8-x64 flag.\n\n\nIn all environments, the goal is to provide a Linux kernel recent enough to support docker feature, allowing any docker image to delegate its system calls to the kernel.\n", "Q: how to delete .private private take alot of space when all my files 70 gb so please help me\ndf -h \nFilesystem           Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda6            451G  262G  167G  62% /\nnone                 4.0K     0  4.0K   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\nudev                 2.0G  4.0K  2.0G   1% /dev\ntmpfs                392M  476K  392M   1% /run\nnone                 5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock\nnone                 2.0G  4.0K  2.0G   1% /run/shm\nnone                 100M     0  100M   0% /run/user\n/dev/sda1            230M   40M  175M  19% /boot\n/home/user/.Private  451G  262G  167G  62% /home/user\n\n\nA: Providing you can login as root, just type sudo rm -rf ~/.Private at the console.

But please make sure that it is really the same host you try with http and https.\n\nA: In case it will help someone, I got this error because I tried to connect to 2 VPNs at the same time. Usually I am using my own VPN that I have setup with OpenVPN on a Linux server to access Internet.\nFor work, I had to use a VPN to access a few websites. However, I still want to keep my own VPN IP address to access most websites. So I tried to connect to the second VPN in an LXC container.\nOnly HTTP requests worked but HTTPS failed. The problem was fixed when I disconnected from my own VPN. In order to use 2 IP addresses at the same time, one for normal websites and the other for work websites, I used an SSH tunnel to my Linux server to browser normal websites through a proxy and used OpenVPN in an LXC container for work websites. It is also possible to use the OpenVPN connection as a proxy by creating an SSH tunnel to the LXC container.\nAt the moment I don't know if it is possible to use 2 VPNs at the same time without the HTTPS problem I had.

But I understand there is a bug in xorg that toggles Num Lock to off when I switch keyboard layout. \nSo I need something that either prevents Num Lock \"off\" at all, or alternatively (perhaps easier?) monitors the Num Lock state and turns it \"on\" as soon as it notices that it's \"off\".\nHere is a Unix answer that seems to address this, but for LXDE. What would I need to do in order to make this idea work in Ubuntu 15.04 and Unity?\nI don't know how to monitor or query the Num Lock state, or how to programmatically change the Num Lock state, but here is a solution that uses a simple script that runs all the time. It sounds like it would work but I am not sure it's smart to have that running all the time?\n\nA: The cleanest would be of course to fix the bug, but as a workaround, the background script below will do the job:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\nkey = \"org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.keyboard numlock-state\"\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(1)\n    state = subprocess.check_output([\n        \"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"gsettings get \"+key]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n    if state != \"'on'\":\n        subprocess.Popen([\n            \"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"gsettings set \"+key+\" 'on'\"])\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script above into an empty file, save it as NM_on.py\n\n*Test-run it in the background with the command:\npython3 /path/to/NM_on.py\n\n\n*If all works fine, add it to Startup Applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add, add the command:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 10 && python3 /path/to/NM_on.py\"\n\nExplanation\nWe can get the current Num Lockstate in more than one way:\n\n\n*\n\n*running the command:\nxset q\n\nwhich will give an output like: \nKeyboard Control:\n  auto repeat:  on    key click percent:  0    LED mask:  00000000\n  XKB indicators:\n    00: Caps Lock:   off    01: Num Lock:    off    02: Scroll Lock: off\n    03: Compose:     off    04: Kana:        off    05: Sleep:       off\n    06: Suspend:     off    07: Mute:        off    08: Misc:        off\n    09: Mail:        off    10: Charging:    off    11: Shift Lock:  off\n    12: Group 2:     off    13: Mouse Keys:  off\n  auto repeat delay:  500    repeat rate:  33\n.....\n\nor with the command:\ngsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.keyboard numlock-state\n\nwhich simply returns 'on', 'off' or 'unknown'.\nSince the latter is extremely light weight, we can very well use it in a background script to check once per second, and set the value to 'on', if necessary, with the command: \ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.keyboard numlock-state 'on'\n\nand so it does...\n\nEdit\nFor some reason, I missed your last paragraph, in which you referred to another answer with a similar solution. \nPurely theoretically, I always have a problem with scripts that blindly (re-) apply settings, without checking the current state. There could be an argument to do so, if the command\ngsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.keyboard numlock-state\n\nto get the current value, would be more demanding that simply run\nnumlockx on\n\nto (re-)set numlockx on.\nLooking at the time both commands need to finish (which is at least an indication) it is however the other way around; the command\ngsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.keyboard numlock-state\n\nseems to be more \"light-weight\".\nRunning a background script a bad idea?\nOf course, if you have no reason to run a background script, then don't. At the same time, if a background script is well- written, thoroughly tested, procedures are smartly optimized, and if it does not add any noticeable effect on the processor occupation, it would be silly not to use as a workaround if it adds important functionality or saves you time.\nI constantly have at least 4-8 background scripts running. Most of them for weeks without a restart. Never noticed any effect, on my elderly system(s).

Recently I once put 10 to sleep/suspension/lock (I'm not sure how it's called in English, anyway it isn't hibernation because the option isn't active) and since then I could't mount that drive where windows is installed. \nThanks alot in advance for the replies, patience.\n\nA: Even when you say : it isn't hibernation because the option isn't active ...  \nBoot Windows - open command prompt as administrator and execute :  \npowercfg /h off  \n\nShutdown your computer completely (do NOT reboot) - Turn on the PC.  \nBoot Xubuntu, now you should be able to mount the Windows partition.\n", "Q: Unable to write to Samba NTFS share from Windows7 I've been trying to enable writing from Windows 7 to a samba share mapped to a NTFS-formatted USB Disk for the last 3 hours without any success.\nI can access the mount point without any issues from the Ubuntu server itself, but no matter how I mount it I always get \"You need permission to perform this action\" when attempting to create/modify/delete files/folders from my Windows 7 computer.\nI'm now out of ideas, so help is very much appreciated!\nSamba configuration:\n[global]\nserver string = serv\nnetbios name = serv\nworkgroup = WORKGROUP\nwins support = yes\n\nguest account = nobody\n\nsecurity = user\nmap to guest = bad user\nencrypt passwords = true\npassdb backend = tdbsam\nobey pam restrictions = yes\nunix password sync = no\npam password change = no\n\n; lanman auth = yes\nntlm auth = no\nlanman auth = no\nclient ntlmv2 auth = yes\n\nsocket options = TCP_NODELAY IPTOS_LOWDELAY SO_KEEPALIVE SO_RCVBUF=8192 SO_SNDBUF=8192\n\nload printers = no\nprintable = no\n\nlog file = /var/log/samba/log\nlog level = 3\nmax log size = 1024\nsyslog only = no\nsyslog = 0\n\n[external]\ncomment = \"External USB Drive\"\npath = /media/usb0\nbrowseable = Yes\nforce user = media\nforce group = media\nread only = No\npublic = yes\nguest ok = yes\ncreate mask = 0666\ndirectory mask = 0777\nhide dot files = false\n\nDirectory permissions:\ndrwxr-xr-x 11 root  root  4096 Nov 28 17:51 /media/\ndrwxrwxrwx  2 media media 4096 Nov 28 17:51 /media/usb0/\n# (media gid=1001 uid=1001)\n\nAttempted mount options:\nsudo mount -t ntfs-3g -o uid=1001,gid=1001 /dev/sdb1 /media/usb0\nsudo mount -t ntfs -o uid=1001,gid=1001 /dev/sdb1 /media/usb0\nsudo mount -t ntfs -o uid=1001,gid=1001,umask=000 /dev/sdb1 /media/usb0\nsudo mount -t ntfs -o uid=1001,gid=1001,umask=000,defaults,users,locale=en_US.UTF-8 /dev/sdb1 /media/usb0\n\n\nA: Simply renaming the share to something else seemed to have fixed the issue. Got the idea from this serverfault answer.\n\nA: It might be silly of me to ask, but have you tried the solution given in here ?\nI would suggest you to first try to set your \n\ncreate mask = 0755\n\nand then if it didn't work, try following exactly the same steps.\n\nA: \n[2015/12/03 21:49:01.868322,  3] ../source3/smbd/dosmode.c:158(unix_mode)   unix_mode(test) returning 0666\n[2015/12/03 21:49:01.868789,  2] ../source3/smbd/open.c:972(open_file)   media opened file test read=No write=No (numopen=2)\n\nDespite the fact that samba returns default 0666 permissions, the files have no rw access. And since you mentioned that on Linux side is fine try adding this option in the config:\nwriteable = yes\n\nDefault is 'no', which must mean that the share is read only.\nThis is just a wild guess.

\n", "Q: What is the meaning of ~/ in ls -la ~/? I am new to Ubuntu. Please help me with the following question. what is the meaning of ~/ in ls -la ~/\n\nA: The \"~/\" is the current user's home directory\n(usually /home/user for a normal user or /root for\nthe root user). The 'ls -la' part is a command named\n'ls', which is used to list the contents of a directory,\nwith the switches '-l' '-a', that tell ls to show the\npermissions of each file/directory (-l) and include hidden files and directories in the list (-a).\n'ls -la ~/' basically means \"list all the files and directories (including the hidden ones) in the current home directory and show their permissions\".\n\nA: ~/ points to the current user home directory.\nSame as /home/user_name\n", "Q: How to compare two strings (from user input) in a bash script Here comes my script, i know i'm doing something wrong so please help me!\n#!/bin/bash\n# Description of the script\n\necho \"Enter first word \"\nread test1\necho \"Enter second word \"\nread test2\n\ncmp $test1 $test2 > error\n\ntotal=`wc -c error | cut -f 7 -d \" \"`\necho $total\n\nif [ $total -eq 0 ]\nthen\n        echo \"Both words contents are same\"else\n        echo \"Both words contents are not same\"\nfi\n\n\nA: Unless you have to use cmp, you can use [ ] for comparison:\nif [ \"$test1\" = \"$test2\" ]\nthen\n        echo \"Both words contents are same\"\nelse\n        echo \"Both words contents are not same\"\nfi\n\ncmp compares files. If, say, you entered foo for test1 and bar for test2, then it will compare two files named foo and bar, which is probably not what you intended.\nAside from that, this line:\necho \"Both words contents are same\"else\n\nis the same as:\necho \"Both words contents are sameelse\"\n\nYou should either put else on a different line, or put a ; before it:\necho \"Both words contents are same\"\nelse\n# or\necho \"Both words contents are same\"; else\n\n\nA: Why use cmp?  You are already using a bash conditional later in your script, so you could swap out the cmp.  Example conditional:\nif [ \"$test1\" != \"$test2\" ]; then\n     # not equal\nelse\n     # equal\nfi\n\nOther comparison operators in bash.\n\nA: In addition to the error of using cmp for comparing strings where it only compares files, you have the problems that you are actually calculating the length of the error message from cmp, and extracting the file name, not the character count, from the output from wc.  The entire computation would be a lot more elegant without a temporary file; if you do use a temporary file, you should clean it out after using it.\nIf you really wanted to see the amount of difference between two strings, maybe pass them to wdiff instead.\nHere is a refactored version:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Note absence of boilerplate comment\n\nread -p \"Enter first word: \" test1   # Note use of read -p\nread -p \"Enter second word: \" test2\n\n# Note use of wdiff\n# Note proper quoting of strings!  This is important\nif report=$(wdiff -s123 <(echo \"$test1\") <(echo \"$test2\")); then\n    echo \"Strings are equal\"\nelse\n    echo \"Strings differ\"\n    echo \"$report\"\nfi\n\nAs an aside, a basic idiom with wc is to redirect input into it; then, it doesn't print a file name, so you don't have to postprocess it.  And lo, this also removes the need for a temporary file.\ntotal=$(cmp one two | wc -c)\n\n", "Q: Popcorn-Time installation I downloaded a new Popcorn Time from popcorn-time.se and I don't know how to install a tar.gz file. I extracted the folder that is in tar.gz and then tried to run command sudo ./install but there in no command found.. What should I do? How to install this \"new\" Popcorn Time source file?\n\nA: Those are directly the files you need to run the program. For opening Popcorn Time, just run from the extracted folder:\n./Popcorn-Time\n\n\nHowever, if you want to know where to save all those files with the other programs, a good place would be /usr/share.\nSo, let's say the folder where you extracted the files is ~/popcorn-time. Then, you'll have to run this in a terminal:\n# Copy the whole folder into /usr/share, using recursive option\nsudo cp -r ~/popcorn-time /usr/share/popcorn-time\n# Create a symlink to the binary file\nsudo ln -s /usr/share/popcorn-time/Popcorn-Time /usr/bin/popcorn-Time\n\nFrom now on, you'll be able to run popcorn-Time on the Terminal, and it'll open.\nFinally, if you want to have an icon in the launcher, create a new file in your home directory, named popcorn.desktop, and write the following in it:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Popcorn Time\nComment=Watch torrent movies instantly!\nExec=/usr/bin/popcorn-time\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\n\n\nA: When you unpack it, that already is the installation. It's no source file, it's a binary precompiled proprietary blob.\n", "Q: How to run `nano` when using a `vim file` command I've been trying to find out how to change application executables (I don't know how to call them) so when you do vim file in the console it actually runs nano file.\nI don't care if vim is installed or not on the operating system.\nHow can I achieve this?\n\nA: You can use an alias, that way you don't have to move vim and the behavior is changed only at the shell's level:\nprintf 'alias vim=nano\\n' >>~/.bashrc\n. ~/.bashrc\n\n\nA: With a symbolic link in /usr/local/bin. This works even after the installation of vim, because applications in /usr/local/bin have a higher priority per default PATH settings. To run the native vim installation you would have to run the full path /usr/bin/vim.\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/nano /usr/local/bin/vim\n\nCheck the symbolic link with\nstat /usr/local/bin/vim\n\nYou should see something like this:\n  File: ‘/usr/local/bin/vim’ -> ‘/usr/bin/nano’\n  Size: 11          Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   symbolic link\nDevice: 801h/2049d  Inode: 5377195     Links: 1\nAccess: (0777/lrwxrwxrwx)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)\nAccess: 2015-11-29 20:22:49.266067541 +0100\nModify: 2015-11-29 20:22:47.566056452 +0100\nChange: 2015-11-29 20:22:47.566056452 +0100\n Birth: -\n\n", "Q: counting in directory I would like to know what the difference is between:\n$ ls | wc -l\n\nand\n$ ls > foo\n$ wc -l < foo\n\nwhen counting all files in the current directorys. And why does the second one gives me one file more.\n\nA: There is no difference, really. The second case would also include the file foo in the list and therefore gives you a count of 1 more.\n\nA: What you're doing with  ls > foo is redirecting output of ls to a file. Surprisingly enough, the file is being created first, and included into the output of ls\n   abcd:$ ls                                                                      \na?b  file name\n\nabcd:$ ls > file                                                               \n\nabcd:$ cat file\na\nb\nfile\nfile name\n\nBefore redirection , there were two files a\\nb and file name. After redirection : 3 files , file included. This is the real problem in your case.\nBut you probably noticed something else : why is a\\nb file was listed on two lines. Why ? ls can list files, but shell allows almost any type of character in filename, including newline. Thus when output of ls is parsed, there may be erroneous information. For proper counting of files, which is what your main goal is here, you could use for loop with shell glob\nabcd:$ for FILE in * ; do echo \"1\";done                                                                                               \n1\n1\n1\n\nAs you can see it correctly shows i have 3 files (including the file redirected from before)\nFor more info , refer to http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/filenames-in-shell.html\n", "Q: System locks up when disk I/O is saturated When I do a large file transfer from my external USB3 hard drive to my internal hard drive (or vice versa), be it via Nautilus or via terminal, Ubuntu (Unity) will almost completely lock up. Things like alt-tab take 20 seconds or more to complete while the file transfer is running. This is not the case when there are lots of random reads/writes to the disk, such as when installing packages. \nWhen I was running Windows, I could run a file transfer in the background and still be able to do things, albeit more slowly when something needed to access the disk. I could still alt-tab just fine. \nIt seems that Ubuntu prioritizes the file transfer above all other disk I/O, which is why it locks up. In Windows it appears that file transfers have a lower priority, which means the system can stay responsive while the disk is saturated. \nHow can I fix this? It's rather annoying, as the computer becomes completely unusable when copying files. This issue happens in both 14.04 and 15.10. I'm forced to plug my hard drive into a USB2 port to prevent this issue, and that results in much longer transfer times. \n\nA: I have had the same issue on my laptop, which has a fairly slow disk system as compared to the remainder of the computer.\nI was able to make this much better, by changing the scheduling algorithm used for disk transfers.  By default Ubuntu uses Deadline, but I find my system  responds more quickly when I use cfq.\nTo see what scheduler you are using, issue the command\ncat /sys/class/block/sda/queue/scheduler    \n\nTo do a one-time change (until reboot) issue the command\necho cfq | sudo tee /sys/class/block/sda/queue/scheduler\n\nNote that it is important that the change be made to whatever it is that you have for your external hard drive;  Mine usually loads up as sdb. so I would issue the command echo cfq | sudo tee /sys/class/block/sdb/queue/scheduler\nI make my change permanent for all drives attached to my computer, by adding the kernel parameter elevator=cfq in my grub file, which looks like this:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash noautogroup elevator=cfq\"\n\n", "Q: Dual Boot Ubuntu 15.10 with Windows 10 (Can't see partitions in Windows) I Used the \"install ubuntu alongside windows boot manager\" option to download ubuntu yesterday (after hours of confusion from reading about manually adding partitions).\nI think I allowed 65GB (using the slider during installation) for Ubuntu and the rest for Windows.

How can I fix this ?\n\nA: First check if you have ffmpeg installed in your system, by typing which ffmpeg. If it's there but it's not recognized, it means it's broken and you're gonna have to reinstall it. Try apt-get --reinstall install ffmpeg.\nThat, assuming you didn't compile it yourself, in that case you're gonna have to download a fresh copy of ffmpeg from here http://ffmpeg.org/releases/ffmpeg-2.8.3.tar.bz2, and recompile.\n\nA: I faced the same problem, but then I found that chromium location is /usr/bin/chromium-browser instead of /usr/lib/chromium-browser/chromium-browser\n\nA: In Ubuntu the Chromium libfmmpeg.so library (./usr/lib/chromium-browser/libffmpeg.so) is provided by the chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra package, whose installation was likely corrupted in your case.\nIn order to solve the problem, you need to reinstall the package:\napt-get --reinstall chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra\n\n\nA: Still faced this issue in mid 2021 and Linux Mint 20.\nThe browser seems to start, but then nothing appears.\n\nRemoving and reinstalling chromium-browser does NOT fix the issue.

It is about Ubuntu, but also about servers/networking.]\nI have a RaspberryPi running Apache on my local network. I forwarded port 80, so it is now accessible from outside my network through my external IP-address.\nI have a domain-name with a Dutch registrar which I want to point to my Pi. This registrar requires me to enter at least 2 nameservers. Currently I have it set to ns1.digitalocean.com, ns2.digitalocean.com and ns3.digitalocean.com.\nI have tried to enter my external IP-address for both nameserver 1 and 2, but this is not accepted.\nI found some tutorial on how to point a local domain-name to the Pi, but that is not what I want, since it only works from my laptop.\nI hope some of you have a suggestion for mo on where to start or how to get the DNS's for my Pi and how to connect it to my domain-name.\n\nA: I'd like to point out that there are two different paths there. First hand you have a static IP, second you are unlucky and you IP is dynamic. \nIf your IP is static then the problem is quiet simple : \n-> Go to your registrar website (where you bought your domain)\n  -> Find out how to EDIT your DNS ZONE\n  -> Add a new \"A\" record (I guess A stands for address)\n    -> this requires 3 bits of information usually : a name or prefix (that thing before the dot like the www in www.yourdomain.com), an IP (that RPi IP ) and a TTL which is a duration expressed in seconds (3600 could be a fair value). This TTL represents how long the clients will keep this in their cache before asking again to your server. \nIf you have a dynamic IP then it gets a bit more complex, you need to set-up somthing to update your DNS zone every time you change IP. There are many solution to do that, things like no-ip.org, or dyndns... These are the 2 I know of. They work but I don't think they are opensource, AND you rely on yet another third party. You can achieve the same goal by using the dnssec and nsupdate to update your zone yourself. Here is a good tutorial on howto do that.\nYou should definitely read some documentation about DNS, just so you get the correct terminology and a general understanding of how it works. Here is some. \nHave fun !\n\nA: Look into CloudFlare. You would point your name servers to that then fill in your IP address into CloudFlare and that should work. Plus you'll get Ddos protection and other good services! \nhttps://www.cloudflare.com/\n\nA: It sounds like you want to add a host record to your zone file on Digital Ocean's nameserver. This record would map the domain to your publicly accessible IP address. \nI recommend following the community page from the registrar, paying attention to the mention of A records for IPv4, or AAAA records if using IPv6.\nFrom the sound of it you want to leave the nameserver assignments (ns1,  ns2) as they are. \n", "Q: How to swap the keys Alt with AltGr?

Will my plan be easily possible?\n\nA: You can do a Full install to the flash drive. \nMost computers see a flash drive as just another hard drive.\nA Full install will probably give you a better feel that running a Live or Persistent system.\nIf your new computer has lots of RAM, Ubuntu will run in the RAM, so there should not be issues with speed.\nA Full install requires a larger flash drive than a persistent install, about 8GB minimum.\nFollow OldFred's advice when it comes to UEFI.\n", "Q: Unable to reset root Ubuntu user password via GRUB as it prompts for password when selecting \"drop to root shell\" in Grub advanced options I changed my main account password on Ubuntu server 15.06 a few days ago and promptly forgot it.\nI have tried dropping into the root shell via Grub, but it actually prompts me for the root password again \"Please enter root password to enter maintenance mode, or hit Ctrl-D to continue\".

That could also be part of the problem - or another problem entirely.\n\nA: Apparently, the sky2 0000:02:00.0: PCI hardware error (0x2010) is, in fact, a PCI hardware error.\nThe two lights on the Ethernet ports indicated that the power was turning on, then off, on, off, etc. Because the Ethernet was supposedly working a few years ago, I've narrowed it down to two issues:\n1.) The computer was originally merged with another computer, so that plus moving the computer around may have jostled the cord loose. I'm going to try opening up the desktop and fiddling with it a bit.\n2.) The Ethernet is simply broken. That's okay too, since I'm going to get two wireless adapters for Christmas (one for my Raspberry Pi, one to replace the Ethernet if the other solution doesn't work).\nI'll comment with an update in case anyone needs it.\nUPDATE: The Ethernet port is integrated as part of the motherboard.

Currently not starting with this system (stopped working) and is a device that I do not want to try to recover with Android.\nI would like to try a great operating system like Ubuntu.\nI'm not a developer, so my skills are not as extensive in this area.\nI read the information from the site, about how to install the system on the devices but when I try to download the image in the terminal indicates that the device is not in the https://system-image.ubuntu.com server.\nIt is possible that this consultation is an issue of low importance to a team of knowledgeable as you all, but I still would like to have your help.\nAny collaboration that you can give me would be excellent, and I will be truly grateful.\n\nA: A phone is not a computer (yet), so the first thing that you have to do is port the system, following the appropriate guide.\nIt might not be easy, if even not impossible, for your old device, mainly because of the CPU. Ubuntu on smartphones needs at least ARM-A7 and 1 GB of RAM.\n", "Q: How new is ctrl+r? I'm wonderering when this command was introduced and if it is part of some offical linux or is it ubuntu-specific ? How do I search my command-line history for commands I used before?\n\nA: Old.\nIt's not a Linux thing. The feature you're talking of belongs to the bash shell via the readline library that it uses. It will work identically wherever you can get bash to run, including Windows, the BSDs, OSX, etc.\nIt's been part of Bash since at least version 1.14.7 (from 1995), since the manpage of that version mentions reverse-search-history much the same way today's manpages do. You can check the source from the GNU repository.\nIt's also mentioned in the FEATURES file of bash-1.05, which apparently is from 1990.\n\nA: It originates with Emacs, not bash so it probably goes back to 1983 at least, if not 1975.\n", "Q: I am really new in ubuntu. I just downloaded the iso file. Can any one suggest me the best partitioning? My hdd is 500 gb and 4 gb of ram\n\nA: What is best really depends upon your needs.\nMany people use dual-boot, so the they can use the same computer with two different Operating Systems, such as Ubuntu and Windows or OS/X.\nIn such a case, 250gb each is a reasonable initial setup. If using Windows, load it first, then get Ubuntu to partition the disk. Be prepared to experiment a bit.\nIf you just want to use the computer for Ubuntu, use the whole disk. You can still use another Operating System inside a VM, such as VirtualBox.\n", "Q: where to put shell script for rsync? I am doing rsync backups of our samba shares with a shell script. I wonder what is the best practice about where to actually store such a script? Currently it's residing in the /home of my admin user.\nAlso, what kind of access rights would a good admin use on such a script? 744 maybe?\n\nA: \nI wonder what is the best practice about where to actually store such a script?\n\n/usr/local/bin/ is intended for this.\n\n4.9.1 Purpose\nThe /usr/local hierarchy is for use by the system administrator when installing software locally. It needs to be safe from being overwritten when the system software is updated. It may be used for programs and data that are shareable amongst a group of hosts, but not found in /usr.\nLocally installed software must be placed within /usr/local rather than /usr unless it is being installed to replace or upgrade software in /usr\nSoftware placed in / or /usr may be overwritten by system upgrades (though we recommend that distributions do not overwrite data in /etc under these circumstances). For this reason, local software must not be placed outside of /usr/local without good reason.\n\n\n\nAlso, what kind of access rights would a good admin use on such a script? 744 maybe?\n\nThat depends on who is suppose to be able to read, write and/or execute it. If it is only the admin even 700 can be acceptable. If an admin has a group of trusted people that should be able to execute this too 750. If those other also are allowed to edit the file you would need at least 770.\nIn general I would say: set the permissions as low as possible. People who are suppose to do something with it that can not will complain. People who can do something with it and are not allowed to will keep quiet. Better to be on the safe side and start with 700 (admin only) or 740 (group can read)  or 750 (group can read, execute).\n", "Q: DESKTOP FILE: android studio installation on 14.04 TO Create a new file androidstudio.desktop, I have run \"nano ~/.local/share/applications/adndroidstudio.desktop\" in my terminal\n,then i added \n\"[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nName=Android Studio\nExec=\"/opt/android-studio/bin/studio.sh\" %f\nIcon=/opt/android-studio/bin/studio.png\nCategories=Development;IDE;\nTerminal=false\nStartupNotify=true\nStartupWMClass=android-studio\"\nthen i pressed \"CTRL+X\" >>\"Y\">>ENTER.\nafter then what shoud i do?help me I hooked up with this for 3 hours!!\n\nA: You don't have to manually create the desktop file.

You should see a message saying Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ..., 8000 being the default http port (you can specify it as a parameter in the command at the end)\n\n*Test your configuration by typing http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser. You should see a list of files in there.\n\n*Find your IP address (for example, 192.168.1.1) and use that as your external address with the :8000 appended to it.\n\n*To terminate the server, hit CTRL+C.\n\n.\n\nA: If you don't want to worry about port forwarding too much, and allow much more options, you can use syncthing\nThis will allow you to share multiple folders, each with different people, with unlimited space. Also, they can add files, if you allow them.\nAdditionally, it's p2p, so even if your pc is offline, and it's already on another client, the third client will be able to sync. There is also no need for worrying about your dynamic ip.\n\nA: If you are using python3 then the command is:\npython3 -m http.server\n\nAfter starting the http server if you want to share the file across internet use ngrok https://ngrok.com/  and tunnel it.\nEg ngrok http http://localhost:8000\nA link will be generated, use the link to share it over the internet\n", "Q: synaptic No protocol specified!! error I have a problem , i can't open synaptic >:(\nroot@dopeboy:~# synaptic\nNo protocol specified\n** (synaptic:6940): WARNING **: Could not open X display\nNo protocol specified\n(synaptic:6940): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display: :1\n\nI have try to Re-install it but is not working, any idea how to fix?!

You can find out what type of shell you're running by typing in echo $SHELL.\nYou can switch to the C-Shell to have everything like before, or you can adapt your scripts for Bash.\nHere's how to change your Shell\nTo define variables in Bash, you don't need the set keyword:\nmy_message=\"hello\"\necho \"$my_message\"\n\n\nA: Your script uses csh syntax so it is not a valid sh script.  The minimal fix for that is to use sudo csh instead of sudo sh.\nHowever, csh is not very popular, for good reasons; perhaps the proper fix would be to rewrite your script in bash (or even portable POSIX sh) syntax.\nApart from the set there doesn't seem to be anything in your script which specifically uses csh features.  The sh syntax to set a variable is\nPROJ=\"-Jm1.4\"\nREG=\"-R40.0/49.0/28.0/38.0\"\n\nThe absence of the set keyword and the absence of spaces around the equals sign are both significant and important changes.\nThere are also many option errors which are (I speculate) due to using different versions of the programs.  I am unfamiliar with these tools, so cannot recommend whether to upgrade, downgrade, or replace them.  Switching to csh instead of sh will not change which options you are allowed to use with these programs.  Perhaps you'll want to post a separate question with more background -- which versions of grdcut, grdgradient, grdimage, pscoast, pstext etc these scripts were written for, which versions you have installed now, and/or perhaps just what your script actually attempts to accomplish.\n", "Q: Bind9 basic configuration for internal network with windows pcs I have a network with more than 50 PCs running on Windows, Mac ans Ubuntu.

You can achieve this by having the guest boot into some disk management software, I would suggest using GParted.\nSo you'd get the gparted.iso file on your host system, attach it to your vm as an optical disk (dvd), and boot the VM into it. Using Gparted, you would expand the partition which contains your root filesystem. When you detach gparted and boot the VM back as Ubuntu, you will see the new space being used.\nGparted is pretty safe, but it's always worth making a backup before doing anything with disks and partitions, even if they're virtual!\n", "Q: GPG error in apt-get update Few minutes ago I ran the following command and it worked fine as always:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt upgrade\n\nThen after about 10 minutes, I ran the same command again:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nIgn http: //fi.archive.ubuntu.com trusty InRelease\nGet:1 http://fi.archive.ubuntu.com trusty-updates InRelease [64.4 kB] \nIgn http: //dl.google.com stable InRelease     \nGet:2 http://fi.archive.ubuntu.com trusty-backports InRelease [64.5 kB]        \nIgn http: //fi.archive.ubuntu.com trusty-updates InRelease                      \nE: GPG error: http: //fi.archive.ubuntu.com trusty-updates InRelease:\nThe following signatures were invalid: NODATA 2\n\nI tried reading every post in askubuntu and stackoverflow and so far nothing.\nThe following is the only thing that sound rational to me and it didn't solve the issue:\nsudo mv lists lists.old\nsudo mkdir -p lists/partial\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get update\n\nany suggestions in appreciated.\nUPDATE: even my Thunderbird was crashing immediately after loading, so I rebooted the computer and I ran the apt-get update again and I got:\nsudo apt update\n.\n.\n.\nFetched 32.2 MB in 10s (3,044kB/s)                                            \nReading package lists...

I got a WinBook TW800 and can download Ubuntu Server 14.04.3 LTS and put it on a USB drive with Rufus and then copy a bootia32.efi to it's /EFI/BOOT folder then it will load on my WinBook and I do the things to install it. But it messes up on making grub. I guess because the BIOS on this WinBook don't like 64 bit. But the CPU is 64 Bit.\nGuess if can install the bootia32.efi as it's installing it's OS then it my work and boot a server on it.\nAny one know how to do this? Or it be nice if they just added this to the download of ubuntu-14.04.3-server-amd64.iso\n-Raymond Day\n\nA: You have two, or possibly three, choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install a 32-bit version of Ubuntu in EFI mode. This is not officially supported, but can be done, and it works well once accomplished. See this question and my answer to it for some general advice.\n\n*Install a 64-bit version of Ubuntu in EFI mode using a 32-bit GRUB. This is what you were attempting to do. The trouble is that the installer itself will try to install a 64-bit GRUB, which of course won't work. You'll therefore need to manually install a 32-bit GRUB to your hard disk after the rest of the installation has completed. Note that there are problems with running a 64-bit kernel on a system with a 32-bit EFI, since the two won't be able to talk to each other. (Or they couldn't a while ago; maybe that problem has been overcome.) This means you can't control the boot process from your booted OS, which is a bit of a nuisance.\n\n*Install in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. If the firmware has a CSM, you can install in BIOS mode, bypassing EFI. This may be the simplest solution if you plan to single-boot; but if you're dual-booting with something else, you'll have additional hoop-jumping to do. Installing the 32-bit version of my rEFInd boot manager may help, but you'll need to edit refind.conf: Uncomment the scanfor option and add hdbios to the list of options. This should enable you to boot the 32-bit EFI-mode Windows (or whatever) and 64-bit BIOS-mode Ubuntu. As with the previous option, you won't have access to EFI runtime variables from Linux, which is a small nuisance. Also, this option requires a CSM in your firmware. Many 32-bit EFIs lack CSMs, so this option may be off the table.\n\n\nPersonally, I'd go with option #1 unless you have a compelling reason to install a 64-bit OS (like if the machine has lots of RAM -- \"lots\" being over 1 GiB, and especially over 4 GiB). Option #3 is likely best if the firmware has a CSM and if you want to single-boot Ubuntu (or if you're willing to convert all your OSes to BIOS mode).\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 stuck on splash screen \nStuck on splash booting screen and i don't know what the error... ;(\n\nA: If you suspect that the extra partition is the problem, try boot up from a Ubuntu Live system. I.e., If it boots fine, then the extra partition is not the problem/cause. \nAnd while your Ubuntu Live is booted, try to mount all partitions from your HD, especially the boot partition and the OS partition. Do the mount under 'sudo su -' from the command line, when you can see if anything went wrong, so that you can fix the problem.\nWhile Ubuntu is booting up with a splash screen, hit ESC to see what's actually going on. Pay close attention to the message flied by. Last time my Ubuntu boot up froze on me, it was because of line about 20 lines before the last message, which says something like \"Press S to fix the disk\" (or maybe \"C\", can't recall the details)\n", "Q: How to change the day of the week Logrotate shifts the file when configured weekly? I have following configuration which rotates all content of google folder weekly:\n/var/log/google/*.log {\n        create 0777 www-data www-data\n        weekly\n        missingok\n        rotate 90\n        compress\n        delaycompress\n        notifempty\n        olddir /var/log/google/old\n}\n\nNow the thing is it does it rotation every Monday morning while I want to do the weekly rotation every Wednesday.\nI was thinking to change the following entry in crontab:\n47 6    * * 7   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )\n\nBut I am confused if this will work, because I could find logrotate in /etc/cron.daily and not in /etc/cron.weekly.\nIs it possible to change files on Wednesday than Monday? If yes then how?\n\nA: Changing the time of running weekly cron jobs won't help, for the reasons you stated.\nNote what the manpage of logrotate says about weekly rotation:\n   weekly Log  files  are  rotated if the current weekday is less than the\n          weekday of the last rotation or if more than a week  has  passed\n          since  the  last rotation. This is normally the same as rotating\n          logs on the first day of  the  week,  but  it  works  better  if\n          logrotate is not run every night.\n\nThat's why it tends to rotate on Mondays. \nWhat you can do, is to run a special, separate instance of logrotate on Wednesdays, which only runs for the Google logs. For example, create /etc/logrotate-google.conf, containing the configuration you have specified, and create a cron job that runs on Wednesdays (as root, so use /etc/crontab, or /etc/cron.d):\n46 6 * * 3 root logrotate /etc/logrotate-google.conf\n\n", "Q: Boot old ubuntu harddrive luks encrypted I've changed my harddisk, to a bigger one. The old one had Ubuntu 14.04 with full disk encryption (luks). The new hard disk has a fresh install of Ubuntu 15.10 without disk encryption.\nI need however to boot the old hd to get some files from some programs (if possible boot it and not just file access). I've tried to take out the new hd and just put in the old hd, assuming it would boot. Well it didn't. I'm guessing, this has to do something with the GRUB boot loader, since I see in the boot option menu in my bios an entry for ubuntu.\nWhat can I do to boot my old hd?\n\nA: You don't really want to boot from the old HD, do you? Just read files/data from it?\nOnce the old HD is connected, and you're running your new Ubuntu (or a live ISO/DVD/USB) the \"Disks\" program (gnome-disks) should be a nice graphical way to see if the old HD's partitions are encrypted with LUKS, unlock/open them (assuming you have a passphrase), and then mount them.\nYou could use terminal tools too, like these:\n\n\n*\n\n*And maybe your drive uses LVM, so you might need to add in commands like these too (from help.ubuntu.com's Resize Encrypted Partitions ):\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install lvm2 to install the lvm tools\n\n*sudo vgscan --mknodes\n\n*sudo vgchange -ay  these two should recognize/activate the lvm, I think to a new name, something in /dev/mapper/\n\n\n*lsblk to quickly see the drives/partitions attached\n\n*cryptsetup isLuks <device> to check if the partition/device is a LUKS volume\n\n*cryptsetup luksOpen <device> <name> to open/unlock a LUKS device & set up a mapping <name>\n\n*mount /dev/mapper/<name> /mountpoint to mount it at some /mountpoint\nBut \"Disks\" is pretty nice, when it works.\n", "Q: Computer does not suspend until network cable is disconnected After pressing \"suspend\" in unity menu computer (desktop) suspends, power LED turns off, disks are stopping.

I was just wondering, for instance when I launch qtox with:\nqtox &\n\nAnd then close Terminal, qtox closes with it. However when running etherape using:\nsudo etherape &\n\nClosing Terminal doesn't close or cause any problem to Etherape. And among different applications there is different behaviour, some close when Terminal does, others do not, how come? Why do some close when others don't? I am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18.\n\nA: When you close a terminal the terminal sends a SIGHUP signal to the shell; the shell, in turn, sends a SIGHUP signal to all its children process groups, which include backgrounded process groups;\nHow each single process will react to the signal is entirely up to the process: if the process didn't define a handler for the signal and tell the kernel (via some syscall such as signal() or sigaction()) that it wishes to handle it, the kernel executes the default handler for the signal, which in case of a SIGHUP signal consists in terminating the process.\nHowever, when you run a command with sudo, the UID of the sudo process and its child process is set to 0 (root); in general, unless the UID of the process sending the signal is 0 (root) or the same as the target process, the kernel dismisses the signal (i.e.: a process can't send signals to a process owned by another user, unless the process sending the signal is owned by root); that's why an user-run process such as the Bash instance run by the terminal can't SIGHUP a sudo process and, ultimately, closing a terminal doesn't affect a process started with sudo.\n", "Q: Very small sized ubuntu distro I want to create a very small sized ubuntu VM, preferably under 1 GB (500 to 700 MB).

Not even headless.\nYour closest bet is Damn Small Linux which is a very TINY linux distro.  However, it is not Ubuntu nor Debian based, to my knowledge.\nIf your intent is to have Ubuntu or Debian, have your VM provision 10GB max for the virtual disk, and let it expand in size as needed - this will give it ample 'space' from the Linux point of view, but it will take at most 10GB + amount of vRAM you assign when you save the system.\n\nA: Try with debían netinstaller the image is reallly small and you can select the minimal packages, then you can add exactly what you need with \napt-get\n\nRegards.\n\nA: You could try a mini distro, some of these can run in live mode, where disk space isn't so much an issue.  Puppy Linux has Ubuntu binary compatible builds.  But it's not Ubuntu.\n\nA: U can check them out in this website \"distrowatch.com\".\nYou can create a very small sized distro just by removing all things which you think you don't need, while you do have that option while you were installing that kernel.\n", "Q: two finger scrolling won't work; ubuntu mate 15.04 I am running Ubuntu mate 15.04 in a VMware player, and am trying to get the two finger scrolling to work.

However as I said before, I don't have this problem on Windows.\nEDIT2: On the following link there is the /var/log/Xorg.0.log file: http://pastebin.com/sjSLScjK , and also I have an ASUS Monitor.\n\nA: Ok, at the time of writing this answer, you don't have a menu bar, and I haven't seen your xorg.conf file yet, but I believe I know enough to know what you need to do, and I believe you will be able to make changes to your xorg.conf file from recovery mode if you can't do it in normal boot mode without a menu bar.\nFirst of all, I believe the [    28.338] (WW) NVIDIA: GPU:0: Unable to read EDID for display device DVI-I-0 warnings are significant, but I don't think anything is \"wrong\", more that it might be a limitation of your monitor, or VGA cables, or your computer, or some combination. My computer, VGA, TV combination also does not detect the EDID automatically.\nWikipedia has an entry on EDID that you may find a useful reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Display_Identification_Data\nYou have already created an xorg.conf file, but for completeness I will include the steps in this answer. You follow Alexander Malakhov's answer in this question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Alt+Ctrl+F1 to switch to console mode\n\n*Stop the X server by stopping the display manager: sudo service gdm stop (or sudo service lightdm stop if you have Lubuntu and/or LXDE environment).\n\n*sudo X -configure to create an xorg.conf.new file\n\n*sudo mv xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf to rename and move the file to where the xorg.conf goes\n\n*sudo service gdm start or sudo service lightdm start to restart the display manager and X server. sudo start gdm and sudo start lightdm also work.\n\n\nYou now have the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf file. What it says now and what it should say depends on your own system. I shall share the relevant parts of my own xorg.conf file (correctly configured for my system) here and talk you through it.\nBut first, how to edit it? If everything is working correctly, then you can edit it by opening a terminal and typing sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf. If you are having trouble editing it in normal boot mode, then you can edit it in recovery mode: start your computer, and from the grub boot menu, select \"Advanced options\", then the recovery mode of your most recent kernel, then select the root shell prompt. You will need to enter the command: mount -o remount,rw / to make everything read-write. Then you can edit the xorg.conf file with the command nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf (sudo is not needed in root shell prompt mode). (When you are done with root shell prompt, enter exit, then select \"Resume normal boot\", you might then need to reboot to see if changes have taken effect.)\nThis link gives helpful info on recovery mode.\nHere are the relevant parts of my xorg.conf file, yours may differ. You can access the xorg.conf manual by typing man xorg.conf into a terminal, or you can find it in several places on the internet, like here. There is also an Ubuntu wiki on it here.\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier   \"Monitor0\"\n    VendorName   \"Monitor Vendor\"\n    ModelName    \"Monitor Model\"\n        HorizSync       28.0 - 83.0\n        VertRefresh     56.0 - 75.0\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n        ### Available Driver options are:-\n        ### Values: <i>: integer, <f>: float, <bool>: \"True\"/\"False\",\n        ### <string>: \"String\", <freq>: \"<f> Hz/kHz/MHz\",\n        ### <percent>: \"<f>%\"\n        ### [arg]: arg optional\n        #Option     \"SWcursor\"              # [<bool>]\n        #Option     \"kmsdev\"                # <str>\n        #Option     \"ShadowFB\"              # [<bool>]\n    Identifier  \"Card0\"\n    Driver      \"sis\"\n    BusID       \"PCI:1:0:0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier \"Screen0\"\n    Device     \"Card0\"\n    Monitor    \"Monitor0\"\n    SubSection \"Display\"\n        Viewport   0 0\n        Depth     1\n    EndSubSection\n    SubSection \"Display\"\n        Viewport   0 0\n        Depth     4\n    EndSubSection\n    SubSection \"Display\"\n        Viewport   0 0\n        Depth     8\n    EndSubSection\n    SubSection \"Display\"\n        Viewport   0 0\n        Depth     15\n    EndSubSection\n    SubSection \"Display\"\n        Viewport   0 0\n        Depth     16\n    EndSubSection\n    SubSection \"Display\"\n        Viewport   0 0\n        Depth     24\n                 Modes     \"1360x768\"\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nI believe you would have the correct Driver in your Section \"Device\", yours should be something like nvidia.\nNext, let's look at Section \"Screen\". You may, like me, have a number of subsections, in which case the only one you need to worry about is the Depth    24 subsection. Insert the line:\nModes     \"1680x1050\"\ninto that subsection. Your computer was not able to determine the screen size using EDID, so we are manually telling the computer what the screen size is.\nI believe this is the change you need to make to get it working. Reboot the machine and see if the resolution is fixed.\nThere is a chance you may need to make a further change: in the Section \"Monitor\" section, you can see HorizSync and VertRefresh lines in my xorg.conf. You may also need these lines in yours. However, the range you need to specify for both lines depends on your monitor. If you have the manual for your monitor, look in the \"specifications\" towards the back of the manual. If you do not have the manual, ASUS appear to provide them on their website, but I do not know the model name/number of your monitor. You may be able to get the model name/number from a sticker on the back of the monitor.\nSomewhere in the Specifications section of the manual is a tabulated list of resolutions, and corresponding horizontal and vertical values. You want the HorizSync range to include all horizontal values for every resolution that you might use: find the lowest value in the list and make that the lower limit, and make the upper limit the same as the highest value in the list. Likewise, with the VertRefresh, use the lowest and highest values in the Vertical column (an ASUS manual I have picked at random just calls this \"Refresh Rate\"). If you add the HorizSync and VertRefresh lines, then save and reboot to see if this fixes the problem.\nPlease do share by comment, at which point, if any, the resolution issue is fixed. If it is still not fixed, we may need to look at your /etc/X11/xorg.conf and /var/log/Xorg.0.log files again. \n", "Q: Why is my network interface named enp0s25 instead of eth0?

Conversely we can guess information about it's physical position in the pci system. In your case that would be pci bus 0, slot 2. According to the freedesktop.org article, there actually are 3 ways how interface name is assigned: based on BIOS/Firmware for onboard cards, based on PCI information, and based on MAC address of the interface. Refer here for other examples. \nAccording to the freedesktop.org page one of the reasons for switching to predictable naming is that classic  naming convention can lead to software security risks in multi-interface systems when devices are added and removed at boot. Also, according to the comment by Sam Hanes, \"On a big server with many Ethernet ports it's invaluable: you can immediately tell which interface goes to which port and adding or removing hardware doesn't change the names of other ports.\" \nSee How to rename network interface in 15.10 in case you decide to revert back to the other version of naming.\n\nA: Here is the quick fix I use on Debian and RHEL based systems\n#Edit /etc/grub/default\nStep 1. ) Add this to the line below \"net.ifnames=0 biosdevname=0\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"net.ifnames=0 biosdevname=0\"\nStep 2.)

(e.g. when you add the user tim, tim automatically gets a folder named Sales in his home directory)\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: All new users' home directories are copies of /etc/skel when the user gets created through any method that automatically creates a home directory. \nIf you are sure that you need the Sales folder on every new user account's home directory, you can just create the folder in /etc/skel. \n\nMake sure the owner and permission of everything you create or modify in there is correct.  \nSet the permissions you want, they will be copied to the new user's home directory as they are. Usually you take 644 (octal representation) or rw-r--r-- (string representation). You can modify this with one the commands below. Make sure everything is owner-readable and all directories are owner-executable (otherwise the owner can't list or access their content).\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo chmod 644 /etc/skel/FILE_OR_DIRECTORY to set permissions for a single file or directory using the octal representation.\n\n*sudo chmod u=rw,g=r,o=r /etc/skel/FILE_OR_DIRECTORY to set permissions for a single file or directory using a syntax similar to the string representation.\n\n*sudo chmod -R 644 /etc/skel to recursively set permissions for all files and directories using the octal representation.\n\n*sudo chmod -R u=rw,g=r,o=r /etc/skel to recursively set permissions for all files and directoriesusing a syntax similar to the string representation.\n\n\nThe owner should be root. You change this recursively on all files and folders in /etc/skel with the command below:\nsudo chown -R root: /etc/skel\n\n\nA: A relatively simple alternative would be to create a starter in /etc/xdg/autostart, that will create a folder in (any) user's home directory on log in, only if the folder does not exist yet.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a file with the following lines:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Create Sales\nExec=/bin/bash -c \"mkdir ~/Sales\"\nType=Application\n\n\n*Save it as sales.desktop (the extension is essential)\n\n*Run the command:\nsudo cp /path/to/sales.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart\n\nThis will create a folder ~/Sales in the home directory of any user once he or she logs in (only if it doesn't exist).\nExplanation\nTo run a command on startup (log in actually) locally, for one user only, we can put a .desktop file in ~/.config/autostart\nIf we do the same, but store the .desktop file in /etc/xdg/autostart, the command runs locally as well, but similarly for any user on log in.\nIf we make the .desktop file run the command:\n/bin/bash -c \"mkdir ~/Sales\"\n\nwe make sure the folder is created, even re- created on the next log in if the user might remove it manually.

I ran sudo apt-get dist-upgrade today and it installed linux-image 3.13.0-68.\nThis seems to have broken something because the server will not boot.\nHowever if I select a previous version such as 3.13.0-67 then the server boots fine.\nHow can I make it start with 3.13.0-67 by default?\nAnd would I still have the option to upgrade the next time there is a kernel update?\nBased on what I read one can edit /etc/default/grub apparently, but I am not wrapping my head around it. \nHere are the contents of that file in case it helps:\n# If you change this file, run 'update-grub' afterwards to update\n# /boot/grub/grub.cfg.\n# For full documentation of the options in this file, see:\n#   info -f grub -n 'Simple configuration'\n\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=2\nGRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"splash nomodeset\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\n# Uncomment to enable BadRAM filtering, modify to suit your needs\n# This works with Linux (no patch required) and with any kernel that obtains\n# the memory map information from GRUB (GNU Mach, kernel of FreeBSD ...)\n#GRUB_BADRAM=\"0x01234567,0xfefefefe,0x89abcdef,0xefefefef\"\n\n# Uncomment to disable graphical terminal (grub-pc only)\n#GRUB_TERMINAL=console\n\n# The resolution used on graphical terminal\n# note that you can use only modes which your graphic card supports via VBE\n# you can see them in real GRUB with the command `vbeinfo'\nGRUB_GFXMODE=800x600\n\n# Uncomment if you don't want GRUB to pass \"root=UUID=xxx\" parameter to Linux\n#GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_UUID=true\n\n# Uncomment to disable generation of recovery mode menu entries\n#GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY=\"true\"\n\n# Uncomment to get a beep at grub start\n#GRUB_INIT_TUNE=\"480 440 1\"\n\n\nA: You can uninstall the package with sudo apt-get remove linux-headers-3.13.0-68. This won't affect your ability to use the next kernel verrson.\nYou can also configure the default Grub entry by changing the line GRUB_DEFAULT=0 to equal the line number of the desired entry, where 0 is the first line. You then run sudo update-grub to apply the changes. You may be confused by the fact that /etc/default/grub/ is just a configuration file that helps generate the actual grub menu. You can see the actual Grub menu configuration under /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n", "Q: Use sshfs with ssh-agent and/or kwallet I am using sshfs with a password protected key pair to mount a remote folder using a shell script.

I need to prevent that.\nIs there a way to use sshfs with ssh-agent and/or kwallet (like I do for ssh)? Or can I reuse an existing ssh connection with sshfs?\n\nA: Are you starting sshfs from your shell, or from a boot-time script? \nIf you are starting it from your shell, and provided you have a running ssh-agent, it should just work:\n$ ssh-add -l\n2048 SHA256:XXXXX /home/ji/.ssh/id_rsa (RSA)\n$ echo success > foo\n$ scp foo ins:\n  ...\n$ rm foo\n$ mkdir /tmp/j\n$ sshfs ins: /tmp/j\n$ cat /tmp/j/foo\nsuccess\n\nIf you are starting it from a location that does not already have SSH_AUTH_SOCK in its environment, and assuming the ssh-agent is already active and has the key, you can simply set SSH_AUTH_SOCK to the correct value, which you can either get by running ps uxeww | grep SSH_AUTH_SOCK and massaging the output, or simply looking at whichever /tmp/ssh-*/* socket you can access and using that!

For example if I setup with:\nmkdir /tmp/data \nmkdir -p /tmp/storage/1448918558\nmkdir /tmp/storage/1448918559 \nmkdir /tmp/storage/1448918560\nmkdir /tmp/workdir\n\nAnd then run\nsudo mount -t overlay overlay -o \\\nlowerdir=/tmp/storage/1448918559:/tmp/storage/1448918558,\\\nupperdir=/tmp/storage/1448918560,\\\nworkdir=/tmp/workdir \\\n/tmp/data\n\nI get the error message:\n\nmount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on overlay,\n         missing codepage or helper program, or other error\n         (for several filesystems (e.g. nfs, cifs) you might\n         need a /sbin/mount. helper program)\n         In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try\n         dmesg | tail  or so\n\nHowever, if I remove either of the lower directories so there is only one in the mount command, it succeeds.\nAm I doing something wrong or perhaps this functionality is not yet in the 3.19.0-33-generic kernel in Ubuntu 14.04?\n\nA: From what I've read on-line and tested, overlayFS was renamed to overlay for the \"newer\" system (with workdir) to avoid conflicts. So one can now have overlayfs and overlay. However Ubuntu appears to only have the newer \"overlay\" system, but only in kernel 4.0 and later supports having multiple lower directories, and ubuntu 14.04 is only on kernel 3.19.\nI've tested that the example given in the question does work in Ubuntu server 15.10 with the 4.2.0-19-generic kernel.\n", "Q: Do I need to notify cron about changes in /etc/crontab? I have edited the system crontab table using sudo nano /etc/crontab according to this question I found online. Will that be sufficient to run the job or do I need to \"notify\" or \"refresh\" cron with a command after I edited the file?\nAlso, the Oracle website said I should validate the file using crontab -l, but that command only lists the crontab for root, not the system crontab. How would I validate the system crontab?\n\nA: It's a bad idea to edit the cron directly.  You should use crontab -e to edit cron files as per that answer on a sister site to Ask Ubuntu...\nThat being said according to the cron manual page:\n\nThere are two ways how changes in crontables are checked.  The first\n  method is checking the modtime of a file.  The second method is using\n  the inotify support.  Using of inotify is logged in the /var/log/cron\n  log after the daemon is started.  The inotify support checks for\n  changes in all crontables and accesses the hard disk only when a\n  change is detected.\n\nSo you should very probably be safe and your cron job will run.\nThe validation the Oracle site is talking about is a visual validation that you didn't do something stupid like exit your editor without saving your file...  ;-)\n\nA: On ubuntu at least there's no need to power cicle cron to see new additions ( however you can if it worries you via sudo service crond restart ). You can grep cron /var/log/syslog and see if your command ran.\n", "Q: Installed Ubuntu onto SD card, booting via UEFI, Grub problems I want 15.10 on my Thinkpad Yoga laptop, but installed on the SD card. I've installed it successfully, but when I go to boot, the the Grub flashes an error message too quickly to read, then drops into a Grub command prompt. If I try to select the SD card as the boot device from the boot options menu, it doesn't go anywhere.\nI installed the system on the SD card using manual partitioning, creating a root partition and a swap partition. Do I need to have created an EFI partition on the SD card? \nIs there any way to catch the error message that Grub is flashing up?\nEDIT:\nI tried re-installing, but putting an EFI partition on the SD card, but after this I don't get a grub prompt at all. And the Windows partition has shredded the bitlocker key (which I could recover from the MS recovery site)\n\nA: Some computers can't read their SD cards from their firmware, which means that you can't install boot loaders or OS kernels there. If this is the issue, the solution is to move part of your installation -- the EFI System Partition (ESP) and a separate Ubuntu /boot partition -- to your regular hard disk (or I'm guessing an SSD for a Yoga). You can keep the rest of the Ubuntu installation on the SD card, but these components must be on a disk that the firmware can read.\nAs to catching the GRUB message, try doing a video recording. Even most cell phones these days can do that. You can then play it back a frame at a time.\n", "Q: How to schedule emails with varying content?

I have an internet connection. My ISP has given me a static IP, but it is not public. I have a TP-LINK router. I have a registered domain. Now, I want to host my own domain in my desktop that can be accessible from the outside world. \nEdit:\nBelow are the posted router configurations. When I registered the domain, I was asked whether I merely wanted the domain registered, or also wanted their web-hosting service, and I only agreed to register the domain only.\nAbout the WAN status in the following image, when I clicked the Detect button, it detected WAN Connection Type as Dynamic IP. So I selected Dynamic IP from the drop-down list and changed the DNS Servers to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 then saved the settings and rebooted the router, but I cannot browse the web this way. So, then I changed the settings as given in the image below as before and was able to browse again. How to configure the settings below, so that when I type my domain name from any device connected to the internet, I get the website that is being served from my /var/www/html/ folder. How to configure Apache or whatever. Please ask me any questions you need to help. I badly need my own server running although I shall use it for personal use. Thanks in advance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: As you don't have a fixed or dynamic public address that you have control over, you'll need your ISP to port forward from the public address to your router.  And then from your router again to your web server.\nIf your public address (search on-line for \"what's my IP?\") on the other side of your ISP's router is not static (as in it periodically changes), then you will have a further problem as your public address will keep adjusting.  But this could be rectified with a dynamic DNS service.\nI'd firstly talk to your ISP.  Explain that you want to expose a web service on the Internet from your home server.\nAn alternative could be to use a reverse SSH tunnel.  You connect to a server on the Internet from your web server and set up a reverse tunnel.  All web requests to the remote server are then mapped back to your web server through the tunnel.  There are many howtos for this available on-line.\nOr you could place your files elsewhere on the Internet with web hosting.  And periodically publish.  This may be more secure than putting your home server on-line.\n\nA: If you only have a static local IP then you can use a service and an application to have a roaming website.\nBasically you install an app that will notify dyn what your IP has change to and they change the hostname they have given you.\nhttp://dyn.com/dns/ \nNot sure if this will work with your current registar, but you can move your domain to them and it works perfectly.\nAlso lots of utilities exist in the repos that will help with the service provider\napt-cache search dyndns\n\n\nA: Your ISP gave you a static local IP address, which you could have done yourself. Unless you have no internet connection, you always have a public IP, but that IP is dynamic, meaning it changes periodically. What you want to do is set up a port forward. Most routers are capable of port forwarding, so this shouldn't be a problem for you. I can't give further advice than checking your router's web setup, as you haven't provided the actual model. If your router does have port forwarding, you need to forward ports 80 and 443 to the local IP address of your server.\nNext, you'll want to set up a No-IP account and set up the DUC (dynamic update client). This will assign a sub-domain address to your public IP. The DUC is needed so the address you register with No-IP can keep referring to your public IP, even when it changes.\nOnce you have port forwarding and No-IP set up, you can now set your domain to point to the No-IP address. You should be able to do this using a masked redirect, or DNS.\nYou may have a problem though. Most ISPs don't want you running a home web server, and they usually block incoming connections on port 80. If this is the case, you'll need to set the server to run on some other port than 80. Good luck.\n\nA: From what I read in your description, I don't think you can do it with your current setup unless your 'ISP' will do some port forwarding for you. \nThe IP address you have is an internal address, as already mentioned by a few answers. Your internet connection is behind a router/firewall that you most likely have no access to. I have a feeling that with your ISP, what you want is not possible. :(\n\nA: I suggest you to build a DDNS （Dynamic Domain Name Server)，which can easily to solve this problem.\nFor example, you can try to config a ddclient.\n", "Q: How move User Folders to another partition (NTFS) in Ubuntu 14 I've installed Windows 7 and Ubuntu on my notebook.

I have my documents, pictures, and music (etc) on the NTFS partition and then link them over to my Ubuntu installation. Works flawlessly. I even link my Thunderbird installation, so that my emails are synced as well.\nThe key is to MOUNT the drive on boot. Here is how you do what you asked for:\nFirst, you will need to make sure you have the proper NTFS packages installed to mount them with read/write (all the commands to follow are done in a terminal window):\nsudo apt-get install ntfs-3g\n\nTo figure out which one is your actual partition (with your user data on it), you will need to find out which one is the right one by it's size. Type this:\nsudo fdisk -l | grep NTFS\n\nThis will show something like this:\n/dev/sda1  *         2048    718847    716800   350M  7 HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda2          718848 467937279 467218432 222.8G  7 HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda3       467937280 468858879    921600   450M 27 Hidden NTFS WinRE\n\n/dev/sda2 shows up as 222.8G for me and is the right size of the partition I am looking for. You will have to match the right one for you.\nTo make sure that plugging in an external drive or USB stick doesn't mess up the sdX naming convention of the drives when you boot up, we will NOT use that to mount the drive. We will instead get the UUID of it. This way we make sure to always mount the right drive! To get the UUID type:\nsudo blkid | grep sda2\n\nThis should show something like this:\n/dev/sda2: UUID=\"2292B90B92B8E507\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" PARTUUID=\"446ec305-02\"\n\nNow we have all the information to put something into fstab to automatically mount the drive in a directory of our choice.\nFirst make a backup of your fstab file. Just in case something goes wrong.\nsudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak\n\nNow let's edit.\nUsing GEDIT: (easier for beginners)\ngksudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nOR using terminal (nano): (good to learn)\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nAdd this line at the end of the file:\n#Added By Carlos\nUUID=2292B90B92B8E507   /windows_data  ntfs-3g defaults,windows_names,locale=en_US.utf8   0       0\n\nChange the UUID to match yours. Also, I am assuming you live in the US, and if not, you will need to change the locale.\nFinally, let's make the directory:\nsudo mkdir /windows_data \n\nYou can call it 'windows_data' or whatever you want. Just make sure to match it to the entry in fstab.\nLet's mount it! Well, first unmount it to make sure. Use the sdX of your partition to do that. Mine would be:\nsudo umount /dev/sda2\n\nThen mount it all properly:\nsudo mount -a\n\nIf everything worked, you will now have your windows partition automatically mounted to /windows_data! Pat yourself on the back for a job well done so far! :)\nOk, let's do the final step: link the directories you wanted! And this is the easiest step.\nWhat I usually do is to open TWO nautilus windows (the Ubuntu file explorer). Hit the Windows key on your keyboard and type \"nautilus\". Open one and go to your \"Home\" directory (should be in \"/home/\" somewhere).\nOpen another and go to \"/windows_data\". Then go into your users data directory in there. Right-click on the directory (like \"Documents\") and select \"Make Link\" and it will create a shortcut there. Move the shortcut by pressing CTRL-X and then CTRL-V in the other nautilus window.\nDelete the old 'Documents' directory in your Ubuntu home directory (if it is empty) and rename the shortcut to 'Documents'.\nRinse and repeat for the rest of the directories.\nI hope I didn't move too fast. If you need more info on anything I can edit this answer to add more detail.\n", "Q: Inaccessable files under orignal default username Downloaded all old files from hard drive to new ubuntu computer.

Open-source drivers usually are the default, and often work flawlessly, but sometimes have strange glitches (I had this same problem with a GeForce graphics card.\nYou can switch to the proprietary driver by going to System Settings > Software and Updates > Additional Drivers. That will look something like this:\n\nUnder your graphics card, choose the Intel driver with the highest version number. Click \"Apply Changes\" and then reboot (it may prompt you).\nIf your graphics device isn't listed, then you'll have to manually have to install the driver. Go to Intel's website and choose your CPU. I won't go into detail on how to install the driver; you can find many a guide on how to do this.\nI hope this helps!\n", "Q: User and password requested when ext4 mounted with Live USB boot I have a live USB with Ubuntu 14.04.3 on fat32, and then there's an ext4 partition beside it. \nWhen I put the ext4 partition in it changed everything.\nNow, when I boot to the USB it asks for a login name and password.\nThe only catch is, i never made a login name and password.\nIt's kind of like Linux is super happy to see its good old ext4 file system and now it's changed behaviour.\nAnyone know why this computer mystery is happening?\n\nA: Sounds like there is a previous system on the ext4 partition and your BIOS settings (or as a distant second possibility, the USB boot loader) is configured to mount that as the system root if one is available.\nConfigure your BIOS to prefer to boot from USB over any fixed disk and you should be fine.\nDown the line, maybe reinstall the ext4 partition to contain useful stuff instead if what is there now isn't useful to you.\n", "Q: No Drivers Found for Brother MFC-J470DW So, I've followed the instructions on Brother's website, I've got the installer and I've tried running it.

The college wifi network is unprotected, but has one of those after-connection verification pages in the browser that verifies if the connected computer has a mac address registered in the system.

You'll need to check the documentation for your computer, though, since the details vary greatly from one machine to another. Removing the battery is usually not sufficient to do this.\nIf that fails, and if it really is a firmware password, then I'd take the computer back to the service center and demand that they fix it, since it sounds like one of their technicians set the password without your permission.\n", "Q: Changing themes and icons with Unity or Ubuntu Tweak, but getting same menu bar \"defaults\" On Ubuntu 15.10, using Unity or Ubuntu tweak, I can change my Theme and Icons.

Now the problem starts ... Sometimes it freezes n sometimes hang on... N the worst part was last night I turned it off n could not turn it on again!!!!! WHEN I PUSH POWER BUTTON , ONLY THE WIFI LIGHT ( ORANGE COLOUR) TURNING ON FOR 10 SEC THEN GONE...!,,!!!!\nI tried several tricked which I found here but still its not working.\nAny suggestion will be highly appreciated. Thanks.\n\nA: This sounds like a hardware problem to be honest. Regardless of any software issue you may have the key here is \"I turned it off and could not turn it on again!\". \nMake sure you check that your power cord is connected securely to the laptop and the individual cables of the power cord are not loose. Laptop power cords often are in multiple segments and sometimes they come loose without you knowing about it. If your laptop has been running a long time and not charging then it would not be able to turn on.\nIf you can clearly see it boot but it doesnt go into the login screen then you may have a problem with your Linux install. Typically that can be fixed just by reinstalling or if you have a lot of files you cant lose doing something else. \nIf it is not either of those and you are not getting any power even with the cord attached then you likely have a hardware problem that may need to be addressed by the manufacturer. Call them up and see what they think. Depending on your warranty length you may be able to get it fixed. \n", "Q: Something wrong with my Ubuntu's eth0 There is something wrong with my Ubuntu 14.04 Laptop's eth0. It works fine after booting up. However, if I don't use it for a short period of time (few minutes), then it will not work. When this happens, connecting to Internet and pinging 192.168.1.1 (my ADSL router's IP address) will fail.\nTo solve this issue, I need to disconnect and reconnect Ethernet1 (i.e., eth0) in Ubuntu desktop environment.\nThat eth0 connects to a port of that ADSL router which another Windows PC also connects to (the other port of it). The network of that Windows PC always works fine. \nCould anybody comment on this strange issue?\n\nA: Lacking data, I must guess that you are getting your IP Address via   DHCP from the ADSL router. Check for a short \"lease time\". If this is the case, fix it on the ADSL router. Use the command:  \nzgrep dhclient /var/log/syslog*\n\nto investigate.\n\nA: After posting this problem I encounter the same symptom on that Windows PC. Fortunately, after debugging this weird problem for weeks, now the root cause seems to be clear: there is something wrong with the firmware in that DSL modem. By upgrading that FW to the latest version, everything has gone smoothly for two days.

Thes packages include numpy 1.10.1, scipy 0.16.1, matplotlib 1.5.0, pylab 0.1.0 and IPython 4.0.1.\nI have also installed python3-pyqt5 5.2.1 and python3-pyside 1.2.1 using aptitude.\nUsing matplotlib from within IPython works well:\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot([0, 1], [1, 2])\nplt.show()\n\nBut the problem starts when I try to use pylab, either by calling ipython --pylab or by calling pylab from within IPython. This is what I get in both of these cases:\nImportError: \n    Could not load requested Qt binding. Please ensure that\n    PyQt4 >= 4.7, PyQt5 or PySide >= 1.0.3 is available,\n    and only one is imported per session.\n\n    Currently-imported Qt library:   'pyqt5'\n    PyQt4 installed:                 False\n    PyQt5 installed:                 False\n    PySide >= 1.0.3 installed:       True\n    Tried to load:                   ['pyqt5']\n\nSo, if I understand it properly, it does not recognize that PyQt5 is installed. This is weird for two reasons; first, import PyQt5 and import PyQt5.QtCore both don't complain. The second reason is that a second call to pylab works perfectly, and with Qt5!\nUsing matplotlib backend: Qt5Agg\nPopulating the interactive namespace from numpy and matplotlib\n\nHowever, there's another consequence for this. After plotting, successfully (say, with plot([0, 1], [1, 2])), when I exit IPython using Ctrl-D, I get a Segmentation fault (core dumped).\nThis is a problem I have for about 3 months now. I have already posted a couple of questions here: Really installing PyQt4/5 for python 3.4 on trusty and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32007733/pip-install-pyside-fails. I have tried probably almost all combinations of installing pyside/pyqt5/numpy/scipy/matplotlib/ipython/pylab via pip/aptitude.

(RIP bbkeys) By configuring and running bbkeys I was able to define all my favourite keyboard shortcuts for manipulating windows and starting applications in one place, and then use them from any window manager.  (Albeit only generic actions, not those strongly integrated with the WM.)\nBut now bbkeys is no longer packaged for Ubuntu.  So I have to define separate configurations for each window manager.\nIs there any alternative to bbkeys?\nOr is there any software that can manage configuration for multiple window managers all in one place?\n\nA: One very convenient alternative that you can use is  . . .  drum-roll . . .  unity-settings-daemon and/or gnome-settings-daemon if you have gnome installed. Personally, I use blackbox and openbox time to time. But I have quite a few convenient shortcuts set in Unity's settings, which some of them are linked to scripts. By setting gnome-settings-daemon to autostart , I get those back in other environments.  Big kicker is that it's a native tool to Ubuntu, it comes with unity-settings-daemon or if you have gnome shell , it comes with gnome-settings-daemon\nIn addition, you can use gsettings to change settings, such as background picture , or a big one for me - input language. \n", "Q: Out of the box into the terminal I am wondering if there is a possibility to modify Ubuntu (ver. 14 although I'd update to 15 if it helps in the effort) in such a way that you boot into the terminal rather than the desktop.\nI am not talking about removing the X-environment altogether. If one were to launch, say, Firefox, I'd like a window to appear on top of my terminal session and when all windows are closed, I'd like to return to said terminal. \nIs this possible?  \n\nA: You could run a terminal and window in the background and force it under every other window. This essentially replaces the desktop with your terminal window.\nThis is something I've done before to help another user with a slightly different problem but it should apply just as well here. See that post for detail but all you need to do is run the following at login:\ngnome-terminal -x sh -c \"wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b add,fullscreen,below; wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b add,skip_taskbar; bash\"\n\nYou can edit your Gnome Terminal profile to make it look better too.

Why does the command-line interpret control input as ^?  \n\nA: Because CTRL+KEY combos are interpreted by the terminal as non-printable ASCII characters, and being those non-printable you need a way to represent them.\nThe convention, stemming from VT terminals with ANSI support, is to represent the CTRL+KEY combo representing CTRL with a caret (^) and KEY with KEY.\n\nA: When copying and pasting to/from a terminal, it is best practise to use the short cuts Ctrl+Insert and Shift+Insert respectively.\nThese are the more traditional short cuts for terminal use, though you'll note that in an X graphical environment Ctrl+Insert and Shift+Insert are tied to the same Ctrl+C and Ctrl + V. \nIn most terminals Ctrl+C (represented by ^C) are used to halt the execution of a process, hence pasting with that short cut won't work.\nFor quick copying and pasting, you can utilize X's primary buffer by highlighting whatever text you want to copy, and then middle-clicking where you want to paste it. No keyboard required.\n\nA: It does not actually insert the character sequence \"^C\". This is only a representation for unprintable ASCII control characters, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*^C → ETX (End of text, sends a kill signal), ASCII 0x03\n\n*^D → EOT (End of transmission, terminates input), ASCII 0x04\n\n*^H → BS (Backspace, \\b), ASCII 0x08\n\n*^J → LF (Line feed, \\n), ASCII 0x0A\n\n*^L → FF (Form feed, new page, clears the terminal), ASCII 0x0C\n\n*^M → CR (Carriage return, \\r), ASCII 0x0D\n\n\nThis is only a small extract of possible ASCII control characters that can be inserted using the keyboard; you can find a full list here.\nI think the most important ones to remember are Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D and Ctrl+L.\n\nA: You should be using Ctrl+C and not Shift+Ctrl+C, because on the command line, they do the same thing (and Ctrl+C is easier than Shift+Ctrl+C).  That might not be true in certain graphical environments where the GUI captures some keystrokes and does something special, but if the keystrokes are truly sent to the command line, then there is no difference.  This is why pressing Ctrl+C may show ^C as a capital C, instead of a lowercase C.  The command line makes no distinction on which one you pressed (and uppercase was presumably judged to be easier to read).  This is true for letters; for other characters, the Shift may have an effect.)\nPressing Ctrl-C sends the ASCII code that is 64 below the uppercase letter's position in the ASCII table (and 96 less than the lowercase letter's position in the ASCII table).  So pressing Ctrl-c (lowercase) sends ASCII code 3 (which is 64 less than capital C's ASCII code of 67).  In many environments, you can hold Alt and then press 3 on the numpad (and then release the 3 key, and then release the Alt key) and you may get the same effect.\nRegarding ^C, the ^ is just a well-known shorthand for the \"Ctrl\" key.  Similarly, M- is a shorthand for the \"Alt\" key.  Err, yeah.  M stands for the word \"Meta\", which can be entered by holding Alt and pressing whatever comes next, or sometimes by pressing Esc (and releasing Esc) and then pressing whatever comes next.  Wikipedia's article on \"Control Key\": \"Notation\" section describes this as \"Traditional notation\".  This is also known as Caret Notation (Wikipedia's article on Caret notation, Unix StackExchange: ryvnf's question about Caret Notation).\nRegarding the last question, the command shell is not \"interpreting\" anything to be a caret.  In other words, the shell is not reading anything, and believing that it is a caret.  What is happening is that the shell is using the well-known caret notation for output.  As another example, you can see the well-known pager, \"less\", use caret notation by running: dd if=/dev/zero bs=64 count=1 | less\n(The \"nano\" text editor also uses caret notation in its online help, including the full screens of online help shown after pressing ^G, a.k.a. Ctrl-g.)\n", "Q: Rygel showing deleted default folders I have Rygel installed and configured on my home server, and have nothing in the default /user/Music;Videos;Pictures folders, so I would like to stop Rygel from searching and displaying them.

In old ubuntu releases, I believe, GUI apps ask for root password using gksudo. Now gksudo not comes preinstalled in ubuntu. For me, if I am adding a custom launcher of a compiled executable which needs to be run as root, I need to install gksudo and add gksudo -k -u root, followed by the execution command.

Also, I do not want to jailbreak the device.\nThere are a few results when searching for this on Google, but none seems very up to date.\n\nA: I don't know whether there's any difference between versions, but I can simply access the files of my iPhone 5s via the file manager when it's plugged over USB (using the AFC protocol).\nI'm using iOS 9.2 beta, I have no idea whether it works on 9.1 or earlier. \nI can access the device from Nautilus' sidebar, if it doesn't show up, try navigating to the following address:\nafc://<your iPhone's UDID>/\n\nAlso, most music players (at least Rythmbox, Banshee and Clementine) support music synchronization over AFC (Apple File Conduit).\nEDIT: I just learned I can easily synchronize my pictures using tools like gThumb.\n\nA: Apple constantly breaks Linux applications' access to iPhones. As of 2019, the best way of uploading and downloading files is to use a 3rd party app on iOS. Apparently, the file you upload is only accessible by that 3rd app.\nPhone Drive is a good app for this. First, take note of the IP address of your iPhone, then, when PhoneDrive is in the foreground, typing the IP address of the iPhone from a PC connected to the same local area network would give you a website where you can upload and download files. You can also use FTP protocol on the same iPhone IP address.

Within the container there is an LVM physical volume, with one volume group, within which are 3 logical volumes: lvRoot (12GB), lvHome (20GB) and lvSwap (20GB). On lvRoot there is Kubuntu 15.04 installed, using lvSwap as swap and lvHome as /home. I keep all of my stuff in a completely separate place, so /home is just for application data.\nI do regular backups using BackInTime, which is a GUI for automated rsync backups. I back-up the boot partition and lvHome as they are, and lvRoot through an LVM snapshot. That is, I create a snapshot, mount it, back it up, unmount it, and delete it.\nA few days ago I had an incident with .xsession-errors growing large and my whole lvHome got filled up and things started braking (this is apparently a known issue). I deleted the file and the system refused to log in (it just froze with the progress bar), so I booted from a live USB stick (also Kubuntu 15.04) and using BackInTime restored lvRoot and lvHome from a backup done in the times when my system was working fine.\nAfter I did that, I still can't log in, but it looks different now: after I type in the password to my account ans hit enter, it seems to start the greeter anew - there is a short moment where the screen is black and in the left corner it displays \"Starting version 219\", just like it does before the login screen first appears. Also the moment I click \"Log In\" after typing in the password, the cursor turns into a black cross, and I don't recall this happening when it logged in normally (I could be wrong though)\nI assumed that maybe the system in my last backup was already borked somehow so I restored the very oldest backup that I have - one done right after installing Kubuntu. The behavior was exactly the same after that.\nFurthermore, I noticed that if I reboot from the live USB stick again after doing the restore, and mount lvHome, it appears empty. lvRoot is fine, all the files are there, but lvHome is always empty. So I assumed that maybe the logical volume lvHome itself got corrupted somehow by the .xsession-errors filling up all the space, and I was copying files to a corrupted LV, and that's why it didn't work. So I deleted lvHome, created it anew, and restored once again. The files are showing up now, but the system still refuses to log in, the same way as before. I ran fsck on lvHome and lvRoot and it says that they're clear.\nI have no idea what's going on here anymore.\nI was under the impression (from reading stuff like eg. this), that backing up using rscync is the right way to do it, and BackInTime also has a good reputation. Furthermore, I tested this backup scheme in a virtual machine (also running Kubuntu 15.04), before I deployed it, and it worked perfectly fine.\nWhy is it not working now? \nI did not restore /boot because I assumed it should be okay, and the system indeed boots up. Was that the mistake? Was it using LVM snapshots? Multiple sources said that the snapshots are a good idea.  \nWhat am I missing here? How do I even diagnose this?\nI could just reinstall Kubuntu, but my backup scheme exists for the very reason of me not having to do reinstalls every time something breaks and I want to know why that scheme doesn't work and possibly how can I make it work.\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: Oh, sorry this didn't came to my mind earlier. Looks like this is Bug #58.\nPermissions can't be restored from LiveCD because the LiveCD doesn't know the users. I'm about to add a new feature to read a different /etc/passwd. But nothing done yet.

As far as I understand from googling, this has something to do with readline support, however nowhere I've seen it mention how to enable support for dash. \nThat's the core of my question: How to enable line navigation for dash\n\nA: If you definitely want dash plus command-line editing and history, you can use rlwrap:\nrlwrap dash\n\nSuggestion:\nrlwrap -cmD2 dash\n\nTo use rlwrap, you'll have to:\nsudo apt-get install rlwrap\n\n\nA: The short answer is:\nYou don't.\ndash is a direct descendent of the Almquist Shell (ash). ash never featured line editing support, and neither does dash. Busybox ash does, so if you must an ash variant for some reason and have line editing, etc., use Busybox ash. Nobody's going to bother with adding readline support, since dash's primary use is for running shell scripts.\nUnless, of course, you're willing to code support for readline in dash, and maintain such a patch yourself...\nThe long answer is:\nCompile with libedit\nIf you look at dash's manpage:\n-V vi           Enable the built-in vi(1) command line editor\n                (disables -E if it has been set).\n\n-E emacs        Enable the built-in emacs(1) command line editor\n                (disables -V if it has been set).\n\nThese only work if dash was compiled with --with-libedit. It isn't, neither in Ubuntu, nor, apparently, in Debian.\nYou can build it thus:\ngit clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/dash/dash.git\ncd dash \n./autogen.sh \n./configure --with-libedit \nmake\n\nThen run:\nsrc/dash -E\n\nYou should be able to use the arrow keys to edit the current command.\n", "Q: openSUSE Leap 42.1 and Ubuntu 14.4.03 boot issues I first installed Leap 42.1 - fine!

Could not solve the problem, but next time booting, openSUSE Leap 42.1 was back again, only a possibility to boot Ubuntu was missing.\nHow can I tell any of those 2 GRUB2-efi OS to present me a dual boot option.\n\nA: Most distributions provide GRUB configuration scripts that try to identify all the OSes on the computer and boot each one correctly. This often works fine, but sometimes it doesn't. In these cases, you have several options, including:\n\n\n*\n\n*Manually add the options you want to GRUB -- You can edit the /etc/grub/40_custom file to add custom entries to boot your other OS. (If the default loader keeps changing automatically, you might need to do this on both distributions.) This question and answers describe how to do this to add Windows to GRUB; adding a second GRUB would be similar. There's also the GRUB Customizer application, described here, which may be helpful.\n\n*Create a 100% manual GRUB configuration -- You can go one step further from the preceding and create your own 100% custom GRUB configuration. The trouble is that automated scripts will try to wipe it out, but if you can disable those scripts, this approach should work pretty well. A variant of this is to set up an isolated GRUB in its own directory (say, /boot/efi/EFI/grub). This old page provides instructions on doing this. Note that you really do want that page, not the newer one it says is more up-to-date.\n\n*Use the firmware's boot manager to choose which GRUB to launch -- If each distribution's GRUB can boot its own OS, then you can use your firmware's built-in boot manager to select which one to launch. Typically, this boot manager is accessed by hitting Esc, Enter, or a function key (usually a high one, in the F8-to-F12 range) as the computer powers on.\n\n*Add a third-party boot manager to choose which GRUB to launch -- Some computers have poor built-in boot managers, or require you hit the right key during such a short period of time that doing so is next to impossible. For them, you could use a third-party boot manager, such as gummiboot or my own rEFInd, to select which GRUB to launch. This option leads in to the next one, though....\n\n*Switch to another boot loader entirely -- The Linux kernel can function as its own boot loader. Thus, if you use another boot manager, you can use it to launch the kernel directly, bypassing GRUB entirely. (A boot manager lets you choose what to boot, whereas a boot loader loads and executes a kernel.) There are also other boot loaders, such as ELILO and SYSLINUX, which are easier to manually configure than GRUB 2. In sum, you have a lot of options to move away from GRUB. See my Web page on the subject for my detailed thoughts on them, or my answer to this question for a summary.\n\n\nThat list is probably not exhaustive; it's just the possibilities that spring to mind. Overall, I'd say that tweaking the GRUB configuration (either by manually editing 40_custom or by using GRUB Customizer) or switching to rEFInd are likely to be your best bets. The other options are more difficult, more awkward, or halfway efforts. (OTOH, some people are quite happy with each of those options, so they are worth considering.)\n", "Q: How to uninstall flareGet?

Ubuntu 16.04 alpha uses version 5.36, and works flawlessly, even without the correct oid for my mouse in the gnome-bluetooth pin database.\nThe basic problem with 14.04 is that the link key is not saved when the mouse is paired, so the connection is not really complete.

I would like to duel boot with Windows, but I cannot figure out how to partition the hard drive. I am pretty new to linux but have tried using GParted and KVPM. However, neither seems to want to let me resize the largest partition and make it unallocated so I will have room to make a partition large enough to install Windows.\n\nA: For beginners, like me, it's best to install Windows first and then Ubuntu because, so far I know, more recent Windows versions override installed boot info. After Windows installation, boot from Ubuntu bootable DVD/USB. During Ubuntu installation, you should get a window regarding boot-loader with one option saying something like  install Ubuntu alongside other Operating Systems. Selecting this option will let dual boot. After both installations are complete, default boot will be Ubuntu; it can be changed from the BIOS.\n", "Q: How to install VideoLAN Movie Creator?

Although I know my way around a computer, I am not familiar with ubuntu at all except for a few commands years ago.\nThe goal is to use this system for simulations & learning algorithms, including deep learning.

You mentioned that it happened after installing bumblebee, so obviously something went wrong when installing this. It is possible for the bumblebee installation to blacklist the nvidia drivers. To revert the bumblebee installation, please check if /etc/modprobe.d/bumblebee.conf exists, If so, make a backup if this file, and then remove it.\nsudo cp /etc/modprobe.d/bumblebee.conf ~/\nsudo rm /etc/modprobe.d/bumblebee.conf\n\nReboot to update the changes.\n", "Q: Is there any terminal viewer of CHM files in Ubuntu?

To have more than that, you need to create an extended partition and then create logical partitions inside that.  Recent versions of Windows tend to steer you towards converting the disk to a \"dynamic disk\" instead of using extended partitions when you try to create more than 4 primary partitions.  This is not compatible with linux.  If windows sees the disk as a dynamic disk, you will need to delete the partition, convert the disk back to a basic disk, delete one of the 4 primary partitions, and reuse that space as an extended partition.\n", "Q: Samba: check file for completeness I have a device (with Ubuntu on it) with Samba installed.  There is also a cron job that copies files out of the Samba share every 60 seconds.  I am now running into a situation where the cron job sometimes moves incomplete files--as in the file is still being streamed to from over the network.  This especially happens when the files are very large.\nIs there a way to check for completeness of a file?  Or, is there a Samba setting that will lock the file (keep it from being moved) till it is complete?\n\nA: Until the file transfer is completed, the file will be in use (opened) by the Samba process. You can test for that by means of the fuser command. So your move command would be something like:\nif [[ ! fuser /my/file ]]; then \n    mv /my/file /somewhere/else \nfi \n\nThis will only attempt to move the file if the file is closed, which means that the transfer was completed.\n", "Q: How to execute a command in multiple Terminals by executing a command in only one?

I am going to be using gnome-terminal if that makes any difference.\nI am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18 and the other machines should be running the same.\n\nA: One that I have used is ClusterSSH to send to multiple terminal windows at once.\nsudo apt-get install clusterssh\n\nClusterSSH will open its own terminal windows that you can send commands to with the application.  Once in ClusterSSH press Ctrl+Shift++ or click on Hosts in the menu and select Add host(s) or cluster(s) and type in all you want open separated by space between each one.  You should get a window looking like this one:\n\nthen any command that you want to send to all the windows at once you type in the box below the File Hosts Send Help menu items.\nI have also written a script that you can run from a command prompt to open as many Cluster SSH windows as you want.  I do recommend that before you use this script to run ssh-copy-id localhost so that it launches without asking to enter a password.\nThe script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [[ $1 == \"\" ]]; then\n\necho -n \"Please enter number of CSSH windows you want to open: \"\nread num1\n\nelse\n\nnum1=$1\n\nfi\n\nif [[ ! ${num1} || ${num1} = *[^0-9]* ]]; then\n    echo \"${num1} is invalid input.

There is no way around this; you only have one IP address and anyone coming from the outside needs to use this address. \nIf you want different traffic to go to your servers, you need to set port forwarding appropriately (for example port 80 to 192.168.1.2 and port 53 to 192.168.1.3). You set this in your router's NAT configuration.

As you can tell, I am not not very familiar with Bash's inner workings or syntax regarding files.\n\nA: \nI have a faint memory of it looking something like this: scrot\n  '%d/%m-lulzol.jpg' -e imgur $f and then some xargs. It does not\n  recognize $f now though.\n\n$f is using parameter substitution. It sounds like you were using it in a for-loop, probably something like for f in $(ls);....\n\nIs there some kind of general variable used for stdout from a previous\n  command in Bash?\n\nI/O redirection. (there is no such thing as a 'general variable' in BASH btw.)\n\nWhat I want to do is take a scrot, upload it to imgur and send the\n  stdout from imgur.sh to xclip so the imgur url is added to my\n  clipboard.\n\nI am unfamiliar with imgur.sh, but based on your memory of using xargs, I would say the command would look something like:\nscrot '%d/%m-lulzol.jpg' -e imgur.sh <imagename> | xargs xclip\nThis uses scrot to execute imgur.sh on a given image (< day >/< month >-lulzol.jpg), then pipes the stdout (presumably the image URL?) to xargs, which feeds it as an argument to xclip, which copies it to your clipboard.\n\nA: From man scrot:\n[...]\n       -e, --exec APP\n            Exec APP on the saved image.\n[...]\nSPECIAL STRINGS\n       Both the --exec and filename parameters  can  take  format  specifiers\n       that  are  expanded by scrot when encountered.  There are two types of\n       format specifier. Characters preceded by a  '%'  are  interpretted  by\n       strftime(2). See man strftime for examples.  These options may be used\n       to refer to the current date and time.  The second kind  are  internal\n       to  scrot  and are prefixed by '$' The following specifiers are recog‐\n       nised:\n\n       $f image path/filename (ignored when used in the filename)\n[...]\n\nSo the command would be:\nscrot '%d/%m-scrot.jpg' -e 'imgur $f | xclip'\n\nA nonsense example just to show that the command passed to -e works even if containing pipes:\n% scrot -e 'echo $f | grep 2015'\n2015-12-02-015014_1366x768_scrot.png\n% scrot -e 'echo $f | grep 2016'\n% \n\n", "Q: How to show the menu bar in Thunar in Xubuntu 15.10?

My goal is to use a smaller 3:2 resolution.\nFor a while now, I've been using a few commands to reset the resolution on my Chroot of Unity 14.04 (commands below). This works fine as a temporary fix, but it's a little bothersome to reset the resolution to stock settings whenever I log in or out of the chroot. \nHere are the commands I use:\ncvt 1680 1120 60\nxrandr --newmode \"1680x1120_60.00\" 157.00 1680 1792 1968 2256  1120 1123 1133 1162 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode eDP1 1680x1120_60.00\n\nI attempted converting the commands to a bash file, but when run, xrandr gave many errors. \nIf I could simply add a 3:2 resolution (perhaps close to 1680x1120) to xrandr permanently, that would be perfect.\nEDIT: I followed this article on dnschneid's crouton wiki to get my current results, which just need to be made persistent.

Ubuntu does not use systemd during this time so that is why no data is available.  If you don't use any fancy partitioning you can try doing without it and this might save some time, or at least give usable bootchart data for that time, but it appears you are using an encrypted filesystem.

Take care what environment variables your script needs to be successful. I assume, since your script must run after an X server has started, you need proper environment variables such as $DISPLAY and $XAUTHORITY and maybe also $DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS.\n\n*If you have trouble, take a look at /var/log/upstart/myjob.log where all output of your job goes.\n\n", "Q: Unable to enter password to login in control alt f1 screen Disclaimer: I am BRAND new to Ubuntu.\nA quick background: my laptop hard drive crashed, I bought a new one, didn't want to pay for windows for an old laptop, installed ubuntu, it worked great for a week. \nOne day I booted up and logged in and got a black screen (no cursor showing as many have).

Let's call them A.deb, B.deb and C.deb. Each package has a corresponding source package A.dsc and A.tar.gz, B.dsc and B.tar.gz, C.dsc and C.tar.gz. The packages depend on each other: C.deb depends on B.deb and B.deb depends on A.deb\nIf I modify A.deb, I need to rebuild B.deb or it won't work. The same goes for B.deb and C.deb. Is there a way to automate this process? Is there perhaps a tool or script that will do it for me? If not, how could I automate it myself?\nIn addition, There are not my packages.\n\nA: You would use a Makefile with the build dependencies declared, for example as follows:\ndefault: A.deb B.deb C.deb\n\nC.deb: B.deb C.dsc C.tar.gz\n        <command(s) to build C.deb>\n\nB.deb: A.deb B.dsc B.tar.gz\n        <command(s) to build B.deb>\n\nA.deb: A.dsc A.tar.gz\n        <command(s) to build A.deb>\n\nNote that the command indentation is a TAB.\nWith that Makefile, you would use the command\nmake\n\nand this would work out which packages to build and in which order, and then build them, all depending on the timestamps of the files. E.g., if say B.tar.gz has a timestamp later than B.deb (i.e. package B has new source), then that'd cause firstly B.deb to be rebuilt, and as that would make it be stamped later than C.deb, it would cause C.deb to be rebuilt as well.\n\nA: Well, maybe I'm totally missing your point, but it sounds like you're recompiling package A and want to recompile packages B & C, wich I would simply us a makefile for.\n", "Q: Install windows in emulator from Windows USB backup Right now I have a dual boot system - Windows 10 and Ubuntu 14.04. As I only rarely use Windows I pondered on reinstalling Ubuntu so it can take over the whole disk space and install Windows in emulator. My question is whether I can fully install windows using the USB backup/recovery drive.\n\nA: You could could use virtualbox  to run a virtual version of windows 10 within Ubuntu you could store the virtual image in any location you wish including a USB although it should be noted this would not be \"emulating\" Windows 10, it would simple be running within a virtual machine.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: Installing Windows on an emulator is not possible with a \"Recovery Disk\" made either using the recovery partition or the USB/DVD that came with your device (unless it's Windows 7 or earlier).\nThe installation will halt midway or if it will even finish then you won't be able to activate it.\nThe newer OEM installation media only works for the devices of that OEM and that too is not cross-model compatible.\nYou cannot use an HP OEM disc to install on a Lenovo workstation, neither can you use a Dell Precision OEM disc on an Dell Inspirion.\nThe exact reasons are beyond my knowledge but it's that way right now.\n", "Q: Linux command/networking I was just wondering what does this command do in terminal.

No server, just desktop and my home wifi router.\nThank you.\n\nA: *\n\n*SOCKS is a proxy server that allows TCP based application data to relay across the firewall, even if the firewall would block the packets. The SOCKS protocol is independent from application protocols, so it can be used for many services, e.g, WWW, FTP, TELNET, and others.\n\n*sockd IPaddress -j DROP , here once your proxy server has received any type/service bases request from the given IP at IPADDRESS field it will drop all the traffic from that IP.\nThis is similar to \niptables -I INPUT -s xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -j DROP \n\nIn IPTables.\n", "Q: How do i uninstall kde packages with unmet dependencies?

I'd Installed an Ubuntu and I don't know how to delete a history in Terminal. Can you help me?\n\nA: Delete the file .bash_history in your home directory.\n\nA: Use history -c command to delete terminal history\n\nA: Enter this command\ncat /dev/null > ~/.bash_history && history -c && exit\n\nYou must use history -c because the history will come back after re-login. The history entries have a copy in the memory and it will flush back to the file when you log out.\n/dev/null is a special system file that its content is null. So if you throw it into ~/.bash_history, it will completely remove the history of bash contained in ~/.bash_history.

I like to keep Ubuntu light and I only use it for surfing the internet and logging into my accounts.\nIf I download a shady program on Windows 7, can it infect the Ubuntu partition?\n\nA: In general, malware targeted on Windows systems can't infect systems of such a different type as Linux is. Other than that, Windows is not capable of accessing or even detecting ext4 (and similar) file systems, which are used by Ubuntu, without having special drivers installed,  so to Windows, your Ubuntu partition looks unused/unformatted.\nAlthough this might read as if your dual-boot Ubuntu installation was 100% safe from harm through Windows or Windows applications (including malware), but this is unfortunately not the case.\nWe said that Windows can't access the Ubuntu partition's file system, but it can very well access the raw partition (and format it itself or overwrite it otherwise) or the partition table (and delete or move/resize the partition, which destroys it as well). And whatever Windows can do, a good enough malware program can do too.\nAlso I claimed that Windows applications are not runnable on Ubuntu, so that if such a malware managed to get on your file system, you could not accidentally run it with Ubuntu. This is true for compiled binaries (\"exe\"/PE files on Windows - in contrast to mainly ELF files on Linux, but no filename extension needed), which are usually platform-dependent. There are however also cross-platform executables and especially scripts (Python, Java, ...) which may be run or interpreted on both system types. Same with malware embedded into documents like PDF files.\nSo to conclude: There's no 100% safety. I would guess that 99% of all Viruses you can get on your Windows system are not able to do harm to your Ubuntu installation, but there's still 1% left. Make regular backups and nothing should be able to worry you.\n\nA: As a general rule: yes, it could.\nThis is because, by definition, when you download a piece of \"malware\", you don't really know what is it that it's doing. It will have (low-level) access to the disk, so it could do things to your linux installation, even if it is not mounted, and it uses a different filesystem.\nIf your linux installation has full volume encryption, then it may be safer because everything is encrypted. The malware could however damage it. Also, it could plug itself into the boot directory (which is unencrypted) and then wait until you start Ubuntu.\nAll of this is highly unlikely, because it would require a malware that specifically targets Ubuntu. However...who may know??\n\nA: For starters : Windows can't even mount an ext file system by default in the first place, so the chances of Windows accessing your Ubuntu partition is very unlikely and a Windows virus that infects a Linux machine on another drive or partition is still very unlikely.\nWindows viruses have no affect on a Linux Operating system, so there is no need to worry.\nIn my opinion\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows viruses run on Windows and can't infect any thing else other\nthan Windows.\n\n*Linux viruses run on Linux and can't infect any thing else other than\nLinux.\n\n", "Q: How do I get Ubuntu 15.10 to show the desktop version I downloaded and installed Ubuntu 15.10 alongside Windows 8.1. Everything was fine and working.\nThen I booted my computer and it goes to terminal, asks for login and then password, and then something like this pops up on black screen \ntammy@tammy 1629 $~\n\nSo I'm assuming it's like a command line. I get nowhere fast. So I go and look up Linux commands and try to work it out. I can't get to the desktop version, I can't get apt-get to work, because everything I want to do says I need to install it via apt-get, things that are installed I can't access because they are locked, or could not be parsed or opened.\nI cannot even use my USB ports, DVD, nothing so installing it again won't work. I can not even get back into Window 8.1 because I don't see the partition to know where it is.\nSo what I have here is a screen and a bunch of headaches and just when I think I can solve one of them, it leads me into another problem... \napt-get install ???

I am aware that the terminated one doesn't do anything but it would be nice to get rid of it. If it is not possible without the system restarting I will have to live with, no problem.\nTIA ;)\n\nA: From your comment, you stopped the process with Ctrl-z (which is not the same as terminating).\nIf you want to kill the process, you have a few options\n\n\n*\n\n*Restore it to foreground and kill it.\n\n\nUse these commands:\n$ fg\nCtrl+c\n\n\n*Kill it while stopped.\n\n\nJust:\n$ kill %\n\n\n\n*For completeness-sake (although not specific to your question), you could also tell it to resume and work in background.\n\n\nCommands:\n$ bg   # for background\n$ jobs # to see what is running in background (current shell)\n\n", "Q: Plymouth check gets stuck, preventing service operation This is a strange one.

I've done a fresh install of Ubuntu last week. My server is a DELL Inspiron 580. What could be wrong?\n\nA: Nothing is wrong. Your computer is noticing that it is warmer than it wants to be, and firing up the fan to cool off.

It will be available at least in official LTS repository or we need to wait the next Ubuntu release? \n\nA: The new upstream PHP 7.0 won't be supported in existing releases.  The policy on bringing new stuff to existing releases is very clear on that -> only security releases go in.  You can read about the Ubuntu policy here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates\nThe good news is that Ubuntu 16.04 LTS will be released with PHP 7.0 packages.  Nish from Canonical made an heroic effort to push my Debian packaging into Ubuntu 16.04 and he has also updated many packages that depend on PHP and cleaned up the rest that doesn't support PHP 7.0 (yet or never will).\nIf you want to use PHP 7.0 on older Ubuntu releases, the only way is to use some external means, like my ppa:ondrej/php PPA that carry co-installable PHP 5.6 and PHP 7.0 for Ubuntu 14.04 and later.\n\nA: PHP 7.0 is currently available in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS BETA.

I have tried many options from boot-repair, bootrec in windows and I still can't resolve it. \nThe problem is that windows will boot when in legacy mode but hangs when in UEFI - it hangs at classpnp.sys. Now, the grub menu will not load when in legacy mode so I cannot get into ubuntu. I can see the grub menu when booting in UEFI mode but on selecting the windows boot loader, it runs until classpnp.sys. The only option I have at the moment to switch between linux and windows is changing between legacy and UEFI. \nI know there are many posts similar to this so apologies for bringing it back up - it's a big frustration. I have tried this Windows 7 hangs up after Ubuntu dual-boot installation to no avail. Any ideas would be very welcome.\nMany thanks,\nMRF\nPs. I know it isn't a classpnp.sys problem as that is the last thing it loads. Interestingly I ran safe mode in legacy (when windows does start) and no other drivers are loaded after classpnp.sys as far as I can see.\n\nA: Most OS installations, including Windows, are made in one boot mode (BIOS/CSM/legacy or EFI/UEFI). Switching to another boot mode requires installing a new boot loader, and often changing the partition table type (MBR to GPT or vice-versa). Switching quickly from one boot mode to another is possible with Linux, which is pretty flexible; but I've never heard of successful dynamic boot-mode switching with Windows.\nA second issue to consider is that it's almost always best to coordinate boot modes across OSes. That is, if Windows is configured to boot in EFI mode, you should install Linux in EFI mode too; and if Windows is in BIOS mode, you should install Linux in BIOS mode, too. Doing otherwise is possible, but requires extra hoop-jumping.\nIn most cases, Windows is the first OS installed on a computer. Thus, you should determine the Windows boot mode. This is normally tied to the partition table type: The Windows BIOS-mode boot loader understands MBR but not GPT, and the Windows EFI-mode boot loader likes to see GPT. You can easily check your partition table type in Linux:\n$ sudo parted -l | grep Table\nPartition Table: gpt\n\nIf you get several lines of output, that means you've got several disks. (Removable disks count, so remove them first.) A GPT disk shows up as being of type gpt and an MBR disk shows up as of type msdos. Using this information, you should know how Windows should be booting. If you've got multiple disks and they're of different types, you'll need to figure out the type of the Windows boot disk.\nIf you've installed Linux in the wrong mode, the solution is to install an appropriate boot loader for Linux. It sounds like you've got a BIOS-mode Windows install but you've managed to convince Ubuntu to install in EFI mode. (This requires some tenacity, but can be done.) If so, you should install the grub-pc package, which will replace grub-efi, then run sudo grub-install /dev/sda to install GRUB. You may also need to do an update-grub. Alternatively, the Boot Repair program should do this all automatically, but you must run it from the proper boot mode, which may mean booting an emergency disk in the right boot mode.\nIf you run parted and find that your partition table type is GPT rather than MBR, then something else is going on -- chances are GRUB has misidentified your Windows boot loader. In this case, I'd need more information to offer a specific suggestion for a repair. The RESULTS.txt file generated by Boot Info Script would be helpful. Post it to a pastebin site and post the URL to your document here.\n\nEDIT:\nBased on your Boot Info Script output, you've got a GPT disk, and there's no evidence of any BIOS-mode Windows boot loaders installed on any of your partitions or in your MBR. Furthermore, the partition layout is consistent with what an OEM delivers with Windows pre-installed in EFI mode. Thus, it's unlikely that Windows is booting in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, as you state at the start of your question. I suspect that you've enabled the CSM in your firmware and Windows boots with that enabled, so you've mistakenly assumed that Windows is booting in BIOS mode. That's an unjustified conclusion, for reasons I explain on this Web page. To simplify the boot process, I recommend you disable the CSM (aka \"legacy support\" or something similar) in your firmware, at least for testing. With it enabled, you throw the dice for boot mode whenever you boot a new device (like an OS installer).\nOTOH, Boot Info Script has also failed to turn up evidence of an EFI-mode Windows boot loader. Sometimes it simply fails in this task, for reasons I don't understand; but it's also possible that the files are missing. You may want to look for them \"by hand.\" The most important file is EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi on the ESP -- that is, /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi from Ubuntu.\nYour Boot Info Script output indicates that both EFI-mode and BIOS-mode versions of GRUB are installed, and your GRUB configuration file is set to chainload to the (possibly non-existent) EFI-mode Windows boot loader.\nOverall, I recommend you try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Windows in whatever way you can and disable the Windows (not firmware) feature called \"Fast Startup,\" as described here. This feature, if enabled, causes nothing but trouble on dual-boot configurations, and it could be a cause of at least some of your problems.\n\n*After this is done, reboot to Windows a couple of times and shut down cleanly. This should get the disks properly unmounted.\n\n*Try booting to Windows via GRUB. It may begin working at this point, but I can make no promises.\n\n*If GRUB still can't boot Windows, download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager and prepare a boot medium.\n\n*Boot to the rEFInd medium. It should show options to boot both Windows and Ubuntu. Try them both.\n\n*If rEFInd boots both your OSes, install its PPA or Debian package version. rEFInd should then take over from GRUB as your primary boot manager.\n\n*If this fails, you could try Boot Repair, but I'm skeptical it will help, since I don't see anything obviously wrong with the GRUB configuration, based on your Boot Info Script output, except possibly for a missing Windows boot loader file. Speaking of which....\n\n*If you find the bootmgfw.efi is missing, you can skip all of the above after step #1. Instead, you must re-install the Windows boot loader, which you must do using Windows recovery media. After doing this, you'll probably have to use EasyUEFI or bcdedit to reset GRUB as the default boot manager.\n\n\nA: the solution for me is to start with the  W7 advanced boot options\nand use : Disable Driver Signature Enforcement.\nafther this, dont shut down your win 7 simply hibernate.\nI hope it`ll be useful to you\n", "Q: How does the apt-get purge command work? How does 'it' (ie. purge) know where the dependencies and configuration files are located?\nHow does purge find out that a particular piece of software created a certain file?\nIs there some sort of configuration file that records the creation of all files by programs, so that purge can access the records and match up the files to the program during removal?\n\nA: Yes, there are such files. In particular, *.list, *.postrm , and *.conffiles, which are all stored in /var/lib/dpkg/info directory. \nThe .postrm files are post-remove scripts, that run after a package is removed. Those scripts are responsibility of the package maintainers, and each script is tailored to the specific package. If you examine  /var/lib/dpkg/info/usb-modeswitch-data.postrm for example , you will see something like this:  \n#!/bin/sh\nset -e\n# Automatically added by dh_installdeb\ndpkg-maintscript-helper rm_conffile \"/etc/usb_modeswitch.d/230d:0001\" 20101222-3 -- \"$@\"\n# End automatically added section\n\nThere's also *.list and *.conffiles files, which are basically lists. gnome-terminal.list, for example, will list all files and directories created when gnome-terminal was installed. The *.list files are very useful for determining what installed what.  *.conffiles list all the config files for a package. For instance, while xterm.list gives all the files , `xterm.conffiles* gives only conffiles. In other words, the contents of conffile will also be present in list file.\n$ cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/xterm.conffiles                                       \n/etc/X11/app-defaults/XTerm\n/etc/X11/app-defaults/KOI8RXTerm-color\n/etc/X11/app-defaults/XTerm-color\n/etc/X11/app-defaults/UXTerm-color\n/etc/X11/app-defaults/UXTerm\n/etc/X11/app-defaults/KOI8RXTerm\n\nI don't quite know how   *.conffiles work. My assumption is that the post-removal scripts take priority, and apt-get just uses those *.conffiles to double check that files listed there were removed. \nAs @A.B. properly reminded me, there are also *.prerm files, some of which do remove the .conf files, but not necessarily, for instance the one for xpdf app was removing the files in /etc/xpdf/includes directory\n", "Q: How to set the hide Time of the Launchbar higher? I found a duplicate of my question, but with the opposite intention.\nAlso, the Answer shows where the setting is, but not how to find the File\nwith the quoted text. Neither if it is possible to edit it.\nOr does following mean that it is Impossible to alter it?\n\nThis seems to be hard coded into the Unity source. See here on line 32:\n\nHere is the quoted Q&A:\n\nHow to set the launcher hide delay time?\n\nAs I am new to Linux based operating systems, I wanted to ask IF it\nis possible to edit the /launcher/LauncherHideMachine.cpp as I can \nnot even find the file...\nMy intention would be to change \nconst unsigned int HIDE_DELAY_TIMEOUT_LENGTH = 400\n\nto this value:\nconst unsigned int HIDE_DELAY_TIMEOUT_LENGTH = 900\n\nBest Regards!\n\nA: That is a hard coded value.  There is no configuration option to change it.\nTo change it you would have to recompile the software yourself with the change you want, which can be painful and be a massive headache from a package management perspective.  There is also no guarantee that a recompiled version will work as nicely either.\n", "Q: SMTP SERVER for redirect mails in good dns I am a student, and i have a formation period.\nThey asked me to create a SMTP server/proxy for dispatch mails in one network with two DNS. In function of the domain of the receiver.\nExample :\nA is in DNS 1\nB is in DNS 2\nMy server is out of this network , just like if i was in front of my house door and i tell to people coming in where they have to go, two choices ;).\nI send an email to A, my server have to find in wich dns it is and send him well.\nI just want that you tell me the steps i have to do. A tutorial would be so perfect .. :p\nSorry if there is languages mistakes etc ... i am french ;)\n\nA: i won't be doing your work :)  - but if I understand correctly your case, check \"transports\". Long story short - depending on recipient's domain (or even just mail address or so) your \"proxy server\" will forward mail to the proper destination mail server. You'll have to build a table of records with matching recipient/recipient domain and proper smtp server to forward email. Not sure what server exactly you want to use for it - or is it just some theoretical case. But anyway - Postfix does it in quite easy to understand way - so you may be good reading its manuals.\n", "Q: phpMyAdmin on Linux takes too long to load Why does it take too long to load the database that I had just created? Other actions like executing a sql statement works.  Btw, I'm running a Linux OS in my flash drive. Does this happen because I'm running it on a flash drive?\n\nA: If you have an older flash drive with much slower writes than reads (which many had once upon a time), I could see this behavior happening.\n\nA: If you installed phpmyadmin trough apt-get, eg sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin, than it might be worthwhile to download the newest version of phpmyadmin. Just download the zip/tar file and extract it in /var/www/html.\n", "Q: remote accessing linux system I would like to access my Linux system's command shell remotely.\nThe system runs at home behind a router which connects it to the internet. I was thinking I could forward a port on the router to the IP address of the Linux system, so I can use any SSH client to connect to my home IP address and will be forwarded to the computer.\nNow, I´m fairly new to Linux, so please excuse me if I ask any obvious questions.\nSo is this a sensible idea? What do I have to do to make this solution safe? I can see I have tons of users which I didn't create myself, will they have default passwords which could by abused to access my system? How can I check for this? Should I use another approach all together?\n\nA: You just have to forward port 22 (default) from your router to the computer's IP address (make sure it is static).\nIdeally set up iptables firewall rules - this is a big job.\nAlso learn about ssh and ssh hardening (you will want to use keys and not passwords).\nI wouldn't worry about the additional users unless you added any yourself. They are there for other services/daemons. Also check your sudoers file to see who has root permissions etc.\n\nA: Setting up SSH access is a normal security risk for servers. \nYou will need to setup dynamic DNS (DDNS) unless you have a static IP address. Most residential customers have addresses that change periodically, and you need some way to advertise to the outside world when your address changes. Some routers have support for this out of the box, but otherwise you can setup a DDNS client on your server. \nSee steeldriver's link on hardening SSH. \n", "Q: /gvsf empty, gvsf-fuse not working (Ubuntu 14.04) In my work U usually have to manage a lot of files through SMB / shared folders, sometimes I use Uget to download files directly to server. Uget does not support smb, so I use /gvfs virtual folder to make it work.\nRecentlly gvfs became empty and I faced serious problems sending files directly from uget to the server.

The command will work whether or not I have the -f switch (you can use another terminal to list the /run/user/1000/gvfs directory).\nI am having the same problem.  I am not sure why it stopped working.  I am thinking this may be caused by a bug described here.  Since I can work around by unmounting and running gvfsd-fuse again, I'm going to let it be for now.  Those commands can be made to run automatically on boot.\n", "Q: I cannot open or mount a drive that locked with bitlocker they says there is a application called dislocker can help, I tried, but it is not even installing in my Ubuntu 14.04, I don't that I followed the steps, but the erroro occures, I see there is no specific way for how to install dislocker in ubuntu 14.04, they all telling how to install in Linux like... anyone can help me..?

You need to provide an explicit space to put it, a small (1-2M (That's M not G!)) partition with the grub-bios flag should do it.  Then grub will fully install and work.\n\nA: I am pretty new to this, so it took me a while before understanding how to solve a similar problem. In my case it was a bit easier, since I just chose to install Ubuntu on my whole computer.\nBut, this is what I understood:\n\n*\n\n*Using the first link given by sudodus I used sudo parted -l in a terminal to read what sort of partitions my disk had.\n\n*It printed out the list of the partitions.

It must be located at the start of a GPT disk, and have a boot flag.\"\n\n*The same sudo parted -l printout told me that the EFI was located at the start of the disk and it had a boot flag.\n\n*So, I restarted and opened the BIOS.

I has taken a while but I have managed. The only resulting problem was that when I start my computer I can only access a boot menu where Ubunty appears if I press F9.\nIn order to get a decent boot menu I have learnt that Win 8 is messing around very badly and being evil as Microsoft does so well. I have tried to go through this jungle of unknown terms for me (UEFI, Grub, etc.) and the difficulties that Win 8 creates when I found a little piece of software for Win 8 that apparently would solve my problems allowing to edit the boot menu so I get what I have. It's called EasyBCD 2.2.0.182.\nI'm sure it's a good programme when used by wise hands. However, I managed to create a menu with a few options where none of them would be valid! I could only access Ubuntu through the esc key but I can't access windows anymore.\nSo, is there a way I can edit the boot menu from Ubuntu? Maybe using the Win software I mentioned from Ubuntu (I believe this can be done) to undo the problematic menu I created?\nThanks!!!\nCarlos\n\nA: The last I heard (which was a while ago), EasyBCD was pretty useless on EFI-based computers. Unless you can find EFI-specific instructions, I'd stop messing with it, since you aren't likely to get very far and could actually make matters worse.\nInstead, I recommend you check out EasyUEFI, which provides a point-and-click interface to the EFI boot manager. You should be able to use this to set the ubuntu entry first, which will in turn launch GRUB, which should enable you to boot either Windows or Ubuntu. (If GRUB has no Windows entry, then that's another problem.)\nIn some cases, computers \"forget\" or ignore their EFI boot entries. The fact that you're having the problem that you're reporting suggests that this may be the case for you. If so, the best solution is to return the computer for a refund and get another one, since computers with this problem are defective. There are ugly workarounds, but until people start telling manufacturers that they won't accept defective merchandise, manufacturers will continue to deliver it. You'll need to try a few things (like EasyUEFI) before you can be certain you're in this boat, though.\n", "Q: How to keep grub independent of all the OSes?

I think I will go with the dedicated grub setup. I read about rEFInd bootloader somewhere and it looks like a no-maintainance required tool. Would it be compatible with every Linux distro out there?\nPS: I am fairly new to bootloaders and the deepest I have been was editing some grub.cfg files to move the Windows entry to the top and to rename the entries.\nPPS: Some background info:\nI had installed both Ubuntu and Ubuntu GNOME (both 15.04) in the unallocated space using 40GB for each. I then wanted to keep only Ubuntu GNOME but I had installed Ubuntu Unity after I had installed Ubuntu GNOME. So deleting Ubuntu Unity would make the grub disappear. I want to avoid these kind of scenarios by keeping GRUB2 independent of every other thing.\n\nA: The problem with a multiple-Linux-distribution configuration is that you'll end up with multiple GRUB installations, which is redundant and confusing. Each distribution will set its own GRUB up as the default and configure it either to chainload other distributions' GRUBs or to boot their kernels directly (or maybe to do both things). There are problems with this:\n\n\n*\n\n*When you boot a distribution whose GRUB is not the primary one and update its kernel, chances are the controlling GRUB's configuration will not be updated. If the controlling GRUB boots other distributions' kernels directly and if kernel updates happen often enough, the distribution with updated kernels may stop booting because the original kernels will be gone. Even if the distribution continues to boot, it will be via an older kernel that may have security or other problems. You'll then have to go to the distribution whose GRUB is in charge and run update-grub (or something equivalent) to get it working again. A chainload configuration is more robust against such problems, so if you have a choice, that's how I'd set it up.\n\n*After an update to their own GRUB packages, many distributions will try to reset their own GRUBs as the default. The result can be that which GRUB boots first will change every now and then. If one does a better job than the others, you'll then have to use efibootmgr to reset the boot priorities from time to time.\n\n*If you delete the distribution whose GRUB launches by default, chances are its GRUB will stop working. (This isn't always the case, since it depends on where GRUB stores its configuration files, but it's the way most distributions set things up.) You can bypass this problem by using the firmware's built-in boot manager, but it's still a nuisance -- and a serious problem for users who don't know how to use the firmware's boot manager. (After the first boot when this happens, you'd need to install another distribution or use efibootmgr to set another GRUB as the default to avoid having to use the firmware's boot manager.)\n\n\nThese problems are not insurmountable, but they are nuisances. Setting up one boot manager as the default bypasses these issues, but usually requires manual configuration that's likely to take more effort than it does to overcome the problems I've just described. rEFInd (which I maintain) is designed to bypass these problems by being less dependent on configuration files. In particular, rEFInd does not need per-kernel configuration, which every other Linux boot loader I know of does need. Instead, rEFInd relies on a configuration file that provides options that apply to every kernel in a given directory. This requires some explicit up-front configuration when you install a distribution, but that's a matter of running one script that comes with rEFInd (mkrlconf). Thereafter, when you upgrade your kernel, rEFInd doesn't need reconfiguration; it just takes the old options and applies them to the new kernel. (Note that GRUB does need reconfiguration after a kernel update. Ubuntu hides this by running scripts to do the reconfiguration as part of the kernel update/installation process -- but as noted earlier, these scripts update just one GRUB's configuration, which might not be the one that needs to be updated.)\nIf you install rEFInd, you'll still have the issue of each distribution trying to set its own GRUB as the default. There are usually ways around this, though. For Ubuntu, rather than booting the installation medium and selecting the option to install directly, you should boot to the \"try before installing\" mode, open a Terminal window, and then type ubiquity -b. This will run the installer and tell it to not install GRUB. The same trick can obviously also be used if you want some other distribution's GRUB to handle everything. To boot after installing in this way, rEFInd will have to have already been installed; or you could boot with rEFInd on a USB flash drive or CD-R and install it then.\nYou may want to figure out how easy it is to disable GRUB in each distribution you plan to install. Using that information, in conjunction with your own plans and priorities, you can decide which one(s) you want to install and which ones you want to bypass.\nAnother option to all of this is to use virtualization, like VirtualBox. If you've got enough memory, you can run half a dozen distributions simultaneously in virtual machines while another controls the computer as a whole. This approach bypasses boot loader conflicts, making configuration much simpler -- each OS is entirely in charge of its own \"computer.\"\n\nA: As @oldfred and @Wilf have pointed out in the comments, GRUB2 has matured a lot and can handle the situations I mentioned comfortably.\nThe solution to follow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take a backup of your ESP or EFI or Boot partition (the FAT32 partition).\n\n*Install the Linux distros you want to separate partitions (you can easily install all of the distro on a single / partition instead of making a separate /boot)\n\n*The distro which we will install the last will be the master and its grub will be used.\n\n*In case you want to, you can manually edit the grub.cfg in the EFI/distro directory on the EFI partition to manage all the bootloaders.\n\n\nExplanation for how it works:\nGRUB2 installs itself to /boot of the distro and makes a grub.cfg in a subdirectory in the EFI partition which then chainloads the actual grub.\n", "Q: How to change the name of the mountpoint of a Ubuntu partition I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 on VMware workstation 12 (my host OS is Win10).

The partition will be automatically mounted when defined by an entry to /etc/fstab\nUUID=<uuid>    <mountpoint>    ext4    defaults   0  2\n\nBy this we may create symbolic links in our HOME to directories on that extra partition, or we may move our entire HOME to there.\nConsider to make a snapshot before experimenting with partitions and mount points to be able to quickly revert in case something goes wrong.\n", "Q: recordmydesktop becomes invisible After starting recordmydesktop and clicking 'record' the window with recordmydesktop disappears.

The top command outputs a kind of live view of processes and their use of resources in a system.\nI'd like to start a program on a server installation, which starts a variety of different processes, with non-predictable PIDs, and capture the changing output of top, without having to rely on an ssh connection from a desktop environment. Preferably I'd like to be able to 'replay' this in the same CLI environment, as if it were a video, but could acceptably move the file elsewhere to view it like this.\nIs there a way, using command line only, from a direct terminal on a server installation, that I can record this output for a defined time period? Either by entering a value for time, or by manually starting and stopping the recording process.\n\nA: The regular mode of operation of top is not suitable for saving the output in a file.\nYou can use the -b (batch) mode of top along with appropriate time interval for checking (-d) and the number of iterations for count (-n).\nYou can also mention specific PIDs (-p) to check only.\nFor example:\ntop -b -d 5 -n 3 -p 1089,2345 >output.txt\n\nwill run top in batch mode, will do 3 iterations after 5 seconds each, and will only monitor two mentioned PIDs (1089,2345). The output will be saved in output.txt.\nChange the values to fit your need.\n\nA: You can use the 'script' and 'scriptreplay' utilities to accomplish this. \n\n\n*\n\n*run script with the --timing option: \nscript --timing=top.timing topscript\n\n*execute the top command, let it run as long as you want\n\n*exit top using q or control-c. \n\n*exit the script session with control-D (EOF) or by typing exit\n\n*run scriptreplay to replay the script: \nscriptreplay top.timing topscript\n\nA: This is not exactly the same as top, but you can use this script: \nwhile true; do\necho \necho $(date)\necho\nps -eo pid,user,pri,ni,vsize,rss,stat,pcpu,pmem,time,wchan --sort=-pcpu | head -20\nsleep 5 \ndone  > ps.log\n\nYou will have more or less the top info in the file ps.log.

I tried uninstalling Moodle on Ubuntu by running the command: \nsudo apt-get remove moodle \n\nbut the result I got was: \npackage moodle is not installed, so not removed \n\nbut I'm still able to access it.\nI want to try out a fresh moodle installation.\n\nA: All you have to do to remove moodle is to delete its code directory, data directory and database.\nIn theconfig.php you will find variable $CFG->dbtype that says what database engine is used with that installation and variable $CFG->dbname will tell you which database you should remove.\nIn the same config.php you will also find where data is configured and where is the code path set - variables to check are: $CFG->dataroot and $CFG->dirroot.\nIf you have absolutely no idea where to look for moodle installation, you have to check it in your apache/nginx (or other http server) configuration.\nBut to test a fresh moodle installation you don't have to remove the old one - you can install a fresh one next to the old one, configure it properly, create a new database for the fresh installation and configure your http server to point to that installation.\nIt is advisable not to install moodle from any distribution's repository but to take it from moodle's git, choosing the right branch according to the version of moodle you want to use.\n\nA: Uninstalling looks pretty straightforward:  These directions were copied directly from the moodle website\n**Webhost/manual installation:** If you have installed Moodle manually or have installed onto a webhost, follow these steps:\n\nDelete the moodle database using this mysql command (or delete using your mysql client, e.g. PHPMyAdmin):\n\n    sql>DROP DATABASE moodle;\n\nIn the above example replace 'moodle' with the name of the moodle database you created when installing.\n\nDelete the moodledata directory. If you, or your users, have uploaded materials into this directory take a copy of these before deleting this directory.\n\nDelete the moodle directory itself. This will delete all of the moodle PHP script files.\n\n**XAMPP windows installation:** If you have installed Moodle on windows through the XAMPP package, follow these steps:\n\nOpen cmd.exe and navigate to this directory within your installation directory:\n\n    server/mysql/bin\n\nRun this command, replacing USERNAME with your database username (the default is \"root\") and DATABASE with your database name (the default is \"moodle\"):\n\n    mysqladmin.exe -u USERNAME -p drop DATABASE\n\nEnter your database password at the prompt (the default is \"\" [blank]).\n\nEnter \"y\" to confirm the database drop.\n\nDelete the moodledata directory. If you, or your users, have uploaded materials into this directory take a copy of these before deleting this directory.\n\nDelete the moodle directory itself. This will delete all of the moodle PHP script files\n\n\nA: on your terminal : sudo /opt/lampp/apps/moodle/uninstall\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Display UNCLAIMED My computer's graphics seem to be having issues.

I can't do it though to the (well-known):\n\"The NTFS partition is in an unsafe state. Please resume and shutdown\nWindows fully (no hibernation or fast restarting), or mount the volume\nread-only with the 'ro' mount option.\"\nError, I don't have Windows installed anymore and when I tried to fix it with ntfsfix it just told me that \"ntfsfix refuses to operate with read-write mounted device\".\nThis may be a very simple Question, but as I said i'm new to Ubuntu so please don't be too harsh :) \nI wan't to access my Drive normally. Thanks  already for everyone helping :) \n\nA: In the past, when you were running Microsoft Windows, much of the disk's data, file metadata, disk metadata and possibly Secret Microsoft Stuff was kept in RAM, for quick, easy access. The way you last shutdown/turned off/pulled the plug on Windows kept it from bringing the disk to a consistent, up-to-date state. Thus, the The NTFS partition is in an unsafe state.... message.  \nI'm unfamiliar with ntfsfix, but ntfsfix refuses to operate with read-write mounted device means that you have the drive mounted with the read-write options, so that any other process can write to the disk while ntfsfix is performing disk surgery. This can lead to total confusion and data loss. You must unmount the disk first  \nsudo umount /dev/whatever  \n\nso that when you subsequently run ntfsfix, ntfsfix can ensure it has exclusive access to the disk. You still may not recover your data, but this will get you closer.\n", "Q: Is there a way to specify a certain range of numbers using array in a script? I'm trying to add the first 20 numbers I generated randomly with an array in my script. Is this possible?\nI used my previous script to generate 100 numbers and was hoping I could use it in this scenario as well. Now I need to add the first 20 using array. Could I incorporate a function into my script to solve this?\nMain Script\nMAXCOUNT=100\ncount=1\n\nwhile [ \"$count\" -le $MAXCOUNT ]; do\nnumber[$count]=$RANDOM\nlet \"count += 1\"\ndone\n\necho \"${number[@]}\n\n\nA: To add the first 20 numbers of the array number:\necho \"${number[@]:0:20}\" | tr ' ' '+' | bc\n\nOr\ntr ' ' '+' <<<\"${number[@]:0:20}\" | bc\n\n\n\n*\n\n*\"${number[@]:1:20}\" gets the first 20 elements of the array\n\n*tr ' ' '+' converts all spaces into + so that we can use it as input to bc to get the addition done\n\nA: I think you're asking how to get the first N elements of a bash array. If so, this should work:\n$ array=( $(seq 1 30 ) )\n$ echo ${array[@]}\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30\n$ echo ${array[@]:0:20}\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 \n\nThe general format is ${array[@]:START:LENGTH}. That will return the LENGTH next elements of array starting from START. \nSo, to add the first 20, you could do (note that I'm starting from 0, not 1 since arrays begin at 0. I suggest you correct your script and set count=0 at the beginning instead of count=1; if you don't want to, change the 0 below to a 1):\nfor i in ${number[@]:0:20}; do\n    sum=$((sum + i))\ndone\necho $sum\n\nAlternatively, you could just iterate over the first 20 elements of the array:\nfor((i=0;i<20;i++))\ndo\n    sum=$(( sum + number[$i] ))\ndone\necho \"$sum\"\n\nBoth methods assume you are adding integers. Bash doesn't deal with floating point numbers so they will break if you try to add fractions. If that's an issue, use @hemayl's clever trick or any other program that can do math. For example:\necho \"${number[@]:0:20}\" | perl -lane '$k+=$_ for @F; print $k'\n\n", "Q: what is the \"super\" key for linux shortcuts?

However, Gsettings doesn't work from Cron, and the solutions posted here and here don't seem to work, neither do those posted in the comments below them.\nThis is the script Cron is executing:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#Export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable\nPID=$(pgrep -o gnome-shell)\nexport DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=$(grep -z DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS/proc/$PID/environ|cut -d= -f2-)\n\n#Change theme\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme 'Arc-Dark'\ngsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.user-theme name 'Arc-Dark'\n\nAnd this is the error I'm getting in dead.letter (Crons' way of logging errors):\ngrep: /proc/1098/environ: Permission denied\n\n(process:28536): dconf-WARNING **: failed to commit changes to dconf: The given address is empty\n\n\ngrep: /proc/1098/environ: Permission denied\n\n(process:28811): dconf-WARNING **: failed to commit changes to dconf: The given address is empty\n\nI know I can use sudo -u to run the script, but I'd rather not use the root cron.\n\nA: I was having a similar issue running a dconf command from cron.

I have done a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 and 15.10 x64 on a 256GB drive using the whole disk. This is a NVMe and I initially suspected it.

Unity never completes loading now and I can only shutdown from terminal (console).\nI need to make some changes in the UEFI settings to boot from a live USB to get a better look tonight. I'm sticking with 15.10 as it supports my LAN and audio unlike 14.04 however this problem occurred under both.\n\nA: My main problem was that my /var/logs/kern.log and /var/logs/syslog had grown to 85 and 45 GB respectively. I deleted them. Then I rebooted and read the entries. I know better than to try to open an 85 gb file!\nAHCI USB 3.0 related error appeared over and over. My mainboard has usb 3.1 that I disabled in the bios as a quick fix since I don't need them now. These two logs are not growing now. However something else is slowly (much slower) taking space as the computer sits idle. I will have to track it down.\nThe USB 3.1 controller is an ASMedia ASM1142 Controller.\nOnce booted back in to Ubuntu I used the following to commands to make analysis of where the space was going.\nsudo apt-get install gksu\ngksudo baobab\n\nThat is root gui mode of Disk Usage Analyzer \n", "Q: Can't log in as a particular user after changing its password I reset both of my accounts passwords but only one will let me log in.

System tests play audio fine. \nI am suspecting Chrome and Firefox need some sort of package to play audio and that package got updated or removed. \nI have searched and found similar issues but not the same and the solutions did not apply or did not work. \nHow can I systematically debug this issue?\nUpdate: I tried some pulseaudio inspection and looking at logs and running google-chrome from the command line but nothing good. But then had the idea to launch a webapp (hangouts) that let me choose the output device. In hangouts I changed from 'default source' to 'built-in analog stereo' and then 'play a test sound'... and I have sound! If I then choose what appears to be the default of 'high definitional audio controller digital...' then I get no sound. \nSo I think the issue lies around the system thinking the default audio source is the digital and not the analog destination.\nUpdate2: My system sound settings only show one analog output. I do not have a digital output listed.\n\nA: Check in pulseaudio, pavu or whatever you use for volume control if firefox or chrome are sending the audio to the proper device. Else, it could be a jack related problem if jackd is running for applications such as arduor or some synthesizer, you only need to kill it.\n\nA: In my case it was the adobe-flashplayer that was getting a conflict (don't know why), so i just removed it and now works fine.\nsudo apt-get purge adobe-flashplugin\n\n\nA: The issue seems to have resolved itself after docking it back to my ThinkPad dock that is connected to the other display I use at work.

I'm using the bash shell and use lots of soft links.  One minor but annoying behavior I observe is the fact that I need to hit tab twice to complete the name of a soft link to a directory. e.g. \n$ mkdir dir1\n$ ln -s dir1 link1\n\nUsing autocompletion, entering, \"cd d\" produces \"cd dir1/\", but entering \"cd l\" produces \"cd link1\", when I'd really like it to produce \"cd link1/\"\n\nA: I think you're looking for the readline variables mark-directories, and mark-symlinked-directories.

So I've been using Ubuntu for like 5 years now but I was really unhelpful when one of my juniors asked me if there was a file manager which for media containing directories can show the media information when the corresponding file is selected, like windows explorer. I never used that kind of sophisticated feature anyway so I thought it might be just a few 'Google' away. But I couldn't find anything. So my question would be if there's any file manager or plugin which can show media metadata into file manager without playing the file.

It may be relatively simple to solve this problem if you have an Ubuntu Live Media (such as a Live CD, DVD or USB, the same you would use in the installation). \nBoot from the Live media and choose to try Ubuntu without installing. Open a Terminal. You will have to know the name of the partition Ubuntu is installed in for the next steps. It will probably be something like 'sda2' or 'sda3'. To help in this step, use the command 'lsblk'. This will give you information about the devices in your PC.\nWhen you know the name of your Ubuntu partition, you have to mount it with the command 'sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt', where the 'sdXY' part is replaced with your partition name.\nThen run the command 'sudo chroot /mnt'. This command will \"chroot\" you into your Ubuntu partition. It's almost like using your system outside of it by CHanging the ROOT to its mountpoint.\nAfter running the above command you will be dropped in another command line. Run the following commands from it:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\nNote that the last letter (a in this case) may vary from system to system, but it will very probably be 'a'. Also note that there is no number in the end of the command, unlike the 'mount' command above.\nThis command will install GRUB in your hard drive. Now you have to update GRUB so it recognizes all your OSs. Just run:\nsudo update-grub\nAnd we're done with the repairing! Reboot your computer and see if you can boot into Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Is there a better way to connect to my NAS drive then smb://[IP address] with Lubuntu? I have lubuntu 14.04 installed, connected to a Virgin Broadband router, with a Seagate Media NAS drive also connected to the same router. Samba is installed.\nFrom Windows 7 (on a different computer), I could simply browse the network and see Seagate-3A4AAA (not the real name) and double-click on it. But from my lubuntu desktop, browsing the network with PCManFM does not reveal any computers or the NAS drive, and typing smb://Seagate-3A4AAA doesn't work. However, what does work is typing the local IP address (discovered from the Windows 7 laptop) into PCManFM location like this smb://192.168.0.4. Presumably, rebooting the router or a power-cut could result in a different IP address being assigned. (Interestingly, we had a power-cut recently and the IP address hasn't changed).\nIs there a better way of finding the drive and connecting to it without having to use a potentially changeable IP address? Is something wrong with my setup? Is it a router issue or a lubuntu issue?\n\nA: Windows uses a different local DHCP-less communication protocol than, well, basically any other OS out there. Most other systems use implementations of the Zeroconf protocol: Bonjour on Apple systems, like Mac OS or iOS, and Avahi on Linux.\nWhen using Zeroconf, hosts can be adressed with\nhostname.local\n\nIf your NAS supports Zeroconf (simply try), you should be able to access it using the address\nsmb://Seagate-3A4AAA.local/\n\nIt may be that Avahi is not yet installed on your system.

According to system monitor, the process running is 'ssh-agent -s' and it is running as my user.\nI know SSH is used to remotely log into a computer. Is it a security risk to leave this running, or is it something I can just leave alone?\n\nA: ssh-agent is a background utility for, optionally, keeping your ssh key, so that you can start ssh without needing to type in the key each time. It's not a security risk and harmless to leave, and harmless to kill as well if you're not using ssh. Though, ordinarily it gets started around starting the X server, so that it can export a useful shell environment to let you use it without fuss, so killing it might kill the X server (which is harmless only from a narrow security point of view).\nIf you do want to use it, and ssh, you would first tell it your key via the ssh-add command.\n", "Q: Popcorn-time.se ubuntu 14.04 lts black screen I am trying to run popcorn-time from the tar.gz I downloaded from popcorn-time.se site and when I extract and trying to run it by ./Popcorn-Time gives me an error of \n\nerror while loading shared libraries: libudev.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nI tried the solution of \n\nsudo ln -sf /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libudev.so.1 /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libudev.so.0\n\nand when I run it, it gives me this splash screen and after this a black screen with no options.

According to Linux 4 release documentation, live-patching of kernel code is now possible in Linux 4. \nDoes Ubuntu 15.10 Wily support these live in-RAM patches without rebooting?

For permissions I am using ACL.\nThe tricky part is the folder structure so everyone can see the common folder (/home/company-docs) and the personal folder (/home/username/mydocs) in their home directory. \nUsing ProFTPD I can chroot jail the users to their home directory and there mydocs/ folder is created (using skel). \nBut how can I give them access to the company folder which is located outside their home folder (path is /home/company-docs)??? \nMy first option is to mount /home/company-docs/ in the user home:\nmount --bind /home/company-docs/ /home/user_name/company-docs\n\nAnd then make this configuration permanent by editing /etc/fstab:\n/var/www/dev  /home/user_name/www_dev    none    bind    0       0\n\nBut the above solution works for just 1 particular user, how can I make this work for every user in the system and make it permanent for every user? and also how to set it up automatically when a new user is created?\nPlease let me know if you have any idea on how to accomplish this or any other better way you may think on doing it. \n\nA: Don't use FTP: not only is it insecure ( passwords are sent in plain text ), but it is also a pain for users to use.  Install samba and use regular windows file sharing.  To give users permission to /home/company-docs, use chmod to allow world read and optionally write access:\nsudo chmod a+rw /home/company-docs\n\n\nA: I can't say I know much about ProFTPD, but would it be possible to let each user have two separate server entries: their private as is and a separate that is shared? I.e., all of them \"logging on\" to the same shared entry, with its own chroot jail?  \n\nA: Keep it simple\nUse samba to share the directories, and use groups and permissions to control access. \nSince this appears to a regulated environment, check what the regulations, internal auditors, and your management have to say about who should have what access. If those sources say nothing then I recommend\n\n\n*\n\n*All users have read access to all shared directories.\n\n*Trusted users be added to a docs group, which has write access to the company docs directory. Maybe everyone is a member of this group, but it allows future control choices. \n\n*The company docs directory should be setup to allow for future changes. I suggest a company directory at the same level as the user directories for easy navigation, then the docs directory below that. This allows future directories inside the company directory. \n", "Q: Is it recommended to remove obsolete packages after a dist upgrade? I have just upgraded from 15.04 to 15.10. I was asked if I wanted to have the obsolete packages removed, but since the option was going to take several hours...I decided to choose \"no\". I have found that it can be done via synaptic too, but is it necessary or useful at all?\n\nA: Removing obsolete (not used) packages will free a good amount of disk space. it's not necessary, but it's healthy to do these removals to free up disk space.\n\nA: I would definitely recommend to first check all the packages that are listed. \nI removed \"obsolete packages\" whilst the update from 16.04 to 18.xx (LTS)\nEven though I use things like my php server, xchat, virtualBox, I unfortunately let it remove everything and .... it was gone.

The drobo is connected to a second interface, eth2 with a direct cable, no routers, switch etc. And I can't seem to reach it at all.\n\nA: I assume the drobo is DHCP querying for getting its IP address, which the server doesn't service as it's on the \"wrong\" interface.\nYou can configure your server's DHCP server to offer addresses on that interface as well, but probably it needs to be a different network for the drobo+server link.

Testdisk brought back the partition with three folders: \"$RECYCLE.BIN\", \"saves\" (this is what I was looking for) and \"System Volume Information\". Shortly, everything that partition had on it.\nThe problem: all folders appear as empty. The \"saves\" folder has 16,4kb which it can't be. Also, the partition's free space is 19,7GB out of 22GB. Obviously, the files are still there, taking space up, but not showing up.\nP.S. I am seeing this using a live-usb. After using testdisk and rewriting the partition table I get \"error: no such partition. Entering rescue mode...\" I don't know about this either. Maybe because it is in front of the ubuntu partition.\n\nA: $RECYCLE.BIN is obviously a Windows Recycle Bin folder...that being empty would not be surprising, unless you typically store files in your trash can.\nSystem Volume Information is also Windows cruft, storage for windows restore points.  So that could contain plenty of hidden data.\nAs you were looking for this saves folder, the question is exactly what the storage requirements are for this folder in an objective fashion (as you do not trust what you are getting).  If you KNOW the files are in the saves folder, and you don't have any problem with erasing these two 'empty' folders, I would delete them and reassess the situation as a first step.\nrm -rf \"$RECYCLE.BIN\"\nrm -rf \"System Volume Information\"\n\n", "Q: Location of the setting file of indicator-multiload Where the setting file of indicator-multiload exists?\nIt is needed to backup and restore the preferences.\n\nA: The setting is stored in dconf.\nTo backup, run the following command:\ndconf dump /de/mh21/indicator-multiload/ > ./backup\n\nAnd to restore it, run the following:\ndconf load /de/mh21/indicator-multiload/ < ./backup\n\n", "Q: Swap a module at boot I am trying to use a version of bbswitch hacked for a T450s mentioned in this issue on bumblebee-project/bbswitch.

I'm still worried that I will lose all of my stuff, but I want Ubuntu. Should I dual boot it? I certainly don't want to, I wish to have my laptop purely Ubuntu. Please help!\n\nA: Dual boot will preserve your files and programs, as you will be installing Ubuntu in parallel with the native OS.  If you want a pure Ubuntu solution and still keep your personal files, copy them to an external hard drive first...or you will lose them.  As for the programs, reinstalling them (or stuff that does the same tasks) after you install Ubuntu.  Some may work via Wine, some may be unusable on a Linux-based machine.\n\nA: Aren's post is accurate.  I just want to add that dual boot \"should\" preserve your files as long as the installer recognizes your current install and file structure.  If you end up needing to manually partition to load Linux, you could very easily write over a portion of your HD that you care about...trust me on this.

I'm looking at some other distros to play around with on my older computers and was wondering if I need to format the drives for certain distros before I do a USB install. I was looking at Lubuntu, Linux Mint, Zorin, Deepin, and a few others. I know with Ubuntu you are able to overwrite existing OS's but I'm not clear on the others.I have a Desktop PC I'm putting it on.\nHP Pavilion a1517x\n200 GB HD\n2 GB RAM\n\n\nA: As far as I know, they all happily reformat the disk as part of the installation if you tell them to. If you are experimenting, you might want to partition the disk into, say, 10Gb partitions and install alternative distros on different partitions.\n\nA: Yes, all of the other Linux distros such as Mint, Zorin, and Deepin will have the same basic UI as other distros like Debian and Ubuntu. Which means that you can overwrite an existing OS.\n", "Q: How to switch to external monitor or clone main one while main one is broken? I have my laptop and the screen is broken on it.

Both my USBs are formatted to FAT32 and boot up fine when I use them on a different computer.\nI do not have any operating system installed on this computer, so windows secure boot is not the problem.\n\nA: If you are using a mobo that uses an EFI boot, sometimes that only works on certain USB ports.  Also, on one of my machines(ASUS MB) the boot selection provides both an EFI and non-EFI boot option.  You might want try one or the other.  Ubuntu Live USB Boot is pretty robust, so as long as you have a good download (more than likely) it should work with no issues.

Is there a way of getting scroll bar arrows back, short of switching to a different window manager? I'm so frustrated that I'm actually starting to miss CDE on Solaris.\n\nA: You need a theme for GTK that doesn't have those overlay scroll bars. Most pre-15.10 themes should work, for example Irradiance.\nYou need to use Unity Tweak Tool, Unsettings or a similar tool to select the theme as the official Unity settings only deal with themes for the current version of Unity.\n", "Q: How do I mount this ipod? fdisk won't even tell me where it is Trying to mount a 4th gen ipod on Ubuntu 15.10.

Some background: my computer's hard drive is completely blown, and as I am waiting to get it replaced I am using ubuntu so I can use to computer. \nI want to put ubuntu onto another 64 GB jump drive which I bought specifically for this purpose. It could be a while before I can get this hard drive replaced, and I will need to have an ubuntu installation next term for my classwork anyway. I wanted to put it onto a bigger drive to allow me to not have to worry as much about space for saving files.\nSo I followed the steps I have done every single time I have ever installed ubuntu to a flash drive; I went to a friend's windows computer, downloaded the ISO, installed UNetBootin, and made the 64gb drive a boot drive. It worked, I booted into Ubuntu, and tried to install it to the USB stick, and this is where things went wrong.\nI want to install ubuntu to the USB drive, but when I went to install it it did not appear. All of the internal partitions of the laptop appeared, and the USB was not present at all. So I wiped the drive, reformatted it to be a FAT drive, thinking this could be the problem, and tried again. Same thing happened- the drive booted fine, but once again no drive appeared.\nSo I went another route. I used the dd command to try to copy my entire system off of this 8 gb drive onto the 64gb drive. This appeared to work- I booted into the drive fine, but it thought it only had 8 GB worth of space. When I looked at the disk in gparted, it showed that the dd command had merely created an 8gb partition, ignoring the other 56 GB on the disk. \nSo I switched back to my original jump drive and tried to expand the size of the newly created partition. This failed.\nNow, I can't unmount that partition, no matter what I try. I have tried literally everything. I can't wipe the partition, nor can I forcefully delete it.\nSo I need a few things.\nFirst, why can I not install to this drive? This is the piece that makes the least sense to me. It SHOULD be working- there is no clear reason for it not to. Is it the jump drive itself? It's a PNY 64gb turbo USB 3.0 flash drive, but the brand shouldn't matter. This shouldn't be a problem at all, it's something I have done a dozen times.\nSecond, how can I forcefully delete all partitions on the new jump drive and rebuild them? There are no files on it. File loss is not a problem. I understand that doing this will permanently get rid of all of the non-existent files on the drive. I need to totally reformat the thing.\nAll help is appreciated.\n\nA: dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=4M count=1\n\nthat should make /dev/sdb a very blank thing indeed. Assuming /dev/sdb is the flash drive. If not, you've just wiped something important.\nGparted should be able to partition it, though I believe it does have some bug in resizing partitions.\n\nA: You have a fairly well-written question compared to most first time posters, and it seems you've attempted to exhaust all the different approaches, at least using the tools you had available, so kudos to you.\nNow, I have used iso-to-usb software such as Universal and UNetbootin, and although I didn't do exactly what you wanted here, I can suggest two ideas for your wish of a \"normal\" Ubuntu install to a large flash drive. They'll still require you to do some work, but I hope at least they can point you in the right direction:\n\n\n*\n\n*UNetbootin persistence feature\n\n*disconnect internal drive\n\n\nUnetbootin persistence feature\nYou didn't mention persistence yet, so I have to point out, this ability to have a distro both run and let you save files, preserve system changes, that's called persistence.\nIn this Unetbootin screenshot:\n\nIf you look near the bottom, notice:\nSpace used to preserve files across reboots (Ubuntu only): 0 MB\n\nThat's how Unetbootin lets you have the option to have persistence.\nSo if you want space used for persistence to be 60 GB, for this field, change 0 to: 60000 before you hit OK\nHowever for some reason Unetbootin does not always work. So if this fails for you, try the next suggestion\ndisconnect internal drive\nA second thing you could try is\n\n\n*\n\n*safely power off, and open up your computer\n\n*carefully disconnect all internal hard drives\n\n*connect your 8 GB Ubuntu Live USB, and your 64 GB flash drive\n\n*power on to boot into the 8 GB Ubuntu Live USB\n\n*Try the install Ubuntu now, see if the 64 GB USB is now present and available for install\n\n\nMultiple sources seem to mention this \"disconnect internal drive\" approach in order to see it during install. For example:\na 2011 post:\n\nand then what you do is take out the HD from your pc, plug in the external one into the usb ports, and then you (should be able to) install to that external drive from the ubuntu install menu.\n\na 2012 forum thread:\n\nit will be simpler if you disconnect the internal drive during the installation. \n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Intel Computer Stick Black screen after restore clonezilla image I'm having some problems with a project I'm working with Intel Computer Stick.\nWhen I clone the finished project and restore the image to another computer stick with the same spec I can't log to the gnome desktop, all i get is a black screen for like 3 seconds then it take me back to the OS login screen.\nI have installed Openbox for this project i can access the terminal.

After some research and mild panic I decided to just reinstall over the previous installation, because that allegedly saves all data etc.  Pop in install disk, it found the previous installation, but I backed out of the install before letting it get started because I had to run an errand.

My laptop seems to have no problem recognizing USB drives and even booting off of them, but unfortunately it doesn't recognize the SD card in the BIOS. I've tried to work my way around it and mounted the ISO on a USB drive, then install the OS on the SD card (which worked) but unfortunately if the BIOS doesn't recognize the SD card off the start, then it cannot boot the newly installed environment. I've then looked at the manufacturer website to see if I can flash my BIOS, but it seems that it's already installed the latest version.\nI've also noticed that somehow my computer has recognized some form of linux installation off my SSD, so while booting into it it takes me to a GNU GRUB command line. While trying to restore the Linux installation through command line, it does not recognize the SD card as one of the Hard drive sources. \nI can see/access and do what I'd like to my SD card in any GUI environment.. But without loading into an environment, seems like I can't access my SD card. \nDoes anyone have a solution for me other than using a USB drive or buying an external SD card reader? \n\nA: Other than using a USB reader I dont think there is much of a solution to be honest. I know for my own laptop it WILL NOT read the card on boot unless I put it into an external reader. After the bios hands off to the OS its completely different. The OS has drivers for the media drive and accepts it as its own source. The bios however, only accepts USB and the other standard set of things.\n\nA: How about putting the directory /boot on the SSD (or whatever internal storage device you have)? You would need to make space for it. I would guess that about 100MB would do. I haven't tried it yet but intend to try with a new Windows laptop.

Why is this, and what could I do?\n\nA: TL;DR checkinstall is your friend ;)\nsudo apt-get install checkinstall\n\n\nAfter a installation with sudo make install your package manager knows absolutely nothing about this installation. But it knows all about a package with the same name in the Ubuntu repositories or in a PPA. \nUse sudo checkinstall instead of sudo make install and use a higher version as the version in the repository to be sure, that your package manager accepts this version as correct dependency for ProgB.\n\nFurther information:\ncheckinstall is really nifty, since it follows what the make install command would do, in order to figure out how to build a package. \nThis means that if you install a program using make install, but then want to repent for your sins, all you have to do is sudo checkinstall -D make install, and that command will:\n\n\n*\n\n*follow make install to figure out what it does\n\n*copy-cat make install, except in *.deb package form\n\n*install from the package (exactly as make install would have, given point 1)) except also let apt-get know about it, and thus overwrite all the files exactly where make install would have put them as long as you choose YES to include the files put by make install in the home directory in the package as well -- a couple of options during the checkinstall process will let you choose (obviously though, the choice is there so you can exercise it on a case-to-case basis)\nBonus: you can also remove a package (call it progA again) installed using make install that odes not have make uninstall support by following the checkinstall process outlined so far, and then simply doing:\ndpkg -r progA\n\n\nA: Three options: \n\n\n*\n\n*create a fake package for progA: How to fake a package version installed?

What command shall I run?\n\nA: You mentioned putty so I'm assuming you are sshing to your rpi from windows.\nTo transfer file, you can use scp which for windows is available as winscp. \nLook into this part for a command line, you should be able to automate it using whatever system you like in your windows.\nAn example would be:\nwinscp.exe /defaults /keepuptodate // \"C:\\Users\\martin\\Documents\\csv\" /home/pi/csv\n", "Q: Cleanup rabbitmq queue how can I cleanup (delete messages) in a rabbitmq queue?\nI'm using Ubuntu 14.04 and rabbitmq-server 3.2.4-1\nExample:\n# rabbitmqctl list_queues -p openstack\nListing queues ...\n...\nnotifications.info      372\n...\n\n\nA: For example:\nsudo apt-get install amqp-tools\namqp-delete-queue -q name_from_queue\n\nIn this link you have more options:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/5313027/rabbitmq-how-do-i-delete-all-messages-from-a-single-queue\n\nA: \nis there a way to cleanup the queue without deleting the queue? \n\nYes; this is called purging the queue and there are plenty of ways to do it.\nThis is because in addition to being something that one can do with tools like rabbitmqadmin pointed at the broker it's an operation accessible directly from the protocol.  So people can write, and have written, tools that take queue names and enact the queue.purge method against them, in languages as varied as C++ and Python.\nThe Ubuntu amqp-utils package is a little light on such tools, but one doesn't have to look far to find things like Doug Barth's amqp-utils toolset written in Ruby and containing an amqp-purge utility.\nThe rabbitmqadmin syntax is: rabbitmqadmin purge queue queue-name\nFurther reading\n\n\n*\n\n*queue.purge.

No warnings, just a sudden black screen fallowed by reboot. You can see the replica effect by this very short video.\nhttps://youtu.be/t9i7u-bcMfU\nLaptop: ASUS G551JM\nOS: A brand new hard disk, the Windows 8.1 enterprise (NOT OEM version) is installed first, then ubuntu14.04. Both fast boot and secure boot are disabled.\nBoot: using mother board boot menu can get me to both grub menu and windows without any issue. The Windows Boot Manager option in gurb menu also worked.\nI've narrowed the problem down to the grub update process and the video shows that whenever the grub gives the message of \"Found Windows Boot Manager on /dev/sda2@/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\", the computer just crashed. I've tried to use the boot-repair thinking it might help, but the \"sudo apt-get\" installation itself will give the message for me to \"sudo dpkg --configure -a\", which run the grub settings and crash the computer again. \nAs for now, I couldn't install anything via apt-get and pretty much stuck here. (I was trying to install gstreamer-tools when the updater crashed)\nI would really like not to reinstall my ubuntu since I have a lot of things on ROS on this machine.\nThanks for any opinion.\n\nA: A hard crash like that usually indicates a hardware failure, or at least something closely related to it like a driver bug or firmware issue. Thus, I recommend you first run a SMART test on the hard disk. This should squawk if it finds problems with the hard disk itself, which might be causing problems if the disk is failing.\nMy suspicion, though, is that it's the firmware, and in particular access to the NVRAM via the efibootmgr utility, that's causing the failure. To test this, try running sudo efibootmgr -v. If that succeeds, try making some small change to the boot setup. For instance, you're likely to see several options in the BootOrder line. Keep the first one the same and swap the order of two of the last items by using -o. For instance, suppose sudo efibootmgr -v shows:\nBootOrder: 0000,0001,0002,0003\n\nYou could swap those last two items (which should have no real effect) by typing:\nsudo efibootmgr -o 0,1,3,2\n\nIf this action crashes your computer, then you've identified the culprit. If I'm right, though, this may not be very helpful, since I've never heard of this specific problem before, so I can't say with certainty what the solution is. My guess is that you'll have to either update your firmware or go into the firmware setup utility and reset it to its defaults (clearing the NVRAM entries). Either action could require recovery of your boot process by using efibootmgr from an emergency boot system, by running Boot Repair, or by taking other actions.\n", "Q: Run 'sudo service mongod start' at boot time Ubuntu 15.10\nI am TOTALLY confused by all the posts about the new service loaders, and rather concerned that Mongo don't seem to think that it is their issue to solve. Here is one of several posts that suggest it is nearly impossible, except with manual interventions. (A solution from 2011 is not a solution given the current mix of technology used by Ubuntu and Mongo.)\nAnd yet, what I know is that mongod no longer starts at boot time, but that if I open a console and run sudo service mongod start, then it works.\nWhat is the simplest way to automate this during the initial bootup?\n\nA: The simplest way is to use update-rc.d.

I recently installed Ubuntu on my laptop and so far everything is fine, it works great. However, as a newbie, I made the silly mistake of not documenting myself too much about all the possible alternatives to Windows, such as Lubuntu, Linux mint, Fedora etc.. I would like to test some of these on my machine, however I prefer not to wipe out all the disk, and therefore I would like to test the system either on a virtual box (Boxes on Ubuntu should work fine) or on an external hard drive.\n(I own a 2.0 USB external hard drive)\nI would like to test, say Fedora, and have it handy for a couple of weeks. My aim is to test the OS in an environment which makes it the closest possible to the actual installation on the internal hard disk (ie. experience the less slowdowns possible). Which one of the two options should I go for? \n\nA: I must disagree with all the other answers. To test a new OS the best way is a external HD, there are a couple of reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Most important, this is the only way to test your real hardware. VM installs are not running on your computer and you can fall in love with Fedora but when you install it in your real hardware making your wifi card (or something else) work could be difficult.\n\n*Your read/write throughput to the external disk will be worse, but everything else (graphics, sound, processor) will run at real speed. If you try Ubuntu (with unity) on a VM the GUI will be slower (due to worse 3D access) than an external HD.\n\n*Easy wipe, just delete the external HD.\n\n*Easier data sharing that a VM. You can just mount your internal HD, no need to shared folders or things like that. You can even symlink your real program configuration or document folders for a seamless experience.\n\n\nThe only real advantage of VMs, to me, in this situation, are snapshots.\n\nA: least slowdowns would be actually installing to its own hardrive and running it off of that drive. obviously this would be because your computer is dedicating its resources to the OS itself.\nthe next best option would be VMWare Player. you can download it free on their site. if your computer can handle the resource allocation (and you arent gaming or anything) then a virtual environment can allow you to test many different setups easily.\nthe VMware download is here if you want it:\nhttps://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_player/12_0\n\nA: You'd better choose VirtualBox. There are several advantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*You could create a lab of many VMs running simultaneously (depends on your computer performance)\n\n*You could create snapshots when your VMs are well configured/run. Yet\nif make any mistake, you will be able to revert back. \n\n*You could benefit from VBoxManage command\n(create/modify/run/suspend/stop VMs and create/restore/delete\nsnapshots) if you are advanced user. And so you could write scripts\nto automatically process your VMs.\n\n\nA: For testing the look and feel of another distribution I would definitely go for a virtual installation in the first place for the following reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*No need to change the boot loader or the partition layout of your host, i.e. no risk of accidentally breaking your main OS.\n\n*Easy reverting any changes while playing around from creating snapshots.\n\n*Much better hard drive read/write speed as compared to an external USB2.0 drive.\n\n*Only a minimum of hard drive space required by using dynamically growing virtual disks.\n\n*Easy exchange of data from host and guest with network shares or shared folders.\n\n*Parallel access to applications on the host while running a test OS (think e.g. of a browser to search for help when stuck).\n\n\nOf course you will have to be aware of some delay and a bit more sluggish experience of a virtual guest OS but on a fairly well equipped host (Quad Core, >4GB RAM) this should not matter much.\nApplications that rely on a fast GPU may not perform as good as they do on bare metal. The virtual graphics driver from the guest additions will do it's best to overcome this but for gaming you may not want to use a virtual machine.\n", "Q: How to set default DISPLAY for all SSH sessions? I'm SSH-ing to my PC from my phone, and I have to run export DISPLAY=:0.0 every time.

It is installed properly and I can successfully command my devices using ibtest utility. But before that, everytime I disconnect and reconnect the device I need to run gpib_config --minor 0 inorder to initiate the drivers.\nI wanted it to run automatically everytime a connection is made without having to run explicitly. So, a udev rule is what I thought of and wrote the following:\nKERNEL==\"gpib[0-9]*\", ENV{DEVPATH}==\"/devices/virtual/gpib_common/gpib0\", RUN+=\"/usr/sbin/gpib_config --minor 0\"\n\nbased on what I got from:\nudevadm info /dev/gpib0\nP: /devices/virtual/gpib_common/gpib0\nN: gpib0\nE: DEVNAME=/dev/gpib0\nE: DEVPATH=/devices/virtual/gpib_common/gpib0\nE: MAJOR=160\nE: MINOR=0\nE: SUBSYSTEM=gpib_common\n\nBut this didn't help me when I restarted the udev rules. \nWhat I have observed, if I reboot the pc itself then on first connection I am able to run ibtest without explicit execution of gpib_config.\nPlease help me where I am lacking?\n\nA: I believe you got /dev/gpib0 on the first time after reboot, the next reconnection is on /dev/gpib1 and each time you reconnect it get incremented like in USB storage.\nOn your first connection, you got:\nE: DEVNAME=/dev/gpib0\nE: DEVPATH=/devices/virtual/gpib_common/gpib0\n\nOn second one, I expect:\nE: DEVNAME=/dev/gpib1\nE: DEVPATH=/devices/virtual/gpib_common/gpib1\n\nSo that rule never run on any reconnection, As ENV{DEVPATH} in the rule fixed at 0. Another point, in your case DEVNAME & DEVPATH are very related (if I can't say: they are the same), so ENV{DEVPATH} does not add any thing to the rule. Try: ls -l /dev/gpib*, you should find a symlink:\n/dev/gpibX -> /sys/devices/virtual/gpib_common/gpibX\n\nSo keep you rules simple:\nKERNEL==\"gpib[0-9]*\", RUN+=\"/usr/sbin/gpib_config --minor 0\"\n\nBTW, this rule is run multiple times, at least it is run twice (2): On device connection & on device disconnection.

That should give us a clue as to why it needs to be readable by everyone. Any utility that inspects file metadata needs to be able to read /etc/passwd (and so /etc/group) in order to be able to resolve the numerical IDs used by the kernel and its subsystems to the human-friendly names that we rely on. Tools that need to find your home directory look that information up in /etc/passwd, and inet miniservers like fingers look up your details in /etc/passwd.\nAs has been pointed out elsewhere, there is no particularly sensitive data in the file, as modern systems put the password hashes in /etc/shadow file, which is readonly by root.\n", "Q: Kubuntu 14.04 suddenly boots to black screen I ve had a dualboot of Kubuntu 14.04 and W8.1 for quite a while now (no fresh install).

Live USB sticks are great to troubleshoot problem Linux systems and Ubuntu live-USB is excellent.  \nBut it would be nice if you could use the free space on the disk to carry extra data (like a backup of a MBR or something else)\nBut the layout of the stick gives issues for gparted as well as for gnome-disks.\nThe layout gparted shows is absurd: \n\n\n*\n\n*4 kb /dev/sdc1\n\n*948.78 MB unused\n\n*2.28 MB FAT16\n-57.65 GB unused\n\n\nSo I don't eve dare to make changes here.\nThe layout of gnome-disks looks better (stick is 16Gb):\n\n\n*\n\n*1.0 Gb ISO9660\n\n*2.4 Mb FAT\n\n*15 Gb free space\n\n\nAccessing the disk with gparted or trying to make a new partition with gnome-disks gives this error:\n\"The driver descriptor says the physical block size is 2048 bytes, but Linux says it is 512 bytes.\"\n\nBut the stick is fine, I used it several times for installing and livebooting.\nAs a matter of fact, I have tested this with other sticks of different brands and sizes, I have always the same issue.\nnote: I Use this ultrafast command to make a USB-disk bootable from an ISO file, this works much faster than any of the graphical tools:\n(provided that the stick is /dev/sdc, check with dmesg)  \ndd if=ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sdc bs=512\n\n\nA: Yes, you can add extra partitions to Ubuntu bootable USB drive, (But Windows can only see the first partition on a flash drive). You can use the FAT partition that Ubuntu is installed on, to copy data to or from, using both Windows or Linux.\nIf you are running Ubuntu from the drive, you must go to filesystem/cdrom to access the data.\nFollowing is how I make persistent Ubuntu drives with multiple partitions, (in this case to increase persistence beyond 4GB).\nBoot Live CD or Live USB.\nPlug in flash drive.\nStart gparted.\nCreate 2 GB FAT32 partition, (on the left side of the bar). (size is optional, extra space can be used for file storage and transfer to Windows machines).\nCreate a 4 GB ext2 partition to the right of this, labeled it \"casper-rw\". (ext3 and ext4 also work).\nCreate a partition in the remaining space and label it \"home-rw\".

That process went pretty smoothly and now I have nginx at /usr/local/openresty/nginx/sbin/.  The version reported when I execute ./nginx -v is 1.9.3.2 - correct. I can get the server up and running by executing ./nginx.  \nHowever, what I would like to be able to do is to have it run as a service at startup the way it usually works when you do a vanilla Nginx install via apt-get install nginx.  I would also like to be able to use commands such as service nginx status|restart|stop|reload etc.  I am an utter and complete newbie when it comes to this sort of thing.  I have tried to understand the contents of the /etc/init.d/nginx script on one of my other servers but modifying it to work with the present installation is not something I understand.  I am hoping that someone here will be able to help.\n\nA: And now, the Ubuntu answer.\nYou are using Ubuntu Linux. You already have either upstart or systemd (the former in this particular case). Do not begin by writing System 5 rc scripts.\nSo write an upstart job file.  Take one of the ones already written for nginx, in fact, and modify it for OpenResty.\nThe Ubuntu version 15.10 nginx-common package comes with an upstart job file supplied, straight out of the box, as /etc/init/nginx.conf; although the Ubuntu version 14.04 nginx-common package is several versions behind and does not.  It's fairly easy to pull the file directly out of the Debian source repository (nginx.upstart).  There's also an /etc/init/nginx.conf job file on the nginx wiki.\nApplying your OpenResty modifications yields this:\n\n# /etc/init/openresty.conf\n\ndescription \"OpenResty nginx\"\n\nstart on filesystem and static-network-up\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nenv DAEMON='/usr/local/openresty/nginx/sbin/nginx -c /usr/local/openresty/nginx/conf/nginx.conf'\n\nexpect fork\nrespawn\n\npre-start script\n    [ -x $DAEMON ] || { stop; exit 0; }\n    $DAEMON -t || { stop; exit 0; }\nend script\n\nexec $DAEMON \n\npre-stop exec $DAEMON -s quit\n\nUse as an upstart job, in the usual manner, with initctl start, initctl stop, and so forth.\nOf course, people have already done these modifications, long since.\nFurther reading\n\n\n*\n\n*Oliver Frommel (2014). /etc/init/openresty.conf.

Do I just download the deb file and install it on top of the existing version (this is, will the new version recognize the old one and only update it), or do I uninstall the current one, and install from scratch? I think my question relates to the actual nature of the \"apt-get update\" command, which I think I want to mimic.\n\nA: The question here goes back to whether Texstudio provides a .deb and whether it is identical to the one in the PPA.\nIf the package names match up exactly, then you might be able to download the .deb from Texstudio and install on top of the existing (essentially, 'updating' the package manually) by using dpkg -i /path/to/package.deb (replacing the path accordingly).

However the machine is behind the proxy and cannot connect to Internet. And that was never intented. Especially on installation level.\nHow can I prevent it ?\n\nA: It sounds like you already are preventing it, if it's unable to connect. If you want the connection to fail faster, then fix your router/proxy/whatever to drop the connection immediately, rather than waiting for the lengthy TCP timeout to occur. If you wish to have your firewall disallow external access, it should be dropping/closing any connection requests to non-internal addresses.\nThat IP is one of the round-robin addresses for the archive.ubuntu.com main archive server.

While I choose mpv as the back-end of smplayer, the hardware acceleration of video (vdpau) can't be used in the video and falls down to the software decoding. \nMeanwhile, if I choose mplayer as the back-end of smplayer, the same video can be decoded via vdpau. \nMoreover, if I use cli to play the same video via mpv, the video can also be decoded via vdpau.\nSo, how to make mpv work well with hardware acceleration when it is used as a back-end of Smplayer?\n\nA: From official SMplayer article:\nIf you have trouble to play HD videos you can improve performance by following these advices:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have a multicore processor: select Preferences in the Options menu. That will open the preferences dialog. Go to the Performance section. Now increase the \"threads for decoding\" according to the number of cores of your processor (If you have 2 cores, select 2 threads. If you have 4 cores, you can select up to 4 threads, and so on).\n\n*If you don't have a multicore processor: select Preferences in the Options menu. That will open the preferences dialog. Go to the Performance section. Check the option \"Allow frame drop\". This will help to keep A/V sync, although with some video formats it can cause video corruption. You can also experiment with the H.264 \"loop filter\" option.\n\n\nIn addition, when playing HD videos for the best performance it is recommended to have at least up to 2GB of RAM installed on your system PC and video card with more than 384MB of memory available.\n\nA: Set in smplayer preferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*General -> Output driver : vdpau\n\n*Performance -> Hardware decoding: vdpau\nIf mpv doesn't use hardware decoding by default add this to ~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf \nvo=vdpau\nhwdec=vdpau\n\nvdpau hardware decoding works fine in mpv and smplayer  on a Radeon 4xxx (r600/r700) with these settings\n", "Q: Refused connection to SSH I've tried to access the Ubuntu platform using SSH, SCP, and SFTP and got refused with a message.

The only dramatic performance differences found with this new driver was in the Metro Redux games where the performance changes were regressions.\n\nSo, yeah, sadly AMD still has a long way to go with their Linux drivers. :(\n", "Q: no permissions fastboot - fastboot and adb not working I'm trying to unlock my Moto phone using ADB but I when I do a fastboot devices I keep getting \nno permissions   fastboot\n\nEven sudo fastboot devices is not helping\nwith sudo I get this sudo: fastboot: command not found\nHELP!!\n\nA: Try using sudo $(which fastboot)\nfor instance sudo $(which fastboot) devices\nalso sudo $(which fastboot) oem unlock\n\nA: My Solution\nThanks to elichai2 and this link and list I was able to solve my fastboot permission issue. \nI have the Google Nexus 6P so I used the following for my Vendor ID:\n\nGoogle - 18d1\n\n\n51-android.rules\nIf you use the following command:\nsudo sh -c \"echo 'SUBSYSTEM==\\\"usb\\\", ATTR{idVendor}==\\\"8087\\\" ...\"\n\ncopy it exactly.

I doubt this is the case for me - there simply aren't enough USB devices (just a keyboard and a mouse using the powered hub built into my monitor). We do have at least one thing in common - we both have Dell Keyboards. Are you also using a hub?\nThe last information I can add to this question is that this behavior seems to depend on your motherboard's USB BIOS settings. I have an Asrock Z87 Extreme6/ac and modifying the Intel USB3 behavior causes my system to break in various ways (from no USB devices working, to just USB3 devices, to this behavior). What motherboard do you have? Does the behavior change when modifying the settings? Be careful, I've had to clear my CMOS a couple times already because the keyboard would not longer function during BIOS startup! \n\nA: Since I cannot add my findings as a comment, I'll add it as an answer.\nMy setup: ASRock Z97 Extreme6 and Ubuntu 15.10\nWhat I found out so far:\nIt seems related to Z97 & similar chipsets: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1437492\nSolutions mentioned there are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power off, pull the plug & wait a bit, then power on again -> works for one boot sequence\n\n*Disable Asmedia controller / Asmedia USB controller or similar. These seem to be located in different spots depending on the board. I found 2 potential matches. Advanced -> USB Configuration -> Third Party USB 3.0 Controller and Advanced -> Storage Configuration -> 'ASMedia SATA3 Mode'\nSo what I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*I began from a clean Config (Fresh after CMOS reset)\n\n*The ASMedia setting in \"Storage Configuration\" I have tried in the past -> this disables some of the SATA ports, so I tried a different route first.\n\n*Go to Advanced -> USB Configuration -> Set 'Third Party Controller' to Disabled Result: Boot sequence is still slow, but Ubuntu is back to normal speed. Well, my mouse did not work anymore (I had to switch to a different tty to reboot my computer...). Back to UEFI setup.\n\n*Go to Advanced -> USB Configuration -> Set 'Intel USB3.0 Mode' from 'Smart Auto' to 'Enabled' Result: Scratch that, did not help. Only the front panel USBs work...\n\n*Next I tried shutting down, cut the power for a few minutes, then boot again. Result: That did the trick. System boot time was just a few seconds total. And the USB ports on the back of my computer work again, too.\n\n*Next: verify by rebooting again. Result: Yep, still working.\n\n*Another update: Well, most of the ports work.. Some still don't work. But since I use a hub I can live with that for now. If you try it, maybe the power off & cut power is enough? Might be worth a try..\n\n\nI'm not sure if all changes above are required - but it is working for me now, so I won't touch these again ;)\nI hope this helps you & potentially other people stumbling across the same issue. I also recommend reading the launchpad bug linked above -> That bug report is worth it's weight in gold!\n\nBelow are some failed attempts messing with the Legacy Mode settings, that did not solve my problem. Summary: Legacy modes, Compatibility patches, etc. don't really improve the situation, they mostly just randomly disable your devices.. They might help others, so I leave them here for reference.\nPlaying around with some settings I have found out the following:\nNote that I tried to set the USB 2.0 Legacy support to \"UEFI Setup Only\" so I could get into the setup by plugging the keyboard into the 2.0 ports on my front panel, just to be sure. That did NOT work. These ports are pretty much usesless & my keyboards only work when plugged into a port with legacy support enabled, OR into the hub on my monitor. Any, of yourse, only once Ubuntu started up. Neither UEFI nor Grub would recognize the keyboard. Another keyboard I could get to work on one of the 2.0 ports, so I could get around a CMOS reset.\nWith \"USB Compatibility Patch\" enabled:\nWhen plugged directly into the USB 3.0 Ports on the Motherboard, they only work when I enabled USB 3.0 Legcy support in the UEFI setup. When I do that, boot sequence is ~20 seconds longer than the usual 1-3 seconds. Ubuntu then also takes longer to start up, with the device descriptor read/all, error -110 errors, as displayed above. The keyboard works, but the USB camera I have (Logitech QuickCam Communicate STX, pretty old..) is not recognized by the system.\nWhen the legacy mode is disabled but the two devices are plugged into the hub on my monitor (powered hub, I guess), boot sequence is blazingly fast if no device is plugged into the 2.0 ports BUT Ubuntu still takes longer & displays these messages. Both keyboard and camera work.\nLegacy Mode enabled, pretty much yields the same result.\nWith \"USB Compatibility Patch\" disabled:\nSame behaviour as above, but the other keyboard on the 2.0 Port did not work either... --> CMOS reset.\nI'll experiment some more and update this answer as I gather results.\n\nA: Here is a solution that worked for me.\nFirst, some data which may be relevant to your case.\nI have two machines with AsRock's Z97 boards.\n\n\n*\n\n*One is Z97 Fatality. I have checked and determined I don't suffer\nfrom this usb error causing boot-stall on that. If you have this\nboard and are suffering from this issue, let me know and I will post\nmy BIOS usb settings.\n\n*Another is Z97 OC Formula (not Z97 Extreme). I had the problem on this one.\n\n\nHere is how I solved the problem with the Z97 OC Formula:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrade BIOS to latest version (P1.80 for me now)\n\n*(May be unrelated, but this happened between 1 & 3) Upgrade ubuntu to 16.04 or newer.\n\n*Reset CMOS (on board, using jumper, not \"load defaults\" through BIOS, that didn't help).\n\n\nMy USB settings in UEFI BIOS are as follows (unchanged since CMOS reset):\n\n\n*\n\n*USB Controller -> Enabled\n\n*Intel USB 3.0 Mode -> Smart Auto\n\n*Legacy USB Support -> Enabled\n\n*Legacy USB 3.0 Support -> Enabled\n\n*USB Compatibility Patch -> Disabled\n\n\nI hope this helps someone with a similar issue.\n\nA: I was also facing same error when I attached USB into one of port on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

It has only Windows 10 installed as of now and there is only 1 partition.\nI was told by the shopkeeper that Windows 10 allows only 3 partitions maximum, exceeding which, the hard drive will be corrupted. Is it true? I was on a Windows 7 machine before this and it had a C: for Windows 7, a D:, an Ubuntu MATE 15.10 partition and a swap partition - making it 4 partitions. If the 3 partitions rule is true, does that mean that in order to dual boot, I would have to sacrifice the D:? Please help.\nAlso, since I was on a Windows 7 machine before this, I did not have to deal with this UEFI nonsense to worry about. With Windows 10, turns out I need to. Now, there is a sea of tutorials for dual booting Linux with Windows 10, but I'm not sure which one to follow. Could anyone here please help find a single reliable source that I can follow end to end and get my Ubuntu up and running?\nThank you.\n\nA: Windows 10 does support more than three partitions (it did on my Lenovo G70-80); Y-50 could have issues though. That's what can be done:\nHave a partition for Ubuntu. This partition uses usually ext3 or ext4 file system (not Windows' NTFS). Ubuntu installation will take care of formatting and what not.\nIf you do not have an empty partition, shrink a volume (partition) with sufficient free space using Windows Disk Management. Press Win+X and then press K to launch Disk Management. The space created by shrinking a partition will be marked as unallocated (black-colored).\nDuring Ubuntu installation select that unallocated partition (you should know which partition by looking at the partition size) and , when asked, select  install Ubuntu alongside other Operating Systems to be able to dual boot. Let us know if it works and if you need more concrete, detailed info.\n\nA: Your shop keeper was, shall we say, ill-informed. Pre-installed Windows systems typically come with at least three partitions already, and often with four or five. Most of these are usually hidden, in the sense that they don't get drive letters, but they do exist.\nFor EFI reading, I recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adam Williamson's blog entry on how EFI works -- This page describes the theory behind EFI-mode booting.\n\n*My page on installing Linux on EFI systems -- This page is a more practical introduction to EFI-mode booting than the preceding one.\n\n*The Ubuntu community wiki entry on UEFI -- This page is a bit disjointed, but is the most Ubuntu-specific introduction to EFI and its issues.\n\n\nIf you want to read just one page, I'd recommend the second of those, although the third has the advantage (for you) of being more Ubuntu-centric. The first is worth reading for background information; it will help you understand things better and therefore enable you to navigate unexpected problems.\n", "Q: What does Ubuntu use for creating cloud-images?

It is similar to Windows Service Packs.\nYou do not say that Windows 7 SP2 is a release. Even when you can get an installation media with a SP included.\n\"Point releases\" just accumulate security updates and bug fixes.

From experience I know that primary selection is basically what you high-light and released with the middle mouse click (which corresponds to pressing both right and left touchpad key on a laptop). The clipboard is the traditional CtrlV.\nBy examining the man pages for both, however, I've discovered that xclip wins in one aspect - reading from an input file:\n$ cat testfile.txt                                                             \nHELLOWORLD\n\n$ xclip -selection clipboard testfile.txt\n\n$ HELLOWORLD\nmksh: HELLOWORLD: not found\n\n$ xsel testfile.txt \nUsage: xsel [options]\nManipulate the X sele . . . (usage page goes on)\n\nOf course you could use shell redirection with xsel to get around that\n$ xsel --clipboard < testfile.txt                                              \n\n$ HELLOWORLD\nmksh: HELLOWORLD: not found\n\nxclip also wins in the fact that you can output the contents of clipboard to file (which is perhaps useful when you want to redirect PRIMARY selection , i.e. highlights).  xsel offers only output to stdout\n\nA: In addition to @Serg answer, there is a piece of information from the Tmux page in the Arch Wiki that can be useful in some specific cases:\n\nUnlike xsel [xclip] works better when printing a raw bitstream that does not fit the current locale. Nevertheless, it is neater to use xsel because xclip does not close STDOUT after it has read from the tmux buffer. As such, tmux does not know that the copy task has completed, and continues to wait for xclip to terminate, thereby rendering tmux unresponsive. A workaround is to redirect STDOUT to /dev/null:\n\n\nA: Something else to keep in mind, xsel has fewer dependencies than xclip:\n# apt-cache depends xsel\nxsel\n  Depends: libc6\n  Depends: libx11-6\n  Conflicts: xsel:i386\n\n# apt-cache depends xclip\nxclip\n  Depends: libc6\n  Depends: libx11-6\n  Depends: libxmu6\n  Conflicts: xclip:i386\n\n\nA: There is one other reason to use xclip over xsel – xclip can manipulate cut buffer 0, by passing -selection buffer-cut, which xsel cannot do.\nIt's relatively easy to allow it to manipulate the other cut buffers as well; here is my patch, though it's not well-tested and comes with no guarantees.\ndiff --git a/xclip.c b/xclip.c\nindex 5fc760cb7..eeb05f662 100644\n--- a/xclip.c\n+++ b/xclip.c\n@@ -35,11 +35,12 @@\n #include \"xclib.h\"\n\n /* command line option table for XrmParseCommand() */\n-XrmOptionDescRec opt_tab[14];\n+XrmOptionDescRec opt_tab[15];\n\n /* Options that get set on the command line */\n int sloop = 0;         /* number of loops */\n char *sdisp = NULL;        /* X display to connect to */\n+int bufnum = 0;        /* Cut buffer number to use */\n Atom sseln = XA_PRIMARY;   /* X selection to work with */\n Atom target = XA_STRING;\n\n@@ -165,6 +166,9 @@ doOptSel(void)\n        break;\n    case 'b':\n        sseln = XA_STRING;\n+       if (XrmGetResource(opt_db, \"xclip.buffer\", \"Xclip.Buffer\", &rec_typ, &rec_val)) {\n+           bufnum = atoi(&rec_val.addr[0]);\n+       }\n        break;\n    }\n\n@@ -177,8 +181,10 @@ doOptSel(void)\n        fprintf(stderr, \"XA_SECONDARY\");\n        if (sseln == XA_CLIPBOARD(dpy))\n        fprintf(stderr, \"XA_CLIPBOARD\");\n-       if (sseln == XA_STRING)\n+       if (sseln == XA_STRING) {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"XA_STRING\");\n+       fprintf(stderr, \"\\nUsing buffer number %d\", bufnum);\n+       }\n\n        fprintf(stderr, \"\\n\");\n    }\n@@ -276,7 +282,7 @@ doIn(Window win, const char *progname)\n\n     /* Handle cut buffer if needed */\n     if (sseln == XA_STRING) {\n-   XStoreBuffer(dpy, (char *) sel_buf, (int) sel_len, 0);\n+   XStoreBuffer(dpy, (char *) sel_buf, (int) sel_len, bufnum);\n    return EXIT_SUCCESS;\n     }\n\n@@ -445,7 +451,7 @@ doOut(Window win)\n     unsigned int context = XCLIB_XCOUT_NONE;\n\n     if (sseln == XA_STRING)\n-   sel_buf = (unsigned char *) XFetchBuffer(dpy, (int *) &sel_len, 0);\n+   sel_buf = (unsigned char *) XFetchBuffer(dpy, (int *) &sel_len, bufnum);\n     else {\n    while (1) {\n        /* only get an event if xcout() is doing something */\n@@ -595,6 +601,11 @@ main(int argc, char *argv[])\n     opt_tab[13].argKind = XrmoptionNoArg;\n     opt_tab[13].value = (XPointer) xcstrdup(ST);\n\n+    opt_tab[14].option = xcstrdup(\"-buffer\");\n+    opt_tab[14].specifier = xcstrdup(\".buffer\");\n+    opt_tab[14].argKind = XrmoptionSepArg;\n+    opt_tab[14].value = (XPointer) NULL;\n+\n     /* parse command line options */\n     doOptMain(argc, argv);\n\n\n\nA: Use xclip, because xsel can not extract binary data from clipboard, such as screenshots.

In any event, if it's something GRUB-related, you should update your question with details. If it's more Windows-related, you should post on a Windows forum.\n\n*Before you do anything potentially damaging, back up your ESP (/boot/efi under Ubuntu). Some potential repairs could make things worse -- maybe much worse. A file-level backup (using cp, tar, zip, or similar tools) should be fine.\n\n*There's evidence of both BIOS-mode and EFI-mode boot loaders on your system. Such configurations are potential land mines. Please read my page on the subject. In brief, I recommend disabling the Compatibility Support Module (CSM; also referred to as \"legacy support\" or similar terms) in your firmware. This will simplify your boot path and avoid potential mixed-mode problems.\n\n*You MUST disable the Windows feature called \"Fast Startup\" (or various other things). This topic is covered here (among other places). Failure to disable this feature can cause data corruption on shared data partitions, including the EFI System Partition (ESP), which is where your boot loaders reside. Note that the Windows Fast Startup feature is unrelated to firmware features with similar names, like \"fast boot.\" The latter can make it hard to boot an Ubuntu installer but are otherwise harmless to Ubuntu or to dual-boot configurations, provided you can get everything working initially. Of course, disabling this feature may be impossible if you can't boot to Windows; but if you can get in even temporarily, this should be the first thing you do.\n\n*Some of your GRUB Windows entries point to the Windows boot loader under names created by Boot Repair's more intrusive (and usually unnecessary) options. Based on your efibootmgr output, it looks like these intrusive options were unnecessary. You may want to run Boot Repair again, enter the Advanced screen, select the option to restore backups, and continue. This may clean things up a bit. OTOH, it could make matters worse -- this is one situation where an ESP backup may become vital.\n\n*You might want to try my rEFInd boot manager. You can download a version for CD-R or USB flash drive (see the downloads page) and try rEFInd risk-free -- although you'll need to temporarily disable Secure Boot to try it this way. (You can re-enable Secure Boot and install rEFInd to your hard disk from your regular boot if you like it.) It's conceivable that rEFInd will get Windows booting again, but I can make no promises of that. With the tangle of backup boot loaders created by Boot Repair, the rEFInd menu is likely to be overpopulated at first, but you can trim it back in various ways.\n\n", "Q: Login screen on Ubuntu fails to go into full screen or to fill window The login screen on Ubuntu fails to go into full screen or to fill window.\nHowever, when logging-in to user accounts, the screen does go full.\nI have already installed Guest Additions correctly and i use the Auto-resize Guest Display as shown at the image below.\nThat is maybe happening because of the console resolution (800x600).\nBut i don't want to make it static, but to make it resizable, by adjusting the host's window size.\nI \n\nA: In order to install Virtual Machine's Guest Additions you have to run:\nsudo apt-get install dkms build-essential linux-headers-generic -y\n\nOnce you have done that restart the VM and then once it boots back up go to Selecting Devices -> Install Guest Additions and then restart the VM once more.

I am using a public WiFi network on my Macbook, but for some reason my Ubuntu virtual machine won't detect it.  It was able to detect public WiFi networks before, but now it can't.  The network just isn't showing up in the network menu.  How can I fix this problem?\n\nA: Virtual Machines can't detect wireless networks if the Wireless Adapter is actually built into the host machine - this is because of the nature of how Virtual Networking works.\nBy the nature of what a Virtual Machine is, and what Virtual Network Devices are, it is impossible for the Macbook's internal wifi card to be 'bound' to the VM in such a way it would have wireless network connectivity.\nYOu need to connect your Macbook to that network, then have the Ubuntu VM connect to the Internet over a \"NAT\" type network connection device or a \"Bridged\" type network connection that is set to 'bridge' with the wifi card (in the VM settings)\n\n\nOkay, maybe I didn't phrase my problem very well. What I meant was, when I went to manually connect to the WiFi network within the VM, it wasn't listed as an option. Where it would normally allow me to connect to a WiFi network, it just says \"Disconnected\" and it's greyed out. – Zen Hacker\n\nUnless you've done as I said in comments and gotten an external USB wireless adapter and correctly set up USB passthrough of that device to the Virtual Machine, you can't have the VM manage wireless connections at all, for the reasons explained above.\n", "Q: Keyboard stopped working for one user - and one user only Since yesterday, my keyboard stopped working.

I'm trying to partition and install alongside Windows. I didn't have any free space to begin with, so I followed a guide on this site that told me how to do so.

At the bottom of your screen shot it says it is going to install the boot loader onto /dev/sda which is an SSD of 128GB. The partition layout in your screen shot is for /dev/sdb though and it says the Windows 7 loader partition is the first one on this drive. I don't know what you have on the 128GB SSD drive but please be sure your Windows is completely intact and that you know which drive has your boot sector. The Ubuntu installer thinks it is the 128GB SSD. It is usually correct but you should double check since it will affect your ability to boot when you are done.\nNow we can talk about Ubuntu. You don't have to create separate partitions for all those mount points. In fact, you can just create one for the root (named simply \"/\") and the rest of the mount points will be created as subdirectories. If you assign mount points to additional partitions then those partitions will be mounted there and files that go into those directories will be located in their assigned partition. If you don't know what you are doing then just use one partition mounted as root to keep it simple.\n", "Q: Interactive shell script autostart on custom Xubuntu live CD/USB I'm trying to make a live usb which runs an interactive shell script when booting.

Does anyone have any idea how to retain the dual monitor behaviour for the nvidia screens?\nmy xorg.conf:\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier     \"Layout0\"\n    Screen      0   \"Screen0\" 0 0\n    Screen      1   \"Screen1\" LeftOf \"Screen0\"\n    Screen      2  \"Screen2\" RightOf \"Screen0\"\n    InputDevice    \"Keyboard0\" \"CoreKeyboard\"\n    InputDevice    \"Mouse0\" \"CorePointer\"\n    Option         \"Xinerama\" \"0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Files\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n\n    # generated from default\n    Identifier     \"Mouse0\"\n    Driver         \"mouse\"\n    Option         \"Protocol\" \"auto\"\n    Option         \"Device\" \"/dev/psaux\"\n    Option         \"Emulate3Buttons\" \"no\"\n    Option         \"ZAxisMapping\" \"4 5\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n\n    # generated from default\n    Identifier     \"Keyboard0\"\n    Driver         \"kbd\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n\n    # HorizSync source: edid, VertRefresh source: edid\n    Identifier     \"Monitor0\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"Samsung S24D390\"\n    HorizSync       30.0 - 81.0\n    VertRefresh     50.0 - 75.0\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n#   HorizSync       28.0 - 33.0\n#   VertRefresh     43.0 - 72.0\n    Identifier     \"Monitor1\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"Ancor Communications Inc VX238\"\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n\n#    HorizSync       28.0 - 33.0\n#    VertRefresh     43.0 - 72.0\n    Identifier     \"Monitor2\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"Unknown\"\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device0\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"GeForce GTX 750 Ti\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device1\"\n    Driver         \"intel\"\n    VendorName     \"Intel Corporation\"\n    Option         \"AccelMethod\" \"uxa\"\n#    Option         \"AccelMethod\" \"sna\"\n#    Option      \"TearFree\"    \"true\"\n    BusID          \"PCI:0:2:0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen0\"\n    Device         \"Device0\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor0\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"Stereo\" \"0\"\n    Option         \"nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder\" \"DFP-0\"\n    Option         \"metamodes\" \"DVI-I-1: nvidia-auto-select +0+0, HDMI-0: nvidia-auto-select +1920+0\"\n    Option         \"MultiGPU\" \"Off\"\n    Option         \"SLI\" \"off\"\n    Option         \"BaseMosaic\" \"off\"\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen1\"\n    Device         \"Device0\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor1\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"Stereo\" \"0\"\n    Option         \"nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder\" \"DFP-1\"\n    Option         \"metamodes\" \"DVI-I-1: nvidia-auto-select +0+0, HDMI-0: nvidia-auto-select +1920+0\"\n    Option         \"MultiGPU\" \"Off\"\n    Option         \"SLI\" \"off\"\n    Option         \"BaseMosaic\" \"off\"\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen2\"\n    Device         \"Device1\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor2\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"metamodes\" \"1920x1080_60_0 +0+0\"\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\n\nA: https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome/issues/598\nIn the attachments you find a working xorg.conf.d :\n\"zaphod mode\" = four separate independant screens,\nworking with e.g. twm, fluxbox, xfce.\nUnfortunately, latest Openbox x11-wm/openbox-3.6.1 (Gentoo) for me \nalso only opened a working Desktop environment on Screen 0.0 only -\n0.1 .. 0.3 remained blank,\nalthough \"xrandr -q --screen 0.n\" delivered correct results.\n", "Q: How to Remove varicad2013-en (A Virus or PIA) I am having a problem.

In this case, it's missing /opt/VariCAD/desktop, so you might try sudo mkdir -p /opt/VariCAD/desktop and then repeat the apt-get purge to see if it uninstalls then or throws another error, and then repeat\n\n*(easier, buy will leave junk and parts of the package on disk, which will waste space and could be a problem if you want to reinstall it later): edit the /var/lib/dpkg/info/varicad2013-en.prerm and after the first line starting with #! add a line exit 0, and then retry the apt-get purge command. You might need to do the same to .postrm file. This will skip any cleanup the package needed to do when removed. If you opt for this option; it might be good idea to try to install package varicad2013-en again, and then purge it again, so it might do a more proper cleanup second time around.\n\n\nAnyway, with any of those steps when apt-get purge finishes without errors, you should be able to upgrade your system normally.\n", "Q: KVM remote-viewer: Force certain keys to stay in host OS I am using Ubuntu 14.04, running a Windows 7 guest VM via QEMU/KVM. It's all working fine, I interact with it via Spice using remote-viewer. I use Compiz to place the window automatically on the top right desktop (i.e. using workspaces) and keep it running most of the time. \nThe issue is this: I can use Ctrl + Alt + right to get into the remote-viewer window, but then because it captures all input I can't use Ctrl + Alt + left to get back to the other desktops in Ubuntu. I have to use the mouse to click the icon of the program I want to switch to from the launcher, which is annoying and makes it harder to use the workspaces feature. \nIs there a way to define keys that aren't passed to the guest OS? I want to have Ctrl + Alt +left/right/up/down kept within the host so that I can change workspace away from the Windows VM window. \n\nA: I don't have enough reputation to comment to have to put as an answer, I am looking for a similar solution, I need to send commands to host with keyboard shortcuts, from my research I found there is no way to do it with virt-viewer unless you write a custom app that wraps spice-gtk widget.\nIts a shame, I really need this.\n\nEdit.\nI Just found that it has been filed as a bug/feature request recently https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=93249\n\nEdit 2.\nAccording to this commit http://cgit.freedesktop.org/spice/spice-gtk/commit/?id=767e5522f64c115f66f6419abd378ad568e5564e this is possible from spice-gtk v0.27 unfortunately its not in 14.04 repo, but 15.10 ships with v0.28 i am considering upgrading to 15.10\n\nEdit 3.\nI just tested it in 15.10 and it works, left ctrl+alt releases focus then just do whatever keyboard short-cut you need.\nFor me this has solved the issue.\n", "Q: xUbuntu USB boot I just created an xUbuntu boot USB key using Universal-USB-Installer.\nMy Sony Viao has a USB port but xUbuntu did not load when I powered the computer.\nI learnt I have to configure my bios to allow loading from usb but I don't seem to have the relevant option.\nIn the boot section of my bios, I have the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Optical drive\n\n*Floppy disk drive\n\n*Hard disk drive\n\n*Network\n\n\nAs my computer does not have a floppy drive so I moved it to the top of the list, saved and restarted but xUbuntu still does not load from my USB stick.\nCan anyone help, please?\nUPDATE:\nIt seems none of the options allow for booting from cd either\n\nA: Look around in the settings for some option like Allow booting from External USB.

In the current workspace, I don't want to see the edge of a window I was working with on another workspace.\nAlso I like being able to shove a window mostly off screen so forcing bounds wouldn't be a good solution.\nIs there a way to just not show a window if it isn't part of the current workspace?\n\nA: How to prevent workspace- overlapping windows\nI believe the solution below is doing what you describe. This is what it does:\nThe usual effect: overlapping windows will appear on the adjacent workspaces \n\nEffectively, when pressing a key combination, this will be the result\n\nIn practice:\nAn example\n\n\n*\n\n*Working on (e.g.) workspace 1, with some windows overlapping on other workspaces\n\n*Then move to workspace 2, press the shortcut key combination:\nall windows, except the ones on the current workspace, will be minimized, and thus not appear on the current workspace anyway (except for the launcher).\n\n*Then returning to workspace 1, pressing the key combination again, the desktop will be exactly like you left it. Even de window order (z-wise) and possibly minimized windows will be exactly like it was. At the same time, windows on other than the current workspace will be hidden.\n\n\nHow it works\nThe solution includes two scripts; one background script, that keeps track on the z-order of the windows (since we do not have tools to get it otherwise), and a script to minimize the windows and keep track on which windows already were minimized by the user.\nWhy two scripts?\nInitially, I had the script combined in one, and it seemed to work fine. However, on my system, it increased the (idle) processor occupation from 3-4% to appr. 9-11%, which is too much for a background script in my opinion, especially when you run multiple scripts at the same time.\nThe script is now split into a background section that keeps track on the focus- history (to be able to un- minimize the windows in the same z- order as you left the workspace), and a script to call with a keyboard shortcut. The background script adds practically no background noise.\nHow to set up\n\n\n*\n\n*The script(s) need both wmctrl and xdotool:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl xdotool\n\n\n*Copy script1 below into an empty file, safe it as focus_history.py:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport os\n\nrootdata = os.environ[\"HOME\"]+\"/.focus_history\"\n\ndef current_windows():\n    try:\n        return subprocess.check_output([\"wmctrl\", \"-l\"]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n        pass\n\ndef convert_format(w_id):\n    return w_id[:2]+(10-len(w_id))*\"0\"+w_id[2:]\n\ndef read_data():\n    return open(rootdata).read().splitlines()\n\ndef get_top(wlist):\n    try:\n        top = convert_format(\n            [l.split(\"#\")[-1].strip() for l in subprocess.check_output(\n                [\"xprop\", \"-root\"]\n                ).decode(\"utf-8\").splitlines() \\\n               if \"_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW(WINDOW)\" in l][0])       \n        return [l for l in wlist if top in l][0]\n    except IndexError:\n        pass\n\nopen(rootdata, \"wt\").write(\"This is an empty line\")\n\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n    wdata = current_windows()\n    if wdata != None:\n        wlist = wdata.splitlines()\n        # get frontmost window (as in wmctrl -lG)\n        top = get_top(wlist)\n        oldlist = read_data()\n        if not any([top == oldlist[0], top == None]):\n            # clean up closed windows\n            [oldlist.remove(l) for l in oldlist if not l.split()[0] in wdata]\n            # remove possible other mentions of the active window\n            [oldlist.remove(l) for l in oldlist if l.startswith(top.split()[0])]\n            open(rootdata, \"wt\").write((\"\\n\").join([top]+oldlist))\n\n\n*Copy script2 below into an empty file, safe it as stop_overlap.py:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport os\n\nwfile = os.environ[\"HOME\"]+\"/.m_list\"\nrootdata = os.environ[\"HOME\"]+\"/.focus_history\"\n\ndef get_res():\n    # get the resolution (workspace- size)\n    data = subprocess.check_output([\"xrandr\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").split()\n    mark = data.index(\"current\")\n    return [int(n) for n in [data[mark+1], data[mark+3].replace(\",\", \"\")]]\n\nres =  get_res()\n\ndef get_wlist(res):\n    try:\n        # get the window data\n        wlist = [l.split() for l in subprocess.check_output(\n            [\"wmctrl\", \"-lG\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").splitlines()]\n        # check if windows are \"normal\" windows and see if they are minimized\n        show = [];

The \\; will cause find to run the command once for each file, and the + will make it try and run the command on many files at once, making it more efficient. Since your grep is using -H (print filenames), the + is the better choice.

As OS, I want to dual-boot to Windows 7 and Ubuntu (KUbuntu more precisely). \nAt no point did I think there would be an issue with Linux and this MB, but I found some threads/reviews where people were complaining either about the UEFI booting or about not supported drivers for Killer 2400 network card.\nMy current set-up is a dual-boot win7 with ubuntu, but it's a pre UEFI era, so I have no issues with not supported drivers or booting.\nIn a nutshell, my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will I be able to safely dual-boot to win7 and my choice of Linux distro?\n\n*Will Ubuntu detect my Killer 2400 network card out of the box?\n\n\ncheers. \nP.S. I found this question regarding E2400 installation but I am a bit puzzled how can one do sudo apt-get install when the network card is not working....\nEdit 1: First part done. Set up the PC and successfully installed win 7. It wasn't as easy as it should though, due to the fact the z170 chipset has some issues with win 7 installation: \n\nMicrosoft is removing support for the EHCI host controller (USB 2.0\n  spec) and keeping only the xHCI host controller spec\n\nAnyway, that's as far as I got. Did boot into Kubuntu live DVD, and confirmed that internet is running, so the E2400 network card at least is supported.\nTonight I'll fire off the installation and hopefully I'll have dual-boot without issues.\nEdit 2: I finally did it. I have now dual boot with Win7 and Ubuntu (yes, I remained on Ubuntu and didn't migrate to Kubuntu or even Antergos as I was debating for a while).\n\nA: I did find this !

This can be worked-around on some machines by resetting bits of hardware, but it still make life more difficult for attackers.\nAlso note, as discussed in the comments below this post on resetting the admin password that having physical access to the machine means that a attacker can use various ways to circumvent security such as passwords by simply taking the machine apart. If you believe such security for your data on the computer is necessary, full-disk encryption or a similar may be the way to go - though if you need to recover the data in the event of some software/hardware failure this may make it difficult/impossible.\nTo find out some of the extremes of protection you can use, try this question.\n", "Q: How to get to a perfect jackd configuration that works trouble-free and out of the box? While working on a PPA to provide binaries for Sonic Pi, the users of the PPA binaries keep stumbling over jackd. How to make things easier for them?\nSonic Pi is an educational music tool that combines an electronic synthesizer with a programming language. It targets novice users and school children to teach coding through fun with music. The software's main install target is Raspbian where it comes pre-installed. And the code contains some built-in hacks, uh I mean, pragmatic solutions to get jackd up and running on the Raspberry Pi. But these hacks are RPi-specific and don't work well on other distributions.\nHere's the situation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sonic-Pi is a graphical IDE\n\n*with a ruby-based server running in the background that controls the music\n\n*to play the music, it's using scsynth (a part of Supercollider) as the synthesizer backend\n\n*scsynth currently requires using jackd to play audio on Linux\n\n*the ruby-based Sonic Pi server starts jackd (if it isn't already running) and then scsynth\n\n\nNow here the troubles begin if you're on Ubuntu (and I guess on Debian, too):\n\n\n*\n\n*jackd's default config on Ubuntu doesn't seem to work for everybody, so on some systems, it just won't start and the user has to use qjackctl or dig into the logs and change the configuration files\n\n*when jackd does start, it blocks PulseAudio, so any program using audio already running will stop working\n\n*jackd prefers realtime scheduling, but Ubuntu isn't preconfigured to do this and requires changes to the user to do it\n\n\nSo all in all, it's a mess. This isn't the experience a novice user wants after installing Sonic Pi.\nThere are guides out there how to get jackd working with Ubuntu, but working through them is asking too much from a novice user or a teacher in a classroom who just want to get this software going.\nSo what I'm looking for is a way that will make sure that after installing Sonic Pi from the .deb, things with jackd work out of the box, trouble-free, no manual configuration required.\nThe wishlist is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*a configuration for jackd that \"just works\" out of the box\n\n*for all non-privileged user accounts\n\n*that doesn't block PulseAudio/ALSA on the same system\n\n*on a default Ubuntu (and if possible on a default Debian and Raspbian, too)\n\n*and the distribution's default audio mixer and volume control hotkeys keeps working\n\n\nDoes this even exist?\nIs there a .deb for this (or can a .deb be made) that users can just install to have it configured that way?\n\nA: I have read the Takkat comments and may be this will be ok for you:   \n\n\n*\n\n*From here,  install \"pulseaudio-module-jack\" then edit /etc/pulse/default.pa (sudo gedit /etc/pulse/default.pa ) :  Add the following lines, underneath the line that says #load-module module-alsa-sink\nload-module module-jack-sink\nload-module module-jack-source\nThen create or modify  .jackrc in your home containing:\n/usr/bin/jackd --no-realtime -dalsa -dhw -r44100 -p1024 -n2\nRestart pulseaudio running killall pulseaudio (also  stop jackd if running  killall jackd ) :   pulseaudio will restart automatically and jackd will also start, both correctly connected so Jackd and Pulseaudio can be used at the same time .\n     (this works on my Ubuntu 14.04 pc ) .  \n\n\n*\n\n*Realtime is only needed if you want  low latency for multitrack recording.\nThe above jackd config will produce 21ms latency which is good for most audio programs (the latency can be increases setting 2048 instead 1024 in .jackrc  , look jackd --help)\nSo you don't have to give realtime access to users,\n(You can ignore  warnings if any (\"Cannot use real-time scheduling\")) .\nThe -dhw parameter should work on most pc, but it can be ommited  to use default audio device, or changed to -d hw:1,0 to use 2nd audio device\n\n*May be one more step if you needed to connect manually jackd to audio in/out   using \"Qjackctl connect manager\"  (most programs connect to jackd automatically, in this case no need to do this ) : install \"jack tools\"  and use \"jack_connect\" commands to script these connections  (you can also use aj-snapshot  to save and restore  jack connections )\n\n", "Q: Running setup.py bdist_wheel for cffi Failed building wheel for cryptography I am trying to build a docker image.

observations:\n\n*\n\n*you are not alone\n\n*the aptitude version changed from 0.6.11 (in Ubuntu 15.04) to 0.7.3\n\n*/usr/share/aptitude/NEWS lists the changes between the two versions, and for 0.7.2 we read under \"internal changes\"\n\n\nImprove retrieval of source package information with (upcoming) APT 1.1.\nThanks to David Kalnischkies for the suggestion and implementation advice.\nInformation about source package and version will be in the binary cache, and available via the VerIterator (ver.SourcePkgName() and\nver.SourceVerStr()) and it is much faster than parsing the package record.\n\nWhat caught my eye was \"will be in the binary cache\" as something that will be true for APT 1.1, but the APT version right now is only 1.01 in Ubuntu 15.10\nSo it looks like it will just take some patience until you find the full descriptions again.\n", "Q: passphrase issue with correct ssh keys It is the first time I experienced this issue : I have setup ssh keys and I set the passphrase.

When I started out with Linux, and while studying the file structure and access permissions of Linux systems, a thought formulated in my mind, that as long as you operate only within your less priviledged or restricted account, no virus or malware that ever gets into your account, will ever affect the entire system. Nor would \"it\" affect the various application installed, as the settings and saved documents are all stored exclusively in your account...or, am I mistaken on this?\nRegarding this, I have concerns with the \"sudo\" command in Ubuntu.  If ever I used sudo with a priviledged account using a terminal, from inside an unpriviledged but infected user or guest account, will a malware from the infected user's home folder still seep to the entire system, and render my Ubuntu system infected?\nAlso, with the Windows Emulator, Wine... I noticed the applications I installed are not system wide, but are localized in the account I was using when I installed it.  Unfortunately, the wine applications are malware magnets. Within a week, ClamTK has detected 700+ threats.  Should I be worried, of this threats getting out and infect the entire system?\nThanks in advance to the ones who could shed light on this.\n\nA: One note before I start:\nI talk about theoretical threats, not about actually existing and widespread pieces of malware.\nAs long as you operate an account without admin and sudo privilege and infect it by e.g. installing (manually or automatically behind your back, after clicking somewhere you shouldn't have clicked) a malware program to your home folder, this infection should stay limited to this account.\nI say should, because:\n\n\n*\n\n*an admin user could launch the infected file from his account as root and infect the machine this way.\n\n*the malware could infect portable devices (USB sticks etc.) mounted by the user, and then get spread on other machines or other user accounts on the same machine, when you mount it with another user later.\n\n*the malware could spread itself over the network, infect another machine in your LAN and then infect the admin account when it's logged on next time and connects to the other infected computer.\n\n*there are various known possibilities how an application could bypass the restrictions. This is called \"privilege escalation\", which means that the application runs with higher privileges than allowed/intended due to exploited software bugs, too permissive file system permissions, etc ...  \n\n*As Ubuntu comes with a sudo timeout > 0s, you are not required to enter your sudo password multiple times within a short time period (by default 15 minutes, if I remember right?) to run several commands as root, but just get prompted once for the first one. If the malware now overwrote a file for which the infected user has write access (enters a command to run itself as root using sudo) and you later run the file without using sudo, but within the timeout, you don't even notice that there's something going on with elevated privileges.\n\n*probably more...\nYou see, most chances for the malware to infect the whole machine require user interaction and/or depend on how strictly one keeps his accounts, computers and pluggable drives separated. \nThe bugs allowing privilege escalations are usually quickly fixed after the developers learn about them, but in the time between the discovery of a bug through malicious hackers and the release of a fix, new malware could bypass the user restrictions exploiting the bug.\n\nConclusion: \nMost malware is probably not capable of elevating its privileges and getting root access to infect your entire machine, unless you manually grant it by entering your sudo password in the wrong input box. That means behaving carefully and thinking about every command you run twice (especially if other users have write permissions on a file you want to execute) should protect you pretty well.\nHowever, there's never 100% security, because malware developers are often one step ahead of the software programmers responsible for bug fixes and security patches. \n", "Q: How to pair Wiimote in Ubuntu 15.10? there are other posts about the Wiimote pairing, but none of the answers helped me, most of them are form ubuntu 12.10 and ubuntu 10.04 soe they are pretty old.\nthe question is that Wiimote should be paired without any code, but the option to pair without entering a code is there any-more. is there a way to manually pair the wiimote without any GUI? maybe via config file or something like that?\n\nA: Using the standard Ubuntu bluetooth GUI, the solution is not to use the 1+2 button method, but to use the sync button behind the wiimote, you can setup the wiimote without pairing, the wiimote will remain recognized but apparently unpaired (no lights in the wiimote), and then you can \"activate\" the wiimote from the GUI and press again the \"sync\" button, now it will remain paired (without inputting a pair-code) one of the single LEDs will remain on (it will not rumble though)\nthen with the \"+\" \"-\" buttons you can control the volume of Ubuntu, and with the dpad you can move the focus on whatever is selected according to the direction you press amongst other things, so the wiimote is active and working, now you're set! :)\n\nA: You asked for a no GUI way\nInstall Xwiimote\nsudo apt-get install xwiimote\n\nBasic set up from the official documentation\n\nConnecting Wii Remotes\n   To connect a Wii Remote to your host be sure that  the  official  linux\n   Bluetooth stack (BlueZ) is installed on your system and your kernel has\n   the hid-wiimote kernel plugin loaded.

The Wii Remote will\n   stay in discoverable mode for 20s. You can also hold the 1+2 buttons to\n   put  the  Wii Remote into discoverable state. However, the first method\n   works more reliably!  If you are asked for PIN input while bonding  the\n   devices, then your BlueZ bluetoothd daemon does not include the wiimote\n   plugin. See Bugs below for more information. If this does not help, you\n   can  still connect to your Wii Remote without pairing/bonding (i.e. not\n   using authentication with a PIN).

However, Windows decided it wanted my entire computer recently and in process made it impossible to boot to either OS.\nIt all began while restarting my computer to change operating systems from Linux to Windows 10 at which time Windows detected some issues with the hard disk and started repairing them.  After several hours I noticed that neither OS worked anymore.  The GRUB menu no longer appears and only a black screen loads.  I get the same result when I remove the disk that is running Linux, so the computer appears to be trying to load Windows 10.\nI booted the computer using a Linux boot disk and most of my data appears to exist on both disks.  The only thing I noticed is that my Ubuntu disk is missing a huge chunk of disk space.  Paced on previous readings, I believe this disk space may have been where the OS was previously stored.\nRepair Attempts\n\n\n*\n\n*Using gparted I tried reallocating the disk space that was deallocated by Windows using the \"unformatted\" format option in hopes that something would still exist there.  After doing so I ran \"Attempt Data Rescue\" and nothing useful was found.\n\n*I used boot repair to try to fix the MBR, but this did not work either.  If interested, the output of this operation is available here.\n\n\nSo, what should I do from here?  I assume Ubuntu is no longer installed and I need to reinstall it on the partition that was unallocated by Windows.  If so, does anybody have any tips so I don't loose any data?\nImage of gparted\n\nUpdate\nI tried following the instructions at the site you mentioned by markkirby, but it seems nothing was actually copied over to the HD.  I made the partition ext2 and set the mount point as / without formatting the partition.  Gparted is reporting the partition as ext2, but it says the partition is empty and it still can't boot.  Looks like my last option is to format the partition and risk loosing whatever data was on the partition that also stored the OS.\n\nA: You can try the following.\n1) Boot your computer from the USB stick and copy files important to you to the external HDD. \n2) If you see that access to your files is denied when you boot from USB or CD (it often happens), take your HDD to any HDD enclosure and copy files important to you to another computer. \n3) If you want to copy anything from ext4 partitions, another computer should run Linux. There are also some tools to read ext4 partitions from Windows 8x, you can use them if you are comfortable with them. \n4) Install Windows 8.1  (not 10!!!) first. Don't accept any options to upgrade to Windows 10 since this system has some unpredictable behaviors. Choose clean installation and erase this HDD completely. Don't try to keep your old OS and data, it will just create a mess. If you don't want dual boot anymore, skip this step.\n5) Install Ubuntu to any separate physical HDD. Choose clean installation and erase this HDD completely. Don't try to keep your old OS and data, it will just create a mess.\n6) Run sudo update-grub in the terminal if you have installed Windows and want your dual boot back. \n", "Q: How do I replace \"fancy\" unicode chars with their ascii equivalends?

I have Lubuntu 14.04 installed on my desktop pc. The desktop pc has a SiS 651 graphics chipset.\nAs apparently commonly occurs with SiS graphics users, the resolution needed to be fixed by configuring Xorg to read in the sis drivers instead of the modesetting.\nI did this with the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create the xorg.conf file in /etc/X11/ with:\n\n\nsudo service lightdm stop\nsudo Xorg -configure\nsudo mv xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\n\n*Edit the xorg.conf file, replacing (in the Section \"Device\" section)\n\n\nDriver      \"modesetting\"\nwith\nDriver      \"sis\"\nand adding (in the Section \"Monitor\" section)\nHorizSync       28.0 - 83.0\nVertRefresh     56.0 - 75.0\n\nand adding (in the Section \"Screen\" section, in the last SubSection \"Display\" subsection)\nModes     \"1360x768\"\n\nSo far, so good. The resolution is now fixed and I can use 1360x768 resolution (the computer is capable of even more, but my television isn't). At this point the splash screen was still displaying correctly.\nNext I want to get Lubuntu to read in the sisfb framebuffer driver, so that I can enable 2D acceleration and fully use the chipset's frame buffer capabilities.\nI achieved that in a process covered by this question. But I shall summarise here:\n\n\n*\n\n*I added the line sisfb to the end of /etc/modules\n\n*I edited the /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-framebuffer.conf and /etc/modprobe.d/fbdev-blacklist.conf files, commenting out the blacklist sisfb lines by adding # at the beginning of the line.\nI also blacklisted vesafb by deleting # at the beginning of the blacklist vesafb lines.\n\n*I disabled the vesafb framebuffer in grub2 by editing /etc/default/grub and uncommenting the line:\nGRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT=console\nby deleting the # at the beginning of the line. Then I executed the command:\nsudo update-grub\nand rebooted. (When vesafb loads, it prevents sisfb from loading. By disabling vesafb, sisfb can load and take the framebuffer memory)\n\n\n*At this point, /etc/X11/xorg.conf renamed itself /etc/X11/xorg.conf.11282015, and the splash screen became corrupted: instead of the splash screen I saw lots of coloured vertical stripes, as if the computer had crashed. After a few seconds, the splash screen went away and the greeter came on fine, albeit at a low resolution. But according to the logs, sisfb has loaded.\n\n*I renamed /etc/X11/xorg.conf.11282015 back to /etc/X11/xorg.conf and rebooted. So now, my resolution is back to 1360x768, and sisfb has loaded (framebuffer memory is allocated and 2D acceleration is enabled according to logs), but I have a corrupted splash screen.\nI can live with the corrupted splash screen, but other users may think that the computer has crashed when all they have to do is wait a few seconds. And ideally I would like a working splash screen, but without reverting to losing the sisfb driver.\nAny ideas on how to restore the splash screen without losing the sisfb driver?\nEDIT: Here are a couple of things I have tried\n\n\n*\n\n*I added the line GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=text to /etc/default/grub and did sudo update-grub, hoping I would get a text splash instead. Still got a corrupted splash screen, before getting to the greeter displayed as normal. (So I have removed it)\n\n*I added the line GRUB_PRELOAD_MODULES=\"sis sisfb\" to /etc/default/grub and did sudo update-grub. This resulted in a corrupted grub menu as well as a corrupted splash screen. Fortunately I only had to wait for the menu to select the default, then wait for the splash screen, then wait for the greeter. (So I removed it)\n\n*I pressed \"c\" at the grub menu to enter console mode. I then entered the command insmod video_all (as described in mniess' answer here). I got the error error: file '/grub/i386-pc/video_all.mod' not found. UPDATE: I have discovered that the correct command is insmod all_video not insmod video_all. videoinfo then produces a long list of available resolutions that disappear off the top and right of the screen. This doesn't help me because I have already tried GFX_PAYLOAD_LINUX=800x600 without success, and I can at least see that 800x600 is available.\n\n*I have tried adding the line GRUB_VIDEO_BACKEND=sis to /etc/default/grub and did sudo update-grub. I got a Press any key... message after the grub menu. On pressing a key I got the corrupted splash screen, then the normal greeter. I tried again with GRUB_VIDEO_BACKEND=sisfb instead and got the same result.\n\n\nA: I have a workaround:\nI can edit /etc/default/grub and change the following command:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nto\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet\"\nAnd then sudo update-grub and reboot.\nI then don't get a splash screen, but I get some log messages instead. However, the screen is not corrupted so I can live with that and it shouldn't make other users think the computer has crashed.\nIdeally I would still like a nice graphical splash screen, so I will wait  for a better answer. \n", "Q: Determine how many times a specific OS has been booted Maybe my question is a bit silly to ask, but are there any way to count how many times a specific item was selected from GRUB2.\nI will have Windows 10 and Ubuntu 15.10 installed and I would like to make a chart and statistics about my OS usage.

There also may be hazards in downloading packages from locations that are not the repositories which your distro had included/enabled by default, since third-party packages can be malicious in nature.\n\napt-get/aptitude install automatically accesses the repositories and PPAs indexes you enabled, searches for the best candidate, downloads it and all its dependencies and installs and configures them automatically.\nUsing apt-get install -f, you can automatically install missing dependencies of packages e.g. installed through dpkg -i.\n", "Q: Accidentally removed Spotify folder, now I can't uninstall anything I accidentally removed Spotify folder and now I can't uninstall programs from with apt-get or the Software Center, when I try to remove the flash plugin from the command line it give me this error:\n/var/lib/dpkg/info/spotify-client.postinst: 5: /var/lib/dpkg/info/spotify-client.postinst: ./register.sh: not found\ndpkg: error processing package spotify-client (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 127\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n spotify-client\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nWhat to do?\n\nA: Since it seems, that the Spotify package is still in the “configured” state, but had some of its files removed, you need to reinstall it first:\nsudo apt-get install -f --reinstall spotify-client\n\nThen you should be able to uninstall it normally:\nsudo apt-get remove spotify-client\n\n\nA: Download the spotify-client deb package from the repo:\ncd ~/Downloads && apt-get download spotify-client\n\nInstall it with dpkg\nsudo dpkg -i --force-all --no-triggers downloaded_deb\n\nIf it works, you will be able to remove it properly.\nIf it doesn't work but returns 127 error, you may need to reinstall dpkg, this is a tip to overcome the uncompleted installation of a package (In your case, the folder of Spotify was accidentally removed).

(Without reinstalling Windows or Mac)\n\n\nA: What's happened is that Ubuntu has installed GRUB as the primary boot manager on the computer, which is overriding the rEFInd boot. It's unclear from your description if you're able to boot all three OSes from GRUB. If not, or if you don't like GRUB, you can restore rEFInd to be the primary boot loader.\nThe less invasive but harder way to do this is to use efibootmgr in Ubuntu. Type sudo efibootmgr -v to see a list of boot options. Look for one that references rEFInd (it may be called \"Mac OS X\" or something similar, but should refer to the rEFInd binary filename). You can then use the -o option to efibootmgr to set it to the start of the boot order, as in sudo efibootmgr -o 0080,0001,0081 if the rEFInd option is Boot0080 and Boot0001 and Boot0081 are things you might want to boot if rEFInd fails to come up for some reason.\nThe easier but somewhat-overkill way to get rEFInd working again is to re-install it. You should be able to do this either from OS X or from Ubuntu. Once it's re-installed, you should be able to boot any of your OSes from rEFInd. In the case of Ubuntu (and perhaps OS X or Windows), you should be able to do so either directly or via GRUB.\n", "Q: gnome panel broken since last update With Ubuntu 14.04, I happily used gnome-session-fallback until yesterday, when a regular update broke my top bar panel after reboot.

Generally speaking, for a single-OS installation, there's little advantage to be had for booting in one mode vs. the other. If you have a specific reason to want EFI-mode booting, please say what it is.\nIf you want to switch to EFI-mode booting, you (pretty much) have to switch from MBR to GPT. This can be done dynamically with gdisk; see this page for details. This may require some additional re-partitioning, though -- in particular, booting in EFI mode requires an EFI System Partition (ESP), which your disk doesn't seem to have at the moment.\nYour partition table doesn't seem to show a separate /home partition, so preserving /home will require backing up your current /home and then restoring it when you're done. OTOH, maybe I'm missing something -- which brings me to....\nFor future reference, whenever somebody asks for program output, please either edit your original question or post it to a pastebin site and provide a link to your document there.

(We're all volunteering our time.)\n\nA: Unless you have multiple operating systems running, reinstalling Ubuntu in EFI mode won't make any issue. Since your disk uses MBR partitioning scheme you should first convert it to GPT. However MBR-to-GPT conversion could sometimes leave gaps because of alignment policies.\nNext time you partitioning also consider LVM\nSince you don't seem to have a separate /home partition consider backing up any important files there.\n", "Q: Cannot seem to install libcurl4-openssl-dev package I am unable to install this package.

Every time I power on my system it says \"[     1.493615] ACPI PCC probe failed.\" Sometimes the type gets smaller and a second line appears and then it goes to the log-in screen, but this does not happen often, when at the log-in screen, after about a second, the screen freezes and the pointer wont even move. Any help?\n\nA: If your system finally boots and works OK, do nothing. If the system doesn't boot, freezes all the time, and it annoys you\n\n\n*\n\n*back up your files \n\n*if your laptop won't boot, unplug it, take your hard drive to any HDD enclosure and copy important files to another computer\n\n*download and install a different OS from the USB stick (you may want to Google how to create a bootable USB stick) \n\n*choose \"erase everything\" option during the installation, and don't keep an old OS\n\n*see what happens \n\n\n\"ACPI PCC probe failed\" message is typical for Ubuntu 14.04 when you install it to a pretty old machine. Choose a system designed for older machines and less resource hungry. Likely you will need Linux Mint Mate 32-bit, because your laptop seems pretty old. If it's the one that initially came with Vista, it's a really old one. It may be just incompatible with some latest Ubuntu versions.\n", "Q: How can I print from Vim to PDF? I would have thought this is rather simple, but I don't get it done: I use gVim and would like to get the text as a PDF file. In other applications like Firefox the print dialog shows me available printers and I can choose to print directly to a PDF file. However, in Vim there is no such dialog and the file is just sent to the standard printer of the system.\nI tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm not able to make the \"print-to-pdf\" thing my standard way of printing via the printer window of Ubuntu.\n\n*:ha > file converts my file to a .ps file. That's nice, but .pdf would be nicer...\n\n\nA: Vim will not show you the print dialog box. Instead, you can print to a PostScript file, open it in a PostScript viewer and print from there.\nTo print to a PostScript file from Vim:\n:hardcopy > myfile.ps\n\nYou can also convert PostScript to PDF using ps2pdf:\nps2pdf myfile.ps\n\n\nA: Building on what others have already stated:\nYou can use the following single-line Vim command to create a PDF file:\n:hardcopy > %.ps | !ps2pdf %.ps && rm %.ps\n\nNote:\n\n\n*\n\n*The % is shorthand for the current filename, so HelloWorld.C will print to HelloWorld.C.pdf\n\n*If you want to also retain the intermediate .ps file, simply omit the && rm %.ps, obtaining:\n:hardcopy > %.ps | !ps2pdf %.ps\nAdditionally, to change the rendered font, set the printfont before executing the hardcopy command.  For example, to select Courier 8:\n:set printfont=Courier:h8\n\nPutting it all together, I decided to add the following to my .vimrc file so that I can simply execute the :HardcopyPdf command. This command can also operate on a selected range within a file:\n\" Select the font for the hardcopy\nset printfont=Courier:h8\ncommand! -range=% HardcopyPdf <line1>,<line2> hardcopy > %.ps | !ps2pdf %.ps && rm %.ps && echo 'Created: %.pdf'\n\n", "Q: Reinstall Ubuntu without any USB/CD/DVD I screwed up my Ubuntu system, so now I need to format and reinstall Ubuntu, but I don't have any USB drives or CD/DVDs\n\nIt looks like this now. I only have Ubuntu, so I don't have dualboot of any kind.\nI was thinking about creating a new partition from the unused space in /dev/sda2 for my backup stuff and then create another partition to install a bootable Ubuntu on, then I'll boot into that bootable partition and then format and install Ubuntu on /dev/sda2 again.\nIs it possible for me to achieve something like this?\n\nA: I found a way which requires an rooted Android device.\nYou need to download this app: DriveDroid - Google Play. And move a Ubuntu iso file to your Android device and use the app to make Android bootable with that iso and then use your computer to boot from it.\n\nI had issues with I couldn't do anything with my /dev/sda2 partition even when booting from Android. So I downloaded GParted live iso and used GParted to shrinken my root partition and make a backup partition, then I used Ubuntu to move my files from my root partition to the new backup partition.\nThen set Android to be a Ubuntu bootable again and install ubuntu from there. Then copy my files and used gparted again to make my new ubuntu use the old backup partition.\n\nA: Based on comments, you must have a wired internet connection to use netboot.\nDownload the appropriate initrd.gz file and the appropriate linux file for your architecture and distribution from here.\nSave them inside /boot. (These files are quite small, under 10MB for either architecture.)\nReboot your computer and enter the grub menu. Now we will get grub to boot from the files you just downloaded.\nPress c to get a grub command prompt. Type each of the following lines:\nroot=(hd0,1)\n\nReplace hd0,1 with the drive and partition on which your /boot is located. You can look at and copy the root line of any existing boot menu entry if you are at all unsure what this is, or you can try tab-completing after root ( or root (hd0,.\nNow type\nlinux /boot/linux\n\nThen\ninitrd /boot/initrd.gz\n\nFinally type\nboot\n\nYour system should now boot into the Ubuntu installer.

You can install it by typing:\n  sudo apt-get install ecryptfs-utils\". \n\nIf this is the case then what is encrypting my drive. A newbie to Ubuntu so be gentle.\nI simple want to achieve two things \n\n\n*\n\n*Completely remove the system wide encryption, and or\n\n*Leave the encryption in place and re-size my boot drive by shrinking  the home drive. \n\n\nThe explanation here is too assuming and hence complicated for a newbie, and does not address the second option.\n\nA: The command you describe (ecryptfs-setup-private) is for home directory encryption.  This is another kind of encryption that just encrypts your home directory and is not the full disk type.  So in your case, this is not what you have.\nYour best bet is to copy the data off and reinstall.  However, if you are just trying to avoid the password at boot then you can work around the problem as described here (make sure you have a backup first just in case)\nhttp://atterer.org/linux-remove-disable-luks-encryption-password-on-disk-partition-crypttab-initrd\nvia an answer here:\nCan I disable full-disk encryption?\n", "Q: Laptop sound issue.

Excuse my poor English and my ignorance about Ubuntu and Linux world in general.\nI just received a .p7b file in order to connect with a private site through HTTPS.

Nonetheless, if I tried to connect that site, Chrome gives me a NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID.

I have received a certificate in .p7b format. First, I converted it into .pem format. Then, I imported it into Firefox (or your browser).

Assuming it does work, follow the linked instructions to determine the screen resolutions your system supports and step up through them until things stop working, then back up one step.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: I also encountered the problem, guessing should be compatibility issue. You can check the log in the following paths like /var/log/syslog,var/log/lightdm/lightdm.log. \nIt seems hard to correct the problem by changing the set of NVIDIA's drive or GUI modules considering that i have tried my such programs by googling.\nMy solution is: Change your Monitor cable.

I've been working on a script that will watch a directory, and then move files to various other directories based on certain criteria.

Here's another idea I have, but am unsure how this would handle problems such as trying to sort/move incomplete files:\nwhile true\ndo\ninotifywait -e moved_to `dirname $0`/watch && /bin/bash `dirname $0`/autotorrent.sh\ndone\n\nwhich will launch the following script when files are added:\ncd `dirname $0`/watch\nfor i in *; do\n    if $(echo \"$FILE\" | grep -q \".jpg\"); then\n        cp \"./$FILE\" \"../images/\"\n    elif $(echo \"$FILE\" | grep -q \".mp4\"); then\n        cp \"./$FILE\" \"../videos/\"\n    elif $(echo \"$FILE\" | grep -q \".mp3\"); then\n        cp \"./$FILE\" \"../audio/\"\n    else\n        cp \"./$FILE\" \"../other/\"\n    fi\ndone\n\nI'm just not sure how best to handle moving multiple files which may or may not take considerable time to copy. I've got several ideas, but none of them really seem to be the robust solution I'm looking for.\nThanks again to anyone who has some advice for me\n\nA: Since your files could be Large, the cp takes non-zero time. During this time, you probably miss notifications. Try tossing all the cp commands into the background by appending a & to each. That will get you back to the inotifywait quicker.  \nAlso, you could eliminate a bunch of calls to grep by doing:  \n    j=${i##*.}\n    case \"$j\" in \n        jpg) cp $i ../images/ & ;;\n        mp4) cp $i ../videos/ & ;;\n        mp3) cp $i ../audio/ & ;;\n        *) cp $i ../other/& ;;\n    esac\n\nAlthough I don't see why you want to keep a copy of each file both directories, why not use mv instead of cp?\n@zpawwn: On further man inotifywait reading, I found --monitor, so, your script should be:  \ncd `dirname $0`/watch\ninotifywait -e moved_to ../watch --format \"%f\" --monitor | while read FILE\ndo\n    j=\"${FILE##*.}\"\n        case \"$j\" in \n            jpg) mv \"$FILE\" ../images/ & ;;\n            mp4) mv \"$FILE\" ../videos/ & ;;\n            mp3) mv \"$FILE\" ../audio/ & ;;\n            *) mv \"$FILE\" ../other/& ;;\n        esac\n done\n\nLet inotifywait manage the file event queueing, and spit out filenames as it notices them. The old way had inotifywait finding ONE new file and exiting, letting your cp stuff run, then restart watching. The other files (that arrived at the same time) are no longer new (they were there when the 2nd inotifywait started).\n", "Q: Steam on Ubuntu 64bit 15.10?

When user1 runs PyCharm (user1 must run a Django app) as sudo then the app at a later stage is required to create a folder folder1 to hold some personal files of user1. Now this folder when PyCharm is ran with sudo is created with owner:group = root:root.\n\n\n*\n\n*Why I get this owner:group in the folder? Is it because I used sudo?\n\n\nNow, when user1 runs PyCharm without sudo the same folder is created with owner:group = user1:user1\n\n\n*why I get this owner:group in the folder? Is it because I didn't used sudo and was logged in as user1? \n\n*Which process decides the group a created folder belongs to?\nPRODUCTION\nAgain user1 has to run the Django app, but through the gunicorn service this time, which since it is a service can be ran only with sudo, so I always get the folder1 created as owner:group = root:root.\nNow since my desired folder1 creation status needs to be user1:user1 and I can't run the gunicorn service without sudo what are the appropriate permission settings that would allow to have this? Bare in mind that the user needs to delete and re create this folder and all of its children under the same wanted permissions, so a simple manual chmod won't solve the problem. \n\n\n*How I should configure the production account to be able to have this behavior?\n\n\nI am sorry if I confused you but I tried to describe in a very detailed manner the problem. Thank you very much. \n\nA: Question #1 and Question #2: you have already answered them yourself! The user who runs a directory creation command becomes the owner of the directory. When you run a command with sudo, then this command is (by default) run ‘as’ the super user. The super user is called root, consequently root becomes the owner of new directories. When you run a command without sudo, then the user who is running the command (user1 in your case) becomes the owner of created directories.\nQuestion #3: For every user there is a default group that is used when files/directories are created (leaving some details aside). It’s the first group you see when running the groups command in a shell. In Ubuntu there is usually a default group with the same name as the user name.\nQuestion #4: I’m not sure why your folder1 needs to be accessible by user1 if everything is run by root in production. One possibility to solve the permissions might be to chown user1:user1 /path/to/folder1 when it is created by root. But to be honest, this whole setup sounds a bit shaky to me without knowing more about what you are actually doing.\n", "Q: mic stopped working for some applications I have a very strange issue with my microphone.  I was playing around with an external USB sound card (it didn't end up working with ubuntu, but that's not what I'm asking about).  When I unplugged it, the mic stopped working in exactly two applications that I'm aware of: skype and google hangouts.  Bizarrely, I can still record audio in audacity, and a windows XP guest that I have running inside virtualbox can also read sound from the microphone just fine.  And I should point out that the mic has worked fine for a year before this.\nI opened up pavucontrol and I can see the 'internal microphone' listed.  It seems to be responding correctly (I can see the volume indicator on the bottom bouncing when I make noise).  However, if I go to ubuntu's settings and look under the 'input' tab of the 'sound' settings, I can see my sound card listed, but the controls (volume/mute) are grayed out, and the 'Input level' indicator does not seem to show any sound.  So somehow the mic signal is being lost in between pulseaudio and unity?

However, the input volume slider is still grayed out in ubuntu's sound settings, and the input level indicator there is still inactive.  This may be a separate issue.

I have two files, which were once identical, but one was rotated using Windows Photo Viewer on Windows. Let's call them the raw image and the rotated image. The logical representation of this image is portrait.\nThe raw image has a width of 5184 and a height of 3456 (as reported by the Image tab in the properties of the file), so it is a landscape image.\nThe rotated image has, obviously, a width of 3456 and a height of 5184, so it is a portrait image.\nNevertheless, when I open any of these two files on Ubuntu, they are displayed in the portrait mode in Image Viewer and I can't wrap my head around why this is happening. How does Image Viewer know which is the logical way of observing this image?\nEDIT: Ubuntu also seems to know where is the up in the picture, since the thumbnails are correctly represented also, against the width and height values.\n\nA: There may be meta information embedded within the image file that gives clues as to the orientation of the image.\nUbuntu's image viewer will soft rotate them automatically depending on this meta data.  Windows Photo Viewer has traditionally ignored this information.\nThis can lead to unexpected results.  One program may obey the orientation and rotate for viewing, while others may not.\nThere is an Exif Orientation attribute that can have 1 of 8 values.  There may be other schemes/meta data representations for image orientation.  Cameras can embed this information at the time of shot.\nTo read this meta data I found Imagemagick useful.  There are other meta data viewers available.  You may be able to display these embedded attributes from within your photo/image viewing program (look for image properties).\nTo view with Imagemagick:\n$ sudo apt-get install imagemagick\n$ identify -verbose /path/to/image.file\n\n\nA: There are some metadata associated with a particular image,which tells the Image Viewer in which orientation your Image should be displayed.\nTo see more go to terminal and type\nless /path/to/your/image.jpg\n\n\nA: Thank you both for your answers, while they are helpful, I found the easiest way to determine why this is happening.\nUsing the default Image Viewer I right-clicked on the image -> Properties -> Details tab -> Expand Image Data group > Orientation. This meta-data tells the viewer and Ubuntu how to view the picture.\nThis is only possible because the camera has an accelerometer that can figure which way is up and saves this as meta-data in the file. Windows Photo Viewer doesn't know how to handle this meta-data and ignores it, thus requiring rotation, which modifies the original data, for proper viewing.\n", "Q: Must manually restart lightdm to have it appear I recently did an Ubuntu command-line install on my work laptop, then install Mate (core) and lightdm.

It is using the following driver:\nath9k\n\nI have tried anything that made sense when googling, including adding the following:\necho \"options ath9k nohwcrypt=1\" > /etc/modprobe.d/ath9k.conf\n\nbut no change. I have installed the full ubuntu gnome desktop to try anything to get it working...when trying via command line before installing desktop, I attempted to get it working via wpa_supplicant, but it would hang after issuing the following:\nwpa_supplicant -iwlp3s0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -Dwext\n\nwhich I guess is a generic wireless driver...ath9k was never listed there, just nl80211. I'm not finding anything on 15.10 and the ath9k issue. Anyone able to help?\nEDIT: I am able to run a temporary ethernet cable to try stuff...it's just...temporary :(\n\nA: Just to update, I re-installed to 14.04 LTS and was able to get it working using wpa-supplicant typical configuration...probably best to stick with LTS on a server anyhoo.\n", "Q: The graphic performance is very low for dell n5010 I am using dell n5010. I installed Ubuntu latest version 15.10. Do we have any graphics driver software to install?\n\nA: Identify the graphics hardware of your DELL Inspiron N5010 model, open a terminal and execute:\nlspci -k | grep -EA2 'VGA|3D'  \n\nWhen the output shows only the integrated intel graphics, suitable drivers are already installed.  \nWhen the output shows AMD graphics additionally you will have to use the open source radeon drivers, which are already installed as well. Unfortunately the proprietary AMD Catalyst drivers (fglrx) currently do not work in Ubuntu 15.10 with kernel 4.2, see Wily Werewolf release notes. You can check and follow the fixing process here : The fglrx driver is not compatible with gcc 5.\nIn case you performed an upgrade from Ubuntu 15.04 with AM drivers installed, remove them.  \nsudo apt-get purge fglrx  \nsudo reboot\n\nIf you performed a fresh (clean) installation of Ubuntu 15.10 - this removal step is not necessary.\nAs far as I know DELL Inspiron N5010 ships either with only intel or with  dedicated AMD graphics.\nWhenever there are special models on some markets that have an NVIDIA graphics card, you can install the proprietary NVIDIA graphics drivers as an alternative to open source nouveau drivers. \n", "Q: How do I restore shutdown button?

Thus I install this font:\nsudo apt-get install fonts-inconsolata\nsudo fc-cache -fv\n\nThen I can see \"Inconsolata\" in \"Character Map\".\n.\nNevertheless, I still got the ugly symbols in the terminal. And I've tried using the system fixed width font (Ubuntu Mono). Those \"?\" symbols were still there. Interestingly, those \"?\" do not appear in Terminator. Since I installed Powerline Powerline Ubuntu, the problem might come from the Powerline fonts.\n,\n.\n\nA: In the terminal emulator profile settings, either check the box Use the system fixed width font (red highlight), or select a font, that is currently installed on your system, through the button underneath (green highlight). Close and re-open the terminal emulator.\n\nI'm not entirely sure, whether this is the (only) reason for the broken font glyphs, but the selection of a non-installed font most likely causes some problem down the road.\n", "Q: \"Documents\" folder is inaccessible after upgrade I have just discovered that I cant open my documents folder.

If that doesn't work try replacing d with f to look for a file if it somehow got compressed. \nIf you are able to find the folder and have restored it to the correct place you should be able to edit your config to show in Nautilus again. \ngedit ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs\n\nAnd add the files you want, eg.\n# \nXDG_DESKTOP_DIR=\"$HOME/Desktop\"\nXDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR=\"$HOME/Downloads\"\nXDG_TEMPLATES_DIR=\"$HOME/Templates\"\nXDG_PUBLICSHARE_DIR=\"$HOME/Public\"\nXDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR=\"$HOME/Documents\"\nXDG_MUSIC_DIR=\"$HOME/Music\"\nXDG_PICTURES_DIR=\"$HOME/Pictures\"\nXDG_VIDEOS_DIR=\"$HOME/Videos\"\n\nThis will place the folder under the Places tab in Nautilus.\n", "Q: Difference between $ and # in Linux environment What is the difference between $ and # signs in Linux environment?

E.g. if I press volume up function key the volume up event is triggered infinitely repeating.\nAnd the weirdest thing of all: How does the acpi event distinguish between those three keys, recognizing that each has its own funcionality (VOLUP, VOLDN, MUTE), altough all three keys have the same code 0x80?\n\nQUESTION\nDo you have any idea on how to handle such problems with acpi events? Is it a problem of the kernel, not recognizing specific notebook drivers? Or are there solutions on the user level that might repair this broken functionality of LaptopSpecialKeys?\n\nA: Actually they are very distinguishable, your script will receive the whole line as argument. Example:\nbutton/volumeup VOLUP 00000080 00000000 K\n\nYou got 5 arguments and you are free how to process them.\nMaybe the easiest way:\nevent=button/*\naction=/etc/acpi/yourscript.sh %e\n\nThen in your script used the 3rd argument $3 that will either VOLUP, VOLDN or MUTE, plus some other buttons (power,...) .\nSee:\n\n\n*\n\n*What code is executed when headphones are disconnected?\n\n*How to pause VLC playback when the headphones are disconnected?\n", "Q: No Plugin in the WordPress Admin end, but in the plugins/ folder I've taken all my debugging-specific plugins from one of my Windows drive, and pasted them into my Ubuntu 14.04, but I cannot see any plugin other than the two default Akismet and Hello Dolly.\nI've checked the Akismet's folder permission, and matched with others.

Since the update my (wired) Ethernet connection no longer works under Ubuntu although it still works fine under windows.\nThe Ubuntu network manager keeps trying to establish a wired connection but after a while it just reports: disconnected - you're now offline.\nI noticed that a new network driver was installed during the windows update (see windows device properties). Could this have something to do with the problem I'm facing in Ubuntu?\nIn a fruitless attempt to solve my problem I installed the latest Intel networking driver for Linux, but this didn't solve anything. I suppose that the linux network driver update explains the \"module verification failed: signature and/or  required key missing - tainting kernel\" line in the output of dmesg. The line wasn't there before I updated the Intel e1000e driver (original version was 2.3.2-k).\nI've read a few posts regarding troubleshooting network problems and collected the output of a couple of terminal commands but my knowledge of Linux and networking is to limited to figure out the problem on my own ...\nAny help would greatly be appreciated.\nme@desktop:~$ sudo lspci -v\n00:19.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation Ethernet Connection I217-V (rev 04)\n    Subsystem: ASUSTeK Computer Inc.

Ubuntu afterwards the network connection worked again.\nWhether updating the linux network driver was part of the solution or not is not clear to me, I literally have no clue what the problem was and what fixed it.\nAll I know is that it works again; case closed.\nUpdate 2015-12-06: the problem still isn't solved, network connection in ubuntu only works when I shut down windows normally (with fast boot enabled). When windows shuts down without fast boot (SHIFT + shutdown or in case of a windows restart), the network connection in ubuntu doesn't work. I find this really strange and annoying but at least I have a workaround (boot to windows and shut it down with fast boot enabled).\n\nA: you are correct ... I have the exact same issue ... windows update 1511 causes windows to not release the nic during the shutdown process ... so any for of restart or and form of shutdown without fast start enabled and windows will not complete the shutdown process thus \"locking the nic to windows\" and therefore not making it function without windows ... just another microsoft control mechanism and further proof they will not let you use the hardware you own ... but it gets better ... I decided to wipe my drive and completely get rid of windows ... however since I had disabled the fast start according to the instruction when I loaded my linux the nic would still not work even after the comp0lete wipe (using gparted) and reload ... so I unfortunately wound up reloading windows 10 in order to get the card released so that I could wipe the hdd and reload my choice of linux ... and per my research over the last month microsoft claims there is nothing wrong with the update 1511 and therefore has no intention of fixing it\n", "Q: Problems copying music to Rhythmbox from ipod I recently installed Ubuntu 14.04 and am working to setup Rhythmbox 3.0.2.  I plugged in my ipod nano and the device was properly detected and the music in the device appeared.  I then selected all the music from the device and attempted to copy it into my Music Library.\nThe ipod contains 908 songs (7.5 GB) and Rhythmbox reported it would take 2 days and 22 hours 40 Minutes, so I decided to let it run overnight.\nThe next morning I checked my music folder using Files and it contains 1,093 items (7.5 GB data).  The laptop may have suspended during the night due to a lack of activity (I since disabled suspending), but it looks like all the music was copied over from the device.\nHowever, none of the music appears on the main screen when I click on the Music Library.  There's no progress indicator so I'm not sure if Rhythmbox is still processing the files.  The bottom of the screen still shows 2 days, 22 hours, 40 minutes (no countdown).  If I click play, Rhythmbox is able to play songs from the first folder located under the Music directory.\nIs there a way to determine whether or not Rhythmbox is still processing the files?  Is there something I should select to refresh Rhythbox so it recognizes the newly imported songs.  What should I do to allow the music copied over from the device to appear on the screen when I select the Music Library?\n\nA: I'm not an expert Rhythmbox user by any means, but when I set up all music on an external server, I selected \"Import\" in Rhythmbox and pointed to the server in the \"Select a location containing music to add to your library\" box.  That worked fine.\nHowever, since you mention actually copying the music using Rhythmbox, your use case may be different, since I don't know how to do that.  I only pointed to previously stored music.\n", "Q: How do I get a wireless logitech unifying USB keyboard to wake Ubuntu from suspend?

Regardless of the configuration of the system, when the system is asleep, no software is running. Wakeups have to be triggered by hardware interrupt (wired keyboard, wired mouse, wired LAN). Your wireless keyboard cannot provide the needed hardware signal. The wireless keyboard is \"connected\" to your computer by a method that requires the computer to be \"UP\" (powered on, not asleep) to communicate.\n", "Q: Cannot change screen resolution for 14.04.3 in Virtual box Have tried to change the resolution the following command: sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-utils virtualbox-guest-x11 virtualbox-guest-dkms.\nBut it did not work.

This Stack Overflow answer suggests that older Android versions require the Oracle JDK to build. Reading between the lines of the “Installing the JDK” section of the official Android source documentation suggests the same: “To develop older versions of Android, download and install the corresponding version of the Java JDK” – note the link to the Oracle website at the end … that could have been made clearer.\nSo, in essence you should get the Oracle JDK and make sure that your build uses that instead of the OpenJDK you currently use. This other Stack Overflow answer explains a way to do this:\n\n1.) If you’ve already installed OpenJDK . Remove it by running this command:\n  sudo apt-get purge openjdk*\n2.)

I don't  want to upgrade my kernel to the one with Xbox One support, in fear that it'll break my Nvidia driver. Are there any other options to get the controller working?\n\nA: Yes. \nBuild your own kernel, starting with your current version. Then step through each source change between that version and the version with Xbox support. Apply it or not, depending on your decision as to the change's contribution to \"Xbox support\" or \"breaks Nvidia\". Be sure to test frequently.\nThis is probably more work than you want to do.\n\nA: The XboxOne driver is in drivers/input/joystick/xpad.c, you should be able to copy that out of a newer kernel into an older kernel and compile or compile the module on it's own.\n", "Q: How to uninstall zenmap? How can I remove zenmap that I installed using this method:\nbzip2 -cd nmap-7.00.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -\ncd nmap-7.00\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\n\nA: Running make uninstall may work. It's up to the library's authors to provide that. Most libraries usually have one.\nOtherwise, you'll have to manually uninstall it. Running make -n install will show the steps that the software would take to install itself. You can then try to manually reverse those steps.\nPS: In the future to avoid this type of problems try to use checkinstall instead of make install whenever possible.

I currently have Windows 10 installed and want to install Ubuntu as well (as dual-boot), so I shrinked one of the partitions of my hard-drive, downloaded Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS from the Ubuntu-Website and burned the ISO on a DVD (using the Windows 10 tool via the context-menu → burn). Then I rebooted the computer, but it booted Windows again. So I restarted again and entered the ASUS UEFI BIOS utility.

I have been using the same login password since I set up the encrypted home drive a few months back with no issues. /var/log/syslog is showing that it is an Incorrect wrapping key for my wrapped passphrase. I figure this means that my wrap-passphrase file is corrupted and is no longer valid. I have my mount passphrase password from when I encrypted the home drive. \nI booted from LiveCD and executed the following process:\nroot@ubuntu:/media/backup/home/me# ecryptfs-recover-private \nINFO: Searching for encrypted private directories (this might take a while)...\nINFO: Found [/media/backup/home/.ecryptfs/me/.Private].\nTry to recover this directory? [Y/n]: Y\nINFO: Found your wrapped-passphrase\nDo you know your LOGIN passphrase? [Y/n] n\nINFO: To recover this directory, you MUST have your original MOUNT passphrase.\nINFO: When you first setup your encrypted private directory, you were told to record\nINFO: your MOUNT passphrase.\nINFO: It should be 32 characters long, consisting of [0-9] and [a-f].\n\nEnter your MOUNT passphrase: \nINFO: Success!  Private data mounted read-only at [/tmp/ecryptfs.COf2NZVr].\n\nHowever, when I cd to the tmp folder (i.e. cd /tmp/ecryptfs.COf2NZVr), all I see are encrypted files (ECRYPTFS_FNEK_ENCRYPTED.F...). Based on the question/answer located under ecryptfs-recover-private creating unreadable encrypted folders, it appears they fixed this issue with using the login passphrase. However, as I already pointed out, my login passphrase is not working.\nSince the mounted Passphrase is partially working (it allows me to mount up in /tmp the files successfully) is there anything else I can do to get these files unencrypted? Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: Karl,\nI did go back and look at syslog a little more carefully. I was taking it at face value that when ecryptfs-recover-private actually came back and stated it mounted successfully, that it actually did mount and unencrypt. While it is true that it mounted the directory, it was not unencrypted. Once I understood this, I checked my password a realized I was leaving off the last two characters and only putting in 30 instead of the 32. Once I added this, my directory was mounted and the files are unencrypted. Thanks for making me get in there and take a closer look!\nI think that the ecryptfs-recover-pivate command should state if it does not unencrypt even if it does mount successfully.\nThanks,\nGreg\n", "Q: Unable to update in Ubuntu 15.10 I'm unable to run sudo apt-get update successfully for the past few days now.\nWhen running sudo apt-get update from terminal, it shows error as,\nW: Failed to fetch http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/wily/InRelease  Unable to find expected entry 'main/binary-i386cddcd/Packages' in Release file (Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file)\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/wily-updates/InRelease  Unable to find expected entry 'main/binary-i386cddcd/Packages' in Release file (Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file)\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/wily-security/InRelease  Unable to find expected entry 'main/binary-i386cddcd/Packages' in Release file (Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file)\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/dists/wily/InRelease  Unable to find expected entry 'partner/binary-i386cddcd/Packages' in Release file (Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file)\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://archive.canonical.com/dists/wily/InRelease  Unable to find expected entry 'partner/binary-i386cddcd/Packages' in Release file (Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file)\n\nE: Some index files failed to download.

From the 12.04 machine I can't see any machines on the network from Remote Desktop Viewer so I can't even try to connect.\nAny ideas how to start debugging this?\n\nA: I've since moved on to a slightly different set up, but I believe I found the source of my problem, which turns out to be quite simple:  The firewall on my host machine was set up to block almost all connections.  \nOn the host machine I could see that the firewall was active by typing\nsudo ufw status\n\nTo allow the remote desktop connection, I ran\nsudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.[client] to 192.168.1.[host] port 5900\n\nThen everything worked as advertised.\n", "Q: How to remove the scroll limit fade (edge-overshot effect)? When scrolling in any list of files or some other apps, when the bottom or top is reached, ubuntu displays some kind of \"fade\" effect like with scrolling in android noting the limit.\nHow can this effect be disabled?\nThis effect was not displayed before Ubuntu 15.10.\n\nA: This is not a feature of Ubuntu, or Gnome, it's the underlying GTK3 effect triggered by the edge-overshot event https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkScrolledWindow.html#GtkScrolledWindow-edge-overshot.\nIf the effect does not look good with your theme or you find it annoying, then you will need to edit the overshoot CSS class in the GTK+ theme. (If it messes up the display then it is a bug in the theme and should be reported to the theme author).\nTo disable the overshoot effect you can manually edit the GTK+ theme to tweak the CSS rule.\n\n\n*\n\n*Find out the current GTK+ theme in use. As I have a custom theme, the standard System Settings did not show the correct theme name. To see the correct GTK+ theme I used Gnome Tweak Tool, installable with:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool \n\n\n*In Gnome Tweak Tool Under Appearance you will see the current GTK+ theme, for example MBuntu-Y. The corresponding theme folder will be located under /usr/share/themes/MBuntu-Y. Now make a copy of the original theme (a better option would be to create a copy of the original theme in your ~/themes folder):\nsudo cp -r /usr/share/themes/MBuntu-Y /usr/share/themes/MBuntu-Y-original\n\n\n*Next edit the CSS file:\nsudo gedit /usr/share/themes/MBuntu-Y/gtk-3.0/gtk-widgets.css\n\n\n*Search for overshoot in the file, and edit the corresponding rule to read like below:\n    .overshoot { background: transparent; border:none; }\n\nOnce you have saved the file you might need to relogin to see the changes.\n", "Q: Lost most of the basic drivers on Ubuntu Due to some Wifi connection issues, I followed an article for some troubleshooting, and without reading carefully -my bad- I ended up with a command (that I don't even remember) that deleted almost all important drivers on Ubuntu (including display, network, multimedia and some others). \nNow I have no internet connection, and I want to restore all the drivers. I only have another laptop with internet connection and I have a usb, so what I am doing is that I install a package from here and I copy the package to the broken machine and install it from the Ubuntu software center. The problem is that the installation never completes and gives an error due to uninstalled dependencies. And each package has a long list of dependencies.  \nSo my question is: is there any other way to restore the lost drivers? or if there is a way to have the package with its dependencies all together in one file.\n\nA: I suggest you do:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-image `uname -r`\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-image-extra-`uname -r`\n\nYour drivers, etc. should be restored to default.\n", "Q: How to get rid of grub when deleted partition I had Linux installed but decided I didn't want it. So I deleted the partition that contained Linux in Windows 10. And when I turn my pc on it comes to the grub command line. I am trying to figure out how to boot from usb so I can fix it in Windows 10. Please help. Thanks.\n\nA: Pro way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into a Windows repair disk or Windows installer disk (your flash drive will do, you just need to make it bootable. I suggest using the Media Creation Tool)\n\n*Once you're booted, you should see a window. If not, proceed to step 3. Configure keyboard and language.\n\n*It should prompt you to install Windows (Install Now button). Instead of proceeding, you should see \"Repair computer\" or something on the lower left corner of the window.\n\n*You should see a menu. Go to command prompt (Troubleshoot -> Advanced options -> Command prompt).\n\n*Run bootrec /fixmbr\n\n*Reboot. If it doesn't, leave a comment.\n\nLazy way (Recommended):\n\n\n*\n\n*Follow steps 1 to 3 above.\n\n*Go to Troubleshoot -> Advanced options -> Startup repair\n\n*Let it do its thing while you cross your fingers.\n", "Q: Will run Ubuntu only over terminal increase my computer performace? I have this software that I need to run for a project I'm working on but it uses all my CPU and will take 10 days to finish. I want it to run faster so I can finish this earlier. My computer is already being used only for that but still not enough. I was planing to load Ubuntu only into bash shell so that the software will load faster since the computer doesn't have to load any GUI, my question is, will that really help or I won't get much more computing power using this?\n\nA: For most use cases it will not provide any noticeable improvement to run without the GUI. This is because most desktop computers are idle most of the time and the available system resources for running large jobs greatly exceed the amount you will use when you are at the computer. Even if you renice the process to a lower priority than all your interactive processes (e.g. renice +10 <pid>) the time savings will be minimal. That said, here are some cases where you might notice a difference:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your system has little memory relative to the processes you are running on it. This could cause active parts of your long running job to get paged to disk. If it is on disk then it can not be running on the CPU. A little bit of paging is not going to appreciably change the execution time of your long running job since the active part of the job will likely remain in memory but a lot of paging will slow everything down.\n\n*You run processes in your GUI that use appreciable amounts of CPU and your background job is capable of having used those CPU resources. This is a complicated condition and typical desktop applications don't use significant amounts of CPU for extended periods of time. Most relevant here is that most modern CPUs are multi-core. If your job can't use 100% of all cores on your system then you have at least some cores always available for use by other processes.\n\n\nA: Actually, yeah. The GUI does consume resources that are most probably unnecessary in your case. \n", "Q: Accidentally deleted efi partition So, I really screwed things up... Long story short, I deleted my windows 8.1 efi partition and now cannot boot into windows. Furthermore, I don't even have an efi partition left to create a linux install with (which it seems to need so it can put the linux bootloader somewhere). \nAll I can use on my laptop is the live ubuntu cd. Furthermore, gparted crashes every time I open it giving a very obscure error \"Assertion (last_usable <= disk->dev->length) at ../../../libparted/labels/gpt.c:994 in function _parse_header() failed.\" I'm not even sure my computer can boot off efi anymore as I switched it to legacy mode in the bios menu and haven't been able to get back to it. \nI tried using a windows 10 live cd and repairing installing there, but the installer didn't like any of the current existing partitions. For most of them it said there were GPT formatted, and it can't use that.\nWhere do I even begin to fix this? Is there some way I can create an efi partition from the linux live cd?

This is a curious question only.\nDoes anybody know if other distributions need sudo to login as root. \nThe reason I am asking is because I have Virtualbox installed in my ubuntu desktop and I have several other distros.\n\nA: No, sudo is not Ubuntu specific command/package.\nBy default, many distros come with sudo package preinstalled, if not it should be available in the repository so that the user can install it later easily.\n\nA: Nope. Centos, Debian, and almost every other distro you know has sudo. Some doesn't have sudo but has su (e.g. Android). Not sure about Arch Linux. I remember downloading sudo manually.\nRefer to this answer for a bit more detail. It basically says that distros made after mid-2000s will most probably have sudo.\n\nA: sudo comes with a lot of distributions, however there are exceptions to the rule. Typically, very minimalistic distros such as Arch Linux come only with root login. Digital Ocean server for me came with root account only, but sudo was there for other users. If it's not there, check for su and pkexec with which <command-name>. These two commands are an alternative to sudo and gksu, and often pkexec is preferred over sudo \n", "Q: How to install VM VirtualBox on 14.04 without errors?

I just want to do all my coding stuff at one place. So I am interested to make my Gedit a universal IDE. It should support at least C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript and Markup Language.\n\nA: Imho GEdit is far from being an ideal base for an IDE. You would be better off with an actual IDE like Eclipse and its various plug-ins.\nIn my experience it's also better to use IDEs specialized to a particular language, task set, or framework like JetBrains' IDEA (Java), PyCharm (Python), WebStorm (JavaScript, non-free), and CLion (C/C++, non-free) – they all have very similar user interfaces in case you're worried about that. Qt Creator is an excellent fully open-source alternative for C/C++/QML development.\nIf you really want to start with a text editor as a base and enhance it with developer features go with something highly customizable like Atom, Sublime Text, or Emacs and their various plug-ins and extensions. While GEdit is very customizable itself the existing supply of useful, up-to-date plug-ins is far smaller than for the other three.\n\nA: gedit supports syntax highlighting for all these languages out of the box, and will usually auto-detect the syntax mode when each file is opened.\nIf you want to make it feel more like a heavyweight editor, turn on the side panel (view->side panel), set it to file browser mode, and use this to switch between the files in your project directory.\nIf you go to the preferences dialog, a lot of the syntax and indentation options are in there.\nThere's also an external tools plugin that you can enable for functionality like building from a makefile within the editor environment. I can't vouch for how useful this functionality is; I prefer to build from a separate terminal window so I wouldn't personally want to invest time into setting up that level of integration - but that's my own preference.\nWhile it's true that gedit doesn't have as many plugins as editors like Visual Studio Code and Atom, it's still a fast and solid editor (the two I just mentioned have some wonderful features if you invest the time in customising them, but they've also let me down a few times in terms of startup performance, unwanted distractions, and even just maintaining file integrity when running in multiple windows; to the point that I no longer trust them as basic editors.) and a good fraction of the fundamentals are there. I would certainly recommend gedit as an entry-level code editor; at least until you develop a feel for what kinds of other functionality you're after.\n\nA: You can tweak some thing in gedit to make \"programmer friendly\" by going to preferences, then in the \"view\" tab you can enable: \n - Display line numbers\n - Display status bar\n - Highlight Current line\n - Highlight matching brackets\nThen, in the \"Plugins\" tab you can select the plugins that you need.\nAlso, when you go back to the editor you will notice that there's a text in the bottom of the screen that says \"Plain Text\", click it and you will be able to change the language that you are working on.\nYou can compile your code using the terminal, there are several tutorials on the internet of how to do this, every language is diferent.\nFor example, for python you can just type:\npython <filename.py>\n\nFor java you must type:\njavac <filename.java>\n\nand then...\njava <filename>\n\nHope my explanation can be useful for you, Good luck!\n", "Q: Python Pip install LDTP fails I'm on Ubuntu Vivid (15.04) and I have installed Python 2.7 (default) and Python 3.4.\nNow, why does pip install ldtp fails to install (fails to create temporary directory /tmp/pip-build-6j6vgvsb/ldtp)?\nHowever, I ran pip install libxml2dom ==> successfully installed package!

Yesterday I did a fresh install of Ubuntu 15.10, got same problem, which is:\nIf I try to go to standby, or shutdown or restart the laptop, then it goes to a black screen and then the fan comes on every 15 seconds or so. This will continue until the battery runs out!  The screen occasionally freezes as well and the fan will start to run every 15 secs then as well. At that point I have to force a restart.\nI'm only a beginner on Linux and can't follow the more complex instructions. beyond 'copy and paste' into terminal.I have checked the forums and I think it's a problem with the graphics card, but don't know what to do. Can anyone help, is this a problem with the hardware? \n\nA: This appears to be a problem related to the dw_dmac module. If you open the terminal and enter:\nsudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nThen add the line\nblacklist dw_dmac\n\nThis may or may not work for you.\nIf you want to be sure, install Ubuntu 12.04.

Possibly a newer kernel (16.04+) could ultimately solve this?\n", "Q: Shell with better editing capabilities Shells (at least what I know) have really bad command editing capabilities.\nFor example: \n\n\n*\n\n*I can't point the cursor to any point of the command.\n\n*I can't select and backspace/delete/replace text in the command.\n\n\nCurrently these are so distracting, I use gedit to edit commands before pasting them to the terminal.\nIs there any solution that's good for these?\n\nA: You can edit an empty or partially typed command into the editor of your choice by setting EDITOR to the editor of your choice and by hitting CTRL+X+E or CTRL+X/CTRL+E, which open the currently being edited line in EDITOR;\nFor example, setting EDITOR to gedit will make CTRL+X+E and CTRL+X/CTRL+E open the current line in Gedit.\nTo make this a permanent solution, you can set EDITOR in ~/.bashrc.\nThis allows to use even a fully-fleged graphical text editor to edit the command; to run the edited command, simply save and close the document.\n\nThe same feature can be enabled in Zsh by adding the following to ~/.zshrc:\nautoload -U edit-command-line\nzle -N edit-command-line\nbindkey '^xe' edit-command-line\nbindkey '^x^e' edit-command-line\n\n\nA: Terminals have no text editing abilities themselves.  Terminals provide an area of text and connect the keyboard to something.  But the something that you run inside the terminal determines what it can do.\nShells such as bash are typically the first thing that you will find to run inside of a terminal.  Because shells work based on commands you are only able to edit the current command.  bash provides excellent command editing compared to the Bourne shell or csh or ksh yet it is hardly something you would want to edit even a short story with.\nText editors are one of the commands you can invoke in the shell.  The leading examples are vim and emacs.  vim or emacs will give you the ability to edit almost anything.  Both include built-in programming environments for extending their abilities to whatever problem you face.\nSo the solution is to understand better what these tools are doing and meant to do and pick the right one for the job.\n\nA: Bash is actually quite good at this. You just need to learn its shortcuts. For example (in the default emacs mode):\n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl + A : move to the beginning of the line.\n\n*Ctrl + E : move to the end of the line. \n\n*Ctrl + B : move one character backwards.\n\n*Ctrl + F : move one character forwards.\n\n*Alt + B : move one word backwards.\n\n*Alt + F : move one word forwards.\n\n*Ctrl + K : delete (cut) everything until the end of the line.\n\n*Alt + D : delete (cut) the word after the cursor.\n\n*Ctrl + W : delete (cut) the word before the cursor.\n\n*Ctrl + Y : yank (paste) what is in the buffer (what you cut with Ctrl+K or Alt + D for example)\n\n\nAnd there are many more. Read man readline to see what else is available. You can assign different shortcuts by placing them in ~/.inputrc. For example, to make Ctrl + Left go back one word and Ctrl + Right go forward one word, add this to your ~/.inputrc:\n\"\\e[1;5D\": backward-word \n\"\\e[1;5C\": forward-word\n\nTo find out what those strange codes mean, press Ctrl + V and then press the key you would like to use. If you try with Ctrl + Right, you will see ^[[1;5C. Replace ^[ with \\e in ~/.inputrc.\n\nYou might also want to look into other shells. Popular \"modern\", feature-rich shells include: \n\n\n*\n\n*zsh  \n\n*fish\n\n*ksh\n\nA: Usually terminals allow text selection with the mouse, but the shell is not made aware of this.  So unfortunately neither bash, zsh, fish nor es can support mouse-based editing.  I think to do so, they would need to take greater control over the terminal.\nHowever (and this is a bit of a stretch) if you open Vim or GVim, and then enter shell commands using:\n:!...\n\nthen you can click your mouse to jump to anywhere in the line.  (You will need to :set mouse=a first if that is not already enabled.)  The editing keys in this mode can be seen with :help cmdline-editing\nVim also has quite a powerful command history mode, which can be reached by hitting q:.  From there you can yank, delete and paste using Vim's normal-mode commands.  In this mode, you can get the select-with-mouse and then delete feature you desire (by hitting d).\nA significant caveat here is that Vim does not actually keep a live shell session running.  Each command you execute will be run in a child process.  So any changes made to environment variables or shell options by the child process will be lost.\nThat said, you can modify environment variables from within the Vim process, and use these from Vim's command line, and they will even be exported to child processes:\n:let $FOO=\"bar\"        \" the $ and the quotes are mandatory here\n\n:echo $FOO             \" Vim's own echo command\nbar\n\n:!echo \"$FOO\"          \" Passing the variable to a shell command\nbar\n\n:!bash                 \" Opening a child shell\n$ echo \"$FOO\"\nbar\n\nSo if you are willing to pretend that Vim is actually some kind of weird shell, then you can enjoy its advanced editing features!  Probably the biggest drawback is that you will have to start every command by typing either :! or q:\nOh and by the way, if you want to get the output of the shell command into your current Vim buffer, you can do that like this (but beware it will clobber your current line):\n:,!ls\n\n", "Q: can not write to hard drive permitions set to root, EMERGENCY!

How can I solve this problem?\nOne solution to this problem is to use \nssh -X user2 program1\n\nBut I am interested if it is also possible with sudo.\n\nA: *\n\n*You could just login as the other user (login in a terminal is fine), thus decrypting their home, and run programs successfully. Apparently your ssh -X idea should do that, but doesn't appear necessary for a local user.\n\n*Tell the program you're trying to run (program1 in your example) to use a different folder, one that's currently mounted / writeable. How to do that would vary according to each program. Maybe using a \"dummy\" home folder might work, a temporary link, etc.\n\n*Manually decrypt / mount the other user's home.

So let's give g++ a couple of more parameters.\ng++ -I/usr/local/include/cairo/ -L/usr/local/lib -o screenshot screenshot.cpp -lcairo\n\n-lcairo tells the linker to search for a library called cairo and -L/usr/local/lib gives the linker an extra directory to search from.\nNote that the parameter order matters with -l -- it should be placed after the source or object files.[1] (In this case, after screenshot.cpp)\nThis should be enough for compiling your binary.\n\npkg-config is a tool for automating these things. It gives you the command-line parameters necessary to compile a program using a specific library. I think it often overshoots and ends up linking against multiple libraries that aren't actually needed. The manual way is better in that matter.\n\n[1] Or so I think.

It turns out g++ was there but was a broken symbolic link. You can check if this is your case by doing: \nls /usr/bin | grep g++\n\nand if it exists, its probably a broken link, so just do sudo rm /usr/bin/g++ and then create a new symlink:\nsudo ln -s g++-7 /usr/bin/g++\n\n(This assumes g++-7 exists, or some other version of it)\n\nA: You have done the right thing to install g++, so we need to investigate why it still isn't working.  Here are some things to try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try installing it again: sudo apt-get install g++.  You should get the message g++ is already the newest version.  If not, what message do you get?  Do you get any error messages?\n\n*Find out what is where g++ should live.  Type ls -l /usr/bin/g++.  You should find a simlink to the actual binary:\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 Apr  7  2014 /usr/bin/g++ -> g++-4.8\n\nSometimes things can go wrong here if /usr/bin/g++ points to somewhere in /etc/alternatives, but the /etc/alternatives link points to the wrong place.\n\n*Ask back here.  When you ask back here, including the output of commands such as lsb_release -a, uname -a, command -v g++, and  apt-cache policy g++ would be very helpful, as recommended by @A.B.  In fact, if you ask back here, it's best to do so by editing your question above rather than by asking a new question.\n\nA: If you already have multiple versions of g++ they will be called with the version number on the end.

I am using ubuntu 13.04 and GParted 0.12.1.\n\nA: The key you see means that the partition is mounted.\nUnmounting a running Ubuntu system is not possible.  \nBoot from the Ubuntu installation Live media.\nOpen GParted - no partition will be mounted.  \nIn case you mounted a partition intentionally,\nRight-click the partition and select Unmount.\nNow you can work on the selected partition.  \nBy the way, Ubuntu 13.04 isn't supported anymore.\nYou should use Ubuntu 14.04 LTS or 15.10 instead !\n", "Q: Qt apps stopped inheriting GTK themes After a fresh installation of Ubuntu Gnome 15.10, Qt apps like qpdfview or QuiteRSS suddenly stopped inheriting the global GTK theme, in my case Numix. The same is also true for the default Adwaita theme, so most likely it's not the theme's fault. It seems, that these apps always use the Cleanlooks Qt theme, regardless of the present GTK theme.\nI've never had any problems with theming on previous installations of Ubuntu Gnome.\nInstalling qt4-qtconfig and playing with different settings (GUI style: default, cleanlooks or gtk+) didn't have any effect on these apps.\nCuriously, the qt4-qtconfig app itself is themed properly. So after selecting a different theme, e.g. \"desktop settings (default)\" or \"windows\", the theme of this app changes, but not in qpdfview or QuiteRSS. The trick with installing libgnomeui-0 (mentioned here) didn't help either.\nDoes anyone experience the same and know of a workaround?\n\nA: On Ubuntu 17.10 Qt4 apps do inherit the global GTK theme, while Qt5 don't. Since libqt5libqgtk2 isn't available in the official Ubuntu repositories anymore, we have to use another workaround:\nInstall qt5-style-plugins from the Ubuntu repositories with sudo apt install qt5-style-plugins.\nThen add export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=gtk2 to ~/.profile by echo \"export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=gtk2\" >> ~/.profile. This will theme all apps started as user.\nIf you prefer to apply the theming system-wide (for user and root apps), then use sudo sh -c \"echo 'export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=gtk2' >> /etc/environment\".\nFor Ubuntu 20.04 – 20.10 you have to sudo apt install appmenu-gtk2-module, so that qt apps don't start with a delay. In Ubuntu 21.04 you don't have to install appmenu-gtk2-module any more.\nI prefer this method over using kvantum, because with this method also root apps are themed properly and you don't have to adjust the theme in the kvantum manager, to match it your gtk theme.\nReboot and enjoy!\n", "Q: Installing newer driver to current kernel I have problems with my notebook's wifi (Intel Corporation Wireless 7265 (rev 59) on Ubuntu 14.04 (3.13.0-68-generic).

Thanks for any help and if you need more information please comment on this question and don't be a dick.\nUpdates\n\n\n*\n\n*2015-12-14 | Removed some of the routers listed in the script above + fixed the problem! \n\n*2015-12-12 | Did a git pull as suggested in github issue. Also no effect since the only changes made were to the rtl8723be and not rtl8723ae driver.\n\n*2015-12-12 | Put laptop really close to the router had no effect\n\n*2015-12-08 | updated the wireless script without the usb wifi attached.\n\n*2015-12-08 | Replied to a similair question on github: https://github.com/lwfinger/rtlwifi_new/issues/34\n\n*2015-12-08 | ndiswrapper is not the culprit - updated the wireless script with the usb wifi attached.\n\n*2015-12-08 | Will try the answer for ndiswrapper tonight.\n\n*2015-12-08 | Also tried the rock and troy branches from the lwfinger github repo.

I checked the /etc/default/grub and /boot/grub2/grub configuration and everything seem okay. But still I cannot boot the new kernel.\nI tried to get into boot menu to select the booting kernel but I was not able to get to it. I tried pressing SHIFT and ESC and still the boots with the old kernel. Any help with be very very appreciated. \n\nA: First boot with the old kernel. Open a terminal.\nMake sure your system is updated by running:\nsudo su; apt-get update; apt-get upgrade\n\nIf you are sure you have the newer kernel, run\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\nTo create a new initramfs image.\nNow update GRUB with the command\nsudo update-grub\n\nGRUB should have recognized the newer kernel now. Reboot and you should automatically use it. Just to make sure, run uname -a to see information about the system and the kernel.\n", "Q: How can I undo the failed installation due to space limitation? Last week while I was installing the texlive-full in the Ubuntu system in VMWare I found that it took too much time, and then I went back home left it installing. But when I came back, something weird appeared:\n1. Many Vim plugins yelled at me.\n2. After rebooting, I got stuck with a totally black screen.\n3. My Genome was gone. I can only interact with the OS via command line after hitting Ctrl+Alt+F1.\n4. Since I got to know that I need extend the disk space for the Virtual machine, I attempted to get it done by following this awesome tutorial, but got stuck again when trying this command pvcreate /dev/sda3. The system told me that it had not been installed. But when I run sudo apt-get install lvm2, it reminded me that I should run sudo apt-get -f install with no parameters instead first.\n5. But I saw that the failed texlive-full was being installing, and again it failed because of the limited space issue.\n6. Then I deleted about 1.5G of files. I checked it by running df -h after sudo apt-get clean. But when I run the command I run in the 4th step, the error saying E: Write error - Write (28: No space left on device) E: The package lists or status file could not be parsed or opened. reoccured.   \nThen my question is that what I can do to undo the interrupted installation of texlive-full? It seems that it has not been automatically undoed after the failure. I don't want, and it seems that I need not, to delete more files for more space.    \n\nA: I have tackled the problem by four steps: 0) delete some files and complte the installation and then remove the software; 1) Set the VMware to extend the storage; 2) create a new filesystem and mount it to the root one; 3) install the latex by setting the installing directory. \n#   TEXLIVE_INSTALL_PREFIX         /usr/local/texlive   => $tex_prefix\n\nAccording the the above line in the install_tl file and the explanation in the documentation I get to know that I should change the value of the variable tex_prefix only. \nReference\nhttp://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html\n", "Q: xfce launcher problems with java programs I'm having a bit of strangeness with all forms of the launcher (desktop and panel) when it comes to java programs. I add for example IntelliJ Idea from the whisker menu to a panel and it has the following command:\n\"/home/xxx/local/idea-IC-143.381.42/bin/idea.sh\" %f\nI can take this command and execute it in a terminal and it works fine. But when I press the launcher button a window never shows up. I can see a process that is running that does hog some resources.\nI did the same thing with SQLWorkbench (with a manually created) desktop launcher with the following as the command:\n/home/dave/local/sqlworkbench/sqlworkbench.sh\nIn this case when I start it an upstart process starts that hogs around 99% CPU.\nAll other launchers are working. I'm pretty sure the above were working too but am not 100% sure (as the install is less than a month old).\nI'm on 15.10 and installed all updates (including some prompted ones today).\nAny one having this and has a fix?\n\nA: It will be because the startup scripts are looking for a JDK_HOME environment variable, and none is present.\nYou can edit the startup scripts to set the JDK_HOME at the start of the scripts, or edit the /etc/profile file to set it (then log out and log in).\n", "Q: Extract a few names from a File So, my Problem is that I have a file with a lot of names in it, and I want to extract Information by using a command.

Run the following in a terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mystic-mirage/pycharm\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen you can install PyCharm:\nsudo apt-get install pycharm\n\n\nA: \nNote: I consider most of this answer's content to be outdated. Please see my other answer here for a more up to date collection of ways to install PyCharm.\nThe original answer was:\n\nPyCharm is not in the official repositories.\nYou have multiple options to install it though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable the GetDeb repository and install PyCharm from there:\nRun these three commands to set up the GetDeb repository as a software source for your system:\necho 'deb http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu wily-getdeb apps' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/getdeb.list\nwget -q -O- http://archive.getdeb.net/getdeb-archive.key | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen you can install PyCharm Community Edition (version 5.0.1 at the date of writing):\nsudo apt-get install pycharm\n\nYou will automatically receive package updates through GetDeb, no need to update PyCharm manually or with its own updater.\n\n*Enable a PPA and install PyCharm from there:\nPlease see this answer of Luís de Sousa for a PPA option.\nYou will also receive automatic package updates through the PPA, as soon as its owner uploads a new version (which is not as reliable and fast as GetDeb usually...)\n\n*Download the compressed archive from the official JetBrains site:\nOn the official homepage of JetBrains, the developing company of PyCharm, there is a download section offering both the free Community Edition and a 30-day-trial-version of the Professional Edition, both for Windows, OS X and Linux.\nDirect download link for the  latest PyCharm version (free Community Edition) for Linux.  \nThe official installation instructions for Linux are those:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Copy the pycharm-*.tar.gz to an empty directory (make sure you have rw permissions for that directory)\n  \n*Unpack the pycharm-*.tar.gz using the following command: \ntar xfz pycharm-*.tar.gz\n\n  \n*Remove the pycharm-*.tar.gz to save disk space (optional)\n  \n*Run pycharm.sh from the bin subdirectory  \n  \n  \n  NOTE: PyCharm on Linux doesn't need special installation or running any installation script. It runs out of the pycharm-*.tar.gz\n\nYou don't get any automatic package updates this way, but will rely in PyCharms internal update mechanism. \nMy personal favourite is GetDeb, but you may chose which one you prefer.\n", "Q: PATH variable for newly installed executable files I am installing a series of programs for bioinformatics purposes; I am installing the folders of these packages in /usr/local/lib/ and creating soft links to the executable files in /usr/bin/ so I am expecting to have them visible in the environment. But when I type the executables in the terminal, the commands are not recognized, so they are not in the environment.\nI also modified the /home/userName/.bashrc with the line:\nexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin/\n\nbut still no luck; for instance for the bowtie2 program, contained in the /usr/local/lib/Bowtie folder, I wrote:\n/usr/local/lib/Bowtie$ bowtie2 --version\nThe program 'bowtie2' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing: \nsudo apt-get install bowtie2\n\nsame thing when I open the terminal in default folder name@userName:~$.\nI have not really clear how to modify this PATH environment; on the help online seems simple, but I can't make it work.\nHow can I modify the environment in a way that the newly added executables could be accessible globally?\n\nA: First of all, when you try to run an executable whose directory you are in, you have to add ./ to the command, for example:\nuser@USER-PC:/usr/local/lib/Bowtie$ ./bowtie2\n\nSo bash (I suppose you're using bash, but many shells will work like this) will look for the executable in the current directory, not in PATH.\nTo add /usr/local/lib/Bowtie to PATH, just edit ~/.bashrc and add export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/lib/Bowtie. This way bash will look for bowtie2 in this directory. \nIf you created a link to bowtie2 inside /usr/bin and bash does not recognize it then probably bowtie2 is not marked as executable. Open a terminal and run:\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/lib/Bowtie/bowtie2 \n\nand see if that solves your problem. \n", "Q: Logs scrolling applet/app Does there exist some panel or desktop applet or X application to show various logs of my system, as they scroll?\nI know I can open multiple terminals and then tail -f all the logfiles I am interested in. But that has to be done either with a special script or manually as well as positioning the terminal windows. Lots of work each time. So I was interested in a more or less complete solution. Rather large panel applets would also be viable with multiple monitors or 4K display. I am using Lubuntu at the moment, but the DE can be any.\n\nA: You could install indicator-script-runner and create a \"script\" which tails the relevant log file.  To run the script, select from the indicator menu and a terminal is launched, executing your script.\nFor each log file you want to tail, create a separate script.\n", "Q: Autostart download How to autostart downloads when ubuntu starts. I know how to autostart torrent clients like transmission or deluge client during startup. But the application only starts, it doesnt start downloading. Please mention any torrent client or download managers that resume downloads automatically when Ubuntu starts, assuming it is connected to internet. If such apps don't exist, please mention some mechanism by which I can accomplish the task.\n\nA: I realized my mistake. I used to stop downloads and close all programs before shutting down.

PCM is also very inefficient, lossless codecs like FLAC provide the same quality. Using libav/ffmpeg you can copy the video and convert the audio stream to FLAC, which should give you working audio playback:\navconv -i $myfile.mov -c:a flac -c:v copy $myfile.mkv\n\nI have seen (L)PCM 24Bit audio on concert Blurays before, audio actually does play but has a very loud signal on top of the actual audio stream – which could be a format parsing error.\nI chose the MKV container as an output format here because it has no format restrictions that I know of and is very extendable, pairing MOV or MP4 with FLAC may not work.\nOne last note, who ever made this file should check if that is really the desired result. 50fps is fine and may indicate that this is PAL or some other non-NTSC content, but 1280x736 is 16 pixels above 720p (1280x720), which may be fine with the codec or encoder but not optimal or even incompatible with typical playback devices.\n\nThe third stream was unexpected (and you didn't say that you pull raw material from what appears to be a camera), we can probably map to just include video and audio in the output and leave out what appears to be time code data.\navconv -i $myfile.mov -map 0:1 -c:v copy -map 0:2 -c:a flac $myfile.mkv\n\nA similar question on SuperUser: ffmpeg stripping out third stream not working and also related How drop an audio stream using avconv?\nIt's probably also relevant to note that we have a site for video production.\n", "Q: Cannot write to Samba shared folder This question has been asked several times, but reading the different answers did not get me to resolve my specific problem.\nUbuntu 14.04 is installed on my HTPC.

You add the users to that group for access. Set the permissions to 775 which gives the owner and the group read-write-execute access while others only read. Set's it recursively.\nVerify that you have total access to the folder. With samba, setting the permissions are a little bit different than file permissions with a ubuntu user. What I mean is that verify the permissions after you take ownership because they could result in a samba error later on down the road. Where nobody can access the drive.\nCreate a samba account that matches your Linux username precisely.\nsudo smbpasswd -a miguel\nsudo smbpasswd -e migeul\n\nThat will prompt you to create a password for the username miguel. Please note that this is only for SMB shares not for the user in the Operating System.\nAfterward, open up the samba config and when sharing the drive make sure you type in writable = yes, browsable = yes, read only = no and add your group to it as well. Also, verify the location you are sharing from.

To do that open up /etc/profile using sudo nano /etc/profile and at the bottom type in umask 002. Use Control+O to save and Control+X to exit. Best to reboot the server using sudo reboot and the new mask permissions will take place. That setting re-asserts the same permissions for the users.\n", "Q: USB Keyboard non responsive during installation I am trying to install ubuntu 14.4 version.

My drive works perfectly without any issue.\nBut when I try to connect this drive to a Windows 10 host, it is not recognized properly by the system (Windows is not able to detect the filesystem). I have read somewhere that the same happens if the drive has been formatted from a Mac, and the \"only\" solution was to always format a drive from Windows, if you want to use it on other operating systems.\nAm I the only one experimenting this? Is it because I made sure to create an \"aligned\" partition when I formatted it (no remember exactly what it was, but I did to get rid of a warning in Ubuntu when I mount it).\nUpdate (2015-12-07)\nThe version of exfat-utils and exfat-fuse: 1.0.1-1~ubuntu12.04.1.\nAnd the warning I got wasn't on mount after all, but at the creation of the partition using parted with mkpart: \nWarning: The resulting partition is not properly aligned for best performance.\n\nSo I followed this guide to create an aligned partition: http://rainbow.chard.org/2013/01/30/how-to-align-partitions-for-best-performance-using-parted/\n\nA: After some trial and errors, I've been able to format an exFAT partition on Ubuntu that is working on Windows 10. The trick is to add the msftdata flag on the partition (regardless if partition is aligned or not):\n sudo parted <DEVICE> set <PARTITION_NUMBER> msftdata on\n\nFor example:\n sudo parted /dev/sde set 1 msftdata on\n\nAnd it worked for me in Windows 10!\nAnd in case it helps someone, this is how I created a single aligned exFAT partition in the first place:\n sudo parted /dev/sde mklabel gpt\n sudo parted -a optimal /dev/sde mkpart primary '0%' '100%'\n sudo mkfs.exfat /dev/sde1\n\n\nA: I have the same problem with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\nSo I ended up with formatting 2TB HDD under Windows 10 so I did't bother trying different block sizes or other format parameters. \nI have read similar article about MacOS X\nFrom Apple forum:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4745362?tstart=0\n\nI heard somewhere that if a External Hard Drive is formated exFat on a\n  Mac, it wont work on Windows, unless it is Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) or\n  10.8 (Mountain Lion). I have Snow Leopard (10.6.8) and I wanted to know if I format my External HD for exFat will it work on Windows? I\n  currently have is formatted as Fat32 but there is a 4GB limit so I\n  wanted to try exFat.\nIt's a known issue that, depending on how big the drive is, formatting\n  exFAT in OS X uses too large of block (cluster) size that Windows\n  doesn't like. Format the drive from within Windows with a block size\n  no larger than 1024 and you should be able to use the drive on both\n  platforms.\n\nSo it seams that IT IS UBUNTU PROBLEM and FITS AskUbuntu because of using by default nonstandard or incompatible block size while formatting exFATpartition.\n", "Q: Is there any need of antivirous program such as microsoft windows? Microsoft windows needs an anti virus program to protect system from virus and other programs which are harmful for the system. Is there any need of such type program for Ubuntu OS? If not then why?\n\nA: Yes you can install clamav》 \n\"sudo apt-get install clamav\"\nHowever in linux it is not necessarily necessary. I would read the link posted above. \n\nA: There are a few antivirus programs for Ubuntu. But most likely you won't need any. I will explain why:\n\n\n*\n\n*You should ALWAYS get software from the official repositories (the ones available in the Software Center). Every single piece of software available there is completely virus free. If you only get packages from the official sources you will be safe;\n\n*There are very few viruses for Linux. This happens because most of the virus production has Windows as a target;\n\n*Everything that requires important changes in Ubuntu needs root privileges. You must have root access to do these changes. Nothing important will be changed unless you give your password (that's why you should always be careful about commands starting with 'sudo' or 'su').\nSo...\nProbably you shouldn't worry about getting an antivirus. If you follow all the security rules you won't be affected.\n", "Q: How to set up triple monitors in 14.04 with NVIDIA GTX980M I'm used to working with three monitors at the same time (laptop monitor + two external monitors). However, I don't seem to be able to get it working on my Ubuntu 14.04 with a GTX980M + Intel configuration which has three video outputs (One HDMI + two DisplayPort). It works perfectly on Windows so I guess it's more likely a Ubuntu configuration issue. The model is Clevo P650 (known as Sager 8658 in the US or 神舟 战神 Z8-KL7S2 in China). I have installed the NVIDIA proprietary driver version 355. Strangely, on the login screen, all three screens display Ubuntu background correctly, as shown here.\nHowever, once I log in, only two screens can coexist at the same time: If I leave out a cable, whether at HDMI or DisplayPort, the laptop monitor displays normally with the one remaining external monitor. However, if I keep both cables plugged in, then the laptop monitor goes dark and only two external monitors are displayed.\nI tried running sudo nvidia-settings, however only two displays are shown there, as can be seen in the photo. I tried to create multiple X screens in the configuration, but strangely, the settings that I wrote each time via \"Save to X Configuration File\" seem to get lost whenever I login again, as xorg.conf gets reset to its initial state. It seems that the settings written are invalid. I Googled a while, but the questions seem to be dealing with older versions of Ubuntu/NVIDIA drivers. I couldn't find where I might be able to configure TwinView. I'm currently at a loss as of what to do next. Should I try to manually write a xorg.conf? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!\n\nEDIT: The situation with nouveau is even worse. Although lspci -vnnn | perl -lne 'print if /^\\d+\\:.+(\\[\\S+\\:\\S+\\])/' | grep VGA seems to show that both the NVIDIA and the Intel cards are working, no external monitor seems to be recognized at all.\nThe xorg.conf written by nvidia-settings by default (without attempting to create multiple X screens) seems to be this one.

When I try it, the monitors get mirrored and get very weird resolution. When I try to demirror them, I can't even click on the \"keep current configuration\" button to confirm the change. Actually, the display on three screens at startup was also probably just because of mirroring effect.\n\nA: For some weird reason it seems that as long as I plug in the external monitors after I log in, I can run arandr to configure the screens into displaying extended desktop totally fine (from mirrored screens). If I leave them already connected before I start up the laptop, it doesn't work and the internal display is always blank (not all blank actually, since there's light and it's obviously \"on\", but just black and displaying nothing.

I had a perfectly good working UBU 14.04 LTS on a 1TB WD Drive in SATA 1 position.

Thank you all for your answers.\n\nA: I had a similar thing occur with my Slackware installation. I was able to fix it by re-running the installation but skipping the actual filesystem install part. The install originally gave me the option of doing a UEFI or LILO install but I chose UEFI install because newer is better, right? Turns out, nope. LILO for me next time if the MB supports it.\nWith respect to Rod Smith, \"Don't power on a computer with its boot disk(s) unplugged. Ever.\" appears to be a true answer but also one that I consider to be completely crazy. Who designs this stuff?\n\nA: Actually, that first link you posted is basically applicable. Also, oldfred has almost certainly correctly diagnosed the problem. More broadly speaking, EFI is not BIOS! This means you must abandon certain BIOS-centric habits, such as your trick of unplugging a disk to protect it from the activities you undertook. Under EFI, boot order information is stored in NVRAM, and unfortunately, some EFIs will delete NVRAM entries that no longer exist. When you unplugged your boot disk, your firmware almost certainly deleted those entries. (You can argue, with merit, that this is a lame design decision, but it's one that exists in the real world, so you as an end user must be aware of it.) There are three ways to adapt to this strange new world:\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't power on a computer with its boot disk(s) unplugged. Ever. \n\n*Know how to recover your boot loader if you unplug your boot disk. (Hint: efibootmgr can do this. See this tutorial, or any of dozens of others, for help.)\n\n*Put a suitable boot loader in the fallback filename position (EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi on the ESP). This could be a copy of GRUB or something else entirely.\n\n\nYou may also find my rEFInd boot manager, placed on a USB flash drive or CD-R, to be useful for recovery in situations like this. It should at least get your system up and running again, from which point you can run efibootmgr or even do a full re-install of GRUB.\n\nA: First, I want to thank @Rod Smith for your answer.  I would certainly look up boot manager and try it, but I did find a work-around.  \nI used my backup drive as a test to reinstall Ubuntu over the existing data in the drive.  \nIt did not boot when I plugged it in, but I was able to boot a live disk and perform the install.  \nWhen I finished the install, I was able to boot the backup drive and it was complete with all the software and data.\nWhen I plugged in this, my active drive, I was able to boot right into Ubuntu without a problem. \nSo, now my backup plan includes keeping a dummy drive handy to reinstall Ubuntu in case this happens again.\nAs for booting without a drive, I did not do that until after I could not boot Ubuntu. \nThank you all for your help.  It was your information, whether I understood it or not, that triggered my thoughts to attempt to rectify the problem by reinstalling Ubuntu. \n\nThe cause of this problem is that I bought an SSD for my boot drive, but I decided to use it in my laptop instead and to buy a larger one for my desktop.  I needed to run Clonezilla to create a drive I can safely change partitions on so the 1TB drive fits on the 240GB SSD.  \nI still need resize the partitions, but at least I know how to fix the efi problem if it occurs again.\nSo, again, thank you to all.\nBuck \n", "Q: Monitor Resolution problem in Xubuntu 15.04 I'm new in this forum and even a beginner with ubuntu.\nI've already tried to set the resolution of my monitor to 1440x900 but I can't get on because xrandr shows me error messages like:\nxrandr: Failed to get size of gamma for output default\nxrandr: Configure crtc 0 failed\nHere there is the output of xrandr\nScreen 0: minimum 640 x 480, current 1280 x 1024, maximum 1440 x 1024\ndefault connected 1280x1024+0+0 0mm x 0mm\n   1280x1024       0.0* \n   1024x768        0.0  \n   800x600         0.0  \n   640x480         0.0\nAs I said before, I would like to set resolution to 1440x900.

Following instructions on this page, the page showed a dd command and a sync option at the end. The command is the following:\nxzcat ~/ubuntu.img.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdX bs=32M sync\n\nI know what is dd and how it works but I've never heard of or used the sync option with it and its manual page entry is like:\nsync   pad every input block with NULs to  ibs-size;  when  used  with\n       block or unblock, pad with spaces rather than NULs\n\nWhat is NUL and why is it padded to ibs-size, and why bother padding the data blocks and use the sync option with the dd command? Why not keeping it simple and easy?\nWhen I try to run sync with the command as it is with the appropriate location and values I get the following error:\ndd: unrecognized operand ‘sync’\nTry 'dd --help' for more information. \n\n\nA: Dd will read in data one block at a time (the block size is specified by the user). Dd may possibly read in a shorter block than the user specified, either at the end of the file or due to properties of the source device; this is called a partial record. By default, dd will then write out a block that's the same size as the amount that it read.\nDd will repeat this until the specified count is reached, or it sees eof on input, or error on input or output. When it finishes, dd reports the number of full and partial records it read and wrote.\nThis behavior is fine for copying an ordinary file within a filesystem or over a TCP network connection, since that's considered a stream of bytes. But other filesystem objects, such as raw DVDs and magnetic tape, require write sizes that are within certain ranges and are a round multiple of some amount (such as 512 or 2048 bytes). For example, if you have a disk image that is 255 tracks of 63 512-byte sectors, and want to write to a tape that requires a block size of 1024 bytes, you'd need to do something like\ndd if=disk.img of=/dev/rmt0 bs=1k conv=sync\n\nto make sure that dd doesn't try to write out a 512-byte block at the end. The shorter block at the end will be padded with zeroes or blanks. Padding with zeroes is a safe, common choice. The option for dd to pad with blanks is useful in a different situation - converting a file that has variable-length lines to one with fixed-length lines.\n\nA: You are misreading the command. It's:\nxzcat ~/ubuntu.img.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdX bs=32M \nsync\n\nsync is a separate command, here. See man 1 sync:\nNAME\n       sync - flush file system buffers\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       sync [OPTION]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       Force changed blocks to disk, update the super block.\n\nKinda obvious why it's used once you think of caching.\nAs for the dd option you read, it's a value for the conv option:\nEach CONV symbol may be:\n   ascii  from EBCDIC to ASCII\n   ...\n   sync   pad every input block with NULs  to  ibs-size;  when  used  with\n          block or unblock, pad with spaces rather than NULs\n\nIf it was used (which it isn't), it would be used thus:\ndd ... conv=sync\n\n\nA: You can use sync option for output, which is included in dd comand, by oflag symbol:\nxzcat ~/ubuntu.img.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdX bs=32M oflag=sync\n\n\nA: I have found that the linux system, not dd, caches the buffers. Therefore, when the dd command has completed, I run sync\nas\nsudo dd if=my.downloaded.iso of=/dev/sd(?) bs=1M && sync\n\nI have not used any internal dd option to cause buffer flushing.  Typically though, when I am creating a USB version of a distribution, I am the only one on the computer, so I have no qualms about my posted command doing harm. Since I run the sync as &&, sync is done with sudo rights and I am sure that the USB I create is complete.\n", "Q: Unable to launch glade 3.18 which I compiled from source I am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18, and I have installed Glade 3.18 for GTK3 by compiling it from source.\nSo once I had unpacked the tarball in my home directory it told me that I needed to install gtk+-3.0, so I installed it with (it apparently also installed 111 other packages):\nsudo apt-get install gtk+-3.0\n\nI then ran:\ncd ~/glade-3.18.3\n./configure\nmake\nmake check\nsudo make install\n\nAnd although it claims to have installed itself correctly, when I launch it through the GUI nothing happens, and when I do so through Terminal I get this output and it exits:\nglade: error while loading shared libraries: libgladeui-2.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nSo why am I getting this error?

When I run a live distro from a USB drive, I want to access the USB key's file system to, for example, get files and copy to the USB drive, or copy files from the USB key to another filesystem.\nIs this possible? Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: Remount cdrom to get write access to /cdrom\n+1 to @MihaiRotaru's comment,\nsudo mount -o remount,rw /cdrom\n\nRemounting works, but root will own /cdrom and its content. This means that it will work to write with sudo.\nExplanation and discussion\n\n\n*\n\n*Here we are talking about a live (live-only) Ubuntu or Ubuntu family flavour that is extracted from an iso file into a FAT32 file system in a partition in a USB pendrive or memory card. This method is used by Rufus and Unetbootin. You can make it yourself according to this link.\n\n\n*\n\n*In a live-only drive with  an Ubuntu family system, /cdrom is mounted read-only but can be remounted read-write.\n\n*In a persistent live Ubuntu family system, cdrom is mounted read-write, but there should also be a casper-rw file or partition, where it is more straight-forward to write (simply write in the home directory tree and it will be stored automatically).\n\n\n*A live system can also be created by cloning from  an iso file onto the device of a USB pendrive or memory card. This method is used by the Ubuntu Startup Disk Creator and Disks and mkusb in Ubuntu and by Win32 Disk Imager (and Rufus in 'dd-mode') in Windows.\n\n\n*\n\n*The cloned file system ISO 9660 is read-only by design and you cannot store anything in it.\n\n*You can create a partition 'behind' the cloned part and use the unallocated drive space for a partition, where you can store data.\n\n*If the Ubuntu version is 19.10 or newer and\n\n*if the partition has an ext2, ext3 or ext4 file system and\n\n*if the partition has the label casper-rw\nit will be a persistent live system, where stored data, tweaks and installed programs will persist shutdown and reboot. This is described in this link.\n\nA: Yes, it is possible. Let's say you are running Ubuntu Live USB. You will have to know the name of the file in /dev that the kernel gave to your USB drive. Open a terminal and run the following command:\nlsblk\n\nIt will list all the drives detected by the kernel and some information about them, such as their size. Find yours by looking at its size. It should be something like /dev/sdb1. Now run:\nmount\n\nThis will list all the mount points and theirs respective devices. Find /dev/sdb1 (or whatever your USB drive is) in a line like /dev/sdb1 on /some/path. /some/path is our mount point. Open a file manager and type this path in the address bar. Press ENTER and you will be inside your USB root. Create a directory to put your files in, so they won't be confused with the live system's files.\nEDIT: sorry if it was confusing to you. As an Arch Linux user I am used to do almost everything through command line. If you just open Nautilus, your USB drive should already be there, in the left bar. Just click it and you will be inside it. You can follow the command line method anyway to learn the \"hardcore\" way.\n\nA: If you want to take a backup of your system drives then you will see its name as <storage space> Volume you can right click it, select mount and take a backup to another drive\nDo this process inthe file manager gui\n", "Q: Updated from 12.04 to 14.04, software center now saying I have no permission to download software just a note I'm not an expert at this.

By default, Ubuntu Server is not very secure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Automatic security updates are not enabled\n\n*The 'ufw' firewall is not enabled\n\n*SSH key-based logins have to be explicitly created\n\n*and so on...\n\n\nFor my own personal use, I have followed guides such as http://hardenubuntu.com/ to turn on unattended-upgrades, install fail2ban, etc. But now I am running a business in the cloud and don't want to repeat all these steps manually every time I spin up a new instance. Is there an Ubuntu distro/variant that comes with \"production-ready\" security and doesn't need to be manually hardened? Solutions using configuration management tools (Chef, Puppet, Ansible, etc) will also work.\nAnd if there is NOT such a thing, why not?\n\nA: If you're looking for these features you need to use the Ubuntu Cloud image instead of the traditional server image.\n\n\n*\n\n*Security updates are turned on by default and new images are published every few weeks with the updates rolled in.\n\n*In cloud environments the networking is usually restricted out of the box, but if you want to use ufw you can turn it on.\n\n*The cloud images only accept login via ssh, you can use cloud-init to create/use whatever keys as well as user data if you'd like: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CloudInit\nFrom your comments it looks like you want to automate your deployment with Ansible. Ansible and cloud-init is a popular pattern in the cloud, there are lots of guides on how to do that, here's one as a start:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.cloudsigma.com/an-introduction-to-server-provisioning-with-cloudinit/\nHere are a bunch of examples of configuration for cloud-init that you can use to derive custom configs of your own:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~cloud-init-dev/cloud-init/trunk/files/head:/doc/examples/\n\nA: There is no such version of the Server installer, nor the Desktop installers, because it would be detrimental to administration to have something 'completely locked down' upon installation.\nAs I understand it, this is because the delicate balance of \"Ease of Setup/Use\" and \"Lock It All Down\" is a very delicate one.\nAs I understand it...\n\n\n*\n\n*The system doesn't enable automatic updates automatically because to do so could compromise stability.\n\n*Enabling ufw automatically is annoying to sysadmins who want things to 'work out of the box' and then want to lock down the firewall rules after things work the way they want (this is MOST security-centric server administrators, by thew ay).\n\n*Forcing keys to be generated immediately upon installation is a no-no, because setting up such keys usually needs the other system to generate them first.  To enforce key auth immediately would likely block the ability to set up that type of key authentication.\n\n\nConsider also that Security is an ongoing process - starting with a relatively 'okay' setup and then locking down things accordingly with your security policy needs and such is a better approach than having something totally locked down and then having to 'remove' security constraints as time goes forward.\nThere is also a configuration process - consider that if we as sysadmins have to break down security on a machine just to set it up and then re-secure it, it saves time to go the opposite direction - configure the systems first, then lock it down.  This is the typical approach to administration/security...\n\nNote that I am not a member of the Ubuntu Security Team, but this is the most likely reason for the approach in place now, using your specific examples here.\n\n\nA: \nAutomatic security updates are not enabled\n\nAutomatic security updates are not generally seen as a good practice for a production environment because they can result in unexpected downtime.  In a production environment you'd schedule updates so you can notify users/clients and deal with the rare scenario where an update breaks configuration.\n\nThe 'ufw' firewall is not enabled\n\nIn most cases you need to manually set up a firewall like ufw; it is not usually possible to have an \"automatically\" configured firewall that provides significant benefit.\nThe benefit from a system level firewall like ufw is to limit the ability of rogue processes, or even known processes, to communicate with the outside world.  Each person's definition of which processes should be able to communicate with the outside world will be different.  If an automatically configured firewall was too conservative, this would create headaches when users install software and want that software to be able to access the internet.\n\nSSH key-based logins have to be explicitly created\n\nI can't think of a mechanism where the remote user (client) could be securely given a private key by an automated process.  Also, it would need to somehow verify that the client machine received the private key before turning off password based login.\n\nA: Server environments are not for out of box deployment as they can vary greatly. The base settings that Ubuntu server comes with need to be customized for different environments. So disabling or enabling services, firewalls etc. are all subject to the need of the deployment.

I have installed windows 7 on first one, and today I installed ubuntu 15.10 on second one (sdb7,8,9), and selected sdb for boot loader installation. \nThen I rebooted and Windows came up without prompting for ubuntu. \nThen from BIOS I selected second HDD for booting and Ubuntu came up.\nThere is no option in UEFI to set priority as second HDD, you can only select it for that time (is there any option?)\nThen I tried to install boot repair with\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nbut it replied many errors.\nNow I can boot Ubuntu only when I come to UEFI and select sencond HDD.\nHow can I fix this to have options for booting or always boot from second HDD? Must I install Ubuntu on the same HDD with Windwos? What if I move boot loader to sda (and can I do this?)\nplease help. thank you very much\n\nA: Your computer may have an EFI, but both your OSes are installed in BIOS mode, so EFI-specific issues are unimportant.\nThere should be an option to set the second disk as the default one for booting. If such an option is missing, then that's a design flaw of your firmware. I recommend you check again for such an option. (Maybe it's in a menu you've not examined, or is available only when you select some other boot-related option.)\nIf you can't find such an option, you have several possible solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install GRUB to /dev/sda with sudo grub-install /dev/sda or by using Boot Repair. This option should produce a working boot to GRUB, which should then enable you to boot either Ubuntu or Windows; however, I can't promise it will actually work as it should. There's a small chance that this operation will make matters worse.\n\n*Swap your disks (by swapping the cable connectors) so that /dev/sda becomes /dev/sdb and vice-versa. This should cause GRUB to come up by default, assuming the firmware is booting by device connection order rather than by identifying the disk make/model or serial number. My guess is that this option is less risky than the first, but there's a chance that Windows will become confused when its assigned disk changes.\n\n*Use my rEFInd boot manager:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an EFI System Partition (ESP) on your GPT disk (/dev/sdb).\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of rEFInd and prepare an external medium with it.\n\n*Boot to the rEFInd medium. This should enable you to boot to Ubuntu.\n\n*In Ubuntu, install the rEFInd PPA or Debian package.\n\n*Edit /boot/efi/EFI/refind/refind.conf: Uncomment the scanfor line and add hdbios to the list of options.\n\n*When you reboot, you should see a new diamond-shaped option that should boot Windows, and you should still be able to boot Ubuntu.\n\n\n\nThat last option is rather complex. I wouldn't ordinarily recommend a mixed-mode setup like that. I mention it as an option because the setup process is likely to be a little safer than installing GRUB to /dev/sda. Overall, I'd say your best bet is to swap your disk cables. If that fails, I'd recommend trying rEFInd, although that wins out to installing GRUB to /dev/sda by a rather small margin.\n", "Q: Kswapd0 using 100% of CPU I've got a mini server running (L)ubuntu 14.04.3, kernel 3.4.39. Every once in a while, the process kswapd0 will use 100% of my CPU power, even though I only use about ~20% of my RAM at that time. There is no reason for kswapd0 to be running, let alone use that much of my CPU. I've already tried putting my vm.swappiness = 1, but unfortunately that didn't help.\nThere is a lot stuff on google about this problem, some dating back as far as 2010, but no real answer. What should I try?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Alright I found the answer, it turns out that most of my RAM was full of cached memory. If you set up a cronjob to clear cached memory every hour or so kswapd0 never appears again.\n\nA: It still has a process to check if there's any swap. To reduce it, you'll need to set your swappiness -\nedit /etc/sysctl.conf as root, then change (or add)\nvm.swappiness = 0\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Black Stripe in Desktop I have been using Ubuntu 14.04 on two computers for about 9 months.  I have a third computer running Zorin and it works well.  I decided to remove the Zorin and put Ubuntu 14.04 on that computer.  After installing Ubuntu, I have a black vertical stripe running thru my desktop.  If I go to the screen resolution and make a change, the stripe goes away.  If I change the background color the stripe goes away.  When I reboot the system, the stripe is back.  I thought well maybe it was a problem with the onboard video and Ubuntu.  So I installed Xbuntu 14.04.3, same results.  Also the video does not fit the screen very well, some items are off the screen, never had that problem with Zorin.\nUpdate: All screens display correctly.  I found that if I went to the plain background, There is a plain color background, one that fades horizontally and one that fades vertically.  If I choose the vertical fade, it fills in the black vertical stripe.  Then I can go back to the solid color and all is well, works as it should.  If I reboot, I have to go thru the whole process all over again.  Changing resolutions has no bearing, the stripe is in them all.  I read that updating the Intel video driver to the i830 might help and setting the AGP from 1Mb to 8Mb might help.  I set the AGP to the 8Mb setting, no help there. There was a note in the Ubuntu 14.04.3 forum saying the i830 driver was no longer available due to a bug in 14.04.3.  I am thinking this is a Intel video driver problem, but why does it work after messing with the background colors?  Then you lose the fix after reboot.  Could it possibly be a bad CMOS battery?

I use RGB for the computer and it worked fine with Zorin.\nAny ideas? (Besides going back to Zorin)  Thanks!\n\nA: OK, here is the fix.  I installed a GeForce FX-5200 AGP card and it fixed the\n problem.  Native resolution is 6:9, 1360x768 and no driver installation was required on my part.  I can live with that.

Shim tries to launch a series of follow-on programs, one of which is called fallback.efi. Ideally, Shim will launch GRUB, which is the default boot loader for Ubuntu. Either that's not happening for some reason or GRUB is being launched after Shim complains about the absence of fallback.efi and then GRUB is crashing. I'd need to dig through the Shim source code to verify the exact path it takes to figure out which is the more likely explanation.\nOne critical point is that Shim (and anything with a .efi filename extension) is an EFI program. Thus, this message indicates that your system was booting in EFI mode. If you're right about Windows being installed in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, you do NOT want to install Ubuntu in EFI mode. Thus, you may want to investigate ways to force the system to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. OTOH, if the computer came installed with Windows 10 (or even with Windows 8.x, which you then upgraded to Windows 10), it's almost certainly booting in EFI mode, not in BIOS mode. You haven't specified the history of the computer, or even its make and model, so it's hard for me to judge this. Because ascertaining the current boot mode is so critical, I strongly recommend that you review this point. In Windows, boot mode is pretty tightly tied to partition table type. If it's booting in BIOS mode, the partition table type will be MBR (aka MS-DOS or various other things). If it's booting in EFI mode, the partition table type will be GPT. See here for more information.\nIf your Windows really is in BIOS mode, you need to boot the Ubuntu installer in the same mode. There are a couple of ways you can force this issue, although both have problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can remove the EFI boot loaders from your boot medium. The boot loaders appear in the EFI/BOOT directory on the boot medium. Depending on how you prepared your USB flash drive, you can rename (or delete) that directory tree to ensure that the disk will be unbootable in EFI mode. With any luck, your computer will then drop back to BIOS-mode booting. This approach is obviously easier with a USB flash drive than with an optical disc, since the latter would require re-mastering to modify, and that's a tricky process for an Ubuntu installation disc.\n\n*You can select the correct boot mode in your firmware's boot manager. Chances are you used the boot manager to select the boot medium. If not, it's usually access by hitting Esc, Enter, or a function key (usually between F8 and F12) soon after powering on the computer. Most UEFI implementations present two boot options for external media, one of which includes the string \"UEFI\" and the other of which doesn't. Select the option that lacks the \"UEFI\" string to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.\n\n\nBoth of these approaches are based on the premise that the boot medium is bootable in BIOS mode. This is not guaranteed. Depending on how you prepared the disk, it's entirely possible that it will be missing the BIOS-mode boot loader. If that's the case, you'll need to create the disk from the downloaded .iso file again, but use a different program, or at least different options in the program, to get it to boot.\nGoing back to the earlier point about your Windows installation: If in fact you've got an EFI-mode Windows installation, things change. It could be that your disk was improperly prepared and is missing some critical EFI-mode boot files, in which case you might need to re-create the disk. Another possibility is that you're running into a Secure Boot problem, and disabling this firmware feature would help.\n", "Q: Can I install ubuntu on a windows 10 tablet?

When I go to System Settings - Clock everything on the page is greyed out and nothing can be changed.\nAny ideas or suggestions on how to cause the information to be displayed as desired and as it was previously done?\n\nA: The reason that everything is grayed out in the Time and Date Settings is because it need elevated user privileges.

I have read many places that if you enable writable root file system, you will no longer get OTA updates.\nHow, then, will I get updates? Will the \"same\" updates be provided via apt-get?\nIf I decide to go back to a RO file system. How will those OTA updates affect my system? Is it a complete root file system replacing my old one? If so, I suppose no real harm is done, except I will lose changes I've made to my root fs.\nWhat about re-flashing the phone. Can I simply flash a new root file system back onto the phone? If that is possible, I also suppose it will not affect any private data or installed apps. Will I then simply be able to boot up with the newly re-flashed root file system, and all apps, scopes and configurations will remain intact as if nothing had happened?\nAs mentioned, I have read many places warnings about \"unknown consequences\" by changing the root file system to RW mode and OTA updates not being an option anymore. But I have found nowhere a bit more in-depth description as the how's and why's of what really happens.\n\nA: I'm gonna try to explain:\nIf you make your filesystem writable you can install every software with apt-get. You could then even delete and modify important system files by using sudo. \nIf you then make your file system RO again, you can go on receiving OTA Updates.\nBut the problem now is, you have a modified ubuntu-touch system and this could cause your system to hang or crash. In other words, modifying your phone could cause \"unknown consequences\", because OTA Updates could not be compible to your modified system.\nSo, trying to summerise my answer, I would say, making your phone writable and doing any changes in filesystem can cause any unknown consequences.\nNow avaout reflashing:\nIf you change the update-channel with \"ubuntu-device-flash touch --channel=anyChannel\", your personal apps and data will NOT be changed.\nIm not shure at all, but I think, that if your device is in bootloader mode and you use this command: \"ubuntu-device-flash touch --channel=myChannel --bootstrap\" everything will be deleted.\n", "Q: How to remove kubuntu-desktop completely? I was using Ubuntu 15.10 and decided to try KDE. I installed kubuntu-desktop. I did not like it and now want to remove it completely.\nBut the problem is, running this command\n$ sudo apt-get purge kubuntu-desktop\nThe following packages will be REMOVED:\n  kubuntu-desktop*\n0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 1 to remove and 7 not upgraded.\nAfter this operation, 41.0 kB disk space will be freed.\n\nwhich means it still is not removing it completely.\nHow do I remove it completely.\n\nA: Yes, this command will remove kubuntu-desktop completely. Even if it says 41 kb of data will be removed, a lot of it will actually be removed. But there is a problem: KDE will be removed, but other programs installed with it will not.\nI suggest that you look for every program that came with kubuntu-desktop and remove them one by one. That is the most safe way (KDE programs usually have a 'K' in the beginning of their names).\nA pro tip: whenever you want to test a Desktop Enviroment, do not install it as recommended in most guides. Google for  core/minimal version. The core or minimal versions come only with the desktop, no extra software, making it way simpler to remove afterwards. These versions take a lot less disk space, too. For example, you can install 'xubuntu-core', for XFCE, 'lubuntu-core', for LXDE, 'ubuntu-desktop --no-install-recommends' for Unity, etc., etc.\n", "Q: How to display a QWidget in Ubuntu Touch using QML and C++?

What follows is the timeline leading up to my posting of this request for help/suggestions:\nYesterday, I did a brand-new install of LAMP on a stable-for-over-two-years Ubuntu 14.04 machine.  I set everything up as specified here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP\nThe first thing I did after the install was to reconfigure apache2 to have a different html-root inside my home dir: /home/user/Websites/MySite/.  I created an index.html in MySite and was able to browse to it using \"http colon-backwhack-backwhack localhost\" in Firefox.  I then created a test.php file, to which I could also browse (http colon-backwhack-backwhack localhost/test.php) successfully.\nThis morning, I renamed MySite to MyNewSite.  I created new apache2 config files (following the directions at the link specified above), just as I had yesterday.  I've quadruple-checked that I don't have any typos in the config files.  I've tried all the suggestions, or determined them not to be relevant, at the following locations:\nApache 'You don't have permission to access / on this server'\n(can't post 4 additional links because I don't have enough reputation points)\nI don't know why it worked perfectly yesterday and changing it to point at a new directory hosed it.  Specifically, why is apache2 trying to access anything in the root (/)?  And what do I need to look at/change to get it working again?\n\nA: It sounds like your Apache user does not have permission to read the specified file in that directory. Be sure that www-data, which is the default user on Ubuntu, can read there.\nMore information here:\nhttps://serverfault.com/a/357109\n\nA: By combining carnau's suggestion, below, and Progrock's suggestion, above, I got it working!\nAs carnau suggested: I studied up on permissions and discovered that the permissions for the folders in question were not quite right.  I was both the user-owner and the group-owner of the objects.  I fixed that, making sure that www-data was the group-owner and that the www-data group had r-x permissions.  All the objects are now set to \"755\" permissions.\nUnfortunately, when I tried the browse to index.html, after fixing the permissions issue, I still got the same error.\nThen I tried Progrock's solution.  I didn't think it would change anything because I HAD reloaded apache2 after making changes to the config files, using sudo service apache2 reload.  Apparently, sudo apache2ctl graceful does something different because after issuing that command, everything works fine now.\nThank you to carnau and Progrock!\n", "Q: Looking for a school admin app for Ubuntu I am about to open a language school and would like to use Ubuntu there on the computers. Plus I badly need a school management tool (opening class, managing who signs up, where it is taught, students' and teachers' profiles, integrated website, payroll, HR...etc). Does anyone know of a free tool that could be used with Ubuntu? I am looking at \"schooltool\" which is supported on Ubuntu only, but I thought I would ask the users too. Hopefully someone has worked with something similar on Ubuntu.\n\nA: Have you ever heard of Edubuntu? Edubuntu is an official Ubuntu flavor. Its target is Education, classrooms, schools and communities. It has quite a few tools for this, maybe one of them is what you're looking for? Take a look at\nhttps://www.edubuntu.org/\nIt also uses the Unity Desktop, so you won't feel much difference in the userland.\n\nA: You can use SchoolTool, it's an open source, web based student information system designed for schools in the developing world, with strong support for translation, localization and automated deployment and updates via the Ubuntu Linux installer and package management system.\n\nSome Features :\n\n\n*\n\n*Customizable student and teacher demographics and other personal data\n\n*Contact management for teachers, students, and their guardians\n\n*Teacher gradebooks\n\n*Skill and outcomes based assessment\n\n*Schoolwide assessment data collection and report card generation\n\n*Class attendance and daily participation grades\n\n*Calendars for the school, groups, individuals, and resource booking\n\n*Tracking and management of student interventions\n\n\nFor more informations, see Overview of Features page.\nPros: SchoolTool has a ton of features that largely appeal to teachers. It provides educators with what they need to run their classrooms (gradebooks, skill assessment documents, class attendance sheets, and daily participation journals), strong organization features (including a calendar that plugs in with popular calendar applications like Google Calendar), and a great report card generator. SchoolTool was made with Python, is largely secure, and is run on Linux Ubuntu.\nCons: SchoolTool is a great starting software for smaller schools, but it isn’t an all-inclusive piece of software. For example, schools will have to find other applications to do human resources, reporting, and financial management. SchoolTool is far more a tool for teachers than it is for administrators.\n\nFor other solutions see : The Top 6 Free and Open Source School Administration Software\n\nInstalling SchoolTool :\nTo install or upgrade to SchoolTool 2.8, add the 2.8 PPA to your server’s sources list.\nUsing the command line:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:schooltool-owners/2.8\n\nIf you get an add-apt-repository not found error, install it:\nsudo apt-get install software-properties-common\n\nInstallation :\nEnter at the command line:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install schooltool\n\nAfter installation, the schooltool server can be accessed from the server at http://localhost:7080.\nUpgrading SchoolTool :\nTo upgrade SchoolTool to a new point (2.6, 2.8, etc.), switch to a repository containing a newer version as described above, and enter:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nFor more info :\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing SchoolTool\n\n*How To Install SchoolTool Student Information System on Ubuntu 14.04\n", "Q: Getting a Focusrite 18i20 how do I install with good studio program I'm pretty stoked my new Focusrite 18i20 is at the PO ready to pick up.

The software is of extremely high quality and the standard plugins are on a professional level.\nOther users like Ardour, which is free, but I think does not have VST support.\nAs for NLEs, Kdenlive worked extremely well for me so far, it supports resolutions up to 4K out of the box and has a feature allowing you to edit huge files in lower resolutions to increase live rendering.\nMake sure to set up your interface properly. I recommend Jack/Cadence from the KXStudio repositories. They also have guides on how to measure hardware latency and Wine-rt/WineASIO packages, should you want to install Reaper. A realtime kernel is also helpful.

So my GRUB and BIOS are already working for the dual boot.\nNow, I have the option to upgrade my Windows 7 partition to Windows 10. Can I do this as is? \nThis is such an unknown, I am actually not sure what specific questions to ask besides \"how do I do it?\" :) \n\nA: I upgraded to Windows 10 without a backup and nothing bad happened to Windows or Ubuntu. Making a backup is ideal of course, but nothing should happen.\n\nA: Yes you can upgrade to Window 10 and keep Ubuntu. You would just have to follow the directions on Windows. ****First I make a backups disk for Ubuntu****\n\nA: Short answer, yes you can.\nIf you haven't already taken a backup, do so. See this for how.\nHow:\n\n*\n\n*Make a LiveUSB or CD/DVD of Ubuntu.\n\n*Remove grub to make sure the Windows update goes without a hitch.\n\n*Update Windows and let it do it's thing.\n\n*Reboot and boot into Live Ubuntu.\n\n*Follow this. PS: Really worth a read.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nA: It's a good idea to have backups of your important files before upgrading to Windows 10.\nTo upgrade, reboot your computer and choose the Windows option in its bootloader. From within Windows, download the Media Creation Tool from Microsoft, launch it, and select \"Upgrade this PC\". Perform the same upgrade process you would to upgrade any Windows 7 or 8.1 PC to Windows 10.\nYou could also download the Windows 10 ISO from within Ubuntu and burn it to a disk. You could then reboot into Windows 7 or 8.1 and launch the setup program from the disc. Be sure to upgrade by running the installer from within Windows 10 and selecting upgrade. You can’t actually perform a clean install of Windows 10 on a PC until you first upgrade it. The upgrade process effectively grants your PC the free Windows 10 license. Microsoft makes a note that your PC's specific hardware configuration is allowed to use Windows 10 on its activation servers.\n\nGo through the typical process to upgrade Windows as if it were the only operating system on your PC. When the installer reboots normally, you'll be brought back to the GRUB2 bootloader menu again. Select the \"Windows\" option here each time your computer reboots.\n\nWindows 10 will install normally, replacing your existing Windows 7 or 8.1 system with Windows 10. It'll work just like it would on a typical PC with only Windows 7 or 8.1 installed. As it's an upgrade, you won't be prompted for partitioning or anything along those lines. Windows 10 will just replace your existing Windows 7 or 8.1 system on the existing partitions, leaving your Ubuntu partitions alone.\n\nWhat about the GRUB2 bootloader?\nTypically, installing or upgrading Windows will overwrite your Ubuntu bootloader. Ubuntu will become inaccessible until you reinstall Linux or perform a repair-install of GRUB2. Every time you boot your computer, Windows will just boot immediately. That's why you should typically install Windows before Ubuntu when setting up a dual boot system.\nBut, surprisingly enough, the Windows 10 upgrade process won't overwrite the GRUB2 bootloader on Ubuntu. Everything will continue working normally, and you'll see the usual Linux boot loader every time your reboot your PC. After you perform the upgrade process, selecting the \"Windows\" option in the bootloader will boot into Windows 10 instead of your old Windows system.\nOptional: Update your GRUB2 boot menu\nEverything will \"just work\", but Ubuntu won't automatically change the operating system label in GRUB. It will continue to either say \"Windows 7\" or \"Windows 8\", even though that option will boot you into Windows 10.\nYou can ignore this option entirely and continue using it — everything will just work. If you do want to rename the Windows 7 or Windows 8 entry so it reads Windows 10 instead, you’ll need to edit your GRUB2 boot menu.\nIn Ubuntu, you can install the Grub-Customizer tool from this PPA and use the graphical interface to rename the boot entry. You can also use this tool to make Windows 10 your default operating system that starts every time you boot your PC if you like.\n\nThe convenient upgrade process doesn't tamper with your system and overwrite the Linux bootloader, which is a nice change from previous editions of Windows, but if you want to install Windows 10 from scratch in the future, you should still install Windows 10 first and Ubuntu afterwards. Performing a clean install of Windows 10 would overwrite your Ubuntu bootloader with the Windows bootloader.\nIn the future, you can clean install Windows 10 on the same PC after it's been upgraded once. Microsoft will remember that the particular computer and its hardware are eligible for the free Windows 10 offer and are properly licensed. Just go through the installer and click the skip option each time you're asked for a product key. Windows 10 will automatically activate itself online with Microsoft after you reach the desktop.\nSource: Upgrade an Ubuntu dual boot to Windows 10\n", "Q: My mouse won't work in ubuntu The mouse works in debian, on the same computer, and it was working in ubuntu and it just stopped.

My cloud instance (running a web app) disk usage went up inexplicably, I suspect there is something like a storage leak there. Is there any way to  the breakdown of disk usage by directory, in order to find out the directories that take up a lot of storage, so that I can investigate?\nNote that in this cloud instance, I don't have GUI and have to rely on the terminal (through SSH).\nThe difference between this question and the linked related question is I want to find a breakdown, not just total usage of a directory.\n\nA: You could try gt5. It lists the disk usage of the contents your current directory, or a specified directory,  ordered by highest to lowest. If you see that, for example, /var/tmp is using a lot of space, you can do:\nsudo gt5 /var/tmp\n\nTo see the usage of that folders contents. To see the basics of where in your system the disk use is going, try:\nsudo gt5 /\n\nTo get it, simply do:\nsudo apt-get install gt5\n\n\nA: Disk Usage Analyzer (AKA baobab) is great to get a quick breakdown of where the disk space is going; so I'd suggest using Disk Usage Analyzer through SSH with X forwarding.\nX forwarding should be enabled both on the client and on the server in order to work; it should be enabled by default on the server, so it should be just a matter of enabling it in the current client session:\nssh -X user@host baobab \n\n\nA: Do du -sh * in the root directory.\n\nA: Other utility available in many distros (and Windows' Cygwin) for disk usage analysis in console mode is ncdu, where\nncdu -q /home/user\n\nwill show a browseable list of directories/files conveniently sorted by size. The option -q increases the refresh interval of progress reporting, speeding the gathering of directory data.\nPressing h shows the hotkeys list, and q closes the program.\nOther very useful option when searching for space hogs is -x for checking only the partition where is the target directory, ignoring links that refer to other partitions:\nncdu -xq /\n\nAs always, man ncdu is your friend.\n", "Q: System without /tmp dir?

There are various reasons some people or pre-configured systems sometimes do this, but it's not mandatory and it's a choice.  In particular, some people run /tmp as a tmpfs filesystem.  The performance benefits of this are debatable, and it can have drawbacks.

If your target PC has hardware that needs proprietary drivers, such as broadcom wireless, you might need to use live USB to install those later. \n\nA: Yes, provided that your installer machine has the capability to connect the laptop HDD, then your approach to pull the laptop HDD, install Ubuntu onto the HDD using another machine, then put it back onto the laptop, should work, as  I have also done that.\nMy old laptop install\nI had a Lubuntu live USB and wanted to install to an old laptop that was so old it lacked Boot-from-USB support.\nSo I transferred the laptop HDD to a desktop computer that could support boot from USB, plugged in the Lubuntu live USB to this desktop, installed Lubuntu to the laptop HDD, then placed the laptop HDD back into the laptop and the old laptop started Lubuntu just fine.\nNot sure about what hardware you have, but for me\n\n\n*\n\n*laptop: 2.5\" laptop HDD form factor, 2.5\" IDE connector\n\n*desktop: 3.5\" form factor, 3.5\" IDE connectors\n\n\nThe key piece of hardware I did have was a 2.5\" to 3.5 adapter\n\n\n*\n\n*looks like a black rectangle with many, many pins, and one Molex connector for power\n\n*cost around $5 at a local computer shop\n\n*Plus for some reason at the time I needed, but lacked a jumper, so just improvised a jumper by cutting a small piece of an aluminum pop can and folding it over the required pins to bridge a connection.\n\n\nSo this adapter enabled me to borrow my desktop machine to connect with the 2.5\" laptop HDD and let me install Lubuntu.\nSo, be sure to check if you need an adapter, as that seems to be the only possible obstacle that I can think of for your situation.\n\nA: Figure out which key brings up the boot menu in the BIOS and boot from a different drive until you catch the USB / DVD drive containing Ubuntu (you should be able to find out which key to press by reading the laptop's manual; otherwise Google will probably avail);\nDo the following until you manage to boot the right drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on the laptop;\n\n*Hit the key that brings up the boot menu in the BIOS;\n\n*Hit ↓ a number of times equal to the number of attempts done so far and hit ENTER;\n\n\nNot elegant but you should be able to boot Ubuntu without the hassle of unmounting / remounting the internal hard disk twice.\n\nA: Try powering on the laptop while the lid is closed.

Model number is E5-573G-56RG. I bought it only 15 days back. There is no DVD drive in it. I have tried various versions of Ubuntu- 14.04.2, 14.04.3, 15.10, 12.04.5. Tried disabling secure boot, fast startup. I current have Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 PRO (not-activated) installed with GPT partition in UEFI bios. I actually want only the Home edition and Ubuntu 14.04.3 (preferably because of LTS) or 15.10. In case more information is required, kindly ask me..\nI tried installing through Wubi, when booting if I choose Ubuntu it automatically restarts and goes into Windows 10 Home! (I didn't have Windows 10 PRO at that time)\nNONE OF THE SOLUTIONS I REFERRED HELPED ME.\nI have spent 5 days (literally at least 20 hours reading all of them and trying out all kinds of editing in the grub command line, like removing quiet splash, adding and replacing with nomodeset, no splash, acpi_osi=off, acpi_osi=Linux, acpi_backlight=vendor,  acpi_backlight=legacy, noveau.modeset=0, i915.i915_enable_rc6=1 and such things! But I was not able to succeed installing which is why I doubt if there is some more thing to be done or know exactly what has to be done.\n\nA: This is the final solution. \nFor Acer laptops, specifically model number E5-573G series, the BIOS version 1.25 is bugged and doesn't support installing Linux distribution! \nHence you need to downgrade your BIOS to install Linux.\nThe downgrading process (from v1.25 to v1.13)\nI figured out how to downgrade the BIOS.\nGo to: http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/drivers\nSearch by Product Model:\nAspire E5-573G\nSelect the right OS and download a BIOS. In my case I downloaded 1.15.\nRun the ZRT_115.exe.\nIt will fail.\nBut before you close the installer, go to C:\\Users\\name\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\\nSearch for a folder (random letters).tmp\nThere should be a H2OFFT-W.exe and zrt.rd file in there.\nJust copy this folder and close the failing install.\nIn that copied folder, edit the platform.ini file.\nBefore:\n' [BIOSVersionFormat]\n;[nb4-version] +\nBIOSVFEnable=1\nVersionFormat=XN.NN '\n\nAfter:\n' [BIOSVersionFormat]\n;[nb4-version] +\nBIOSVFEnable=1\nVersionFormat=XN.DD '\n\nThe VersionFormat value now has 'XN.DD' instead of 'XN.NN'.\nThis will ignore the fact that 1.25 -> 1.15 is a downgrade.\nPrepare for a reboot. Close unnecessary applications. Because it'll happen automatically after running the installer.\nRun H2OFFT-W.exe.\nUpon reboot, you'll see a BIOS installing progress bar.\nAfter that is done, press F2 during startup to get to BIOS. The version should now be 1.15.\nCREDITS TO SLOWFOOBAR.\n\nI didn't add any parameter and still the installation took place successfully. Wish everyone else for success. \nAnd in the end, don't forget to rearrange your boot priority to enable booting into Ubuntu!\nAll the best! Any queries are welcomed! :D\n\nA: Installing Ubuntu via Wubi app is not recommended.\nFirst you have to create an Ubuntu installation media.\nBurn the ISO image to a DVD or create an USB media.  \nWhen you have to create the USB media from Windows\nopen command prompt as administrator and execute:  \ndiskpart\nlist disk  \nselect disk *  \nclean  \ncreate partition primary  \nactive  \nformat fs=fat32 (quick)  \nassign letter=**  \nexit\n\nNote : * = number of USB drive | ** = select a free drive letter  \nMount the ISO file and copy everything in it to the USB drive.  \nIt is important to disable Windows hibernation - so execute:  \npowercfg /h off  \n\nShutdown the computer completely (do NOT restart).\nTurn on the PC and select the installation media to boot.  \nThe Acer Aspire E5-573G-56RG has a dedicated NVIDIA graphics card,\nso ... Highlight Try Ubuntu without installing and  press the E key.\nAdd nouveau.modeset=0 parameter to the end of the linux line.\nThen press the F10 key to boot into the Ubuntu Live desktop.  \nAfter having installed the main system, first install the NVIDIA drivers and Optimus support.\nAdd the same parameter to end of the linux line when editing the Ubuntu boot menu entry.\nWhen the NVIDIA drivers are installed, editing boot menu entries is not necessary anymore.\n\nA: UPDATE BIOS TO v1.37 and ubuntu will boot. get it from here http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/drivers and install it in windows. ubuntu will boot after off of a USB for sure. You have to also add the shimx64.efi in the secure boot section of the bios after you install ubuntu off the usb in order to get it to boot. i couldnt get it to work with secure boot turned off, but its real easy to add it.\nEdit: to install bios update, just download the 1.37 windows exe from acers website, then double click it. it will install the update and restart the laptop and finish, real easy.\n", "Q: unchosen program is not sent to the background I have a terminal and chrome open.\nboth appear in the taskbar.\nI click one of them and the gui appears,\nthen I click on the second from them but the gui appears behind the existing gui.\nmeaning I cannot see the termianl if the chrome is opened. I have to minimize the chrome and then the terminal is visible on the screen.\nHow can I solve this?\n\nA: You can use side-apps using the easy way, or the hard way:\nEasy way:\nDrag any app to the left side or right side (2 apps) or any quarter and Ubuntu will do it for you. You can also make an app fullscreen by dragging it to the top (center).\nHard way:\nResize the applications to your liking.\n", "Q: Move partition from ssd disk to pendrive I have a 128 GB SSD.

So I was wondering if there is an easier way that using WireShark (or some other tool) to find the port manually and then see which process is listening on that port? This application would ideally:\n\n\n*\n\n*Give me a list of processes\n\n*Show me (in KiB/s) the amount of data being uploaded and downloaded (in different columns) \n\n*Show me the PIDs of the processes\n\n*Show me the ports which the processes are listening on\n\n*Show me all this information in a table\n\n*Be a CLI program (ideally, but it doesn't have to be in the CLI)\n\n*Have the ability to change the update interval of the data\n\n\nI am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18, is there such a software that would meet my needs?\n\nA: I think the program Nethogs perfectly suits your requirements. From the description:\n\nNetHogs is a small 'net top' tool. Instead of breaking the traffic down\n  per protocol or per subnet, like most tools do, it groups bandwidth by\n  process.\n\nYou can find this tool in the package nethogs, so install it with\nsudo apt-get install nethogs\n\n\nThe tool is started with the following command:\nsudo nethogs <if>\n# e.g. sudo nethogs eth0\n\nThe output looks like this:\nYou can cycle through various display modes with M; this will toggle between different measurement units and bandwidth usage vs. data amount.\nThe update interval can be set with the -d option, as described in the manpage nethogs(8).\n", "Q: How to prevent net scan? i have major issues with server provider due to net scan on local IP, sometimes on public ips too. \nhow can i prevent this and/ or identify the user ?\n\nA: simply blocked in the end RFC 1918 in iptables.

Some ffmpeg filter maybe?)\n\nA: You can use the delogo filter with ffmpeg or ffplay. Instead of re-encoding, you can just filter upon playback:\n\nBefore and after delogo.\nExample: playback\nffplay -vf \\\n\"delogo=x=10:y=120:w=1:h=1, \\\n delogo=x=862:y=438:w=1:h=1, \\\n delogo=x=56:y=207:w=1:h=1, \\\n delogo=x=1259:y=943:w=1:h=1\" \\\ninput.mp4\n\nExample: encoding\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \\\n\"delogo=x=10:y=120:w=1:h=1, \\\n delogo=x=862:y=438:w=1:h=1, \\\n delogo=x=56:y=207:w=1:h=1, \\\n delogo=x=1259:y=943:w=1:h=1\" \\\n-c:a copy cleaned-output.mp4\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Results may vary, and I did not investigate why delogo caused a slight washed out look in my example.\n\n*You can extract an image from the video (ffmpeg -i input -ss 5 -vframes 1 output.png) and import it into the GIMP to find the pixel x,y locations.\n\nA: At a glance, I think you can use avidemux with a \"delogo\" filter. Though with the pixels far apart, you'll need multiple runs, and there might be better options.\n", "Q: Samba suddenly stopped working I have weird problem suddenly, my windows 8.1 machine cannot connect to samba share anymore.

I've got a little shell script that reads something like:\n#!/bin/sh\ncinnamon-screensaver-command -l -m $(fortune -s)\n\nA: The Cinnamon screensaver offers the DBus service org.cinnamon.ScreenSaver, which, among others, has the following method:\nmethod void org.cinnamon.ScreenSaver.Lock(QString body)\n\nThis method is exactly the one being called when locking the screen with a custom message. If you want to call this from a bash script, you need a DBus frontend, such as gdbus or qdbus.\nI personally prefer qdbus, as I haven't understood gdbus' syntax yet. You may, however, have to install qdbus first with\nsudo apt-get install qdbus\n\nThis may install some other Qt libraries, as well. When installed, you can call the method using\nqdbus org.cinnamon.ScreenSaver / Lock \"$message\"\n\nwith $message containing your custom message.

I thought it might be a driver problem so I did the following (since apparently Broadcom drivers are a bit buggy):\nsudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source broadcom-sta-common broadcom-sta-source\nsudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter firmware-b43-installer\n\nBut it didn't work.\nI've googled a lot and found that there were similar bugs (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/1464738, Freeze after upgrading kernel to 3.13.0-66 (14.04) or 3.19.0-31 (15.04)) recently which might be fixed (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1503647/comments/7).\nSome of these bugs come from the proposed repositories, which I DO NOT have activated. Is this issue still a bug? or a wrong driver? \nAny help will be appreciated :-)\nEdit 1: output from lspci -knn | grep Net -A2\n02:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Corporation BCM43227 802.11b/g/n [14e4:4358]\n    Subsystem: Foxconn International, Inc. Device [105b:e040]\n    Kernel driver in use: bcma-pci-bridge\n\nEdit 2: tried solution from possible duplicate Installing Broadcom Wireless Drivers\nwhich means running the command \nsudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source\nUnfortunately, it did not work. The system froze once again after connecting with the wireless network.\nNote: this was the same driver that was installed after the fresh install that I did a few hours ago, or at least that's what I think since the system settings->software updates->additional drivers said I was using the proprietary drivers.\nEdit 3:\nAfter boot up, both the cable and wireless connection are connected. No system freeze.\nUnplugged Ethernet cable, wireless connection still active. No system freeze.\nThe moment I tried to open the browser -->> system froze! :-(\nI don't know what that means ... any thoughts? \nEdit 4: the log cat /var/log/syslog | grep -i network | tail -n25\nThis is all I can get before the system freezes (unpluged Eth-Cable and browser was open):\nDec  8 09:03:37 aguilar NetworkManager[996]: <info> Config: set interface ap_scan to 1\nDec  8 09:03:37 aguilar NetworkManager[996]: <info> (eth0): device state change: activated -> unavailable (reason 'carrier-changed')\nDec  8 09:03:37 aguilar NetworkManager[996]: <info> (eth0): deactivating device (reason 'carrier changed')\nDec  8 09:03:37 aguilar NetworkManager[996]: <warn> DNS: plugin dnsmasq update failed\nDec  8 09:03:37 aguilar NetworkManager[996]: <info> Removing DNS information from /sbin/resolvconf\nDec  8 09:03:37 aguilar NetworkManager[996]: <info> NetworkManager state is now CONNECTING\nDec  8 09:03:37 aguilar NetworkManager[996]: <info> (wlan0): supplicant interface state: inactive -> scanning\nDec  8 09:03:44 aguilar NetworkManager[996]: <info> (wlan0): supplicant interface state: scanning -> associating\nDec  8 09:03:44 aguilar NetworkManager[996]: <info> (wlan0): supplicant interface state: associating -> 4-way handshake\nDec  8 09:03:44 aguilar NetworkManager[996]: <info> (wlan0): supplicant interface state: 4-way handshake -> completed\nDec  8 09:03:44 aguilar NetworkManager[996]: <info> Activation (wlan0/wireless) Stage 2 of 5 (Device Configure) successful.
