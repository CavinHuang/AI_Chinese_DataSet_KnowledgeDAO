["Q: Audio balance changes randomly in MacBook Pro Retina 15-inch' mid-2012 I'm having some strange issues on my MBP Retina running OS X 10.8.2.\nThe audio balance changes, and the right speaker is almost muted. \nAnyone know what could be wrong here? \n\nA: There is an open source MacOS app that attempts to work around this acknowledged bug. The app watches for balance changes and centres immediately.\nDisclaimer: I made the application. \n\nA: I've had this problem on multiple MacBooks (from my old Powerbook 15 from 2003 to prior to finding this question on my late 2011 MBP 13\").\nApple has acknowledged it as a bug when pressing the volume buttons during heavy CPU usage way back in OS 10.2! The solution was to go back to preferences and set it back where you wanted.\n\nA: I have this exact same issue. mid-'12 rMBP 15'' 256/2.6/16GB.\nOS X 10.8.2\nFirst noticed the sound issue with my ear monitors (Shure headphones) plugged into the computer: the sound in my R earbud was like 80% diminished. But the earbuds worked fine on my iPhone 5, perfect output in each side.\nLast night, while watching a Netflix movie (occasionally plugging in my earphones into the rMBP), the laptop's R speaker suddenly lost all output. I freaked out, obviously, but quickly discovered that the balance bar had been shifted 90% to the L. Funny how that just changed itself mid-movie watching.\nAlso, after I fixed the slider bar and the laptop's speakers started functioning as normal, when I plugged my earbuds back in, I had to go BACK into Audio preferences again to change the balance bar. Strangely enough, it was shifted L again, but more like 50%, not as extreme as it was for the laptop's speakers themselves.\nAbsolutely a software bug.\n\nA: This (or something else that has the same effect) is still happening on 10.15.7 (19H2), nearly 8 years later. I've installed Balance Lock to circumvent the issue.\n", "Q: Execute command on launch of custom Terminal Window in OSX10.5+ I'm trying to find a way to automatically launch a command when Terminal is run, but:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have the Terminal window close after command has returned control to it / after (using &) after command has started launching.\n\n*Not have the user change any settings themselves / not have the settings changed globally.\n\n\nI have found (mainly from a relatively very comprehensive write-up on http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/unix3/mac/ch01_03.htm) the ability to create a .terminal file and edit the contents (plist) to contain xml like the below.\n    <key>ExecutionString</key>\n    <string>ssh xyzzy.oreilly.com; exit</string>\n\nHowever:\n\n\n*\n\n*Given the date of other postings (on google) showing this functionality\n\n*The fact that the procedure which I eventually found to create custom Terminal windows, was subtly different from the instructions in the article above\n\n*The fact that (at least with OSX10.5) they are now .term files (and complain that the file is not executable if changed to .terminal)\n\n\n... am guessing that some version of OSX, post all the information I can find on this technique, changed this functionality. Is this correct in any version of OSX 10.5+?\nAlso, is there still a way to launch a command automatically in a custom terminal window (or similar, that isn't AppleScript / Automater / etc)?\n\nA: ExecutionString was changed to CommandString\nUse it in the same way. When you do a Shell > Export Settings… it outputs a .terminal file. In my file it is located immediately after \n<key>BackgroundSettingsForInactiveWindows</key>\n<true/>\n<key>CommandString</key>\n<string>/blah/blah/blah/blah.sh run</string>\n\n(MountainLion 10.8.5)\nSo then you would run the following command from terminal or a script…\nopen ~/Documents/blah.terminal\n\n", "Q: MBP 17\" (2010) goes to sleep and can't wake it up My laptop goes to sleep and when I open the lid it wakes up just fine (or I move the mouse if I didn't close the lid).\nNow sometimes when I open the lid, it doesn't wake up.  The status light which is usually going on/off is just not lighting up at all when the lid is open.  If I close the lid again, then the light remains lit but doesn't toggle on/off.\nThe only way I can get things to work is if I press the power button for like 10 seconds to force it to shutdown.\nWhat is happening here?\nNote:  I press fn-control and the eject key to put into sleep mode (to avoid it going into the clam shell mode).\nThe output of pmset -g is:\nActive Profiles:\nBattery Power -1\nAC Power -1*\nCurrently in use:\n womp 1\n halfdim 1\n sms 1\n hibernatefile /var/vm/sleepimage\n gpuswitch 2\n networkoversleep 0\n disksleep 10\n sleep 10\n hibernatemode 3\n ttyskeepawake 1\n displaysleep 10\n acwake 0\n lidwake 1 \n\n\nA: I’m new here, but old hat when it comes to troubleshooting Macs.\nSounds like the computer isn’t going to sleep consistently. Often this happens if there’s something running on the computer preventing it from sleeping.\nThese are the steps I usually take, for this kind of thing, with the more common, easier steps first. If you find something during one of these steps, take the action to resolve it, then test the sleep functionality.\n\n*\n\n*Check for updates. It may sound awfully trite, but Apple does release firmware updates from time to time, often addressing issues relating to the System Management Controller (SMC), which has everything to do with this kind of issue.\nThird-party software also plays a big role when it comes to software problems, so check for updates for all of these as well. (Most third-party software allows you to check for updates within the application.)\n\n\n*Check for any errant, unfinished print jobs. I’ve frequently seen this be the cause. You can do this by opening System Preferences > Print & Scan (or similarly named).\nIf you see a printer that says “In Use,” and you’re not trying to print something right now, then that’s a good clue this is your problem. From here, you can delete the troubled job (Apple Support article PH10608).\n\n\n*Check Activity Monitor (it’s in the Utilities folder) to see what’s currently running. Be sure to choose “All Processes” from the pop-up menu.\nBackup software (like WD SmartWare), online syncing software (Dropbox, CrashPlan, Carbonite, etc.), out-of-date anti-virus or security software, auto-updaters and some third-party utilities can all prevent the computer from sleeping, especially if they’re in the middle of a task. Try disabling or turning them off from within its application or menu in the menu bar (and check updates for these, too).\n\n\n*Check how much hard drive space you have available. You’d probably have other symptoms, but it doesn’t hurt to check. Activity Monitor will tell you (click “Disk Activity” and look for the pie chart), or in OS X 10.7 Lion or later, Choose  > About this Mac, then “More Info…” and “Storage.”\nIt varies by version, and what you’re actively using on the computer but if you have under 10 GB hard disk space free then it’s time to empty the Trash.(Apple Support article PH10628) (Tools like DaisyDisk, WhatSize, and OmniDiskSweeper (this one is free) are great help for this. And keep in mind these may only report sizes for the currently logged-in user account.)\n\n\n*Check the file system using Disk Utility (also in the Utilities folder). When your computer goes to sleep, it saves the current state of the computer to a sleep image in /var/vm. If the computer has filesystem or hard disk issues, it may not be able to finish saving the data.\nChoose your hard disk, then click “Verify Disk.” If any errors are found, you can repair them from the Recovery disk.\n\n\n*Check Console for disk errors (where else? Yep, in the Utilities folder). Usually you’d be noticing slowdown issues, but perhaps not if the drive is only just beginning to show trouble.\nWith “All Messages” showing, in the search box, type disk i/o. It’s possible to go further back in time through system.log and kernel.log. If you see repeated errors with disk0s2, that’s going to be your boot volume, which ordinarily will be your internal hard drive. You have a failing hard drive.\n\n\n*Check for any connected peripherals. USB and Bluetooth devices, like hard drives or audio interfaces can prevent computers from going to sleep. Disconnect these things and test it out.\n\n\n*Reset the SMC. Though hardly ever needed, it’s a simple and quick step that can easily fix power-related issues.\n\n\n*Try from Safe Mode. (Learn how to Safe Boot: Apple Support article HT1455.) This allows you to test without any auto-launching third-party software and non-essential items, and rebuilds your boot cache, too. (If it works flawlessly, restart and check Activity Monitor again for any constantly running processes.)\nAfter that I suspect I’d backup and try re-installing OS X. And after that, I’d install a fresh copy of OS X onto a second partition of the internal hard drive, or onto an external drive (or erase the hard drive and install if you can afford it) and test. Should you narrow it down to this, try then installing your most essential software one at a time, testing after each item, until you find the culprit.\nIf after an erase and install you’re still encountering a problem, it’s probably a hardware issue, meaning you’ll need to take it in for repair.\n\nA: the light on you Macbook indicates that your hard drive is \"sleeping\" thats why ssd macs don't have the light, so, in order to rule out the possibility of a faulting HDD and software I'm gonna recommend you the easiest and most conclusive way!\ninstall mac os x on a USB tumb drive and run your os from the USB, its gonna be slow, sure however, you are able to rule out software and HDD issues, if it your issue persists, its hardware, that could mean anything between motherboard, graphics (i had this), and ram!\nbut lets not not jump the gun, just give the usb a try and we can take it from there :)\n\nA: Have you tried booting up in Safe Mode, logging in, closing the lid to put it to sleep, and reopening to (hopefully) waken it? What happens?\n\nA: Odd question: You dont have anything magnetic in the desk you keep it on right? This was driving me mad a few months ago when I realized I had a magnet in my desk drawer that was tripping the clamshell sleep trigger.\n\nA: It looks like a case of this: https://discussions.apple.com/message/20163244?ac_cid=tw123456#20163244\nThere is no cure for now, except make sure that you wake the Mac by activating the mouse/trackpad or using the power button. If you unplug a USB device while the Mac is asleep for instance, or have it wake on network activity, it'll get stuck.\nSure feels like voodoo, a very un-Mac-like experience\n", "Q: Locate empty folders within a folder I want to find all folders within a given folder that contain no files (but folders are ok).

But when i connect to my mac and launch iPhoto, it says I only have 67, and all of these happen to be screenshots taken with the device.\nI'm eager to erase and re-sync, but I dont want to loose the images on this device. \nps: Dropbox ALSO only detects 67 photos. \npss: Image Capture also only shows 67 photos. All from the \"Saved Images\" album. No other albums.\nWhat's going on? How can I get my Photo Library on the device safely to my Mac, I dont care if its synch from or ripped out of. \nAlso, it's not jailbroken. \n\nA: iPhoto and Image Capture only access photographs that are on your Camera Roll. I suspect that the 67 photos they find are the only ones on the photo roll. Other images—those in albums, etc.—cannot be downloaded by iPhoto and Image Capture.\nSome third-party programs can access the non-Camera Roll photographs on your device. I haven't tried any of them, but PhoneView from Ecamm seems to be recommended frequently.\nhttp://www.ecamm.com/mac/phoneview/\nI have also seen programs that attempt to extract photos from backups of the iPhone.

How can I put my CPU under very high pressure for a long period of time? Are there programs for that that I can keep running ? \n\nA: At the command line, run this command:\ncat < /dev/urandom > /dev/null\n\n(Open up a terminal window and type that into the window.)\nThis should keep your CPU loaded nicely for as long as you allow the command to run.\n\nA: Look at some distributed computing like Boinc. This runs compute intensive programs where tasks are taken and run across many machines thus allowing projects access to free computing power. In your case as the programs take up much compute power they will use the CPU heavily. Boinc runs multiple processes on your computer so will se all cores of your CPU.\n\nA: Do the following once for each CPU core in your Mac, open Terminal.app and enter the command:\nyes\n\nThe yes command will print the letter y to standard output in an infinite loop.\n\nA: Just create a small program that loops infinitely, something like:\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main()\n{\n    int i=0;\n    for(;;)\n    {\n         i++;\n         i--;\n    }\n}\n\n\nA: Several database systems are multicore optimized. You could install something like mysql and setup a basic data set, then run some of the benchmarking tools against it. If tuned correctly, many DB systems are most efficient at high CPU load (because if it was not, you would be wasting resources). \nOr, you could just wash a flash video in Safari.\n", "Q: Can I use Thunderbolt to mini display port? I have a 2011 27\" IMac running OS X 10.6.8 with a mini display port and would like to purchase a 13.3\" MacBook pro with Thunderbolt and use the IMac as an external display.  Can I do this with a mini display port cable and will the two screens mirror or will I be able to view separate windows on each monitor like mail on the MACBook and a browser on the IMAC?  Also, I will run Windows 7 in Parallels or with boot camp on the MacBook and wonder if that will still allow me to use the IMac as an external monitor?\n\nA: Actually yes, you can use your 27\" iMac as a external display for you MacBook. It will only work if you are going from thunderbolt to Mini-Displayport though.

All my highlights were lost.\nIt turns out that I have to do File > Export...  then choose to save the PDF with embedded notes. Add to that, I cannot press Command-S to save with embedded notes on the same file.\nThat's totally counterintuitive, takes too many mouse movements and keystrokes, breaks my train of thought, and just disheartening.\nHow can I make Skim save over the PDF with my notes included, simply by pressing Command-S by default? It was the default behavior until recently. It turns out they changed it in Skim 1.3.22\n\nA: I agree that this process is cumbersome. I've found the easiest way to do it is with a simple Applescript, which you can trigger from the script menu or from a launcher.\nHere is what I use:\ntell application \"Skim\"\n  set namePDF to name of document 1\n  set filePath to file of document 1\n  save document 1 in (POSIX path of filePath) as \"PDF With Embedded Notes\"\nend tell\n\nSo, here are the steps needed to fully answer your question.\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the above Applescript into your Script Editor\n\n*Save the script as \"Save as Embedded\" in ~/Library/Application Support/Skim/Scripts. If that path does not exist, then create it: create the Skim folder first in Application Support, then create a Scripts folder within that.\n\n*Open the Keyboard preference pane, then create \"Shortcuts\" from the top and \"App Shortcuts\" from the side. Create a Skim shortcut to \"Save as Embedded\", and assign it to command+s\nAs mankoff notes, Skim will prompt you every time since you are overwriting the file. To change this behavior, open a Terminal window and input:\ndefaults write -app Skim SKAutoReloadFileUpdate -boolean true\n\n\nA: Skim preferences has an option for \"Automatically save Skim notes backups\" which I highly recommend you turn on. This creates a .skim file next to the PDF. Skim still saves annotations to the extended attributes, but I've seen them go missing after sync with Dropbox. It's not supposed to, but it did. Hence, I always keep a notes backup in the .skim companion file.\nSkim's big advantage over Preview and every other PDF annotating app is fast saves. This is possible only because Skim keeps the annotations separate from the PDF content. The PDF format is such that adding an annotation to a PDF page requires rewriting the entire PDF back to disk, which can be quite slow. Skim avoids this drawback elegantly because it doesn't rewrite the PDF, only the extended attributes.\nSo, turn on the backups option, and continue using CMD S in Skim for saving your work. If the extended attributes get wiped out, then when you launch the PDF in Skim, it will detect the .skim file and offer to load it & you can continue your work.\nBonus tip: DevonThink supports Skim annotations natively. So, if it finds a .skim file or extended attributes for the PDF file you're viewing in DevonThink, it will show the annotations too. This avoids the step of having to export a PDF with embedded notes from Skim, which is required for other apps to view annotations you've made in Skim. (Skim provides a free SDK for its annotations format, so other PDF viewers should be able to support skim annotations too.)\n\nA: Normally Skim saves notes in a custom format as extended attributes. Saving with embedded notes makes it modify the actual PDF so that the notes are seen by other applications like Preview. It's under export because it doesn't preserve things like rich text in anchored notes. See the FAQ.\nDo the extended attributes get saved in the first place? Try adding some notes to a file and running xattr -l file.pdf. Are the PDFs stored on a non-HFS volume? Everything still works normally for me with 1.3.22.\n\nA: Also, it has been possible in my experience to recover Skim notes that have been lost to Dropbox by using Time Machine and restoring the version of the file immediately after the notes were added (presumably prior to the first Dropbox sync).  Obviously you need to be using Time Machine....not a solution but a way to fix the immediate problem that may have led someone to this page.\n", "Q: How to show blinking browser window Guys, help, please.

But when you go to iCloud.com, it redirects you to the iPhone applications. Is there some way to access iCloud mail via HTTP(S)?\n\nA: You can use a 3rd party browser to access icloud.com without being redirected to https://www.icloud.com/iphone_welcome. But beware, as you will see, icloud.com is not designed for a small display size like the iPhone's.\nThe key to accessing icloud.com is that the web browser doesn't identify itself as Safari Mobile.\nMany browsers I tried, including Opera, Mercury and vBrowse, didn't work. I could finally find one which offered exactly this functionality: the full version of Atomic Web (note: I'm not affiliated with Atomic Web in any way) lets you set the browser identity to Firefox, Internet Explorer or Safari Desktop. \nI chose Firefox 15 and could successfully load icloud.com. However, I soon noticed how uncomfortable it is to browse icloud.com from an iPhone. \nTo begin with, I couldn't sign in. I pinched and swiped but the display's contents didn't zoom out nor scroll. This is what I saw:\n\nI had to switch to full screen to be able to partially see the Apple ID field: \n\nI tapped on the Apple ID field, the metallic iCloud sign-in window gained focus and could log in. \nAs I feared, only the left top area of icloud.com's main page was displayed. Luckily, Mail's icon was visible and I could start it:\n\nIt was a frustrating experience. I changed orientation several times because, as before, I couldn't reliably scroll. My happiness faded and eventually, tired of trying, I gave up.\nI tried Safari Desktop, the WAP browser and IE, but same result (or worse). \nSo there is a good reason why icloud.com redirects you to use the iPhone apps: icloud.com is not designed to be used with such a small display. \nIf you really need to have access to iCloud's webmail do yourself a favor and consider getting a tablet. If it's an iPad, install something like Atomic Web. If it isn't, you will be able to access it using the device's default browser.\n\nA: Just install a browser that support changing the user agent. For the iPad I could recommend Terra. But there should be a lot of alternate browsers for iPhone as well (I think I remember Opera for iPhone).\nAnother way to use the native app would be to use any kind of VPN.\n\nA: As a web developer I understand that there are simply some limitations to websites. It is indeed possible to make, as Apple with iCloud has done, it impossible for users operating certain browsers (user agents, or other means of user-sniffing) to access the site, or a particular page of the site.\nAs you have seen when you go to www.icloud.com on your \"iPhone\", it will redirect you to www.icloud.com/iphone-welcome/. They have some pretty specific, and intense (in a way) server redirects that are happening at the server level to send you to a different page, and you will find it impossible (unless they change configuration) to get to the desired, and normal operation of www.iCloud.com. If you open iCloud.com -> Mail you will notice, if you resize your browser horizontally that at a certain point horizontal scroll bars appear. This is obviously undesirable on any device, and they have apparently opted to get around that by simply routing users to the iPhone welcome.\nAgain, you can use a different browser that allows you to change the user agent, but because www.iCloud.com is so Javascript heavy, it makes it almost impossible to navigate, as noted by @jaume. If Apple developers would have given us not-so-fancy a site, with less javascript, changing the user agent, likely would have worked very well. Javascript enables all the nice UI animations, and such beautifications - as long as you are using a desktop browser.\nInteresting side note: you can't access www.iCloud.com at all on an Android browser. You get an \"Unsupported\" error message.\n\nA: Yeah, I just purchased the full version of Atomic Web, and it bars your from going to the \"non-Sign-Up-to-iCloud\" page like every other browser.  Just wasted my money.  You should update your page to reflect this.\n\nA: I had this issue as well, trying to bring up iCloud notes for a second account on an iPhone.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use mobile Chrome.  The trick here is Request Desktop Site.\n\n*Good luck with browsing. As others have said, since Apple expects\nyou to use Apps on iOS to use iCloud services, they pay close to\nzero effort to make this work on an iPhone screen\n", "Q: How to search for empty emails in Apple mail? How can I filter email messages with no content in Apple mail?\n\nA: *\n\n*It's not possible to make a rule with an empty field in Mail.app on OS X apparently. The solution I found is to list all vowels as necessarily missing in order to process the message (in this example case, move it to the trash).\n\n*Note: this does not deal with images or attachments of any type as the sole content of the message body however. An attachment does count as 'content' in the message body. The rule(s) and criteria would have to be quite extensive to deal with attachments in addition to non-character message content.\n\n*See image:\n\n\n\n", "Q: New Apple ID problems \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can an old Apple ID be merged into the newer ID? \n\nI have my Iphone 4 for about a year now. To activate it, I used my dad's Apple ID (he had a credit card and I did not) Now I got my own credit card so I created an Apple ID and changed the ID's on my phone. Now I can no longer update my allready installed items and can't make any payments on those previously installed apps.\nAny fixes?\n\nA: As far I know, Apple purchases are not transferable to other Apple IDs. You'll either have to repurchase your apps or authorize your device to work with both Apple IDs.\nYou can continue to use the old apps with your iPhone under the new Apple ID, but you won't be able to update them. To update the apps, you have to log in with your father's Apple ID, update the apps, transfer them to your iPhone.\nUsing your Apple ID for Apple services\n\nI have purchased music, apps, or books with multiple Apple IDs. How can I get all of this content onto my iOS device? \nFirst, you need to copy all of your purchased content so it is on the same Mac or PC with iTunes. This computer should be the one you sync your device with.\nNext, authorize your computer to play content with each Apple ID in iTunes. Once your  computer is authorized for all your content, it can be synced to your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.  \n\n", "Q: Calendar set timezone automatically I travel a lot and change timezones quite often. Is there a way to let Calendar detect and change timezone automatically so I can work with Calendar in the same timezone I'm currently in?\n\nA: I don't think Calendar will automatically change the time zone. In fact, it probably shouldn't, otherwise it could be confusing if the user didn't notice it has changed.\nHowever there are two things you can easily do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable Set time zone automatically using current location in System Preferences > Date & Time > Time Zone. This will ensure that the machine time zone is always correct.\n\n*Then, in the Calendar, select the time zone in the top right corner. In this dropdown, there should normally be all the time zones associated with the calendar events, as well as the current time zone. Select the current one, and that should do it. Since this setting is saved, you only need to do it once every time you change the time zone.\n\n\nA: Automatically - don't think so. The least you can do, however, is enable Time-zone support in Calendar. To do so go to Calendar > Preferences and check Turn on time zone support. Next, you can switch between time zones from the top-right corner of the Calendar application.\n", "Q: How to increase graphics memory in Mac OS running as a client in VMware?

Dummy me for not taking a snapshot because I was in a hurry.\n", "Q: USB intermittently not working - requires restart - what to try next? The USB ports on my MacBoook Pro13 stop working after a while (new devices aren't recognized by the OS, already plugged in devices don't work any longer, the behavior is the same for all USB devices and both USB ports). Doing a restart fixes the problems for a while (about a day of use). The way I'm usually working, the Mac goes to sleep a few times during the time it works. I've tried the standard procedures of resetting PRAM and repairing disc permissions without success.\nI'm not sure how long I've been having this problem, it might be related to updating to Mountain Lion or some version change in VMWare Fusion (and no, the USB hardware is not available there, either). As the problem is not occurring directly after a reboot, I'm assuming it is not Hardware-related. Still I'd like to avoid a complete re-install.\nWhat can I do to further diagnose and fix the problem? \nUPDATE: Thanks for the suggestions. I wasn't able to try all of them .. interestingly, my USB has been working for more than a week now, and I'm not sure what changed. (Maybe I'm using VMWare in a different way, maybe it has to do with the way I use my MacBook.) So I haven't been able to verify that any of the changes solve my problem (which makes awarding the bounty a bit tricky). I'll update the question when I have new information - but hopefully my USB continues to work!\n\nA: The first step in diagnosing the problem is to create a user account and see if it happens for that user. If it still happens, it's probably hardware but could still be software. To verify it is not, then remove any software that installs Kernel extensions (VMWare does this, as well as USBOverdrive, SteerMouse, etc…) and see if it still happens.\nThe fastest route is probably taking it to the genius bar, even if the machine is out of warranty. They have tools that aren't released to the public that go much deeper than any commercially available hardware diagnostics software.\n\nA: I advise you to check for any USB misbehaviour.\nAll the hereunder commands will have to be run from a Terminal or an xterm window.\n\n\n*\n\n*Log analysis:\ngrep USB /var/log/kernel.log\n\nlook for events closely related in time with your USB hub getting deaf.\n\n*Deeper USB behaviour analysis.\n1st create a working directory:\nmkdir ~/USB.bug\n\n\n*When your system freshly started, run the following command:\nkextstat | grep USB >~/USB.bug/kext.start\n\nThis will be a reference to compare your living Kernel behaviour to later.\n\n*Next, after having used all your usual softwares having any relation with your USB connection, do a first check:\nkextstat | grep USB >~/USB.bug/kext.run\n\n\n*Finally, when your USB port is deaf, type:\nkextstat | grep USB >~/USB.bug/kext.bad\n\n\n*Compare:\ncd ~/USB.bug\ndiff kext.start kext.run\ndiff kext.run kext.bad\n\nPlease include results of this hunt start.\n\nA: There are two reasons this is happening.\nHardware and Software.\nYour first solution would to be to run the installer again, and see if that fixes the issue.  Make a backup of your data first just in case.\nIf that does not work, then you will need to do a clean install of the OS.\nIf that does not work, you have a failure in the hardware and will need to have that repaired by an ACMT.  90% of these terminal commands are just checking for stuff youc an already see by the USD losing connectivity.  They are just affirming that.  Good luck.\n\nA: I had this experience on a Mac Book Pro. Unfortunately, none of the software fixes worked. A trip to an Apple repair center showed that the problem was the on the motherboard.\nI did not want to have to buy another machine, or pay a ton to replace the motherboard. So I bought an add-on card that had a USB port. I don't know if your system has this kind of capability, but this device at OWC is quite reasonable.  \n", "Q: Does iTunes balance transfers when you change country?

Please provide URL.\n\n\nA: I opened my iTunes account in the US in 2009, and then moved back to Norway in 2010. After asking customer support, I learned that I needed to use up (most of) my remaining balance before I could change country, and I lost the remaining balance when doing the switch. (This was no great hardship to me. I had to use gift cards to pay when I was in the US, because my only credit cards were issued in Norway, so the balance was never very high to begin with.)\nOf course, that was two and a half years ago, and procedures may have changed since then.\n", "Q: How do I share files with users based on Apple ID?

I use Puppy Linux on an old HP Mini 2133 netbook and I'd like to have the option to use it occasionally on my Air as well. However, I've attempted in the past to install ReFIt and had no luck going that route. So, my question is: is it possible to simply boot from the SD card without installing additional software? I very much prefer to keep my Air as stock as possible - I currently only have about 8 or 9 3rd party apps installed so if it's possible to do it without ReFIt that would be awesome. Still, if ReFIt is necessary I'm more than happy to give it a try but, as I said, I've attempted it in the past and, upon rebooting, seen no evidence that it was installed (other than the files on my system).\n*note - I'm not trying to install Puppy Linux to the drive, I'd just like to be able to boot from it.\n\nA: Have you tried this tutorial or Puppy Linux official tutorial (page 21)?\nYou don't have to burn Puppy Linux to real CD, just repeat all installation process inside VirtualBox.

However, since then Apple has given customers new *@me.com email addresses to use with, say, iPhones and iPads. So, I was wondering what the reprecussions of using *@me.com as my AppleID would be? In other words, would I lose access to movies and TV shows that I've purchased, and would I lose access to my apps?\n\nA: The key is to change the main Apple ID email address or add an alternate email address instead of creating a new Apple ID altogether.\nIf you logon to appleid.apple.com, you can change your primary email address. There really aren't many big repercussions, and as long as you don't create a new Apple ID you will have access to all of your previously purchased content.\nIf you have friends that iMessage your @gmail.com email address you will need to add that email as an alternate email address - something you can do from  appleid.apple.com. \nWhat is interesting is that you can use your @me.com email address right now to sign into your devices. It is added as an alternate email address automatically. When you log in to appleid.apple.com you will notice that under your primary email address is an \"Alternate Apple ID\". This is probably your @me.com or @icloud.com email address.

Keep in mind that, like most BSD-Unix-style command line fdisk tools, the Mac OS X fdisk's editing feature does not 'do' safeguards, it has even less safeguards than whatever other platform's command line fdisk tool you're thinking of.  It will happily let you accidentally use the erase command (which removes all the partitions) or edit a partition that Mac OS X is currently using (rendering your system unbootable) and even has few safeguards against putting numbers that just plain don't make any sense under any circumstances right into the partition table, so please be careful.  Its only saving grace is that the changes are only in memory until it writes them, so if you are careful you can exit without saving.\n\nYou can use fdisk in interactive mode to edit the entries in the partition table. For instance, to edit the partition table on disk 1:\nsudo fdisk -e /dev/rdisk1\n\nThen edit your first blank partition table entry (e.g. edit 3), set it to type AF, press return for the default to the CHS mode question, press return to accept the default of starting the partition after the end of the last one, then enter the end sector number you want (the default is the end of the disk; to figure out one for a size you want: divide the size you want by 512 bytes to get the number of sectors you want, and then add that to the start sector number and subtract one to get the end sector number ). Do a print to make sure it looks okay (nothing has been saved yet, so if there's a mistake you can just exit (not quit) at this point and run fdisk again to start from the beginning.) Then write to save the partition table over the old one on the disk. Then exit.\nIf you get a warning at write that the changes will require a reboot, that's okay; answer y, and reboot Mac OS X after exiting.\nNow the partition table has been updated, but the partition itself still has the whatever old blocks of data were in that space before; Run Disk Utility, and from the Erase tab, choose the new partition, give it a name, and Erase it.\n", "Q: Can I enable Remote Disc on a computer that shipped with an optical drive?

The same phenomenon happens if I replace the hdiutil attach /path/to/MyDiskImage.sparseimage command with open /path/to/MyDiskImage.sparseimage, or place the command in a separate executable shell script that the launch agent executes. Also, even though the display is asleep when the above-described problem occurs, the computer itself is awake. Also, I tested having the launch agent execute a dummy executable shell script (echo $(date)) instead of hdiutil, and it executes normally even when the display is asleep.\nSo it seems that the problem occurs specifically when trying to open a disk image from a launchd launch agent while the computer's display is asleep. Why does the display's sleep vs awake status have any effect on opening a disk image? How can I circumvent this problem?\nI am grateful for any help with this puzzling problem. (I am using a MacBook Pro laptop running OS X 10.8.2 Mountain Lion.) \n\nA: It is likely your MacBook is asleep when launchd is scheduled to run your disk mount command. launchd does not change its behaviour because of the state of the display.\nYour launchd job will run so long as:\n\n\n*\n\n*the Mac is awake\n\n*the launchd job is active\n\n*you are logged in (the job ticket is in ~/Library/)\n\n\nUse pmset's debug logs to find out if your Mac was awake or asleep. The following command will print a log of everything pmset knows:\npmset -g everything\n\nBe sure to check the system.log for messages related to your failed launchd job. If a problem is encountered launchd will log a message.\nApplications > Utilities > Console.app > system.log\n\nMac OS X Energy Saver includes the ability to power on or wake your Mac at a predefined time.

Which seems very odd. Doesn't appear to be a DNS issue.\n\nA: Check the /etc/hosts file by putting this command in Terminal:\ncat /etc/hosts | open -f\nBe aware this only lets you read the file, you can't edit it this way. Assuming the file is not lengthy, post the output here.\n\nA: This may be caused by an improper DNS configuration either on your router or locally on your system (more likely in your case).\nYou can check the current DNS servers in the network preferences dialog. As a test, you can manually enter one of the Google Public DNS servers (perhaps 8.8.8.8). Then don't forget to apply those settings and maybe turn the WiFi off and back on. If webpages load, then you can either leave your DNS manually set or you can attempt to figure out why the router DNS isn't working.\nEdit: Can you elaborate on what makes you believe it is not a DNS issue? Just because it works as another user doesn't mean that your location settings are correct for the user of interest.\n", "Q: iPhone 5 tethering, device hard to discover, normal or a problem? I often use tethering now that it's enabled on Softbank network in Japan.\nI normally use WIFI connection. The thing is, my iPhone 5 is usually hard to discover from my computer (Macbook Air). Normally when I turn on the tethering and wait around 10 seconds, it shows up in the available networks in the computer. But after closing the computer, doing something else, than later (minutes, hours or days), without having switched tethering off on the iPhone 5, I don't think I was ever able to discover the iPhone 5 from the computer, without switching tethering on/off on the iPhone 5.\nSometimes even after discovery, the connection itself fails because of \"timing out\". It seems the tethering discovery with iPhone 5 is weak. Is this normal or an issue? Is the iPhone 5 faulty? (I know most/many iPhone 5 have really bad WIFI hardware and/or software. Maybe it's related.)\niPhone 5 is at iOS 6.1 I believe.\n\nA: You should verify which software level you're on. 6.1 isn't available to the public yet. iOS 6.0.2 specifically fixes a Wi-Fi bug (Apple doesn't say what the particular bug is, but it affects Wi-Fi). Check to make sure you're not on 6.0.1. If you are, upgrade to 6.0.2 and see if the problem is resolved.\n", "Q: Offsite backup of Time Capsule I use the CrashPlan software to run backups of my NAS to an offsite machine.  I'd also like to use it for backing up a Time Capsule to the remote machine.\nHow do I do this so I don't impede Time Machine's backups?\nMy Time Capsule is a disk on a Mac Mini Server that backs up an MBP.  I've tried backing up the file Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb to a remote machine with CrashPlan, but this causes Time Machine on the connected clients to stop working.\nHow can I backup a Time Capsule?\n\nA: Time Capsule supports copying backups stored on it to an external USB-disk (put in the USB-port on the device).\nYou need to trigger it through the Airport Tool.\nAfter copying the copy can be used as a Time Machine disk when restoring files or reinstalling OS X.\n(I do not use the TC as a network disk, so any files stored there, must be manually copied)\n", "Q: how to disable birthday reminders in iOS and still view them in the calendar app? Birthday reminders are nice but not if they keep popping up each day for every contact that has a birthday filled in.\nI don't need a popup birthday reminder. Especially not for every contact that has a birthday. I don't want to edit all contacts that I do or don't want to be notified about. Seeing them in the calendar app will be enough for me.\nFor this reason I decided to just turn the birthday notifications off.\nOne way of doing this is to disable calendar notifications. But that sucks... now all calendar notifications are turned off...\nAn other option would be to disable calendar birthday events but somehow I still get the annoying reminders popping up each day. ( And with me some others according to some forms I've read ) And this also disables viewing them in the calendar app.\nThen I read this:\n\nGo to Settings/Mail, Contacts, Calendars then Calendars section: Default Alert Times/Birthdays. Switch it to None.\n\nI will know by tomorrow if the 'trick' above worked but since I didn't find any q/a how to disable all birthday reminders easily I posted this here in hope to find a good answer that will fix this problem once and for all. Maybe I found an answer but if you could confirm it that would be great!\nOriginaly asked the question for iOS 6, but this still is a valid question for later iOS versions ( v10 at the moment of editing )\n\nA: Yes. This should work. As you are aware, when you (or the Facebook contact) inputs their birthday into the contact, iOS creates a new calendar called \"Birthdays\". On both iOS and OSX you have control over the notifications that you receive for each birthday that is on that calendar. \nLike you said you could can go and turn of the notifications which should prevent notifications from actually appearing. Note, however that the birthdays should still show in Notification Center.\nYou can also disable the Birthday calendar on your iOS device altogether by opening the Calendar.app, tapping \"Calendars\" in the upper left corner, and scrolling down to and tapping on \"Birthdays\". You will see the check mark next to it disappear and the birthdays will no longer show in your calendar. \nIt, of course, would be easy to turn them back on temporarily in the future if you wanted to look up someone's birthday.\n\nA: No, this doesn't work. Birthdays set to none in settings and Birthdays calendar unchecked and still getting those annoying facebook birthday reminders. Tried uninstalling facebook but that doesn't seem to work either. Facebook is like a persistent virus. Grr\n\nA: On your iPhone, pull up your calendar. On the month view at the bottom center click Calendars. Unclick Birthdays from each of calendars you are subscribed to. Gmail, Yahoo, Facebook etc.\n\nA: For iOS 10, go to Settings>Calendar>Default Alert Times>Birthdays. Switch it to None.\n\nA: I'm not sure if anyone figured it out yet, but I just had some luck and finally turned it all off from the Settings/Mail, Contacts, Calendars then Calendars section and under accounts i just clicked all of them individually and turned off the calender tab, in addition to having birthdays switched to none as previously mentioned. \n\nA: Mine is set to None there, and birthdays unchecked for a calendar, and I still get notifications on my iMac. They have to be coming from Facebook somehow...\n", "Q: Periodic problem with DNS resolution Since a few days, the DNS resolution stops working for random amounts of time, a few seconds to a few hours (I logged it with a simple script). It sometimes goes back to normal without any intervention, but comes back to normal after a reboot  - not the cleanest way to solve this...  My other machines on the same network don't have any problems. \nHow can I trace the problem ?\nHere is what happens when the problem occurs:\nping www.google.com\nping: cannot resolve www.google.com: Unknown host\n\nwhois orange.fr\nwhois: fr.whois-servers.net: nodename nor servname provided, or not known\n\nI searched my logs and found a lot of instances of this error message:\nJan 21 00:30:03 shiny.home helpd[66064]: dnssd_clientstub read_all(9) failed 0/4 0 \nJan 21 00:30:03 shiny.home configd[17]: dnssd_clientstub read_all(27) failed 0/4 0 \nJan 21 00:30:03 shiny.home mDNSResponder[40]:  17: ERROR: read_msg errno 40 (Message too long)\n\nIt think it may be related to a program I was evaluating recently (Daylite) \nThe DNS are the ones provided by my ISP, and the ethernet interface is setup via DHCP.\n\nA: This Apple support article, Non-responsive DNS server or invalid DNS configuration can cause long delay before webpages load, may help:\n\nDNS configuration\nThis may indicate a non-responsive DNS server or an invalid DNS\n  configuration. A DNS server converts a name to a numerical IP address,\n  \"www.apple.com\" to \"17.149.160.49\", for example. You can connect to an\n  IP address without any delay, because the need for DNS resolution is\n  avoided. Here are four scenarios in which the symptom may occur:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*You have specified two or more DNS servers in the Network preference pane (possibly at the direction of a network administrator\n  or your ISP), but the first server on the list has become\n  non-responsive, or was entered incorrectly. The delay occurs while Mac\n  OS X waits for the first server to respond, then it goes to the next\n  server in your list.  Make sure the addresses are entered correctly.\n  Changing the order of DNS addresses may improve performance. If your\n  network administrator prefers that the primary server be used, you may\n  wish to change back to the original order after the issue is resolved\n  with the primary server.\n  \n*Your network may be configured to provide automatic discovery of DNS service, without needing to manually type the DNS server addresses\n  at your computer. If you have manually typed a DNS address that is\n  incorrect or out of date, your computer may wait for the incorrect\n  address to respond (a \"timeout\") before succeeding at automatic\n  discovery.\n  \n*You have not specified a DNS server, and automatic discovery of the service is not provided on your network. In this scenario, you can\n  only connect via an IP address. Web pages do not load at all via a DNS\n  name, such as is described in this article.  \n  \n  \n  How to resolve\nCheck with your network administrator or Internet Service Provider\n  (ISP) to make sure your DNS information is correct. If your ISP only\n  provides you with one DNS address, consider requesting a second one\n  for use in the event that the first becomes unavailable.\nOnce you have the address(es), you can use these steps to change your\n  DNS information. Note: After using these steps, some Internet\n  applications may need to be quit and reopened to return to normal\n  behavior.\nMac OS X v10.5 or later:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*From the Apple menu, choose System Preferences.\n  \n*From the View menu, choose Network.\n  \n*Click the interface you use to connect to the Internet, such as AirPort or Built-in Ethernet.\n  \n*If you use Built-in Ethernet: Type your DNS address(es) in the DNS Server field. If you have more than one, separate them with a comma.\n  \n*If you use AirPort, click Advanced, then click the DNS tab. For each server, click the \"+\" button under DNS Servers and enter the\n  address provided by your ISP or network admin. Click OK when done.\n  Click Apply.\n  \n\n", "Q: Is their a file system that can read/write mac and win and do time machine? Is their a file system that can read/write mac and win and do time machine? \nI know that OS X can write to NTFS with the correct software installed, but Time Machine usually insists on formatting drives before using them. Is there a compromise? \n\nA: You can't use Time Machine to back up Windows, if that's what you mean. \nThe only way you could do that is if you're hosting the Win installation in a virtual machine like Parallels(Paid) or VirtualBox (free), then of course your entire VM would be backed up to TM along with everything else on your mac.\nStill, rolling back to a particular state (or recoveing a particular file) that way would be like finding a needle in a haystack.\nI'd suggest you'd be better off keeping a clone of your windows installation and a separate clone/or TM backup of your OS X installation (on a separate disk). \nNot only is this the only practical solution, more importantly its also the safest. Never keep all your eggs in one basket (hard drive) when it comes to backups, especially with Time Machine, which has a habit of getting itself corrupted just when you least want it.\n", "Q: directory structure between mac osx and linux I found that there are some differents between Max osx and linux jsut like ubuntu, etc. is there any introduction about that, or is there any one can make a introduction.\nfor example:\n\n\n*\n\n*ubuntu: /usr/lib/\n\n*10.8.2 osx: \n\n\n*\n\n*/usr/lib\n\n*/usr/libexec\n\n\n\nA: While you can shove libraries anywhere you want, and use OS X very similarly to Linux, I suspect you are after information on \"the OS X way\" of doing things, in which case:\nYour question is too broad. While similar in some ways, there are many fundamental differences than between software packaging on OS X and something like Ubuntu - well beyond \"stuff goes here on Linux, and here on OS X\".\nFor example, libraries typically live in \"bundles\" rather than folders like in /usr/lib - either as .Framework bundles which live in /Library/Frameworks or ~/Library/Frameworks (the framework bundles include headers, support versioning etc). Or shared libraries may live in application bundles... etc - each of these is a big topic by itself.\nWithout a more specific question, any answer shorter than a small book may not be very informative..\nThis article explains some of the basic locations, and their Linux-equivalents\nApple's documentation on this kind of stuff is extensive (e.g the intro to Frameworks)\n", "Q: Can't use keyboard when resuming from sleep On a Macbook Pro, with Lion: I usually set it to sleep at the end of the working day, and resume from sleep in the morning. Sometimes, I can't type the password after resume, and I have to reboot it the hard way, because the left side of the keyboard isn't responding (I can only type on the right side).\nIs it a common problem, or is it just on my machine?\n\nA: Sometimes it can take a while for the sleepimage to make the login/password field active (there should be a blue line round the inside of the box when its active). I've noticed this behaviour in both 10.7 and 10.8 (but not in 10.6) on occasion, but no consistently. Usually when it happens it takes about 10 secs or so before I can type.\nHowever, if you're saying you can type some characters (from the right side of the keyb) but not others (those on the left) that sounds most definitely like a hardware issue. \nTry connecting an external keyboard and seeing if the problem appears on that too. If no, you've a hardware issue. If yes, post back.  \n", "Q: View music size by artist on iOS I'm trying to free up space on an iPhone.

I don't think there's a way to sort by the size of the artist.\nNote, you can only delete items from this list is you are using \"manually manage music\".\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to disable minimising windows with the yellow button in OS X? Coming from the Windows world, I am used to minimising windows in OS X, then using Cmd-Tab to get back to the app to re-open them. However, this doesn't work on OS X, and the approach for re-opening them with Cmd-Tab once minimised is driving me slightly round the bend as I try to contort my fingers into place (plus, I typically forget to do this, then have to go round the Cmd-Tab loop again). Instead, I've taken to hiding windows with Cmd-H when I can, which does work when using Cmd-Tab to get them back again. Nevertheless, I don't always remember to use this, and sometimes minimise them instead.\nIs there a way I can disable minimising windows entirely, ideally by removing or disabling the yellow minimise button from the window header (I don't use ⌘M)? Alternatively, can I convert the yellow button so it behaves like \"hide\" instead? Ideally I'd like to avoid paying money for an add-on, but if there's one that works, that may be an acceptable answer.\n\nA: A couple options:\nAltTab is a free, open source app that makes macOS alt-tab work much like it does on Windows, including maximizing hidden/minimized windows upon selection. It does pretty much what you're asking for out of the box.\nBetter Touch Tool (45 day free trial/$7.50) enables you to map many kinds of reactions to a wide array of events (much more than touch/trackpad related events).\nTo do this with Better Touch Tool: Under the 'Named & Other Triggers' group, you can map a click of the yellow/orange minimize button to the ⌘H keyboard shortcut, so the window is hidden rather than minimized.\nI am not affiliated with AltTab or Better Touch Tool in any way.\n\nA: You can disable ⌘M by running this and reopening applications:\ndefaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add Minimize '\\0'\n\nIf the menu item was assigned to nil, pressing L would trigger it in some applications like Audacity.\nIf you remove Dock.app, the minimize buttons stop working. But it also disables full screen windows, Mission Control, the Notification Center sidebar, the application switcher, Launchpad, and Dashboard, and makes desktop backgrounds gray.\nNuKit can change the zoom and close buttons, but I don't know any application for changing or disabling the minimize buttons. There is another question about it at Super User.\nI didn't find any hidden preferences for it using strings or gdb.\n\nA: If you have some spare money, I might point you at Witch, a $14 app from ManyTricks. It has a direct download that integrates with system preferences, and an app store version.\nhttp://manytricks.com/witch/\nIt doesn't remove minimization like you want, but if I understand the reason for the question, it would work, because it replaces the cmd-tab switcher and Mission Control with something that works in a no-nonsense fashion. I have to admit that I do not own a copy, but it looks very promising and has a full-featured demo. It is very customizable and even has Win7-ish window previews if you're willing to mouse hover. \n", "Q: Facebook app won't load newsfeed when using Wi-Fi on iPhone I am having a problem which has driven me mad for months.

Perhaps there is a charity cause on the store you can fund and then gift an app or two to make up the difference.\nEven large sums can be disposed of with box sets or movie collections that go for between $30 and $130 on iTunes, but this isn't much better than just going shopping for yourself since you need to narrow down cash equivalent into specific app and music sales.\nI've never heard of Apple budging on this requirement when someone asks to have it lifted, and unless they had a system for tracking these \"refunds\" and transfers, it would mess up their accounting for sales / returns in one tax region to shuttle funds from one to another.\nYou could of course ask billing support for the country in which you purchased the gift card account.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/support/itunes/ww/\nPerhaps for amounts more than the price of 5 complete music albums, Apple Support can work some refund out?\n\nA: I have just changed my Country from India to Thailand, as I have moved to Bangkok, Thailand.\nWhen I opened a paid app (e.g. WhatsApp) it said 'buy', then when I clicked on 'buy' it said that this application has already been purchased and you just need to download it again.\nI did the download and it's working.\nAs for the credit card I have not been recharged for last purchases.\nApple has recently updated the feature to make sure if a person moves from one country to another, he/she does not have to purchase the apps again.\n", "Q: Mac Pro can't safe boot I've been trying to solve the issue seen here: \nhttp://www.princeton.edu/~jcjb/docs/osx_error_fix/\nThe recommended solution is to do a safe boot which clears various caches etc, however I'm unable to complete a safe boot.

My corporate center is google apps, so I need to start with contacts from there. However, somehow, I constantly end up with some sync process creating extra copies of my contacts.\nI do not have any contact syncing enabled in itunes.\nOne possible source of distress is that I have two different google accounts: personal and business. The personal account is set to sync contacts via an 'Account' of type 'Exchange', the work ones come in via a card-dav account (I think, the phone doesn't actually tell you what these things are once they exist).\n\nA: You can easily find out where the duplicate contacts come from by going to your Contacts app on your iPhone and tapping on Groups. Then uncheck your Exchange account and see whether the duplicates persist. \nIf you are sure that there are no common shared contacts between your personal and your business accounts (Exchange vs CardDAV), I would suppose the duplication comes at the Mac sync stage.\nSee this for difference between syncing with CardDAV and Exchange. \nIt is true, however, that once shown on your iPhone, you cannot tell the difference between the two just by looking at the contact entry.\n", "Q: show long filenames immediately in Mountain Lion when hovering mouse and key press In Leopard, at the finder, when a file/folder had a long filename (and it truncated it with an ellipsis \"…\"), I just had to press the option (alt) key and hover the cursor on that file/folder, and it would show a tooltip with the full filename.\nIn Mountain Lion (10.8.2) I can't do that, and I haven't found a way to get the full filename without selecting the actual file and going to \"Get Info\".\nSo, is there a way to get the full filename without selecting the file/folder in Mountain Lion just like it could be done in Leopard (immediately get the full filename tooltip via a keyboard key and hovering the cursor over the file/folder)?\n\nA: The tooltips are still shown in column view and icon view if you hover an item for about two seconds (no need to hold option). I don't know about list view though.\nYou can also select an item and press return to enter renaming mode.\n", "Q: Symlinked Movies and Downloads. Restore icons? I've recently replaced the optical drive of my Macbook Pro with an SSD and installed Mountain Lion freshly on there. This leaves the HDD available as well and on by popular suggestion I've symlinked a couple directories. iTunes Media, Movies and Downloads, specifically. Worked fine!\nNow I've ran into a slight inconvenience: the icons and folder name localizations got messed up. Have a look at the screenshot below.\n\nMy system is set up to be Dutch, but as you can see in the screenshot above the Downloads and Movies folders are still English. I did add .localized files to both folders and the actual folders on the HDD did change to localized names (their icons did not change, but then again they're not in a Users directory - only the simlink is).\nThe icons are missing in the Finder side-bar as well, as you can see.\nAny ideas on how I could fix this?\n\nA: I did the same for the applications folder, and the way to get the icon was to copy/paste the original icon to the (new) original folder, the symlink regained the icon automatically and instantly.\nThe name of the symLink can be edited without problem, if it needs to be in the translated version, just translate the symLinked folder.\n", "Q: Is it possible to remove Emergency call feature on the lock screen? Is it possible to remove this feature? It's really annoying when you miss-click on it. Since my iPhone lags a lot this happens too often. \n\n\n*\n\n*iOS version: 4.2.1\n\n*iPhone: 3G\n\n\nA: Unfortunately there is no way to do this in native iOS (without a jailbreak).\nThe emergency call option is available with both the simple and complex passcode. \nI assume the goal is that it would allow anyone to make an emergency call even if they don't know or forgot the passcode, and as a result could be an important safety feature.\nThe only way to disable it is to turn off the passcode - something with obvious undesirable effects.\n", "Q: How do i sync an iPhone 4 (that has never been synced) to a computer without losing all of my pictures and data? I got my iPhone in may, and have never synced it to a computer. I would like to now so that I can out music from my CDs on it. But when my friend synced her iPhone 4 to a computer it erased all of her pictures. What can I do so that doesnt happen?\n\nA: Either iPhoto or Image Capture will let you pull all your photos off the phone to get the safely onto the computer. From there you can store them wherever you want.\nDropBox also has a camera upload function now so you can upload straight to DropBox from the phone, or from the computer when you plug your phone in.\nJust make sure you use iPhoto or Image Capture first when you plug in your phone.\nIf you plug the phone into your computer and set it up with iTunes it might prompt you to reset it to automatically sync with that computer. You can do that after you've removed the photos using iPhoto.\nIf you do sync with iPhoto it'll give you the option to remove the photos from your phone after syncing - that's your choice.\nFinally, if you're worried about losing photos, you can configure iPhoto on your computer to use Photo Stream, and on your iPhone too in the iCloud settings. That'll copy the photos to the cloud, and then iPhoto automatically, so you don't need to plug in your phone to sync each time.\nMost of this assumes you have a Mac computer, btw, you don't make clear whether you're syncing to a Mac or PC.\n\nA: You can use iCloud to sync your data to your PC.Before this, you must set up your iCloud in case it erase your data on your iPhone.\n\nA: You should make sure that you sync it with iPhoto or whatever photo program you have first, and then sync the phone via itunes.  \niTunes might automatically popup and start asking you stuff, but just ignore it and import the photos using some program.\n\nA: Syncing with iTunes shouldn't make any changes to your Camera Roll.\n", "Q: Growl does not pass on Tweets to Notification Center I've recently switched to Mountain Lion, which means that I now have Notification Center.\nI'm using the Twitter app by Twitter, and on my previous system I used Growl to display tweets. Now, however, nothing is showing up. Notification center does not seem to care much for regular tweets (without mentions), and suddenly Growl doesn't show them either.\nA difference with my previous setup is that I downloaded the newest version of Growl now - it has evolved out of a prefpane and is now an app. I did confirm that it worked, though, as a Colloquy (IRC) mention did show up.\nIn the preferences of Twitter I did set 'Tweets' to show via Growl.\n\nA: While creating this question, I figured it out.\nTwitter was not yet listed in the Growl preferences as an app that was outputting to Growl. Simply restarting the Twitter app fixed this. Oddly enough this wasn't necessary for Adium or Colloquy.\n\nWorks fine now! Channeling the notifications to Notification Center strips them of profile images and the Twitter program icon, so I'm sticking to Growl's defaults.\n", "Q: Is it possible to jailbreak an iPad 2 (A1395) after updating to iOS 6.0.1? I have a jailbroken iPad 2 (A1395) running Version 5.0.1 (9A405).\nIf I update to 6.0.1, can I jailbreak untethered?\nWill I have to re-install all my Cydia apps & settings, or do they get backed up and restored?\nConfused by too many Google results!\n\nA: This is no longer true; Both answers were written before evasi0n came out. Now it's more than possible to JB 6.x devices, in fact up to 6.1.1/6.1.2.\nAs for backing up, you don't need to back up Cydia - it gets reinstalled anyway. What I would back up are any manually installed (i.e. hackulous-type) apps you may have (cd to /var/mobile/Applications, then do a tar)\n\nA: Found some good info here as well:\nhttp://www.jailbreakqa.com/questions/119673/jailbreaking-ios-6\nShort answer: No.\n\nA: Dont do it!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nIf you upgrade you will kill any chance (at present of jailbreaking). \nI did mine last year without thinking and have regretted it ever since. stay with ios 5.1.

Whenever I try to drag it, Finder only allows me to copy rather than move.\nI've set the permission of both the sending and the receiving folders to Read and Write for my user, but that did not help. When I try to mv using the Terminal it does work without superuser powers.\n\nA: If the source and the destination of the file is on two different volumes, OS X's default is to copy the file rather than move it. In reality, what you want to do to the file is to copy it to the new location and then delete it from the old, whereas if you move a file to the same volume it's originally on, it will just change the recorded location of the file.\nYou can achieve \"move\" (copy-and-delete) functionality in Finder by holding Command when you drag the file.\n", "Q: Badge disappears for an app after an hour of no usage? I have a todo app that shows a badge indicating how many tasks are due today. For some reason, recently the badge will disappear one hour after I last opened the app. The app has not been updated in months, and I talked with the developers and they can't figure out what the problem might be.\nCould this be somehow a problem with iOS, perhaps? And if so, is there a fix I can perform for it?\n\nA: My understanding of iOS is that apps in the background will be “killed” if the OS runs into memory pressure.  Could it be that after that hour (is it exactly an hour or is the time random), the app gets killed, and the badge goes away?\nYou can test this by ending the app yourself.  With your phone unlocked, double click the home button.  You’ll see the last used apps at the very bottom of your phone.  Hold it for a minute and it’ll start wiggling.  Press the (-) sign and if your badge goes away, you may have found your problem.\nHope that helps.  \n", "Q: Unibody Macbook Stuck on Apple Logo My White, Unibody Macbook running OS X 10.8 started to freeze, so I shut it down. \nWhen I went to restart it, it got stuck on the Apple Logo for some five minutes before I just turned it back off.\nSo far, I have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Checked & Repaired Disk\n\n*Checked & Repaired Permissions\n\n*Reset the NVRAM\n\n*Reset the SMC\n\n*Tried Safe Boot\n\n\nFor Safe Boot, the loading bar appeared and it started to load.

Recently, someone stole a Mighty Mouse that was connected to it. I know the time period when it happened so I was wondering if I can find out what sort of activity was going on during back then. For example, what users were logging in, what apps were they running and when was the last time when this USB mouse was connected. I already went through system and kernel logs and they provide just a bit of useful info. What are the best practices of auditing Mac usage?\nThanks!\n\nA: If you didn't install system accounting on this Mac, there isn't any way\nfor you to get the processes back at the time of this bad event.\nYou can find when this mouse was connected for the last time by searching in the /var/log/kernel.log.\nOn more recent versions of OSX (Yosemite, El Capitan, Sierra) /var/log/kernel.log is merged in /var/log/system.log.\nWithin a terminal or xterm just type:\ngrep -i usb /var/log/kernel.log\n\nor on more recent versions of OSX:\ngrep -i usb /var/log/system.log\n\nIf you need to search back further, just use the compressed and saved previous versions with:\nbzgrep -i usb /var/log/kernel.log.[3210].bz2\n\nor on more recent versions of OSX:\nzgrep -i usb /var/log/system.log.[3210].gz\n\nTo check who was connected on your system, just use the last command.\nIf you want to have a basic auditing function on your system, you may easily start by turning the system accounting on. Here is how to turn it on.\nAll these commande have to be typed with the root account. (Be carefull any typed letter, even a space counts).\n/usr/bin/sudo -s\n[...]\nmkdir /var/account\ntouch /var/account/acct\naccton /var/account/acct\nexit\n\nYou can immediatly check that from now on and forever the kernel is registering any program launched:\nlastcomm\n\nAs a simple example of use, the following command will show you which commands where used since the startup of the kernel accounting:\nlastcomm root\n\n", "Q: Inherit Time Machine Backup Snow Leopard I have a Time Machine backup of a harddisk with Snow Leopard (HD1). The SATA cable for the disk failed and got replaced. The HD was replaced out of precaution as well. The new HD (HD2) got restored from the Time Machine backup, but now if Time Machine is started up again it starts a full backup of the disk, and does not do an incremental on top of the old backups.\nSo the content of HD2 is equal to HD1, but Time Machine thinks otherwise.  \nHow do I force Time Machine to inherit the backups for the new HD?\nAnything related to the Terminal command tmutil does not work as that is only for Lion. This command does not exist in Snow Leopard.\n\nA: I have the same problem, and I'm using Snow Leopard (hate Lion/Mt Lion).  \nI found a discussion and a script at \nhttp://simon.heimlicher.com/articles/2011/02/18/time-machine-volume-uuid\nBut I have not tried it myself just yet.

Is there any native way to do that? Or would I have to write an Apple Script of some sort? I know of an application called, \"Typinator\" that does this, but I don't like the idea of spending money if I don't have to.\n\nA: There are good apps that allow you to set up text expansion with a nice GUI. This is the one I have used and liked:\nDash Expander\nMac App Store Link\nDash Expander handles text expansion very well. I have used it and it works well. The free version:\n\n\"...will nag and annoy you every now and then, in order to purchase.\"\n\nI haven't found these to be that obtrusive. However, as of writing the full version is just $1.99. This also has the ability to set variables. For example, you can set up a boiler-plate thank you note, and just set variables in there that you quickly go through and change to personalize for the recipient.\n\nA: In System Preferences, go to Language & Text and hit the Text tab. The left column is essentially the same as what Shortcuts are in iOS' settings. This has the added advantage of being able to use Emoji.\n\n", "Q: can i close my apple id account and open a new one? My apple id is associated with a .me account that i use for nothing else.  I would like to have an apple id associated with my most active email account (a work account, but i am self employed).

Apps purchased under the .me account?  The last two are not a problem, but the first two are...\nTHanks\n\nA: I believe that contacts and notes can be synched to whatever Apple ID is set up, so changing accounts shouldn't affect these things. You will lose access to any Music, Movies, or Apps bought under the old Apple ID.\n", "Q: Blurry Text on Apple iMac OS X 21.5\" I recently purchased a new iMac which I love except for one sort of big issue - the text is blurry on several programs. At first I thought it was a browser issue when I noticed it in Gmail (using Chrome then Safari) and now I notice it's in other programs/applications on the computer as well. I have tried changing the display settings and nothing seems to help. After doing some searches on this it seems like this is a common issue with Apple. Is this something that Apple users just learn to deal with? It is night and day from my PC where the text was as crisp as can be...I was really looking forward to making this switch but this would be a deal breaker I think.\nHere are some screenshots that I captured:\n\n\n\nA: Both screenshots look normal, but subpixel rendering is disabled in the Pixelmator dialog.\nThere is a hidden preference for using a lighter text rendering style:\ndefaults write -g AppleFontSmoothing -int 1\nsudo defaults write -g AppleFontSmoothing -int 1\n\nThe second command affects the force quit window and login screen. You have to quit and reopen applications to apply the changes.\nOther than that, you can't really change the way text is rendered.\n\nA: Make sure the display is set at 1920x1080, or check \"best for built-in display\" in the display settings. My family's 21.5 iMac had blurry text and it took me awhile to figure out that someone had set the resolution to 1600x900. (or maybe an app had resized the screen, then it didn't get resized back after the app quit?) \n", "Q: How to save sent messages in same folder as message being replied to? One of my favorite features back when I used Outlook was the option to save sent emails in the same folder as the message being replied to. For example, if I had moved a message to folder A and was replying to that, my reply was saved in A, not Sent. (If I replied to a message in my Inbox, my reply went to the default Sent folder.)\nThis made it really easy to see an entire thread when I came back to it later. This workflow is a huge time-saver for me and is the only thing I miss from Outlook. Right now, I manually move sent messages to the folder with related messages which is tedious. Is there a way to recreate this feature from Outlook with Mac Mail? (I'm using Mac Mail 6.2 on OSX 10.8.2).\n\nA: Mail can be extended to mimic pretty closely the feature you mention from Outlook.\nOS X provides a feature called services that can be used to extend the functionality of an application (see http://www.macosxautomation.com/services/learn/index.html for more information).\nI will use Automator and AppleScript to create a service that moves sent messages to the folder of the message being replied to, and then assign the standard reply keyboard shortcut (⌘R) to the service:\n\n*\n\n*Close Mail.\n\n\n*Open Automator in folder Applications and choose Service:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Utilities under Library and drag Run AppleScript to the empty pane on the right:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Configure the service to receive no input in Mail:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace the contents of the Run AppleScript action with:\n on run {input, parameters}\n\n tell application \"Mail\"\n     try\n         (* Get selected messages or exit *)\n         set messageSelection to selection\n         set selectedMessage to item 1 of messageSelection\n         set replyMessage to reply selectedMessage opening window yes\n         set messageID to message id of selectedMessage\n         set currentMailbox to mailbox of selectedMessage\n     on error\n         return\n     end try\n     repeat\n         (* Wait until reply message is sent *)\n         delay 2\n         try\n             if replyMessage is not visible then exit repeat\n         on error\n             exit repeat\n         end try\n     end repeat\n     synchronize with (account of currentMailbox)\n     (* Wait while reply message is being sent *)\n     delay 10\n     (* Loop over all sent messages *)\n     set sentMailbox to sent mailbox of application \"Mail\"\n     set allSentMessages to messages of sentMailbox\n     repeat with sentMessage in allSentMessages\n         if source of sentMessage contains messageID then\n             set mailbox of sentMessage to currentMailbox\n             return\n         end if\n     end repeat\n end tell\n\n return input\n end run\n\n\n\n*Save with a descriptive name like Reply and Move Sent Message to Current Folder. The service will be saved to ~/Library/Services/. This is what the service looks like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences, select the Keyboard preference pane and then the Keyboard Shortcuts tab.\n\n\n*Select Application Shortcuts, press the + button and change for application Mail the shortcut assigned to menu item Reply to ⌥⌘R. We change it to avoid conflicts when assigning ⌘R to the service below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Services, scroll down to the service you previously added and set the keyboard shortcut to ⌘R:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Mail. Notice that Reply's shortcut is no longer ⌘R, but ⌥⌘R:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Also notice that there is a new service, accessible with ⌘R:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Now select a message in a folder, press ⌘R, type your reply and send it, in a few seconds you should see the sent message appear in the folder.\n\nChanging the service to \"Reply All\":\nOlivier has asked in a comment how to expand the Automator Service to reply to the sender and other recipients:\n\n*\n\n*If you are using a recent version of macOS, choose \"Quick Action\" in Automator.\n\n\n*Replace the following line in the AppleScript above:\nset replyMessage to reply selectedMessage opening window yes\n\nwith:\nset replyMessage to reply selectedMessage opening window yes reply to all yes\n\n\n\n*Change the application shortcut for \"Reply All\" (shiftcommandR) to something like shiftoptioncommandR and bind shiftcommandR to the service.\nThe script has some limitations and side effects:\n\n*\n\n*The service can't tell canceled and sent messages apart. So, if you press ⌘R and then change your mind and close the window, the service will continue executing and check your Sent folder for matching IDs.\n\n\n*AppleScript doesn't offer any means of getting a list of replies to a message. My workaround is to get the message id of the message being replied to and search it in the sent messages.\n\n\n*The sent message can't be moved while being downloaded. AppleScript doesn't return any error message if that's the case, so I added a 10-second delay. A 5-second delay was not reliable in my tests, adapt it to your needs if necessary.\n\n\n*While the service searches the Sent folder, Mail slows down.\n", "Q: Possible to use iTunes, Airport Express, and Apple Remote together?

(NOT backup TO an SD card) Time Machine does not allow the inclusion of an SD Card in a backup.  It is automatically listed in the exclusion list and cannot be removed.\nIs there any way to force Time Machine to 'see' the SD Card and back it up?\nI use a 128gb SD Card as additional storage in my MacBook Air and would like to have the data on it automatically backed up to my Time Capsule.\n\nA: Three things will need to come together for this to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Filesystem on the SD card needs a .fseventsd hidden directory and the system to track all changes (which typically gets created automagically when you format the card as HFS+) I haven't seen anyone hack Time Machine to back up filesystems that don't register with Apple's file system events API.\n\n*Make a test backup once you've gotten the filesystem into one that Time Machine supports. You can then check if /Volumes/SD is included in the files for that backup by inspecting the preferences for that backup\n\n*If you need to manually include the system, you can add it by changing either the metadata flag that is causing the item to be skipped or by editing the system exclusion lists.\n\n\nYou will need to pick parts of these two questions and answers to find both the settings for a specific backup as well as where the various system exclusion rules are stored and configured.\n\n\n*\n\n*On OS X, what files are excluded by rule from a Time Machine backup?\n\n*Where does Time Machine store its settings?\nIn short, it might be easier to use rsync or some other tool to copy the SD card contents to a drive that already is being backed up, but as long as you have total control over the drive and the system, you should be able to bend it to your will and get the SD card to be seen and backed up every time it's present and a backup happens.\n\nA: Try reformatting the card as a mac file system, its probably formatted as FAT off the shelf.\nAlso, if you don't mind me asking, why do you need to back up to an SD card? Are they not limited to 64GB? Why not a flash drive?\n\nA: None of this is necessary. Just format the SD Card to Mac and it will automatically include it in your backup. If it doesn't, you will be able to take it off the exclusion list. \n\nA: Fixed in 10.9 Mavericks. Just tested :)\n", "Q: How can I disassociate a single app (e.g., Xcode) from all file types it's mapped to? Every time I get a machine that I install Xcode on, it associates itself with all kinds of filetypes.  E.g., .xml, .rb, even .java!  It's such a nuisance to have to re-associate those file extensions individually.  If I want to open Xcode, I'll open Xcode, but I never want to open Xcode by double-clicking on a script or using open.\nIs there any way to globally disassociate Xcode from all file types?  More generally, is there any way to do this for any app (e.g., QuickTime)?\nPS: I know about How to Change File Type Associations? but this aims at changing one specific association, not disabling them all at once.\n\nA: You could delete the CFBundleDocumentTypes array in the Info.plist, but it is also used to define file types like xcodeproj. It would also invalidate the code signature (so you'd have to enter a password to access keychains), and the changes might get overridden by updates. Some applications like TextEdit crash on launch if the Info.plist is modified.\nTo update the Launch Services database, run /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -R -f /Applications/Application.app/.\nYou could also unregister the application by running lsregister -u -R -f /Applications/Application.app/, but I don't know if it would get registered again at some point. It would also remove the icons of file types defined by the application.\nIf you are looking for a faster way to change default applications, take a look at duti. I have published my configuration file (which includes common code and video file types) here.\n\nA: The only way I can think of doing this is by going to the individual file types and right clicking and going to get info, going down to open with, and clicking the program you want to use and clicking change all. \nAnother way to do this is by right clicking, and holding option and going to always open and clicking the program you want to use\nHope This Helps\n\nA: Actually, I don't think you can.\nSee, OS X make the association by looking into the application's plist file. So you either have to edit that plist file or made changes to the way it detects file type association.\nThere MIGHT be ways to directly manipulate the database, but it might be too difficult. So try this:\nRight click (control-click) on the file belonging to the file type you want to open, and as the contextual menu shows up, hold option. You will see \"Always Open With\", it won't disassociate, but it will change its priority.\n\nA: Your best option would be to maintain a shell script that sets the default applications for particular file types to whatever apps you prefer. You can then run this any time that things change. This is less destructive than editing Xcode itself, and less time-consuming than changing every file type manually.\nSee the top answer here for defaults write commands on com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist. You'll need to know the UTI of the file types and the domain name of the app, (e.g. com.mysoft.myapp.)\n", "Q: G4 files moving to 10.6.8 Coming out of the dark ages....moving my stuff from my old G4 PowerPC 10.5.8 to my recently-inherited MBP with 10.6.8 (intel).  \nHow can I move files from the old G4 to the newer MBP?  I can't use TimeMachine & my new Seagate backup plus because it requires 10.6 or higher.\nCan't use MobileMe because it requires 10.6 or higher.\nThumb drive file transfer is slow and painful.\n\nA: I'd recommend that you use Firewire target disk mode.\nFrom article \"How to use and troubleshoot FireWire target disk mode\" (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1661):\n\nFireWire target disk mode allows a Macintosh computer with a FireWire\n  port (the target computer) to be used as an external hard disk\n  connected to another computer (the host). Once a target computer is\n  started up as a FireWire hard disk and is available to the host\n  computer, you can copy files to or from that volume.\n\nYou basically need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect both computers with a Firewire cable.\n\n*Start your G4 Mac while pressing the T key until a FireWire icon appears.\n\n*Wait until a firewire drive icon appears on your MBP's desktop. Open the drive and copy what you need (probably in /Users/<your username>).\n\n*When you're done, eject the drive as usual (⌘E or drag it to the recycle bin) and power your G4 Mac off.\n\n\nA: I believe there's Migrate Assistant or stuff like that.\nCan you use that? It's slow, but you just gonna have to live with that.\nYou can of course transfer through network, but I doubt if that will be faster than USB/WiFi.\nAnother option is to take the drive off. Which is what I won't do since I don't think it's designed so.\n", "Q: Terrible GUI lag/glitchiness after reboot in Mountain Lion 10.8.2 I got a brand new Retina MacBook Pro (2.6 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 GB RAM, Mountain Lion 10.8.2) a couple months ago, and it was buttery smooth (for the most part) at first. \nHowever, one day I turned it on and I suddenly got some terrible lag issues. For example, when I opened the Notification Center sidebar, it stuttered and chopped on the sliding animation. Similarly, the Genie effect stuttered when I minimized windows. The list just went on and on. At first I thought this was a hardware problem (it also turned out the screen had been mis-aligned), so I brought it to the Apple store. They couldn't find anything wrong with the graphics chip, but it they decided to replace my MacBook because of the bad screen alignment. I got the replacement yesterday. I restored my previous system from a Time Machine backup using the Migration Assistant. Everything was buttery smooth again, and I thought the problem was resolved.\nHowever, this morning, I fired up my MacBook again and all of a sudden, the lag is back. The fact that the lag was nowhere to be found right after the Time Machine restore, but then suddenly back after a reboot is mystifying.\nCan anybody please shed some light on this situation? Thanks!\nUPDATE: I have tried turning off \"Automatic graphics switching\" in the \"Energy Saver\" system preferences, but to no avail.\n\nA: I successfully resolved the glitch/lag problem on my Retina MacBook Pro by re-installing Mountain Lion without use of the Migration Assistant. I have outlined my steps below:\n\n*\n\n*Backed up all my data to an external hard drive\n\n*Completely powered off my MacBook\n\n*Turned on my MacBook while holding down the \"Option\" key\n\n*Entered the Recovery partition\n\n*Used the Disk Utility to reformat my SSD\n\n*Re-downloaded and re-installed Mountain Lion\n\n*When asked if I wanted to use Migration Assistant, I opted out\n\n*Manually reinstalled software, copied over files, etc.\n\nI really think Migration Assitant had something to do with the lag. Either that, or some file or software I had caused the lag, and Migration Assitant simply brought the problem over to my new MacBook when it migrated all my files and settings. In any case, my MacBook Pro is now buttery smooth again, with none of the lagginess and graphics artifacts I had before. I'm happy!\nJust for the record, here's all my MacBook Pro with Retina Display system information:\n\nMid 2012 model, 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 RAM\nOS X version 10.8.2\n\nI hope this helps anyone else with the same problem!\n\nA: I will say backup and reinstall the system, or at least try clean the cache with applications like CleanMyMac or so.\nI myself have experienced several problems with Retina MacBook Pro, so I can feel your pain.\nAlso, check if \"Automatic Graphics Switching\" is enabled under System Preferences - Energy Saver, and your resolution.

What's the easiest way to diagnose the problem? My 2007 Macbook Pro Santa Rosa just developed a problem where it failed to wake from sleep. I power cycled it, and it would not POST. I removed the battery and discharged the capacitors by holding down the power button, but laptop will not POST. The front light on the unit's latch powers on (steady light), there is a noise from the DVD drive as if it's checking for the presence of a disc, and a small amount of hard drive activity, but the display remains off.\nIt's been sitting on my desk for months. There's been no physical or liquid damage to it. I did notice prior to this that the DVD drive would occasionally check for DVD's for no reason (unit was sleeping, suddenly the DVD drive starts making noise), but I figured that had something to do with installing Mountain Lion about 2 months ago, since that's when I started noticing that issue.\nWhat's the best way for me to diagnose the problem (motherboard, power supply, or something else)? I doubt it's worth getting it repaired by Apple, given the age of the unit, but if I can figure out what's broken I might swap out the offending part.\n\nA: The mid 2007 MacBook Pros (MBPro 3,1) and the early 2008 models had defective NVidia GPUs that would cause failures similar to yours. The GPUs would fail at various times (6 months in for some, 3-4 years later for others). When that happened, Apple fixed them without charge.\nIf your MBPro still has its original NVidia GPU, then the problem could very well be that. Unfortunately, Apple's repair extension program for this program ended on Dec 7, 2012.\nYou might be able to find a replacement logic board on eBay or Craigslist.\n\nA: I had this problem with a (currently 9-year-old) Late-2007 MacBook Pro, and found this answer (link below) solved the problem instantly. I never realized that identical-looking Apple AC adapters have different wattages. Look at the tiny print, and if it says \"V = 16.5V, A = 3.65\" then you are using the less-powerful MacBook adapter, instead of the more-powerful MacBook Pro adapter.

device, but the kernel extension may well be running, the better to respond if the modem is plugged in.  If the modem is plugged in but not communicating, the extenion may still be watching for communication to start. \n\nA: I think it's caused by the software or drivers for a USB modem:\n\nBSD process name corresponding to current thread: Mobile Partner\n\nI have a Huawei E367 (which also uses com.huawei.driver.HuaweiDataCardDriver.kext), and I got kernel panics about once per day on my previous Mac.\nThere is alternative software for some USB modems (like CheetahWatch and this fork), but they still use the same drivers.\n", "Q: New harddrive on a macbook pro 13 inch, dvd drive doesn't work, what do? What I don't have:\n\n\n*\n\n*An USB dvd drive\n\n\nWhat I have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Another working, up to date, Macbook (with snow leopard).\n\n*purchased Mountain Lion on the app store\n\n*A desktop PC\n\n*A 4GB usb stick.\n\n*A USB harddrive I'd like not to wipe out entirely.\nMy macbook pro's dvd drive seems busted, I spray some dry air inside and tried to 90 degrees trick, did not work.\nDoesn't apple provide some way to make a bootable usb thing ?\n\nA: There is a few way you can do this from the working MacBook. The first is to follow the tutorial here which will take you through the process of making a bootable USB disk for Mountain Lion.\nThe steps involve\n\n\n*\n\n*Reformat the USB stick to HFS+\n\n*Extract the install image from the downloaded installer\n\n*Write the image to the USB using Disk Utility\n\n\nAlternatively just download the Lion DiskMaker software which will do all the work for you.\nThe only problem I can forsee is that you need an 8GB USB stick for this to work since the OSX installation is bigger then 4GB.\n", "Q: Keep the current audio output device, when attaching a new one I have my TV connected to my iMac via HDMI and speakers hooked up to the iMac via the headphone port.\nWhenever I turn the TV on, the Mac starts playing audio through the TV instead of the speakers and I have to manually switch back.\nIs there any way to make my Mac keep playing through the headphonejack?\n\nA: I use a free app from Rogue Amoeba called SoundSource that lets you quickly pick the source for input, output and system sounds from the task bar. One of the side effects of running SoundSource is your source doesn't change when you connect something new to your Mac. You have to select the new source explicitly via SoundSource to have audio routed to or from it.\nThe source will switch automatically if you remove a source and that source happened to be the currently selected source for any of the channels.\n\n", "Q: How to fix iTunes wrong song time? My mp3 in iTunes shows a time of about 20 minutes, when it really have about 5 minutes. The VLC Player and the Windows Media Player shows the correct time for the same file, what's wrong with my iTunes?\n\nA: How can I fix incorrect mp3 duration @ askubuntu had a couple of command line solutions.\nFor me, the ffmepg solution worked (ffmepg can be installed to OS X with Homebrew, for example):\nffmpeg -i file_orig.mp3 -acodec copy file_fixed.mp3\n\n\nA: The incorrect time is most likely due to an error introduced by the encoding software. You can repair the problem by using the Convert to AAC feature in iTunes.\nIn iTunes 11 this feature can be found under the Create New Version → option of the File menu.\n\nA: Mr. Van Cool's fix did not work.  Jaberg's suggestion worked, but I found an easier way to get to the \"Convert ...\" option.  From the songs menu, right click on the songs with the bad time & \"Convert to AAC\" is in the popup menu.  Fixed 4 songs in under a minute, added the M4A files to my playist, and burning to CD worked as expected.\n\nA: The wrong time duration, is not solved with iTunes 11 and it's not depending from the encoding software (with the new releases of iTunes).\nEven re-loading the file, deleting it form the device, often doesn't sovle the problem.\nthe only one effective solution I found (I got several times this issue) is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the file with iTunes form your device\n\n*Check if the song was really removed from the device, into the device\nitself with iTunes on the iPhone or iPad. If not, touch the title,\nshift your finger to left, and a red rectangle \"DELETE\" will appear\nand touch it.\n\n*Rename the file of the song and re-upload it.\n\n\nThe reason of the 3rd point above is that: I noticed that often, even applying the first 2 points, for some reason (unknown to me), the device still put the old duration and/or old parameters. Changing the original file name, solves the issue.\n\nA: I had the same problem. My track was more than an hour, but it only showed 1h04mins. Converting to AAC or apple lossless didn't work for me.\nFixed it by using this app called Tag Stripper, https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tag-stripper/id432262744?mt=12\n\n\n*\n\n*strip the track of its ID3 tags\n\n*import it fresh into iTunes. Track duration should be fixed now\n\n*cmd+i to edit the id3 tags.\nDone.\nThere might be a simpler way, but this worked for me.\n\nA: What I did is pull up my editing software and cut out the length that was having the problem, and created a new file. Nothing else worked for me.\n", "Q: Hide files/icons on the desktop but not in finder Not sure if something like this exists in OSX. I would like to display a cheatsheet on my desktop as a wallpaper and to make it visible at all times I would like to hide all the icons/files/folders scattered on my desktop as I'm accessing them only from within the Finder anyway. So my question is if it is possible to hide everything on the desktop and show the wallpaper only but use the Desktop folder as normal and see all the files and folders when in Finder view?\nUsing OSX Mountain Lion.\n\nA: There's another little free program that does exactly this, and nothing more:\nhttp://blog.websecurify.com/2013/01/hide-desktop-icons-on-mac-os-x.html\nIt sits in the menu bar and lets you toggle icons on or off.\n\nA: In the terminal, do this:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool false && killall Finder\n\nAfter this, there'll be nothing on your Desktop (but still in ~/Desktop, i.e. your Desktop Folder). It'll look like this:\n\n\nBeautiful, isn't it? If you want to change it back:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool true && killall Finder\n\n\n\nA: I don't believe you can hide files from the desktop while leaving them viewable from within the Finder, since the desktop is just a folder (~/Desktop).\nHowever, here's an alternative that could work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your cheatsheet image in Safari (drag and drop the image onto the Safari icon in the dock)\n\n*In Safari, go to File > Open in Dashboard...\n\n*Your image should be selected/highlighted, or if not, then click it to select it. Click Add in the purple toolbar.\n\n\nThis will create a Dashboard widget that displays your image. Now to view the image, simply toggle Dashboard (F4 on a newer Mac or F12 on an older one).\n\nAnother alternative: if you're not accessing your files from the desktop, why keep them in the ~/Desktop folder at all? Just move them to another folder.\n\nA: You could try using a program called camouflage. It hides all the icons on your desktop. There are older versions available online that may or may not work with Mountain Lion, but it is also available on the Mac App Store, which will work with Mountain Lion\nVersion 1.25 (free - softonic.com) Free, but it may or may not work on Mountain Lion\nVersion 2.2.1 ($5.99 - Mac App Store) Will definitely work on Mountain Lion\nEdit: if you wanted this quick switch functionality, you could write 2 little bash scripts from the top answer and put them in an Automator action and set it to sit in the top bar\n\nA: Another great piece and free piece of software for doing this is XtraFinder.\nhttp://www.trankynam.com/xtrafinder/\nIt can also add to Finder very interesting options like:\n\n\n*\n\n*CMD-X for Cut & Paste\n\n*Create new file (with your favorite templates)\n\n*Arrange folders on top\n\n*Quickly show/hide hidden files with a shortcut\n\n*Tabs\n\n\nAll can be individually enabled.\nIn the various shortcuts you'll find Hide Desktop that is what you need.\nI currently use XtraFinder on ML without issues. It's really light for the OS.\n\nA: You can run the following Terminal command:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool false && killall -HUP Finder\n\nTo undo, replace false with true.\nSource: OS X Daily: Hide All Desktop Icons — No idea if it is Mavericks only.\n\nA: I'm not sure if this exactly meets your criteria, but Desktop Curtain from Many Tricks is a neat app that hides your messy desktop. $5 in the Mac App Store. \n\nA: Here's another FREE app that almost does what is requested. Instead of toggling the internal Finder default value and then killing and restarting Finder, it moves everything on the desktop into another folder and moves it all back again. Unfortunately that does not meet the original requirement of preserving access to the contents of the system Desktop folder while the icons are hidden.\nhttp://www.shirt-ediss.me/clarity/\nIf that access is not a hard requirement, Clarity has much to recommend it. First, it does not require killing and restarting Finder, which can take a disturbingly large number of seconds. Second, it can be used to save multiple alternative desktop icon sets.\nIt allows you to save the current desktop arrangement of files, folders, shortcuts, etc by number and name, clear it, and then restore it, or swap to any of the saved arrangements. The saved desktops can be saved to Dropbox to make them available on other machines.\n", "Q: A true large image viewer for OS X? Are there any image viewers out there that can navigate a truly massive (i.e. 500 megapixel/250MB) JPEG image? Everything but Preview has crashed for me.\nPreview does OK, but doesn't have many features.\n\nA: I'm not sure what your requirements are, Preview always does ok for me. However I heard that Xee is more powerful and some people prefers it.\n", "Q: Extract Camera Roll from iTunes backup I had to restore a friend's iPod because they forget their passcode and they lost their camera roll. I can't restore FROM a backup, as the backup has the forgotten passcode on it.\nAnyways, on my Mac I looked under ~/library/application support/MobileSync/Backup to find some hashed folder with a  boatload of hashed files and a couple .plist's saying it was indeed a backup.\nMy question is- I am sure these photos are in this folder hashed somewhere.. how can I get them out?\nThanks :)\n\nA: There are third-party applications such as iBackupViewer and iPhone Backup Extractor that will read those backup files. \nAlso, if by any chance Photostream was turned on, those photos are on somebody's Mac, hiding in\n~/Library/Application Support/iLifeAssetManagement/assets/sub \n\nA: iPhone Backup Viewer shows everything in the backup and will save the photos (and anything else) to the folder you specify.\nDonation-ware at http://www.imactools.com/iphonebackupviewer/ \n\nA: Here I recommend you MyJad iTunes Photo Extractor* to help you extract camera roll you want back.\n[*]: Commercial software, trial available.\n", "Q: Selecting a SSD for Fusion Drive My aging Early 2009 Macbook White is getting a bit long in the tooth, so  after learning about Fusion Drive, I'm considering combining the existing 500GB HDD with a budget-to-medium-class SSD drive, to prolong the life of the machine.\nAs far as I understand, Fusion Drive will fill up the drive to within 4-5 GB of its capacity. \nIn other news I read that some mainstream SSD controllers (eg. Sandforce) have very poor write performance when the disk is used to its full capacity.\nSo my questions are:\nIs the \"fullness\" of a Fusion Drive SSD considered \"full capacity\" in the context of controller performance degradation? \nWhich aftermarket SSDs are supposed to perform consistently fast in the Fusion Drive scenario? So far I have looked at Samsung 840, OCZ Vertex 2, Agility 3, Intel 330, based on a combination of price, brand reputation and reviews - but several of them are Sandforce drives.  \nThirdly, does it make sense to create an empty 8-10 GB partition on the SSD before creating the Fusion Drive, to keep the drive from filling up? And is it even possible to create a Fusion Drive on a partitioned SSD?\nCheers!\n\nA: *\n\n*It is pretty close to \"full capacity\" (the first 117 of 128 GB are filled), but SSDs do overprovisioning for this reason.\n\n*As long as you have enabled TRIM on your SSD, you should be fine. I keep my (non-Fusioned Crucial RealSSD 300) SSD near full capacity and don't experience degradation, as long as I have TRIM turned on (if it's turned off it gets terrible fast).\n\n*Yes, you can create a Fusion Drive by specifying the partitions, e.g.:\ndiskutil cs create fusion /dev/disk0s2 /dev/disk1s2\nIf you are looking for non-Sandforce controlled devices, you have many options now: Crucials M4/M500, Samsung SSDs, OCZ Agility/Vertex 4, and more.\nFor further reading, check out AnandTech's article with more details and pretty graphs.\n", "Q: Diagnosing Unrecognized Hard drives I have a macbook pro 13 late 2011. My setup: i have a HDD in the main bay for my files, and a SSD in the optibay with the OS on. The other day i received the message randomly out of the blue which states along the lines of \"External drive was unsafely removed\" (this was concerning the main bay drive). Ever since i havent been able to see my file drive. \nI have tried removing the drive and reseating with along with the SATA cable to the logic board. I have also tried the HDD on a different machine and the same mac in a enclosure, both didnt recognize the drive. I have also tried perfectly good tested drives in the main bay and they weren't recognized either.\nBecause my other drive in the optibay is working, im thinking the logic board is ok, but potentially have a dodgy cable and HDD in the main bay?\nCan anyone help me narrow down the issue? Or is the next step to try replace the sata hd cable to the logic board, and try a different hard drive.\nThanks for your time.\n\nA: You said that the drive doesn't work with other Macs or in an external enclosure, so the problem is unlikely to be a dodgy cable on your MacBook Pro. If the drive doesn't work with any computer, it's most likely dead. \nAt lot of OEM drives have 3-year warranties from the drive manufacturer. Your drive may still be under warranty so I would contact the company and do a warranty claim.\nAlso, definitely get a known working drive and see if it works with your MBPro.\n\nA: If you have access to a PC, then Spinrite is a powerful tool for diagnosing and repairing hard disks. You'll have to remove the drive, put it the PC and reboot. If the disk is fine or repairable, you'll know.\nhttp://www.grc.com/spinrite\n", "Q: brew doctor get warning on opencv i'm new to mac os x. i read that homebrew is a good packet manager and i have tried it.\ni have also read that to install opencv 2.4 i have to follow those steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*install cmake via homebrew\n\n*download opencv\n\n*cmake, sudo make\n\n\nand i have done it. now i have fully python wrapper in my mac os x. but now if i write brew doctor i have those warnings:\nbrew doctor\nWarning: /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig isn't writable.\nThis can happen if you \"sudo make install\" software that isn't managed\nby Homebrew.\n\nIf a brew tries to write a .pc file to this directory, the install will\nfail during the link step.\n\nYou should probably `chown` /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig\nWarning: Unbrewed dylibs were found in /usr/local/lib.\nIf you didn't put them there on purpose they could cause problems when\nbuilding Homebrew formulae, and may need to be deleted.\n\nUnexpected dylibs:\n    /usr/local/lib/libopencv_calib3d.2.4.2.dylib\n    /usr/local/lib/libopencv_contrib.2.4.2.dylib\n    /usr/local/lib/libopencv_core.2.4.2.dylib\n    /usr/local/lib/libopencv_features2d.2.4.2.dylib\n    /usr/local/lib/libopencv_flann.2.4.2.dylib\n    /usr/local/lib/libopencv_gpu.2.4.2.dylib\n    /usr/local/lib/libopencv_highgui.2.4.2.dylib\n    /usr/local/lib/libopencv_imgproc.2.4.2.dylib\n    /usr/local/lib/libopencv_legacy.2.4.2.dylib\n    /usr/local/lib/libopencv_ml.2.4.2.dylib\n    /usr/local/lib/libopencv_nonfree.2.4.2.dylib\n    /usr/local/lib/libopencv_objdetect.2.4.2.dylib\n    /usr/local/lib/libopencv_photo.2.4.2.dylib\n    /usr/local/lib/libopencv_stitching.2.4.2.dylib\n    /usr/local/lib/libopencv_ts.2.4.2.dylib\n    /usr/local/lib/libopencv_video.2.4.2.dylib\n    /usr/local/lib/libopencv_videostab.2.4.2.dylib\nWarning: Unbrewed .pc files were found in /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig.\nIf you didn't put them there on purpose they could cause problems when\nbuilding Homebrew formulae, and may need to be deleted.\n\nUnexpected .pc files:\n    /usr/local/lib\n\n/pkgconfig/opencv.pc\nWarning: You have unlinked kegs in your Cellar\nLeaving kegs unlinked can lead to build-trouble and cause brews that depend on\nthose kegs to fail to run properly once built.

This can occur moving a file to or from a USB disk, a FW800 disk, a samba share, a netatalk share.  \nFor instance, here is the latest error: \"The Finder can't complete the operation because some data in \"Fedora-18-x86_64-DVD.iso\" can't be read or written. (Error code -36)\"  \nI know the data is not corrupt because I can use rsync to copy this file to the exact same destination and it will succeed, just that finder will fail to copy it.  I've also used the same file to install a vm which worked fine as well as moved the file with a USB stick which for no apparent reason succeeded.  On top of that when I share out files using SMB from the same Mac and try to move the file from a windows server the connection will hang up halfway through the copy for no apparent reason.  Is anyone aware of a larger bug or problem with large files in 10.8?\n\nA: We had the same problem.  Communication stops briefly on extended transfers of any kind.  \nI contacted Apple Senior support who were actually able to reproduce the problem. I was told that Apple will release an update after they solve the issue.\nObviously until then we all must wait. \n", "Q: Imported contacts are empty I have an odd problem. I got an iphone5 and of course, I want all my contacts from my nokia into my iphone, I imported the contacts into outlook, then exported to an csv file, then imported to gmail and it worked perfectly until that point. When I imported the gmail contacts to my iphone, all the names were there, but barely any mobile numbers. However, in my gmail profile everythings seems to be ok, so I doubt that there is a field organisation problem.\nIf anyone has an idea, please help me, that thing is driving me crazy!\nThanks!\n\nA: I found out what was wrong. It seems the phone number types were the problem. They were classified as \"Other\". I changed them all to \"Mobile\" and it worked.\nI hope this helps somebody, because I looked the problem up for hours and didn't find a solution.\n\nA: Instead of passing through Outlook and Gmail to transfer nokia contacts to your iphone - i'd simply use the Nokia Desktop Sync sofware to export the nokia contacts to your pc then import the contact files from the PC to the iPhone using an app to import contacts to iPhone. \n", "Q: How to map Caps Lock as a second Control Key on a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000? I've got a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000, with the latest IntelliType drivers installed. There is an option to swap a Caps Lock and a Control key in the Microsoft Keyboard preferences pane, but no way to use Caps Lock as a second Control key. \nChanging the Modifier Keys in System Preferences > Keyboard helps, but resets after the restart. Reset happens only when Microsoft Keyboard Helper is launched. These settings were always saved after the restart with another third-party keyboard I've been using before.\nUsing ControllerMate helps, but it's slow, buggy and, obviously, a huge overkill for my needs.\nKeyRemap4MacBook and PCKeyboardHack are not working. I guess Microsoft Keyboard driver overrules them.\nRepairing permissions does not help either.\n\nA: Two months went past, and a \"legitimate\" solution is nowhere to be seen. Fortunately, there is a simpler and a more radical way to solve this, and all related issues — getting rid of the crappy Microsoft drivers completely. Caps Lock, and other modifier key mappings, are easily changed in the \"Keyboard\" preferences. Play/Pause, Volume and Mute keys are working perfectly.\nAll of the other media keys, and the \"Zoom\" slider are predictably dead, but I've never used them anyway. The \"Application\" or \"Menu key\" is mapped to ⌘ with KeyRemap4MacBook.\n", "Q: How can I access to internet in iPhone 4 with USB or other way through my mac book pro? I have a iPhone 4 and Mac book pro. I am accessing internet in Macbook through dsl modem lan. But I don't know how to access internet in iPhone.\nMy specific question is there any way to access internet through USB or any other way with through my mac book pro????\n?\n\nA: You can do this by sharing your MacBook Pro's internet connection - typically called an ad-hoc network.\nYou will need to connect your USB aircard, and then open System Preferences > Sharing > Internet Sharing. (From this Apple Forum post) Select USB from the drop down menu next to \"Share your connection from:\". Then select the \"Wifi\" from the checkboxes below. Check the Internet Sharing option to the left, then join it with your iPhone.\nHere is an Apple KB support article that you may find helpful in setting up an ad-hoc network. While you are using USB the steps in this OSX Daily article should be very similar to your situation.\n\nA: Without a Jailbreak you can be sure that you can't connect to the internet trough USB. iOS devices need either Celular network or Wifi. \n", "Q: Macbook Pro: Two displays - two different full screen applications Is it possible to display two different applications on two displays in \"extended\" mode.\nWhat i mean: \nXcode and Google Chrome have a button \"arrows\" in the top right corner. \n\"On click\" mac create a desktop, named \"application\" (Google Chrome or Xcode).\nI want to display both of them in full screen mode on two displays.\nIs it possible?\n\nA: At the moment this isn't possible.\nYou can only have one full screen application running at a time when using full screen mode, irrelevant of how many monitors you have. With Lion you could only have the full screen application on the primary display and with Mountain Lion it was changed to allow the full screen up on any of the monitors connected to your machine.\nI suspect this feature might be introduced in the next version of OSX.\n", "Q: How to enable CTRL+4/5/6?

For a psychology experiment a friend of mine is looking for a possibility to show phrases on an iPad screen which can be controlled from outside. (Laptop, second iPad)\nThere will be around 100 Phrases (probably on slides). And the it should be possible to make the iPad jump to any slide but without interacting with it.\nAny ideas how this could be achieved?\n\nA: Your friend could set up a Keynote presentation on the iPad.\nThe Keynote presentation can then be remote controlled from the second iPad with Keynote Remote:\n\nKeynote Remote lets you control a Keynote presentation on your Mac, iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch from another iPhone or iPod touch in the room.\nWhile you present, view your current slide and presenter notes in portrait, or the current slide and next slide in landscape. Swipe forward to advance and swipe back to return to the previous slide.\n\nAs for randomizing, this won't be easily possible with Keynote—you can only script it with AppleScript on a Mac, but there are apps like Screens and others that would turn the iPad into a remote screen for a computer so you could do your randomizing and controlling remotely.\nA custom web app or setting up a web server that cycled among random images each time you tapped the screen would be also inexpensive to code, but it's not really using presentation software and you'd need to have a remote to toggle the change if touching the screen was really not an option.\n", "Q: How to disable Gatekeeper alerts on opening text files synced with Dropbox?

My iPhone 3GS has made the text message sound twice at like 3:30 am but when I look at it there is no text. \nThis is hard to explain to my husband, it's making us both paranoid! Can I look somewhere to figure out what's happening?\n\nA: It sounds like you have another app that may be giving you untimely notifications. You can check by opening Settings.app > Notifications. Scroll through that list and tap on each application that you don't want sound notifications on. Scroll down slightly and turn Sounds off. \nUnfortunately, there appears to be no (easy) way to look up notifications logs. I say easy, because notifications logs should be accessible with a jailbreak, however, as of writing, there is no jailbreak available for iOS 6 - if you have that installed.\nAs a last resort, if you are on iOS 6, you can also schedule Do-Not-Disturb times, from when you go to bed to when you get up. One thing you could do to verify that it is indeed the text tone, is change the text tone to something different. If the different sound goes off at night again (or anytime without a text message actually appearing to come in), that would narrow it down to it indeed being a pseudo-text-notification. At that point, Do-Not-Disturb, would seem like a reasonable \"hack\". \n\nA: This is caused by a notification from an app (not a text) and only happens if you've turned off the ability for an app to show you alerts (either banner or popup) but NOT disabled sounds at the same time (in my opinion, Apple should not permit this as it makes no sense to have your phone set up like this).\nTo fix this: \nIn your notification preferences, check all the apps and see if any are in this state. If they are, enable the alert popup (or disable sounds) and this should fix your problem. \n\nA: IOS 7 -> Turn the repetitive text message notification :\nSettings -> Notification Center -> In include Messages -> Scroll down to find the Repeat alert option and switch it to \"Never\"\n\nA: This worked for me.  is the text message preceded by a 'half moon'?\nyou may have 'Do Not Disturb\" on.  I didn't but when I pressed \"Details\" for that caller, (upper right hand corner of the text screen)  I found that I had the 'Do Not Disturb' button turned on.\n\nA: Could be a hidden folder excepting messages ( with a password) so no one can read messages! Except of course the person who has the password.

Is my warranty valid outside of the US? I won't have to ship it back will i? (that would be a major setback...)  \n\nA: TL;DR - Yes, the warranty is international, but you may have to pay shipping and wait longer for service if Apple USA can't find a local provider and/or you can't find a local provider for service while in Brasil.\n\nWhat holds true is an owner always can contact AppleCare for the country in which the Mac was first sold. In this case, a web query or phone call to the US offices of AppleCare are your best options from Brasil unless you can find a local service provider that will honor Apple's US warranty.\nMost of the time, Apple providers get paid enough and are happy to get reimbursed directly from Apple and can rapidly determine warranty coverage from your serial number, but that's really up to each local service provider to decide if and when they will do the work to accept a cross-border repair.\nI can't make a blanket statement that all will say no or yes since it'll be somewhere in the middle most of the time. \nCheck here for worldwide options - https://locate.apple.com/country and here for options within Brasil - https://locate.apple.com/br/pt/\n", "Q: Access applications and their folders from terminal I have a folder that I want to init with git, but to do that I have to 'navigate' to that folder using cd.

Generally, Game Cube controllers aren't straightforward to use on modern computers, and if the drivers aren't compatible with Macs, they simply have no way of working. I do however encourage you to try, it must be quite cool to use the old GameCube controller with your Mac.\nNow, I don't know what you need to do this for, but if it's just for regular gaming, I suggest you buy a cheap USB-controller for this purpose, or use a PS3-controller via Bluetooth. \n", "Q: Can I install my old OSX on a different computer after upgrading?

Or can I down the same copy of Mountain Lion from the App Store on both computer and install?\nThank you in advance, any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes, depending on the hardware of the other computer and the type of Snow Leopard disc you have. For example, if your existing computer is an iMac, and the other computer is a Mac Mini, and the Snow Leopard disc you have is the disc which came with your iMac this might not work. Many OS / recover disc which come with a Mac will only work on that model. The only way to know if this will work is to test it.\n\n*When you install Mountain Lion, you will have the option to Upgrade, keeping all your applications, users, and most of your settings, or Archive and Install which will keep a copy of your current system (which you cannot easily roll back to) but do a clean install. You can also Erase and Install where you will lose everything.

Even 720p content is almost 1 million pixels per frame; 24 bits per pixel at 60fps is 180Mbps, which is clearly impossible. So how is the data transferred? \nSome guesses:\n\n\n*\n\n*Heavy compression. \n\n*Apple video playing APIs, which send the compressed stream is sent to the Apple TV, for the Apple TV to decode itself\n\n*Apple video playing APIs, which send a URL of the data location to the Apple TV. \n\n\nA: The video is not sent pixel by pixel, but is encoded with a suitable video compression algorithm specifically designed to use much less bandwith while still being able to reproduce the original video faithfully to the human eye.\nWithout having investigated a suitable guess would be that the h264 encoding is used.\n\nA: AirPlay sends MP3, AAC and H.264 compressed data directly to receivers, thus a very high compression in some cases and very good for the rest.\nApple'd developer documentation covers the basics as well as some tips for preparing content so that it streams/forwards well.\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/AirPlayGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html\nThe decoding of the streams is done by a chip (and encoded as well - the same on iOS as on OS X) so you can see which devices support AirPlay and deduce which GPU and CPU families have the hardware to do this both rapidly and in the case of iOS with low power usage.\nThis iOS support matrix is very handy to see each iOS version and the CPU/RAM for various models even though it doesn't call out AirPlay support specifically.\n", "Q: Which Macbooks charge the fastest? Is there any difference in the number of hours different generations and models of MacBooks take to \"fast-charge\" to 80%, or to fully charge?\n\nA: All Apple products tend to finish the quick charge in just under 2 hours and reach full charge capacity just after 4 hours have passed.\nLook at http://www.apple.com/batteries/ where this nice chart explains the charging curves in terms of voltage rise and current flow over time from empty to full.\n\nAs your battery ages, the charging does deviate from this curve and of course the 85 Watt adapter on a 15\"/17\" MacBook Pro is sending more current to a larger battery, but in the end, the stock new charging performance of all Apple products (iOS/iPod/portable) are designed to meet these times by changing the internal circuitry and power sources.\nFaster charging is clearly possible, but degrades the life of the battery so my observation is that Apple controls the charge rate by having a charge controller that slows it down to meet these target times. \n", "Q: Downside of manual shutdown I've been using shutdown -h now in the terminal to turn off my iMac (sooo much faster than waiting for every program I use to close out), and I wondered if there were any downsides to shutting down this way. \nEdit: \nFor those who care, i've been shutting down manually for a month or two now, and it doesn't seem to have affected my system/workflow at all. Definetely something to approach on system by system basis, but it's pretty awesome being able to shut down in 2 seconds without having to do the \"program X has cancelled shutdown\" rodeo. \n\nA: Yes, there are a number of downsides!!!\nThe reason this is faster is it's not as clean. When you choose \"Shut Down\" from the Apple menu, the OS sends an Apple Event to every running application asking it to quit. (Specifically, the quit Apple Event) If you have unsaved work, these apps will respond to this event by prompting you to save.\nWhen you use /sbin/shutdown no apple events are sent! Instead, POSIX signals (specifically the TERM signal) are sent to every app. This tells the process to quit now, is likely to result in lost data because apps may not prompt you to save.\nUsing the \"Shutdown\" menu might present a dialog alerting you that certain applications have \"canceled\" the shutdown. This is a safety feature in case they have unsaved data. This will not happen with /sbin/shutdown. Any apps which don't respond to a TERM signal will be sent a KILL signal, which will forcibly terminate the app.\nIf you use \"Legacy Filevault\" (The version of Filevault where only your home directory is encrypted), then using the \"Shutdown\" command will initiate the process which frees up unused disk space in your \"sparse bundle\", the files which store the encrypted data for your home directory. /sbin/shutdown will not trigger this process.\nThere can be other unforeseen consequences as well. The outgoing firewall Little Snitch used to lose the firewall configuration when using /sbin/shutdown... they may have corrected this in later versions, but I know it was an issue last time I checked.\nIn summary, /sbin/shutdown will shut down the sore of the OS: it will flush disk buffers, and request (the POSIX way) that processes terminate, so you're not likely to experience disk corruption or serious side effects from using it. But it will not perform higher-level functions (like sending Apple Events) and therefore it is not the preferred way to shut down an OS X system. (But it's still far better than just killing the power)\n", "Q: Are old unused macbook batteries ok? I'm considering buying a Geniuine Apple Macbook Pro (2007) battery on ebay.  This is NOT an OEM knockoff, and the battery is still sealed in original plastic, but I have no idea when the battery was manufactured.\nIf the battery was made, say 5 years ago, is it likely to perform almost as well as one that was recently manufacurerd?\n\nA: The short answer would be no. A 5 y.o. battery won't last as long as a new(er) one. However, depending on if the original owner followed Apple's care instructions, and it doesn't have a high cycle count, it may not be much lower.\nA lot of it depends on the care the battery was given. If the battery has just been sitting in a box this whole time, it's performance may be lower. Batteries need their \"juices\" (electrons) flowing in order for them to stay healthy. \nOn the other hand you have cycle count. A battery only can handle so many cycles before it wears out. Simply put, the higher the cycle count, the lower the performance.\nApple recommends storing a battery at 50% for extended periods of time. If it's fully charged or discharged when stored, this will again affect battery life.\nHere is a comprehensive guide to Apple notebook batteries.\nOf course, all this doesn't count any engineering changes that may have been made for the better in newer batteries.\n\nA: The answer is it depends. One factor is how many charge cycles have already been used. Under Apple -> About This Mac, click the More Info button. There is a way to get a system hardware report, which includes battery information. 1,000 is the general rule of thumb for maximum cycle count.\nMy MacBook Pro that I bought in October has 25 cycles on its battery.\nThe question is whether you can find this out before you buy it.\nCan't delete my answer since I'm new here, but I missed a very important piece of information.  Anything else I might say in terms of what to expect from an older battery would be mostly speculation.\n", "Q: Does AirPlay Use Wi-Fi? I was curious how AirPlay worked and if it uses my Wi-Fi router, or some other technology?\nI was trying to use AirPlay with my 2011 MacBook Air and the new Apple TV and it was a bit laggy. Would a router upgrade improve the situation?\n\nA: AirPlay goes through your local network, whether that's over Wi-Fi or wired ethernet or both.\nTo resolve your problems, you should probably clarify what you mean by \"laggy\".\nLatency (Delay)\nThere is some latency (delay between when your Mac sends a signal and when it's displayed) inherent in the AirPlay technology, which can be compounded by latency in Wi-Fi. For something like playing a movie, a few hundred milliseconds of latency isn't a big deal, but it can be if you're trying to use it for something more interactive (e.g. a presentation, gaming, etc.).\nThe best way to reduce latency is to use wired instead of wireless networking, however given the limitations of AirPlay, it may not be sufficient for some intended uses (like gaming).\nOther Issues\nIf you're experiencing poor quality or videos having to buffer, that's likely a problem with bandwidth, rather than latency. In this case, the issue could be your router — some simply have higher throughput than others, but it could also be an issue with the environment around you. The more Wi-Fi networks and other EM interference, the worse your signal will be. The construction of your house can also be a problem.\nA better router can help in some, but not all situations — if the environment isn't conducive to good Wi-Fi (long range, lots of other networks, or thick walls), then a better router may not help. A wired network can help, and will certainly be more reliable.\nThere's no surefire way to know what your issue is without a bit of trial and error. If a wired network is possible, that will guarantee the best speed and reliability, but if you're looking for low latency over AirPlay, it may not be enough.\n", "Q: Permission denied error when opening Terminal I'm using a clean install of 10.8.

After the lengthy installation was finished I created a DMG backup of all the partitions using the Mac's built in disk utility. The recovery image is currently 865.5MB large and seems to contain the correct information.\nI am currently attempting to restore this image onto another SD card to ensure the recovery process will work appropriately. To perform this action I went into disk utility under the restore tab and entering the appropriate fields. I selected the DMG recovery file as source while selecting the SD card bay as the destination. All seemed to be working since disk manager prompted me if it was alright to fully erase the SD card as well as my root password for permissions. However, my victory was short lived as it promptly showed me this error: Recovery Error: Could not validate source - Invalid argument. I guessed that the source was incorrect, so I tried opening the DMG and providing the virtual drive as the source. However the same error persists.\nSince this card contains three partitions with one being a blessed bootable partition, I would like to see if there are any ways to get my Mac to generate these for me.

I'm buying a gift that requires an iPod 3 or newer and I'm trying to get my brother to tell me what kind of iPod he has, but he is unable to open the case it's in.\nHow can he, using software, tell me what kind of iPod Touch he has?\n\nA: Plug the device into any computer with either iTunes or the iPhone configuration utility and it will tell you the model, serial number and much more about the device. Both software packages run on Mac and Windows and are a free download from Apple.\nAn alternate method of determining whether the Phillips Hue app will run is to have them download that app since the App store includes built in checks to ensure the device meets the app's minimum requirements. I could see how this might not be ideal if part of the gift is to be a surprise that downloading the app might spoil.\n\nA: You can easily check the model of the device using information found in Settings > General > About and a simple Google search..\n\nOpen the Settings app and select General.\n\n\nFrom the General pane select About.\n\n\nScroll down in the About pane until you find the Model.\n\n\nType the model number into a Google search box. That should be sufficient, but you can add additional search terms like Apple or iPod Touch if need be.\n\nA: If you get the serial number from Settings->General->About, you can enter the last four digits on this website to learn about the model number.\n\nA: If the device runs, or can run iOS 5, or 6, then you can use it with that product.\nOnly 1st and 2nd generation iPod Touch cannot run iOS 5+. 3rd, 4th, and 5th generation can run iOS 5, and 6, respectively. \nDetermine what iOS version it is currently on by opening Settings.app > General. If the second table cell says \"Software Update\" the device is running iOS 5+. \nThe concrete way to find exactly which version would be to go Settings.app > General > About > Version.\nNote: If it is isn't running iOS 5+, plug it into iTunes to see if it is eligible for an upgrade. If iTunes says something like iOS 4.3.1 under Summary and doesn't give an option to upgrade, the it is a 1st or 2nd gen - incompatible. \n\nA: If you can look at other physical features of the device it is possible to tell.Start by looking to see if it has a camera (front or back). If it does you are fine because only the 4th and 5th generation (the larger 16:9 one) iPod Touches have cameras. If it is a 64GB model (\"Settings\" -> \"General\" -> \"About\" -> \"Capacity\", will be not quite 64 but close) then it is at least a 3rd generation. If all else fails go to \"Settings\" -> \"General\" -> \"About\" -> \"Model\", the 3rd generation's numbers end in 086LL\n, 008LL, or 011LL.\n", "Q: How do I delete a phone number from iMessage or facetime on ipod 4th gen? My son has an iPod touch 4th gen. My mother in-law has a new iPhone. He logged into his iTunes account with his grandmother's phone so he could download a song for her. After that, she began receiving his facetime messages. I removed his email address from her iPhone and that stopped. But now, her phone number is displayed in his settings/message and setting/facetime under send & receive/you can be reached at. How do I delete her number?\n\nA: Using the device attached to the phone number, make sure you're not on wifi and that you are using the network to which your number is registered. Turn off iMessage in the messages settings. That should do it.\n", "Q: Skewed Log In Screen When Screen Sharing Trying to use a Mac Pro as a headless media server. Worked just fine when I had a monitor or TV hooked up to it, but now that I've tried to remove a monitor and use it headless, I get a skewed log-in screen and an unusable operating system.\nHere's what it looks like when I screen share from my rMBP (though the problem is not unique to my rMBP, I also get the same look from VNC on my iPad, an older iMac, and a non-retina Macbook Pro):\n\nI've tried resetting my com.apple.windowserver.plist, among other ideas. Screensharing returns to normal function if I plug in a monitor for even a short moment. Somehow I am getting a problem with the default resolution when using the Mac Pro without a screen.\nAny ideas would be greatly appreciated, thank you.\n\nA: Reconnect the monitor.  On the Mac Pro, set the resolution to a lower setting (as a test to the lowest possible one).  Then try again with the monitor disconnected.\nIf it works, you can then increase the resolution.\nI've had similar problems happen several times over the years.  Sometimes connecting a display adapter to the video card (even though it is not connected to anything) will fool the video hardware into working properly.\n", "Q: iMessage frozen/crashing I have an iPod Touch 5th gen and I sent a really long emoji message to my friend and both our iPods froze!

After seething my iPad and restoring it through icloud I still wouldn't work but what did work was going to a random contact and clicking send message, it opens iMessage right up and I was able to delete my conversation that was causing the problem!\n\nA: Sounds like you are stuck resetting, then restoring your iPod.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off iMessage. The goal is that in the software restore, iMessages won't come back. This is the part that is pretty much up to you. You could leave it on and restore, and hope for the best, or turn it off with hopes that iMessages are cleared. \n\n*Backup your device - preferably to iCloud.\n\n*Go to Settings.app > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings.\n\n*\n\n*IMPORTANT: Make sure you have at least one good backup, whether iCloud or iTunes. If you backup for the first time to iCloud just then, it may take awhile. It may take 1-4 hours and maybe more. \n\n\n*After the device has been reset, restore the data (refer to the linked articles above). \n\n\nThe goal is that the iMessages won't be restored. However, it is very possible they will be. If the Messages app continues to freeze your last resort may be to start the device over (reset without restoring). Note: if it comes to that all your app data (game scores and such) will be lost.\n\nA: I had the same problem, and found this solution online.  Worked for me: {You can press on the contacts app, press a contact, and then press the message button. Then you will be taken into iMessage and you can text again!}\nOnce in, delete the culprit message and all should be good to go.\n\nA: Resetting* but just wanted to let you know that it's easy to fix\n\nA: Had the same problem here on my iPad mini, here is how to fix it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Keep turning iMessage off and on\n\n*Then shut down your iPad by holding the power off button \n\n*Wait for ten minutes \n\n*Turn it back on by holding the off button\n\n*Wait until the home screen will show up\n\n*Now go to settings and turn off Facetime, iMessage, WiFi\n\n*Go to airplane Mode and turn that on\n\n*Shut down ur iPad by holding the off button\n\n*Wait for fifteen minutes\n\n*Restart the iPad by holding the power button\n\n*Now turn off airplane mode\n\n*Turn on FaceTime and iMessage and Internet/wifi \n\n*Go to the iMessage icon\n\n*Click edit at the top left corner\n\n*There will be red circles with minuses on them \n\n*Click the red circle by the messages u sent to ur friend \n\n*Now click delete \n\n*iMessage will not freeze again\n\n\nA: My iPod kept shuting down and it wouldn't open the iMessages app. (My friend tryed sending me a photo that you can't have on your iPod only on your iPhone) So I tryed shutting off iMessages but it did nothing I went to a contact that I never messages and pressed send message and you can click cancel and delet it from there. \nHope this was helpful\n\nA: What worked for me:\nIf you have Siri (like I do on my iPad) I told Siri to send a simple \"hi\" message to one of my contacts and when they replied, I just opened iMessage and it worked fine. I just had to delete the conversation that gave me the crash with the LONG emoji message. Hope this helps!! (:\n\nA: Switch your iPad off,for 10 seconds switch it back on go in to contacts click on any contact (that's not the one iMessage crashed whilst texting) and click send message and it will work and iMessage will work again.\nIt worked for me and I hope it works for you.\nAn alternate solution is to go into contacts, choose a random contact that's not the one that crashes, then it will take you into iMessage, then press messages in the top left corner, and then edit in the left corner, then select the message that is crashing, delete it, then re-add the contact.\n", "Q: How can I have Calendar use an audible alarm for alerts? Today I missed an event alert because I stepped away from my desk for a few minutes. What settings would affect whether Calendar Alerts have an audible alarm?  Is there a way to force an audible alarm sound for specific items?\n\nA: If you go to Settings -> Notifications, then under In Notification Center, select Calendar and scroll down to Calendar Alerts and choose it.\nThis will give you the screen to select an alert tone for your calendar alerts. You could select a ringtone for it even.

Every night before 1am, when my daughter has gone to bed but stayed logged in to our iMac (Lion 10.7.5), the parental controls dialog pops up.  Unfortunately it ALSO announces itself via text-to-speech at whatever volume the computer happens to be set.  And then proceeds to do a 10-9-8-... countdown at exactly 1am.  You can probably imagine how unwelcome this is.\nI can not find ANY setting that controls this.  VoiceOver is off.  Speech > \"Speakable items\" is off.  I've disabled every version of universal access or text-to-speech that I can find.  In fact I'm pretty sure the voice that speaks isn't even one of the default assistive voices (Bob, Alex, etc)\nAre there any easily overlooked options that I might have missed, or any methods to force ALL speech off, or any other ways I could get it to shut up - other than reminding my daughter to always remember to log out?

I have an early 2009 24\" iMac. Lately, when in sleep mode it will occasionally wake up for around ten seconds with the screen off, then go back to sleep. Wake on LAN is turned off so I can't figure out why this is happening!\n\nA: A common reason for random wake-ups is network accesses.\nIf you go to System Preferences>Energy Saver, there you will see an option saying \"Wake for network access\". If this option is enabled, then your sleeping Mac will be able to wake-up for network accesses. For example, when you initiate a screen sharing from another Mac on your local network.\nAnyway, this is all okay BUT when this option is enabled it's also documented on Apple's site that it will cause random wake-ups by just running the hard-drives but not starting up the screen; and it will go immediately back to sleep.\nAlso @macaco have putten it beautifully that you'll probably get a code for this reason.\n\nA: There are a number of possible reasons, and the system actually logs the cause of each 'wake from sleep'.\nOpen a terminal and enter: \nsyslog | grep -i \"wake reason\"\n(or, on Sierra or newer log show | grep -i \"wake reason\")\nThis may take some time to return a result, but when it does, you should get a series of lines that look something like the following:\n\nJan 24 08:52:19 hostname kernel[0] : Wake reason: OHC1\n\nHere are the possible 'Wake Reason' codes (lifted from OSXDaily)\n\n\n*\n\n*OHC: stands for Open Host Controller, is usually USB or Firewire. If you see OHC1 or OHC2 it is almost certainly an external USB keyboard or mouse that has woken up the machine.\n\n*EHC: standing for Enhanced Host Controller, is another USB interface, but can also be wireless devices and bluetooth since they are also on the USB bus of a Mac.\n\n*USB: a USB device woke the machine up\n\n*LID0: this is literally the lid of your MacBook or MacBook Pro, when you open the lid the machine wakes up from sleep.\n\n*PWRB: PWRB stands for Power Button, which is the physical power button on your Mac\n\n*RTC: Real Time Clock Alarm, is generally from wake-on-demand services like when you schedule sleep and wake on a Mac via the Energy Saver control panel. It can also be from launchd setting, user applications, backups, and other scheduled events.\n\n\nHappy hunting!\n", "Q: How to restore a missing Recovery HD partition I bought a second hand Macbook Pro which came with OSX Lion installed, when I wanted to clean it I found out that it had no Recovery HD partition. I confirmed this through the Disk Utility (enabled debug menu, showing every partition).\nI am able to boot using Apple's Internet Recovery feature, but since Lion wasn't bought on my Apple ID, its only giving me the option to buy OSX Mountain Lion. Can I use that to completely reinstall my Macbook and create a proper Recovery HD partition, and then can I simply use Timemachine afterwards to recover my data?\nAny hints or tips for this process would be highly appreciated.\n\nA: Yes, you can. Be sure to have a full Time Machine archive on an external device before you begin, and check your MBP meets the minimum system requirements before you buy.  The Mountain Lion installer will create Recovery HD, if it doesn't already exist.\nIn case you choose to do a clean install, which is quicker, import your account afterwards from the Time Machine archive using Migration Assistant: you can pick and choose exactly what you want to import from the archive, and the Apple utility will sanitise imported user preferences so they are Mountain Lion compatible.\nAlternatively, if you are comfortable using Terminal,  Lloeki's answer to How can I create or recreate a Lion recovery partition has much to recommend it.\n\nA: SuperDuper's developer recommends reinstalling OS X from the App Store:\n\nActually, you can easily recreate the recover partition by simply reinstalling Lion from the App Store. (This has the additional benefit of updating the recover partition with the most recent data, too.)\n\nSee http://www.shirt-pocket.com/forums/showthread.php?t=6647.\nReinstalling OS X over the current installation is like upgrading OS X. It keeps user files and settings in place, but it replaces some system files with the versions included with the installer. It shouldn't cause you any extra work, apart from things like having to reinstall Java or restore the contents of /etc/apache2/.\nAlternatively, if you are running an old major version of OS X like the OP, you can just upgrade OS X from the App Store.\n\nA: I had a whole set of articles about it on my blog.\nhttp://www.dmitry-dulepov.com/2011/09/how-to-create-mac-os-x-lion-recovery.html\nhttp://www.dmitry-dulepov.com/2011/09/mac-recovery-partion-revisited.html\nhttp://www.dmitry-dulepov.com/2012/09/creating-os-x-recovery-partion-part-3.html\nFor now I would recommend the last article as a way to go. The first two will work but they require a lot of attention and doing math.\n\nA: You can use Carbon Copy Cloner to create the space for the Recovery Partition if you are booted from another hard drive.\nThe problem is that you will need a copy of to 10.7 Recovery Partition to copy into the space that Carbon Copy Cloner creates.\n\nA: I would recommend using a tool for this. The one I prefer is:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/MagerValp/Create-Recovery-Partition-Installer\nYou can look at the tools and it's been used by many Mac Admins so it gets updated when things break over time quite rapidly. Apple recommends reinstalling the OS, but that's an indirect way if you don't mind running a special tool for this limited task.\n", "Q: Stop Office for Mac from loading with earlier documents on top of the one I opened? Here's an irritation that annoys me almost every working day:\n\n\n*\n\n*I need to work from a Word or Excel (for Mac, Office 2011) document.\nSo, I find the document on the shared server, and open it.\n\n*The document and the application opens... so far, no problem...\n\n*...then, documents from my previous session open on top of the document I chose to open. The document I asked for is now buried somewhere under whatever I was working on when I last closed Word or Excel.\n\n\nThis always takes me by surprise because it's so different to usual application behaviour that I'm used to. \nBecause it's usually someone else's document I'm working from (and because it's usually first thing in the morning, and I'm really not a morning person...), I usually end up spending minutes in mild confusion looking for the content I need to work from in the wrong document, wondering why the document I just opened looks so different to how I was expecting it to look, before realising this isn't actually the document I just opened and/or remembering that Office for Mac does this.\nI've found this earlier question, with some suggestions for turning Resume Previous Windows off at the OS level, or with an app-specific Apple script. If possible, however, I'd prefer to keep Resume Previous Windows on, but make sure that once the MS Office application has opened, the document I actually opened is the one that has focus, not some random* document I had open yesterday.\nIs this possible? Is it possible to force MS Word 2011 and/or Excel 2011 (or all Office apps) to keep focus on the opened document when booting up after a document has been opened, without disabling Resume Previous Windows completely?\nOperating system is Lion if that's relevant, and the documents are on a work MS Exchange Server the Mac is connected to.\nEDIT: judging by comments, it sounds like this is a Lion thing not an Office thing. So, is there any way to keep this feature on, but make sure than whenever I open a file with an application that isn't currently running, the file I opened is the one with focus when the application starts up?\n\n*I think it's the document that was opened first that gets focus when the app boots up. Not 100% sure though, all I know for sure is, it's usually the last document I expect.\n\nA: *\n\n*Quitting the app with Option + Command + Q will ensure all windows are closed, and on the next open, only the intended file will open.\n\n*Go over to ~/Library/Saved Application State/ and change the permissions of your intended folder (com.microsoft.Word.savedState) to read-only.\n\n\nThese are essentially hacks - both tested on OS X 10.10.3 (Yosemite) and works.\n\nA: Resume states for individual programs are found in /Users/username/Library/Saved Application State/\nSearch for com.microsoft in the list of saved states. Youll be able to see word excel powerpoint ETC.\nGet the application state to how you want it and quit the program. Then, do a get info(Command + i) on the folder containing the program you want to lock and under the \"general\" drop down menu in the info window, click \"locked\". This will save the \"template\" of the app.\nMy source: if you need further instruction.\n\nA: What you want can be accomplished with Automator which comes with OS X.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator from the Applications folder\n\n*Choose New from the File menu or type ⌘-N and choose 'Application'\n\n*Search Actions for Launch and drag Launch Application to the workflow on the right\n\n*set the app to Word or whatever else you're having the problem with\n\n*search Actions for 'Pause' and drag pause to the workflow, set it to however long it takes word to open for you (e.g. 5 seconds)\n\n*search Actions for Open Finder Items and add that to the workflow.\n\n*Save it as an Application, drag it to your dock and drag docs on to the icon for it when you want them to open on top of the previous Word docs. \nN.B. you can also set all documents to open using your freshly created app, so you can just open them as usual, but then a delay will permanently be added to their opening.\n\nA: I had the same problem and here is how you fix it. This has nothing to do with any of the Mac OS.\nOpen word document and go to Word -> Preferences -> General and from the list uncheck the below and save the file.\nUncheck: track recently opened documents\nDisplay: keep this as blank and press ok and you are done.\n\nA: simply go to System Preferences -> General and untick \"Restore windows when quitting and reopening apps\"\n\nA: Before closing Word or Excel (Cmd+Q), close all windows with Cmd+W - press it repeatedly - it will close all opened windows and thus documents.\nWhen reopened, no old documents will be opened and you will see and empty document or spreadsheet.\nThis is easy because you don't have to pay attention on what is being closed.

Even if I stop it, it starts again within seconds.\n\nA: In Preferences, within Mail, in the Accounts tab, for each of your accounts there is an Advanced tab.  There is an option called Keep copies for offline viewing which is a drop-down box. By Choosing All messages, but omit attachments, you can set it to never cache the attachments.\n", "Q: Why is application switching slow on Late 2013 Mac Mini compared to early 2008 Macbook Pro? I recently purchased a Late 2013 Mac Mini Quad Core i7 2.6Ghz with 4gb DDR3 ram, 1TB 5400 rpm drive model APPLE HDD HTS541010A9E662 running OSX 10.8.2\nI used Migration Assistant to migrate apps and files from Macbook Pro to Mac mini over gigabit Ethernet.\nThe Macbook Pro is an early 2008 model equipped with a Core 2 Duo processor at 2.4Ghz with 4GB DDR2 Memory and an (upgraded) 750GB 7200 RPM hard drive model ST750LX003-1AC154 running OSX 10.7.5  Link to model: http://www.seagate.com/internal-hard-drives/laptop-hard-drives/momentus-xt-hybrid/\nWhy does my 2008 Macbook Pro completely outperform my Late 2012 Mac Mini when switching applications? (CMD+TAB).  The Mac Mini outperforms the Macbook on all other fronts.\nI normally run Adobe Lightroom, Photoshop CS5, Adobe Bridge CS5, OpenOffice, and FireFox and I regularily switch between them all. Changing from Lightroom back to Firefox will bring up the beach ball for 15-30 seconds, and beachball again if I wish to open a new firefox tab.\nThis doesn't happen on the Macbook. \nIt is purely the hard drive RPM difference?\n\nA: 4GB of RAM isn't much to be running all of those heavyweight apps at the same time. My guess would be that it's doing a lot of paging to disk. Check the size of the swap files on both machines.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Finder's \"Go\" menu and select \"Go to Folder…\".\n\n*Enter /private/var/vm/ into the box and press the \"OK\" button.\n\n*Add up the sizes of the swap files. \n\n\nIf it's more than 1GB I usually reboot. That will clear out these files. I've seen these files up to 4GB on a machine with 8GB of RAM.\nSince running out of RAM can cause writes to disk, the difference in disk speed may be what's causing the delay.\n\nA: Either Finder or System UI server handles the application switching and I agree with you that this shouldn't be something the system needs to go to disk to generate.\nLet's break down the performance on each machine to be sure some other process isn't hung and if it's really IO or CPU or memory thrashing.\nOpen two terminal windows on the old Mac. You'll need to know a little about typing - and that these commands don't quit, so you click your mouse on a window and then press Control-C to quit these. Also, there will be a lot of data you don't need from these tools - so look at patterns and what changes rather than focusing on the absolute numbers:\n\n\n*\n\n*iostat 1\n\n*vm_stat 1\nAfter about 20 seconds of both tools running, fire them up on the second Mac and adjust the windows so you can see all 4. When the Mac is just sitting there, you should have no disk writing, the CPU should be 90% idle or more and most \"page in\" should be 0 with a few less than 5.\nAt this point you can poke the keyboard to pull up the app switcher. Watch for page in under vm_stat and also keep track of how many apps are open. The most likely cause is the slow Mac has little Inactive RAM as well as a tiny slice of Free RAM. The tiny slice of Free RAM is by design - but you want your Wired plus Active RAM to be between 50% and 66% of total RAM to avoid delays.\nLet's stop there and see what your measurements show. There are many questions here on what free, inactive and other types of RAM are. My hunch is the slow Mac is paging and has too many Apps open for the RAM equipped.\nIf you open Activity Monitor, you might see something like this under System Memory\n\nIf you see that, quit a few apps until your RAM looks like this and repeat the timing of the app switcher test.\n\n\nA: RAM\nMountain Lion is a resource hog compared to Snow Leopard\n\nA: The Problem is RAM. 4 GB is not enough for a Mac Mini to run Mountain Lion and your Adobe Applications. There are two ways to fix this issue.\n\n\n*\n\n*Buy more RAM (at least 8Gb). I have 12Gb in my Mac Mini, and it works phenomenally!.\n\n*Buy a Free Memory App to release RAM every time you need it when running your Adobe applications.\n\nA: RAM issue.  Free memory with just one click, this is an example how Freememory.App it works, download from App Store.\n\n", "Q: How can I tell if a given *.ipa will run on an iPad or iPhone? I backed up my laptop's ITunes folder by copying out all the *.ipa apps I had installed.  Some of these IPAs are no longer available on the app store, or require newer hardware than I own.\nHow can I tell if a given *.ipa is intended for an iPad or iPhone by looking at (or using tooling to probe) the file?\n\nA: Every app has a info.plist file with some configurations for the app. Using this file, you could see if the app has been build for iPhone and iPod, or iPad. To view this file, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup of the .ipa file\n\n*Rename filename.ipa to filename.zip\n\n*Open the .zip file\n\n\nIn the zip file you just opened (or extracted), you have another app. With a right mouse click, you can show the package contents of that file.\nWhen viewing the package content, there is an info.plist file. I prefer Xcode to view the data within the plist file, but on the App Store there're various other apps that your could download do view the contents of the plist file.\nThe info.plist file has a \"UIDeviceFamily\" key that should contain an array. The value of this array could be a 1 or 2 or both. Please refer to the image below to find out what the number means.\n\n\nA: I hope you don't mind getting a bit geeky.\n*.ipa files are just zip files. To look inside you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can copy the files to a new location.\n\n*Rename the copies to *.zip.\n\n*Unzip the files.\n\n*Use the finder to look through the unzipped folders.\n\n\nI believe that Apple requires correct icons for each device so you should be able to tell by looking for the icon files in the package. \nI used Temple Run 2 for this example. After expanding the zip archive I had a folder named Temple Run 2 1.0 copy.zip Folder in my safe location. The icon files are located in Temple Run 2 1.0 copy.zip Folder/Payload/templerun2.app/Icon.png\nYou can tell if it is universal by looking for the \"Icon*.png\" files. \nIcon.png - iPhone\nIcon@2x.png - iPhone Retina\nIcon-72.png - iPad\nIcon-144.png - iPad Retina\n\n\nA: View in iTunes, the menu bar at the top of the page allows you to see which is iPad, which is iPhone etc.\nAlso view in List mode, you can highlight and transfer in bulk\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to move Window to next Desktop?

I have a True Type font installed on my Mac that I have added to an X-Code development project. For the life of me, I cannot get it to work with my application, but I think it's because I'm using the wrong font name.\nUsing Font Book, or any other tool, how can I get the Postscript font name from the font metadata?\nI have a hunch that the Postscript name might be different from the Font name, but I need to verify.\n\nA: Open the Font Book application. (It should be in your Applications folder.)\nSelect the font you need the Postscript Name for.\nSelect Show Font Info from the Preview Menu. ( Or use ⌘+i).\n\nIf you are seeing only a preview ensure you click on the i\n\n\nA: Came across a slightly different use case that I thought I should share for others:\nA font file that I bought and downloaded is restricted to app use only. I usually use FontBook, like the accepted answer, to grab the PostScript name. However, because of the app use restriction I was unable to import the font into FontBook.\nWhat worked for me was to right click the font file and select \"Get Info\". The value in the \"Full name\" field under the General tab is what worked for me and appears to be the PostScript name. Verified this with a few other font files I knew for sure the PostScript name of.\nEasy and doesn't involve opening another app.\n\nA: Your assumption is correct. iOS requires that you identify a font based on its Postscript name (or Fullname), which is not always the same as the font's actual Filename.\nYou can get the PostScript name using FontBook (as shown on the accepted answer here), but there are other ways. \nFrom directly inside XCode, you can extract the PostScript Name from the project's installed fonts via UIFont. Simply run this to print the PostScript names of your installed project fonts :\nIn Objective-C (source):\nfor (NSString *fontFamilyName in [UIFont familyNames]) {\n    for (NSString *fontName in [UIFont fontNamesForFamilyName:fontFamilyName]) {\n        NSLog(@\"Family: %@ Font: %@\", fontFamilyName, fontName);\n    }\n}\n\nOr Swift 3.0 (source)\nfor familyName in UIFont.familyNames {\n    for fontName in UIFont.fontNames(forFamilyName: familyName ) {\n        print(\"\\(familyName) : \\(fontName)\")\n    }\n}\n\nOr from the terminal, from inside the directory where you have your font files, you can run this script to print all the PostScript names of the fonts inside the current directory (uses the fc-scan utility from fontconfig which is probaly already installed) (source):\nfor file in \"$arg\"*.{ttf,otf}; do fc-scan --format \"%{postscriptname}\\n\" $file; done\n\nHere is a screenshot of the above command running on my ~/Library/Fonts directory:\n\nThe script above will run through all the .ttf and .otf files in the current directory, then print out the PostScript Name for each font which you can use to reference the font file in XCode or elsewhere.\nIf you want to get fancy with some additional information (PostScriptName, Filename) and some color coding, you can run this alternative script:\nfor file in \"$arg\"*.{ttf,otf}; do \n    postscriptname=$(fc-scan --format \"%{postscriptname}\\n\" $file);\n    printf \"\\033[36m PostScript Name:\\033[0m %s \\e[90m(%s)\\033[0m\\n\" \"$postscriptname\" \"$file\";\ndone\n\n\nThis is a bit faster than copy-pasting code inside of your AppDelegate.m file to print out the names every time you want to add a new font file, which is the popular method, and it's also faster than opening the Font in FontBook to inspect the PostScript Name.\nUSEFUL TIP: If you alias the above script in your terminal so that all you need to do is type a single command to get all the PostScript font names for all the files in the current directory, then you will save time in your development workflow and have this handy script ready to use when you need it.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: You can use FontDrop\nA wonderful online tool that lets you extract informations from your fonts files \nDrop your font file on the droppable area :\n \nScroll a little bit then select the \"Data\" tab: \n\nYou will find the postscript name of your font under the property name \"postScriptName\"\n", "Q: OSX Mountain Lion - Login hangs after restart Mac Book Pro purchased in November, 2012, running OSX 10.8.current (Mountain Lion).\nI shut down all apps, and restarted the laptop.\nAfter the reboot, I selected my account and provided my password.

Does anyone have any hints on what to look at to see what might not be starting properly?\nThanks!\nUPDATE 1\nI couldn't manage to restart in Safe Mode (shift key). I did restart into Restore mode (Cmd-R) and was able to run Disk Utility. The disk itself passed all verify tests, the Encrypted LVM was inaccessible.\nWhile in Restore mode, I picked Start-up Disk... from the Apple menu and provided the password for the encrypted LVM. That was accepted and the partition appeared.\nAfter restarting, a test login is again hanging...\n\nA: Whatever is was, CMD-R on restart and reinstalling the OS fixed it. :-/\n", "Q: How can I sync PDF files (and more) with my Mac and iPad? I know the iPad has the Book Shelf thing:\n\nI know I can add PDF files to it - but:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to sync that with my Mac so I can also read them on the Mac?\n\n*Is it possible to have them keep the same place (page / bookmark) synced?\n\n*Would I / can I use iTunes on the mac to pick up reading where I left off on the iPad?\n\n\nIf it isn't possible with the the native software, are there any apps that do this?\n\n\n*\n\n*Also, is it somehow possible to add other reading materials (like webpages) to the bookshelf for reading later? I know that you could do something similar with Evernote but it seems odd to dump your PDF files in evernote as attachments to notes rather than having them as part of a library of some sort. Also not sure that Evernote can remember / sync your place in attached PDF files.\n\n\nA: The PDF files you add to the bookshelf are copied back to iTunes on your Mac and the can be accessed there and opened in Preview. Unfortunately, I don't believe your location data is synchronized. \nArchiving of web pages can be done using the Reading List function in Safari or using a service like Instapaper. \n", "Q: Making and applying a custom design to a chart in Numbers I'm making a column chart about certain dice rolls in the game Descent: Second Edition, and the problem I'm having is that there are multiple dice of the same color in the standard rolls. For example, you could roll a red die, or two red die. I would like to be able to color code the dice rolls, but with the fact that this can cause ambiguity, I would like to be abler to make  checkered pattern, with line borders, so one can see if I'm talking about \"red-red\", \"red\", or \"red-blue-yellow.\"\nI would also like to be sure that when I apply this pattern that it repeats, so it doesn't end up stretched or squashed depending on the columns height. If it came down to it, I could devise a \"pin stripe\" design to make that moot, but, that's the thing, I don't know my options.\nHere's what I have now. Notice the ambiguity and confusion in the colors.\n\nHere's what I would like to be able to do. Just by looking at it, you can tell what's being referred to.\n\n\nA: You can use the Graphic Inspector to set a gradient fill for any object, including a cell, in Numbers. This might work for the two-color combinations.\nHowever, the best way to accomplish this would be to create an image file for each of the combinations and use the necessary file to fill the cell. The image can be scaled to fit within a single cell.\n\n\n\n", "Q: Mountain Lion - Are these different ways of encrypting a Time machine backup equivalent? I just setup two backup drives for time machine in two different ways:\n1) By clicking the \"encrypted\" checkbox in the time machine dialogue.\nAfter fininshing the backup, it spent a long time saying \"encrypting...\"\n2) By formatting the drive as HFS+,Journalled,Encrypted using Disk Utility,\nand then keeping the the encrypted checkbox on in Time Machine (see note a).\nThe results are strange.  The time machine preferences says that drive 2 is encrypted,\nhowever \n\ndiskutil cs list | egrep -i \"size|status\"\n\nreports \n\n       Size (Total):       1999702540288 B (2.0 TB)\n       Size (Converted):   -none-\n\n\nThe time machine preferences does not say that drive 1 is encrypted, though it too\nforever to do so.  Perhaps that's because it's not mounted now.\n(a) I also explored approach 2 while turning off the checkbox, thinking this\nwould cause the material to be encrypted twice.  However it said something\nindicating that it would decrypt the drive, so I stopped this.\n\nA: With option 1 you are encrypting the files, not the drive. Option 2 encrypts the whole drive.\n", "Q: Save and Load Workspaces Is there an app or setting that lets me save (persist) and load workspaces (or \"Spaces\") on my Mac?\ni.e. as a freelance software developer I want it to appear as if I have a completely fresh Mac dedicated to each of my clients' projects -- one Mac per project\nObviously the way to REALLY do this would be to have a whole virtual machine for each project, but that's definitely overkill.  A good compromise might be to make a User Account for each project, but still that is more trouble than it's worth.\nThe bottom line is that I want to keep everything I do in one project separate from everything I do in another project, but simply being able to Save and Load workspaces as has been common for years in the Unix world would be a 95% solution.\n\nA: In practice, having a user account for each client actually works very well. The keychain contains items just for that client and you aren't distracted by your work when you are working on client's items. It's all about everything you need for that client.\nBetween webmail and web project management - you might even be able to keep some critical items out of the user account and be able to access it from multiple places.\nI find that iOS is so good on managing the things I need, that I'm using \"my\" stuff on a computer so much less that one account per big project and a catch all consulting account to keep my personal account clear of work and be very nice for automated billing, crystal focus on the task at hand as well as clean separation of files and configurations where I can put things in a shared folder, but need to take a step rather than having everything all jumbled.\nFast User switching also helps to pop back to another account quickly when needed.\n\nA: I developed an Mac app that records a workspace. You can drag&drop, add or copy/paste everything on it (files, contacts, bookmark, email, …), called Objects. By default, an Object is a reference to the original information.\nMy app records each event (adding, removing, resizing, moving, linking, unlinking, …) made to Objects, it can unwind and wind up these events in time, like a video tape recorder. Everything is persistent.\nSo you can Clean your workspace, select a previous workspace, and Recall all Objects from previous to the actual workspace using the \"Clean & Recall\" single action.\nMaybe it's what you are looking for… My app is named hipSpace.\n", "Q: Versions.app: How to select Kaleidoscope.app as diff tool?

On a black iPhone 4, I open the Game Center application and it is stuck on \"loading\":\n\nFor a moment I assumed that it was a problem with Apple. Well, no, because turns out I have a white iPhone 4 where Game Center does work.\nI heard that if an iPhone is jailbroken, you can't use Game Center for developing applications on sandbox mode. However, it does work for normal games. Both of my devices are jailbroken.\nWhy might my black iPhone be stuck on \"loading\" within the Game Center application, while the other device works just fine with it?\nThere is a difference in iOS version though. The black iPhone, which is stuck on the loading screen, is 6.0.1, while the white one, which works, is 4.3.3.\nI already tried rebooting the black iPhone and killing the Game Center application.\n\nA: iPhone 4 GSM Black:\nI had the same issue when I updated to 6.1.2 from my previous version 5.1.1 when the evasi0n jailbreak came out. I solved the problem by restoring to the factory default. Then I went through the beginning steps of the iphone introduction, when i open and logged in to gamecenter everything came through pretty smooth... I jailbreaked it after I restored  and gamecenter still worked smoothly. Then I restored to my last back-up and opened gamecenter after it all loaded up and everything is still working fine.\nHopefully this simple troubleshooting helped out. It did for me.\n\nA: happened to me after a normal boot (i have semi-untethered 6.1.3) i just boot tethered and problem solved, game center logged in automatically, without giving my apple id.\n\nA: I had that just now.

But doing this, I am scared the 2nd computer will also be able to purchase  with my iTunes account, which I obviously don't want!\nDoes anyone know how to control this?\n\nA: You can authorise a computer to play/access iTunes-purchased content without logging in to the store.\nIn the iTunes menubar: Store > Authorize This Computer… \nYou will be asked to enter your Apple ID and password. These are the same credentials you use for the iTunes Store.

(ICMP, DNS work fine) I have two Macs behind a cable modem/WAP. One works fine. The other is able to ping servers but is unable to telnet to them. For instance pinging what.org works fine but I get operation timed out errors when I wget what.org or telnet what.org 80. And nmap what.org -Pn says host is up but all ports are filtered. I'm pretty sure this is a problem with the computer, not with the modem/router. Also, strangely some of my Chrome tabs can still reload, duplicate, and function, like google, Gcal and Gmail, but other's can't, and all new domains fail with Error 118 (net::ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT): The operation times out.. Skype chat and dropbox work. How can I further diagnose this problem?\n\nA: First step: check that Mac n°2 is connected with the network interface you think it should (i.e. Ethernet and not AirPort or anything else).\nIf you are using the famous Automatic network configuration you are never sure on which interface your computer is talking or replying.\nFor example, your Mac n°2 might well be plugged toward the Internet through your neighbour Wi-Fi connection.\n", "Q: iPhone 5 not charging via USB from PC I charge my phone using my PC all the time, and it's been only a week that since I bought my iPhone 5. Now I can't charge my phone with my PC.\nWhat could be the problem thats causing my phone to not charge while connected to my PC?\nThe USB charger is new.\n\nA: Check the inside of the phone's charger port with a flashlight. Lint can block all the pins from making a connection which will cause the phone not to charge. Same goes for any open connections like the DC \"cigarette lighter\" port. Try cleaning the hole(s) out I guess is what I'm saying\n\nA: Assuming you mean usb charging cable. there could be a couple of things. \n\n\n*\n\n*The new cable you got is not supported by apple. The lightning chargers contain a specialized chip, if the vendor is not apple authorized, it probably wont let it charge.\n\n*The new cable , doesn't provide proper charge. It may be faulty/provide lesser power than required to charge the phone. \nIf you can return it, do that.

Then add root, localadmin and each network user to the brewers group. Would each network user now be able to brew? \nI have read that I might need to change the umask for each network user to 0002?\n\nA: This can work if you also then make /usr/local/ and everything under it group-writable with chmod. The current permissions have them writable only by localadmin.\nYes, you will need to do something about the umask for users running brew. Otherwise users won't be able to modify stuff brewed by other users, even if they're both in the brewers group. You probably don't want to change their default umask, because then all the files they create would be group-writable, which is probably not what you want. You might use a custom wrapper script around the brew command which sets the umask to 002 for just the duration of that command, e.g. by doing the umask and brew calls in a subshell.\n", "Q: Builtin VNC stops working after waking headless Mac mini from sleep (black screen) I'm running a Mac mini (late 2012) with OS X 10.8.2 as a media center PC and streaming server. It's not running 24/7 - instead I'm using a schedule to wake it up in the evening and putting it back to sleep at midnight. So far, so good.\nFor some reason the built-in VNC server stops working when the Mac wakes up while the attached screen is turned off. I can login and can also move the cursor but the screen remains black.\nA workaround is to use RealVNC but I prefer to use the built-in VNC service since it doesn't cost extra money and has better multi-user support.\n\nA: This was eligible for me: edit /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist like this:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Kernel Flags</key>\n    <string>darkwake=0</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nand restart your mac.

Long story short; I was updating a couple of iPad apps via iTunes last night, but had to shut down. Now they're all listed as \"installing...\" on my iPad but they're neither being downloaded nor installed, and I can't access them until they're finished (but they're not progressing, so they won't finish). \nIs there any way to abort an in-progress update so I can at least use the apps I've currently got?\n\nA: This is addressed several times on the Apple Forums.  It is a common problem.  I will list a few of the answers that have worked for others. Before starting, do the obligatory iPad reboot.\n1) From the iPad desktop click the stalled app. It will either restart the update process or report the \"update failed\". If it fails you will then be able to restart the update from within iPads App updater.\n2) If you have a desktop Mac, from iTunes go to menu Store > Check for Available Downloads. This should download the updated App to your iTunes. Then re-sync with your iPad.\n3) Delete the app from your iPad then reinstall.\nI found that option 1 worked flawlessly for me.\n", "Q: How to get gmail contacts on my iphone?

It works very well for me.\n\nA: If You are using Mac OS X, you can synchronize you Contacts on Mac with google (set it i Contacts settings). Then just synchronize with your iPhone via iTunes.\n", "Q: When will I use the FileVault 2 recovery key? I enabled FileVault 2 on my Mac, and I remember that it gave me a recovery key. When will I use this recovery key?\n\nA: You will need the recovery key to decrypt the volume if you lose your password or, in the unlikely event that the encryption key associated with the password becomes corrupt. If you elected not to allow Apple to store the recovery key, keep a copy (or several) in a safe place other than your computer. \nRecovery Keys can also be used by System Administrators to mount volumes for maintenance or recovery. (The Admin doesn't need access to an account password).  It is possible to encrypt a FileVault volume using a master key.\nApple's Best Practices for Deploying FileVault 2 white paper provides more information about the inner-workings.\n", "Q: How can I sync notes in iPhone with macbook pro and vice versa by using either bluetooth or using USB cable?

Back then (and now still) I fear for the lifespan of SSDs, and hauling an iMac 27\" to the store is cumbersome, so it looked the right choice.\nBut now, I notice that the drive is the main bottleneck for pretty much anything I try to do, and I would love to benefit from the better performance of an SSD. (Though still not regretting my choice for HDD internal storage, mind.)\nWill installing OS X and my applications on an external SSD be faster than an internal HDD?\nIf I did my reading right, I really should be getting something with a Thunderbolt connection. But I wanted to check here to be sure, and wondered if OS X is at all bootable from a Thunderbolt drive?\n\nA: To answer your first question, Yes booting from an external SSD should be much faster than a stock HD.\nThunderbolt is definitely the fastest interface around so that shouldn't be the bottle neck.\nYes, from a brief Google search it looks like people are booting from  Thunderbolt drives without a problem.\n\nA: I own a Lacie Rugged SSD USB3/Thunderbolt 128 GB drive.\nI am using it as a boot drive for my 2011 iMac over Thunderbolt.\nI had no issues with it, I put the iMac into sleep over night. The drive never disconnected when a I woke up the machine from sleep. Although the drive is not as fast as an internal drive but it is a good option for an iMac if you do not want to install an internal SSD into an iMac.\nThis option is a lot faster than the internal 7200 rpm HDD. The apps load very fast. Before that I had a lot of problems with a lot of apps opened especially when I ran out of RAM. But I have no problems now using the SSD.\nSome reported that you can not enable TRIM on an external SSD. I enabled TRIM with TRIM Enabler.\n", "Q: Why can't I paste into the password dialog when mounting an encrypted disk image? I've got an encrypted sparse bundle disk image and I've used fstab with the right UUID to mount it someplace other than /Volumes. What I would like is to just dbl-click on it, enter the password and have it show up where I want it. I use a password manager and I have intentionally chosen a long random gibberish password for the disk image. It seems that I am not allowed to paste my password into the dialog that asks for a password when mounting an encrypted disk image. \nAm I doing something wrong?\n\nA: No, you aren't doing anything wrong. Apple doesn't allow you to paste into certain secure dialog boxes. It's a feature, not a bug. (It makes a brute force hack of the dialog box more difficult.)\nYou can paste the password into the command line if you mount the secure image using hdiutil.\nOpen Terminal and type:\n hdiutil attach /path/to/imagefile -stdinpass\n\nWhen prompted for the password, copy it from a text file or (preferably) a password vault and paste it into terminal.\nIf the path/to/imagefile is complex, you can type the command, a space, then drag the imagefile icon from the finder into the terminal window to automatically enter the path/filname.\n\nA: I wrote a very tiny AppleScript application which allows you to paste passwords even where its not allowed by tricking the system into thinking that you're typing on your keyboard. The downside: it takes space in your Dock.\n\nA: You could also run a script like this in AppleScript Editor:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"SecurityAgent\"\n    set value of text field 1 of window 1 to (the clipboard)\n    click button 1 of group 1 of window 1\nend tell\n\nIt requires access for assistive devices to be enabled from System Preferences.\n\nA: Apple's security prevents this as answered separately by jaberg.  But are you not prompted to store the password in your keychain?  I've only used encrypted physical volumes and not disk images, but I'm always prompted to store the password to my keychain.\n", "Q: How do I change the root password? Everybody seemed very confused by the story and extra information I gave so I will simply ask a very straightforward question.  Irrespective of your personal opinion on the utility of doing so; how does a person change the root password?\nAlso, the apple help page that I linked originally, and that some of you additionally linked to does not actually say how to change the root password, it only says that it can be done.\n\nA: If you don't have the password to the current admin account, there'll be no way to reset anything without a) calling your dad and asking for the old admin password, or b) restarting the computer in an alternate mode of some sort.\nHowever, to expand on what @patrix and @jaberg said, you should not reset (/set) the root password. Resetting the root password is both more difficult and less useful than resetting a regular admin account's password. On OS X, the root account is generally disabled for login because you do not need (or want) to log into it. If you need to do root-like things in the GUI, there may be a padlock to click on & then enter your admin name & password, or you may just be prompted directly. At the command line, you can run commands as root with sudo (note that it'll prompt for your admin password, not the root password).\nYou can either change the password to your dad's admin account (in System Preferences -> Users & Groups), or create a new clean admin account for yourself (also System Preferences -> Users & Groups, then click the padlock and authenticate with your dad's admin password, then click \"+\", choose \"Administrator\" from the New Account pop-up menu, enter the rest of the account info you want).\nYou may still run into other leftover password issues, like the Apple ID account & password that was used to buy apps from the App Store; this has nothing to do with local accounts on your computer, so the root/admin/etc passwords are irrelevant here.\n\nA: If you have Admin on the box try this in a terminal window:\nAdminuser$ sudo passwd root\nAdminuser$ Password (enter your Admin password)\nAdminuser$ Changing password for root.\nNew Password: *****\nRetype New Password: *****\n\nA: Root is deactivated by default, so no need to activate it or change the password. If you run Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10.8) (you don't mention that - or I overlooked it) restart the Mac and boot using the recovery disc (hold down the option or alt key). There you can use the password utility to change the password of every account (including admins). This doesn't work if FileFault is on. But if you are lucky, then you can set a new password for the account of your father / brother.\n\nA: If you can already log in on an account with administrator privileges (normal OS X account) and know its login password, you can reset the passwords of other admin accounts in System Preferences > Accounts. If you can't, you can reset the passwords of admin accounts in single user mode. See this question.\nIf you actually mean the password of the root user, it can be changed from /System/Library/CoreServices/Directory Utility.app/, but you have to be logged in on an admin account and know its login password.\n\n\nA: Have you tried to eg. Google with the words \"os x enable root\" ??\nIf you have, then you'll get a link to Apple's description - http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1528 - about enable/disable the root user - and you reset the password at the same place.\n\nA: Here you go. Note that the procedure is different depending on the OS you are running.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht1528\nThere are, or at least were, valid reasons for needing the root user enabled. I was writing kernel level USB drivers and this was needed for development. Since I stopped writing USB drivers I have not had a need for this.\nGood Luck.\n", "Q: Protect my files from local admins Is there any way for me to protect my home folder and keychain from other users with admin privileges on a single machine?\nEDIT: Here's some background on the situation. In my office, we have several shared workstations. Everyone on the development floor has access to a general admin account that we use to maintain the software on the machines. I'd like to be able to personalize an account on the machine, but I worried about leaving myself open to the possibility of the other \"admins\" accessing my files. (I'm not keeping anything particularly sensitive; just my ssh keys for GitHub, my work Dropbox folder, leaving gmail logged in, etc.)\n\nA: Nobody can get into your keychain without the password.\nYou may be able to protect your home folder if you are running a version of OS X with the original Filevault, which was introduced in OS X Panther (10.3) and replaced by Filevault2 in Mac OS X Lion (10.7). So if you are running 10.3 through 10.6 then all you have to do is enable Filevault protection. The old version encrypts a user's home folder.\n\nA: You can store info in the key chain.\nYou can use disk utility to create a disk image with a password .  Disk images work like fiash drives.  ( any other disk partition. )\n [ don't know the effect of the master password ]\nThere are other encryption programs around for files.\n\nthe administrator would have to use the sudo command or enable root\nMacintosh-HD -> Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal\nsudo ls -la /Users/your short name\nsudo cat /Users/your short name/your file name\n\nA: It depends on the knownledge of the admin. It is possible to use your files and also the keychain (loged in for example with http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/09/mac-os-x-keychain-pillaging-app/) loged out with your password (it is not really difficult to get it or to set a new one). FileFault 1 and 2 is good but it was hacked and depends who has the master password for it. Also don't forget that their could be a backup before you encrypt it.\n", "Q: What does the arrow with 2 lines through it mean? In Xcode, a lot of the shortcuts use an arrow with 2 lines though it:\n\nWhat is the keystroke corresponding to this?\n\nA: That is the page or scroll up key. On a MacBook the keystroke is Fn-Up Arrow.\n“What Do the ⌘, ⇧, ⌥, ⌃, ⎋, ↩, ⇥, ↖ and ↘ Menu Symbols Mean?”\nEach symbol corresponds to a key on your keyboard:\n⌘ — Command/Apple key\n⇧ — Shift key\n⌥ — Option/Alt key\n⌃ — Control key\n↩ — Return key\n⇥ — Tab key\n⎋ — Escape key\n↖ — Home key (Function-Left Arrow on laptops)\n↘ — End key (Function-Right Arrow on laptops)\nThere is a very handy reference at harvard.edu.\n", "Q: Understanding kernel panic error log My MacBook Pro worked all normal when all of a sudden it went black. It tried to reboot itself but immediately produced a kernel panic.\nFrom then on I was never able to boot again. I could only enter my password (not for logging in to Mac OS, but for booting) and then the kernel panic would happen each time. \nThe error log was only visible for a few seconds and then it rebooted itself again. I was able to take a photograph of the kernel error. I have no idea what actually happened, so I wonder if anyone of you can make sense of the error message or identify the reason why the system failed?\n\nThe only thing that gives me a hint is the line about Core Storage Driver. In fact, I set up a HDD and SSD as a FusionDrive as explained in this article. I did this in november and used the MacBook every day since. Never had a problem until yesterday.\nLuckily, I had a fresh backup and have been able to restore everything in the meantime. I checked both the SSD and HDD drive with disk utility for errors but everything seems fine. \nAny idea what actually caused the error?\n\nA: Understanding a panic is quite easy: The core scheduler for the OS got lost in the weeds. This is a fail-safe in that the computer decides to stop running itself.\n\nThe inner most portion of the OS's control logic got derailed and the system was designed to drop all processing and leave a log file for engineering to troubleshoot further.\n\nYou can see these files after a restart by looking in /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports and especially if you have several that recur (in the same day or hour) it is sometimes useful to compare the reasons and patterns in the file.\nBack to the high level - how to understand this design is that some fundamental things went so wrong in the core of the operating system, the designers have all concluded that it's almost certainly worse to keep running with this error than to halt the computer immediately.\nThink of this as a fail-safe at the level where the computer decides what program or instruction gets to run next. The computer is literally out of ideas how to continue, so it dumps what it was working on (as best as it can recollect now that things are off the rails) and stops immediately.\n\nKernel Panics are some of the hardest to debug unless you have one that you know exactly how to trigger it. In that case, it's pretty easy to keep eliminating possibilities until the source is obvious. Here is the best writeup of Mac specific information on Understanding and Debugging Kernel Panics. It is very technical, so take what you wish and move on to the steps below.\nLike anything, it's best to isolate the problem to avoid chasing down thousands of potential causes. If you want to be systematic about how you isolate the cause (or worse causes) of a panic, here are the two articles with general steps for isolating software causes before investigating hardware.\n\n*\n\n*Isolating issues in Mac OS X - great general reference, links to specific sub articles\n\n*Mac OS X: How to troubleshoot a software issue\nIn your specific case - Core Storage is either the root cause or just an innocent next bystander that \"falls into the hole\" that another process left behind. Good Luck if you decide to isolate this, hopefully it was a one-off error and you can just use your Mac in peace.\n\nA: I'm going to answer your question (in the comments)\n\nwhat caused the problem in the first place\n\nThere can be many reasons why your Mac might have had a kernel panic. Most of them are temporary and you probably won't see them agan. The reasons usually include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Poorly Written Applications,\n\n*Plugins\n\n*Add-ons\n\n*Drivers\n\n\n.... \nUsually you only see a kernel panic when unusual conditions occure, these can include two (or more) specific apps running whilst our memory is still in use (the hex codes, were most likely memory locations).  \nReference / Further Description: http://macs.about.com/od/usingyourmac/qt/Troubleshooting-Os-X-Kernel-Panics.htm\nUPDATE:\nSpecific to your situation Page faults are usually caused when trying to access memory that is invalid. I have also read that people experience such erros by using hardware that is only affects certain models (SSD's for example) so I am guessing this is the same issue with you, since it does mention it.

I want to use the CD-ripping utility abcde, which I've installed via Mac Ports. I've run afoul of a problem in abcde, which is described in their bug database. Someone made a patch file musicbrainz2.patch which I think will solve the problem nicely.\nMy obstacle is that this patch hasn't been incorporated into the version 2.4.2 of abcde which is distributed by Mac Ports. Thus I'd like to apply this patch manually. But I can't figure out how to apply the patch to abcde as installed on my system.\nThe Mac Ports Guide section 4.5. Patch Files seems to be talking about how to patch Mac Ports portfiles and other distribution logic. It doesn't seem to talk about how to patch delivered utilities as installed.\nThe patch file includes file name references like (abbreviated):\n--- debian/control  (revision 292)\n+++ debian/control  (working copy)\n@@ -12,7 +12,7 @@\n Architecture: all\n-Suggests: eject, distmp3, ..., mp3gain, python-musicbrainz\n+Suggests: eject, distmp3, ..., mp3gain, python-musicbrainz2\n\n(This is the full abcde issue 3 patch file musicbrainz2.patch, and I can add it to the question if there is interest.)\nI'm skeptical that I'll find path names with \"debian\" in them on my Mac OS X 10.5.8 installation.

But other file in the patch file do correspond to files in my installation of abcde.\nHow can I apply this patch to my copy of abcde as installed by MacPorts? Is there a technique which will work in general for this kind of patch file on installations from Mac Ports?\n\nA: That sort of patch file is what macports refers to, however each patch would need to be in a separate file.\nHowever this case is more complex as you need to patch two things as you have spotted.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make the program compile and run under OSX which the current macport will have done. In this case this will include fixing the paths with debian in.\n\n*Add the extra changes you have in the patch.\n\n\nAs a first start I would note that each macport has a maintainer who can be seen in the result of port info abcde and I would contact them with the issue.

If I were to upgrade to an iPhone 5, could I simply pop the SIM out of my iPhone 4 and continue using it on wifi only? \nWould I also need to get the SIM deactivated since an iPhone 5 would come with its own SIM?\n\nA: Here are the steps to use either an iPhone or an iPad without cellular activity.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings.\n\n*Turn Airplane Mode ON. This will also disable Wi-Fi but we will re-enable it in the following step.\n\n*Tap Wi-Fi and you will be directed to another screen.

Downloading to a file, sourcing the file and then removing the file does work. I'm curious as to why none of the one liners are working though.\n\nA: You are correct that your two first on-liners should be working according to bash process substitution semantics. In my testing (bash 3.2 on OS X 10.8.2), the second one does, while the first one does not. \nIn the case of your first one-liner, it looks like you may be running into one of the limitations of process substitution. Quoting the Wikipedia page on process substitution:\n\nProcess substitution has some limitations: the “files” created are not seekable, which means the process reading or writing to the file cannot perform random access; it must read or write once from start to finish. Programs that explicitly check the type of a file before opening it may refuse to work with process substitution, because the “file” resulting from process substitution is not a regular file.\n\n– if source is a command that has difficulties with this (at least in bash 3.2), that would explain its failure to work with process substitution.\nThe second one-liner possibly just looks like it fails because it executes the code in a subshell rather than sourcing it. If you are expecting it to set aliases and functions, this won’t work, as these do not carry over to the parent shell when defined in a subshell.\nThe third one-liner doesn’t work because source does not process stdin – only files (see bash man page).\n\nA: I don´t know what you like to do but if you like to download a script (or whatever) use.\ncurl -s -L https://example.com/script.sh -o script.sh\n\nfor more details see \nman curl \n\nin terminal.\n-s silent, \n-L location of target including redirect to a new target, \n-o output file, if you don´t use it then curl uses the filename on the target (-o is often very useful).\nTo run the script use\n./script.sh\n\n", "Q: How to fix OD diradmin account? I am unable to add new accounts nor delete existing accounts in Open Directory despite being authenticated as diradmin.  I can change existing user passwords though.  Tried rebooting, no change.  I was able to create and delete accounts earlier today.  The options to create/delete accounts are disabled in the OSX Server Mountain Lion GUI.\nSuggestions are appreciated.\n\nA: Hope this isn't too late, or that at least it is useful for others.\nI tried http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1194 several times to no avail. I was simply unable to authenticate with the diradmin account.\nAn Apple support person recommended:\n\n*\n\n*Archive the OD from the Server.app → OD panel → action menu → Archive Open Directory Master… \n\n*Select the server in the list and click on the minus button Once the OD has been destroyed, You will see the OD is now Off. \n\n*Create the OD by switching back to ON and create the OD again with the same information as before (including the DirAdmin) \n\n*Create a BackupDirAdmin account with WGM to have a backdoor, just in\ncase \n\n*In terminal restore the archive you saved in step 1 using \n\nsudo slapconfig -restoredb < archive-path > \n  \n*Retest the authentication after the directory has been restored.\n  \n  Try as I might I couldn't get this to work, and then I noticed that in Mountain Lion server the slapconfig command had lost the -merge option so restoring the database was dumping both the new DirAdmin and backdoor account....\n\nBizarrely, after a lot of digging around I saw that mkpassdb has a -setadmin flag, so I tried to use this to elevate another slotId to admin rights. This worked, and then I was able to reset the password for the DirAdmin account.\n\nA: This worked for me at 10.10 Yosemite:\nsudo ldapsearch -LLL -x -H ldap://127.0.0.1 -s base namingContexts\n\ndn: namingContexts: dc=XXX-Produktion,dc=local\nPut your dc= ,dc=  into this:\nsudo ldappasswd -x -H ldapi://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fldapi -S uid=diradmin,cn=users,dc=XXX-Produktion,dc=local\n\n\nA: Keep in mind that if you have enabled password policy, it applies when resetting the password, you can't re use the previous password and the change will fail.\n\nA: When Apple's ldappasswd approach did not work, I used:\nsudo mkpassdb -dump\nWhich shows a number of lines but note the one with diradmin:\nslot 0002: 0xe45670000668ce60000000b8b00025f2        diradmin   10/21/2020 05:34:35 PM\n\nThe slot ID is: 0xe45670000668ce60000000b8b00025f2 \nand then using the slot ID, I reset the password:\nmkpassdb -setpassword 0xe45670000668ce60000000b8b00025f2\n\nwithout the failure of:\nStrong(er) authentication required (8) I got from ldappasswd\n", "Q: Copy and paste from skype includes unwanted characters I tried to copy the following line from Skype:\nblah123\nI got an error when I tried to paste it into another app to use it. So I pasted that into a hex editor and it looked like this in the hex editor:\n¬†blah123\nI don't know if that was just a problem with copy from Skype or if it could happen in other applications. What I want to know is a way to copy and paste from applications on mac osx ignoring all these unwanted 'invisible' characters.\n\nA: As far as I know it is impossible avoid the copy of these weird characters.\nBut you can remove them using an editor like TextWrangler. TextWrangler has an useful menu option \"Text\" -> \"Zap gremlins\". \nThis options identify and replace:\n\n\n*\n\n*Non Ascii characters\n\n*Control characters\n\n*Null (Ascii 0) characters \n\n\nSo, when I cannot avoid to copy from Skype (I suggest to use emails for important text) and I would be sure to remove all weird characters, better paste/zap/copy all the text within TextWrangler.\n", "Q: Using gwhois on OSX How does one install gwhois on a Mac?

I just want to play them. \n\n\nA: Select your albums as usual.\nClear the Up Next queue (using button at top right of queue)\nRight-click on one of your selected albums, and choose 'Add to Up Next' from the popup Menu.\nThat'll add all the songs from all the albums you've selected.\nClick the play button.\nIf you check the up next queue, you see all the songs from all the albums you selected.\nSongs are grouped by albums though. I'm not seeing a way to get the songs in the queue shuffled\n\nA: I had this problem, and hated it. But there is an absurdly easy solution.\nAll that Up Next stuff is rubbish. If you select the Songs view, as opposed to the Artist or Album view, you will get a screen that is pretty much the same as the old iTunes, where you can select an artist and just pick one album from the list of their albums and play it. (Make sure Column Browser - Cmd+B - is visible.)\nBy doing this you lose the nonsense of it finishing one album then going on to play whatever the next album is in your library.\nThe developers are stupid, but this solution works. You can get the artwork in this view if you go to view options (Cmd+j on mac) and click \"show artwork\".\n\nA: I've been having this problem too, so what I did was to create a 'Smart Playlist' and set its settings/rules to only play [albums] which contains [Album Name]. The playlist then gets populated with the results from your settings. Then every time you want to play another set of albums, just edit the rules and the results will get updated. I thought this was better than making a new playlist every now and then.\nApart from smart playlist though, I still haven't found any other way to play several selected albums.\nHope that helped.\n", "Q: Is it possible to put Mountain Lion's install on an HDD partition? I'm trying to do a clean install of Mountain Lion on my laptop..\nThere are plenty of of tutorials online explaining how to burn the Mountain Lion install (InstallESD) on a (dual layer!) dvd or on a usb drive. \nI have neither of those things handy right now. \nI do have plenty of spare HDD space though.\nIs it possible to create some sort of Install Partition on the hard drive than can be booted from (Option-boot) to do a fresh install?\nCan I create a partition a restore it from the InstallESD dmg? anyone knows if that works?\n\nA: Yes you can do it with an internal partition or in an external HDD, just one partition, USB, DVD, all is more or less the same, I have to say that this is one of the best things on the Mac, so easy to backup and restore systems.\nNOTICE: back up all your data, and make sure the partition that you are going to use is the correct one, this will destroy all information in that partition\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk utility, and click the desired partition on the left column.\n\n*Go to the \"restore\" tab\nAt the source, select the dmg file containing the installer (you may need to scan the image first, to do that go to the images menu item and select \"Scan image for restore\").\nAt the destination, drag the partition that you would like to use.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Restore (erase everything on, at least I prefer it that way).\nTHIS DESTROYS ALL INFO IN THAT PARTITION.\n\n*If all went well, it should copy all info into the partition\n\n*Go to system preferences and select startup disk, select the partition that you restored the installer into\n\n*Restart.\nIf all went well, you should be seeing the installer running from your partition, just select the destination for the new installation and all should be ok.\nIf for some reason the restore didn't work, you may need to mount the installer image and use that \"virtual\" disk as the source and not the actual image, I've had some trouble in the past and this sorted my problem.\n", "Q: Time Machine stopped backing up my iPhoto library a year ago, lost all photos I recently got my iMac's HDD replaced and when I restored my computer, every single Time Machine backup stretching back to last October contained the same size iPhoto library (+/- 100MB), which was current up to last February, even though the rest of my backups were intact.\nEven stranger, before I had the HDD replaced, I copied the Master's folder in iPhoto's Library package to an external drive, and it was also incomplete, and in exactly the same way.\nI managed to salvage some photos that were in Photostream by going into ~/Library/Application Support/iLifeAssetManagement/assets/sub in the Time Machine backup, but many are missing and all my videos are gone (because Photostream doesn't do videos.)\nIs there anywhere else my photos could be hiding (an import cache, iPhoto trash folder)? Is there anything at all I could do? How do I notify Apple about this issue?\n\nA: This sounds like somehow your iPhoto Library has moved. If you hold down ALT when you click to start iPhoto, the library management dialog comes up. This will tell you where iPhoto is currently located. If you somehow had access to your old HDD, you could see where this was located.\nObviously iPhoto doesn't work without a library, so the library has to be somewhere. I would certainly dig a little to see if you could find it. \n\n Unfortunately, I haven't worked with HDD recovery at all. I do know there are companies that do this. You could potentially send it it. I'll update or comment if I do find something.\n", "Q: If I share an account, can I change that so they don't see my data, but they would still pay? If I am under someone elses iTunes account because they pay, is there any way to make my own so they dont see everything on my iphone 4S\n\nA: You can use a different Apple ID for purchasing content and using Facetime, or Messages. You will need to set up your own Apple ID. This is possible without having a credit card. \nAfter this go to Settings > Facetime and sign out of the previous Apple ID, and sign into your new one. Do the same with iCloud - sign out with the previous Apple ID and sign into the new one. Now go to Messages > \"Send & Receive at:\" > Apple ID and do the same process. \nAfter those three are set to the new Apple ID, go to Settings.app > iTunes & App Stores, and make sure the Apple ID at the top of the screen still says the old Apple ID.\nKeep in mind that although this will keep your iCloud, Messages, Facetime, and such data separate, all receipts will go to the person who is paying for your purchases. They also can log in, at any time, and see what content you have purchased. The only way to avoid this would be for you to pay for your own purchases (you would need to change the \"iTunes & App Stores\" Apple ID).\n", "Q: Lock Screen Command One-Liner I'm trying to find out whether there is any kind of equivalent command line one-liner which replicates the exact identical functionality of the 'Lock Screen' menu option available via the Keychain app in OS X 10.6\nI'm aware of the all the 'usual' solutions (sleep/screensaver preferences to require a password on reactivation) but these are not suitable to me.\nI'm also aware of this option:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/user.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend\n\nwhich is also not suitable for me.\nThe perfect functionality is the 'Lock Screen' option however I have not yet found an elegant way to call it.\nAt the moment, I am calling via Automator, which isn't elegant!\nI have read much about this issue and my understanding is that no-one has yet found the 'holy grail' but I was wondering whether that might have changed.\n\nA: Set the preferences to lock the screen when the screen saver is active.\n\nThen you can use this terminal command to start the screen saver.\n/System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenSaverEngine\nAs far as I can tell this is exactly what the Keychain menu item does.\n\nA: In OS X 10.9 and later:\npmset displaysleepnow\n\nBy itself, this command only causes the display to sleep, resulting in a black screen. By configuring your computer to require a password immediately after sleep, this one-liner works as a \"lock computer\" command. The preference is available at System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General.\nSource: How to lock screen on MacBook Air?\n\nA: Note: This solution is unique in that it uses the Keychain Access menu bar status functionality, but it does not require you to enable the Show keychain status in menu bar option as the AppleScript methods do.\nI was also looking for a solution for this. Today I just had some time to play around and found a way to programmatically actually call the functionality from the keychain menu plugin. This solution works perfectly as long as Apple doesn't change the relevant parts in the keychain menu plugin. You can create a small binary for locking your screen by pasting this into your terminal...\n# Do our work in the temporary directory that gets cleaned on boot\ncd /tmp\n\n# Create the source file\ncat > main.m <<END_OF_FILE\n\n#import <objc/runtime.h>\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n\nint main () {\n    NSBundle *bundle = [NSBundle bundleWithPath:@\"/Applications/Utilities/Keychain Access.app/Contents/Resources/Keychain.menu\"];\n\n    Class principalClass = [bundle principalClass];\n\n    id instance = [[principalClass alloc] init];\n\n    [instance performSelector:@selector(_lockScreenMenuHit:) withObject:nil];\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nEND_OF_FILE\n\n# Compile the source file\nclang -framework Foundation main.m -o lockscreen\n\nExecute the program by typing:\n./lockscreen\n\n\nA: I think the answer to your question is \"No, there isn't a command line way to do this.\"\nBecause this is a menu bar item, it's not something that you can access easily using Keyboard Maestro or another similar tool.\nHowever, if you are not averse to a solution using a 3rd party app,\nQuickLock will let you do this.\nIt's a free (donations accepted) app which will let you assign a keyboard shortcut to lock the screen. There's also a menu bar item which you can click to lock the screen.\nThe app will let you set a password (separate from your account password).\nIt does not require the use of password with screensaver, it's all completely separate.\nYou can see a video of it in action at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBHwykPB19o\np.s. when the screen is locked, type your password to unlock it. I was confused because I expected to see a password field. There is none. You just type the password.\np.p.s. I've only used this for a few minutes, so there may be some other issues with it I'm not aware of, but it seems to fit the bill.\n\nA: The Mac is not designed to provide you with such an option. However, this article explains a workaround using QuickSilver. While I can't understand why you don't like the solution Apple provides natively, I do wish you luck on finding a solution.\n\nA: A quick way to sleep your machine via command line with the help of AppleScript is\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to sleep'\n\nThat doesn't lock your screen unless you have it set to require a password immediately which I don't like to do.  I'm just noting it for posterity.\n\nA: I used the code posted above by jnk. Then I used appify to turn it into an OS X app, mathiasbynens.be/notes/shell-script-mac-apps. Then I used Quicksilver to assign my own keyboard shortcut (I chose cmd+L). Terminal is not opening/staying open (as some were concerned) with how I have it set up because I am launching an OS X app instead.\n\n\n*\n\n*Follow the answer above by jnk, Lock Screen Command One-Liner\n\n*Use appify to turn it into an OS X app by following the link above in my summary.\n\n*Install Quicksilver.\n\n*Use Quicksilver to assign a keyboard shortcut to launch the new application. It is under 'Triggers.' I enjoy Quicksilver because I love having keyboard shortcuts/hotkeys to launch applications and websites on OS X.\n\n\nA: I also ran into this problem. /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/user.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend causes the system to suspend all tasks, rather than lock the screen.\nJordanBtucker was on the right track, here is the full function I use:\nlockscr() {\n  if [ \"$(defaults read com.apple.screensaver askForPasswordDelay 2>/dev/null)\" ]; then\n    local Olddelay=\"$(defaults read com.apple.screensaver askForPasswordDelay)\"\n    defaults write com.apple.screensaver askForPasswordDelay -int 0 && \\\n        pmset displaysleepnow\n    defaults write com.apple.screensaver askForPasswordDelay -int \"${Olddelay}\"\n  else\n    defaults write com.apple.screensaver askForPasswordDelay -int 0 && \\\n        pmset displaysleepnow\n    defaults delete com.apple.screensaver askForPasswordDelay\n  fi;\n}\n\nThis preserves the user his own settings but securely locks the screen :)\n\nA: On 10.14.6 Mojave, I start the screensaver engine using this command instead:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/ScreenSaverEngine.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenSaverEngine\nEdit: Make sure you set the preferences to lock the screen when the screen saver is active in system preferences and to require the password immediately.\n\nA: I use Alfred →\n\nThe universal hotkey allows me to activate it using a keyboard.\n\nA: UPDATE: 2019.\nThe Lock Screen for keychain no longer is available in current version of the MacOS Mojave & High Sierra.\nApple have now add a Lock Screen Menu item in the Apple menu.\nThis has the default keyboard short cut of crtl  + cmd  +  Q \n\n\n------------- Old answer for previous OS  below --------------\n@Bart Arondson answer goes into using some key codes to navigate the Keychain Lock Screen menu.\nAll the key codes can be bypassed using GUI Scripting to Actually hit the menu items directly.\nUsing key codes to navigate menus can be hit and miss. \nAnd as much as I do not like GUI scripting because it can also be hit and miss imho it is less hit and miss in this case.\nThis applescript code: (updated 05/18/2016, sourced from Using AppleScript to lock screen, confirmed working in El Capitan) \ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"SystemUIServer\"\n    tell (menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1 where description is \"Keychain menu extra\")\n        click\n        click menu item \"Lock Screen\" of menu 1\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nCan be used in a Automator 'Run Applescript' Action in a Automator Service Workflow.\n\nYou then give the service a Keyboard shortcut. In the usual way in The Keyboard Shortcuts.\n\nThe Service:\n\n\nA: Easy alias. Add this to your bashrc    \nalias afk=\"osascript -e 'tell application \\\"System Events\\\" to keystroke \\\"q\\\" using {command down,control down}'\"\n\ntype afk in your terminal to execute.\n\nA: I use BetterTouchTool for that purpose and assigned a keyboard shortcut to \"Switch to login screen\" (which is lock screen): doesn't fulfill the command line requirement but may be helpful to you anyway.\n \n\nA: I'm not quite sure I understand your issue here. If you require a password on screensaver, it will not stop processes from running or block you from remotely accessing your Mac. I have this option set (using ControlPlane to activate it at work and deactivate it at home) and I have never once had the system refuse to respond to a Remote Desktop, VNC, or SSH connection. In all cases where GUI access is required I just need to input the password; SSH uses key pair so no password is requested. If you don't want apps to sleep, then make sure the system power settings are such that it will not enter system sleep before you return. Just set the sleep timeout to a long delay. If you just don't want to be bothered to enter a password when you are sitting in front of the computer and working, then increase the screensaver delay to a longer time before it activates, or add a 1 min delay between screensaver and password prompt so that you have a chance to catch it before it locks you out.\nI use ctrl-shift-eject to lock the screen. It's fast, simple, and it works. This is the built-in way to lock the screen. No one is likely to come up with an alternative simply because replicating the functions already baked in to the OS is a little too redundant for anyone to put a lot of time into pursuing.\nAs far as I can tell there is no \"lock screen\" option in Keychain in 10.8 anyway, so your preferred solution is not going to exist if you ever upgrade. Edit: Didn't notice this in Keychain preferences; yes, it is still there in 10.8.\nIf you are using Automator for this can't you just package the script as an app and assign a hotkey combo or leave it in the Dock for quick access?\n\nA: Just like the question asker I was looking for a way to use the Keychains Lock Screen in a fast way.\nCombining the knowledge from an old Mac OS X hint and some Applescripting I came up with the following:\nFirst follow the steps from the linked Mac OS X hint to add a keyboard shortcut for Keychains Lock Screen functionality.\nFor me (on 10.8.4) this didn't solve the problem as I had to press ctrl+F8 to shift focus to the status bar, press down to open the Keychain menu bar, and then press ctrl+F9 to lock the screen.\nI've automated this process with the following Applescript:\n# Press ^F8\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    key code 100 using control down\nend tell\n\n# Press \"down\"\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    key code 125\nend tell\n\n# Press ^F9\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    key code 101 using control down\nend tell\n\nOpen Automator, create a new Service, add a Run Applescript module, copy-paste the above code and save the Automator Service with a name you desire.\nNow go to Keyboard Shortcuts in the System Preferences and add a keyboard shortcut for the freshly created Automator Service. I set mine to ctrl+cmd+L.\nNow press the keyboard shortcut in any app and your screen will be locked instantly.\nFor those wondering why not just go with other methods, here's my opinion on them:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fast user switching/lock screen\nWith this method I get logged out of my corporate WPA2 network. This is not good as re-connecting sometimes takes ages.\n\n*Screensaver + password\nReplicates the functionality but this means that if my laptop is inactive for some time while I'm reading a paper next to it, the screen will be locked when I want to use it again. This is undesirable.\nCoupling this method with a hot-corner has the side effect that unexperienced Mac users might trigger the hot-corner by accident leading to screen lock. I also sometimes hit a hot-corner by accident which would stall my workflow considerably.\n\n*3rd party apps\nThese are all fine, but why run a 3rd part app if it's natively available in the OS?\n\nA: As of 2021, I find the following solution to be the \"closest to correct\":\nAs pointed out in markhunte's answer, the Apple menu has an entry to initiate \"Lock Screen\" with the keyboard shortcut:\ncontrolcommandQ\nSo I simulate pressing this keyboard shortcut:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"q\" using {control down, command down}'\n\nPros:\n\n*\n\n*Will work in the future, as long as this keyboard shortcut is supported\n\n*Also works if \"Require password after sleep or screen saver begins\" security option is disabled (in contrast to the solutions which utilize sleep or display turn-off)\n\n*Display stays on (at least initially; it seems that the lock screen itself triggers a display turn-off shortly after being initiated)\n\nEdit: I just saw that Aritro Paul's answer already contains that command (in form of an alias). I hope my elaboration is helpful though.\n\nA: Ctrl-Shift-⏏ Eject (on older Macs),\nCtrl-Shift-⌽ Power (on newer macs)\n\nA: I use the Screensaver password setting with a keystroke (Ctrl+Shift+Eject) on 10.6.8, and from what I can see, it does the same as the Lock Screen item from the Keychain Access task bar icon.\nI know that this is similar to some of the other answers, but instead of the \"hot corner\", it uses a keystroke, which is more convenient for me.\nThis solution is described in more detail here, that's where I got it from: http://osxdaily.com/2011/01/17/lock-screen-mac/\nHave been using this for several years now without problems.\n\nA: Well, just combine two of the above answers. Run this command:\nopen -a /System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework//Versions/A/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app\n\nAfter having set the Security & Privacy preferences to ask for a password immediately. Make an alias for your shell if you want to make the command easier to execute. \n\nA: FWIW, I understand your situation and have been looking for a good solution to this myself. I ran across this thread because I've been searching for a somewhat faster method than what I eventually came up with.\nI came up with something that, although not exactly what I'd hoped, works and is an acceptable compromise. I'm using the same kind of GUI scripting commands as @markhunte shows (slightly different structure, but same idea) but instead of just placing it all in an Automator service workflow, I separated it into an .app bundle built with Platypus. I did this because in my travels and testing I've found that Automator services run very slowly under certain conditions. If your Mac is under any kind of stress, i.e. a disk scan running, A/V software doing something, Mail pulling down email, etc., the OS seems to push services to the back of the line. This has the affect of it taking several seconds before the workflow runs (sometimes) and on occasion even several seconds before the GUI commands in the service get run. Quite annoying if you;re trying to \"quickly\" lock your screen and it takes 10 seconds to do it!\nHaving a standalone \"app\" also has the advantage that you can use literally dozens of different 3rd party apps to run it, or just use Spotlight or an Automator service to launch the app. Any of them work. The fastest I've found is an old utility called Spark, that miraculously still works even in 10.8.4. Don't ask me how since it was last developed foe 10.4! Spark can be found here - Spark\nIn addition to all this, I combatted the issue of GUI commands sometimes running slow by bundling in cocoaDialog and calling it first when the app runs to show a small floating bubble in the middle of the screen indicating a Lock Screen is happening. Usually the lock happens right after, but if there is a delay, this at least gives some visual \"feedback\" that you pressed the right keys. I also made it self healing - if \"Enable Access to Assistive Devices\" is not on, it alerts you with a dialog and lets you enable it right away. It will also make sure the Keychain Access Menu is showing in the menu bar since this is a requirement or the GUI scripting flat out fails.\n", "Q: Forgot my password to a disk image (.sparseimage) I'm in trouble right now.\nI used Disk Utility to create a sparse image and I cannot remember the password, when I created the file I didn't select to remember in keychain.\nNow, I try to enter the possible value but it doesn't work.\nIs there any recommend way to crack the password or give some hint or some app that might be worked on this stuff.\nI really need to use the data in that file.\n\nA: CrowBar is somewhat out-of-date.\nProbably the most comprehensive and up-to-date free password-recovery package is JohnTheRipper. Among many other formats, it can test .dmg's as well. \nNote that JtR does not \"break\" the encryption, it just automates and speeds the process of trying thousands (or millions, or trillions) of dictionary-based and random passwords in hopes of eventually hitting the correct one that decrypts your data.\nJohnTheRipper is a command-line tool and requires one to be pretty well-versed in standard shell syntax, etc.\nIf you don't want to compile JtR yourself, there are also free unofficial pre-compiled Mac OS X binaries available.\nThe latest \"jumbo\" and \"magnum\" community-contributed versions can handle .dmg files, sparse-images through OS X 10.7. If you dig around in the recent patches you can even find code to handle OS X 10.8 passwords.\n\nA: Nope, with the strong encryption that Apple uses, if you lose the password, you are out of luck.\n\nA: It depends on the quality of your password, the quality of your dictionary, your time and cpu power ... https://www.georgestarcher.com/?p=228 or Spartan google helps.\n\nA: I found this in my own search.. hope it helps. http://crucialsecurityblog.harris.com/2011/03/30/4/\n\"Crack and Image a FileVault Sparsebundle\"\n\nA: \"Encryption:  DriveSavers engineers have been trained and certified by leading encryption vendors, such as GuardianEdge, Utimaco Safeguard, PGP and PointSec, to safely recover file-level and disk-level encrypted data\"\nhttp://www.drivesavers.com/recovery-services/encryption/\n", "Q: Backing Up and Restoring Contacts from Microsoft Outlook on iOS 6 I don't use Microsoft Outlook but when I backed up my iPhone 5 running iOS 6 on my laptop, it said the contacts from that application were backed up.\nHow do I find/check if the contacts are backed up and where are they stored?\n\nA: Launch Outlook and click the \"Contacts\" tab.

If i leave it charging overnight, what prevents it from overcharging my iPad(is it the charger or the iPad itself)?\n\nI ask because I also own a Dynex cable (only the USB-iPod cable, not including the charger shown in the picture below). And the Dynex cable has a note attached that says \"charging will automatically stop after 8 hrs to protect your devices, unplug and replug the charger to recharge if needed\". Why is this 8 hr charge limit needed?\nI'm guessing that it is the Dynex charger that sets the 8 hr charge limit. If I plug my Dynex cable into the iPod charger is that going to be ok? \n\n\nA: All Apple products have a charging demand circuit that senses the battery charge level and only engages charging current when the battery needs a charge.\nWhen you plug in power to the iPad, it only initially channels enough current to run the system (or boot it up if it's off) and establish some sensing of the battery. At that point, it will start charging (and drawing more current) if needed.\nIf you think of electricity like water plumbing, there are two pipes - one to run the CPU/screen and another valve that only gets open when you want to send some of the water pressure into a water tower for use later. Just like a town wouldn't pump water into the tower when it's full (or when they decide they need to send all the output into town) - the iOS device isn't a simple unregulated system where the batter gets a charge whether it wants it or not.\nThe Dynex charger simply has a time limit so it would work normally until the 8 hour shut off finished (most iOS batteries — even old failing ones — are done charging by 4-5 hours) and at that point, rather than have your iOS device stay running on wall current, the battery would have to kick in and start self-powering the device. For that reason, I would say skip the Dynex for Apple product and save it for less sophisticated / simple electronics that don't self-govern charging current.\n", "Q: Is a 10.8 Time Machine backup restorable under 10.7 I want to revert my system from 10.8 Mountain Lion to 10.7 Lion. Will Time Machine (or Migration assistant) gracefully restore my users and files created under 10.8?\n\nA: Yes, though there are caveats. I decide to try it and see; I reformatted my hard disk, installed Lion, then used Migration Assistant to restore the two user accounts. Until this point everything works perfectly, but there were two major unrelated problems to downgrading: 1) is a user account login bug with Lion that requires use of the passwordreset utility for the root account, and 2) Using Migration Assistant to migrate applications was a mistake, since many vital apps such as Safari and Mail won't work under Lion, and require many steps to reinstall properly.\n", "Q: Reload menu bar from terminal (not SystemUIServer) I am looking for a way to reload/refresh the \"apple symbol\" menu in the upper left corner from the terminal. \nSearching for ways to refresh the menu has only led me to find the command\nkillall -KILL SystemUIServer\n\nthis only reload the \"widgets\" on the right side of the menu and not the content on the left. \nI am looking for a way to do this since I have emptied the \"recent files\" menu programatically (by removing the info from the com.apple.recentitems.plist file with defaults delete com.apple.recentitems RecentDocuments) but it doesn't show up.

I am at a complete loss on what to do. \nSituation:\nI had multiple Mac computers including this one for a while. All working fine with router.\nThen I replaced my router because it was getting slow and dated, the new one I got worked fine at first, but then started to drop connection every other day and even sometimes every day. I replaced the replacement router, then my macbook air had ridiculously slow connection speed. It would take google 5-10 minutes to load. But my iMac computer worked fine. I didn't change anything, nor do anything different to either computer except get this new router. The router even managed to corrupt my time machine. So I called up the ISP and they worked me through the issues, so now everything is working fine EXCEPT my Macbook Air.\nI have tried starting from scratch with the router, with the Time Machine, I have rebooted all devices. But the internet remains the same. It's good on my iMac, my phone, my TV, but not the macbook air. I wanted to call Apple, but it costs $60 to talk to a someone which is not affordable for me. I am really frustrated with this. \nI went through all the changes with my Airport Utility. I even reset my Macbook Air to factory default settings. Still I have the same issue.\nWhat can I do to troubleshoot this problem?\n\nA: Have you tried going to the Network preference pane in System Preferences, clicking on Advanced, then Wi-Fi, and deleting all the Preferred Networks? I seem to recall having the same problem a few years ago, and deleting the networks fixed it. \n\nA: Deleting all networks in Mac, System Preferences, Network fixed the identical problem for me.\n\nA: The following are all suggestions I've tried from different sources:\n\n\n*\n\n*moving preferred network to top\n\n*clearing all WiFi passwords (including those from the keychain) and reconnecting only to the preferred network\n\n*disabling bluetooth\n\n*forcefully removing network configuration files\n\n*adding a fixed DNS server\nWhat actually helped was to reset the SMC and reset the PRAM. Now the Mac connects instantly to the WiFi. And it fixed the ping delays as well I had (ping times were up to 4 times higher than from another Macbook).\n\nA: With seven years of experience in the technical industry I troubleshooted this error for a very long time and was very frustrated! The only thing that fixed it was this\n\n\n*\n\n*Login to your router and reset all settings\n\n*connect to your router with no wifi security\n\n*once you confirm that the wireless connected fine, then\n\n*setup your wifi router with WPA and reconfigure your passphrase/wifi password again\n\n*re-connect to your secured wifi\n\n\nAfter doing this I now have internet.

I am constantly having issues with disc space, but have no idea what is consuming it all. When I look at the disc utility break down, it says about 80% of the used space is taken up by 'Other' while the remaining 20% is photos, music and applications.\nI've searched everywhere but have no idea what is using all this space. The biggest program I have on is Photoshop and perhaps XCode. I dont have any video files and I dont even tend to save .PSDs.\nWould anyone know what could be taking up this space?\nThanks!\n\nA: Grand Perspective is a bit of open source software that visualises the space taken up in a folder. Run it and look for the biggest squares. Hover your mouse over a square and the bottom left of the window shows you the full path to the file you are hovering over.\nI prefer it to letting the finder calculate folder sizes, because this is much faster and the results are very easy to understand.\n\nA: If you don't want to get a tool like What Size (also on the App Store) or Daisy Disk, you can simply tell finder to calculate all sizes by ticking the second lowest check mark in the view options (Command-J) and browse your computer in list view:\n\nClick on Size to sort by size and drill down into folders clicking the triangle next to the largest folders until you have your culprits.\n\n\nA: One more suggestion: OmniDiskSweeper, free and fast:\nhttp://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnidisksweeper/\nedited to add: Plus Omnidisksweeper has the advantage of being able to delete the files or directories in the application if you come across huge files you're sure you don't want.

It will show a dialog box that tells you the exact size of the folder.\nStart in \"Macintosh HD\", and right click each folder in there and Get Info.  Go into the biggest ones there and root out the biggest folders that way.\n", "Q: How can I create a dictionary for Mac OS X? Dictionary seems to be several versions ahead of the Apple documentation (2007).  I found a good blog post about it, but everything seems different now.  I installed Xcode (including the command line tools) but nothing is where it's supposed to be (e.g. /Developer does not get created and there is no Dictionary\\ Development\\ Kit).  I would like to make a pretty complicated dictionary, so I'd like to make this work instead of convert file types several times.\n\nA: Here is a step by step procedure for converting dictionaries in open formats to AppleDict source, and compiling for the OSX Dictionary.app: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/119166/66812\n\nA: Xcode no longer comes with Dictionary Development Kit, but you don't even need Xcode to use it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Register a free developer account and download the auxiliary tools package from developer.apple.com/downloads *It is now called: Additional Tool for Xcode (look for the latest version)\n\n*Move the Dictionary Development Kit folder to /Applications/Utilities/DictionaryDevelopmentKit/ (without the spaces), and copy the project_templates folder to ~/Desktop/\n\n*Open ~/Desktop/project_templates/Makefile and change DICT_BUILD_TOOL_DIR from /DevTools/Utilities/Dictionary Development Kit to /Applications/Utilities/DictionaryDevelopmentKit\n\n*cd ~/Desktop/project_templates/; make && make install\nThe dictionary should show up in Dictionary.app after you quit and reopen it. After that, try editing MyDictionary.xml or MyDictionary.css. The dictionary name is the same as CFBundleName in the Info.plist, and the bundle name is DICT_NAME in the Makefile.\nIf the lookup popovers show results from an older version of the dictionary, try logging out and back in. Terminating com.apple.lookupd or removing ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.Dictionary* didn't seem to work.\n\nA: Everything that used to be in /Developer is now in Xcode.app/Contents/Developer with Xcode normally in /Applications, but you could put it anywhere in reality.\nOther than that, you should be able to pop the dictionary file of your choosing either in the System Dictionary like the blog article you linked or only within Xcode for use to expand its dictionary.\n\nA: I wrote a little java application toDictionaryXML to add entries to a custom dictionary. It is not well coded, the functionality is pretty poor and it is not easy to install. But still it saves me a lot of time.\n", "Q: Alternatives To Apple Dock - Taskbar This box helps explain the association that I always have had.\n \nWe bought a Mac.  I like many parts about it.  It syncs with my iphone etc...\nI can't learn the dock.  I am afraid we might need to move back to Windows.  I can't stand it.  I've tried explaining to myself how to minimize it into the corner and tried minimizing applications to icon, but no luck.\nIs there an application to display a list?  I'm not looking for alternative techniques for understanding.  I really needs a list, not a dock.\nPreferably it would work look similar to Windows Dock.\nHaving used applications like Quicksilver before, and knowing the ingenuity and geniuses in the Mac community it feels like someone could create something like this.\n\nA: uBar is a Windows-style taskbar for OS X that I developed. Be sure to set Window Grouping to Never in the preferences, and it will exactly replicate the behaviour you are looking for.\n\n\nA: This answer only works for older OS versions (<=10)\nDragThing is a commercial application that can display a list of running applications. It can be configured to create a Windows-like taskbar.\n\n*\n\n*Click the  in the topleft corner, click Dock, then click Left or Right to move the dock to left or right. (so it won't get in the way of the Windows-like taskbar you are going to create, while you can still use it as a handy app launcher.)\n\n*Download DragThing (thanks to this page for telling me about it) . It costs US $29 but you can try it for free. However, if you like it you should buy it.\n\n*Open the downloaded DMG file, drag the DragThing icon to the applications folder, delete the DMG file, open the applications folder (or Launchpad if you have Mountain Lion) and open DragThing.\n\n*Make sure DragThing is the active application (It says \"DragThing\" next to the  in the topleft corner then), press ⌘+0 and close all the DragThing windows except the one that appeared when you pressed that.\n\n*Right click on the window that appeared when you pressed ⌘+0 and click Rotate.\n\n*Drag it to the center of the bottom of the screen.\n\n*Right click again on it and click \"Dock settings...\".\n\n*Set the following (got most of it from this page):\n\n\nSet \"Float Dock Window\" to Always\nTurn \"Show Window Title Bar\" off\nSet \"Icon Size\" to 16×16\nSet \"Spacing\" to 0\nSet \"Width\" to about 70\nSet \"Show Item Names\" to Right\nTurn \"Use Single-Click To Open Items\" on (can be found at Advanced tab)\nTurn \"Lock position\" on (can be found at Advanced tab)\n9. Close the window\n10. Enjoy your shiny new taskbar! Eventually right click it and select a new color.\n\n\n\nA: Maybe Hyperdock helps. It shows thumbnails of all open program windows when resting the mouse pointer on a dock icon. One can click on a thumbnail in order to bring the respective window to the front.\n\nI cannot live without. Available from the app store.\n\nA: A 32 bit app for Mojave and lower was DragThing\nIt will not work for current OS and is not open sourced or available for sale now.\n\nHere is some more information about DragThing, in addition to com. BOY's answer.\nI have owned and used this program for more than ten years. There is a free trial; the app costs US $29.\nAmong other features, DragThing can be configured to display a floating \"Process Dock\", a panel of the icons of applications that are currently open and running -- and only the ones currently running. Unlike the Dock, it does not show icons of applications that are not running right now. (You can create other panels or docks to display tabbed groups of icons of frequently-used applications that you want to launch.)\n\nYou can position DragThings' Process Dock on the bottom of the screen if you want; I have it in the upper-right corner of my screen. Visually, you can choose from many different color schemes and designs. I chose the \"heads-up-display\" translucent black design.\nIn the \"Process Dock\", clicking on one of these open application icons will immediately bring that application to the forefront. This is analogous to the bar at the bottom of the Windows desktop.\nThere are four kinds of panels or docks that DragThing can create:\n\n*\n\n*Dock to show tabbed multiple panels of your favorite apps organized\nand grouped any way you like\n\n*Disk Dock to show connected hard disks, CDs and DVDs, and servers\n\n*Process Dock, as I have discussed above\n\n*Window Dock to show open application windows (your elderly relative might be able to use this too.)\n\nDragThing is not designed to be \"Windows-like\". If anything, it resembles features of Mac OS 9, the \"classic\" MacOS. But I think it will do the trick.\nDragThing has myriad configuration settings that you can customize; far too many. It's daunting. But once you figure out the features and configure it the way you want, it will just work.\nI have used DragThing for more than ten years. I can't live without it.\nHaving configured everything I want in two DragThing panels: a Process Dock in the upper right-hand corner of my screen; and a tabbed icon panel on the bottom of my screen, I subsequently banished Apple's Dock off the screen and I virtually never use or look at Apple's Dock anymore.\nHere is a review of DragThing from MacWorld Magazine from two months ago.\nIf you can't figure out how to configure DragThing to function like you want, you can email the developer, James Tomson, for tech support.\n\nA: DockShelf is a general Dock replacement and can be used to add process docks to any side of the screen (shown at different sizes, styles and as a tab in the screen shot).\nI use Windows on and off for short periods of time and managing windows is a problem for me also so I'd recommend not minimizing windows at all but instead hiding an application (command-H) when you're not using it.\nWhen you select another application using any of the dock methods mentioned, all the windows will appear on screen at once.\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure I am the developer of DockShelf.\n", "Q: What is the meaning of an icon that appears next to the Location field in Calendar app? It only appears when the event location is entered for an event which lives in a Google calendar. (I have a Google CalDAV account set up in my Calendar.app) If I make the event go to a local or iCloud calendar, the icon disappears.\nThe icon appears as soon the field loses focus and the location text becomes \"tokenized\" (like someone’s name and email in Mail.app for example). It is a tiny exclamation point inside a yellow circle. The tooltip just repeats the location text when hovering over the icon\n.\n\nA: You can find what the exclamation point means in Calendar Help>View events>Calendar symbols:\n\nThe explanation \"the item isn’t recognized as a valid entry by the server\" is somewhat misleading. Even when the event is created using Google's web interface (so you would expect the server validated your location information) Calendar complains about the location and shows the dreaded exclamation point.\nThere seems to be some kind of mismatch between the information Google calendar exports through CalDAV and what Calendar expects. This is probably also the reason why location information in an imported Google calendar is shown inside a bubble:\n\nThat's not the case for iCloud Calendar events.\nA Google search shows many posts of other people who have the same problem. Nobody seems to have found a solution, though. I don't think you can do much about it.\n", "Q: Is there a way to sort photos by file size in iPhoto? I have a bunch of photos and videos in iPhoto and I'd like to find the largest videos particularly to see if I can delete them to make some space. It seems strange that I can't find an option to do this in iPhoto - am I missing something?\n\nA: No, there is no way to sort on size in iPhoto. From your context I guess you mean filesize. In iPhoto, size means the dimensions on the Photo (length by breadth, measured in pixels) - see the Export dialogue, for instance. iPhoto is all about the images and not the files that contain them, so I'm not surprised. It's a $15 app, you get a lot, but not everything.\n\nA: In a round-about way it can be done - although not from right within the iPhoto GUI - if you know the approximate dates or album names on the files you would like to delete. It's likely not as fast as you were hoping for as you have to go date by date (which I guess isn't helpful if every video was taken/imported on a different day), but it might be faster than examining the metadata for each and every photo/video within iPhoto within these albums (depending on your situation).\nBe very careful not to delete or move anything while in this folder other than the photos/videos you wish to get rid of otherwise you could break the library file.\nI would also STRONGLY suggest backing up your iPhoto library before trying this method.\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit iPhoto\n\n*Locate your iPhoto library (default file path is usually ~/Pictures/iPhoto library)\n\n*Right Click > Show Package Contents\n\n*Locate the \"Masters\" folder in the list and open it\n\n*Folders are broken down by date and subfolders are usually by album\n\n*Once you've located an album arrange files by size using Finder's view menu\n\n*Move any files you no longer wish to keep to a new folder on your Desktop\n\n*Relaunch iPhoto and ensure that everything is working correctly (and notice that the files you moved are gone!)\n\n*If you're comfortable with how everything looks you can now move that folder on your Desktop to the Trash and empty the Trash to regain the hard drive space\n\n*If you now have a problem with iPhoto I would just restore the iPhoto library from the backup you made before starting this process! (You'll be back to square 1, yes, but at least iPhoto will look proper again.)\n\n\nAs you can see you still have to go through each album, but at least you can see the file size of every file within that album all at once without having to inspect each photo and video individually. \nHope this speeds things up a bit for anyone with this same task in mind!\n", "Q: Dell monitor display interference I have an early 2011 Macbook Pro. I'm running a Dell 2407 monitor using a VGA adapter and I get intermittent wavy lines on the external display. If I open the display menu on the monitor itself while the problem happens, the overlaid menu is not 'waving'. If I adjust the pixel clock on the monitor while the wavy lines are there, this temporarily resolves the problem\nI'm using VGA as the DVI connection had other issues - intermittent noise / snow. I will probably replace the Macbook later this year and maybe even upgrade to a new thunderbolt display but in the meantime, this is incredibly annoying.\nThis video shows the wavy lines I'm seeing (but this was not uploaded by me) - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEyUk6S07iQ\nI've plugged the monitor into a completely separate power source and can't identify any other source of interference.\nI'm running OSX 10.8.2 Mountain Lion. The display adapter is an official apple one.\n\nA: VGA cables are generally not designed for the high bandwidth required of large, digital displays, so it wouldn't surprise me if this is a cable issue that would be present in a variety of cables.  I had similar issues with a KVM adapter.  (If you're using a KVM adapter, then the KVM itself is probably the problem.)\nOne thing to try would be to lower the refresh rate on the monitor to the lowest setting the Mac will allow and see if that solves the problem.  \nBetter would be to get the DVI cable working, but again the intermittent noise/snow points to a bandwidth limitation of the cable (or KVM adapter).  \n\nA: Replacing the power cable of the monitor is one possible solution, assuming the cable is the cause. There have been multiple instances of various Dell Monitor/Power Cable combos that have caused everything from strange output to jumpy mouses! This is inconsistent and can sometimes happen from even just certain positions of the cable.\nWorked for a friend, and other on the net.\n\nA: Maybe a DSL modem or DSL cable, or the DSL socket. Or a microwave oven.\nTry in an empty room, in another house… to see whether the problem is specific to your environment.\n", "Q: Shorcut to show all Finder windows Wondering if there's a shortcut available to show all open Finder windows?

When I returned I was told I needed a new hard drive which I expected and also a new Display assembly part 661-5040 because my isight cable was broken or almost broken and it would stop the MBP from starting up correctly when a new drive was installed into the machine.\nI basically asked surely a new cable can be installed, but was told a new display assembly had to be installed which i thought was strange and very pricey at £355.\nAlong with a new hard drive, the Apple store wanted me to pay £598.80 in total to get my MBP fixed.\nI basically just wanted to know, if anyone had heard of the an isight broken or wore cable causing a MBP not to startup? \nI've since booted up my MBP with an external drive and the isight camera is working fine along with the display. I've ordered and new hard drive myself to install as £120 for a 500gb drive i thought was too pricey from Apple.\nAnyone else been misdiagnosed by there Apple Store???\nAny information would be helpful to me.\n\nA: Unsure about a 2009 MBP, but I had a 2010 MBP that booted fine even when the iSight cable was not connected to the motherboard (the motherboard was new and was being tested before all cables are connected).\n\nA: I've seen many many instances where faulty display cables caused MacBook (and Air and Pro) to fail to boot. As I mentioned in the comments, any time you get a quote that doesn't make sense, ask a bit for more details.\nExplain you can't see the error / don't have experience and ask if it is something you can see or something they tested or just something they know because they see hundreds of that machine each month and it's something they know from experience.\nWithout knowing how long they had the machine in, it could be something they got from an automated test using software or something they experienced by putting a good drive in and then checking that other work might need to be done.\n\nA: I have a MacBook Pro 13\" from 2009 and I can confirm that the iSight cable can indeed prevent you from boot, white screen shows up and after NVRAM reset everything works again until next boot. So yes, in my case it's only that cable.\n", "Q: Restoring a jailbroken iPhone I'm trying to restore a iPhone 3g I got that was jailbroken. I plugged it into itunes and hit restore and received the error 1015 that it could not be restored. I've tried using the tinyumbrella solution I believe I did it correctly but it did not work. Anyone have any suggestions?\n\nA: You need to put it in DFU mode before restoring...\nThis can be done by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes and connect the iPhone to your Mac or PC.\n\n*Press and hold the Home button and the Sleep/Wake button at the same time. After\nexactly 10 seconds release the Sleep/Wake button. Continue holding\nthe home button until you iTunes pops up a message telling you that\nit has detected an iPhone in recovery mode. \n\n*The iPhone screen will remain black.\nNOTE***: It may take a few attempts to get your iPhone into DFU mode. Generally, I hold down both buttons then release the Home button just before I think the Apple logo would appear. If you are still holding both buttons down and you see the Apple logo you are holding them down for too long!\n", "Q: How would I access my 2012 MacBook Air's Hard drive? I recently spilled liquid on my 2012 13' macbook air (4,2) and now I would like to access the data that is (hopefully) still stored on my harddrive. What would I buy to read the data externally, as my laptop is currently not working. Is there a special wire or case that I have to get?\nThanks in advance for any help.\n\nA: This site claims that the drive is not officially user replaceable, but it’s simply a case of the connector being different.\nBut you say it’s the Mid 2012 model 4,2? That is the model number for the Mid 2011 model as per the specifications listed here. iFixit has a good rundown on how to get to that one. And Other World Computing sells and external enclosure called the Envoy that can take that internal SSD and make it an external USB 3.0 drive. Instructions on how to install a drive in that Envoy enclosure are here as well.\n", "Q: Do iPod Nanos have USB 2 or 3? Which version of USB do iPod Nanos have?\nApple's tech spec says it works with a Mac having 2 or 3, but USB is backward compatible so that doesn't help...\n\nA: All iPhones and iPods with the Lightning connector use USB 2.0. From Wikipedia:\n\nThe Lightning connector … provides an interface to USB 2.0 (for data and charging)\n\nAlso, if you look the USB end of a Lightning cable, it doesn't have the additional pins for USB 3.0.\nThere is actually no point to having USB 3.0, since the flash memory in iPods and iPhones is not fast enough to benefit from its speed.\n\nA: The current (7th) generation of iPod Nano (I'm assuming your referring to the 7th) utilizes a Lightning port. This port in turn utilizes a Lightening to USB 2.0 cable, that in turn plugs into the appropriate USB 3.0 (or earlier) port on your computer. In other words, it will plug into a USB 3.0 port even though it's only a USB 2.0 cable.\nHere is a link to the actual specification\nPer the Apple specification:\n\n\"Mac computer with USB 2.0 or 3.0 port, OS X v10.6.8 or later, and\n  iTunes 10.7 or later\"\n\n", "Q: How to pass inputs to a shell script in automator?

It also doesnt not show up when holding option during boot. This external drive is a clone made with Carbon Copy Cloner. I have cloned the recovery partition as well using CCC. The external disk is not ecrypted, but the Macbook I am doing this from is with Filevault2. It shows up properly when connected as long as I don't restart the OS. If the OS is restarted, the drive will not show up in Finder, Disk Utility, System Information, or Terminal. But when I disconnect the drive and connect it again it shows up and mounts.\nI fixed drive #2 issue by deleting my Time Machine backup from the Time Machine System Preferences and as soon as I connected it, showed up and asked for password. Well now I know nothing is wrong with my USB3, but still would like to know why I can't boot drive #1.\nMy other issue is another external USB3 drive(#2) from the same company, but more expensive model. This is my Time Machine backup. It is encrypted using the Time Machine GUI in system preferences. It doesn't ask for my password when plugged in. I have used it many times before. This drive will not show up in Finder, Disk Utility, System Information or Terminal when plugged in. Obviously it needs my password to decrypt the volume, but why isn't it asking me? The drive has sufficient power.\nObviously there is something going on with my Mac. Please help and let me know if you need more information.

If I plug either my Time Machine or clone which are both USB3 into a USB2 hub, both are recognized at boot using either option or command+r. You could also use a regular USB2 cable to force to USB2. This is not unusual as my Windows desktop I built is the same because the BIOS doesn't support USB3 yet. The USB3 functionality is implemented through a separate chip from the Processor or Chipset. I wonder if this is the same for MacBooks....\n\nA: Could be USB 3.0 flakiness. I really like the speed when it works, but I have run into quirks. Review this official Using USB 3 devices on Mac computers FAQ from Apple to see if it offers any insight.\nIn my case, I have a 2012 Mac mini. USB 3.0. But I have USB 1.0 & USB 2.0 devices connected directly to the Mac mini.  Cold start from shutdown or reboot?  The USB 3.0 devices are recognized, but only as “high speed” USB 2.0 devices & not “super speed” USB 3.0 devices.  The solution? Unmount the drive, power down the enclusore or remove the USB cable, replug it in & power it up.  And then the drive shows up as a “super speed” USB 3.0 device.  Very annoying.\nApple’s FAQ addresses USB 3.0 speed slowing down to the slowest USB device, but not this weirdo mix where it’s mis-recognizes the device speed on startup or reboot but is properly recognized on a running machine but only if the drive is plugged in or powered on after boot.\nEDIT: So reread and saw the mention of Filevault2 and Carbon Copy Cloner. This thread on the Carbon Copy Cloner support forum seems to be apt to this issue. Long story short, when you say:\n\nThe external disk is not ecrypted, but the Macbook I am doing this\n  from is with Filevault2.\n\nIf you make an exact clone of an encrypted volume, the copy is encrypted.\n", "Q: Dig not returning authority section?

I have had an iTunes account for myself and have now attached my kids new iPods to that account as they are too young to have their own accounts/ids.  My question is;  Is there a way to have multiple users under the same account.  \nThe problem is that unless we write down every single purchase they make, there is no way of knowing which child has spent their allocation of the gift card amounts! Also discovered that there are 'in-app' purchases which may cost 'game money' or real money and sometimes difficult for kids to tell which.  They don't need a password and they don't show on your transaction history!\nIt would be so much easier if you could set up 1 account - mine, so I can monitor and control what they are buying, but have multiple users so we attach a gift card (or credit card) to each user. That way they know when their own allocation has run out.  Please tell me there is a way to do this.  I am sure lots of families are in the same situation.\nI am not particularly savvy in the ways of iTunes and clouds etc so would really appreciate a simple 'non-techie' answer.\n\nA: Gift cards are tied to iTunes accounts so if you want to let the store keep track of the different gift cards you will at least have to set up individual iTunes accounts for each of them (and yourself). Of course this also means that you have to switch the user in iTunes accordingly each time you want to make a purchase.\nThinking ahead, this approach is somewhat future-proof as well. In a few years your kids will switch to their own computer account with their individual iTunes installation etc. If they already have an individual iTunes account as well they can keep using their apps without having to bother you in case of upgrades etc.\n", "Q: Trying to use a Canon MP210 printer with OS X running 10.8.2 I am honestly not sure if the problem is with the OS or with the printer. I can use this printer with a windows machine without any trouble. However, when I try to use it with my Mac, is just complains that I don't have any color ink...which is true. I only have black ink in the printer. I just want to be able to print and cannot seem to tell the printer to just use the black ink and ignore the fact that no color ink is available.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences/Print & Scan and click on Open Print Queue. This will open a window that includes Settings, both under the Printer menu of this app (which in my case is named Epson320) and in the toolbar (customize toolbar, if not.)\nAnother way to access this window is to go to ~/Library/Printers and double click on the printer icon you will find there, which is actually an app. Or if your printer is in the dock (and this icon can be dragged to the dock, like any application) Settings will be in the dock menu. \nIn Settings, at least with my printer and I suspect yours as well, under the Driver tab, there is an option \"Permit Temporary Black Printing.\"\nSee if that doesn't do it. \n\nA: How to change/add Print settings (fast, B&W) on MacBook with Canon MP210 (and other models).\n\n\n*\n\n*Click \"Print\" for your doc.\n\n*Page will show a preview of your doc to be printed.\n\n*Below \"Orientation\" is a scroll down menu.

This resolved the issue for me.\nI found this trick on the Arch Linux samba wiki\n\nA: BlueHarvest is probably the best and easiest way to maintain the network shares clean, at least that's what I went for after taking up most of your options myself.\nAfter that is a cron job for deleting all of those files, using something like:\nfind \"$@\" \\( -name \".DS_Store\" -or -name \".TemporaryItems\" -or -name \".Trashes\" -or -name \"._*\" \\) -exec rm -rf \"{}\" \\; -prune \n\n\nA: sshfs has a noappledouble option that stops at least .Spotlight-V100 from being created in my (very limited) testing...\nmkdir -p /Volumes/user && /usr/local/bin/sshfs \\\n    -o volname=user,local,cache=no,allow_root,noappledouble,defer_permissions,reconnect,ServerAliveInterval=15,ServerAliveCountMax=3 \\\n    user@nas.local:/mnt/tank/homes/user \\\n    /Volumes/user\n\nIf using sshfs is an option you might consider this solution.\n", "Q: Set off alarm when receiving text from a certain number?

If you go to your sound settings and change the default text tone to \"none\" and then go to your contacts and change the text tone for whichever contact you want a notification from to something that DOES have sound, you will only get audible text alerts from that specific contact. \nHowever this will not work if the phone is muted, or if Do-Not-Disturb is enabled.\nI just tested this theory and it works.

That worked, but was very slow, and stopped working after about 45 minutes of use.\nHow can this be? What can I do about this? Can anyone recomend a good USB WiFi adapter compatible with OS X?\nUPDATE: I fixed this by switching to DHCP with manual IP address and selecting a new IP address. The problem then migrated to my iPad2 (iOS 5.x) when it claimed that IP, but the same fix worked there. It never effected any of the iPhones in the house (iOS 5.1 jailbroken and iOS 6.x not jailbroken) or the other MacBook (10.8.x). The mystery remains, but the internets work so I try not to worry about it.\n\nA: Hi the problem is with your DNS settings the Mac you are using cannot resolve the request into an IP address.  If you look at the other Macs in your house you should copy down the settings and opens System Preferences, Network and compare the settings. If your mac is set for DHCP then your router is not passing on the DNS settings of your ISP, or if it is the same as the Router then the Router cannot act as a DNS server, choose the DNS IP of your ISP that is sure to work. \n", "Q: Any way to change the location of Time Machine local backups (./MobileBackups) to another drive? I am running an SSD boot drive and a HDD drive on my Macbook Pro 5,5 and I obviously cannot have Time Machine filling up my SSD. I was wondering if there was anyway to have time machine create local backups of the users on my SSD, but store it on my HDD and be able to use the typical features of time machine local backups, because otherwise it would be unnecessary. If this question has been asked, I would appreciate a link, because I searched and could not find anything. Otherwise, thank you very much any help you can offer.\n\nA: I couldn't find any way of modifying the path /.MobileBackups, but you can create a folder on your HDD and then symlink it to /.MobileBackups:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Applications>Utilities>Terminal. \nNow you will have to type several commands. Press return after every command for it to execute. When asked, type your password.\n\n*The snapshots folder has complex permissions. The simplest way to preserve them is to copy the existing folder to the new location on your HDD:\nsudo rsync -ahvHE /.MobileBackups /Volumes/HDD/\n(replace /Volumes/HDD with the path to your HDD.) \nrsync options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*-a: archive mode (recursive; copy symlinks as symlinks; preserve permissions, times, owner, group, device files, sockets and fifos)\n\n*-h: output result in human-readable format\n\n*-v: verbose, that is, show what the command is doing \n\n*-H: preserve hardlinks\n\n*-E: copy extended attributes like resource forks and ACLs\n\n\n*Disable local snapshots (this will delete /.MobileBackups and its contents):\nsudo tmutil disablelocal\n\n*Create symlink:\nsudo ln -s /Volumes/HDD/.MobileBackups /.MobileBackups\n(replace /Volumes/HDD with the path to your HDD.)\n\n*Enable local snapshots:\nsudo tmutil enablelocal\n\n*Create a local snapshot:\nsudo tmutil snapshot\n\n*If you see a new snapshot dated \"now\":\nls -l /Volumes/HDD/.MobileBackups/Computer/\n(...)\ndrwxr-xr-x@ 3 root  wheel  102 Jan 28 09:05 2013-01-28-090534\n\nyou're done!\nIf something went wrong or is not working as expected, revert to the original configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable local snapshots:\nsudo tmutil disablelocal\nThis will delete the symlink /.MobileBackups. Should that not be the case, delete it with:\nsudo rm /.MobileBackups\n\n*Enable local snapshots:\nsudo tmutil enablelocal\n\n*Delete alternative snapshot folder on your HDD:\nsudo rm -rf /Volumes/HDD/.MobileBackups\n(rm -rf is a dangerous command that won't ask for confirmation before deleting the folder. Make sure the path is correct!)\n\nA: If you are running OSX 10.8 or higher, something happens when you disable local snapshots such that the existing snapshots are no longer accessible via TM.

They do not integrate with TS-Gateway out of the box or with any software I've seen.\nOn the Mac side, you need either a location service (like Back to my Mac or Screens connect client) or a VPN tunnel to get your client past the firewall and back into the local network.\nAlso on the Mac side, you simply enable either Remote Management or Screen Sharing as both can turn on the VNC server and allow incoming network requests to be served.\nSince I put a lot of OR options in the text, here is what you need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn ON VNC in Sharing preference pane\n\n*Open VNC ports (or bypass the firewall with NAT/VPN or ssh tunneling) on the Mac and incoming from the network\n\n*A VNC client similar to iTap if it does not work with plain VNC implementations.\n\n", "Q: Can I download Mountain Lion and install it later? Can I download Mountain Lion from the App Store and install it on my machine later? I have a very slow Internet connection at home, but I am traveling with my MacBook now and have temporary access to a faster connection. I'd like to take advantage of the fast connection to download Mountain Lion, but I don't want to install it until I return home and make a backup of the machine first.\n\nA: Yes, the App store downloads an installer for Mountain Lion and stores it in the usual spot - /Applications.\nYou should only need a network connection after installing to get updates, etc.. and not to run the installer outright.\nBe aware that the installation process deletes the installer once you are done installing the OS, so you might make a backup copy of the Install OS X Mountain Lion program before you run it.\n\nA: There are a few complications to be aware of, and I think Apple is tweaking the download behavior. The answer above only works if you're an Administrator user, you haven't downloaded ML before, and you don't have an old copy of your install file in reach of Spotlight.\nAlso the download from App Store launches installer, so you have to quit to save it.\nThe best description of how to do this that I've found is here:\nhttp://lifehacker.com/5929045/install-mountain-lion-on-as-many-macs-as-you-want-without-purchasing-additional-copies\nBriefly (I'll do a blog post on this):\n\n\n*\n\n*You need to do this from an admin account. I think if you use a non-admin account and quit the installer OS X deletes the download.\n\n*If you do this from an admin account Lifehacker suggests creating a fresh admin account for the download. I don't know if that's necessary, but I do know that if you quit the installer the installer does a Spotlight search looking for a previous Mountain Lion OS X Installer and then updates the previous installer. So you won't find it in Applications though the Installer icon will show up in Launchpad.\n\n", "Q: Are there add-ons for Mail? Does Mail on Mac OS have any add-ons applicable ? Such as the ones possible in website-based Gmail application ?\nI would like a feature that allows me to UNDO a sent message. Gmail has an addon which accomplishes this.\nIs it possible in the Mail app ?\n\nA: There are plug-ins available for Apple Mail.  Some are plug-ins, some are AppleScripts.  \nYou could easily accomplish this via AppleScript.  For example, here's a set of AppleScripts for Apple Mail that includes a delay send one, although the author of those scripts notes that they haven't been updated recently and might not work with more current versions of OS X.  You'll have to try it and see.  Since it's an AppleScript, if you're willing to get your hands dirty, you can edit it to better meet your needs.\nAnother option is Mail Scheduler, which includes delayed send as well as several other related items.\n\nA: There are actually quite a lot of addons for mail.app (See here and here—unfortunately these are both cobweb sites). \nTechnically it's not possible to \"unsend\" an e-mail message. It would be possible to queue up a message that would be sent automatically a few minutes later, and that would give you time to catch those mistakes you normally catch the second you hit \"send\".

As such, when using turn-by-turn navigation, street names are pronounced as though they were English words, and are barely recognizable.\nIs there a way to get Google Maps' navigation feature to speak my language without changing the systemwide language setting?\n\nA: Since iOS 13, you can now change each application's default language, and that is possible for Google Maps too, by going to Settings > Google Maps > Preferred Language (at the very bottom of that screen). You should be able to select one from the multiple languages you have installed on the iPhone (by default, of course, Google Maps will use the iPhone's 'standard' language).\nIf you don't see any other language there (besides the 'standard' one, i.e. the one the iPhone is displaying everywhere), then you can add more languages by going to Settings > General > Language & Region > Other Languages... and add there all the languages you wish; then go back to Settings > Google Maps > Preferred Language and the new language(s) should be available for selection!\nSource: https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/change-languages-per-app-basis-your-iphone-ios-13-0208770/ (last accessed 2019-11-22)\n\nA: Unfortunately, Google Maps doesn't have Language controls built into the app. It cues off of the settings in Settings.app > General > International.\nThe only way to have Google Maps speak a different language is to change the actual settings in Settings.app > General > International > Language. \nOf course, this doesn't take long to change, and it may be desirable to change it before using turn-by-turn for perhaps a long trip.\nIt would be a good idea to request that feature from Google by opening the Google Maps app and tapping the person icon in the upper right corner. Then tap \"Send Feedback\" and compose a request to Google.\nMinor Update\nYou can now set voice search language in the app. There is a mic icon on the right in the search box that you can tap to basically dictate the location. While that doesn't apply to your question, perhaps that would be a first, mildly helpful step. \n\nA: I changed the phone language settings and it is the easiest fix, and will help you improve your Spanish, or you could try a different GPS app\n\nA: You can now set the voice language without changing the system language.\n\n", "Q: Computer starts up to gray screen, in recoevery mode getting \"Open Error 5: Input/Output error on System/CoreServcices/ManagedClient.app/* Computer starts up to gray screen, in recoevery mode getting \"Open Error 5: Input/Output error on System/CoreServcices/ManagedClient.app/*\nMy computer turned to sludge, and I hit the power button and shut it down.\nOn startup, we got to login screen, put in my password, wait for minutes..no go\nManual shutdown.\nOn startup we get the white screen of death.\nPut disk into recovery mode, got the recovery OS going, and opened disk utility.\nMy Macnitosh HD was still there, but I ran \"Verify permissions\" and got the above error for a long time. Eventually, I stopped the process and hit \"Verify Disk\".\nThis happened quickly, and it tells me that my Disk can't be repaired. (Not sure how to get a backup from the files I have, so help with that would be good)\nWhen I go to the menu and hit \"Statup Disk\" my copy of Mountain Lion is not present.\nNot exactly sure what to do in terms of backup, installing a new OS, repairs.\nWhaty should I do?\n\nA: You need to specify what year/model your Mac is, and what operating system came with the system.\nLet's assume that \"Lion\" came pre-installed and you have the option of a \"Recovery Partition\". You need to first format your hard-drive, removing everything (making sure that you have a back-up!!) and then:\n1) Switch off your mac\n2) Book your Mac and press and hold the ⌘ (Command) key and R key immediately; after the first chime sounds. You must keep holding down both the Command and R keys until you see a window with “OS X Utilities” across the top in large text. This should enable you to do a fresh re-install. \nThe second way to access the recovery partition is to re-boot your mac and hold onto the (options) key. \nIf you do not have a recovery partition on your hard-drive you need to seek someone who has a Mac with lion+ on and download the OS X Recovery Disk Assistant v1.0 and placing a new image onto a memory stick, and following the steps above with the memory stick. \nIf your Disk cannot be repaired, then, there maybe an issue with the disk itself. Or, you could try and \"Erase\" the disk and doing a fresh re-install. Again, you need to TRY the best you can to ensure you back up all the data before trying any of these steps. But, it seems to me (personally) that this may not be an option for you. \nI hope this helps :)\n", "Q: New to Apple TV - struggling with AirPlay and Home Sharing Can't get subject to work consistently. Some times I can access AirPlay on my Macbook Pro. On my iPhone (4S) and my iPad (3rd gen) I can't find the airplay icon. \nThe Home Sharing option has never worked - I have checked the firewall (it's off) and all units are connected to the same wireless network (a wifi extender)\nAny ideas on how I can get to use the full potential of my new \"toy\" (The Apple TV 3rd gen)\n\nA: The design of iOS isn't helping you troubleshoot this issue since it suppresses the AirPlay icon until a device detects a receiver on the local subnet.\nJust being on the same network isn't enough, the devices need to see broadcast traffic that works best with IPv6 support and can also work when you only are routing IPv4 traffic.\nThe simplest thing to do is power off the extender and see if you can confirm that the two devices see each other.\nSadly, I don't see this documented well by Apple, but here is one article that explains you might not see the AirPlay icon due to network issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/TS4215\n\nA: I was too lazy to use the primary user password (manufacturer set password to hard to remember) when I set up my iPad at the beginning, I just used the guest password with my iPad.  As a result of this, the airplay icon did not show up.  Also, you need to add your iPad to the Airport devices too.\n\nA: Home Sharing doesn't work with WPA2 security for some reason. If you look under system preferences/sharing/wifi options, you'll see what kind of security it's using. \n", "Q: iMac USB Ports Stopped Working I have an iMac, and because I program I prefer to use the extended USB keyboard.\nJust as the batteries to my wireless mouse died, my USB keyboard inexplicably stopped working.  I've been using this keyboard for months through previous mouse battery failures without incident.\nHere's what I've observed:\n\n\n*\n\n*The USB keyboard works fine when connected to my MacBook Pro.

Be careful not to break it though. Just a gentle squeeze, so that it's about 0.5-1mm tighter should be all that's needed.\nThis would explain why new keyboards work fine for a while and why extension cords only help for a while only as well.\n\nA: I have observed the exact same problem. However, when connecting the keyboard to the iMac via an extension cable, the keyboard works fine. I have experienced this consistently. Also, I had the keyboard changed because of this error; the new keyboard now (after some months) behave the same way.

The problem is that pictures taken with the iPhone 4 will not populate to the other 2 devices, and vice versa. \nThe only difference that I see is that the iPad and iPhone 5 are logged into the same iCloud account (mine), but the iPhone 4 is logged into my wife's iCloud account. \nCould this be the source of the problem?\n\nA: Yes. Photostream shares photos between devices logged into a single iCloud account. You can post photos to a Shared Photostream and designated parties will be notified, but the photos aren't downloaded to computers or iDevices. \n", "Q: Where does Apple Configurator store ipsw downloads? Every time Apple releases new iOS software, it's a bit of a rush to get things downloaded and the servers can be slow in delivering the bits.\nI would like to know where the Apple Configurator Version 1.2.1 (169) stores downloaded iOS software so I could transfer the files from iTunes or another computer so I can have several machines grab one each of the builds and then distribute them to avoid having each machine have to re-download all images each time.\nCan I move IPSW in to or out of Apple Configurator rather than having it control the downloads from Apple for iOS software?\n\nA: I've figured out how to point Apple Configurator at the IPSW that iTunes has downloaded as follows:\n\nThen use the dialog with Other... to add each and every IPSW that you've already downloaded. Since ~Library is normally hidden, you may need the go to shortcut to type command-shift-G and then ~/Library/iTunes to get to the filesystem location where iTunes has downloaded current IPSW files.\n\nBy adding multiple iOS versions, you can point the configurator at already downloaded IPSW and avoid the wait / duplication of Configurator re-downloading the same file and storing it away in some obfuscated database file at ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.configurator/Data/Library/Application Support/com.apple.configurator/Resources\nI haven't found a way to remove IPSW from Apple Configurator, but knowing I can keep them where iTunes prefers is workable for my case when I'd rather not wait for a long download and/or a duplicate set of IPSW on a particular Mac.\n\nA: I am using version 1.3.1 (274) of Apple configurator, the following worked for me:\nApple Configurator: Managing iOS device software had the correct location for the IPSW files in my situation.\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.configurator/Data/Library/Caches/com.apple.configurator/Firmware/\n\nI had to create the Firmware folder as it didn't exist yet but it I was able to successfully copy the required IPSW file to this location and deploy it to an iPhone without AC going to the internet to download it again.\n\nA: Since Apple Configurator 2.0 they are downloaded in:\n~/Library/Group Containers/K36BKF7T3D.group.com.apple.configurator/Library/Caches/Downloads/ACUDownloadFileOperation/\n\nand stored in:\n~/Library/Group Containers/K36BKF7T3D.group.com.apple.configurator/Library/Caches/Firmware\n\n\nA: As far as I know, the IPSWs are stored under ~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.configurator/IPSWs .\nThe IPSWs, stored per device's model and iOS version, are automatically downloaded here when you perform a restore using the Apple Configurator.\nSo, copying, the newest IPSW into this directory should do the trick.\n\nA: Apple Configurator Version 1.5 (424):\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.configurator/Data/Library/Caches/com.apple.configurator/Firmware\n\nI copied the manually downloaded files to the location above. Apple Configurator used those files to update my devices. You may want to note, Configurator still requires an internet connection to run. I suggest submitting a feature request to support updating devices while offline.\n\nA: Apple Configurator Version 1.7.1 (550) checks ~/Library/iTunes/iPad Software Updates for iPad _Restore.ipsw files.\nPlacing files in the appropriate directory \n~/Library/iTunes/<some iOS device>\n\nIt is easy to remember and it makes sense for Configurator to be looking here in case an iOS device has been restored or updated using iTunes.\n", "Q: Updating to iOS 6.1 disables cellular FaceTime? FaceTime over AT&T's 4G (you know, 3G) on my iPhone 4s (with a 2GB data plan) was enabled as of a few days ago. Haven't checked the settings since then, but I just updated to iOS 6.1 from 6.0.1, and after a message came up about saying that the iPhone was now using the new iCloud email address for iMessages, I decided to check on FaceTime, and it appears that the cellular data option for FaceTime is switched off again (and I can't enable it, just shows the 'call AT&T' popup). I don't really know for sure if I can blame iOS 6.1 because as its been a few days since I checked the setting it could be coincidence.\nWhat do you think? A glitch in AT&T's system that accidentally temporarily enabled my 4G FaceTime? Something about the update turning it off? When I asked AT&T, they were surprised that it was even working at all a few days ago.\n\nA: It isn't exactly iOS 6.1 and it sounds like AT&T at it again. I updated my iPhone 4S to iOS 6.1 yesterday as well and my Facetime over Cellular is still enabled. I am on a shared data plan, though, which has always - since iOS 6.0 - had the option to Facetime over Cellular. \nI think AT&T's response when you asked them shows who is ultimately at fault here. Even though 6.1 isn't exactly at fault, it is possible that AT&T hasn't fully opened the possibility to Facetime over cellular to users with data packages like yours, and that upgrading to iOS 6 somehow re-instated that until AT&T does better opening it up. \n\nA: According to AT&T, before they officially began turning them on, some devices accidentally were switched on and then they turned them off, and that the actual rollout will be over a few months.\n", "Q: Splicing lighnting connector in place of 30pin to achieve video I currently have a car headunit that uses a combnation of USB (audio and control) and 3.5mm jack (video) that was designed for iphone 4/4s.\nI now have an iphone 5. which i can't use the current cable with removing my ability to deisplay video. audio and controls still function fine.\nMy question is. I if i cut off the current 30pin connector off and spliced a lightning connector onto existing cable in its place. Will this cable function properly. Would it be as easy as, colour matching the two cables or is there a lot more to it. Could it be done with correct pin-outs?\n\nA: No, it will not function properly. The Lightning connector is quite complicated and dynamically \"rewires\" the cables, so you can plug it in in either orientation and it still works. This makes it practically impossible to do a DIY rewiring.\nYou can get a Lightning to 30 pin adapter to use your iPhone in the car instead.\n\nA: The Lightning connector dropped support for analog video output as well as iPod out. It won't output video to your car, even if you get an authentic Lightning to 30-pin adapter.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 2007 crashes I have a MacBook Pro 2007 with 4GB of RAM 320GB. I bought this MacBook off eBay over the summer. It came with Leopard, 2 months later then I upgrade to Snow Leopard, then to Mountain Lion. I currently have Mountain Lion 10.8.2.\nThe screen kind of flickers and I don't know if it's the graphics card or it's just the screen. But one day I was using my computer and all of sudden it just turns gray and the screen starts flickering and it just kept going. I don't think it's the screen because this flickering shuts down my computer and kernel panics come up.\nWhen you restart the computer, the Apple logo that comes up looks like it has spots on it but doesn't boot. It stays and it freezes and restarts my computer. What to do?\n\nA: It very well may be the graphics card in your MacBook Pro. Apparently during the manufacturing process (of this generation) too much thermal paste was applied to the heatsink on the GPU, thus cooking it. If this is the case for you, Apple might replace it or reimburse you for repair, if they are still doing this. \nA few good links:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4132?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\nhttps://selfsolve.apple.com/agreementWarrantyDynamic.do\n\nA: Yes, the reason your laptop is crashing is because of extra thermal paste applied to it. Try to remove the thermal paste with the help of a dry cloth and reapply it again to see if helps in fixing the issue.\nYou can get more help from this guide: https://pcbuildinglab.com/too-much-thermal-paste/\nIf nothing changes, then try to reach Apple Customer Support Center, and hopefully they'll replace it\n", "Q: iTunes 11 Mini Player disappeared off screen I accidentally dragged the iTunes 11 Mini Player off screen (near the OS X menu bar) and it disappeared. Showing all windows on the screen didn't help, the player window is nowhere to be seen. Switching to the main iTunes Window works, but as soon as I switch to the Mini Player again, it's off screen again. How can I get it back?\n\nA: After a couple of minutes of trying, I got the window back. Since I couldn't find this solution on Google, I'm answering it here for other people if they run into the same issue.\nTo get the Mini Player window back if it's off screen, use the iTunes View > Show Up Next menu entry. In my case, it moved the Mini Player window to a location right beneath the OS X menu bar and displayed the Up Next list, allowing me to move the Mini Player to a location of my choice.\n", "Q: Which Exchange Email apps for iPhone 5 allow advanced font and layout controls?

What's the best, well integrated with the device, Exchange 2010 mail client?\n\nA: Try Mail+ for Outlook. It is similar to the native iOS experience. Though it currently doesn't offer all of the features you mentioned, I know there is a new update coming by the end of February which will have rich text editing and better reply experiences. Apple severely limits the ability to use push notifications, so don't expect too many iOS mail clients to provide.\n\nA: Altamail might be another solution to look at.\n", "Q: NetCut Alternative For Mac OS X Any NetCut like app available for Mac OS X?\nI wonder if there are available alternative out there to scan and cut all devices that in our LAN connection.\nThank you.\n\nA: JamWiFi is an open source project that allows you limit user sessions on your WiFi network.\n\nJamWiFi allows you to select one or more nearby wireless networks, thereupon presenting a list of clients which are currently active on the network(s).

I create some screen, then save it as a PNG file and want to see how it looks on the actual iPhone screen. So I need to transfer PNG versions of my designs to my iPhone as easy as possible, may be even without a cable connected. Both Mac and iPhone are in a local network with a wireless router. \nI need to do this routine constantly so I am looking for the most transparent and easy solution, like - Save a PNG to Mac -> Instantly and automatically send to the iPhone some way.\nWhat are your suggestions?\n\nA: I use an app called LiveView. You run the server on your Mac, and the app on you Phone. It creates an iPhone-sized area on your Mac's screen, and broadcasts whatever is inside it to your phone.\nI work in Illustrator when I'm doing this, but that doesn't matter. Here's the best system I've worked out:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a second window of whatever your working on (Photoshop and\nIllustrator both do this).\n\n*Zoom that window so that my artboard fits the window perfectly (in\nIllustrator this will be 100% or 50% depending on whether you're\ntesting on a retina device).\n\n*Position the LiveView window over the duplicate window (I toss this\nonto a second monitor, or tile the windows if you only have one\nmonitor).\n\n*Work in the original Window.\n\n\nYou may now zoom in and out of the window you are working on, all while enjoying a perfect streaming vision of what it looks like on your phone the whole time.\nOnce I need to take the app to the device to show people, I use a service called InVision (invisionapp.com) to create touchable prototypes.\n\nA: You could do this with PhotoStream, and create a watched folder with Automator so that new files saved in a certain folder would be added to iPhoto's PhotoStream.\nI've done something similar with a DropBox folder so that any new photos from my Android phone are automatically added to iPhoto, and I can see them from any device with PhotoStream.\n\nA: The easiest way to do this is actually use iPhone's built-in WiFi sync and sync photos with it. \nIf that doesn't fit your need, there are apps that can transfer photos to iPhone, just take a look on the AppStore.\nAnother way is to play with Apache and WebDav, and have apps like Documents from Readdle to download them for you. I remember ReaddleDocs had sync features, but I don't know if it's removed.\n\nA: I recommend using Cubby for transferring your photos over. It doesn't have an upload limit so as long as you don't exceed the 5GB storage limit, you don't have to purchase a better plan. One of the features of Cubby is the ability to DirectSync™. This allows you to transfer data over a local connection without ever going to the cloud. This doesn't even affect your Cubby storage limit.\nBasically you first install the app on your computer and iPhone. Then you point Cubby to a particular folder and save your work in there. It automatically creates revisions so you don't need to worry about having a different file name every time you save the document. Just save the document, and it is instantly uploaded, and viewable on your iPhone in the Cubby app. \nIf you use DirectSync™, that process will be slightly different but largely similar.\n", "Q: How can I use Terminal to copy all files of a certain type from a failing hard drive?

Of course the cable IS connected and iTunes correctly sees the iPhone.\nI've never tried tethering before on my macbook. I haven't tried other solutions.\n\nAny clues?\n\nA: Somewhere around late 2014 is got very reliable for me. I don't know if iOS changed, OS X changed or both, but before then I continued to have the problems you describe with Mountain Lion 10.8.4 and earlier. \nOf late, this has been quite solid and at worst, toggling the connection in network preferences on OS X fixes any connection issues with iOS hotspot being solid in general. \n\nBefore the fixes, the problem seems to be a timing issue.\nWhat I've found is that if the connection light doesn't show green, I want to disconnect the device and turn off tethering on iOS. After waiting 5 seconds or so, I turn on tethering again on iOS and be sure to leave the tethering screen showing. (don't leave the settings app) I then reconnect the device and listen for it to signal that it's connected with the chirp iOS makes when connecting to a computer. If the light doesn't go green in system preferences, I toggle the Personal Hotspot off, count a few seconds and turn it on.\nOccasionally, something just isn't correct on the Mac end and I switch to Wi-Fi tethering and delete the interface in System Preferences and then start over with the set up.\nI wish I could say this worked reliably for me, but it seems to be fidgety and prone to errors and lock up.\n", "Q: Do all Macs come with iLife apps? I bought a Mac that is only a few months old. My understanding was that it is supposed to come with iLife (iPhoto, iMovie, and GarageBand) either preinstalled or available as a \"free\" download in the Mac App store. However, this doesn't seem to be the case as it is is not installed and the Mac App Store requires that I pay for it before downloading it. \nDo all Macs come with iLife? If so, what can I do to get it?\n\nA: Ignoring older Macs that used to ship with DVD media and a physical disc with iLife, there is a redemption process where you associate an Apple ID with the bundled iLife apps.\nAdditionally, both new and refurbished Mac purchased from Apple or an Authorized Reseller will have iPhoto, iMovie and GarageBand pre-installed, with no need to download anything other than updates to those pre-installed apps.\n\nSince you are not seeing those Apps for redemption / re-download in the Mac App Store, let's speculate on what might have happened. If your Mac was purchased used, it's possible that the seller wiped the Mac and reinstalled OS X. This is common practice to ensure a clean system for the new user and to remove any of the seller's personal data. However, iLife is a separate install from OS X, so if the seller neglected to re-install iLife, that's why you're not seeing it.\nIf you did indeed purchase it used, your best recourse is to bring the issue up with the seller. If it was new or refurbished, contact Apple and they should give you a code to download iLife. They might also be able to help to tell you whether the serial number of the Mac you now own has already redeemed those apps or help you to redeem the license for those apps if they actually transferred to you with the purchase of the Mac.\nYou can start here for a link to Apple Support in whatever country you live and/or whatever country the Mac was purchased.\nhttp://www.apple.com/support/country/\n\nA: When I bought a refurb MacBook Pro online last year, it was missing some of iLife. A call to Apple Support directed me to a (private?) download, and discs were sent. \n\nA: Any iMac or Macbook Air/Pro purchased directly from Apple - regardless of student discounts or being refurbished - is shipped with iLife pre installed. \nhttp://www.apple.com/ilife/\n\nSince Apple first introduced Lion and stopped shipping install DVDs for OSX and iLife I have purchased two Macs as a second user.\nIn both cases the iLife applications were registered to the previous owner and the Apple Care support wrote me in an email that they cannot transfer the iLife 'purchase' to me as the new owner.\nSince I've failed twice to get 'Apple' to transfer the license (leaving the previous owner with two licenses on his new Mac...) I assume that this is Apple's standard procedure. So, as iLife is only part of every new Mac.\nThis gets displayed to the original owner, but as a second owner, the absence of this screen means that another Apple ID has claimed iLife for that Mac.\n\n", "Q: Stop new iOS auto-download on iPad I noticed some weird traffic pattern on my internet connection, tracked it back to my iPad, after some tinkering I finally realized that my iPad is downloading iOS 6.1 on it's own!!! I didn't ask for it, and there's no button or obvious means to stop it. For now, I've disabled the WiFi; but seriously, this is terrible, how do I stop it?\nThe device: iPad 2 - running iOS 5.1 - No intention to upgrade anytime soon\n\nA: In short, you can't stop the download once the OS has been told to download it.\nFirst of all, I highly suggest you update to the latest iOS version because developers are constantly dropping support for older iOS. As for how to stop auto updates, after 45 minutes of searching, I think I found a solution. Doing this will also disable automatic downloads. \nHere is what you (or others in your situation) can do:\nNavigate to General > Store on your iPad. Next, turn on the switch that is labeled \"Use cellular data\". That will help most, but in your case, you mentioned turning off WiFi - so if you are concerned about that bandwidth, you'll have to keep networking off until you get to a network where bandwidth or cost for traffic isn't an issue.\nThis doesn't actually stop the download permanently, but will tell the OS to not burn your data plan and wait to complete the download over WiFi. Now, your phone will retain that downloaded OS image until such time as you erase the device and restore from a backup (where the download is not backed up and will be lost) or apply the update.\n\nA: I just discover on how to cancel updates for iOS 7.0.3.\nFirst, you have to switch on Airplane mode. While airplane mode is turned on you may reset your device. After resetting you will be prompted to restore your device from a recent backup, but the catch is you really don't have to restore it - all you need to do is to set up as new iPad.\nThis effectively cancelled the software update by starting over by having the device erase all content and settings.\n", "Q: If you temporarily unsubscribe from iTunes Match, will your track list be deleted? What happens if you (temporarily) unsubscribe from iTunes Match? Will your library (i.e. the list of all your tracks that Apple stores on their servers) be deleted, or will it only be disabled until you renew your subscription?\n\nA: I can't find any description in writing saying that there is any grace period for you to access playlists or any other data after you end a subscription period in iTunes Match.\nI do recall a warning when signing up for Match that quite explicitly said that I needed to be sure to download all playlists and music from the cloud before my subscription ended. This is in addition to the caution to keep a backup copy of all data (which in the case of playlists would be using iTunes to export the library to an XML file regularly in addition to backing up each track).\nApple could be more generous about keeping non-subscriber data around for a grace period of a day or a week or a month, but why risk this when you can back up everything now and then update that backup with anything that changes a week before your subscription ends?\n\nA: If your subscription expires, there is a grace period of 90 days before your library will be deleted from iCloud. There will be a message on your Account Info page telling you that iTunes Match has expired and all your stuff on the cloud will be removed in 90 days.\nHow I Know This: My subscription just expired because I forgot to update my payment information. When I entered my new credit card to renew, my whole library was still there. Whew!\n", "Q: Mac App Store thinks I don't have any apps installed Okay, I have the weirdest problem. All the apps in my 'Purchases' tab show either 'Install' or 'Download', most of the apps I currently have installed, but non the less it doesn't recognise them. This holds true for brand new apps (installed yesterday) and ones I've had since I installed ML. I'd really like to get the apps recognised, so that I can get updates for them.\nI've scoured the internet far and wide and haven't even been able to find any similar problems.\nI really wish someone has an answer :)\nUpdate:\nDeleting and reinstalling an app has no effect. It shows installed at first, but switching tabs and coming back to 'Purchases' renders it back to 'Install'.\nUpdate:\n`CKSoftwareMap: updateRequestBodyData:includeInstalledApps:includeBundledApps:conditionally:hadUnadoptedApps:waitUntilMapIsLoaded: timed out waiting for mdSemaphore``\nThis is the \"culprit\" from Console.app and seems to be dependent on Spotlight indexes.

Turns out I also had a Windows disk installed that I needed some files from.  I kept seeing errors in system.log like \"Error getting quotas for volume /Volumes/...\".\nI powered off, disconnected the Windows disk, and rebooted.  Voila!  App Store can now search for updates and identifies installed purchases under the \"Purchases\" tab.\nI hope I can save someone time, this problem has been plaguing me for a few days now.\n", "Q: How to know which directory contains the file that I'm editing in TextEdit? Very basic question - I am editing a file using the basic system TextEdit app.  As I actually have the file in question in several locations, how can I tell what directory the one that I am editing is actually residing in.\nIn Linux and Windows I can find this out easily but this does not seem obvious on my Mac.\nThis is using the basic TextEdit on my Mac and my Mac is OSX Lion 10.7.5\n\nA: Hold down the Command or Ctrl key and click on the icon or file name in the center of the title bar of text edit's document window. \n\nBe sure to click on the title itself. The containing directory structure will be shown in reverse-hierarchical order.\n\nA: They're called Folder Proxies, and do amazing little things. \nHold down the Option key on a Proxy, it turns dark and become dragable, to movie, copy, make an alias.\nRelated: In Safari, holding down Command on the title reveals the path up the site.\nI'm sure there's more ...\n\nA: Thanks, Zo219! I had no idea! Your \"do amazing things\" led me to experiment.\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl+Click on the filename in the title bar, or secondary click. That opens the list of \"Folder Proxies\" (a new term for me).\n\n*Option+Click on the folder name, right under the filename. That opens up a Finder window with the current file selected.\n\nIf Finder > View > Show Pathbar has been selected, the bottom of the Finder window will show the path to the file. Rightclick on the filename at the far right end and select Copy '<filename>' as path to put the full path to the current file into the clipboard.\nFor my purposes, being able to copy the path is often far more useful than just being able to look at it.\nThanks!\n", "Q: Changing iCloud accounts in order to sync Photostream pictures I have three iOS devices that I would like to have Photostream sync across. Right now, the iPhone 5 and iPad 2 sync because they are on the same iCloud account, but my wife's iPhone 4 doesn't sync - because it signed into a different iCloud account. I'm told all 3 iCloud accounts need to be signed into the same account. \nI need to change my wife's iCloud Apple ID on her iPhone 4 to mine. When I go to Settings, iCloud, Account, her Apple ID is grayed-out, so I can't make changes.  \nHow can I change the iCloud account on the iPhone 4?\n\nA: Go to Settings.app > iCloud and Tap \"Delete Account\". When you do this it will give the option to keep iCloud contacts and calendars on your device. You will probably want to keep them on the iPhone. After deleting the account (this really only signs out of that iCloud account) sign back into your iCloud account.\nFrom: this thread.\nKeep in mind that the backups from her phone (if enabled) will now impact your storage amount.\n", "Q: How can I switch applications on iPhone or iPad by keyboard like \"Windows key + tab\" on Windows?

You can buy a single use licenses or get a discount if you buy multiple licenses, but the software is free to try and works for 10 minutes to be sure it does what you need.\nThere are free receiver software for Linux, Windows, Mac, iOS, Android as well as buit in support for AirPort express, Apple TV, and Boxee.\n\nA: The latest XMBC version (XMBC 12) includes an AirPlay client on all platforms (OS X, Windows, Linux). Install and start XMBC on all clients (slaves) and then select them as AirPlay targets inside iTunes.\nPotential drawback is that the XMBC application is rather heavy-weight. But it's free so give it a try.\n\nA: +1 for Airfoil. \nYou can only stream from iTunes itself to AirPlay devices, so that's Apple TVs, AirPort Expresses, and others, but not to computers. You can use XMBC, as the other answer says, but it's a hassle; Airfoil is easy to use. It also streams to iOS devices.\n", "Q: Fluctuating voltage on Magsafe charger I got two Apple Magsafe charges, one for which I needed to cut and rejoint the cables. The fix went well and now when I plug in the charger it works and charges my Macbook Pro.\nThough when I measured the voltage with a multimeter on I get some strange values, and they are also differing from the fixed and untouched charger (do not know if they differed before the repare). When measuring I plugin the charger to the AC output and measure with the multimeter pins on the corresponding pins on the plug. There is o load and I can not reach the pins to measure when the plug is connected, thus I cannot make any Ampere-tests.\nThe voltage should be 16.5 V but I could understand if the charger has some functionality that basically turns it off when there is no load at all, thus the values on the untouched charger. But how come the values on the fixed one?\nUntouched:\nFluctuating voltage of 0-0.5 V\nFixed:\nFluctuating voltage of 0-7 V\nWhat does this mean and should I not continue to use the fixed charger even if it works?\n\nA: MagSafe chargers can output variable voltage.  When disconnected from a computer, they output a very low voltage.  When connected, the computer requests the voltage it needs, using the center data pin.  Your voltmeter is acting as a resistor in this circuit, which may be fooling the charger into thinking a computer is attached.  \nAccording to this link, the original MagSafe uses 6V when disconnected, and MagSafe2 uses 3V.  So I can't explain your 0-0.5V fluctuation, except that maybe you're not making a good connection with the test leads.\nhttp://www.righto.com/2013/06/teardown-and-exploration-of-magsafe.html?m=1\n", "Q: How to find devices on my local network through their IP address I have a local network powered by a Time Capsule, and connected to 4 or 5 macs. There are other devices on the network too. (Printers, IP Cameras, etc). Is there a way to list the devices on the local network - and their IP addresses?\nI've seen this Q/A How do I know the IP addresses of other computers in my network?\nbut the responses do not show what is what - just a list of IP addresses.\n\nA: If you have Android or iOS devices running on the same network, you can install a FREE app called Fing and list all devices connected and their MAC addresses and IPs.\n\nA: You can view this in Finder: in the Sidebar, there is a collapsable group called SHARED (if you don't see it, Finder > Preferences > Sidebar > SHARED , and ensure that Bonjour Computers is checked, but it's probably helpful to check all of them).\nTo view all detactable network devices, select All….\nTo get a device's IP address, select it and Get Info (ctrl+click > Get Info or cmd+i). Alternatively to find a specific device's IP via Terminal, run nslookup $hostname, replacing $hostname with the device's name listed in Finder: ex nslookup foo.yournetwork.com.\nBeyond that, you'd have to log into the router to see what devices are connected (its admin GUI will/should display the device's name next to the IP address it assigned to it).\n\nA: There are different way to locate devices on your network :\nNetbios traffic / ARP traffic / bonjour traffic / ICMP probes...\nNow the most reliable would be to use a good tool such as nmap which is able to perform multiple probes to discover nodes on your network.\nYou can download nmap for Mac OS here (This isn't the latest version, but it is easier to install this way) :\nhttp://nmap.org/dist/nmap-6.46.dmg\nYou can then run this script, or paste line after line in the terminal.\nAdd -sV in the sudo nmap command if you want it to be more reliable (but also slower)\n#!/bin/bash\n$i=en1\ncidr=$(while read y; do echo ${y%.*}\".0/$(m=0; while read -n 1 x && [ $x = f ]; do m=$[m+4]; done < <(ifconfig $i | awk '/mask/             {$4=substr($4,3); print $4}'); echo $m )\"; done < <(ifconfig $i | awk '/inet[ ]/{print $2}'))\nmyip=`ifconfig $i | grep \"inet \" | awk 'NR==1 {print $2}'`\necho \"sudo nmap -n -T4 -PN --exclude $myip $cidr\"\nsudo nmap -n -T4 -PN --exclude \"$myip\" \"$cidr\"\n\n\nA: I bought this software.

How do I find out if Find My iDevice is enabled on it? Someone just broke into my apartment today and stole my new MacBook Pro. When I go to icloud.com and click on Find my iPhone, on the Devices section, my MacBook is listed. When I click on it, it attempts to find it and says its offline. I don't know how to proceed. There's a good chance that it was stolen by a kid who lives within a 5 mile radius (from details I can't share). \n\n\n*\n\n*How can I be sure that Find my iDevice was enabled on my MacBook? (I can't remember for the life of me if I had enabled or disabled it)\n\n*Maybe I'm just being naively hopeful but is there a way to not wipe out the drive and still prevent access?  It's not likely to have been stolen by a security expert, to say the least. (wider neighborhood kid is what it looks like)\n\n*I've checked 'Notify when found' on the icloud.com/find page for my device. Does this mean I'll get an email? Do I have to be on icloud.find 24/7 to get a notification and the last location?\n\nA: *\n\n*If you can see your MacBook Pro with Retina Display in iCloud, it has been enabled. The reason it is showing as offline is because it is either (1) shut down and not connected to internet, or (2) the device has, somehow, already been wiped, with the first option being much more likely in this situation. Computers are particularly vulnerable to this type of situation because they don't have a constant data connection like an iPhone, or data-enabled iPad, often would. The user must boot the laptop and connect to a wifi before Find My Mac will know anything about it's where-abouts or be able to perform any actions.\nThe first, and main thing to do is to select the the \"Lock\", or \"Erase\" option. If it is a neighborhood kid and you think some noise might provide truth, you could always do the play sound feature. This plays an alert at maximum volume. You should probably use this sparingly, and only activate it, for example, if you are within earshot of it. Chances are the user could take quick actions to dampen the sound. \nAs for the \"Lock\", or \"Erase\" option, it will do this as soon as the computer is connected to the internet. Obviously, if they never connect the computer to the internet before wiping it, then the Lock feature won't do any good, but at least if they do, it will help you.\n\n*Good news for you is you can erase your Mac and still be able to locate it with Find my Mac.

You do not have to go through the App store, but it requires a free Developer account. \n1) Log into the Mac Developer Center\n2) Scroll down to the \"Xcode 4.6\" section.\n3) On the right there is a button to download Xcode 4.\n4) Open the DMG.\n5) Drag the old Xcode from the Applications folder to the Trash.\n6) Drag the new Xcode from the mounted volume to the Applications folder.\n\nThis time it will download a DMG file instead of a link to the Mac App Store.\nEither way you will have to download reinstall any extras from within Xcode itself. See the Preferences -> Downloads tab to finish the install.\n\nA: Since Xcode is now looking a lot more like a sandboxed app that gets downloaded to /Applications and sits there forever, it's probably just a download issue where the App Store is not smart enough to know if the application is running or quit, so you might need to reboot and be sure Xcode doesn't launch at log in time.\nYou could help things by moving Xcode to the trash before the reboot - but this shouldn't be much different than troubleshooting any other App Store download.\nhttp://www.apple.com/support/mac/app-store/troubleshooting/\nUnless you get a definite error message, it might be an overload issue on the server side as well and something you just might need to keep hammering away at until you get an actual error message from the App Store app.\n\nA: I was experiencing the same problem recently. I solved it by killing the iTunesHelper process, quitting all other apps, and waiting for it to finish the installation. It took a while to complete (~5-10 min).\n\nA: I have experienced something similar by changing internet connections during a download, but I don't think that's the case here. So best thing to do is:\nFirst try to repair disk permissions using \"Disk Utility\". If it didn't work, then delete the XCode and install it again rather than updating it.\n", "Q: Limit the use of my Apple ID on my kid's iPod Touch I've had an iPod Touch (4G) for a couple years. Now I have an iPhone 5, so I want to remove all \"my\" apps/profile info from my iPod Touch and set it up for my children to use.\nRight now, both devices use my apple ID, and share some (but not all) applications (mostly free ones). But that means, for instance, when I get an iOS message, it is going to both devices, which I don't want. Both devices sync to my laptop. I have music that I'd like to be able to keep on both devices.\nWhat's the best set-up? Is my best scenario to create a new Apple ID for my kids' use, and reset my old iPod Touch and start over with the new ID? (is there any way to keep the set-up, like if I back-up and then restore? Or should I continue using the same ID for both devices? I'm worried about getting apps/profile info mixed up and accidentally downloading ones I don't want the kids to have to the iPod (e.g., I don't want them to be able to send messages to my contact list, which is mostly business!).\n\nA: Since you do not want your children to have access to your Address Book (that syncs using iCloud), you should use a new Apple ID. This means you have to turn off and change the current iCloud settings in the iPod Touch. \nSince you want to keep the apps you already installed (using your iCloud), you shouldn't  restore the iPod Touch to its original (factory) state as that will delete those apps. \nI'll recommend backing up (whether via iCloud or to your Mac) using iTunes just in case you want to use the iPod Touch again in the future.\n\nA: This all depends on where you want to go with the Apple IDs after this. Even if you want the kids to all have their own Apple IDs in the future, because it is just one device, it probably is a good idea to just stick with one Apple ID.\nIn this case, I would recommend using your Apple ID for purchasing content. This way, any time apps are purchased, they stay with your account, instead of having a third account to try to remember for buying apps and such - after the kids get their own devices and Apple IDs. Parental Restrictions on iOS devices have a nice amount of control over disabling features and other things such as setting age limits on purchasing content, or disabling the App and iTunes stores altogether.\nTo remove your personal information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings.app and scroll and tap on Mail, Contacts, Calendars.\n\n*Delete any of your mail accounts (if applicable) that you don't want your kids to access including the first one - \"iCloud\".\n\n*\n\n*When you do get to iCloud, scroll down to the bottom on that one and tap delete. Don't worry, it's only removing the account and information from your device - not the account itself. \n\n\n*Go back to the main Settings.app menu and scroll down to Messages. Scroll to \"Send & Receive at\". Tap the Apple ID at the top and Sign Out\".\n\n*Go to \"Facetime\" and make sure you are signed out of your Apple ID.\n\n*To make sure your old iPod doesn't download any new content that you download onto your new iPod, go to Settings.app > iTunes & App Stores and disable \"Automatic Downloads\".\n\n*\n\n*After this go to Parental Restrictions and see if there is an option to disable changing that Automatic Download setting (I'm not sure on that one).\n\n*The for sure method, in addition to disabling Automatic Downloads is to disable iBooks, iTunes, and App store. The device will not download content when these stores are disabled.\n\n\n\nNow, after that you could set up an Apple ID for Facetime, Messages, and iCloud, if you wanted. You would then use that to just log in those places and not the app store.\n\nA: You can assign your Apple ID to the App Store to share purchases and music but create a new ID to be used for iMessage, device backup, etc. on the second device. \nApple Knowledgebase: Using your Apple ID for Apple services\n", "Q: How to access/edit iPhone Contacts on computer? I run Windows 7 (no Outlook available) and don't seem to find any native Address Book application on my computer (it is a work-provided laptop). We use Lotus Notes as our mail application. Because my phone is also used for work, I can't use any iCloud services (security restrictions)\nI would like to be able to easily see and edit/manage my contacts on my computer and sync them to/from my iPhone (two-way sync), as I mostly am looking up #s and addresses while at my desk, and don't want to have to manually maintain it all twice, or log onto my phone every time I need an address, and then have to manually type it on my computer.

A few users from a website I've designed are complaining about Safari 6.0.2 on their Macs (Mountain Lion, mostly) crashing unexpectedly. In a recent case, a user recorded this screencast using no browser extensions, nor any other tabs: it took only a few seconds for Safari to crash (here's the crash report). A quick Google search will reveal loads of similar cases, but none of them seems to provide enough information on the issue, or any potential solution at all. Any idea on what's causing this or how to avoid it? My intention is to prevent Safari 6.0.2 from crashing, as soon as possible.\n\nA: Open the Terminal app (found in /Applications/Utilties/).\nCopy the following as one line (from “curl” through “.pkg”) and paste it into the Terminal window after the “$ ” prompt:\ncurl -O http://swcdn.apple.com/content/downloads/37/23/041-5058/lr5tynbldi18zcrqo8a8uq88 rnjushqliu/Safari6Lion.pkg\n\nthen hit return.\nYou should see it count down the time. When it stops, look in your home folder (the one with the little house and your user name) for “Safari6Lion.pkg”. Double-click to launch the installer.\nHere is an alternative solution that seems to be working for several users, especially those who have somehow managed to install more than one WebKit framework:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder and navigate to:\n/System/Library/StagedFrameworks/Safari/ Drag WebKit.framework to\nthe trash\n\n*Run software update and install Safari > do not launch safari after\n    it is installed\n\n*Restart computer\n\n*Launch Safari\nLet's try! \n\nA: Removing CSS3 blur filters seemed to fix the issue.

I have an iPhone 5 with iOS 6. This is what happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*Audio playing in the background OR paused audio playback\n\n*Timer goes off with alarm sound\n\n*Dismiss alarm with Earpods center button\n\n*Playback resumes\n\n\nI would have thought that after dismissing an alarm sound the phone would go back to whatever state it was in before the alarm, but that doesn't happen in the case of paused playback. This behavior is confusing and seems inconsistent.\nIs there a way to turn of the Timer alarm using just Earpods, and without having music playback start?\n\nA: What I do to stop alarm sound is to call Siri twice. First time to stop the alarm itself, second time to stop Siri from listening. This can be done with a very short interval. For reassurance, you can tap thrice each time (in case you tend to miss one of 2 taps required for the command to be registered by AirPods). \nP.S. I know the question is about EarPods, but it's quite similar to what some people experience with AirPods.

You can, in a way, download Photostream images, if they sync over correctly, however, Photostream has a 1000 image limit, and it doesn't do well with syncing past photos taken. Instead, Photostream is more built for when you take a photo on your iPhone, or something, then it will sync that photo to all your devices, vs. syncing all previous photos.\nEither way, iPhoto manages Photostream as well.

As far as I have determined so far, it is only applications which use the Sparkle updater system.\nThe error simply says:\n\n30/01/13 10:28:52.411 AM Choosy[6375]: Sparkle Error: An error occurred in retrieving update information.

Or should I take this up with the folks who make Sparkle?\n\nA: Permissions would be my last thing to check, since if they were off, the app wouldn't even run - but it's also an easy thing to rule out. Be aware that Apple's permission repair does not affect user directories (where permission errors actually tend to hurt people) or third party software (since Disk Utility only corrects permissions on software Apple installed with the OS and updates).\nThis seems much more likely to be an issue with the app communicating back to the server the developer of the app has set up to serve updates. I'd start with the support for the app in question and see if you can verify the update server is alive and reachable from your network.\nThere were some update bugs a while back, but most of them seem to be squashed in the more recent versions of sparkle that developers can download.\nhttps://github.com/andymatuschak/Sparkle/issues?state=open\n", "Q: Multithreaded Video Converter on Mac?

I can interchange 1x 667mhz DIMM with 1x800mhz DIMM but a single 800mhz DIMM or two 800mhz DIMMs result in a failure to boot.\nMy hunch was that the motherboard thinks it can run at 800mhz so doesn't downclock it to 667mhz unless there is a slow DIMM in one of the slots forcing it to.\nI did some research, and discovered the timing information is set in the SPD data stored on an EEPROM on the DIMM. I booted an Ubuntu 16.10 liveUSB on the iMac, apt-get installed i2c-tools, modprobeed the i2c-i801 module to enable the SMBus (which talks to the DIMM EEPROM) and read out the SPD of a working and a too-fast DIMM with i2cget. After a lot more research, I merged the timing information from the working DIMM in to the SPD of the too-fast (but larger) DIMM. decode-dimms can calculate the correct CRC. I then wrote the modified data back to the fast DIMM with i2cset.\nI can now pair that down-clocked DIMM with an unmodified 800mhz DIMM, and the system correctly downclocks  the memory bus to 667mhz and boots.\nFULL DISCLOSURE: After about a month the upgraded machine started hard-crashing and was replaced by a 2017 iMac ;)\n", "Q: Is is possible to move a Verizon iPhone 4s to another US cellular carrier?

And why if not?\nAssuming the devices has been legitimately unlocked via the procedures mentioned in  Verizon iPhone 4S SIM UNLOCK Tutorial?\n\nVerizon has confirmed (here and here) they WILL unlock the SIM on the iPhone 4S, allowing for use of local SIM cards while traveling abroad (no word yet on whether this will allow for use on AT&T and T-Mobile.) This is different than the jailbreak unlocking method; SIM unlocking through Verizon is permanent and will not affect your warranty in any way.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Meet the following requirements:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Must be a Verizon Wireless customer.\n  \n*The iPhone 4S being unlocked must be active on a Verizon Wireless line of service.\n  \n*The line of service must be active at least 60 days.\n  \n*The line of service must be in good standing for the past 60 days.\n  \n*Only one SIM Unlock per line every 10 months.\n  \n  \n  \n  If you don't meet one or more of the above requirements, call anyway. You may still get lucky.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Insert a foreign SIM into the SIM card slot on the side of your phone (only required to confirm that the unlock is successful.)\n  \n*Call 1-800-711-8300 (Verizon Global Support) and ask the representative for a SIM unlock. Occassionally a representative may not know exactly what you are referring to; make sure you are not transferred to a different department. You are in the right place. Explain that they should have a walkthrough on how to do this, and that it allows for the use of local, non-Verizon SIM cards while traveling abroad.\n  \n*Get confirmation from the rep that the unlock has been applied to your account, then check your phone to make sure it recognizes your SIM and can connect (if successful it will roam on AT&T, assuming you are calling from the USA.) You will NOT see an unlock confirmation in iTunes as that is for a factory-applied unlock only.\n  \n*Enjoy your new unlocked iPhone 4S!\n\nHowever it seems that this unlock mentioned above is only for Internationale SIM cards for use outside of the US. Can this be done in the US, really looking for other carrier options with my existing phone.\n\nA: I think I found the Answer I was looking for in How U.S. Carriers Fool You Into Thinking Your iPhone 4S Is Unlocked\nShort answer \"You can't do it!\" If your phone is CDMA, its permanently locked to its CDMA network of origin.\n\nUnlocking your Iphone 4S\nAmong the three major carriers operating in the U.S., only one, AT&T, will not unlock any iPhone. Because I purchased a Verizon-designated handset, the following information relates to those customers that purchase Verizon iPhones, but the technology and result is the same for any carrier.\nWhen I called Verizon tech support to unlock my phone prior to leaving the U.S., I was told that I had to have a foreign SIM card installed in order to complete the process and that the phone would have to log in to the Verizon network on WiFi. The reason for this procedure is that the phone must validate the foreign SIM.\n\n...\n\nSo I stopped in at an Apple store in London. We logged into a WiFi network, installed a micro-SIM card from a carrier in England, and within about thirty seconds, the phone was unlocked because Verizon had already unlocked the phone at their end before I left the U.S. For the rest of my travels overseas, it worked flawlessly and provided essentially the same options that are available on any other dual-mode or GSM-only device.\n\n...\n\nFour different iPhone 4S versions\nWhen I returned to the U.S., I wanted to confirm that my Verizon iPhone could be ported to another carrier, whether CDMA or GSM. This was the intent of Apple when they designed the 4S: every phone is the same and will work on virtually any carrier in the world.\nSo, I contacted a regional GSM carrier in the Midwest that has roaming agreements with AT&T and T-Mobile. The carrier was kind enough to provide a micro-SIM card for testing in my iPhone. What I found may infuriate customers who have purchased expensive iPhones from one of the three carriers in the U.S. but at some point decide to switch to another provider because of poor coverage, customer service, or pricing.\n\n...\n\nSitting in South Dakota, I replaced my Verizon SIM with the Longlines Wireless chip. The phone indicated that the SIM was not recognized by the phone and required its removal and device reboot. I contacted Verizon global support to confirm my suspicions. They advised that indeed their phones were locked as against any other carrier in the United States, and that the term “unlock” only applied to overseas carriers.\nI next inserted my UK SIM card into the phone, and it logged into AT&T without issue, which confirmed what Verizon told me. I then interviewed managers at three different Apple corporate stores to confirm issues with regard to unlocking.\nWhat consumers need to understand is that there are actually four different versions of the iPhone 4S: Verizon, Sprint, AT&T, and Apple. Only the Apple phone, available from their stores or on-line, is fully unlocked and can be used on any carrier outside the United States. The other phones are permanently locked and cannot ever be used on another carrier in the U.S. Even if you spend $800 for an unlocked phone as I did and dedicate it to a single U.S. carrier, you are locked into that carrier forever if you want to keep using the iPhone. Neither Apple or the other carriers will fully unlock your carrier phone.\n\n", "Q: Make meta + arrows count underscore as words?

I just switch the language once OSX  installation is complete (and before I run Migration Assistant).\n\nA: A few things you could try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run sudo languagesetup, select a new language, and restart.\n\n*Run sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist AppleLocale en_US and restart.\n\n*Run sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/Setup\\ Assistant.app/Contents/MacOS/Setup\\ Assistant, go through the steps of creating a new account, restart, and delete the account.\n\n", "Q: iPad mini offers update to iOS 6.0.2 that won't install An update to iOS 6.0.2 did not seem so important at the time and so it was never installed. Now that iOS 6.1 is out I'd expect that Software Update skips the update to iOS 6.0.2 and directly provides me with the ability to update from iOS 6.0.1 to iOS 6.1 instead.\nAnd yet, Software Update is stuck with the intention to update to iOS 6.0.2. In the hope that after iOS 6.0.2 was successfully installed Software Update  may offer to install iOS 6.1 next I accepted the update to iOS 6.0.2. \nHowever, the next thing is that Software Update claims that the installation of iOS 6.0.2 cannot be started because there is no connection to the Internet. I positively verified that the connection is possible; so the most likely explanation is that Software Update is not able to find the update to iOS 6.0.2 any longer and concludes that this is caused by a lack of connectivity.\nHow can I make Software Update ignore the pending update to iOS 6.0.2 and head for iOS 6.1 instead? \n\nA: Since things aren't working as expected, make a backup - perhaps two, one to iTunes and another to iCloud.\nConnect the device to iTunes and let iTunes download the entire 6.1 update rather than monkeying with a pair of delta patches that iOS downloads to save space on the device and save bandwidth and time to update.\n", "Q: Can timestamps be preserved when copying files on OS X? I'm interested in combining the files from three Macs by copying the files from each one into a single folder hierarchy of my design on an external hard drive.\nIn my past experience copying files in OSX, sometimes the files lose their Created and Modified timestamps; i.e. they are changed to the present moment when the file copy happens.\nHow can I make sure this doesn't happen? \n\nA: Use pax. The default pax format, called ustar, preserves file modification and access times (among other things like user ID, group ID, file mode bits and extended attributes like Spotlight comments and ACLs). See pax man page here for more details.\nFirst, create a pax archive on every Mac and copy it to the external hard drive like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Applications>Utilities>Terminal.\n\n*Type in Terminal:\n$ cd\n\nand drag the folder where the files to be combined reside on that Mac to Terminal:\n\nAlternatively you can type the full folder name:\n$ cd /path/to/your\\ folder\n\nThis will change the current folder to 'your folder'.\n\n*Archive the folder with pax:\n$ cd ..\n$ pax -w \"your folder\" > yourfolder.ustar\n\n\n*Use the Finder to copy the newly create archive yourfolder.ustar to the external hard drive.\nThen extract the archives with pax:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal on the Mac that has the external USB hard drive plugged in.\n\n*Change the current folder to the single folder hierarchy on the external hard drive with command cd as explained above:\n$ cd /Volumes/externalHDD/path/to/single \\folder\n$ ls\nyourfolder.ustar\nyourfolder2.ustar\nyourfolder3.ustar\n\n\n*Extract the archives:\n$ pax -r -p e < yourfolder.ustar\n$ pax -r -p e < yourfolder2.ustar\n$ pax -r -p e < yourfolder3.ustar\n$ ls\nyour folder\nyour folder 2\nyour folder 3\n\n\n*Move the files around with the Finder if you need to (the Finder preserves file modification and access times within the same volume).\n(I've tested this procedure on OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion).)\n\nA: I just ran across this myself, and the built in cp command actually handles it.\nI discovered a bunch of old CF cards that I wanted to harvest the pictures from. My processing scripts will look at the file mtime to put it in the correct place so I needed it preserved.\nFrom the man page:\n -p    Cause cp to preserve the following attributes of each source file in the copy: modification time,\n       access time, file flags, file mode, user ID, and group ID, as allowed by permissions.  Access\n       Control Lists (ACLs) and Extended Attributes (EAs), including resource forks, will also be pre-\n       served.\n\n       If the user ID and group ID cannot be preserved, no error message is displayed and the exit value\n       is not altered.\n\n       If the source file has its set-user-ID bit on and the user ID cannot be preserved, the set-user-\n       ID bit is not preserved in the copy's permissions.  If the source file has its set-group-ID bit\n       on and the group ID cannot be preserved, the set-group-ID bit is not preserved in the copy's per-\n       missions.  If the source file has both its set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits on, and either the\n       user ID or group ID cannot be preserved, neither the set-user-ID nor set-group-ID bits are pre-\n       served in the copy's permissions.\n\nSo, using zsh I was able to run (NO NAME being my cards volume name):\ncp -rvp /Volumes/NO\\ NAME/DCIM/**/*.{JPG,jpg} ~/Desktop/tmp/pics\n\nI believe that the special /**/* construct is specific to ZSH; however you could do something like \nfind /Volumes/WHATEVER -type d -print0 | xargs cp -vp {}/*.JPG /my/out/path\n\n\nA: I use rsync to do this sort of copy. However note the version supplied by Apple is 2.6.9 and has bugs on this. So you need to get a third party built one either build yourself or via a package manager\nfor example\nrsync -aEAX source_dir target_dir\n\nThe option -E copies the ACLs and -a preserves the unix permissions and times A copies the ACLs and X copies the xattributes (onm rsyn version 3. Version 2 does not have AX)\nrsync can also be setup to copy to remote machines without mounting drives.\nThere are some GUI front ends for rsync e.g. aRsync. For other directory synchronization tools see this question.\n\nA: Compress them with zip or select them with ctrl-click or right-click and choose Compress. Copy the compressed files to your target system and open them there.\nIf you can, format your external drive as a Mac OS filesystem, not FAT.\n\nA: I tried out what jaume suggested above (thanks jaume!), but for me (on my very old hardware) creating .ustar files was too time consuming and I ran out of patience...hours later.\nSo I read the examples here, and adapted an example like so:\npax -r -u -w [source directory] [destination directory]\n\nIn my case I changed directory with the 'cd' command and checked terminal could see my source directory 'User' with the 'ls' command before running:\npax -r -u -w User /Volumes/T7\n\nThe results were that all files maintained their original date modified/created - but directories had 'today' as their date modified date & original date for 'date created'.\nThis was good enough for me!\nP.S. I'm not sure if pax is built into Darwin as I installed TigerBrew before getting started but I did all of this on OS X 10.7.5.\n", "Q: How to batch convert word documents to pdf? Is there a scriptable way that I can convert several MS Word documents to PDF? I thought this might be possible using python, but I am unable to find any advice online on how best to do this.\n\nA: NOTE : the below instructions are for Macs running 10.4 or earlier, no longer works on 10.5 (Leopard), 10.6 (Snow Leopard), 10.7 (Lion), 10.8 (Mountain Lion).\nOpen Automator.\nCreate a new custom workflow. \nFrom the Actions panel library, select Files & Folders then double-click Get Specified Finder Items. \nAdd the items you wish to convert. \nNext, from the library, select Documents, then double click Convert Format of Word Documents. \nFrom the dropdown menu, select the format you wish to convert the files to.

I have recently restored few pictures from Time Machine into iPhoto. I noticed that the Time Machine restored the files, but didn't restore the changes (editing etc.) I had made.\nThe point is that I am planning to reinstall the whole system on my mac and than to restore files using Time Machine. I would also like to have my photos with my changes. Do you have any ideas?\n\nA: an complete TM restore restores your entire computer as the time when it was backed up.\nmy qualified guess is that when you restored your indevidual pictures, you restored the original file, and not the edited vertion, \ngive it another go, and make sure you choose your edited file if you want to be sure!\n\nA: Using Time Machine within iPhoto to restore an individual picture won't restore the edits. You're  restoring the master file, not the copy that incorporates the edits. \nIf you use Time Machine to restore the entire drive, the entire iPhoto Library is restored, edit copies and masters.\nWhile you can use Time Machine to restore a system drive, I find using a clone created with SuperDuper (or Carbon Copy Cloner) to be faster and more robust. \nIf your goal is to install a fresh copy of the operating system you can do so by installing Mountain Lion over the existing copy. It will leave your user files in place. (Make sure you have a good backup, or three, before you try this.)\nIf this is unsatisfactory, you can install the OS on a freshly formatted disk, then bring your user files over from a clone copy using Migration Assistant. See Apple Knowledgebase: How to use Migration Assistant to transfer files from another Mac\n", "Q: Does Find My Mac stop working after the system has been wiped? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIf Macbook has been wiped, will “find my iPhone” still work? \n\nI lost my Macbook Pro recently. I had activated iCloud on the computer, so Find My Mac is operable. \nIf the thief wipes the hard drive, and installs a fresh operating system, OSX Lion or Leopard, for example, then will I still be able to locate my device? In particular if the thief installs Leopard (which obviously doesn't support Find my Mac) will Find My Mac still work?\n\nA: If the thief just wipes the harddrive, there is a slight chance that your device will still show up in Find My Mac as the association is saved in the NVRAM which persists even after a drive format.\nHowever, if the thief or new owner clears the NVRAM in any way, or reconfigures iCloud with another account and enables Find My Mac for it, the association will be deleted or overwritten, and you will no longer be able to track your device.\nSee this question for more on the subject.\n\nA: Just made a fresh test (with MacOS 10.14.4) where Find my Mac was activated. During the entire installation process I was able to send signals to the machine from iCloud.com. But at first startup/log in all connections were lost... I don't know if this is how it's supposed to work, but this is the reality. :(\n\nA: The answer is no.  iCLoud will be deleted along with everything else. \nKeep iCloud open on your current computer to make sure you get each location the device is located at.\n", "Q: Backing up HDD to restore it on another SSD I want to switch out my current HDD for a SSD in my Mac. However I don't want to reinstall the OS and all my software. \nHow can I backup (image) the entire HDD to restore it later as image with Disk Utility on another SSD? Accordingly, if I have 50GB partition for my current system, will that partition size somehow sustain through the image to the new SSD and make the other space that would be available on a larger harddrive then unusable? If so, how can I avoid this behavior?\n\nA: Three ideas. First addresses your idea about Disk Utility. The next on the method I have used. The third is an idea to just do a switch of the disks & use an external enclosure.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use Disk Utility, but I’ve actually had better luck not\nusing it or any official Apple tools. With Disk Utility you would\nsimply make an image of your boot disk to another drive then boot up\nyour machine from some other device—a CD, DVD, USB, etc…—or even the\nrecovery partition. Once booted you go to Disk Utility & restore.\nBut like I said, I have had better luck with other methods.\n\n*I have done clones & migrations over the years using tools such as\nSuperDuper!\nor Carbon Copy Cloner. Just hook up an\nexternal drive with an empty partition as big—or bigger—than the\nsource, clone the disk as a bootable copy to the new disk. Install\nthe new drive in your machine, but then boot up from the copy you\njust made & clone it in reverse from the external drive to the\ninternal. Maybe Time Machine can do this, but I don’t use that for backups.\n\n*But I have a third solution I think would work well. Get an external\nenclosure for the drive you are going to remove, place the drive in\nthat enclosure, place the new drive in your machine, boot from the\nexternal drive & then clone it in reverse from the external drive to\nthe internal.\n\n\nThe last one has a slight risk since if you have no backup & you remove your internal drive & somehow damage it in the process, well… You have nothing. I recommend method 2 since it’s a tried & true way of imaging a machine. Works great!\n\nA: If you have a Time MAchine backup you can ask the installer on the install DVD to restore the backup directly on the new disk.\nIf you do not have a Time Machine backup, now would be a good time for doing so.  Use a decidated USB drive at least twice the size of your internal disk (or a Time Capsule), and let Time Machine backup your current system.  When done, you can change the disks, boot the installation media and restore the Time Machine files on the new disk.\nThis is what I would recommend, as it is the way Apple want you to do it.  I've done this a couple of times and it worked well for me.\n", "Q: Stop my Mac from downloading Apple TV content I have an Apple TV where I subscribe to Seasons for various shows and watch them on my TV.

Is there a setting in iTunes to make it stop?\n\nA: Make sure that you have \"download pre-orders when available\" disabled in your iTunes preferences by going to iTunes > Preferences under the Store tab. Then, untick If you have this selected in itunes you are telling itunes to download all new shows that you watch.

I'm looking for an application which can take a playlist of all of the track I'm listening to at the moment and re-arrange them so that they are in a logical sequence (based on BPM etc) then mix them all together as a mix.\nI've tried Tangerine  but I wasnt very impressed as it didnt have a way to automatically sort the tracks and the analysis of the music wasn't very good. (In fact, it often got things pretty wrong).\nCan anyone suggest DJ software with better sorting and analysis features?\n\nA: Megaseg\n\nShareware\nThe 'Pro' and 'DJ' versions of this program integrate very tightly with iTunes and an iTunes managed library if you have one. It can play DRM-protected purchased songs and can synchronize playlists, playlist folders, metadata, sound check adjustments and album art with iTunes. It can also match songs with similiar BPM for smooth transitions and can easily handle thousand-song playlists.  \nThe program is definitely designed for a production environment, rather than a live one. It cannot do automatic BPM calculation, but has a little feature where you can 'tap' out the BPM to a song with your mouse/keyboard. And of course you can sort your library or playlist by BPM, or a number of other metrics.\nI'm a huge fan of Megaseg, but it suffers from small little usability quirks (the program's insistence on sorting songs with each artist in alphabetical order for instance).\nMixxx\n\nFOSS\nThis program is gaining a lot of popularity lately. It features some iTunes integration but is quite usable without iTunes and has several integrated organizational devices to make custom playlists or bundles of related songs. \nThis program is more oriented for a live environment. It has the ability to connect to several USB MIDI controllers and turntables, has automatic BPM analysis, a more robust loop control, and the ability to handle multiple simultaneous sample playback.  \nMixxx has the ability to sort songs by BPM or other metrics of your choosing, though I have found it easier to use other programs to manage music libraries. Where AutoDJ and automatic crossfading are integral components of Megaseg, feel like more of an extra feature for Mixxx.\n\nA: Here's a process using the best features of each program.\nMegaSeg has a BPM tap, but is not automatic. \nTangerine automatically calculates the BPM (super fast).\nRun Tangerine, analyze the songs, then export BPM to iTunes. \nThen open MegaSeg and import tags (choose only BPM).\nYou can create a playlist in either iTunes or Tangerine, then switch to MegaSeg for the performance.\n", "Q: Stop flagged messages in inactive accounts from contributing to Flagged counter I have two accounts set up in Mail 6.2.

A loose cable, loose cable to LCD panel connection, bad inverter, failing backlight, power supply/voltage regulation issues inside the Mac all can cause what you observe as a symptom for brightness jumping and not working.\nIf you gently and slowly open and close the lid, most loose connections can be made better or worse.

Boot up from it. Now try sleeping. If it's ok, its most likely (99%) a software problem. It may also be your HDD, which is highly unlikely.\n\nA: After the panic, do two cold restarts in Safe Mode. (A cold restart is booting up from the system completely off. You can get into Safe Mode by holding down left shift key while powering up.) That is, hold down left shift key immediately after pressing the Power button. You may release the Shift key when you see the radial start to spin. Do this twice then boot into regular mode by booting normally. By doing this you will allow the system to check itself and repair any errors it finds, this also checks and repairs permissions. Restarting clears the memory and therefore any faults stored in memory. My experience tells me a panic is either the volume directories or bad memory (RAM).\n\nA: If KPs continue after safe boot, then most likely they're hardware related. Run the Apple Hardware Test suite, extended tests at least twice, followed by Rember.  See\nthis link https://discussions.apple.com/message/21725938#21725938\n\nA: Recently happened to me on my 2011 iMac.  Tried Safe Mode but kept rebooting.  Only thing that worked was CMD-R for Recovery and reinstalled Mavericks.  Smooth ever since.\n\nA: If you have installed any RAM on the machine, try removing it and using only the original Apple RAM modules. This has resolved better than 9 in 10 of the kernel panics I've had on Intel machines. If it does, get replacement RAM modules from your vendor.\n\nA: I have seen another fix-- a friend booted into recovery partition (cmd r at boot) and repair your disk from the disk utility there. He now has no problems whatsoever with his old mac.\n\nA: If you use Clover, probably could be the culprit due to wrong CPU definitions.\n", "Q: Lost apachectl bin file How can I recover the apachectl on my OSX?\nI deleted it, somehow, and now the command apachectl doesn't exist anymore.\n\nA: On 10.8 apachectl is a ~50 SLOC shell script. I uploaded the one from my installation here. For example apachectl start just runs (sudo) launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist, so you don't necessarily even need apachectl.\n\nA: If you build Apache httpd from the source code, you can get the apachectl binary from <apache_src_dir>/support/apachectl.\n", "Q: Restoring past purchases from different country I recently moved countries, and have purchases associated on my iTunes account.\nOnce I moved countries, I changed the country on my Apple ID to my new country.\nHowever, after using a store card on my account, I can't change my account back to my previous country and access my past purchases, because I still have store credit on my account, which I can't spend.\nI've contacted Apple about removing my store credit, but will I be able to access my past purchases once I actually change my country back?\nI've just reinstalled my Mac, and need to re-download iPhoto, iMovie and GarageBand.\nAny help appreciated.\n\nA: Apple contacted me back, I changed my country, and all my purchases have been restored.\n", "Q: Why can't I share my voice memo on my iPhone via e-mail? When I go to to share a memo created in the Voice Memo app via e-mail, the e-mail will get sent, but there will not be an attachment.  In the outbox before it gets sent, the attachment is there, but when I look in the sent folder afterward, there is no attachment.  What is causing this and how can I fix it?  The size of the voice memo does not matter, there will be no attachment. \nI am using ios 6.1, sending to a Gmail account. \n\nA: I had the same issue after an update and found that by clicking \"edit\" on the voice memo then \"done\" , it would attach all details in that vm so I could send. \nIt just added another step to what was a straight forward pro ss to begin with.\n\nA: I've not had a message fail, but theoretically, the recording might be too large to attach?\nHave you had any luck isolating the issue by trying to add a new mail account and send a quite short memo using that Mail account?\nIf you have another device, you might try signing into your gmail there and testing to be sure it's not just a problem on the iOS device and it needs to be restored from a fresh OS (or out of space on the filesystem). Since iOS is designed to not be like a computer and pop up all sorts of error messages, sometimes when an error condition has arisen, it's not obvious why things don't work. In fact, you might just need to power down the phone and let it reboot if it's a temporary issue.\n\nA: One of the commenters suggested restoring the device.\nI had done this in order to install the ios 7 beta.\nSince that time I have been able to e-mail voice memos.\nI am not sure if this is as a result of doing a system restore or if it is an os system fix.\n\nA: i had several iphone voice memos fail to email from the phone today, each no larger than 1mb (256kb .m4a file for example, just a little 10 second clip), with a strong wifi signal on iPhone 6 iOS version 10.3.1... try to send as \"mail\" from the voice memo app > \"share\" > \"mail\" > the file shows up as an attachment in my email app like expected, add recipient & hit send > i hear the 'woosh' sound as if it was sent, but come to find out hours later the emails never went... tried a few more times recently from the phone to email with the same failed result.. still not sure why.. eventually i messaged them from my phone to myself instead, voice memo > \"share\" > \"message\" > enter my own contact & send, then I opened the messages app on my computer, the messages had come through in less than a minute > then i downloaded the files from messages to my computer's local hard drive, then attached the downloaded files to a new email on my computer via gmail in web browser, and send, they went out fine right away... in this case pretty sure it is not an issue of file size or data speeds.. seems to be some type of glitch or bug with the phone or iOS itself regarding voice memos > mail... workaround is okay but not ideal if my computer wasnt handy.. i assume airdropping to my own computer might have been a viable workaround as well, but didn't try that... Voice Memos > share > Mail is not working as expected with my configuration, consistently fails. frustrating, disappointing \n\nA: I had the same question and just figured it out. On my iPhone4!! When you go to the vm and to bottom left corner to share, instead of sending the voice memo as a message or email, you go straight to gmail icon (if you have this) and send it to gmail. Then you will get it. \n\nA: I've figured out that if I can upload the voice-memo to iCloud drive, and then open it on my Mac as my iPhone and Mac are synced, I can then send it on Gmail from there.\n", "Q: Problem with downloading HD movies to Mac when syncing with iPad 3 I bought several HD movies using iPad3, however when I try to sync my iPad with MacBook Air (i7, 13\", Mid2012) they are downloaded with much lower resolution to my Mac. \nI don't know also I this is connected, but I don't see them in iCloud (no iCloud icon next to them in iTunes, so I'm unable to re-download them once deleted, all I can do is to sync with iPad 3 but with low resolution)\n\nA: You're looking at the wrong file. Open iTunes and go to playback (iTunes > Preferences > Playback). Set it to play the HD (1080p) file by default. Just because it is the default downloaded HD version, doesn't mean that it will play that one by default.\n", "Q: Is there any potential problem with disabling core dumps? Debugging information (core dumps) gets saved to /cores (information on what was happening when app 'x' crashed). These files can take up a huge amount of space - I have manually removed them several times recovering 3-10GB each time, to no ill effect, with sudo rm -f /cores/*.\nSome recommend disabling core dumps entirely by adding\nkern.coredump=0\n\nto /etc/sysctl.conf. \nWould there be any harm in doing so? Seems like something only the app developer would use.\n\nA: No, disabling Core Dumps will not cause any problems, as you've said, it is meant for developers and IT Managers. Apple, in a Technical Note, says:\n\nThere are a number of circumstances in which the ability to capture a kernel core dump is useful.\n\n*\n\n*When you're writing a kernel extension and you encounter a kernel panic, you can usually debug the problem with the two-machine kernel debugger. However, there are circumstances where this isn't possible. For example, if a tester or end user reports a problem that you can't reproduce on your desktop—either because it happens infrequently or because it only happens with obscure hardware or in a non-standard environment—you will not be able to debug using the standard tools. In these circumstances it's helpful if you can capture a core dump of the panicked kernel and debug using that core dump.\n\n\n*If you manage a large group of Macintosh computers, you might want to monitor which computers are panicking and why. You can use this information to determine how frequently kernel panics occurs, whether there are any common symptoms, and, most importantly, whether any third party kernel extensions are involved.\n\n\n*Finally, if you manage a high-availability Macintosh server and you have problems with the server panicking, you can capture a kernel core dump, immediately restart the server, and then debug the problem offline.\n\nThere's even a good reason not to keep them, as the Core Dumps may contain sensitive data, which an attacker could use in a nefarious way.\n", "Q: Macbook Air Caps Lock Delay in Windows 8 I have remapped Caps Lock to Backspace in Windows 8 using SharpKeys on my Macbook Air, but there is a noticeable delay that prevents me from quickly pressing the key to backspace. The Delete has no such delay.\nI have installed the Boot Camp Windows Support software.\nApparently this is a hardware limitation to prevent people from hitting Caps Lock, but OS X can get around it.\nHow can I prevent this delay on Windows 8?\n\nA: This has been asked on StackOverflow and SuperUser as well as here. Here's a link to the Ask Different answer that points you to other possible solutions.\nHow to remove caps lock delay on Apple MacBook Pro aluminum keyboard\nThe easiest solution would be to use a third party keyboard, although that can have its own disadvantages.\n", "Q: iTunes Sync Problem with iPhone 5 I just got my iPhone 5, and I installed iTunes 11.01. When I connect my iPhone via USB to my laptop, it just charges. Nothing happens with iTunes nor with my iPhone.\nI restarted the iTunes and my iPhone too, but nothing happened.\nIs there another program like iTunes for iPhone to download songs?\n\nA: Open iTunes, go into preferences, Devices tab , and make sure that the prevent iPods, iPhones, and iPads from syncing automatically!

I have russian as my primary system language and the option \"allow different input language for different documents\" is active. But when I open any app keyboard automatically switches to russian, while I want it to be english by default. Is there any way to change the default keyboard layout without changing system language?\n\nA: When I tried enabling the setting (Input source options: Allow a different one for each document), new windows seemed to just use the current input source.\nAnyway, you could try running sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/Setup\\ Assistant.app/Contents/MacOS/Setup\\ Assistant and selecting US as the default input method. (You have to go through the steps of creating a new account, but you can delete it later.) It modifies at least /var/root/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.HIToolbox.*.plist.\nIf that doesn't work, try running sudo languagesetup and selecting English, or sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist AppleLocale en_US and restarting.\n\nA: Try the option Use the same one in all documents and with a keyboard shortcut you can easily switch between different input methods, for example, Cmd + Space.\n", "Q: What time is shown for received push notification? When a push notification is shown on the sleep screen, there is a time attached to it. What time is this? Is it when it was received on the phone?\n\nA: Yes. All times listed on your phone indicate when you received the notification and are relative to the current time on the phone. This includes not only notifications on the lock screen, but also in the Messages.app, for example, and the Mail.app. \nAll time stamps are listed for when the notification was delivered, or when the action occurred on your phone (you made a phone call, and looked in Phone > History).\n\nA: Yes, the time displayed is the time when it was received by the Device. \n", "Q: launchd initiated process receiving signal 15 (TERM) I've installed TotalFinder (a plugin, of sorts, for Finder) and it's randomly being killed off several times a day.

It does slow down the system somewhat while running, but should provide you with the results you need - just make a note of your Finder PID before hand, and then let it run (either while you are working, or overnight to avoid disrupting your work) and look to see what killed that PID.\n", "Q: Samba share unreachable on OS X 10.8.2 I have a remote Samba share with my web hosting provider. I am unable to access it using OS X 10.8.2, while accessing it from a Windows 7 VM inside the OS X works fine. On OS X, I use \"connect to server...\" and try to access smb://servername/sharename. The operation times out with an unspecified error.\nAccording to the hosting provider, this is because Apple dropped native Samba support in 10.7, and started using its own implementation of the protocol instead. This new implementation seems to have compatibility problems that prevent connecting to this particular remote share.\nThis Apple forum thread seems to confirm that users are having issues since OS X 10.7.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a simple way to get back native Samba support in 10.8.2? I myself am not afraid of some command line tinkering but I want to share this samba drive with a number of colleagues. I wouldn't want to have to make deep changes to their OS Xes.\n\n*Alternatively, do any third-party tools exist that add  support for \"original\" Samba?\n\nA: I am only guessing here, as my G4 quicksilver can't run OS X 10.8, but the confil file may require SMB signing and NTLM v2, try lowering the authentication level, and turning off SMB signing and let me know if that resolves your issue. In previous versions it was smb.conf\nYou may want to also try:\nhttp://eduo.info/apps/smbup\nhttp://jsddevelopment.blogspot.com.es/2012/06/wdtv-live-and-samba.html\n\nA: Make sure to use back slashes \\ for smb urls instead of forward slashes // used for afp.\n", "Q: Self-Assigned IP on Ethernet (en0) Past few days my internet has been automatically getting a Self-Assigned IP on en0.

As noted today on MacRumors Apple to Halt Mac Pro Sales in Europe Effective March 1 Over Regulatory Requirements However they fail to mention the specifics of why it fails to meet \"Amendment 1 of regulation IEC 60950-1, Second Edition\" ?\n\nApple today issued a notice to European distributors indicating that it will halt sales of the Mac Pro in Europe and select other countries as of March 1 due to new regulatory requirements going into effect on that date. The move will affect all European Union countries, as well as EU candidate countries and the four European Free Trade Association countries: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.\n\nAs of March 1, 2013, Apple will no longer sell Mac Pro in EU, EU candidate and EFTA countries because these systems are not compliant with Amendment 1 of regulation IEC 60950-1, Second Edition which becomes effective on this date.

So, Apple has again updated their XProtect malware definitions to block Java Applets. Unfortunately, my wife's employer's VPN requires an Applet to be run in order to fully establish connectivity. She woke up this morning to discover she couldn't connect to work.\nI have little hope that her employer's IT organization will do anything to resolve this anytime soon, so I'm trying to figure out a way to override XProtect and re-enable Applets. Yes, I understand the dangers associated with such.\nI haven't yet tried updating the XProtect.meta.plist file to change the version information, but I suspect that wouldn't be a durable fix even if it did work temporarily, as the XProtect daemon would presumably re-download updated definitions.\nAnybody knowledgeable on the inner workings of XProtect?\nThe computer is still on Snow Leopard, running Java 6.\n\nA: You can disable the XProtect updates in System Preferences => Security => General, and there uncheck the box \"Automatically update safe downloads list.\"\nNow you can change the version info in /System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/XProtect.meta.plist\n\nA: Just got bitten by this & there is another way to re-enable Java that is outlined here.\nSo the deal is Apple will not load Java less than version 1.6.0_37-b06-435 or 1.7.11.22.  So the hacky—but usable—solution is to edit the XProtect.meta.plist.

Using the same settings today, I can scrape at most 3.5 hours of battery life. \nSome of this is due to the fact that my battery is 2 years old and has been through 475 charge cycles. That said, the Battery Health app says that my battery should still be able to carry up to 85% of it's capacity, so I would expect around 6 hours of usage at least. \nI believe that the remaining decrease in performance is just linked to software changes in Mac OS X 10.8 that automatically turn on the discrete graphics card.\nAny advice that can improve my battery life would be very much appreciated. That said, my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to permanently turn off the discrete graphics card in Mac OS X 10.8.2? I used to be able to do this using the gfxCardStatus app in Mac OS X 10.6 and 10.8. Unfortunately, however, it does not work in 10.8. This is frustrating since the discrete graphics card turns on automatically whenever I run an app like VLC which uses OpenG. I hear this is to make sure that apps which use OpenGL run smoothly... but VLC already runs smoothly on computers with only integrated graphics cards... so what the hell?\n\n*Am I right in believing that the battery life issues are related to the way that Mac OS X 10.8 handles the graphics card switch? Another culprit could be that I replaced a few of my MBP parts myself a few months ago. In particular, I upgraded the RAM on the machine from 8 GB to 16 GB, installed a 512 GB SSD (which was supposed to be more energy efficient), and also removed the CD / DVD Drive (did not install anything in its place). Is there any way to tell?\n\nA: Yes, you can achieve that using certain EFI variable. I answered this other question with the full procedure to permanently disable discrete graphics card on startup.\nPreventing your computer from switching to discrete graphics card will allow you to asses if that is the reason for your poor battery performance.\n\nA: Have you give gfxCardStatus a try? They have option to use Integrated only, Discrete only and Dynamic (default behavior) as you can see in the screenshot below.\nThe Dynamic switching behavior can cause battery problem in some apps, take an example like LittleSnapper. The app will cause switching to discrete graphic card upon running; causing battery drain. You might also observe this behavior if you're using a buggy nightly channel of WebKit or Google Chrome Canary.\n\n", "Q: Faster than Time Machine for Backup I want to do a full backup of my Mac to an external disk AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.

I've tried all kinds of tricks on Yosemite to make myself sure.\n(in the fstab file you can use \"\\040\" between words which acts like a space )\nHowever, you can use manual command to mount to such points, for SMB it will be:\nmount_smbfs //user:password@server/share%20with%20spaces /Volumes/Network/Share\\ With\\ Spaces/\n\nProbably this could exist in some Automator script and get executed at a startup time, but this is not automount, of course.

Time machine backed up my previous system, its not like an image right? it's different? Will I still be able to access these files?\n\nA: You will still be able to access your Time Machine backup -- but there is really no way to be assured that it will work fully and that no files have been corrupted since they were first backed up. If you have enough space, I would recommend making a new backup on its own partition with SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner (the free/trial versions should suffice for a one-time backup), before wiping your mac. Note that if your external hard drive happens to fail before you've copied the stuff back onto your Mac, you will lose all your data, so it would be even better if you could make a second backup to independent media before wiping your Mac.\n", "Q: Can't create a Fluid App due to \"Invalid Certificate\" I am trying to create a Fluid App for a work intranet.

Yes, you can fix this now by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Visit the page in Safari\n\n*Expand the \"Invalid Certificate\" Dialog\n\n*Select \"Always Trust\" option\n\n\nNow you can it works in Fluid too \n\n", "Q: Merging Multiple CSV Files without merging the header I need to merge multiple .CSV files (using the cat command) but without copying the header for each file. \nWhat's the best way to accomplish this task?\n\nA: You could also use a group command ({ ; }) instead of process substitution (<()):\n{ head -n1 file1.csv; for f in file*.csv; do tail -n+2 \"$f\"; done; } > new.csv\n\nIt also works with CRLF line endings as long as the files end with an empty line (\\r\\n).\nThe number-only versions of head and tail were made obsolete by POSIX 1003.1-2001, and they result in warnings in some environments.\n\nA: You'll need more than the cat command, as described here:\nSay you have 3 CSV-files: file1.csv, file2.csv, and file3.csv and want to join them to bigfile.csv and your header is always (only) the first line, then use \neither (keep header from first file \"file1.csv\"):\ncat file1.csv <(tail +2 file2.csv) <(tail +2 file3.csv) > bigfile.csv\n\nor (remove header from all files who's names begin with \"file\"):\nawk 'FNR > 1' file*.csv > bigfile.csv\n\n\nA: I agree with the top answer but I suggest to extend it with the following scenario (as I can not comment):\nIf you want the output file to contain header (once) the correct script is:\nawk '(NR == 1) || (FNR > 1)' file*.csv > bigfile.csv\n\nFNR represents the number of the processed record in a single file. And NR represents it globally, so first line is accepted and the rest are ignored as before.\n\nA: Needed to concatenate two large CSVs with identical columns into larger CSV for chunking script (data does not have unique id's).  \nFirst took header out of second csv \nawk 'FNR > 1' file2.csv > file2_noheading.csv\n\nNext, concatenated via the following\ncat file1.csv file2_noheading.csv > newfile.csv\n\n\nA: Using the command sequence above resulted in a file looking like this:\nheader,of,csv1\ncontents,of,csv1\n==> csv2.csv\n\ncontents,of,csv2\n\nTo make it a proper CSV, with one header line and all the relevant values, I employed the following sed incantation... sed -ie \"/^$/d;/^==>/d\" bigfile.csv\n\nA: Easier Solution if you have a ton of files : \nawk 'FNR > 1' *.csv > merged.csv\n\nJust go back to edit the big file and add the header back in.\n", "Q: Why do I have duplicate groups in Contacts app on my iPhone? If I open the Contacts app on my iPhone I get duplicate groups, hence duplicate contacts.\nI started to delete one of a duplicate contact but they both gone away.\nI thought I could solve this problem going on my Mac and delete the duplicate groups but there I don't have duplicates.\nI'm using iCloud for syncing contactes between my MacBook Pro and iPhone.\nHow can I solve this problem?\n\nA: The best procedure is to one by one, turn off each cloud sync source of contacts.\nThey will remain in the cloud and be removed one by one from your iPhone.\nWhen you have all cloud accounts turned off as far as injecting contacts into the contact app, you will be left with only the local groups and contacts stored on the device itself. If you don't wish to have a local contact on the phone, sync and delete these from a computer (or manually from the device).\nAt that point, re-establish the cloud sync for each account - checking that there are no duplicates after each addition.\nOnce you have eliminated the possibility of duplicates locally vs. cloud - you can quite easily clean up the cloud source of duplicates if needed.\n\nA: This is most probably due to the fact that you are using multiple contacts accounts with which you sync your iPhone. If your contacts and contact groups are identical for your iCloud account as well as on your Mac, this could cause the issue. \n\nA: I had  similar problem with my contacts' groups, when I switched to iCloud. I had most of the groups repeated four times, identical contacts.  I followed the following simple steps:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Settings --> iCloud --> turned OFF contacts.\n\n*It asked if to keep or delete from iPhone. Delete from iPhone\n\n*Sign out from iCloud.\n\n*Restart iPhone, the contacts all emptied.\n\n*Sign iCloud --> turn ON contacts.\n\n\nA: POSSIBLE CAUSE?\nI had the dreaded double-grouping happen this week. \nT-Mobile sent me a new iPhone 5 due to a battery issue.  After the SIM card was switched and the new iphone booted, I had the old iPhone turned on so I could see what all apps I had loaded and could configure the screens/accounts manually.  (I know, I can go through the backup/restore, but had other reasons not to.)  The old iPhone was still connected to my WiFi.\nAfter sitting overnight, I woke up to duplicated groups.  ALL of them.\nI am wondering if having the old phone online w/ iCloud at the same time contributed to the duplication?\n", "Q: How can I find my Apple ID on my iPad? My mum can't find her apple ID on her iPad. I'm not with her at the moment and do not have an iPad so I don't know where to look.\nShe already has an Apple ID set up on this iPad, so I don't want to set up another one.\n\nA: The first option should be the most reliable:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings.app, scroll down and tap on \"iTunes & App Stores\". The Apple ID that the device is currently signed into will be at the top of the screen next to \"Apple ID\".\n\n\nAlternate methods (only on iOS 5 or newer):\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings.app > iCloud (under \"Account\")\n\n*Settings.app > Messages > Send & Receive At (under \"Apple ID\")\n\n*Settings.app > Facetime (under \"Apple ID\")\n\n", "Q: Deauthorizing a working computer: does the iTunes library need to be present? I am shortly going to be reformatting a Windows computer that my wife uses for iTunes. She keeps her library and her library files on an external drive. This is her active library -- that is, it is NOT a backup. (She does not have any files on the local hard drive, and always launches iTunes holding down the Shift key so that she can choose her library from the external drive.) Her external drive is currently not available, however. Can we deauthorize the computer from her account JUST by logging her into the iTunes store from that computer and deauthorizing it? Or does the external drive with her library need to be connected before we can deauthorize the computer?\n\nA: The authorization link is between the computer and the Apple ID, not any particular iTunes Library. So, no, you don't need the library to break that connection. You can create an empty library temporarily, just to get iTunes to launch, then use Deauthorize This Computer.\nIf you throw that computer in the garbage, you can always go to your iTunes account on another computer and click \"Deauthorize All\" to remove all authorizations at once.  You can then reauthorize your current computers as needed.\n", "Q: Import certificates into the System Keychain via the command line Is it possible to copy a certificate to a machine running OS X Snow Leopard, add it to the System Keychain, then set it to \"Always Trust via SSH?\"\nAnd if so... how?\n\nA: To import a trusted certificate use the terminal command\nsudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain <certificate>\n\nThis will add a trusted certificate to the System.keychain. You should modify the options and paths to suit your situation. See the man page for security for more information.\n↬ Rich Trouton, Adding new trusted root certificates to System.keychain\n\nA: The selected answer does not really work on newer versions of MacOS.\nThe correct command now is:\nsudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustAsRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain <certificate>\n\nNote: tested with MacOS 12(Monterey) and MacOS 13(Ventura)\n", "Q: Getting iTune to add remote items to library I keep my music on a local Ubuntu server.

When I open it to start using it again it seems to sometimes have trouble 'waking up'. Sometimes this is instantaneous, sometimes I get a blank screen for 30 seconds, sometimes the screen is ok but all the programs are frozen and sometimes I can move the mouse around the screen but cant click anything.\nAll these states seem to sort themselves out after about 2 minutes which isnt too bad - just slightly annoying.\nI've also noticed that it doesnt seem to matter how long the laptop has been on standby for or what programs are running in the back ground - It just seems random.\nIs this natural? Would anyone know why this is occurring?\nLike I said, not a big issue at all - just curious.\n\nA: Turns out it was my hard drive being very close to full.\n", "Q: Use a remote display as a local one I was wondering if I could use a display connected to another machine (Linux Mint XFCE) to extend my OSX desktop.

I have a 17\" MacBook Pro with mini-DisplayPort output - the model before Thunderbolt. On that basis buying a Thunderbolt display is out. It has switched Intel HD/Nvidia GT 330M graphics.\nDell have a new 27\" model, the U2713HM - like the U2711 it has a multitude of inputs and it looks like it should be usable with my Mac if I just get a mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable. I think this is the one because it is affordable and the anti-glare coating is reported to be excellent compared to the heavy, sparkly U2711's coating. All the reviewers who aren't concerned with gaming love it, those that do note that the 22ms input lag is better than the 2711 has but is still pretty bad.\nBut has anyone actually done it? VGA, DVI and Thunderbolt I know about, but I want to be sure about this monitor before buying it. If I need to upgrade the Mac to drive a large external monitor that changes everything and the Thunderbolt 27\" is back in the picture.\n\nA: The answer is yes - using the Monoprice 3ft DisplayPort to Mini DisplayPort cable it works perfectly.\nBefore the cable arrived I used DVI, through the Apple Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter - adapters with firmware version 1.03 work reliably though 1.02 did not. Apple replaced mine because of this, see support bulletin here. It's nice to put the bulky adapter and bulky DVI cable away.\n", "Q: Powerpoint: compress or downsample large images/graphics I'm using Powerpoint 2011, and I'm not able to find an option to easily downsample or compress images to produce a smaller output PPTX or PPT file. \nI don't need the high resolution in some of the images in the slide, so the downsampling wouldn't hurt, but the option just does not seem to exist in the Mac version of Powerpoint (the Windows version has this feature.)\nIs there any way I can compress the image and graphics sizes while saving or exporting a Powerpoint file in Mac? Or do I have downsample each of the individual images?\n\nA: In PowerPoint 2011, you can use File > Reduce File Size to auto-downsample images. The dialog gives you a few options for quality:\n\n", "Q: iPad Mini internet connection (No WiFi) I'm planning to buy an iPad mini + cellular but not on my country. I would buy itt on the United States and someone is going to bring it to me. I have some questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*The person who is going to buy the ipad Mini would need to choose a data service from AT&T or any of the other services? \n\n*If it is necessary and the person picks AT&T... would i need to unblock it or something like that? The person would need to suscribe to some kind of data plan?\n\n*In my country there isn't LTE cellular network yet... The 3G will work?\n\n\nA: In the US - all iPads (including the mini) are unlocked, pay as you please, no contract devices. The two models of mini are A1454 and A1455 with similar GSM 3G coverage:\n\n\n*\n\n*Model A1454\n\n\n*\n\n*GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)\n\n*UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz)\n\n*LTE (Bands 4 and 17)\n\n\n*Model A1455\n\n\n*\n\n*CDMA EV-DO Rev.

B (800, 1900, 2100 MHz)\n\n*GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)\n\n*UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz) \n\n*LTE (Bands 1, 3, 5, 13, 25)\n\n\n\nhttp://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/specs/\nAccordingly, you can pick whether want to optimize your LTE future bands (or travel bands) or choose a CDMA+GSM model or the GSM only model. Since there are very few countries with CDMA coverage out side the USA, most people end up shopping the AT&T model 1454 - but curiously, the CDMA model 1455 matches many foreign LTE deployments and plans, so it's a bit of a tradeoff which any one person might prefer world wide.\n", "Q: How to delete a file using the delete key I want to use only the delete key in order to delete files in Finder — no key combinations.\nSo far, I have been unable to find a configuration entry or even a 3rd party app that allow me to change the default behavior of OSX.\nI'm using several systems, and OS X is only one of them. Having some consistency is great. I really want that behavior as it seems straightforward to me that the delete key actually delete.\nDoes someone have a solution?\n\nA: Looks like there are new key combinations that have been included in recent versions of the OS. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236\n\n\n*\n\n*Command-Delete: Move the selected item to the Trash.\n\n*Shift-Command-Delete: Empty the Trash.\n\n*Option-Shift-Command-Delete: Empty the Trash without confirmation dialog.\n\n\nA: This would make forward delete (fn+delete) move files to trash:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add 'Move to Trash' '\\U007F'\n\nIt also makes ⌦ move files to trash when renaming files though. The same method doesn't work for delete (⌫).\nYou could also use KeyRemap4MacBook to change ⌫ to ⌘⌫ in Finder, but it would make renaming files and editing text even more difficult.\nEven if you could change it in Finder, there would still be other places where just delete wouldn't work.\n\nA: You can use Karabiner-Elements  with a modification rule imported from here:\nThe following custom rule that maps Delete to Cmd+Backspace:\n\n~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/_finder_custom.json\n\n{\n  \"title\": \"Finder Custom\",\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Use Delete as Move to Trash\",\n      \"manipulators\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"basic\",\n          \"from\": {\n            \"key_code\": \"delete_forward\",\n            \"modifiers\": {\n              \"optional\": [\"any\"]\n            }\n          },\n          \"to\": [\n            {\n              \"key_code\": \"delete_or_backspace\",\n              \"modifiers\": [\"left_command\"]\n            }\n          ],\n          \"conditions\": [\n            {\n              \"type\": \"frontmost_application_if\",\n              \"bundle_identifiers\": [\n                \"^com.apple.finder\"\n              ]\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nThen open KE and on the Complex Modifications tab, push +Add Rule and then select your rule from the list.\nThe downside is that if you rename a file using finder and press the delete (forward-delete) it deletes the text from the cursor to the beginning.  \nAnother downside is that if you click a file on your desktop and try to rename and use the delete key to delete some of the filename text, it deletes the file.  While I still have this modification in place I do find I am having to remap my brain to use the backspace key when renaming a file and deleting a portion of the text.\nhttps://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements/issues/1081\n\nA: Try presbutan http://briankendall.net/presButan/ it should get you what you want.\n", "Q: Updating macbook from 10.6.0 to 10.6.8 I am trying to update my macbook to 10.6.8.

I downloaded iJoomer in iTunes, and I would like to transfer it into XCode's iPhone Simulator so I can run the app there. \nIs it possible to transfer an app from iTunes to the iPhone simulator? If so, how can I do this?\n\nA: The short answer is no.\nThe reasons are numerous, but the first is that anything compiled to run on a device can not be run in the simulator because the processor architecture is different. The simulator is simulating a device, not emulating a device. Apps run in the simulator are intel x86 binaries, while apps that run on a device are compiled for some version of the ARM processor.\n", "Q: How to delete email messages from Spotlight search on iPhone?

It will be my first Macbook and I don't want to spend too much many and look at Macbook Air 13' 128Gb.\nI'm just wondering if this notebook is good enough to develop a small IPad aps ?\n\nA: The answer depends on the types of apps you are developing. Apps that require some of the specialized hardware on the iPad (accelerometer, GPS, compass, etc…) you won't be able to effectively test in the simulator, so the size of the MBA screen may be fine. However for simple apps that do not require any specialized hardware you may find running in the simulator at 50% a bit too cramped, so you may want to opt for a MacBook Pro with Retina display. Running in the simulator has a much faster turn around than running on a device, especially on a Retina MacBook Pro which is as fast as my 2007 Mac Pro.\nPersonally, I bought a tricked out MacBook Air for my hobby iOS development. I feel I can get away with it because most of my iPad development is on the device. If I used the simulator more I'd move up to a Retina MacBook Pro. I also get more time to play with my stuff because I am willing to take the MacBook Air with me almost anywhere, as opposed to my 15\" MacBook Pro which pretty much sat on my desk.\n\nA: Either one is good enough, but the base MacBook Pro 13\" comes with 8 GB RAM, compared to only 4 GB for the MacBook Air. I just bought at 13\" MBP, and while it's heavier and more expensive, the extra RAM and retina display make it a much better machine. IMHO.\n", "Q: How can I transfer my application to IPad I am thinking about development small applications for IPad and I'm just wondering how can I transfer my application to my IPad?\nI don't have a plans to sell or to distribute my software among the other users.

To test it I started a simple script which tries to repeatedly resolve the same hostname 20 times:\n#!/bin/sh\nfor i in `seq 20`; do\n    time -p dig www.google.com @8.8.8.8 | grep \"^;; Query time:\"\ndone\n\nMost request take about the same time as the latency to the name server:\n;; Query time: 49 msec\nreal 0.05\n\nHowever, as soon as I enable the firewall in Mountain Lion (all incoming requests are allowed, stealth mode is not enabled), some of the dig requests take exactly 5 seconds plus the latency to the name server:\n;; Query time: 25 msec\nreal 5.03\n\nMost requests are still fast, but around every 10th to 15th requests has a delay of exactly 5 seconds even through dig still reports a short query time. It makes no difference if I use dig or host for testing, or if I use a local DNS server or a public one like in the example above. When the firewall is turned off the delay never happens.\nDoes the firewall of OS X enforce some kind of rate limiting for requests, or is there anything else I'm missing?\n\nA: You are right. I diagnose the same rate limiting at the firewall level\non MacOS X 10.7.4 (Lion).\nMoreover, if you look at\n/usr/bin/sudo tcpdump -i en0 udp port 53\n\nYou will notice that the round trip time to get a reply from 8.8.8.8\nis much lower then the 40 msec displayed by the server.\nOn a long test run I had:\n;; Query time: 44 msec\n\nand an average roundtrip time of 26 msec:\n09:36:14.360564 IP me.53866 > google-public-dns-a.google.com.domain: 9943+ A? www.google.com.

I am currently running Mac OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard on my late 2010 Macbook Pro. I am perfectly fine with running Snow Leopard at present, but I feel I may be missing out on features or indeed updates to the Apple Operating System that maybe being provided to later versions of OS X ie Lion or Mountain Lion, that are not available or being provided to Snow Leopard. Someone told me that Snow Leopard is no longer officially supported by Apple anymore (whether this is true or not, I don't honestly know).\nI am apprehensive of upgrading from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion outright on my Macbook Pro, however I have been told there are a number of other ways to utilise both OS Xes on my computer, without having to forgo one OS X (in my case Snow Leopard).\nThe one method that interests me is installing & running OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion from an appropriate external hard drive.\nI would therefore appreciate step by step guidance on how to install & run OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion from an external hard drive onto my Snow Leopard Macbook Pro.\n\nA: It should be as simple as:\nStep Zero: Make sure you have a verified, complete, bootable backup of your Snow Leopard setup, \"just in case\". (And make sure that drive isn't attached when you are installing Mountain Lion, so you don't accidentally choose it.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Attach external drive to MacBook Pro. Format as \"Mac OS Extended (journaled)\". Give it a clear and distinct name such as \"EXTERNAL DRIVE FOR LION\"\n\n*Launch App Store.app. Purchase Mountain Lion.\n\n*Wait wile the installer downloads. It's ~4gb, so you'll be waiting awhile.\n\n*When the installer finishes downloading, it will automatically launch and prompt you to start the upgrade process. DON'T PANIC. Nothing will be done until you tell it to proceed. \n\n*(OPTIONAL BUT HIGHLY RECOMMENDED STEP) Before you start the installation process, quit the installer. Then, go to Finder and open the /Applications/ folder and look for an app called something like \"Install OS X Mountain Lion.app\". Drag it from /Applications/ to somewhere else, like your Desktop. (You may be prompted to enter your password to do this. That's OK.) Why do this? Because if you leave the installer in /Applications/, it will be automatically deleted when the installation completes. I recommend keeping it around because it is useful if you want to make a USB installer or something like that. Once you have moved it, launch the \"Install OS X Mountain Lion.app\" again.\n\n*Very early on in the process you should be able to choose which drive you want to install Mountain Lion to. (You may have to click on a 'Customize' button in the installer.)\n\n*Choose the \"EXTERNAL DRIVE FOR LION\" drive and follow the rest of the prompts in the OS X installer.\n\n*After the installation starts, it will reboot your computer from the external drive and continue the installation. Make sure this is not interrupted.\n\n*When it is done, you can choose the default Startup Disk in System Preferences, or hold down the Option/Alt key when the Mac is booting up.\nBonus Tip: QuickBoot is a free app which will let you reboot your Mac using a different drive than the default startup disk without changing the default startup disk.\nJust go slow, watch what you are doing, and it should be very straight-forward.\n(Nevertheless, don't forget Step Zero. Have you booted from your backup drive lately to make sure it really boots?)\n", "Q: Would Upgrading to 16GB RAM be Beneficial? I'm running on an i3 processor, 2010 model, 3.06 GHz.\n\nI'm currently have 4GB of RAM, but if I were to upgrade to 16GB, would:\n\n\n*\n\n*Applications open quicker?\n\n*FPS increase in game?\n\n*Overall performance increase?\n\n\nThanks for your help.\n\nA: Looking at your memory usage you don't need more RAM.\nTo answer your questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apps may open faster if you are running lots of heavy duty apps, like Photoshop, Xcode, etc…\n\n*I doubt you'd see much of an increase in the FPS in games. That depends on the video card and how well the game is written.\n\n*Overall performance increase would probably be minimal. The biggest bottleneck is if you are running off a spinning disk, upgrading to an SSD would probably be the biggest performance gain, depending on what you use your computer for.\n\nA: If you are using many programs at the same time e.g many browser tabs and you are left with little free RAM then yes, you will see performance increased. \nIt really depends on the usage. I can't work on a computer with less than 8GB of RAM (many, many chrome tabs, iTunes, and 3-4 programs open at the same time). But many people are OK with 4GB.\n\nA: Yes, it seems that from your screen capture you do need more RAM.\nFrom the Apple support pages:\n\nTip: Page outs occur when the Mac has to write information from RAM to\n  the hard drive (because RAM is full).  Adding more RAM may reduce page\n  outs.\n\nSo it seems that you're heavily maxing out your RAM. Check this value and try to determine when you're out of RAM, it could be a one off, but if you're always in the GB definitely upgrade.\nKeep in mind that it won't be reset until you restart your computer, it's cumulative.\n", "Q: Factory Settings to Speed Up Mac? My iMac (2010, i3, 3.06 GHz, 4GB RAM) has been getting a little slower. My research shows memory can cause a slow performance, so I looked and most of the time, my RAM is allocated like this:\n.\nWould resetting my Mac to factory settings increase performance/speed it up?\n\nA: I would say, that your RAM usage is not the issue, but you would need to edit in some more measurements about what is slow (or make the detailed measurements in the first place) and look at perhaps network latency (web pages take a while to paint), network bandwidth (iTunes movies take hours to download instead of minutes), or CPU perhaps.\nIn the RAM snapshot, the system looks to be used lightly, due to a small amount of inactive RAM and the large amount of free memory. Over time, if your programs need more than half the RAM for active and wired, you would see a speed up when switching between seldom used apps if you doubled your RAM so that rather than releasing memory, the system would build up a larger cache of \"inactive\" memory, but that's just speculation.\nWhy not pick one or two things that seem slow to you and make 10 measurements on how long they take. At that point you can ask a more pointed question or perform the restore and re-test the speed to see if your change made any difference.\n\nA: In my experience, it's often virtual memory that slows things down, especially if you have a Mac with a hard disk. You're using 4.8 GB of swap files, which is a fair amount, and if you have an app that is swapping a lot, that prevents other apps from accessing the disk at the same time. My Mac mini, with 16 GB RAM, and an uptime of over 5 days, currently has 0 swap files. So adding RAM will help with swapping, but also trying to find which apps are the culprits may help as well. And if you restart from time to time, you'll find that speeds things up, as the swap files get deleted.\n", "Q: How to run a bash script from the desktop? I have a .sh file with a #!/bin/bash header. I'm able to run it from the terminal, using chmod and ./ but is there a way to perform these two operations from the desktop (i.e. by clicking on it) ?\nBtw, I'm familiar with linux, but not with OS X.\n\nA: You can add a .command extension to your text script.\nThen use chmod 744 to make it executable.\nWhen opened or double-clicked in the Finder it will then run from the Terminal.\n\nA: Well you can wrap it inside a AppleScript, make a call to shell command (your bash script).\nexample: do shell script\ndo shell script \"/bin/tcsh my-command-file-path\"\n\nsave it as an application to your Desktop to run it.\n\nA: You can put any commands into an AppleScript, and save the script as an applet, or a droplet, or use Automator to create applets and/or droplets. Just use the do shell script command in the AppleScript. \n", "Q: Can not change country of apple ID It doesn't work when I change the country of my apple ID. I come to the page where I need to fill in my address and billing information, but when I press next I come back to settings and when I press view apple ID, the country has not changed.\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: Changing the country for an Apple ID is impossible. Unfortunately it has never been. It is most probably related to the fact that you are not expected to simply hop from one country to the next and change your payment information associated with your Apple ID (i.e. local credit card) with it. \nHowever, it is possible to open multiple Apple Accounts each associated with a different country and if needed a credit-card issued in the respective country.\n", "Q: Run iPhone Apps on MacOs Laptop for free I have a .ipa file in my laptop and also have a Apple Laptop with MacOS. I do not have any iPhone. I want to run the app in my Laptop. Doing a quick Google Search brought me this., which looks like costing $99 for each year. I just want to run the app for free, what should I do?\n\nA: You cannot run iOS applications on anything other than iOS. And you need a device capable of running iOS (iPhone or iPad).\nThe reason being is that iOS applications are compiled to run on the ARM-based processor. OS X (and most desktop or notebook operating systems) run on the i386 or x64 architecture.\nTo run a different arch-type, you'd need an emulator. And all Xcode has is a simulator. \n", "Q: Emacs copy a paste line with comment adds extra space / line I work in emacs in a termal tab, and instead of using the built in copy and paste shortcut commands I generally just highlight (with the mouse) to copy and paste.  This works fine for normal code/text, but when the section being copied includes a comment, the pasted text includes extra white-space after the end of the comment line - and it's a pain to go to every comment line and delete that whitespace (which wraps onto a newline).  See example below:\nIs there anyway to stop this behavior?\nFor example, in a python code, highlighting from the initial # to the end of \"stringy\":\n# Some comment line\nsomeInt = 10\nsomeString = \"stringy\"\n\nis copied and pasted as:\n# Some comment line                                                  \n              | <-- end on first pasted line is now about here\nsomeInt = 10\nsomeString = \"stringy\"\n\n\nA: I guess you problem arises to an extend from continuing lines which get copied with the physical line break on screen. One way to avoid this and get proper mouse highlighting in Emacs, is running it as a separate GUI app. I installed GNU Emacs for Mac OSX and it runs perfectly with mouse selection capabilities: You can select with the mouse and continuing lines get copied as single lines as you want it.\nGNU Emacs for Mac OSX  will pick up your normal .emacs configuration and if you do not like the GUI elements like the toolbar you can hide them on startup in the variable default-frame-alist.\n", "Q: Can Airport Extreme host a standing VPN connection? I'm not sure how to word this to even google if this is possible even without an Airport Extreme, but my network has the AE providing network services to it.  What I want to do is have the AE establish the VPN to another network so that the computers behind the AE just think the remote VPN computers are available.\nIn other words, from my mac at home, I can easily VPN to work.  But I'm looking to have the AE do the VPN connection, so that I don't have to manually set it up on my computer each time.\n\nA: No, the Airport Extreme does not provide any VPN services.\n", "Q: Rules for Spotlight search (on osx 10.8) I absolutely do not understand the rules that Spotlight (osx 10.8) uses to search my files. If I enter the query sbml and select filename from the dropdown menu, these are the results that come up:\nBIOMD0000000051_SBML-L2V4.xml\nrunImmdeath_noSBML.py\nrunp53_noSBML.py\nSBMLParser.py\n\nbut if I chose the query libsbml instead, this is the only result I get:\nlibsbml-5.6.0-libxml2-macosx-lion.dmg\n\nNow, I wouldn't expect the first four answers to come up on the second search, but why does a search for sbml not turn up libsbml-5.6.0-libxml2-macosx-lion.dmg? Clearly, sbml doesn't have to be the first 4 letters in the filename, nor the last 4 before the extension. So what is the deal?\n\nA: I rans a few tests in 10.8.2. My empirical results show that spotlight returns results for partial matches when the start of the name matches, but not any part of the name. I have not found a way to change this.\nI have another challenge with multiple word searches. My empirical experience is that a filename search containing multiple words (separated by spaces) yields results only if the search words are contiguous in the filename. For example:\nGiven some files with these names:\nxxx rules and roles yyy.zzz\naaa roles and rules bbb.ccc  \n\n\n*\n\n*a search for {roles} or {rules} will find both files\n(note: the braces are included here for clarity; they are not part of the search string)\n\n*a search for {rules and roles} will find the first file only;\n\n*a search for {roles and rules} will find the second file only;\n\n*a search for {roles rules} or {rules roles} will find nothing;\n\n\nI find this last behaviour frustrating, as I don't want to have to remember the word order in my filenames. And one-word searches get too many hits.\nAnyone with answers for this?\n", "Q: How to manually determine version control metadata for Finder? I have a Scripts folder where I keep Automator actions, Applescripts, and shell scripts. Automator scripts are automatically assigned a version of 1.1.1 it seems. When I make revisions to any of these kinds of documents, how can I manually set the versions so that info will display in the finder, either with Get Info or in a folder list with Version view enabled?\nEspecially in the case of shell scripts (zsh), is there a comment format where I can enter the version of the script and Finder will see it? Or is there a way to associate an editable system resource to the scripts that will make the script version visible?\n\nA: Finder does not keep track of versions as it just represents the file system which under HFS+ does not keep versions. \nI don;t see how to do exactly what you want but I think a way that would work is to use version control as used by programmers - I use this for control of my shell and other scripts.\nExamples of this are git, mercurial, svn(subversion) with various GUIs available e.g. SourceTree (for all three).\nGit and mercurial work by s saving a set of changes across all files in a project which when you need more than one file you will find is needed. This snapshot of files can be tagged with a name e.g. 1.0.0 etc. Each change is individually labelled with a version control assigned name. The version data is kept in metadata in the version control system and not in the files as putting the version number in the files was found not to be useful. The GUI can browse over the file system and can show the change history. \n", "Q: Restore all Notes from iCloud I deleted numerous Notes from my phone that I want to get back from iCloud.  My phone has not updated to iCloud so the Notes are still good on the cloud.  How do I get all files from cloud back onto phone\n\nA: First, access the notes in iCloud and copy their contents, just in case. Second, one solution that should work is to edit each of the notes slightly, giving them something that happened to them more recently than when you deleted the from your phone. Third, on to your iPhone, disable Notes from the iClouds portion of Settings which should make them local. Go online, turn the Notes syncing back on, and it should get them.\n\nA: The simplest way is to go to icloud.com, log in with your iCloud Apple ID, and click the \"Notes\" app icon. All of your notes should be there for you to access. \nObviously if you have had an internet connection it may have already synced those changes (deletions) and if that's the case your notes will be permanently lost. \nGo ahead and email the deleted notes to yourself, or, create new notes and copy the deleted ones in there. \nAnd certainly don't connect your iPhone to the internet in the mean time.\n", "Q: MacPro 1st Gen - can it handle SSDs? I have a MacPro 1,1 and am considering putting an SSD in it to give it a boost. Can I safely assume compatibility or will its ancient  hardware and architecture cause issues? It cannot, as I recently discovered, run Mountain Lion so I'm not sure if I should even try bringing it up to date.\n\nA: Yes, I can confirm that I have installed an SSD into my Mac Pro 1,1. Because the drive is a 2.5\" drive, though, I am using a 2.5\" to 3.5\" SATA converter sled. Note, if I recall, there are some of these converters that only work with certain models.\n\nA: Definitely confirm the claim that you can use an adapter before you go out and buy SSD drives.  I have a MacPro 3,1 with the Apple RAID controller.  I was told by a couple vendors specializing in hardware upgrades for Macs that the adapters being sold now fit the current production Mac Pros, but not the 3,1.  Yours is even older.  There have been some changes to the drive carriers.\nI'd very much like to hear of any source for an adapter that will definitely work the the 3,1 or earlier models.\n\nA: Ia m using a Quad 3.0 Ghz MacPro with an SSD from OWC. They have an adapter that connects the SSD to the original sled and works great. I created a boot disk with Mac OSX 10.7.5 Lion and then used Carbon Copy Cloner to move all the data from my old boot drive. Boots in about 8-10 seconds and runs Photoshop faster than the 8 core brand new MacPro my friend has. I also bought a replacement sled which is only supposed to work in the 8 core machine. It works fine but you can't put the side cover back on the tower because it sticks about an inch to inch and half further. I still use it when I want to replace an old drive or format a new one. And I can keep an off line data drive to swap in an emergency.\n", "Q: Improved Terminal autocomplete funcionality (similar to Matlab's) If any of you ever used Matlab, you might have noticed the command window functionality in that program. I wonder if it is possible to enable the same functionality in Mac Terminal.\nIt works like this: suppose you have used two commands previously in this Terminal session. First you used a cd ~ and then a ls -la.\nIn every *nix terminal, including Mac's, if you hit the Up Arrow, it'll first show the ls -la command and, if you hit it twice, the cd ~ command. This is great. But, in Matlab, if you first type the letter c and then hit Up Arrow, it won't show you ls, but instead go directly to cd ~. This saves a lot of time when you have big commands and a long list of previously used commands.\nIs it possible?\n\nA: Save this as ~/.inputrc:\n# make the up and down arrows cycle through commands that match the start of a line\n\"\\e[A\": history-search-backward\n\"\\e[B\": history-search-forward\n\nOption-up would be \\e\\e[A and control-p \\C-p. You can see the escape sequences of other key combinations by pressing control-v.\n\nA: In a Bash shell, you can hit Control+R to do a reverse intelligent search in the history. Start typing the command and the shell will autocomplete with previously entered commands.\nThen you can either press Enter to execute the command again, use the arrow left or right key to edit the command, or keep pressing Control+R to cycle through other possible completions.\n\n\nA: Another thing you can do is type ! and then the first letter, and it will find the most recent. IE: cd ~ can be accessed with !c\n\nA: This is a feature of the shell. Control-R will do what you describe, but changing to a more modern shell will get you so much more. Take a look at Z-shell (zsh), there is a bit of a learning curve, but it is very powerful.\n\nA: zsh will complete commands exactly like in your example. You don't even have to do anything other than use it for your shell.\n\nA: Add these to your .cshrc (if you are using tcsh) --\n  bindkey -k up history-search-backward\n  bindkey -k down history-search-forward\n\nThen do source ~/.cshrc to get exactly the functionality you describe.\nI don't know if there is a .profile equivalent.\n", "Q: Photo Stream and Videos As Photo Stream pushes pictures to other devices, does it do the same for videos, or is it strictly pictures? If so, how would I push video clips to other devices, or would it be best to sync to my iMac desktop?\n\nA: PhotoStream only syns photos. This is because videos (such as those filmed by the iPhone in 1080p) could easily have file sizes in the gigabytes and it would use up too much bandwidth and online storage for those. Photos on the other hand are just a couple megabytes.\nThe best thing to do is to download videos directly to your desktop (and you can do this with Image Capture, iPhoto, Picasa, whatever you like).\nOne alternative is to use Google+ and turn on Instant Upload. That will store photos and videos in a private online album with Google.\n\nA: They do not sync. I would suggest syncing to your iMac or simply using dropbox.\n", "Q: How to download iCloud Address book to Mac? Using OS 10.7.5.\nHow to get all my contacts from iCloud into my address book on my Mac?\nI opened up iCloud control panel, checked Address book. That doesn't do anything.\n\nA: It takes a while for it to download. You have to wait. There is no indication that it is doing anything.\n", "Q: How to Transfer PDF from iPad to PC/Mac When I bought an iPad 3 They have given me few pdf files. Actually They are eBook which I prefer. PDF files are shown in the Books section of the ITunes program.\nHow to Transfer those PDFs from my Pad to PC/Mac ?\n\nA: Three options \n\n\n*\n\n*use iTunes to sync. To do this, connect your iOS device to your Mac and launch iTunes. Locate your device from the list that appears on the left column. Now select the tab named \"Books\". Make sure the sync button is checked. Since Preview is installed by default on iMacs, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and Mac Mini, after syncing your PDFs will be accessible from Preview. Benefits of using iTunes to sync is you can manage what PDFs appear on your device (and how much space they take).\n\n*use email. Launch iBooks app on your iOS device and make sure you select the bookshelf view (where your PDFs are displayed on a \"shelf\"). That means, open the file you want to share. At the top you will see 3 buttons(left to right):  Library, Index and Share button. Touch the share button (looks like a folder with an arrow coming out) and then Email. Type in your email address and touch Send when done. Note: some email providers impose limits on attachments so you may have to email PDFs a few at a time.\n\n*use Dropbox (Dropbox account required). Sign up for a new account at Dropbox.com, then download the free Dropbox app onto your iOS device. Follow the helpful instruction to upload your photos. Note that these PDFs will be available/synced to all Dropbox client apps that log in using your username and password.\n", "Q: Why can I not reject the exclusion of a partition in Time Machine? I have a MacBook Air 11-inch Mid-2012 running OS X 10.8.2. I have an external hard drive connected via USB. The hard drive has two partitions: an HFS+ partition that I use for Time Machine and a NTFS partition that I use for storing large files that I don't want on my small internal hard drive.\n(Side Note: I use NTFS because the drive may need to be shared directly with Windows machines at some point in the future as hardware comes and goes through my hands a lot. I use Tuxera NTFS to write to the NTFS partition with great success so far.)\nWhen I open Time Machine, I see that the data storage partition is in the exclusion list (that partition is named \"EXTERNAL\"):\n\nWhen I select the \"EXTERNAL\" partition and remove it from the exclusion list, there are no errors and the partition is gone. Also, I see that the estimated backup size has increased by the amount of used space on the \"EXTERNAL\" partition:\n\nHowever after I click save and then open the \"Options...\" window again, I see that the \"EXTERNAL\" partition is still in the list of excluded partitions, exactly like in the first image.\nWhy can I not back this partition up with Time Machine? I have seen other Mac Users report that that they can backup one partition of a disk to another partition on the same disk, but it does not appear that I can. (My reasoning for doing this is that I'd like the local version control that Time Machine offers for quick restoration of accidentally deleted or modified files. I backup both the internal SSD as well as the \"EXTERNAL\" partition using CrashPlan for offsite data protection in the case of a full disk failure.)\n\nA: The problem is that Time Machine is designed for HFS+ formatted volumes.\nYou might have luck with the Paragon NTFS driver but if the NTFS volume is case-sensitive and your normal mac partition is not, you will have problems backing both up to the same Time Machine volume.\nYou might be able to use Carbon Copy Cloner to copy the contents of the NTFS volume to an image file but not a bootable one.\nAlso check out this blog which talks about related NTFS issues.\n", "Q: BetterTouchTool: Is it possible to use a context-menu item with a gesture? Example: I want to attach the \"TipTap Left\" gesture with \"Save Image As...\" from the context-menu in Chrome. Possible?\n\nA: The current version of BetterTouchTool has a Trigger Context Menu Item action in the list of Predefined Actions.\n\nA: You won't be able to do this in BetterTouchTool alone. The following steps use Keyboard Maestro specifically, but you should be able to duplicate them in some way with most any macro application.\n\n\n*\n\n*Set the gesture in BTT to an unusual keyboard shortcut that won't be used by anything else.\n\n\n*In Keyboard Maestro, create a new macro that is triggered by this shortcut.\n\n\n*Set the contents of the macro as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move and Click at (0,0) from the Current Mouse Location\n\n*Insert Text ‘Save Image As’ by Typing\n\n*Type the Return Keystroke\n\n\nHere's what it should look like.\n", "Q: Apple ID - Want to make my xxx@icloud.com primary Apple ID? I recently created an @icloud.com address and now I would like to make that my default or primary address for my Apple ID instead of my current @gmail.com address. \nI tried to change it through the Manage Apple ID page but it said 'Not use a domain used by Apple'. \nIs it advisable to change my Apple ID from @gmail.com to @icloud.com?\n\nA: This problem still exists to this day.  When you set up your Apple ID you are required to enter an already in-use email account that is not associated with an Apple domain.  This becomes your primary Apple ID email account.  From here you can then set up your @icloud.com account but you cannot set that @icloud.com address as the primary account address because Apple does not allow users to do so with Apple owned domains. \nNot to be confusing, but you can set the @icloud.com address as your Apple ID.  To do so, just attempt to log into your primary email address a few times until you are prompted to go to iforgot dot apple.com.  From here just enter your @icloud.com address and select to verify account by answering security questions; do not use verify by email.  Once you successfully answer the security questions you will be prompted for a new password.  After that your @icloud.com address will become your default Apple ID, you can now access iCloud with the @icloud.com address, and you can now use the @iclould.com address for email.\n\nA: There isn't anything you can do with an iCloud.com Apple ID that you can't so with a gmail-based ID, if that's what you're asking. The reason you can't attach your new iCloud address to your existing gmail-based Apple ID account is that, as the previous poster indicated, every iCloud.com address automatically becomes its own independent Apple ID. And Apple, despite tons of interest from users, still won't let you merge two different Apple IDs. \nYou can, if you're interested, add your new iCloud based account and use it for email, Find Friends, iMessage, FaceTime, etc., while keeping your previous account tied to iTunes and the App Store. I've done it that way for years. \n\nA: In short, you don't need to worry about it. What is interesting is that your [xxx]@icloud.com is automatically a \"primary\" Apple ID. When you logged into appleid.apple.com, there should have been an \"Alternate\" Apple ID. This \"Alternate\" Apple ID has the same login capabilities, and password as your @gmail.com account has. \nThe important thing to note is that these email addresses are basically synonymous. You can log in anywhere (including appleid.apple.com) with your @icloud.com address that you can with your @gmail.com account. The password is the same.\nI'm not sure why they do it this way, but it does allow another layer of protection against getting locked out of your account.\n\nA: After messing with the accounts page for a month, I gave up.\nI contacted Apple support to address this issue, but I don't think they know what I mean.\nIt looks like it's impossible to do so just with the account page, I suggest you contact Apple and have them do it for you. (If they could.)\n\nA: While this may not be what your looking for, you can use your xx@icloud.com to log into iCloud account. I like doing this when I get new device and/or resetting. It'll \"look\" like your xx@icloud.com email address is your \n", "Q: Free IP scanner for OS X? I am looking for a, preferably free tool that would scan current network (using the mark) for alive hosts.\nIt needs to be able to resolve hostnames and preferably to support bonjour too.\n\nA: Don't forget about Nmap which is a must-have tool for any network admin or IT type - use the -sn flag for ping Scan, among many other options.\n\nA: Angry IP Scanner is a free IP scanning tool [download].\n", "Q: Dropbox to continue backing up images until it completes I come from Andriod where Dropbox did an amazing job of backing up all my phone's pictures. Since I moved to iPhone I noticed that Dropbox backs-up a few pictures and then stops, popping-up the following message:\n\nHow come Dropbox can't continue backing up until it is finished?\nIs there a way to make it continue automatically?\n\nA: This happens because of a restriction put on all apps performing background tasks, specifically those fetching data. For example, this happens with the Spotify-app as well when it downloads songs for Offline Mode.\nThere isn't really any way to bypass these restrictions, at least not on a non-jailbroken device. It might be impractical, but the only option is opening the app every time it has to pause/terminate it's background tasks. You can of course also keep the app open – that will allow for the tasks to be completed with no practical time limit.\nIf you have jailbroken your device, you can download an app enabling what's commonly called \"true\" multitasking enabling apps, such as InfinityTask, which disables many of Apple's multitasking-restrictions.\n\nA: I guess this worked for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Disabled auto lock  \n\n*Disabled screen timeout  \n\n*Plugged in to power  \n\n*Enabled location services on iPhone for Dropbox and background running option  \n\n*Left the Dropbox app open  \n\n*More than 2000 photos & videos uploaded successfully  \n\n\nA: It worked befure, but after I don't know which update, it stopped working and now I have to open dropbox everytime it stops.\n\nA: Usually, when an app acts up and there's no ready fix, deleting it, restarting (a real Restart) and reinstalling works. \nRecently, Dropbox for iDevice was updated. In this case, I think the problem is fixed.\n", "Q: Command line tool to convert DOC and DOCX files to PDF Is there any command line tool to convert DOC and DOCX files to PDF? If no, can it be automated by some Automator script (open-print to PDF-close)?\n\nA: In Office 2016 the Automator approach will run into issues due to security sandboxing. (The symptom: Word stays open, and you get an \"Error while printing\" dialog.)\nA workaround is to install LibreOffice, which can be used to convert files from the command line. On MacOS, the command is:\n/Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice \\\n  --headless \\\n  --convert-to pdf \\\n  myfile.docx\n\nThe PDF will only be as good as LibreOffice's conversion from MS Office, of course, but it's adequate for many purposes.\nAnother approach, if you really don't care about formatting, is to use pandoc and LaTeX:\npandoc -t latex myfile.docx -o myfile.pdf\n\nYou'll need to install pandoc and LaTeX as described in this answer, though, and your PDF will come out looking like a LaTex document -- basic formatting, headers, lists, etc. will generally be preserved, but things like fonts and margins won't.\n\nA: You can use the docx2pdf command line tool to bulk convert docx to pdf. It uses Microsoft Word to directly convert to pdf so you will need to have it installed. One macOS, it uses JXA (AppleScript for JavaScript) to talk to Word and on windows it uses win32com.\npip install docx2pdf\n\n# single file\ndocx2pdf myfile.docx\n\n# entire folder\ndocx2pdf myfolder/\n\nDisclaimer: I wrote docx2pdf after getting frustrated at the lack of cross-platform tools to convert docx to pdf directly using Microsoft Word as I needed a perfect replica with zero formatting issues. https://github.com/AlJohri/docx2pdf\n\nA: If you have Office:Mac 2008 Business Edition or Office:Mac 2011 Home/Business Edition, Automator actions are included with those editions.  One of the Automator actions included with those versions of Office:Mac is \"Convert Format of Word Documents\", and one of the options in that Automator action is PDF.  This page has great information about Automator and Office:Mac.\nIf you have Home/Student Edition instead of Business Edition, or don't have Office at all, you can accomplish it via AppleScript.  Mac OS X Hints has an article about bulk converting text files to PDF via AppleScript, and the comments to that article give some options to convert DOC/DOCX to PDF via RTF.  That might result in a loss of formatting or linking if you've got very complex DOC/DOCX files, but might be sufficient for files that aren't terribly complex.\n\nA: For my application the LibreOffice solution posted by @David Moles is a great solution. I need to use this from within an application since my version of Word does not run on MacOS 12.3.1 (well, it is 32-bit so it stopped after 10.14.6. I had been using AppleScript to tell Word to convert to pdf).

I just wanted to know whether is possible to use an iPad mini as a cell phone. I am planning to put my SIM card into the iPad mini, which is the Wi-Fi+cellular model. \n\nA: No, you can't use it as a carrier cellphone. But if you have enough data in your plan, you can use it as a cellphone through services such as Google Voice or Skype which can give you a phone number that you can call with and be called with over the internet. They both provide apps that will \"ring\" your iPad when someone calls the number.\nGoogle Voice is free to have a phone number. Calls From the US or Canada to the US or Canada are free, and calls to or from other places are pretty cheap.\nSkype charges for a phone number, but that includes some sort of fee that gives you a predetermined number of minutes.\n\nA: If you mean whether you can make phone calls using your SIM card, no, you can't:\n(from http://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/specs/)\n\nStill, you can use Skype or a VoIP-based phone app (just search the App Store for VoIP), either over WiFi or, if your SIM card has a data plan, over cellular.\n\nA: Yes you can with Tu GO http://www.o2.co.uk/tugo/want-it\nEnjoy.\n", "Q: Usign iMac as a Display for MacBook Pro I did some research on this and they were saying Press Command+F2\nSo did I !

While we don't use these features often, it is especially frustrating that we have already paid for the rental and cannot watch it.\nThe Main Menu screen no longer shows our rental at the top.

I have found that after I add songs to my library and then sync them to my ipod, Itunes will change the genres back to the original listings. It never used to do this. It just started recently. Any suggestions?\n\nA: It has nothing to do with organizing. I've been hearing cases of this recently, especially if people have custom genres that they've created. For some reason, iTunes is switching these back. Is that your case, or are these the standard genres that are in iTunes by default?\n\nA: I'm assuming that you're changing the genre of a song in iTunes and not on the iOS device.\nIf so then maybe having iTunes organise your library is the cause (it's an option buried somewhere in the preferences)\n", "Q: Mac is flashing screen when pressing keys If I press keys that don't do anything on the focused app then the whole screen flashes white, as if the option to flash the screen on alerts (in accessibility preferences) was on, but it is not.\nFor example typing this question the screen does not flash, because pressing the keys is doing something, but If I'm on an app where there is no text field that can be focused pressing keys will make the screen flash white.\n\nA: I think there's an option in System Preferences.\nGo toSystem Preferences > Accessibility > Audio and uncheck the box that says Flash the screen when an alert occurs.\nHope this helped!\n\nA: I had this problem in High Sierra (10.13.6) and a system restart solved it.\n", "Q: Cannot access administrative share (c$) on a Windows 8 PC from Mountain Lion I'm having an issue trying to access administrative shares on my Windows 8 PC from my MacBook Air running OSX 10.8.2.\nHere is the process, errors and background info:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the MacBook, Go menu > Connect to Server > Server Address:  smb://megaman/c$ > Connect\n\n*Connect as: Registered User > Name: Zach; Password: my password  [This is an admin account on the Windows 8 PC]\n\n*\"There was a problem connecting to the server \"megaman\". You do not have permission to access this server.\n\n\nOk, fine....So as a sanity check, I make sure the administrative share (c$) exists on the Windows8 PC, and that the 'Zach' account is a member of the Administrators group. That all checks out. Next, I create a new share of the 'c' drive on the Windows 8 PC and in the share settings, only give the user account 'Zach' Full permissions. \nI run back through steps 1-3, but this time I just enter 'smb://megaman' for the server address. I get the 'Select the volumes you want to mount on \"megaman\"' dialog box on the MacBook and 'c' is listed as a share. I select 'c' and click OK. The share mounts without error.\nI've also tried mounting the c$ share via command line and get a \"Permission denied\" error. I've tried disabling the firewall, but this doesn't make any difference. I've tried deleting and recreating the administrative share, and also creating a new admin account on the Windows 8 PC, but none of those make any difference either.\nPerhaps it's a setting in local security policy on the Windows 8 PC? I can't say for sure, but my guess is that this issue began with Windows 8, since I used to be able to access the c$ share when my PC ran Windows 7.\n\nA: Administrative shares have been disabled in Windows Vista and later versions of Windows for security reasons.\nAccording to Microsoft Support Knowledge Base article 947232, you can do one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create your own shares with the appropriate permissions (recommended);\n\n*Run the Microsoft Fix It to perform an automatic workaround; or\n\n*Add to the Registry subkey HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System a DWORD (32-bit) Value LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy entry with the value data of 1.\n", "Q: Set preview.app to default to \"content only\" view Is there any way to make (Mountain Lion) Preview's default view 'content only'?\n\nA: I was looking for something that would seem to be the opposite of what you wanted (i.e. to have all PDFs open and show the \"Thumbnails\" of each page, as is an option in the \"View\" menu. \nAs such, I found, on the Apple Support community the following: \nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4582012\nIt would seem you have to go to Preferences> PDF> un-tick the \"Always Show Sidebar\" option beside \"Opening for the first time\" option. \nHope that helps a bit!

Is there a preference somewhere to change that to display all artists, i.e. including those that only appear on a compilation?\n\nA: You can't do that in Artists view. The only way to do that is to show the Column Browser (View > Column Browser > Show Column Browser, or Command-B). Unfortunately, in iTunes 11, the column browser is only available in Songs view, or when you're viewing a playlist. But it will show all the artists, even those in compilations, as long as you choose View > Column Browser and uncheck Group Compilations.\niTunes 10 was much better for using the Column Browser, alas.\n", "Q: Inconsistent results when getting folder size in AppleScript I'm using this line to get the size of a folder:\nset thesize to physical size of folder x\n\nThe problem is that sometimes it works, other times it doesn't, and it's very annoying because there doesn't seem to be any kind of logic to it. The same folder path can return \"missing value\" at first, then return the number of bytes later, without any code change. It seems to start working more often after I \"Get Info\" on the folder in the Finder, but even that doesn't always work.\nHow do you make this reliable? I can't send my application to other people with this kind of unpredictability on my own computer.\n\nA: Try Automator. I did it and it worked for me on each folder.  I tried it as a Service.\nI might have automator actions that you don't have. \nYou can get them here if that's the case: \nhttp://www.automatedworkflows.com\nThere you will find awesome automator action packs. Very useful. \nPhil\n\nA: As you precisely describe, this is happening because it takes time to gather that information. If the operation times out before the system calculates the size, you'll get the error.\nWhen you use \"Get Info\" beforehand it caches the result.\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem and solved it by getting size of all the files inside the folder:\nset theSize to 0\nset fileList to every item of folder x\nrepeat with theFile in fileList\n    set theSize to theSize + (get size of theFile)\nend repeat\n\nSometimes it results slightly different to what is shown in the folder properties but in general it's much better than size of folder x.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut for jumping directly to a specific input method I'm leaning Japanese, and so I have my Mac set up for three different input methods: English, and two different Japanese character sets. I can change between the three input methods using ctrl-alt-option-space. \nHowever, because there are three input methods I have to press this key combination a different number of times depending on what the current state is. For example, if I want to switch back to English then I have to press it twice if it's currently set to hiragana, but only once if it's set to katakana. Because of this, I keep pressing it the wrong number of times, which results in typing unwanted characters and then having to cycle back through the three input methods to get to the one I want.\nSo instead of using one key combination to cycle through the three input methods, I'd like to set up a specific key press for each one. For example, I'd like to set up something like ctrl-alt-command-E that always switches back to English, no matter what the current input method is, so that I can always get to where I want to be without worrying about where I am. But I can't seem to find a way to do this.

Yesterday I showed my grandparents an iPad mini for the first time, and because the orientation wasn't right, they shook it violently a few times hoping that it'd orient it correctly again. I may be a bit paranoid, but is that going to damage its orientation hardware? What does the iPad orientation hardware look like?\n\nA: The iPad Mini's accelerometer is a solid-state (with a microscopic mechanical - thanks Graham Parks for the correction) device so shaking should not hurt it. Electric shocks (for e.g. immersing iPad in water while it's on) and heat do damage electronics.\nYou're more likely to break the adhesive that connects the gorilla glass to the aluminium back before hurting the accelerometer.\n\nA: Short answer: maybe. If you shake anything vigorous, yes, it will break. Will the actual accelerometer break? Probably not. You would have a connection come loose far before that happened, but that would stop it from working. \nHere's the iPad teardown: http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPad+Wi-Fi+Teardown/2183/2\nTell them to have some patience and all will be okay. Also consider this: your iPad accelerometer will work much better if you are holding the iPad perpendicular to the ground (up and down versus parallel to the ground.) With that, the accelerometer should do exactly what they want.\n", "Q: What is the iPhone SMS database called in iOS 6?

I don't get drops, but I get 5 Mbps speeds literally 5 feet from the router when I used to get in the 70s.  My iphone 5S, sitting next to the rMBP, is able to get 70Mbps. Even more confounding is that if I change the router to support only 802.11g, the speeds are at 54Mbps.\nWhat I learned is that \"MCS Index\" value is significant--it communicates from the Access Point to the clients what coding schemes are in use.  There is a standard table defined by 802.11n, and you can view it here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11n-2009\nIn your case--and in mine--an MCS Index value of zero shows up.  According to the table at the link above, that means the maximum rate available should be 6.5-7.5 Mbps. However, in your output, it claims you're getting 54Mbps, which seems wrong.\nSo, why am I answering?  Because in both cases, the evidence suggests that Apple's driver or the chipset is doing the wrong thing with the MCS Index value.  In my case, I sniffed wireless lan traffic and confirmed using wireshark that the AP is announcing itself with an MCS Index value of \"7\" (conforming to what I actually set in the configuration for the AP). Yet, my rMBP insists that it's a zero and sets the speed accordingly.  In your case, it appears to be recognizing the MCS Index value as zero but setting the speed incorrectly.\nIn short, I'm not sure that reinstalling your will actually change anything for you.\n", "Q: \"Cannot execute binary file\" with alias of binary I have installed both python3.3 and python2.6. \nI have set python3.3 to default by creating an alias named \"python\" in usr/bin and another one for python2.6 named \"python2.6\".\nNow if I type in the terminal \"python\" python3.3 will be open but if I type \"python2.6\" I get \"cannot execute binary file\". \nI can launch the binary directly but not through the alias.\nI have checked the permissions and are the same for both binaries and aliases so I don't know what to do.\nCan someone help me?\n\nA: Instead of using Finder aliases, use Terminal to create symbolic links (see man ln for details on usage):\nln -s /path/to/python3.3/binary /usr/local/bin/python\nln -s /path/to/python2.6/binary /usr/local/bin/python2.6\n\nIt's usually not a good idea to mess with /usr/bin content (will be wiped out with the next upgrade).

From the command line we can copy things to and from the different clipboards. In Terminal.app, you can read all about the pbcopy and pbpaste commands with man pbcopy and man pbpaste\nIn short, when invoking the Find command in most applications, the text you insert in the Find field automatically gets placed into the Find clipboard. That is why when invoking the Find command in a different application, the Find field is automatically inserted from what is currently in your Find clipboard.\nPaste this following AppleScript code into a new Script Editor.app document.  Running the code will display a dialogue giving you the option to choose which of the four clipboards' text or rtf contents you would like to view\nproperty theClipboards : {\"general\", \"find\", \"font\", \"ruler\"}\n\nactivate\nset chosenClipboard to item 1 of (choose from list theClipboards ¬\n    with title \"Choose A Clipboard\" with prompt ¬\n    \"Choose a clipboard to view its contents.\" OK button name ¬\n    \"View Chosen Clipboard\" cancel button name \"Cancel\")\n\nset theResult to displayClipboard(chosenClipboard)\n\nactivate\ndisplay dialog theResult buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1 ¬\n    with title (\"Contents of Pasteboard \" & chosenClipboard) --giving up after 5\n\nto displayClipboard(chosenClipboard)\n    set theResult to (do shell script \"pbpaste  -pboard \" & chosenClipboard)\nend displayClipboard\n\n\n\nRunning this following command in Terminal will clear out the contents of the Find clipboard. echo \"\" |pbcopy -pboard find\n\nPossible work-around/solution:\nYou can create a new Automator Quick Action and add a Run Shell Script command to the workflow and add this following code to the Run Shell Script command.\necho \"\" |pbcopy -pboard find ;osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"f\" using {command down}'\n\nSave your new Automator Quick Action then in System Preferences, assign a keyboard shortcut to the new Automator Quick Action.  (I assigned ⌃F to the new keyboard shortcut.)\n\nNow instead of invoking Find with ⌘F, the new ⌃F shortcut will clear the contents of the Find clipboard then opens the Find search field with nothing already in there from any previous searches.\nIt's not a perfect solution but it may help.\n", "Q: Suppressing \"reopen windows\" dialog when restarting a crashed program in Mountain Lion Is there any way of suppressing the alert dialog that pops up when restarting a crashed program in Mountain Lion (10.8.2)?

Are there Apple guidelines for where user shell tools in Mountain Lion should be installed? Some (e.g. TeX, or Apple's Git) end up in /usr, and others (e.g. X11) seem to end up in /opt (sometimes with a symlink from /usr), while others (e.g., Git) end up in /user/local, and I wonder what the difference is, and whether one is preferred over the other.\n\nA: The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard is followed in Linux and other Unix based OSes, and OS X follows this too, to a large extent. The /private folder is where basically your OS X core resides and the /etc and /var folders are merely symbolic pointers to /private/etc and /private/var respectively. You can verify this by using readlink as readlink /etc.\nThe /opt folder is for additional user applications and so is /usr/local, and you can choose to install to either one of them. It really doesn't matter (as long as you take care of adding to your paths appropriately) and the main intent is to keep it insulated from operating system upgrades (which will overwrite stuff in, say, /bin). \nOftentimes, the following \"loose convention\" is adopted:\n\n\n*\n\n*if the package/application follows unix standards, then install it to /usr/local/. There will be no surprises in the package and you can definitely expect a sub-directory structure like bin, etc, include, share, and so on. \n\n*if the software comes packaged as a standalone application in which the sub-directory structure is arbitrary, you simply install it to /opt. On my machine, I have my VPN, cisco installed in /opt and it has the following directories: anyconnect,  hostscan,  vpn. None of these are unix compliant folders and installing it to /usr/local would not be a good idea.\nThey both have their \"advantages\" and \"disadvantages\", depending on how you view it and what your familiarity with unix is. \n\n\n*\n\n*Installing to /usr/local is \"convenient\" in that if you simply add /usr/local/bin to your path, everything else is set and you don't need to modify anything if you add a new application. On the other hand, if you need to remove something, it's a pain because all programs are clumped together and you don't remember which binaries were installed for application X and which ones for application Y.\n\n*Installing to /opt/programX will require you to manually add it to the path and perhaps setup symlinks, but removing an application is convenient, because you simply need to remove the folder and you're done.\n", "Q: Speakable items always activated after reboot 13\" MBP running on OSX 10.8.2:\nProblem is that after reboot Speakable items is always on.

All I want is to get some benefits from the fact that I'm connecting to remote 13' MacBook using 27' iMac. \nAs far as I understand, neither default MacOS VNC server nor Vine VNS does not provide a possibility to set the geometry. \nThe closest thing related to the issue I've succeeded to find so far is this discussion. So, I guess, the question can be boiled down to how can I change the resolution of the screen (and, to be honest, I believe that such thing should be done for free in a decent OS :).\nOf course, more elegant rather than hacks with switching current resolution \nsolutions will be favored. \n\nA: I had a similar issue years ago using VNC with an ancient Power Mac 7100.  The 7100 was headless and the video defaulted to 800 x 600.\nI discovered that the VNC server doesn't care what the resolution is but that it is limited to resolutions that the remote machine will support.\nIn my case, after connecting the remote 7100, I then using the Displays Control Panel to crank the display to the highest resolution the remote machine could handle.  The VNC screen then changed to match the new remote resolution.\nUnfortunately, this means you can only use the maximum resolution that the remote machine's hardware will support.\n", "Q: What does XProtect protect/secure on Mac OS X? My research so far has found XProtect appears at first glance to be a basic AV engine that scans DMG & apps through Safari, Chrome and Firefox. I'm looking to understand what does it actually do and what does it exactly monitor outside of DMG and apps? I've read it doesn't provide protection from BitTorrent and removable USB thumb drives. What else?\n\nA: The Xprotect \"system\" is not really an AV engine as such. It looks for a very limited number of text strings, or \"signatures,\" in specific types of files. For this reason, it is far less useful than a real AV program (up to you if you think one is necessary). In addition, it only checks files downloaded with certain apps: Safari, Mail, Messages, and third-party apps that have activated a setting to use Xprotect to check their files as well. Also, it only sets a flag on files, and depends on user interaction for protection. So an un-savvy user may see the dialog warning that a file is dangerous, but still click the necessary button to open it. \nAs you say, it doesn't protect against BitTorrent downloads (though specific BitTorrent clients could use the feature), and doesn't protect from files copied from any kind of removable media or files copied over a network. \n\nA: This is Apple's explanation:\n\nAbout the \"Are you sure you want to open it?\" alert (File Quarantine / Known Malware Detection) in OS X\nOS X improves download validation by providing file quarantine in applications that download files from the Internet. This means that\n  downloads are checked for safety (known malware) when you try to open\n  them.\nFile Quarantine\nFile quarantine-aware applications that download files from the\n  Internet, or receive files from external sources (such as email\n  attachments), attach quarantine attributes. \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Quarantine-aware applications include Safari, Messages, iChat and    Mail.\n  \n*These attributes include date, time, and a record of where the file    was downloaded from.\n  \n  \n  When you open a file received through a quarantine-aware application,\n  OS X warns you where the file came from. You receive an alert asking,\n  \"Are you sure you want to open it?\" You should click Cancel if you\n  have any doubts about its safety.\n\nIf you have multiple user accounts on your Mac, the user account that\n  downloaded the file is the only user account that can remove the\n  quarantine attribute on a file. All other user accounts can open a\n  quarantined file, but they are still presented with an alert asking\n  \"Are you sure you want to open it?\" every time they open the file.\nKnown malware check\nMac OS X Snow Leopard v10.6 and later also check for known instances\n  of \"malware\", or malicious software. When you open a quarantined\n  file, OS X checks to see if it includes known malware. If so, an alert\n  message similar to the following appears:\nIf you see \"(file name) will damage your computer.\" You should click\n  Move to Trash.\n\nIf the file is a disk image, you should click Eject Disk Image and\n  then delete the source file.\n\nTip: Click the Help icon in the lower left corner of the alert message\n  for more information about malware.\nBlocking web plug-ins\nTo help limit exposure to potential \"zero day\" exploits from web\n  plug-in enabled content, OS X also blocks specific versions of web\n  plug-ins from functioning – including Java web apps, or Adobe Flash\n  content. Typically an update to the web plug-in is available on the\n  same day, or shortly after OS X blocks the web plug-in. Install the\n  new update to restore web plug-in function.\nGatekeeper\nOS X Lion v10.7.5 and later include Gatekeeper, a technology that\n  allows developers to sign applications. Signed applications normally\n  don't present an alert when you download and open them. Internet files\n  downloaded from other applications get file quarantine attributes but\n  without date, time, and link of the file downloaded.\nAdvanced users only\nYou can toggle the ability of File Quarantine to receive updates from\n  Apple about malware and web plug-ins.\nImportant: Deselecting this option disables the ability to identify\n  new malware, and leaves your Mac vulnerable to new malware without\n  notification.\n\nSource: About the \"Are you sure you want to open it?\" alert (File Quarantine / Known Malware Detection) in OS X\n", "Q: IPhone 5 Alarm sound question When you turn your ringer down during the day, so it only vibrates when someone calls, this also turns down your alarm. Is there a way to keep your alarm volume constant when you turn down your ringer?\n\nA: Yes and no. The iPhone has a reasonably sophisticated, system-level, sound setup with the goal of making it easy for the user. It has several volume options divided up. (1) all alerts such as ringtones and Alarm.app alarms, (2) Siri, (3) content playback such as music or video.\nYes: What you can do to directly fix your problem is to use the vibrate/silence switch on the side of the phone instead of turning the ringer volume down. In the on position (orange is showing, a vibration is felt when the switch is initially turned on), phone calls, texts, and such will vibrate, but the alarm will still play at whatever the ringer volume was set to before turning the vibrate switch on.\nOne other thing you could do is leave the volume switch on and purchase, or create, a silent ringer - no music in it. Then you can select that ringer as your default ringer and calls will be \"silenced\". This method is generally not preferred because custom contact ringers will override this ringer.\nNo: The vibrate switch is actually the only way to separate the ringer volume from the alarm volume. If the vibrate switch is off (calls are heard), then the alarm volume will match the ringer volume. \n\nA: Settings - Sounds - under Ringer and Alerts, turn OFF \"Change with Buttons\"\nThis will make the alarm once again independent of the the silent button/volume keys.\n", "Q: unusual disk activity i am new in the apple world.

I have been experiencing a pretty severe problem that I am convinced is software related, but I could use some assistance in finding the best way to track it down.\nThe problem is this: any time I leave the computer unattended for any length of time (ranging from minutes to hours), I come back to it and there is about an 80% chance that the system will have hung. I can move the mouse, but the cursor is the spinning beach ball and I can't click on anything, interact with anything, or type anything. The only way to get the computer out of this state, consistently, is to hold the power button and force a restart.\nI've narrowed this problem down with some certainty to being related to my Seagate GoFlex Desk 3 TB external hard drive. Strangely, this drive required a driver to be installed from Seagate before it would show up connected via the attached Thunderbolt dock. There's a post here on Seagate's website that addresses some similar concerns with a similar drive. I did install that driver, which seemed to make the issue much worse, but I swear this issue may have been there before all this (I can't remember with certainty).\n\n\n*\n\n*If I disconnect the drive entirely, the problem goes away.\n\n*If I boot the system into Safe Mode (with Shift held down), the problem also goes away.\n\n\nNow, I've diligently gone through and removed everything I could find that was installed along with this driver. I opened up the installer and went to Show Files and removed everything it installed. I even searched my /Library and /System folders for anything with \"Seagate\" in the name, and killed all of it. But the problem still remains.\nBooting into Safe Mode and having the problem go away tells me there is a software component here that is causing this mayhem. What I would like to ask for assistance with is how best to try and hunt down the driver, or kext, or application, or whatever it might be that is causing the system to hang like this.\nI'm probably going to end up replacing this drive anyway, because this is just ridiculous, but in the meantime, it hosts a lot of important data and I'd really like to get my system working again with the drive by disabling whatever is so consistently causing it to hang.\nThanks so much for any help!\n\nA: Here is a method to hunt the kext which may cause you a hang system.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot in safe mode &\nmake a capture of the minimal safe set of extenions loaded with:\nmkdir ~/tmp\nkextstat >~/tmp/safe.kextstat\n\n\n*Boot in normal mode &\nmake a capture of the full set of extensions loaded with:\nkextstat >~/tmp/full.kextstat\n\n\n*Compare them:\ncd ~/tmp\ndiff full.kextstat safe.kextstat\n\nand from this difference, which is including the faulty kext,\nextract the culprit by checking its installation date:\nls -dlT /System/Library/Extensions/<extension_folder_name…>\n\nThe faulty extension will be the one installed at the time of the\nstart of your kernel hang.\nBeware: the extension_folder_name… is not the extension name as\ndisplayed by kexstat.\nHere is an example:\non_my_mac$ kextstat | egrep 'Addr|ThunderboltDPA'\nIndex Refs Address            Size       Wired      Name (Version) <Linked Against>\n   70    4 0xffffff7f8125e000 0x8000     0x8000     com.apple.driver.AppleThunderboltDPAdapterFamily (1.8.2) <45 9 8 5 4 3>\non_my_mac$\n\nis coming from:\non_my_mac$ cd /System/Library/Extensions\non_my_mac$ ls -dlT AppleThunderboltDPAdapters.kext\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root  wheel  102 Aug 31 05:39:06 2011 AppleThunderboltDPAdapters.kext\non_my_mac$\n\n\n*Make a backup copy of the suspected extension:\nmkdir ~/Extensions_backup\ncd /System/Library/Extensions\n/usr/bin/sudo mv faulty_extension_folder_name ~/Extensions_backup\n\nand test this system with one missing kernel extension:\nreboot\n\n\n*If it is OK.

In that case it would bring that window to the front which was no problem. But now if I have no windows open, and I click on the Finder icon, no new window opens. I have to hit Command-N if I want a new window.\nWhich setting do I have to change, so that Finder will open a new window if there is not already a window open?\n\nA: What about when creating a new user?  Does that work over there or has it the same behavior?\nIf it DOES work on the new user, I would try this is in order inside the problem account:\nIt is (hopefully) unnecessary to mention that you want to create a backup of your machine first before trying the following steps, but I still felt the urge to do so.\n\n\n*\n\n*flush all cache files (~/Library/Caches/*.*)\n\n*\n\n*in Finder, open menu \"Go\", press down \"Alt\" and while holding click on \"Library\"\n\n*navigate INTO the Caches folder and select every object you can find and remove them\n\n*reboot the computer (logging in and out possibly does the same trick, but I want to be sure)\n\n*empty the Trash at your leisure once logged back in\n\n\n*check ~/Library/Saved Application States to see if there is a folder com.apple.Finder and dump it (if there is not, less work for you)\n\n*This is more of a blunt measure, but I think still worth trying: create a folder on the Desktop, move all preference files in there and then test AFTER you logged out and back in.  If it resumed working, try again with more and more preferences put back until either all are back in or the problem re-occurs.  Occasionally, you may want to log out and back in as well to see if, after placing a file back, the behavior starts again.  If removing all preferences does not bring the behavior back to normal, just move all back in overwriting every newly created one.\n\n\nUntil their respective preference files are back in, I would recommend not to open those applications (especially Mail) as this may have side-effects on your applications' settings and sometimes content becoming inaccessible (or more difficult to reach/get back).\nThe reasoning behind number 3 is that some preferences may not be viewed as the obvious origin, but still may have caused that.  Removing them all and then putting them back one-by-one (or 5 at a time) makes sure that you can identify which file this has actually caused.\nIn the event that a newly created user has the same behavior (only then), you can try to install the latest combo update or re-install Mac OS X (no erase, just installing over the existing installation) to repair/re-add corrupted/missing files.\n\nA: This could well be down to bad prefs, for either Finder or the Dock.\nTry running the following in Terminal and then testing the Finder icon again:\nmv ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist.BAK\nkillall Finder\nmv ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist.BAK\nkillall Dock\n\nIf that doesn't work, you can restore your old prefs with the following:\nmv ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist.BAK ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist\nkillall Finder\nmv ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist.BAK ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist\nkillall Dock\n\n\nA: I ran the first line of code you shared\nmv ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist.BAK\nkillall Finder\nand I managed to get my Finder window to work again.\n\nA: just click on force quit and relaunch it it will open in usual way.\n", "Q: How do I refresh a \"Lion\" iMac to run \"Mountain Lion\" (factory install, wipe drive) What is the easiest way to upgrade a 2011 iMac to Mountain Lion, including a full drive reformat? \nI also have a new MacBook which was purchased with Mountain Lion.

I have a ton of music in my iTunes that is also on my iPhone.  I want to take my kids' music off my iPhone and put it on another device (a nano) that my kids will use.  My kids are young, so they can't have their own iTunes account.  I want to have just one iTunes account, but have different \"libraries\" to use on different devices.  I have figured out how to create a new library, but I can't figure out how to move music from one library to another on the same computer (e.g. how to get my kids' music from the library I have now with ALL my music to the library with music just for them).  Again, I want to use the same computer and the same iTunes account.  Thanks so much for your help. \n\nA: The easiest way is to create a folder, say on the Desktop, then open that folder. In iTunes, create a playlist, and add all the music you want there. Select all these items, then drag them to the window you opened for the folder on the Desktop; the Finder will copy the music files. Next, quit iTunes, launch it and choose the second library, and add the files by dragging them onto the iTunes window. You can then go back and delete the files in the original library, if you want.\n\nA: I see two options to solve your problem:\nSync all devices against same iTunes library\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up different playlists inside iTunes for different interests\n\n*Restrict Music syncing to specific playlists for the individual iDevices\n\n\nSet up individual computer accounts (with its own iTunes library each)\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new computer account for the kids\n\n*From your iTunes copy all tracks for the kids into the kids' Drop Box folder \n\n*Switch to kids account, start iTunes and import tracks from Drop Box folder (delete them there afterwards to avoid wasting disk space)\n\n*Use your computer account to sync your devices, the kids' for theirs\n\n", "Q: Possible to move the cursor word-by-word with Cmd+left/right instead of Alt+left/right?

I have iTunes 11.0.1 running on Mac OS 10.8.2 with quite a large music library, some podcasts and my iPhone connected. According to Activity Monitor, the iTunes process is taking 1.6 GB real memory, and 4.26 GB virtual. How can this be? Of 16 GB in my machine, I have 60MB free. Is it automatically grabbing all free memory? \nDoes anyone know any tricks for reducing this and/or making iTunes less greedy?\n\nA: If your iTunes is using this much memory, something is wrong.\nJust how large your library is?

From my knowledge, 4G SIM cards are automatic and refresh every 30 seconds. I proceeded to transfer the card from old to new.\nThis DID NOT WORK and after talking with Verizon, they said they do not support an unlocked iPhone 5; yet, the Apple store told me I could use this phone perfectly fine with Verizon. Conflicting information much?\nI'm not sure where else to ask this question because I feel like I should be able to activate the phone myself from what I've read, but it still is not activating. I don't really want to deal with Verizon or Apple at this point because of the conflict.\nCan I use this phone? If so, what am I doing wrong? Or do I need to return it to Apple and get the right phone?\n\nA: From the Apple web site:\n\nThe unlocked iPhone includes all the features of iPhone but without a wireless contract commitment. You can activate and use iPhone on the supported GSM wireless network of your choice, such as AT&T in the United States. The unlocked iPhone 4, iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 will not work with CDMA-based carriers such as Verizon Wireless or Sprint.\n\nSo the genius led you astray.\n", "Q: Mac os x ipfw forward from ip:port to ip:port I want when on my local machine redirect from 192.168.64.88 port 80 to localhost port 9790.

I realize that on this site there's a way to link with a URL, but on sites like Facebook and Google+ there is no option for that. :) Don't address this issue, that's not my question :) Thanks!\n\nA: As it is today, there is no way you can do this through the Finder file upload dialog. I also can't find any Chrome Extensions that can do this, but making one shouldn't be too hard.

I have an application available to all comers on the App Store and I would like to restrict access to the application. The app is free and because of this, some people download it then find they can't use it and leave bad feedback. Although the description clearly says you need to be an existing customer obviously not everyone is reading it and the bad comments put off our actual clients.\nI've looked into the Enterprise account but from what I understand you can only distribute to in-house staff. These are our clients so do not fall under this category.\nCan Apple's code signing requirements used to allow select customers to see certain apps?\n\nA: Solving this problem could go down three routes (and I'll initially answer it generally to be of most use to everyone reading this):\n\n\n*\n\n*Using a development license and signing apps for a limited pool if iOS devices (currently, you get only 100 test slots as any iOS developer). This avoids the App Store entirely\n\n*Setting up an enterprise account with Apple so that that entity could sign apps for effectively an unlimited amount of devices. You would then let the company that has the enterprise account sign the apps for the devices it wants to run them and pull or modify the app from the public App Store.\n\n*Have the developer and the clients sign up for the Volume Purchase Program from Apple. This puts the app on the App Store, but the developer can control whether all VPP buyers can see the app or only white list certain clients to purchase.\n\n\nFrom an experience standpoint, option 3 is far superior for most situations. Abusing the developer program to distribute apps commercially is against the terms of service, and there are technical issues and undue hassle with implementing that potential around the code signing barrier.\nRemoving the app and only selling to clients might work for your case - using option 2. Only the clients need to sign up, but you get total control about issuing fixes, builds and there is no delay (or benefit) to submitting the app to Apple for review. It doesn't mean you couldn't still submit the same build and price it high enough that people don't buy it, but then refund those customers when they are done evaluating your app, want to get a direct build they can sign.\nThe last option means you, the developer, need to list your app under VPP (which hides that app from most users of the App Store) and your clients also need to enroll in VPP, but this is Apple's solution to the dilemma you find yourself in.\n\n\n*\n\n*The client gets access to special pricing, special access and still has Apple reviewing apps and providing the store front, code signing, etc...\n\n*The seller gets access to special pricing, explicit permission from Apple to sign related contracts directly with the clients to stipulate anything you wish (minimum purchase, pricing, availability, custom design) - but they only review the apps - Apple doesn't arbitrate, facilitate or handle agreements or disputes between the seller and the buyer.\n\n*The seller can price the app differently for each client or use the same pricing for all.\n\n\nBoth parties need to have a company and jump through some filing paperwork to enter VPP, but it's really the optimal solution for most cases where you don't want to price your app for free on the public store.\n\nA: Give your users an account for the app (maybe you already have it).

It never was before, but I just reinstalled by system and now its doing this.\nNote: I'm using Lion (10.7.5).\n\nA: You've answered your question by showing that whatever unknown dns resolving you are doing needs both IPv6 and IPv4 entries.\nSince OS X has API and a bit more directory services layered on top of the normal DNS system (i.e. it doesn't simply use /etc/hosts like many unix systems), even calls you think might simply check the hosts file for an IPv4 address can and will fail if they don't specify IPv4 only or are using Bonjour/ZeroConf to do address resolution.\n", "Q: iPhoto crashes at launch?

I've never had luck with externals working both Mac AND PC, so I'm a bit nervous about reformatting it right away. \n\nA: Sadly there is no one common format that works well for both Time Machine and any flavor of Windows.\nUnless you are interested in buying filesystem support software to make Windows on a PC work with HFS+ or make OS X on a Mac work with NTFS, the best solution is to partition the drive into two sections.\nI would select the GPT volume format (GUID Partition Table) and then make one part of the drive HFS+ for Time Machine and Mac only files. The other partition should be FAT/ExFAT so both the Mac and PC can read/write all files on that drive.\nOr you could just keep the entire drive HFS+ and turn on file sharing. The Mac will re-share the entire drive over SMB so the PC can read/write to files on the drive indirectly, but without needing to be exposed directly to the file system implementation details. This of course is a poor solution if you really want only one computer attached to the drive and need to shuttle the files or the systems are otherwise incapable of being networked and/or having the Mac run all the time when the PC needs to access files.\n", "Q: Is there a technical reason not to upgrade a MacBook's RAM past its listed maximum? According to this page, Macbooks are expandable to memories larger (and, in one case, faster) than those released by Apple. Search for \"expandable\" in that page to see the many cases.\nBut Apple is keen on bleeding edge technology and specs, which suggests that Apple has a technical reason (odd crashes?) for not offering the largest/fastest memory, not even as an option.\nWould you comment on the reliability of notebooks after performing these upgrades (i.e. have you experienced increased crashes / instability)?\n\nA: Most new Macs have memory that’s not packaged for mechanical installation. The exceptions to this are the MacPro and 27” iMac and Mac Mini with Intel CPU.\nIf your machine has end user replaceable RAM, anyone that is skilled at troubleshooting bad RAM shouldn't shy away from learning what they give up when they install third party RAM in their Mac.\nBasically, you give up having AppleCare or the Warranty cover that part and perhaps them diagnosing a problem they can't reproduce with factory RAM installed.\nAs you probably know, an intel designed (or influenced) chipset and logic board will often run with more memory than Apple will install in the factory, as an upgrade or even list as \"supported\" yet reputable memory vendors have been providing details on which machines will run reliably when loaded with high quality RAM that meets the technical requirements if not the marketing requirements from Apple.\nI would look to sites like RamJet or Crucial or OWC/MacSales that have covered aftermarket upgrades to Macs for years and have established a reputation for having good warranties and information on determining if a specific RAM configuration is expected to be reliable on a Mac.\nYou of course may run into issues and bugs where certain chips fail oddly or tuning isn't ideal, but the time you gain in having more RAM often outweighs the time / expense of doing some hardware support if you run into issues and want to swap back in the Apple factory RAM to ensure you're not to blame for any oddities or failures by pushing the line on RAM.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you're trying to say. Apple gladly charges whatever they want because they can and people will gladly pay them. It's a fairly straight forward concept.\nAs far as memory goes, there is nothing exotic about memory sold in a multiple of 2. It's actually incredibly standard. Why does Apple not put the most amount of RAM into one of their MacBook Pros then they can is like asking why any computer company doesn't use the best components possible at the time. There are a number of reasons which are not really worth getting into. \nAnd to finally answer your question yes. I've upgraded the memory in every MacBook I've ever owned.

To accomplish this, reboot your Mac into the recovery partition, holding down ⌘R when you see the Apple logo. Select Disk Utility from the menu, then in the First Aid tab click Repair Disk. This may take some time. Partitioning trouble is usually a file system or disk hardware problem; this will solve the former, and a trip to the Apple store is usually needed to address the latter. \n\nA: For me it crashed when accessing the USB drive.  I reformatted my USB as Mac OS extended via Disk Utility and was able to continue after that.  \n\nA: I just found a solution that might work for you... Unplug all the external devices that you might have (external disks, flash drives) and then start the bootcamp again.. I just did it and it worked fine for me!!! :)\n\nA: I remember having this issue as well when I tried using bootcamp.  I seem to remember that it was due to a fragmented drive that didn't have enough contiguous space to create the partition of the size I was requesting.  From memory, it was a bit of a pain and  I think I ended up partitioning the drive first, then reinstalling OS X on one partition and using Winclone to copy a windows machine directly to the other partition.  There may well be an easier method?\n\nA: put windows 7 or later version dvd and then you will be able to make partition with BC :)\n", "Q: How to easily delete duplicates from iTunes Over the years I've accumulated a fairly large iTunes library, with a number of duplicates (for instance, I have compilation CDs which have some songs I already had from the original CD, etc.).\nIs there a good script that would let me automatically delete all the duplicates?\nAnd no, I don't want the dysfunctional iTunes duplicate finder of which I am aware. To illustrate why not, check out this screenshot of two songs it thinks are duplicates (note the differences in length).\n\n\nA: If you hold down the option key, you get “Check Exact Duplicate Items.” \nThe songs above would not have matched had you used that option.  You’ll still need to do some manual parsing, but you probably want to do that anyway.    \n\nA: Dupin from Doug's Applescripts is an awesome duplicate finder. You can set what fields match and the selection of fields is extensive and it will run the deletion for you. Doug keeps this up to date with the latest changes whenever Apple updates iTunes.\nThis is not a free app, but it is pretty inexpensive at $15.\n\nA: I was once annoyed with duplicate songs in my iTunes library. Luckily I found a professional tool to delete them all at a time. Here you can follow the steps below to achieve it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Music Cleanup and run it on your computer. Click \"Start Scan\" and all music in your iTunes library will be loaded to the program.\n\n*Click \"Duplicated Songs\" and you will see all the repeated items. \n3.Then choose one song in the file tray and all files of the same song will show up in the right column.\n4.Check those you want to get rid of and click \"Clear Duplicate\". The duplicated item will then be cleared from your iTunes library or local music folder.To delete all duplicates at once, click \"Clear all Duplicate\".\n\nA: Dupin is great; there is also Dupin Lite, for (I think) $8. \nThe problem with the iTunes duplicate feature is that it searches only by tags, not by duration. So the OP's example is a classic example of where it fails. \n", "Q: Why does File:/// crash my app? Whenever I type File:/// into the URL bar in Chrome, into Text Edit, and more, it crashes the app. I found out about this after reading this blog post.\nHow can I avoid this crash and make it impossible for apps that get this string whether it's typed, pasted or arrives in a file, message or download?\n\nA: It's a bug in 10.8.1 and 10.8.2 only.\nThe workaround for this pesky bug is to disable two items in Language & Text Preference Pane in System Preferences on affected versions of Mountain Lion:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select (click) on Text in the middle towards the top of the window\n\n*deselect (uncheck) \"Correct spelling automatically\"\n\n*deselect (uncheck) \"Use symbol and text substitution\"\n\n\nCredit for this workaround goes to user shess on the open radar web site.\n\n\nA: bmike has the workaround, I'll provide the \"why\":\nAccording to this article from TheNextWeb, a feature called Data Detectors, which scans text for meaningful formats (dates, locations...) also looks for file URLs. It does this by looking for \"file://\", case-insensitive. However, later in the procedure, it asserts that the string should start with \"file://\" lowercase -- and when this is not the case, such as when there is a capital F, it throws an exception, which apparently (and extremely sloppily) brings down the whole application.\n", "Q: Brand New MacBook Pro Retina Glitches I noticed a lot of people have a similar problem like me. Strange glitches in some programs on some controls. They appear totally random. The image shows only one program. It also appears in Safari, iMessage, XCode, Ecliplse. I've absolutely no Idea what could be the reason. Also Apple support doesn't have an answer yet. They told me to observe the problem.\n\nIt's the new MacBook Pro Retina 16 GB RAM and 2,6 GHz Model. 1 Week old. Mountain Lion 10.8.2\nEdit\nSome People write that their issue came from a Ram upgrade. And the Ram clock speed was wrong. Here not possible, unopened Laptop.\nEdit 2\nStill observing the problem. Apple told me to use an other \"Admin\" account (They told me it's important to be an admin account) on the machine. No glitches yet. I'll update the question after some days using the second account.\n\nA: Did you migrate an account from an old machine? It doesn't look like a hardware problem, but it could be corrupt preferences. Bad video cards will corrupt the whole screen, not have it confined to a single window like your screen shot shows.\nTry moving the preferences for Messages.app from your ~/Library/Preferences folder to the desktop. You will have to re-configure messages, but you can always put your old prefs file back.  If that works then you probably have a corrupt Messages prefs file. Try that for each app to see if it helps.\n", "Q: Takes a long time for my macbook pro to wake from sleep Ever since I first started using my brand new Macbook pro (mountain lion, 10.8.2) it has taken a long time for it to wake up from sleep (several minutes). When I open the macbook it first shows a grayed out picture of the screen with a count at the bottom (as if the battery was run out, which it is not) then the picture gets clear and the count is done, but still I have to wait 1-2 minutes before I can move the mouse.  \nIt was the same with both 8 GB RAM and 4 GB RAM.\nWhat is wrong? \nThank you for your help\n\nA: The greyed out (and blurred) background with the progress bar indicates that your computer hibernated (as opposed to suspended) - meaning it dumps the memory state to disk, and when resuming needs to restore that memory state from disk to memory.\nTo check which sleep mode your computer is using run the following from a terminal:\npmset -g | grep hibernatemode\n\nIf it is 1, this would be the expected behavior. If it is 3, OS X is unable to resync the memory state from background tasks (such as time machine) and may fully restore the memory state from disk. If it is 0, the memory shouldn't have been dumped to disk during normal sleep which would indicate that it hibernated as a last resort before losing power.\n", "Q: Does working in Target Disk mode hurt hardware? I had asked a question on how to connect a MacBook Pro to an iMac such that the iMac gets control of everything and that I used RAM and CPU power of iMac instead of MacBookPro. Here is how I did it: \nUsign iMac as a Display for MacBook Pro\n\n1) Turn off both devices.\n2) Connect them with thunderbolt cable\n3) Turn on the MacBook Pro AND keep holding the \"T\" key on its keyboard. You will see it will go to a disk mode with the Thunderbolt icon showing on its screen.\n4) Turn on your iMac AND keep holding the option key on its keyboard. You will see it will show you some hard disks on the display. Pick the one that is for the MacBook Pro.\n\nDone! Now Nothing from iMac is running in the background, iMac's peripherals are working for MacBookPro AND EVEN better: you are using CPU Power and RAM of your iMac to run MacBookPro.\nMy question is: Does it hurt the hardware of any of the devices? If I connect them this way for like four hours? Or it is just meant to be a temporary connection method and shouldn't work with them like them as a solution?   \nMy scenario is that when I come home and take work laptop to home and still need to work, I wanted a bigger monitor so I thought, \"Oh well let's connect it to my personal iMac.\"\n\nA: That won't harm anything.  In Target Disk Mode, your MacBook Pro behaves like any external hard drive.  You're simply booting the iMac from the MacBook Pro's hard drive.  This is exactly the same as booting from a regular USB or FireWire hard drive.\nNote: When you do this, none of the hardware on your MacBook Pro other than the hard drive is in play.  The CPU, RAM, etc. are all powered off.  Other than the hard drive, you're still using your iMac.\n\nA: The times I used my macbook pro in TDM (Target Disk Mode), it got really hot, and the temperature increased as if I am encoding a video….\nI guess long durations of TDM might cause hardware failure due to heat issues.\nSo I recommend that you use an AC if you are in a hot place, choose a location for your mac to keep it as cool as possible, copy your data as quickly as you can, that's to shorten the duration as much as possible..\n", "Q: What is a good HFS+ NAS or network HDD I am wondering what would be a good, if any, NAS i can find with HFS+. My reason for wanting this is that I need the metainformation in the files to stay intact as I am dealing with a lot of OpenMeta tags.\nFor me this can be any NAS or \"external HDD with network connection\".\nThe question has been raised here (Which NAS for Mac users?) previously, but was not answered as to what drives do have HFS+.\n\nA: So, HFS+ is a closed, proprietary format. For linux to work with this format, it needs hfsprogs, which is a module that supports HFS+.\nMost NAS servers use linux-native formats, so if you want HFS+-based filesystems, there are a few ways.\na) Most NAS servers are built with Linux, and most of them have command line. You can load hfsprogs module and write a script to have the system mount your HFS+ formatted drives. In another word, customize the system.\nb) Roll your own server, a good Synology enclosure costs about the same price as an Mac mini, you can get an external hard drive and have it running as an server.\n\nA: Get any NAS, create and mount a NAS volume on your mac (I use afp with my Synology DS1511).  Then use disk utility to create and mount a disk image stored on the NAS which will be in HFS+ format by default.\nYes, it's an extra step but I think it will get you what you want, a mounted NAS hosted HFS+ volume.\nSidenote:  My Synology NAS is great but I have stayed with DSM 3.2, it works.  That and my NAS is not attached to the net at large.\n", "Q: Kernel panic in OS X 10.7.5 After my Mac goes into sleep mode and once I try to bring it back, it gives me error messages Kernel

my 2012 Macbook Air to Apple.

Now they're back - booked another appointment next week.\n\nA: Always first do the following two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*install the most recent Combo Update, in your case the 10.7.5 Combo Updater, then reboot: \n\n\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/DL1582\n\n\n*\n\n*do a Safe Boot\n\n\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1455\nIf you haven't done both of these first, then hold off asking questions to the list.\n", "Q: Any reason to turn off wifi when connected by cable to network on A/C power for MBPr Any reason to turn off wifi when connected by thunderbolt adapter to cat-5 1 gig ethernet cable to network on A/C power for MBPr? Does turning wifi off help with anything? Does keeping wifi on help anything?\n\nA: Turning Wi-Fi off ensures traffic isn't accidentally sent over Wi-Fi instead of Ethernet. You can set the network priority in System Preferences, but I've had OS X send traffic over Wi-Fi even though it should have been sent over Ethernet. That being said, if you don't particularly care which network your traffic goes over, there's no harm in leaving Wi-Fi on.\n", "Q: how do I leave myself a permanent note on my iphone? OK, this is an incredibly basic question, but I have looked far and wide and cannot find a simple answer anywhere.  I want to record some PERMANENT notes to myself on my IPhone, such as my office hours (which I can never remember), and my family's health insurance ID's.  How can I do this?  I want the least fancy way possible.  My wife is pretty tech-savvy, and the best thing she could think of was to take a photo of a piece of paper with my office hours and save it.  There has to be a better way.   \n\nA: There are probably hundreds of note taking, clipping saving, or even drawing apps that could handle the simple task of taking and saving a note \"permanently\". (Not sure what you mean by that — of course if the device has to be reset, it's not permanent. But you should be backing up your device anyway, and the files will be saved, so this clarification seems strange.)\nFor potentially sensitive information like health insurance IDs and credit cards etc, I would recommend 1Password. It has the added bonus, of course, of keeping your passwords and serial numbers easily at hand and synced across devices.\n", "Q: How can Growl trigger an shell script or AppleScript (NOT vice versa!) When a Growl notification gets issued I want to trigger an AppleScript. I had a look at the \"Actions\" in the Growl preferences, and you can trigger things like an email or a text-to-speech call, but not an arbitrate shell script  or AppleScript.\nAny idea how to do this? Does a Growl plugin for this exists? I searched the net for it, but could only find solutions for the other way around (i.e. issuing a notification from a script).\nMany thanks in advance!\n\nA: Growl 2.1 does support ScriptActions, but it doesn't seem to be documented anywhere but a google group thread. Below is a simple example from the thread.

Hello fellow programmers!\nI would like to save some applescript code as an application, so that when I open the application it will go to Google Chrome and answer an incoming call in Google Voice.\nI will have my gmail account already open in the chrome browser, so all that is needed is for the applescript application to tell google chrome to activate, then click in a particular area (where the button will appear) to accept the call.\nHow can I find out the coordinates of where I want the mouse to click?

I'm not using an apple keyboard and don't have a Left ⌘.  Can I change the \"Host Key\" to be the Right ⌘?  How?\n\nA: The GUI setting is under Preferences -> Input -> Virtual Machine:\n\n\nA: This sets the host key to the right command key (VirtualBox 4.3.10):\nVBoxManage setextradata global GUI/Input/HostKeyCombination 54\n\nThe command will accept any value, but VirtualBox will not start if you supply an invalid value.  55 is the standard left command key, 61 is the right alt key.  I found the values via educated guesses (aka \"playing around\").\n\nA: There is a bug that appeared in VirtualBox 4.3.8 (maybe earlier?) that prevents the Virtualbox “Host Key” from being changed. It got fixed in VirtualBox 4.3.14. If you are using a VirtualBox version that is affected by the bug, here is a workaround:\n\nAfter changing the host key, select some other configurable shortcut\n  (no need to change it), and then click OK.\n\n\nA: You could try adding this to private.xml in KeyRemap4MacBook:\n<autogen>--KeyToKey-- KeyCode::COMMAND_R, KeyCode::COMMAND_L</autogen>\n\nIt might not work if you don't have a physical keyboard with a left command though.\n", "Q: Is there a reason an older Macbook won't run Mountain Lion? I needed Mountain Lion because some of the newer software of Apple, such as Xcode, requires Mountain Lion, but besides the iMac 27 I have, sometimes I need to go on trips and need to bring a white Macbook that I bought near end of 2007.\nIt is indeed a very decent Core 2 Duo notebook (besides the screen dimming a little after so many years because it is not LED type), with an Intel graphics card that is capable of playing all videos and Flash games I tried, but wonder, this Macbook can't install Mountain Lion and so I need to buy either a new Macbook Air for about $1200 or a Macbook Pro for $1800 to $2200 (depending on whether it is Retina).  Is there a reason why Mountain Lion can't be installed on this notebook?  Since it is to run Xcode mainly, graphics card performance is not needed if that may be a reason -- or for other reasons?\n\nA: Apparently it has to do with 32-bit graphics cards drivers, as they do not support 64-bit EFI. \nWhile Mountain Lion is compatible with any Mac capable of running a 64-bit kernel, the kernel does not support loading 32-bit kernel extensions. So, since the early 64-bit Macs use 32-bit drivers, Mountain Lion won't load them.\nYou can find out if your computer has a 32-bit or 64-bit EFI by running the command: ioreg -l -p IODeviceTree | grep firmware-abi\nIt will return either <\"EFI64\"> or <\"EFI32\">.\n", "Q: Sending HTML mails (without a 3rd party app) I've been trying to send an html mail with images embedded.\nSame as you would do if you embedded items into your stationary folder in outlook.\nI don't want to use a 3rd party app...because i need to send this to a client and then they will forward to a whole bunch of people...so i can't send it via a 3rd party app because once you do, if you try forward it then all the images and formatting etc don't come with the mail.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: You can do this relatively simple from the command line.

My MacBook connects to this wireless network.\nI’m thinking of getting a PC and connecting it to the AirPort Extreme using an Ethernet cable (i.e. not wireless) so it gets an internet connection too.\nThen I would use said PC to host all my iTunes music, and I’d like to be able to stream from the iTunes library on the PC to any Apple device in the wireless network via iTunes Home Sharing. \nWould that be possible with the setup I described above? Or would the PC have to connect wirelessly (without the Ethernet cable) to be considered “part of the same network” by iTunes?\nTL;DR If I connect a PC to my AirPort Extreme using an Ethernet cable, will I be able to use iTunes Home Sharing to share music from the PC to a Mac in the wireless network created by the AirPort Extreme?\n\nA: Yes.\nI don't know how to explain, it's a network problem, and if you don't understand it, you'll need to check out some books. The easy way to say this is that they are all on the same LAN.\n", "Q: Reinstalling clean system on faulty hardware? Suggestions I have a faulty MBP 17' Late 2009.\nI can sell it for spares & repairs on ebay for quite a lot as I've found but it has a lot of sensitive data on it and I'd like to return it to a base system.\nThe problem is that there's a problem with the heatsync and it will switch off without warning if it gets too hot.\nWhat would be the safest method of doing clean install. I have no means of connecting the internal drive to another machine.\nThanks very much.\n\nA: If overheating is the problem I would try doing the clean install while having a fan blow cool air directly onto the computer into the vent openings. I may even remove the bottom covers to increase airflow.\nIf you are selling for parts, why not remove the hard drive and sell it drive-less, then take a hammer to the drive itself to protect your data.\n\nA: If the computer had sensitive information on it, you really should perform a secure erase, but in order to do that properly you need to start from something other than the disk you're about to erase. The easiest way to do this is to get an erasable USB flash drive (at least 1GB) as a recovery disk:\n\n\n*\n\n*Convert the flash drive to GPT partitioning: plug the flash drive in, then run Disk Utility, select the drive from the sidebar (be sure to select the main drive entry, not the volume listed under it), then select the Erase tab, select \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled) from the Format pop-up, and erase the drive. When it finishes, make sure the info at the bottom of the window lists \"Partition Map Scheme: GUID Partition Table\".\n\n*Download Apple's Recovery Disk Assistant, and use it to convert the flash drive to an external recovery disk.\n\n*Boot from the recovery disk: restart the Mac, and hold down the Option key. It'll display icons for all the bootable volumes it finds. There'll probably be an internal recovery volume as well as the external; you should be able to tell which is which by their icons. Double-click the external recovery disk to start from it.\n\n*Once recovery mode starts, run Disk Utility. Select the internal disk from the sidebar (again, the main disk entry, not the volume listed under it). Then select the Erase tab, then click Security Options. In the Secure Erase Options dialog, move the slider one tick to the right (it should say something like \"This option writes a single pass of zeroes over the entire disk\" under the slider). Dismiss the Security dialog, then click Erase to erase the disk.\nWriting zeroes over the entire disk will take a while. If the computer gets too hot and shuts down partway through you'll wind up with only some of the data erased; I don't know of a good way to continue from where it left off, so you may have to retry from step 3 (and maybe add cooling; see @Dave Nelson's answer).\n\n*After it finishes, quit Disk Utility and the use recovery mode's Reinstall option to install a clean copy of OS X.\n\nA: If you have another Mac, boot the laptop in Target Disk Mode. Running the disk alone shouldn't heat it up too much. Zero-fill the disk. Then, install a fresh OS.\n\nA: Since you're selling it for parts anyway, I'd just yank the hard drive and sell it without one. \n", "Q: iOS6 on iPod Touch (4) no Wi-FI LAN, when there is no Internet? I got a question of one of my customers: \nThey are experiencing problems when connecting a iPod to a WIFI LAN without Internet connection.\nBasically, the iPod connects, gets a IP from DHCP, but then it can't reach a local Intranet server (with Safari to http://172.16.2.n).\nWe can ping the iPod, but thats all. And, once we connect the LAN to the Internet, everything works again.\nI tried the same with my iPhone 4(v6), that seems to work fine. Also with IOS 5 it works (both without Internet connection). \nAnybody a clue?\nThanks.\n\nA: Well, I'll take a crack at this one. I see three possibilities: 1) the packets are not leaving the iPod; 2) the packets are being dropped somewhere along the path; 3) there is a DNS related issue.\nLets start with DNS.\nFrom the iPod try connecting to the Intranet server using the Intranet server's IP address instead of its name. If this works than either the DNS setting in the iPod's association to the WiFi network is incorrect or the search domain is incorrect. You can check this by going to Settings->WiFi->your_wifi_network_name. If these look incorrect, try to \"Forget this Network\" and then reconnect.\nIf you still have the problem then it gets a bit more tricky\nGo the App Store and get an nslookup app and a traceroute app for your iPod. Several are free and work fine. Make sure neither of the apps require a internet connection to work. Once you have the apps, open the nslookup app and enter the DNS name of your Intranet server (ex. www.myserver.local). It should return the internal IP address of the server (i.e. it should not return the internet reachable address (if it even has one)). If it does return the correct address then take that address and use it as the input for the traceroute app. The traceroute should tell you all the IP hops it takes to get to the Intranet server. If it gets so far and then stops without getting to the Intranet server's IP address then we have a network problem to troubleshoot. If it does then we have an Intranet server problem to troubleshoot. \nIf traceroute gets all the way to the Intranet server then turn on the detailed connection logging on the Intranet server. Then, from the iPod, try to connect to the Intranet server. Now, look at the log file on the Intranet server and see if you see the iPod IP trying to connect and if so, what error is generated. Troubleshoot the error.\nIf traceroute does not get the Intranet server then turn debug logging on the network devices that sit between the iPod and the Intranet server. The traffic is making it somewhere and then being dropped. Find where it is being dropped and troubleshoot why it is being dropped. \nNOTE: If traceroute never leaves the iPod and/or you do not see traffic on the first device that the iPod is connected to then the problem may be within the iPod itself. If that is the case then gulp do the normal iPod stuff like reset it/reload it/etc. (I hate it when someone tells me to do that!)\nI hope this was of some help to someone and that I didn't ask you to chase a red herring\n\nA: I've found the following apps helpful:  Fing & IP Network Scanner.  Both have free and pro versions.   Also, via Cydia, is Netatalk.  A true champion among iOS networking solutions.  Really, it's amazing.\n  \"Netatalk is a free, open-source implementation of AppleTalk for Unix systems. Installing this package will let you use standard Apple file sharing to connect to your iPhone.\"\n\nA: Do you have a VPN on the network? You may need a VPN app on the iOS device.

But I'm wondering whether it is also possible to configure a proxy for the mobile data connection.\n\nA: Yes, you can set a Global HTTP Proxy on iOS devices, which routes all network traffic, regardless of connection, through your proxy server.\nThe simplest way is to use Apple Configurator, available free on a Mac using the Mac App Store. You will need to enroll your device via USB cable into \"Supervised\" mode. This will wipe your device. After this you can install a profile with a Global HTTP Proxy setting included.\nIf you are doing this across an enterprise, many tools exist, such as AirWatch or Casper Suite.\nIf you don't have a Mac and don't want to pay any money, you can also custom write your own XML-based profile, although I think it's safe to say you're beyond my comfort-level in directing you here.\n\nA: Generate a mobileconfig using a tool such as hhttps://github.com/andris9/mobileconfig. Load the mobileconfig by opening it in the iOS mail client. Remove it from Device Configuration when you're finished testing.\nThis method neither requires a Mac OS X computer, nor a jailbroken iPhone.\n\nA: Not 100% sure about proxy but as a last resort, you can set up VPN for your iPhone which would also affect your 3G connection by going to Settings > General VPN > Add VPN Configuraion.\n", "Q: Apple 30\" display and iMac 27\" I have an iMac i7 27\" 2012 and I want to use it with my 30\" Apple display.\nI have tried Apple's Mini Display Port to Dual-Link DVI Adapter, but that did not work.

Recently (in the past month or 2) my Mac (2012 Macbook Pro 13 inch) will take at least a minute to 90 seconds to wake up from being asleep. It usually happens when it is asleep overnight and. When it's asleep for about 20 minutes to an hour, it only takes a few seconds to wake up (like I expect it to).\nWhen I first bought my Mac about 7 months ago, it would wake up really quickly, which makes me think that I changed a setting somewhere.\nWhat setting should I change to relieve this problem?\n\nA: *\n\n*As soon as it wakes up next time, examine the file /var/log/system.log (open a terminal and type less /var/log/system.log; Or open the Console app and find Files/system.log).\n\n*Scroll to the bottom (the most recent entries) and find the time at which you just woke the machine, scrolling up if necessary. The entries from there to the bottom should give a clue as to what was going on during the wake-up period.\n\n\nYou can also look through previous wake-ups the same way, to look at what was happening during the long delay.\n\nA: http://www.imore.com/how-speed-retina-macbook-pro-wake-sleep\n\nWhat is actually happening is that these new MacBook Pro’s (and recent MacBook Air’s) have a new powersaving mode which Apple calls standby. Standby mode kicks in after the laptop has been in normal sleep mode for about an hour. When that happens, the contents of RAM are written to the hard drive and the RAM is powered down to further extend battery life. In theory, the laptop will last up to 30 days in standby mode. The trade off is that, when waking up, it takes a long time to reload 16 GB of RAM from the hard drive (even with SSD).\n\nNow on wake it needs to reload the contents of memory. During this time you get no cursor in your login field.\nYou can extend the time before entering standby mode by following this tip:\nhttp://www.ewal.net/2012/09/09/slow-wake-for-macbook-pro-retina/\n\nA: Open a Terminal or xterm window, and enter the following command:\ngrep hibernate /var/log/kernel.log\n\nIf this command does display anything, this means that (as suggested Waren)\nyour MacBook Pro entered into hibernate mode.\nIn this case, MacOS X is restarted by\n\n\n*\n\n*copying back into memory /var/vm/sleepimage which does take\napproximately 20 s / Gbyte of main memory,\n\n*and then jumping back at the right code location within this recovered memory.\n\n\nYou can also know when your MacBook Pro went through this hibernate mode by issuing:\nls -lT /var/vm/sleepimage\n\nIf you want to avoid this slow awakening, just plug your MacBook Pro when you expect to let it sleep a long time (approximately more than 8 hours).\n", "Q: How to fix app store Mountain Lion download that stops at 45%?

My Mac is most definitely compatible and my colleagues on the same model/version of the machine I am using have downloaded and installed Mountain Lion without any issues.\nI have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Repaired permissions\n\n*Installed all the most recent Mac updates for Snow Leopard\n\n*Restarted the computer\n\n*Cleared my App Store cache\n\n\nNo error messages, just won't complete the download. I'm afraid if I call Apple for help they will charge me for a product I have paid for, but doesn't work.\nHow to completely download Mountain Lion from the app store?\n\nA: I spoke to the Apple Store, and it had to do with a faulty harddrive which came out in my model. I went through the Hard Drive Replacement Program, and all went well, with Mountain Lion installed.\n", "Q: How do you jailbreak your device on iOS 6? I am interested in jailbreaking an iOS 6 device that I have. Just recently I noticed that this looks like it is now possible.\nIs it possible an iOS 6.x.x device? Also, what devices is it possible to jailbreak at this point?\n\nA: Compatibility\nThankfully, this jailbreak is supported by all version of iOS 6, including iOS 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.2, and 6.1. It works on all devices that support iOS 6 and it won't magically make iOS 6 work on devices that can not upgrade to iOS 6. Some current devices that run iOS and are not compatible with this one jailbreak are the 3rd generation Apple TV and the 2nd generation Apple TV.\nEvasi0n modifies the OS for the following hardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 3GS\n\n*iPhone 4\n\n*iPhone 4S\n\n*iPhone 5\n\n*iPod Touch 4th Generation\n\n*iPod Touch 5th Generation\n\n*iPad 2\n\n*iPad (3rd Generation) with Retina display\n\n*iPad (4th Generation) with Retina display and Lightning connector\n\n*iPad Mini\n\n\nYou need a computer to run the jailbreak. As for those operating system requirements, Evasi0n is compatible with Windows (XP minimum), Mac OS X (10.5 minimum) and Linux (x86 / x86_64).\nSet Up\nFirst, I suggest updating your device to iOS 6.1, as it is the latest version of iOS, and the most secure. Now, apparently you can not update via Wifi. You must do it in iTunes. If you already updated wirelessly,  you can [SHIFT + Update] on Windows or [Option + Update] on Mac OS X, in iTunes.\nSome notes:\nAccording to the official Evasi0n ReadMe file you should also ensure that you backup your device before Jailbreaking, disable the passcode lock if enabled and ensure iTunes does not launch during the Jailbreaking process.\nBackup your device using iTunes (or iCloud) before using evasi0n. If something breaks, you’ll always be able to recover your data.\nThose who use backup passwords in iTunes must disable them for now. After doing so, iTunes makes a brand new backup. Please wait for that backup to complete before proceeding! Feel free to re-enable your backup password after jailbreaking.\nPlease disable the lock passcode of your iOS device before using evasi0n. It can cause issues.\nLaunch evasi0n, plug in your device, and click “Jailbreak”. Just sit back and observe its progress. Watch for any steps you may be asked to perform.\nAvoid all iOS and iTunes related tasks until evasi0n is complete.\nIf the process gets stuck somewhere, it’s safe to restart the program, reboot the device (if necessary by holding down Power and Home until it shuts down), and rerun the process.\n\nDetailed Walkthrough\n(From iJailbreak.com)\n\n\n*\n\n*The first thing you will need to do is download Eavsi0n for Windows, Mac OS X or Linux. Just head over to evasi0n.com for that.\n\n*With Evasi0n downloaded you will need to extract it. On Mac OS X you will find a .dmg file that upon being clicked you will be able to drag the files to your desktop, but one Windows you will have a .zip file that can be extracted by right clicking on it and then clicking the extract to folder option.\nAfter the Evasi0n Jailbreaking tool has been extracted find the Evasi0n app / .exe file. On Windows you will need to right click on it and then click the Run as administrator option. On Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion and above you will need to hold down the control button on your keyboard, click the Evasi0n app and then the Open option to get past Gatekeeper.\n\n*With Evasi0n up and running you will need to plug your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad into your computer via the USB cable (upon doing this Evasi0n should recognize your device). Before you proceed any further you will also need to ensure you disable your lockscreen passcode if you have one enabled. This can be done by launching the Settings app, going into the General tab, followed by Passcode Lock and then tapping Turn Passcode off.\n\n*With your lockscreen Passcode disabled, iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad plugged into your computer and iTunes closed you can click the Jailbreak button. The process will now begin and you should see the progress bar moving forward.\nSit back and do not touch your computer until Evasi0n tells you to unlock your device and search for a newly created icon by the name of Jailbreak.\nWhen you see this message simply follow its instructions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Unlock your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad\n\n*Find the newly created Jailbreak icon on your homescreen\n\n*Tap this icon ONCE, it will launch and quickly close itself. This is normal.\n\n\n*\n\n*You will then see the Evasi0n Jailbreaking tool start back up again and the progress bar should start moving. When the Jailbreak is complete you will see a “Done!” message displayed . This means the Jailbreak was successful! You will now just need to sit back until your iOS device automatically restarts, which might take a several tries.\n\n*When your device restarts it will display a white background with an Evasi0n logo. This is again part of the Jailbreaking process and you will see messages like Setting up Cydia, Clearing SpringBoard cache etc.\nOnce everything is finished being configured your device will be brought to the lockscreen. In which case you can unlock your device, find the Cydia icon on your SpringBoard and be on your way!\nYou should now have a Jailbroken iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. Congratulations! If you are experiencing troubles then my only suggestion would be to restart your computer, switch USB ports and try again. If you still don’t have any luck then a factory restore on iOS 6.1 may be necessary before reattempting. Also keep in mind that you cannot have a Passcode lock enabled.\nOnce you are Jailbroken you might be asking yourself, what now? Well, you will want to launch Cydia and install tweaks of course. Make sure you check out our Top Cydia tweaks and top Siri tweaks section to find some of the best tweaks available.\nCongrats:\nYou're done! Don't forget to install OpenSSH, as you might need it (In case of troubles). Instructions should be found on the Cydia Store. Have fun!\nNOTE: This originally came from my blogpost, http://infinite-josiah.blogspot.com/2013/02/how-to-jailbreak-your-ios-6-device.html\n", "Q: Backups using Mac Mini Server & Time Machine I'm currently trying to set up a fool-proof plan to secure backups of all of our files all the time.\nWhat I'm generally thinking is using our Mac Mini Server I can backup our files (3 - 6 iMac's worth) locally to the internal storage. I would also like to be able to use a Time Capsule attached to the Mac Mini Server to make a further copy of all the backups that I can then offline regularly.\nI would love direction and critique on this idea. We haven't set it up, so this might not even be possible. But I would love some direction.\nWill the above scenario work? If not, does anyone have suggestions?\nWe also have an Airport Extreme if that helps in any way..\n\nA: I'm not sure what you're exactly asking… but let's try.\nIf you have a Mac Mini Server and want to backup 3-6 machine's data, I'm assuming those machines save that data in the Mini's storage. (If not they should).\nThen You can use a combination (or all) of the following:\n1) The \"Data\" is stored on a mirrored drive (RAID-1 or more). For redundancy in case of hardware failure. Doesn't count as backup but counts as immediate hardware failure protection measure. Keep working even if the drive fails. \n2) The \"Data\" Drive is part of a Time Machine to an external drive(s) (those drives can also be mirrored for an extra layer of protection). If your time machine drive fails, you have the mirror to keep working until you're able to restore the offending hardware.\n3) A final, good idea, is to clone the drive (internal) into yet another external drive to have a copy-cat of the data in case everything goes to hell (You can use tools like SuperDuper or CarbonCopyCloner for that.\n4) If what you want is the minimum amount of downtime in case of hardware failure or total software failure, you might want to have backups of at least one of each of your Macs so you can boot from an external identical drive if one machine fails (while you reinstall the original). Assuming the data is never locally stored, of course. Otherwise, you'll need a TimeCapsule with a huge external storage to let each Mac backup over the air (or net) to the Time Capsule as well.\nThink of backups and redundancy as layers. The more you have, the more protected you are against external factors. \nAll this would be useless if you don't take your backups offsite…\n", "Q: How do I re-associate HTTP links with my browser in OS X? I installed iTerm2 the other day, and was playing around with it. In the process I seemed to have messed up the handling of HTTP hyperlinks on my system. Sometimes (annoyingly, not every time, which is very confusing - I can't spot a pattern) when I click an HTTP link in the Twitter app, MS Word, and so on, it opens a new iTerm2 terminal window or tab, and the webpage doesn't open. How can I get back to the original behavior and have the link open in the default web browser?\nI've already checked the iTerm2 preferences - under \"URL schemes\", no scheme is selected:\n\n\nA: Check the file associations for both HTTP & HTTPS, make sure both are set to Safari.\nA simple way to do this would be using RCDefaultApp\n\n Answered as Community Wiki just so we don't have a dangling question when there's a perfectly good answer in the comments. \n\nA: Set Safari to be your default web browser.\n", "Q: Blocking iOS Wi-Fi automatic update downloads? I've got several iPads connected to Verizon mifi devices(MiFi460LE)\niOS has a \"feature\" that automatically downloads OS updates in the background without user input. (You still need to manually install the updates, but the downloads happen automatically).\nThe 6.1 update may break the functionality of some in-house applications, and I'd rather not hand users an iPad with a flashing self-destruct button that tells users to \"download now!\"\nIs there a specific port that could be blocked to prevent iOS OTA software updates? If that's not sufficient, would blocking hosts from DNS or another way of preventing these downloads be feasible?\n\nA: Without jailbreaking, or using an MDM (mobile device management) solution, you could just block the Apple site at your router. The site URL is appldnld.apple.com. All of Apple's IPSW files come from that location.\n\nA: The latest update to the evasi0n jailbreak, evasi0n 1.2, allows you to disable OTA updates.\nThis is a fairly good tailored version of evasi0n considering the fact that it's the second update it received since it was released if you are hesitating about the down sides of jailbreaking on device performance.\nTurning off iCloud might be a disadvantage. If you really want to disable OTA updates; I strongly suggest you to jailbreak. \nHere is a tutorial for jailbreaking with evaisi0n.\nP.S. If you will download evais0n, ONLY download it from evasi0n.com. Do NOT trust other sources.\n\nA: \nBlocking iOS Wi-Fi automatic update downloads?\n\niOS/iPadOS 13.6 has introduced the ability for users to turn off automatic download of updates. To configure automatic download or installation of iOS/iPadOS updates on your iPhone or iPad, go to Settings app → General → Software Update → Customize Automatic Updates and toggle the switches as desired.\nThe linked Apple Support document discusses the same:\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/HT204204\n\nCustomize Automatic Updates\n\nWith iOS 13.6, or iPadOS, you can choose not to download software updates automatically. Go to Settings > General > Software Update > Customize Automatic Updates, then turn off Download iOS updates.\n\n\nA: Apple's documentation says that the automatic downloads only happen when you are both:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plugged in to power\n\n*Connected to Wi-Fi\n\n\nIt's not a long term strategy, but I have had people ensure they put their devices in Airplane mode before plugging in their devices to avoid a spike in downloads on release day for sites with fragile connections to the internet where we don't have more advanced options like blocking / throttling certain traffic as would be ideal for this situation.\n\nA: Just block the apple software sever...\n", "Q: Switching to Straight Talk From T-Mobile on an iPhone 5 I am at my wit's end trying to get my wife's iPhone 5 switched from T-Mobile to straight talk.\nJust about a month ago my wife's old cellphone was reaching a breaking point, so she decided to get an unlocked gsm iphone 5 16GB from the Apple store. We took it to T-Mobile where they popped in a sim and everything worked perfectly. Well, there's no 1900mhz HSPA+ in our area yet, and she had to edit the APN to get MMS messages working, but perfect apart from those things. \nOur contract is up now and she wants 3G speeds so we decided to switch her over to Straight Talk. What I've done so far is port her number over, and texts (non-MMS) and calls work perfectly. \nBut data won't work whatsoever. It gives the message: \n\n\"not subscribed to a cellular data service\"\n\nI've tried calling Straight Talk tech support but they try to walk me through editing the APN but now the Settings > General > Network entry no longer shows up! I think it depends on what SIM you have inserted, but the T-Mobile sim we had is long trashed at this point.\nWhat I've learned so far is that if the Settings > General > Network entry does not show up that means your phone is locked (?), but she specifically bought an unlocked phone so now I'm just confused.\nSome advice I've googled has said to restore the phone in iTunes, but she had never synced it before switching to StraightTalk. Anyway, I backed up and restored it, but I didn't get the: \n\n\"Congratulations your phone is unlocked.\"\n\nmessage I guess I should be seeing.\nI've also read advice telling me to contact AT&T about unlocking the phone, but you have to fax something? And it takes 5-7 days? Ugh.\nI guess I'm just asking how do I get the Settings > General > Network entry to show up so I can continue with Straight Talk tech support and try to get the data problem solved?\n\nA: Try using http://www.unlockit.co.nz to set the APN to StraightTalk.\n\nA: So I ended up jailbreaking and following the advice on this wiki page.\nSteps involved:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset network settings to clear out custom apn blob (they conflict with TetherMe settings).\n\n*Backed up phone in itunes.\n\n*Jailbroke phone using evasion.\n\n*Installed TetherMe from cydia.\n\n*Set up straight talk config in TetherMe settings.\n\n\nThis got mms messaging and data working perfectly.\nI guess whether the Settings > General > Cellular > Cellular Data Network entry shows up depends on the sim card itself. The settings app uses some unknown internal criteria to hide or show that option.\nI also tried the sim swap method described on that same wiki page with no luck.\n\nA: Go to unlockit.co.nz and download the apn for straight talk. This is how I got my iphone working on straight talk with 4G speeds \n", "Q: Retina Macbook Pro now has faster battery drain I have disabled Hibernation mode and Deep Sleep mode, I also keep the charger plugged in about a week before removing it if I want to go somewhere with the laptop.\nI don't know if this is normal, but I realised that my battery started draining faster recently. I usually have 6-8 hours of time on battery for web-browsing, youtubing, a bit of programming and nothing really power intensive. GFX-status usually displays i for integrated GPU usage. However I recently started getting 4-5 hours maximum. \nWhy is this happening ? is it the lifetime of the battery starting to decrease ? I purchased this laptop over summer (one the first batches the retina macbooks were released). So it's not really that old. Can anyone provide a possible explanation to this phenomenon ? \n\nA: Reboot.\nCreate a new user.\nTry.\nIf the battery life is still short after a couple of days under a new account and there's nothing weird. Take it back to an Apple store. They will run the hardware test and determine if there's a problem with the battery. Be nice to them. Explain them that you know what you're doing, that this is unusual, that you know how to take care of a battery, that it suddenly started happening and that you would like for a Genius to take a look at it. \nI did that with my Macbook Air 11 (with a 8 month old battery that just died out of nowhere) and they kindly replaced it. \nBetter safe than sorry.\n\nA: Keep an eye on the Activity Monitor for processes that are hanging on the CPU. For instance, yesterday I noticed that the battery was draining very fast, only to find out that Evernote was constantly consuming 35% of the CPU power while in full screen. I quit Evernote and my battery went back to normal. \nAlso, try disabling Flash - it has quite some impact on the battery time.\nLastly, don't forget to be frugal on the power hungry functions: Keep the brightness low, disable Bluetooth when not needed and do the same with the keyboard lights.\n\nA: Consider trying or buying the excellent utility Watts.  I've been running it on my last few MBPs (no Retina models, yet) and have found its helped prolong my batteries' lifespans.\n\nA: I'm not sure that having Deep Sleep or Hibernation mode would dramatically affect your battery life. My understanding of Hibernation is that it is a complete shut down, with the contents of memory written to hard disk. I think using anything other than the default sleep settings (particularly settings that you need Terminal to change) is asking for trouble. \nI'd be interested to see what your current batter capacity / charge cycles are - if there is a physical fault with the battery you may be able to see it there. Have a look in About this mac - more info -> System Report -> Power. \nHere are some things you can try before taking it in to your nearest service centre:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset the SMC\n\n*Reset the NVRAM\n\n*It might be worth checking that Power Nap is turned off while on battery power.\n\n*As Martin suggested, use a new user account and see if the drain happens then.\n\n*If you're feeling adventurous reinstall Mac OS X (which is what Apple Phone support will suggest, but it's quite a drastic problem solving technique).  \n\n\nBecause batteries are based on chemicals they can fault before they should, but there are often software based issues that are causing an otherwise healthy battery to drain more quickly then it should. \n", "Q: Max OS X: White saturation is terrible I bought a new LCD-Monitor: Acer S235HLBbmii.\nI had Windows 8 until today.

I've set the permissions on files on my removable external drives in ways that seem to make sense to preserve some degree of security. For example, for files that only I should have access to, I've only myself any access rights\n-rw-------@   1 MyName  staff  ... File1 \n\nwhile for others, that I want other users of my machine to have access to, I've expanded these access rights a bit\n-rw-r-----@   1 MyName  staff  ... File2\n\nThis behaves as I intend on my machine; but what happens if the drive is plugged into a different machine? Does anyone on the staff group there have read access to File2 and none to File? Would anyone who was given the user name MyName on that machine have full access to both files?\n\nA: Anyone with the same user ID as you have on your main machine will be able to read the disk. The, usually hidden, user Ids start at 501 and increase. If you are not the first user on a machine you will not be able to read the contents of the drive.\nI've gone round and round with this. If you need a secure drive then you need to encrypt it with a password. There are ways to do this using the tools built into Mountain Lion, or you can use a third party solution like True Crypt.\n", "Q: iLife doesn't appear in \"Purchased\" after installing ML on a registered MacBook Pro I bought an open-item, unregistered MacBook Pro from Best Buy and they told me that they had installed Mountain Lion just like a clean setup. But the iLife bundle doesn't appear in the laptop or in the App Store (the \"Purchased\" section is empty). Does anyone know if I need to buy it?\n\nA: I just went through this same problem. Originally I called Apple and they said that iLife was linked to someone else's account so I could not download it. Upon further research I found the above mentioned method.\n1) In Finder, click on the Go menu.\n2) Click Go to Folder.\n3) Enter ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.appstore/\n4) Drag adoption.plist to the Trash.\n5) Restart and see if they appear in purchased items.\nI actually chatted with apple first and had them reset the account.  They did this, and I should have been able to get the purchases within 24 hours using this method.\nIt did not work, I chatted with Apple again (chat session). They took me through the above step, with still no result. After not being able to access it, Apple gave me a redemption code through the app store. All in all it was not too big of a problem and I now have all of the factory standards.\n\nA: Best Buy lied. When they reinstalled the machine, it wiped iLife. Here's what you need to do, from http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1224880\n\nHow to reinstall iLife on an open-box Mac w/ Lion.\n  So I was in best buy the other day and picked up the newest MacBook Air 11 for $1101 (including 7.5% sales tax) (AMAZING beast of a machine by the way) and have run in to a problem. \nBecause Apple likes the cloud so much, we don't get application CDs any longer. By law, Best Buy is required to restore a returned computer. If you go to \"purchased\" in the app store, you will see your iLife apps but when you click download it will tell you that they are linked to another Apple ID! I called Apple Care and after being on hold for a while I was told that my only option was to email the App Store representatives, BUMMER!\nAnyway, even though it will more than likely be a simple 2-3 email solution, Apple is going to have a messy experience with this and it's pretty inconvenient for both sides.\nCall Apple Care. Let them know you researched the topic online in case try and ask you to do anything other than what is listed here. If they try to tell you to contact the Mac App store tell them you are certain that is not a resolution. Ask them to contact their engineering team to remove the previous users registration for iLife off the computer/Serial. It does NOT matter if you erase reformat your drive and reinstall Lion, that will not work (by the way, they will not be able to do it while you are on the phone with them as they have to contact the engineers.) After they do this, do the following and you will be good to go!\n1) In Finder, click on the Go menu.\n2) Click Go to Folder.\n3) Enter ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.appstore/\n4) Drag adoption.plist to the Trash.\n5) Restart and see if they appear in purchased items.\n\n\nA: The answer is regrettably yes, you have to buy it. Unless you get lucky.\n\nI went through this experience when I bought my open-box MacBook Air from Best Buy. At first I thought that I could contact Apple Support and get them to attribute the software to my Apple ID, but I was wrong.\nThe free copy of iLife that comes with every new Mac is given to the first Apple ID that gets associated with a user account on the Mac. It's non-transferrable, because it's somehow tied to the hardware (I don't know the details).\nHowever, fortune smiled upon me. When I upgraded from Lion to Mountain Lion, a firmware update or something gave me the ability to download the iLife suite for free. It seems that an OS upgrade or certain updates can post-link the apps to your Apple ID.\n\nSummary: I recommend only buying the iLife apps that you need. Wait and see if a future update brings you the others.\n", "Q: Will it work well to use a .dmg as an encrypted folder? I have a folder containing files including Wills, Trusts, personal financial statements etc. Most of these files are word docs, excel spreadsheets, PDF's and jpegs. I would like to protect this folder from prying eyes.\nIf this info was housed in a .dmg, it would seem pretty straightforward to click on the .dmg, enter my password, mount the drive, access the information/folder and when finished, eject the disk image knowing it is closed and protected.\nAm I missing something? Any pros/cons of this idea?\n\nA: Using a disk image .dmg to hold your private documents is an ideal use of disk images. Apple provide detailed steps for setting up such a disk image, how to create a password-protected (encrypted) disk image.\n\nApplications > Utilities > Disk Utility.app\n\nUse the Disk Utility application to create a sparse bundle disk image with 256-bit AES encryption. These two settings ensure you have a secure container that can grow to accommodate more files in the future.\nYou should select a suitably large initial size, such as 8 GB or more. The initial disk image will not be 8 GB but will be able to to grow as you add files.\nYou should disable Spotlight indexing on your secure volume by creating a .metadata_never_index file. You can do this through the Terminal.app:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount your secure disk image;\n\n*Launch Terminal.app;\n\n*Change in your secure volume's root directory: cd /Volumes/<secure volume name>\n\n*Create the invisible never index file: touch .metadata_never_index\n\n\nA: Like the other guys said, dmg is probably the best way to keep important folders encrypted. However, you should keep in mind the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*When you create a dmg file, you must specify its size. Once done, it\nwill have that size no matter what you delete from it. Also, you\nwill not be able to add anything in dmg further to that size. There\nis a way to resize dmg, like any other partition, you can do it from\nDisk Utility. So in terms of size, it's not optimal per se.\n\n*If you want a \"flexible\" encrypted file, you should use sparse image or sparse bundle image. The first is one large file, the second is a collection of small files (which can be handy). Both types require that you define maximum size, but will physically take as much space as you really put into them. However, as far as I know, if you delete things, they won't shrink - there is a manual way to shrink them from Terminal.\n\n\nOne thing important to me (may or may not be to you): dmg files, even encrypted with 256 AES, can be open in Windows, using appropriate apps. To me, this means I don't depend on Mac, even if I lose it, I can still access backed up dmg files from any machine (any means Windows, over 90% out there are, like it or not). However, sparse and sparse bundle files can't be accessed from Windows, so you're stuck with Macs. To me, this is a dealbreaker for sparse stuff.\n\nA: TrueCrypt is an open source utility (Mac, Windows, Linux) that can encrypt and decrypt a group of files into a archive. It is multiplatform, fast and portable. You can also add a hidden partition that is not visible if you need a second layer of security. I recommend taking a look at this.\nhttp://www.truecrypt.org\n\nA: Your use case is exactly why encrypted DMG were created. The external file name can be different than the actual name of the filesystem can be obfuscated while the drive is not mounted.\nThe only con (which kind of is a Pro) is that spotlight can't search within an unmounted image and you may want to disable spotlight entirely on that volume just in case you don't want any extra caches / extra access that isn't necessary.\nAlternatives to this is storing text in a keychain secure note, especially if you keep alternate keychains for more secure information. I also find myself storing more things in 1Password when I don't need a self-contained archive for things like certain client data or certain data I wish to be doubly encrypted. (I use FileVault on most Mac these days so that everything is encrypted at least once.)\n\nA: I have to add my two bits here about password strength.  As I stated before any encrypted volume will only be as secure as the password you are using.\nThe real issue is how strong the password for the encrypted volume is. If the password is not a random string of characters, but based on a dictionary word with substitutions of 1 for i etc, the files while encrypted might as well not be.\nEnsure your password is based on a long sentence where you use all punctuation marks, include spaces, numbers and special characters.\n", "Q: Can I launch an iPad application in a different locale than what iOS uses? My iPad 3 is configured in French for the family but I prefer my apps un-translated. Is it possible to force an application to launch in a specific locale? Is it feasible without a third-party tool?\n\nA: The short answer is that this is, unfortunately, not possible with the default install of iOS. \nIt is always possible that there is a jailbreak hack that allows this, but that would probably fall under the \"third-party tool\" category.\n", "Q: MBR-partitioned HDD: How to encrypt Time Machine backup? I'm giving my external HDD to a friend tomorrow for a few days. It's partitioned via Master Boot Record and there are two partitions: a NTFS partition and my Time Machine partition. I don't want him to be able to access the latter, but I can't turn the encryption on because the disk would have to be partitioned with GUID. \nChanging the partition scheme would require me to reformat the disk. I can't do this either, as I don't have another HDD to put my files on in the meantime.\nIs there another way to encrypt the partition, other than the built-in option of OS X?\nOr is there a way to prohibit access to the Time Machine partition without any encryption at all?\n\nA: I think what you could do is creating a encrypted disk image on the external HDD and put your time maschine files in it for the timeframe your friend has the disk. To achieve this open the disk utility tool and choose File -> New -> Blank Disc Image (or Image From Folder).\nBUT keep in mind that as long as this disk is not (re-)formatted properly it will be easy to recover unencrypted data which seems to be deleted or moved (using some fancy recovery tools).\n", "Q: Mac Mini + Thunderbolt Display+ Additional Display? I just purchased a 2012 Mac Mini to use with my Apple Thunderbolt Display.\nThe mini also included an HDMI to DVI converter.  I have a DVI-connected ViewSonic montior that I'd like to use as a secondary display.  Is it possible to use the HDMI-out port as a secondary monitor output?\nLike so: (excuse the horrible art)\n     Thunderbolt Port          HDMI Port\n    /*****************|------|**********\\_________\n   |                  | Mac  |          |         |\n---------------       | Mini |          | Other   |\n| Thunderbolt |       |------|          | Monitor |\n|   Display   |                         |_________|\n|_____________|\n\n\nA: Yes, that will work just fine.\n", "Q: Mail: how to download newest first? Can I tell Mail to download the newest messages first? \nMy Mac is my second computer. When I check e-mail, it has often been 2 weeks since I last opened Mail. Currently, I have to wait for hundreds of messages from 2 weeks ago to finish downloading before I can open that one message my client just now sent to me.\n\nA: If you're using Mail to access your work email on an Exchange server, it's quite possible you'll be able to see the mail on Outlook Web Access (OWA).\nTo find out the address for OWA, check your Accounts preferences, and look for the \"External Server\" entry, simply point your browser to https://external.server.com (make sure it's HTTPS and not just HTTP) and you'll be able to login and view all the messages just like with webmail.\n", "Q: Vertical Sync on MBP On PCs you could easily configure the Vertical Sync setting from NVidia control panel, how can you enable/disable vertical sync in OS X?\n\nA: In OSX, Veritical Sync is called Beam Sync\nRunning the command sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver Compositor -dict deferredUpdates 0 should do it for you, but you may need to reboot. Replace the 0 with 1 to re-enable.\nYou should also be able to do this by downloading this prefpane and looking under \"System\". Another way is to use Quartz Debug to disable it, but it seems like that has become harder to run on Lion & ML.\n", "Q: Why is the Lock feature not working on my folder? I have a private folder on my drive that I keep personal docs in and i want to make it password protected. So I thought I would click Get Info > make it write only in the Sharing & Permissions section > lock it in the General section, then click the padlock at the bottom corner to prevent changes, which means if anyone wants to get access to the folder, they would have to click the padlock, type in a password, uncheck the Locked tick and then change the permissions to read & write.\nThis worked for a while, but now when I access the folder, I go through all those steps and when I click the padlock, I don't hear the locking noise and I can still make changes to the folder.\nIs there a setting somewhere that I need to fix/unfix? Is there something in Terminal I can do to make this folder password protected?\n\nA: If your goal is to prevent someone accidentally stumbling into a folder, making the folder un-readable through the Finder dialog would likely accomplish that goal (and without needing a password — one is unlikely to \"accidentally\" open the File Info dialog, change the permissions settings, then open the folder.\nIf you are concerned about some snooping that isn't quite accidental, you really need more protection. I'd recommend using an encrypted disk image. That way you can give your folder real password protection, and the password you use doesn't have to be the system password (which users of your computer might need to know).\n\nA: I don't know why the Get Info dialog isn't working anymore, but if you want to remove read permission from a folder in Terminal, you can type chmod -r folderName. You can add read permission back by typing chmod +r folderName.\n", "Q: Anyone else having issues with the weather app?

They don't appear to be registered. I'm trying to find out how I bought them, since I have a new MacBook Air with Mountain Lion and I don't want to pay twice if I can help it. They might have been downloaded outside of the App Store. How do I trace my purchase and find out what I'm entitled to?\nIf I have to purchase these three again, is the App Store the best method from now on?\n\nA: You purchased them from the Mac App Store, and they don't show up in your Purchased list? That's odd. I'd contact Apple's support team and get them to fix it. However, if you bought them outside the Mac App Store - back when the suite was sold on a DVD - then I think you can get updates anyway.

Hooked up Time Capsule and enabled encrypted iMac backup. \nNext, to my (little bit older) MacBook Air (OS 10.7). Trying to enable encrypted backup, but \"Encrypt My Backup\" checkbox is disabled (greyed-out).\nOpinion differs. Some say MacBook Air backup is encrypted too, because \"entire volume\" of Time Capsule is encrypted by iMac. \nNot convinced. No user feedback on that from MacBook perspective.\nWhat is the answer?\n\nA: Encrypted backups only work when the backup disc is connected via USB.\nIt seems that there is a workaround for it using sparse bundle:\nMac OSX Lion Secure Backup to Time Capsule\n\nA: Well, the iMac doesn't need a direct connection to the Time Capsule and I am still offered the encrypt backup option. But, it's running Mountain Lion.\nBut maybe it seems that contrary to my previous assumption, Lion (OS 10.7) doesn't allow encrypted backups to network Time Capsules, whereas Mountain Lion (OS 10.8) does.\nAt least that's what this posting suggests: http://www.astrobetter.com/os-x-10-8-mountain-lion-what-has-changed/\nSo, maybe if I upgrade the MacBook to Mountain Lion I can have what I want.\n\nA: That's because Lion doesn't support encryption of timemachine backups over network.

How do I get these off/get back to the 160G?\n\nA: You can repair it with Disk Utility. First you have to open the iPod in iTunes and click \"Enable disk use\" and Sync. Then close iTunes and open Disk Utility, select the iPod and repair the disk. After repair, you can restore and disable the disk use.\n\nA: The hard disk might be damaged. There might be bad sectors that look, to a computer, as if they are used. I don't have a classic any more, but I think you can try reformatting it with Disk Utility. Use HFS+ non-journaled, and if it's not the right format, iTunes should be able to reformat it.\n", "Q: How do I get Wi-Fi info from within Terminal? Is there a way to get BSSID and the list of available Wi-Fi networks from within Terminal?\nI.e. I'm looking for something similar to ifconfig run0 scan on OpenBSD, which lists all access points, BSSID, signal strength etc.\n\nA: There's an airport utility buried that you'll want to use. Create a symbolic link in /usr/local/bin to the utility for quick access with this command:\nsudo ln -s /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport /usr/local/bin/airport\nNow, you should be able to run airport -s and get a list of available networks with BSSIDs.\nIf you hold the option key while opening the WiFi networks in the Menu Bar, you can also see the BSSIDs one at a time, although it seems like you wanted the CLI-like version from OpenBSD.\nUPDATE:\n\"rootless\" AKA System Integrity Protection (SIP) has been added to OSX since I wrote this answer originally, which makes /usr/bin and /usr/sbin read-only. It is proper to use /usr/local/bin, so I have updated the answer so that the symbolic link is created there.\n", "Q: How can I access 'flight mode' in iphone4 without a sim card?

Does anyone know how to stop it from happening?\n\n(Above copied over from stackoverflow as it was closed there as \"off topic\".)\nTo elaborate further:\nApple deems this a feature, and their knowledge base article does not disclose how to disable this delay.\nHowever, I have reason to believe it is possible to do so.\nNotably, I have found that, at least in my experience, if you remap the caps-lock key on Mac OS X (in System Preferences .. Keyboard .. Modifier Keys), and e.g. map it to Control, then the delay goes away while I am logged into Mac OS X.\nMy problem is that the delay remains when I boot into Ubuntu Linux, and in that context, even when I remap the Caps Lock key to Control, the delay is still present.\nSo, the question is: How is Apple disabling the delay, and more importantly, how can one replicate that act in the context of a Linux installation atop the laptop?\nUpdate: There is a thread on superuser that may provide workarounds.  I have not yet tried the suggestions there (namely: (1) toggling CapsLock-NoAction off/on, and (2) a firmware upgrade).  I cannot tell from the context of that thread whether the workarounds have been tested on an Ubuntu installation.\n\nA: EDIT: This seems to be a popular landing question for users looking to remove the delay on the caps lock key in OS X. As of OS X Mojave, \n\nGo to System Preferences; Accessibility; Keyboard; enable Slow Keys\n  and go into options; turn the delay down to the minimum. The only\n  unwanted side-effect I've noticed so far is slow backspace action when holding it down.\n  Generally I use CMD+A / CMD+SHIFT+L/R / CMD+SHIFT+CTRL+L/R\n  anyway so it's not a big issue.\n\nAs of El Capitan and earlier,\n\nThe solution is quite elusive, and you wouldn't really know you\n  removed it unless you were specifically trying to get rid of it in the\n  first place. The way I am going to show you is purely for the\n  (current)latest version of OSX, Yosemite. However you can absolutely\n  apply this method to previous and future versions.\nThe solution is simple. If you navigate to Keyboard in the System\n  preferences via the apple logo in the top left hand corner you will\n  reach this screen\n\nIf you click the modifier keys button, you are able to change the\n  function of each of the keys which are programmable. All you have to\n  do is set the caps lock key to no action and press ok to bring you\n  back to the keyboard menu. Once done, go back into the modifier keys\n  and change the caps lock key back to caps lock and this will remove\n  the delay! Do note that this fix remains in place until you sleep,\n  restart or power down the device. At which point the delay is\n  reinstated.\n\nThey're strange fixes, and it begs the question why do they not provide an option to remove the delay when this fix is purely software based. But hey, at least there is a way!\nHappy capsing.\n\nA: Elaborating on @jmrk answer. His code works well for the so called \"aluminum\" keyboard, but apple also released wireless keyboards, under the name \"magic keyboard\", with product id 0x022d. (They also have aluminum chassis, and I think that my model is from 2008 or so.) This product has the same caps lock issue, and almost the same code can fix it. Beside changing the product id, the descriptor size is 218, and the data to send is not 0x00, but 0x01:\nbuf[0] = 0x09;  // Report Number\nbuf[1] = 0x01;  // Report data\n\nI found this today and thought to record my answer here in case it helps anyone, including my future self.\nHere is a complete program fixing the issue on both kind of devices.

This worked for me.\n\nA: I've figured out how to do this. In short, you must send a \"Feature Report\" consisting of the bytes 0x9, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0 to the appropriate hidraw device as root.\nYou can find the right hidraw device with this command: \ndmesg | grep Apple | grep Keyboard | grep input0 | tail -1 | sed -e 's/.*hidraw\\([[:digit:]]\\+\\).*/\\/dev\\/hidraw\\1/'\n\nThe code to send the magic control packet is below. Compiles with gcc, takes the hidraw device as parameter. So the entire flow is:\n\n\n*\n\n*save the code below as disable-capslock-delay.c\n\n*gcc -o disable-capslock-delay disable-capslock-delay.c\n\n*HIDDEVICE=$(dmesg | grep Apple | grep Keyboard | grep input0 | tail -1 | sed -e 's/.*hidraw\\([[:digit:]]\\+\\).*/\\/dev\\/hidraw\\1/')\n\n*sudo ./disable-capslock-delay $HIDDEVICE\nSteps 3 and 4 have to be done every time you reboot (or unplug and re-plug the keyboard); you can put them into /etc/rc.local (or your distro's equivalent) to execute them at boot (you don't need sudo in that case; and you might want to move the compiled binary into /usr/local/sbin/ or something).\nI've put in some safety checks for vendor ID, device ID, and report descriptor length. You may have to change the latter two if your model differs from mine.\n\n#include <linux/hidraw.h>\n#include <sys/ioctl.h>\n#include <fcntl.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main(int argc, char **argv) {\n  if (argc != 2 || strcmp(argv[1], \"-h\") == 0) {\n    printf(\"Pass a hidraw device as the first and only parameter!\\n\");\n    printf(\"You may find the right device with:\\n\");\n    printf(\"  dmesg | grep Apple | grep Keyboard | grep input0 | tail -1 | \"\n           \"sed -e 's/.hidraw\\([[:digit:]]\\+\\)./\\/dev\\/hidraw\\1/'\\n\");\n    return 1;\n  }\n  int fd, i, res, desc_size = 0;\n  char buf[256];\n  struct hidraw_devinfo info;\n  char *device = argv[1];\n  fd = open(device, O_RDWR | O_NONBLOCK);\n  if (fd < 0) {\n    perror(\"Unable to open device\");\n    return 1;\n  }\n  memset(&info, 0, sizeof(info));\n  memset(buf, 0, sizeof(buf));\n  // Get Report Descriptor Size\n  res = ioctl(fd, HIDIOCGRDESCSIZE, &desc_size);\n  if (res < 0) {\n    perror(\"HIDIOCGRDESCSIZE\");\n  }\n  if (desc_size != 75) {\n    printf(\"Error: unexpected descriptor size %d; you've probably got \"\n           \"the wrong hidraw device!\\n\", desc_size);\n    return 1;\n  }\n  // Get Raw Info\n  res = ioctl(fd, HIDIOCGRAWINFO, &info);\n  if (res < 0) {\n    perror(\"HIDIOCGRAWINFO\");\n  } else {\n    if (info.vendor != 0x05ac) {\n      printf(\"Error: Wrong vendor ID, make sure you got the right \"\n             \"hidraw device!\\n\");\n      return 1;\n    }\n    if (info.product != 0x0250) {\n      printf(\"Warning: Unknown product ID 0x%x!\\n\", info.product);\n    }\n  }\n  // Get Feature\n  buf[0] = 0x09;  // Report Number\n  res = ioctl(fd, HIDIOCGFEATURE(256), buf);\n  if (res < 0) {\n    perror(\"HIDIOCGFEATURE\");\n  } else {\n    printf(\"HID Feature Report (before change):\\n\\t\");\n    for (i = 0; i < res; i++) printf(\"%hhx \", buf[i]);\n    puts(\"\\n\");\n  }\n  // Set Feature\n  buf[0] = 0x09;  // Report Number\n  buf[1] = 0x00;  // Report data\n  buf[2] = 0x00;  // padding\n  buf[3] = 0x00;  // padding\n  res = ioctl(fd, HIDIOCSFEATURE(4), buf);\n  if (res < 0) {\n    perror(\"HIDIOCSFEATURE\");\n  } else {\n    printf(\"Caps lock delay disabled.\\n\");\n  }\n  // Get Feature\n  buf[0] = 0x09;  // Report Number\n  res = ioctl(fd, HIDIOCGFEATURE(256), buf);\n  if (res < 0) {\n    perror(\"HIDIOCGFEATURE\");\n  } else {\n    printf(\"HID Feature Report (after change):\\n\\t\");\n    for (i = 0; i < res; i++) printf(\"%hhx \", buf[i]);\n    puts(\"\\n\");\n  }\n  close(fd);\n  return 0;\n}\n\n\nA: Here is the fix for macOS Sierra.\nGo to System Preferences > Accessibility\nWhen the accessibility window is open — on the left part of the window – click Keyboard\nThen there will be the 2 options — for sticky keys, and for slow keys — click the box next to slow keys to enable it — then click the Options... button – a new window will come up with a slider to change the acceptance delay — by default this is in the middle.

I have a question and a story, since things aren't completely clear in my mind how iMessage and FaceTime work.\nIf someone sends me an iMessage / FaceTime call, does it mean they have other contact information about me?\n\nI received a Facetime call request that came up with the email address amelia.thompson03@hotmail.co.uk which I did not answer as I do not know anyone by that name. I then received an imessage from 'her' saying hi its amelia thompson and was this emelia stone (a name that is attached to an email account I set up years ago but not in fact my real name). I asked how they knew Emelia Stone and they replied that they were in her class. Not likely as she is a fictitious character.\nI decided to leave it at that but have since received two further facetime requests and several more imessages including a grand total of 16 picture messages of One Direction's Harry Styles, to which I responded in no uncertain terms that I did not wish to be contacted again..\nI'm inclined to find the whole thing rather amusing but it is obviously not acceptable and I'm interested to find out how on earth somebody could contact me, not via regular email spam, but directly to my iPhone.\n\nA: In short, your account wasn't hacked or compromised if someone you don't know places a call or SMS or iMessage or FaceTime call to your address.\nSadly, you can't easily block or change your iMessage and FaceTime account today, but if this grows, I would expect a way to block things just like the phone company now has various options for blocking unwanted calls even though they did not have such blocking in the past.\n\nWhen you register for iMessage, you tell Apple either your email address or your phone number. Anyone else with iMessage can add your email address or phone number, so in that respect this is exactly like email spam. \nIn the physical world, someone can put a letter on your doorstep if they physically can make a letter and drop it off. Similarly, anyone with an iMessage/FaceTime account can enter any address and press send. Apple will deliver that message to you if your account is listening to the address the sender placed.\nIn many cases, people have several addresses in iMessage, and merely sending a message to an email associated with your Apple ID doesn't compromise your phone number, password, location or any other details about you by the mere fact that a message was delivered.\nIt's hard to tell whether the person has any information other than your email address, because it's probable they just guessed it. Email spammers use computers to generate millions of possible email addresses, and hope that some of them work. Also, the world is large, there could be thousands of people whose parents named them (or they chose an identity) the same as your fictional creation. Without engaging the sender or additional sleuthing, you may not be able to tell if this is a prank, intentional marketing for One Direction or a coincidence. \n", "Q: Can I use a mSATA drive to create a Fusion Drive in my iMac?

I enabled the debug menu and then selected Reset Application, restarted the App Store and now the Download button shows up again.\nTo enable the debug menu, open Terminal and run\ndefaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool true\n\n\nA: First, make sure that you do not have a copy of that app on another hard drive that is mounted.\nNext delete the icon from Launch Pad. It works like iOS where you click and hold on the icon until they start jiggling and then click the X button to delete it.\nQuit and restart the Mac App Store.\nNow you should see that it is available to download in the Mac App Store.\n\nA: I had this because a previous version of the app was still on the drive.

If I click on the year column, all the library is mixed. Can I arrange it so only the Coldplay albums are sorted into years and not the whole library is sorted?\nThank you \n\nA: I assume this is ITunes 11 (Earlier iTunes gave better options)\nIn album view: From the menus choose View->View Options and then choose the sort by as Artist and then as Year. You get all albums. I suspect this is nearest to what you are asking for.\n\nA: Here's how: create a new Smart Playlist -- the command is under the File => New menu -- in the the left side panel of iTunes. \nIn the resulting dialog box, set the playlist to Artist is ColdPlay. The resulting display will show only ColdPlay songs. \nYou can now sort the display as you wish.\n", "Q: Looking for a monitor for my 2012 model iMac I know there are many of these types of questions, but the answers for the later models do not directly help with the newer iMac model that just came out in December 2012. I'm having a HUGE issue finding a second 24\" monitor that my iMac doesn't have to calibrate and give me multiple blue screens once turning that second monitor on. \nI've looked at this question and it's answers \niMac second monitor alternative\nand a few more however I'm looking for an answer, hopfeully from another newer iMac owner. \nThere was a Gateway monitor on sale through the holidays however it gave me that unwanted 5 seconds of blue screen on my iMAc when I turned it o (every single time). So I took it back and I've used 2 older monitors from Asus (unfortunately, not my own but from friends) and they work no problem. So I set out to buy an Asus. However this Asus monitor I have hooked up to it now is worse and give me multiple blue screens that last longer than the first once it's turned on. \nIs there an individual that has faced this before with their new 2012 iMac and did you find a monitor that just turned on normally (with no blue screen interruptions)?\nI'm not looking for the cinema display, I'm not looking for that at this moment (although it is in my wish list for the end of the year, but after purchasing this new iMac and can't afford that right now. I'm just looking for an overall decent monitor I can work on when it comes to text documents, videos & surfing.)\nI appreciate any help and hope that this is a valid question.\n\nA: I have recently added an LG FlatIron IPS234V LED monitor, 1920 x 1080, to my 2011 iMac, that I purchased from NewEgg for about $160.  It connects to the ThunderBolt port through a DVI cable and a MiniDisplayPort to DVI adapter, both from Monoprice, for about $16.\nAfter inserting the MiniDisplayPort adapter in the port, and turning the monitor on, the image appears without any changes to the iMac display.  I am quite pleased with the combo so far, at what seems a reasonable cost. Windows can be dragged from one screen to the other.  \nI cannot say how this combo would work with a 2012 iMac.  The additional display space remains active even if the monitor is turned off, until the cable is disconnected from the ThunderBolt port.  This is disruptive for remote control, so I try to disconnect the cable before I leave the system.  \nI have seen the blue screens when I change the display resolution on either screen, but not otherwise.\n\nA: About the only monitor you're pretty much guaranteed not to have a problem with are Apple's. They are a bit more expensive than the competition, but you get what you pay for.\nAlso, how often do you turn your monitor on, it doesn't seem like this is a big deal. I've always bought Dell monitors for my Macintosh desktops and have never had the problem you describe.\n", "Q: Is there any way to make my iPhone sync calendars with iCloud periodically? I have an iPhone and an iPad, both with iOS 6.1. I use iCloud for calendar syncing between them and my Mac. For whatever reason, the iOS devices don’t sync calendars with iCloud unless and until I open the Calendar app on the device. Is there any way to change this behavior so that iOS checks for calendar changes without my intervention?\n(This is very annoying for two reasons: I set alarms on events frequently, but each time I do this on my computer I have to remember to launch Calendar on my phone or else it won’t know about the new event and it won’t remind me. Moreover, I don’t even use Calendar—I use Fantastical on the phone and Calvetica on the iPad—so it’s out of my way even to launch the Calendar app.)\n\nA: Navigate to: Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Fetch New Data\nAnd set:\n\n\n*\n\n*Push = ON\n\n*Fetch = (as often as you like)\n\n\nMove to Advanced, and set iCloud to Push\n\nA: Checklist:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check your Calendars setting on iOS (accessible from the\nSettings->iCloud) by ensuring your iCloud account details in\ncorrect.

That is, all the various headers of each column in the Applications window are flat white and clicking on any of them has no effect. I'm not sure what's caused it; whatever caused it, it's not something I've done deliberately.\nNormally, at least one column header is in the computer's highlight colour, to signify that's the one that's controlling how the window's files are sorted. In this case, none of the headers are in colour, and clicking on any of them has no effect on the sort within the window. Only the Applications window is affected, all the other Finder windows work normally.\nThinks I've checked: \n• The folder that encloses the Applications folder sorts normally, and folders inside the Applications window sort normally when opened.\n• A new folder created in the Applications folder, when opened, works normally.\n• All the applications inside the applications folder launch normally.\nIn Get Info, the Applications folder is not being shared and nor is it locked (the Locked option is greyed out, however). The Sharing & Permissions table shows that the System and Admin (which is me) can each Read & Write to the folder, while Everyone is read only. There's nothing obviously out of its proper setting in Get Info (although I don't know if the grey'd Locked setting is normal for the apps folder; it is live in other folders.\nOpening the Applications folder in a new, virgin account on the same computer shows the same problem.\nAt the moment, the files in the folder are sorted in reverse order (z to a), which is annoying but I can limp along with it like that.\nDo you have any suggestions for how I might fix the folder so that it sorts properly?\nThings I've tried:\n• In the Get Info window, changing Everyone to Read & Write temporarily has no effect on the issue.\n• Changing Admin to Read Only temporarily, and then back to Read & Write, has no effect on the issue at either stage.\n\nA: Finder has had separate arrange by and sort by modes since 10.7. That usually happens when arrange by is set to something other than none.\nThe pop-up button on the toolbar always changes the arrange by mode, but View > Arrange By turns to Sort By when you hold option, and for example ⌃⌥⌘6 sorts by size.\n\nA: I've had the exact same problem but with the Desktop folder, rather than Applications.\nBased on the answer above, in Finder I clicked View > Arrange By and noted that \"Name\" was checked [and indeed all the files were in reverse alphabetical order].  \nHolding down the \"Option\" key, so that \"Arrange By\" was replaced with \"Sort By\", I noted that all the sorting options were grayed out.  Back at \"Arrange By\" I changed the choice to \"None\", and then when pressing \"Option\" to get to Sort By, the list of sorting choices was available.  Then one can sort by any of the column headings.  I went back to \"Arrange By\" and clicked \"Kind\".  Immediately all the different file types were grouped - and each group given a header - and all headers were once more grayed out.   So - to reword slightly the first answer given above, one can sort files if the choice under \"Arrange By\" is set to \"None.\"\nBecause the statement in the first answer provided neither capitalization nor punctuation for the key words and actions, I didn't get it.  Writing just the words arrange by, sort by, and none left me in the dark. Once I played with the functions I figured it out, hence the step-by-step response above.  However I'm still puzzled about the \"pop-up button on the toolbar\" - nothing pops up but rather a menu drops down - for any \"button\".  Though that's up with the \"ribbon\" toolbar for \"Finder\", not the buttons appearing at the top of the selected Finder window.\n", "Q: Who first wrote the kernel for Mac OS X based operating systems? Was it Steve Jobs? I mean not the idea, but who actually made it happen through the physical work itself?\nWas it a single individual who wrote the bootstrapping software, kernel, graphics, all other assets, etc.?\nI am curious on the coder, not the incentive or ideal, even though I do care on both.\nI am also curious on the first ever kernel or boot loading software, not current coders, but the initial and original one(s) of that time who did this.\n\nA: It wasn't really Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs helped create OSX which is derived from the original operating system kernal.\nOSX is based on the Mach Kernel. \"Mach is an operating system kernel developed at Carnegie Mellon University to support operating system research, primarily distributed and parallel computation.\" Richard Rashid was the lead developer on the Mach project. Avie Tevanian was also one of the original developers on the Mach project.\nOSX was then developed from this Mach Kernel by Steve Jobs' company NeXT. This happened during the time that Jobs was away from Apple. So Jobs' (company) developed the first iteration of OSX which was then purchased by Apple. Apple actually purchased NeXT outright, and Jobs went to serve as CEO at Apple.\nMostly from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X, and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_kernel\n\nA: The best Kernel info resource that I know of is http://google.com/search?q=Mac.OS.X.Internals+Amit.Singh\n", "Q: How do I change the gateway of a specific connection using the Mac terminal? My goal is to be able to change all of the following for a specific device: IP address, netmask, and gateway. So far, I've gathered that I should be able to use ifconfig con0 10.8.0.14 netmask 255.255.255.252, but when I try to do ifconfig con0 gateway 10.8.0.1, it gets pretty upset and tells me that gateway is a bad argument. \nThoughts?\n\nA: The command you're looking for is route.\nCheck what your current gateway is\nTo check your current gateway, run the command:\nroute -n get -ifscope en0 default\n\nThis instructs route to return the path it would take using en0 to reach www.google.com.\n\n\n*\n\n*The -n argument turns off domain name resolution in the output (else gateway in the sample output below would be the name of my gateway).\n\n*The -ifscope argument limits the query to using en0.  Without it, to OS will select which interface to use.\n\n*default tells route that you want to see the default gateway.  You can put a URL here instead if you suspect your OS is choosing something other than the default gateway to access a host.\nThe output will be something along the lines of:\n   route to: default\ndestination: default\n       mask: default\n    gateway: 192.168.1.1\n  interface: en0\n      flags: <UP,GATEWAY,DONE,STATIC,PRCLONING,IFSCOPE>\n recvpipe  sendpipe  ssthresh  rtt,msec    rttvar  hopcount      mtu     expire\n       0         0         0         0         0         0      1500         0 \n\nDelete the current gateway\nTo delete the current gateway from en0, run:\nsudo route delete default -ifscope en0\n\nThis will delete the default gateway from en0 while leaving any other defined routes intact.  \nAdd the new gateway\nTo add the new gateway to en0, run:\nsudo route add default 192.168.1.1 -ifscope en0\n\nReplace 192.168.1.1 with the IP address of the actual gateway.\nFor way more gory details, check out the man page for route.\n", "Q: Mountain Lion no login field after booting My 2012 MBA (no bootcamp) just shows a bare splash screen without user avatar nor password field after booting. Now I've seen this problem twice, I can type my password and then hit return on keyboard to login, but the login field never shows.\nWhat's the problem here? Any fixes?\n\nA: The problem is that OS X detects 2 monitors and thinks that the secondary monitor is the main one.\nThis can happen with a monitor connected to the Thunderbolt port or in your case, as you state in a comment above, using virtual monitor software Air Display.\nApparently, Air Display didn't detect that the built-in MacBook Air monitor was active, so it sent the video signal over WiFi to a peer Air Display device. \nAs a consequence you only saw the bare splash screen.\n", "Q: How can I use Windows via Parallels or Fusion with MINIMAL HARD DISK space? I would like to use VMWare Fusion or Parallels (or another option for running Windows within OSX; not Wine), but I am concerned about the hard disk space requirements.  How can I reduce the hard disk usage when creating a new Windows WM?\n\nA: Both Fusion and Parallels give you the option of creating dynamically sized virtual hard drives. They allow you to specify the maximum size of the virtual hard drive, but do not actually consume (or reserve) that much disk space on the real hard drive. So to answer your question, just be sure to create a dynamically sized virtual hard drive. (I believe this is the default in both Fusion and Parallels.)\n\nA: When you make a new virtual machine, set the hard drive as dynamically expandable (rather than have it allocate the whole virtual hard drive size right away). From time to time you can also compress the virtual hard drive size. Also use a version that doesn't take too much space (e.g. Windows XP doesn't need as much space as Windows Vista). One important thing to consider too is that the more you install, and reinstall, and change, and add files (even if you delete them), the more space it uses. Even if you're VERY careful, you should have at least 10GB available for the virtual machine.\nOf course, you also have the option of getting a relatively small external hard drive for not too much money just for the virtual machine if you're really concerned about the space. However, if you'll use the VM frequently, that may not be the best option (unless maybe you get a firewire or USB3 SSD).\n", "Q: Can I change 10.8.2 Mountain Lion window corners from rounded to squared?

My husband just purchased an ipad 2 and synced it to the itunes already installed on the computer. He has an apple ID now but when he goes to update any apps on his ipad it keeps asking for MY apple ID and password since it synced to it when he connected to itunes. How can he get rid of my apple ID sign in screen on his ipad and sign in to his own apple ID?\nHope someone can understand what Im talking about and can help us........\n\nA: This is because there are apps on his iPad that were assigned to your account. As a result, he will either have to re-download (re-purchase) them on his device (more on that below), or will have to sign into your Apple ID every time he wants to update those apps. When he synced with iTunes, it obviously synced your apps over to his iPad.\nTo rectify this problem, you will need to plug the iPad into iTunes and then de-select the option to sync apps (at least in iTunes 10 this should be under the \"Apps\" tab). It should ask you if you want to clear the apps off of the device. When prompted, accept the message. This should clear all your apps off of his device.\nAfter this, he will need to re-download, and/or re-purchase, the apps that he wants on his iPad. \n", "Q: Downloaded apps do not start, error -10658 When I downloaded an application (e.g. RubyMine) and transfered it to the Applications folder, the application wont start (nothing happens).

At the beginning i was asked to allow the startup of the downloaded app, but now this appears every time.\n\nA: This seems to be a problem with permissions in the bundle itself.

Presumably, the value should be \"root.\"\nI'm no guru, but this seems to be the only thing you're missing — unless launch agents can't be symlinked.\n\nA: So according to this SuperUser answer, you have to run launchctl as sudo in order to retain the permissions\nsudo load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.samplelaunchdscript.plist\n\n\nA: Property lists in LaunchAgents also work, but you have to load both agents and daemons with sudo:\nsudo chown root ~/bin/test.plist\nsudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/test.plist\n\nIf the plist doesn't have a Disabled key, it is loaded automatically on the next login or restart, and -w is not necessary.\n", "Q: Hands free auto repeat. Hidden feature or stuck key? I have a new MacBook Pro. Twice so far I have pressed a key and removed my hands from the keyboard, yet the key continued to repeat.  Once it was the delete key (fn-Delete, the backspace function), and another time it was the g key.\nJust want to know if this was a simple matter of the key getting stuck, or if I accidentally pressed some other key combination that causes this to happen.\n\nA: Rather than an exorcist, I'd take it to an Apple Store, because the keys should not repeat unless you let them pressed. There are various factors than can cause this behavior, but if the machine is relatively new, there shouldn't be any reason for this to happen. Most of the ideas come from a Software malfunction, some utility misbehaving or such. \nI suggest you create a new user and work a few hours/days from there to see if it happens again. If it never happens, migrate your data to this new account and problem fixed. If it keeps happening, rush it to an appstore and see what happens. It's not common. Good luck!\n\nA: known bug on many apple models and recent osx versions (since snow leopard) - fix permissions and if that doesn't help backup your personal stuff and reinstall whole system from fresh. either of those is reported to resolve this issue. \n", "Q: Why does iCal forget the calendars? Sometime ago I noticed that iCal lost all my evens and calendars. Luckily I was somehow able to \"re\"-synchronize it with the Outlook calendar.\nYesterday the same happened. After opening iCal all my events calendars and tasks are deleted. The funny think here is, if it comes closes to an event it still keeps me notifying that the event will happen.\nDid someone experience something similar? How can I prevent iCal from forgetting the events and calendars?\nI am working with Snow Leopard and iCal 4.0.4 and Office for Mac (but I do not use Outlook itself). Everything is stored locally and not synchronized with any iCloud, Google Calendar or services like that.\n\nA: Make sure that in your iCal settings all of the boxes about deleting past events are unchecked. \nAlso, if you have numerous devices' calendars syncing to your Mac/iCloud, make sure that in each device (i.e. iPad, iPhone etc) under calendar settings the \"delete events older than...\" are disabled.\n", "Q: Avoid restarting macbook pro with bootcamp Is there a way to use bootcamp to switch between Windows and OSX without restarting the laptop. I don't really want to buy any virtual software like VMWare or Parallels.\n\nA: Unfortunately, this is not possible. You can't run two operating systems at the same time without any extra software.\nWith that said, Parallels Desktop does exactly what you want to achieve, it runs the OS in a virtual mode, the only downside being it's shareware, therefore pricy. Using a third party software is however the only way to achieve what you're trying to do.\n", "Q: How to export a date range in Calendar I would like to export some of the events in one of my calendars. The export function will create a .ics file with the entire calendar, but I only want to export events within a specified date range. How can I do that?\n\nA: A workaround would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a temporary calendar from File>New Calendar.\n\n*Mark the calendars you want to export:\n\n\n*Depending on the time range you want to export select week or month view:\n\n\n*Go to the week or month you want to export, press ⌘A to select all events and ⌘C to copy them.\n\n*Select the temporary calendar:\n\nand press ⌘V to paste all previously copied events. \n\n*Export the temporary calendar as an ics file:\n\n\n*Delete the temporary calendar with Edit>Delete.\n\nA: Although jaume came up with an very easy workaround somebody might be looking for an even easier solution. Take a look at the Calex App which offers a little bit more features. For example Calex lets you export multiple calendars into one single file.   \n\nA: You can at least Drag and Drop single events out of the Calendar window.\n", "Q: How can I find exactly what files are included in my last Time Machine backup? I find that my Time Machine backup never passes an hour without backing up files, even if I haven't used the Mac.  I've excluded .Trash and Downloads under my user folder.  A typical hourly backup is 60-70MB, and I want to know exactly what files are being backed up here so I can possibly exclude them too.\nAfter backing up, the Indexing of the Backup takes an extremely long time, and I don't know which is the cause and which is the result, or if this is unrelated to my mystery files being backed up.\n\nA: More recent app (10.9+) that does the trick: TimeTracker\n\n\nA: You could try BackupLoupe: it will give you the size of each backup, the backed-up files and catalog the backups with colors to quickly identify the big ones.\n\nThere are also lists of files excluded by rule or that you add manually to exclusions:\n\n\n*\n\n*On OS X, what files are excluded by rule from a Time Machine backup?\n", "Q: Recover iPhone backup manually from iCloud I had the misfortune of a stolen iPhone 4 a few months ago. In the interim I've decided not to get a new iPhone.\nI can view my iCloud storage page and see there is a 1GB file there. There are random photos and two years worth of message history, amongst other odd bits and bobs I'm sure. I do not have a local backup.\nProblem: How do I recover my iPhone backup sitting in iCloud?\nI've looked all over and find no way of doing this without an iPhone. Surely there must be a way though, it is my data after all.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Unfortunately, you are very limited in what you can do with that backup. In fact, there is literally nothing you can do with an iCloud backup unless you restore the backup. This can be done, however, on any iOS device (as in iPhone, iPod, or iPad), that is at least the iOS version that the stolen device was on. For example, if the iPhone 4 was running iOS 6, you will only be able to restore to a iOS 6, or 6.1 device.\nIf you are on a Mac, you should have easy access to Calendars, Contacts, Notes, Reminders, and such data. If you are on a PC, you can access most of that by going to iCloud.com. This isn't really the data that you've backed up, though, and it's really data that is just \"synced\" through iCloud. Either way, Contacts, are typically pretty important. \nIf you own a Mac, you should be able to get your Photostream pictures by installing and opening Photostream. This doesn't capture videos, though. \nIf you do have an eligible iOS device that you can do a restore on, be sure to back up that device locally before wiping. It might also be advisable to make sure that device doesn't do a backup of the newly erased setup to iCloud. If you keep that iCloud account disabled on that device, you should have an easy restore from iCloud, and a backup in iTunes should something go wrong.\n\nA: I guess this is what you could do if someone you know could spare you an iPhone for a day or so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get an iPhone and take a backup of the same on your system - use iTunes to do that\n\n*Now (this is really critical and follow it at your own risk) log into your iCloud account on the phone and restore that phone while pointing to the iCloud backup. In this was you will have all of the iCloud data in that phone\n\n*Now use another computer (or at least another user account on the same computer) to take a backup of the phone with your data - don't use the same account as everytime iTunes takes a backup of your phone, it overwrites the previous one. So you risk a chance of loosing the data which originally came with the phone\n\n*Get a backup recovery software and install it on the computer which has your data backed up. \n\n\nSome available unofficial software or services are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Total Saver\n\n*myiCloudBackup.com\n\n*iPhone Backup Extractor\n\n*OpenSource tool iloot\n", "Q: iPhone 3G w/o SIM messaging app I would like to use our jailbroke iPhone 3G with NO SIM. Is it possible to use the built in messaging app that Apple supplies on this iPhone wit no SIM?  \nIs this possible to do or do I need to use one of the other free text apps?  If it's possible could some one please post the instructions.\nWhy is it that our iPad is able to use the messaging app but I can't with the NO SIM 3G?\nEdit:\nI previously thought I had the iPhone 3GS. I recently edited because I found I have the iPhone 3G (not S)\n\nA: Your iPhone 3G isn't eligible to upgrade to iOS 5+ which use iMessage, as a supplementary (or primary) means of messaging, and which does not require use of SMS (cellular transfer). \nAs a result, you will need to rely on a 3rd party app (that supports iOS 4) to do your messaging. A Google search revealed that there are still a number of texting apps that support iOS 4.3 (which your phone should support) such as:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textplus-free-text-group-texting/id314487667?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4\n\nA: Pairing Messages and Google Voice on that phone could really be a great combo if youre just using it as a texting tool. I would grab a free wifi finder app too to maximize your range.\n\nA: iPhone 3g can only be updated as far as iOS 4.2.1. Therefore you cannot use iMessage. I would say get Google Voice and try to emulate it that way, unfortunately you wont be able to send pic and video messages.\n", "Q: In a school library I have 30 iPads to set up for teachers to use in their classrooms. In a school library with 30 iPads on a cart.  Should one appleid be used for all 30 iPads?  I will be the only one adding the apps, and then the cart will be taken to classrooms.  The same apps will be on all iPads.  Would it be better to just create a genric appleid or an iCloud id, or what's the best way to do this?\n\nA: Apple has a tool, Apple Configurator, designed to help manage multiple devices in exactly this kind of scenario.  I haven't personally used it, but it sound like what you need.\n\nA: No - if you try to use one Apple ID on more than 10 devices without some sort of management software layer, you will end up getting that account locked. It's better to reach out to Apple (or a consultant) that does this to learn the benefits and drawbacks of managing a cart of devices.\nIf you wanted to ask a more specific follow on question or edit some details to make your situation a little more narrow (where in the world your deployment is based, what you've tried to solve the issue, etc..) it's hard to offer anything other than links to places to start doing research:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/education/resources/information-technology.html\nThe link above has videos explaining various enrollment strategies, how to use the configurator, white papers, volume purchase information (which means educational discounts) and more.\n\nA: For our iPad distros we are using two accounts:one Volume Purchasing Program account and one regular apple ID and Apple Configurator. \nExample: ipadcartVPP@company.com buys the VPP app codes from apple and I download the excel sheet with the redemption codes. Then I would redeem one of the codes on ipadcart@company.com to download the .ipa file. That .ipa file gets loaded into Configurator along with the excel sheet with all the codes(their basic license mgmt) and allows you to apply the profile(Prefs and Apps) to managed devices.\n\nA: why don't you try this..product\nhttp://www.maas360.com/\nMaaS360 provides a mobile device management solution and an enterprise appstore for managing apps\nDISCLOSURE: This author is affiliated with this product.\n\nA: You cannot use Apple ID in all those 30 devices. Instead, there are two ways in which you can achieve it.\nThe first method is using Apple Configurator. Apple Configurator is a tool that is available in Mac computers. With Apple Configurator, you can download apps from iTunes and can be deployed in devices if by hooking up the device with your Mac computer and deploying apps one by one.\nIf this sounds annoying, then there is a second option called Mobile Application Management (MAM). Enroll all the 30 devices in MAM and you can deploy apps remotely from another system.\nSome Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions, like Hexnode MDM, also comes with a built-in MAM. MDM provides more options of security like locking device and wiping it down, just in case you need it.\n", "Q: How can I run Warcraft III (a PowerPC app) on OS X Mountain Lion? When I tried to install Warcraft III I got this nice message that says:\n\nYou can’t open the application “Installer.app” because PowerPC applications are no longer supported.\n\nSo what's the best way to run Warcraft III on a Mountain Lion?\nThere are a few articles online regarding PowerPC apps, but I would like to have an answer here as well.\n\nA: Two ideas I can think of.  First, dual boot with OS X 10.6, which still supports Rosetta.  \nThe other is to obtain a copy of Snow Leopard Server, which had a license which allowed you to run it in a virtual machine.  (The license for normal SL did not allow you to run it in a VM.  Lion and Mountain Lion changed the license to allow it.) Then use Parallels or VMWare Fusion to run it.  However, I don't believe the graphic support is very good with guest OS X machines, so it may not run well. \nEven if you can find a way to install the app, IIRC Warcraft III was a PPC binary for the game as well, so you'd still be stuck.\n\nA: The short answer is: You can't run PowerPC apps on ML. But as already suggested there are alternatives. Parallels or VMWare for example and a Windows Virtual Machine may allow you to run a relatively old game with decent framerate. (if you have the Windows Version, tho Blizzard games used to be win/mac on the same CD). \nThere's no way to install Rosetta (to run PPC code) on a ML because there were lots of underlying changes that make this an impossible task. I don't know if people have found ways to do it, but it's certainly \"hacky\". \n\nA: If you can get a copy of Warcraft III installed on another Mac, you should be able to run it just fine under any version of OS X, including Mavericks (10.9).  The trick is finding a machine still running a version of OS X old enough to support the Rosetta environment.  For this, you will need a Snow Leopard or older version of the OS and an Intel machine.  Once you have it installed and updated to the very latest, you should be able to copy the entire Warcraft III directory from that machine to your current machine.  You may have to re-enter your CD code, but that should be the easy part.\nAnd yes, this has been tested.  I restored my copy of Warcraft III and the Frozen Throne expansion from an old backup to a 2014 retina MacBook Pro running Mavericks 10.9.4 and I was able to launch and get into a local game.\nUpdate: only local games will work under Mavericks and later.  This is because WC III uses OpenTransport for it's networking, but Apple has removed OpenTransport support starting with Mavericks.  If you only want to play against the AI, this won't be an issue.  But for everyone else, this is less than ideal. \n", "Q: How can I change calendar/contacts sync setting for iPhone? I recently upgraded to iTunes 11.0.1.12.\nWhen I plug my iPhone 4 (iOS 5.1.1) into the computer, I noticed that under the \"Info\" tab, \"Sync Contacts\" and \"Sync Calendars\" don't have any options displayed, and it give me the message:\n\nYour contacts (calendars) are being synced with your iPhone over the air from iCloud.Over-the-air sync settings can be changed on your iPhone. \n\nHowever, I do not know how to change those settings on my iPhone. What settings should I change to enable me to sync Contacts and Calendars through iTunes once again?\n\nA: If you go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > iCloud (should be the first account)  and scroll down to Contacts.  \nWhen you scroll to \"Contacts\" you must slide it off. I did this by sliding the \"Contact\" button from right to left and swiped away the green.  I was prompted to \"What would you like to do with the previously synced iCloud contacts on your iPhone.  I chose \"Keep on My Phone\". \nThen you can use iTunes like you used to do and select the Contacts you want to be synced. I prefer this way. \n\nA: This means that your iPhone calendar and contacts on your iPhone are synced with an Exchange server, a CalDAV/CardDAV server or with iCloud. \nYou can change your contact/calendar sync settings on your iPhone by navigating to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars.\n\nA: What changes then do you make?  I have always been able to sync my iPad, iPhone and outlook calendars.  Then one day I went to sync and it did not sync.  I checked my info on iTunes and it no longer gives me the option to sync my calendar with outlook.  It says \"Your contacts (calendars) are being synced with your iPhone over the air from iCloud.\"\nHow do I change that so I can sync again?\n\nA: The simple answer is that you turnoff iCloud syncing for the things you don't want iCloud to sync.. Turn off contacts and then in iTunes it now offers you manual sync options\n", "Q: I'd like OS X 10.8 to receive network notifications I've got some shell scripts that can send network notifications to Growl for Windows, and it's working fairly well. Can Notification Center on 10.8 (or iOS devices for that matter!) be configured to receive these? Does it even use Growl's layer 7 protocol at all?\n\nA: Mountain Growl will route Growl notification through Notification Center. This way your scripts could still send the network notifications to Growl and they will show up in Notification Center.\n", "Q: Where is my download from iTunes? I purchased 'Chris Hardwick Mandroid' SD Movie on iTunes.  I see it in Finder, and I see it in my Recently Added playlist... but I don't see it in my list of Movies or TV Shows on iTunes.\nFirst Question:  Am I too big of an idiot to consume such media on my Mac?\nSecond Question (seriously):  Where do I find my media in iTunes?!\n\nA: From the Recently Added playlist you should be able to right-click (or ctrl-click if you don't have a right mouse button) and choose Get Info. Under the Options tab on the Get Info pane there is a choice for Media Kind. If that choice is set to Movie (as it should be) then you should be able to see it in your Movies list. Can you show the list of all things in your Movies and sort by Date Added?\n", "Q: Is there a dashboard widget that has extended Unicode characters? I've been looking for a decent Unicode widget that allows access to some of the weirder characters like ✓ and ✗. \nDoes such a beast exist? I've tried a few and all of them seem kind of limited... Also, Apple's built-in character viewer doesn't indicate anything like HTML escape code or even Unicode number, I'd use that otherwise.\nThese ones I've tried:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Characterpal\n\n*Entitiy lookup\n\n*Asciitable\n\nA: I couldn't find one, unfortunately. If you know the codes (which you can easily find from the web) you can enable the Unicode Hex input from System Preferences>Language and Text>Input Sources (it's near the bottom). That way, when you hold ALT, you can enter a Unicode symbol number for that symbol to appear.\nExample: ALT+270E enters a ✎ pencil.\n", "Q: Mac OS X Server ignores remote HTTP connections, but accepts local ones I cannot get Mac OS X Server's web server to accept connections from other machines on the same LAN. This is on OS X 10.8.2, running on a Mac mini which originally shipped with Lion Server.\nI can connect to it from the server itself, such as by going to http://localhost or http://hostname.example.com in Safari.\nNotice that connecting via the box's domain name works. This is because:\n$ netstat -na | grep 80.*LISTEN\ntcp46      0      0  *.80                   *.*                    LISTEN \n\nThat is, Apache is listening on all interfaces, not just lo.\nIf I telnet server 80 from a client machine while doing a packet capture on both sides, I only see repeated TCP SYN packets. (server perspective, client perspective)\nDisabling the firewall in the Security and Privacy settings pane doesn't change the symptom.\nThe firewall configuration looks harmless to me. (Dumped via pfctl -sa.)\nI'm certain the problem isn't on the client side. I've tried accessing it from:\n\n\n*\n\n*a month old iMac over GigE\n\n*a 2 year old MacBook Pro over WiFi\n\n*a 5 year old netbook running Ubuntu 12.04 over GigE and WiFi\n\n\nThis server is headless, and I do all my work on it from client machines on the LAN, via both SSH and VNC. This means that while I am failing to connect to this server on TCP port 80, I am successfully using it on TCP ports 22 and 5900. This behavior is what caused me to start looking at the firewall configuration.\nHere's what the network looks like:\n\nThere are two network switches because this network is spread over two rooms, with one switch in each room and a single cable going between them. I ruled out the managed switch as the problem source with the WiFi test. I exonerated the dumb switch by temporarily running a long cable from the server to the managed switch.\nThe cable modem and the WiFi router (an AirPort Extreme) each have 4-port switches built in, but only one port on each is used, so no traffic goes through them that doesn't absolutely have to. The DHCP and caching DNS servers are turned off on both routers, since those duties are being done (successfully!) by the server in question. The AirPort is in bridging-only mode.\nAnd yes, I've rebooted the server. And the clients. And the routers. And the switches. :)\nMy best guess is that the problem stems from having upgraded this box from Lion Server. If so, a complete reinstall will fix this, but that goes against all of my Unix server management training. I want to fix this server in place, if I can.\n\nA: OS X actually has (at least) 3 firewalls. Since you've turned off the application firewall (in System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Firewall) and checked the Berkeley packet filter (pfctl -sa), I'm guessing it's the old ipfw that's doing the blocking. You can check with sudo ipfw show -- that'll list the active rules, along with counts of how many packets and bytes each one has applied to:\n$ sudo ipfw show\n01000 19228642 23229993542 allow ip from any to any via lo0\n01010        0           0 deny ip from any to 127.0.0.0/8\n[etc...]\n65534    23505     3467352 deny ip from any to any\n65535        0           0 allow ip from any to any\n\nIf your listing only shows rule #65535 (the allow rule at the end), my guess is wrong and you have to look elsewhere. If it does show other rules, you probably have a third-party firewall config program installed somewhere (I don't think the Apple-supplied ipfw config software is still there in 10.8); take a look in /Library/StartupItems and /Library/LaunchDaemons for things that might be relevant.\n\nA: Open Console.app and check /var/log/appfirewall.log. You will be looking to see whether the connection request even reaches the app firewall. If it does reach there AND is allowed next check both /var/log/apache2/access_log and /var/log/apache2/error_log to see whether the request is reaching Apache. If the request is reaching Apache then the problem is likely in your Apache configuration file(s).  If none of the above logs shows anything check the system.log for additional clues.\n", "Q: How do I set an empty search domain on Airport/Time Capsule My ISP supplies their own search domain via DHCP, which I don't want being passed on to my own devices. However, if you leave the field for 'search domain' empty on an Airpot/Time Capsule it will revert to the ISP default once the text box loses focus. Is it possible to override the value to empty?\n\nA: On the AirPort or TimeCapsule that is acting as DHCP and/or NAT, placing a period “.” in the Domain Name field will push a null domain name search to its DHCP clients…  \nIt does this by making yer DHCP clients’ treat hostnames as fully qualified…  That will not disable domain name searches on the DHCP clients if they are configured to use search domains…  \nBUT, it will eliminate having yer ISP’s domain name appended as an additional domain name search…  With the added benefit of slightly faster DNS resolutions eliminating parent and child domain searches… \n", "Q: Can Time Machine back up different data (or different exclusion lists) to different drives? Mountain Lion includes a feature to configure multiple Time Machine locations and to back up to those locations when they become available (plugged in external drives, accessible network drives, etc). Can 10.8 or any older version of OSX, possibly including third party software, be configured to back up different data to different locations?\nUse case: I have 100GB of storage available on a cloud storage server, and a 250GB external hard drive. I want everything on my computer except media (photos, videos, music) backed up to both of those locations. I have another much larger drive that is accessible less often that I keep backups of my media on. Currently I have Time Machine configured with an exception list for the media locations and it backs up to all three drives (dumbly in 10.7, but smartly when I upgrade to 10.8) and then I manually make a backup of all the media directories using rsync occasionally. I would love for the media backup to be automatic when I plug in the large drive.\n\nA: The short answer is no, but here is why and how the exclusions work when you pick different rules for two accounts.\nWhether you have one backup destination or two, the rules for multiple users is to combine the exclusions for each user with the exclusions from the system so that each user can exclude different things, but there is no \"inclusion\" mechanism to add something back that another user has denied.\nThere is a nice article on having multiple users and goes into more details on setting up multiple exclusion lists:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://pondini.org/TM/10.html\nIt's not going to save backup time or space as you asked, but perhaps drives can get larger and you could just have both drives hold the same content since incremental updates mean that unless a file changes, it only gets copied once to each destination, speeding backups for subsequent backups to each individual drive when it's connected.\nPulling one drive from rotation with two works well as the system just carries on with the drive connected and then when the further out of date drive mounts again, one of the next two backups will catch it up with all changes since it was last mounted during a backup. \n", "Q: Does the search in Finder need spotlight? I just reinstalled OS X Lion and turned off the spotlight immediately.\nI noticed that search in Finder stopped working. Is this because of disabling spotlight? Is there a way to get this back without turn spotlight on? I only need to search by file names.\n\nA: Finder's search, as well as many other programs (Alfred, Outlook, etc.) use Spotlight's index files. If you have Spotlight shut off, you won't be able to get Finder search working natively.\nThere are a few free third party apps that you can use to search for files without using Apple's system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find Any File\n\n*EasyFind\nThese two do not use spotlight's index files and should work independently.\n\nA: Spotlight is a search tool. So it needs an index. And that's what's build when there is a little black dot in the Spotlight icon.\nIt's like an index on a book. It's hard (if not impossible) to find a word without an index. Finder can't look for files if it has no index.  \nOnce Spotlight has build it's index, Finder will be able to search for files. If you want, you can disable it if you want.\nBUT, if you do so, new files won't be added to the index, so you won't be able to find them.\n", "Q: Can the new 2013 27\" iMac function like the Thunderbolt Display? The Thunderbolt display is a really cool external display for thunderbolt-enabled mac laptops, but the sad reality is, all those peripherals and that gorgeous display is useless when the laptop is gone.\nMy question is, will the new 2013 27\" iMac support peripheral passthru via thunderbolt to my 2012 Macbook Air like a Thunderbolt display would?\nI would have the following connected to the iMac\n\n\n*\n\n*Gigabit ethernet\n\n*External speakers\n\n*Wired keyboard\n\n*Wired mouse\n\n*USB microphone\n\n*USB printer\n\n\nWould the Macbook Air be able to use these?\nWhen the Macbook Air is connected, I'd essentially like it to operate just like the Thunderbolt display.\nWhen the Macbook Air is disconnected, I'd like the iMac to function as a normal iMac.\n\nA: For the display, yes:\n\nTarget Display Mode. In this mode your iMac can serve as a display for\n  another Mac. This is supported via the Thunderbolt port using a\n  Thunderbolt to Thunderbolt cable (not supported via a Mini DisplayPort\n  cable)\n\nsource: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5522\nFor the rest of the devices, theoretically not: \n\n7. When I have a Mac connected via the Apple Thunderbolt to Thunderbolt cable (2.0m) via Target Disk Mode or Target Display Mode,\n  do devices connected to that Mac become active on my computer?\nNo. The additional devices will become peripherals for the Mac in\n  Target Disk Mode or Target Display Mode. The additional devices do not\n  \"chain\" through the Mac and its other Thunderbolt port.\n\nsource: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5219#target\nHope this helps (wouldn't it be neat?)\n", "Q: How can I use one of the documents preview icon as the parent folder's icon in OS X? I organize my e-books and the supporting files in each folder. Is there any easy way to assign the parent folder's icon as the preview of the PDF file?\n\nA: As far as I know, it's not possible to do so dynamically. \nWhat you can do is change the icon manually (but then you have to do it for each folder of course...).\nOpen your icon with Preview. Then copy the image by using the build in copy/paste functionality. Select the whole image with cmd+ A and copy it with cmd+ C.\nThen open the 'Info' window (right-click and Get Info) of the folder and select the icon on the upper left corner. If you paste cmd+V the image, you'll see the folder icon got replaced by the image. \nAnd of course, there is an app for that.\n\nA: As far as I know this is not possible.\nConsider changing the icon manually via Preview using the method depicted below.\nOr, if you're using OS X Leopard or Snow Leopard, type this into Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder QLEnableXRayFolders 1\n\nThis will allow you to see inside folders whilst using Quick Look on them.\n", "Q: Using 3 External monitors on my macbook pro, problem with DVD player I am running 3 external monitors off of my macbook pro 10.6.8.

The video lags for a second.\nSince it is too hard to explain, I captured 16 seconds of video.  \nWhat could be the cause on this?\n\nA: If I've understood the video correctly, it's the long animation you're wondering what is? I don't see any other lag, please do correct me if I'm wrong.\nUsing the HTML5-version of YouTube, utilizes OS X's built in full screen mode.

However, it seems Time Machine also backs up information in the keychain.\nI was wondering if that means I should use an encrypted disk to store Time Machine backups. (assuming that the rest of the data on my Mac isn't that sensitive, to warrant encrypting the disk otherwise. But my passwords to login into various accounts, I don't want falling into wrong hands)\nAt the same time, I have read in some forums that encrypting backups sorta defeats the purpose - since that means I might not be able to access my backed up data when I need it. This is one such forum discussion. (The discussion also seemed to imply that if something goes wrong, getting back my data from an encrypted disk might be hard even if I know the encryption password. Is that true?)\nAlso, is performance a concern when using encrypted backups, assuming encryption is recommended? From what I understand, since the CPU is much faster than the disk, there should be no real performance hit. Yet, I have read on forums that Time Machine becomes really slow if encryption is turned on. Again, is this true?\nFinally, if an unencrypted Time Machine backup disk falls into the wrong hands, will my keychain data be accessible to only if the finder knows my Mac OS X password? Or are there ways to get that information even otherwise?\nTL;DR\nIs encryption recommended for Time Machine backups, assuming a very basic need for security of data from falling into wrong hands. In particular, I would like to restrict access to my keychain data using encryption, but only if it doesn't compromise my ability to access the backups when I really NEED them, and there isn't a major performance hit.\n\nA: To answer your first question about the keychain and whether you should encrypt backups: the passwords in your keychain are already encrypted, that's why you always have to type a password (by default your login password) to show stored passwords. So there's no immediate need to encrypt.\nOf course, you could add Time Machine encryption to provide a further layer of security. This is possible starting with OS X Lion and Mountain Lion (from http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1427):\n\nOS X Lion and Mountain Lion let you encrypt the Time Machine backup\nexternal drive using FileVault 2.\n\nFileVault2 also uses your login password, though. So if the bad guys are able to guess or crack that password, they will have also access to your keychain information. Choosing different passwords for login and for accessing your keychain would protect the keychain passwords in such an event.\nEither way, use strong passwords, password quality is of foremost importance to protect your data.\nEDIT:\nThe OP asked in a comment how to set different passwords for login and keychain. Here is how:\n\n*\n\n*Open Utilities>Keychain Access.\n\n\n*Right click each keychain and select 'Change Password for Keychain XYZ':\n\nIf you prefer to use your current password as keychain password and change your login password, log in using another account and change your account's password from System Preferences>Users & Groups. That will only change your login password, not your keychain password.\n", "Q: iMessage group members visibility I'm curious how the group visibility works with iMessage. \nI have a hunch that when sending with iMessage to a group of people, all these people will see each other in the group. Is my assumption correct?\nHowever, if one of these people is not using iMessage then the message will be sent as a regular text message and the group members will not see each other in the group. Correct assumption?\n\nA: TL;DR\n(1) Yes and (2) yes (but can be no depending on configuration).\n\n\n*\n\n*If all the recipients are on iMessage, then it will be an entirely group thing. Everyone sees everyone, and everyone gets all replies.\n\n*If you have Group Messaging disabled under Settings.app > Messages > Group Messaging, then they will send as individual text - replies will be separate. If the carrier you are with doesn't provide group messaging there will be no option for Group Messaging. It is disabled by default.\n\nNow, with the assumption that iMessage is on on your phone:\nIf you have Group Messaging disabled (or your carrier doesn't support it), then when you compose a text to two recipients (at least one off of iMessage) a thread, on your phone, called \"OutGoing\" will be created. It will then send out separate SMS messages to each user. Recipients won't be able to see who else you texted.\nIf you have Group Messaging enabled (note: MMS Messaging must be enabled for you to even see the \"Group Messaging\" option), and compose a text to two persons (at least one off of iMessage), then it will send a group text. Just like iMessage, everyone sees everyone, and everyone gets all replies. Again, the Group Messaging option will only be available if your carrier is compatible with the option. I believe AT&T and Verizon support Group Messaging. They may be the only ones. \nObviously, if everyone is on iMessage, like I stated above, everyone sees everyone, and everyone gets all replies.\n", "Q: MySQL server wont start For some reason, MySQL won't start anymore.

I have the following problem: When I run processes that consume a lot of memory, Mac OS X seems to refuse to release a large portion of the filesystem cache:\n\nIn fact, instead of letting go of the ~ 30 GB of inactive memory, it prefers to swap 45 GB (which were rising at the point in time captured in the picture).\nRunning purge freed a large portion of that memory, leading to ~ 15 GB of free memory and Mac OS X finally stopping to bug me with that really useless OOM dialog asking me to quit one of my GUI applications…\n\nIs there any way the kernel can be instructed to be less insisting when it comes to caching file I/O?\n\nA: It's hard to tell without access to your system or steps to reproduce your error, but in my experience, the OS is performing like any other UNIX when the swap device and root filesystem fills. The simplest way to avoid the dialog is ensure you have enough free space to make another swap file (they top out at 2 GB I believe on Mountain Lion).\nMost people like to have 25% (or more) free space since the OS optimizes hot files and defragments on the fly and these self-disable when free space becomes low to avoid churning the IO when there isn't space to write or many free places on the drive to choose for faster file access.\n\nOne notable difference between OS X and other UNIX is that the Apple OS does late page allocation to swap, so you don't see large swap files when they are not needed. For this, you can either disable swap entirely or ensure your drive has sufficient free space to handle whatever amount of swap you see in practice.\nI've not heard of anyone messing with the paging algorithm itself, but Apple has open sourced that part of the OS, so anyone who cares can make code level changes and run with it.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.opensource.apple.com/release/mac-os-x-1082/\nI would start with buying the next largest side storage drive and monitor your space usage to ensure you don't get less than 10 GB empty as a starter rule of thumb. If you're doing serious work, you might invest more in drive space to ensure you don't run out.\n", "Q: Non-recursive spotlight search? When using the Spotlight search at the top right of a finder window, I often want the search to be non-recursive, i.e. only look at files in that specific directory, not any directories within it. Is this possible?\n\nA: As far as I know, unfortunately it's not possible to do this.\nStrangely, I also set the 'Document Container' criteria within Spotlight and it wouldn't show any results at all.\nThis is extremely poor behaviour, I agree. You can give Apple feedback on OS X (from which you can post feedback on Spotlight) here.\n\nA: The command-line interface to Spotlight, mdfind, has no such capability.  (There is an -onlyin flag but empirically it's recursive.)\nSince it's extremely unlikely that the Finder would have more capability than the command-line interface, I think it's safe to say that this is not possible.  Sorry.  That does sound like it would be a very useful feature.\n\nA: Not a solution for using the graphical interface, but i've started using the following in terminal to get the desired effect:\nmdfind FOO | grep $PWD | grep -v ^$PWD/.*/.*$\n", "Q: Can Third-Button Paste be emulated on the Mac?

I am using a Windows XP VM with Parallels 8 under Mountain Lion. I have a remote desktop connection from XP that does not allow pasting from the clipboard, but typing works, of course. I have an AppleScript simulating as if I typed the clipboard. However, the Shift key is not held down for modified keys, even though all keyboard layouts are in sync otherwise. Also curiously, numeric characters don't go through while \"(\" is turned into \"9\". See the full example below.\nThis happens in script-typing into XP desktop apps too, RDC only motivates why I cannot simply paste the clipboard. But this is a problem of scripted keystrokes in Parallels!\nThis only happens for this script and even only some keys with the script, the shift key is synchronized otherwise.\nThe remote connection is not super fast, but low speed did not break the use of the script in other cases (when I did not need the XP VM).\nWhat is there to do?\nThis KB-article is about a similar shift-key issue from previous versions, even RDC-specific, but did not solve my problem:\nhttp://kb.parallels.com/en/9129\nHere is the script:\non run\n    repeat with theItem in (the clipboard)\n        tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke theItem\n        delay 0.01\n    end repeat\nend run\n\nThis is what I tried to copy and paste (by scripted typing):\n\n~!@#$%^&*()_+\nQWERTYUIOP{}|\nASDFGHJKL:\"\nZXCVBNM<>?\n`1234567890-=\nqwertyuiop[]\\\nasdfghjkl;'\nzxcvbnm,./\n\nThis is what I got, see the messed-up order of rows, even, and even the cursor was before the x in last full-length line, not at the end — somehow it jumped to the beginning of a row before typing more.\n\n`1234567*90-+\nqwertyuiop[]\\\nasdfghjkl;'\n-=\nqwertyuiop[]\\\nasdfghjkl;'\nzxcvbnm,/\nxcvbnm,./\n`\n\n\nA: It's a problem that i have brought to their attention on multiple occasions.  and as of right now, they still haven't even fixed the problem in v9 betas.  so, if this is a deal breker for you (as it was for me), keep using parallels v7.  it's the last one that they have that applescripting still works properly in.\n", "Q: Can an iPhone backup folder be retrieved after deletion on Windows?

Operating system do not delete exact files. Only delete the file references. If you're lucky, OS do not replace your old file's partition with a new file; so you can recover.\niOS only backs up to iCloud and to iTunes, so unless you have another copy of that backup or another computer the device has synced to, you might be left with data recovery on the PC.\nIs the iOS device still around to make a new backup?\n\nA: in Windows 7, iTunes backup are stored in: \\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup, unless you moved it or made a copy anywhere else. Using undelete software doesn't always work, as Windows starts to overwrite deleted files in time, to recycle space - if you do try to undelete, I suggest you stop using the partition it was on, to maximise your chance of finding something. Try the Reincubate Recover Files, it might help to recover your backup - it also has a deep scan mode for hard to recover files so try that as well.

He was surprised and asked me the technical reason.\nSo I would like to know. It's strange because Filevault is at the software level while RAID is at the hardware level.\n\nA: The previous answer I gave here was wrong (as is bmike's answer). \nThe previous answer I gave was that if you have this as a problem, a workaround is to create an encrypted disk image that covers the entire AppleRaid set. This works, in theory, but is so horribly slow (like more than 10x as slow as the raw disk access) that it is basically unusable, which led me to look at the diskutil command line utility in more detail. And what do you know --- you CAN do what is wanted, it just takes some work. You have to do it through the command line, and even there you can't do it with the simplest commands, but it can be done and it is 100% legitimate Apple supported, not some weird hack.\nSo, let's assume you have your Apple Raid volume, which you have created somehow, either through Disk Utility or through the command line. \nNote: This process will format your RAID and encrypt it. Backup any data you want to keep (at least twice) before proceeding. \nThe first thing we need is to know the low-level OS identifier for the Apple Raid volume of interest, so type:\ndiskutil list\n\nwhich will give you a list of the various hard drives, partitions and logical hard drives (eg Apple RAID volumes) on your system. Look at the list and figure out, based on name, size, whatever, which is the Apple RAID volume we wish to encrypt. Make sure you get the RIGHT identifier, otherwise you'll destroy some other volume. It's wise, when doing this, to disconnect (manually --- pull out the cables!) all hard drives not relevant to the problem, including, most obviously, your backup drives!\nSo the list tells us the device of interest is, say, disk7\nNext we want to create a Core Storage LVG (Logical Volume Group) wrapper around the device. I'm not going to claim I understand Core Storage terminology, and why they use a different word for everything compared to Apple RAID, but far as I can tell, the LVG is essentially Core Storage's version of a logical hard drive. So type:\ndiskutil cs createLVG BackupImacLVG disk7\n\nBackupImacLVG is the name we are giving to the logical hard drive we're creating.\nThis command will take a few seconds, then spit out a long string which is is the \"name\" (the UUID) of the LVG we have created. We use it in the next step.\nWe're not done. We now need to create the equivalent of a partition (which Core Storage calls a Logical Volume) on this logical hard drive. \nHere is the next command:\ndiskutil cs createLV 8C5AED3-0CCF-4155-8E3D-DF7D9E68EE7B JHFS+ BackupImac 100% -stdinpassphrase\n\nIn the command above: \n    8C5AED3-0CCF-4155-8E3D-DF7D9E68EE7B\nis the LVG UUID we were just told (make sure you use your own), and \n    JHFS+\nis the file system we want to create in the partition. \n    BackupImac\nwill be the name of the volume created in this partition. \n    100%\nsays how much space we want to give to this partition. (There are a few different ways to specify sizes, but most people will probably use 100%). \n    -stdinpassphrase\nsays that we want to use encryption. \nThe command line will then put up a prompt of:\nPassphrase for new volume:\n\nYou enter the password, and you're done. (Note none of the helpful Apple FileVault UI here! No offering to save your password for you with Apple, no second request for the password to make sure you typed it correctly!)\nThe end result of all this is exactly what you would hope for and expect. An encrypted volume with all the performance of the previous AppleRAID volume. (And if you look at the diskutil man page, you will see that they explicitly list Apple RAID volumes as supported targets for diskutil cs createLVG, so this isn't some strange edge case that isn't officially supported.)\nDisk Utility.app doesn't update its UI (it's really bad in this respect --- has been an ongoing problem in OSX) so quit it and restart it. You'll now see, along with your RAID slices, a new \"hard drive\" called BackupImacLVG (or whatever you called it) along with a partition called BackupImac (or whatever you called it), with a format of \"Encrypted Logical Partition\".\nOne thing to be aware of. The disk is mounted during the creation process without asking for a password (you gave the password in the command line). \nRight after you are done, you may want to unmount the volume, power down the hard drives of the AppleRAID volume, power them on again, and see what happens. If you have done everything correctly, once all the slices of the Apple RAID have spun up and been detected by the OS, a window should appear on the screen asking you for the password so that the disk can be mounted.\n\nA: The answer from Maynard Handley above still holds true but with APFS there are now more easier ways to do this. CoreStorage also doesn't work on APFS since it's made for their fusion drives. APFS, on the other hand, is for SSD storage. \nYou can even do it over the Disk Utility GUI: \n\n\n*\n\n*Create the RAID set like you would usually do through Raid Assistant, but select APFS. \n\n*Then right-click on the APFS Volume (not the RAID set), hit \"Create APFS Volume\".\n\n*Select APFS (encrypted) from the menu and give it a password\n\n\nTada, you now have an encrypted APFS volume on top of your RAID set. If you want you can go ahead and remove the default non-encrypted one. \nIf you prefer the command line, diskutil apfs is used for interacting with apfs volumes. eg, diskutil apfs list:\n+-- Container disk4 675DEF26-4DCB-428A-8B96-6232445EF9C9\n    ====================================================\n    APFS Container Reference:     disk4\n    Size (Capacity Ceiling):      30877155328 B (30.9 GB)\n    Capacity In Use By Volumes:   73904128 B (73.9 MB) (0.2% used)\n    Capacity Not Allocated:       30803251200 B (30.8 GB) (99.8% free)\n    |\n    +-< Physical Store disk3 8FE0DEAB-F928-4808-A90A-228B389B2EA5\n    |   ---------------------------------------------------------\n    |   APFS Physical Store Disk:   disk3\n    |   Size:                       30877155328 B (30.9 GB)\n    |\n    +-> Volume disk4s2 443DB768-782B-47DC-B3C4-71E42D045F3A\n        ---------------------------------------------------\n        APFS Volume Disk (Role):   disk4s2 (No specific role)\n        Name:                      TestVolume (Case-insensitive)\n        Mount Point:               /Volumes/TestVolume\n        Capacity Consumed:         974848 B (974.8 KB)\n        FileVault:                 Yes (Unlocked)\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Create the Raid set\n\n\ndiskutil appleRAID create mirror RaidTest apfs disk2 disk5 (...etc)\n\n\n\n*Add the encrypted volume\n\n\ndiskutil apfs addVolume disk4 APFS FooSecure2 -passphrase hello\n\n-- \nWith APFS volumes it can get a bit confusing but basically:\n\n\n*\n\n*disk4: APFS container on top of disk3 (see diskutil apfs list under \"physical store disk\")\n\n*disk3: The virtual Apple RAID volume (see diskutil appleRAID list under \"device node\")\n\n*disk2 / disk5: The actual physical drives that are part of the RAID set (see diskutil appleRAID list and diskutil list, and notice \"physical\") \n\n", "Q: protecting keychain data when using Time Machine I plan to use Time Machine to back up by data.\nIf the backup is not encrypted, can someone with access to the TimeMachine disk access my keychain passwords? Do they at least need to know my system login password in order to be able to do this?\n\nA: Keychain files are password protected, your login password is required to access their content. In the file itself only passwords and the content of secure notes are encrypted so a potential attacker could at least read the URLs and the associated login names for web accounts etc.\nFor details about Keychain see Wikipeda and the pages referenced from there.\n", "Q: Can't adjust volume/play music on iPhone 4 For some reasons I can't adjust the volume on my iPhone 4 anymore. Whenever I press it the popup showing the bell is shown but not the bar indicating the .\nI can't adjust the volume at all.\nAlso playing music in the musicplayer doesn't work anymore. The play-symbol is shown but I just can't hear a thing.\nDoes anyone have a clue what is going wrong?\n\n\nA: This might be caused by several things, one of them being your phone believing it's connected to an external speaker through the 30-pin connector. When your phone believes it's connected to an external speaker, it assumes the speaker controls the volume, so you can't control the volume. In addition to that, the phone will attempt to transmit any audio through the 30-pin connector. I can't really think of any solution, other than trying to connect and disconnect from a charching cable or docking station, or try a restore.\nI assume you've already attempted to reboot the phone, another thing you could try is to connect it to some headphones with the mini-jack port and see if you're able to control the volume with them plugged in. If you have a cotton swab that can fit in the 30-pin connector, you can also try to clean it (do NOT use water, soap or acid, simply a dry, clean swab).\nIf nothing helps, I suggest you hand it in for a check-up at the nearest Apple Retail store.\n\nA: The other answer is correct in saying that it thinks it is plugged into something.  It could either be the headphone jack is busted, or more likely, you disconnected the iPhone from your computer without ejecting it.  \nA simple fix (hopefully) is to plug the iPhone into your computer and make sure it can be viewed in iTunes.  Once that happens, eject the iPhone and attempt to change the volume.\nIt worked for me.\n*you can also access your general settings and do a settings reset which won't delete any media, apps, or data but obviously will force you to realign and chance your phone with your preferences. When I faced this issue I found it to be the easiest way to resolve the problem.\n\nA: You can try using the Assistive Touch which is found by going to:\nSettings -> General -> Accessibility -> AssistiveTouch\n\nTurn that on and you should find a dot looking like this:\n \nClick on it, and go to Device and then try turning the volume up and/or down.\n\n\n\nA: I found a totally bizarre solution to the problem where on earphones, audio worked fine, but on the iPhone 4s speaker no app audio and no music. Could not adjust volume, icon appeared without slider.\nMy fix (I think): was to re-setup \"Find iPhone\" (the lost iPhone app) activate it and then page find the phone. I got sound out of the iPhone speaker and problem has not recurred - been about 10 days now.\nNone of the other things worked: changing cable connector, cleaning and so forth.\n\nA: I just fixed the same issue with my iphone, to fix it i use wd-40 + brush.

After that clean up connector from wd-40 and it's works great:)\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem (volume on earphones only, no speaker audio control) and tried the \"find iphone app\" solution mentioned above.

I have two iPhone 4 locked by the original carrier. I can't get the factory unlock because this carrier don't provide this service.\nI try to unlock via software but I can't, because the baseband (modem firmaware) are 04.12.02 (iOS 6.0.1) and 04.11.08 (iOS 5.0.1). Is not possible that I use Gevey, for the basebands. So, I think that I need wait for other new solution or maybe Apple unlock the all generation of iPhone 4.\nIf you know, other solution for me, please, help me. Because right now, I have only two iPod touch.\nSo, is possible that Apple unlock the all generation of iPhone 4?\n\nA: As far as I know, you can't unlock with Apple after you've purchased an iPhone.\nIn the US, the laws regarding cellphone unlocking haven't changed, but a Library of Congress exemption to the law has recently not ben renewed so you might only legally unlock if your carrier allows.\n\nA: The carrier lock is imposed by... the carrier. I don't think Apple will ever remotely unlock devices, so you must look for other ways to do it. If your phone is from AT&T and have more than one year and the customer is in good standing, you can request the carrier unlock for the device.\nApple's software clearly consults the carrier database for IMEI to determine which devices should be carrier-locked and which have SIM slots that are baseband unlocked, but Apple doesn't actually input devices into this database (unless you consider them as an agent to the Cell companies when you buy a locked or unlocked phone from Apple and initiate service with your carrier of choice).\n\nA: Well I actually find the att unlocking site to be useful, had a present from states, and it is just locked to ATT, I personally think it's worth the money to unlock the phone on that site.\n\nA: try attiphoneunlocking.com, I have unlocked my 4s over there, took me 4 hours after sending the imei number.\n", "Q: Applescript giving error 1728 when checking if file exists I'm trying to make compressing a video file using HandBrake easier through applescript and have been basing most of the code off of templates I've found.\nAt this point in the code, the user has specified the source file and the destination folder.\nInstead of HandBrakeCLI just blindly overwriting a file with the same name in the destination folder, I wanted Finder to do a check and, if a file with the same does already exist in the destination folder, then I wanted to have the filename appended with the current date and time before the extension.\nEverything worked fine until I started adding the \"if exists\" code.\nHere's the chunk of code:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set newFilepathPOSIX to POSIX path of dest_folder\n    set newFilepathPOSIX to newFilepathPOSIX & \"video.mp4\"\n    -- Check if file with same name exists\n    if exists file newFilepathPOSIX then\n        display dialog \"There is already a file named \\\"video.mp4\\\".

I continue to get this message and don't know how to fix:\n\nCouldn't start Dropbox\nThis is usually because of permissions error. Errors can also be caused by your home folder being stored on a network share.\n\nI am the only person using this Mac and I don't have a network so this message doesn't make sense to me.\nHow can I get Dropbox to work for me?\n\nA: Are you an administrator? If you are, try Chown and Chmod\nType the following into Terminal:\nsudo chown -R yourUsername /Users/yourusername/Dropbox\nsudo chmod -R 700 /Users/yourusername/Dropbox\nIf that doesn't work I'd run diskutil repairPermissions /\nIf those don't work, I would reinstall Dropbox.\n\nA: From http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20130315064419386\n\nIt turns out that Dropbox has a hidden feature to fix such things. Open the Dropbox preferences, click on Account, then press the Option key. The Unlink This Computer button will change to Fix Permissions. Click that button and let Dropbox go through your files.\n\n\nA: I had same problem. This helped me to fix issue:\nRemove hidden dropbox folder '.dropbox' in user's root folder (Users/YourUsername/.dropbox)\nYou can do it by running this command in terminal:\nsudo rm -r .dropbox\n\nThen simply erase everything what is left in Applications folder and make a fresh install.\nI found this solution here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6318381\n\nA: I saw the same error message and had the same issue where Dropbox wouldn't start on my laptop so I couldn't access the hidden Fix Permissions feature. I tried fixing the permissions manually with Terminal. I also tried uninstalling and installing. I also tried removing the .dropbox folder in my root folder. Nothing worked.\nFinally, unlinking and relinking my laptop remotely via the Dropbox website fixed it. When I started Dropbox again, I signed in and my Dropbox folder started syncing again. Article on Dropbox's help site walks through the steps and has suggestions for how to relink the files if the Dropbox location has changed.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Try starting Dropbox using the command line.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal (search for 'Terminal' in Spotlight).\n\n*Type cd /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/MacOS then press Return.\n\n*Type ./Dropbox then press Return.\n\n*Report back with any error messages.\n\n\nIf you want to try something else while you are waiting for us to get back to you, repeat the above commands, with the exception of open Dropbox. Instead, continue on with the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type cd /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/MacOS/. (Just press Return at the end of every command...)\n\n*Type ls -la. You should see four records. We are interested in the bottom two. To the left of \"Dropbox\" and \"python\", you should see -rwxr-xr-x. These are the permissions for the files. If the pattern you see doesn't match what I have posted here, there is a problem with the permissions. (If so, report back here for the next step. If not, keep going through this list.)\n\n*If the permissions were fine in the previous step, we can check a few other places. Type cd ../ to return to the above directory.\n\n*Type cd Frameworks.\n\n*Type ls -la. The top two files (with actual names) should have the permissions drwxr-xr-x.

On our 10.6.8 Mac Mini Late 2009 Edition, we have 4 users, 3 of which are in regular use. One is mine, let's call it 'a'. The second one is someone else's, let's call it 'b'. The third one we both use, let's call it 'c'. a and c have administrator rights. The unused is the owner.\nSo, the 'a' account is kind of slow sometimes, but it's what you'd expect after almost 5 years of usage. But here's the deal. 'b' and 'c' often behave much slower than that (takes 2-5 minutes to complete login). Sometimes they're as fast as 'a', but that's seldom.\nSo yeah, whaddya think about this? Why does this happen? And if you know why, how can I fix it?\n\nA: Check your login items. Have a look in System Preferences->Users & Groups->Login Items, and delete anything you don't need starting at login. Also try cleaning up your Desktop, so the computer doesn't have to load all those little tiny images when it's busy trying to do other things. Also check if there are any launch agents running at login. (Look in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ for launch agents specific to your user. To find this folder, press Shift-Command-G, and enter the above path.) You'll see things like com.skype.c2c_service.plist. You should be able to work out whether they belong to apps that you want starting at login. (If not, delete the files.)\n", "Q: How to fix Magic GarageBand missing files? I hadn't used the Magic GarageBand feature before today (I generally don't use GarageBand that often) and when I went to try it, everything seemed to work until I clicked Open in GarageBand in the lower right corner. When I do that I always get an error similar to: \n\nI tried it with most of the generas, and all produce a similar error. \nI reinstalled iLife '11, which didn't fix it. I tried manually uninstalling all of GarageBand (including the loops and instruments folders), then reinstalling iLife '11 and still have no change. Checked for updates in the App Store and it is running 6.0.5.\nI searched around a little for those files and didn't find anything.\nUpdate: I am running OS X 10.8.2 and if I log in as a new user it works fine. So it is probably an issue with my library folders . . .\n\nA: The clue that explains how to fix your issue is that the applications works in a brand new user account. If it were a problem where the files were truly missing or a bug in the app - you would expect the same error in a new account. Unfortunately knowing that the problem lies in your library isn't much help due to the large number of files exist in most library folders.\nTo fix this, several different paths could be taken:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can import the actual files into the new account from the old account and side step pinpointing which file is problematic.\n\n*You can call the engineers that have the source code (AppleCare in this case) and see if they have a knowledge base explaining which file or files or directory needs to be cleared from your library to avoid doing the work involved for one of the other DIY choices.\n\n*Do a search of your library files (I would do a binary search - eliminating half of the files each pass - or as close to half as you can manage without software to automate tracking which files were deleted and which were not) and testing to see if the error persists after you have removed one or more files from ~/Library\n\n*Use a tool like fs_usage to try to track each file the GarageBand app opens in hopes of isolating the ones from ~/Library that it needs to have reset to default.\n\n*Hope that something like user permissions in the Library folder can be seen to be off and adjusting them by hand (Disk Utility won't repair your home folder permissions or look deep in ~/Library to fix things sadly) or try throwing away simple things in ~/Library like the GarageBand plist files and cache directories.\n\n\nAgain, it's a bit like searching for a needle in the haystack and I realize this isn't the same as telling you \"file X and cache directory Y are the culprit\" since I don't actually have that level of detail on iLife 11 files.\nHopefully this will help you or someone else in narrowing down how to track corruption in a user account enough to decide to call the vendor or just spend the time you need to move music, photos, documents over to the new account and just hope the error doesn't crop up again. \nI'd quit GarageBand app, make a back up of my system and then move these files/folders to the trash:\n/Users/whatever/Library/Caches/com.apple.garageband\n/Users/whatever/Library/Preferences/com.apple.garageband.LSSharedFileList.plist\n/Users/whatever/Library/Preferences/com.apple.garageband.LSSharedFileList.plist.lockfile\n/Users/whatever/Library/Preferences/com.apple.garageband.cs\n/Users/whatever/Library/Preferences/com.apple.garageband.plist\n/Users/whatever/Library/Preferences/com.apple.garageband.plist.lockfile\n/Users/whatever/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.garageband.savedState\n\nIf that doesn't remedy the issue, then I'd call Apple if I had AppleCare or could visit a genius bar and then just hand migrate my user files to a new account. The latter should take less than 20 minutes to plan and the files can copy while you are eating dinner. Having a good backup is mandatory for any delete / trial / hand migration just in case you find something you forgot to migrate days or months later.\n\nA: If you open Activity Monitor, then select GarageBand you can click \"Inspect\", then \"Open Files and Ports\". If you open GarageBand, and then try to run Magic GarageBand, it will try to open all the files needed for it. You can do this in both user accounts, and copy and paste the text into this diff checker. Any files that are different can then be copied across from the user account that works to the user account that doesn't work.\n", "Q: How do I take screen shots on DVD movies and protected content? I saw this awesome movie that I watched on DVD and wanted to take a screen shot of it, but when I did, it was transparent. I could only see my desktop taken but not the movie. Is there a specific program or hack that could let me take a screen shot of that content? I tried every screen shot software, but still leaves it transparent.\n\nA: This is deliberate from Apple and you will not be able to take screen shots using DVD player.\nYou can either use VLC and then a screen shot program (Cmd-3 and Cmd-4 works for me), or transcode your DVD to a QuickTime movie using Handbrake (which may take too long for you to find it interesting).  The latter will allow you to use QuickTime player which can do quite a bit.\n\nA: If you go to control & click 'use current frame as jacket picture'. Then click stop, your selected frame should come up - no matter where you stop the film from now on this still is what will show, that's what 'jacket picture' means. \nTake a screenshot of the Jacket Picture & it should come up on your desktop like normal!\n\nA: You should be able to capture screen shots by playing the movie in VLC and pressing alt+cmd+S. This is a more detailed guide for the windows version of VLC, but it should apply for the mac version as well!\n", "Q: Keystrokes getting eaten randomly I have a weird problem on my 2011 MacBook Pro 15\" running OS X 10.8.2. \nEvery now and then - say every two days - the system starts to ignore most of the keys I press for 2-3 minutes. It's like processing of keystrokes becomes incredibly slow. If I wait for ten seconds between each key, what I type is processed completely; otherwise kys wl b msng rndomly. \nThe system is not overloaded in any way when this happens. I'm usually writing something and this comes out of the blue.\nHas anybody experienced the same, or could point me to some resources? I'm having a hard time coming up with a good Google query for this problem. \nIt is possible this was introduced by the 10.8 upgrade but I'm not 100% sure.\nI managed to run top while this occurred again and the only thing that was runnng that usually isn't is Google's ksfetch. Will post more info if I catch it again.\n\nA: There can be two reasons: software or hardware.\nSoftware\nThis is most likely caused by the CPU being overloaded, so the kernel is throttled. That means only number of samples that are processed for a specific period to avoid overheating to prevent the crash.\nTo confirm that, run the following command in Terminal:\nsudo fs_usage | grep -v 0.00\n\nwhich should show something like:\nTHROTTLED  0.015030   kernel_task\n...\nTHROTTLED  0.019601   coreduetd\nTHROTTLED  0.031014   kernel_task \n...\nTHROTTLED  0.014947   kernel_task\n\nwhich means your kernel being throttled which may result in such unexpected behaviour (see also: Why kernel may be throttled?).\nI had this problem when my system was eating t letter (for all the apps) and CPU sensors (in iStat) were over 90˚\nTo solve the problem, check the above command fs_usage and kill unnecessary processes. If it's web browser with too many tabs and a lot of ads and JS scripts in the background, close unnecessary tabs.\nThere is also a chance that it's caused by I/O throughput (disk access) and your storage (e.g. SSD) may be reaching its lifespan.\nHardware\nIf keystrokes are eaten consistently (like the same letter over and over again), this could be physical keyboard issue.\nBefore blame the hardware, you should try to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset NVRAM.\n\n*Reset the System Management Controller (SMC).\n\n\nIf that won't work, you should arrange appointment at a Genius Bar.\nFor temporary workaround, see: How to deal with non-working key on the keyboard?\n\nA: FWIW: I'm having the same problem on my late-2011 11\" MacBook Air. Every now and then some of the characters on the keyboard will simply stop responding.\nMy current theory is that it is a problem with overheating, because it only happens when using the laptop keyboard (and never with an external keyboard) and it only happens when the laptop is actually on my lap and never when it is on a desk or table or other flat surface with adequate ventilation.\n\nA: The internal keyboard is actually on USB. This suggests something else is hogging the USB.  On my Retina MBP the other thing on that bus is the Bluetooth controller.\n\n\n*\n\n*Any other USB peripherals? iPad or iPhone connected?\n\n*Anything hooked up on Bluetooth? Mouse perhaps?\n\n*Any errors for either of the above in Console? Any other high frequency errors?\n\n*Go to System Preferences -> Accessibility -> Keyboard and confirm that Sticky Keys and Slow Keys are off.\nThere was a spate of reports of similar problems around 2009 which I think were fixed by a Keyboard Firmware upgrade, but that should be bundled with 10.8. Sorry I can't find a conclusive answer in this case.\n\nA: Had the same problem - MacBook Air keyboard eating letters, mainly \"ertyuio\". Especially at login.... After looking for many solutions, one had worked:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install any new keyboard via System preferences > Keyboard > Input sources.\n\n*Restart and delete the keyboard you've just installed, if not needed.\n\n\nWorked like a charm! Hope it will do the same for you!\n\nA: We have a late '09 iMac with a USB Aluminum keyboard that had been working fine until a few days ago.  Then it started to lose random keystrokes.\nSome experiments this morning finally revealed the problem/solution:\nAfter a reboot (to get out of Target Drive mode) the Aluminum keyboard (ALkb) didn't register at all, though a spare Bluetooth kb (BTkb) worked fine.  After re-plugging ALkb into a powered USB hub, it worked, but after a while we noticed it dropped keys.  A different USB kb, from an older Mac Pro (MPkb), behaved the same way, though this one did work plugged directly into the iMac's leftmost (from the back) USB port.\nSurprisingly, the ALkb did register and work when plugged into the iMac's rightmost USB port, though it still dropped keys.\nThe BTkb didn't drop any keys.\nOn a hunch I unplugged the Firewire 800 cable from the back of the iMac, even though it was inactive (not communicating with the attached Mac Pro), and suddenly both ALkb and MPkb worked without dropping keys.  In addition, the ALkb now worked plugged directly into the iMac's leftmost USB port (the middle two ports were being used).\nAt least in my case, the inactive but plugged-in Firewire 800 cable somehow interfered with the proper functioning of the iMac's USB ports.  So the admonition to unplug all unneeded cables is well-based.\n\nA: I found that the keyboard trick mentioned by Pablo worked for me sometimes.However, it take a little longer (and interrupts my typing flow) to execute. The problem seems to still come back for me.\nAnother faster, temporary trick, is holding down all the bad keys FGHJK for a few seconds and then letting up. For some reason, pushing them down together and then letting up (and then maybe quickly toggling those keys until I get a response) will cause them to work again long enough for me to finish the sentence. Someetimes I can get a response as soon as I lift up. I suspect it has something to do with the keyboard buffer for those keys filling up. \nI also have the onscreen keyboard installed (Keyboard-->Show Keyboard and Emoji in Menu Bar).\nIf the problem happens too frequently, I then can explore the longer term keyboard install/uninstall trick. However, because it requires a reboot I usually just plug in an external keyboard.\n\nA: I experience this issue on macbook pro 2015 with macos sierra 10.12.1.\nIt happens few times a day.\nOccasionally some keyboard characters are eaten, and sometimes the force (deeper) click on touchpad is not working and also multifinger gestures are not working. \nThen it can get even worse so that the mouse pointer stops moving at all.\nSometimes the OS is able to recover from the behaviour after 2-3 minutes, other times I have to hard reboot the macbook.\nIn the sudo fs_usage | grep \"THROTTLED\" I can see many different processes being throttled, but CPU is well below 100% all the time.\nI disabled Spotlight indexing and also tried sudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0, but the problem keeps emerging.\nupdate: \nso few hours later after one reboot the built-in touchpad and keyboard were not detected by OS at all. this suggest I actually face a hardware issue (possible the internal connection cable has some problem).\n", "Q: A modern and faster alternative to Disk Inventory X Disk Inventory X was kind of nice, but it is painfully slow.\nAre there any modern and faster alternatives?\nI only care about the disk space, and not about the file type stats and about the graph which Disk Inventory X displays.\n\nA: Starting with macOS Sierra, macOS comes with an built in app from Apple called Storage Management, which is a part of the System Information app. In different tabs it shows you the largest apps installed, as well as a folder viewer with their sizes listed. A special tab shows the largest files over all of your folders, which I find very practical.\nTo launch Storage Management open Spotlight Search by hitting ⌘ Command Space, type \"Storage Management\" and hit ⏎ Return.\nPros:\n\n*\n\n*Free,\n\n*Fast,\n\n*Provided by Apple, so it knows what it's doing.\n\nYou can find more information here.\n\nA: OmniGroup offers a free utility called OmniDisksweeper which lists files/folders sorted by size. \n\nOmniDiskSweeper is really great at what it does: showing you the files on your drive, in descending order by size, and letting you delete them easily! It scans your disks as quickly as possible and shows you the facts — if a file doesn't make the cut to stay, just click the big Delete button and be done with it. It's a fast, easy way to find those large files cluttering up your drive and clearing them out for new, better things. Make sure you want them gone, though. There's no going back\n\n\nA: Daisy Disk seems to be faster, but costs money. This process will always take longer than you want, though (I don't think OSX allows access to disk index files).\nYou can try one of the Linux based tools, such as PhileSight and see what happens too. Will be alot quicker if it works.\n\nA: I can heartily recommend ncdu if you're looking for a text (ncurses) based alternative. One of the fastest I've found.\n\nA: Use onboard tools:\n\nStep 1: Open Finder\nStep 2: In the menu bar select View → as List\nStep 3: In the menu bar, select View → Show View Options\nStep 4: Check the box next to Calculate all sizes\n\nSource: https://9to5mac.com/2016/07/01/how-to-show-size-folders-finder-list-view-mac/\n\nA: I think Disk Inventory is as fast or slow as any of the others. If the disk is big, it's slower than on a little one, and of course, on an SSD it is really fast. Although it is from 2006, I think it isn't bad coded, and it still works on my 10.9.\nIt gives more info than you need, but you can ignore that, as long as you find what you need. I guess what takes time is the reading of the disc, an app without the details of kind of info won't, as far as I think, really take much less.\nI am using it for ages now, there was a time in Mavericks it didn't work, now it goes well. I recommend GrandPerspective, it seems to make the same (with more alternatives which you anyhow don't seem to need), but is fresher .\nGrandPerspective: http://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net\n\nA: Disk Inventory X doesn't work on Big Sur anymore... :(\nI just installed Disk Space Analyzer from the App Store and it's free and works like a charm on Big Sur.\n\n\nA: Thanks to brew formulae,\nI'd recommend ncdu (https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ncdu) for users who like a command line tool\nand baobab (https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/baobab) for users who like a graphical user interface.\ninstallation commands for quick copy-paste:\nncdu\nbrew install ncdu\n\nsample screenshot for ncdu:\n\nbaobab\nbrew install baobab\n\nsample screenshot for baobab:\n\n\nA: The top alternative according to alternativeTo (as well as my own sample usage) is JDiskReport. \nThe thing I liked most about it is that it shows a clear status of the ongoing scan, as well as a time estimate for when it is expected to finish. The others I tried at best just show a \"spinny\" and you have no idea if the program is stuck or what. \nThis was actually a game changer in my case for two reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*I realized I had an 8TB mounted network share those programs were scanning, which would have taken forever (assuming they didn't crash / run out of memory before).\n\n*I had one folder with millions of files in it, which basically chokes out all such tools, but at least now I knew what that folder was so I could investigate further.\n\n\nA: The App Store versions of both [Disk Space Analyser] (https://apps.apple.com/au/app/disk-space-analyzer-inspector/id446243721?mt=12) and Daisy Disk are limited functionality compared to the versions available from the developers' websites:\n\n*\n\n*Disk Space Analyser\n\n*Daisy Disk\nThe paid download versions of both cost the same, USD $9.99.\nThe App Store version of Daisy Disk also costs USD $9.99, but if you've bought it from the App Store you can get the download version for free. The App Store version of Disk Space Analyzer is free, but it's unclear how much functionality is missing (ie. they don't say).\nNeither App Store version include hidden files, so aren't going to find those leftover caches. For that you need the download version.\nThey look pretty similar in UI and functionality. Daisy Disk seems to have a higher profile, and includes the ability to scan your cloud storage for Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive. Disk Space Analyzer includes the ability to copy or move selected files as opposed to just deleting them, which could be pretty handy (noting that that comparison chart is on the Nektony site so use your own judgement there).\n", "Q: To what application does com~apple~shoebox belong to?

If you look at the activity monitor on in OSX Pre-Yosemite (you can see this in my question I link and below) you'll see that Used Memory is made up of four parts; App Memory, File Cache, Wired Memory, and Compressed Memory. Now, if you look at the activity monitor below, from OSX Yosemite, you'll see that File Cache is missing. Not sure why there was a change between OS's, but there is one none-the-less. Since you're using a pre-Yosemite OS in the question, I'll defer to the former definition.\nLet's get back to business, calculating the total memory, more specifically Used Memory since Free memory is given to us using vm_stat.\nIn order to calculate this, we need to map the four parts of Used Memory to the different stats given to us from vm_stat.

My problem is that my dad has an iPad and I have an iPhone. He uses a different apple id for his own iPad and I use my own for my own iPhone. I do have home sharing and have them linked to the same homesharing id. But my problem is when I type a paper with pages or make something in keynote the iCloud doesn't work. If I make something on his iPad and save it, I want it to show up on my iPhone. I always have to email it to myself. Can anyone help me please? What am I doing wrong? Thanks!\n\nA: You can use separate apple IDs for iCloud and iTunes.\n Homesharing, iTunes Match, along with iTunes/App Stores can all be associated with a shared iTunes account Apple ID.\nSETTINGS>> iTunes and App stores>> \niCloud iMessage and FaceTime can be signed into with your own unique Apple IDs. A total of 2 Apple IDs are all that are needed between you and your dad. \nSettings>> iCloud>> delete account off one device and keep info when prompted to keep or delete.\nIf personal info such as contacts, calendars, bookmarks etc, have been merged with Info from other device it would be wise to clean up these items before signing into the different Apple ID.\n", "Q: Apple computers model name identification and getting detailed specs?

The \"Manually Added Songs\" section not only contains tracks \"cherry-picked\" in iTunes itself, but it will also contain tracks the were added within the device itself after your last sync (for example, by using the iOS version of iTunes to re-download a prior purchase). \nThis feature is behaving strangely for me: Tracks I downloaded manually from within the device a long time ago, continue to appear in \"Manually Added Songs\", even after I have manually deleted them from the device and even after I manually deleted them from the \"Manually Added Songs\" list itself (to avoid those songs being re-sent to the device on the next sync). \nEssentially, this odd set of tracks (a few songs from album A, a few songs from album B, etc) continues to magically re-appear on the \"Manually Added Songs\" list regardless of what I do. The only way to not get these tracks sent to my device is to manually clear the \"Manually Added Songs\" list every time before I sync my device. This is clearly not the way this feature is supposed to work--sync should \"trump\" what's on the device, so once the \"Manually Added Songs\" list is cleared, that should clear those songs for good. \nAfter complete re-installs of iTunes, iOS, OS X (for reasons not having to do with this problem), this problem persists even across two different phones. The one constant element is that we are dealing with the same iTunes (XML) library file. I would like to keep this file because of the play stats and whatnot, so if anybody can point me in the right direction (including hacking the iTunes library file), I would be ever grateful... I am tired of listening to those same songs! :P \n\nA: When you delete songs on an iPod (or other iOS device), they get copied back the next time you sync with iTunes. This makes no sense, of course, but that's the way it works. (It correctly does not re-sync apps you delete, most of the time.) The only way around it is to un-sync the tracks - make sure they are not selected in the Music tab, or are not in any playlists, or uncheck the tracks and choose the Only sync checked songs and videos options. Or you can manually sync music to the iOS device, but that may not be what you want. \n\nA: I had the exact same problem with my iphone and itunes account. I would remove the manually added songs but whenever I synced they magically re-appeared. It took me some time but I figured it out eventually. If you go to your itunes library and untick the unwanted albums/tracks and THEN remove the manually added songs and hit apply, all the unwanted songs are removed from the device.\n\nA: I took the longest time trying to figure this out, but finally came to a solution I hadn't seen in any of my research, so I thought I'd better share.  \nI'm on iOS 10 and haven't been able to toggle iCloud music on my iPhone, which I thought was where the problem was coming from, but it isn't.  The solution is actually fairly simple: \nFirst, on your iPhone, go to Settings>Music and select \"downloaded music\".  Find the songs that keep showing up in the \"manually added\" section and delete them (or if you're like me, delete all the songs so you can start fresh). \nThen, on the computer, remove all of the \"manually added\" songs. Sync again, and the songs stay off!\nIt's finally taken off the songs that I'd initially bought on the phone but only wanted parts of (like a movie soundtrack that I'd only wanted the songs from, and not the instrumentals).  \nI hope this is helpful to anyone else with the same problem.  \n(Note to any responses: I have no plans on returning to this page now that I've found a solution, so anything directed toward me will go unanswered).  \n\nA: Amazingly, removing the song from iTunes, syncing, verifying the song is removed from the phone, then adding the song back to iTunes, puts it back in the \"Mannually add\" list and adds it back to the iPhone.  Really bizarre.\n", "Q: How do I sync music on my iPad to my new iPhone? I have an iPad and recently purchased an iPhone.  I'd like to sync music currently on the iPad onto the phone.

All of the sudden, one day, there is no sound coming from the dock speakers.  I can listen to the Ipod with headphones and when I place the Ipod on the dock it charges, but no sound.  I have tried replacing the board on the dock, but that didn't help.  Any ideas what might be wrong?\n\nA: Unfortunately, without having access to another dock, or iPod, your options are somewhat limited, as there could be a number of things that failed. Because without another dock, or iPod, either the dock, or the iPod could be at fault. With that in mind, your best options are probably to take the iPod to an Apple store (schedule and appointment) and see if they can offer assistance in testing to see if your iPod had a hardware failure.\nIf the Apple store can't find anything wrong with it, then it may be time to send your Bose SoundDock into Bose to see about repair. \n", "Q: Headphone jack/logic board broken? Recently, my headphone jack on my macbook pro has been very loose. I could easily just tap the wire and the headphone jack would disconnect the wire. So what I did was put some aluminum foil inside the jack. stupid me. Because I stuck too much in there, and I stuck it in real deep, and a pin or a needle can barely even reach it. \nAny suggestions? Thanks.\nUpdate:\n\nI got it out! Yay. However now, here are two problems I am having: \n1) My speakers don't work and the adjust volume option is greyed out, went to system preferences but nothing in output\n2) Works with earphones/external speakers but only the left ear works (for both my external speakers and earphones)\n3) Occasionally there is a red light in the headphone jack when nothing is inserted in it\n4) Its also worth mentioning that these three keys: p, caps lock and mute do not function and are not recognized on my computer and have not been working for a while.\nIs there is something wrong with my logic board?\n\nA: You're absolutely right, stupid you.\nJokes aside, if you have the MBP with removable battery, remove it. Turn your computer off, and get a long needle, match, miniature tweezer, unbent paperclip, straw, or pretty much any long, thin pretty strong appliance with a tip able to \"hook\" on to the aluminium foil. Try to get it out.\nThere really isn't much more to do. If you can't get it out, you'll either need to send it in for service, or open the Mac and replace the headphone jack yourself (warranty break deluxe).\nKeep trying, maybe use a weak suction device or compressed air, be patient, and you'll hopefully get it out. Good luck!\n\nA: Hopefully you learned a not so expensive repair lesson.\nPutting a aluminum foil inside would short the circuits since Al-foil is conductive.\nFurthermore using conductive tools like needles would just do further damages. \nHow far is the damage can be only guessed, or try running the Apple Hardware Test to see.\nUnfortunately you might have to brig you computer to a repair shop.\nPS:\nDo not stick needles in the wall power outlets.\nEdit:\nAs you describe your problems and if you are lucky it is only some al-foil residue left in the plug shorting the plug. Try using a tooth brush like this to clean it.\n\nSo you know what is happening, here is a cross section of a jack plug showing tiny contacts (that are spring-loaded). So chances are some of you foil got in it.\n\n\nA: \n1) My speakers don't work and the adjust volume option is greyed out,\n  went to system preferences but nothing in output\n...\n3) Occasionally there is a red light in the headphone jack when\n  nothing is inserted in it\n\nFor these 2 issues, the digital (optical) audio connection is responsible. The red light is used for optical signalling, which is enabled when the jack senses the presence of an object in the jack, but the electronics confirm it's not headphones. This issue isn't too uncommon, and can generally be \"reset\" back to the off state by resetting PRAM. Also try inserting and removing a headphone plug a few times.\n", "Q: Time machine out of space / Merging time machine backup I have a 15 inch Mac Book Pro that is my main machine. At some point, in the\nsecond half of 2011 I purchased a 750GB external hard drive to configure Time\nMachine on my laptop. This is my main method for backup, and I always keep\nit up to date. A few weeks ago it started complaining that it did not have\nenough space and that it needed to delete the oldest backup to create this new\none. I allowed this to happen at first, but realized that I was losing possible\nimportant historical snapshots of my data.\nI want to purchase a new, larger external hard drive to keep my time machine\nbackups. Before spending a couple hundred dollars in this project I  have a\ncouple of questions regarding best practices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will TM allow me to integrate my older backups into the new hard drive?\n\n*While it seems convenient to have my whole history in one hard drive, would it\nbe smart to do so? Or should I not integrate them? I understand that this would\nconstitute a single point of failure that is highly undesirable.\n\n*What other advanced practices do people have with TM to not have a single point\nof failure?\n\n\nA: TM will not move your old snapshots to a new drive, although I'm pretty sure that if you first used Disk Utility's Restore tab to clone your old backup drive to the new one (after reformatting it properly), it would see the old snapshots properly.\nBut there's a bigger problem. You are trying to use TM as an archiving tool, but that's really not what it's designed for. TM will expire old snapshots as it sees fit, so if you want reliable retention of old files it's not the right tool for the job. Unfortunately, I don't have a good suggestion for a better tool, but I would strongly recommend looking for something more appropriate.\nThat said, switching TM to a new drive (and removing the old one from its backup target list) would be a semi-reasonable way to retain all of the old snapshots (and having multiple redundant backups is a good idea). Doing that and switching to a new archiving tool would also be reasonable (since you probably won't be able to migrate the old TM snapshots to any net tool you select).\n", "Q: Can I change the default music player app on my iPhone? If so, how? I want to change the default music app on my iPhone from Music to Spotify. Is this possible?  My first guess is that I would have to jailbreak my phone. Is there anyway to do it without jailbreaking? \n\nA: Uninstall the default music app in iOS 11.\nRestart. voila. \nMy headphone control now works with wynk music app.\ncontrol center also shows wynk music.\n\nA: I would say there isn't really any default music player on the iPhone. You could say that Apple's Music-app is the one that opens when you press \"Play\" on the lock-screen or the \"multitasking bar\", but there's no real advantage in that.\nTo answer your question, no. You are pretty much unable to change any default things in the non-jailbroken version of iOS.\nWith that said, you can do some tweaks having jailbroken your device. If you would like to use Siri to play your Spotify music, there is a jailbreak app for that called AssistantLove.\nOther than that, you could use the jailbreak app SpotiPlay. It makes the Spotify-application the one used on the multitasking bar.\n\nA: There is no way to do this on a non-jailbroken iPhone. And even after jailbreaking, there is currently no tweak which lets you do this.\n\nA: Ok so I found out how. \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Spotify, don't play a song yet\n\n*Plug in your headphones then play a song\n\n*Now you lock your phone while the song is playing and now when you press the power button or the unlock button you should see the Spotify logo at the bottom left corner of the screen.\n\n\nAt least that's how I did it for Apple Music and then back to Spotify.\n\nA: With iOS11 it seems like my iPhone changes back to the 'Music' app after a couple of minutes not using anything else. I did not like this since I hopped in my car and the music app started playing. \nIt's absolutely not the best option but for me it works quite well: \nUNINSTALL the official music app\nI have done this a couple of days ago and so far I actually like that scenario way better. Although it's still not perfect... I'd rather have the option to choose the default player. But my guess is we won't see that happening any time soon...\nI'm aware that this only works if you do not have a library from iTunes on your phone. But I guess many people who use spotify as their default player don't have a giant library and any need to have the music app installed. \n\nA: Uninstalling the default music app and restarting works on iOS 12.\nOne extra step I had to take to enable playback from the control center with the app closed was to go to Privacy > Media & Apple Music and enable access for the app.\n\nAs an alternative I use Evermusic Pro and I highly recommend it. I have no affiliation with the app or developer, just found it with search and after trying a bunch of other apps I think this is the best one.\n\nA: Sorry for bumping old thread. iPhone users can now download \"MusicTube\" for listening YouTube music on lockscreen.\n", "Q: Graphics-Card and the Mac Pro I'm considering to buy a Mac Pro (or wait till mid 2013 because of the update of the Mac Pro lineup).\nWhat i'm concern about is: How is the support for graphics card under OS X Mountain Lion?\nI've read something that since Lion, many more ATI 7xxx cards are supported without any flashing or something like that. \nI want a Mac Pro because of its extensibility. And the graphics card is my only concern. \nFor which reason: Playing games from time to time could so be possible. \nIs there any source or community which uses the Mac Pro heavily and is helping me with this kind of questions? \nThanks!\nEDIT: Or, let me put it this way: I want a strong power machine with OS X, so i can have multiple OS Versions on multiple hard drives. \n\nBut, with this machine, i want to also play games, maybe on windows.\n  So: There are drivers for \"gaming graphics cards\" for windows. Can i\n  plug two graphics card in the mac and only \"activate\" the one i need?\nSure, it isn't that easy, but how would a work around look like?\n\n\nA: You're better off using an Mac-supported cards from Apple or others.\nApple's card are seriously outdated, both 5770 and 5870 are slow card in today's standard. \nThere \"should\" be a renew of Mac Pro some day, you can wait for that.\nThere are a cards like the Quadro K5000 that is Mac-compatible. But NOT out of the box. You need to install the driver first, and then install the card.\nAlso, support for AMD HD 7 series cards ARE NOT IN YET in 10.8.2. I had one of those in my old Hackintosh running 10.8.3, and it's still recognized as \"AMD Radeon HD 7xxx series\", so I will say wait for it.\nDon't make any moves before AMD 7 series is out, maybe Apple or third-party will release cards for it.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: refresh mail.app inbox when returning from standby (IMAP) When returning from standby mail.app does not refresh my inbox. New mails (or changes to old mails, like move or delete) are not synchronized.

I'm thinking about whether I should get my MacBook Pro 6,2 repaired. The repair would include replacing the logic board, so I'm wondering if the CPU and GPU are replaced as well?\n\nA: As you can see on the image below, the CPU (red border) and the GPU (orange and yellow border) are wave soldiered onto the logic board and they will be replaced together.\nBUT, you should know this kind of replacements are extremely expensive. Prices goes up to $1,000 so in most cases it's better to buy a new Mac. It's not uncommon to find \"older\" refurbished Macs at similar prices to logic board replacements.\nYou Mac is almost 3 years old and if I were you, I wouldn't do the repair and just go for a new Mac.\n\n\nA: Yes, the MacBook Pro photos and replacement parts on the iFixIt suggest the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) are embedded on the main logic board.\n\nA: Apple flat rate repair is $310.  Take your computer to the Apple Store.\nI got my Macbook Pro 6,2 repaired, by taking it to the Apple Store.  The Apple Store offered me flat rate repair for $310.  They replaced my logic board 3 times and on the third time refunded their repair charge.  Authorized Service Provider  in Mexico had wanted $1,200 to replace the logic board or $250 to re-ball the BGA of the GPU.  He told me the re-balling might not work and sometimes works only for a few months.  So flat rate depot repair in the USA was the best option for me. Each logic board replacement took 5-7 days.\nThe flat rate repair is available in the USA, but not Mexico.  (There are only Apple resellers in Mexico.)  Start with an Apple Store genius.

I opened the options and played around with the ingame sensitivity and it didn't change my mouse speed at all.\nAfter quitting the game and looking up my mouse settings in the system preferences it was set to 0 (or the lowest possible setting on the slider).\nImportant notices:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm using a \"Gaming\" mouse (Speedlink Kudos), which works fine.

(Specifically to convert Mac OS Roman to utf8) I would like to call a command line utility in Mac OS X 10.8 that gives me the ability to convert a text file saved in standard Western Mac OS Roman encoding to the more generic UTF-8.\nI will be calling the utility from an AppleScript that I have created.  AppleScript is extremely slow when working with very large text blocks.  As such, I want to do my text parsing and conversion using the OS X command line.  I have found a tool called, \"sed\", which allows me to do the text parsing.  However, there are still many elements of the file that need to be cleaned up, characters that appear as garbage if the file is opened as utf-8 (e.g. smart quotes and ellipses).\nI am thinking that forcing a text encoding conversion may help to eliminate all non-utf8 characters in the file.  However, I cannot see how \"sed\" can easily convert the text encoding.\nI will have already saved the temp txt file, as MacRoman, to disk using the built-in AppleScript routines.\nRequirements:\n\n*\n\n*Command-line for performance\n\n*Prefer native tools since other users of my script won't necessarily have the proper toolset if it's not built-in. (Although I could add a check to my script and abort if a needed tool isn’t present)\n\nDo any of you have any ideas as to a built-in command-line tool that can convert text encoding or an existing package that is superior for this task?\n\nA: iconv is definitively the tool of choice here:\niconv -f MACROMAN -t UTF-8 your-roman-encoded-file.txt > utf-8-encoded-file.txt\n\nRun iconv --list to see a list of all supported encodings.\n\nA: Another way to convert non-ASCII characters to ASCII variants is to use iconv -t ASCII//TRANSLIT:\n$ echo ‘’“”–—…äé | iconv -t ASCII//TRANSLIT\n''\"\"--...\"a'e\n\nASCII//IGNORE would remove non-ASCII characters, but you can also do that with for example tr -dc '\\0-\\177'.\n", "Q: Arranging an external monitor for Macbook Air I connected an external monitor to my Macbook Air, and arranged it above the MBA display. See this screen arrangement.\n\nIn the above screenshot, the up-display is the external display, and the down-display is the MBA display.\nI want to use the MBA display for my main working display, and occasionally put some reference windows in the external display. So, I want the menubar stay in the MBA display. \nThe problem is that dragging a window from the MBA display to the external display does not move it. If a windows is somehow placed in the external display, I can drag it down to the MBA display.\nHow can I move a window from the MBA display to the external display?\nI tried to arrange the displays physically up and down, but in the OS side by side. It is so confusing. So, I would opt out such an option.\n\nA: When dragging the window upward towards the top display, it will appear to be blocked by the menu bar. \nThe solution is to keep dragging upward through the menu bar, and after a slight delay, the window will appear in the top display.\n\nA: If the reason you want to keep the menu bar in your lower display is to have easy access to your menu items, you might consider the app called MenuEverywhere from Binary Bakery.\nhttp://www.binarybakery.com/product.php?app=menueverywhere\nSome of the relevant features include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Vertical menu pop-up at the current mouse location using a mouse\nbutton or shortcut\n\n*Add a screen-top menu bar to all your additional displays\n\n*Attaches a window-top menu bar to application windows\n\n\nJust a happy customer...\n", "Q: Problems running Britannica 2013 in OS X 10.8 I recently installed the Encyclopædia Britannica 2013 Ultimate DVD in my Mac running OS X 10.8.2 Mountain Lion. In the box is stated that only 10.6 - 10.7 versions are supported, and indeed I've run into a couple of problems: both the \"Timelines\" and \"A-Z Quick Search\" windows display a blank screen.\nI contacted technical support and the only answer I received was that OS X 10.8 is not a supported version, and they don't seem to be planning a patch to fix the issue. To the best of my knowledge, I'm on my own. It appears to me that the problem is related to the Java version in use, given that Britannica's application is written in that language. Maybe someone has faced the same problem and can suggest a workaround? for the record: I'm using JDK 1.7.0_13-b20\n\nA: Personally I don't trust Oracle JDK at all. I use JDK from Apple. Can you try it?\n", "Q: Why are the alias so big in filesize in Mountain Lion? I noticed the alias(es) that I create in Mountain Lion are very big in filesize (for example an alias to a folder is 5.8MB!)\nCompared to Leopard, they were just about 500KB.\nWhy is this? and is there a way in the system where I can make them smaller without resorting to creating alias via the terminal?\n\nA: Since Lion, in addition to storing Retina icons, it seems that an alias stores its many different sizes of icons in both the data and the resource fork (the xattr com.apple.ResourceFork). Possibly in a move away from Resource forks, while still supporting previous OSes (for now).\nThe alias I just created contained the follow formats:\nis32, s8mk, ic11, il32, l8mk, ic12, ic07, ic13, ic08, ic14, ic09, ic10\nThey are described here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Icon_Image_format\n\nA: In High Sierra, the following works: just select the alias and run Finder command \"Show Original\" (command-R).  This trims the alias size down to a minimum.  This brought an alias that was previously 24 Mb down to 8 Kb.\n", "Q: How to backup iPhone without first deleting all data? So I bought a new iPhone 5 64GB and I enabled iCloud backup. For a while now it has not been able to backup my iPhone, since the 5GB of iCloud storage quickly ran out. I didn't feel like upgrading my storage plan, since there's anyway no storage plan that is able to backup 64GB. So I decided to store the backups on my computer.\nI connect my iPhone to my Mac and iTunes 11 opens up. Nothing is where it used to be and when I finally find my iPhone in the top right corner I'm presented with two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up as new iPhone\n\n*Restore from the backup of ...\n\n\n(My itunes is in Swedish, so this is what I think it would say in English.)\nSo whatever I choose I lose all my data, which is really stupid, since the point of doing backups is to not lose data.\nIs there any way to backup my iPhone without first deleting all data?\n\nNote:\nThis question seems similar, but it's for iTunes 10:\nHow to set up new iPhone without deleting its data?\n\nA: Don't worry, you don't loose all your data. You can choose \"Set up as new iPhone\". \n\nNothing gets synced or deleted after clicking this option.\n\nAfter that, you can backup your iPhone. \nChoose \"encrypted backup\" to also backup your settings and passwords.\n\nA: *\n\n*Connect your iPhone and run iTunes on your Mac\n\n*Right-click on the iPhone icon which appeared on the left side and click \"Backup\"\n\n*iTunes will now back up your iPhone settings, messages, emails, camera roll photos, etc\n\n\nA: The backup doesn't include media since all your media files should be either in iTunes or iCloud. Backups for my 64GB iPad and 32GB iPhone only take about 3GB of backup space each and that's only because TomTom app had off-line maps that take over a GB. It does include photos and video so that could be an issue.\n\nA: If there is backup files in your iTunes, you cannot sync again to backup it, it will delete backup with your new iPhone data. So you need to restart a new account in iTunes and sync back the data to iTunes to backup iPhone.\n\nA: I was in the situation, and what iTunes displays is a bit frightening and misleading. Fortunately, iTunes doesn't do something that would be outrageously stupid. \nYou can link your phone with one computer running the iTunes app to synchronize music, videos, audiobooks; all the things that are controlled by iTunes. So if I took my phone, with my music, that was always connected to iTunes on my computer, and connected it to iTunes on your computer, then \"Set up as new iPhone\" really means \"Set up as a new iPhone connected to this iTunes app\". The music and videos that were stored in my iTunes app are gone, but everything else stays intact and you can back it all up. \nSo basically you cannot have music from two different computers on your iPhone at the same time, but you can backup your phone on a fresh computer or on multiple computers. If you had music or videos from another computer on your phone that would be gone, but you don't have that, so you are fine. \n(I ran into the problem when my wife wanted a ringtone on her iPhone, that was only ever backed up on iCloud, and you need to connect an iPhone to your computer to install a ringtone that you created yourself on your computer. So I have done this, and it worked). \nNow where this is a problem is if you had tons of music on your computer, it gets stolen or breaks without you having a backup, and then you cannot connect your iPhone to a new computer without losing your music. Still everything else is Ok.\n", "Q: Why does text appear blurry when zooming in Safari until you release your fingers from the trackpad? This has been bothering me for a while. When you zoom in Safari (Mac) using the pinch gesture, the text is only anti-aliased after finishing the gesture, not in realtime. Why not?\n\nA: Probably to give a smoother and better user experience while browsing the web. If it did it in real time all systems wouldn't be able to handle it that well.\n", "Q: Can I combine message conversations from one contact's different phone numbers? My friend recently got a new phone number assigned to the same iPhone she's had for a while, and sent me an iMessage from it to let me know. Since I didn't have the phone number already, it of course appeared separately in my iPhone's \"conversation\" list from the messages we had sent back and forth using her old number.\nI've added the new phone number to her contact info now, and it would be nice if I could keep the two conversations together -- just continuing with the new number from where the old number left off.\nI've found a program called Merge available on Cydia, which looks like it would do exactly what I want. I am not particularly interested in jailbreaking, however. Is there any way to accomplish the same thing on stock iOS 6?\n\nA: On stock iOS, different contact numbers or email addresses are given their own \"conversation\". This answer still applies, even on iOS 6.\n", "Q: What is com.DesignScience.DSMTTool Among my list of scheduled tasks is something called \"com.DesignScience.DSMTTool\" located at\n/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.DesignScience.DSMTTool\n\nWhat is this?

If you have Microsoft Word installed on your Mac, I think that's what it is. I can't confirm this though, as I don't have MathType installed.\nEdit: I'm trying to get someone from Mathematics to confirm it.\nEdit 2: I was unable to get a confirmation for this, but I'm still pretty certain it belongs to MathType. Check in Word if you have MathType installed!\n", "Q: Apple TV Home Videos I'm considering importing my home videos into my iTunes library so I can easily access them over any device in the house.  The one problem I'm seeing is when I add home movies, and I have them labeled as home movies in iTunes, on the apple tv they just show up under the movies selection for my iTunes Library.  I heard you can label them as TV Shows and have a bit more control, but honestly I'd just rather have a \"Home Movies\" option and \"Movies\" option to pick from on my main screen?  Is something like this possible?\n\nA: If you don't mind sacrificing the Genre tag, you could tag \"real\" Movies with Genre=\"Movie\", and your home movies with Genre=\"Home Movie\", and then browse by Genre on the ATV.\n\nA: I set the genre to 'Home Movies'.  While they are still intermingled with actual movies when viewing ALL, I peruse movies by genre.\n", "Q: Destination of merged PDFs in Automator? Where can I find the PDF merged by the automator?\n\n\nA: It is placed in a temporary file, with some random name, such as:\n/var/folders/mt/k2_g0s2x3dl9jpx009p14nmw0000gm/T/JbtgKP.pdf\n\nIn general they are placed somewhere under /var/fodlers directory.\nIf you want to find where it is, you can open a Terminal and type something like:\nsudo find /var/folders/ -name \"*.pdf\"\n\nBut probably, you'll want to rename and move it where you need, adding Rename Finder Items and Move Finder Items steps.\n", "Q: How can I view HTTP only cookies in OSX? I have a website I'm investigating and want to view HTTP-only cookies in Firefox, Safari, or Chrome.\nHow can I view these special cookies in OSX?\n\nA: In Chrome choose View->Developer->Developer tools (or key alt-cmd-I) and the choose the resources tab.\nIn Safari Develop->Show Page Resources (key alt-cmd-A) choose the storage view. To turn the developer tools on go to Preferences->Advanced and tick the bottom box \"Show Develop menu in Menu bar\" For more info see the Apple documentation.\n\nA: The Web Developer plugin for Firefox has a \"Cookies -> View Cookie Information\" menu choice that displays cookies for a given URL. It differentiates cookies based on http / https for each domain.\n", "Q: How can I use my US-iPhone in South Korea? I have an iPhone 4S and I will be going to South Korea for a year for my 1st duty station in the army. What should I do? Can I get it unlocked or should I just by a phone over there? I need contact with my family.\n\nA: Before buying a CDMA SIM in Korea, check that your iPhone 4s is \n\n\n*\n\n*a CDMA phone, and\n\n*unlocked\n\n\nCalling stateside from South Korea using a Korea-issued SIM card may be expensive. You should consider getting iOS apps (e.g. Skype, WhatsApp) that relies on WiFi or data plan to communicate.\n\nA: Call AT&T and have them unlock your phone. You're eligible for this process. Check out this link for more info. You qualify for the normal unlocking procedure, but you may also qualify for the military phone unlock as well.

I bought my computer from my school, where they had multiple locks and disabled functions. When I bought it they were suppose to delete all these locks, but I guess they didn't – now I am unable to activate my internet sharing like described in this post.\nI can mess with the options, but I cannot click on for internet sharing.\nCan someone walk me through the process of deleting this from my system so I can turn on my internet sharing?\n\nA: One possibility why you are unable to enable internet sharing is your school may have used  a Profile Manager (http://help.apple.com/profilemanager/mac/2.1/#apd0E2214C6-50F0-48C9-A482-74CEA1D77A9F) to apply settings and preferences to your Mac. The benefit is settings (such as WiFi network access, software licenses, etc) present in your Mac allows you to use your Mac in school without having to remember to the settings. Disadvantage is you may have to ask your school for help in enabling internet sharing. Whether the school agrees will depend on its policy for accessing school resources even though the Mac is yours (as you stated, bought by you).\n", "Q: Added music not showing neither in the library, nor in the recently added I've got a 1040 MP3s to add to iTunes (not bought before).\nI dragged them to the iTunes window, it processed/copied something (only 953, huh, why?), they even appeared in the iTunes Media/Music folder and in the iTunes Music Library.xml file. But I can't find no one of them neither in the library, nor in the recently added. Interesting thing: there is a new album cover on the cell with the name of the artist existed before. And if I search a random song in the search bar I'll find it but I can't go to it or add to the next playing.\nI haven't the iTunes Match option.\nWhat is happening?\n\nA: It took a time for iTunes to process a huge bunch of files so now they appeared in the library. However, there is no progress bar or something like this to recognize when it'll finish.\n", "Q: How created watched folder with Automator to auto import new files into itunes? I was wondering if someone could help me with this. This what I'd like to do:\nFile is downloaded into Folder A, it is automatically imported into itunes and then moved to folder B.

Or am I just out of luck with an old car? \nI did some searches on google but nothing came up. I also saw some car kits but I didn't understand the description when they talked about \"pins\". I don't see any pins on the charger that came with my new iPhone.\nI went back to the Verizon store where I bought it, but they weren't any help.\nI don't think Cadillac could answer my question either. After all, they are sales people not techs.\nI searched on the Apple website but found nothing regarding a 2005 car. \n\nA: Due to the new Lightning connector introduced with the iPhone 5, you'll need a car charger specifically built for this connection. A quick Google search gave several hits e.g. Amazon iPhone 5 Car Charger - Lightning Connector or Belkin Car Charger with Lightning connector for iPhone 5 (10 Watt/2.1 Amp).\nNothing changed on the cigarette lighter side of things, so these chargers should work with older cars as well.\n", "Q: Can malware move from Windows to Mac I recently got a Mac, and am transferring files from my old Windows laptop which had kept freezing with very high hard-drive activity, and may or may not be infected with malware. I'm wondering if there's a chance of my Mac being infected by malware from photos, documents, videos and music transferred from a Windows machine? \nIf so, which antivirus would you recommend me to get on my Mac? Are Sophos and Avira any good? \n\nA: This answer reflects the situation at the time it was written (beginning of 2013) and may be different today. Please don't assume that it is still correct for current malware implementations\nThe short answer is \"No, your Mac should not get infected\".\nThe a bit longer answer is \"it depends\". You should be fine with photos, videos and music, but there might a very small risk with documents (depending on the format) and anything html-related (which might access a malware server or something). But given the current state of malware on OS X I wouldn't worry too much.\n\nA: While your Mac won't show any symptoms of infection by Windows malware, it can carry and pass Windows viruses on to other computers or networks. Think of your Mac like a Typhoid Mary if it is housing any Windows malware. \nYour Mac can get infected with Mac malware, which is a growing threat these days. \nI would't bother putting any Windows antivirus software on your Mac. I recommend Intego, an Apple antivirus company that focuses on protecting Macs. You can check them out here: http://www.intego.com/products \nHope this help!\n\nA: It won't affect your Mac. But it may infect other Windows systems that your Mac comes in contact with.\n\nA: Actually, there is indeed a low but very real chance to get infected.\nThere are 2 ways in which files on a disk can infect a computer:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the file is an executable e.g. .exe or .app, it contains code that is run on the machine if a user tells the computer to do so. Windows executables cannot run on a Mac and Mac executables cannot run on Windows, so a Windows executable cannot infect a Mac. Infected Windows executables are harmless on a Mac, and infected Mac executables are harmless on a Windows machine.\n\n*If the file has to be opened by a host program e.g. Adobe Acrobat, or Flash Player, the file can use flaws in the host program to make the host program install and execute a virus. The same is the case for java files, several text document formats, some image formats, etc. It's possible that a Windows machine contains such files on a harddisk which can attack a Mac, as soon as the Mac user decides to open these files. See this question on security.stackexchange.\nIn any case, if you manage to infect the Mac with a Windows harddisk, or the other way around, the actual malware will be different. The same exploit will almost certainly never work on both Windows and Macs.\n\nA: An experimental (very rare) kernel infection exists for the Mac, called\nThunderstrike.\nIt is actually still being developed as a proof of concept, along with some other experimental malware for OS X, but at its current stage (version 2) it is able to travel via thunderbolt storage devices and infect other Macs.\nSome conspire that the NSA is behind many of the kernel vulnerabilities present in the OS X kernel, but that's just thoughts and speculations derived from (possibly) false rumours.\nAnyway, I'll throw a few links and sources below and you can read some more 'in-depth' stuff if you're willing to.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.wired.com/2015/08/researchers-create-first-firmware-worm-attacks-macs\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT202458\n\n*http://digitaltrends.com/computing/flashback-lingers-despite-apples-fix-the-malware-remains-on-140k-machines\n\n*http://digitaltrends.com/computing/former-nsa-staffer-finds-new-way-to-abuse-rootpipe-vulnerability-in-os-x\n\n*http://digitaltrends.com/computing/can-macs-get-viruses\nDon't worry, you're safe if you don't click on unknown links :)\n", "Q: Can I display notifications on my non-primary monitor?

My (application) firewall settings are configured to block incoming connections from netbiosd. I don't recall setting this myself, and wonder what the consequences are.\n\nWhat are the consequences of blocking incoming connections for netbiosd? If  I generally block incoming connections as a precaution, should I block netbiosd as well?\n\nA: NetBIOS is legacy for decades. Before IP became more or less the standard layer 3 network protocol also in home/company networks, other protocols were directly used on top of layer 2 networks (layer 2 means Ethernet, Token Ring, etc.) One of them was NetBIOS, created by IBM in 1983 and it became very popular as Microsoft decided to use it for Windows. Another popular one was IPX, created by Xerox in the late 80s, which became very popular as Novell used it in their NetWare operating system.\nLater on that protocol was split into two parts: NetBUI and NetBIOS. NetBUI was the low level part, that allowed NetBIOS to run directly on top of layer 2, whereas NetBIOS was on a higher level and thus could now also be used on top of the IP protocol stack, since IP more and more replaced all other layer 3 protocols. That way Microsoft could continue to use NetBIOS, even though IP became the new standard layer 3 protocol in Windows.\nNetBIOS implements three things:\n\n*\n\n*Name resolution, comparable to DNS (or rather mDNS)\n\n*Datagram service, communication comparable to UDP\n\n*Session service, communication comparable to TCP\n\nToday it is mainly used by Windows for name resolution and service discovery, comparable to DNS-SD on macOS/Linux (Apple calls it Bonjour), SSDP (the discovery protocol of UPnP), or SLP (which is mainly used for discovering network printers today). It's only used as a communication protocol when trying to connect to a very old Windows machine, where protocols like SMB would still run on top of NetBIOS (today they run on top of TCP/IP).\nNetBIOS is very inefficient in larger networks as it works with broadcasts and it produces a lot of broadcast traffic; there are companies where 30% of all network traffic on the LAN are NetBIOS broadcasts. SSDP and DNS-SD are more efficient, as they use multicast instead of broadcasts and try to limit the amount of announcements to a reasonable level. DNS-SD even uses service caching which can further reduce the amount of multicast traffic dramatically. IMHO DNS-SD is the best discovery protocol in use, it's the discovery protocol of ZeroConf, which is widely supported by Linux systems and also by macOS (Apple calls it Bonjour but that's just the name of Apples ZeroConf implementation).\nBlocking netbiosd is safe, it will only prevent your Mac from announcing services via NetBIOS broadcasts and it will prevent your system from receiving NetBIOS broadcasts. This has two consequences:\n\n*\n\n*Windows machines will not \"see\" your computer on the LAN. If you share directories of your Mac, this will not be known by Windows computers. However, they can still access them if required. They will only need to know your IP address and when opening \\\\<YourIP>\\, they get a list of available shares or they can directly connect to a share using \\\\<YourIP>\\<ShareName> (of course only after successful authentication).\n\n\n*Your Mac won't be able to \"see\" Windows machines in the LAN that only announce their shares via NetBIOS. You can still access such shares if you know their IP address. Therefor you open Finder, select Go > Connect to Server... (or CMD+K) and enter smb://<IP> or smb://<IP>/<ShareName>. Newer Windows machines, that also announce their shares via SSDP are seen by macOS, since Bonjour also understands SSDP multicasts.\n\nA: netbiosd is responsible for interacting with NetBIOS networks. NetBIOS is Microsoft's networking service. \nIf you block incoming netbiosd connections then you will not be able to share drives over netbios which is the simplest way to share data to Windows machines.\nIf you generally block incoming connections as a precaution the you should block anything until you actually need it, that is until something breaks. So yes block netbiosd to begin with.\n", "Q: Show exposé/\"All Application Windows\" from the dock Is there anyway to show all the windows for one application (aka Exposé) from the window icon on the launcher?

If I set new bookmarks when I'm at work, the changes don't propagate to my iOS devices (which are also with me at work) or to my iMac at home. But if I set new bookmarks at home, they do propagate to my other devices, at least most of the time. I've noticed that sometimes new bookmarks set on my iPhone 5 or iPad 3 don't always propagate to my iMac or to my MBA. But my question is, could my workplace's overzealous (security security!) IT have something in place that interferes with iCloud syncing?\n\nA: From this Apple Support document detailing TCP and UDP ports used by Apple software, iCloud uses these ports:\n25   - smtp    \n80   - http    \n443  - SSL (HTTPS)    \n587  - Authenticated smtp    \n993  - SSL IMAP    \n5223 - DAV services\n\nMy guess is that it would be port 5223 which being blocked by your company.\nAs for your company's IT being 'overzealous', they are only doing exemplary due diligence protecting their network and server infrastructure, as well as any user (you) who connects, from nasties out there who would cause harm. \n", "Q: Where can I find the Mountain Lion (Notification Center) notification sound? I've been searching around for the little sound (the default one) when a notification is presented (on Mountain Lion Notification Center) but I can't find it. Example: http://d.pr/a/P5xo (sound recorded)\nAny ideas? Thanks!\n\nA: In OS X 10.8 it's called burn complete.aif (or burn failed.aif–they are the same sound) and is found in /System/Library/Components/CoreAudio.component/Contents/SharedSupport/SystemSounds/system/. \nTo get into CoreAudio.component, right-click the file and select Show Package Contents.\n\nA: The notification center uses the sound from your alert preferences, so you just need to check the sound being used in the system preferences and get it (or change it):\nGo to the Apple menu;\nSelect \"System Preferences\" then \"Sound\";\nThe first tab shows the alert sound.\nNote the name of the sound.\nGo to /System/Library/Sounds and get/copy/change your file.\n\nIf you don't see any file in that location, and you do have sound files in the system preferences, that means you have the files hidden.\nTo show the invisible files, do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder\n\n*Open the Utilities folder\n\n*Open a terminal window\n\n*Copy and paste the following line in:\n defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles YES\n\n\n*Press return;\nNow hold alt on the keyboard and right click on the Finder icon;\nClick on Relaunch\nYou will now be able to see any hidden files or folders. When done, perform steps from the begining, however, replace the terminal command with:\ndefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles NO\n\n\nNotice that you can have more info about setting up the notification center here:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT5362\n\nA: That sound file should be located inside /System/Library/Sounds. Go to that folder and have a look.\n\nA: Found it! But not inside OSX. I searched on google and downloaded it from a sound pack of iOS system sounds and there was it. Boom!\nIf you're interested, https://sites.google.com/site/iphonesounds/iPhoneOriginalSystemSounds_WAV.zip?attredirects=0\nIt's called 'Voicemail.wav'. Have fun!\n", "Q: How do I fix enourmous CPU usage & temperature on MacBook Air when trying to install Wine? I have a 2012 MacBook Air Intel Core i5 8 GB memory (Mountain Lion).  I am trying to install Wine through MacPorts, but after about a minute of building Wine, CPU usage rapidly rises into the 90s, and the temperature goes from 60 degrees Celcius to 90-95 very quickly.  Both the CPU usage and the temperature continue rising until I shut down my MacBook. The fan becomes very loud and occasionally makes screeching sounds.  I have tried several times and reinstalled MacPorts but to no avail.  What can I do to fix this? Any help is greatly appreciated.  \n\nA: The current lineup runs CPU up to 100 C. Is is normal, so you might be able to get something ike SMC fan control to ramp up the fans earlier, but since the CPU clock rate can over heat the blowers, you might not be able to do anything short of externally cooling the case significantly. \nBoth the clock rate and fans work in conjunction, so upping the fans in turn lowers the clock rate restriction - canceling your efforts to alter the designed behavior. \n\nA: I have had increasing problems with CPU and temps, to the point where my mid 2012 macbook air would take 10 minutes to come back from sleep.  I finally opened up the computer, and replaced the thermal paste on the cpu.  I found that about 30% of the cpu surface was lacking paste at all, and the rest was dried and caked.  After cleaning and replacing with Arctic Silver 5, my temps run in the 60's for the most part, and under high load, go into the 90's, but not the 100's like before.  In addition, my system comes back from sleep very quickly - though the cpu goes to 100% and the temps rise rapidly to the high 90's before settling down again.  I would recommend this fix for anyone with temperature problems.\n", "Q: While my MacBook sleeps, the network drops off? I have just moved over to a Macbook Pro from my old Macbook. Thanks to the Migration Assistant, it was an easy task, but I am now having an annoying issue: I have both computers on with all the same settings and everything identical. The wifi settings, the Energy Saving settings - everything.\nNow, when the computer goes to 'Sleep', the behavior is different is between the two computers. I have Skype on. If I'm away for about an 1 hour, Skype will go offline. As a result if someone were to Skype me, the old Macbook will react - my Skype will ring when they call me and obviously they see me as online (despite the screen being off and the computer in sleep mode). \nHowever, my new Macbook Pro will not ring. The party that wants to reach me will think I'm offline because the network connection gets disabled somehow. On my old Macbook, I just need to touch the trackpad and the screen comes on, but on my new Macbook pro I need to press a key (some websites state that this is the new thing on new version such as Lion and Mountain Lion), and the computer will quickly come on, pick up the wifi and only then all e-mails and Skype lines/calls will filter through and I will reappear as online. \nHow can I stay online even when my computer goes to sleep?\n\nA: There are a couple of things that could be causing this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure \"Wake for network access\" is checked in Energy Saver.  This should work if Skype is sending data over Bonjour.\n\n*Your prior computer may only be turning off the display instead of sleeping the computer entirely.  In the Energy Saver control panel, try setting the computer sleep time to Never.  You can retain your display sleep time.\nMy understanding is that #2 is likely the solution as I don't believe the type of traffic on which Skype relies will trigger the Wake-On-LAN feature. \n\nA: Have you tried disabling standby mode?\nsudo pmset -a standby 0\n\nSome newer laptops enter a lower energy mode after about an hour of normal sleep under certain conditions. I don't know if it also disables waking for network access though.\n", "Q: TextEdit Crashes on New Document (SIGSEGV) I can't even create a new text document in TextEdit, though I can open any existing one.

different reigen into the drive it will ask you to change again. \nBut you are only allowed to do this 4 times, once you've exhausted that is there any way to change it back ? Or are you now stuck - ie. not able to play dvd's from any other region ? \n\nA: Unless you are willing to research how to flash the firmware of the particular DVD drive in your Mac to change the region, or to make it region-free, I suggest you try the very cool (and free) app VLC Media Player from VideoLAN. If VLC does what you need it to, please consider donating to the 'cause'.\nYour milage may vary. \nDisclaimer: I have no financial stake in VideoLAN.org - I'm just a very satisfied customer. \n\nA: AFAIK, the last region change sticks, so you won't be able to play DVD from another region from then on.\n\nA: This is pretty troublesome to change the region code everytime you load a different DVD. For me, I would choose to make a digital copy of all my DVD collection without region code and then load into DVD drive, it does not ask for region anymore.\n", "Q: Custom Scheduling of Time Machine backups How can I customize the schedule at which Time Machine performs its backups?\nI am annoyed by looking at the number of times I see the Time Machine backing up several MBs every hour and then the cleanup.\n\nA: Schedule backup for every 4 hours ( 4*60*60 = 14400 )\nsudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.backupd-auto StartInterval -int 14400\n\nDefault is 1 hour ( Rollback procedure )\nsudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.backupd-auto StartInterval -int 3600\n\nSource: http://osxdaily.com/2012/02/02/change-the-time-machine-backup-schedule/\n\nA: I would recommend using the app TimeMachineScheduler for this, it provides an easy-to-use graphical interface, and has a lot more features than a simple Terminal-line.\nUnlike typing a command into Terminal.app where a typo can potentially create problem, using a graphical user interface is safer.\n\n(source: klieme.com)\n\nA: Since both answers are not any longer valid as of this writing (MacOS 11 Big Sur), I add what works today: Time Machine Editor  (https://tclementdev.com/timemachineeditor/).\nThe current version 5.1 runs on every MacOS from 10.9 upwards.\n", "Q: Is it possible to have my iPhone 5 on silent except for one specific person? I want to have the phone on silent (no vibrate) and have it ring only for one or two specific people. Is there any way to do this?\nI know how to turn the phone on silent (the switch on the left side above the volume buttons), but I can't seem to create a \"profile\" for this (I recall this being possible with Blackberry's).\n\nA: There is a feature in the newer versions of iOS that is called \"Emergency bypass\". You can find it in Contacts > [person] > Edit > Ringtone > Emergency bypass. \nYour iPhone will ring regardless of Silent or Do Not Disturb modes on or off.\n\nA: This is possible using Do Not Disturb:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings.app\n\n*Go to Notifications > Do Not Disturb\n\n*Select \"Allow Calls From\"\n\n*You have several options. Either create a group, or have only those few people in your Favorites. The best is probably to create a group as that allows you better flexibility. After you have created the group with only the people that you want to allow to reach you, select it from the list. \n\n*Now, to enable silent mode except for those two people turn on Do Not Disturb in Settings.app.\n\n\nCreating/Editing Groups: This isn't as easy as it appears on iOS. See my question about it. As mentioned in the accepted answer, your best strategy for creating or editing groups is to go to iCloud.com on your computer. Quoting the answer:\n\n\"No, there is no way to create or edit contact groups on iOS. I share your frustration! The best workaround is to use iCloud.com (or your primary Mac, if you have it with you).\"\n\nBut you can add contacts to a particular group, (though it isn't straight-forward):\n\n  \n*\n  \n*In Contacts, tap the Groups button in the top left\n  \n*Tap \"Hide All Contacts\"\n  \n*Tap the group that you want to add the contact to (making it the only visible group)\n  \n*Tap Done in the top right\n  \n*Tap the Add button (+) in the top right\n  \n\nSo, the easiest is to just use a Mac (if you have one) or iCloud.com to create and add people to a group. After this is done, the new group with the people that you want to reach you should appear on iPhone.\n\nA: For those that do not have DND, assign a memorable individual ring tone to each one in the group so you'll even know who is calling. Then assign a silent sound as the default ring for everyone else. \n", "Q: Have Automator add original path to Spotlight Comment for a file when moving to the trash Is there a way to add the original path of a document as a Spotlight comment in Mountain Lion?\nI have created an automator workflow that automatically adds the Timestamp and user when a file is moved to trash.  It also touches the file, so that its modified date becomes when it was moved (unless of course it is subsequently changed).  This way I can find files I deleted by accident more easily.  If I also have the original path to the document then I can put it back from where it came (for example if I deleted from search results).\n\nA: I would just use Applescript to do it in a Run Applescript Action\non run {input, parameters}\n    set theDate to do shell script \"date +%Y_%m_%d_%H:%M:%S\"\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n\n        repeat with thisfile in input\n            set theComment to theDate & return & POSIX path of thisfile\n            set comment of (thisfile as alias) to theComment\n\n        return input\n    end tell\n\nend run\n\nThis sets the date stamp and path.\nIt should be simple to add your touch and delete code to this.\n\n\nA: @dunxd The Trash in Mac OS X has an option \n@BenjaminDobson wrote a tool using Foundation API that when added to your Finder toolbar tells you the path of selected item.\nSource: SuperUser.com\nYou can explore adding this tool to your Automator toolchain to get what you want.\n", "Q: How is Apple repairing iPhone 5 with damaged glass at the genius bar? iMore reported back in September that Apple retail stores would soon gain the capability to replace the glass in front of the screen in the store.\nHas anyone had a repair quoted or performed for an iPhone 5 where Apple didn't replace the entire unit?\nI've heard of out of warranty replacement phones for $229. Also, I know that there are 3rd party services that will do this repair. I'm asking about replacing just the glass in an Apple retail store.\n\nA: $150 without being covered by Apple Care warranty is a sweet deal. Our company purchases back the broken LCD from repair shops around the USA and this is really going to be stiff competition. There isn't anyone offering iPhone 5 LCD replacement for under $150 in any retail repair shop around the US. Their all between $160-$200. In the past Apple's repair prices haven't seemed like a business model they wanted to focus on. I'm left scratching my head at what this could mean for their future plans to compete with the boom of iPhone repair shops. I suppose it might not be as big of a deal since there are only so many Apple Genius Bar locations nationwide.\n\nA: It's possible if you encountered a particularly daring (and technically adept) AppleCare technician, but in my experience Apple does a straight swap for the entire phone.  There are not alot of FRU's in the iPhone outside of the SIM and SIM caddy.\n\nA: To more directly answer your question, look at step six of the iFixit teardown. The entire front \"display assembly\" is replaced.\n\nA: you can’t replace only the glass because the digitizer and LCD screen are fused to the glass. It’s not a little piece of glass that was probably made in China for under a dollar. It’s a special piece of glass combined with electronics that was made in China for quite a bit more than a dollar.\nIphone 5 screen lcd digitizer black\n", "Q: Which SSD Thunderbolt Product For Main Boot Drive for my iMac? So I have a 2012 iMac.  I got the base model 21.5\" which means I have a painfully slow 5400 RPM hard drive.  The pure SSD option would have cost $1,300 ($1 more than the $1,299 base price) if I could even get it but you had to get the 27\" to even have the option.\nThe iMac is very fast with the obvious bottleneck being the 5400 RPM HDD.  I want really a better than stock setup with insane speed. Considering that anything under $1,300 is actually a savings (lol) and with the possibility of even being superior in speed to the internal SSD.  The issue I'm most concerned with now in my choice is if it will be bootable.  This is especially true with the RAID options because as the ones in my price range are SOFTWARE RAID I wonder how it could be possible to be bootable?\nI've narrowed down my choices to these four options, in no particular order:\n\n\n*\n\n*OWC Mercury Helios 240GB\nEssentially a thunderbolt PCIe expansion chasis with fast PCI based SSD\n\n*Pegasus J2\nThunderbolt 2 x 128GB SSDs configured in RAID 0 \n\n*Pegasus J4\n4 drive thunderbolt 2.5\" storage chassis, RAID configurable\nI'll probably get 4 x 64 GB SSDs and configure them in RAID 0 or maybe RAID 10\n\n*LaCie Thunderbolt SSD 240GB\nKind of the same idea as J2\nAny advice would be excellent.  Feel free to make an alternative suggestion if you prefer.  I'm ready to go as soon as I can make a choice.\nAgain my machine is:\nApple iMac 21.5\", Late 2012 / i5 2.7 GHz / 8 GB RAM / 1 TB HDD / GeForce GT 640M 512MB DDR5 / OS X 10.8\n\nA: In the end I went with the most expensive but also the fastest option: #1 which was the Mercury Accelsior PCIe based SSD hardware RAID array (RAID 0 by default which I will keep) in a Mercury Helios Thunderbolt PCIe chassis.  The main reason was because it was the only one that mentioned it was bootable (and made a big deal out of that fact).\nI paid $799 for the 240 GB model (it's 128 GB X 2 minus the unusable amount...a nice touch for the seller not to count that).  It's got a lot of technology built into the card including processors and cache etc. to monitor and control the hardware RAID array including extra error checking and load leveling/balancing.  Also it's theoretically upgradable (each drive is called a \"blade\" and while they don't yet sell independent blades they may in the future).  Also the PCIe chassis is an extra bit of the investment that could live beyond the SSD, just like the whole arrangement could live beyond the use of my iMac itself.\nThis is a great review on it where they say it's \"really fast.  Ridiculously fast.\"\nA guy on youtube has a (somewhat boring) video of his Mac Pro taking 3 minutes to boot and launch paint shop pro with his hard drive and then after setting up one of these it cut down to 15 seconds!  Crazy balls out fast.\nThis is the sellers sites for;\n\n\n*\n\n*The Thunderbolt PCIe\nChassis\n\n*The SSD RAID\narray\n\n*And the bundled special of the two\nOf note is that if they didn't offer the bundle discount and if it were not so much more expensive I might have opted for this much more attractive chassis.\nOr for even more and larger chassis with multiple slots and supporting larger sized cards.\nThese chassis got me thinking about the possibilities with thunderbolt.  Now any iMac or MacBook can be as capable and expandable as a Mac Pro...there are even developments with video cards in one of these things!  I do wonder if it would be possible to take a MacBook Air and hook up a thunderbolt PCIe chassis with a high end graphics card with the display on the internal monitor?\nIf I was one of these manufacturers, or even Apple, I would consider making a full on chassis with PCIe slots and storage areas, etc.  I really wanted a Mac Pro but they were so old...now I can get some of that goodness piecemeal, though for a price. :-)\nI get the device about a week from now and will post back my impressions if anyone is interested.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 15\" 2011 - missing audio device (no sound driver) I have a problem with a 15\" MacBook Pro (2011, OSX 10.7.5): After being repaired due to a water damage recently, the sound was just working fine. Some days later the audio device in the status bar turned gray and the MacBook didn't play any audio anymore. \nAfter having tried several approaches to solve the problem (e.g. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1736638?start=345&tstart=0)\nSo I repaired HDD permissions and deleted ~Library/Preferences/com.apple.BezelServices.plist in normal and safe-mode of OSX.

As the soundcard was working fine temporarly I'm guessing it's just a software issue. \nHow can I come closer to a solution? \n\nA: I've resolved this before (grey icon, no sound) by resetting the PRAM.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off your Mac\n\n*Turn on your Mac\n\n*Hold Down Cmd-Opt-P-R\n\n*Keep Holding until you have heard the startup sound twice\nApple Support Document HT1379\n\nA: If resetting the PRAM doesn't work, you may try installing the latest Combo Update, like this one: \n\n\n*\n\n*OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 Update - https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1833?locale=en_US\n", "Q: Execute a custom script when OS X 10.8 is in Power nap? Apple new feature of OS X 10.8 in new Macs \"Power Nap\" checks email and does make backups.\nIs it possible to execute a custom script (bash, AppleScript,...) when OS X 10.8 is in Power nap mode? For example pull a git repository or download files.\n\nA: As far as I know, it's not possible. \nThe reason is that Power Nap doesn't have an API that 3rd party apps can hook into (so apps could trigger a wake event or be notified when one occurs).\nWhether this will remain like that in the future depends upon Apple. It would be interesting to see if there's a simple way to detect when one is in power nap mode, but doesn't seem to be available afaik. \nIf you leave a script that pulls from git every minute, in theory, since Power Nap is really a power on without graphics and audio state, maybe it would get executed (if it was running before). untested.\nMore info: https://stackoverflow.com/a/11692367/2684\n", "Q: How do I close all tabs on Safari for iPad after the app crashes My wife went to a site that tries to load a PDF that crashes Safari for iPad.  After trying to load Safari again, it tries to open up all of the tabs again including the one that is crashing Safari.  While its loading the tab it locks everything up so I can't switch tabs.  How do I break this endless cycle?  How can I close this tab or have Safari not try to reopen this tab?  Is it possible to do this without losing the history?\n\nA: *\n\n*Force-quit Safari (double-tap the home button, then tap and hold on the Safari icon until it shakes, then tap the red minus sign). \n\n*Go to Settings > Safari.  \n\n*Tap Clear History.\nThis should clear out all open tabs.\n\nA: I struggled through this last night and stumbled upon a solution.  Go to Settings > Safari.  Turn on private browsing.  It will ask you if you want to close all tabs before turning on private browsing.  Touch 'yes'.  Next turn private browsing back off.  Voila!  The browser works again!\n\nA: I know this question is nearly 5 years old, but in case someone else comes along with the same question... I've had this happen to me a few times, here's what you do. \nCompletely close Safari (i.e. after hitting the Home button, double-press the Home button to close it completely and remove it from memory). Then go into Settings and turn on Airplane Mode. \nNow enter Safari, it will probably complain that it can't load the webpage either because it has no internet connection or because Airplane Mode is on. Since Safari has no internet connection, it can't load the tabs, including whatever code is blocking you from closing tabs, and including the code that's crashing Safari. \nNow you can close the troublesome tab. All that's left is to turn Airplane Mode off again, and presto, the troublesome tab is gone while the tabs you want are still safe.\n\nA: If you know what site froze Safari, go to Settings Safari Advanced, press Edit and scroll down till you find the site, then delete its data. If the site is YouTube or some similar \"big\" site, it will be easy to find. This worked for me.\n\nA: Safari stopped being stuck when I began to recharge my iPad. And there was no need to reset anything, or to wipe the History. No open tabs were lost either. \n", "Q: Does iPad mini gets scratched easily without a case? I got my iPad mini a Belkin case for protection, but it made the iPad mini twice as thick.  The iPad mini without the case is so slim and I love it, so i'm wondering if it can do without the case and not get scratched in the back and front easily..\n\nA: I believe white one is more succeptible than black one. As far as the case, I picked up a clear case on ebay (shipped from Jersey) to go with my smart cover for $3.98 and it is pretty thin, maybe adds 2mm to the overall thickness. Just something to look at.\n\nA: Yes, and no, it really depends in what case you decide to use. Also without a case, it scratches amazingly fast.\n", "Q: iPod sound problems When my iPod's sound is off, the symbol to show that it's off stays on the screen for the whole time until I turn it up at least one notch.

And this is with and without headphones.\nDoes anyone know what might be causing this and how I can stop it happening?\n\nA: Your volume down button is stuck.\nIf there’s no damage and you’re in warranty, go get it replaced. If it’s quite old or damaged, and not worth $100 to fix, you can try to push/pull the volume buttons yourself. (If there’s a dent in the iPod metal housing near the buttons it may involve trying to bend or dent the housing to allow the buttons a little more room.)\nGood luck.\n", "Q: How to find out which process eats up memory?

The full output is put in this gist: https://gist.github.com/aleung/4760556\nWhat the way to diagnose OSX memory leak issue?\n\nA: Check with this command (will show more processes):\nsudo ps -awxm -o %mem,rss,comm | sort -nr | head\n\nif won't help, check with fs_usage to display system calls and page faults related to filesystem:\nsudo fs_usage -f filesys,diskio\n\nespecially page in and out by appending the following to above command:\n| egrep -i \"page_|pgin|pgout\"\n\nAdd extra | grep -v kernel to ignore kernel process or | grep -v 0.00 to show these with higher time spent.\nIf your swap is big, you can force disk cache to be flushed and emptied by: sudo purge.\nBased on my experience, OS X have some issues with managing the memory after higher uptime (when it used all of free memory), so sometimes only full restart may help.\nCheck also sudo iotop or sudo vm_stat 1 commands which may help.\nSee also: How to investigate high kernel task memory usage?\n", "Q: Macbook pro 2009 2.66 samsung SSD 830 won't boot internally I'm trying to install a Samsung 830 GB in a MacBook Pro 2.66 (2009). It boots and works perfectly external using USB (im using it now) but not internally, so I was wondering what I have to do to make things working.\nI'm running mountain lion 10.8.2\nI've searched this issue on Google but no one has come up with a definitive answer\n\nA: I afraid you might be in for a struggle having done this upgrade on a mid-2009 15\" MacBook Pro and I'm not alone in having the problem. I ended up having to replace the drive cable and switch to using an SATA2 rather than SATA3 drive to get an replacement drive (SSD or magnetic) to work. The problem is documented on the OWC web site.\nAs I recall, I got a larger replacement magnetic drive to work by downgrading the firmware but getting an SSD to work required upgrading to firmware, replacing the cable, and getting an SATA2 drive. If you already have the drive, start with the cable and maybe that will be good enough.\nI've cloned lots of drives to external drives and then swapped in the external drive for the internal without a problem so I think it's far more likely you have the hardware compatibility problem than a software issue.\nBTW, even with a SATA2 drive, the upgraded system flies.\n\nA: Okay while pending an answer on my comment on the question, im going to venture a \"pre answer\" if you will.\nSeems like if you CCC'd to the new drive externally there will be an issue with Lion/MLion's Recovery partition and will cause either the mount paths to be screwy, or the drive size to become incorrect.\nThis forum post seems to highlight a similar issue although different hardware.\nThe OP of the linked thread fixed his issue by connecting his old HDD externally, and inserting the new drive internally and then CCC'ing that way. It seems like what this does is solve the Mount path issues and allows the Recovery drive to be cloned properly.\nGood luck!

On a Mac, symbols are often used for keys rather than names. In Adobe Indesign for Mac, the keyboard shortcuts for inserting various break characters are described using what looks like an up arrow / caret / chevron pointing into a flat horizontal line:\n \nIt's the symbol on the right I'm asking about.\nAfter much searching, I found it on the far bottom right of the full-size Apple keyboard.

If so, how?\n\n\nA: It is called Projective, with Unicode U+2305, and it represents Enter which is different to Carriage Return, represented with a ↩. \nAlthough most of the time they work in the same way, there is a difference between Enter and Carriage Return. While Enter, in most cases, will make a GUI object operate at its default function, the Carriage Return is meant to reset the user's position to the beginning of the line of a text.\nJust doing fn+Return should trigger it. \nOn the short keyboards you'll either find the name or the icon.\n\n\n\nA: On my Mac, there is a Help menu.

We just purchased an iMac yesterday to view our travel videos. The thing is, all the videos we have stored on our external Hard Drive are in the .MTS file format (AVCHD). The thing is, the Mac or QuickTime won't recognize them. Are there any good / free file converters so we can convert the video files to .MOV as that seems to be the common file format for Macs.\nI read on-line that you can fool your computer into thinking that it is reading the video file straight from the Camcorder instead of from an external Hard Drive but you have to reorganize the storage or hierarchy of the videos. Apparently this can take up a lot of memory though - maybe up to 10 times the size of the original video file size? Is it a viable solution?\nWhat's the best / most straight-forward / preferably free way to get the videos into a usable format?\n\nA: Try VideoLan. It is free and should handle most kinds of video formats.\nThe method for recognising AVCHD format is with regard to Apple Video applications, and not QuickTime. Those applications have the reader for that format. But you're only interested in viewing them so I suggested VideoLan.\nAlso there is a QuickTime plugin which recognises many formats, but I have never tried it with AVCHD or MTS formats. It is called Perian. Please note that it is no longer supported in the form of updates but it is still offered on the official site.\n\nA: QuickTime Player\nQuickTime Player supports AVCHD files. The clips need to be converted first and must be mounted via a camera or external device. See OS X Mountain Lion: About AVCHD files and QuickTime Player for the specific details.\nWatch with VLC\nAs others have suggested, VideoLAN Client (VLC) is capable of watching your MTS files without needing conversion.\nConvert with Handbrake\nHandbrake is an open source tool that can transcode video, including MTS to MPEG4. As Scott Earle suggests, it provides a graphical interface for the underlying ffmpeg tool that performs the conversion.\nConvert with ffmpeg\nIf you want to use your MTS files in iMovie or other tools, consider converting them to MPEG4 first.\nThe open source tool ffmpeg can convert AVCHD/MTS files to a wide range of formats.\nThe simplest way of installing ffmpeg onto your computer is through the homebrew project. To install brew, launch Terminal.app and issue the command:\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)\"\n\nWith brew successfully installed, you can now install ffmpeg:\nbrew install ffmpeg\n\nThere are numerous tutorials for converting video formats with ffmpeg. A couple are linked below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Convert an AVCHD / MTS file to MP4 using ffmpeg\n\n*FFmpeg Tutorial: Convert MTS/M2TS(AVCHD) to AVI\nThe final command will approximate:\nffmpeg -i 00031.MTS -b:v 4000k 00031.MP4\n\n\nA: Newer versions of OS X (I think 10.9+) now support the AVCHD container. But if you extract just the .MTS files on their own it won't know what to do with them (which is a bit of a cop-out, because obviously apps like VLC can play them!).\nIf you just have MTS files, you can actually re-build an AVCHD container for them using Panasonic's AVCCam Restorer utility (both Mac & Windows).\nThis was a huge help for me, because I backed up only the MTS files for heaps of videos, because I didn't really understand the AVCHD container. I've been able to go back and re-make AVCHD containers for them, and then easily convert them out of that container into something simpler to manage (i.e. individual clips), without (lossy) transcoding.\n\nA: Try the free AVCHD to MOV Lite on the App Store to convert it to MOV format, and then import to Photos. This will remux the video (convert it without reprocessing/converting the audio or video) losslessly. \n(Hat tip to How can I convert .MTS file (AVCHD) to .mp4 by ffmpeg without re-encoding H264 video stream?\n).\n", "Q: Can GPS be used by more than 1 app at a time I'm looking at various apps which use GPS tracking, and was wondering if more than 1 app at a time was able to gain access to the GPS data?\nFor example I might want to use one app with route planning for cross country running in order to know where I should be going, and a second app to record where I actually went, and my speeds/splits/averages etc.\nBecause the apps are using the Background service for location data, does this limit which app is getting the data?  Only 1 music app at a time can play in the background, is the location background service different?\nI would test this myself, but the apps I am looking at are not free, and I don't want to pull the trigger if I cannot use them as I want.\n\nA: Yes, GPS can be used by more than one app at a time.

Command + ` intermittently stops working sometimes. There's no obvious pattern I have noticed it in both finder and in chrome. The windows are not minimised because I can move the current one and clearly see the one behind it. After a while it goes back.\nIt happens about 1-2 times a day. Any ideas?\n\nA: Quoting form Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for developers:\n\nUsers can view all of an app’s open windows by activating App Exposé. In App Exposé view, users can choose one of the open windows on the current desktop or scroll to find an open window on a different desktop. Users can also cycle forward or backward through an app’s open windows on the current desktop by using Command-Backquote and Command-Shift-Backquote. If full keyboard access is on, they can cycle through all windows by using Control-F4 and Shift-Control-F4.\n\nAs it relates to your question, it is important to point out that the above quote from the HIG talks about cycling through \"open windows on the current desktop\". I presume that excludes windows that have been minimized to the dock. That may explain some of the inconsistencies that you see. \nThe takeaway here is that while the OS may try to standardize certain keyboard shortcuts, this only work if each app developer  implements their app using standard AppKit controls. The less standard the controls look (like Chrome), it is likely that the standard keyboard shortcuts will not function as you expect. \nAs a side note, even within apps that do use AppKit, they may implement certain shortchuts like tab-switching in a different way. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: How to clean up emails when replying in plain text? I have a problem that I want to solve after many years of using Mac OS X Mail.app... I generally like to send plain text emails that are full width (format=flowed) and nicely indented for quote levels. When I receive emails that are in HTML my problems begin.

What I want is to be able to end up with clean flowed plain text replies with nice quote levels. \nHas anybody else seen this behaviour or seen a plugin/app that can solve these issues?\n\nA: I haven't seen a good universal solution, but have found that by selecting only the bare minimum text I need to reply to, I can often get a clean, clear reply that doesn't need substantial (or even any) clean up when replying in plain text.\nSadly, the best solution for presenting these emails cleanly is a powerful email client like elm. BBedit, Safari's reader and Coda 2 are all in my toolchain for taking a complicated HTML document and thinning it down but it's awkward to send the text to a second program, operate on the document and then get it back into a reply using Mail. \nI wish I could serve you up a delicious cake of a plug in, but sadly, the Mail plug in scene isn't lucrative and this use case doesn't have a champion that's programming a better converter than the one Apple has provided.\nOf the reviews of plug-ins, these are the best:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.tikouka.net/mailapp/\n\n*http://www.macworld.com/product/collection/6866/mailaddons.html\nAnd if QuoteFix won't work for you, you may have to program this yourself.

I would like to upgrade from Lion Server to Mountain Lion Server, but am concerned that at some point during the process — especially since the server provides the DHCP service for my network, including the machine from which I access the server — I will be unable to access the server using ARD.\nCan I perform the upgrade process entirely over ARD, or do I need to dig up a keyboard and monitor and connect them to the server box?\n\nA: Basically, I think the answer is Yes if your server has an static IP, and your client is on the same network.\nBut that's in theory of course. For example, if both your computers are in a network without DHCP, they will assign themselves with an IP starting with 169.254., link-local IPs. Now, the computers know that each other exists, and can still connect to each other with that IP.\nNow, the question is simple, you need to know what your server's IP is when the DHCP is gone, and no one can assign IP address to them. And since you won't know, put a static IP on, and it would work.\nThat's in theory again. But I've had situation like these, and it did work for me.\nAnyway, good luck!\n", "Q: Blue screen when booting from USB backup of Mountain Lion I've not been able to startup my MacBook Pro. I made a backup of Mountain Lion using Lion DiskMaker 2.0.2. When I press option and the power button then select the USB drive, the grey screen with the apple logo and spinner appears then shortly after I get a solid royal blue screen. Is there anyway I can boot from the USB drive backup to fix my computer?\n\nA: Lion Disk Maker is a third-party utility. It’s likely that updates to OS X changed the startup behavior slightly for how your machine operates.\nAny reason you wouldn’t use Recovery Disk? (Command + R on boot.)\nYou can also try booting to the USB drive, but enable verbose mode (before you select the USB drive, hold down Command + V) to see if there are particular errors shown when it is at that blue screen.\nLast bit of hope: the author appears receptive to personal technical support questions by e-mail (that’s pretty cool).\n\nA: This blue screen indicates that the user portion of the login process has started, and is hung.\nHow exactly did you get the InstallESD / Mountain Lion installer? What exact hardware downloaded the installer and is that the same hardware as you are trying to boot? If so, then you can conclude that either the copy process failed or drive / hardware is faulty.\nIf not, you might have a perfectly working USB to run an installer - for the hardware that downloaded the initial package but not the hardware you are now trying to install from this package.\nIt's not really an answer, but Apple hopes that everyone will avoid this tracking of InstallESD versions and hardware dependency by using a Recovery HD on each drive. That would be the ideal way to re-install your OS since it's more closely tied to the hardware and less likely to run into conflicts unless you take a HD from one Mac and move it to another.\n", "Q: Apple headphone remote doesn't always work Once every couple of days or so I'll plug my apple headphones in (the new ear pods) and the volume/play/skip controls will fail to work.  In order to get them working I need to unplug and re-plugin.  It's not that big of a deal to do so, however I'm wondering if anyone has experienced this or knows why it happens.\n\nA: There are 4 contact areas (poles) on your headphone jack, off the top of my head it's Left Audio, Right Audio, Ground and Control (doesn't matter of this isn't wholly right) and each one when inserted into the socket forces a tiny switch to be pushed in, thus alerting the device to the presence of something plugged in.\nMy google-fu cannot get a diagram as it would explain it better, but when you insert the headphone end into the socket, you are essentially applying vertical force to the rounded end of a tiny sprung push switch, and forcing it to move horizontally to engage the switch mechanism.  It's doing this 4 times against 4 tiny switches.\nWhen these switches get gummed up, they can act odd.  It's not hard to see how they can get dirty given that they are essentially open to the environment, albeit down a little hole.  More common is the switches refusing to reset to the normal position when you take the headphones out, resulting in muted devices as it still thinks headphones are attached, but it's perfectly possibly for them to not push in properly too, or have enough dirt accumulated to make a poor contact.\nTo rectify it, insert and remove your headphone jack loads of times as fast as you can, spin it round in the socket, and generally agitate the switch mechanisms.  Some would have you apply a tiny bit of WD-40 to the headphone end (Don't spray into the socket!) first.\n", "Q: Syncing iphones with Android phone We run a small business, and the managers would like to have the calendars on their phones synced with each other so that they know what is going on with the other.  Most of them are using iphone and one is using an android phone.  Is there a calendar app that we can use.  Any information is appreciated. \n\nA: You have several options:\nYour first option is to use a \"third-party\" app that works for both iPhone and Android. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://synkmonkey.me/\n\n*http://www.cozi.com/mobile-access.htm (I personally know someone that, IIRC, uses this)\n\n\n\nYour other option is to use a shared calendar in a service such as Gmail. I personally think this solution is better. You have two options: either setup an arbitrary email account that all the managers use to sync their calendar to, such as [your-company-calendar]@gmail.com, or, you create a calendar, and if all the managers have their own Gmail accounts, make them all owners of it. This allows you to use the default, built in, calendar app on both Android and iOS devices.\nTo set this up (I am generalizing the steps that work with both setups):\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in to Google and create a calendar.\n\n*If everyone has their own Gmail accounts, share it with all the managers and make everyone an owner. If not, there is no need to share the calendar.\n\n*On iPhone (I'm assuming Android would be somewhat similar) create a new email account and log on to the new centralized Gmail account - if this is the route you want to take. After logging in to the account on each device, leave calendars on, but disable email.\n\n*If you aren't doing a centralized Gmail account, make sure everyone is signed into the Gmail accounts, on their phones, that you have used to make them owners of the calendars. \n\n\nThis should allow them to look up, and create events from the default calendar app on the devices. \n\nA: Shared Calenders work between Android and Iphone using Gmail on both phones. See these instructions Shared Calendar:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a Gmail account for the shared calendar. I recommend you create a new one instead of using a regular personal account.\n\n\n*On an iPhone open the Settings App and choose Mail, Contacts, Calendar, then “Add Account…”;  Choose Gmail as the account type enter the account information for your family calender account. Once finished go back to  the Mail, Contacts and Calendar  settings screen and scroll toward the bottom. Find the the “Default Calendar” setting and choose the new Gmail account you just added for your shared family calendar.\n\n\n*On an Android phone press the Gmail icon and choose “Add Account” (You can also add an account from the System Settings menu). Make sure you choose to sync the calendar during setup. After setting up the account ensure that the calendar for the new account is set to be display by checking under settings in the Calendar App. Unfortunately, I was not able to find a default calendar setting for new events on Android. You will need to make sure when create a new event that the right calendar is selected before saving the event.\n\n", "Q: iPhone claiming low battery in cold weather With the cold weather, a rather odd problem appeared on my iPhone 4S – whenever I use the phone in weather below ~12 °C, it turns itself off and claims to be out of battery. This most often occurs when the battery is at 20-30 %, but isn't limited to that at all.\nWhen it happens, I've found that rubbing the phone to heat it up helps, but that is a temporary fix, as it turns itself off again if exposed to cold again for a couple of minutes.\nThe fix has worked for quite a while, but it seems the phone can handle less and less cold - starting at about 10 minutes in -10 °C at 10 % battery left when it first happened, to about 3 minutes in 10 °C with 30 % battery. Therefore I have to ask – what can I do about it? I guess it will most likely have to be sent in for a replacement or repair, but I doubt this is covered by the phone's warranty (at least Apple's own)?\n\nA: I would question two things about your framing of the issue (and will sidestep the whole repair discussion/issue entirely):\n1) Apple's warranty does cover batteries that don't retain a percentage of their useful life based on aging at one, two and three years (two for most iOS warranty / coverage, but there are exceptions in some cases). You should open a ticket with them if you have coverage and see if they will repair it for you.\n2) I use an iPhone regularly outdoors when the temperature reaches -30 C and even then, the decrease in capacity is temporary. While the device is colder than 0C - you get less juice out of the cell, but once you warm it (in a pocket, next to your skin to warm it temporarily - or when you are inside a heated space for long enough to warm the battery), the devices recover full capacity. \n(You will want to watch to control condensation to prevent liquid damage / especially if you bring a very cold device into a warm humid space, that warm air will carry liquid inside the product. Similarly, a warm device when rapidly cooled could have liquid condense inside it and then freeze.) Devices left in a car overnight such as iPad and Mac also see no measurable decrease in battery life once I get them inside and warm - whether I charge them or not.\nI'll leave the DIY repair / pay for a repair discussion for another thread where you get specific on what model, but from what I see, the environmental behavior is that cold batteries still have all the charge they took, but they don't produce as much voltage and current while they are cold.\n\nA: The operating temperature of an iPhone 4s is 0 to 35 degrees Celsius (source: http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_iphone/family/iphone4s). At minus 12 degrees C, you're below the threshold so your phone behavior is expected. \nTo keep iPhone warm in cold environment, I put it in the inner vest or jacket pocket as that will be warmer with the insulation and proximity with the body. So far no problem from phone not working. The main problem is my gloves prevent my fingers from touching the glass surface resulting in unintended app actions.\n\nA: There was a recent article by CNN that suggested a case company \"Salt Cases\" that makes thermally protective cases. I found their site on the web at: http://www.saltcases.com \nThe CNN article was pretty interesting too:\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2013/12/13/tech/mobile/cold-weather-phones/\n", "Q: Configure an Airport to connect to internet via a wireless hotspot? The situation:  I have free access to Time Warner (TWC) and Optimum hotspots around the USA.  Conveniently one is located within range to my apartment.  I would like to setup an Airport Extreme or Express to use this wireless internet connection instead of the traditional way of plugging in via ethernet.\nIn my Optimum account settings I can register a MAC address (i.e. my Airport's MAC address) that allows me to bypass any authentication.  Is there no mode in Airport Utility that allows me to simply source my internet connection from another wireless network?  My end result is to have a normal, functioning, NAT / DHCP network in my home.\n\nA: Here's how I would do it:\nI would use any old router to bridge from the hotspot into your house, making sure that the bridge is in optimal distance of the Provider Hotspot. \nOnce I have that configured and I know I have connectivity to the internet, I would hardwire the Airport Extreme into the bridge to have the home networking functionality, as set up through Airport Utility.\n", "Q: What version of Silverlight works with the latest 10.7 release? Can you install Microsoft Silverlight from microsoft.com and are you able to open the Preferences without it crashing?\nI'm trying to isolate this problem, and it could be a Mac problem, or a Silverlight problem.\nI am hearing that it works fine on some people's Macs and not on others, but there is no obvious pattern to it.  It could be that it doesn't work on particular versions of Mac OS X, or it could be that 3rd party software that some people use, messes up Silverlight.\nUnfortunately, I don't have a Mac lab to try it out on several computers so I would really appreciate some feedback on this if you have a Mac.\nIf you have a PowerPC based chipset or a Mac with a version older than 10.6 (Snow Leopard) then you probably should not bother testing this because Silverlight only supports Intel chipsets and 10.6 and up.\nIf you are able to test out the latest version of Silverlight 5, please list your exact Mac OS X version, and what version of Silverlight installed fine for you. \nI'm wondering what version of silverlight works best with Lion?\n\nA: Silverlight - 5.0.61118.0\nMacBookPro9,2\n50 - 10.7.5(11G63)\n5 - 10.8.2(12A269)\nSilverlight Prefs come up just fine.\nInstalled programs: \nChrome 24\nSafari 6 \nFirefox 18\nAll updates\niLife\niWork\nOffice 2008\nAdobe CS3\nVLC\nSmart Notebook\n\nA: No. I get a crash.   Have latest Silverlight 5.1.20125.0 and 10.8.4 on a Mac Pro (mid 2008) with 16GB and Radeon 5770.  Very frustrating.  Crashes in Safari and Chrome.  Have not tried FF but have no real hope. \n", "Q: How to monitor logins to Screen Sharing and SSH? Not trusting anyone, not even my own firewalls and other measures against invasive hackers, I like to be able to monitor any successful login to my OS X systems (e.g. by instantly sending an email to my gmail account).\nHow do I accomplish this, including logins via Screen Sharing and SSH?\nI can see that the secure.log file lists such logins, but how do I monitor them, and filter them for successful logins, in order to issue emails about these events?\nUser bmike suggested using the tail command on the secure.log file. I found that this command has an option \"-F\" that is well suited for this task: I keeps reporting added lines to the log file, and even handles log file rotations.\nBut this is not sufficient for my needs yet. I only want to send out the notifications if an external access (login) occured, not every time a local task is getting authorized.\nHere's an excerpt from my secure.log file:\nmymac login[26292]: in pam_sm_acct_mgmt(): OpenDirectory - Membership cache TTL set to 1800.\nmymac login[26292]: in od_record_check_pwpolicy(): retval: 0\nmymac login[26292]: in od_record_attribute_create_cfstring(): returned 3 attributes for dsAttrTypeStandard:AuthenticationAuthority\nmymac sudo[26296]:    myname : 3 incorrect password attempts ; TTY=ttys005 ; PWD=/Users/myname ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/bash\nmymac sudo[26301]:    myname : TTY=ttys005 ; PWD=/Users/myname ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/bash\nmymac com.apple.SecurityServer[27]: Succeeded authorizing right 'system.hdd.smart' by client '/Library/Application Support/iStat local/iStatLocalDaemon' [133] for authorization created by '/Library/Application Support/iStat local/iStatLocalDaemon' [133]\nmymac sshd[26308]: Accepted publickey for myname from x.x.x.x port 62433 ssh2\nmymac screensharingd[26328]: Authentication: SUCCEEDED :: User Name: John Doe :: Viewer Address: x.x.x.x :: Type: DH\n\nOnly the \"screensharingd\" and \"sshd\" ones are relevant to me in this example. But there seems to be no clear distinction between these and the other local authorizations. The only common pattern I find is the IP address, but is that fail-safe? I guess to make my script generally useable (by anyone), I'd have to not only detect IPv4 addresses but also IPv6 addresses. And can I be sure that other external types of logins (e.g. file sharing) will also list a IP address in their raw format like this? Not ever using symbolic names that I wouldn't be able to detect with this pattern?\nActually, I also logged in via File Sharing (AFP) - that didn't even get listed in secure.log, oddly! Which means that secure.log is probably not the only or not the central point of learning about authorizations.\nI had hoped that there's some central point in OSX that takes care of all username/password authorizations and that this point would also provide some hook for monitoring.\nI am afraid my question can't be answered sufficiently in a generic way. I'll go now and ask on Apple's security mailing list. I'll report back.\nBackground:\nMy reasoning for this kind of question is that I think that no system is safe from break-in. Therefore, relying on measures to prevent a break-in are not a safe measure alone. Adding (external) notifications about when a login into a system happens is what makes it much better controllable: If someone manages to break in, he'll be detected by this method, and so the system is then known not to be trusted any more and will be dealt with. Without this kind of monitoring, someone might be able to break in and then modify the system to a point where someone looking later won't be able to tell what happened, assuming the system is still safe.\n\nA: Yes - it would be more efficient to tail -f the log file so that your script only has to parse each line in the file once rather an once per interval. \nOf course, you then still need to write and test the code to monitor for times when the logfile gets rotated and perhaps double check at you didn't miss an event by scanning the entire new file once when you first attach to that file. \nWhat is best is a trade off between your comfort level and your skills. It MIT also make sense to sniff the network traffic since screen sharing listens on known ports, or you could monitor for new processes listening on new ports or you could turn on process auditing and monitor those logs or you could parse the process table. There are many ways to skin this cat. \n\nA: If you have already worked out how to mine the information from the log, then a simple way of getting it to run only when required rather than polling it every day/hour etc is to add the script as a login action to the users in question.  Get them to interpret the logs, work out if it's a local or remote login, and email (or imessage etc) appropriately.\n", "Q: Mac book Crashed - can only get folder with Question mark on it My Macbook for what ever reason has decided to just give me a flashing folder with a question mark on it.\nI have tried restarting holding the Apple key and R - Nothing. I have also tried holding the ALT key on bootup but it just gives me an arrow curser and nothing else.\nI am not sure if the hard drive is even bootable. I do not have a OS Disc.\nI have downloaded a DMG file off the internet to my Pen Drive. I assumed incorrectly the OS would boot from my Pen Drive - it does not.\nI have cable internet if needed.\nI have Windows 7 Ultimate  which I can connect to the internet from, and I have an iPad if that would help.\n\nA: This icon means that your Mac can't find a bootable disk.  Your iPad definitely won't help; your pen drive, internet access, and Win7 disc might or might not help.\nBased on the model number that you've given, you have a white MacBook from 2006.  That means that the OS that came with it was probably 10.4 (\"Tiger\").  It could also have either 10.5 (\"Leopard\") or 10.6 (\"Snow Leopard\") on it if it was upgraded at some point during its lifetime.  This MacBook cannot support anything later than 10.6 (it will not work with either 10.7 \"Lion\" or 10.8 \"Mountain Lion\").  This laptop is long out of warranty.  If you are close to an Apple Store, since it appears that you don't have a lot of experience with Macs, you could try to schedule an appointment at their Genius Bar and see if they're willing to help you out.  They'll probably be willing to run the necessary diagnostics to see whether you're experiencing a major hardware failure, such as a failed hard disk.  However, if you have a piece of failed hardware, their cost to fix it is probably going to be more than the cost of buying a working Mac of a similar vintage.  If it is a piece of failed hardware and you're comfortable replacing the hardware on your own, I've found that Other World Computing has good prices for replacement parts, and they also include excellent step-by-step instructions for doing the replacement.  If it's not failed hardware, they might or might not be willing to help you get a new OS installed.  It doesn't hurt to ask. \nYou say that you've downloaded a DMG file off of the Internet, but I don't know what DMG file you have.  You need a bootable version of either 10.4, 10.5, or 10.6.  You can buy physical DVDs for each of these off of Amazon or other sources.  You can't use the installation discs from another MacBook to install the OS onto your MacBook (unless it's the exact same model as your MacBook).  To install from a DVD, you'll either need the installation discs from an identical MacBook, or the retail DVD (which is what you'll find on Amazon).  Once you have the DVD, put it in your drive and hold down the C key when you power up the MacBook.  If the installation starts, then you're probably going to be okay.  Go through the installation steps for the OS.  If you run into trouble during installation, Apple has some excellent installation troubleshooting steps.\nIf you don't want to run OS X on this laptop, you could just use it to run Windows.  The specifications are better than the minimum specifications to run Windows 7, so you could just use that.  There's an extensive set of instructions for installing Win7 on a MacBook Air, which should work for your MacBook too.  Those instructions go through the whole process in detail, from creating a bootable USB drive (which will require access to a Windows computer) to installing it on your Mac.\n\nA: The flashing question mark means the computer can not find your system folder to boot from.\nIf your Pen Drive has a bootable system folder on it, hold down the option key when booting you computer. The OS will then give you the option to choose a new system folder to boot into. If there is a viable one available.\n\nA: Had the same problem. I had an extra battery, \nso I switched out batteries and now my Mac is running fine. If you don't have an extra battery just take out your battery for a couple of seconds and then reinstall it.\n\nA: Hopefully I can link this here. i found this and thought I would add just in case someone else runs across this. The idea is to force a rewrite of the Master Boot Record, quoting directly the relevant part:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from the OS X install disk.\n\n\n*Instead of installing OS X, selectDisk Utility from the Tools menu.\n\n\n*Select the hard drive that is having the problem in the list on the left.\n\n\n*Now select the Partitions tab in the right side of the panel.\n\n\n*If you have one partition, this part is easy. Simply use the slider in the bottom right corner of the partition diagram to resize the partition, then put it back where it was. If you have multiple partitions take note of the size of the partition you’re resizing so you can get it back to right where it was before.\n\n\n*After putting the partition size back the way you found it click the Apply button. You’ll be asked to confirm the decision and told that its non-destructive.\n\n\nA: Your Mac can't find the Hard Disk.  If you have your original start up disk you could try booting and holding down the C key. Then follow instructions to repair. Or Boot and hold down the 'X' key, this should give you a black padlock and your PW will get you a choice of whatever start up options are available. If nothing works you may have to replace your HDD\n\nA: i have had the same problem but after taking out the HD, I found it to be in 100% fully working order\neither the cable to the HD is faulty or the logic board is faulty.\nI wanted to state this as all the answers suggest the HD is broken and this may not necessarily be the issue\n\nA: Same question mark on my 2013 MacBook Pro.   I got it into recover mode but it couldn't find the hard drive. I restarted it and just let it sit with the question mark flashing. \nJust as I was starting to cry (no backup for 27 days) it started up perfectly-  seemingly out of nowhere. \nPerhaps it got too hot?\n", "Q: Smart Folders: What is the difference between \"This Mac\" and \"All My Files\"? What is the difference between \"This Mac\" and \"All My Files\"?\n\nA: All my files could contain files from mounted or networked drives.\n\nA: \"All My Files\" will only find files that match the search criterion and not, for example, folders or emails even though they also match it.   'This Mac' finds everything that matches the search no matter what it is - file, folder or email. You can test this by creating a file and a folder of the same unique name and searching in \"This Mac' and 'All My Files\" - the 'All My Files\" will not find the folder.\n", "Q: Smart Folder: how to create listing of all files in a folder? I want to create a Smart Folder which just lists all files of my ~/Music directory - i.e. just a flattened version of that folder.\nHow can I do this?\n(I tried to type * in the search field, but that doesn't list all files.)\n\nA: By default, the Spotlight GUI in the Finder will not let you use wildcards or other advanced syntax. However, by using the Raw Query search criterion, you can use all the syntax available to the command-line mdfind utility:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to your ~/Music folder\n\n*Hit ⌘ F\n\n*Double-check the Scope Bar of the search to make sure Spotlight is just searching your Music folder\n\n*Hit the \"+\" button to add a search criterion\n\n*From the criteria drop-down menu, check if the Raw Query criterion is visible (it isn't by default). If not, click Other... and a criteria list will appear.

So long as this criterion is set to \"Visible or Invisible\", all files below the present folder will be shown (you can optionally change this to \"Visible Items\" you don't want dot-files in the results)\n\n\nA: It looks like just typing a . in the search field shows all files, but not folders. \n\nA: Am I missing something, but this seems really simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to your ~/Music folder\n\n*Hit ⌘F\n\n*Set to Kind is Music \n\n*Click Save on the top right and you should be good to go.\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE:\nHere's v2 where I just set it to File Size is greater than 0KB and get all files in the Music folder\n\n\nA: I know you want a smart folder, but in the absence of that, you can use Terminal:\nls -R ~/Music\nThis will give you a list, but I think what you want is to be able to see the files and access them directly. \n", "Q: Music synced with iTunes has a very low volume on iPhone? I noticed that recently when I sync my music from iTunes to the iPhone, the volume of the music is very very slow. \nFor example, I can barely hear it while biking on the street, or if I'm in noisy environment.\nFor sure some albums were louder than others, but I believe in the past it was much louder on average.\nthanks\n\nA: You might have selected \"Sound Check\" (which will adjust your song volumes). Look at your iTunes preferences -> Playback to see if that is the case. Turning it off might help.\n\nA: You might have enabled a volume limit (Preferences>Music) which redefines what \"maximum volume\" means on the sliders, although it's very unlikely you would do that accidentally.\n\nA: This happened to me too. I went from having a iPhone 4s from July manufacturing with music on it that played back in my headphones as loud as it did from my iPad. Then my vibrate stoped working so I got it replaced at the apple store.

How's the winter this year? I mean: How cold is it? And how are you carrying your iPhone around? Inside your trouser's pocket? Or inside your coat's pocket? So yeah, maybe it sufferd from extreme differences in temperature plus condensation.\n\nA: I would say from the cloudiness around the edges of your screen it looks like water damage and the fact that there are water droplets (or appear to be) on the phone in the pictures I would check the water sensors very closely (in the headphone jack and in the charge port) if they are even the slightest color of pink your probably not going to have much luck at the Apple store unless you get real lucky and get a newbe at the Genius Bar. Good luck with it though.\n\nA: On August 25th, I made an appointment with a Genius and took the device to the Apple Store.\nWeirdly, he said that there was no liquid sensor inside the device (I've never removed it) and that he would ignore that but that it does look like liquid damage. He said that there's no point replacing just the display, as other components may be damaged, and that I'd have to buy a replacement device for £180 (reduced, due to the fact that it was still in warranty).\n\nA: It’s condensation, same thing happened to me after I left my phone next to the bath which I had really hot. Same cloudy effect and diagonal lines. \n\nA: I think is due to temperature difference. I have no problem using it in Australia for many years. I was in northern Sweden (Umea) last year December and I found this weird screen appear. I asked Apple Sweden and they said it might be due to extreme difference in temperature that cause this. Northern Sweden was -11 on Christmas period. Well... I think if you read in the instruction, there is a certain temperature range for Apple iPhone to be stable . :) \nI would definitely get back to Apple Australia and ask for opinion and help. Hope it helps.\n", "Q: Remove all references to Parallels 7 Windows 7 VM programs My system has been polluted with references to programs residing in a Windows 7 VM in Parallels 7.\nFor example, Windows programs show up in Spotlight, and in Safari settings under General->Default browser I get an annoyingly long list of irrelevant Windows programs.\nI've tried to disable \"Share Windows applications with Mac\" in Parallels settings, to no avail.\nThis blog post suggests to add the Applications (Parallels) folder to the Spotlight privacy list, but I can't do that because I don't have that folder.

My own knowledge is not very profound, so please bear that in mind with your answers. I am somewhat more at home with Unix than with Mac Os, but still no expert.\nI realize that I would at least need her Mac's IP address. However, I think her computer gets its IP address from DHCP, so it would presumably change every time she turns her computer on or off. I suppose she could email me the IP address when she has problems, but that's not ideal.\nDo I need to buy software for this task, or can I manage with facilities provided as standard by Apple? Does it matter which OS we work on? I am still working on 10.6.8, and I'm not sure what her iMac is running.\n\nA: There are many ways to achieve your goal. Apple has its own product: Apple Remote Desktop.\nBut in your case I would suggest another tool called Teamviewer. It is free for non-commercial use and easy to handle. Both sides (you and your friend) have to install the teamviewer application. When startet, you don't have to bother with IP adresses or whatsoever. Teamviewer will give you an ID and a password which is enough to connect to your friends mac.\nIt is platform indipendend and will work also on lots of Linux distributions.\nAnother nice, maybe even easier to use but non-free service is Gotoassist. This service does not need to install software on the remote machine. The remote machine just has to open a specific link in browser and you're done.\nAs I mentioned before, there are many other possibilities depending on the type of support one wants to offer, for example: SSH or VNC.\n\nA: On your friend Mac :\nSystem Preferences / Sharing / Screen Sharing\nOn your Mac :\nCmd+K / Type vnc://IP_ofyourfriend\nUsing bonjour name (.local, you find this in SysPref/Sharing) will be more reliable than an IP as it does not change dynamically.\nIf you are not on the same LAN, it becomes tricky (PAT/ VNC over SSH tunnel / VPN)\nYou don't want to hear about that.\nFlorian\n", "Q: Is there an easier keyboard shortcut for taking a screenshot on OSX 10.5? I'm running OSX 10.5 and was wondering if there is an easier way to make screenshots which save to clipboard?\nI know I can use:\nCMD+CTRL+SHIFT+4\nHowever this is hard on the fingers.\n\nA: You can set up a custom shortcut, for example a key, for that purpose.\nOpen System Prefrences, go to Keyboard -> Screen Shots (or navigate to the Screen Shot-options), and double click on the shortcuts you want to change to change them to the keys you use less frequently. If you have a huge keyboard like me, you can for example set the F5 and F6 to be the shortcuts.\nHere is a screen shot of the settings window where you set the shortcut (captured with those as well!) The \"Copy\"-screenshots are the ones with Control+Shift.\n\n", "Q: Time Machine is doing very large backups Background: I bought new drive for Time Machine backup. First backup took about an hour and backed up about 80 GB (let's considered as good behaviour). Second backup was supposed to be above 70 GB (bad behaviour, bad) which could not really be the amount of data actually changed for the while between backups. \nWhen i try manually run tmutil compare in iTerm, it returns a bit more sense making numbers\n\n\"supposed to be above\" comes from estimated size in Time Machine preference pane. \n\"actually 10 MB changed\" comes from terminal tmutil compare result. \nI think it's wrong it's backing up almost whole drive again. I know the backups consists of actual files and links to not changed files from previous backup. But the links should not consume same size as the linked file and according to free space after second backup the second backup is really consuming the space almost like first(full) backup (checked in disk utility)\nQuestion: How can i prevent Time Machine to make so big backups when actually 10 MB changed?\n\nA: Time Machine is using differential backups. That means your first backup is a complete backup which is same size with your drive. Starting from the second one backup will include changed files since last backup.  \nThese Backups are accessible by finder. So you can easily find out which folders causes these big backups. After you find the folders you can manually exclude these folders from Time Machine Backup Options. \nSome softwares may cause huge backups if they changes files last updated status like Dropbox Agent or similar. You may consider exclude folders of these softwares because they are already copied to the cloud.\n\nA: Since you do not provide much hard data data it's difficult to speculate what your problem is and that's assuming there actually is a problem, and I am not convinced that there is. You say your first backup is 80 GB, but how much data is actually stored on your drive(s)? Considering TM is \"smart\" enough to not backup ephemeral data like caches and that you also may have explicitly excluded data from backups such as data that is both stored and managed elsewhere, like things stored on DropBox, I have no idea what 80 GB means. Also, there is a long list of reasons why your second backup is almost as big as the fist. One possibility is that the backup criteria changed since your last backup so that fines which were not included initially now are. The other possibility- already mentioned- is that another sync or backup tool is \"touching\" your files and making them have dates which indicate the file has been updated when it hasn't. Hopefully, this is not the case because this would be a BAD THING regardless of the circumstances with your backups. Another one is that since you started backing up, maybe you kept a local backup store of an iPhone or iPad. Finally, if you have a large data store (like a database) even a small change to it will update all of the database files (depending on the database) and force an update of it. It will do this every time you update this database.\nHonestly, I could go on and on with speculations here because there is so little information. One thing I wonder is how are your update backups working now? Can you show the size of each of the updates? Also, what OS and version are you on? Finally, how big is/are the file system(s) that you are backup up? What are you explicitly excluding?\nIf you an provide a little more I'll be happy to help.\n", "Q: I want to remove an entry in my $PATH I'm running OS 10.8.

Both are set up for wireless synching.  \nWhen I start iTunes, it finds the iPod and synchs with it wirelessly without trouble, but it doesn't find the iPhone, forcing me to connect it to synch with the dock cable.  \nIf I disable wireless synching for the iPhone in iTunes, synch, re-enable wireless synching and synch again, wireless synching returns and works again.  \nUntil such time as I quit iTunes and restart it.  \nWhy does this keep happening?  It can't be a network/firewall problem, because the iPod keeps on synching with the same machine through the same network.  Needless to say I'm finding this pretty frustrating, what's the point of wireless synch if you keep having to re-enable it with the dock cable every time you start iTunes? \n\nA: I've been investigating this problem for a number of years now and I've concluded the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Most home wireless/wired routers do not support Multicast-DNS forwarding between wireless and wired network segments.\n\n*If both your server (iTunes) device and your client (iPhone/iPad,etc.) are on the same segment (i.e. wireless), then iTunes wireless sync should be more or less stable.\n\n*If your server and clients are on different network segments (i.e wireless and wired), you will have mixed success with running a stable wireless sync.\nMy solution was to buy an enterprise firewall (FortiGate) and create one virtual layer-two segment, encompassing all the wireless and wired interfaces on my home network.\nThis has stabilised wireless sync.\n\nA: I'm assuming that iTunes itself is the problem here--and seem always to suggest this, but I would trash my iTunes plist file in ~/Library/Preferences: com.apple.iTunes.plist . \nAnd probably the one in ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost, which will be called com.apple.iTunes.xxxxxxxxxx.plist (some long number) as well.\nWhen apps act up, corrupt Preferences files are often at fault. This used to be common knowledge among Mac users. There are utilities that will check them all, but simply trashing any relevant plists is the easiest first step to Troubleshooting. If there are settings one might forget, they can always be written down first. But no harm is done--apps rebuild their Preferences at next launch, although then of course the user has to create their personal settings again.\n\nA: I have the same experience with my iPhone disconnecting from iTunes.  It returns, however, after rebooting the iPhone.

Is there a way to do that?\nMac OS 10.8.2.\n\nA: Time Capsule is actually just an AFP host.  You can configure any device that serves the AFP protocol to be a Time Machine backup destination.\nHowever, if the device does not support AFP, it takes some work on the client to get TM to use it as a destination.\nYou can see the results of that question here:\nTime Machine over SMB/CIFS share?\n", "Q: iCloud shared calendars won't stay in view only I'm trying to share a calendar with my partner, and she is attempting to do likewise with me.\nThe first issue is that when sharing a calendar you do not get to select a permissions level, which has to be amended after it has been shared from the default or read/write to view only.  There's no fix for this that I know of, it's just annoying and worth a feature request.\nThe second issue which is more annoying is that the permissions level for either calendar is reverting back to read/write no matter how many times I ask it to use view only.\nI've attempted to change from iPhone/iMac and Web, and the same issue each time.\nI've removed sharing access full stop and then re-shared the calendars, no luck.\nI do have a shared calendar with someone else that has stayed in view only, but that was shared ages ago so I don't know what I might have done differently then.\nAny clues what to do to fix this?\n\nA: The only way I managed to change the permissions was via icloud.com.

About a week ago, we received a Facetime call from our own email address and it was a complete stranger.  Then a friend of ours got a Facetime call with from our email address and they missed the call, so they tried Facetiming back and they got this same stranger.  This person Facetimed me again, and I confronted him and hung up.  Then he messaged me on my iPhone.  How could this happen?  What happened?  Did he hack our account?  We have since changed our apple id password, but how could this have happened?  Is changing our password enough?  Would he still have access to our information?\n\nA: Apple ID Security:\nFirst, someone knowing your Apple ID password could have devastating results. This is because, if they know your Apple ID username and password and you have Find my iPhone enabled, they can remotely wipe your devices, and literally claim your device. Security of an Apple ID should be of utmost priority. They can also purchase content with your credit card (if you have one on file), and such.\nWith that in mind, Apple has done several things to increase security of Apple IDs. When you set up an Apple ID password, they have very good restrictions that encourage you to make a strong password. In addition they have 3 security questions. If you have done almost anything with your Apple ID in the past 6 months you were probably prompted to set up these questions. \"Do something with your Apple ID\" could be anything from purchasing content, to download apps, to logging into your Apple ID on a new device.\nAll that brings me to the point that unless someone knows you, or, has access to quite a bit of your personal information, it would be very difficult to hack an Apple ID as it is setup right now. I am in no way,  stating, or implying, that your Apple ID was not hacked. I am just saying that the process would be difficult.\nIn addition, you will receive an email confirmation when a new device is registered with Facetime. For example, when I purchased a new MacBook Pro recently, I signed into Facetime, then received an email to my Apple ID email address that stated that my new MacBook Pro was now registered with my Apple ID account(Facetime). To the best of my knowledge this happens any time a device is signed onto Facetime initially. If you haven't received such email, it would seem there is a possibility that your account wasn't hacked. Again, I am not saying either way, just a question mark about what happened.\nWhat may have happened:\nWithout you sharing more info, there are a couple things that could have happened:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your account was hacked.\n\n\n*\n\n*But why would someone Facetime the person whose account they hacked into? From what I've heard, hackers like to remain anonymous. Again, this doesn't mean it didn't happen, it just would just be odd.\n\n\n*Somehow, might it be possible that it, in some way wasn't your email address? Perhaps it is just a one letter different?\n\n\n*\n\n*While this may, at first glance, sound like a likely  option, it really doesn’t make much sense either. How would this stranger happen to get your email address (slight character or two different then his) and your friends? \n\n\n\nI guess that is to say I'm not really sure what could have happened. If he hacked your Apple ID and found your friend's info from that, then  he could have downloaded, via iCloud, all your contacts(or any other data stored in iCloud(Like a whole device backup)). This is truly a worst-case scenario, and could have very undesirable, and far-reaching affects.\nWhat you can do:\nLog on to appleid.apple.com and:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change your password.\n\n\n*\n\n*I know you have done this already (you could always do it again), and although it seems obvious it is a critical first-line of defense. Use reliable software to generate a long alpha numerical password. Maybe 14 characters long. Be sure to write it down on paper and secure it somewhere.\n\n\n*Consider changing your security questions. Did you know you can use anything (like passwords) instead of real answers for security questions?\nLastly, you could consider changing email addresses. Setup a new email address (like Gmail and enable two-step verification), and link it with your Apple ID when you manage your Apple ID. Also unlink, if you have already, and don't link, if you set up a new email address, your Apple ID email address with Facebook, Twitter or other social services. Consider setting up a separate account for the recovery email addresses for those services.\n\nA: Well, I guess changing the password would be enough. Just be more careful when it comes about passwords, 'cause it's kinda difficult for somebody to hack a password like that, unless you've told it to the person or this person knows the answer to your  secret question. \n", "Q: Purchased an entire season of a show, but newest episodes are requesting payment of $2.99 We purchased 'How I met your mother, Season 8' through iTunes.\nand this worked well for Episodes 1-14, however episodes 15 and 16 are not viewable, and are requesting to be purchased for $2.99/ea.  \nWhat's the best way to proceed?

I'm running a iOS 6.1 on a jailbroken iPhone 4S. I was one of the many to jailbreak my phone when evasi0n came out. As some of you may know, Apple has released iOS 6.1.1, an 'emergency' update for some battery and other issues experienced on the 4S.

You should strongly consider not using WPS anyway, as it has a number of documented security issues. Apple has a page which describes recommended router setup for connecting an iOS device, which might help.\n", "Q: Can not run ack after installing it using MacPorts After installing p5-app-ack using Macports I can see it is installed correctly.\n\nI can not run it however.\nI get ack: command not found.\nand which ack displays nothing.\nHow can I see where port installed my ack and how to add it to the executalble PATH?\n\nA: MacPorts, by default, installs into /opt/local/, judging by the screen shot ack should be in /opt/local/perl/p5-app-ack/ if you used the default install path. Make sure that path is in your $PATH environment variable.\nTo add it to your path edit your shell config file (probably ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc) and add or modify the following line.\nexport PATH=\"$PATH\":/opt/local/perl/p5-app-ack\nI don't use MacPorts for ack, I install it manually with the following command from the ack install page.\ncurl http://betterthangrep.com/ack-standalone > ~/bin/ack && chmod 0755 !#:3\nThis will install ack into the $HOME/bin/ folder as a single large perl file and I did not have to modify my $PATH variable.\n", "Q: Formatting OSX partition I have a Macbook Pro with 3 partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*HFS (OSX)\n\n*FAT (Ubuntu)\n\n*NTFS (Windows 7)\n\n\nand I want to format only the OSX partition and do a clean install without touching the other operating system partitions.\nIn order to do this I also have to format the MBR partition or erase it?

I sent my I.T. guy to investigate. He said the screen was black, and the machine was unresponsive to keyboard or mouse input. The harddisk was still running. The iMac was hot to the touch (as all iMacs are when they've been awake for an extended period).\nHe turned the machine off and turned it back on. Everything looked normal.

Note: If a kernel panic still occurs, go to the \"Hardware troubleshooting\" section of this article.\n  Open Disk Utility and use \"Repair Disk\" on Mac's internal hard drive (named Macintosh HD by default).\nImportant: If Disk Utility is unable to repair the internal drive, you should bring the Mac to a Genius at an Apple Store, or an Apple Authorized Service Provider for service and support. Be sure to ask that, if the drive needs reformatting or replacing, they contact you about escalating your case to a special data recovery service. If you plan to visit an Apple Retail store, make a reservation at the Genius Bar using http://www.apple.com/retail/geniusbar/ (available in some countries only).\nConnect an external drive with at least 10 GB of free space. Note: Make sure the external drive does not cause kernel panics and is the only device on its USB, FireWire, or Thunderbolt port. Connecting the external drive and its cables to another Mac can help make sure the drive does not cause kernel panics. \n  Install OS X on the external drive.\n  Start up from the external drive.\n  Install all software updates until Software Update reports your software is up to date.\n  Use the Apple applications on the external drive to surf the web, view QuickTime movies, email, print, scan, and/or other activities. Continue using the Mac for the amount of time it would usually take for the kernel panic to occur.\n  If a panic occurs, go to the \"Hardware troubleshooting\" section of this article to further diagnose the issue.\n  If a panic does not occur, go to the \"Software troubleshooting\" section of this article to further diagnose the issue.\n\n", "Q: Signed Mac Apps - error message Will the message \" is damaged and can't be opened.

Obviously, instead of moving stuff, you can just delete it:\n\nPlease try moving your Evernote database directory so that Evernote will regenerate a new local database by copying your notes back down from the service. To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your database is in a hidden directory. You can access it by opening the Finder, then selecting \"Go\" from the top menu and hitting the \"Option\" key. Once you have done that, you'll see the \"Library\" folder pop up.\n\n*Select it.\n\n*Then, go to:\n~/Library/Containers/com.evernote.Evernote/Data/Library/Application Support/Evernote/accounts/ and move the \"your username\" directory to another place.\n\n*Once you've done that, please also go to:\n~Library/Application Support/Evernote/accounts/Evernote/ and move the \"your username\" directory to another place.\nNote: You may not have a directory in both places. Please remove whichever ones you do have, and make sure that you no longer have either before moving forward.\n\n*Then, try opening Evernote again. All of your notes from the service will now synchronize and create a new local database.\n\n\n*If you do have any Local Only notebooks, right-click the notebook name in the left-hand notebook pane and select \"Export\", then export the notebook to .enex format, exporting tags if desired. If you have some unsynchronized notes, you can go to the Note List view, sort by the \"Sync\" column, and export any notes that have a * in that column to .enex format before following the above instructions.

TL;DR; Version:\nI'm looking for an app (preferably free) that will allow me to past an image from the clipboard and save it either to my photo library or to an online service.\nLong Version:\nSeveral months ago I had some photos stored in my Dropbox which accidentically got deleted without my knowing.  I recently realized the photos were gone and that I had no backups of the photos.  The other day I was in the Dropbox app on my iPad in an area which did not have Internet access.  I noticed that Dropbox had in its cache a bunch of the photos I had lost.  However, Dropbox will not allow me to import the photos into the photo libary or print them or share them; all of these actions return with the error \"Unable to Connect to Dropbox - There may be a problem with your iPad's Internet connection.\"  I can't enable the internet connection because that would sync my Dropbox and loose the photos.  The \"Copy Image to Clipboard\" action does work, however I can't find any app that will let me paste the image and save it.\nI have tried using Evernote, and I can paste the image, but the size limit for notes prevents me from syncing the note.  I've tried GMail and I can paste the image but when I send the message the received e-mail does not have the image attached or included in any way.\nIs there an app out there that will let me paste an image and either save it to the photo library or sync with an online service?\n\nA: Since you're able to copy the image, open up the Messages-app, open a new message to your own iMessage-address, and paste, then send. You should be able to save the image to the camera roll from there.\nOn newer iOS like 10 and higher, the ubiquitous share sheet function lets you move documents around so much easier, that third party apps aren't needed for this basic function anymore.\n\nA: If you can still open them in Dropbox, why not just take a screenshot of each? You may loose some resolution but at least you can save a version of the photo.\nDropbox most probably only cached a preview version of the picture anyway, that's why pasting etc. doesn't work (where the full version would be fetched).\n\nA: The newer version of Notes supports paste of photos. (I've done this in iOS 10 and later).\n\nA: Snapseed has a paste option and then save to photo library.\n", "Q: Save attachments from Mail.app based on subject I have been trying to write an Applescript to help me saving attachments, but realized quickly that I do not have the knowledge to do such a difficult script.

Fake can only connect an Element using one of two methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*HTML id attribute\n\n*XPath Expression\n\n\nIf you want to specify via one of the other methods you must do so \"by hand\".\nWhen you connect an Action to an HTML Element, Fake will first try to specify the connected Element using the HTML id attribute. If that is not possible (becuase the Element has no id attribute), Fake will try to specify the connected Element using XPath.\nVia id is the default because it is efficient and easily understandable.\nVia XPath is the fallback because it is always possible, but less efficent and less easliy understandable.\n\nHowever, there are times when you might prefer to connect an Action to an Element, but specify the Element via XPath instead of id. This is possible via the steps below:\n\n\n*\n\n*First add a connectable Action (like Set Value of HTML Element) to your Workflow.\n\n*Before connecting, change the specifier type to for XPath.\n\n*Then connect as normal. Hold the control key (⌃) while dragging from the Action to an Element on the page.\n\n\nThe Element will now be specified via XPath, instead of id.\n\n\n", "Q: Can I keep my iPhone screen off during voice navigation with Apple's Maps app?

How can I debug this?\n\nA: Here is what I would do to troubleshoot it (with the help of an external mouse):\nGo to System Preferences, then select Trackpad, and make some change on that screen.  Try your trackpad again.  \nIf that doesn't work, reboot.\nIf that doesn't work, and if you're using BootCamp (or VMware Fusion, or Parallels), try booting into the other operating system that you have installed on your Mac and see if your trackpad is recognized there.\nIf that doesn't work, try cleaning off your trackpad.  Give it a good vacuuming, get any dust out from around the edges.\nIf that doesn't work, then (if you're comfortable) it's time to dig into the innards of your Macbook.  One option is that your battery could be impacting this.  If your battery life on your Macbook has also gone down, the battery itself could be physically bulging out, and it could move your trackpad enough out of alignment that it won't work any longer.  If that's the case, then you need a new battery.  \nIf your battery is fine, then it could be that you need a new trackpad.  I bought a replacement trackpad from eBay for my old Macbook, and that got me an extra year's worth of life out of that Macbook.  It was a bit fiddly to replace, but it worked.\n\nA: I noticed apple did make some changes to the software for trackpads that were not all that great for those of us who don't have the latest model. You could try to see if you can roll back the software for the trackpad and see if that helps. I am not sure how to do it with apple macs but I am sure there will be a way to do it.\nIf you are comfortable with Nadyne's suggestion to open your mac up then I would give it a wipe when inside before paying out for a new battery. It could have got dirty or sticky over time and there are lots of how-to videos on this on youtube so you know how to do it without damaging anything. Mind not to lose the screws because it is daylight robbery to replace them. \nIt is quite easy to wipe the trackpad without damaging it but watch out if you have insurance because I felt that apple had put little 'traps' up so their technicians know that you opened your mac if you take it for a repair even if you didn't do anything to it and the repair is not connected with your meddling.\n\nA: I just repaired my MacBook Pro (the cursor would move erratically, or not at all, to touchpad input.) I removed the back of the computer, removed the battery, removed the touchpad and cleaned the edges of it, and the edges of the opening it came out of, with a toothbrush sprayed with WD-40. The small gap between the touchpad and computer body collects crud (oils,food,dust.) When this happens it interferes with the small conductive contacts on the touch pad (between the touchpad and the computer body.) All you need is a 00-size Philips head screwdriver, a tri-wing screw driver(looks like a Philips head but with three blades instead of 4,) commonly used on Nintendo games, a toothbrush, paper towels, and a can of WD-40. \n", "Q: iphone 4S 6.0.1 has poor wifi reception upstairs I've had an iphone 4S running 6.0.1 for just about a month. I find that it has trouble connecting to wifi when I'm in my room upstairs.  It connects fine downstairs (which is where the combo. router/modem resides.) I tried a Macbook to test the connection in my room and it had a very strong wifi connection.\nWhat can I do?  The wifi seems to work well in other situations, including at work, which is in a hospital, so I'm sure I'm not near a modem/router.\n\nA: WiFi networks require two-way communication.  Even though your router may have enough strength to send a signal to that room, whatever wireless client device you want to use in that room also has to have enough strength to send a signal back to the router.\nEvidently, the Macbook you tested in the room had enough strength to send a decent signal back to the router.  Yet, the iPhone did not.  Signal effectiveness is a combination of a number of variables, two being antenna configuration, and power.  Your iPhone's WiFi antenna and/or power are inferior to the computer's.\nWhat you could do is either move the wireless router closer to (or into) the room, or else set up another access point to extend your network's wireless reach.\nTo get a new access point talking to your existing network's router, you'll need to consider using wireless-to-wireless repeating, power line network adapters, or an Ethernet cable – Ethernet being the best option, if you can somehow run a cable from point A to point B.\n", "Q: In iTunes Store, how can you view the full name? When I'm looking in the store (iTunes U, specifically), many of the titles are cut off, ending in \"...\"  I thought the standard \"hold the cursor over the text\" would show a little window with the whole name, but no.  The only workaround I found was making the iTunes window wider.  Any way to make the column wider, or otherwise show the whole name?  (There's no way to change the column width by dragging at the top, like you would in your iTunes library).\n\nA: If you press the small 'i' button to the right of the description column, the information is shown again, in a pop-over box.  This does seem to show the full name.\n\n", "Q: Need offline iOS GPS app for Southeast Asia Looking for recommendations for a good offline GPS tracker for SE Asia (Singapore, Cambodia, and Thailand, specifically). I was looking at Gaia GPS, but I can't quite tell from their site if they support anything outside of the US and Canada. \nThe idea is that I want to have GPS tracks of my wanderings so I can later sync them up with the photos I take (it'll make it a lot easier to figure out what I'm looking at in my pictures when I go to work with them months after I get back). I'll be in areas with terrible cell reception, so ability to track solely on GPS is a must - otherwise I'd just be using RunKeeper. \nI'm planning to take my 3GS just because it'll be easier to get a SIM card, so whatever it is has to support the 3GS. This should be mostly fine since the 3GS runs iOS 6, but figured it was worth a mention. \nThoughts?\n\nA: Gaia GPS has many map sources that cover SE Asia. I am one of the developers, and you can email support@gaiagps.com if you have any questions.\n", "Q: Do I need anything from Apple on my pc if I have a hp running Windows? Do I need anything from Apple on my computer if I am running Windows on a HP?\n\nA: You don't really need anything from Apple, but they have got some good software you can use on Windows. You could download their browser Safari. It's not as good as Chrome in my opinion, and it is not updated anymore, but you might like it.\nIf you have an AirPort Express/Extreme- or a Time Capsule-based network, you will need the application AirPort Utility to configure it.\nI do recommend you install iTunes, Apple's music application. It's pretty good for playing music, and if you have an iPhone or iPad, you can synchronize and back it up with your computer using iTunes.\nIf you're using iCloud, you might want to download the iCloud Control Panel, allowing you to sync your bookmarks (with Safari) and your Photo Stream, in addition to contacts, calendars, tasks and mail with Outlook (requiring that you have Outlook on your pc).\nThose are all the applications I can think of that you can have any use of (except maybe QuickTime).\nHarware-wise, you have a lot of options. You could get a WiFi-router, such as AirPort Extreme/Express or Time Capsule, or EarPods (for music), and so on. Take a look at the online Apple Store for a full overview.\n", "Q: How can you reset security questions on an Apple ID when you have the password, but the security email is incorrect? There's a bit of a story, but the nub of the issue is we have forgotten the answers to the security questions on an Apple ID used for purchasing apps and music and can't reset the answers / questions due the security email address pointing to an account we don't control.\n\nHere's the rest of the story...\nBeing the good son I am, I bought my mother an iPhone4s for her birthday. \nNow, don't get me wrong - my mother is fairly tech savvy considering her age. She runs her company's website, manages a Facebook community, and shares pictures of her grandsons via Gmail. But Apple Accounts is what stumped her.\nShe registered and signed up her Apple account using her iPhone, all nice and well. When she came to making her first purchase on the AppStore, she was asked the security questions. The questions were phrased in Hebrew, and for the life of her she couldn't remember the answers. To make matters worse, she did not know whether she answered them in Hebrew or English. \nThis is where I stepped in. After trying out dozens of combinations, I resorted to resetting her security questions via her account page. But alas, the security email points an email account with a typo, rather than her main defined email account.\nStill I did not lose hope, and sent an email to Apple support, which instructed me to contact their security team via the phone number in this page. The phone number provided for Israel does not work (I think it's disconnected or out of service).\nI tried contacting Apple Support in the US, but they claim that the device, as identified by its serial number is not covered by Apple support. Great.\nWhat can I do at this point? I'm at a loss.\nI really don't want her to  open a different account. How can I help her salvage this one so she can answer the three security questions when they are asked for adding new devices or adding a credit card to the account?\n\nA: Focus on iTunes billing support. When you need support on a device and the software support window is over, you pay for that help.\niTunes billing support is generally free since you can't spend more money in the store without a working account. You always have to get a support person to call you since people that have access to the store accounts are a very limited subset of all the support personnel.\nJust be persistent - keep good notes, provide a phone number where they can reach you and have all the details of the account you can muster ready. Things like purchase history, credit card bills so you can tell the person the last two or three purchases made from that account in terms of date, transaction number and amount.\nOnce you've gotten the password reset, you can go back and fix all the security questions at https://appleid.apple.com\nWorst case, you can add a new email address to the account, verify it, and then see if you can send a security question reset after that email is verified by Apple and in use for a week or so. Also - make more purchases from that account (free apps are fine) to show that the device that was registered to that account is still in use and still associated with the account even though the email address on file is new.\n\n", "Q: Lost pictures in iPhoto I lost all of my pictures from my iPhoto after updating it to the newest version. How do I find them?\n\nA: Have you pointed iPhoto to your old library (In iPhoto: File>Switch to Library)?\nI also recall that it said: \"The photo library needs to be upgraded to work with this version of iPhoto.\" when I updated. Did yours do this? I notice also that there is a quit option, did you just click through thinking it was junk?\n\n\nA: All you have to do to get the photos back is hold down option and command keys while opening iPhoto and then click on rebuild database. They are all there... YAY\n", "Q: Background changed on Mountain Lion I have a Mac running Mountain Lion 10.8.2 - previously it was Snow Leopard.\nIn the past few days I've noticed this happened:\n\nThe galaxy background disappeared, and blue background replaced it. I can't recover either of them, resetting PRAM didn't help.\nAlso, in Firefox and Chrome, Adobe Flash Player is sluggish for sites like YouTube etc. but not Google Maps.\nI also can't change user picture either - just an icon with a man's head grayed out appears.\nI don't have any Time Machine backups, so what should I do that can keep my existing programs intact and fix this problem? (I've tried the advice I found online of boot into safe mode, or reset PRAM/NVRAM but so far nothing's worked). Would changing the MTU from 1500 fix anything?\nAll help is much appreciated, thanks!\n\nA: If you don't have any Time Machine backups, now would be a good time to make one.\nThe Desktop Preference in your screen grab is displaying the contents of Macintosh HD -> Library -> Desktop Pictures which appears to be empty.  If it really is empty, you may be able to locate, replace, or download the missing files and that could be a simple fix.  But if there are other issues and it seems that Mac OS X has been damaged, I would think about using Recovery HD to reinstall the OS.  User pictures are located in the /Library/User Pictures folder.  Since Disk Utility has verified and repaired permissions on Macintosh HD, I guess those files are missing too.\nStep one: make a Time Machine archive of your Mac Mini on an external drive. Once you are sure it is properly backed up, you could try entering this in Terminal to search the Library folder for the Mountain Lion default Desktop picture:\nsudo find /Library -name \"Galaxy.jpg\"\n\nOr search the entire disk like this (it will take quite some time):\nsudo find / -name \"Galaxy.jpg\"\n\nAnd just for good measure, run a bit of system maintenance:\nsudo periodic daily weekly monthly\n\nIf you are still in the same predicament and decide to re-install Mac OS X, reboot holding down the Command and R keys until you see the Apple logo appear.  You should see a list of utilities including Disk Utility (try it one more time) and \"Install Mac OS X\"  which is a 4GB download, so a good network connection is going to help. After a clean install, you can use Migration Assistant to import Users from the Time Machine archive you made earlier.  Applications are best re-installed from the App Store, original media, or a source you can trust.\n", "Q: What are the “~orig” files in OS X? In the /etc folder of my system (OS X 10.8.2) I see a bunch of files named with the \"~orig\" suffix (e.g hosts~orig, passwd~orig, etc). What are these?\n\nA: Those are the leftovers of OS upgrade.\nThe OS X upgrade saves previous configurations that's going to be changed.\nThe date of ~orig file should correspond with the OS upgrade.\n", "Q: How do I export mail.app rules to other filtering solutions such as procmail? In the past I handled email filtering using Mail.app's Rules. I want to move my filters out of Mail.app and into another solution, such as a centrally-organized IMAP + procmail setup.\nIs it possible to export apple mail.app rules for use with procmail?\nIf not for procmail per se, how about exporting to other formats that might be an easier intermediary between Mail.app and procmail?\n\nA: You can find them in plist format (just an xml flavor) in:\n~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/MessageRules.plist\n\nYou can write a script in the language of your choice to parse this file and produce rules suitable to procmail.\nHere is a python draft:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport plistlib\n\npl = plistlib.readPlist('/Users/<user>/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/SyncedRules.plist')\n\nfor rule in pl:\n    print\n    print ':0:'\n    mbox = ''\n    for key in rule:\n        if key == 'Criteria':\n            for c in rule[key]:\n                print '^%s:.*%s' % (c['Header'], c['Expression'])\n        if key == 'CopyToMailbox':\n            mbox = rule[key]\n    print mbox\n\n", "Q: Running Chromium OS from bootable USB on MacBook? I wanted to try the Chromium OS builds from http://chromeos.hexxeh.net/, but failed to create a bootable USB drive.\nI followed the steps on the site:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the Mac builder\n\n*Download the vanilla .iso\n\n*Run the builder (and tell it to use the .iso)\n\n\nBut when I tried to reboot and hold down the option key, the USB drive didn't show up.\nWhen I rebooted back into OS X, it complained that the USB drive wasn't recognized. In disk utility it showed several partitions.\nHas anyone had experience with Chrome OS on a MacBook?\n\nA: From my experience you are best downloading VirtualBox and launching it as a full-screen virtual appliance. Apple's EFI doesn't like to load USB drives that aren't OS X or Windows 7 installers. I have run into this same issue trying to run Ubuntu and Haiku from USB. If you have an optical drive you are better off burning the ISO to DVD and booting that way. You could also checkout rEFIt at your own risk as an alternate boot loader. \nBy the way it is normal for OS X to not recognize the format of the USB you created. That is because it is probably not in HFS+, NTFS or FAT. Not that it makes it any easier to boot. \n", "Q: What is installed with Java 7? Inspired by this question on Stackoverflow, I noticed that my Java control panel reports that I have the latest version of Java installed (and I know that, because Safari is not blocking the plugin any longer), while the command line version seems to be different.\nFrom Terminal:\n$ java -version\njava version \"1.7.0_06-ea\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_06-ea-b20)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.2-b09, mixed mode)\n\nJava 1.7.0_06 is not the latest version, as far as I know.\nHence my question:\nIf I install Java 1.7 from Oracle's web site and then rely on the \"automatic\" updating that it provides, will the command line version be stuck with the old version? A bit confused here.\n\nA: The Java Control panel in System Preferences refers to the Java Applet Plugin (JRE) that is made available to Safari and other browsers.\nIf you use the Help>Installed Plugins you should see a version signature if it is enabled The latest JRE reports\napplication/x-java-applet;jpi-version=1.7.0_13  \n\nThe java you are looking at with java -version is the one installed with the full JDK. You  need to download the installer for that separately now from Oracle\nWhen installed java -version should report\njava version \"1.7.0_13\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_13-b20)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.7-b01, mixed mode)\n\n", "Q: What kind of encryption does Mac OS X Extended (Journaled, Encrptyed) use? Since my primary hard disk is encrypted with FileVault2, I also wanted my backup drive to be encrypted. I plugged in my external drive, brought up Disk Utility, and went to erase/format the disk. I chose Mac OS X Extended (Journaled, Encrptyed). However, I couldn't find out what kind of encryption it uses. Does anyone know (and/or know how I would look this info up via a command or system utility)? Is it the same as FileVault2?\n\nA: Yes - it's the same whole disk encryption. In both instances you end up with a volume wrapper and key storage to unlocks the encrypted file system where the data is safely stored. Disk Utility is a bit of a chore to set up encryption of an external drive, so I usually just wipe the drive and set it for Backups and then tell Time Machine to encrypt the drive. It handles the formatting, generating the crypto keys and lets you choose a passphrase to unlock the keys.\nYou can use diskutil cs list from the command line (in terminal.app) to show the encryption status and details. There's nothing wrong with disk utility other than the steps involved to reach an equivalent drive setup. \nHere is what a fully encrypted and locked USB drive looks like when you set up Time Machine and instruct it to encrypt backups to an external drive:\nAir:~ bmike$ diskutil cs list\nCoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found)\n|\n+-- Logical Volume Group 6FD6879D-EFBF-4F33-9FC2-13E32A0F7B28\n    =========================================================\n    Name:         Backups\n    Status:       Online\n    Size:         499730309120 B (499.7 GB)\n    Free Space:   0 B (0 B)\n    |\n    +-< Physical Volume 3082BFED-D84E-48FA-AB4F-7FB0197FD653\n    |   ----------------------------------------------------\n    |   Index:    0\n    |   Disk:     disk1s2\n    |   Status:   Online\n    |   Size:     499730309120 B (499.7 GB)\n    |\n    +-> Logical Volume Family DFD4DEB4-93A8-4DD5-8F73-6534AB408E4D\n        ----------------------------------------------------------\n        Encryption Status:       Locked\n        Encryption Type:         AES-XTS\n        Conversion Status:       Complete\n        Conversion Direction:    -none-\n        Has Encrypted Extents:   Yes\n        Fully Secure:            Yes\n        Passphrase Required:     Yes\n        |\n        +-> Logical Volume E9497C5B-4AAD-46E5-ACEE-4214D1CA11D8\n            ---------------------------------------------------\n            Disk:               -none-\n            Status:             Locked\n            Size (Total):       499411537920 B (499.4 GB)\n            Size (Converted):   -none-\n            Revertible:         Yes (unlock and decryption required)\n            LV Name:            Backups\n            Content Hint:       Apple_HFS\n\n", "Q: iMessage entries appearing in wrong order When using iMessage my entries are not being shown in the order in which they are sent and received.

That fact that your are not just occasionally wrong but seemingly always wrong suggests that you or the receiving end has a problem with their date and time settings.\nIf one of your phones is out by just a few minutes, I would expect this problem only to crop up if you are replying to each other quite quickly.  If many messages can go by before switching from sender to receiver, then there could be a wider gap.\nCheck out Settings > General > Date & Time and check if you or the other phone have manually set a date or time that could be different from each other.  If you both use Set Automatically it should prevent these problems. Check your timezone also.\n\nA: Many users use this technology to get their iMessages back to normal, so I want to share them with you.\nFirst, open Settings, then click General -> Date & Time. Then, turn off the switch next to the auto setup - when the switch is on the left, you will know that it is off.\nNow open the application switcher and close the messaging application.

Then, hold down the preview of the messaging app until the red minus button appears in the top left corner of the app preview. Finally, click the red minus button to close the messaging application.\nNow reopen the messaging app on the iPhone - your iMessages should be in the correct order! Now you can go back to Settings -> General -> Date & Time and reopen the automatic settings.\nIf this method fails, don't worry, there are other ways.\n\nA: Having seen this happen just recently, Stuffe's answer would appear to be the correct explanation of the symptom...\nThe fix was simply to restart the affected device.  \nThat was presumably sufficient to make it check NNTP for the correct time again.\n", "Q: Configuring predictable IPv6 addresses for laptop client I recently set up IPv6 for my home network via a tunnel. I have a /48 subnet and have assigned manual IPv6 addresses to my stationary Macs. I would like to set up my laptops to get a dynamic IPv6 address which is same every time I get onto my home network (wired or wireless). The aim would be to be able to connect to these machines via IPv6 from the outside.\nAs far as I understand OS X has no DHCPv6 client and therefore the IPv6 IP address allocation is done via router advertisement. Is this IP address allocated randomly (within the range of available addresses) or is there some predictability? AFAIK, the MAC address of the ethernet adapter is used as part of the IP address (unless some privacy flag is set). In a way I am trying to set up the equivalent of IPv4 DHCP with fixed IP addresses for IPv6. How would this be possible?\n\nA: Just a small correction, but OSX (at least Mountain Lion) has full DHCPv6 client, which works out of the box to communicate with a DHCPv6 server on your network.  The case may be, that Apple Airport does not have a DHCPv6 server and therefore your choice of IPv6 assignment is limited to auto-configuration (SLAAC) and link-local schemes (the ones controlled by privacy setting).\nThe SLAAC address, as you correctly worked out, uses the last three octets of the L2 MAC address.  The other address is the link-local address of the interface.\nIf you wanted to use a DHCPv6 assignment, then you would run a small inexpensive DHCPv6 server on your network and end up with a third IPv6 address from your chosen DHCP scope, configured on your interfaces (depending on privacy setting).\nIf you combine this DHCPv6 server with your own DNS server, and configure delegation, you could just use DNS names rather than relying on IPs.\nReference:\nhttp://blog.ipspace.net/2012/11/ipv6-router-advertisements-deep-dive.html\nhttp://blog.belodedenko.me/2013/06/a-practical-guide-to-setting-up-ipv6.html\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-local_address#IPv6\n\nA: I got a few things confused here: While I do have a /48 net, typically one would use a single /64 net to configure things. In fact my Apple Airport, that is used as the endpoint used the first available /64. The airport will then help with autoconfiguration by advertising the network part (the first 64 bits)\nNext, all machines connecting using autoconfiguration will select, based on the router advertisement of the router (in this case the Apple Airport) at least one address based on the (Ethernet) MAC address used. In fact, if you have the privacy extensions turn on (this is off by default on Macs, but on an e.g., Linux machines) you will have several Global scope addresses.\nTo find the correct one based on the mac address, look for the address which has a ff:fe as part of the 3rd and 2nd last tuple of the 8 tuple address.\nThat is the address which you can use to configure incoming connections. E.g. ssh. The other temporary addressed will be used by outgoing connections (e.g. your web browser) to make tracking based on IP more difficult.\n", "Q: How to determine the absolute path to a file in a shell script I am writing a generic script that can get passed both absolute and relative (to the current working dir) paths to existing files.\nI need a fail-safe way to turn all those passed paths into absolute paths because I need to pass the paths to the \"open\" command, which in won't pass the current directory to the launched app.\nOne idea I had is to check if the path starts with a \"/\", and if not, then I'd prepend the current working dir's path to it.\nHowever, I wonder if there's a smarter solution to this. Also, as I'm quite inexperienced with shell scripting and related tools, I don't even know how to test for a variable's value to start with \"/\". I'm looking for a portable solution to run on multiple Mac, so installing extra tools or configuration would be less than ideal.\nCan someone suggest a standard script using only shipping tools that takes a variable (let's call it $path) and turns it into a absolute path if it's not already absolute?\n\nA: One option would be to install coreutils and use greadlink -f.

The usual reason for this is that it's an OS version that doesn't support that model (Mountain Lion supports MBP's starting with the Mid/Late 2007 models (see the specs).

It works nicely  when I reboot without the display plugged in.\nOf course I've installed the newest Bootcamp drivers!\nIs this a known problem?\nAny suggestions?\n(If it helps, I'm also having trouble getting my wireless trackpad and wireless keyboard to work at all with windows 7, might be related..)\n(un)fortunately I don't know jack about windows anymore because I didn't use it seriously for at least 10 years.\n\nA: I have this exact same problem but in MacOS X Mountain Lion.  The minute I unplug the thunderbolt/minidisplayport, the wifi starts working again.\nI found a weird solution on the internet from another Macbook Air owner witht eh same problem as us: access your router and change the channel to 1, or 2, or any other number that works.  For some reason, plugging in the cable disrupts the wifi signal entering the Macbook.\nThis seems to be a common problem and this seems to be the only solution that works, as many users have tried with different cables and different OS.  Hopefully Apple will provide a firmware update to fix this for good as not always can we access the router (like at my work).  However, as of today (I updated my OS to 10.8.4), this problem has not been fixed properly.\nGood luck!!\n\nA: I've had the same issue and found a quick and dirty solution.\nBoot into Windows with the Thunderbolt Display connected and visit the device manager and delete the drivers with the warning sign. \nIn my case, windows immediately installed the drivers automatically and it worked right away.\n\nA: Apple say that certain monitors will interfere with wifi, as stated here. That wouldn't explain why it seems to only affect apple products! But does explain why lowering the wifi channel to 1 might help (it says to avoid 11-14). It also suggests moving to 5GHz instead of 2.5GHz may alleviate the problem. \nSomebody else suggests that if you use a genuine apple Thunderbolt adapter/display then it'll be OK too.\n", "Q: A popover shown from the Spotlight menu is stuck on the screen How do I get rid of it?

On iPhone and iPads ,  I mostly edit my photographs on using an app called “Photo Splash FX”. Its easy to use interface, plethora of editing options and stability made it my favorite app. \n\nA: It sounds like your issue is a compounded one, in that you want a photo manager that has an editing solution that works between your iPad and your PC (assume Windows).\nThe easiest solution that I can think of is to seriously consider switching to a Mac instead of a PC, because what you are looking for is solved with an App called iPhoto. It comes with every new Mac and can be purchased on the App Store for iOS devices for $4.99.\niPhoto manages your photo library by doing all of the cataloguing and archiving for you within a very intuitive user interface. You can sync your photos between your Mac and iOS devices by direct connection or through iCloud. It also comes with some very decent editing tools like removing red-eye, cropping, basic filters, brightness/contrast, exposure, and more.\nIf you want something more robust than iPhoto, then you can move up to Aperture on your Mac, which conveniently also uses your iPhoto library.\nThat said, if you insist on working with the PC, you may want to look at iPhoto for your iPad, and syncing your iPhoto library on your iPad through iTunes on your PC, but you will still have to do a lot of manual file management with your photo folders. It's just not as \"elegant\" a solution, but it can work with some effort.\n", "Q: When running a command from terminal, how can I know the full path of the command?

Currently I have an older version of 'ctags' which is located in /usr/bin/ctags/.\nI want the new version to be the default when executing ctags via the Terminal.\nHow can that be achieved?\n\nA: The safest way is to make sure /usr/local/bin comes before /usr/bin in your $PATH variable.\n", "Q: Is there an option of liquid cooling/heatsink replacement for mid 2011 Mac Mini? I'd like a quieter/more efficient cooling system but I don't know if there's anything out there for a Mac Mini.\nAny hardware options?\n\nA: I will say no.\nI haven't seen anything on the market yet. But since Mac mini is aluminum, you can just cool its casing. But that of course wouldn't be efficient.\nThe reason no one made one is the same reason no one made a water-cooling for laptop. The design of Mac desktops are more like laptops rather than a Tower PC.

(i.e. add annotation, accept\nannotation). It completely breaks the reading experience.\nI don't even care if that kind of a step-based work-flow is better if you want to edit/delete the annotations. I would be happy even if deletion/edition was not allowed, a good old cross-out would be enough for me.\n\n*The writing experience should be snappy and responsive. I don't want lines to follow my stylus-tip as I write, like laggy comets in orbit. A good example of good behaviour in this regard is Wacom's Bamboo Write App\nOptionally it would be simply awesome if it was had handwritting calculator capabilities like MyScript Calculator. I am used to make calculations in the margins, when reading engineering or math-related books.\nI have tried Goodreader and iAnnotate but neither of them comply with (1) or (2). Any suggestions?\n\nA: I found it! Good notes does exactly (1) and (2) \nYou can write without accessing menus and browse the document at the same time by using two-finger gestures (to distinguish them from the writing itself). And writing is really snappy.\nIt also happens to have a great feedback system, so I added a suggestion to add a handwritting calculator.\nThe only missing features (for my taste) are margin cropping and automatic Dropbox synching.\n\nA: You can do this with Adobe Reader by Adobe There is a version for Andriod too, and it is free as well.\n\nA: I use my iPad all the time at work and during meeting, it's important to import, make annotation and share my files with people.

I want to create videos of myself doing app demos on my iPod, how do I create a video version of screen shot?\n\nA: You could try Reflector (reflector.com) which is an app that runs on your Mac and grabs sound & video from your ios device over airplay. There's also AirServer but I found that wasn't nearly as responsive and it didn't have video recording ability. Reflector was called Reflection until recently.\n", "Q: Does the permissions popup for Push Notification in iOS refer to both local and remote (APNs) notifications? I have been racking my brain trying to understand how Push Notifications and Local Notifications are handled by iOS devices. I have come to understand that Push Notifications refer to those notifications that come from a server through the Apple Push Notification service (APNs) while Local Notifications are scheduled on a device by a delivery time and date without any connection to a server. However, on the user end all notifications appear the same and are seemingly managed as the same whether in Settings>Notifications or within an in-app settings page.\nMy one question however is with the common Push Notifications request alert that is often displayed when an app is first launched (image linked below). Here, Apple uses the language of \"Push Notification\" which would seem to deal with turning on or off APNs notifications. The problem I think is that the distinction would not be clear to users who do not encounter that difference anywhere else while managing notifications.\nDoes this alert only deal with remote Push Notifications (APNs) or does it also turn on or off local notifications?\n\n\nA: Yes, preferences under Settings / Notifications work too for Local notifications. \nApple's Documentation states that: \n\n[The user] can also selectively enable or disable push notification types (that is, icon badging, alert messages, and sounds) for specific applications. \n\nWhich is not exactly clarifying, but, I've just tested it with a small App which only has Local Notifications and, disabling all possibilities do disable Notifications. \nBear in mind too, that an App which only has Local Notifications will be shown too among the Notification's Settings, which makes no sense if those settings won't affect that App. \n", "Q: Browser (Safari, Chrome, Firefox) routes to incorrect server for domain I purchased a new domain for my website at Hover.com. I pointed the name servers to my host provider. Everything works smoothly when I access the site on my iPhone, iPad, on my roommate's laptop, or any other machine.\nBut on my MacBook Pro running Mountain Lion, when I try to load my website at the new domain, I'm directed to a Hover.com landing page. The old domain (which I still have pointed to the same place) works fine, but the new one does not, and it's only on my machine that I have this problem. Changing browsers does not help. I tried clearing the DNS cache like so\nsudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\n\nbut that does not fix the problem. Any ideas? My new domain name is andrewphilipclark.com.\n\nA: The problem resolved itself... somehow. I guess somewhere between my MacBook and my server there was a DNS cache that needed to be cleared.

The service calls the workflow with each of the selected file names.\nHere's what the service does:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run Shell Script with Pass input to stdin and the script grep -o '[^/]*$'  --  the service receives the full paths of the files selected in the finder, I only want the file names, so this removes the path bit.\n\n*Launch Application with firefox  -- this seems to be the best way to switch applications (even if they're already open..)\n\n*Run Workflow - in batches of 1 at a time using 1 workflow, with \"wait for workflow to finish\" ticked.\n\n\nThe in batches mode appears to process text input line by line. Each line output by grep contains a file name, so the second workflow is called once with each file name. Note that the list of file names is passed through Launch Application.\nHere's what the workflow does:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy to Clipboard\n\n*a recorded Watch Me Do:\n\n*\n\n*a series of clicks to get the 'upload file' dialog up\n\n*a click to focus it's search box,\\\n\n*paste (the file name)\n\n*select the top found file\n\n*click 'open'\n\n*a series of clicks to upload the file and return the page to the same state in which we started\n\n\n\nThere were a few hiccups along the way. \n\n\n*\n\n*First I used command-V to paste, but for some reason that was unreliable, so I ended up using paste from the edit menu instead.\n\n*I had to be careful to leave enough time between clicks for worst-case rendering of html pages and opening dialogs etc.. \n\n*When the flow crashed (usually by getting out of sync with the browser), I often ended up with the browser stuck with the 'upload file' dialog open and unresponsive.

It turns out that the phone erroneously thinks that a headset is plugged in. I noticed because the volume control popup shows \"headset.\" \nWhen I actually plug my headset in, everything works as expected. But unplugging the headset doesn't register on the phone; it stays in headset mode.\nIt seems that there's a small hardware switch that notices the plug, and this switch has failed.\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I somehow clean the switch? Perhaps it's not broken, just dirty.\n\n*Can I take the phone apart myself (warranty is long gone), or should I have it repaired? \n\n*\n\n*Looking at iFixit, it seems I would have to completely dismantle the phone to get to the jack (direct link). I'm not sure that's feasible for the layman, with any hope of it working again afterwards?\n\n\n\nI realize that the phone's value is less than any repair would cost, so it's a matter of whether I can fix this myself, or need to spend €€€ on a replacement phone.\n\nA: In most current audio ports on Apple products, the audio jack contains a small switch which senses when a jack has been inserted.  It is likely your phone's switch has some debris that has disconnected the circuit, something that I've observed on multiple occasions with multiple users devices.  I myself am constantly getting pocket lint in the various ports of my phone.  Someday it will probably result in the same issue you're having.\nYou need to somehow get the sensor working again, or work around it.  Try using canned air (from your local electronics or office supply store) to blow out the port.\nSince the audio jack is soldered to the phone's motherboard, if this is a deal-breaker for you, you might have to replace it.\n", "Q: Why is my iOS not detecting Bluetooth device names? I am trying to list of bluetooth devices from my app. \nMy Bluetooth is enabled in settings but doesn't detect device names.\n\n\n\nA: The BT device that you are looking for has to be in discovery mode, or set to always discoverable in order to be visible to such device searches.\n\nA: you can use apps like lightBlue or BLE scanner\n", "Q: hdiutil convert/rsize resource temporarily unavailable When trying to convert or resize a dmg image I get the error:\nhdiutil: convert failed Resource Temporarily Unavailable error\n\nor\nhdiutil: resize: failed. Resource temporarily unavailable (35).\n\n(hdiutil error code 35).\n\nA: The problem appears to happen when you unmount the image using umount. \nRemount the image (either using hdiutil attach or just double click the image) and use the command hdiutil detach it again. This will unmount and eject the image. \nhdiutil detach /Volumes/<your image>\n\n\nA: In my case something was trying to access the image. What finally worked:\nsudo lsof | grep ~/Unix.sparsebundle/\nsudo kill -9 889\nhdiutil resize -size 100g ~/Unix.sparsebundle/\n\n\nA: Another possibility is that the disk image is still mounted (from previous work on it). In this case, just select the eject icon.\nAfterwards, the hdiutil convert worked great. \n\nA: If you are accessing a disk image over a network then it's possible to have various operations interrupted if you encounter any kind of network issue, which can result in the image becoming \"temporarily unavailable\" when you try to resume whatever you were doing.\nThis happens because only a single system can have a disk image mounted at once, otherwise corruption could/will occur, but the locking mechanism for preventing double-access can end up being left in an inconsistent state, so even if you only have a single system accessing an image, you can end up with this error, as hdiutil thinks the image is already open on another system.\nAs others have pointed out, a restart can resolve this; I'm not actually sure why, as I'm not clear on how hdiutil/macOS marks an image as in-use. For a sparse bundle this has something to do with the token file, and there's a handy workaround if you don't want to have to restart.\nNOTE: You must be absolutely certain that yours is the only system accessing this disk image, fiddling with the token file while an image is already mounted could destroy your image completely! Always have backups wherever possible, and be very careful at all times.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal.app\n\n*If your image is on a remote share, connect to it now\n\n*Navigate into the sparse bundle in the Terminal (type cd (with trailing space) then drag your sparse bundle file onto the Terminal window, hit enter)\n\n*Rename the old token (mv token{,.old})\n\n*Create a new copy of the token (cp token{.old,})\n\n*If necessary, correct the permissions on the new token (chown 'user:group' token, with the correct user/group, it should match the user:group of the Info.plist file in the same folder.\n\n\nAfter copying the token in this way, you should now be able to use hdiutil attach /path/to/image as normal to attach and mount the image.\nNOTE: Be very careful using this method; I move the original out of the way rather than discarding it, so that it is always possible to recover it if anything goes wrong.\n\nA: Sometimes you can't explain whats going on.

Wanting to use secondary display? The display on my MacBook Pro has recently died so I have been using the hdmi adapter to display the screen on my lg tv, which has been fine for a few day apart from the resolution not being ideal. Trying to fix this I un-ticked the Mirror Display option, making my tv a secondary display. Now I have no way of changing this back as all the options are on the primary display on my MacBook which has a dead screen!   \nIs there any way to restore it back to the mirrored image. Or a way of using the secondary display as a primary? I'm really stuck here and would appreciate any help.\n\nA: The easiest way would be to set the screens to be mirrored again. There is a simple shortcut for this: Cmd+F1 (or Fn+Cmd+F1).\nFrom there, you can open System Prefrences, go to the Arrangement-tab and un-mirror them if you need to, and set the external screen to be the main on (by dragging the white top-strip of the \"screen\" to the other screen).\nAnother, maybe better approach, is to use the keyboard shortcut Option⌥+F2, which will directly open System Prefrences to the Displays-board, which will show up on both screens with the option to Gather Windows.\n\nA: Plug in an external keyboard and mouse, display adapter, and power. Close the lid, wake the system with the external keyboard. The system will wake and drive only the external monitor.\nMight not hurt to put display settings in your menubar, using the checkbox found on the Displays screen of system prefs.\nEdits: New non-shortcut solution, saves desk real estate as well.\n", "Q: Can I still upgrade my iPhone 3G to iOS 4.x? Seeing this question made me think about upgrading my iPhone 3G to iOS 4.x, if that's still possible.\nI've deliberately kept my iPhone 3G on iOS version 3.1.3 because that's the final 3.x version; I tried 4.x when it first came out but decided to downgrade again (while I still could!) because I felt 4.x was too much of a burden on the little device.\nHowever, these days apps are generally downward compatible only to iOS 4.3 so I've had to go without many apps. I'm considering an upgrade now to get access to \"modern\" apps but I'm not sure whether I can actually still upgrade my phone because 4.3 is no longer current.\n- Is it possible, in 2013, to upgrade any device from 3.1.3 to 4.3?\nI guess that if I upgrade, there will be no going back. I can't imagine a downgrade would still be possible.\nI would also have to jailbreak it after the upgrade, only because I need the SIM unlock. \n\nA: The final iOS rev for iPhone 3G is 4.2.1, and you could always save a backup before upgrading and restor to the 3.X version if 4.2.1 was too much of a hog.\nHope this helps!\nEdit: This thread says its not even worth it. 4.2.1 is crippling to the device.\n", "Q: QuickLook and plist files I have the latest Xcode installed, but I can't \"quicklook\" plist files (I mean they appear as an xml file instead of a table).

I want to force the GPU on my 2011 MacBook Pro 15 (A1286) to remain on the integrated GPU while I run VMWare Fusion 5.x.\nThe gfxCardStatus software doesn't work on 10.8. Is there another solution?\n\nA: With OS X 10.8 gfxCardStatus is no longer capable of enforcing Integrated Graphics card only.\n\nWhen one uses VMWare Fusion, the discrete graphics card is enforced, which drains the battery too fast.\nI have not found any solution online to fix this. But I managed (thanks to PePe) to discover one.\nHow to use Integrated Graphics Card with VMware Fusion on OS X 10.8:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install gfxCardStatus\n\n*Before launching VMware Fusion, click on Integrated only (THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP: click it several times until it has the checkbox on the Integrated only.):\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Then launch VMWare Fusion, start whatever virtual machine. And don’t do anything inside. Leave it idle. There’s a BackTrack 5 R3 with the integrated graphics card:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*There’s a BackTrack 5 R3 VM and a Windows XP (both idle) with the integrated graphics card:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*I’m using iStatMenus (not free) to check my power consumption. Here’s my power consumption with the two VMs:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Cody Krieger (the creator of gfxCardStatus) says that even if it says that the Integrated is being used, the Discrete (NVidia) is still being powered on, which invalidates the whole exercise.\n\n*How do I know that I’m saving power? Well, let’s go to Discrete and check the power consumption:\n\n\n -> \n\n\n*\n\n*Now, let’s check what the consumption is (the same two idle VMs):\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*So instead of having 3:27 hours left, I now have 1:22 hours left. My consumption 2.5 Amp, instead of 1.1 Amp.\n\n*I can’t directly go back though:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*What I have to do is to stop VMware completely (Cmd + Q), go to Integrated only again and restart all the VMs\n\n*This is something that I discovered today. So it may not be working as expected, but for now it seems it is.\n\n*My setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X 10.8.2 on a Macbook Pro 8.2 (A1286, Quad Core i7 2.3 Ghz, 16gb RAM, 256gb OCZ Vertex 3, AMD Radeon HD 6750M 1GB)\n\n*VMware Fusion 5.0.1 with 2 VMs – Windows XP Pro and Backtrack 5 R3 (both were idle during this setup).\n\n\n\nA: I confirm the latest version of Krieger's gfxCardStatus won't compile on 10.6.8.  The compilation fails with hundreds of errors.  He must have added some 10.7+ only features.\nI picked a random, earlier version from his github, and it could compile on Xcode and seems to work without problems.\nDownload 1.8.1 from:\nhttps://github.com/codykrieger/gfxCardStatus/tree/v1.8.1\n\nA: Older versions allowed you to switch to Integreated only (gfxCardStatus) its when you have an updated version you wont be allowed.\nAnd this i bacause (as the creator stated) that it will not always shut down the dedicated gfx anyhow. And it can mess up and hang the VM (yes i happend). Also it can make it start with \"black\" -screen.

I recently enabled FileVault on my boot SSD drive as well as encrypted my other hard drive I put into the optical bay. So far, so good.\nHowever, each time I boot my desktop background reverts back to the default \"galaxy\" background that shipped with my MBP. Both my boot and secondary drive have their passwords stored in the keychain, so after logging in OSX should be able to see my background image.\nI've tried placing the image on my primary and secondary drive but neither made a difference.\nIs there some sort of trick I'm missing to get my own custom background image to stick after a reboot? I've even tried changing to a different default background image that ships with Mountain Lion, but even that reverted back to the default galaxy image.\nAny Ideas?\n\nA: This almost always has to do with corruption in the ~/Library since I've seen this come and go well before FileVault 2 came out.\nHave you tried making a second user account and testing if the problem persists for a new user account?\nIf not, you'll need to poke into the ~/Library/Preferences folder, sort by date and see which files get updated when you change the desktop background and drag those preference files to the trash. (don't erase trash just yet in case you drag too many or the wrong preferences to trash).\nReboot and test - still not deleting the files. Once you think you've isolated the files (or file) where desktop pictures is stored, make a note of the file and empty the trash and the time.\nThat way if something else messes up, you can restore that file or resume the process of clearing selective preference files.\n", "Q: Connecting Canon CanoScan FS4000US USB Scanner to Mac OS 10.7.5 I have an old Canon CanoScan FS4000US Slide Scanner.

Also, when I disconnect and reconnect the USB cable, the slide tray ejects on the scanner. What I would like to know is if there is any way to mount the scanner properly as a device so that it will be available in Image Capture. I downloaded VueScan, a third-party software, that is able to see the device and process a scan, so there must be some way to get the drivers to see the device in Image Capture.

I use an iOS app that autostarts whenever I reboot the phone. How can I disable that ?\n\nA: In general, an iOS app is stateless.\nWhether it's running or not, only the core iOS scheduler knows if a process is loaded into RAM and running or paused, suspended, or \"frozen\" to storage.\nIf you are referring to the list of icons that show in the multitasking bar - that too is stateless. All the programs that have been run show up in that list - even if you haven't run them yet on this boot. In fact, that list is backed up and restored onto a new device, so you could have an app appear in the multitasking bar that has never run ever on that device.\n", "Q: Sound always comes from Apple Thunderbolt Display even with headphones connected I have an issue using the Apple Thunderbolt Display. I have a Dell XPS laptop with Windows 8 where I connect to the display over Thunderbolt, but every time I try to listen to some music or video, the sound comes from the screen, not from my laptop, even if I plug headphones into the laptop. How can I solve this problem? I want to work using my laptop and the screen but I want to redirect the sound to my headphones. Is this possible?\n\nA: In Windows, you can typically choose a different output-source using this approach:\n\nFor switching outputs, try this:\n  Right click on the speaker icon in the tray. Choose \"playback\n  devices\". Select from the list of playback devices (speakers, hdmi,\n  usb headset,) (the device you want) Choose \"Set Default\" Your audio\n  output will instantly switch Source\n\nFor quick access to this, you can download this application.\nApplicable to OS X users:\nYou should be able to see the earphones in the music menu. Hold down Alt while clicking the Audio-icon in the menubar. There you can switch between the different audio devices, like the external screen and the earphones.\nThis can also be done from System Prefrences -> Sound and the tab Output.\n\nA: For those seeing this in OS X instead of Windows, there is a separate sound output selection box for \"Sound Effects\". Make sure to select Headphones.\n\n\nA: FYI I had a very similar problem. It was happening on Skype calls even when I had all the audio settings set to headphones. However, I then discovered that Skype has it's own preferences, and they were over-riding the computer settings and choosing the display audio. \nI changed the Skype settings to \"built-in\" input and output (which seems counterintuitive because actually it was going to and from my earphones which I had plugged into the laptop!) Anyway, that fixed it and now I can make Skype calls using my earphone with mic!\n", "Q: Does AirDrop use up Bandwidth? I recently used AirDrop for the first time to send about 30GB of videos to a friend while we were both connected to my internet. Two days later I got an e-mail from my internet provider saying I was over 50% of my monthly bandwidth at 50.31GB, and this was only a couple days into the \"new month\". I haven't downloaded anything these first few days of the month, nor have I been browsing/streaming much over my network.\nI'm wondering if AirDrop is the reason why I've burned through a bunch of data.\n\nA: AirDrop sets up a direct connection between two computers on the local network, so it won't send anything over the internet. You might need to look elsewhere for the usage.\n\nA: AirDrop creates a direct connection to another Mac through it's wireless card and therefor does not transfer across your LANs wired network or wireless network and most certainly does not effect your internet bandwidth.\nHere are 4 possible reasons for the high bandwidth.\n\n\n*\n\n*You are unaware of software on your Mac because someone else has installed it on your behalf. Perhaps Online Backup Software or you may have installed it yourself and not been aware of the repercussions. i.e. Crashplan/Dropbox etc.\n\n*Your network has been compromised by a Neighbour via wireless. Reset your wireless routers password and make sure it is set to use a secure protocol i.e. WPA2\n\n*You have another device on your network to do with streaming Movies to your TV like Netflix.\n\n*You have signed up for iTunes Match and have synced Music and Movies to all your Mac devices.\n", "Q: Does iOS 7 cellular tethering limit the number of WiFi clients? I'm looking on Apple's site and can't find any published limits on how many clients can connect to one iPhone / iPad with cellular tethering enabled in the US.\nSetting aside the obvious limit where 1,000 devices would overwhelm the data connection in practice if they all want data at the same time, is there a hardware or software limit of perhaps 5 or 10 devices that can connect to one device over WiFi?\n\nA: The thing about these limits is that the carriers and iPhone models are all different. For instance, the iPhone 5 should theoretically be able to handle up to 14 connections, but both AT&T and Verizon limits it to 5. As far as I have understood, it is hardware-limited, and therefore it is not affected by iOS version.\nI have started on a list which anyone may suggest an edit to if they come up with new information.

I am trying to sync my iPhone calendars with the calendar on my PC that is in .ics format.  The .ics file is located on a home server that allows both me and my wife to see each other’s calendars and its been working great.  Now, I want to be able to see my calendar from my iPhone 4 (with OS 6.1) .. and I’ve tried setting it up with: Settings / Mail, Contacts, Calendars / Add Account… / Other / Add Subscribed Calendar. With every possible configuration I can think of, I get the same response: \n\nCalendar Subscription — Unable to verify account information\n\nFor server name, I’ve tried actual servername, IP address, etc; we do have security on the server but I put in the account name and password … ‘nuthin! Unable to verify. Through the phone's browser, I am able to open up the folder on our server and see the .ics file. The path is \n\nxxxx.homeserver.com/webcal/nat_calendar.ics. \n\nI've tried sending an invite to myself, opening it in the phone, clicking on the link and I get this error: \n\nCannot Subscribe: Could not subscribe to the calendar nat_calendar.ics from myservername. \n\nSeems simple. What am I missing here?\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I found the answer to my particular issue.  The reason that my iPhone could not subscribe to a published Outlook .ics calendar was because the MIME type of the .ics file was wrong.  As recommended in this brilliant post by Joe Bradford, I went into IIS, changed the MIME type from application/octet-stream to text/calendar, and iPhone could connect and subscribe without further issue. Success! \nPS: I did not run into the second issue that Joe chased down, which was having to remove the Byte Order Mark (BOM) from the .ics file via a hexadecimal editor. \n\nA: In most cases, you only have to slide the calendar to 'ON' in your exchange settings.\nSettings > Email, contacts, > your account > switch Calendars to ON.\nsimple as that.\n\nA: I usually send my invitations from Thunderbird. I was having the same problem with the ICS files after upgrading my iPhone 4s to iOS 7.\nI did some experimenting and found out that if I turn off the \"Support Outlook 2000 and Outlook 2002/XP\" option in the E-Mail Notification dialog, the ICS file works on the iPhone; however, if that option is turned on, then the iPhone can't open the ICS file.\nNote that this worked fine in the latest iOS 6 build (I always had the Outlook option on).

I googled merp crashing outlook and came across an article on answers.microsoft.com.  From what it said, you need to update Microsoft Error Reporting Program (Merp) from Here:   http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=28734.\nBefore you do that, check and see if you have any rules that may be corrupt and remove them.\nHere's the link about Merp crashing outlook:\nhttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2011-macoutlook/outlook-2011-crashes-every-time-i-open-rules/8740225f-9b4b-4df7-a1e1-f693fb12322f?msgId=655b76b4-28af-4df0-b5e5-56989f26677e\n\nA: Hey I had the same issue with my computer.

In order to add autocompletion to sudo, you should simply add to the file $HOME/.bash_profile\ncomplete -cf sudo\n\nThe description of complete and its options is briefly defined in the bash built-in commands manual page (see man bash). Although the -c and -f commands are not obviously detailed, one can find their description under the \"-A action\" explanation.\n\nA: It would help to know what shell you are using. This works for me in both bash and zsh. The completion in zsh is much better than bash. \nOne thing you could do is to type the command you want using tab completion, but before hitting return type control-a to go to the beginning of the line and then type sudo and hit return to execute the command.\n", "Q: Excel Data Analysis ToolPak available for download for Microsoft Office for Mac 2011?

I tried to eject the DVD by dragging and dropping it to the trash, which trashed the icon, but didn't eject the DVD.  I then forced Handbrake to quit, but without an icon on my desktop to select, how can I eject the DVD?\n\nA: Reboot the computer while holding down the mouse button - if there's no physical issue preventing ejection, the disc will be ejected.\nYou can of course use terminal to try to force an eject, but this requires a little knowledge of text commands and is covered here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a Terminal command that will force open the DVD tray?\n\nA: Open terminal.\ndrutil tray eject\n\nDVD ejected.\n", "Q: Time Machine wiped my external drive despite pressing \"Don't Use\" I have an external hard drive(formatted as FAT32) that has been in use on/off for years. I even had backups on it (not using time machine). I mounted this hard drive, it was taking a while to mount. A prompt came up to ask if I wanted to use this drive as a time machine backup.

I'm trying to identify an appropriate global hotkey to set in iTerm2's preferences for showing/hiding it:\n\nI'd like to avoid any conflicts with other applications' hotkeys or other future use. Are there any blocks of key combinations reserved for user assignment in OS X, or groups of key combinations which aren't generally used, which would be particularly suitable?\n\nA: I have found that Cmd+Control+A-Z are usually available for your custom global shortcuts.\nTwo notable exceptions are:\n\n*\n\n*Cmd+Control+F, which makes apps full-screen.\n\n*Cmd+Control+Q, which Immediately locks your screen.\n\nAlso note mac OS does not differentiate between Cmd+Control and Control+Cmd. So unfortunately you can't get clever and simply reverse the order of the modifier keys to get more available binding options.\nI too would like to be able to access a complete list, however, which is how I arrived to this page.\n\nA: This is regarding a EU (European) keyboard, however, I use ctrl and the key directly above it ( < ). It has yet to conflict with anything.\n\nA: Here are Apple's official OS X Human Interface Guidelines for Keyboard Shortcuts. \nThe document appears to be a current, authoritative, and complete guide to assigning keyboard shortcuts. It covers both the conceptual basis for using particular modifier keys, as well as the nitty-gritty of exactly which keys and which combinations are reserved system-wide, or likely to be reserved in the future.\nHere's second Apple page showing a complete summary of existing keyboard shortcuts.\n\nA: This is something I've been (and still am) tremendously bothered with, and have sinked a considerable amount of time to find something that both works as I'd like it to, and not interfere with the myriad of shortcuts already existing in OS X.\nI was pretty partial to using the cmd+alt+ctrl+some key combo for a long time, and it works pretty well across the board. But, if you want something almost bulletproof, and seek to increase your geek cred all at one fell swoop, take a look at this blog post by Brett Terpstra, the guy behind nvAlt, among other things. It walks you through replacing your Caps Lock key with the combo cmd+alt+ctrl+shift, so you can do a 5-key combo (Caps Lock+some key) with 2 keys, which is awesome. This method gives you a whole keyboard worth of shortcuts not used by any app.\nPS: Look at the comment section of the blog post to disable the esc functionality.\n\nA: To find all the currently-assigned system shortcuts, open System Preferences -> Keyboard and select Keyboard Shortcuts. You can then scan through the options and see if the combination you like has been chosen. If it has, you can double-click the assignment and change it if you want, or just pick a different set of modifier keys. With Shift, Control, Option, Command, and Escape to choose from, finding an easy-to-remember and sensible combination shouldn't be too hard.\n\nA: Any application can use any keyboard shortcut. If the application isn't a windowed application, then the developers need to ensure that they're not conflicting with existing system shortcuts. For example, you don't want a faceless app using, say, Cmd+Shift+G, which is the Go To Folder command in Finder. (And I think that the system would override such usage anyway.) \nI tend to use multiple modifier keys when creating custom shortcuts for anything that might conflict with the system. Within specific apps, you just need to find shortcuts that the app doesn't use. And System Preferences will tell you if there is a conflict.\n", "Q: Does iCloud require any telephone land line infrastructure to send messages? If all phone lines are down (meaning a local or national phone line outage) and with all cell phone towers being down, is there a way that I could send a iMessage (or an SMS) to other iPhone users by using iCloud Service (your offsite server farm)? \nI am trying to figure out if a Cloud-Push Manager could push my message to all receivers, who are registered.\nIs Apple's iMessage proprietary text messaging platform a transmission system that allows iMessages to go directly via satellite to those iPhone subscribes? Even if all telephone land lines are down?\n\nA: iCloud depends on the internet for transmission of data. iPhones, unfortunately, aren't capable of being sat-phones at this point (by themselves). As long as both the sender and the recipient have internet access, and as long as both are using iMessage (not SMS), then the iMessage should successfully be sent and received. \nThere are obviously multiple ways to get internet through which your phone could be connected. As you are aware, one such way is through cellular towers (if functioning), or another option is through a wifi connection (but again, this must have a landline connection as well). It is possible to get internet through a satellite dish and then broadcast that connection via wifi to your phone.\nAgain, both the sender and recipient must have internet in order to be able to communicate with iMessage.\n", "Q: Can I safely remove /usr/bin/java from Mountain Lion 10.8.2? If I do so, will something, such as a service, break? \n\nA: Mac App Store apps and OS X core applications and services don't depend on Java, but some 3rd party applications (like LibreOffice) do, and they will break if you delete /usr/bin/java.\nSince /usr/bin/java is a symlink:\n/usr/bin/java -> /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/Commands/java\n\nif you notice that an application complains about missing Java or fails to start after deleting /usr/bin/java simply recreate it like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Applications>Utilities>Terminal\n\n*Make the symlink (type your password if asked):\n$ sudo ln -s /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/Commands/java /usr/bin/java\n\n", "Q: iPhone default Bluetooth music app How does my iPhone choose which music app to start when I pair with the Bluetooth unit in my car? I'd like it to automatically start Spotify every time, but sometimes it starts playing from the Music app, even if I've used Spotify earlier that day.\n\nA: I don't know if there would be a way to change the app that plays but maybe in your car's Bluetooth settings there may be an option for disabling auto play.\nNot exactly what you're looking for but at least the same song from Music won't keep playing?\n\nA: Delete the iOS music app and then play a song with any other music app, such as Spotify. This other music app will now be the default music app that will be automatically started when you pair your iPhone with the Bluetooth unit in your car, even after restarting your iPhone. As stated in the original question, this will not always be the case if the iOS music app is installed on the iPhone.\nThis technique is also detailed in an answer to a similar question.\n\nA: I always thought that it was the last app which was used to play audio which was chosen for playback when you connect to bluetooth, and my experience until now supports that.\nBut, we know that IOS can relentlessly kill apps running in background if there is a critical RAM (memory) bottleneck in the system.\nCould it be the case that while you were browsing the web and doing other things, there has been a memory (RAM) bottleneck in the system and spotify was killed while it was in the background? If that was the case, when you connect to the bluetooth and the car stereo commanded iphone to play something, since Spotify was already dead, the phone probably defaulted to its own music player.\nWhat model is your iphone? If it has a model which has less than 4GB of RAM, this case could be more probable, depending on what you have did on that couple of hours while browsing the web.\nNext time when you experience that, I recommend taking your phone and trying to open Spotify. If spotify launches from the scratch (full screen spotify logo is shown while starting), that supports my thesis. If it just opens as you closed it before (i.e. no full screen spotify logo while starging the app), that means that it wasn't killed by IOS, and my thesis is wrong, so something else should be going on.\n", "Q: Can I put a 7200 RPM hard drive in my MacBook Pro? I have a 2009 15\" unibody MacBook Pro. It came with a 250GB, 5400 RPM hard drive. Will a 7200 RPM drive make it overheat?\nI have read somewhere that putting a 7200 RPM hard drive in the MacBook Pro will make it shake and vibrate. Is this true?\nIs there a certain brand that is better for the system?\nAnd finally, is there anything else that I need to worry about?\n\nA: No, no, no and no.\nHave fun with the 7200 rpm drive of your choice. Mac drive mounting hardware is excellent and the drive screws are standard sized. Unless you get a drive with exotic firmware or physically too large to fit, there will be no issues relating to design. Only a faulty drive (or failing Mac) will cause issues. \nSimple physics means a 7200 RPM drive has to generate more heat than a 5400 RPM drive, but in practice, this is well within a normal Mac's ability to cool - even when you never let the drive spin down - something else like CPU load will be needed to get the internal fan to spin up.\n\nA: I've got a MBP mid '10 and changed the 5400 rpm 250 GB HD with a Seagate 7200 rpm 750 GB. Even the original is a Seagate. I needed a Torx screwdriver for internal screws.\nMy mac is now a little more noisy (I hear a subtle noise during night :-P) and no hotter. Moreover it seems to me that the battery duration is only a little lower. All in all I'm satisfied. I need a big HD.\n\nA: Don't be surprised if any new drive has a problem in that model MBP. If you have a problem, the likely solution is to replace the SATA cable with the cable form a 2010 MBP. Available at iFixit.\n", "Q: Use Boot Camp drivers from DVD or download? I have an iMac mid-2010. It came with Snow Leopard when I bought it. Now, I'd like to install Windows 7 64-bit on my iMac. Should I install the Boot Camp drivers from the DVDs that came with my computer, or download the drivers using the Boot Camp Assistant that I have now in Mountain Lion?\n\nA: As you have upgraded your operating system to Mountain Lion, I would recommend getting the latest drivers from the internet. \nWhile I can't say that they are definitely updated, Wikipedia notes that Mountain Lion runs Boot Camp 5 wheres Snow Leopard was version 3.\n", "Q: Will this hard drive work with my 2009 15 macbook pro unibody? Western Digital WD Scorpio Black 750 GB SATA 3 GB/s 7200 RPM 16 MB Cache Internal Bulk/OEM 2.5-Inch Mobile Hard Drive\ni need to know if this hard drive will work with my computer?\nI have 8 GB of memory (maxed out)\nI also need to know also if this is a good hard drive. \nHas any one used it? Is it quiet? Does it over heat?\n\nA: No experience with that drive but you may encounter issues with that model MBP  and any replacement drives. Downgrading the firmware may fix the issue or you any need to replace the SATA cable. You may not want to do either in advance but don't be surprised if you encounter a problem.\n", "Q: New TimeMachine backup on the same drive I have recently successfully cleaned my hard drive and restored data with the TimeMachine backup. Now I would like to prepare backup of \"new\" system. Do I have to clean the drive first?\n\nA: If you're asking about multiple backup of the same Mac on another backup volume, then no, that's not possible as the Time Machine will backup the same Mac and effectively overwrite the most recent backup.\nIf on the other hand you're asking about backing up multiple (different) Macs on the same backup volume, that's possible. I back up 5 Macs onto my NAS regularly.\n\nA: No, you don't have to clean it. Just plug it in and a new Backup will be written. As far as I know the most recent backup is used to restore the system, so if you consider to restore the very same state again in the future, the only solution is not to plug in the time machine hard disk after you backed up your current state. \nHowever, you should consider that this is not how time machine is intended to be used. \n", "Q: Startup iTunes to Shared Library / Home Sharing I've enabled iTunes Home Sharing on 2 Macs, and I want the remote iTunes to start up directly to the shared library instead of the default local library and manually selecting \"Shared Library\".\nMuch appreciated.\n\nA: Unfortunately, you can't do this. THere might be a way to script it, but I doubt that; I don't think Apple wants people to be able to do this. \n", "Q: How to disable Magic Trackpad while typing? Is it possible to get the external Magic Trackpad disabled automatically while I'm typing?\nI do get a lot of cursor movements/clicks when just touching the trackpad accidentally.\n\nA: You could just goto your Bluetooth icon in the menu bar and disconnect it till you wish to start using it again, then goto said menu again and reconnect it. \n\nA: If you mean the built-in trackpad, then you cannot disable it. But you can disable it if you connect an external mouse to your Mac.\nTo do, just open System Preferences > Accessibility (or Universal Access) > Mouse & Trackpad > tick on Ignore built-in trackpad when mouse or wireless trackpad is present\nYou're done.\n", "Q: How to convert .dmg to Directory-folder I just Create one Directory to .dmg file using Disk Utility. Can anyone Please Tel me how to convert .dmg file in to older Directory-folder.\n\nA: Mount it, and then copy?\nWhy won't that work?\n\nA: Mounting it first is definitely what Apple intended with the format, but I recently found a sketchy (via CNET) version of a package and was curious how it differed from the official version. I didn't trust OS X to mount it without potentially auto-running any malware it might have, so I just wanted a clean filesystem extract.\nTurns out, (p)7-zip can do it! Supposing your disk image is named sketchy.dmg:\nbrew install p7zip\n7z x sketchy.dmg\n\nWhich will extract everything in the image into the current directory, not necessarily into a new subdirectory like double-clicking .zip files in Finder does.\n", "Q: Why is the Page Number menu item greyed out in Pages '09? I want to insert a page number in my iWork document. I clicked on Insert and the Page Number title is grayed out.\nHow can I get the page number feature to activate? I used to insert it in other documents with no problem.\n\n\nA: It's greyed out because it needs somewhere to insert the page number. You have no insertion point active in the document to insert the page number.

I currently have an OS X server (running 10.8.2) that has irssi installed, and is set up to send Growl notifications to my laptop when I am mentioned or have received a private message on IRC. However, Growl only appears to have options to start when a graphical login is done: trying to run it in a terminal over SSH gives:\n$ /Applications/Growl.app/Contents/MacOS/Growl \n_RegisterApplication(), FAILED TO establish the default connection to the WindowServer, _CGSDefaultConnection() is NULL.\n\nRunning it as a launchd daemon also doesn't seem to work, as I can't use growlnotify to create a notification.\nIt runs normally when started as a login item or via the Finder, but this is unideal for a server machine, where I only want to login via SSH.\n\nA: You could try sending growl notifications via the network protocol instead of routing them through the Growl app.  e.g. send the notifications to your laptop using a python script \nhttp://pythonhosted.org/gntp/\n\nA: I would really suggest doing this programmatically Diggory suggests, though I haven't used Growl on OSX for distributed messaging (I use it on a NAS running Linux with great results.)\nThough, if that is ultimately unusable, have you tried logging into the computer and leaving your account logged in but deactivated using Fast User Switching?\nML (I think it was ML anyways) added the ability to allow multiple users simultaneous graphical sessions per computer, which might be appropriate for this, though honestly it's probably less strain on the system to do it programmatically.\n", "Q: Silica Gel stuck in headphone jack I have an unusual problem: I have a small ball of silica gel stuck on my Macbook Air headphone jack.\nAny ideas how I might get it out of my headphone jack?\n\nA: My sister is with the exactly same problem! She got a silica gel ball stuck her ipod touch 4 jack.\nI used a needle (sewing one) and \"destroyed\" the silica ball. Took a while, but it worked!\n\nA: This is the number one foreign object I've seen stuck in iPod / iOS headphone jacks and just like getting coins and business cards and CD's out of a stuck optical drive slot, your best bet is to get it in the hands of a trained technician to remove.\nNow, if you can't get to a technician you trust, you'll have to use some ingenuity to decide if you are able to dislodge it.\nIf the bead rattles around when you gently invert the device, it's very likely you could get it out by mechanical means (centripetal force as you swing your arm) or light suction or very carefully getting a lever past the sphere.\nUnfortulately, most cases the bead gets firmly wedged at the bottom due to force from a headphone jack and the force needed to crush the sphere usually damages the thin metal contacts that are designed to hold the tip of your headphone jack in the port.\nYou may want to consider the repair options and cost of a new jack before deciding to force out a foreign body such as a silica bead.\nGood luck, and hopefully this doesn't end up in a costly repair or replacement for you. \n\nA: *\n\n*Take toothpick\n\n*Put a very small amount of cyanolite glue at the flat tip (bottom) of the toothpick (diameter of the glue bubble MUST be much smaller than the ball or the socket diameter itself otherwise you'll glue your socket)\n\n*very precisely direct the flat tip of the toothpick toward the ball and stay still while it sets.

Don't smear: you can still scrape the dry glue with some metal blade later)\n\n*Pull! :)\n\nA: I used a safety pin bent out straight and scrapped the ball and repeatedly tapped my laptop on the side of the table until it came out. Took about 5 minutes.\nWhen the ball came out, it was not round anymore which was probably why it was able to wiggle out.\n\nA: My friends and I had the same problem, where it was VERY firmly stuck- we used a paper clip, smashed it into a million pieces, and then shook the pieces out normally. :) IT WORKS\n\nA: While this method also has its downsides (you can damage the black plastic connector casing) IMHO it is still the least destructive way.\nI had the same issue and extracted the ball with a heated needle:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take a confection iron-headed needle/pin.\n\n*Take one single piece of a terminal strip and attach it to sharp the end of the pin.  This will avoid getting your fingers burned.\n\n*Stabilize the iPad under a strong light source.\n\n*Heat up the pin with a cigarette lighter.\n\n*Insert the needle gently into the bead.\n\n*Wait until the needle has cooled down.\n\n*Gently pull the needle out.\n\n*Relax, breath and take your time.\n\n\nBe careful. Worked for me.  If possible, get some beads-experience first by trying out on some other beads.\n\n\n\nA: This is simple and protects your phone jack as well.\nRoll a small piece of paper about 1/2\" long and enough to wrap around an earphone jack 1+ times.  This makes a small round sleeve you can push in the opening all the way up to the silica bead.  It surrounds it and limits the adhesive.\nTake a round toothpick or a round coffee stirrer (best) that fits inside the paper sleve (the toothpick needs to be cut so the pointed end is cut off) and touch the tip of the coffee sirrer with hot glue (you want a viscous adhesive so it can't leak inside the jack) and insert it in the sleeve and allow to cool.\nOther adhesives would work ... paper/wood glue with water in it would be ok, but hot glue is fast and has great adherence.\nThen slide out the sleeve and whatever you push in the center of the sleeve.\nOut, out damn bead! (Shakespeare reference)\nI have used this MANY times as this occurs too frequently.\n\nA: Had two silica beads stuck in my iPad earphone jack at the same time. What a pain! Took a paperclip end and scraped the beads up and down, taking care not to touch the earphone contacts. The sides turned to powder within 2-3 minutes allowing for each one to fall out. Wrapped the paperclip with paper towel and wiped the inside.\n\nA: Consider trying this:\nUnscrew a two-piece ball point pen. Set aside the top of the barrel, the ink cartridge, and the spring. Place the tip of bottom section in (or around) the obstructed jack. Now.. well.. suck. I expect you won't be able to generate near enough suction to cause damage.\nJust take care that the silica gel ball doesn't turn out to be smaller in diameter than the aperture of the pen tip. Silica may be inert as far as your digestive system is concerned, but your lungs aren't nearly as forgiving when it comes to aspirating a foreign body, not even one of that small a size. Come to think of it, it's probably prudent to cover the end of the barrel you'll be placing in your mouth with a tissue or thin cloth, as any prior efforts to dislodge the ball may have left it in fragments the eye cannot discern.\n\nA: Shutdown the system then use a needle with a double sided tape stuck to it.\nUse this needle to get the silica gel out of the socket.\n\nA: you can also try using a thumb tac to break the ball in half\n\nA: Somehow I got a silica gel ball stuck in my Android Samsung Note 3's audio jack port.  I was able to use a small flat head screwdriver (the kind you use on eye glasses) and smash the silica ball by hitting it directly a few times.  It turned into dust and I used an air blower to get rid of the particles.  Works like a charm now.  \n\nA: I had this problem, the bead was stuck pretty good... no rattling. Scraping it with a pin/spike was the way it finally came out (and pretty easily too). I tried using superglue before that, and it was just messy and ineffective.\n\nA: I just went ahead and got aggressive and poked it with a small xbox controller torx screwdriver\nIt turned to powder and I can use my headphone jack as if nothing happened.\n\nA: Try below trick. It works like a charm.\n\n\n*\n\n*Apply 'superglue' or cyanoacrylate at the thick end of toothpick.\n\n*Insert that end into the headphone jack & take out the tooth pick.\n\n\nThat's it.\n\nA: I used a straightened out paper clip to grind the bead into pieces. Took about 3 minutes. Bead fell out in little pieces. Working fine now.  \n\nA: I just succeded getting out silica bead from my earphone port. I just crush them with the tiny screwdriver carefully, and the bead just crush to little pieces..and easily clean the port by turning the port inside down, to let the fraction out\n\nA: This happened to me on my old Lenovo laptop as well as a MBP. The bead was stuck quite deep, tried a pin to break it but no luck.\nAt the end my dad came to the rescue with a chisel shaped micro screwdriver. Just insert the screwdriver into the jack till it touches the silica bead. Gently apply some pressure and keep rotating the screwdriver till the bead breaks (took about 2-3 minutes). Please note, use a chisel shaped screwdriver. Should be available at any hardware store for around $2 - $5.

I currently have Macbook pro 13' and I am trying to games like Samurai vs Zombie and Contract Killer 2. Both of these are not highend games with not so detailed textures. Yet they get stuck after every click. \nIs there some way to do away with this ?\n\nA: Turn down all detail in the game (turn it up incrementally later).\nClose all running apps, except for the game(s). This includes your email client, web browser, etc. Check your \"Login Items\" under System Preferences. Ensure you don't have any background tasks that are consuming CPU cycles and/or system memory.\nIf you have minimal system memory (RAM), it would be a good idea to upgrade since RAM is so affordable now. You can never have enough RAM. I would recommend at least 8GB.\nActivity Monitor will also show the CPU load on your system when it's sitting idle. It will show apps that might be running unbeknownst to you.\n", "Q: How to automatically open files downloaded from Safari? When I download mp4 files from Safari, I'd like them to open automatically once they have been downloaded. How can this be done?\nSafari Preferences->General->Open \"safe\" files after downloading is checked.\nI want to automatically open file that might not be \"safe\".\n\nA: You can add a file extension to the list of \"safe\" extensions. Once that is done, safari will launch whatever application is associated with that file type.\nThis is done by creating the file ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.DownloadAssessment.plist containing the file extension you want opened.\nHere is an example, which solves the problem for .torrent files:\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com-PropertyList-1.0.dtd\"> \n<plist version=\"1.0\"> \n<dict> \n <key>LSRiskCategorySafe</key> \n<dict> \n <key>LSRiskCategoryExtensions</key> \n<array> \n <string>torrent</string> \n </array> \n </dict> \n </dict> \n</plist> \n\nMore info here.\nIf the file exists already, edit it and add the <string>torrent</string> line under the <array>tag\n\nA: This answer will describe how not to get the following message when you open a file downloaded from Safari for the first time.\n\nWell, I'm not sure why you're seeing this, but if your files are going to the ~/Download folder, you will have to tell the Operating System that you want that folder out of the quarantine. \nOpen your Terminal.app (Spotlight for Terminal) and type: \nxattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads\n\nYou might have to do it as super user (in which case, use this instead of the above), so if the above fails try with sudo before the command: \nsudo xattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads\n\nnote: You will be asked for your password if you use sudo, this is normal.\nWhat is xattr?\n\nThe xattr command can be used to display, modify or remove the\n  extended\n       attributes of one or more files, including directories and symbolic\n       links.  Extended attributes are arbitrary metadata stored with a file,\n       but separate from the filesystem attributes (such as modification time or\n       file size).\n\nWARNING: By doing the above, the OS will stop caring about files put in the Downloads folder. If you want to only do this for certain files, you will have to download your \"safe\" files elsewhere and execute the above command in that folder. \nIf you want to undo the operation, simply remove the -d\nxattr -r com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads\n\nThe -r is to make it recursive (so existing files and folders are also modified).\nUPDATE I've realized that new files will be put in quarantine when you download them, so although the above command will go file by file and remove the flag, so you don't have to tell the OS that the file is safe every time, in order to completely disable the mechanism, you have to execute an extra command. please make sure that this is ok with you, since you can't do this for single files, it's an all or nothing.\nTo Disable the warning dialogs completely for any files in the future, execute this command (Again, I'm not 100% sure if you need sudo, just try without it first.:\ndefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSQuarantine -bool NO\n\nAnd if you ever want to revert the change: \ndefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSQuarantine -bool YES\n\nI can't recall if you need to logoff/logon again or reboot. \nGood luck and be careful with those downloads. :)\nA restart IS required after these commands.\nLink attached for further reading on the Quarantine.\n\nA: One way is to use Hazel. I tried using it and it worked smoothly. However, Hazel isn't free ($25).\nThe second solution is to use Automator which is part of Mac OS X.\nHowever, using Automator didn't quite work. Some of the mp4 files did open, but for unknown reason some didn't.\nAlso I'm not sure if Automator has to open the files as soon as they are downloaded, or there is a time frame which it could take to open them. Maybe some one more experiences with Automator could elaborate on this. \n", "Q: Wifi problems Mac OS X 10.8.2 MacBook Pro There are hundreds of threads regarding Mac OS X 10.8.2 wifi problems, but no thread is describing exactly my issue. \nI have a MacBook Pro 2011 with OS X 10.8.2. Since around two months I have trouble with my wifi connection. \nAfter booting the Mac, wifi is working as usual. Connecting automatically and everything. Without any notice it stops working from one moment to another. Sometimes two minutes, sometimes an hour, but always at some point the wifi stops working. \nThe system stops showing other networks within my area and only shows my network. Disabling and enabling wifi shows me the \"wifi enabled\" icon without a connection, but looking into the network preferences clearly states that the wifi is disabled. In addition I am not able to enable the wifi in the network preferences. \nThings I have tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstalling the system (Time Machine Backup)\n\n*PREM Reset (can't count how often)\n\n*SMC Reset\n\n*Keychain - deleting all wifi connections and information\n\n\nI have the Checkpoint Endpoint Client E75 installed. It makes no difference if I use it or not. In addition I have the problem with every access point. I tried public hotspots, my companies wifi (Cisco hardware) and home network. Don't believe this is related to the protocol used by the router. \n\nA: If this is in your home, do you have an older microwave oven nearby? Or a 2.4GHz cordless phone? Baby monitor? Anything else \"wireless\" (that's not a wireless router/access point)?\nHave you tried changing the channel of the wireless on the router? Many newer routers will do a \"site survey\" and indicate an unused wireless channel.\nI have had similar problems with wireless in the past and solved it by changing the wireless channel.\n\nA: NEW: As commented by David, it is a hardware issue. My MB Pro came back from the shop with a new wireless card. Problem solved.\nI am having the exact same problem suddenly. The only solution that works is using an ethernet connection.\nI have tried using my iPhone via USB as my hotspot and that doesn't even work.\nEverything you stated, I am seeing.\nA question, did you recently install the firmware update for the battery issue?? That is the only change on my computer in the last couple of days. I have no idea if it is connected, but just seems like a possible cause.\nKaleb\n\nA: Try changing Location, which is essentially a pool of the networks you regularly access. Mine apparently became corrupted after a recent update so I went through the gauntlet of \"fixes\" - many mentioned above - to no avail. A colleague who used to be an Apple Genius (still is in my book!) showed me the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Select Network\n\n*Highlight Wi-Fi (or whatever your wireless n/w is called)\n\n*Click the lock in the lower left corner to allow edits\n\n*Select Edit Locations from Location pull-down menu in top-center\n\n*Create any new Location - I called mine Test until the fix was confirmed\n\n*Apply changes\n\n*Confirm n/w connectivity - if good, delete problematic Location\n\n\nLike most of the other suggestions out there, this likely won't help everyone, but for me it was instantaneous.\n\nA: Apparently this seems to be a hardware issue. I had the chance to take the wifi module from an unused MBP at work. Now everything works fine. \nThank you for all suggestions and your help. Highly appreciated!\n", "Q: Where is the New Oxford American Dictionary stored? I'm trying to build a command line tool to look up definitions of words, it's only a dummy app for me to practise my C++ skills.\nI know there is a list of words stored at /usr/share/dict - but what I'm really looking for is the path to the New Oxford American Dictionary data, it comes bundled with the system, but I couldn't find it yet.\n\nA: The dictionaries are stored in...\n/Library/Dictionaries\n~/Library/Dictionaries\n\n\n\nA: In 10.14 (and possibly earlier), the dictionaries have moved to\n/System/Library/Assets/com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices_dictionaryOSX/\nThere is one .asset directory for each downloaded dictionary; for example, my American English dictionary is located at: /System/Library/Assets/com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices_dictionaryOSX/69b7ab1cf0f75ad16bf6662b0a77fbfd36b7941f.asset/AssetData/New\\ Oxford\\ American\\ Dictionary.dictionary.\nUPDATE\nIn macOS 11.5, it seems to be a slightly different path:\n/System/Library/AssetsV2/com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices_dictionaryOSX\n", "Q: iTerm ZSH - Missing Right Prompt I'm using oh-my-zsh and iTerm2. I've also enabled the zsh-vim-mode plugin from oh-my-zsh. One of the annoyances I've encountered is my right prompt (RPS1 & RPROMPT) doesn't seem to show up. I'd like it to indicate what vim mode I'm currently in.\nI'm using the robbyrussel theme. It seems my $RPS1 variable is set. I'm wondering if there's a configuration option I'm missing.\n\nI'm running 10.7.\nSame issue in 10.8.\n\nA: Try wrapping your RPROMPT in single quotes. I've seen double quotes cause issues for others with their prompts before.\nI would also ditch the precmd > setprompt process for the moment and just set RPROMPT directly to simplify for testing. Start with something like\nprecmd() {\n  ...\n}\nPROMPT=$'\\n$(rb_prompt) in $(directory_name) $(git_dirty)$(need_push)\\n› '\nRPROMPT='%{$fg_bold[cyan]%}$(todo)%{$reset_color%}'\n\nand refine from there.\n\nA: After investigating - I found a few things that fixed this:\n\n\n*\n\n*I had some oh-my-zsh plugins that were setting RPS1 instead of RPROMPT - it seems that setting both caused neither to be shown.\n\n*Setting RPROMPT in precmd also caused it to disappear.\n\n\nA: Make sure that $RPS1 or $RPROMPT is not defined in one of your plugins. For example, the plugin vi-mode defines $RPS1 inside an if statement. To test, disable ALL plugins inside your .zshrc and see if that fixes things.\n", "Q: how to tab text blocks in terminal input line $ I want to be able to tab from the start of one word to the next in this line, but how?\n\nusually if I paste something in the input line then want to change something in the start or middle, I have to press  the left arrow for a long time, is there a faster way to do this?\n\nA: Use option ⌥+→ and option ⌥+←. You will be able to step by one word. \nUpdate: \nYou can also go to start of the line using control+A or to end of the line using control+E\n\nA: If you check Preferences > Settings > Keyboard > Use option as meta key, you can also use ⌥B and ⌥F (and ⌥⌫  will delete a word backward).\nTerminal's default settings also affect programs like vim and nano where M-f doesn't go a word forward.

I have a couple thousand business contacts that are organized by type. However when I enter a new contact on my iphone it ends up in the all contacts group along with all the rest. There is no default setting available in contacts' settings.\nMy goal is this: When I take a call in the field and gather a new contacts info (client, vendor, etc.) the office can go through the group called \"new contacts to be organized\" group and put them in their rightful place for marketing etc.\n\nA: The iPhone (iOS) allows for very little control over contact groups. There is no way to create a group on iOS but there is a way to create a contact in an existing group. This is done by tapping the \"Groups\" button in the upper right corner. There will likely be several options here for groups. Tap the one you want to create your contact in, and you should see checkmarks on the other groups turn off. Then tap the \"Done\" button. You can now tap the \"+\" button to create a new contact which will be added to the group that you are in.\nNote: the following instructions work if you use iCloud for managing your contacts.\nTo edit groups you must either use iCloud.com, or have a Mac and then use Contacts.app. So, you can accomplish your stated goal by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Going to iCloud.com, logging in, and selecting \"Contacts\".\n\n*Select the red group icon towards the right of the left page.\n\n*Click the \"+\" button on the bottom right of the left page.\n\n*Enter the group name.\n\n*This new group should appear on your device.\n\n*Tap the \"Groups\" button in the upper right corner of Contacts.app on your iPhone.\n\n*Select the group you just created.\n\n*Tap done.\n\n*Create your contact.\n\n\nSomeone can then log into iCloud.com and change the group that the contact is associated with.\n\nA: If you have a mac, you can create a new smart group in the Contacts app on OS X. And you can choose - \"where note - contains - office\"\nWhen you create contacts on iPhone, just add a note with the text 'office' or something unique, that'd automatically put this contact in that new smart group.\n", "Q: Finder shows stale directory listings from NFS server I have an Ubuntu 12.04 Linux server sharing files via NFSv4. I mount the share on my MacBook Pro running Mac OS X 10.7.5. I have the NFS share set up to automount in Disk Utility with default mount options.\nI find that when changes happen on the server in a directory that I have had open in the Finder recently, the Finder does not reflect the changes for a very long time. If I use the terminal to \"ls\" the same directory, I see the changes. It seems that the Finder is caching directory listings locally, and that this caching is very aggressive.\nClosing and reopening the window doesn't help. Force quitting the Finder does not help. Unmounting and remounting the NFS share does not help. Rebooting works, but that's a very blunt instrument.\nHas anyone experienced this, and does anyone know of any workarounds? I'm looking to eliminate the caching, so that the Finder does to the VFS layer on every access, or at least shorten the TTL of the cached data.\nI've evaluated changing the share to SMB or AFP, but I cannot undertake that and am looking for a way to manually invalidate Finder's cache (or otherwise poke at it) if I can't change Finder's behavior outright.\nETA: This doesn't seem to be an issue any more in Mavericks.\n\nA: I had the same problem and found a solution here that worked for me:\ndscacheutil -flushcache\nkillall Finder\n\nThe man page of dscacheutil says that the -flushcache option should only be used in extreme cases, so there may be risks to this method that I'm not aware of.\n\nA: I had stale files in Finder when I used noac,nonegnamecache in the NFS mount options on Yosemite. Removing those options fixed the problem.\nInstead of noac (which is equivalent to actimeo=0), I added actimeo=1 to set the attribute cache timeout to 1 second. I'd prefer if the attribute cache was disabled completely, but this way at least the timeout is low.\n\nA: I could confirm that there is such a problem, but it's not been consistent for me. I've just checked against SAMBA and NFS shares on the same server, using the same directories and file for the test. I've had an updated view for both shares in Finder, two times in a row. However, I've experienced the problem as described before. Looks like it happens under more specific conditions.\nI do not see this problem using other protocols like AFP or SMB, so the obvious workaround would be to alter the server if we can't isolate / affect Finder's caching. In the mean time, you know this might be one solution if no better solution arises here.\n", "Q: How to open .packproj files? I am unable to run an installer with .packproj extension. I am unable to find anything via Web search.\nCan these files be handled natively by macOS? How do I install a package with this extension?\n\nA: .packproj-files were files used by developers in the process of application development for OS X 10.2. They contain xml-strings – try editing the file in TextEdit or TextWrangler, you should see an XML-structure, or see this example.\nIt can't really be run alone, it's used to tell packaging applications how to pack the application into a real application.\nTo put it short, it can be used with the application Iceberg:\n\n(.packproj): Creates a project file for use with Iceberg. This allows you to use Iceberg to edit package options before creating the actual package.\n\nDo note that this is ancient code, and may not work (supposed to work from OS X 10.2 and up).\n\nA: There is also the Packages tool.\n", "Q: How do I prevent 'Open with...' showing multiples of same app?

My springboard has frozen and the lock button is broken (two months out of warranty and it's not classed as a hardware failure). \nHow do I restart the phone given that I can't access any apps or settings?\nWaiting for the battery to drain will take days, so that's not an option. Is there a way through iTunes to force a reboot or is there a program I can download to force a reboot?\n\nA: Enable AssistiveTouch:  Tap Settings, General, Accessibility, AssistiveTouch (near the bottom) and tap AssistiveTouch to ON.\nYou will now notice a small dark square with a circle in the middle (you can move this square anywhere).  Tap the dark circle to open the AssistiveTouch menu, then tap Device and tap and hold the Lock Screen icon.

My setup is all Apple: two Macs behind an Airport Extreme, one at x.x.x.20 listening on port 22 and the other at x.x.x.30 listening on 10,022. \nI've setup NAT on the AP to forward external ports 22 to the x.x.x.20 and 10,022 to x.x.x.30. I want the tunnel to run to x.x.x.20:10022.\nI've been using this command from an apple device outside of my home network: ssh -v -f -N -R 22:localhost:10022 homeuser@myhomedoman.com as well as ssh -v -f -N -R 10022:localhost:22 homeuser@myhomedoman.com but either way, the logs on the x.x.x.20:22 listening machine show that the traffic goes to it and the x.x.x.30:10022 machine show no record in the secure.log file. I've even tried ssh -v -f -N -R 10022:localhost:10022 homeuser@myhomedoman.com and the traffic still hits the x.x.x.20:22 listening machine.\nThe strange thing is that when i run ssh -p 10022 homeuser@myhomedoman.com it connects to the x.x.x.30:10022 listening machine just fine. I've gone through every NAT rule in the Airport as well and there's only one rule covering port 10022 so it's not a NATing problem as far as the AP's configuration is concerned.\nEither I'm doing something really wrong, there's a bug in Apple's implementation of reverse SSH tunnels or that the Airport is doing something funny with the traffic.\nHas anyone else had this problem or found a workaround? \nThe guide I'm running to get the reverse tunnel running is http://www.vdomck.org/2005/11/reversing-ssh-connection.html\nThanks in advance!  \n\nA: To avoid confusion I'll call:\n\n\n*\n\n*x.x.x.20 -> local1\n\n*x.x.x.30 -> local2\n\n*Apple device outside your home network -> remote1\nYou say:\n\nI've setup NAT on the AP to forward external ports 22 to the x.x.x.20\n  and 10022 to x.x.x.30.\n\nwhich I interpret like this:\n                 ________                 +-----------------+         +-----------+\n                /        \\ -  port 22 ----|-----------------|------>  | local1:22 |                                  \n+---------+    (          )               |                 |         +-----------+\n| remote1 | -  ( Internet )               | Airport Express |                                     \n+---------+    (          )               |                 |         +--------------+\n                \\________/ -  port 10022 -|-----------------|------>  | local2:10022 |  \n                                          +-----------------+         +--------------+\n\nThat is, local2 is reachable on [public IP address of Airport Extreme]:10022. \nHowever, the ssh commands you run in your question use the default SSH port (that is, 22/tcp), and connect to local1:22 (more exactly: they connect to [public IP address of Airport Extreme]:22, which forwards the connection to local1:22).\nYou must modify the ssh command you run on remote1 like this (notice option -p 10022):\nremote1$ ssh -p 10022 -f -N -R 2222:localhost:22 [username at local2]@[public IP address of Airport Extreme]\n\n-p 10022 tells ssh which port to connect to, while 2222:localhost:10022 tells ssh to allocate a socket on local2 to listen to port 2222 and forward any packet sent to that port to port 22 on remote1:\n +------------+                         +----------------------+\n |            |                         |                      |\n | remote1:xx | -- SSH (port 10022)-->  | local2:10022 (SSH)   |\n |            |                         |                      |\n | remote1:22 | <--- SSH tunnel ------  | local2:2222 (alloc'd |\n |            |                         |              by ssh) |\n +------------+                         +----------------------+\n\nNow you can access remote1 from local2 as follows:\n local2$ ssh -p 2222 remoteuser@localhost\n\n(You use -f in your command which sends ssh to the background. The sshd process that binds to port 2222 and runs on local2 will continue to execute even if you stop Remote Login in System Preferences:\n\nTo stop it, list it:\nlocal2$ lsof -i | grep 2222\nlocal2$ sshd   855 jaume   14u  IPv6 0x4857f   0t0  TCP localhost:2222 (LISTEN)\n\nand kill it with kill <PID>:\nlocal2$ kill 855\n\nwhere PID is the second value in lsof's output line.)\n", "Q: Mac shuts down automatically Hi I am using MacBook 2008 model.\nI've installed Win XP using Bootcamp.\nFor past few weeks I notice that when running Win XP, after few minutes (approx 15 to 20 mins), laptop gets shutdown automatically.\nThis does not happens when running OS X.\nAny Suggestions...??\n\nA: If the fans are running fast it's an overheating issue.

I just bought a third-gen Apple TV, and I don't want to have to open Settings to put it to sleep every time I'm done using it. It seems it won't fall asleep automatically for quite some time, so I'd like to know how much power it draws when not in use.\n\nA: According to the review on FlatpanelsHD.com, it will use 0.8 watts when in standby (not sleep), and 1.9 watts when in use. To use their description, this is \"ridiculously low.\"\nSince all the device needs to do is wait for Bonjour, AirPlay, or IR signals — and the upper number matches up with Apple's own report — I'd say this is believable.\nFun perspective fact from the Apple report: It takes 30 Apple TVs, all streaming HD video, to use the same amount of power as a common 60W light bulb.\nYou can quickly put the Apple TV to sleep by holding the play/pause button on the home screen. The cursor should be over one of the apps, not a content preview, and last I tested, this didn't work with the play/pause button of the Remote app.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 13 inch for work I have just sold my iMac 27 inches for the reason it being too big! I will avoid mentioning the reasons, but...\nNow that I have got the exact money to buy the new 13 inch retina one. Problem is I am a programmer and I am wondering if such screen is not too small for working. I doubt I will have, in a good span of time this money again so chances are the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*buy MBP 13 inch retina, that has a very good display for my sight.\n\n*buy any other random laptop that is 15 inch or more or an older version of MBP.\n\n\nSo in short, the question is:\nDoes the MacBook Pro 13 inch retina have a good ( / big ) enough screen to be productive at work, particularly for a programmer?\nAny experience with this?\n\nA: If your programing needs include displaying an iPad with retina simulator, then perhaps a 13\" MBP limited real estate will slow you down. Choose a 13\" MBP for mobility.\nFrom my talks to programmers who are happy with only MBP 13\" (without external display) are programming HTML, Terminal/console shell scripter types. The others who develop apps for iOS tend to either have an MBP 15\" or MBP 13\" with an external display.\n\nA: I recently switched to a 13 inch retina MBP from a 27 inch display. I regularly write Java  and C++ code, and don't really regret the change. It was a little hard at the beginning but now it's fine.\nWhat I miss in the 13 inch screen is (was) screen real state (i.e number of lines of code that you can visualize). However, when I really need more screen real state, I switch to the \"scaled\" mode (a feature of the retina MBP) and aim for more space (1680x1050, the characters are really small but you can fit a lot of content in the screen). \nWhat I miss when working on any other computer (despite a 27 inch display) is the retina resolution (the retina display ruins your experience with other displays). Crisper text really changes your life (specially if you write code/text). \n", "Q: How to copy message from pop-up window? Is there a way to copy text message in a pop-up window like this is possible on Windows machine by making pop-up window active and then pressing CTRL+C?\n\nA: Not that I know of, but you can access most text elements from the accessibility API.

Is it possible to force it to hibernate when the charge is at 5%?\nI have a Mid-2009 MacBook Pro with 683 load cycles and the latest SMC available (1.47f2)\n\nA: The SMC and device firmware control power management and I've not seen any parameters you can simply adjust to change the thresholds but clearly, Apple could program that and push an update if you had infinite money or influence.\nThat being said, it's quite easy to run a background command to log the battery levels to a file and parse that file. Whether you prefer python or perl or simpler shell commands would influence the solution you implement. \nSo yes, it is possible to program such a tool, but you'd need some basic scripting knowledge to implement a higher limit to enter hibernation. \n", "Q: Applescript dialog, Bash alias/function I'm trying to create a short alias for creating System dialogs from the Terminal. I tried to create a Bash function (since an alias didn't seem to take arguments) and add it to my .bash_profile, but it's failing me.\nMy latest attempt is:\ndialog() {\n    DIALOGVAR='tell app \"system events\" to display dialog \"'$@'\"'\n    CMD=\"osascript -e 'tell app \\\"system events\\\" to activate' -e '$DIALOGVAR'\"\n    $CMD\n}\n\nBut when I execute it via the Terminal, I get\n0:1: syntax error: A unknown token can’t go here. (-2740)\n\nEven though echo'ing the CMD variable gives me a properly formatted command:\nosascript -e 'tell app \"system events\" to activate' -e 'tell app \"system events\" to display dialog \"foo bar\"'\n\nPerhaps I'm doing something wrong, perhaps there's an easier way to achieve this. All I'm trying to do is to create an easy to execute command that displays dialogs.\nEDIT: Alternative attempt didn't lead to anything either. This one works for arguments without spaces, but fails for multiple arguments.\nsysdialog() {\n    osascript -e \"tell app \\\"system events\\\" to activate\" -e \"tell app \\\"system events\\\" to display dialog \\\"$@\\\"\"\n}\n\n\nA: You can use the run handler to pass arguments:\ndialog() {\n    osascript -e 'on run args\n    try\n    tell app \"SystemUIServer\" to display dialog (item 1 of args)\n    end\n    activate app (path to frontmost application as text)\n    end' \"$1\"\n}\n\nIf you want to call it like dialog a b (instead of dialog 'a b'), change $1 to $*.\nSystem Events quits automatically when it is not used, and there is a small delay when it is opened, so telling it to display the dialog would sometimes be slower.\nWithout the try block there would be an error if the user presses a cancel button. Without activate the previously focused window wouldn't get focus back when the dialog is closed.\nYou can use something like this to display text dialogs:\nanswer=$(osascript -e 'try\ntell app \"SystemUIServer\"\nset answer to text returned of (display dialog \"\" default answer \"\")\nend\nend\nactivate app (path to frontmost application as text)\nanswer' | tr '\\r' ' ')\n[ -z \"$answer\" ] && exit\n\n\nA: Try this;\n#!/bin/bash\ndialog() {\n  DIALOGVAR=$('tell app \"System Events\" to display dialog \"'$@'\"')\n  CMD=$(\"osascript -e 'tell application \\\"System Events\\\" to activate'\"; \"osascript -e '$DIALOGVAR'\")\n  $CMD\n  }\n\n", "Q: Macbook keyboard backlight doesn't work The keyboard of my Macbook Pro mid-2010 has stopped illuminating in low light.\nI checked my System Preferences of my Mountain Lion and there is no \"Automatically illuminate keyboard in low light\" at all.

Built-In, 512 MB\n\n(Crash report snipped for convenience)\nGraphical corruption\nI experience the same graphic artefacts (white noise) corruption overlayed on different UI elements like opened windows, the Finder icons in the Cmd+Tab list, background image,... like so: Screenshot\nFor corrupted windows, any action that issues a repainting cures the issue but the others (Finder icon, background image) stay (probably because they never repaint) until the computer is rebooted.\nBroken icons\nIn what is a persisting problem afterwards (even after rebooting), any template icons (or otherwise shader-processed-behind-the-scenes icons) disappear from places like status bar/toolbar/side-panels:\nToolbar area screenshot\nFor this last one, the usual tricks of creating a new user or reinstalling a prior version work in the beginning but the issue resurfaces later.\nSince I have FileVault turned on, I also can't seem to be able to boot into safe mode to flush the icon caches manually (same 25-30% stuck loading bar problem than described elsewhere).\nCleaning whatever other Caches folder I can find doesn't help either.\nNow, the interesting thing is that problem 1 and problem 3 are both circumvented with a simple action: running the application manually from a terminal (as in, not via open(1) i.e. not with launchd as the parent process).\nIn that case the icons renders perfectly and there is no weird OpenCL crash for the lifespan of that instance although it doesn't fix the problem for normally launched applications afterwards.\nAs I scouted the internet I couldn't find people with precisely the same set of issues so it could simply be that my machine is faulty but I'm posting here beforehand to see if anyone else has more ideas on how to diagnose the problem (and to provide a Google entry-point for it).\n\nA: I have just experienced the same problem. I noticed graphic artefacts on my desktop, but did not worry about it until Transmission failed to start. Couple of iterations later I restarted it from iTerm (thus bypassing launchd), and it worked. I shrugged shoulders and rebooted - now that was a mistake.\nPretty much all apps that use default MacOS windows rendering engine could not start, including Finder. This meant I could not start iTerm or Terminal either. The likes of Chrome, VLC, Sonos and iTunes, which use their own window renderer, worked. I got a very similar stacktrace all the time bar the last call - not strdup, but memmove, also from stdlib. Surprisingly enough, when I tried to log in as another user, everything still worked.\nI tried resetting SMC and PRAM to no avail. Then I rebooted in safe mode, in which rendering worked, and rebooted back to the normal mode. This helped. At least I can launch apps now - but Finder crashes and relaunches every now and then occasionally.\n", "Q: allow sudo to another user without password I want to be able to 'su' to a specific user, allowing me to run any command without a password being entered.\nFor example:\nIf my login were user1 and the user I want to 'su' to is user2:\nI would use the command:\nsu - user2\nbut then it prompts me with \nPassword:\n\nA: sudo can do just that for you :)\nIt needs a bit of configuration though, but once done you would only do this:\nsudo -u user2 -s\n\nAnd you would be logged in as user2 without entering a password.\nConfiguration\nTo configure sudo, you must edit its configuration file via: visudo. Note: this command will open the configuration using the vi text editor, if you are unconfortable with that, you need to set another editor (using export EDITOR=<command>) before executing the following line. Another command line editor sometimes regarded as easier is nano, so you would do export EDITOR=/usr/bin/nano. You usually need super user privilege for visudo:\nsudo visudo\n\nThis file is structured in different section, the aliases, then defaults and finally at the end you have the rules. This is where you need to add the new line. So you navigate at the end of the file and add this:\nuser1    ALL=(user2) NOPASSWD: /bin/bash\n\nYou can replace also /bin/bash by ALL and then you could launch any command as user2 without a password:  sudo -u user2 <command>.\nIf you want to be able to switch to any user just use\nuser1    ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/bash\n\nUpdate\nI have just seen your comment regarding Skype. You could consider adding Skype directly to the sudo's configuration file. I assume you have Skype installed in your Applications folder:\nuser1    ALL=(user2) NOPASSWD: /Applications/Skype.app/Contents/MacOS/Skype\n\nThen you would call from the terminal:\nsudo -u user2 /Applications/Skype.app/Contents/MacOS/Skype\n\n\nA: I would set up public/private ssh keys for the second account and store the key in the first account.\n\n\n*\n\n*Associating ssh public key with user account\nThen you could run a command like:\n ssh user@localhost -n /Applications/Skype.app/Contents/MacOS/Skype &\n\nYou'd still have the issues where Skype gets confused since two instances are running on one user account and files read/written by that program might conflict. It also might work well enough for your needs and you'd not need an iPod touch to run your second Skype instance.\n", "Q: Where is the EFI stored on the macbook and is it possible to restore a previous EFI firmware version? I recently upgraded my macbook pro 2008 (not unibody, running 10.6.8) to mountain lion. Directly after the upgrade finished the machine ran smoothly. But after a reboot it does not boot at all (no gray display, but noise from fan and hard drive) and does not react to any keyboard input (so no SMC/NVRAM/PRAM reset, no Target Mode no Recovery etc). After some research I came to the point that I could not do anything but giving to a apple for repair, but I am still curious to understand, which component could have failed when upgrading. \nSo the only possible component could be the EFI firmware, which is responsible for the pre boot sequence, and hence it must have been  damaged during an EFI upgrade, or is not compatible to my 3rd party ram, which worked perfectly in  snow leopard. \nI tried to reinstall the system by extracting the hard drive and reinstalling the system, but this did not change anything. So where is the EFI firmware stored and is it somehow possible to access it, with no running system, and then is it possible to restore an older version?\nUPDATE\nIt was not the RAM.\n\nA: If you can successfully start your Mac from a Mac OS X DVD take a look at this: http://pubmem.wordpress.com/2011/04/09/flash-efi-firmware-update-manually-on-a-macbook-51/, especially comment 54 and follow-ups.\nIt explains how to manually flash the EFI firmware:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the EFI Firmware update from Apple. This link lists EFI and SMC firmware updates. You will need the exact model identifier of your Mac.\n\n*Unpack the firmware pkg using unpkg. You will need access to a Mac for this, as unpkg only runs on OS X. You need the file with extension scap.\n\n*Start your Mac from a DVD and select Utilities>Terminal.\nNow comes the difficult part. You need to run this:\nsudo bless -mount / -firmware /path/to/your/firmware.scap\n\nIt is unclear to me whether / is the right path (as asked in comment 59) or if you can even access the internal harddisk when booting from a DVD. You may have to plug in an external drive and copy the scap file there... You will have to figure it out for yourself.\nAlternatively, you can try:\nsudo bless -device /dev/disk1 -firmware /path/to/your/firmware.scap\n\n\n*Restart. The Mac should flash the EFI firmware.\nDisclaimer: Be aware that I couldn't test any of this so I'm giving the following information as a hint in the hope that it is useful.\n\nA: To answer your question, on my macbook, the EFI is installed under \n/efi/EFI/APPLE/EXTENSIONS/Firmware.scap under my /dev/sda1 device.\nI'm using a linux live cd. I have mounted /dev/sda1\nHope that helps..\n", "Q: Change Web Sharing \"Sites\" folder to SkyDrive? I'm building a web site. There are three Macs that I commonly use for development, depending upon my location: an iMac in San Diego, and iMac in Vegas, and a MacBook Air in all other places. As I move from place to place, I have to copy the contents of the  \"[username]/Sites\" folder from machine to machine so I can get my work done. It would be nice if I could just keep a master copy of the site files in one place.\nSo I signed up for the free cloud-based Skydrive storage. The pointer to the storage lives at \"[username]/documents/SkyDrive\". Anything inside that folder syncs across all of my Macs. Which leads me to my question…\nHow can I change the path that local web hosting uses (on OSX 10.8.2) to point to my SkyDrive folder instead of the default \"[username]/sites\"?\nThe goal is that when I navigate to \"http://127.0.0.1/~[username]/index.html\", the built-in OSX web server will pull in the index.html file from a SkyDrive folder. Hope this makes sense.\nIt's important to note that I won't actually be attempting to run a production website off of SkyDrive. No external users will be using the site in this manner. This is just to make my development processes a bit easier.  \n\nA: Yes, you can change your web server's user-specific directory to point to another location within your home directory.  Be aware there are security implications when doing this – aim to understand what they are before you proceed.\nFirst, back up the configuration files mentioned below, then, use Terminal to edit the files as root; e.g. via sudo vi [filename].\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf, changing the UserDir value from 'Sites' to the new target folder within the home directory structure.  Note: This directive changes the Sites folder location for all users .. I'll assume there's just you and this is OK.\n\n*Edit the corresponding user-specific configuration file in /etc/apache2/users/[username].conf so the path mentioned in the Directory directive matches what you set above. This ensures the options that were originally being applied to your Sites folder will be applied to the new location.\n\n*Ensure permissions to the new folder (including directories leading to it) are permissive enough for the web server process to access.\n\n*Restart the apache web server; i.e. sudo apachectl restart\nThat should get it working.\n\nA: The simplest solution is to set up a symlink to your Skydrive-folder – this will save you a lot of time by avoiding the Apache-setup and such.\nCopy the contents of ~/Sites to your Skydrive-folder (~User/Documents/Skydrive/Sites). Then open Terminal and type in the following command:\nrm -rf ~/Sites\nln -s ~/Documents/Skydrive/Sites ~/Sites\n\nWarning: This will delete your ~/Sites folder and it's contents, make sure you have a copy!\nThis will reroute all attempts to access ~/Sites to ~/Documents/Skydrive/Sites. Repeat this on all your computers.\nI have used this for my games' savefiles, and it works like a charm!\n", "Q: Can photos taken with my iPhone (and Apple ID) stream to my husband's iPad (and Apple ID)? My husband and I have different Apple ID and iCloud photo stream.\nWhen I take photos on my iPhone, registered to my Apple ID, can I have them automatically uploaded to my husband's iPad 2 registered to his Apple ID?\n\nA: You could share a photo stream with him.  Here's a youtube tutorial on how to set it up.\n\nA: Apple's solution isn't actually the easiest for this.\nYes, you could share Photo Streams, but you have to push each picture you take to the shared stream. At that point, everyone that subscribes gets all the pictures you have pushed, but you are on the hook to push each picture since you can't just turn on every picture and have them all go to the share.\nI would recommend looking into dropbox which is designed to pull all photos and videos taken and place them in the cloud. \nBoth you and your husband could start with the same dropbox account - and if you didn't want to see his pictures, you could make two dropbox accounts and share your picture folder with his account and he would get all your pictures but you wouldn't get his.\nEither way, once you had set up the app and the account(s), you have only to open the dropbox app on your device once you've taken one/multiple pictures and they will start pushing to your private shared storage on Dropbox for your husband to see and use.\n\nA: Here is a video about sharing photos on the iPhone.\nhttp://youtu.be/r6EN0Uo2xtg\n\nA: No not automatically. \nYou could share Photo Streams, but you have to push each picture you take to the shared stream...every single time you want to share...without exception.\n", "Q: How do I stop Apple from offering me iTunes 11 as a software download in OS X I don't want to disable Apple software update, I just want to prevent myself from accidentally overwriting my iTunes 10 with a working Party Shuffle/iTunes DJ with the new iTunes 11. I have iTunes 11 at work, where it doesn't really matter what I've got installed because I can't play music during the day, and I've tried to come up with some combination of smart playlists that effectively duplicates iTunes DJ... but it doesn't work. The tools aren't there.\nSo, how do I do it, how do I selectively block updates for iTunes 11?\nEdit/Update: All the helpful answers here are no longer useful.\nDon't do it.

I've found a few websites like: http://www.unlockaniphone.org/\nbut I'm very cautious of the few blog posts that I have found and not sure if they are fake. \n\nA: You should be cautious and skeptical of most services that offer a \"factory unlock\" in my opinion.\nThe cellular carriers all maintain a database of phones that when iTunes asks - gets told to factory unlock the devices. Since that database is under their control and they have a business relationship with Apple, any entries that are placed in that database in a fraudulent manner could easily be found and reversed.\nYour money spent for the \"factory unlock\" might work if the sellers have a legitimate business relationship with the carriers and it's more trouble for the carrier to allow some people to bypass their paywall and policies, but my guess is most of these unlocks are shady to illegal and I'm surprised that the carriers don't periodically sweep the database for all active phones that should be carrier locked and are not and send a nasty letter to the owners and re-instate the factory locks.\nI'm not one to defend the carriers in general, but I can't see how they would continue to charge $500 or more for an unlocked phone only to allow people to spend $10 to accomplish the same feat. If they're going to roll over for $10 then you'd expect all unlocked phones to sell for that in a short period of time.\nSo - I'd say - pay the money if you are willing to risk it failing, but going into that transaction with your eyes open might be prudent.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro early 2011 16G Memory Upgrade I just purchased a Corsair 16GB Memory upgrade for my 2.4GHz 13\" MacBook Pro, but I have not been able to make it work.\nIf I put both modules together or one of the modules alone the Mac wont bootup! \nIf I put one of the old (original) 2G Memory modules and a new one the computer will work ok and will recognize the 10G memory.\nAny advise will be greatly appreciated. \nHector\n\nA: While not officially supported, 8GBx2 PC3-10600 modules should work fine. Did you try both the new ones individually with a current 2GB module? If so, I'm not sure there is an option other than getting replacement modules. You could try resetting the PRAM but that's a long-shot.\n\nA: Have you tried each of the two 8GB modules by itself?\nThe first thought that comes into my mind when you state that when you put in both modules it won't boot, and it only sometimes boots when you put in one of the new modules by itself is that you may have one good and one bad RAM module.\nTry booting with each of the new RAM modules by itself, if it boots with one but not with the other, then you should return the faulty module to your supplier and get a replacement.\n\nIf that's not your problem, I'm also a bit confused about which 13\" MacBook Pro you have: the information you give is a bit contradictory, as I don't find one labelled \"early 2011\" that has a 2.4GHz processor.\nAccording to Crucial, the 2.4 GHz 13\" Core 2 Duo Macbook Pro MC374LL/A (presumably from before 2011 when the \"early/late year\" designation started being used) only supports 8 GB of RAM.\nOn the other hand, Crucial states that the early 2011 13 inch model does support 16GB of RAM...but its CPU speed is 2.3GHz, not the 2.4GHz you specify: 2.3 GHz Core i7 Early-2011.\nIf instead you're mistaken about the \"early\" designation, you might have the 2.4GHz Core i5 Late-2011 , which according to Crucial also supports 16GB.\nIn summary, it seems that if the processor on your 13\" MacBook Pro is a Core i5 or Core i7, then you should be able to upgrade to 16GB, if it's the Core 2 Duo, then according to Crucial your maximum should be 8GB.\n", "Q: What steps are needed to create a new user from the command line? What commands (or script) can create a fully functional user account on Mountain Lion, running only from the command line via terminal or ssh.\nIt looks like an existing pair of answers might work, but I wondered if there were a short script or tool for creating fully functional user accounts on Mountain Lion?\n\nA: Here is a shell script I wrote at work to handle this as part of the NetInstall process (creating a local administrator account automatically during imaging process).\n#!/bin/sh\n. /etc/rc.common\ndscl . create /Users/administrator\ndscl . create /Users/administrator RealName \"Administrator Account\"\ndscl . create /Users/administrator hint \"Password Hint\"\ndscl . create /Users/administrator picture \"/Path/To/Picture.png\"\ndscl . passwd /Users/administrator thisistheaccountpassword\ndscl . create /Users/administrator UniqueID 501\ndscl . create /Users/administrator PrimaryGroupID 80\ndscl . create /Users/administrator UserShell /bin/bash\ndscl . create /Users/administrator NFSHomeDirectory /Users/administrator\ncp -R /System/Library/User\\ Template/English.lproj /Users/administrator\nchown -R administrator:staff /Users/administrator\n\nSome notes to mention:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have this saved as an executable \".sh\" file.\n\n*Since it executes during NetInstall it runs as root, and needs to run as root to work properly. You can also subtract the first two lines, add a \"sudo\" to the beginning of each subsequent line, and manually run these as individual commands in Terminal.\n\n*Modify UniqueID from 501 to a number that you will know is safe on all systems (501 is taken by the first account created on a Mac, generally something higher like 550 will probably be safe, depending on how many users you have on your system).\n\n*PrimaryGroupID of 80 creates an Admin user. Change to PrimaryGroupID of 20 to create a Standard user.\n\n*I've imaged well over 50 Macs this way with no issues. I use this account to run commands via SSH, to push out patches via ARD and to do local desk-side administration.\n\n\nA: I have some updates on the above answer.\ndscl / -append /Groups/admin GroupMembership newUserName\n\nThis command can used for making the user have Administrative access. If this command is not provided the user will automatically will be set as standard user.\ndscl . create /Users/newUserName PrimaryGroupID 80\n\nThis sets user's primary group id. 80 means admin  and 20 means staff.\nAnd setting to 20 will not make the user standard.

Could be that one drive affect the other thru your USB controller. Try to disconnect one of them and see it it gets better. If it doesent, swap them to see. If it gets better while one of them is disconnected I would limit the problem to be a faulty drive. \nYou could also try to check if some processes are accessing your drive.

I like the Storage Spaces feature in Windows 8/Windows Server 2012, but since I'm mostly working on Mac computers I would like to know if there are any Mac alternatives or equivalents.\n\nA: The short answer is not really. The more in-depth answer is that there's nothing directly comparable, but there are some alternatives worth looking at, depending on your needs.\nRAID\nThe most basic option is using software RAID (either through built-in OS X tools or third party software) to create a mirrored (RAID 1) or striped (RAID 0) volume out of multiple disks. This is pretty limited in its flexibility, and to my knowledge there's no software that supports RAID 5/6 on OS X.\nIf you have a Mac Pro, you could get a hardware RAID card, which offers more options in terms of RAID levels, but is still somewhat limited for expansion, as well as costly.\nExternal Units\nThe Drobo is somewhat popular for direct-attached storage. It provides   more flexibility in terms of mixing and matching capacities, but it has not always had the greatest reputation for performance.\nNAS\nUsing a NAS, whether a pre-packaged solution or a custom built one running some variety of Windows or *nix gives you greater flexibility in most cases, and over wired ethernet can be faster than a Drobo. It can get more complex, and you run into the limitations of networked drives — in particular, Time Machine isn't really built to deal with network drives (it can be done, but gets a bit jacky), but it can also give you the greatest control over your configuration and future expandability.\n", "Q: How can I disable the firewall on OS X after forgetting how I set it?

This less than 24 hrs after updating FYI. I'm really mad!\n\nA: The phone will charge even when the OS is powered down. Why not plug in your device and power it off (or wait for the battery to die and plug it in) and see.\nIf it won't charge after an OS update, you can be sure that there is a hardware issue with the charging circuitry. It's possible for a phone to get stuck in a loop where the CPU can take more power than a charger can provide, so the power cycle (or inevitable loss of battery power) could be needed to clear things and let it take a charge.\n", "Q: Random songs appearing in my iTunes music library after activating iTunes Match After enabling iTunes match, my library is cluttered with hundreds of tracks which I don't own / haven't downloaded.

I'm happy with the default Camera app, however every time I import photos to Picasa or email them or use them on a website or something they're improperly rotated. This is because the iPhone doesn't rotate the photo, it only saves rotation in metadata, and it is extremely annoying. So are there any good camera apps that actually rotate the photo (not just metadata) and saves photos to Photo-stream and saves photos and videos to the camera roll/Photos app? I'd even pay $1 or $2 if need be, but it has to save pictures to the same place that the default app does and has to rotate properly.\n\nA: If any I think ProCam might do this by default. There's no specific settings for where to do the rotation, but if I don't remember wrong it actually rotates the image. I'm not sure if the app is free or costs anything since I got it thru appoftheday for free. \nHave a try. If you want I can check it out further so you don't need to purchase the app?\nEdit:\nSorry to dissapoint you. Neither of the apps: ProCam, Awesomemize or Awesome Camera does this. I tested all of them by taking a photo upside down and mailing it to myself.

Deleting it and restarting fixed the problem.\n\nA: Had a very similar problem to this - updates stuck on the 'Checking for Updates' spinning icon.  Reboot failed to fix problem.\nBecause I am a newbie, much of what was said above seemed difficult, so I thought I'd just try the one thing I could actually find on my machine, which was to delete:\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate.pIist.plist\n\nThis step alone seemed to fix things for me.\n\nA: I had this problem and I quit the App Store, used Activity Monitor to kill the softwareupdated process, then restarted the App Store and I was able to download again.\n\nA: just go to store option and click on reload page\n\nA: An additional note to analyze App Store / software update problems is probably using the Console app or tail to have a look at \n/var/log/install.log\n\n", "Q: Installing Mountain Lion on multiple macs with one application install If I have downloaded Install OSX Mountain Lion application file from the Appstore, I can use it as an installer on multiple machines. \nAny idea for how many machines will this be valid? How apple verifies a valid install?\n\nA: Five.\nI wish I could give better answer, but I can't fully resolve the problem of Apple's differentiation between iTunes Store, Mac App Store, App Store and iBook Store.\nIf you read the following official document, Apple only talks about the iTunes Store when it comes to licensing and iTunes-authorized computers.\nMy understanding is that the same rules apply to all purchases made in any of these stores because the receipt via Email is always from do_not_reply@itunes.com - no matter if the purchase is an iOS App, a Mac App, or a a song...\n\nhttp://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/us/terms.html#APPS\nUSAGE RULES\n(ii) You shall be authorized to use iTunes Products on five iTunes-authorized devices at any time, except for Content Rentals (see below).\n\nSince you purchased Mountain Lion in the Mac App Store, it's an iTunes product which you can install on up to five Macs at the same time. I've installed Mountain Lion using the same self-made USB installer on three different Macs without problems.\n\nA: You can install Mountain Lion on any Mac you own:\n\nIf you've purchased OS X Lion or Mountain Lion from the Mac App Store,\n  you're allowed to install it on all of your personal authorized Macs.\n\n\"Authorized\" just means that you have to sign into the Mac App Store with the Apple ID you used to purchase Mountain Lion.\nThe instructions actually tell you to re-download the installer on each machine, but it works fine if you simply copy the installer from one machine to another (which makes sense since it's the same file either way). Maybe they want you to re-download it on each machine so they can track how many times you download/install it on your account? But they clearly state that you can install it on \"all\" of your machines, which implies there's no limit.\n", "Q: How can I force an iTunes Connect password reset? We've got an account at work that was setup by someone else in the past.  It controls our apps in the app store.  We'd like to make some changes, but do not know the password.  I've tried the \"Forgot your Apple ID/password\" thing, but am not getting anywhere.  \"security questions\" mode asks us things we don't know and the email authentication doesn't work (as in, we never receive the reset request at the account's e-mail address).  I've confirmed that e-mail method reset requests make it to our domain fine by doing it on my own account.  It just doesn't seem to work for this particular very important account (which I get forwarded to me, and have tested fine from other domains).\nIs it possible that the Apple ID e-mail address is different from the one that the reset requests are going to?  If so, what's the procedure to get that fixed?  Is there a specific department at Apple I should contact?\n\nA: Since you have shipping apps in the store, you will be able to call developer relations and begin the process to get things reset.\nhttps://developer.apple.com/contact/ and https://developer.apple.com/contact/phone.php\nEven consumer Apple ID have the ability to set a separate email address for emails about resetting the security questions and emailing administrative changes, so the account in question might very well be set up in that manner.\nWhile you are on the line, you can ask about setting up multiple accounts for your business so that several people are listed to do certain tasks for you.\n\nA: I was able to find another user here that still had access, so that they could add my account, from which I could make all required changes.\n", "Q: Messages shows wrong informations in the recent chats list For some contacts the preview in the recent chats list shows wrong informations.

I have a 3rd gen 32GB iPad with a 3G/LTE connectivity (and the latest software) and let me be clear from the start - the WiFi is working perfectly fine for me and I've had no problems with it whatsoever.\nThe problem is with my iPad causing quite a serious WiFi interference for some other devices on one WiFi network (at my friend's house). It happens only on this single WiFi network and I am 100% sure it is my iPad causing the problems.\nBasically, the moment my iPad connects to the WiFi several other devices connected to the network drop their WiFi connection. These are: a Samsung TV and 2 laptops (HP and Dell).\nWhat's interesting, there are several other devices that don't experience no such issues with the WiFi connection, e.g. a couple of iPhones, few other laptops and other mobile devices, including another 3rd gen iPad with 3G/LTE (similar to mine, just 16GB).\nIf I switch off the WiFi on my iPad and wait a minute or two, all the other devices resume normal WiFi connection.\nAny idea what could be causing such problems?\nI've already tried resetting network settings.\n\nA: I doubt highly that it is the iPad causing interference. What I could expect is that the base station at your friends place can't keep up with all the wireless devices at once. If the TV is using 802.11g as are the other devices that disappear and then your iPad using 802.11n then the base station might crap out. Have seen a few similar cases before.\nAdditionally some base stations have limitations, example older AirPort Expresses could manage 5 or 10 clients. Once an 11th device comes into the network then a device or two or more might be kicked out because of the DHCP TTL time out. Going static with your IP address won't fix this, only a better base station, eg. the newer Express or Extreme.\n\nA: I have had the same experience and today seems like I solved with the help of a friend of mine.  \nJust try to set static IP-address on other users, if they are used always in the same place. This solved my problem. I realized that if I power off the iPad, the WiFi on my desktop worked properly.  \n\nA: Do you have an HP printer with wifi?  I have an Office Jet Pro 8600.\nTurning off WiFi printing fixed the WiFi issue.\n\nA: Well I found the problem - your iPad saves every program in the background even after you have turned off and started the ipad again. So things like games that are connecting to facebook, youtube, your mail etc etc it all adds up. \nfirst time I checked I had about 40 programs running in the background - shut them all down and problem solved!\ndouble click the home button and swipe up to shut down a program\n\nA: Wifi trouble shooting (which I used to do for a living a few years ago) can be a little lengthy.\nThere are a few settings that may need to be adjusted and checked. The problem with wifi is that there is no physical way to stop any device from transmitting. One issue may be the device that you suspect is causing the noise is just not following wifi standards correctly (some apple devices I've seen do this and I've also talked to fellow PC wifi experts from aruba networks that have confirmed my suspicions that apple products just don't play nice with non apple products. At least from 2014 and before.). Basically there are a few settings you might want to check.\n\n\n*\n\n*Long and short preamble. Generally setting this to long will fix a large number of drop out issues.Long preamble will make your connection have a slightly longer ping time.. I doubt you'll notice really. I suggest you consult your wifi devices on how to check for this setting. These is no point in having a faster ping time if the connection keeps dropping out. recovering the connection from a drop out causes a much much longer ping time than not.\n\n*make sure every device is set to wireless N MODE. wireless G mode is prone to drop outs and won't handle as many simultaneous devices as gracefully as the updated N standard.\n\n*Have you got the newest/known working firmware on your wifi device? I've encountered a few devices over the last 5 or so years that have random drops caused by apple devices and bad firmware. I've just had to flash my cheap tenda w308R wifi router as a new house mate has an apple laptop and it keeps causing the router to revert back to wpa-psk mode and not wpa2-psk mode. You MUST SET wpa2-psk for wireless N mode other wise you'll only enjoy about 52mb/s rather than 120mbs or more. This was a bug with the tenda device how ever and as I've now flashed it it's stable again.\n\n*Try switching between Wireless N only and wireless N mixed mode. Usually wireless N only is the much much preferred mode as it will have less drops and be about 2 or 3 times faster etc. Don't forget you need WPA2-PSK to be set for security or this just won't work correctly. (it's in the wireless N specs)\n\n*Turn off all wifi power saving modes. If the wifi device is a usb device then also turn off any USB power saving modes. If this fixes your problem then it's the operating system/device drivers misbehaving and causing your drops. Not much you can do there except update the software and see if it fixes it.\n\n*If turning off the power saving modes don't work then try setting the max transmit power settings a little lower and see if that helps. some times a wifi device may sent a too strong signal and that actually may cause interference. I usually find this is rare though.\n\n*Try another version of your wifi driver software. even if it's an older version it might fix the issue. A few years ago I had about 3 drivers from realtek cause wifi drops. After reverting back a few versions the issue just didn't come back. I tried upgrading back to the newer versions and the problem was back. luckily they fixed that issue in a further 6months after that was an issue. So not every upgrade is a good upgrade.\nWell. that's most of the tricks you can try.\n\nA: f you have a dual band router then set the ipad to use the 5GHz band, this worked for me.\nMy Ubuntu laptop with a RTL8192EE wireless device driver does not support use of the 5Ghz band and whenever the ipad was in use with the 2.4GHz wifi signal the laptop lost wifi connectivity or ran extremely slowly and then lost connectivity.\nThis was repeatable and confirms that the ipad (air 2) does not play nicely with another wifi device using the same 2.4GHz router signal.\n", "Q: Is it possible to download Apple's Command Line Tools for Xcode from the command line? Background\nMy job gives me temporary MacBook Pros for travel purposes. I get them with a fresh OS install before I leave, and when I return, they blank the hard drive. The trips usually require some sort of development work, which means I'd prefer to install my entire development stack on the machine, but doing so every time would be tedious and a waste of time. I'd like to write a script that does all of the installation for me.\nQuestion\nThe big issue I've run into is having to download the Xcode command line tools. For the time being, I can stash the DMG in my Dropbox or some sort of privately accessible cloud storage. I was wondering, however: is there a way to download these tools from Apple in a scriptable fashion? The main obstacle seems to be logging into Apple's Developer site. If I could download the DMG from Apple in a way that only required me to type in my ID and password from the command line, that would be great (or even better, download it without a password).\nFrom searching around, it seems like there may exist URLs for the command line tools that may allow me to download them from the command line. (see, for instance: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9329243/xcode-4-4-command-line-tools)\n\nA: Apple now includes the xcode-select binary in OS X itself, so you have a one line solution that presents a graphical authorization window and then downloads and installs the current version of the tools.\nxcode-select --install\n\n\nA: Install wget and if you are running osx 10.8.5 usable keychain scripting for lion:\nhttp://www.red-sweater.com/blog/2035/usable-keychain-scripting-for-lion\nPass your developer username and password to wget via \"usable keychain scripting\".\n", "Q: How can I determine if a certain .app file is signed Get Info on an .app does not produce the signature information. On Windows for example, right-click > properties will expose who signed the file.\nHow do I obtain that info for a given .app on OS X? \n\nA: You can check a file by issuing the following command in Terminal:\n codesign -dv /Applications/Whatever.app\n\nThere is a free tool that implements the functions of the codesign command and extends it with a nice GUI. It's called RB App Checker (on the App Store) as well as a site describing the program http://brockerhoff.net/RB/AppCheckerLite/\nI've not needed anything but these two tools for checking code signing on OS X so hopefully they fit your needs. Do check out the AppChecker if your Mac doesn't have codesign (some older ones needed Xcode to get that tool before gatekeeper shipped).\nAs to how you would know, the OS will show untrusted apps as dim and with a generic icon until the gatekeeper process approves a bundle to run - but that code could still be signed so you can't rely on a visual clue to necessarily tell if some code has or has not been signed - especially considering that gatekeeper could be disabled on a given Mac.\n", "Q: MAMP Pro failing to launch (mysql) Issue:\nI try to launch MAMP Pro, enter my system password then it sits there trying to connect to MySQL.

MySQL was running but Apache couldn't launch. Also, although I could change the settings on the MAMP interface, none would save. looking at permissions and ownership, the app and files were owned by root (but not sure that had any refection on the issue).\n@bassplayer7 gave me pointers to the uninstaller (something I didn't know existed), which due to permissions couldn't actually do anything. So I found these excellent instructions:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/11855247/mamp-pro-restore-root-user-uninstall\nWhich cleaned it off completely.\nI then did a system restart, re-installed MAMP Pro completely fresh, and it all worked first time.

Does anyone know a comprehensive Mac app to create SQL Diagramms?\nI think http://ondras.zarovi.cz/sql/demo/ is quite good, but it's a little bit too basic.\nI would like to create the database schema, the relations between the tables (including labels for e.g. n:m relations), add comments, export to SQL, and so on to run from my Mac.\n\nA: The only Mac only tool I know (and I would love to hear of others here) is SQLEditor. Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be any support for Stored Procedures or other objects beyond tables and views.\nThere are also cross-platform solutions (mostly Java-based). In a recent search I evaluated DBWrench and DBVisualizer. When all was said and done, I decided to stay with a Windows solution running under Parallels.\n\nA: MySQL Workbench is great, though I found that in a lot of cases OmniGraffle works wonderful, especially if you're not so much into \"doing it painfully correct according to theory learnt at university\" but rather getting the job done.\n\nA: You might want to check out the Navicat line of products. I use Navicat Premium and it's a really great all-in-one tool for many DBs, including MySQL, Postgres, SQLITE, Oracle, and MS SQL Server. It includes a Model tab where you can view and edit existing DBs or create de novo ones, sketch everything out, define relationships, export SQL, have access to an auto-layout function, and all sorts of other goodies.\nThere are several versions stepping up to the Premium product, including a separate Data Modeler program, so you'll have to browse around to see what fits your needs. It will set you back a little bit of cash, depending on the version, but you can download a 30-day free trial to make sure it's what you need.\nI hope this helps!\n\nA: The free SQL tool of choice for me is SQuirreLSQL. It is a Java application, but very responsive, and you can install both DB drivers and plugins from it, and one of them allows for reverse-engineering and diagramming databases.\nAqua Data Studio runs on Mac OS X as a mixed Cocoa/Java application, with native performance, and includes Entity-Relationship modeling capabilities.\n\nA: I also use Vertabelo and I can recommend it, too. It is 100% web-based. You can work on your models either in Chrome, or in Safari (the support for Safari browser was added a few month ago). Vertabelo's graphical tools for designing database models are simply amazing! Simple and intuitive, and yet very comprehensive and professional. There's no desktop license, no downloads and no installation. You can work remotely from any computer connected to the web. If you would like to get to know how Vertabelo works, you can try it without any registration: https://my.vertabelo.com/try\n\nA: DBSchema is also awesome. Best thing is that you can do reverse engineering as well as modeling together at once. After you change the diagram, you change the database; you can import those changes back in the diagram.\nThe only flaw is ordering of column names in the diagrams - that do not necessarily match with the ordinality of the column names in the real database if you do so.\nI would rate it to be one of the super nice applications.\n\nA: MySQL Workbench is good enough for most programming demands. You can create EER Model and can also synchronize the model with DB Changes or vice versa. You can use it with no cost as it's a open-source application. I have been using MySQL for a year and it is very useful for me. I recommend it to you if you don't need any enterprise features and performance.\n\nA: Check out http://www.yworks.com/en/index.html, might not be what you are looking for but it has ER modelling and others...\n\nA: I recommend Vertabelo. Vertabelo is an online database designer working under Chrome developed by company I work for.\nThe most important feature of this tool is that it allow to share database models across the team and collaborate on them via web browser.\nOthers Vertabelo features include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Model versioning\n\n*Support for PosgreSql, MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server, DB2, SQLite, HSQLDB\n\n*Dynamic/Visual search\n\n*Live database model validation\n\n*Reverse engineering \n\n\nVertabelo is free to use for smaller projects (up to 3 models and 20 tables within each model) and have commercial versions for larger database projects. \n\nA: My preferred tool for modeling in OS X, is Visual Paradigm (VP-UML). They have a free community edition, which is great for creating ERD - but if you want to generate the DDL from your ERD, you'll need to purchase the standard edition.\nIt's also cross-platform, so that's another boon.\n\nA: DBeaver, which is open source, does a good job of making ER diagrams and can connect to just about every database backend. It’s also a decent database viewer/editor.\n\n", "Q: Can you send a message across the network?

So long as the 105 degree Tj Max point is not passed the computer keeps up with whatever game you're playing just fine. \nMy understanding is that under OS X I can use the smcFanControl app to manually specify the fan RPMs, but I have not been able to find a similar way to control or fix the fan speed once I am booted into Windows. When I did this sort of experimenting on my Macbook Air there seemed to be a method which involved setting the desired setting in smcFanControl in OS X and then sometimes rebooting into windows would have the setting stick. This would basically get the job done if it works on the rMBP as well, but I'd prefer something friendlier. \nAre there any fan control applications for Windows that will recognize and allow control of the Macbook Pro fans? \n\nA: You need to use an external application to control fan speed in an smart way. \"Lubbo's MacBook Pro Fan Control\" is the best option to use:\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/lubbofancontrol/\nDon't forget, in order to have smart control on fans speed, just change the value of \"CPU Key\" to \"TC0F\". Then restart the application.\nPlace a shortcut of this application on your Windows startup and that's all!\nYour Mac will stay cool and keep running even under heavy loads.\n\nA: I wonder why noone mentioned wonderful and free Macs Fan Control app that works flawlessly on Windows. All mac hardware support is declared, OS X version is also available.\n\nA: So I went with the lubbo fancontrol and changed the config option as suggested above.\nI'm running windows 7 pro on my macbook pro retina late 2012, 2.6 i7.\nOne thing you can do regardless of an extra fan controller is drop the CPU power.\nGo to Power Options > Change plan settings (starting from Balanced) > Change Advanced power settings. \nThen in the Power Options popup window, I went to: Processor power management > Maximum processor state, and set my On battery and Plugged in percentages to 90%.\nGot a bout a 20 deg C drop in temperature.

Something went wrong, and after the upgrade I needed to use an iCloud backup to restore the iPad. \nAlthough almost all my apps came back, one is missing (it would have been in the backup). It was a simple, free color learning app, but one that meant a lot to my kids. The name was very generic, so I can't find it with Google or App Store search. I tried the  \"purchased\" tabs on each of my accounts in the App Store, and it isn't there.\nHow do I find the app, or what happened with it? Could it be missing from the \"purchased tab\" because it is incompatible with ios6?\n\nA: New iOS versions never break compatibility with older apps. You could try viewing your purchases in iTunes on your computer. This could be fruitful as the app may have been hidden — to check, go to your account details page (in iTunes) and select \"View Hidden Purchases.\"\nAlso, consider the possibility that it was downloaded with an Apple ID you haven't thought of. If you're certain it's not on the iPad, you can't find it under Purchased, and neither you nor your kids can remember its name, then it may have been pulled from the App Store. This isn't very likely, though.\n\nA: It looks like the app was pulled from the App Store for some reason. Based on information from the Stack Overflow question What happens to my apps after my developer account membership expires?, if a developer stops subscribing to the developer program, their apps are pulled from the App Store, even if they've been paid for by a user. Which means that users should back up any apps that are important to them, especially if they are from smaller developers.\nFortunately I had backed my iPad up, I was able to restore the .ipa file from a backup on another machine using iTunes.\n", "Q: OSX multi-user remote login w/ GUI I would like to give some restricted access to my OSX 10.8.2 to somebody who's using Windows on their computer.

Battery and Charger are working fine also resetting the SMC is not helping.\n\nA: I Had the same and managed to fix it using this reference:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/22024754#22024754\nIn summary, this is the fix:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Disconnect power\n  \n*Open MBP and disconnect/remove the battery - close the back cover again\n  \n*While power is still disconnected, press and hold the power button for about 5 seconds and then while pressing and holding the power button, connect the power cable to the MBP.\n  \n*If you are lucky, your MBP will now power up with the fans blazing at 100% and keyboard backlight will be off.  This seems to be a recovery emergency mode or something.  If you MBP did not power up, try again. If your MBP does not power up then you have a different problem and don’t need to continue the following steps.\n  \n*Boot you OSX and go onto the Internet and Download the right SMC firmware version for your MBP from: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1237\n  \n*Mount/Open the .dmg file and copy out the “Firmware” .pkg file.\n  \n*Use Pacifist or the command line to extract the content of the .pkg file.\n  In my case the Apple SMC update had three models firmware in  the .pkg file and the correct one for the Mid-2010 15” model was in the folder SMC18 or something.  \n  \n*Find your correct model firmware for your MBP and copy out the following two files:  SmcFlasher.efi and 2010MBP15.smc  (the 2010MBP15.smc will be different for other MBP models)\n  \n*Copy those two files onto the OSX disk drive to a location that you can remember like /User/username/Dowloads/smc  or where ever.\n  \n*Google and search for rEFIt .  This is a boot loader app the will take over the boot process when you start up your MBP to enable you to go into a shell utility.  Read up on how to install and how to activate the refit utility.  When installed and enabled, the next time you reboot your MBP you will see the utility start up before your OSX boots.\n  \n*If you see the rEFIt utility start after you rebooted the MBP, use the arrow on your keyboard and select shell and press enter.  The shell.efi utility will start to boot in a “DOS” like window and after you see something where it wants to configure or setup something, just press ESC to cancel that.\n  \n*After the util booted, you need to first change to your internel disk with the command fs1:  that is F S ONE Colon then Enter, standing for filesystem 1\n  \n*Now you can change to the folder to where you copied the two firmware files like: \n  \n*\n  \n*cd Users\n  \n*cd username\n  \n*cd Downloads\n  \n*cd smc\n  \n  \n*There are different ways of going to the folder or find the place where you put the files.\n  \n*After finding the folder with the two files you can start the update process.\n  \n*First need to get the SMC into the right state\n  SmcFlasher.efi -reset 1\n  \n*Your MBP fans should now quiet down.\n  Lets Flash :-)\n  SmcFlasher.efi -force -LoadApp 2010MBP15.smc -norestart\nYour SMC should now be flashing with the right version.

Some days ago Apple refreshed the MacBooks pro and I'm looking for either well sourced reviews of the hardware capabilities between the models or real world experience to help me value the increased cost of the i7 (3.0 GHz) over the i5 (2.6 GHz) on the new Macbook Pro 13\" with retina display (ME662LL/A which presumably will be marketed as an early 2013 model).\nI've done some research on Intel's site and, by my reckoning, the CPU release dates / frequencies imply Apple is using 2 possible CPU for the new 13 inch with Retina that ships with 256 GB of storage (which like the CPU can also be upgraded for additional cost). \nCan someone confirm/corroborate that the i5-3230M and i7-3540M are used so that I can rely on Intel's description of the chips or are there other factors at play with Apple hardware. It seems like the GPU of the i7 support higher frequency & the i7 has more virtualization features.\nAs a regular user of virtualization, does this CPU upgrade offer benefits for VM performance past the incremental change in clock speeds (Intel's VT-d feature sounds good, but I don't understand if it helps existing Mac virtualization software run better or faster)?\nI realize no one can make buying decisions, but hoped to learn more about how the hardware works so we all can learn more about what goes on under the hood of this model Mac.\n\nA: So there are a bunch of comments about the merit of the question which it seems you e taken the time to look at and assess. I'll jump right in to starting the discussion on upgrading. \nFirstly, to be clear you're looking at a new early 2015 13\" MBP (I assume you're not interested in a 15\", which can support quad core processors and add a whole new layer to the discussion). \nApple's tech specs can be hard to track down, but it looks to me like you got the same processors I did. The i7 supports a turbo up to 3.1 GHz and 4 MB of cache, with the i5s boasting 2.1 and 2.7 GHz processors and 3 MB of cache. You're right in that the i7 supports VT-d, but you'll need some fairly heavy duty software to take advantage of it. The answer about VT-d is that it really depends what sort of virtualization software you're using, my guess being that unless you want to use expensive commercial software, Oracle's VirtualBox will be the first to support that (though I have no reason to expect this, or know when). \nThis brings us to the next level: is the i7 worth it over the i5 (will there be notable performance gains)? For you (and others with this question), probably. The increased cache, better cache coherency, and outright speed increase will be what you notice. Being that all the processors for the 13\" are dual core, I was unable to find evidence that there is any significant difference between hyper threading moving up and down Intel's CPU line (unlikely, they all use the same basic core). \n\nA: Apple systems do not support VT-d, except for Xserve and Mac Pro, at least to my knowledge. This is a framework typically used by hypervisor virtualization platforms. However, the Macs can generally take advantage of VT-x, and is part of why they run x64 VMs so well. There is no way to configure either system in EFI, as Apple locks this part of the firmware down pretty well.\nThe feature that might benefit you the most is the hyper-threading that i7 affords.\n", "Q: Making Desktop 2 in Mountain Lion be shown in external display Is it possible to display Desktop 2 (Mountain Lion) in an external display?\nThe thing is I want to use Full Screen applications in an external display while using my Laptop display for non-full-screen applications.\nWith the Mirror Display unchecked, when I drag an application to the external display and set it to full screen, my laptop display goes black.\n\nA: I have been using an external display for a little while and was confused about this to begin with.  I think it happens when you have a particular window on full screen.  That is to say that it is the extended display version of having a single window to the fore.  I started dragging windows to size manually and it stopped happening.\n", "Q: Require login for Single User mode? Is there a way to require a password to login to single user mode? I don't want to use a firmware password, because that will not only disable single user mode, but also Startup Manager (which I use to boot from a USB). I don't like the idea of anyone with physical access to my computer having more privileges than my user does.\nI'd simply like to have it ask for the root password before logging in as root, or ask for any username and password, and log them in normally. Is there a way to do this?\n\nA: The following article may help your problem. :)\nMac OS X: Require Password at Single User Mode:\n\nBy default, Mac OS X will simply give you a shell when you perform a Single User Mode startup.  However, you can force OS X to ask for a password in order to gain shell access.  To do so, vi the /etc/ttys and change secure to insecure.  Once you have done so, create a password in /etc/master.passwd for root.\n\n\nA: An alternate solution that will in effect disable Single-User Mode without using an EFI password...\nI edited /var/root/.profile and added the command \n\nshutdown -r now\n\nWhen the machine boots into SUM, this script runs and the machine restarts.

After opening 128, I can no longer open new ones, or open new tabs in Terminal. The error messages is:\nforkpty: Device not configured\nCould not create a new process and open a pseudo-tty.\n\nIs there any way I can increase the number of ptys?\n\nA: (Tested on OS X 10.8.2; other releases may be slightly different.)\nYou can change the system’s limit on ptys with the sysctl command.\nsudo sysctl -w kern.tty.ptmx_max=255\n\nThis should immediately let you open more ptys.\nTo set this automatically after each reboot, put the following line in the /etc/sysctl.conf file:\nkern.tty.ptmx_max=255\n\n(Note: I did not try this, but, from a look at the source code, it looks like launchd does process this file.)\nThis file may not exist; if you have to create it, you should probably be sure it has restricted ownership and permissions:\nsudo chown root:wheel /etc/sysctl.conf\nsudo chmod 644 /etc/sysctl.conf\n\n\nEventually, you may run into some other per-process or per-user resource limits (e.g. total number of processes per user, and total number of open file descriptors per process).\n\nA: I had new terminal windows failing with\n[forkpty: Too many open files]\n[Could not create a new process and open a pseudo-tty.]\n\neven though I had kern.tty.ptmx_max: 511 (the default setting for my computer running Catalina with 64 GiB memory). I also had kern.maxfilesperproc: 98304 so I knew it was not that limit, either.\nI thought it might be ulimit since ulimit -n was 256, but discounted that because lsof -c Terminal | wc was 315, well over 256. Turns out it was ulimit but lsof lists more files than ulimit limits. I will skip the explanation, but what you want to look at is\nlsof -X -c Terminal | wc\n\nThe -X limits lsof to showing just file descriptors, which what ulimit limits. That was 257 (the 256 limit, plus a header line in the lsof output).\nSo, in addition to the 2 sysctl settings, I needed to adjust the default ulimit with launchctl. That turns out to be harder than you would expect.\nThe command to use to view the ulimit soft and hard limits on the number of open files is launchctl limit maxfiles which on my computer output\nmaxfiles    256           unlimited\n\nThe command to change the limits is launchctl limit maxfiles <softlimit> <hardlimit> but you cannot set the hard limit to \"unlimited\" because the kernel converts \"unlimited\" to 10240. If you leave out the hard limit, it is set to the same as the soft limit, which is even worse. So what I did was use the value from sysctl kern.maxfilesperproc as the hard limit. I ran\nsudo launchctl limit maxfiles 1001 98304\n\nWell, that took care of ulimit, but unfortunately, it also reset the kernel parameters:\nkern.maxfiles: 98304\nkern.maxfilesperproc: 1001\n\nwhich is definitely not what I wanted. I wanted the soft limit to change the default ulimit and the hard limit to change kern.maxfilesperproc but instead the soft limit changed kern.maxfilesperproc and the hard limit changed kern.maxfiles. So I ran it again, restoring the previous values from the kernel\nsudo launchctl limit maxfiles 98304 196608\n\nThis sets the ulimit way too high, but I think that is better than setting the kernel limit too low.\nThese changes also do not persist after reboot. To get them to persist, now that /etc/launchd.conf no longer works, consider these solutions for persisting a single setting or restoring the launchd.conf behavior.\n", "Q: Can I connect to my Mac via thin client?

It's clearly capable of going from sleep to hibernate when the battery runs low, but I haven't been able to find out if that behavior can be triggered by anything else. \nBackground: I need to use Filevault encryption, and my understanding is that it doesn't provide much protection if the computer is stolen while in normal sleep mode. To remedy this I've set it to hibernate instead of sleeping and enabled the DestroyFVKeyOnStandby option. But this is very inconvenient when I just want to put it on standby for a few minutes (e.g., put it in my bag, walk to a meeting upstairs, open it back up). \n\nA: Retina MacBook Pros and newer MacBook Airs actually do that by default under certain conditions. If Power Nap is disabled, the computer is on battery power, not connected to USB devices and not paired with Bluetooth devices, it enters standby mode (hibernation) after about 70 minutes of normal sleep.\nIf pmset -g | grep standby looks like this, your computer supports standby mode:\n standby              1\n standbydelay         4200\n\nYou can change the delay to 15 minutes with sudo pmset -b standbydelay 900.\n", "Q: How do I enable a standard account to SSH in?

Now I would like to add about 100GB to the FAT partition. \nI am using the Disk Utility but now it says \"this partition can't be modified\" (for both partitions). Is there a way to shrink one and expand the other?\n\n\nA: Disk Utility doesn't resize FAT or ExFAT partitions on the fly, so you will need to take that drive to a Windows or UNIX computer or use another tool to resize FAT.\nIf you only have Disk Utility, I would create a dmg of the FAT partition and save it to the main partition.\nThen you could delete the FAT partition, resize the HFS partition and recreate the new FAT section to your preference.\nAt that point you would choose the restore tab to place the contents from the disk image (.dmg file) onto the properly sized, but empty FAT volume.\n\n", "Q: How to create playlist from Up next songs in iTunes?

I have File Vault 2 full-disk encryption enabled on my 2012 MacBook Air running Mountain Lion.  By default it also has a \"Guest\" Safari-only account available.  I just tried it the other day and found that it requires no password to boot the system and run Safari.\nTo my untutored eye, this seems like a major security risk to the full-disk encryption.  It could be a back door to obtaining the key to decrypting the entire disk.  Prior to this, I was under the impression that the disk could only be decrypted if you have a password or a recovery key.  If this back door is really there, then I could imagine someone taking the SSD out of the Mac and reconstructing the process used by the Guest account to obtain the key to decrypt the disk without a password or recovery key.\nSo my question is: is this the risk that I perceive it might be?  Or is there perhaps a separate bootable operating system on a small part of the disk with its own encryption key just for the Guest Safari access?\nIf it is the risk I think it is, then how do I kill the Guest access?  When killing it, how do I know that it has removed all remnants of the exposure of the decryption key for the full disk?\nI see from other questions that in Lion it was not possible to create such a Guest account with File Vault 2 on, but now in Mountain Lion it is there by default.  Perhaps Apple has in fact made the Guest account secure.  Or perhaps they left a back door open.  I can't find anything about this particular question with respect to Mountain Lion in the Apple knowledge base.\n\nA: No, it's not. Some say it's a benefit if you have geo-location and remote wipe configured (or other similar software) as it increases the chance that someone finding the Mac will connect it to the Internet.\nWhat's happening is that you also have Find My Mac on. That enables a Safari-only guest account which will allow users to log in and run Safari. The goal is that if someone steals your laptop, they might log into the guest account and give Find My Mac a chance to phone home.\nThe Safari-only guest account uses the unencrypted recovery partition to launch Safari. It does not decrypt your FileVault area at all, so your data remains safe.\n(I've found an Apple knowledge base article confirming this.)\n", "Q: Parental filter which blocks Tarot and other Black magic I am searching for a closed source or open source (MacPorts) internet filtering which blocks Black magic (for example Tarot) web sites.\nVery important that this also works with Russian language (example Google query)\nBackground info: my customer is a Catholic single mom.\n\nA: In my home, we use a combination of:\n\n\n*\n\n*OpenDNS filtering.\n\n*Locking down the devices so that the end user cannot change the Internet settings, specifically DNS.\n\n*The Mobicip browser, which has a free version, but for advanced features such as specific site filtering, costs $9.99 annually.\n\n\nI don't specifically filter Black Magic, but there are other things I do block, and these tools allow me to have control over what gets into my network via the Internet.\n", "Q: How can I be sure that Mac chat applications like Adium won't leak my Gmail, iCloud, AIM, or other account/password credentials?

How can I be reasonably sure that entering this information in the app(s) is secure? I am concerned that the apps may be forwarding my account credentials to unknown or malicious locations.\n\nA: As a rule, unless you've reviewed the full source code of an application yourself, you have to trust the developer(s) of the application that they're not going to misuse your login credentials.\nDepending on your level of concern, you might set up a separate, dedicated Gmail account / login, exclusively for use with GTalk and related services. \nI'm uncertain how Adium's network protocol operates, but if it uses well-known servers and ports, you could also use LittleSnitch to inspect and approve outgoing network connections from Adium, to be sure that it is communicating only with places it's supposed to communicate with, i.e. official GTalk servers. (LittleSnitch inspection is only feasible with well-known servers, not with peer-to-peer based services.)\n", "Q: Disabling Hibernation AND DeepSleep mode on Retina Macbook Pro reduce battery life?

At least assuming you have OS X 10.9 Mavericks, it has a new Energy tab (in addition to the usual CPU, Memory, etc.) where you can see which apps are contributing the most to energy usage. And of course, there might be some hidden process consuming a lot of CPU time.\nAlso, it looks like your MacBook Pro has dual GPUs (Intel + Nvidia). Since you connected an external display, it's probably using the Nvidia GPU. In my experience this translates to a huge increase in power usage, so it wouldn't be unusual to have only 2h  of battery remaining. Even without an external display connected, some other app might be forcing a switch to the power-hungry Nvidia graphics; there's an app called gfxCardStatus which indicates which GPU is currently in use, and if it's the Nvidia one, which apps are to blame for activating it.\n", "Q: How do I re-enable the touchscreen on my iPhone after I've disabled it? I have mistakenly disabled the touch screen of my iPhone 4S and now I cannot re-enable it. \nIs there some method I can use to re-enable the touch screen on my device?\n\nA: I can only assume you disabled touch input by starting Guided Access. To leave Guided Access, quickly push the Home button 3 times in a row. You will be prompted for your passcode, after which you can turn off Guided Access by pushing the End button.\nMore info on Guided Access in this support article.\n\nA: Try the following methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try the Siri command \"Enable the touchscreen.\"\n\n*\n\n*Hold down your Home button until you hear the tone associated with Siri.\n\n*Clearly speak \"Enable the touchscreen\" into the microphone.\n\n\n*Clean the screen with a clean, lint-free cloth.

I'm trying to access an internal website to view CCTV cameras with an iPad. It will only show the desktop version. I want it to show the mobile version, as it serves the camera streams in JPEG as opposed to the desktop version which uses ActiveX (which obviously doesn't work on an iPad). An iPhone views the mobile version and it works fine. \nI know on Android tablets there is an option to \"Request desktop site\" and when unchecked will fetch the mobile version. I couldn't find anything within safari or in settings.\nHow might I get the iPad to be seen as an iPhone and retrieve the mobile layout of the CCTV web page?\n\nA: In the URL, instead if \"www\" you can type \"m\".\nFor example, http://m.google.com/\n**This does not apply to some websites.\n\nA: This ultimately depends on how the website was set up. If they are using \"user-sniffing\" to determine which version of a webpage to serve you, then it might be possible to workaround (this method uses the user agent of the device that you are on to determine which version of a page to display).\nThey can delimit which devices get served which versions of a particular web page at server level. One way is to use the same URL and just serve up a different version of the same web page. The other way is to redirect you to a different URL (m.yourcompany.com vs. www.yourcompany.com).\nChances are the best way to get around this would be to install an app that allows you to spoof the user agent. It looks like the full version of Atomic Web should allow you to do this (although I haven't tested it personally).\nYou could always try out Opera, Mercury and vBrowse, if Atomic Web doesn't work for you. However, I think these browsers likely won't work.\n\nFor completeness, there is always a possibility they have used an approach called responsive design, and if this is the case there is nothing you can do to remedy the problem. Responsive design serves the same page, but uses CSS to organize it differently based on your screen size (And it can hide some content and display other content). Based off of your situation, however, this approach is highly unlikely to have been used.\n\nA: On your iPadOS device, Open Settings > Safari > Request Desktop Sites > Turn Off\n\nA: I believe that if you use Chrome on iOS, the \"Request desktop site\" option is also available (with the same implication if its unchecked). That does require using Chrome, of course.\n\nA: Look for a browser in the App Store that supports user agent faking. I believe Atomic does. (You could also jailbreak and use the UserAgentFaker tweak if you want to stick to using Safari or another browser that doesn't support user agent faking.) Then, set the browser to use an iPhone user agent, such as this one:\n\nMozilla/5.0 (iPhone; U; CPU like Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/420+ (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.0 Mobile/1A543a Safari/419.3\n\n", "Q: How do I unfreeze my iPod Nano 4th Gen? tl;dr -- My iPod hangs on the boot screen (black background, silver apple logo). When I try to restore it (on both my Virtual Windows XP and on a Mac laptop), it'll restore fine, but when it reboots the iPod, the iPod'll hang on the apple logo screen, just like before.\n\nUpdate: I've booted a Windows XP virtualbox, and have the latest iTunes running on it. Whenever I tell iTunes to restore it (while my iPod is in disk mode, since that's the only way it is recognized), it'll download the software, restore my iPod, then say that the iPod is rebooting and that I need to make sure it stays connected.\nHowever, once it boots, it still hangs on the apple logo, and isn't recognized by the computer (host or guest). If I boot it into disk mode, it is recognized, and iTunes shows the \"Welcome to your new iPod\" screen; the iPod is wiped, and presumably installed the new software.\n\nI've searched and searched for an answer, and although I've found numerous posts on other sites similar to my problem, most of them haven't worked for me.\nBasically, what's happened is about half a year ago, my iPod would occasionally freeze, and I could solve the issue by restarting it (Menu+Select); about late November last year, however, my iPod froze on the boot screen (black screen with apple logo), and since then I haven't been able to do anything - it just hangs on that screen until it completely drains the battery. My problem is similar to the one in this video.\n\nIs there a way I can fix my iPod Nano 4th Gen?\nAlso, I'd prefer if I could do it without iTunes, since I'm running Ubuntu and Wine has spotty iTunes support, but I can run a VirtualBox of Windows if need be.\n\nA: For restoring, iTunes is the best option. Once you’ve determined if iTunes can restore the device - if not, you should have a specific error code from iTunes that explains precisely what’s not working (or have an error code to report here).\nIf iTunes can’t restore the device, a hardware repair may be in order as well.\n", "Q: I tried updating my iPhone, but now it says \"SIM is invalid\" I have an iPhone 3GS 32GB. I have just tried updating the phone using iTunes. The phone is second hand, and was unlocked when I bought it. I didn't know that when you try to update it, it loses everything. Now it isn't reading my SIM, even though I've used this same SIM in the phone before I tried updating it. Now, when I turn the phone on, it comes up with:\n\nSIM not valid - Only compatible SIM cards from a supported carrier may be used to activate iPhone. Please insert the SIM card that came with your iPhone or visit a supported carrier's store to receive a replacement SIM card.\n\nWhat does this mean? And how can I get my phone working again?\n\nA: This means that the phone was software unlocked (which requires a jailbreak). Because you updated the device using iTunes, you have removed the jailbreak and the phone is no longer in a state of carrier unlock. This is actually common practice and a great number of people end up getting burned (they either just don't know better or are lied to and told the phone is factory unlocked).\nYou can call the carrier the phone is originally locked to and have them unlocked it (they may charge a modest fee or if you luck out, do it for free as that particular model no longer being manufactured) or re-jailbreak the device and software unlock it yourself, provided you have a baseband revision of 06.15.00 or older.\nNote: Apple can't help in these matters.\n\nA: This is because the unlocking done earlier by you (or from whom you bought) might be a temporary unlock, so your iPhone got locked on updating.\nThere are quite a bunch of webs which will provide you with guidance /services to permanent unlock your device.\n\nA: sim not supported\nthe SIM card that you currently have installed in this iphone is from a carrier that is not supported\n", "Q: how do I enable multiple sshd ports in Mountain Lion I have multiple machines on my network that I access regularly using ssh.  I want to enable remote access through port forwarding, which means I'll need separate sshd ports for each machine.  That said, I'd like to continue to use port 22 for local access.\nI realize that I have to add the configs to /etc/services and that the key to my answer lies in sshd.plist. I've attempted to follow various suggestions online, all of which seem to indicate that the plist files exist in different locations than mine do.  One suggested ssh.plist and another sshd.plist.  My changes to ssh.plist accomplished nothing.  Another suggested changing sshd.plist, which didn't even exist on my machine, but /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.FileSyncAgent.sshd.plist does.  I was going to make and rename a copy of that file, but I couldn't tie it to a call in /etc/services.  I made a copy anyway, but then I couldn't figure out how to modify the  key as it's current value had no relationship to the file name (unlike the example for ssh.plist).\nSo, I currently have ssh and ssh-alt set in services, two ssh.plist files that vary based on the different file names (one ssh and the other ssh-alt) and two .sshd.plist files that are mirror images of each other.  When I rebooted the machine, port 22 no longer works, but my alternate port does.\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nA: Welp, I found the answer after a few more days of research, with the help of a response to this MacWorld post  I thought there had to be some way to include multiple ports in the one .plist file, but I couldn't figure it out.  You can add an \"Alternate Listener\" key to ssh.plist for the extra port inside the Sockets scope, such as:\n <key>Sockets</key>\n <dict>\n         <key>Listeners</key>\n         <dict>\n            (...)\n         </dict>\n         <key>Alternate Listeners</key>\n         <dict>\n            <key>SockServiceName</key>\n            <string>ssh-alt</string>\n         </dict>\n </dict>\n\nNotice the ssh-alt string for SockServiceName.  The original \"Listeners\" key remains as is, so you have Listeners and Alternate Listeners.  You have two entries in /etc/services for ssh and ssh-alt like:\nssh              22/udp\nssh              22/tcp\nssh-alt        4790/udp\nssh-alt        4790/tcp\n\nwhich preserves the port 22 internal access and creates access via port 4790 for external use (assuming you disable port 22 and port forward port 4790 on your firewall/router.\n\nA: Update: no longer works on Catalina...  alternative is to copy the launch daemon, rename the label and launchctl load it.\nCannot change ssh port on High Sierra\nThe theory is still the same, so I'll leave up... he's also wrong about not being able to use the same process... you can if you load it with root. But it's not recommended as it conflicts with MacOS.\nTl;Dr: \n\n\n*\n\n*open nano /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist and add this key/dict inside sockets/dict.\n\n\n    <key>Netgate SSH</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>SockServiceName</key>\n        <string>2269</string>\n    </dict>\n\n\n\n*restart the ssh daemon (danger!) launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist && launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist\nYour Sockets/dict key value should look like this\n<key>Sockets</key>\n<dict>\n    <key>Listeners</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>SockServiceName</key>\n        <string>ssh</string>\n        <key>Bonjour</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>ssh</string>\n            <string>sftp-ssh</string>\n        </array>\n    </dict>\n    <key>My Little Pony SSH</key>\n   <dict>\n       <key>SockServiceName</key>\n       <string>2269</string>\n   </dict>\n</dict>\n\n", "Q: iTunes downloads through manager When I download iTunes apps, music, etc.. content, the download speed fluctuates a lot and usually falls to around 64kbps. This is very impractical and time-consuming.\nWhereas, if I download other files through my browser, I get 512 kbps (my actual connection speed. I use a broadband connected with a cable, not WiFi).\nSo, is there a way/software, which could capture/log the download link when iTunes starts the download, so I could copy that into my download manager and download at full speeds?\nMaybe an IP connection logger, or firewall?\nI would have to start the download via iTunes first though, since I need the validated, purchased app file.\nAny other ideas?\n\nA: No, Apple won't let you do that, in part because of the way they cache the downloads. \n\nA: There are multiple causes which causes your iTunes to be slow.\n\n\n*\n\n*An old version of iTunes. Make sure you've the latest version as Apple constantly improves the software.\n\n*The Apple TV feature. This feature scans your iTunes library constantly. You can simple turn it off in your preferences.\n\n*Shared Libraries. Find in your preferences this option and turn it off. Sharing items demands bandwidth as well. You might gain a bit if you turn this off.\n\n*Genius is constantly connecting, comparing and matching your songs. It's designed to be a light weight feature, but in the end, it adds up and takes away the speed of other features like \"Downloads\". \n\n\nIt looks like you can add iTunes to a download manager (Windows only), so maybe if you provide me your download manager, I can find a way to add iTunes?\n", "Q: Why do debuggers need an admin password? Why does running LLDB or instruments require elevated privilages?\n\nA: Scanning protected memory is something only something authorized (in this case authenticated) sudoers are able to do.\nNot requiring this would be a huge security risk and is part of the reason Windows from the 90's and early 00's was at higher risk of virus infection.  An application could easily dip into the memory partition of another application, viewing or modifying its contents or inserting arbitrary executable code.\n", "Q: What does Time Machine back up? Does Time Machine backup system files, kernel files and other OS-related files? \nI have corrupted system drivers and files and I want to do a fresh install of OS X but I also want to back up my applications, files and folders. \nI wonder if I should go with Time Machine or manually backing up each file.\n\nA: Time Machine backs up EVERYTHING! That is why I recommend to use Time Machine to back up your system. If you decide to do a fresh install and only want to restore specific files or folders (like some apps, the documents folder, some music, but not the downloads folder...) you can do this via Time Machine too. You are not limited to take it all or nothing! You can pick what you like to restore, assuming you know where it is on your HDD.\n\nA: From my experience, two of the things that it doesn't back up are:\n1) My iCloud login;\n2) My Dropbox settings.\nWhen I do a full restore, I have to re-login to iCloud, Dropbox settings are set back to default and Dropbox does a full scan of my folder to confirm that it matches the cloud.\n\nA: I think I can comfort you with the following statement on the website of Apple (Update: The information cited here has been removed, but you can still find it in this archived version)\n\nTime Machine automatically backs up your entire Mac, including system\n  files, applications, accounts, preferences, email messages, music,\n  photos, movies, and documents. But what makes Time Machine different\n  from other backup applications is that it not only keeps a spare copy\n  of every file, it remembers how your system looked on any given day—so\n  you can revisit your Mac as it appeared in the past.\n\nOn the given page, there are even tutorials on how to restore your Mac from a Time Machine copy. \nPlease be aware those backups are not bootable. So you still have to manually install a fresh OS (from USB, DVD or other...)\n", "Q: Notification area icons are sometimes invisible in Windows 7 (Boot Camp) For some reason, sometimes my notification area icons are invisible in Windows 7 64-bit (Boot Camp, on an iMac mid-2010), as seen in this screenshot. Clicking on an invisible item does nothing. Restarting the computer will fix them, though. These icons are invisible during about 25% of all Windows 7 startups.\nThis installation of Windows 7 64-bit is completely fresh; I just installed it, then installed the latest Boot Camp drivers, and that's it.\nAnyone know what's going on here and what I can do to fix it?\n\nA: What I did to fix this was disconnect the Ethernet cable from my iMac, and when installing Windows 7, don't connect to wifi just yet. Then, install all Boot Camp drivers, and only then can I reconnect Ethernet and wifi. This prevents Windows 7 from automatically downloading drivers when it is unable to communicate with the iMac's features, since the Boot Camp drivers were not initially installed.\nSo, the notification area problem seems to somehow be related to conflicting Windows 7 and Boot Camp drivers. I notice the problem briefly returns when I install Windows 7 updates, so that seems to prove my point.\n\nA: Pull up the Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + esc). \nOn the “Processes” tab, find the process named explorer.exe. \nSelect it, then click End Process. \nThe taskbar should now disappear. \nSwitch to the “Applications” tab, click New Task and enter explorer in the small window that should pop up. \nConfirm with OK.\n", "Q: Is there a web browser I can use safely on Mac OS 10.5.8? Sometime in 2012, Adobe Flash asked me to update it. I tried, but it didn't work because my browsers (firefox and chrome) didn't support the newest flash. I tried to update my browsers, but neither firefox nor chrome supports mac os 10.5.8 anymore. Safari keeps telling me to update flash too. I know that using an older version of flash can be a security hazard, so I really want to update.\nMy question: Are there any browsers (perhaps a firefox variant) I can use more safely now than the browsers that shipped with 10.5.8?\n\nA: For the impatient: \nYou have two possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*PowerPC-based Mac: TenFourFox and no Flash.\n\n*Intel-based Mac: Opera (thanks to Cybermatatu for this one!) with  older Flash 10.3 (beware, Flash 10.3 is an archived version and is no longer supported nor updated with security fixes by Adobe).\nLong version:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you use an Intel processor you can use Opera:\n\nOpera 12 \nOS X Leopard (10.5), or greater: 32-bit and 64-bit Intel\n  systems supported\n\nOpera supports Flash Player plug-in.\n\n*If you use a PowerPC processor you may want to try TenFourFox.

They still charge my iPad and iPhone. So they do work and at first sight, they don't cause any harm to my devices.\nBut bare in mind Apple's adapters are probably the most safe ones to use. It makes sense a 19$ adapter provide more power, safety and guarantees then a 0,19$ adapter from eBay, DealExtreme,...  There are even people claiming they will harm your iPhone (or your house).\nKen Shirrif has compared like 12 adapters and his findings are written in his blog.\nTo give a short answer, I have no bad experience in using \"fake\" adapters (which is no guarantee or reference at all!), but if you want to play safe, just buy the real stuff :) \n\nA: Replica Lightning to USB:\nThis is completely safe yes. Personally I only use replicas at home and have not experienced any problems with it. Usually the price is more than half of what the original lightning adapter is.\nReplica cables:\nOnly CONS with replica cables is the quality of the termination at the ends of the cables. But as a PRO you can buy two-maybe three replicas in the price of one original. Just keep in mind to pull out the cable holding the plastic piece on both ends instead of pulling directly on the cable and you will be fine using those.\nReplica Power Adapters (USB):\nFor the Power adapter itself (USB) have a look at the answer here. Personally i dont recommend those. Mostly for the quality Apple have versus the replicas.

It's not the prettiest one, but it looks like it does what I'm looking for.\nhttp://findandreplace.sourceforge.net/\n\nA: I often use Ruby scripts like this:\nDir[\"**/*.txt\"].each { |f|\n  IO.write(f, IO.read(f).gsub(/search/, \"replace\"))\n}\n\nOr you can use gets(nil) with -i:\nruby -i -e 'print gets(nil).gsub(/search/, \"replace\")' *.txt\n\nIf you install Bash 4 and enable globstar, you can use ** in shells as well:\nsed -i '' 's/search/replace/g' **/*.txt\n\n\nA: I typically use TextMate:  \n\nTextMate (1) is/was a buy product, but TextMate 2 is currently under active openSource development on gitHub and free to use.\n\nA: This is exactly sed was written and it matches all of your requirements, except the learning curve is a bit steep. \nFor a more gentle learning curve, try TextWrangler from BareBones. It uses the BBEdit text engine and, I believe, has the full search & replace functionality of its big brother\n\nA: Take a look at my App Search and Replace. You can use it on multiple files or directories, safe your search/replace strings and you can use regular expressions.\n", "Q: Looking for a tool for creating or editing file and folder bookmarks (finder aliases) I created a bookmark / Alias (via finder) for an smb share after mounting it. That's quite fine and working for me at it's best. It automatically mounts the smb store when acessing the alias and I can browse into the share without huddle.\nBut: Other users are not very familar with it and would be pleased to get such a link pre-installed.\nThe problem is, that my bookmark automatically contains personal information (username in SMB:// URI and in some cases personalized path names for the share.\nI'm not able to edit this (binary) mac bookmark file in vim and it includes lots of unreadable information.\nThe question is:\nIs there any tool that will allow editing such a Mac System Alias (Bookmark) file so I can create presets for other users?\nYou aren't able to edit this in Finder natively nor through any text editor.\n\nA: Rather than attempting to edit an alias directly, you could look at making a tool that creates the alias for the user.\nUsing Automator you could create an application that uses the following built in actions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ask for Text\n\n*Connect to Servers\n\n*New Aliases\n\n\nAnd when the app is run, the following would happen:\n\n\n*\n\n*The user would be asked for the server address (you could pre-populate a default answer for this).\n\n*The share point would be mounted. A dialog would pop up asking for the users login credentials, which could then be stored in the keychain (more secure than having these details contained within the tool itself).\n\n*An alias would be created at a specified location, e.g. the Desktop.\n\n\nYou would then save this as an application and share it with your users.\n", "Q: How do you select multiple specific files? Say I've got 5 files, and I'd like to select just two of them. In Windows I would select file 1, then press Control, and then click file 5.\nHow could this be done in Mac Os X? \n\nA: You'll do the same thing by doing Command+Click.\n\nA: Use cmd + click if you are using a Mac keyboard or use the Windows-key + click if you are using a PC keyboard.\n", "Q: Move Archived Outlook Data Record to external storage I'm keeping a lot of old email archived in the OLM files (I was using PST in the PC). Unfortunately this is using 20GB of my 128 SSD and I'd like to move them in an external disk. What is the best way to do this?\n\nA: The OLM file is a standalone file, so all that you need to do is move that file to your external disk.  I have an external hard drive that I use for holding files that I want to keep but don't necessarily need daily access to.  In the Finder, I drag the file from my laptop hard drive to a folder that I've named \"Outlook archives\" on my external hard drive.\n", "Q: Would a late 2008 MacBook run with 8 GB or RAM if correctly purchased? We've got a late 2008 MacBook (already upgraded to 4GB RAM), it's fine -speed wise, but when checking the activity monitor were very close to running out of space -RAM wise.\nWhat I would like to do is upgrade the RAM to 8GB, but checking the Crucial website, it looks like the most RAM I can get in is 4GB. Is this correct or is there a way I can upgrade to 8GB? What would be preventing you using 8GB RAM?\n\n\nA: It is certainly possible to install 8GB of RAM on this model. You will need to check if you have the correct Boot ROM Version and install it if needed. Follow this guide.\nYou can learn what RAM to buy for your MacBook using System Profiler.   \n\nA: You can always reclaim the \"inactive\" memory with the purge command. Open a terminal window, type in purge and press enter. Most of the \"inactive\" memory will become free.\n", "Q: Restore 10.8.2 to original developer settings So I am at a point in a rabbit hole of troubleshooting programming problems (a lot of it seems to involve my gcc and fortran compilers, but I have long lists of libraries interfering with one another) where I feel I need to just (somehow) get a blank slate and reinstall everything (and strategically not do a number of things), I have my time machine backups for everything, as well as file backups for all of my regular content. And have done the basic prep as recommended here\nI am wondering if there are any other steps you might recommend either before reinstalling my OS, or instead of doing so(might uninstalling and reinstalling XCode help?)?  \nThanks for any help- desperate times call for desperate measures!\n\nA: A common development configuration these days is to use separate guest OSes for development and testing.  With so many different OS's and configurations to test on, it seems like the only viable single-cpu solution.\nIn my personal experience, I tend to have the host OS tailored to looking up documentation and one Guest OS specifically for Development.  Then for each OS I will be testing on, I get the OS install image and make a new VM.  Those Guest OS's I modify as little as necessary to ensure their stability.\nI still keep all my important files on the host OS's file system so that Time Machine will still pick them up.  Nonetheless, if you're hosting Mac OSes, a Time Capsule or some sort of shared AFP would still be viable if you chose to back them up.  I don't include the VM boot disks in my backups for the host OS - they change often and are rather large.\nGenerally I regard VMs as a disposable OS.  After initial configuration, I archive the VM boot disk and only touch it if I need to restore.\nAlso, if you're using VMWare, you can use Snapshots before installing your packages.  This is a good deal more convenient than doing a fully Time Machine backup, as is often want to do after messing with system files.\nIt sounds like you're not past the point of no return on your host OS.  You can probably still go this route, and you might find it better in the long run.\n", "Q: How to cleanly remove MacPorts I'd like to cleanly remove all changes made by MacPorts as well as MacPorts itself, to try my luck with homebrew.

I can only do one or the other due to budget.\nWhat would you go for?\n\nA: I would recommend that you upgrade the RAM. \nThis is because RAM is not user-replaceable and there is no way in the future to increase it. Storage, on the other hand, is more manageable via a USB 3, or Thunderbolt external harddrive. I have heard that the speed these peripherals is very reasonable.\nI know from personal experience that 8GB of RAM feels a little weak when I have all my web development tools open as well as Photoshop.

I do not have any SIM card in the phone.\nIs there something I can do to get the phone in working order again?\nIs there any way that can avoid using SIM card?\n**I fixed it ;)**\n\n\nA: Activation through iTunes or Over the Air (OTA) is when the device checks to determine if it is factory or carrier unlocked or if it needs a SIM to be activated.\nIt's almost certain that your failure to activate is due to not having a SIM card from the proper carrier. You do not need to have an active contract or phone number associated with the SIM (I have a 3GS which has an old SIM without a plan), it just has to be for the correct carrier.\n\nA: all you have to do is put in a sim and turn it on it will work perfectly fine.. good luck\n\nA: well, the only way you can solve this problem is a sim card. if you dont have one, i suggest you ask your mom or dad or friend or someone with a sim card. you can borrow it from them and then take it out and then ur in. i had the same problem. best of luck :)\n", "Q: Shared Internet apply /etc/hosts How do I make those who connect to me via a shared internet connection use my /etc/hosts file?

Shared Photostreams are a fantastic way to keep in touch with family and relatives. Comments on Shared Photostreams make them even better as this allows discussion about the action in the picture. However, here is the problem lies: there are two subscribers who share the exact same name (one married into the family, attaining the same last name as well) - for clarity, let's say \"Jessica Smith\".\nSo, when \"Jessica Smith\" comments, it is impossible to tell which person this is actually referring to. In normal life we have gotten accustomed to including the one's middle name when referring to her. So, the goal is to change it so that one is \"Jessica Smith\" and the other is \"Jessica Grace Smith\".\nHow is this possible?\n\"Jessica Grace Smith\" has tried to change her Apple ID name by managing her Apple ID online, but this has had limited success by updating some Photostreams and not others. Also, I have tried removing her, making sure her email was in my contact for her as \"Jessica Grace Smith\" and then re-inviting her, but this didn't work either.\n\nA: Following these steps should do the trick:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unsubscribe to the shared photo album.\n\n*Change the full name on the Apple ID account.\n\n*Subscribe again to the Photo Stream by getting a new invitation.\n\n\nAfterwards, all the comments you'll post should display the new name. The thing is that once a comment is posted, the name does not change, so if you want to change the name on an already posted comment, you'll have to Delete the comment, follow the steps, and post it again.\n\nA: The only way that it is possible to do this - as of iOS 6 - is to start a new Shared Photostream after the Apple ID name has been changed. So for this case:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Jessica Smith\" changes her name to \"Jessica Grace Smith\" using appleid.apple.com.\n\n*I (or the Shared Photostream originator) creates a new Shared Photostream, and invites everyone to it, including \"Jessica Grace Smith\".\n\n*The new name (with the middle name) will now correctly show on the new Shared Photostream.\n\n\nThis doesn't have any real negative effects because all the subscribers can stay subscribed to the old Photostream if they desire (and the originator leaves it that way). The other plus, is that one can un-subscribe from the old Photostream to save space.\n", "Q: Restoring a new iPhone via iCloud post-setup? I am trying to restore my new iPhone with the data from my old iPhone via iCloud. I have tried to follow this tutorial, but unfortunately I cannot connect to wifi during the setup process (my wifi requires me to activate each device via safari/some other mobile browser).\nIs there any way to restore my old data (i.e. photos, texts, etc.) after the setup process?\n\nA: Since this appears to be a defect in Apple's software with no non-hacky solution, I thought I would share how I worked around this issue to achieve semi-restoration:\n\n\n*\n\n*Photos: I first imported my photos from my iCloud photostream to iPhoto using this tutorial. Then I went to iTunes --> iPhone --> Photos and checked \"Sync Photos from iPhoto.\" Further, oddly enough, after linking iCloud to my iPhone again post-setup, a photo stream was synced with my phone, albeit missing a lot of photos. But iPhoto was able to load them all, so it didn't really matter.\n\n*Contacts: Luckily I had my contacts already synced with my Mac Contacts app. So to add my existing contacts all I had to do was go to iTunes --> iPhone --> Info and check \"Sync Contacts.\"\n\n*Calendar: I use Google calendar, so this was as simple as setting up my email again. However, even if you relied on your iPhone calendar, I believe this issue can be resolved by going to iTunes --> iPhone --> Info and selecting \"Sync Calendar.\"\n\n*Notes: Once I linked my iCloud to my phone post-setup, these notes automatically synced from the Notes Mac app. \n\n\nWhat I was unable to sync:\n\n\n*\n\n*Messages. Unfortunate but not really that important.\n\n*Applications. But these can easily be re-downloaded.\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem trying to restore a iCloud backup after my phone had a meltdown and I had to erase it and start again.  The only WiFi network I had was in a hotel room which meant I had to enter my room number and name to register.

Or are there any data recovery tools on OS X that work with network volumes? I'm using OS X 10.8.2 and the device I'm trying to recover is a FreeNAS 8.0 volume attached via AFP with no ZFS snap shots. Also, the volume spans 2 * 3TB drives, and ~5 TB were lost due to an rm -rf command in a malicious script.\n\nA: Even if you could do this, the network indirection means the tool cannot read raw data and will almost surely not yield the results you would hope for. The data that was deleted exists only on unallocated blocks - not exposed through the NAS device and then sent over a network protocol showing the live state of the filesystem after the rm had done it's damage.\nIf you're serious about the data recovery, you'll stop using that volume (disconnect all clients) and call a professional data recovery firm that knows how to reconstruct various RAID situations by imaging each drive directly and then reconstructing things. A call or support ticket to the storage vendor is usual, but in this case, I don't see any \"file recovery\" info on the FreeNAS web site.\nKnowing exactly the version of NAS controller will help you get a good quote on how much the recovery effort will cost. In most cases, their tools and knowledge coupled with drives that don't have failures and need a clean room resuscitation will reduce the cost of recovery to the time and tools needed for an expert to reverse the file deletion.\nThey will also be able to query you to see if you perhaps have overwritten all the data and perhaps want a quote before you commit to recovery.\n", "Q: My apple account and gmail account are messing up my email I have a registered apple account ending in @me.com and a gmail account as well.

Is it possible?\n\nA: I don't think there's any way to do that since iOS apps don't run well off an iOS device.\nOn a recent model Apple TV and software 5.2.1 for it, you now have three methods for controlling an TV:\n\n\n*\n\n*Infrared Remote\n\n*iOS Remote App\n\n*Bluetooth Keyboard\n\n\nSo, unless you have software on the Mac that can control hardware that will send infrared signals to the TV you might be bound to the above control options.\n\nA: I managed to control Apple TV from Mac with 1Keyboard application (http://www.eyalw.com/1keyboard) that turns Mac OS X into a bluetooth keyboard. Another app that does this is Type2Phone, probably there are even more of them.\n\nA: find software that lets you use your computer as a wireless keyboard/mouse. then hook that software into the apple tv instead of a computer device.

I took it to a repair shop, and the person said the hard drive died. I asked why, and he says it just happens (even though my Macbook Pro is only 1.5 years old). Talking with him, I mentioned that I transport my Macbook in sleep mode; he said I should not do that. Always shut it down, before transporting; he said, the hard drive failure may be unrelated though.\nNow, I checked the internet, and the online consensus seem to be it's ok to transport while asleep (though you should wait for the hard disk to stop spinning), but I'm not too sure.\nCan anybody here give me a qualified, confident answer? I would love to transport it, have a quick startup, but I don't want to damage my Macbook in the least bit.\n\nA: Macbooks are designed to be transported around in sleep mode. When the machine enters sleep mode, the hard drive stops spinning, and because the hard drive is basically the only mechanically moving part in the Macbook Pro (aside from the optical drive which shuts off as well), there is no risk of damage to the computer.\nHere are some other questions that you may find helpful\n\n\n*\n\n*Does closing the lid put a MacBook Pro to sleep? Would it hurt the computer if I carry it around without shutting it down?\n\n*Transporting from home to work (~10 min by car), should I just make my MacBook Pro sleep, or shut it completely down first?\n\n*https://superuser.com/questions/449629/is-sleep-mode-harmful-for-a-computer\n\nA: I carried around my old Thinkpad in sleep mode for about six years and never had the slightest problem with the hard disk and I'm sure that there's not much difference between a MacBook and other laptops at that point. Like others said before: The hard disk shuts down in sleep mode. Every laptop is designed to be carried around in sleep mode.\nIf you want to be extra sure you might want to consider exchanging the hard disk with a solid state disk. You'd have to pay more for less storage space but they have no moving parts so you can basically shake your laptop in operation like a cocktail shaker without causing any harm.\n", "Q: Google Talk Client for iOS is there a Google Talk (gChat) client for iOS that:\n\n\n*\n\n*does not prevent messages showing up in other clients\n\n*does not alter or send messages, add signatures or other spam?\n\n\nA: IMO messenger seems to be a bit better, at letting the message get to other clients as well\n\nA: You can use Hangouts This is new version of Google Talk and official google product.

When I was not home, I may need to access my mac with Screen Sharing. However the iMac display will turn itself on when I connect via Screen Sharing. The problem is I don't want to scare my family at home (with the elders and kids) as the iMac \"turn itself on suddenly\". \nThis is a problem specific for iMac. On MacBooks (Pro, Air, whatever) I can set the brightness to the lowest setting so the screen is black (i.e. the LED light is off). However on an iMac you cannot turn off the LED backlit by setting brightness. The display is still bright and everything is clearly visible even on lowest brightness setting.\nTherefore these solution are not working as the display will turn on as soon as you move your mouse or hit any key on the keyboard via Screen Sharing.\n\n\n*\n\n*Sleep Display (by Ctrl+Shift+Eject)\n\n*Using the code listed on http://pastebin.com/8CMaxGeP\nQuestion:\nIs the a way to keep the iMac display off entirely while you accessing it with Screen Sharing?\n\nA: OS X Lion added per-user screen sharing: the ability to have multiple remote desktop sessions active on a single Mac at the same time. It's not a perfect solution, but you may find it good enough for your case.\nWhen you connect to your Mac via Screen Sharing make sure the session is in Control Mode, not View Mode. You can switch modes by pressing Cmd+Option+X in the Screen Sharing app.\nOnce in Control Mode, look under the View menu and you should see an entry that says \"Switch to Virtual Display\". Select that to change the session to a virtual display, not the current desktop display, and log in as yourself.\nThe main display on your iMac should go to sleep according to your screen saver and energy settings once you've disconnected your remote session from the physical display and moved it to a virtual display.\nThe only flaw in this approach is I know of no way to start Screen Sharing on a virtual display from the get go. So the initial connect always wakes up the physical display.\nUpdate for Mavericks\nThe \"Switch to Virtual Display\" option in the Screen Sharing app went away in Mavericks. Instead, upon connecting to the other Mac with Screen Sharing:\n\nIf someone else is already connected to the Mac as a remote user, a dialog asks if you \n  want to share the display with the other remote user (Share Display), or log in \n  concurrently using a different user name and screen (Log In). Choose the option you \n  want.\nIf you choose Log In, you will share the Mac with the other remote user, but you won’t share the same screen.\n\nHere's an example. In this case I tried to connect a Screen Sharing session from my iMac to my wife's MacBook Pro where she was already logged in. This is the dialog I get when trying to connect:\n\n\nA: This is not a perfect solution but I believe this is a best solution so far.\nMy use case is to use iMac remotely from my Windows 7 laptop.\nHere is my solution.\nYou need the following things.\n\n\n*\n\n*Vine VNC Server from\nhttp://www.testplant.com/products/vine/vine-server/. You need\nanother VNC server to make another private display.\n\n*Wake Up Me On utility from http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/wake_on_lan.html. This is a windows utility but I think there is a similar one for OS X.\n\n*Turn on “Wake for network access” on Energy Saver of System Preferences and set Computer sleep to Never. if this is not never, iMac goes to sleep shortly after VNC connecting.\n\n*You may need to activate Fast User Switching.\n\n\nHere are the steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Vine VNC server. (actually copy it to somewhere in your Mac)\n\n*Launch Vine VNC Server and open preference of the VNC server and go to connection\n\n*Select 1 from Display Number and enter 5901 to the port. Do not use 0 as the display number. Display 0 means the main console. i.e. the monitor.\n\n*Set the VNC password.\n\n*Start Vine VNC server.\n\n*Launch VNC client. I am using Real VNC viewer but it does not matter.\n\n*Type your mac host name or IP address and :1 (1 means the display number) For example, if your mac host name is iMac or the IP address is 192.168.1.20, this will be iMac:1 or 192.168.1.20:1\n\n*Check if everything is working well and then close the VPN client.\n\n*Switch to Logon window.\n\n*Sleep iMac by clicking Sleep on the bottom <-\n this is very important. Just turning off the monitor using\n Ctrl-Shift-Eject does not work.\n\n*Wake up the iMac using the Wake Up Me On utility.\n\n*Connect to iMac again.\n\n*Now you can use iMac and the monitor is still off.\n\n\nThe key to this solution is to sleep iMac when you leave and wake it up through network access (iMac works as normal after waking up but the monitor is still off) so this may not work outside of a local network.\n(I have confirmed this works on a iMac 27-inch Late 2012 with Mountain Lion).\n\nA: Here's a dirty way to do this (since the Virtual Desktop option is only available when there's more than 1 person logged in): On the Mac you want to access, create a Guest User account, and log on this account.  When you screen share to this Mac, it'll ask you if you want to share the display or connect to a virtual display.  Choose the latter.  The Guest User account will be the one that's displayed on the Mac screen.\n\nA: Jolly's Fast VNC client has an option under the Advanced preferences called \"Enable Remote Screenlock\" that sounds exactly like what you're describing.\nAnother possible solution is a password-protected screensaver with a short timeout.  That way if you leave your station logged-in and unattended, it will lock itself down.\n\nA: Logmein has an option to blank the host display: https://secure.logmein.com/welcome/webhelp/pro/LogMeIn/t_remotecontrol_blank.html\n\nA: I have found a workaround, but that's not perfect. With Brightness Control (freeware), I can make my screen black while everything is still visible via Screen Sharing. However it didn't turn off the LED light. A black screen with the LED backlit on is still drawing enough attention in the evening.\nUPDATE Oct 2015:\nUnfortunately the Brightness Control app no longer work on Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan.\n\nA: Instead of turning the computer off, or putting it in sleep mode, you could consider just turning the display off.\nThere is a key combination that you can use to turn the screen off which is: ctrl + shift + eject.\n", "Q: Dictionary definition for hyperlinks Normal Behavior: When highlighting a word on a webpage, and right clicking on it, a contextual menu pops up; you can get the dictionary definition by choosing, \"Look Up 'SelectedWordHere'\".\nHowever, if the word you want a definition for is also a hyperlink there is no option in the contextual menu to look up the word in the dictionary.

My old short name was cannyboy, and my new one is cannyman. How would I go thru the whole hard drive and change ownership of all cannyboy to cannyman, without changing any other attributes of the files?\n\nA: As starter I would suggest you run the \"repair permission\" function in disk utility.\nIf the problem still persists you could run a command like:\nfind . -user old_user | while read file; do echo chown new_user  $file; done\n\nnote: this doesn't do anything as is now - you will need to adjust it to your needs - and make sure it does nothing bad.\nupdate learnt some more and now I would run a command like this:\nfind . -user old_user -print0 | xargs -0  sudo echo chown new_user\n\nagain adjust the command before you run it!\n\nA: FWIW changing the short name is considered \"bad.\" Guess you can see why now.\nThat said, one way to deal with this is to use \"find\" to locate all the files owned by cannyboy:\nfind * -user cannyboy\n\n(for just homebrew you could limit this to the /usr/local/ folder hierarchy like):\nfind -f /usr/local/* -user cannyboy\n\nNext loop through the results with:\nsudo chown cannyboy cannyman *file*\n\nnote the above command will require sudo and if you mess up could cause further problems.\nTo do this in a two step process, first:\nfind -f /usr/local/* -user cannyboy > files.txt\n\nThen loop through files.txt using the following script (with sudo):\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwhile read file;\ndo\n    chown cannyboy cannyman $file\ndone\n\nThe advantage of this is you can use a subset of your txt file to test everything before you commit to a massive change.\nIf you are brave, you can try the one step process (this should work, but it might not):\n#/bin/bash\nfor result in `find -f /usr/local/* -user cannyboy`\ndo\n    chown cannyboy cannyman $result\ndone\n\n(BTW prior to Mac OS X 10.8.1 there was a nasty find bug that would omit some results)\n", "Q: Multiuser - can process of background user kept running? On my Mac I use three user accounts. From what I understand when I'm logged in as one the processes of the other accounts are suspended. I switch between them with fast user switching.\nMy question is - can one assure that some processes keep running? Searching I found a few hints how to do on command line - but I'm considering to let a graphic application - like Steam - update itself for one user, and work as another user at the same time.\n\nA: I'm confident your premise is false.  When another user logs in to Mac OS X using the fast user switching, the GUI processes of other users are not suspended, but do continue to run in the background.  As long as you don't log out of the other accounts, their Finder process and programs launched as that user should continue to run in the background.\nFor instance, as I type this with my primary cwrea account on my Mac mini, I have another sampleuser account logged in (at the same time), and that user has a Safari window open that is playing a YouTube video.  Right now.\nThen, if I load Activity Monitor while having my account cwrea in the foreground and select to view \"Other User Processes\", Activity Monitor is reporting consistent ~8% CPU usage by a specific process named \"PluginProcess\" owned by the sampleuser account.\nMoreover, if I switch back to sampleuser's login session via fast user switching, the video is at a time location beyond where I left it, consistent with where it would be if I hadn't switched to my main account in the interim.\nFor what it's worth, the sound (and video, obviously) of the other background login session are suppressed, in that I don't hear or see either, but I can't find any evidence that graphical programs necessarily are suspended or cease operating in the background.\n", "Q: Plist in /System/Library/LaunchAgents not loading on reboot I have created the plist and placed it in /System/Library/LaunchAgents/.

Simply put, this is what I want: I want to take a unique printer preset that has already been made and make the OS default to it any time that particular printer is selected to be printed to. \nI know how to edit a particular printer's 'Default Settings' preset through the CUPS web UI, but this solution doesn't work for me because one of the printing options I need to change doesn't appear in this UI (for science: the printers I'm working with are Konica Minolta Bizhub C252, C353, and C364; the setting I'm looking to change is make the default color \"Grayscale\"). \nI have been able to modify the com.apple.print.custompresets.forprinter.PRINTER.plist file to get the system print dialog to pull up the preset that I want by default, but there is a problem with solving things this way: I can't edit this PLIST file properly with TextEdit (the XML gets mangled), and installing XCode on every machine isn't feasible. A solution could be to bring an editor with me on a thumb drive to each machine, but I don't know of an app I could use.\nAny path to a solution to this problem, I am open to. I've tried to be as specific about my ultimate goal as possible, and I will answer any followup questions I can.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: There is a much easier way.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a Print Preset, with the settings as you want them. Select it.\n\n*Press the Print button while holding down Alt (Option).\nThat will force your current settings to be the default for the printer.\n\nA: This Konica model is a PostScript printer, right?\nYou shouldn't need to directly edit any .plist file for this.\nThe correct way to do this without using the GUI (web UI or printer settings) is via the lpadmin command.\n\n\n*\n\n*First, find out what options are provided by the printer (which are laid down in the PPD file located in /etc/cups/ppd/printqueuename.ppd):\nlpoptions -l -p printqueuename\n\nMost likely you will see lots of lines, one of them like these:\n[....]\nColorModel/Color Mode: *CMYK Gray\n[....]\n\nIn each line the asterisk (like above in '*CMYK') denotes a default setting, which will be automatically applied when printing, and you do not need to specify it separately.\nThat means, you would have to supply a print job you want done in Gray on the command line like this:\nlp -d printqueuename -o ColorModel=Gray some-file\n\n\n*Second, now use this Knowledge to change this setting system wide by running this command:\nsudo lpadmin -p printerqueuename -o ColorModel=Gray\n\nYou can now check, if your setting has been applied. For this, run:\nlpoptions -p printerqueuename | grep --color ColorModel\n\n\nOf course you can apply this method for any other particular setting. To repeat:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use lpoptions -l -p printer to find out the (vendor-specific) syntax of option names and their values\n\n*Use lpadmin -p printer -o option1=valuaA -o option2=valueB ... to set (multiple, in this case) default print settings (which will also show up pre-selected in the OS print dialog). [Note: for more recent CUPS versions you have to use -o option1-default=valueA...]\n\n*Check success of setting with lpoptions -p printer (or check it with the GUI).\n\nA: Are you looking for a way to edit files easily?\nTextWrangler is a good option.  It's a small, free, and good plist editor.  You can put that on a thumb drive and go to each machine and install it.  On your thumb drive you can also have a file named \"plist_edit.sh\" with these contents:\n#!/bin/bash\nedit /path/to/your/plist/com.apple.print.custompresets.forprinter.PRINTER.plist\n\nOnce TextWrangler is installed, just double-click the plist_edit.sh file.

What version of iOS can iPhone 4S run without having to jailbreak?\n\nA: Apple's website for iOS explains that the (now, as of February 2013) current version of iOS runs on all but the first two models of the iPhone. So the 3GS, 4, 4S, and 5 all support iOS6. As to what will happen in the future, no one can say besides Apple, but they currently support the latest four generations of iPhone hardware (but only the latest two for the iPod Touch).\n\nApple's website previewing iOS7 indicates that iOS 7 will support iPhone 4, 4S, and 5, the 5th generation iPod touch, the iPad 2, the iPads with retina display (two models, one with traditional dock connecter and one with Lightning connector but only listed once on their site), and the iPad mini.\n\n", "Q: Does OS X process sound in any way other than volume adjustment before outputting it? Some Windows systems have various \"sound enhancer\" functions enabled by default (depending on the audio driver).  This changes all sounds that are sent to the speakers by applying equalisation and possibly mixing together the right and left channels of stereo sound for a \"better surround effect\".\nI would like to know if OS X applies any similar transformations by default, and if yes, how I can turn them off.\nI need precise control over sound output for a physics experiment with two speakers.  I would like to play a pre-generated wave file exactly as it is, without any post-processing.  Most importantly, the two channels must not be mixed at all, and preferably no non-linear transformation should be applied to single channels either (this is less important because some non-linearity is unavoidable when the signal goes through the analog hardware).\nNote: The question is about OS X in general, not about iTunes, which does include a sound enhnacer.  I won't use iTunes for playback.\n\nA: I believe the output is unmodified except for amplification.  For specific settings, you might find the Audio MIDI Setup utility useful as it includes per-speaker amplification settings.  As I'm not a big audiophile I can't attest to the specific settings you mention but that's where I would start to test things out.\n\n", "Q: Dragging an email with attachment to another mailbox looses attachment I was dragging an email message in Mail.app and intended to drag it to another folder.

For several weeks now, my friend’s MacBook has been plagued by this sound, randomly occurring while running: http://c.abr.vg/321r2Q3Y2W0J\nWe’ve never been able to reproduce it, and it has persisted on her machine across Archive & Installs, and a clean reinstall (10.8.2) and migration via Migration Assistant (System Library and ‘Other Files’ deselected). We only even have a recording of it because I had her run QuickTime and record everything she was doing (audio only) until she caught it.\nNow, the sound has manifested itself onto my Mac mini. I was previously blaming the hardware on her machine, but now I’m certain that there is an egregious software issue.\nBoth of our machines share little to no software. I’m a developer; she’s a human. ;)\nWhat could be causing this?\n\nA: It's indeed the sound Facebook makes when there is a new notification. Or at least, that's what it sound like (very much).\nRecently, Facebook did some testing and as you can hear on the movie in the post, sounds are very similar.\nNot very user-friendly, but luckily you can disable this sound if it's bothering you.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to your Notifications account settings\n\n*Uncheck the sound option\n\n\n\n\nA: I don't recognise it immediately, but can perhaps suggest tools to help you find it.\nAs for identifying the file, the closest I could find in a short time on my computer was /Applications/Mail.app/Contents/Resources/No Mail.aiff but I think yours has a longer tone on the front. But perhaps you can find it yourself...\nI'm assuming it's a file on your hard drive, somewhere... most applications store sound effects in .m4a or .aiff files. So my theory is you can find it by brute force... here's a command that'll find audio files, print their name and play them.\n# find / -name \"*.m4a\" -or -name \"*.aiff\" -exec echo \"Playing {}\" \\; -exec afplay \"{}\" \\;\n\nNote that this particular command plays all *.m4a and *.aiff files, so you might need to extend it with -or -name \"*.mp3\" or similar for other file types (e.g. .wav, not sure really what else to try!)\nThe two -exec arguments first print the file name, and then play the file. So you should see the name of each file appear, and then hear it played. Ctrl+C stops it if you find your match (and you can use afplay if necessary to re-play the last few if you're not sure which it was).\nIf you have lots of music on the computer as well, you may need to exclude your iTunes library or similar:\n# find / -not -path \"*/iTunes/*\" \\( -name \"*.m4a\" -or -name \"*.aiff\" \\) -exec echo \"Playing {}\" \\; -exec afplay \"{}\" \\;\n\nThis excludes any files if their path includes a directory called iTunes (you can modify this to match your iTunes library folder).\nThat of course only tells you what the file was, not necessarily what was running it... if it's in the Resources directory within an Application package, or another helpful path, it might be clear that it's from some specific Application.\nIf not you could then try\n# sudo opensnoop -f <filename>\n\nand leave that running until you hear the sound effect. That should then show you what process played it...\nGood luck!\n(Incidentally, if you or your friend have housemates like mine, you'll probably find out its someone messing with you, SSHing into the computer and running afplay <sound> on a regular basis... or maybe they put it in the crontab...)\n\nA: Funny, I heard a sound similar to that this morning when I got a Facebook notification. I have Facebook in Notification Center, but there's no setting for sounds. I often get Facebook notifications but this is the first time I've ever heard a sound. I'm not sure it's the same sound, but it was an odd sort of beep. Do you have Facebook in Notification Center?\n\nA: I was getting some similar sounds and was not understanding what was going on. Later figured out that when a buddy signs in/signs out we get a sound notification.\nThis can be changed by modifying the following setting\nMessages ==> Preferences ==> Alerts ==> Event (Buddy Becomes Available) Change it\nSimilarly change for buddy becomes unavailable.\nHope this helps someone.\n\nA: I can usually stop this distortion by connecting/disconnecting my bluetooth speakers, and this usually resets my sound back to normal. But when I have nothing to connect to, I have to restart.\nSo it's something to do with the sound drivers obviously. I just don't know how to stop it or why it happens.\n", "Q: Mountain Lion: how to change webcam resolution I've just recently got my first Macbook Pro. I'd like to change the resolution of the inbuilt webcam, because my daily GoToMeeting chews through 1-2Gb of traffic and there's no flatrate available from my ISP for my connection.\nThe GoTo meeting software offers no setting for resolution change. How can I do this?\nThanks\n\nA: Apple (or a 3rd party) should write a utility to allow you to dial down the native resolution of the internal camera, but to my knowledge they have not, so far.\nYou can work around this by piping the video output from your web camera into another program that processes the camera's video stream and \"re-publishes\" it to your Mac as a virtual camera (aka pseudo-camera) which will be available for use in other applications on your Mac.\n\nHere's how I did it. I've tested this solution under OS X 10.8. It also works under OS X 10.6. (I'd bet it probably works in 10.7, also.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the free (donation-ware) webcam effects utility CamTwist Studio.\n\n*Set your web browser to run in 32-bit mode.  (Why? Because the Adobe Flash  browser plugin must run in 32-bit mode in order to access the CamTwist virtual camera device.)  To do this, go to the Finder, locate your web browser app, do \"Get Info\", and check the \"Open in 32-bit mode\" checkbox. Don't launch your web browser yet.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Open CamTwist Studio, go to the Preferences, click the Video Devices tab, choose your video device, then use the \"Force camera resolution\" setting to force whatever resolution you prefer. (Suggest 320 x 240 for low-bandwidth internet connections.)\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll then need to define a \"Setup\" in CamTwist studio. Follow the Steps in the CamTwist main window: double-click \"WebCam\" from the Video Sources column. \n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Skip to Step 5 in the Cam Twist main window - select your camera device in the Settings column:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Preview from the Tools menu. A window should pop up showing you a live video stream from your camera device.\n\n*(optional) If you wish, play around with the many interesting effects available within CamTwist, such as \"Comic Book,\" shown here:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Now you're ready to launch your web browser (in 32-bit mode). Most web-based video chat/meeeting services (such as GoToMeeting) use Adobe Flash for handling video. When you go to configure your camera settings for video chat, you should see a new \"camera\" device available, called \"CamTwist Studio.\"  If you select this device, your video stream should be the modified, low-resolution 320x240 (or whatever size you chose) stream, plus any effects you added in CamTwist.\n\n\nThe CamTwist \"virtual\" video device should also be available in most other programs that use Mac OS X Core Video services, i.e. Skype and many other apps. (But not all. For example, it doesn't work with FaceTime.)\nHere's an example of the CamTwist video stream being used on http://www.chatroulette.com:\n\n", "Q: Safari - How to retain downloaded zip files? I know I can get (Desktop) Safari to stop unarchiving downloads. I don't mind the files being unarchived. I just don't want the zip archives deleted. Is there a way to do this? (10.8.x).\n\nA: Safari doesn't handle the unzipping itself, it simply opens the zip with the default program, which is the OS X Archive Utility, unless you've changed it.\nBy default, Archive Utility shouldn't delete zip files, but it's possible the preferences got changed. To stop the archives from being deleted, open Archive Utility, located in /System/Library/CoreServices/, then open its preferences.\n\nChange the After expanding: setting to leave archive alone.\n\n", "Q: Lost first backups - time machine I seem to have lost my first backups, they disappeared from time machine!....\nIs there a way to get back to them?\n\nA: I think your first backups are most probably auto purged by Time Machine.\nTime Machine automatically remove oldest backups when your backup disk is full. And Time Machine keeps hourly backups for the past 24 hours, daily backups for the past month, and weekly backups until your backup drive is full.\nTherefore there's no guarantee that your first backup(s) will be preserved.\nYou may try data recovery softwares on the Time Machine drive, but quite likely it won't help as Time Machine make new backup hourly and overwritten the old data.\n\nA: If you are depending on Time Machine to archive files that you have removed from your hard drive, that's not a backup (there's only one copy of the data- in Time Machine). As Owen mentioned, it's likely that Time Machine automatically purged your early backup(s).\nYou really need to reevaluate your backup strategy because I don't think you understand what the role of Time Machine is.\n", "Q: Something has been wrong with my finder and Mac. How to fix? Finder is often unresponsive.\nAlso in many software, like xcode or any project. I used to be able to right click and select open in Finder. Now if I do that nothing happen.\nZip utility is much slower. Takes minutes to solve.\nI think this happen since I used ccleaner or something.\nHow to fix?\nFinder seems to be the one affected. I wonder if there is other apps with option to \"open in Finder\" like xcode.\n\nA: There is a bug in 10.8.2 where occasionally revealing files in Finder stops working and Archive Utilility stops responding whenever you try to extract an archive.\nAs a workaround, you can terminate appleeventsd from Activity Monitor or with sudo killall -kill appleeventsd. (Without -kill other processes stop responding.)

You might be able to script something like that, however; find all tracks for albums in a smart playlist that meets certain conditions.\n", "Q: Terminal returns not found for most commands Mac OSX I'm really new to Mac OSX and UNIX based systems. I wanted to run a few Windows games on my Mac Mini so I started installing Wine and MacPorts.\nI think the installs are correct, but when I type sudo port install wine I see a not found error in my terminal. I tried other basic commands like say and clear and all of them return the same not found error.\nMy research shows that my PATH might be incorrectly set, but it lacks steps I can implement.\nSpecifically, I ran this command: echo $PATH and it returned:\n\n/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/opt/local/bin\n\nI'm a complete newbie to mac and have no idea where .bash_profile or any of those files are. My skills let me install Xcode and the Command Line tools for Xcode and I sense I need to level up on path management.\nAt this point I need help managing my dot files and changing my path to fix these specific errors on Mountain Lion.\nWhat are my next steps?\n\nA: Similar problem was happening to me, so what I did was:\n1) typing export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\" into the terminal in order to make it temporarily working\n2) Editing bash_profile by typing /usr/bin/open ~/.bash_profile -a TextEdit\n3) When I opened my bash_profile file I realised the last line export looked really messy with some strange symbols, so I changed it entirely to export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH\nI'm an absolutely beginner at this but I managed to get those steps by reading pieces of solutions from different questions on SE, so hope it could help someone else.\n\nA: It sounds like you overwrote your path rather then just adding to it.\nMake sure when you set your PATH you include \"${PATH}\" to include your existing path, as well.\nBy default the $PATH is set in a couple of files. Technically you should add to your $PATH in the .bash_profile file in your home directory.\nOne suggestion if to check if a certain folder exists before you add them to your PATH.\nFor example I have:\nif [ -d /usr/local/bin ] ; then\n    PATH=/usr/local/bin:\"${PATH}\"\nfi\n\nif [ -d /usr/local/mysql/bin ] ; then\n    PATH=/usr/local/mysql/bin:\"${PATH}\"\nfi\n\nif [ -d /opt/local/bin ] ; then\n    PATH=/opt/local/bin:\"${PATH}\"\nfi\n\nif [ -d /opt/local/sbin ] ; then\n    PATH=/opt/local/sbin:\"${PATH}\"\nfi\n\nif [ -d ~/bin ] ; then\n    PATH=~/bin:\"${PATH}\"\nfi\n\n(The -d directory command checks to see if the directory exists)\n\nA: For me I got into this exact issue when I attempted to add a new directory to PATH using an incorrect export command in my ~/.bash_profile. Both examples below.\nexport PATH=/some/new/path:PATH (incorrect, note missing $)\n\nvs\nexport PATH=/some/new/path:$PATH (correct)\n\n\nA: $PATH should contain these folders: /usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin.\nTry editing ~/.bash_profile, ~/.profile, or ~/.bash_login (with for example /usr/bin/open ~/.bash_profile -a TextEdit) and commenting out any lines that modify the path.\nIf that works, you can add a line like export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH to ~/.bash_profile.\n\nA: In addition to the fix it answers, I'd also like to call out one thing to test.\nIf your current window simply has a bad PATH variable and your system isn't more broken, you can fix the path easily:\necho $PATH\n/usr/libexec/path_helper\n\nCompare the output of the two above commands. If you want to return to a \"safe\" path, just copy and paste the line that the path_helper provides into that terminal. On an unmodified Mac 10.11 system, you should have this output from the helper tool:\nPATH=\"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\"; export PATH;\n\nIf your path needs to be customized, then look to the excellent answers also on this question.\n\nA: Your terminal's ./bash_profile may have been overwritten.\nUse export PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin in the terminal to temporarily rewrite the current PATH settings. This should give you access to sudo and nano which you will then use nano .bash_profile. For me, deleting everything in the file worked.\n\nA: Check to see if the folder-address is present in PATH variable. Type on the terminal:\necho $PATH\n\nTerminal will display: /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin ...(other paths in concatenation)\nMy prime motivation to share this answer is, you must first check if PATH variable includes the folder-address, which you are looking for, as one of its values. Moreover, the PATH fetches its values from multiple locations such as  /etc/path, ~/.bash_profile, /etc/path.d, ~/.zshrc\nIf you can't find yours, then it's evident that folder-address must be included in PATH. If it isn't, PATH won't be able to recognize your command. You can achieve this in these 2 ways:\n(Method 'B' worked like a charm for me)\nA. (May work) Write it inside .bash_profile file in ~ i.e. Home folder (like many previous answers have mentioned above.)\nB. (100% works) Write it inside the /etc/paths file. (paths file is found inside /etc folder. Firstly, make sure you have read+write access in order to edit this file. Secondly, system settings won't allow editing because editing creates a duplicate copy of this file which will be irrelevant. Hence, better edit with it vim). Simply insert the folder-address at a new line in this file.\nRelaunch your terminal and fire up the command you wanna check for.\n\nA: Worth checking your Terminal preferences. From the keyboard, press the Command and comma keys [⌘ ,]. Then click on \"Profiles\" and select the \"Shell\" tab. Make sure the startup run command has the correct command. (Defaults to empty text.) Try unchecking the run command option and open another terminal tab. It should default to your system's default shell.\n\nSomehow during the upgrade process between Mojave and BigSur, my preference in the shell run command was changed to \"-bash\"... This was causing the\n\n-bash: -bash: command not found\n\nerror in my case as there were zero problems with my .profile , .bashrc, and .bash_profile files.\n\nA: None of the solutions worked for me So I manually removed the files in the root folder path. Then worked. The path I found was /Users/...**. It was hidden files so made it visible and removed the bash_profile and zprofile. Then mac terminal was working fine.\n", "Q: Unable to uncheck the \"Encrypt Backup\" box, in iTunes 11 I am running iTunes 11, and have just plugged in my iPad 2 (running iOS 6.1.2) in.\nI would like my back-ups to be unencrypted, but I can't uncheck the check box that would allow me to, as you can see in the screenshot:\n\nAnyone know how to fix this?\nI do know the backup password, and have tried changing it but to no avail.\n\nA: I had a similar issue and documented the procedure here:\n\nI have found that this can be caused by installed Profiles\n  (Crashlytics Provisioning Profile in my case, but some other people\n  reported the same with an M1 (the telecommunication company) Profile\n  installed).\nTo delete it:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Go to Settings > General > Profile, tap on the app’s configuration profile.\n  \n*Then tap Delete Profile.

If I create a simple App, would it be possible for me to install it in any other devices without having to upload it to the Apple Store and wait for the reviewing process? \n\nA: Yes, there a couple of ways this could be achieved. \n\n\n*\n\n*With a Enterprise Developer Account, you'll be able to Archive your App for in-house distribution, being eligible any device. Bear in mind that openly distributing your App this way will infringe Apple's agreement and your account could be suspended, as it's meant to be used for a company to distribute an App among its employees.\n\n*With a Regular developer account you could send an ad-Hoc\nversion of your App, which could be installed into any device\nwhich has been previously registered in your Developer Account. You'll only be able to register 100 devices, though.\n\n\nWith either account, you'll be able to build a version of your App in any device. \nHere's Apple's list of their different Developer Programs.\n\nA: Yes, however you will need to set up a provisioning profile and add each device you are installing you app on (you are allowed to provision 100 devices).\nYou do need to join the iOS Developers program for this to work ($99 per year).\nOnce you join the developer program you can set up your provisioning profile from the provisioning portal (https://developer.apple.com/ios/manage/overview/index.action) there is an Assistant to walk you through the process (which IMO is a PITA).\n", "Q: Draft messages in Mountain Lion Mail do not include server draft messages I had a clean install Mountain Lion on my Macbook Pro, early 2011.\nFollowing suggestions in the forums, I carried my \"Mail\" folders (folders, preferences, etc) from my cloned backup of Snow Leopard.\nMountain Lion Mail automatically created the necessary accounts in the new way it is set up.\nHowever, the local Drafts folders do not include my drafted messages in individual IMAP e-mail accounts (yahoo, gmail, uni, etc).\nI can see these draf messages under the folders of these individual e-mail accounts. But they are not like drafts. I cannot edit them. I have same controls as in the messages that are sent to me.\non the other hand, if I open a new message, type somethings and close without sending, that message goes into the Drafts folder.\nHow can I go around this problem?\n\nA: I have an iMac (Mountain Lion.)  I couldn't edit any of my drafts.  I finally found that all I had to do was click FORWARD and then when the email comes on the screen I can edit.  (Too bad extra steps have to be taken, though.)\n\nA: If you move the drafts from the email's draft folder into Mail's draft folder Mail then treats them as drafts so you can then edit them as drafts. Though this is could be a very tedious process and I could not really find a way for Mail to do this automatically.\n", "Q: Anyway to reinstall a clean Mountain Lion without erasing my personal data? Actually I really need a clean ML on my Macbook, will the Internet Recovery function delete the system folder (not user folder) and replace a clean installation to it?\nI need a clean system with no third party software installed and I need to keep my personal folder (I have almost 800GB of my data in my harddrive and I currently have no space to backup my data using Time Machine)\nThanks.\n\nA: A clean install is just that - it wipes out everything.\nYou can't do an \"in place\" clean install (as far as I'm aware). Even if developers wanted to provide it it would be a nightmare. I'm not just blowing it out of proportion (I'm a developer) - it would be a nightmare.\nPRIOR TO ANY OF THIS MAKE A FULL SYSTEM BACKUP. Hard drives are cheap. If you can't afford a hard drive for backup, then DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS - NO SERIOUSLY. AND WHEN I SAY SERIOUSLY I MEAN SERIOUSLY SERIOUSLY.\nThat said, you CAN do a reasonable clean install and still maintain MOST of your information. Here's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a bootable DVD, flash drive or hard drive with the ML installer.\n1a. Make sure it really is bootable!\n\n*Back up your personal data. (and any other users)\n\n*Back up your applications.\n\n*DO NOT BACK UP system info (this is the downside). Note that some applications put info in weird or unusual places - you may have to reinstall that software.\n\n*Reboot the system using the DVD, flash drive or hard drive.\n\n*Run the ML installer.\n\n*Copy all the user data and applications back.\n\n*Determine what no longer works correctly and reinstall those applications (yes - seriously NOT fun).\n\n\nI did this with Lion (but not ML) but AFAIK it should work.\nClean installs \"break\" applications (many install libraries to work correctly or create 'hidden' directories).\nGood luck (and remember: FULL SYSTEM BACKUP FIRST)\n\nA: According to this article http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4718 both Recovery and Internet Recovery functions won't erase your personal data, however, they won't delete third-party software either.\n\nA: Why not backup your personal data somewhere, then do the reinstall, then restore the backups?  \nIf you already have a backup strategy in play, then you are ready.  If you don't have a backup strategy, then reaching the point where you have to do a reinstall is as good a time as any to get one!\n", "Q: What happens when interrupting a zip -erm process? What happens if you interrupt following command \n$ zip -erm foo foo/dirfoo1\n\nI realized that time will not permit me to finish. What happens when I Ctrl+C me out of this?

If so, would that be as simple as re-running the command?\nOr am I going to find what is not unzipped, and can I run the command for the \"leftovers\"?\n\nA: \nAm I left with something that could be continued where it left off\n\nNo. If you send a an Interrupt Unix Signal to zip using Control-C, you'll terminate the zip process and when you run it again it will start from the beginning, overwriting anything it already extracted.\nIf you instead send a Stop signal Control-Z, the zip process will be paused, and you can resume it later using the fg command.\nNote that this will only work if you can maintain the state of your system. That is, if you sleep the system you'll be OK, but if you shutdown, then zip will still be killed. Also, it assumes that the file zip was working with remains available while it is stopped; that is, if it resides ona  network share which you dismount, sending a SIGSTOP will still not work.\n", "Q: How I can move the clock to the middle of the menu bar? How I can move the clock, by default at the far right side of the menu bar, to the middle of the menu bar?\n\nA: Unfortunately for you, the answer is: you can't. The way the Mac OS X Menu Bar is set up, Application Menus get added starting in the left hand corner (after the Apple menu) and going right; System and 3rd party Menu Extras get added from the right hand corner and go left. There's no way to absolutely position a menu on the menu bar; you can only change the order of the items.\nAs Tony mentioned in his answer, the user can reorder Menu Extras by dragging them while holding Command.

Are they secure? Support for OS X versioning is spreading among apps (e.g., TextWrangler has just added this feature as of version 4.5), but it is unclear what the security implications of this are. For example, if I use an app to store important or sensitive information, I will make sure that the file is on a password protected, encrypted volume; but I worry that OS X versioning might circumvent this by storing versions in an un-secure form and location.\nWhere does OS X versioning store versions? Is this location secure and encrypted?\n\nA: Versions are stored on the same physical / logical volume as the original.\nThis Q&A has all the technical details, but in short, look in the root user owned folder /.DocumentRevisions-V100 on each volume. If you create a disk image, the user that mounts the disk image normally owns the /Volumes/whatever/.DocumentRevisions-V100 directory where changes to documents on that volume are stored.\n\n\n*\n\n*Do OS X Lion's Versions and Resume features store the cached data for encrypted .sparsebundle images in a secure way?\nSo - if that volume is FileVault encrypted (or a secure disk image) then the version is as secure as the original.\nWhen you copy a file by attaching it, you only send the current saved copy - not any previous versions - so then again - it's only as secure (or not) as the medium into which you send that file.\nSo - versions doesn't do any additional encryption and it's really up to each application to decide whether it enables or disables versions and whether the data it writes is also obfuscated / encrypted - but the presence of versions neither adds nor subtracts security to a system.\n", "Q: How do I create a network automount with Open Directory in 10.8 Server?

How do I create a network automount with Open Directory in 10.8 Server?\n\nA: You can use the Directory Editor that is part of Directory Utility (in /System/Library/CoreServices) to add a new automount record. I recommend using the existing record as a template for your new mounts.\n\nThe image above references the Mounts container in the /Local/Default node.

My guess is that OS X fails to play an alert sound, and falls back to the visual cue.\n\nA: I had the same thing happen - the setting in Accessibility->Audio is turned off, but the screen flashes anyway. \nI wonder if it has something to do with using LogMeIn. It has a long-standing bug of not switching your audio output/input device back to the built-in speaker/mic after a remote session closes. During the session, sound is routed through a special \"device\" that transmits the sound in/out to the machine controlling the computer. When the session ends, it should revert the audio in/out device back to what it was before the session, but usually fails to do that. The bug has been reported to LogMeIn for years, but apparently they don't plan to fix it, and won't respond on the bug reports. \nThat's why I wonder if this could be a related issue, although I hadn't seen it happen before today.

So, I backed up to Time Machine as usual, then wiped the HD and restored from Time Machine. Except I excluded the Applications folder so that I could pick only the ones I wanted to carry over to the newly restored HD.\nEverything went fine. Except now when it tries to back up I get an error message:\nThis backup is too large for the backup disk. The backup requires XXX.XX GB but only XX.XX GB are available.\nTime Machine needs work space on the backup disk, in addition to the space required to store backups. Open Time Machine preferences to select a larger backup disk or make the backup smaller by excluding files.\nIt seems that when I restored and then backed up, it treated that like a new computer and parsed out the HD space because when I open Time Machine I can only see the back-ups since I restored. But given that it's telling me there isn't enough room, I'm fairly certain they're still in there somewhere.\nCan anyone tell me how I might access those old back-ups and in turn delete some of the older ones so I have enough space for my new ones? I have looked in the files and found the backups.backupbd file, but I'm concerned that is only for the newest one in there so I don't want to delete that one. Obviously, I no longer have \"access\" to the previous Mac as it's been overwritten.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: To see these backups, you need the Browse Other Backup Disks by Alt/Option-clicking the Time Machine icon in your Menubar, or by control-clicking (right-clicking) the Time Machine icon in your Dock.\n", "Q: How can I see the phone number dialed after I initiate a call? In the Phone app (iPhone 5, iOS 6.1.2), I click on a contact's number, the call is initiated and starts ringing. \nFor a brief moment at this point, the label of the number (home / work / etc…) is displayed alongside the contact's name, but it quickly is removed and replaced with the call timer counting up and only the name (and picture of the contact) are shown.\n \nHow can I see the number that is being called during a phone call?\n\nA: You can't - in a straight-forward way. \nThe best work-around is to tap the \"Contacts\" button on the call screen. This will bring up your list of contacts which you can then select to see the number(s).\nThe good news: iPhone remembers you position in the contacts when you initiated the call so you don't have to scroll down all the way from \"A\" contacts.\nThe bad news: Hopefully you don't have more then one number for a contact. If you do (and most probably do), there is no way to know which of those 2 or 3 numbers you choose when you called the contact.\nInterestingly enough, iPhone is nice enough to tell you which (of several under a single contact you are calling) number you are calling when you add a second call. Apparently as of iOS 6.1.3, iPhone no longer does this.\n\nA: The obvious solution to this isn't palatable due to the amount of work you'd need to do for each contact, but it's to change the way you use the name fields. \nSpecifically, do not add a second contact number for any contact you must know this information.\nSo, if you presently have me as a contact:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mike B - work, mobile, home\n\n\nYou would duplicate the contact (optionally linking them or storing them in different groups or even different iCloud accounts) and have three for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*@Home Mike B\n\n*@Work Mike B\n\n*@Mobile Mike B\n\n\nAgain, you have first and last name fields that iOS 6 shows. Furthermore, you would likely come up with a code to shorten @Home to a single character or digit. Finally, I see a legitimate use for emoji.\n\n\n*\n\n* Mike B\n\n* Mike B\n\n* Mike B\n\n\nBased on your preference, you could pick color, shape, density to be very obvious or you could make it very subtle.\n\n\n*\n\n*✖ ➖ ❯\n\n\nNow, this is an awful suggestion if you implement it for all contacts due to the multiplication of work to set it up and then maintain as things change. Worse, if all contacts are tagged, you will have that character or name bleed into other situations. \nHowever, if you only had a few people you needed to know and only tagged their \"alternate\" numbers and made no other data be in that card, the chance you'd address a Mail envelope or share that contact card would be low and manageable.\n\nA: Add the numbers in front of the name.\nIf you want to slow down and have a longer display whom you are calling, add a \"pause\" after the number.\n\nA: Enter a phone number in the dialer like you normally would.\nTap and hold the * key until you're able to select a comma (,).\nAfter the comma, add the extension.\nSave the number into your contacts.\n\nA: To see the telephone number, press EDIT, then press the number.\n\nA: Go into settings, then go into text,now move the slide bar to the left to make your text smaller.  You can leave the bold setting if you like.  Now when you go into your contacts, the entire phone number will display.  Leaving the slide bar in the center is default and works best.\nIf your text size is too large, only a few digits appear under the contact name and when you attempt to see the entire number by pressing it or sliding it from right to left, the phone number dials.\nHope This Helps\n", "Q: How do I permanantly disable zoom feature when taking screenshots/screencapture (cmd+shift+4)? Recently made a jump to Mountain Lion and it appears Apple added a feature to the screenshot function (cmd+shift+4) that zooms in when it is a small screenshot. It's a pain and I want to disable it permanently. Is there any way I can do this?\nExample screenshot\n\n\nA: The screengrab taken on the “normal” unscaled display has the correct pixel dimensions along with a DPI (Dots per inch) of 72, which has been the standard DPI on Macs for a very long time. The screengrab taken on the Retina display, however, is much larger, with a proportionately higher DPI. This makes sense, due to the way OS X handles scaling on the Retina display.\nSo, even though the image appears “normal” size on a Retina screen, it’s actually being rendered at the higher DPI / larger size and scaled down. When the OS X screencapture utility is used to take a screen grab, it captures the image at the higher DPI and resolution. And when that image is uploaded to be viewed on the web, it is way too big.\nSeems the solution is http://www.retinacapture.com/\n", "Q: How do I change the order in which login items execute under OS X 10.8.2?

I am trying to set up an internet sharing on my Mac so I can have a 'temporary hotspot' with lesser security so I can connect a DS to the internet when I want it, without changing my router's security settings.\nThe problem arises is that while I'd be sharing my connection over Wi-fi, the way the house router gets to my computer is through Wi-fi. Is it possible to jury-rig the system so that the computer can both connect to the internet router, and re-broadcast / share that internet connection to other WiFi clients, from the same AirPort card?\n\nA: In short, not likely to be possible using a single Airport card.\n99% of the time when a workstation's WiFi card connects to a standard wireless access point, it does so in WiFi \"client\" mode, which has certain physical (i.e. radio-frequency) requirements. \nWhen operating in \"client\" mode, your workstation's WiFi card cannot act as a repeater or quasi-router for other clients. (\"Ad Hoc\" wifi mode can support multiple simultaneous connections to different devices, but Ad Hoc and Client modes are mutually exclusive.) \n\nWhat should work fine is for you to add a second, separate WiFi interface to your Mac, for example a USB-to-WiFi adapter. (cheap, $19! And no, I don't work for OWC.) \nThat independent WiFi interface can then be separately configured for Internet sharing to give your DS (or other devices) a \"temporary hotspot\" connection.

How come Dropbox gets a non-generic icon in Finder's sidebar, when other directories like Google Drive and Sites (native in OS X before Lion) all have the same generic one?\n\nHow can I customise the icons used by the folders in the sidebar? OS X used to show individual icons of all folders there — not any longer.\n\nA: As you've noticed, recent versions of OS X only display generic folder icons in the sidebar. So why does Dropbox get special treatment?\nThe short answer is that Dropbox uses undocumented API to accomplish this. In non-technical speak, it's a special hack that's installed by the Dropbox application.\n\nSome curious folks on StackOverflow found the specific mechanism used by Dropbox: good ol' mach_inject.

It seems to be the same in iTerm.\n\nThe standalone Emacs.app works, but I'd rather not use it.\n \nIs there a mac terminal which supports multiple fonts?\n\nA: I don't think it'll be possible - terminal-based applications (as those running in terminal emulators like Terminal.app, iTerm.app, etc are) don't support multiple concurrent fonts. This is because a terminal application is written to run on a traditional dumb terminal which wouldn't have the concept of multiple fonts. Within a terminal emulator, all text is displayed in the same font and this is why the sidebar doesn't look as it should.\nThe only solution is to use a version of Emacs running under either Cocoa/Carbon (eg, Emacs.app or Aquamacs) or X11.\n", "Q: Moutain Lion - New line character in notification Do we have any newline character that we can insert in Mountain Lion's Notification Center.

While looking at iPad models, I notice several showing as (MM).\nIn particular, the 4th generation iPad mini with Cellular has models A1454 and \nA1455 with the latter being labeled (MM). The same exists for A1459/A1460 on the larger iPad with a Retina display.\nWhat does MM represent?\n\nA: I do not have a direct link or citation on/about Apple to prove my conclusion. But the most logical answer I could gather by reading several sites is that MM would stand for \"Multi-mode\", signifying that the iPad supports not just CDMA and GSM, but also multiple LTE implementations. The term \"multimode\" or \"multi-mode\" is used to designate chips/devices that support multiple, disparate communication technologies (a device with WiFi and Bluetooth can be called multimode too, but we're talking only about cellular here. Plus, all of Apple's iDevices have had WiFi and Bluetooth in all models).\n\n\n*\n\n*Only the GSM + CDMA + LTE models that support multiple carriers have the \"MM\" tag.\nExample: The 4th generation iPad and the iPad mini have models that support CDMA/GSM/LTE on Verizon and Sprint. So they're marked as \"Cellular (MM)\" to give them a more substantial (and carrier neutral) name.\n\n*The GSM + CDMA + LTE models in older generations that support only Verizon have a \"VZ\" tag instead of the \"MM\" tag.\nExample: The 3rd generation iPad, the first iPad to come with support for both CDMA and GSM on a single device, has a CDMA/GSM/LTE Verizon model, but it does not support Sprint. So it's marked as \"Cellular (VZ)\" to signify that it's tied to Verizon (and cannot work with another CDMA carrier like Sprint).\nIn Apple's current terminology:\n\"Cellular\" implies GSM+LTE\n\"Cellular (MM)\" implies GSM+CDMA+LTE (across CDMA carriers) \nNote that there is no \"CDMA only\" version of the iPad after the iPad 2, unlike \"GSM only\" versions that have been and continue to be available.\nYou can come to similar conclusions by comparing the cellular support across iPad models/generations and how they relate to the chipsets used, the carriers supported, and their technology implementations.  \nHere are some links related to the iPad specs across generations and multi-mode (as it applies to cellular technology) that would help understand my conclusion better.\nTechnical specifications for iPads of different generations (pay attention to the technologies/carriers supported):\n1. iPad (4th Generation) - Technical Specifications\n2. iPad mini - Technical Specifications\n2. iPad (3rd Generation) - Technical Specifications\n3. iPad 2 - Technical Specifications \nLinks related to multi-mode (read them completely or search for \"mode\" to go to multimode related snippets on these pages):\n1.

I'm not familiar with it, but here's the Wikipedia page. I'm an engineer dealing with cellular, so I'm actually gonna read this myself.\n\nA: In the iPhone 6 lineup, Apple uses these two terminologies in its GSX tech support website:\nMM: Multi-mode: i.e.: GSM + CDMA + FDD-LTE\nMM-TD: Multi-mode: i.e.: GSM + CDMA + FDD-LTE + TD-LTE\nEXAMPLES:\n•   IPHONE 6,MM-TD,128GB,GRAY A1586\n•   IPHONE 6,MM,128GB,GRAY A1549 \nFDD-LTE (Frequency Division LTE) is the LTE technology used most widely.\nTD-LTE (Time Division LTE) is now being implemented in countries such as China.\n\nA: The MM or Millenium Media according to what I can find, refers to the CDMA variation of the Cellular iPad for Verizon Networks.\nThe non MM version is for GSM carriers like AT&T.\nSource:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/5093889?start=0&tstart=0\n\nA: Millennial media.

I think I can get a reasonable replacement to iTunes DJ with smart playlists, but the one thing that is killing me is the new MiniPlayer.  \nThe two issues I have with it are that it doesn't show the time remaining in my track, and that it doesn't scroll long track names (except once at the beginning of the track).  \nNow, if it is indeed possible to do this, I'd love to hear how, but I am not very hopeful.  \nAre there any good MiniPlayer replacements out there? The only ones I found were for Windows.  I'd just like some kind of small persistant window that shows me what is playing in iTunes.\n\nA: Cover Sutra has a nice player bezel, which, while larger than the iTunes MiniPlayer, has more info (such as a progress bar). If it was smaller, and offered the ability to change the color (it's black), I'd want to keep it visible all the time.\n\nA: You Control: Tunes can be found here: http://www.yousoftware.com/tunes/\nYou can also check Skip Tunes here: http://skiptunes.com\n\nA: I just realized that one of the programs I've already been using has a partial solution to this.

Instead, the type looks to be 6 point and stretches all the way across the screen, appearing as though I don't know how to format and compose a letter.\nI've selected the correct font and type size - 12 point Times New Roman, but I cannot seem to effect any formatting on the mail page itself.\nCan someone help?\n\nA: The easiest solution is that you shouldn't use Word to compose your email.  Use Apple Mail, or Outlook:Mac, or whatever your email program is.\nWhy is this?\n\n\n*\n\n*Email is formatted using HTML.  Word produces very bad HTML that is highly likely to not look the way that you want it to, especially when you send it to someone else.  \n\n*There are two ways that font sizes are displayed: in points and in pixels.  The world has mostly settled on points for specifying font sizes.  When you see that there's a huge difference in font size when someone responds to your mail, it's because their mail program thinks that your font size was in points when it was actually in pixels (or the other way around).  \n\n\nIf you're using Word because you really want specific formatting that is possible in Word but that you can't do when trying to format it that way in your email application, this probably means that the formatting that you want to use isn't appropriate for email.  You should either use formatting that is appropriate for email (which doesn't extend far beyond choosing from a handful of fonts and font sizes, as well as some basic formatting like bulleted lists and bold/italic), or you should send your highly-formatted item as an attachment (either a Word document, if you're sure that your recipient has Word, or a PDF).  \n", "Q: Safari blocks all UK websites?

Safari generates a \"Failed to Open Page / Safari cannot connect to server\" error. It's as if the entire range of servers in the UK have been denied.\nYet if I use Chrome or Firefox, no problem; UK sites pop open without issue, so it's likely not a system issue (etc/hosts).

My Time Machine drive is getting disk errors. I used Disk Utility and ran \"Repair Disk\" on my Time Machine partition (NOT the drive) and I got the error \"Incorrect number of directory hard links\" including hundreds of related errors that look like \"Indirect node 41745332 needs link count adjustment\". The final line of the verification says \"Error: Disk Utility can’t repair this disk. Back up as many of your files as possible, reformat the disk, and restore your backed-up files.\"\nSo, if I get a second drive to copy my Time Machine backups to, can I just move the backups to the new drive by performing a simple \"copy\" operation as outlined here? Or should I use Disk Utility to clone the partition? And if I do one of these steps, would the errors copy over as well or would they be fixed on the new drive?\n\nA: It sounds like you might be out of luck if Disk Utility was unable to repair your partition. You are also correct that a clone of your Time Machine partition would copy over the problem to a new drive. It is probable that your best \"solution\" at this point would be to erase the partition and start Time Machine backups again. If you end up doing this I would also make sure to run \"Verify Disk\" on your internal HDD (or SSD if that's what you have) to make sure there aren't any errors there, either. \nThis might be a symptom of a failing drive; however, it is also possible that it might simply be a bunch of directory errors that can be repaired if you boot from a recovery partition, clone, or use another Mac to repair. I have had both dying drives and drives that looked like they were dying, but were actually just errors piled on one another. Before you throw the drive away, try repartitioning. Do systematic checks with Disk Utility and keep an eye on system logs (either in Console.app or /var/logs/system.log). If you continue to see the same problem, then it is indeed time for a new backup drive; however, you might find that a quick erase fixes the issue. \nAlso, see this article over at Pondini.org. The article essentially corroborates what I've already said, but the rest of the site is an excellent resource for all the headaches that Time Machine can throw your way. \nSorry you have a bunk backup - hope you get it sorted without much extra trouble!\n\nA: I ended up following the instructions in the article I linked to in my original post to move my Time Machine backups to a new drive. It took 28 hours to transfer 1.9 TB of backups. I then ran Disk Utility \"Verify Disk\" on it and it was good. So, the errors did not transfer over.\nSo now, I can just repartition the old drive to get rid of all the errors, which I will do after a few days of ensuring that this copy of my backups is indeed good.\nI later tested the transferred backup by reformatting my iMac and restoring from the TM backup, and it worked fine (I'm on it now).\n\nA: I don't like: \"I ended up following the instructions in the article I linked to in my original post to move my Time Machine backups to a new drive\".\nThe instructions on how to copy TM backups is intended for copying known good backups.  It sounds like your backup is NOT known good.  You now have a valid file and block structure on the new volume, but how do you know that the data (i.e. the content of files) is correct?  If the data on the old volume had errors, then you will have copied the errors to the new disk.\nIf you have any doubts about the old disk (and it sounds like you have), then do a new TM backup to the new drive.  Then you can be confident that you have a good backup of your system in case you have a disaster.\nIn summary:\nNever use a doubtful disk for backup - it is what you rely on in the event of loss of your main disk.\nNever copy doubtful data to a new disk and expect it to be correct.\nThis really is the same as soxman's advice.  But I was alarmed that you may now have bad data in TM, but think that it is ok.\n\nA: I would get a brand new drive and start backing up to it.\nThe existing drive might deliver a perfect copy of your backup files, but since Time Machine uses hard links, I'd hate for the one copy of an important backup file to look like it's there and in reality be gone or corrupt.\nYour drive has corruption and if it didn't hold potentially the only copy of your backup data, you would just wipe the drive and try again. Many times, these errors are an accounting error and starting fresh lets a physically fine drive work. It's strike one, and if that drive gets more errors, you would send it in for service / warranty exchange or put it on a shelf.\nIn the case of backups, I am more quick to retire a flakey drive and start anew. With 3 TB USB 3 drives going for about $100 US, it's silly to waste too much time and effort on a flakey drive - especially if your backups are at risk.\n", "Q: SystemUIServer and other processes crash repeatedly on login I don't know what I did wrong (it could have been related to rebuilding the Launch Services database), but yesterday after I restarted, multiple processes (like SystemUIServer, NotificationCenter, Alfred, and TextEdit) kept crashing on launch or repeatedly.

The Emoji keyboard might have the tab key buried in their \"600+ unicode symbols\".  Additionally, this Unicode Map app that allows copying of unicode characters into the copy-buffer also might have support for the tab key. If neither of those apps have what you want, try contacting the developers, as it would be a trivial change to add support for the tab character.\nOne other potential solution just came to mind: try creating a document in Evernote or the Notes app that contains a tab character generated on your computer. See if you can copy-and-paste this character.\n\nA: I recomend you to use a Sourcecode editing App like Textastic which has a Tab Key.\n\nA: Get TextExpander. It's an app for osx and ios that let's you type predefined bits of text with text shortcuts.

I recently had data loss because the hard drive was completely used up by virtual memory and some programs couldn’t handle zero free space on the hard drive. How can I prevent this from happening (besides always keeping a few GB as a buffer)?\n\nA: I can propose you one way to do that, although it is not complete.\nYou can set memory limit per process using launchctl limit (see the man page). However this is per process not system wide.\nIn real life, few processes are consuming vast amount of memory. Therefore, I would advise you to look at Activity Monitor output and see which are the process consuming the most. Count the ones that are using more than 20% of your RAM. How many such processes do you have? Let's assume n and assume that you have m GB of RAM. How much maximum swap space do you want to use? Let's assume s GB of swap.\nI would do the following calculation: (m + s - 1) / n = <max memory per process in GB>\nConvert the GB into B: <max memory per process in GB> * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 = <max mem per proc in B>\nNow try this limit and see if it works (note, this setting will be lost after a reboot, so it is \"safe\" to perform):\nsudo launchctl limit rss <max mem per proc in B> <max mem per proc in B + 1073741824>\n\nIf you are happy with this choice, then you can save them, so they are permanent. Edit the file /etc/launchd.conf and add:\nlimit rss <max mem per proc in B> <max mem per proc in B + 1073741824>\n\n", "Q: Can't access Mail or Mail setttings on iphone 4 + iOS 6.1.2 Since the upgrade to iOS 6, I've been unable to access my mail on wi-fi, cellular or disconnected. \nThe symptoms are:\n\n\n*\n\n*The mail button icon shows '1'\n\n*When clicking on te mail app icon, it attempts to open up the app, then it times out and goes back to the home screen\n\n*When clicking on settings -> Mail, Contacts, and Calendars, the phone gets stuck and times out then goes back to the home screen.\n\n\nA: First, force-quit Mail.app. To do this: Go to your home screen. Double-click the home screen. Locate Mail.app in the bottom bar that appears. Press and hold Mail.app until the icons wiggle. Delete Mail.app from the bottom bar by clicking red X.\nTry again to launch Mail. If this doesn't work, reset the iPhone by pressing and holding power and home buttons for 10 seconds. Restart device once it shuts off.\n\nA: *\n\n*you could try this, though it's unlikely since you can see the mail icon\n\n\n*\n\n*Try going to the Settings.app.\n\n*Once inside: General>>\n\n*scroll down and select \"Restrictions\" (this is at the bottom\n\n*Make sure Mail is both 'allowed' ('On') and that Restrictions are disabled, unless you want them enabled. (Restrictions are disabled if all your apps are light in color/unsaturated (grayed out), and the button at the top of the screen reads \"Enable Restrictions\").\n\n\n*second, you could do a factory reset/restore, then restore from your latest or last known good backup. Hopefully your mail messages exist in such a way that you can reset/restore without losing anything. (Depends on mail settings. If you are using POP and you have unsent drafts you will likely lose them. If you are using IMAP you should be fine, but I can't guarantee this.\n\n*I would definitely do the steps bispymusic suggested. \n\n*to clarify,\n\n*\n\n*Using the \"Slide to power off\" then holding both buttons to turn the device back on is called a 'Restart', and is considered more topical.\n\n*Holding both buttons while the device is on until the logo shows up again is called a 'Reset' and is used for more severe ('deeper') issues that don't go away after a 'Restart'.\n\n\n", "Q: Ethernet bridging Mac Mini I would like to be able to use my home server (2012 Mac Mini) as a OpenVPN client with two network interfaces.  My plan is to connect a small switch with an Apple TV and Roku to one thunderbolt ethernet port and then connect the internal ethernet port to my wider network for internet access, sort of like this;\nApple TV 3>>>\n              dumb switch >>> eth1 >>> Mac Mini > OpenVPN > eth0 >>> fibre router\nRoku 2 XS >>>\n\nAny ideas what I would need to do to make this work?\n\nA: Mostly, you can just overload the one ethernet hardware port with two or more IP settings. As long as your switch can handle things, this works the simplest.\nOr you could drop an thunderbolt to ethernet adapter on the back of the Mac Mini and have two hardware interfaces to let the Mac Mini sit between the two networks and route as needed. You would run OpenVPN on the adapter en0 which connects to fiber.\nAll of this is controllable over the normal system preferences for networking but I've been able to accomplish all of what you describe without needing the unix command line. Just drag the default route interface to the top of the service order listing and you should be good to go.\n", "Q: Aperture and Rosetta problem I've had to buy an older Intel Core Duo Macbook to replace a stolen one. I've installed Aperture 2.1 from an old disc. It won't open, I get a message saying something like: \"You can't use this version of Aperture with this version of Mac OS X. You have Aperture 2.1.\" I'm running 10.6.8.\nI rang Apple, the reply was 'it won't run on your machine, there's nothing you can do. But I can make it work for you it will cost £35.' I declined that offer. I have an Imac running Snow Leopard with Aperture 2.1 running OK.\nI've tried to install Rosetta (to see if that would open Aperture)from my Snow Leopard install disc. I get a message telling me the installation was successful, but I can't find it anywhere on my hard drive. Any ideas?\n\nA: Running Aperture under Rosetta will be a painful experience.  It will not be swift.\nNote also that working with different versions of aperture on a common library is a good way to get corruption.  Apple doesn't recommend running aperture on non-local disks either.  I've tried it, and while pictures are present, seaches return far too few results.\nIf you bought Aperture through the App Store, you should be able to unlist your stolen mac at the store, and install it on your newer mac for no charge.  If the current old mac book won't run the current aperture version, then I think that there are older versions on the Mac web site. \nFinally, once you authorize the new laptop on the app store, you can just share the apps folder from your iMac, and drag and drop the Aperture.app folder from the older iMac to your laptop.\n", "Q: Automator turning well-aligned PDF documents upside-down, flipped -- unreadable in OSX? \nI have PDFs that are readable.

I have fixed this issue manually in Preview app but I would like to get the pages as they are originally in their documents. How can I get the PDFs right-combined i.e. readable?\n\nA: It must be how you have the PDFs that you want to combine. I have this exact same workflow as an app and it works great and perfectly. However if you have several PDFs that are not all the same orientation then it will do what is happening. \nI don't see any other way of doing it other then manually opening up each one in Preview and using Command L or R to change the right orientation.\nPhil\n", "Q: Specification of MagSafe power adapter coaxial cable? Does anyone know what type/specification of coaxial cable is used from the transformer brick to the MagSafe connector in the A1343 power supply? \nThe cable from my 85W MagSafe power adapter to my MBP (the cable from the transformer brick to the MagSafe connector) has been chewed pretty badly by my cat, and is now unusable. The break is near exact center on the length of the cable. I've found a fair amount of information out there that I can repair the cable by soldering the center conductor and braided outer conductor back together, but I'm wondering whether I could source a proper coaxial cable splice kit for it. \nHere's what I've determined so far, from cutting apart my damaged cable:\n\n\n*\n\n*outer jacket diameter appears to be 0.130 inches, +/- 0.005 in.\n\n*next layer is a shield conductor, OD ~ 0.085\" +/- 0.005\", which appears to be made up of two layers of silver-colored fine metal wire (feels like silver-plated copper but can't tell for sure). These are NOT woven like larger coax, but rather are two layers in a spiral-wrap around the dielectric insulator, wrapped in opposite directions.\n\n*dielectric insulator is .070\" +/- 0.003\", white in color, unknown material but feels like PTFE. \n\n*Center conductor is fine stranded (strand count appears to be 50-100 as a guess), same material as the shielding. Looking at the cross-section of the center conductor gives a distinct appearance of copper color, strengthening my feeling that this is silver-plated copper. Diameter appears to be .045\" (1.143 mm, or about 17 AWG) but I can't be positive as the thin strands won't maintain form in a caliper. \n\n*Most independent information I've seen mentions a fabric or other type of \"string\" somewhere in the shielding (presumably for end-to-end strain relief), but I wasn't able to locate it.\n\n\nI can't seem to find any source for this, or even specs for it. Still, it seems strange to me that Apple would manufacture a custom cable gemometry just for these power adapters?\n\nA: Apple's Magsafe technology is patent-protected, and there's a good chance they used a custom-manufactured cable to make it even more difficult for 3rd parties to sell cheap relacements.\nIfixit has a page describing How to Repair a MagSafe connector which may be of use to you.

I just bought a refurbished MacBook (through a reputable retailer) and 3rd party external drive for Time Machine backups. There are no install discs and my concern is that after the warranty ends (90 days) if I need to reinstall the OS, I will have to purchase Snow Leopard (it has 10.6).\nSo, how would I reinstall OS X since I received no installation media?\n\nA: There are plenty of ways around this dilemma:\nMethod 1: Upgrade to OS X Mountain Lion. You'll get loads of new features, and the all-new Recovery partition so you won't need discs. It should be free if your retailer was Apple Certified via the Apple Up-to-Date Program.\nMethod 2: Contact the reputable retailer. They should give you the original discs if you ask for them.\nMethod 3: Ask if you can borrow a friend's disc if you ever need it in the future.\nMethod 4: Contact Apple. I'm sure that if you describe your situation, they'll give you the SL discs at least.\nMethod 5: Purchase Snow Leopard. It's only $20, and it'll give you peace of mind if that's what you really want. You could buy it with the money you saved buying the refurbished Mac in the first place.\nWhen you get your Mountain Lion/Snow Leopard installer, make sure you make a USB flash drive backup of it and keep it safe.\nFor Mountain Lion see here: Create a Bootable Mountain Lion USB Key Installer\nFor Snow Leopard see here: How to Create a Mac Snow Leopard USB Installer Disk\n", "Q: Automator treating App Packages as folders Automator treats .app files (Application Packages) as if they were folders. This might be useful in some instances, but for what I want to do - Periodically make a list of the contents of my Applications folder - it is extremely frustrating.\nI just want a list of all the applications I have. I made a two step workflow, with \"Get Folder Contents\" and \"New Text File\". This would work perfectly, if not for the fact that I have a number of subfolders in the Applications folder with apps in there (for organization/sanity purposes).\nIn theory, this would be solved by checking the \"Repeat for each subfolder found\" option in the \"Get Folder Contents\" Action, but this gives me a huge problem: it lists every single file in each App Package, which I'm sure you'll understand is totally useless for my purposes.\nAny Ideas?\n\nA: Try this AppleScript:\ntell application \"Finder\" to get name of every file of folder (path to applications folder)\n\nCarlos figured this part out himself:\nset appsPath to (path to applications folder)\ntell application \"Finder\"\n\nset appList to name of every application file of entire contents of folder appsPath \n    end tell\n\nA: This AppleScript should search /Applications recursively and return a list of all the applications, just as adayzdone's AppleScript does. It doesn't search inside Application Containers - I've tested this myself. A downside is this does rely on Spotlight, and so if Spotlight is disabled, you won't get anything out of this. Not many people even disable Spotlight on a Mac anyway...but I ramble. Here's the code:\nset ssRslt to (do shell script \"mdfind -onlyin /Applications kMDItemFSName == '*.app'\")\nset {oldDelims, my text item delimiters} to {my text item delimiters, {return}}\nset ssRslt to (text items of ssRslt)\nset my text item delimiters to oldDelims\nreturn ssRslt\n\nIn short, the script searches for /Applications files via Terminal, changes this to a list, and returns the result.\n", "Q: How often are new iPod touch versions released?

I want to know this as I sometimes leave my iPhone unattended while syncing and I want to make sure that there's no cut off to the iPhone sync.\n\nA: Your MacBook shouldn't go to sleep while iPhone sync is in progress.  iTunes' sync needs to copy files from your Mac to the iOS device, and vice-versa. In either case, your Mac is accessing the hard drive.\nRefer to Mac OS X: Why your Mac might not sleep or stay in sleep mode – Apple Support.

Using OS X 10.6.8 and Word 2011 for Mac. I have developed a Word document template for a client which is used for surveys.  Each time the document is used, it has a different property address.  Is there a way of linking the address which appears in the main part of the text on the Front Page to the centre section of the header on the following pages so that you only have to type it in once?\nEg:\nFront page says:\n\n20 Feb 2013 Survey for Mr & Mrs Bloggs, 23 Anytown Street, Anytown\nOn the following pages it says:\nBriggs & Co                (   )                                 Page\n  1\nI want it to say is:\nBriggs & Co       (   )             23 Anytown Street, Anytown      ( \n  )         Page 1\nBriggs & Co       (   )             23 Anytown Street, Anytown      ( \n  )         Page 2\n\netc\nAt the moment I have to type the address in the header of each new section (there are nine sections!). I need a macro or hyperlink or something which will pick up the address on the front page and automatically insert it in the centre section of the header on the following pages.\nAny ideas? \n\nA: There are many different ways to accomplish this, but I think that the easiest is through Document Properties.\nIn your document, go to File -> Properties.  In your case, I'd probably create a new Custom Property.  Here, I've called it \"Address\", given it the type \"text\", and entered in the address of 23 Anytown Street, Anytown.  Click OK when you've completed this.\n\nBack in your document, place the cursor where you'd like this text to appear.  Then go to Insert -> Field, select \"Document Information\" in the left list, then \"DocProperty\" in the right list, and finally enter (with quotes!) \"Address\" below, and click OK.  Repeat this anywhere that you want the address to appear.\n\n", "Q: Delete Key on Apple KeyBoard Deleting only 1 char at a time I used to delete characters continuously by pressing my delete key on apple keyboard but for some reason now I can not do it. I have to release and press again to delete the previous character.\nFor example:\nIf I have a line like \"This is a text to delete\". In the past, I will just place my cursor at the end of the sentence.. e.g after delete and keep pressing delete key until the entire sentence is removed. Now, I have press the delete key and release for every character.\nI have set keyboard setting to default but still see the same issue.\nAny ideas?\nThanks, Rj\n\nA: Go to settings - keyboard - key repeat, change to fast - delay until repeat, change to short. \n\nA: This might be a setting in your keyboard system preferences panel.  Try adjusting your Key Repeat setting as shown:\n\n\nA: Reducing the Delay Until Repeat to short will also reduce the wait before the cursor starts moving.\nAlternative Method: Holding down the option key while hitting delete enables you to delete a word at each press (except for punctuation). \n\nA: go to settings.  click on keyboard icon.  under on screen key board, look for filter keys and turn it off.  \n", "Q: Mount SMB share without 2GB filesize limit on OSX Lion I want to mount a network attached drive onto OSX Lion with Samba.\nUsually I do this in Finder with \"Go>Connect to Server\" and type \"smb://192.xxx.xx.xxx\" in the Server Adress field, however doing this i ran into a problem with transfering files larger than 2GB (SMB limit).\nTo bypass this issue I need to mount the drive with LFS (Large File Support), there are many posts online that show how to do this in terminal in Linux, but I cannot find nowhere how to do it in OSX. How can I do this?\nThanks!\n\nA: Since Lion, OS X does not come with Samba, but with another implementation of SMB/CIFS.\nOS X documentation does not have an option for large file.\nYou perhaps simply need to update your OS X installation. I have OS X Mountain Lion, and files of 3GB are copied over SMB without trouble. Either you need to upgrade to Mountain Lion or to a newer Lion release.\nOther possibility, your server does not support large file and needs an upgrade.\nPS: you should avoid cross-posting on multiple stack exchange sites at the same time.\n", "Q: How can I ensure only \"whitelisted\" applications run on OS X There is a security technique called whitelisting (available in Windows 7) that ensures that only specific applications and processes will run.\nThis is different from email whitelisting and only applies to applications running on an OS.\nHow can I implement whitelisting (apps) on OS X?\nFor example, I generally want to constrain apps to those allowed by the setting \"Mac App Store and identified developers\", but I would also like to run the IM app called Spark.  OS X refuses to run that app with this setting and reports that the app is \"damaged\".  I can change the setting to \"Anywhere\" and that will allow Spark to run.  The problem is that will also allow all apps to run, some of which I might regret.\n\nA: You can do this using the Allowed Apps settings in the Parental Controls System Preferences Control Panel:\n\n\nA: Go to System Preferences, then click on Security & Privacy. On the General tab, check Allow Applications Downloaded From: Mac App Store and Identified Developers.\n\n", "Q: Remove payment information from iOS I had connected my iPad mini to my net-safe card which creates a virtual debit card and lasts for 48 hours and automatically gets void after that for security purpose. But now I want to remove that information because the virtual card has expired but I am compelled to put some information. It does not have \"none\" option in payment method which most of the people say that it has. It is related to country?\n\nA: Finally got it.\nAs per @duci9y it takes approximately 3 days to complete transaction.\nSince my transaction wasn't complete, apple was forcing me to put my credit card details. When I put my credit card details the appropriate amount was deducted and then the option \"none\" was visible.\n", "Q: Sync iOS Notes with Exchange Why is it that I can sync Apple Notes with Exchange on Mountain Lion but not with iOS 6?\nIs there any way to sync iOS notes with Exchange like I can with iOS Reminders?\n\nA: iOS Notes only supports syncing with iCloud or an IMAP email account, according to their \nSyncing Notes support article.  \nIf your Exchange server allows IMAP access, you could create another account on your iOS device that only syncs the notes for your account.  You'll have to ask your Exchange admin whether they have enabled IMAP access and what the settings are for it.\nThere are a handful of iOS apps which claim to sync Exchange notes, but their reviews indicate that they're unreliable, and it doesn't appear that any of them support Exchange 2010 or 2013.  As of this writing, the IMAP workaround appears to be the best option.\n\nA: My experience is no - you cannot do this sort of note syncing with Exchange.\nI tried the IMAP option (for iOS to use the Exchange IMAP interchange functionality), unfortunately notes that I already had in exchange did not show on the iphone device.  New notes I entered from the iphone device did show up in exchange, but they were in message format, meaning you can open them and view them in outlook or owa, but you cannot edit them so it is only a one-way push as opposed to a true sync.  \nTo me, it looks like Apple is now doing what Microsoft has been criticized for doing, trying to force you to move toward using only their cloud services with their devices...\n\nA: This is my experience as well. However, I suspect the IMAP not being a viable method for syncing with Exchange is a bug as it worked in earlier editions of IOS.\nI have spent several days looking for workarounds or Apps (like TaskTask) to get around this. Unfortunately other than exporting to Evernote the only other viable solution at present is to transport your Notes into a mail folder and sync them as mail items rahter than Note items.\n\nA: I store all notes as _Note Name in contacts using the company field for the _Note Name.\nThey then perfectly sync everywhere and are searchable from contacts. Its the best solution and I've used it for years since moving off a BB.\n\nA: Gmail and its notes syncs perfectly with any number of ios notes apps and does so syncing both ways instantaneously. I use GoTasks. \n", "Q: Difference between du and Finder file sizes I was having a look at the size of libBLAS.dylib at some location in my Mac and du showed it's file size as 572K while the allocated file size (showed by Finder) was 1.4MB. I've read that the lack of sparse files on HFS+ can cause this discrepancy.\nMy question is that why would a compiled shared library need to be sparse - after all, it's not like anything is going to be modifying it.\n\nA: Difference is in units they use.\ndu uses BLOCKSIZE=4096 bytes by default (rounded  if Human Readable format option -h i.e. df -h)\nFinder uses BLOCKSIZE=1000 by default\n$du -h /usr/lib/libblas.dylib \n4.0K    /usr/lib/libblas.dylib\n\nand same in Finder.\n", "Q: iOS App Store gives me \"Cannot connect to the iTunes store” error message After updating to iOS 6 certain tabs in my app store give me an \"Cannot connect to the iTunes store” error message and the genuis tab is missing.\n\nA: Various sites have figured out how to fix this error message:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Go to Settings in your iPhone.\n  \n*Click on General.\n  \n*Go to Date and Time.\n  \n*Change Set Automatically to Off.\n  \n*Go to Set Date & Time.\n  \n*Click on Today’s Date.\n  \n*Move the year one year forward one year.\n  \n*Launch app store, should have no errors\n  \n*Go back to Settings, General, Date and Time, and change Set Automatically to on\n  \n\n", "Q: Is there an app that lets me send email only? I'm looking for an app that will let me send email only.  Often in the course of my work I need to just fire off a quick email but don't want to get stuck firing up my mail client and reading new email.\nThe closest I've seen is QuickMailer, but it just fires up Mail.app and sends an email using that... then keeps Mail.app open.  \nI want a UI like QuickMailer's, but an app that sends the email right away without using Mail.app.\nDoes anything like this exist?\n\nA: Command line will do the trick (with some configuration). You will need to set it up to use your Google account authentication (I noted you tagged the question with \"gmail\" so I am assuming that's your provider).\nThis site has the details on how to set it up. If you use two-step authentication with your account just create an application password for command line and use that token when adding in SASL password.\nThis setup works well but won't handle attachments. If you need to send a file, you'll probably have an easier time using the Mail GUI.\nHowever, your problem is that you don't want to open a program to send a message, correct? Because this requires you to have Terminal open, or to open Terminal when you need to send. But it would be fairly easy to knock together an Applescript that will prompt you for destination address, subject, and text of email, then bounce that directly to the shell and exit. Throw this into your user scripts folder and make sure your Mac is configured to show Scripts in the menu bar for quick access.\nSecond Edit: Updated the applescript to work a little more efficiently; uses the code from here to write the message body to a temp file in your home directory, then simply uses cat to read the file contents into an email message, and finally deletes the temp file. I tested it and it works well even with characters that were mishandled by the original script.\ntry\n    display dialog \"Send email to:\" default answer \"email@domain.com\"\n    set theEmail to (text returned of result)\n    if theEmail is \"email@domain.com\" then error \"No recipient specified!\"\n\n    display dialog \"Email subject:\" default answer \"Subject\"\n    set theSubject to (text returned of result)\n    if theEmail is \"Subject\" then error \"No subject specified!\"\n\n    display dialog \"Message:\" default answer ¬\n        \"Enter message text\" & return & return & return & return\n    set theBody to (text returned of result)\n\n    set this_file to (((path to home folder) as text) & \"message.tmp\")\n    my write_to_file(theBody, this_file, true)\n\n    do shell script \"cd ~/; cat message.tmp | mail -s \\\"\" & theSubject & \"\\\" \" & theEmail & \"; rm message.tmp\"\n\non error theError\n    display dialog theError buttons {\"Quit\"} default button 1\nend try\n\n-- this subroutine saves input as a text file\non write_to_file(this_data, target_file, append_data) -- (string, file path as string, boolean)\n    try\n        set the target_file to the target_file as text\n        set the open_target_file to ¬\n            open for access file target_file with write permission\n        if append_data is false then ¬\n            set eof of the open_target_file to 0\n        write this_data to the open_target_file starting at eof\n        close access the open_target_file\n        return true\non error\n        try\n            close access file target_file\n        end try\n        return false\n    end try\nend write_to_file\n\n\nA: Co-author of QuickMailer here.\nWe just released QuickMailer 2.0 which has SMTP support.\nhttp://quickmailer.im\nThat would make it possible for you to bypass Mail.app and do exactly what you wanted.\n\nA: The closest thing I've found for writing a quick email is Mail Unread Menu. Donation-ware, lives in the menubar, alerts to new mail, show number of unread and more; technically a Mail plugin, has worked for me for years.\nYou would have to leave Mail running, background or hide or send to another desktop.\nAnd you do have to pull down Mail Unread Menu to select Compose New Mail. But handy nonetheless. \n\nA: I use Apple Mail. When I need to work without email distraction, I take all accounts offline (under the Mailbox menu). This lets me still send email without being distracted by incoming messages. \n\nA: Does your work involve a web browser already being open? Just type mailto: into its URL bar and your favorite mail client will open to a compose screen; even a web client, if your browser is set up to do that! Closing it again just takes a Cmd-Q (Cmd-W, if you were using a web client in a browser tab).  \n\nA: If you like the command line, you could just type the following into an app such as Terminal:\nmyserver> mail friend@some-domain.com\n\nA: If you put \"......\" in the \"incoming mail server\" you will be able to sent but not to receive mails in the Mail.app\n\nA: I have QikMsg in the AppStore, that does messages to Facebook, Twitter, Tencent, and Weibo.

I updated to iTunes 11.0.2 very recently, and I'm fairly certain this version specifically brought a change of wording regarding deleting songs from iCloud, and I'm curious if there's changed functionality to match.\n\nAfter perusing Apple's support documentation, it seems I was correct:\n\nI intend to replace the current version of this song, and figured the easiest way to ensure everything updates would be to delete the song from iCloud and my Library, and then import the new version.\nNow that the functionality of deleting songs has changed, how do I delete the song from both my local library and iCloud as well?\n\nA: No, the functionality hasn't changed. The first screen shot is what you see when you want to delete an item you have purchased. As part of \"iTunes in the Cloud,\" you can never delete those items, but you can hide them. Deleting from iTunes Match is the same, and that's the second dialog you show.\n\nA: This seems to be fixed in 11.0.4:\n\n\nA: I bieleive you are wanting to replace a copy of a song you have in your library and in iCloud. Using iTunes Match I ran into this problem. When you delete a song make sure you select delete from iCloud as well in the pop up to remove it from any device using iTunes Match at the same time.\n", "Q: How to move a Reminder from one list to another in iOS? There doesn't appear to be an option in Reminders to 'move to another list'\nIs it really just a case of copy and paste, which would be pretty terrible\n\nA: Using iOS 6.1.2 it is pretty straight forward (I have no older version of iOS with me to check how and if it works there, but I guess it will).\nTab on the task/reminder you would like to move to another list.

The user has their own account already added to their outlook. They have requested that a group mailbox could be added. I set it up in exchange gave the appropriate permissions, then added the mailbox in the user's outlook. It worked fine, they can send with the alias that was created. The only problem is, when they send from the alias (Lets call it design@domain.com) It shows up in their personal (user@domain.com) sent items folder. Is there a way to change it so that it shows up in the design@domain.com's sent items folder?\n\nA: On the client-side, no.  \nOn the server-side, there are updates to Exchange 2007 and Exchange 2010 that address this.\nIf there is some reason that you can't update your Exchange server, then you could get around this on the client-side with a bit of work.  If the senders BCC the design@domain.com address when sending mail from that account, you could have a server-side rule on design@domain.com which automatically moves mail that is BCCed to design@domain.com to the Sent Items folder.

I have some smart playlists defined thus:\n\n\n\ndesigned with the goal of being able to shuffle through all my podcasts and various other audio that I want to listen to.\nThis works splendidly in iTunes.\nHowever, when it syncs over to my 160 GB iPod Classic and I try to play the Playlist, instead of the 112 or so tracks that are currently in that Playlist showing up, only about 28 show up.\nWhat's interesting is that the Playlist's count is correct before you start playing a track, and it does in fact contain all the right songs. I can select any one of my Podcasts, but I can't have them play continuously and I can't shuffle them. Selecting any track other than a Podcast will shuffle through the remainder of my non-podcast material.\nNow I found one link awhile ago that told me that the problem was the Playlist being defined to include tracks whose Media Kind is Podcast. That apparently confuses the iPod classic. So I changed from doing that to using the Genre trick. That at least made the tracks show up. But it didn't make them shuffleable.\nAt this poin, I've discovered that I can play the Playlist straight through, but I can't shuffle it. As long as the iPod shuffle setting is set to none, the playlist when I try to play it will report 112 songs and will play them straight through. But this isn't what I want, I want it to randomly play through it.\nSo, is this possible to do?\n\nA: You must have tracks where the Skip when Shuffling tag is set. Look for some of the tracks that won't play, then select on in iTunes, press Command-I, and look on the Options tab. \nPodcasts have this set by default.\n", "Q: How to Run Shell Script upon Application Launch? Not sure if this belongs here or on SuperUser, but it's Mac specific, so I'll go with here.\nI wrote a Ruby script that edits TextMate's global properties file and changes the theme based on the time of day (light theme during the day, dark theme at night), and then launches TextMate.\nI then made an Automator app that runs that script. I called it TextMate, pasted in the flower icon, and put it in my dock instead of the actual TextMate app.\nThe script works, but the big obvious thing I overlooked is that the real TextMate is no longer in my dock, so whenever I click my Automator version, it runs, exits, and then TextMate appends itself to the running applications section of my dock, so I have two flower icons down there when the app is running. Another problem is that if I opened the app in any other way (like opening a file from Finder), the script won't run.\nSo, is there any way to attach my script to the actual app, or tell the system to do something any time TextMate opens, or tell TextMate to do something any time it opens?\n\nA: The third-party UI-scripting application Keyboard Maestro (KBM) can perform this function. (Along with many others.)\nI've been using KBM for 5 or 6 years, it's very stable and reliable.\nSee screenshot of sample KBM script:\n\n\nA: If this is really important, you could add:\ncmd = `open /Applications/TextMate.app`\n\n(Assuming that's where TextMate is located)\nat the end of your script. \nThat would tell the script to open TextMate after everything else has been run.\nThen you just run the script to open TextMate.\n", "Q: Removing profile settings from a profile that no longer exists At some point in the past, I installed Snappli. At some point later, I removed it. However, some part of Snappli is still installed, because ifconfig.me and whatsmyip both report that I'm being proxy'd through Snappli (see below):\nHow do I remove the Snappli proxy settings from my phone, even though the Profile is gone?\n\n\n\nA: My best tip would probably be to install the app again, with the profile and all of that, and then remove the profile again, then deleting the app and see if that helps.\nIt's hard to tell what might be causing the problem – you're sure there are no proxy settings in place anywhere and that the profile is deleted?\nEdit: It seems there are some ghost settings you're unable to change. Your best chance would be to reset all the network settings (Settings -> General -> Reset -> Reset Network Settings), or restoring your iPhone to factory settings.\n\nA: Just to confirm, you have gone into Settings > General and looked for a sub-section called Profiles? Proxy settings are set only through configuration profiles to my knowledge. If you see no section called \"Profiles\" then there are none installed.\nShort of that you may have a device corruption. In such a case I recommend you follow Emil's advice above to Reset Network Settings. In a worst-case scenario you can Restore as new (not from iCloud backup) to ensure everything is new, though hopefully you can avoid that.\n", "Q: Reverse tethering of Android device to OSX over WIFI or HOW TO Find OSX wifi sharing on an android device\nI have setup a mac mini (Mountain Lion) with internet sharing to devices using WIFI. My iPhone and iPod both see and can use the connection but none of the Android (Samsung, Nexus 4) can see it.\nAny hints as to how I can share the mac mini's internet access with an Android device?\nUPDATE getting the terminology right seemed to help my search.\nInstead of searching on WIFI Android, searching on Ad-Hoc nerwork android gave me\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1718053\nwhich I will try tomorrow - however I assume this only works if the network is visible\n\nStep 2 : Configuring the android device :\nNow, we will configure the android device to make it able to access this new adhoc network\n\nGo to setting on the menu of your device\nthen wireless and networks then wi-fi settings then activate wi-fi .\nRight click and choose advanced .\nCheck the \"Use static IP\"and fill in :\nip address: 192.168.137.5 (for example)\nGateway : 192.168.137.1\nNetmask : 255.255.255.0\nDNS 1: 192.168.137.1\nDNS 2 : 172.168.137.1\nthen right click and save.\n\n\nFinally, click on the adhoc network (and input password if you use WEP security) then connect.\n      And that's all ...enjoy internet with Google Play download supported...\n      If you encounter problems connecting ,try to disable then to reactivate wifi, else reboot your android device.\n\n\nA: My only experience with this issue was never resolved as Android at the time did not support ad-hoc networks.  According to this article, you may need to use 3rd-party software. \n\nA: Are you trying to use WEP encryption? A footnote in Snow-Leopard's setup dialog for sharing over WiFi says:\n3\n\nIf you plan to share your Internet connection with non-Apple\n  computers, use a 5 character password for a 40-bit WEP key,\n  and a 13 character password for a 13-bit WEP key.\n\nI just tested this with a Kindle Fire and it does make a difference. With 128-bit WEP and a shorter password it would not connect but connected OK with a 13-character password. I didn't need to set up a static IP or any other special configuration.\n", "Q: Removing Spotlight Is it possible to remove spotlight from the menu bar? I have too many menu bar items running all the time and I'm trying to remove what I can to see everything regardless of what app is open. \n\nA: You can do this by running a command in the terminal: sudo chmod 600 /System/Library/CoreServices/Search.bundle/Contents/MacOS/Search.  Then logout and back in.\nSource.\n", "Q: How do I setup access codes for shared printers? We've got a RICOH Aficio MP C4501 in our office that supports holding print jobs pending having a code input at the keypad (so sensitive documents don't print until you're able to be present to pick them up).  I'm not finding a way to set that code in the Apple print dialog, not even the setup dialog.  How do I go about using this codes feature on my Mac?\n\nA: Finally got a call back from RICOH.  It's under the \"Job Log\" drop-down menu in the print dialog.  User ID, password, codes, and controls (hold vs. locked), etc can all be set there!\n", "Q: Is there a faster app switcher than a keyboard shortcut linked to an Automator service? I want to switch apps faster than cmd-tab so I created an automator task to launch an app and linked to to a keyboard shortcut through the keyboard preferences. While this works okay without any third party software it is rather slow, not cmd-tab instant. Is there a fast way to switch to an app using a keyboard shortcut?\n\nA: I ended up getting Alfred's power pack and setup a hotkey there. It's much much faster than the automator service.\n\nA: It's not free, but you could try Keyboard Maestro and set up some macros. In fact, the first suggestion on their Example Macros page is to set up function keys to switch directly to your most used applications.\n\nA: Even on a very slow, older Mac, LaunchBar is blazingly fast for me.\n\nIt does far more than launch apps, but that's the core function of the tool and it's low resource, rock solid dependable, and ready to grow if you want more features.\n\nA: Try Apptivate, it worked perfectly for me: http://www.apptivateapp.com\nEspecially liked its \"quick peek\" feature.\n", "Q: Can the default contact store for Mountain Lion be iCloud? I'm struggling to manage duplicate contacts and would like to entirely and permanently disable the \"On My Mac\" category for contacts.\nI never, ever want a contact to be added to a Mac and not be stored in iCloud.\nHave I missed a setup step since I'm ending up missing contacts on my iOS devices when my Mac decides to store things locally instead of globally.\n\nA: You missed a step when setting up iCloud.\nOn each Mac, you can set the default account to be iCloud in the general preferences.\n\nNow, you'll need a short clean up to migrate all your incorrectly filed contacts. \n\n\n*\n\n*Select Accounts and temporarily disable each iCloud / Exchange / online account.\n\n*Then export all the \"On My Mac\" contacts to a vCard file and delete them (you have a backup of your Mac and if paranoid, a full export of all contacts before you delete things, no?)\n\n*Once things are clean, enable the default account, check that it's set like above, and drag the contacts onto the \"All bike@whatever\" \n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Import all the contacts, even if there are duplicates as you can then have Contacts look for duplicates and merge / update existing contacts as needed.\n\n*Once you've deleted all contacts from On My Mac and deselected it as the default, Contacts should hide that group from view and simplify your contacts going forward.\n\n*At this point, optionally enable other cloud contact sources and re-verify the default account.\n\n", "Q: Error copying large file to usb 16GB Thumbdrive Trying to copy a file (Win7_IE8.vhd) to a USB drive.\nThe file is 9.07GB in size according to my Mac file info.\nThe USB drive is 16GB.

This is its first use.\nI get:\nThe item \"Win7_IE8.vhd\" can't be copied because it is too large for the volume's format.\nHow can I overcome this issue to copy this file which seems like it should fit?\n\nA: The answer was that the default formatting was FAT32 which has a limit of 4GB per file.\nThe answer was to format the drive.  As I'm copying from Mac to Linux I chose the Ex-FAT format, all the better to interchange with.  I used the Disk Utility which is within a 'Utilities' folder which is itself at the bottom of the applications list.\n", "Q: Left Shift and Left Command combination yields only Left Command; other shift command combos work fine Early 2011 15\" Macbook Pro, Lion, no external keyboard or mouse:\nLately I noticed that I can't use left-shift+left-command together; it registers as left-command only.  The other three combinations (right-shift+right-command, right-shift+left-command, left-shift+right-command) work properly. I’ve confirmed this in text editors and in the keyboard viewer.\nSame problem appears with left-command+left-control.\nI’ve shut down all programs, verified no weird keybinds in Universal Access or elsewhere, even installed Lion to a clean external disk and booted from that.  The first thing I did was check left-shift and left-command in TextEdit; same problem.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I'm posting the non-answer of \"I reinstalled OSX and upgraded to Maverick from Lion, and it now works\" because, well, it now works.

Is it possible to change the timing manually of recorded keynote presentation instead of having to re-record the whole presentation because of one error?\nSometimes when I record a keynote presentation to my audio it can happen that on one slide I make a mistake of progressing to early with the animations, so it can be very discouraging having to record the whole presentation again only because I missed the timing on some slides.\nI suspect that keynote saves somewhere the time codes for when to progress to the next animation, because when exporting to a quicktime it seems that keynote has actually to run and record the whole slideshow again\n\nA: You can't do this in Keynote.  Keynote recording only allows for you to record the whole narration at once.  You could work around this by recording your audio in GarageBand, and then importing your GarageBand audio into Keynote.  GarageBand allows for much more finely-grained control of your recordings, including re-recording a section.  \nAnother option is to use PowerPoint:Mac, which does allow you to re-record the audio for one slide.  \n", "Q: Editing a color profile after calibration Is there a way to edit a color profile once you have finished calibrating the screen? I have a Dell S2340L, and after calibrating, I've noticed there is too much red in the greys. \nAm I able to adjust this without going through the whole calibration process again?\n\nA: I'd suggest tweaking the color balance on the monitor a bit. There should be a menu item to adjust color on the monitor itself. I suggest setting a custom color profile on the monitor rather then relying on the standard \"warm\"/\"cool\" type settings. (I have a Dell Ultra Sharp, and had to tweak this a few time before I got it right).\nIt's worth pointing out the calibration on most LCD/LED monitors can be very difficult since the color and contrast can change with the angle of view. While newer higher quality monitors minimize this, it's still evident.\nAlso if you really want everything well calibrated you can pick up a calibration system for ~$100. I have used a Huey Pro with great results for years, sadly it seems to no longer be sold, however this: http://www.pantone.com/pages/products/product.aspx?pid=1339&ca=2 seems to be similar (perhaps it's replacement).\n", "Q: Invitees not getting email notification of the meeting (event) I created an event on iPhone (6.x) by tapping the plus sign on my icloud calender with two users having gmail email addresses.

How can I resend the notification emails if there is such a way.\n\nA: Try this:\nChange your notification settings\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Google Calendar app Google Calendar app icon.\n\n*In the top left, touch Menu > Settings.\n\n*Choose one of your calendars, like Events.\n\n*To change or remove a notification, touch it or touch Add another notification.\n\n", "Q: How to know where and when my iphone was bought? Is it possible to look up where and when an iPhone was purchased, based only on the serial number or other unique info inside the phone?\n\nA: I don't know of a public tool for looking this up. However, if you befriend an Apple Genius, I know that the system they use for creating tickets allows them to view the purchase date and sales channel it was purchased through. However, there is no way to tell direct location (i.e. Best Buy on Main Street in St. Paul), only the channel (i.e. Best Buy).\nYou can also deduce the purchase date yourself by going to Apple's Check Your Service and Support Coverage page. If you locate the expiration date for repair coverage, subtract a year from that to identify original purchase date. If AppleCare was purchased, subtract an extra year.\n\nA: Not an exact answer but may help... this page has instructions that will let you determine the manufacture date of a refurbished phone (i.e. one for which you might not have a receipt). \nSummary: If the serial number begins with 5, it's a refurbished phone. The third digit is the last digit of the year of manufacture (so if your serial number begins 5K3, this is a refurbished phone manufactured in 2013). The fourth and fifth digits are the week of manufacture, so 02 would be in January, 51 in December, etc.\nhttp://www.wikihow.com/Identify-a-Refurbished-Iphone\n\nA: You can try this :\nhttps://selfsolve.apple.com/agreementWarrantyDynamic.do\nBut it won't say much.\n\nA: If you have a Mac, you can download coconutID, which lets you check your Mac's serial number as well as any other Apple device's serial number.\n\nA: You can check iPhone/iPad purchase date and contract status with this IMEI checker - www.iphoneox.com\nIt doesn't show where you purchased the phone, but it should show the original carrier which narrows things down substantially.\nAlso this checker shows whether a carrier lock is active against that device.\n", "Q: How do I format an encrypted Integral Secure Key? I just bought an Integral Secure Key from the Apple store but am fed up with having to use its own software just to transfer files to it as it does not appear as a normal USB drive in Finder.\nHow can I re-format the drive so as to remove the encryption and just have a normal USB drive? Is it as simple as using disk utility?\nAlso how could I in the future use the encryption facilities again? Is it enough just to keep the software which is provided on the USB key?\n\nA: i have the same Integral Secure Key and i can transfer all data without any kind of encryption and store it; for all more private data i use the encryption function. so there is no need to re-format the usb to store data 'more easily\"\n", "Q: iPhone 4S with latest update now charges very slowly My iPhone 4S (iOS 6.1.x) dropped it's charge today.  It now is charging very slowly.  I deleted my iCloud account to see if that would improve battery life.  It still is charging slowly, and has taken about 3 hours to charge 37%.\nIs there something I can do to \"fix\" this battery life problem?\n\nA: Plug it in and then power it off.\nThe charging circuitry runs from the firmware and not the OS - so you will either get a full charge and have a chance to reboot it in 2 or 4 hours to check on the charge status or know where the failure lies.\nIt's most likely a temporary CPU hog draining charge as fast as it can accumulate and a simple reboot (hold the home button, slide to power off, restart once it shuts down normally) is generally going to clear this up.\n\nA: Charge is like a bathtub.  If it is draining faster than filling the total level will drop.  The iPhone uses a LOT of power for a USB device, so there's a few potential sources of your issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*The power source may not be rated high enough.  If you're using a 3rd-party usb charger, make sure it is.  There are a lot of phony Apple chargers out there (yes, it's true) make sure yours is genuine.\n\n*The device itself may be drawing power.  When charging, turn off the screen when it isn't in-use.  \n\n*Make sure your GPS isn't in use either, as that will consume gads of power.\n\n*Turn off Bluetooth devices paired with the device when not in use.\nIf none of these fix your issue, post back.\n\nA: Just go to Settings → General → Reset > Reset All Settings\nThis is the solution to get the iPhone back to normal (quick) charging! Worked for me after annoying 2 weeks of figuring out why it charged so slow! You won't lose data/contacts. Only Wi-Fi passwords and some basic settings, but this is not a big deal compare to the slow charge problem! Success!\n", "Q: IP address on network cameras change preventing remote access I have 5 network cameras on my network. I manually added settings in my Airport Extreme router for port forwarding. However the IP addresses change often, preventing remote access. Is there a way to prevent this? \nAirport 7.6.3 and Mountain Lion 10.8.2\n\nA: You need to do two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, make sure the cameras are not on DHCP (automatic addressing). This will need to be configured at the camera itself. You would need to assign them manual IP addresses as @gosmond already mentioned.\n\n*Next, make sure your Internet IP address is static. Very few ISPs provide static IPs for home connections (they do for business users). You can work around this by using a service like dyndns which will give you a domain name that will point to your router even if your ISP changes your Internet IP.\n\nA: You need to log in to your network cameras (through their web administrative interface, look in the user manual) and set them to use Static IP addresses. \n(Currently, they're probably using DHCP, which will tend to assign a new IP address whenever the device reboots or disappears from the network for more than a certain amount of time.)\n", "Q: Why does the Century font in Pages '09 not include italics or bold? I am using Apple Pages '09 to write a document where the font must be in Century. In Microsoft Word, the Century font has an italics, bold, and underline option. However, in Pages '09 the only available text decoration is underline. Why is that so? And do other fonts have restrictions on text decorations in Pages?\n\nA: It probably means you don't have the bold and italic versions installed. You can get those versions by downloading them (here, for example). Just Google search for century bold and century italic. \nFonts are all basically just collections of images. Bold and italic ones are actually completely different fonts, just sometimes they're packaged together rather than as separate fonts. Some fonts don't have bold or italic versions at all. That's why some fonts don't have those options sometimes. \n\nA: If I got you right, there are two parts to this question.\n\n\n*\n\n*Why wouldn't Pages allow me to embolden or italicize letters in Century?\n\n*\n\n*Probably because you don't have a bold or italic versions of the font on your system, as ahruss said. I think they are not bundled with the system by default.\n\n\n*If so, why is it possible in Word and not possible in Pages? What's the difference?\n\n*\n\n*When the system does not have a ready-made bold/italic typeface, Word works around by mathematically slanting the regular glyphs or making each stroke of the glyphs thicker. This usually does the job, but the output is ugly (try italicizing Times New Roman and Century on MS Word and compare the results -- especially the lower case letters). This is probably why Pages do not perform this workaround, forcing the user to select another font with all the text styles ready-made. \n\n\n\n(Correct me if I'm wrong -- I know a little bit about fonts but I haven't used Pages)\n", "Q: Cannot install apps on iOS 6.1.2; can't get through the account security questions I bought an iPad with retina display yesterday, and this is my first iOS device.\nAfter registering and connecting an Apple id, I tried to install some free apps.\nBut every time I press the install app button, there is a popup saying something like 'You need to setup three questions to improve the security level of your Apple id'(translated from Chinese). \nI clicked the continue button, then there is a page to choose questions. But when I clicked to choose the first question, it jumps to a blank page and I never see any further response.\nBut when I clicked the do it later(translated from Chinese) button, it just quit installing the app.\nSo neither way can I install an app.\nI also tried to reset iPad but it still does not work.\nThe fact is that I already fill the three questions&answers when updating to the current 6.1.2 version. I don't know why it asked me do that again.\nWhat can I do to solve the problem?\nUPDATE:\nThe problem magically disappeared this morning and I absolutely have no clue what the reason is.\n\nA: You should first try reseting the phone.  \nIf that doesn't work, a few people had success in this Apple discussion thread with signing into their account on a different phone that did not have the latest version of iOS on it. \nSo try signing into your account and setting your security questions from a friends phone. Then of course, remember to log off. \n\nA: Had the same problem. Doing a reset fixed the problem.\n", "Q: MBP Headphone Jack Doesn't Work in OS X but does in Windows I bought a brand new Mid-2012 MacBook Pro 13\" from Apple. Ever since I've had it, it's had this quirky bug where headphones are only recognized if they're plugged in before the computer is woken up: the computer has to be either turned off or put to sleep every time I want to plug in my headphones. I called Apple Support and went through all the usual stuff and some not-so-usual stuff, but the problem still persists. I, along with multiple tech support guys from Apple, finally just concluded it was a hardware issue. I never bothered to take it into the store to get fixed, and the problem never went away (no surprise there). \nToday, after living with this and doing nothing about it for months, I installed a fresh copy of Windows 7 Enterprise using BootCamp, and in Windows, headphones work perfectly all the time. I've just been living with this issue since I've had a workaround, but this makes me think there must be some way of making the jack work properly in OS X, too. \nAny ideas on what could be causing this problem or how to fix it? What would be different about Windows 7 that would make it act differently?\n\nHere's what I've already tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resetting the PRAM and SMC\n\n*Ensuring that no weird audio drivers or services were installed (the Apple Support guy and I went through my /Library and ~/Library with a fine-tooth comb)\n\n*Re-installing the OS fresh (in fact, since then, I've changed hard drives and installed fresh a second time)\n\n*Cleaning out the headphone jack itself\n\n*Using a different set of headphones (any of them that use the 1/8th inch jack don't work in OS X but do in Windows; Bluetooth and USB headphones work fine)\n\n*Ensuring that everything is attached correctly inside the MBP (no frayed wires, no loose connections, etc.)\n\n\nA: It's entirely likely you have a situation where the drivers on Windows are not detecting a faulty hardware condition and thus continue to send signal to the copper ports. Your Mac may be sending the audio to the TOSlink (optical) portion of the jack.\nSee this other question for details and a similar answer by @chico on his experience getting around this hardware failure by using different OS / drivers.\n\nA: I have experience with the same issue and think it's Apple fault in how OS X handles the dual function of its audio output. My solution was to install Ubuntu, it doesn't mute it anymore.\nSince using Ubuntu 13.04 now on my macbook pro early 2011, it never suffers from the infamous headphone jack problem. Removing the headphones, the internal speakers work, plug it in, the headphone works.\nHere're some articles that explain what's up with the headphone jack, and the root cause of this behavior:\n\n\n*\n\n*Continuing issues (and solutions) for the MBP's silent speaker problem - 4/2012\n\n*Getting Sound Back on a Macbook Pro (when the headphone is stuck on Optical) - 8/2012\n\n*Apple's finicky headphone jacks frustrate MacBook owners - 2/2009\nOn OS X, it just doesn't work. If I dare plugging in the headphones, I know that when I take it out, internal speakers will stop working, they will be muted, and not come back after a while. I've stopped plugging stuff in and out trying to make it work.\nI just installed a new OS that works. I suspect Ubuntu, maybe, just ignores all the stuff about the dual mode of the headphone jack.\nHardware resolutions for this problem span from cleaning the output to replacing the logic board. IMO, its Apple fault to produce such a delicate hardware device and not provide means for controlling the dual-mode of the audio output through software, which, as can be seen, can be done.\n", "Q: After renewing IOS developer membership, my apps are \"pending contract\" I did the following\n- renewed my company IOS developer program membership, as it was expiring soon\n- changed agent contact details, as the previous agent had left the company.\nWhat happened:\n- Apple removed my company's apps from store, dropped them to \"pending contract\" state. \nI next\n- released an updated version of the app with bugfixes, it passed Apple review and I published\nwhat happened:\n- Apple put the new version also to \"Pending contract\" state.\nWhat happened next:\n- I look at the \"banking and tax information\" from Itunes Connect\n- it says IOS membership has expired.\n- I go to membership center and check and it is expiring 2014..\nI hate apple for not offering me way to escalate this situation to them to be able to resolve this.\ndoes anyone else experience similar difficulties? Is there any way for me to contact apple and let them know I am experiencing this?\n\nA: Ugh. Another needless roadblock in the already painful experience of iOS development. Here's how I finally managed to fix this: Click on Edit to edit the bank information, then View/Edit details for the existing account. Without changing anything, click Next and Save. Then you gotta wait 24 hours, even though you didn't change anything hahaha!\n\nA: Check your contracts are in order at iTunes Connect. Apple won't publish apps until you've accepted the contracts.\nWhen you log in to iTunes Connect, the main page will state something like \"The following contracts are expired: iOS Paid Applications. This could be affecting the availability of your apps.

(Can also configure incoming blocks as well, if you wish.)\nIf you're trying to defeat network copy protection in Adobe Photoshop and certain other apps -- you can prevent Photoshop from \"phoning home\" across the internet, but you can't prevent it from detecting multiple serial numbers on the LAN. At the LAN level it uses protocols other than TCP/IP to see if other same-serial-number copies of the program are running. LittleSnitch can't recognize or filter these non-TCP/IP communications.\n\nA: I use the in built sandbox-exec application for somethings related to this, you need to create a special no-network profile and need to launch the target application using sandbox-exec. You can refer to the article here for more detailed explanation on this. \nAnother application which i havent used but is supposed to do the same is TCPBlock\nBoth are free unlike LittleSnitch\n", "Q: iPhone dock connector problems, with and without accessories I started to experience problems with my iPhone that seem to be related to the dock connector.\nUpon plugging my iPhone into my (officially supported) car stereo, I started to get the message  \"This accessory is not supported by iPhone\" on the screen.  Didn't think much of it as I only use it for charging purposes, and that still worked so I ignored it.  Then I bought a small ANT+ dongle, which is a little accessory you plug into the dock connector to allow your phone to receive data from various health/fitness devices like heart rate monitor, and cycle sensors etc.  It produces the same error message every time I plug it in, and the apps that use the dongle will not recognise it.\nThe dongle does officially support my hardware and OS level. I've checked that it is not broken by plugging it into an iPhone 5, an iPad 3 and an iPod of some description, none of which showed the error.  The supported apps find the device on the iPad, the iPhone 5 does not have the apps installed but offers to do so as soon as I plug it in, so I know the dongle is working correctly.\nIn addition to the above, when nothing is plugged into the dock connector, it still occassionally thinks that something is, resulting in a muted phone.  When it's in this state I am not able to hear anything or change any volume settings (music playback or ringer volume) with the physical keys. Going into the Music app shows that it thinks it's outputting the music to the dock connector.\nWhy is this accessory not working on my iPhone, and how can I get it working?  What causes my iPhone to think that it's docked when it isn't?\n\nA: This commonly occurs when there is an issue with your dock connector.  It is likely dirty, obstructed in some way, or possibly even broken with a bent pin or something.  Very often this is not apparent, because with 30 pins to play with, chances are most of the time you only need the ones for charging and USB data transfer, leaving the rest unused such that you will not notice if they start working sub optimally.\nThere are 3 ways I would try to fix this, in order of most likely to fix:\nClear it out\nYour first step is to check for any obvious blockage.  If  you have a can of compressed air, you can try to blow any debris out.  If you don't, then using a fine non metallic scraper (a plastic toothpick is ideal, a wooden one may leave small fibers behind) carefully clean out what you can - even if it looks clean you will be surprised how much crap and fluff you can scrape out. Take care to blow any debris out of the phone, and not into it - i.e. hold it upright and get at it from underneath, don't sit it upside down and work from the top\nClean it up\nIf there is no obvious obstruction then the problem may be more subtle, a coating on one or more of the pins that is preventing a neat conductive contact, or is grounding a pin against another one for example - perhaps there has been some contact with a liquid in the past etc.  You need to clean the pins to get rid of this.  You will need a couple of things things - 1) some cleaning agent, 2) a lint free cloth/piece of sponge, or an old toothbrush.\nFor a cleaning agent, 99% isopropyl is perfect, but if you don't have that kicking around you could try a very small quantity of the neatest and purest alcoholic drink you have in the house - I've used Vodka which is by and large 50/50 alcohol and water.  Don't use anything flavoured or anything that it likely to have anything other than alcohol and water in it!  Especially sugars or salt!.\nUsing a very small amount of your cleaning agent, and keeping the phone upright so any drips fall out, and not into the phone, lightly brush or wipe the dock connector, taking care not to be rough enough to disturb the pins out of alignment.  I've used a small piece of synthetic sponge and prodded it about with the same toothpick I used earlier.\nHit it\nIf this doesn't work, then the issue could still be a physical obstruction, although it may be beyond the dock connector and more internal.  Short of taking the phone to bits, there is not a lot you can do, and whilst you cannot clean the inside, you can try to dislodge anything that's stuck by using a combination of lightly tapping the phone on all 4 sides whilst playing about with the vibrate functions for alarms etc.\n\nUsing the first 2 methods above I solved the \"Accessory not supported problem\", but still had the intermittent docking issue.\nAssuming I could not fix that one, I went to turn on Vibrate alerts (which I had previously turned off) as a workaround, only to find that after playing with all the vibrate \"tones\" etc it magically fixed itself!\n\n\n*\n\n*Note 1 It's possible that the issue is not with the connector on your phone, but on your device/cable - you can try all the above on the cable end too if doing it on your phone does not yield results.\n\n*Note 2 If your device is failing to charge, or will only charge from a certain cable or dock, then the same fix potentially applies.\n\n\nA: I had this same issue.  I'm pretty sure from being in a damp pocket during a snowy 5k.\nHere's what I did:\nTurn the phone off \nI used a concealer makeup brush dipped in alcohol to brush down the connector (while I was at it I also did the usb cord i use on my imac and the headphone jack).\nDid a hard restart (hold down the power button and the home button for like 5 secs).\nHopefully this isn't a temporary fix!\n\nA: @stuffe came up with a couple of correct solutions based on traditional wisdom, but failed to realize the depth to which Apple will go to obfuscate problems from the user.  It appears that there is a software setpoint for current (or power since the voltage is supposed to be the fixed) below which this state is triggered.\nThe message: \"This accessory may not be supported\", is due to insufficient power.\nI am sure there is/was an Apple engineer could tell you exactly what current threshold triggers it (probable reasoning is adverse affect on battery life), but that is really irrelevant. Here are some things that you can do to correct it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Clean connections.  Crud on connectors act as an insulator, reducing\nthe amount of current flow.\n\n*If its a usb cable, plug it in to something with a higher current (amps/milliamps) or power (watts/milliwatts) rating.*\n\n*Turn off, power saving features that may reduce power to usb ports. (if it stops after X minutes this is probably the reason)\n\n*Make sure your usb adapter outputs sufficient Volts (indicated by it only charging to XX% before you get the message)\n\n*Use a usb port closer to your laptop's the power supply (They often\nhandle more current than easier to access ones)\n\n*If you have one, you can try a powered usb hub (good ones are better\nwith high powered devices)\n\n*If none of that works, try a known working cable from a someone.\n\n*If that doesn't work you may have an issue with the connector in the\nphone itself.\n\n\n*\n\n*Usb power adapters should have the design voltage and current printed on them; however, this is the \"design\" rating.  Not all of them actually perform to spec in real life and it is not uncommon for components to weaken or fail over time, but still have some output.\n\n\n\nFootnote:\nI have an ASUS laptop running Linux and it has an easy to access usb port on the right  hand side near the front that doesn't output quite enough power.  Combined with a bit of connector corrosion, the only way it would charge was if I held it down fairly tightly on the charging base.  As soon as I would let go, I would get \"This accessory may not be supported\".  Simply switching it to the usb port near my power connector (in a less convenient location) was sufficient.  This tells me that it likely has nothing to do with any \"device\" specifics and since I have no iApps installed, those are ruled out too.  The only difference is the power output.  I will probably eventually need to clean my connections, but for now I'm good.\nTODO: Write a polite letter to Apple requesting error messages that actually mean something.... It's probably in errno.h and strerror.h depending on how far they have gotten from their BSD roots (just add something like ELOWPWR and \"This accessory has insufficient power for charging.\" respectively).\nTODO: Get a cheap charger from the Dollar Tree, expose the wire and use a potentiometer and ammeter to determine an approximate current threshold that triggers the message inoperable charging state.\n\nA: On a jailbroken device, follow these instructions from Battlesnake5 on reddit:\n\nUsing iFile, go to /System/Library/LaunchDaemons and move com.apple.iapd.plist somewhere safe. This disables the service that works with accessories from starting, so when you reboot it should work fine.\n\n\nA: I have an iPhone 4S and I had the issue where it stopped connecting to any plg in device. I tried the cleaning, which did no harm, but then I messed around with the vibrate settings and it cleared immediately.\n\nA: In order for the line out audio to work for an iPhone 5 or 5s dock, make sure you have iOS 7. I had iOS 6 running on the iPhone 5 and the line out audio would not work.\n\nA: The same thing was happening to me so I just powered it off and back on and it was fixed so try that first.\n", "Q: What differences are there between using the Server.app Time Machine server and simply sharing the attached backup HDD? I'll get a Mac mini next week and apart from other things, I'd like to use it as a backup server via Time Machine and an external HDD.\nAs I want to be able to access the HDD from remote anyway, I thought about simply sharing it and selecting it as a backup drive on my Macs. Then I found about about the Time Machine server included in OS X Server. What differences and advantages are there in using either one?\n\nA: The  Time Machine functionality that OS X Server provides is to allow an remote OS X machine to use the server as a Time Machine backup disk. The server will create a sparsebundle for each remote machine it is backing up.\nOS X Server includes a way of controlling and administrating services that can be implemented on normal OS X. In this case you can create a sparse bundle and share it in plain OSX (or as is done in many Network Attached Servers in Linux/BSD)\nFor your case as you are not using the server as a remote TM backup then OS X Server does not provide much here. With normal OSX you can share the external disk via AFP, samba but these are better not to expose across the internet for security reasons or better use ssh to remotely access the Mac.\n", "Q: Looking for old C compiler Back in 1987 or 1988 we had a Mac network at college, these would have been either Mac Classic or Mac Plus machines. We used a C compiler on them - what C compilers were around at the time?\n\nA: Could be Think C or Apple's Macintosh Programmers' Workshop Note links are to Wikipedia, which is probably OK for information for old computing.\n\nA: There was also the Consulair Mac C Development System.\n", "Q: Can Macintosh HD partition be resized while a BOOTCAMP partition resides on the same physical volume?

With Paragon NTFS driver installed, if this matters...\n\nA: Disk Utility won't touch things once you have a BOOTCAMP partition.\nLook for third party utilities like CampTune for on the fly adjustments (or at least ones after a reboot in some cases). You'll discover the same company Paragon that made the NTFS drivers, also makes CampTune\n", "Q: Disable Little Snitch in guest account? It's annoying as hell to let others use your computer on a guest account with Little Snitch installed, all the consecutive popups one after another...it's really ridiculous.\nAlso in the event my Macbook is stolen, a user logs into guest, all the dialogs will clearly let him know to disable connections.  So little luck there using \"Find my Mac.\"\nAnyway to just disable this or set a rule to allow everything?  Of course any rules created in LS within the guest account do not save after logout.\n\nA: @user43855's steps work correctly (except for step 6 which is missing a crucial bit), but they also assume the user is very familiar with what is being done. I have expanded to include step-by-step details for disabling Little Snitch automatically in the Guest account.\nThis process creates a Little Snitch preferences file where Little Snitch is disabled, and then copies that file to the User Template folder that is copied every time the Guest account is recreated. (Note the User Template folder is also used for the creation of new accounts, so if you want Little Snitch on in a new account, you will have to enable it after the account is created.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Login to the Guest account.\n\n*Disable Little Snitch Network Filter in Little Snitch's settings.\n\n*Open Finder, and press ⌘+Shift+G.\n\n*In the box labeled \"Go to the folder\", enter ~/Library/Preferences and press Enter.\n\n*Find the file named at.obdev.LittleSnitch.plist and right-click on it.

Fortunately this can be accomplished without changing the language of the entire computer.\n", "Q: How to change Exchange email account settings on 50 iPhones, remotely? We have the following situation. A customer of ours got re-branded and has therefore now a new domain name. On the email server (Exchange 2010) we added the new domain and for every user we created a new email address and set it as the primary. (firstname.lastname@newname.com instead of firstname.lastname@oldname.com) The old email address is still in there as an alias.\nNow we have the problem that the iPhones didn't get informed of this change. Sending and receiving emails work fine. But then a user presses reply all and the email was sent to the new email address then he get himself on the send to list too.\nIs it possible to somehow enforce the change of the email address from the server side? I don't want to touch 50 iPhones to make such a change.\n\nA: Sure, You could use the iPhone Configuration Utility or Apple Configurator to create a profile for the server settings.\nOnce you've gotten a signed profile document (it can be self signed if you haven't set up trusted SSL certs, etc…) you can email it or post it to dropbox or otherwise put it on a web server for each device to retrieve.\nThe users would tap the file to download it and then tap to accept the payload. You could leave the account blank so each user would just have to enter an account/password and the profile would have the details on the mail server and settings to be installed.\nStart with the deployment page at Apple and scroll down to the Configure section to read more on MDM and Configurator.\nhttp://www.apple.com/iphone/business/it-center/deployment.html\nReading into your settings, you might also consider using directory services or a single sign on solution to pull a person't correct email account from a central directory, but that might cost more than a one time, touch all 50 devices exercise. In the end, you might pay for automation software since it allows better reporting and flexibility as changes like these tend to come more and more often in most businesses.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro starts with gray screen When I'm closing the screen on my macbook and tries to start it up a few hours later it always starts with a gray screen. It take about 30 to 60 seconds until I can start using the computer. \nThe macbook is brand new. It doesn't matter if the charger is connected or not.\nAnyone knows what the problem could be?\n\nA: This sounds like an SMC issue to me. SMC is the System Management Controller chip that controls power-centric pieces of the Mac's hardware, such as power, sleep functions, fans, etc. The exact process varies by model of Intel Mac, so I've included the link below.\nResetting the System Management Controller\n", "Q: Mount NFS share in /Volumes as a drive Ok, this might be a stupid question to ask, but trying to mount a NFS share (from a Linux machine, if it's worth anything) in a folder that resides in /Volumes never makes the share appear in Finder (not in Volumes anyway).\nThe folder was made by simply sudo mkdir /Volumes/folder_name and the mount was made using autofs like this:\n/Volumes/folder_name    auto_nfs      -nolock,locallocks,rdirplus\n\nI should mention the folder is accessible though the terminal, but it just doesn't show in Finder.\nOn the other hand, if I modify /etc/auto_master to this:\n/Volumes  auto_nfs      -nolock,locallocks,rdirplus\n\nthe folder appears, but I loose all my other drives (except the system one and Network)\nAt the moment, I'm mounting to a regular folder on the system drive which I've symlinked to a folder in /Volumes. Oddly, that works fine, but it does appear as a symlink and it bothers me (and possibly other users).\n\nA: I have spent quite a bit of time figuring out automounts of NFS shares in OS X...\nSomewhere along the line, Apple decided allowing mounts directly into /Volumes should not be possible:\n/etc/auto_master (see last line):\n#\n# Automounter master map\n#\n+auto_master        # Use directory service\n/net            -hosts      -nobrowse,hidefromfinder,nosuid\n/home           auto_home   -nobrowse,hidefromfinder\n/Network/Servers    -fstab\n/-          -static\n/-          auto_nfs    -nobrowse,nosuid\n\n/etc/auto_nfs (this is all one line):   \n/Volumes/my_mount    -fstype=nfs,noowners,nolockd,noresvport,hard,bg,intr,rw,tcp,nfc nfs://192.168.1.1:/exports/my_share\n\nThis will not work (anymore!) though it \"should\".\n$ sudo automount -cv\n...\nautomount: /Volumes/my_mount: mountpoint unavailable\n\nWhat's the solution?\nIt's so easy my jaw dropped when I figured it out.\nBasically, we trick OS X into thinking we're mounting * somewhere else. *\nWhen you're talking about paths in just about any environment, the root folder is the highest path you can reach, whether it's C:\\ (windows) or / (*nix)\nWhen you're at this path, attempting to reach the parent path, via .. will keep you at the root path.\nFor example: /../../../../ is still just /\nBy now, a few of you have already figured it out.\nTL;DR / Solution:\nChange your /etc/auto_nfs config from (this is all one line):\n/Volumes/my_mount    -fstype=nfs,noowners,nolockd,noresvport,hard,bg,intr,rw,tcp,nfc nfs://192.168.1.1:/exports/my_share\n\nTo (this is all one line):\n/../Volumes/my_mount    -fstype=nfs,noowners,nolockd,noresvport,hard,bg,intr,rw,tcp,nfc nfs://192.168.1.1:/exports/my_share\n\nAnd re-run the automounter:\n$ sudo automount -cv\n...\nautomount: /Volumes/my_mount: mounted\n\n..... there you go! Technically /../Volumes is still /Volumes, but the automounter does not see things that way ;)\nThis configuration persists the mount across restarts, and creates the mountpoint automatically.\nI KNOW, RIGHT?\n\nA: There is a boring, technical explanation (which I cannot find right now) for this behavior . I worked around it by adding /Volumes to the Favorites section in the Finder's sidebar\n\n\nA: You can mount a volume in terminal, it will be automatically visible in finder\nmount -v -w -o vers=4,noowners,rw,nolocks,locallocks -t nfs IP_ADDRESS:/ /PATH/TO/SHARED_FOLDER\n\nunmount with\numount -f /PATH/TO/SHARED_FOLDER\n\n", "Q: Custom Local DNS entry ignored I'm using dnsmasq to route requests to .lh hosts to my vagrant server currently running on 192.168.0.5 on Mac OSX 10.6.\nscutil --dns returns the correct resolver info:\nresolver #9\n  domain : lh\n  nameserver[0] : 192.168.0.5\n\nBut ping (and also the browser) is unable to resolve the domain:\nping root.blah.lh\nping: cannot resolve root.blah.lh: Unknown host\n\nI added 192.168.0.5 to my list of DNS servers in my network settings, and it's sitting at the top of the list, above 8.8.8.8 - seems to be getting completely ignored. \nsudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder and sudo dscacheutil -flushcache apparently have no effect. \nHow can I get .lh hosts to resolve to 192.168.0.5 correctly?\n\n(the stuff below this line is historical, and has been moved here after Alan Shutko's answer indicating that nslookup is not a useful analysis tool in this case)\nnslookup is also unable to resolve the domain:\nnslookup blah.lh\nServer:     8.8.8.8\nAddress:    8.8.8.8#53\n\n** server can't find blah.lh: NXDOMAIN\n\nI also tried adding 127.0.0.1 to my DNS server list in network settings (at the top), which produces a lookup on local, viz:\nnslookup blah.lh\nServer:     127.0.0.1\nAddress:    127.0.0.1#53\n\nName:   blah.lh\nAddress: 127.0.0.1\n\n\nA: I'm assuming you are using Mac OS X, since you mention scutil. nslookup doesn't use the same mechanisms as the rest of the OS:\nFrom man nslookup:\n\nMac OS X NOTICE\nThe nslookup command does not use the host name and address resolution or the DNS query routing mechanisms used by other processes running on Mac OS X.

I don't like the albums I used to listen to in high school mixed with the ones I got yesterday. Is there a way to separate them in categories or something that gives them that sort of order?\n\nA: The best way to do this would be using playlists. You can drag folders of songs directly into an iTunes playlist. If the songs in question are already part of your library, doing this will create duplicates, so I'd recommend deleting theses songs from iTunes before adding them to your playlist.\n\nA: Playlists are one way to do this. But you can also create custom genres, if you want. For example, select all the tracks of the \"albums your dad recommended,\" press Command-I, and type in a custom genre in the Genre field, such as Dad's recommendations. You can then view these albums in Genres view easily. And you can build playlists using the genre as a condition.\n", "Q: How can I reformat a drive that contains an encrypted volume? After OS X 10.7 came out with its disk-encryption features, I encrypted an empty USB thumb drive just for grins. I never used it, and eventually decided to reformat it as a normal drive for use with Windows and earlier versions of OS X.\nWhen I opened Disk Utility to try to erase and repartition the drive, however, things looked weird. I clicked on the drive in the left sidebar, but there was no “Erase” tab on the right—only “First Aid” and “Partition”—and the “Partition” tab said, “You may only split this partition into two. To do this, click +.” There was no option to change the partition layout or to remove the encryption from my volume. How can I reformat this drive to remove the encryption?\n\nA: It turns out that Disk Utility didn’t want to touch a disk that contained an encrypted partition, but it had no issue with changing the encrypted partition itself. I clicked on the encrypted partition (not the drive) in the sidebar, and the “Erase” tab appeared on the right. From there I reformatted the disk to Mac OS Extended without encryption, and afterward Disk Utility had no hangups about reformatting or repartitioning the drive.\n", "Q: Finder does not recognize + in filename I use + signs in filenames to indicate quality of publications, e.g. Johnson 2013 +++.pdf.

It is a copy of the current state of your photos and other data on the iPhone.\nTo recover an earlier version of your iPhone backup relies on however you backup your Mac.\nTime Machine backups include the MobileSync folders.  So you could retrieve an old iPhone backup from Time Machine, replacing the current backup in ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/[ID], and then restore your iPhone.  This would, of course, replace all your current photos (and other data) with that from the old backup.  Probably, not quite what you want.\nI suggest using iBackupBot which is able to open any folder on your Mac containing iPhone backups.  So find an old iPhone backup in Time Machine, retrieve the whole folder to your Desktop (or somewhere convenient) and open it with iBackupBot.  Your photos will be in the Media/DCIM/100Apple/ folder.  You can then extract these to your Mac.\nIf you don't want to use additional software (like iBackupBot) then you can find your photos in the ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/[ID] folder of an old backup.  The files have cryptic names and no file type, but your photos are all there - just hard to find.  Sorting by size might help you get to the right files.\nIf you use some other backup method for your Mac, then use that to find and retrieve the old backup folder.\nIf you don't backup your Mac, or don't backup the MobileSync folder, then I am sorry to say you have lost them.\nIn future, I suggest you transfer all photos from the iPhone to your Mac using, for example, iCloud and Photo Stream.\nAdditional: No backup of Mac hard disk.  Not all is lost - perhaps.  In January your pictures were on your hard disk.  Though they have since been deleted (by a more recent iTunes backup) at least some of the data which was you photo files is probably still there in the free space.  This now getting well beyond the original question.  Now we are talking about:\nHow to recover files which have been deleted from the hard disk.  There are utilities which can help - for example Disk Drill.  But, I think that should be new topic and that may get answers from those with recent experience of file recovery.\n", "Q: When editing files on a (Windows?) networked drive I get \"could not be saved\" errors When I edit files that are stored locally, everything works fine, but when editing files that are stored on my networked home directory (at uni here), I get:\nThe document \"<x>\" could not be saved.\n\nwhen I try to save a file.

Word decided it was going to print the whole document. No matter what settings I tried; whole document. Except that you can successfully print \"current page\".\nI have seen this issue complained about for about 2 years, but did not find any solution. Only that the problem was \"intermittent\" and \"fixed itself.\"\nIs there any better wisdom than the workaround of printing one page at a time?\nIn addition, during the attempts to use the different page range settings, I saw the the preview would occasionally report the document had 28 pages. And sometimes when printing, the pages would come out in \"random\" order. Very strange.\n\nA: I had the same problem occur and I found a solution…\nWhen you look at the number of pages in the status bar in Word (bottom left corner) it reads something like: Page: 1 of 20 (or however many pages your document has in it).\nNow go to your \"Insert\" Tab and look for the \"Page Number\" menu/button and drop it down to the \"Format page numbers…\"  In this dialog box, what does it read for \"Page Numbering/Start at:\" ?  If you have changed this setting to start at a new number, that is now the new page parameter set.  \nThat should be the beginning of the print dialog box print range.\nSo say you have it set to \"Start at: 9\"  When you go to print the page range in the print dialog box your document is actually set now as Pages: 9-29 (instead of page 1-20). \nIf you only want to print the last ten pages you need to say print range \"19-29\".\n\nA: I was running into this same problem at the same time that I was having problems with my printer. When I ended up using some specific drivers for the printer (instead of the default/universal Apple printer driver) the problem went away. So if you are still struggling with this issue, I would suggest trying to use a printer specific driver.

I would have liked to have cloned them over the network, but we don't have a Mac server. Right now they are all turned on and configured with a basic Admin and Student account. I want to synchronize the preferences and parental controls on the student account on all of the systems.\nMy question is this: Is there any downside to simply copying the 'student' user folder from the properly configured system to all of the others? It appears to work, but I'm not sure if it will lead to any problems down the road, I don't have a lot of experience with this.\n\nA: I don't have a experience with OS X 10.8, but I've done plenty of computer-lab admin work back around OS X 10.3 / 10.4 / 10.5.

The same problem exists on OS X.\nWhen I search a word I usually get no results. It only works if the word is included in a recent email, let's say 1 or 2 weeks old.\nAlso, there is an option called \"Search on the server\". It never worked in the last 2 years.\nWhy is my search broken when using an Apple client to search Gmail?\n\nA: The most likely suspect for this behavior would be in how you have mail settings configured. The mail account will only search as many messages as you tell it to pull down from the server. Go to settings, and then select \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars.\"Scrolling down will reveal the different settings that you can configure for mail. One of them will be an option to let you change the number of emails that are pulled from your server. If you get a large number of emails, but the settings are only configured to store the most recent 100, then it would be reasonable to expect search to find only those items from the last couple of days. Depending on how far back you think that you will need to go on a regular basis, the number of emails that you will want to hold onto will vary greatly. So, you can easily adjust the number of emails that will be kept and will be able to be searched, but it will be up to you to determine this based on what you think your needs will be.\n\nA: If you use gmail, you may want to use the Gmail app which is much better at searching.\n\nA: When I am on wifi 'search on the server' will pull up results in a matter of seconds depending on the number of results.

I have the default setting set for sleep. The only way to \"wake\" the machine is to hold the power button down to shut down and then restart. I've reset NVRAM (pram) and tried removing power cable. Nothing helps.\n\nSince your Mac Mini is very new I would also consider contacting Apple Support and see what they offer as a solution and at the least notify them of the issue, I am sure they are working on a fix probably scheduled to be included with the next OS X update.\n\nA: Mac Mini / monitor problem SOLUTION! (I think) \nI think I found the solution to the great Mac-Mini monitor that won't wake up after sleep problem, at least for an HP 2159m monitor and my Mac-Mini 5.1 --but probably for many Mac/monitor combinations.  It appears to be just a simple timing problem between components. it has nothing to do with Mac firmware, NVRAM / PRAM or anything more exotic, it has to with how fast the Mac Mini comes online vs. the monitor itself.\nMany monitors have a default setting to accept either VGA, DVI or HDMI or autodetect the input. Typical factory default monitor settings are to try to autodetect the input and, if no signal is detected, to default to VGA.  My theory was that the monitor autodetected and defaulted before my Mac Mini fully started sending its HDMI signals.  \nMy solution was to set the monitor (with the monitor's controls) to default to HDMI rather than VGA.  After I did that the problem disappeared, now it wakes faithfully every time.  Because it is expecting HDMI signals the Mac-Mini can take as long as it wants to start sending them.\n\nA: The Mini may not actually be asleep, instead the screen may just be deactivated.\nI am seeing similar issues in my 10.8.3 Mini so I enabled remote ssh login.\nI could remote login and run commands while supposedly the Mini was asleep.\nI'll keep digging to try and find the root cause.\n\nA: Problem potentially fixed!\nProgress bar appears after waking from sleep.\nIt is the new Safe Sleep feature.\nTo disable it:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Go to terminal \n  \n*Type: sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0\n  \n*Enter your password when prompted\n  \n*Type sudo rm /var/vm/sleepimage\n  \n*Reboot\n  \n\nAccording to AppleCare, use sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 3 to reactivate Safe Sleep.\n\nA: After upgrading to OSX 10.8.3 the sleep problem has gone away.

If you need to access that archive again, you can import it into Entourage from wherever you've stored it by using the Import command.\n", "Q: Terminal Tab Title after SSH Session In Mac OS X (I'm on 10.6.8, though I believe other versions are the same) ssh'ing into a remote machine changes the title of the current tab in Terminal. Annoyingly, when I disconnect from the remote machine, either explicitly with exit or via a timeout, the title of the tab doesn't change back to what it was.\nOn an almost daily basis this nearly causes me to suffer a heart attack, when I'm typing away performing some command or other, only to see out of the corner of my eye that the tab is still named user@remotehost. I'm a cautious user that always tends to pwd etc to confirm my location before doing anything, yet it still catches me in a moment of panic when I'm doing DROP DATABASE x and I see the remote host name in the tab.\nLong story short, is there a way to revert this title when disconnecting from a remote host, or do I have to stick with opening a new tab every time I disconnect, to reset the title?\n\nA: To make @s01ipsist's solution work with ZSH (new shell on macOS), you can add this to ~/.zshrc:\nexport PROMPT_COMMAND=\"echo -ne '\\033]0;${USER}@${HOST}\\007';$PROMPT_COMMAND\"\nprecmd() { eval \"$PROMPT_COMMAND\" }\n\n\nA: Add a PROMPT_COMMAND to your  .bash_profile\nexport PROMPT_COMMAND=\"echo -ne '\\033]0;${USER}@${HOSTNAME}\\007';$PROMPT_COMMAND\"\n\nThe PROMPT_COMMAND gets executed every time the prompt is displayed.\nPlease note that we include the existing PROMPT_COMMAND environment variable, such that we do not lose any existing settings (i.e. update_terminal_cwd).\n\nA: Here's what you'll need to paste into your .bash_profile file. This is far cleaner and takes the approach what Apple does when it updates your current working directory.

I would like to change the file mode of the mount point located in /Volumes/, but -probably for security reasons- this cannot be done by simply using the sudo chmod go+rx /Volumes/<mount point>/ command.\nHow can I give other users permissions to my mount point of a network resource?\nEDIT:\nMounting is done the Mac way: via Finder.

I prefer to keep it the Mac way. I don't want to edit fstab manually to create static mount points (for example).\n\nA: The syntax will vary upon the filesystem use, but if it's SMBFS or CIFS based, you will need to specify the mode of the mount point, e.g. -d=777.

I can't find this information documented anywhere.\nWhat filesystems do iOS devices use?\nDid Apple stick with HFS+?\nIs it different between devices and iOS versions?\n\nA: As of iOS 10.3 (March 2017) - APFS/Apple File System is now the file system being used.\nPrevious to iOS 10.3 HFS+ was being used.\nAPFS will add improved support for solid-state drives and encryption improvements - things that were not a priority 20 years ago when HFS+ was introduced.\n\nA: iOS indeed uses HFSX (HFS+ , case sensitive). You can also use the HFSleuth tool from the Mac OS X/iOS Internals website, to prove this, and delve deeper into the filesystem structures.\n\nA: I can't see any definitve Apple documents but books quoted in these Stack Overflow questions and this and this book say HFSX (ie case sensitive HFS+) which is not the same as the default for OSX.\n\nA: The other answer seems to be correct about the file system being HFSX*, but on being case-insensitive (other answer since edited to correct), I found that not to be the case in the book Mac OS X and iOS Internals. On page 23 it says:\n\nIn iOS, being the case sensitive HFSX by default, case is not only\npreserved, but allows for multiple files to have the same name, albeit\nwith a different case. Naturally, case sensitivity means typos produce\na totally different command or file reference, often a wrong one.\n[emphasis above is mine]\n\nSince that didn't agree with the other answer, I sought confirmation.  I loaded a sample iOS project I was working on and changed the name of the database to only differ by case.  After running the app on my iPad mini (iOS 6.1) to re-create the database, I went into iTunes and looked at the files under File Sharing for the application.  Here's what I saw:\n\nSo, it would appear Mac OS X and iOS Internals is correct: case is preserved and allows for multiple files to have the same name.\nInterestingly, when I selected both files in iTunes' File Sharing and clicked \"Save to...\" my desktop, I did not get any warning.  iTunes apparently \"saved\" both files to my desktop, but only the initial-uppercase version survived (presumably overwriting the initial-lowercase version of the file.)\n\n* 2017 Update to Apple File System (APFS):\nAs of iOS 10.3, released on March 27, 2017, iOS now uses the new Apple File System (APFS), said to be \"optimized for flash and solid-state drive storage, with a primary focus on encryption.\"\nAPFS was announced at WWDC 2016 and there is a WWDC video titled Introducing Apple File System, and an Apple File System Guide for developers. The features section of the guide may be of specific interest.\n", "Q: Siri: Reminder Tied to Multiple Locations I've been wondering if there is a good workaround to solve the following problem with Siri.\nThere are some stores in my area that have multiple locations, for example Walmart.  I have added Walmart as a contact in Siri, along with the two addresses.  However, every time I ask Siri for something like, \"Remind me to pickup X while at Walmart\", she always asks me to pick a particular address.  Is there a way to create the reminder tied to BOTH addresses?\nMy current workaround is to create two reminders, one for each location, but that is far from ideal.\nI'd like to expand this to cover other categories, such as \"Grocery Store\", \"Home Improvement Store\",  etc, but creating multiple reminders quickly becomes too much of a hassle to manage.\n\nA: I'm sorry to say that but the reminders only work for one location each. You may be able to achieve the effect of using multiple geofences (the underlying technology) using a third-party program (e.g. Checkmark) but I have not tried that myself. Integration with Siri is not possible at the moment of this reply (no Siri API for third party developers available).\n", "Q: mac mini stuck on boot since I was not longer using the Server options on my mac mini I wanted to install os x mountain lion, so I downloaded the app and selected the appropriate hard disk. now, after it booted i'm stuck on the grey fabric background.\nthere's no signal of life and nothing printed on the screen.\nI have several macs around here at the office, how can I try to finish the installation at this point?\nthe mac mini is the 2007/08 version i think\nthanks!\n\nA: According to this support article, the system requirements call for a Mac Mini from 2009 or newer. The model number A1283 corresponds to each of the three Mac Minis that were manufactured in 2009 (Early 2009, Late 2009, and Server), so your hardware is compatible. The install image has disappeared because you began the installation process; this is supposed to happen, as the image was not designed to be persistent. The reason that the image is not persistent is partly because (if the installation is successful) if your file system were to become corrupted, for example, you would be able to boot from a separate partition that is made at the time of installation, called the Recovery Partition. In your case this did not happen, so you have neither the recovery partition nor the install media. \nTo fix your problem you will need to use another Mac, at least to begin with. The first step comes in two, simultaneous parts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-download the Mountain Lion installer from Apple. Afterward, follow the instructions from this article to create an installer on a flash drive. While that's downloading, go ahead and start with #2:\n\n*Re-install the OS X version that was originally on your Mini. You'll accomplish this by booting from the installation discs that came with the machine. This is important! Do not use discs that came with another model or generation! Depending on your exact model, this software will be one of the following:\n\n*\n\n*Mac OS X Server 10.6 (10A433; Server)\n\n*Mac OS X 10.5.6 (9G2030; early 2009)\n\n*Mac OS X 10.6 (10A432; original OS), OR, for the SAME generation, Mac OS X 10.6.2 (10A2234)\n\n\n\nThis will take a while, so be patient.\nThe next step is to upgrade your Mini to at least Snow Leopard (10.6.6). Although this really is a requirement only so you have the Mac App store on the machine. This was a requirement to download 10.8, which is available only through the Mac App store. Since you're downloading 10.8 from a different machine, I guess it would be possible to go from 10.6.x to 10.8, but I've never heard of anyone doing it. Probably just the safest to go ahead and get things updated to 10.6.6 or higher.\nOnce your Mac Mini has been restored and updated, go ahead and run \"Verify Disk\" through Disk Utility, just to be sure that the file structure is squeaky clean. It can't hurt, even though you've gone straight from a clean installation through some upgrades without anything in between, so go ahead and run it to make sure everything is spec.\nOnce that's all been done, go ahead and use your flash drive installer to attempt another installation of Mountain Lion. Not all installs work perfectly the first time through, so it may be that this one goes perfectly smoothly for you.\nGood luck! \n", "Q: Starting page numbering on page greater than page #1 in Pages '09 I want to add page numbers to the header of my document in Apple Pages '09. However, I would like the page numbering to start on page five; i.e. I want pages 1-4 to have no numbers, and for page #1 to start on page five. Is there any way to do this? I tried creating section breaks, but that has no effect on page numbers.\n\nA: This just worked for me.\nCreate your you four pages. \nClick on the last page (4) and then 'insert' a section break.\nNow with page 5 selected ( click inside page)\nGo to the 'Layout inspector' and set it to:\n\nInsert Autopage Numbers. Settings:\n\nYou can now insert more pages and the numbers continue.\nThe first 4 pages have no numbers.

I am looking to set up my laptop for both Python development and Phonegap Android development in OSX 10.8 using Eclipse. I installed the lastest version of Python (3.3) which added the code:\n# Setting PATH for Python 3.3\n# The orginal version is saved in .bash_profile.pysave\nPATH=\"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.3/bin:${PATH}\"\nexport PATH\n\nto my .bash_profile. In process of setting up Phonegap you need to set up the PATH for the Android Development tools with the following line:\nexport PATH=${PATH}:/Development/android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools:/Development/android-sdk-macosx/tools\n\nIs it possible to set up both PATHs in the .bash_profile so that Python and Android development can take place simultaneously? Or would I need to switch between the PATHs depending on what type of development I would like to do?\n\nA: Yes, it is perfectly possible to have both statements coexist happily in .bash_profile. This file is evaluated sequentially from top to bottom, and the same environment variable ($PATH in this case) can be modified multiple times. If you wish, you can edit both into a single command:\nexport PATH=\"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.3/bin:${PATH}:/Development/android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools:/Development/android-sdk-macosx/tools\"\nto do both modifications at the same time, but this is no different from your current setup.

It needs to be addressed, and Apple is very good about following up.\nhttp://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html\n\nA: Here's what I would do to actually try and fix the problem. We will completely reset iMessage. \nFirst up, log out of all accounts from Messages and Facetime, and then close them down. Create two folders on your Desktop: Messages, and Preferences.\nWith Finder as the active application, hit shift ⌘ cmd G and enter in ~/Library/Messages/. Drag the contents of this folder into the Messages folder your created on your desktop.

We have about 10 Macs at not big Digital Agency.\nCurrently I am doing some research and preparing some deployment plan, and don't know what to do with those Apple IDs. There is no any centralised business accounts that I would set up and manage all employees Apple IDs in one place. Or I have missed it?\n        Note: Those computers should not be synched with iPad or any other mobile devices, or this is not important to be able to\nSo what's the best practice in deployment:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Tie up all machines to one(or group) accounts? E.g\nsales@companydomain.com, designers@companydomain.com,\nmanagement@companydomain.com and so on   \n\n*Or create for each employee\npersonal AppleID? e.g employeename@companydomain.com.\nWould be nice to hear some advices from experienced admins\n\nA: There are tradeoffs to any choice of Apple ID, but unless your personal Apple ID are tied to an Apple email, you can always re-name the Apple ID and change email, DOB, security questions, etc…\nFor pilot projects on iOS where the budget for apps is less than $1000, I usually recommend a personal account option when you don't have someone in the organization to manage email / fire up new corporate accounts.\nIf you do have control and desire to set up work Apple ID, then you should do that and keep the purchases on a work account per policy. This also is my primary recommendation for Macs since software costs are often higher and you are less likely to shuffle people through a Mac as opposed to an iPad or iPhone/iPod.\nThe process of discovering how you want to enable your people to work, who will be responsible for managing Apple ID / passwords is more valuable than any decision you actually make. Most decisions can be fixed / adjusted / changed if you find you choose unwisely. Just write up your plan, review it internally and go. You don't have to get everything right if you can loop back in 3 months and see how you did and adjust accordingly.\nI would go to the seller of your Macs and see if they can advise you on how to deploy. If you haven't purchased yet, go to your local Apple store (if there is one) and talk with their Business Team. They help hundreds of groups like you navigate the path of using Apple at work. They don't charge for their time, have amazing resources if you stump them, and can hand you off to a local consultant if it's more economical to hire expertise if you have more money that time or training. A good consultant will guide you and inform so you can use Apple's planning guides to best effect.\n\nHere's my TLDR advice:\n\n\n*\n\n*Empower each Mac user to use their work email as their Apple ID and have no form of payment associated with these accounts.\n\n*Expect them to handle purchases / updates with a discretionary budget of gift cards that work provides, so you'll train them or get them to Apple for training so they can perform basic tasks / troubleshooting without needing your help. Treat one-off purchases like other things you use expense reports for and review all purchases quarterly or annually to see which apps you want everyone to be using.\n\n*Enroll your work in Apple's VPP program (even though it's designed for iOS - you will be forced to think about how to deploy apps and the resources there are worth your time to read / understand.) My guess is VPP will come to Macs this year with 10.9 - but that's wild speculation on my part.\n\n*Use one account to gift required apps to each user account if you find gift cards unworkable. Use this for purchases that are role-based as opposed to exploratory or one-off needs.\n\n*Consider enrolling in Joint Venture so Apple can provide your first line of help desk training and support in a business setting.\n\n", "Q: Restore Mac Office from TIme Machine Backup I purchased a Mac Office license through my college, and I recently backed up and restored my Mac using Time Machine. I did not RESTORE from the Time Machine backup as a whole, but rather hand-picked files and directories. I am not willing to do a FULL restore, as I would end up with the same problems that caused me to reformat in the first place.\nI've been dicked around by Microsoft, and they cannot help me. \"You have not paid enough for the license ($40 through my college) so you must contact them for support.

Copying \"Microsoft Office\" in the \"Applications\" folder will not work.\nIt is going from the backup directly onto the same physical machine. Any hardware locks will validate.\n\nA: That actual License file is /Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.office.licensing.plist Moving this file from the backup back into place may fix the problem.\nYou may also want to try coping the files from ~/Library specifically ~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/ ~/Library/Preferences/Microsoft/ and all the ~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.* files.\n", "Q: Load .bash_profile automatically on Terminal.app startup?

I hope that means using only built-in Mac software, such as Disk Utility and Terminal for commands. If necessary, I will reluctantly use a commercial tool. (As of this writing, the latest is Crucial_m4_040H-04-00.zip.)\nI've have waded through a muck of articles about how to copy an ISO to a bootable USB stick, but I have not found a solution that works and that I'm comfortable trying. \n\n\n*\n\n*For example, I read How do I burn an ISO on a USB drive on Mac OS X? and followed the steps. The steps seemed to work, but the resulting USB stick would not boot. I tried two different sticks to reduce the chances that it was a hardware issue.\n\n*I've also read Updating firmware on Macs without a superdrive too. One part recommends using rEFIt-Syslinux.dmg_.zip. But how do I know if that DMG is up-to-date, reliable, and trustworthy? Even if it is, that route seems unnecessarily complicated. Why is there not a simpler option?\n\nA: I downloaded the Crucial_m4_040H-04-00.zip and followed this tutorial and everything seemed to work for me. I hope this helps.\n\nA: This does not answer the question directly but it applies to a very similar problem. I faced the same issue recently when trying to update the Firmware of my Samsung EVO 840. The people at Samsung who wrote the instructions for OS X are either trolls or have no knowledge of the subject.\nI also tried countless ways of making a bootable USB with the firmware (also with rEFInd), but eventually it became clear that the only viable way was to burn it to a CD or DVD and boot from it.\nIn case you have an optical drive (external one does not work), you could try the same.\nSteps are outlined here.\nDisclaimer: Try this at your own risk.\n\nA: Not sure if you have resolved the issue, but I'll explain how I did it here in case it's useful for other people.\nI was trying to upgrade firmware for a Crucial m4 256G SSD on a mid-2012 27\" iMac. The iMac does have its original internal HD, which turns to be crucial for solving the problem.\nThe main problem was that iMac refused to boot from an external USB drive, even using rEFInd.\nThe following steps worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install rEFInd\n\n*Use UNetBootIn to create a bootable USB drive from Crucial's firmware updating ISO. This USB drive contains both syslinux and Crucial's firmware (which I think is in boot2880.img)\n\n*Erase the internal HD with Master Boot Record and FAT32 file system\n\n*Use dd to copy the bootable USB drive to the internal HD, e.g. dd if=/dev/rdisk2s1 of=/dev/rdisk1s1 bs=4m. Note that this does a byte-to-byte copy, so using a small USB drive if you can to save time.\n\n*Remove USB drive and reboot. rEFInd should be able to find a Linux OS on the internal HD. Boot from that Linux OS, then choose the second \"default\" option from the boot loader menu. The upgrader should run then.\n\n\nHope this helps!\n\nA: I created a USB drive from Windows with Rufus, MBR layout (BIOS or UEFI-CSM, FAT32) and ISO image mode.

You'll find the script at Yeraze/CalendarHangout and a brief description of the solution here.\n\nA: Calendar doesn't have a way for showing that.  \nIf there's some reason that you wouldn't just open your Google calendar to get that information, I think that you could drag the calendar event out of Calendar and onto your desktop.  It will create an .ics file, which is a text file.  You could then open it in TextEdit and look for the video field.

I've deleted the Apple ID from received iMessages to see if that would fix it, but it has failed to give the desired outcome.\nHow do I need to configure iMessage on the iPhones so that each person is their own \"entity\" and prevent \"crossing wires\"?\n\nA: iMessage isn't designed to work with just one Apple ID. Instead of having all the iPhones and iPad on one Apple ID, it will be necessary to set up additional Apple IDs for the different users.\nWhen you setup an iOS device and put in your Apple ID, it provisions ALL such services to that Apple ID.

It includes the use of eject key. But since retina macbooks dont have eject key how do I shutdown/reboot the retina mac.\nThis link is having query regarding puting it to sleep but I cannot see shutdown/reboot. Is pressing power button and selecting the choice the only option I have ??\n\nA: Just use the power button in place of eject for any keyboard shortcut that worked with eject (this also applies to older MacBooks, by the way).\n\nA: To gracefully and quickly initiate a shutdown of a retina mac (or any mac that doesn't have a media eject key) press ctrl+power (to display the shutdown dialogue box) you can then release those keys and, since shutdown is the default selected option, just press return to shutdown the mac.\nTo restart gracefully press ctrl + power. Again, this will pull up the shutdown dialogue box but you will have to mouse over to the restart option to select it. This isn't a true 'keyboard shortcut' but I am not aware of one existing.\nFor many keyboard shortcuts you can use the power button in place of eject, but for the shutdown and restart commands doing so will initiate a hard shutdown/restart and you may loose data.\nNote: The ctrl + power key combination is the same as holding down power and waiting ~2 seconds for the shutdown menu dialogue to appear.\n", "Q: Can i remove MacBook battery when Mac is still running?

For a while I've been taking photos on my iPhone and then editing them using iPhoto on my iPad. I select the photos from the Photo Stream since they are conveniently available on the iPad. It occurred to me recently that perhaps this is not a good idea.\nWhat are the pros and cons of doing this? Could I lose the edited images since the pictures are from the Photo Stream? Should I be transferring the photos from the iPhone to the iPad before editing them?\nSome guidance would be appreciated.\n\nA: Edited photos in iPhoto on iOS is an interesting situation - one that there is not much documentation on, and one that seems like a one-way street. Photos can enter, but cannot \"escape\". You can edit photos, but you can't deleted Edited photos from the iPhoto app.\nIt is safe to edit your photos that are currently stored in Photostream without fear of losing them for good.* When you edit a photo, it is stored in the \"Edited\" album of iPhoto. Even when that photo is deleted from Camera Roll (if it was ever there), and Photostream (I have tested this to verify accuracy), it will not be deleted from the Edited album in iPhoto. \nThere is no need to transfer these photos to your iPad before editing them.\n\n*The only thing that I would be a little concerned about is if the iPad dies (prompting a restore), or the app gets deleted. It is very likely that if the app is deleted from a working iOS device, that the edited versions of all edited photos would be lost. Keep in mind that iOS iPhoto edits are non-destructive, so it likely comes down to a file that is saved somewhere within iPhoto that remembers these changes - how that works when the \"Edited\" photo is deleted I don't. Perhaps those photos are then saved in the app.\nIf the iPad is wiped, and then restored, iCloud should remember those edits, and with the restore, it should (this theory hasn't been personally proved) restore those edited copies.\nHowever, both of these problems probably exist even if you transfer the photos to your iPad.\n", "Q: Prevent iOS Users from updating iOS Version Using Apple Configurator I have a scenario, where my employees are give iPads and iPhones to help with their daily tasks.

Some options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install an AppleTV / tvOS beta software profile to the device. This will cause the device to check the wrong repository for updates.\n\n*Block the update servers from the network that the device uses for internet.\n\n*Configure a DNS server that allows blocking the resolution of the update servers.\n\n\nSource and additional information: https://simplemdm.com/2016/09/18/how-to-block-ios-updates/\n", "Q: Can I still update my free apps if I change my iTunes Account Country? If I change my iTunes Acccount country, I realize that I'll lose the ability to update apps for which I've paid.\nBut what about apps that were freely purchased like : Facebook, Twitter, ... Will they still get updates ?\n\nA: Since they're free, just re-download them. You can update them on your iOS device, but it's a bit of a problem since you need to switch accounts, and you can only do that once every 90 days.

This is convenient for me because it is an isolated, secure, \"portable\" entity where all of my work can be stored in one place.  It has persisted over three laptops and several hard drive changes (basically copy it from one to another as needed).  It has worked great.  In the past, I've used ChronoSync as my backup utility of choice: separate documents to backup drive excluding sparsebundle, then a second document to backup the mounted bundle as a filesystem -- thus, entire bundle is not copied every time, just changed files.  But, I have recently started using Time Machine given the wonderful integration it provides.  However, I'm not convinced it is handling this large sparsebundle properly:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can't seem to access it via the Time Machine itself.  The only option presented is \"restore\".  I don't want to \"try\" that out.  I created a test bundled (100MB) with the same security.  I put a few files in... manual backup via TM... added a few more... manual backup... deleted a few... manual backup.  However, when I restore those via the TM interface, the changes don't seem to track.  There is indeed a backup instance for each manual backup, but the instances don't correspond to the changes made.  Perhaps I am going faster than the system is actually writing to disk? (probably 1 minute between changes).  \n\n*Directly accessing the filesystem (Backups.backupdb) shows the large 16GB sparse bundle present in most (all?... haven't checked) backup instances (e.g., 2013-02-28-042451).  The filesystem reports it as 16GB, prompts for the password if I attempt to mount it, but then fails with \"no mountable file system\".  I guess this is to be expected as I don't think Time Machine backups up the ENTIRE bundle each time... but I can't even mount the ORIGINAL bundle from the first backup, which I would presume is a true copy.  \nThe questions are: does Time Machine definitely handle large sparsebundles properly?  Should I be concerned about my testing with the small bundle?  Is there any way to access individual files within a Time Machine backup of a large sparsebundle, or does the whole bundle need to be restored?\n\nA: The only time I've seen the error you report was when I stored a sparse disk bunds inside another sparse disk bundle and both were remotely mounted on a fairly slow network storage device such as a Time Capsule.\nIn those cases, I've often excluded the original image directory from the Time Machine backups, since it works in theory (and most of the time in practice), you can't get any benefits of browsing those files on a Time Machine backup.\nI usually set up rsync or another incremental backup tool to copy those files on a schedule I like (perhaps automating it all with Lingon 3).\nBy restoring the file to a local drive, you'll know if the failure to mount is due to an actual corruption or just network indirection and time out.\nOnce it's copied to an attached or internal disk, you might also be able to use Disk Utility to patch up filesystem errors although with encrypted sparse disk bundles, that is often not successful.\n\nA: Time Machine works at a file level, with no facility to perform incremental changes within files.  As such, your Sparsebundle may be backed up in it's entirety every time it changes in the slightest, depending on how large it is.  Of course, you have to wait up to 1 hour (+the time it take to make the backup, depending on how large the queue is and where your file sits in it) to ensure those changes are included in the backup.  Also if your Sparsebundle is in use (mounted...) then it may well skip it until the file lock is freed\nThis is a terrible system, and one that we might not see change until the underlying filesystem is suitable upgraded (or replaced) to include such useful facilities as incremental block level changes rather than simple file level ones, and/or deduplication etc.  One early victim of this scenario were users who used the original Filevault system for encrypting their home folders.  Time Machine would not backup their home folders until such time as they logged out because the Sparseimage file was constantly locked by the fact the user had it mounted.  And even when the user did log out, it would proceed to make a hugely inefficient backup of the whole thing again and again - on the assumption that they simply logged out and didn't just turn off etc...  Not very clever.  To try to ameliorate this the Sparseimage spec was ammended to allow for Sparsebundles. Instead of a single big file, a sparse bundle is a bundle (directory) containing a number of files called bands, each in the order of 8 MB in size. This means even though to the end user the sparse bundle appears as a single file, it is composed of smaller files. As of Mac OS X 10.8, the bands are 8.4 MB each. When the content of the image changes, one or more band files is changed, created, or deleted. This allows backup software (such as Time Machine) to operate more efficiently, but it's just a bodge to attempt to mimic block level changes in individual files, which is limited to 8Mb \"blocks\"...\nSo to answer your questions directly, 1) it handles them properly, where properly means the same as any other file, it's just that your particular use (leaving it open and mounted) may not result in efficient backups that are taken regularly, especially if you rarely unmount the file, and 2) yes, you will need to pull back the whole file to view it's contents.  The TM restore interface is also file specific.  It may have quick-look plugins to allow you to view simple files inline like JPGs etc, but not for a complex file like a sparsebundle.\nOn the bright side, you already have a licensed copy of ChronoSync, which is super useful, and I would continue to use this to perform incremental backups of your sparsebundle whilst it is mounted, you can use the same drive as your TM images too.\n", "Q: Script to unmount mounted image automatically after some time I have a sparse image that can be mounted as an encrypted volume. \nI want to make sure it doesn't stay mounted once I am done using it.\nTo get help doing that, I had earlier asked this question, but got no response.\nSo, I am asking this new, hopefully simpler question:\nHow can I do the following:\n1) When the volume is mounted, a script should start running.\n2) The script should ask even hour whether the volume should be unmounted, and depending on the response unmount the volume (If that is too complicated, this will suffice as well: The script should just attempt to unmount the volume, and indicate if the unmount failed due to the volume being in use)\n3) The script should stop executing once the volume is unmounted (ideally by \"listening\" for its unmount event, or if that's not possible, simply as the next step in the script's execution once it has effected the unmount -- the former having the benefit that even a manual unmount would end the script)\nI have only very recently moved to the Mac from Windows and have no experience with AppleScript. So, a working script would be ideal, but if I am given pointers on how to carry out the individual steps, I should be able to piece them together as well, hopefully.\nThanks.\n\nA: Here is a way to accomplish most of this using a simple Automator script:\n\nSave the script as an Application. Place on desktop or dock. When you want to open the encrypted disk image, simply drop it onto the script icon and it will mount it, pause, and ask for confirmation from you to close the disk image after a certain amount of time has elapsed. The only thing here is that if you choose not to have it unmount, you will need to manually unmount later. You can also remove the confirmation prompt altogether. Then you will simply get an error message if it tries to unmount while still open (which should also stop the script from running).\n", "Q: What's the easiest way to copy the current URL in Fluid?

So I downloaded AppWrapper again and after launching it the script detected that it was accessing the file. \nI'm sure the developer made a mistake and instead of saving the file inside the appWrapper folder he saved it in ~/Library/Application Support.\nFor those interested, here's the script:\n#!/usr/sbin/dtrace -s\n\n\\#pragma D option quiet\n\nBEGIN\n{\n  printf(\"\\n   Timestamp           gid   uid   pid  ppid execname     function           current directory file name\\n\\n\");\n}\n\nsyscall::open:entry,   \nsyscall::unlink:entry,  \nsyscall::rename:entry\n/strstr(stringof(copyinstr(arg0)), $1) != NULL/\n{\n      printf(\"%Y %5d %5d %5d %5d %-12s %-10s %25s %s\\n\", walltimestamp, gid, uid, pid, ppid, execname, probefunc, cwd, stringof(copyinstr(arg0)));\n}\n\n", "Q: Show desktop keyboard shortcut doesn't work I have F5 key bound to the show desktop shortcut in keyboard shortcuts.

(UK) My friend sold me his old iPhone because mine got stolen and he didn't need his any more. However, in order to unlock it so I can use my O2 sim, his network (3mobile) require the original receipt for the handset. He doesn't have it, so they refuse to unlock it. What are my options?\n\nA: Three UK will provide unlocking for a device on payment of a fee. The requirement of the sales receipt may be their attempt at a fraud/theft prevention mechanism to make sure that stolen phones cannot be unlocked and reused. \nIf your friend purchased the device from 3 then he should be able to verify identity with them through payment history, and enable the route to unlocking the device.  \nWhen unlocked you will not receive and unlock code like some devices, instead the identity of the phone is passed to the Apple activation servers so then next time the device connects for activation it receives the unlock command.\n\nA: 3mobile has no obligation to unlock this device without the receipt (or whatever other terms they stipulate). Your best option is to search on eBay for someone who will unlock a device from 3mobile. You should be able to find a solution for under $10.\n\nA: Have a look: \nhttp://iclarified.com/unlock/index.php (unlocking)\nand\nhttp://iclarified.com/jailbreak/index.php (jailbreaking)\n", "Q: Sleep button broken. How do I find out which part is affected? The sleep/power button of my iPhone 4 is broken; it suddently didn't really \"click\" anymore and just hardly reacted on my actions. For some hours by clicking really firm it still worked, but then the button refused to do any job.\nI found out about a way to lock the phone via the touchpad, but when my battery is empty or the device switches off by any other reasons, I will not be able to switch it on anymore. So I did some research as I want to repair it on my own. I found out that the button itself can be affected (and replaced), and there is the holder for this button, which can also be affected.\nHow can I find out, which one of the two are broken - ideally without opening the device?\n\nA: You will most likely need to open the device to tell this. I used to work at an Apple Store and am familiar with the design of the iPhone 4 internals. Good luck. iPhones are not fun to repair.\nAlso an iPhone with a broken power button will still turn on after the battery dies.

I have problems with processes that leak memory. They cause my hard drive to be filled with swap files in /private/var/vm.\nI would like leaking processes to be killed at sight by the OS.

One can use a bit of bash script with either top or ps to dig out the list of process and memory size.\nFrom this filtered list, I would use the leaks command (see man 1 leaks) per process PID. If the total amount of leaked memory reported by the command is higher than yet another threshold, I would then kill and respawn it.\nNOTE: You should take care not to kill any OS/System processes without knowing what you do. To avoid this situation, you should perhaps filter out the list using a \"white list\" approach.\n\nA: ulimit on most platforms does not work as expected.\nIf this is not a desktop app, run the offender with a proper process supervisor such as https://github.com/arya/bluepill\nIf this is a desktop app, contact the app developers.

I have been chatting extensively on my iPhone via text messages. I always have my phone on silent and the vibrations seem to really run down the battery. It's a waste because a lot of the time I have the person's text window open already and I don't need a non-visual alert. But if I have the phone locked in my pocket I want it. I assume the answer is no but is there any way to disable sounds or vibrations when the phone is unlocked? Even though Apple can be stingy with settings this seems like a worthwhile one to add doesn't it?\n\nA: When it's unlocked, you could simply mute it, and remember to unmute it when you remove it from your eyesight - Turn off \"Vibrate on Silent\" in Settings > Sounds.  Only a workaround, but perhaps useful.\n", "Q: How can I get calendar events to consistently sync across all my devices? I just recently set up iCloud to sync calendars between my iPhone, iPad and Mac. Sometimes it works perfectly and sometimes one or the other of the 3 devices is missing a particular event. \nWhat gives? Is there configuration details that I can check?\n\nA: The Calendar app on your Mac by default will have two calendars listed as \"On My Mac\" (\"Home\" & \"Work\" are the calendar names). Be careful because any events added here will not sync to any other devices. I recommend deleting these calendars entirely. If you have many events on these calendars, you can drag & drop each event to the correct iCloud calendar. Or you can select each of the \"On My Mac\" calendars and go to File > Export > Export to save them to a file. Those exported files can then be imported back into the appropriate iCloud calendar.\nBy default all events on iPhone & iPad should sync to iCloud. Check that you don't have another calendar setup (possibly through Gmail, etc.). You can check this on your iOS device by opening Settings.app, and selecting Mail, Contacts, and Calendars. Under each account, you will see a list of services that account is providing - for example, it might say just \"Mail\", or \"Mail, Calendars, Notes\". You can select the account and switch off extraneous calendars to prevent events from being created there. Also, scroll down on that page, and you can change the Default Calendar.\nYou can also login to iCloud.com and view the calendar as it exists on the actual iCloud servers. This should help you to deduce which devices are providing the most trouble.\n", "Q: Are there ways to set up advanced play count on iTunes, tracking total artist play count, etc? I'm wondering if there are advanced ways to track play count in iTunes.  I want to be able to see who my top played artists and composers are, not just songs.  Is there a way to, say, at the end of the month, see which artists and composers have been played the most, and specifically, for how many hours.  I'm on a PC, by the way.\n\nA: Doug Adams has an app called MySpins which provides that kind of information. \nOh, sorry, you're on a PC; it's a Mac app. Anyway, I'll leave the answer for any Mac users who are looking for such a solution.\n\nA: I wish I had a direct answer using iTunes, which I don't. If you don't mind your play information going to an online service I highly recommend Last.fm and their iTunes plugin. Their service lets you easily view top-played songs and artists over different time periods.\n", "Q: Is it safe to delete the /Developer folder on Mac OS X 10.7.5 (Lion)? My computer originally had Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) installed on it but has since been upgraded to OS X 10.7 (Lion). I noticed that the /Developer folder is still on the hard drive even though none of its files appear to have been modified for nearly two years. Is it safe to delete /Developer or is there some reason to keep it around?\nChris Rea's answer includes a link to a guide to uninstall Xcode, which seems to suggest that the contents of /Developer are only used by versions of Xcode prior to 4.3. I have already installed Xcode 4.6 on my machine, so I should be able to remove /Developer and everything under it. That being said, the following statement in the aforementioned guide puzzled me a bit.\n\nsudo /Developer/Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=xcodedir\n\nThis command is basically a shortcut to the previously mentioned “/Developer/Library/uninstall-developer-folder” script. If you want to ditch the /Developer directory, run this command rather than manually deleting it through the Finder.\n\nWhy should I run this script instead of simply deleting /Developer through the Finder?\nThis question is related, but I don't want to fully remove Xcode 4. I just want to remove all traces of Xcode that are not needed by the latest version.\n\nA: Yes, it looks like it should be safe to remove /Developer if you have already installed version 4.3 or later of Xcode. The Xcode section of the Apple Developer Support Center actually tells you to do this (emphasis mine).\n\nI've installed the latest version of Xcode from the Mac App Store, but a previous version of Xcode (4.2.1 or earlier) keeps launching. What should I do?\n\nTo run the latest version of Xcode, make sure you are launching Xcode.app from the Applications folder. Xcode 4.3 and later is packaged on the Mac App Store as a single application and installs in your Applications folder as Xcode.app.\nPrevious versions of Xcode placed the tools and frameworks in the Developer folder. You can delete the older version of Xcode by dragging the Developer folder to the trash.\n\nFurthermore, as pointed out by bispymusic, /Developer no longer exists with Xcode 4.3. Specifically (emphasis mine):\n\nThe simplification afforded by repackaging Xcode 4.3 as a single app bundle eliminates the need for the /Developer directory containing prior versions of Xcode. As a result, the Install Xcode application and the uninstall-devtools command line script are also no longer needed.\nNote: The first time you run Xcode 4.3, you are prompted with a dialog to delete the Install Xcode application from the Applications directory if one is resident, and to remove any older installation of Xcode (Figure 4). These actions are optional, Xcode 4.3 can co-exist with older installations of Xcode on the same Mac. Some operations may require an administrator password to enable them if you switch from one version of Xcode to another.\nFigure 4  Option to remove older versions of Xcode\n\nIf you choose not to delete these items on the first launch of Xcode 4.3, you can remove the /Developer folder and the Install Xcode application by dragging them to the Trash at any time.\n\n\nA: Did you already upgrade your Xcode to a newer version, one stored under /Applications? If you upgraded to a newer Xcode stored in the new location and also installed the updated Command Line Tools from within Xcode, then what you have under the root /Developer folder is likely all stale and you can probably safely delete /Developer.  To be safe, archive the folder elsewhere for the time being, then nuke it later when you are confident you don't need it.\nIf you did not install the more recent Xcode, I'm guessing the contents under /Developer may still be \"in effect.\"  Have a look at this guide to uninstall the developer tools in that case.  Make sure your environment variables don't refer to any paths within the folder.\n\nA: If you have Xcode 4.3 or later, it should be safe to remove this file. Apple elaborates on it here: \nWhat's New in Xcode\n", "Q: Why does AT&T claim I used more data than my iPhone does? I reset my data usage in Settings (iPhone 4s) at the start of every billing cycle. Every month I near my data limit of 2GB so it's important to me to be careful of this number. However it seems like every day myAT&T claims my data usage went up by something in the neighborhood of 10 to 30 MB more than the usage statistics in Settings say. Now I'm pretty sure Settings knows how much data is transferred. Why does AT&T inflate this, is there any way to get them to stop, and does any other provider not do this?\n\nA: The data counters on all phones are approximate, and they're most likely not artificially inflating your data usage. In the future, you can check AT&T's website to track the exact amount of data you'll be billed for.\n", "Q: Ruby 2.0.0 install via RVM: errors surrounding openssl Using: Mountain Lion 10.8.2, RVM 1.18.15\nHaving trouble with, apparently, openssl when trying to install Ruby 2.0.0 via RVM:\n$ rvm install 2.0.0\n...\nExtracting openssl to /Users/meltemi/.rvm/src/openssl-1.0.1c\nConfiguring openssl in /Users/meltemi/.rvm/src/openssl-1.0.1c.\nError running './Configure darwin64-x86_64-cc -I/Users/meltemi/.rvm/usr/include -L/Users/meltemi/.rvm/usr/lib zlib no-asm no-krb5 --prefix=/Users/meltemi/.rvm/usr no-shared ', please read /Users/meltemi/.rvm/log/ruby-2.0.0-p0/openssl/configure.log\nCompiling openssl in /Users/meltemi/.rvm/src/openssl-1.0.1c.\nError running 'make', please read /Users/meltemi/.rvm/log/ruby-2.0.0-p0/openssl/make.log\n\nso I brew install openssl to update openssl to 1.0.1e hoping that would help but there were still more errors (see \"long output\").\nSo, dug around Stack Exchange and loosely followed suggestion on this post which recommended rvm get head (as opposed to my typical rvm get stable) and noticed:\n$ rvm get head\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n...\n100 1620k  100 1620k    0     0   275k      0  0:00:05  0:00:05 --:--:--  479k\n\nUpgrading the RVM installation in /Users/meltemi/.rvm/\n    RVM PATH line found in /Users/meltemi/.bashrc /Users/meltemi/.zshrc.\n    RVM sourcing line found in /Users/meltemi/.bash_profile /Users/meltemi/.zshrc.\n    Installing rvm gem in 1 gemsets ERROR:  Loading command: install (LoadError)\n    cannot load such file -- openssl\nERROR:  While executing gem ...

For some weeks my MacBook 6.2 does not switch to the integrated graphics adapter (Intel HD). This is especially crucial when I work on battery (which happens quite often).

It has three modes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dynamic Switching: An alias for the built-in automatic graphics switching feature in OS X.\n\n*Integrated Only: Forces the more battery-friendly graphics on and disallows automatic switching.\n\n*Discrete Only: Forces the more power-hungry graphics on and disallows automatic switching.\n\n", "Q: Force umount of stale NFS shares Whenever my NFSv4 server becomes unreachable a little window pops up offering me to disconnect the affected shares. \nIt looks like this:\n\nIf I choose to Ignore iTunes becomes unresponsive because of the playlists that point to MP3 files located on those NFS shares that have become unreachable.

Again, check the terms of service - you will likely be granting them permission to erase, modify and inspect your computer when you hand them the hardware.\nIf your goal is to track what they do, why not ask them to provide you with steps and then check their work by running tmutil compare to see which files changed after service from a backup that happened before service?\nI've never found key loggers to be useful and other recording software is buggy and slow IMO.\nWhat I do is delete the drive entirely and give them a test account or use FileVault to encrypt everything you care to \"watch\" and just not give them the password or key to decrypt the volume if for some reason you din't want unauthorized access.\n\nA: Not really as the repay guy might well take the hard disk out and look at it in another machine or boot the Mac off an external hard disk and so your keylogger will not be run. Both of these cases are good practice by the repairer as it cuts down the number of things that he has to look at at one stage.\nIf you Mac needs repairing assume you will lose all your data.

I'd like to refer to the service as http://mytest.com:4433 from the browser or any script that I write. How could I set the DNS on OSX to do this? Thanks!\n\nA: You could add a new line in your hosts file (see man hosts(5)). The easiest that I know of would be to open a Terminal and use nano to edit the file. You could type this in your terminal:\nsudo nano /etc/hosts\n\n(replace nano by vi if you are more familiar with the latter). Then go at the end of the file and add something like this:\n127.0.0.1    mytest.com\n\nSave the file (key combination for nano is (it's a o upper case): Ctrl + O).\nThe file hosts is read by mDNSResponder which is the local DNS cache on OS X (incl.

When copying text or filenames containing umlauts or e.g. å ä ö, OS X can't seem to handle the characters in a sane way. Apparently this is a well-known problem. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.wandisco.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/401/55/problems-with-umlauts--in-filenames-on-mac-os-x \n\n*https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/94418/os-x-umlauts-in-utf8-nfd-yield-package-inputenc-error-unicode-char-u8-not\nHere is an example of the usual result when copying text from a filename or from inside a pdf in Preview and pasting it in an editor. The first line is the result, the other one is corrected.\n\nThe difference is clearly visible, since the current font (Courier Prime) doesn't support the first version.\nIs there any way to fix this? Alternatively, is there any OS X-service available to \"clean up\" text or normalize it in the correct way?\n\nA: HFS+ requires filenames to be in decomposed form (LATIN SMALL LETTER A + COMBINING DIAERESIS) instead of composed form (LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS). You can use iconv to convert text to composed form:\n$ echo -n ä | xxd -p\nc3a4\n$ touch ä\n$ ls | tr -d '\\n' | xxd -p\n61cc88\n$ ls | tr -d '\\n' | iconv -f utf-8-mac -t utf-8 | xxd -p\nc3a4\n\n\nHFS+ does not use NFD (normal form decomposed). From http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#qa/qa1173/_index.html:\n\nImportant: The terms used in this Q&A, precomposed and decomposed, roughly correspond to Unicode Normal Forms C and D, respectively. However, most volume formats do not follow the exact specification for these normal forms. For example, HFS Plus (Mac OS Extended) uses a variant of Normal Form D in which U+2000 through U+2FFF, U+F900 through U+FAFF, and U+2F800 through U+2FAFF are not decomposed (this avoids problems with round trip conversions from old Mac text encodings).\n\nSomething like this might also work:\npython -c 'import unicodedata as ud; print ud.normalize(\"NFC\", u\"\\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER A}\\N{COMBINING DIAERESIS}\")'\n", "Q: Moving from Snow Leopard directly to Mountain Lion with Time Machine First time I've asked a question here but I've used Stack Exchange for answers to many many OSX questions so, first off, great big thanks for that.\nI searched the archives but didn't find an answer to this or a similar question.\nI am moving directly to 10.8 from 10.6.8. I am going to do a clean install of 10.8 (as my early 2011 MBP is acting wonky lately, fresh is better) from USB. As I understand it, I can use Migration Assistant to pull the data I want off my Time Machine backup. However, I have also seen (here and elsewhere) that some finagling may be needed to get 10.8 to recognize the 10.6.8 backup. Should I be concerned?\nThanks!\nMicah\n\nA: In general you should not be concerned. However, if you are concerned I recommend you do the following instead:\nUpgrade to Mountain Lion (do not do a clean wipe). Then re-install Mountain Lion again. Whereas the upgrade essentially checks and patches the system to make it the new OS, re-installing will effectively wipe the entire OS, leaving your user & network data intact. This is exactly what wiping clean & restoring from Time Machine backup via Migration Assistant will do.\nIf your system is acting wonky, it's just as likely that your user profile is the culprit. If so, both methods will keep your system potentially wonky. In this case you will want to  manually backup any necessary files (generally your home folder) to an external hard drive, wipe clean, upgrade, and then manually bring back the files you actually need.\n", "Q: Compare multi-digit version numbers in bash Trying to write a script that searches for the version of the Application then returns the value.

A sequential comparison in that same order will yield a clear result.\nThe following bash function will return 0 (true) if two version numbers are not equal, 1 (false) if they are, as long as the variables $version_1 and $version_2 both contain only an arbitrary number of digit groups separated by periods:\nfunction versions_not_equal {\n    while [[ $version_1 != \"0\" || $version_2 != \"0\" ]]; do\n        (( ${version_1%%.*} != ${version_2%%.*} )) && return 0\n        [[ ${version_1} =~ \".\" ]] && version_1=\"${version_1#*.}\" || version_1=0\n        [[ ${version_2} =~ \".\" ]] && version_2=\"${version_2#*.}\" || version_2=0\n    done\n    false\n}\n\nImplementing other comparisons, like greater or equal, is as simple as changing the comparison operator of the arithmetic evaluation (i.e. (( ${version_1%%.*} >= \"${version_2%%.*}\" ))).\n\nA: I can give you a long example of \"if the checked version is between min  and max\"  and you can optimize it for your needs changing head -1/tail -1 and cutting 1 variable:\nmin_ver=\"a-1.1.1\"\nmax_ver=\"a-9.1.1\"\ncheck_ver=\"a-2.2.9\"\nif [ \"$( echo -e \"${min_ver}\\\\n${max_ver}\\\\n${check_ver}\" | sort --sort=version | head -2 | tail -1)\" == ${check_ver} ]\nthen\n  echo YES - apply  ${check_ver}\nfi\n\n\nA: Here's another solution that:\n\n\n*\n\n*does not run any external command apart from tr\n\n*has no restriction on number of parts in version string\n\n*can compare version strings with different number of parts\n\n\nNote that it's Bash code using array variables.\ncompare_versions()\n{\n    local v1=( $(echo \"$1\" | tr '.'

If possible, always eject a disk before unplugging it or turning it off.\n\nAfter looking around on various forums I have tried turning off the \"put hard disks to sleep when possible\".  This seemed to make the problem occur less often but it still occurs.\nThe only way to fix seems to be to reboot the Mac mini.\nIs there a way to stop this or to auto-reconnect the drive when it wakes from sleep?\nThis problem coupled with the fact that half the time the Mac mini won't wake up at all is really bugging me!  My MacBook Pro works great, but the Mac mini is a pain!\nThe external drive is a Seagate STBV2000200 Expansion Desktop.\n\nA: It's one of the major flaws with newer seagate drives (alongside no on/off switch so you have to pull the power cord out the back and risk damaging the disk). They are just not compatible with Macs unfortunately. They go to sleep and there's no way for the Mac to reconnect to them. I've contacted Seagate about this and they said \"Sorry there's nothing they can do about it, perhaps I can contact Apple and they can do something about it\". Great..!\nI basically don't buy Seagate any more and don't recommend Seagate to any friends or family with Macs.

It does have a serial number (starting with VMW...).  This is different to the host Mac.   \nVMware Fusion seems to generate the serial automatically, but it is not obviously stored in the vm's configuration files.  Also not mentioned in the vm logs.  My guess is that it is 'burnt' into the .nvram file when the vm is created or copied.\nAs you know the UUID can be changed, but the only references I can find to changing the serial number relate to downloadable OS X vm images.  For example: Change serial hack  This supports my guess in the previous paragraph.\nLegal? Using downloaded images breaches Apple licenses - but you are not doing this.  Serial number: Not so clear as it does need to be globally unique - it would be bad to change it to a value used by another vm or physical mac.\nBut, I don't understand your need to change the serial.  VMware will make sure it is unique if you copy vms to create development and test environments.\n\nA: Most likely it will not generate a hardware serial number as there is no underlying hardware. And Macs don't require a hardware to even be programmed into the logic board (sometimes the Apple Geniuses forget to program them in when replacing your logic board, for instance).\nI'm at work, away from my Macs, but as a test I checked the hardware serial number of my Windows 7 VM in VirtualBox.

After finding it with Daisy Disk (running a scan as administrator) I've deleted all \"grow\" files in the \"com.apple.coresymbolicationd\" and I've cleared 90 GB of storage space. After rebooting the macbook works fine, all my settings are the same and apparently everything seems to be to be alright. This might help those who have the same issue I had.\n\nA: With the help of a launch daemon you can clear this folder each time you reboot your computer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a file in your home directory called local.rm.coresymbolicationd.plist using the editor of your choice with the following contents:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>local.rm.coresymbolicationd</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/usr/bin/find</string>\n        <string>/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.coresymbolicationd</string>\n        <string>-type</string>\n        <string>f</string>\n        <string>-exec</string>\n        <string>/bin/rm</string>\n        <string>{}</string>\n        <string>+</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>StandardOutPath</key>\n    <string>/var/root/local.rm.coresymbolicationd.out</string>\n    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n    <string>/var/root/local.rm.coresymbolicationd.err</string>\n    <key>WorkingDirectory</key>\n    <string>/var/root</string>\n    <key>UserName</key>\n    <string>root</string>\n    <key>GroupName</key>\n    <string>wheel</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\n\n*Run the following commands from Terminal.app or the terminal application of your choice:\nsudo mv ${HOME}/local.rm.coresymbolicationd.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons\nsudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/local.rm.coresymbolicationd.plist\n\n\n*Reboot. On this and subsequent reboots, files inside that folder will be deleted.\n\nA: Symbolication means replacing memory addresses with symbols (like functions or variables) or for example adding function names and line number information. It is used for debugging and analyzing crash reports.\n/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.coresymbolicationd/data was also about 600 MB on my account, so I guess it's normal. Deleting files in cache folders is generally safe, and /System/Library/Caches/ is even excluded from Time Machine backups.\n\nA: The files stored in the system and user Caches folder are there to speed up your Mac and a process will recreate them if you decide to move them to the Trash and reboot.\nMost programs are well behaved enough to handle you deleting the files from under the running system, but I've also gotten into the habit of moving them to Trash and then rebooting to let the system recreate new folders if needed before deleting the files.\nThis core daemon is virtually undocumented by Apple and the one data file is likely an encrypted sqlite3 database file (or some other binary data store) for internal use by the OS to handle process control.

I am running a Mac Pro 2008 as of the last week I have been shutting down the machine instead of sleeping it due to the 10.8.2 sleep bug that had been floating around. Today I went to start it and no video period, and the USB / the system appeared to be unresponsive wired mouse and keyboard and the usb hub had no sign of power. I have tried 2 different displays connected to each of the different DVI ports. The Mac starts with a Chime onetime it did two. The display never turns on or gray, just no signal.\nI have tried resetting the NVRAM/PRAM and resetting the SMC, still no video?\nAfter the resets the machine appears to be not crashing, normal hard drive boot up activity, start up chime, and the caps lock light is able to turn off and on, was not able to verify system is in fact booting OS X though, I think it is, will verify later. \nHas my graphics card failed? What else can I do to try and get the video back?\nWhen I went to verify if the system was running, it booted up normally everything working fine. The Mac Pro had been left unplugged from Friday 5pm til about 6PM on Sunday.\nJust restarted the Mac Pro and it looks like the Graphics card is back to the same conditions as talked about earlier, although this time I was able to verify that the Mac Pro is still running by remotely logging in.  As shown in the screen capture below, the \"About This Mac More Info...\" shows a missing graphics card name as well as a complete lack of Info with the the Graphics/Displays section of the \"System Information\" Application.\n\n\nA: It seems that there have been problems with these cards and Apple is still fixing them.  I found this article about the ATI 2600 (http://www.itproportal.com/2011/02/21/apple-extends-warranty-mac-pro-video-cards/) which stays that Apple will replace the cards if they are a part of a bad batch they've identified.  I hope that helps.\n-K\n\nA: Your graphics card is probably going bad. Open the chassis and make sure the card is properly seated and fastened in. You can also attempt to VNC if enabled to make sure that the card is in fact the issue. \nThe good news is these cards can be gotten pretty cheap online nowadays, certainly much cheaper than replacing an entire logic board. \n", "Q: Uninstaller that tracks installed files and removes them later On windows I've used various utilities that actively track which files are added during a software install, and I'm sure there must be a good one for os x.  Itrash (http://www.osxbytes.com/) is typical of the 'searching' type of app, which just looks through the system for similarly named files in the cache folders etc.  \nThe closest I've found is Yank (http://www.matterform.com/mac_software/uninstaller/index.html) which does claim to do it, but hasn't been updated since 2009 so trusting something with low level file system monitoring without updates isn't ideal.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Not exactly what you are after but  Apple development tools like dtrace can track all file usage, googling for examples gave this blog which has scripts to record what files are used by which processes.\nAlso you should be able to get a find command using a -B argument.\nAlso note that not all files will be written at instal - User specific files e.g. ~/Library/Preferences and ~/Library/Application Support (or their sandbox equivalents) can't be written until the first run of the program and not the install. Also what happens if two users have run this do you want to remove both sets of files?\n\nA: You have discovered iTrash which searches for related files at the time when you want to delete an application.\nThere are also uninstall apps which track all files used by an application.  So they have a daemon (or helper app) which runs in the background all the time.  Synium's Clean App works in this way - that is what I use.\nEven better read the answers to How do I uninstall a program completely on a Mac? That covers it pretty well.\n\nA: Pressing ⌘I in an installer shows what files would be copied by it. \nInstallers add log files to /var/db/receipts/:\nlsbom /var/db/receipts/com.apple.pkg.MediaFiles.bom\n\nYou can also run sudo opensnoop to see what files are being accessed.\n\nA: Would you be happy with just the \"removes them later\" part? I've been on Macs for nearly twenty years, and don't think it's necessary to track what's installed.\nTake a look at the free preference pane  AppTrap. \nWhen you delete / move an application to the trash, it shows an alert that asks, \"Do you want to move its associated system files too?\" The trash isn't emptied, of course, until the user does so.\n", "Q: Soundflower difficulties I recently downloaded Soundflower so I could record some audio with the imagery I can already record through QuickTime.

This work around may help your issue too.\nA friend suggested an idea that he had been shown. Setup soundflower as a midi simultaneously with your regular output.

For example, Disk Utility, Scannerz, and SMARTReporter all seem to report what I would call a catastrophic failure level, meaning they don't report details, just, for lack of better words, \"good\", \"maybe\", and \"failing\" (please forgive my super high-tech terminology. :-) )\nOthers like smartmontools, TechTool Pro, and I think Drive Genius (not sure on that) can report a lot more detail with a lot of different parameters.\nThe reason I ask is this. I had a drive in my system and I was preparing to do a clean install on it of Mountain Lion. I have TechTools Pro and thought just for kicks I'd check out the SMART status on it to make sure everything was OK before reformatting the drive and doing the install. It came back and reported nothing wrong. In fact, it looked great. \nI went ahead and started doing the install, and about 20 minutes into it the thing starts tapping. If you've ever seen a drummer do one of those rhythms where they're tapping on the drum rim instead the actual drum head, that's about what it sounded like. After maybe about 30 seconds of this the thing starts screeching like crazy. The install terminated. I put an old Snow Leopard install disc into the system and boot off the DVD, and now its saying the drive is unusable and that SMART status has failed.\nIf I checked this drive with extensive SMART capabilities just about 45 minutes before and it reported no problems, what good is SMART testing? Since I'm considering replacing the drive with an SSD, is SMART any better on that?\nThanks.\n\nA: SMART testing is of limited value in many cases, and cannot often predict failure of a hard drive. This is because different hard drive manufacturers implement different parts of the spec and (as you mentioned) different software and OS manufacturers look at different pieces of the spec in interpreting the SMART status.\nBeyond that there are certain mechanical issues that can be difficult or impossible to predict. If your hard drive is tapping now, there are many things that could've caused the mechanical failure and it is hard to say if SMART had a way of knowing about it beforehand.\nSSDs can and do support SMART. Rather than explaining, this Server Fault thread explains it quite well.\n\nA: SMART analysis is a REPORTING technology, not a testing technology. Tools like Scannerz, TechTool Pro, etc. are TESTING tools. There are some implementations of SMART that can perform testing on a drive, but this is vendor specific. SMART implementation also varies from vendor to vendor and the implementation isn't consistent. See the table in the following link, and it will tell you that some SMART parameters are vendor specific:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T.\nThe problem that I see with SMART testing is that it can report a problem which isn't lethal, but some SMART tools will portray the test results in a manner that, for lack of better words, \"scares\" a user into trashing what might be a drive with correctable problems. \nFor example, I had an old 100G drive in an Aluminum PowerBook about 4 years ago that experienced a head crash. TechTool Pro and another graphical SMART presentation tool (whose name eludes me right now) both presented graphs with some indicators pegged to the failure range. One looking at these would react exactly as I did and replace the drive. I ran a scan on the drive with both TechTools Pro and later with Scannerz (after it came out) and both indicated the same thing - numerous sectors in the 98G to 99G had experienced a severe head crash.\nWhat I did was split the drive into two volumes, one ending right before the bad sectors began, and then another which encompassed the rest of the drive including the bad sectors. After partitioning it like this I then deleted the volume containing the bad sectors leaving me with a single volume. I installed this drive into an old 867MHz Titanium and have been using it ever since. It doesn't handle anything critical, I use it to read e-mails and check the weather in the morning, if I go on a trip, I'll take it along to watch DVDs in a motel room. I've been using it like this for years. I wouldn't use the drive for anything critical, but it's still of use. If I run TechTool Pro's SMART analysis on it, it still reports \"imminent doom,\" but Scannerz, which like you said was a \"threshold\" system doesn't indicate that there's anything wrong with the drive. Which one is right? The drive is still in use. This is really a matter of interpreting SMART data, and the way it's being presented to users is generally \"scary\" when it need not be. \nWith all that said, your drive likely experienced a controller failure, and no application in the world could predict it properly. What caused it? Who knows. It could be a chip or other component on the drive's controller that failed, a transient could have burned something out on the controller, who know's. Predicting that is like expecting a weatherman to predict the exact time and location that a bolt of lightning will. \nIn your case, the failure caused the heads to move to an extreme location on the drive, start pounding against something else in the drive causing the \"drumbeat\" sound, and then break, thus causing the screeching sound. I think that if you check out some of the sites that do drive recovery they may have audio recordings that pretty much duplicate your problem.\nTesting software can only do so much. It can't predict the unpredictable.\n", "Q: How to go to tab 5 in Safari?

Even if I'm already viewing the conversation it vibrates every time a message comes in. The main Facebook app doesn't so this, only the standalone Messenger.\nThe only way I've found to stop it is to turn off push notifications entirely, which I don't want to do.\n\nA: You can change vibration settings by opening the Settings.app and selecting the \"Sounds\" option. The two first options are \"Vibrate on Ring\" and \"Vibrate on Silent\". Turn these off to disable all vibrations. However, this will disable vibrations system wide for all apps, not just Messages.\nTo get as close as possible to disabling vibrations for just the messages app:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings.app and navigate to \"Sounds\" -> \"Text Tone\".\n\n*Scroll to the top of the page and select \"Vibration\"\n\n*Scroll to bottom of page (under \"Custom\") and select \"Create New Vibration\".\nNote: you can't create 0 vibration as you have to tap to start the \"recording\". However, you can tap it very lightly to start the \"recording\".\n\n*Tap the screen very lightly and let the recording go until it stops. Like I mentioned, it is perfect, but very close - especially if you tap very lightly.\n\n*Save the Recording (something like \"Minimal Vibe\") and assign that to you text tone vibration pattern.\n\n\nKeep in mind, it is possible to override that vibration pattern when you set custom ringtones or vibration patterns on individual contacts, so if it isn't working quite right for you for certain contacts, be sure to check those settings. Or, the alternative would be to set the \"Minimal Vibe\" settings for just some particular contacts.\n\nA: I solved this :)\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings App\n\n*Notice Center\n\n*Scroll down to Facebook\n\n*Remove the \"Sound\" Checkbox\n\n\nWolla, no sound nor vibration.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Need to re mount usb drive to complete time machine backup (24\" 2009 iMac running Lion 10.7.5)\nI have a Seagate 1t usb hard drive (have done for about 6 months) .

Do battery charging utilities such as Battery Boost Magic pro or Kingsoft battery doctor really make a difference in prolonging the life of an iPad battery?\n\nA: No it really can't. What it can do, is show you how much battery the device has left, and hence motivate you to conserve battery with dimming the screen, and perform activities that are less battery intensive. \nApps in iOS are sandboxed heavily and consequently can't perform system-level functions that might possibly be used to conserve battery. The other problem with this sandboxing is it would likely mean any battery conservation would have to happen while the app is open, and the device unlocked. iOS 5 allows certain processes to continue running in the background, but those include things like using the accelerometer, GPS, and such. This again comes back to iOS apps not allowing access to many system-level processes.\n\nA: Sorry but it does not work you should delete the app quickly and report it to Apple to get your money back.\n", "Q: Does synchronizing google contacts with apple address book send my data to Apple? I am using OS X 10.6.8 and I have a question regarding the address book synchronization.\nDoes synchronizing google contacts with apple address book send my data to Apple?\nIn other words, does the address book application directly sync the contacts with google or does this process goes through Apple servers and/or cloud? I am having a doubt because when I started the sync on my MacBook, the MobileMe icon appeared at the right of the menu bar. MobileMe seems to be related to cloud stuff so, is the contact book application directly interacting with google or not?\n\nA: It does not route through Apple. It syncs directly between Google and your computer. The sync icon you're seeing in the menu bar is probably Sync Services (or iSync), not MobileMe. It's simply a visual indication that it is syncing.\nThe only case where Apple would potentially see any of this data would be in the event of an application crash, and only if it was in the crash report and only if you allowed it to be sent.\n", "Q: File path to file on Mac Mini via LAN I have a bunch of data files on a Mac Mini that I want to read over my wireless LAN in a script (F#, not that it matters I think).

They got deleted and I want to restore them Since Mail.app had trouble connecting to the various accounts, I tried to 'reset' it by removing all accounts and the stored passwords in Keychain Access.app. Then I re-added all the mail accounts.\nHowever, for some reason all configured rules were deleted too, even though they are not directly tied to a specific mail account.\nWhere are these rules stored so that I can restore them from a time machine backup?\n\n\nA: Here's an update to Charles great answer to restore lost Apple Mail Rules which you might lose when upgrading to Mac High Sierra OS10.13.4:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close Apple Mail. Probably on your iPhone and iPad too.\n\n*On your Mac, go to iCloud and uncheck the Mail box so you don't replace the corrupted file from iCloud when reopening Mail.\n\n*Go to an uncorrupted backup copy of Mail. Drill down in your User folder:\n~/Library/Mail/V5/MailData/\nbe sure it's the V5 folder, then open it, find and copy the SyncedFilesInfo.plist file. Soon you will see it's older and bigger than the corrupted new file. \n\n*Now go to your current hard drive and drill down to the same User folder:\n~/Library/Mail/V5/MailData/\nthen open it, find and delete the newer smaller SyncedFilesInfo.plist file and replace it with your older, bigger backup file.\n\n*Now, reopen Mail. Your recovered rules should be there. Go to your Preferences>Rules and activate your rules by checking all the desired boxes. Add or delete a rule just to be sure the file updates itself. If that didn't work, repeat with an older backup file.\n\n*Now close Apple Mail, open iCloud Preferences in the OS, recheck the \"Mail\" box and close iCloud. Life should be all good again.\n\n\nA: The rules are stored in a property list at:\n~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/SyncedRules.plist \n\n\n\n*\n\n*Restore this file from a backup.\n\n*Restart Mail.app.\n\n*Re-enable the rules. \n\n\nThese days check for a V3 folder (El Capitan). Restoring only the SyncedRules.plist may not work as another .plist file indexes the active state of the current rules set. What worked here was to go back to an earlier version of the ~Library/Mail/V3/MailData directory (note that it is in the V3 directory-- not the V2 directory). This takes a few minutes as Mail has to re-import your messages, but it did restore rules which were not restored by restoring the just the ~/Library/Mail/V3/MailData/SyncedRules.plist file only.\n\nA: I had this problem under Mail V2 (Yosemite).  Deleting SyncedRules.plist did not work ; the same rules kept coming back when Mail was restarted.\nThis is due to the rules being synced on iCloud.  To prevent that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Mail.\n\n*Edit ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/SyncedFilesInfo.plist and delete the entry corresponding to SyncedRules.plist. \n\n*Recover SyncedRules.plist from your backup.\n\n*Restart Mail and re-enable the rules.\n\n\nYour recovered rules should now be there.\n-- Charles\n\nA: Since this stuff gave me a headache, i want to share my personal experience from V4. \nMake sure, you delete the SynchedRules.plist in this directory, too:\n~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~mail/Data/V4/SyncedRules.plist\n\nA: Here’s a modification of Longmont Ron’s update of Charles’ answer that doesn’t require actually editing the SyncedRules.plist file:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Mail.app on your Mac\n\n*Recover old, uncorrupted versions (e.g., from Time Machine) of SyncedRules.plist and SyncedFilesInfo.plist\n\n*In the iCloud pane of System Preferences, disable both the main Mail checkbox and, under the Options button next to iCloud Drive, the Mail checkbox there as well (this second-level-down checkbox turned out to be crucial in my experience)\n\n*Replace the corrupted versions of both files in ~/Library/Mail/V5/MailData/\n\n*Relaunch Mail.app and your rules should be back in place (though they may need to be re-enabled — you can option-click one checkbox to toggle them all back on)\n\n*Back in the iCloud pane of System Preferences, re-enable both the main Mail checkbox and, under the Options button next to the iCloud Drive, the Mail checkbox there also\n\n\nA: Having similar issues with my two Mac platforms, an M1 2021 iMac with macOS 13.1 Ventura, and a 2014 MacBook Pro with macOS 11.7.2, Big Sur.  \nUnder 11.7.2 The path to the Rules plist is: ~/Library/Mail/V8/MailData/SyncedRules.plist\nUnder 13.1.0 The path to the Rules plist is: ~/Library/Mail/V10/MailData/SyncedRules.plist\nIn my case, the M1 iMac is the “main computer”.

I was thinking of just restoring my iPad to 6.1.2, then back it up, and then save that backup, but perhaps there's a better way? \n\nA: ~user/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup\nJust copy it :)\nif you want the os too\niOS Firmwares\n\nA: On a Mac, iTunes will save iOS backups to ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup\nOn PC, they're in in %appdata%\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\nWhen iTunes creates these backups, it will only store your user files, not a copy of the OS as well. This doesn't make sense because you can only ever restore the latest version of iOS on a device. Rolling back to a previous version is just not possible.\n\nA: Configure Time Machine and ensure it's backing up the folder where iTunes stores the iOS backups.\nDepending on your needs, you could also archive a snapshot of that folder as desired and store it somewhere that it can't be deleted, since Time Machine could erase older backups if the space runs low on the destination.\n", "Q: AirPlay doesn't work when AirPort Exp. extends my network? I have recently acquired an old first gen AirPort Express and wanted to use it solely for airplaying over to my old and amp.\nI tested configuring with it's own network and works fine. The problem is, when I ask it to join my house's network, which is not an \"Apple network\" and is composed of a few routers extending it. The AirPort still shows on my preferences, is detected by the AirPort Utility but doesn't seem to be reached displaying \"Error -6753\".\nI am figuring there is some port configuration I am ought do (?). I don't remember configuring internal firewall in any of my routers (except for the one hooked to the modem), but maybe this is a known issue?\n[EDIT] Some more details on my equipment:\nI have the ISP's modem, connected to a cheap Huawei wireless router, which has a firewall configured to keep outbound traffic away.\nMy house has an elongated shape, so midway through the rooms there is another Asus (RT-N10+) wireless router, configured to extend the Huawei's network (configured simply as bridge, no firewall, mac filter whatsoever).\nThe AirPort Express would be in the lower floor, still, closer to the Huawei router (thus what I believe it would connect to).\nThe network itself is SSID broadcasted, WAP/WPA2 Personal Encripted.\nI will be trying to AirPlay from iPads, iPhones and a MacBook Pro over the house, which will be connected either to the Huawei or Asus router.\n\nA: It will work wirelessly if you are able to get Wifi from some of the old routers. In other words: you need Wifi signal from your existing network for both your AirPort Express and the Apple device to use AirPlay in this configuration.\nThe Airport Express will work on client mode and will not extend your network, but it will allow AirPlay. This is because AirPorts do not wirelessly extend non Apple networks. See this question for reference.\nI have a similar setup in my home, and my solution was to run an Ethernet cable to the AExp to be able to use it to extend my network, and do AirPlay.\nOn the Error -6753, I've found someone suggesting you have to enable IPv6 on your router.\n\nA: In the link you showed, it states that WiFi signal will be disabled for the AE, providing only ethernet conection to a device wired into the AE. Let's say it would only saves you from installing a long ethernet wire, but it is not an active part of your wifi network for other devices other than the phisically conected.\nSo, your wifi devices will not be able to connect to the AE to perform Airplay, they will conect to your other routers and behave like there was not AE in the network. In short, you are trying to perform Airplay on a Asus/Huawei router.\n\nA: Check your Huawei and your Asus advanced settings to make sure multicast traffic is not being filtered. Does AirPlay work on any other devices? How are they connected to the network?\n\nA: I think AirPlay doesn't work over a bridged Wi-Fi network.\nMy set up is:\n                  Client Airport Express (Airplay server)\n                 /\nAirport Extreme 1 \n                 \\\n                  Bridged Airport Extreme 2\n\nWhen iPad Pro is connected to Airport 1, Airplay can connect. When it is connected to Airport 2 bridged it can't. Also when trying to resolve the situation by moving the iPad directly next to the Airport 1 and power cycling the Wi-Fi radio it still connects to Airport 2. The only way to force the iPad Pro to connect to Airport 1 is to power Airport 2 off which is less than ideal.\n", "Q: Transfering Contacts from Icloud to Iphone My brother and I shared the same apple ID, so all of my contacts from icloud are under his apple ID.I got a new Iphone using my OWN apple id.

Or will it be some kind of different reformatted \"home theatre\" image?\n\nThis question, as it's worded, is difficult to answer.\nQuantitatively speaking, that monitor you're looking at has a native resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. Your MacBook can handle that and you will see a 1920 x 1080 pixel desktop on that monitor. Whether that's \"computer perfect\", given the term isn't something in the common lexicon, is up to you. My personal opinion is that 1920 x 1080 at the working distance most people sit at when they're at their desks, on a 27\" screen, is going to look at little pixelated. Especially coming from a 1440 x 900 native resolution screen that's only 15\" across that you have on a 15\" MacBook Pro.\n\nWhen it's all set up, will I just be able to sit at the desk, turn on the laptop, plug in mini Display Port cable to the Thunderbolt output, close the lid on the laptop and start typing away?\n\nYes. There's a small delay as the keyboard and mouse pair with the BlueTooth on the MacBook pro but it's usually less than 30 seconds.\n\nOr even worse, will I have to keep the laptop lid open?\n\nKeeping the lid open is not required but bear in mind that the MacBook Pro venting doesn't function well when the lid is closed. The cooling vents operate best when the lid is open. If you're running CPU-intensive applications you may find you need to operate with the lid open just to cool the computer adequately.\n\nI'm not sure if the monitor has built-in speakers, but if it does, will the computer's audio come out of the monitor's speakers through the Thunderbolt-to-HDMI cable?\n\nThat cable passes audio, so yes.\n", "Q: Dashboard Widget for persistently editing a file Is there a dashboard widget that one can use to persistently edit a text file?\nFor example, suppose I want to have my changelog open all the time in a Git repository.\nMany thanks.\n\nA: Dashboard widgets are simple HTML applets, built using HTML, CSS & Javascript. So if there is a way to create an HTML webpage that does this functionality (namely, auto-loading a text file in an editable field with an option to refresh and save), then this can also be accomplished within a Dashboard widget.\nIt may be worth asking some of the folks at StackOverflow if you need help learning the code to accomplish this (web coding is better suited to that community), and you can use tools like Dashcode or Hype (my recommendation) to actually create your widget.\n\nA: I looked at Apple's Dashboard developer documentation and it seems that widgets run in a sort of sandbox within their 'bundle', almost like iOS apps do. That would make it very difficult to implement a text editing widget. \nThere have been known vulnerabilities in the past, such as this one in OS X 10.4, that probably make it even more difficult now to circumvent the Dashboard 'sandbox'. \nI browsed the different OS X Dashboard widgets in Apple's widget directory and there doesn't seem to be any widgets that may do what you need. Here is the developer widgets section, for instance. \nThere may not be a widget that does exactly what you're looking for. If there is one, it would be a great thing to know about; as I also think that having a quick notepad of sorts in the Dashboard would be quite useful. Good luck on your search. \n", "Q: Creating a keyboard shortcut to pause Youtube video in a Google Chrome tab Here is what I want to do: hook up a keyboard shortcut with an action to play/pause the video that is currently open in a Google Chrome tab. Would it be possible on Mac OS X? \nI was thinking about keeping Youtube always in a particular tab (e.g. the first one) and creating Automator script with a keyboard shortcut. I know it would be possible by simulating user actions (switch to particular tab, simulate click, go back to last tab) but I'm looking for more smooth way.\n\nA: You could assign a shortcut to a script like this:\ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    repeat with t in tabs of windows\n        tell t\n            if URL starts with \"http://www.youtube.com\" then\n                execute javascript \"player = document.querySelectorAll('#watch7-player embed')[0]\nif (player) {\n    player.getPlayerState() == 1 ? player.pauseVideo() : player.playVideo()\n} else { // if youtube.com/html5 is enabled\n    document.querySelectorAll('.html5-player-chrome > button:first-child')[0].click()\n}\"\n                exit repeat\n            end if\n        end tell\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nFor Safari, replace execute javascript with do JavaScript.\n", "Q: Finder window resizes by itself Every time I restart the computer or just Finder app the Macintosh HD folder will be resized to the default size without remember my configuration.

In OS X 10.8.2 for example: \nsh-3.2$ hdiutil info\nframework       : 344\ndriver          : 10.7v344\n\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/DiskImages.framework\n\nA: Assuming you can attach the sparsebundle, you should be able to do this using fileXray, which is $79 for a personal use license and found at http://filexray.com\nfileXray is able to \"reverse map volume storage\" meaning it can \"determine which file a given block or byte offset on a volume belongs to.\" The relevant option is --who_owns_byte, explained on page 172 of the documentation, which can be found at http:// filexray.com / fileXray.pdf  (link broken because it won't let me post more than two links).\nNow according to page 54 of the documentation, \"It is important to note that a device dump must be 'raw'—that is, it must not require any additional transformations such as decompression or decryption. In other words, for a disk image file to be used directly by fileXray, the image must not be compressed, encrypted, or sparse. fileXray will reject such an image.\" However, it goes on to say, \"If you do have such an image that is compressed, encrypted, or sparse, either convert it using the Mac OS X hdiutil command-line program, or simply attach it (optionally without mounting it) using hdiutil and use fileXray on the resultant block device instead of the image file.\"\nSo once you have the sparsebundle attached or mounted, the question is what byte offset to provide to the --who_owns_byte option.\nApple provides \"routines to manipulate a sparse bundle\" at http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/hfs/hfs-191/CopyHFSMeta/SparseBundle.c\nBased on that code, we can see in the routine doSparseRead that the bandName of the first band for a given offset is the bandNum as a hexadecimal number. In particular, asprintf(&bandName, \"%s/bands/%x\", ctx->pathname, bandNum).\nThe bandNum is the offset / blockSize, since off_t bandNum = (offset + nread) / blockSize and nread starts at 0, which will truncate the result of the division, so the offset should be bandNum * blockSize or bandNum * blockSize + blockSize. Note that the blockSize is the bandSize, since off_t blockSize = ctx->bandSize;\nLooking at doSparseWrite seems to give the same answer, since off_t bandNum = (offset + written) / blockSize; with written initialized at 0 and asprintf(&bandName, \"%s/bands/%x\", ctx->pathname, bandNum);\nIt would be great if someone with access to fileXray could try this.\n", "Q: How can I remap the right mouse button to the left mouse button?

Since she is so little I thought it would be nice to just remap them until she gets older. Is this possible?\nComputer: 13\" 2010 Macbook Pro with OSX 10.8\n\nA: What mouse? Apple's Mighty Mouse is configurable as a one-button mouse. For other mice, look at the USB Overdrive mouse driver. It's an amazingly configurable driver for mice, trackpads, joy sticks, game controllers, and other HIDs. I used it with a Kensington multi-button trackball before I had the OEM driver for it.

In Font Book, validate your fonts (it's under the File menu).\n3.

It's the de facto standard X11 for OS X. It comes with luit and all the normal X11 stuff. \nHomebrew does not have an X11 installer; it expects you tu use XQuartz, and will compile against it when it is present.\nYou could also use AppleScript to programmatically change your Terminal settings instead of doing it manually.\n\nA: I have luit on my Mac.

For those who might not be familiar with it, OS X gives us an option to output audio to more than one device through the Audio MIDI Setup utility. As a matter of fact, two options; creating an aggregate device or a multi-output device. What's the different between them? \nI have a mid-2011 Mac Mini, connected to a Dell LCD via (MiniDP - DVI) and a Samsung TV via HDMI (which in turn is connected to an older A/V receiver via toslink). The Mac Mini is also connected to a 2.1 desktop speaker system. Given this setup I managed to get the audio to work, first by creating a multi-output device, then I realised that most guides mention using an aggregate device, which I am not sure I understand what it really is. Is there really a difference, if so what's the right way to achieve audio output through multiple devices? \n\nA: A multi-output device allows you to mirror audio output to multiple devices at the same time.\nAn aggregate device allows you to tie multiple devices together to appear as one, single, device with more I/O than any one single device has.\nAggregation has a lot of applications in music production where you might want to use more than one audio capture device at the same time from Logic Audio or GarageBand. To do this, you aggregate devices in to one new, virtual device and access the single device from within Logic.\nSome examples might help illustrate the difference.\nExample 1: Multi-Output Device\nLet's say I wanted to play music in iTunes and have the audio go to my iMac's built-in speakers and my AppleTV via AirPlay at the same time. How would I do this? I would create a new, multi-output device. Assign both my Built-In Output and AirPlay sources to this device and then select it as my output device for audio on my iMac.\nNow audio played in iTunes goes to both my iMac's speakers and my AppleTV at the same time -- it's mirrored.\nExample 1: Aggregate Device\nLet's say I wanted to record 4 streams of mono audio at the same time but all I have are two audio input devices that each have 2 mono streams on them (they're basically stereo capture devices). I could create an aggregate device out of the two devices (assuming their drivers support aggregation in OS X) and use this new, aggregate device in GarageBand or Logic and now, instead of seeing 2 channels of input, I'd see 4 channels of input and the devices would function as one, bigger \"virtual device\".\nIt works in a similar fashion for their outputs. They all act as independent outputs on one virtual device.\n", "Q: App Store Blank and Gray I have an iPhone 3G with iOS 4.1, but don't have an Apple ID. I just got this used phone recently.

Now I read many forum posts complaining on 5GB lost here, 10 there. But this is like half the SSD drive. Could it be that its going bad and half of it was marked off limits or something.\nWhen I boot the machine to MacOS, it shows a similar state.\nWhen I look at the Admin tools > System management > Storage > Disk Management screen in Windows, it shows a 45GB \"Unallocated space\" partition, which is invisible under MacOS. I guess this is the missing space. Can I format it and use it under Windows? can MacOS or BootCamp be using half the SSD drive for its housekeeping usage?\nBootcamp 3.2, OSX 10.6.7\nInterestingly, the Mac OS partition utility also shows a 45GB area unused between the partition, which it lets me use to expand the Mac HD partition. (I didn't do it yet, only on the interface then cancelled). But its very strange - this Mac Air started as an MacOS only device; presumably (I don't remember ever checking it then) the Mac HD partition originally used all of the SSD space, as factory configured by Apple. I then installed Bootcamp. Could Bootcamp have thrown away half the hard drive space in to an unused partition, and for what purpose would it have done that?\nI would like now to format this partition to be used by Bootcamp (i.e. Windows) not the Mac OS.

A new MacBook came with something called AirDrop and worked between many MacBooks such as MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. Can I also use AirDrop to exchange data between Macs and iOS devices?\n\nA: You cannot use AirDrop with iOS devices. It is a feature that is exclusive to supported Macs (and unsupported Macs through a hack, as you've pointed out).\nIf you are interested in sharing files with your iOS devices, I recommend a solution such as SugarSync or DropBox, or a Wi-Fi tool such as Instashare.\nApple intends for you and developers to use iCloud to get documents from PC to iOS, but it's not widespread yet and perhaps ever.\n\nA: Looks like iOS 7 is going to have AirDrop as the new UI has an icon for AirDrop right next to the icon for AirPlay.\n\nA: It has been announced that starting with OS X 10.10, Airdrop will interoperate between OS X and iOS.\n\nA: Just update after IOS7 release.    Looks like the link between airdrop from supported IOS7 devices to supported OSX Mountain Lion is not working.   Probably something that should/will be completed with release Mavericks.\n\nA: The best choice to share with macs, Windows, Linux, NAS servers, FTP, Dropbox, Google Drive,Time Capsule, etc is Quick Explorer.\nI used instashare before and its similiar to airdrop but it works only with pictures (not bad, but not enough ) If you want to share andy file, mp3, wav, video, doc, pdf, and otherwise file formats Quick Explorer is the best choice. I've found that it's the best tool for this purpose as it handles different file types and platforms.\n", "Q: unable to boot my MacBook after FileVault 2 activation after activation of FileVault 2 I am unable to boot my computer, the apple sign turns into a prohibitory sign with a spinning circle beneath it , that spins forever.

It should give you a full 1AH with the power connectors from both USB ports, assuming your hub can output more than 500mah total.\n\nA: I know it's been a while since this question has been asked originally but I'm still seeing this question come up, and it's been my searching for an answer to a question like this which brought me here.\nUSB Y-cables violate the USB specifications and so only work to provide more power to devices that also violated the USB specifications.  It should only be a surprise to those that know little about how USB works when or if these USB Y-cables fail to provide more power to an attached device than when connected to a host without the Y-cable.  There are ways to make a kind of USB Y-cable to provide more power to a device when attached to a USB host that does not provide sufficient power, and do so without violating the USB specifications.  Answering that though is out of scope for this question since that applies to phones and tablets that do not have Lightning ports.\nI'll see many complaints on how Apple does things that are \"non-standard\" but from reading the USB specifications Apple actually complies with the USB specifications very well.  Their idea on how their USB-A power bricks handshakes with their iDevices might not be the same way other manufacturers do their handshaking but it does not appear to violate the USB specifications.  The original post mentions getting 900 mA from a USB 3.x port and 500 mA from a USB 2.0 port but these are not maximums, these are minimums.  A host computer must supply at least 900 mA from a USB 3.x port and 500 mA from a USB 2.0 port to be considered in compliance with the USB specifications.  USB ports on Apple computers will supply more than this, and it appears various computers from other manufacturers will as well.\nUSB 2.0 and USB 3.x allow for devices to negotiate for up to 1.5 amps before having to resort to USB-PD or USB-BC to negotiate for more.  As best I can tell Apple computers and iDevices use USB-PD to negotiate for up to 12 watts, or 2.4 amps, of power to the iDevice.  Without support for USB-PD, or whatever it is that Apple is using, the rate of charge will be limited to 2.5 watts (500 mA), 4.5 watts (900 mA), or 7.5 watts (1.5 A).  The USB spec allows up to 2.4 amps to peripherals connected to hosts by USB-A and Apple computers will happily supply this.  Or at least those built after the USB-BC and USB 2.0 specs were published.\nIf you need power to your iDevice while connected to some peripheral device then the use of a number of Lightning dongles will allow this.  Apple builds a variety of such dongles, as do manufacturers that Apple partnered with.  These dongles will have a Lightning port for up to 12 watts of power and a port for the peripheral.  Examples for such ports include HDMI, USB 3.x, Ethernet, and 1/8\" audio for headphones and headsets.\nConnecting an Apple iDevice with a Lightning port to a computer that does not provide 12 watts does present a problem if the users wants both data transfer and 12 watts to the iDevice.  As far as I can tell there is no Lightning dongle that will split out the power and data so that someone can plug in a 12 watt power brick to power an iDevice while it is also still able to maintain a USB connection to a computer.\nSometimes the problem isn't that the computer is incapable of providing the power Apple iDevices and their users want, it's that the computer and iDevice are not speaking the same language on negotiating the power transfer.\nFrom what I have seen from my research so far a USB dock or hub is not likely to enable a computer to provide more power to an Apple iDevice.  The dock or hub might be getting power from somewhere other than the host computer but it is still the host computer that is managing the power transfer.  The computer must still speak the same language as the iDevice to negotiate more than 7.5 watts of power.  A USB hub or dock might be able to provide 2.4 amps to connected devices but an iDevice will not draw more power than it has been granted permission to draw.\nWhat might allow a connection to a host computer and provide 12 watts to an iDevice is a Thunderbolt dock.  A USB-C to Lightning cable plugged into a USB-C port on a Thunderbolt dock may allow data transfer to a Thunderbolt host while providing 12 watts of power.  Thunderbolt docks have an independent USB-PD controller, like that in a USB-PD power brick, that does not rely on the host to manage power delivery.  The USB-C Thunderbolt ports on such docks will still support the USB 2.0 protocol that will be required to create the connection between the host and the iDevice.\nI will emphasize that use of a Thunderbolt dock for getting 12 watts of power while maintaining a data connection to an Apple iPhone or iPad is speculation.  It's an educated guess but still a guess.  I haven't tested this theory and I don't (yet) have the hardware to test this theory.  I wrote this lengthy answer mostly to clarify what I'm seeing as misinterpretations of the USB specs.  While this is an older question it is still relevant today and variations on this still come up.\n", "Q: Why does iTunes continually ask me to authorize my computer? I just recently bought an album on iTunes and I have a weird problem. All of the songs (18 in all) except for one, play perfectly fine. When I try to play it, it says \"This computer is not authorized to play \"\". Would you like to authorize it?\" It prompts me to sign in with my Apple ID, which I did. Then it says \"This computer is already authorized.\" I have no clue how to fix this! I've tried the steps outlined in iTunes: Missing folder or incorrect permissions may prevent authorization and iTunes repeatedly prompts to authorize computer to play iTunes Store purchases, but neither of them work. Any suggestions?\n\nA: In the end, deleting all the offending track and re-downloading it was the only thing that worked. Why I didn't think about this at first, I don't know, but it worked!\n\nA: JUST found the solution to my nearly year long battle with iTunes and the: You are not authorized. You're already authorized issue. Just adding this to spread the word that Ctrl +b -> Edit -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Reset Cache \nworked for me. \nEvery time iTunes started it thought it was freshly installed and prompted me to go through the tour, set the default music player, and authorize (each time saying it was already authorized). It wasn't just one song, it was about 50% of my music and 100% of my movies. I had already tried- deauthorizing then authorizing, uninstalling, reinstalling, deleting that SC- folder and restarting -- nothing worked until I cleared the cache.\n\nA: Here's what worked for me:\n1) Right click the album or song. The first option that appears is \"Remove Download\"\n2) Click \"Remove Download\" and blue cloud icons should appear next to the song or \n   songs.\n3) Click the icon to download the song. The cloud icon should disappear after the song is \n   downloaded.\n4) Click on the song to make sure it plays. If there are more songs with the issue, \n   repeat this process.\n\nA: What worked for me was in iTunes, top right corner on  click on down arrow, and then Account info, then manage devices in iCloud.  This was very different from the authorised computers under STORE in itunes.  Once I deauthorised all, I could then authorise my computer.  Big thumbs up to Apple support for that solution, will try to get them to update their support pages with that fix.\n\nA: Maybe you could try uninstall the iTunes and then download and install the latest version,  authorize again. \n\nA: I would recommend deauthorizing all your computers from iTunes. Go to the iTunes Store, and look for the Account link under Quick Links on the home page. Under Apple ID Summary, look for Computer Authorizations, then click on Deauthorize All. You'll need to reauthorize all the computers that use your account; though you may just have the one. \n\nA: The \"deauthorize all\" option will only show up if you have more than one computer authorized on your account. If you have only one computer authorized it can be deauthorized right from the \"Store\" menu. I had the exact same problem - what worked for me was to make sure the \"iCloud download\" column was checked and visible (right click in area where artist, name etc labels are and scroll down to click on \"iCloud download\"), a small icon with a cloud and an arrow were shown beside my song and clicking on that downloaded it from the cloud. I can play it now. I'm not sure why the file went to the cloud at all when I downloaded it - my computer is not connected in any way but I will have to further investigate that. I hope this helps!\n\nA: Had same issue, had just downloaded an album but three of the tracks would not play, giving this 'authorise' error. As suggested deleted them, but to re-download them went to Account (top of screen), Purchased, and listed purchased tracks. A cloud symbol was next to those I had deleted, clicked this to re-download them, and they played normally.\n\nA: De-authorize  your computer and then re-authorize it, cured the authorization causality loop.\n", "Q: Embedding Web Snippets in Wiki Server and Security Settings I want to edit the embed security settings in Mountain Lion Server's Wiki Service because with the default settings you can't embed anything on pages, which makes it a lot less useful. We're in a school environment where embedding flash apps, video etc. is the norm - and Wiki Server will normally strip out these tags from web snippets for security reasons. \n\nI seems that to do this you change:\n/Library/Server/Wiki/Config/whitelist.plist \n\nbut I'm not sure how to change it to allow all types of embeds. I'm aware of the security risks but I trust my users on this Server to embed what they need to embed.\n\nA: I found the Lion Server Advanced Admin Guide which mentioned changing the key  FiltersEnabled to False /etc/collabd/collabd.plist. \nOnce I figured that this plist has been moved to /Library/Server/Wiki/Config in Mountain Lion Server from /etc/collabd/ in Lion Server I changed the preference - and we can embed to our hearts' content. \n", "Q: Can I remotely access my Mac from Linux using screen sharing?

I still need to be able to view, and add to, my work calendar though, so can't disable the whole thing.\nUPDATE: The reason that I want to do this is because if I get a 'work' alert then I will either:\n\n\n*\n\n*be in my office and using Outlook for such things, or \n\n*be on holiday/at home and not wanting to see work notifications. \n\n\nThe calendar needs to remain enabled because I constantly use it on my phone to plan free time (around work commitments) and also to enter out-of-office entries (e.g. dental appointments). \n\nA: You cannot silence the alerts of a single calendar in iOS. Alerts utilize Notification Center, and the Calendar options in Notification Center apply to all calendars. I know this is not the answer you are hoping for.\nThe best option, as mentioned in the comments above, is to disable the calendar on your work account, when not desired, and re-enable it again when you need it. To do this, go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Your Work Mail Account. Slide off Calendars. This isn't a good option, admittedly, as you will have to re-download your calendars every time it's slid back on.\nAnother option is to keep calendars turned off for this account, and use Exchange Outlook Web Access to access your calendars. This may be even a worse interface, however, as the OWA interface is not mobile-optimized.\nMy last suggestion is to use a third-party app to manage one of your calendars and the built-in Calendar app to manage the other. You can then disable Notifications on one of the two apps. You have to look potentially in two places for your calendar entries, but you will potentially get the granular control you need. Here are some calendar apps to examine: Calvetica, MiCal.\n\nA: Yes, in iOS 8:\n\nTo do this, simply go into the Calendar app, tap the “Calendars” button in the bottom center to bring up your list of Calendars, and then tap the red “i” to the left of the calendar you’d like to change. Scrolling all the way to the bottom will reveal an “Event Alerts” option — simply toggle this OFF to prevent alarms in that calendar from showing up on the current device.\n\n\nA: You can go to the following URL to define which calendars sync with your mobile device. \nhttps://www.google.com/calendar/syncselect\nThat is still a load of messing around each time though. \n\nA: You could use a 3rd party calendar app just for their notification functions as a bodgy workaround.\nI recommend Calvetiva, Agenda, or Tempus.\nThe workflow would go something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose a secondary calendar app.\n\n*Configure you secondary calendar app\nto only use the calendars you want alerts for (steps vary on choice\nof app). Some (like Calvetica) are clever, and extend the alerts\nfunction by allowing a snooze option etc.\n\n*Configure secondary\ncalendar alerts and notifications via the normal settings>\nnotifications app to show as you want them. They will only trigger\nfor the active calendars in the app.\n\n*Configure your normal calendar\nalerts to be off. Remove from Notification Centre, set alert style to\nnone, and also go onto Sounds > alerts and set the calendar alert to\nnone.\n\n\nNow your existing calendar app will still have access to all calendars but won't alert, the secondary app will do alerting only for the active ones.\nDownsides: You will need to periodically open and then shut the secondary calendar every so often in order for it to read the current alerts from the calendar data store and create it's own local notifications from them.\nI hoped you could get round this by following the above steps but using the built in calendar as your selective alerting calendar (as it is always running and won't need to be opened to update), and using a replacement calendar app with all calendars shown but no alerts - sadly the normal Calendar app includes all calendars regardless of if you have turned a calendar off or not.\n", "Q: Outlook in VM not responding - want to bring window to front All,\nEvery once in awhile, when I click on a window in MS' Outlook 2010 to bring it to the front, it doesn't respond.

My son and wife both have iPod Touches and I have an iPhone. We all used the same Apple ID and turned on iMessage. Both my son and wife were getting texts from my friends and my work on their iPods, I think because my cell phone number was linked to the Apple ID.  If I just turn off iMessage on my iPhone, will that solve the issue?\n\nA: Set up new AppleIDs for your wife and son. This has several advantages: If they use a different computer than you, they can manage different iTunes playlists, different sets of address book contacts, etc without affecting your personal settings or preferences. They will each also be able to sync their own photos and documents and set up their own mail account through iCloud.\nIn Settings, sign in to your AppleID on each device for iTunes Store and to their personal AppleIDs for iCloud. This will mean that app and music purchases you make on the account will still be available on all devices, but that your son and wife will each have their own iMessage account. They will no longer receive your texts, but they will be able to send and receive iMessage texts for free over WiFi.\nYou can also share photos this way; photo streams can be shared between AppleIDs. If they are using your ID, any photos they take will end up on your device too. With their own IDs, this will not happen unless you specifically set it up to do so.\nIf you all sync to different computers iTunes Home Sharing can be used to keep purchased content in sync. Just authorize each computer using your AppleID.\nOne caveat: Make sure that neither your wife or son use their own AppleID for purchases, or only they will be able to see the app. There is a way to set up an AppleID without entering a credit card number; especially for a younger son, this is a really good idea.\n\nA: To directly answer your question, disabling iMessage on your iPhone will have no effect in fixing the reception of iMessages not intended for them.\nLike other answers mentioned, the best way is to set two new Apple IDs - one for your wife, and one for your son, and then sign into only Messages (Settings -> Messages) with that account. If you would like further autonomy you can sign into iCloud and Facetime with the new Apple IDs. \n\nA: No. Have your son and wife use a different email address for Messages than for Music & Apps. You configure the EMail addresses for Messages in the \"Settings\" app under \"Messages\".\nThe Music, Apps, & iBooks Apple ID is set in the \"iTunes & App Stores\"  a few lines down from \"Messages\" in the \"Settings\" app.\n\nA: There is also now in iOS8 - Family Sharing - one credit card, multiple iCloud accounts & Parental Control.\nFamily Sharing. \nA new way to bring harmony to your family’s digital life.\n", "Q: How to install framework (from pkg file) in a non-standard location?

That's why I want to keep this installation as clear as possible away from the \"standard\" places for them.\nAmong the problems I am trying to avoid by doing this is the buggy Tk framework that comes with the latest versions of OS X.\nTherefore, a key sub-goal here is to install new Tcl and Tk frameworks, separate from the system-supplied ones.  The ones I want to install come from ActiveState (\"Mac OS X (10.5+, x86_64/x86)\"), in the form of a *.pkg file.\nWhen I click on this file, I get presented with the usual \"wizard\"-like sequence of steps (\"Introduction\", \"License\", etc.).  At no point during this sequence I am offered the opportunity to choose a different installation location for these frameworks before I reach the choice of clicking on the INSTALL button.1\nI suspect that if I click on this button, the installed files will go under /Library/Frameworks (or possibly under /System/Library/Frameworks), which is what I'm trying to avoid.  (Indeed, when I click on INSTALL, I'm immediately presented with an password-entry dialog, which is a pretty good indication that the installation will put files somewhere under /Library or /System.)\nTherefore I'm looking for an alternative way to perform this installation that will allow me to explicitly set the destination folder for the installed files.\n1Yes, the installer allows me choose a different volume for the installation, but it does not let me specify, e.g., $HOME/Library/Frameworks as the destination for the installed files.\n\nA: You can safely install Python under /Library/Frameworks and not worry about it interfering with the \"system\" Python, although with a few symlinks and/or $PATH changes you can make it the default if you want.\nAs an alternative, you can install MacPorts and set its install root to whatever you want (the default is /opt/local, I believe, although this is configurable during setup), although the Python framework will still be installed under a Library/Frameworks subdirectory. I prefer the MacPorts distribution over the python.org one because there are many additional modules you can install which are pre-configured to build correctly, which isn't always the case when you use pip or easy_install, depending on what you're trying to build. MacPorts also has a pretty decent versioning system, allowing multiple versions to coexist side-by-side, with simple tools to switch between them. As an added bonus, the MacPorts Tcl is not \"broken,\" so everything should work out of the box. YMMV :)\n\nA: Generally speaking, you can only relocate a package (that is, install it into a different directory) that has been built with relocation in mind.\nIf the package supports it, it can be relocated with the command line equivalent of Installer.app, conveniently called installer, with option -target (from man installer):\n\nThe target volume is specified with the -target parameter (-tgt is\n  accepted as a synonym).\n\nThe argument to -target is:\n\n\n*\n\n*A volume mount point (/Volumes/HDD), device node (/dev/disk0s5) or volume UUID (376C4046-083E-334F-AF08-62FAFBC4E352), for example:\ninstaller -pkg InstallMe.pkg -target / \n\n\n*Any of the values returned by -dominfo (LocalSystem or CurrentUserHomeDirectory), for example:\ninstaller -pkg InstallMe.pkg -target CurrentUserHomeDirectory\n\n(As you see, the latter command looks very promising. It would install InstallMe.pkg in the hierarchy of the home directory of the current user.)\nIn our specific case, unfortunately, ActiveState's Tcl package wasn't designed to be relocated:\n\n\n*\n\n*It doesn't return any information for -dominfo:\n$ installer -verbose -dominfo -pkg ActiveTcl-8.6.pkg\nDomain information:\nNoDomainsAvailable\n\n\n*Although the pkg file can be successfully installed on another volume:\n$ sudo installer -verbose -pkg ActiveTcl-8.6.pkg -target /Volumes/DISK2GO/\ninstaller: Package name is ActiveState ActiveTcl 8.6.0.0.296563\ninstaller: Installing at base path /Volumes/DISK2GO\n(...)   \n#\ninstaller: Writing files….....\n(...)\ninstaller: The software was successfully installed......\ninstaller: The install was successful.\n#\n\nas can be seen here:\n\nit doesn't work:\n$ cd /Volumes/DISK2GO/usr/local/bin/\n$ ./tclsh8.6\ndyld: Library not loaded:\n/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/Versions/8.6/Tcl\n  Referenced from: /Volumes/DISK2GO/usr/local/bin/./tclsh8.6\n  Reason: image not found\nTrace/BPT trap: 5\n$  ./tclselect \n-bash: ./tclselect: /usr/local/bin/tclsh: bad interpreter: No such file or directory\n\nThe reason is that scripts and compiled tools use and are linked to /Library/Frameworks:\n$ cd /Volumes/DISK2GO/usr/local/bin/\n$ otool -L tclsh8.6 \n tclsh8.6:\n /Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/Versions/8.6/Tcl (compatibility version 8.6.0, current version 8.6.0)\n(...)\n$ grep Library tclselect \n#  /Library/Frameworks\n# installation. I.e. a Tcl installed in '/Library/Frameworks' and\nreturn /Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/Versions\n\nIf you wish to use ActiveState's Tcl you must install the package in its default location. \nAnd as far as I can tell, it won't conflict with the installed Tcl framework:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X own framework is installed in /System/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/, some binaries in /usr/bin.\n\n*ActiveState's Tcl installs in /Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework, /Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework, /Library/Tcl and /usr/local/bin (for a full listing, double click the pkg file and select File>ShowFiles).\n", "Q: Locking down iOS devices I have around 200 iOS devices that I have to keep track of in an internal network (they never leave the network) and there are several things I need to do on them.\n\n\n*\n\n*Completely disable certain apps/features in iOS (like iCloud and Maps)\n\n*Be able to send push notifications by device (make something appear on the screen/make a noise)\n\n*Install internal apps over the air\n\n\nI am currently using OSX Server's Profile Manager, but I cannot lock down the devices enough with profiles, it also doesn't have the ability to \"ping\" them. It seems like there is a way to install internal apps over the air but I have not tried it yet.\nIdeally my solution would be using free/open source software.\nAny suggestions would be great.\n(all devices are running iOS 6.1.2 as of writing this post)\n\nA: You cannot disable Apple Maps. iOS does not provide a method to do this.\nThe best free MDM tool I know of is Meraki (aside from Profile Manager itself). However, I'm not 100% convinced it will do everything you need. Also Meraki was recently purchased by Cisco and I am a bit concerned about its future. You will also receive sales calls from their staff trying to sell you on additional features.\nTo accomplish your objectives on the cheap, I recommend looking at AirWatch. We use this in our enterprise to manage several hundred iOS devices and it works quite well. There are other tools that can do this as well. A great full-featured guide to MDM differences is EnterpriseiOS.com.\n\nA: Profile Manager is Apple's own Mobile Device Management solution. The best solution for your problem is MDM plus device supervision. By putting an iOS device in supervised mode, you can disable many apps that could not be disabled in normal cases. I would recommend Hexnode MDM, because it is a simple and efficient solution for device management. Everything that you need to do like pushing notifications, installing apps over the air, locking devices remotely and much more can be done in a very few clicks than it takes in other MDMs.\n", "Q: An ipad app or setting that helps turn off wifi or turn on airplane mode on schedule? i hope to conserve battery at night. is there an ipad app or setting that helps turn off wifi or turn on airplane mode at certain time? or would it even be better to have an app that turns off the device completely on schedule?\n\nA: No. Not unless you jailbreak your device.\nThere is obviously Do-Not-Disturb which disables alerts, but does not put the phone on Airplane mode or disable wifi.\nKeep in mind that if you turn off wifi, or enable Airplane mode, that iCloud backups or iTunes backups won't work at that point. \nSo, in order to conserve battery overnight, you will need to manually enable Airplane mode, disable wifi, or, you could power the device off completely. Again, keep in mind, iCloud backups will not perform during this time.\n", "Q: Switch between sound profiles iPhone? I have found no way that iPhone is able to do what I need here.

I don't want to use display mirroring, I just want the menu to be mirrored on both screens.\nI'm using 10.6, but if this is a reason to upgrade to 10.8 I will. I want this so bad:)\n\nA: Mac OS X does not allow for this natively. However, there is a third-party tool called SecondBar that purports to do just this. I have not used this myself, but you might want to take a look.\n\nA: I've used Secondbar for years and recommend it.  I'm currently using it with 10.8 but have used it with 10.7 and 10.6.  The only downside IMO is that it only mirrors the application menus and system time.  It will not show system icons such as WiFi, Bluetooth, Time Machine, etc.\nYou can also rearrange and resize windows quickly by right clicking on the red/yellow/green buttons (X - +) of any window.  This is useful when connecting a laptop to a display and the OS not remembering where you previously had windows.  I have some AppleScripts that automate this as well if you're interested.\n", "Q: Edit System Dictionary on Mac OS 10.8 So, I think I've found a misspelled word in the Mac OS 10.8 dictionary.  This is not a word that I've added.  I double checked in \\Library\\Spelling and don't have it added to any user dictionaries.  When I look up the word the dictionary even states it is a common misspelling.\nThe word in question is \"espresso\" but if I type \"expresso\" it's not underlined in red.\nIs there anyway to edit the system dictionary?  Or is this something I should submit to Apple as a bug?\n*If I double click to select the word and then right click, I don't have the \"Unlearn Spelling\" option.\n\nA: Warning: be careful about editing the system dictionary as it is easy to get an unusable dictionary. You also run the risk of having the updated dictionary over-written by subsequent OSX updates.\nTo edit the system level dictionaries, there is a helpful Q&A that tells you where to find the dictionaries: superuser.\nIn summary:\n\n~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary\nThe System-wide equivalent, which is empty on my Mac, would be here:\n/Library/Spelling/\nAside from this, you will find packaged dictionaries here:\n/Library/Dictionaries/\n~/Library/Dictionaries/\n\nIf it were me, I would just add the word to my personal dictionary. Although your question was how to edit the system dictionary, I note that on my system (10.8.2 Australian English) both your words are accepted.\nBut Microsoft Word 2011 (with Australian English) puts red lines under expresso and is happy with espresso.\nIt appears your example may be one of those where there is different usage in different parts of the world and in different software packages.\n", "Q: Spilled vinegar on iPhone earpiece I spilled a drop of balsamic vinegar on my iPhone 4S near the earpiece.\nNow, call volume on the internal speaker is very low. How can I clean the earpiece out?\n\nA: You will have to open your iPhone, e.g. as described on iFixit. Then you can clean the affected area with a very gentle cleaning solution (but be aware to not use any solutions that may harm your hardware).\nAnd for the next time: Don't place your cell phone near your salad. Balsamic vinegar is an aggresive solution which may severly damage pieces of your iPhone.\n", "Q: Exporting jpg to pdf: file size grows significantly When I used Preview's \"Export\" feature to export a 1.4MB jpg file to a one page pdf file, the resulting pdf is as large as 14MB, which is really surprising and annoying. I tried to reduce the file size, for instance by \"reduce file size\" quartz filter, but the pdf became so reduced (56KB) that the result was not readable at all.\nIs there anyway to remedy this? A built-in solution is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: PDF supports JPEG encoding, so the size should not increase very much at all. It should be able to wrap some header info around the jpeg stream and call it a day.\nUnfortunately, Preview is very good at viewing PDFs, but when writing PDFs tends to use a subset of PDF that is easy for it to parse, but not space-efficient. \nI'm sorry to say this, but you will need to look for a different program that can leave the JPEG alone and shove it in the stream.  Acrobat can do this, as can pdftex or convert from ImageMagick. There are probably others. \n\nA: \"Save as PDF...\" from Preview's printing menu does the trick. \nThe export function blew my original JPG file (293 KB) up to incredible 2.7 MB. With the PDF printer, it only takes 295 KB. Just 2 KB more for that header info Alan talked about. :) \n", "Q: Apple Mail 6.2 doesn't download messages from Gmail over POP3 I'm trying to set up my POP3 Gmail account on a Retina MBP running OS X 10.8.2. A few months ago, I managed to do the same thing, the first time around, on an iMac, working with the same Gmail account and under an earlier Mountain Lion release.\nThis time, Mail gives me no errors, and despite having followed Google's guidelines on how to set up POP3 email on Apple Mail, no messages will download on the MBP, even after checking for new mail, and right-clicking the account to force download. Has anyone encountered this issue, and found a fix?\n\nA: Review your settings on the Gmail website; could you have perhaps overlooked the checkbox to Download all messages from today on (or whatever your preference is)?  \nBy the way, I have my Mail.app accounts all set to POP3, and iDevices, of course, are on IMAP ... so that works; on the GMail page, you can leave them both on.\nCheck your Mail.app account preferences: in Advanced, the port needs to be set to 995. And have you run Mail's Connection Doctor, under the Window menu? When it can't connect, clicking on the error will take you right to the place in Mail preferences where the error is.\n\nA: Whoa. Is that mail on your machine--Probably. Is your ~/Library folder visible? Look in ~/Library/Mail.V2. It should contain folders named Mailbox, MaiData, and one for each of your email addresses, whether POP or IMAP. \nFINDING your mail: Okay, here's the odd part, but it could be the problem. I use POP3 GMail, and the account folders read as follows: \nPOP-xxx@gmail.com@pop.gmail.com. \nThey created themselves, and when I fooled with their naming, the gorilla wasn't happy. Leaving them be, everything works fine.\nIMPORTING your own mail: Whether or not you have these oddly named folders, if you find--open V2 in list view and calculate all sizes--that there's 17 (MB?) of mail in there, the quickest way to get up and running is to select Import Mailboxes, navigate to within the account folder to choose one mailbox at a time, and once imported, use Select All and Move the messages to the right Mailbox in the sidebar.\nQuit Mail, open it again, and see if your mail doesn't show up.\n\nA: The solution turned out to be, removing the mail account, disabling IMAP in Gmail's settings, restarting my machine, and adding the account again.\n"]
