["Q: Font viewer for font collectors? I have a huge font collection and would like to be able to view them\nin an efficient manner rather than opening a file one by one.\nWhat would be the best font viewer aside from fontypython, which unfortunately\nhas a Mojibake bug on fonts with multibyte characters.\n\nA: Web browsers are good at this. Sample script whose output can be saved as a simple HTML page and viewed in a local browser:\n#! /usr/bin/env bash\n\ncat << __HEADER\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\n    <title>Sample of local fonts matching '$1'</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n__HEADER\n\nfc-list --format='%{family}\\n' $1 | sort -u | while IFS='' read -r fontfamily\ndo\n    cat << __BODY\n    <hr/>\n    <div style=\"font-family: '${fontfamily}', 'serif'\">\n        <h1>${fontfamily}</h1>\n        <p>\n            The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy brown dog<br/>\n            0123456789,.:;?/<>'\"[]{}|\\-=\\`~!@#$%^&*()-=\\\\\n        </p>\n    </div>\n__BODY\n\ndone\n\ncat << __FOOTER\n    <hr/>\n</body>\n</html>\n__FOOTER\n\nThe script takes an optional first argument, the fc-list pattern to filter on. For example passing :spacing=100 as the argument generates an HTML page of all installed monospace fonts, or pass nothing and see all fonts.\n\nA: There's always Fontmatrix (Github). It has a slightly different feature-set to fontypython but I like it.\nTo install it from the repos, run:\n sudo apt install fontmatrix\n\n\n\nA: I use Font Manager\nsudo apt-get install font-manager\n\n\n\nA: Your should also give a try to gnome-specimen (also available in Debian)\n\nA: I use character maps heavily and decided to make one which you access from anywhere using a web interface and requires no installation.\nFeatures\n\n*\n\n*Select your own font file\n\n*Provides font and character information\n\n*Character copy-able\n\n*Supports TTF/OTF\n\n*Supports Icon fonts\n\n*Smooth interface\n\n*No installation necessary\n\n*No server upload necessary\n\nScreenshot\n\n\nA: Regular Ubuntu (and variants) repositories include (at least with current LTS release 20.04) programs font-viewer and gnome-font-viewers.\nBoth can be installed using regular package tools, including apt install as root, and called from your file manager through usual mechanisms, to preview font files from any directory.\nThey can also be called from command-line:\n/usr/libexec/font-manager/font-viewer /path/to/font/file.ttf\n\ngnome-font-viewer /path/to/font/file.ttf\n\nIncidentally, I happen to have encountered some fonts (partial encoding of a subset of a character set, extracted from a PDF file) that display well in font-viewer and show all characters substituted in gnome-font-viewer (and same for the PDF file in most PDF viewers).\n\nA: Only simple adding to nharward script ⇑, to generate final html page.

To confirm further, you can just double click a font and see a quick overview. This is great if you want to quickly weed out various odd-char fonts for example. \nScreenshot: showing 1) the output of the directory view, 2) the button to click to change to the right view, 3) An example of a clicked font\nScreenshot\n\nA: I know that the question is very stale, but one option is using YAD, a dialog maker. You can install it by:\nsudo apt install yad\n\nAnd then use yad --font to show the fonts. It works because YAD has a font selector dialog.\n", "Q: Sound Volume after boot always at loudest level I installed 10.04 a couple of weeks ago. My primary OS is Windows and i could not install Linux up until very recently because of lack of hardware support for my notebook. \n10.04 is the only distribution that i managed to get to install on my notebook, but my problem is, that even though i set the volume at a low level, every time after booting and login into Ubuntu, the sounds will play at the highest volume. The volume indicator will still show the low volume setting, but sounds play at the highest volume until i click the volume setting again manually\nIs there a config-file i need to update to fix this, or is it a known bug?\nAnybody had the same problem?\n\nA: Please try this approach - it might help.\n\nA: I think this issue is related to a known bug, that is already in proggress: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pulseaudio/+bug/206315\n", "Q: Mass re-tagging of music files My collection of music files has grown organically over the years, and\nit has no consistent tags nor file names.  Especially, older files may\nhave weird ID3v1 tags or no tags at all, which makes them inconvenient\nto use with tag-based browsers (like the \"Music catalog\" display of\nRhythmbox).  Can you suggest any good program for mass re-tagging of\nthe files?\nIdeally, I would like the following features in a re-tagging program:\n\n\n*\n\n*It lets me choose an arbitrary set of files and re-tag them all,\nupdating tag values selectively (e.g., only update \"Artist\")\n\n*It can populate tag values from the filename or the containing folder name (e.g., for files organized like <album>/<track no.> - <song name>)\n\n*It can detect whether there are inconsistencies between ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags (e.g., the song title is different in the two versions)\n\n*It lets me search for songs on CDDB or MusicBrainz and then use the fetched metadata to populate the tag values.\n\n*Bonus points if it has a two-step approach: first populate tag\nvalues from filename or MusicBrainz, then let me edit them, finally\nre-tag files.\nI understand that 1. and 2. are pretty standard, but what about points\n3.-5.?\n\nA: Puddletag should do everything you asked for. There's also an article on it at \nUbuntu Geek\nMusicBrainz Picard can automatically identify albums via audio finger-printing. If the music is not popular enough to be entered into their open database, you can add an entry and finger-prints for future users.\n\nA: EasyTag is the most comprehensive tagger I've found for Ubuntu, and I've tried many.  It does lookups from CDDB and allows for your #5 criteria, which is probably my favorite thing about it.  It can format file/directory names based on tags and vice versa.  It has a learning curve, but once you get it down it's by far my fav (be sure to enable the filebrowser pane!).  It's available in Ubuntu Software Center/Synaptic.\nMusicBrainz Picard is another tagger, which does auto lookup, but it doesn't come close to meeting all your requirements.  However it is a good tagger, but can be testy at times...  It is also available in the repositories.\n", "Q: How to update Ubuntu terminal? How to update Ubuntu terminal?\n\nA: I would use Synaptic if you're a beginner (I actually use apt-get but that's been covered above). Open Synaptic and search for the terminal program that you want to update. Check the box next to it and save your configuration. It's very easy to manage packages with Synaptic. Try things out and read the help files and you'll be an expert in no time.\nAlso, the Update Manager should run at startup and check for updates. You can run the update manager by itself and it will upgrade all of the packages on your system (or even upgrade to a new distribution). \nSynaptic and Update Manager should give you what you need.\n\nA: execute this in a terminal :\nVIA APT-GET :\nUsing apt-get command line tool\napt-get is the command-line tool for handling packages. You can use following command options:\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-get update: Update is used to resynchronize the package index files from their sources via Internet.\n\n*apt-get upgrade: Upgrade is used to install the newest versions of all packages currently installed on the system\n\n*apt-get install package-name: install is followed by one or more packages desired for installation. If package is already installed it will try to update to latest version.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal and type following two commands (Application > Accessories > Terminal):\n\n*Get update software list, enter:\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n*Update software(s) i.e. apply updates:\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\n", "Q: Auto-login to console as root - no Xserver I'm setting up a PC for a very specific purpose. It's going to do some stuff deep underwater... round about 3km. We don't fear fish hijacking the box locally ;).\nI'm trying to set up a login: no Xserver. Works well... I edited gdm.conf not to start. Great: that's how Linux is supposed to be in the first place. \nNow my next and last task is: get the login. I googled upstart, event.d - my 10.4 distribution I recently installed doesn't have this or it doesn't work like I expect. I want the box to boot and to provide a local root shell. Just that...\nHow is this possible?\nedit: \npossible tags: headless, auto-login. Can't set that....\n\nA: If you just want the box to start up with a root console, why running login in the first place?  You can bypass it and just start a shell on any TTY.\nPrograms running on the text consoles tty1 to tty6 are configured in the files /etc/init/ttyX.conf.  Now, the getty program accepts a -l option to specify a program to start (default in /bin/login) - you can specify /bin/sh instead, and get a root shell. You need to give the -n option as well, to prevent getty from prompting for the user name.\nWrapping up: edit /etc/init/tty1.conf and replace the exec /sbin/getty ... line with:\nexec /sbin/getty -n -l /bin/sh -8 38400 tty1\n\nSame for tty2, tty3, ...\n\nA: To actually enable root logins, you have to set a password for the root account and then unlock the locked root account. If you don't set a password for the root account the passwd command will return\npasswd: unlocking the password would result in a passwordless account.  \n\nSo, first execute in a terminal:\nsudo passwd root\n\nyou will prompted for a new Unix password. Write it twice(second for confirmation).\nThen execute:\nsudo passwd -u root \n\nto unlock the account. This should return \npasswd: password expiry information changed\n\nReverting back\nIf you want to disable root account in Ubuntu you need to lock the root account by using the following command:\nsudo passwd -l root\n\nSecond:\nOpen the terminal and type:\ngksudo gedit /etc/ect/lightdm/lightdm.config\n\n(Orignal ) this it what it should already look like\nSeatDefaults] \ngreeter-session=unity-greeter          \nuser-session=unity                         \ngreeter-show-manual-login=true \ngreeter-show-manual-login=true \n\n(What you need to replace the original with)\n[SeatDefaults] \nautologin-user=<YOUR USER> \nautologin-user-timeout=0 \nuser-session=ubuntu \ngreeter-session=unity-greeter \n\n", "Q: NVIDIA 96 not working in Maverick I recently upgraded to Maverick and X stopped working.

If all you care about are user data and preferences, you could probably just copy everything from your home directory on the VM to a file system outside the VM (a keydrive, for example), copy those files over to a fresh Ubuntu install and then reinstall any programs you had installed on the VM.  Depends on how much you've customized the VM install, versus how much trouble the other solutions here would be.\n\nA: I like to use rsync for backing up my system. This is good for a home directroy or ect directory but might not be what you're looking for in terms of a complete system migration. To use rsync, you'll need to install ubuntu on both systems. Update both of them so that the packages are the same and are at the same level (this isn't mandatory but does make things easier). Then, to copy your home dir from server1 to server2 you can run the following on server1:\n$rsync -avz /home/username/ username@server2:/home/username/\n\nThe thing that I like about this is that rsync will calculate the differences between directories and transfer the changes rather than everything. This way you can keep your backup current by running on server2 (to backup on server1):\n$rsync -avz /home/username/ username@server1:/home/username/\n\nhth\n", "Q: What is 'compositing'? I have Compiz enabled and use the 3D desktop cube with rotation as long as various cool minimize animations.\nRecently when I boot the computer, Docky has been telling me to 'enable compositing'. I don't know what compositing is! Docky is working fine as it always has been though, so I don't know why it is suddenly asking me this (I'm guessing it is confused and that it is actually enabled but I'm not sure).\nSo what is compositing and is it enabled because I am using Compiz or is it something different?\nWhat does 'compositing' mean exactly?\n\nA: Compositing is provided by Compiz, which is a compositing window manager. What it means is explained below:\n\nA compositing window manager is a\ncomponent of a computer's graphical\nuser interface that draws windows and\ntheir borders. It also controls how\nthey display and interact with each\nother, and with the rest of the\ndesktop environment. The main\ndifference between a compositing\nwindow manager and other window\nmanagers is that instead of outputting\nto a common screen, programs each\noutput first to a separate and\nindependent buffer, or temporary\nlocation inside the computer, where\nthey can be manipulated before they\nare shown.[1][2]\nThe window manager then processes and\ncombines, or composites, output from\nthese separate buffers onto a common\ndesktop. The result is that the\nprograms now behave as independent 2D\nor 3D objects.[1] Compositing allows\nfor advanced visual effects, such as\ntransparency, fading, scaling,\nduplicating, bending and contorting,\nshuffling, and redirecting\napplications. The addition of a\nvirtual third dimension allows for\nfeatures such as realistic shadows\nbeneath windows, the appearance of\ndistance and depth, live thumbnail\nversions of windows, and complex\nanimations, to name just a few.[3][4]\nBecause the programs draw to the\noff-screen buffer, all graphics are\nnaturally double buffered and thus do\nnot flicker as they are updated.\nThe most commonly-used compositing\nwindow managers include the Desktop\nWindow Manager in Microsoft Windows,\nthe Quartz Compositor in Mac OS X, and\nCompiz, Metacity and KWin for Linux,\nFreeBSD and OpenSolaris systems.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager\n\nIf you see a black border around docky, then compositing is not properly enabled. The warning you are getting is most likely a result of Docky starting before compositing kicks in.\nSee https://bugs.launchpad.net/docky/+bug/552273\n", "Q: How can I tell update manager not to update a package? I'm using 10.04 and have installed Virtualbox 3.2.10 (not the ose one, but the .deb file from Oracle). It has a dependency on libqt4-opengl which depends on qt version 4.6, but the update manager wants to update to qt 4.7 and remove Virtualbox.  \nHow do I keep it from doing that so that I can get the rest of the updates?\n\nA: Answering to the question - here is the command for your shell:\necho \"libqt4-opengl hold\" | dpkg --set-selections\n\nand to revert it back to update-able:\necho \"libqt4-opengl install\" | dpkg --set-selections\n\nReplace libqt4-opengl with your package's name if I've guessed it incorrectly.\n\nA: Why you don't install it with the Debian-based Linux distributions process it better and more secure follow the step accord with your ubuntu distribution :\nhttp://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads\n\nA: You can use aptitude to hold a specific package version, this is done like this:\naptitude install <package>=<version>\n\nThis will place the package on hold for that given version. To revert simply do\naptitude unhold <package>\n\n\nA: The Update Manager tends to do it's own thing and keep you up with the latest packages. I haven't figured out how to make Update Manager keep packages where they are and so I use apt-get to \"pin\" packages to a specific version. NB - all of the package management systems tend to do this differently so you'll have to chose one package manager and stick with it.\nFirst, install the package version that you want.\nNext, use apt-cache policy to see which version you are using:\n$$ apt-cache policy xterm\nxterm:\n  Installed: 241-1ubuntu1\n  Candidate: 241-1ubuntu1\n  Version table:\n *** 241-1ubuntu1 0\n        500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com jaunty/main Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\nFinally, edit /etc/apt/policies and add an entry for your package:\nPackage: xterm\nPin: version 241*\nPriority: 1001\n\nNow you can run:\n$sudo apt-get update\n$sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nand your package will be kept at the current version. If you want to over-ride this use dist-upgrade:\n$sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n", "Q: What is causing my spacebar to randomly stop working? A couple of times a day, I'll be typing something and realise I can't type spaces. Usually the cursor will flicker instead when I press the spacebar, and I can type all other letters as far as I can tell. If I'm in a terminal the cursor turns from a solid square to an empty square until I release the spacebar.\nFor some reason, restarting compiz with alt-F2 compiz fixes it, until it next occurs.\nI can still copy and paste spaces from sources that already have them, and I can still insert spaces with ctrl-shift-u, 20, enter.\nThis has been happening for a while, since before I upgraded to maverick, but it feels like its beceoming more frequent. There really doesn't seem to be any kind of a pattern to it.\nI'm using 64 bit ubuntu 10.10 on a system76 panp7 laptop.\nAny ideas how I might troubleshoot?\nEDIT:\nusing xev, normally a spacebar registers as:\nKeyPress event, serial 36, synthetic NO, window 0x5600001,\n    root 0x101, subw 0x0, time 26488647, (88,403), root:(748,458),\n    state 0x10, keycode 65 (keysym 0x20, space), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 1 bytes: (20) \" \"\n    XmbLookupString gives 1 bytes: (20) \" \"\n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nKeyRelease event, serial 36, synthetic NO, window 0x5600001,\n    root 0x101, subw 0x0, time 26488729, (88,403), root:(748,458),\n    state 0x10, keycode 65 (keysym 0x20, space), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 1 bytes: (20) \" \"\n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nBut when it's stopped behaving a press of the spacebar instead gives the three events:\nFocusOut event, serial 36, synthetic NO, window 0x5600001,\n    mode NotifyGrab, detail NotifyAncestor\n\nFocusIn event, serial 36, synthetic NO, window 0x5600001,\n    mode NotifyUngrab, detail NotifyAncestor\n\nKeymapNotify event, serial 36, synthetic NO, window 0x0,\n    keys:  2   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   \n           0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0 \n\nFURTHER EDIT:\nOk, so I think I've solved the problem, and by that I mean I now know which package to file a bug against.\nI have a hot corner which initiates a window picker, and I've customised the window picking so that left click goes to a window, right click closes one and spacebar zooms in on one. When I go to this hot corner, compiz must take control of my spacebar, and clearly isn't giving it back when I leave the window picker.\nSo I'll be filing a bug against compiz.\nreported:here\n\nA: The NotifyGrab is the give-away clue. The only time I've seen that is when the window manager has a global binding which supersedes the window itself.\nYou can see this clearly if you start xev and go inside the window and press PrtScn where the window manager has arranged to handle PrtScn. In order to do this, the X event model has to FocusOut of the current window with a NotifyGrab event so that the manager can act on the input.\nNow as to what is getting your spacebar or v key bound to a window manager action, that's a different - and harder - question.\n\nA: I have the same issue, but with my lower-case Q.

If you have an NVIDIA video card, a possible solution would be to install the proprietary nvidia drivers, available from the \"restricted drivers\" application. \nYou can enable these drivers by opening up the [K] menu , selecting \"Applications\", then \"System\", and start the \"Additional drivers\" application to install the nvidia drivers.\n", "Q: Prevent windows from stealing focus I'm using Maverick with Compiz enabled.\nI've searched AskUbuntu and Google. AskUbuntu doesn't have anything on this topic and everything Google turns up is a couple years old.\nI'm doing browser tests and my tests are constantly spawning new Firefox windows. The problem is, when the window is spawned it takes focus. This is incredibly annoying as I'm usually in the middle of typing somewhere else. This doesn't only happen with my tests, but is the most common example I run into. Sometimes my IDE decides it wants focus when something special happens (like when something is done compiling) and then later I'll find fragments of IM messages I've typed in my code. This is driving me crazy. I've looked in both Gnome settings and Compiz settings and can't find a way to prevent that from happening.\nDoes anyone know of a way to prevent an app from stealing focus when it is opened? I'd rather have the taskbar flash at me or something to get my attention.\n\nA: This is not something you should configure globally. \nI.e. you don't really want no new windows to take focus: you want no test windows to take focus. \nTo accomplish this, use the Compiz Window Rules plugin to prevent all \"test\" Firefox windows from taking focus. \nYou would need to write a rule to identify only \"test\" Firefox instances. If they all have a specific string in the title, that would work. Otherwise you could use wmctrl to set the WM_ICON_NAME X property. (I don't know how to easily set X properties for Firefox .. if anyone else does, please chime in!)\n\nA: The setting is in CompizConfig > General > Focus & Raise Behavior as so documented. The Window Matching rules are quite important.\n\nA: If you're working in one window most of the time you could right-click on the title bar and tell the window to be always on top... it's not a perfect solution, but you could shade the window when you're done, or minimize it then return to it...\n\nA: You can change this setting in the gconf-editor also, in case you don't have CCSM installed. Navigate to /apps/compiz/general/screen0/options/focus_prevention_level key and set its value to 4.\nFor some people, 4 is too high.  Eclipse users will find that various dialogs won't grab the keyboard focus correctly when this is set to 4, but will if set to 3.\n", "Q: How can I make the draggable window border thicker, without changing the appearance? When you want to resize a window in gnome (as well as in other systems) you can click-and-hold at the window's border and than drag it.

I think, (but am not sure) that I did that on my machine, previously.  Does hulu.com even use Flash?  One point to mention is that he is running on a laptop, and I am running from a desktop.\n\nA: Your friend might have better luck with the Hulu Desktop Player.\n\nA: Fullscreen flash has terrible performance on linux. If you don't have a fast computer, it will be very choppy.\nBecause Flash is proprietary, there's nothing we can do except hope Adobe improves it.

This mouse is (unfortunately) really sensitive, and so it sometimes gets hard to hit small icons with the mouse pointer. This is really a hardware issue, it's not a bug and it's not Ubuntu's/gnome's fault. Still, I would very much like to this issue through software (solving through hardware would imply buying a new mouse).\nBack in Windows, if I set the sensitivity as really low it was comfortable enough. In Ubuntu, even the lowest sensitivity and acceleration available (in the System>Prerences>Mouse menu) is still frustrating. How can I decrease it below the default minimum?\nI tried xset, but it seems xset only deals with acceleration and threshold, but not actual sensitivity.\n\nA: I have a Razer DeathAdder mouse and like in your case, the sensitivity/acceleration are too high even if I put them at the lowest level in the mouse preferences. So to solve this problem, I used the xinput command.\nFirst, you will need your mouse ProductName and ID:\nxinput list\n...\n Razer Razer DeathAdder                     id=8    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n...\n\nThen you set the constant deceleration level that suits your needs with this command: \nxinput set-prop 8 \"Device Accel Constant Deceleration\" 3\n# 8 = DEVICE_ID\n# 3 = LEVEL (factor) Higher = Slower.\n\nTo make the config persistent (and make it system wide), you will need to edit your xorg.conf (/etc/X11/xorg.conf).\nSection \"InputClass\"\n   Identifier      \"Razer\"                    # Whatever you want.\n   MatchProduct    \"Razer Razer DeathAdder\"   # Product name from xinput list.\n   Option          \"ConstantDeceleration\" \"3\" # The same value as xinput.\nEndSection\n\nOnce you reboot, you should have the same result as the xinput command.\nLet me know if it helps.\n\nA: Late reply, but I think this is worth posting:\nSince we're talking about gaming mouse here. Better is to turn off the mouse acceleration entirely (useful for FPS gamers etc.).

Not sure this is quite as ideal as the old setting, but it's pretty close.\nxset m 3\n\nThat still works pretty darn well.  Need to figure out how to save so this is the default on reboot.\nUbuntu 16.04\n@JackTravis 's answer was incredibly helpful, but I think it's worth updating for 16.04 because the xorg.conf file has moved and been split into multiple files.  Before writing this answer, I tried using xset and played around with the xinput settings for a while before deciding that JackTravis's xinput ConstantDeceleration 3 setting was the best one for both my Logitech M510 on my desktop and some older wired mouse on my laptop.\n1. List Mice\n$ xinput list\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Logitech M510                             id=10   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Synaptics Inc. Composite TouchPad / TrackPoint    id=13   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n...\n\nMy mouse was the Logitech M510, id=10 so I'm going to use that in this example.  You will need to replace that with whatever your mouse is called.  Now, use xinput set-prop to try out various settings until your mouse moves exactly as you want it to.  The 10 in the following corresponds to the id=10 for my mouse on my system.  You'll probably have to change that.\n2. Change Your Settings Temporarily\n$ xinput set-prop 10 \"Device Accel Constant Deceleration\" 3\n\nIf you're curious what other settings affect your device try\n$ xinput --list-props 10\n\nTo clear the settings after I had really messed them up, all I had to do was unplug and re-plug my mouse.\n3. Save the New Setting Permanently\nIf you like ConstantDeceleration of 3, then you need to add an xorg.conf file the new Ubuntu 16.04 way: by adding a new file in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/  You will want to change Logitech M510 and logitech-m510 in the file name to match your mouse.  I think the 60- at the beginning of the file name is the priority with which these files are loaded.  The following one-line shell command is what I put in my machineSetup.sh file in Dropbox so that I can quickly customize a new machine exactly how I like it within minutes of a fresh install:\nsudo sh -c \"echo 'Section \\\"InputClass\\\"\\n\\\n   Identifier      \\\"My awesome new mouse\\\"\\n\\\n   MatchProduct    \\\"Logitech M510\\\"\\n\\\n   Option          \\\"ConstantDeceleration\\\" \\\"3\\\"\\n\\\nEndSection\\n' > /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/60-logitech-m510.conf\"\n\nOR, if you want to do it the GUI way, open an editor as root then paste and edit the following into /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/60-<whatever>.conf\nSection \"InputClass\"\n   Identifier      \"My Awesome Blue Mouse\"\n   MatchProduct    \"Logitech M510\"\n   Option          \"ConstantDeceleration\" \"3\"\nEndSection\n\n4. Reboot\nThat's it.  Just reboot and verify that the new settings took effect.\n\nA: If you use the PS2 port the mouse movement is much slower for the same mouse resolution.\nFor your mouse try to use a USB to PS2 converter and put the mouse it the PS2 port.\nEdit:\nI have found the xorg.conf working solution:\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n    Identifier     \"Mouse0\"\n    Driver         \"mouse\"\n    Option         \"Sensitivity\" \"0.2\"\nEndSection\n\nWhere a sensitivity of 1 is the default and the 0.2 one is decreasing it five times.\n\nA: Read the manual for your mouse first before trying any of these other answers.\nRazer brand mice have on the fly sensitivity features.  For the DeathAdder that is mentioned in the accepted post, the one I use has 2 buttons on the top that controls sensitivity.  If you make config changes first, you could one day have sensitivity that is too low because you unknowingly triggered the built in sensitivity features in the mouse.\nI had just had this issue where I set the sensitivity as low as it would go and it was still too high, but it worked fine just days before.  I had pressed the button to increase the sensitivity not knowing what they did, thinking I could use them as additional buttons for a game and ended up with very high mouse sensitivity.  It's happened to me before, then would go back to normal and I never knew why, until just now.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install gnome-tweaks.

You can select multiple videos as long as you select them in order or you can append one by one. Then click \"Start muxing\". You might want to change the output filename. The other options are not really necessary for basic merging. Nevertheless, you can also add multiples subtitles in various formats or languages and also multiple audio tracks.\n\nA: openshot video editor The one and only.

So as far as I know the server should be set up to work.\n\nA: There are 2 Exchange-plugins for Evolution:\n\n\n*\n\n*evolution-exchange which uses the \"Outlook Web Access\" interface over the HTTP protocol\n\n*evolution-mapi which uses the proprietary MAPI protocol (this is what Outlook uses)\n\n\nBoth ways to access Exchange have to be enabled separately on the server, and probably also in firewalls etc. to work.\nWhich one are you using, and did you try the other one?\n", "Q: Clean Install Of Ubuntu Server over the network? I have an install of Ubuntu server, I was recently fooling around with it, and as all learning processes do, I messed a few things up. \nI would this box to be secure and reliable in the future, So I have decided to do a clean install of the system. Is there a way I can do it over the network (PCs and a router) without having to connect a monitor, and burning the cd?\nBasically a network install after I completely remove the previous copy of Ubuntu 10.04?\nThoughts? Please and thank you.\n\nA: PXE booting\nWhat you are looking for is called PXE booting. It means you have 1 computer (the PXE server) running on your network, which will install ubuntu on other computers on the network. When a computer on the network is started, the PXE server kicks in and starts an ubuntu install. \nThe setup process is pretty complex and only really usefull if you have to manage a lot of systems. A complete manual can be found on these Ubuntu help pages.\nUnattended installation\nAnother possibility is creating an unattended CD. Also help pages provided by Ubuntu for this. Note that it does require a keyboard and screen on the new installed computer, but you might manage to do this without a screen (by hitting enter when you think the PC is ready :p). You basically create a new ubuntu CD, which will read an installation configuration file you provided.\n", "Q: How do you compile multiple kernels from the git repository? I've been trying to identify a kernel change that has killed hibernate on my Dell Inspiron 600m and I've made some good progress by checking out the kernel source from the git repository and rolling a kernel that does not have this bug (version 2.6.28-18.60). I'm now trying to compile the next kernel in the change log (version 2.6.28-19.61) but the build is failing with the error message:\n  INSTALL fs/ntfs/ntfs.ko\nstrip:/home/spinlock/kernel/9.04/source/debian/linux-image-2.6.28-19-core3//lib/modules/2.6.28-19-core3/kernel/fs/ntfs/ntfs.ko: File format not recognized\nmake[4]: *** [fs/ntfs/ntfs.ko] Error 1\nmake[3]: *** [_modinst_] Error 2\nmake[2]: *** [sub-make] Error 2\nmake[1]: *** [install-core3] Error 2\nmake: *** [binary-core3] Error 2\n\nI've been using the instructions for rolling a kernel here and I can compile the first version but I get a failure when I try to switch to the next branch and compile from there. Is there a \"make dep\" or a \"make clean\" that I might be missing in the build process?\nThanks.\n\nA: This error was caused by not running \"make clean\" before building the kernel packages. \"make clean\" and the problem goes away.\n", "Q: Revert to original Ubuntu set of package I've installed Ubuntu 10.04 6 months ago and then I've added a lot of packages. Now i upgraded to Ubuntu 10.10 and i want to remove all the packages in order to revert to the original ubuntu 10.10 fresh install package-set.How to do that???\n\nA: It is virtually impossible, because you cannot say if a package, like aptitude, is no more in the standard install package set, or the reverse.\nMoreover you cannot say if some new package version has some new dependency, or lack some dependency it previously had (this is not common, anyway).\nHowever, in the /var/log/dpkg.log* files there is all the history of your system, but it is not simple to analyze and take some decisions based on that.\nCome to mind that you can do a dpkg --get-selections >output in some other freshly installed 10.10 system, and use this information to modify your system: \nsudo dpkg --set-selections <output\nsudo apt-get dselect-upgrade\n\n\nA: Just install 10.10 on the same partition as 10.04 was on before.  You'll need to use the \"advanced\" partitioning in the installer to select the partition (and make sure you don't format it!).   The installer will then delete everything on that partition except /home, /root (and probably other user data, I don't know the exact list) before installing.  The result is a clean install, but without the loss of your documents etc.\n(You might still want to backup your data of course, in case you (or the installer) make an error or something.)\n", "Q: RAID array rebuilt no longer mounts -- isw_ *randchars*_STRIPE changed I have a RAID 5 system, ICH10R, on a eVGA classified x58 motherboard. The RAID failed because of an application failure in Windows 7 (dual boot) which forced a hard restart. \nI rebuilt the array using the Intel Matrox Storage Manager app in Windows 7 (all automatic), but now the random characters changed and my drives won't mount. Basically the random prefix changed and now Kubuntu doesn't know where to look.

So I've already exhausted my googling skills, just curious if anyone knows of unpublished settings or things I may have missed?\nThanks!!!\n\nA: It is recommended to always refer to filesystems by their UUID, instead of their /dev path, which may change, based on driver, timing, etc. To get the UUID, use blkid:\nsudo blkid /dev/mapper/isw_bedfhcecfj_STRIPE#\n\nThen replace /dev/mapper/isw_bedfhcecfj_STRIPE# in /etc/fstab with UUID=...what blkid reported for uuid...\n", "Q: How can I enable double-click execution from flash drives? Ubuntu 10.10 does not allow double-click execution of files such as binaries or Python scripts if they are on a flash drive, even when the file is marked as executable.\nI believe it is probably a security measure new to 10.10; 9.10 allows double-click execution.\nHow can I revert this behavior?\n\nA: Prior to Ubuntu 10.10, all files on drives formatted with the vfat file system (e.g. most flash drives) were mounted with the executable bit. This led to a couple of problems, in particular you were asked for all text files whether you want to open or execute them (Bug #14335). It was therefore decided to mark all files as not executable, but use the mount/fstab option \"showexec\" (which is documented in the mount man page), that's why .exe, .bat and .com are still marked as executable: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/vfat-noexec\nBy the way: This change was sent upstream, so all other distributions using udisk should now show the same behaviour. \nYou may set the mount behavior on a per-drive (using the drive's UUID) or per-mount-label basis by adding entries in your filesystem table (/etc/fstab; see man mount and man fstab for more information.) Note that this will cause duplicate entries for every affected drive in Nautilus (and perhaps other file managers as well).\nAlternatively, if you are only using your flash drive with Linux machines, you can reformat it as ext3, etx4 or similar, where the normal UNIX rights and the executable bit apply.\n", "Q: Middle Button on ThinkPad Not Working with 10.10 update I have a lenovo thinkpad and the center scrolling button isn't working with the trackpoint anymore... it worked in prior versions of Ubuntu with GPointing Device Settings, but not with 10.10.\nNow, it works when I log in, but if i close the lid to my laptop and reopen it, it no longer works.

Is there a method or command which can tell from which repository a package is coming from?\n\nA: sudo grep *packagename* /var/lib/apt/lists/* | grep \"Filename:\"\n\nsource\n\nA: apt on Ubuntu 16.04+\nBeside apt-cache policy, showpkg and show, now we have a more simple, with easy to remember subcommands: apt[1] [2] (don't get confused with classic apt-*):\napt policy <package> \n\nOr the alternative with more info apt show <package>, line starting with \"APT-Sources:\".\nDescription: This package provides command line tools for searching and managing as well as querying information about packages as low-level access to all features of the libapt-pkg library. This includes:apt-get, apt-cache, apt-cdrom, apt-config, apt-key.\nWarning: apt does not have a stable CLI interface.

Just issuing an installation request for the accidentally removed package will restore its function as before in that case. On the other hand you can get rid of these leftovers by calling purge even on already removed packages. Note that this does not affect any data or configuration stored in your home directory.\n\nTo remove residual packages:\nsudo apt purge $(dpkg -l | grep \"^rc\" | awk '{print $2}')\n\n\n\n*apt upgrade – upgrade the system by installing/upgrading packages\n\n\n*apt full-upgrade – upgrade the system by removing/installing/upgrading packages\n\n\n*apt edit-sources – edit the source information file\n\nA: Use following command. It has better output:\napt-cache policy <Package Name>\n\nFor Ubuntu 16.04 and later there is a shorter way to do that:\napt policy <Package Name>\n\n\nA: Edit:\nCheck out SuB's answer. Looks a bit simpler!\nOriginal:\nCommands Needed:\n\n*\n\n*dpkg -s <package> - allows you to\nfind the version of  that\nyou have installed. (source)\n\n*apt-cache showpkg <package> - will\nshow a list of Versions of the\npackage available. For each version,\nthe source of the package, in the\nform of an index file name, will be\ngiven.\n\nIf you want to find the source of the package that's currently installed, you'll need the output of dpkg -s <package>. Otherwise, you can simply look at the newest version output by apt-cache showpkg <package>.\nExample:\n$ dpkg -s liferea\nPackage: liferea\nStatus: install ok installed\nPriority: optional\nSection: web\nInstalled-Size: 760\nMaintainer: Ubuntu Developers <ubuntu-devel-discuss@lists.ubuntu.com>\nArchitecture: i386\nVersion: 1.6.2-1ubuntu6\n...\n\n$ apt-cache showpkg liferea\nPackage: liferea\nVersions: \n1.6.2-1ubuntu6.1 (/var/lib/apt/lists/archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_lucid-updates_main_binary-i386_Packages)\n Description Language: \n                 File: /var/lib/apt/lists/archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_lucid-updates_main_binary-i386_Packages\n                  MD5: 557b0b803b7ed864e6d14df4b02e3d26\n\n1.6.2-1ubuntu6 (/var/lib/apt/lists/archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_lucid_main_binary-i386_Packages) (/var/lib/dpkg/status)\n Description Language: \n                 File: /var/lib/apt/lists/archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_lucid_main_binary-i386_Packages\n                  MD5: 557b0b803b7ed864e6d14df4b02e3d26\n...\n\nFrom the first command, I can see that Liferea version 1.6.2-1ubuntu6 is installed. From the second command, I can see that that version is listed in /var/lib/apt/lists/archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_lucid_main_binary-i386_Packages.\nWithout too much effort, I can deduce that the source line contains archive.ubuntu.com, ubuntu, lucid, and main.\nAnd, sure enough, my /etc/apt/sources.list contains the following line.\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu lucid main universe restricted multiverse\n\n\nA: Sadly, this information is not recorded during package installation. You can make a decent guess if the repository is still in the source list and the repository still has the package:\ngrep -l PKG /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\nEven synaptic cannot tell if you disable the repository and update.\n\nA: Another useful command is \"apt-cache policy\".

If you're using bash shell, you may find\nthis script to be helpful especially if you're coming from MacOS using terminal open command.\nHere's the bash version\nHere's the ported to zsh version\n\nA: You can simply open using a directory in File explorer using\ngio open /path/to/folder\n\n", "Q: Where is the gnome option to display icons in menus? I used to go to \"System >> Preferences >> Appearance >> Interface\", but I can't find that tab on Lucid or Maverick.\n\nA: The gconf key is /desktop/gnome/interface/menus_have_icons.\nNote: I don't particularly endorse setting it to \"True\" in the long run. See Andreas Nilsson's post and the discussion in the related bug for the rationale behind setting it to \"False\" by default.\n\nA: You could also use Ubuntu Tweak. They have an option for that, among many other things. It also allows you to put icons in buttons.\n", "Q: Delete confirmation missing when I hit the delete key I'm sick of accidentally deleting files and directories as DEL button is badly located on my keyboard. I would really like it if ubuntu asked me to confirm before deleting anything. Is there a way to do this?\n\nA: Unless this has recently changed without my knowing, there is no way to get a delete confirmation on delete in Ubuntu. This is a feature that has been requested many times in Ubuntu, but is yet to be implemented thus far. \n\nA: While there's no delete confirmation dialog, Nautilus can tell us which files we've just deleted.\nGo to the trash and select \"List\" as view mode. This information is in the Trashed-On column.\nIt appears that Nautilus may be the only file browser that shows this information. I checked Thunar and PCManFM; none of them are able to show this column.\n\nA: There is a setting for this in the Nautilus preferences (in the \"Behavior\" tab), but I just tested with a clean profile and asking for confirmation is on by default.\n\nA: Kinda think both options if you are sure of someone asking either of them... This saves both times. Also it may help someone having the problem different than the other.\nSo in simple words, try to answer in all possible ways, if u are not that busy. :)\nWell, MY ANSWER is: \n\nDelete confirmation is on by default, and can be set to off. \n   But Move to Trash confirmation is off, and can't be modified yet!\n\n", "Q: How do I align my partition table properly?

See also this simple calculator for different RAID levels and number of disks.\nFor SSD erase block alignment the parameters are:\n\n\n*\n\n*fs block size (ex. 4096)\n\n*SSD erase block size (ex. 128k)\n\n*stripe-width:  erase-block-size / fs-block-size (ex. 128k / 4k = 32)\nFrom Theodore's SSD post.\nAligning LVM extents\nThe potential issue is that LVM creates a 192k header. This is a multiple of 4k (so no issue with 4k-block disks) but may not be a multiple of RAID stripe size (if LVM runs on a RAID) or SSD erase block size (if LVM runs on SSD). \nSee Theodore's post for the workaround.\n\nA: It seems like mkfs.ext4 wants filesystems on your RAID to start on a 64 KiB boundary.  If you use the whole disk, it starts at 0 which is of course also a multiple of 64 KiB...\nMost partitioning tools nowadays will use a 1 MiB boundary by default anyway (fdisk probably doesn't).\nThe reason for this is that most hard disks & SSDs use fysical sectors on the device that are much bigger than the logical sectors.  The result of that is that if you read a logical sector of 512 bytes from disk, the hardware actually has to reads a much larger amount of data.\nIn case of your software RAID device something similar happens: data on it is stored in \"chunks\" of 64 KiB with the default mdadm settings.\n", "Q: Authenticating samba shares with active directory users and groups I am looking for instruction on how to configure my Ubuntu 10.04 box to allow samba shares access through Active Directory users and groups.

I am using Ubuntu several years, but want to really study about how Linux works, and was wondering what books you recommend.  Thanks!!\n\nA: The best real book I have found is UNIX and Linux System Administration Handbook\nEveryone will learn something from this book. It is awesome.\nFor Ubuntu specifically, the Official Ubuntu Documentation is fairly hard to beat.\nIf you really want to get a good understanding of linux, why not build your own installation from scratch?\n\nA: Since you weren't specific on exactly what part of Linux you are looking to learn it is hard for me to know exactly what to recommend.\n\n*\n\n*If you're looking for Linux in general, Linux in a Nutshell is pretty good;\n\n\n*If you're interested in the Linux kernel and perhaps how to compile one, The Linux Kernel in a Nutshell;\n\n\n*If you're looking for the inner workings of Google, you can get a good amount online without books as well. For example, The Ultimate Linux Newbie Guide;\nOr these for more comprehensive topics:\n\n*\n\n*A Tour of the Linux Filesystem\n\n*Workings Linux Kernel (editor's note: link is 404)\nA search of Google can reveal thousands of sites, as well as books like these. Good luck with your studies!\n\nA: If you're really new to Linux, and want to know more about Ubuntu, you could try out Ubuntu Manual, for 10.04 (though it's still good for 10.10). It's a nice, basic overview for beginners. The online PDF version is free, but you can buy the book if you really like it.\nEDIT: After re-reading your post, and your comments, I have realized this may be too basic for you. Still, there are interesting bits too it even for more advanced users.\n\nA: When I started with Ubuntu I purchased Ubuntu Unleashed and really thought it explained a lot for me.  Still refer back to it for reference occasionally. \n\nA: Check this post on WebUpd8. It's about 20 great Linux books.\n\nA: This is my favorite book on Linux, called Linux System Administrator Street Smarts. It's also available at Barnes and Noble. It goes through all the linux basics and comes with a lot of practical examples, tutorials, tasks, etc to walk you through using what you're reading, as well as some great ready-made examples for real-life linux tasks (e.g. network authentication, apache configuration, etc.). \n\nA: Ubuntu Linux for Non-Geeks: A Pain-Free, Project-Based, Get-Things-Done Guidebook\n(Author: Rickford Grant)\n\nA: I'd suggest the LPI Linux Certification \"Wikibook\". The book is still incomplete, but already has Basic content which you can surely benefit from. I can assure you it would be one of the best learning sources available, once it is complete. BTW, its completely free! :)\n", "Q: \"Key\" Panel Indicator Missing I'm hoping I'm not imagining things, but I'm fairly sure that I saw a clean 10.04 install with a key icon displayed in the menu bar. I believe it appeared when sudo was active for updating, etc. I don't seem to have this icon anymore, and I was wondering if it was something I removed inadvertently, or a problem because of the number of upgrades I've done.\nIf you know of this icon/functionality, please let me know.\n\nA: The key icon is just to show you when you are using elevated or root privilege and gives you the option to drop those privileges. I don't see this icon all the time too and that is the way it is meant to be. As far as I can remember, I usually see this icon while installing something from the software centre or running something with root privileges.\n", "Q: How to make Thunderbird open links in Firefox? I'm trying to use Thunderbird again, but I can't make it use Firefox to open links. I'm using KDE and Firefox is my default browser.

I don't mean the flash player here, I'm talking about the flash program that I can make animations with. Like Adobe Flash CS (formerly known as Macromedia flash). Is there a program on linux that I can make animations? I want to make a movie like animator vs animation. I used easy gif animator on windows lol it was a bit harder than flash but I'm on linux and I'd like to know what it has to offer. Worse case scenario, what gif animators are there on linux.\n\nA: In addition to Pencil (which has notoriously slow development) and Synfig, Ktoon was recently resurrected as Tupi and is being actively developed as of writing this.\nIt has a more familiar interface for animation and only uses a single window, unlike Synfig\n\nA: Some alternatives for Flash are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pencil (available in the Software Centre)\n\n*Synfig (available in the Software Centre on 16.04)\n\n\nBoth may not be as powerful as Flash, but they may get your work done.\n\nA: Synfig is probably what you are looking for.\nThe software's main focus is vector animation but it's able to do animated gif's as well. I'm reasonably certain it's the closest thing to Flash you're going to find on Linux (as of this typing). \n\nA: Unfortunately I haven't seen a viable flash creating application for Linux.  Gimp has animated GIF support where you create each frame as a layer and in the Filters option you can choose the delay of each layer which then gives an animation.  The only other option I can see is to either try and use Wine or a Virtual Machine to get around this issue.\n\nA: If you didn't sell those versions of flash, you can install Wine, and install the software that way. But, Wine does take alot of space, and it needs yu to manually configure its registery.\n\nA: http://wideo.co is an excellent free tool to create 2d animation videos.

Are there?\nThis would be useful for helping Apple users switch to Ubuntu also when I'm trying to convert them ;)\n\nA: Launchpad is basicaly the same as Unity. Mac App Store = Ubuntu Software Center. Full screen apps (as they'll work on Lion) depend on the apps developers. Mission Control is nearly the same as scale compiz plugin, but you can only manage windows.\n", "Q: Prevent LiveCD using existing swap partition I have an existing installation with a swap partition, and I want to boot a Ubuntu 10.04 Desktop LiveCD without using the swap partition. I want to avoid using the swap partition so that I can resize it and other partitions.\n\nA: If you're using an Ubuntu Live CD, you can disable the use of the swap partition trough the Partition Editor (GParted) by right-clicking the swap partition, and selecting swapoff.\nThis should allow to to resize the partition.\n\nA: You can add noswap to the grub parameters to achieve this.\nBut it's usually easier to let the Live CD boot normally and then in a console type:\nsudo swapoff device\n\nWhere device is the file or partition of the swap.\n\nA: If the live CD uses swap you can disable it with swapoff command. Swap is also not required to install Ubuntu, but recommended.\n\nA: I was wrong, and the Live CD does use an existing swap partition. There is no noswap cheat code listed (I tried the noswap cheat code anyway, but the swap was still used).\nI'm stumped on how to prevent using swap at boot time, but for repartitioning purposes the other posters suggested how to turn the swap off.\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ swapon -s\nFilename    Type        Size     Used   Priority\n/dev/sda5   partition   225272   0      -1\n\n", "Q: GUI tools for Apache Are there any GUI tools for configuring and monitoring Apache?\n\nA: I used this for a while, it doesnt have to many feature but it does it job for managing modules and virtualhosts.\n\nRapache is a simple tool for\n  remotely managing and configuring an\n  apache2 instance without having to\n  hassle around through configuration\n  files.\n\n\nA: You could user Webmin that is a webapp for managing servers.

I've started playing around with remote X sessions and really like it so far as it allows me to use GUI tools to configure my server (sometimes, I just don't feel like editing text files).\nOne thing that bothers me though, is that unlike my desktop Ubuntu, I have no way to discover which application to launch for a given task. \nFor example, on my desktop, if I want to manage users, I simply click my way to \"System / Administration / Users and Groups\". When I ssh -X into my remote server, the only way to launch new applications is through the command line. If I want to use the user management application, I  first have to find the name of the binary, which is not always obvious to do. Right now, here is how I do it: \n1) Launch the application using my local desktop menu \n2) Launch \"gnome-system-monitor\" and find the name of the binary \n3) Launch the binary from my ssh session\nIs there any better way to do this (apart from using a full fletched remote desktop solution as FreeNX)? For instance, isn't there any standalone application that can act as the desktop menu which I could launch from my remote X session?\nUPDATE: I just found out I could launch gnome-panel remotely. It does exactly what I need (the applications/places/system menus). The draw back is that it's messy because my local applications get mixed with the remote ones.\n\nA: I have tried to use gnome-panel over ssh in my computer and it worked. It replaced my awn bar with two pannels with the stock gnome theme. I can see in the bottom bar all my running programs, both local and remote. If I start a program from the menu it launches the remote version, in the same way, the Places Menu also open remote nautilus in remote locations.\nQuite an interesting experience. I'm not sure if it will be useful for me, too used to pure command line.\nInteresting enough pressing \"Print Screen\" saves the screenshot in my local computer:\n\nI know, this is not a real answer, just a glorified comment. The answer will be use gnome-panel.\n\nA: If you want a list of all applications in your Gnome Menu, you can do \nls /usr/share/applications/\n\nAll those *.desktop files are the menu shortcuts.\nThis may provide something close to what you are asking for and give you a list of available applications.\nHowever the file name is not always the command to run. \nFor example in the listing you will see \n/usr/share/applications/openoffice.org-draw.desktop\n\nBut to run OpenOffic.org Draw, you use the command ooffice -draw. \nThe command can be determined by looking at the \"Exec\" line in /usr/share/applications/openoffice.org-draw.desktop.\n\nA: A workaround would be: right click gnome menu -> Edit Menus -> Administration -> Users and Groups -> Properties\n\nA: I start gnome-do, a launcher, both on the local and remote machine. It is keyboard/keyword oriented. Like the Ubuntu Dash, I assume, but it feels less invasive.\nI have them configured on different hotkeys: I call one of them and give it some substrings of the app name (not the binary name). Once found I launch it. The binary name would work, too, by the way, but it wouldn’t help you completing it by default.\n@Richard is half right with the .desktop files: there is a standard on how they have to look like and which locations (plural!) they should lie in. Compliant launchers/menus can pick them up from there. \n", "Q: Mounting NTFS as read-only My PC has 3 NTFS partitions (main and backups) plus Ubuntu on dual boot. I want to keep the NTFS partitions available, but mounted as read-only by default, so that other users (and accidentally even me) do not modify them in a harmful way. I see that I can't change permissions for the NTFS partitions, which is understandable.\nIf possible, I'd like that only root can change the default permissions, so that none of the other users could modify them without switching to Windows. If that's not possible, making NTFS unmountable would be OK too.\nThis is mostly a protective measure to avoid corrupting my Windows system, as I'll still use it quite a lot.\nEdit 1: this is my fstab\n# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>\nproc            /proc           proc    nodev,noexec,nosuid 0       0\n# / was on /dev/sda7 during installation\nUUID=4a5ff937-5220-4b4e-b994-304ba37d3448 /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1\n# swap was on /dev/sda8 during installation\nUUID=a0285d57-8247-4efe-88ca-14bee4b8630b none            swap    sw              0       0\n/dev/fd0        /media/floppy0  auto    rw,user,noauto,exec,utf8 0       0\n\nSo, I'd like to set all my 3 NTFS HDs to read only (no auto mount). Also, please tell me where to find the /path/to/ntfs of each partition.\nAdditionally, can I comment the floppy entry? I don't have one anyway =)\n\nEdit 2: relevant part of 'mount -v' \n/dev/sda1 on /media/1A7099D97099BC47 type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,blksize=4096,default_permissions)\n/dev/sda5 on /media/Stuff type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,blksize=4096,default_permissions)\n/dev/sda6 on /media/Backup type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,blksize=4096,default_permissions)\n\n\nEdit 3: Ok, so I installed pysdm (Storage Device Manager), set all my NTFS partitions as mountable my any user, and as read only, and restarted. Now I can't mount the partitions:\nUnprivileged user can not mount NTFS block devices using the external FUSE library. Either mount the volume as root, or rebuild NTFS-3G with integrated FUSE support and make it setuid root. Please see more information at http://ntfs-3g.org/support.html#unprivileged\n\nAfter some reading it seems that mounting the partitions as root is not a good idea. So, how can I allow the mounting (by any user)?\n\nA: I think the easiest way to achieve this is to check your /etc/fstab and change the options for the NTFS partition to be mounted read-only.\nIn a running system you can do this temporarily with mount -o remount,ro /path/to/ntfs.\n\nA: ntfs-config \nAfter years of development, a new NTFS driver, ntfs-3g, which allows full write capability, is here.\nSince its first stable release, it has been a wonderful success, and is daily used by thousands of people around the world. However, some people do struggle with to configure their system to use it.\nThe aim of the ntfs-config project is to make life of people easier, by providing an easy way to enable/disable write capability for all their NTFS device, internal or external. You can see ntfs-config in action here.\nYou can find it in GNOME Menu in System - Administration\n\nA: So, I got a solution.\nFor those trying to do this, edit your fstab and include:\n #change '/dev/sda1' to your partition id\n #change '/mnt/ntfsfolder' to whatever mount point you want\n /dev/sda1        /mnt/ntfsfolder  ntfs-3g    defaults,umask=022 0       0\n\nWith this, only the root user will be able to write on the NTFS partition, and all other users will only be able to read it. If you want to change something on such partitions, use gksu command to execute as root. Example:\ngksu nautilus\n\nThis will open Nautilus (file manager) as root.\n\nA: You could also mount it as read only using the ro-option. This way it would be read only for all users, including root\n/dev/sda1        /mnt/ntfsfolder  ntfs-3g    defaults,ro 0       0\n\n\nA: If you prefer to use GUI, try Disks: http://www.hecticgeek.com/2012/10/make-ntfs-partitions-read-only-in-ubuntu/\n", "Q: Help compiling (need old libs) I need to get a scientific software running but it requires older libs and I don't want to screw my current system.\nI thought about using an old ubuntu version in a VM. But which would I need?\nThe software can be obtained here\nThe Readme says:\n\nThe Makefile assumes you are using wxWindows 2.4.2, and that it is\n  installed in /usr (/usr/lib/, /usr/include/wx, etc...).  It may,\n  however, be in /usr/local instead; in this case modify line 18 of the\n  Makefile appropriately.\nAlso, wxWindows 2.4.2 has conflicts with very recent versions of GTK,\n  so you are welcome to use the most recent version of wxWindows\n  (2.6.0).  However, this would also require changing the Makefile,\n  namely lines 16-18.  Also, this new version of wxWindows splits the\n  libraries up into different parts; base, core, and gl.  You would need\n  to link to all these libraries.\nIf you email me at aseem@agarwala.org, I can send you a Makefile\n  customized to 2.6.\nUPDATE: My code doesn't work with 2.6.  2.4.2 doesn't compile with\n  newer versions of g++.  So, this is a problem that I haven't had time\n  to fix.  Sorry.  You're only hope is to use an older g++.\n\n\nA: The real problem I see with the instructions you posted is that they ask for an older version of g++: installing a different library version is relatively simple, installing and running a different compiler is no small feat.  In addition, the instructions do not tell what version of g++ you should be using...\nIf I were to do this, I would proceed as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*As a search in the Ubuntu package archive reveals, no Ubuntu version has wxWindows 2.4.2; dapper has 2.4.4, hardy and jaunty have 2.4.5.  This could be a compatible version (patchlevel numbers do not change the API) but one can only know by trying...\nThey should have likely the correct g++ as well (since it was used to compile the Ubuntu package).\n\n*Install the deboostrap program, and use it to install a copy of an older Ubuntu in a directory foo:\nsudo deboostrap jaunty foo/\n\n*Download the sources and place them in some directory under foo/\n\n*Use chroot to get into the older environment and compile:\n$ sudo -s\n# chroot foo/\n(foo)# cd /source/directory; make\n\nNote that, while in a chroot, you can only access files under foo/ -- this has become the new root directory (just exit the shell to get back to normal).\nYou can also use a virtual machine instead of a chroot environment (replace steps 2., 4.); IMHO, chroots allow for more seamless usage although they can be a bit trickier to set up.\n", "Q: Where can I find the application executables in the filesystem? Where are executables for programs stored in Ubuntu?\nAn application (Komodo Edit) is asking me to identify an application to be used as a web browser. I've become used to just entering the application name as a command for situations such as these, but this scenario got me thinking. \nI know in Windows it would just be the relevant application folder in the 'program files' folder, but I'm assuming things are a bit different on Linux?\nI thought somewhere like bin would be logical but this appears to standard Linux/Unix applications. Where would I find the binary executable for applications stored on my system?\n\nA: A good CLI commad for this kind of questions is:\nwhereis <nameofwhatever>\n\nor, of course which (see below)\n\nA: The complete answer is to check out the Filesystem Hierachy Standard documentation on what stuff goes where.\nBut in your case, if you want to know where a particular executable is (for example firefox) use\nwhich firefox\n\nAnd you will get the full path like this\n/usr/bin/firefox\n\n\nA: Applications installed through the package manager usually go to /usr/bin. Applications you compile yourself go to /usr/local/bin/ unless you explicitly set a different prefix when compiling.\nYou can find out where a specific application lives by typing which application_name into the terminal. E.g. which firefox will print /usr/bin/firefox (if you're using firefox from the Ubuntu packages).\n\nA: You can also try this if you're looking for the executable from a package name:\ndpkg -L firefox\n\nThis will list all files owned by firefox. To get the executables, pass it through further processing\ndpkg -L firefox | while IFS=$'\\n' read -r line; do\n    [[ -x \"${line#*:}\" ]] && echo \"$line\"\ndone\n\n", "Q: How to keep processes running after ending ssh session? Let's say I launch a bunch of processes from a ssh session. Is it possible to terminate the ssh session while keeping those processes running on the remote machine?\n\nA: I was stuck in a large mv so I wasn't in a position to stop the process, setup screen and then start it again. I managed to exit the SSH session with the process running by essentially doing the following steps:\n\n*\n\n*Establish SSH connection: ssh user@host\n\n*Run the desired command to start the process\n\n*Press Ctrl+Z to pause the process\n\n*Run bg to put the paused process in the background and resume it.\n\n*Run disown [pid] (process ID is optional, defaults to last process) to disown the process. To get a list of jobs simply type jobs before.\n\n*Exit the SSH session by running logout.\n\nUsage of the disown command:\ndisown [-ar] [-h] [jobspec ... | pid ... ]\n              Without  options,  remove  each jobspec from the table of active\n              jobs.  If jobspec is not present, and neither the -a nor the  -r\n              option  is  supplied, the current job is used.  If the -h option\n              is given, each jobspec is not removed from  the  table,  but  is\n              marked  so  that  SIGHUP  is  not  sent  to the job if the shell\n              receives a SIGHUP.  If no jobspec is  supplied,  the  -a  option\n              means  to  remove or mark all jobs; the -r option without a job‐\n              spec argument restricts operation to running jobs.   The  return\n              value is 0 unless a jobspec does not specify a valid job.\n\n\nA: Hey, while I agreed that screen is the most efective option.\nYou can use vncserver and then start the process on it.\nAlso if your only interes is to have the process running and no need to take control back of it, and utterly most important you were not aware you will need to close the session and you have the process already running, you are not of luck if you used bash as the shell\nFirst you need to send the process to background by typing Ctrl+Z followed by bg %1 (the number depends on the job number, usually it is 1, but you can easily pull the list using the command jobs)\nFinally invoke the command disown (followed by the jobid ... same as with bg command)\nThis will remove the parent-child relationship between your shell and the process in background, preventing it to die when your shell is terminated.\n\nA: Option 1: nohup\nThe best way is often the simplest.\nnohup long-running-command &\n\nIt was made specifically for this, it even logs stdout to nohup.log.\nman nohup\n\nOption 2: bg + disown\nCtrl+Z followed by:\nbg\ndisown -h\n\nIf you want to \"background\" already running tasks, then Ctrl+Z then run bg to put your most recent suspended task to background, allowing it to continue running. disown will keep the process running after you log out. The -h flag prevents hangup.\n\nscreen and others can do it, but that's not what they're for. I recommend nohup for tasks you know you are going to leave behind and bg for tasks you're already running and don't want to re-start.\nKeep in mind, both are bash specific. If you're not using bash, then the commands could be different.\n\nA: The easiest way is to run your command in the background with &. Then just write:\ndisown -a\n\n\nA: You should check out GNU Screen and see if it helps you. Depending on how you need you application to run in realtime, it may cause more issues than it solves, but at least it will allow you to resume your session as if you never left it.\nHow to use :\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the command screen for the first start, scroll through the introduction messages, you should be handed a terminal.\n\n*C-a C-c opens another terminal\n\n*C-a C-k kills a terminal\n\n*You can use C-a C-Space and C-a C-Backspace to cycle through terminals\n\n*C-a C-a is handy if you're mostly using only two terminals\n\n*C-a C-d detachs the current screen session and exits screens. You can then use screen -r to resume that session. You can have several detached screen sessions at once, in this case you'll be displayed a list of available sessions.\n\n\nThere are many other options, for example split screens, and also all shortcuts are fully customizable.\n\nA: Simplest answer...\nctrl+z will suspend the running program\n\"bg\" will run it in the background\n\nA: There are two major programs you can use to maintain programs and terminal state over multiple ssh connections. They are screen (the incumbent, but unfortunately unmaintained. Apparently being actively developed now) and tmux (newer, actively maintained). Byobu is a front end that can run on top of their of these systems and offer additional ubuntu status information. On new installations it will use tmux as a backend, if you have an older installation of byobu and an existing config it will maintain the previous backend, be it screen or tmux.\nByobu\nByobu can be installed on the computer by doing so in a Debian-based machine:\nsudo aptitude install byobu\n\nUsing yum, you do\nsu -c 'yum install byobu'\n\nIt's also possible to install byobu on other distributions.\nUsing byobu\nYou can start byobu by running byobu on the host machine after connecting using ssh.\nThis will give you a shell that looks like this:\n\nYou can also use Byobu Terminal on a Ubuntu machine with -X option and easily have a perfectly working byobu.\nUsage:\nStart byobu by typing byobu.\nYou can press F2 to create a new window within the current session, F3-F4 to switch between the various windows.\nThe best part about byobu is, you dont have to actually kill the processes running in the terminal to leave the terminal. You can simply send screen/tmux (the skeleton of byobu) to background and resume the next time you come:\n\n*\n\n*To leave byobu and keeep it running (detach) press F6.\n\n\n*The next time you come, just do byobu and you sholud be back right where you were.\n\nYou can also create various byobu sessions by byobu -S session1 and so on. And you can connect to either of them when you come back.\nYou can do much more using Byobu. Use it!\nSome definitive guides are here, or here.\n\nA: You could do that by using screen.\nType man screen to find out more or read this screen man page.\nSimple scenario:\n\n*\n\n*ssh into your remote box. Type screen. Then start the process you want.\n\n\n*Press Ctrl+A, then Ctrl+D. This will \"detach\" your screen session, but leave your processes running. You can now log out of the remote box.\n\n\n*If you want to come back later, log on again and type screen -r This will \"resume\" your screen session and you can see the output of your process.\n\nA: You cannot do this once the process has started, you need to have set things up before you run a long running job.\nYou can use nohup but modern wisdom suggests you use screen or byobu as your login so you can detach and leave things running. \nScreen has the advantage that you can detach from one machine and reattach from another which is handy if you want to check on long running processes that run beyond the end of the working day.\nThere is a reasonable getting started guide to screen here.\nbyobu puts an easy to use interface on top of screen with menus etc. It's also the current implementation of screen on newer ubuntu. F2 to start a new terminal F3/F4 to toggle back and forth and F6 to disconnect. Type exit to actually end terminals permanently.\n\nA: For a single shell script that I have running over a long period of time, I will login, and run the process in the background using '&'.\nExample:\n/path/to/my/script &\n\nI've logged out and disconnected my SSH session. When I log in some time later, the script is still executing as proven by continuous data collection from the script. \n\nA: You should look for modern alternatives like tmux.\ntmux is superior to screen for many reasons, here are just some examples:\n\n*\n\n*Windows can be moved between session and even linked to multiple sessions\n\n*Windows can be split horizontally and vertically into panes\n\n*Support for UTF-8 and 256 colour terminals\n\n*Sessions can be controlled from the shell without the need to enter a session\n\nBasic Functionality\nTo get the same functionality as explained in the answer recommending screen, you would need to do the following:\n\n*\n\n*ssh into the remote machine\n\n*start tmux by typing tmux into the shell\n\n*start the process you want inside the started tmux session\n\n*leave/detach the tmux session by typing Ctrl+b and then d\nYou can now safely log off from the remote machine, your process will keep running inside tmux. When you come back again and want to check the status of your process you can use tmux attach to attach to your tmux session.\nIf you want to have multiple sessions running side-by-side, you should name each session using Ctrl+b and $. You can get a list of the currently running sessions using tmux list-sessions or simply tmux ls, now attach to a running session with command tmux attach-session -t <session-name>.\ntmux can do much more advanced things than handle a single window in a single session. For more information have a look in man tmux or the tmux GitHub page. In particular, here's an FAQ about the main differences between screen and tmux.\n\nA: Screen and nohup is the better way, but if you have to detach a process already running without screen or nohup you can run disown command.\n\ndisown [-ar] [-h] [jobspec… |pid… ]\nWithout options, remove each jobspec from the table of active jobs. If the -h option is given, the job is not removed from the table, but is marked so that SIGHUP is not sent to the job if the shell receives a SIGHUP. If jobspec is not present, and neither the -a nor the -r option is supplied, the current job is used. If no jobspec is supplied, the -a option means to remove or mark all jobs; the -r option without a jobspec argument restricts operation to running jobs.\n\nWith disown you can close the terminal and get the process running on the machine.\n\nA: While everyone says to use disown (the only option you have after you already started the process), nohup, or even running the command in screen, which is useful if you want to see all the output from the command... I'm a fan of screen.. I still have tried most recent mainstream distributions of Linux and simply putting the job in the background and quitting does not cause all the processes that are running to die. There must be a global setting or something. I'm trying this on some pretty old systems (slackware 12) and my test script keeps running until I manually kill it:\nshell$ cat > test.pl\n\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nwhile(1){\n     sleep(1);\n}\n    shell$ perl ./test.pl &\n    shell$ exit\n    logout\n    shell$ ps aux test.pl\n    mymom 31337     1  0 13:25 ?        00:00:00 perl ./test.pl\n    shell$ \n\nWhile I agree that screen would be the best way to run this, even if my script wrote to log files or whatever.. I've never needed to use disown -a  or nohup unless it was out of complete paranoia. Maybe someone can shed some light on how bash behaves by default? Maybe some system administrators change the defaults on large shells to keep their users' processes from overloading the system? \n\nA: Instead of : \ncmd options; \n\nAdd before nohup : \nnohup cmd options & \n\nThen, you will be able to see the console stdout by : \ntail -f nohup.out\n\n", "Q: wine for games?

I have an ASUS Eee PC 901 that came with Windows XP installed on it.  \nDoes anyone know how to install Ubuntu on it?  Also does anyone know if Ubuntu would work on it?  Would it recognize the webcam, the microphone, etc?\nAlso, how do I reinstall Windows XP if something goes wrong?  Is it stored on a hidden partition?  It didn't come with any software CDs.\n\nA: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick should have what you need to install ubuntu.\nYour EEE should have a recovery partition, so if you want to keep that option you should take care when installing ubuntu not to overwrite it. If you do overwrite it, there are similar ways to create bootable usb-drives for windows, in case you need to revert later.\n\nA: I have an ASUS 900 and had to go through this when I wanted to get rid of the stock Linux that was installed on it. That was over two years ago. Back then, I was using a CDROM and a USB CDROM drive. The installation from a USB-based device is perhaps the only way you can perform an installation of Ubuntu or any other Linux distro.\nThe trick is to know how to boot from USB. On my 900, you need to press ESC when the first lines of text are displayed. You can then select where to boot from. It should be the same on your 901\nI would recommend using some desktop with Ubuntu Linux already installed. From the System menu, there is an option to make a Linux USB startup disk. I can't remember the actual option name. This will make a USB device (or an SD card) that can then be used to boot from . Once started, you will have an option to actually install the Ubuntu Linux. \nUNETBOOTIN is another solution to take any ISO and put it on a USB-based storage device so that it will boot from it just as if it was booting from an actual burned CDROM. From there, you can then install Linux. This second option lets you choose among manymore Linux distribution, should you choose to use another one. \nOn an ASUS 901, I would recommend to use the Ubuntu Netbook 10.10 distribution. You will likely experience a slow display, which can be avoided if you switch to the standard desktop. Installing the full regular desktop distribution is not recommended as it will be too slow for your computer. \n\nA: Just to complete answers: there is an option for booting over the network if BIOS can do that.\nHowever IMO installs over USB Stick/CD-ROM are much easier.\n", "Q: Nautilus keeps trying to access a folder that doesn't exist Whenever I boot into Ubuntu, as soon as I login, I get a dialogue window pop up that says Couldn't find \"/media/[long string here]\".

This is a full desktop remote access client. NX (www.nomachine.com) has both the server and the client software that can be installed. The server portion (along with the node portion and the client) can be installed on the server. You also need to install OpenSSH. Synaptics can do this for you. \nOnce the sevrer is installed, you can install the client only, on any any client computer. There are client for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. \nOnce the client is installed on the remote client, you start it, give your hostname/IP address and port (if not 22). Provide your user credentials, just as when you login locally. You are in business.\n\nA: Yes you can easily do that using VNC, what you have to do is set up the VNC server on Ubuntu, I think it just requires enabling it,  and then use a VNC client on the windows machine, Perhaps someone with more experience can expand a bit as I don't remember how to enable it, and am not on my Ubuntu machine at the moment... if I get to it before anyone else I will edit my answer.\n\nA: spooky, second question like this ive answered today:\nIs it possible to use remote desktop from Windows 7 to Ubuntu?\n", "Q: windows 7-like snap window maximize and vertical feature \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to emulate winkey+arrow Windows 7's maximise shortcut keys? \n\nIs there anything that provides functionality in gnome/compiz/ubuntu similar to Window 7's new snapping features?

I'm thinking this is a DNS resolution issue due to the 'waiting' or 'looking up' text being displayed in Firefox and Chrome.\nI do not get this issue with Slackware Linux or Windows 7 so it is not network or DNS server specific issue. It's something on the client side.\nLooking around on Google I see there are a few other people with this issue. The ones that have reported a workaround by switching to openDNS are disabling IPV6 or dealing with another issue.\nAny help would be appreciated.\nMy network card is wired:\nBroadcom Corporation NetLink BCM5906M Fast Ethernet PCI Express\nThanks\n\nA: The most common cause of page loading slowdown in browsers is due to ipv6, which comes enabled by default in Ubuntu. When it is enabled, it needs to timeout before ipv4 kicks in, which causes the delay when ipv6 is not supported by your network. There is a simple test that you can perform to verify if this is the issue - try to access a web page using the IP address. For example, try to open the following address:\nhttp://69.59.196.211:80\nIt should take you to Stack Overflow site. If the address responds quickly, then most likely that you have a DNS resolution issue due to ipv6.\nYou can disable ipv6 in Firefox,  by setting the network.dns.disableIPv6 preference to true.\n\n\n*\n\n*Type about:config in the address bar, press Enter.\n\n*Find network.dns.disableIPv6 in the list.\n\n*Right-click -> Toggle.\n\n*Restart Firefox and try again.\n\n\nYou can also disable ipv6 on the system level.

If you're seeing changes to configurations, perhaps the filesystem is not handling crashes very well (on a crash, it will just run a standard fsck). Try identifying which files are changing that are causing you the problem. (What commands do you run to save the settings, etc?)\nIf this is a public display system, you may want to investigate replacement hardware (crashing every few hours sounds like a more serious problem), or checking to see if whatever you're displaying is not leaking memory and triggering the Out-Of-Memory killer.

Ubuntu provides some good information on how to enable UFW and on how to enable IPv6 with miredo:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IPv6\nBut what is missing is information on how to properly configure UFW to let Miredo work, as as soon as I enable UFW IPv6 stops working:\n$ ufw disable\n$ ping6 ipv6.google.com\nPING ipv6.google.com(2a00:1450:8004::93) 56 data bytes\n64 bytes from 2a00:1450:8004::93: icmp_seq=1 ttl=56 time=1886 ms\n$ ufw enable\n$ ping6 ipv6.google.com\nPING ipv6.google.com(2a00:1450:8004::6a) 56 data bytes\nping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted\n\nSo how do I properly configure both Miredo and UFW together that basic IPv6 is working, but with all other incoming traffic being blocked?\n\nA: IPv6 is disabled by default in current released versions of ufw. To enable, edit /etc/default/ufw to have:\nIPv6=yes\n\nYou will also need to reload the ruleset. On newer releases of Ubuntu: \nsudo ufw reload\n\nOn older releases of Ubuntu, you can restart with:\nsudo /etc/init.d/ufw restart\n\n\nA: IPv6 support in UFW has to be explicitly enabled by editing /etc/default/ufw and changing IPv6=no to IPv6=yes.\n", "Q: Having permission problems with XAMPP I installed xampp with no problems, and then ran the command to set security. Apparently setting security locks you out of the directories even at the file system level, not just via FTP - when I look at the permissions tab of my htaccess folder, for example, the owner is set to the ftp username. I can FTP, but unfortunately no matter what I set my default remote directory to in my FTP program, it takes me inside my htdocs folder and won't let me go up one level.\nBecause this is a dev server installed on my local machine, I'd really like to be able to move files around at the file system level through my file manager, rather than having to FTP. How can I set the permissions on the folders in question, when my actual Linux username doesn't have write access to the folders? Is there some way I can do it in terminal with sudo? Does the sudo command override any permissions set on a folder or file that locks out the standard user?\n\nA: Simplest way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a folder in your home folder\ncalled webroot (it can be called\nanything you like, but webroot or www\nwould seem logical)\n\n*symlink the webroot folder in your\nhome directory to the location of\nyour xampp htdocs directory. sudo ln\n-s ~/webroot /path/to/xampp/htdocs\n\n*alternatively you can point the\ndocument root value (which i believe\nis found in httpd.conf - dont quote me\non that, i only use xampp on windows\nand it may be different on linux) to\npoint to the directory in your home\nfolder.\n\n\nYou can then use the folder in your home directory as you would any other directory, since its in your home folder, and owned and created by you there shouldn't be any permissions problems. This will act as if you were placing the files in htdocs, so you can run php etc. files as you normally would. Ill also state that personally i use the lamp server available from the tasksel command, as i found theres generally more help available for this.\n\nA: There's a lot of things that could affect this. I suspect that the ftp configuration is (rightly) restricting access.

I want it to blend, if i hit the dropdown above the sidepane and select information, this blends with the navigation toolbars. I'd like that same effect for the Places option.\n\nA: Edit your existing ~/.gtkrc-2.0 file, or create one if it doesn't exist. This file will let you override parts of your selected GTK+ theme.\ngedit ~/.gtkrc-2.0\n\nAdd the following style\nstyle \"treeview-modified\"\n{   \n    GtkTreeView::even_row_color   = \"#yourcolor\"\n}\nwidget \"*NautilusNavigationWindow*\" style \"treeview-modified\"\n\nwhere \"#yourcolor\" is obviously the color you want; #F2F1F0 is the Ambiance / Radiance toolbar color that you may be looking to blend with. You can sample other colors using Agave, the GIMP color picker or any color picker tool.\nNote that due to the side pane having a frame in all modes except \"Information\", it will not exactly blend in other modes the way it does in that mode; at least with the default themes. With some further hacking you may be able to work around the outline color and get it to blend exactly the same way if that's what you want.\nYou can find out more about theme styles in the GTK Theming Tutorial.\n\nA: Actually the way that is described in this answer will not only color your Nautilus Side Panel but it will also change the colors in the List View on the main Nautilus File Manager Window. In order to avoid it you would have to do something like this.\nstyle \"nautilus-sidebar\"\n{\n    GtkWidget::separator-height = 1\n    GtkTreeView::horizontal-separator = 4 # add extra the padding\n    GtkTreeView::vertical-separator = 1\n        GtkTreeView::even_row_color   = \"#E1EAEE\" #this is the color MAC OSX 10.5 uses\n}\nwidget_class \"*Nautilus*Side*.GtkWidget\" style \"nautilus-sidebar\"\n\nHowever the drawback on doing it this way is that it makes the background color of your Save, Import, Export dialog pop-up boxes have the same Side Panel Background(It does not look too bad). I think it has to do with the fact that we both used the \"even_row_color\". \nI tried using GtkTreeView   = \"#E1EAEE\" but it does not seem to work.\n", "Q: Poor boot-screen after interrupted install My install was interrupted because of a power cut.

However, I consistently get a \"Permission Denied\" error.\nI am using /home/kent/.gvfs/share on server/path/to/container as the path. I have tried mounting with the default options, mounting as read-only, and mounting to a specific directory. I get the same error regardless.\nIf I copy the container to my local Ubuntu machine then I can mount it and access it without issue. On a Windows desktop, I can mount it over the network without issue.\nHow can I mount this container from Ubuntu over my network?\n\nA: .gvfs is a virtual mountpoint not owned by your login user (hence you don't have write-access to it). You will need to set up a mount point manually, e.g.\n$ sudo mount -t cifs //server/share /mnt -o username=windowsuser,password=windowspassword\n\nOnce you have this you can mount the volume from there (in this example, /mnt) and it should work as expected.\n\nA: I posted this answer in the Ubuntu forum, but since I found the unanswered question here as well, I've more or less copied the same answer here...\nActually the solution couldn't be simpler. You just need to add an option to the \"mount\" command:\nuid={local username}\nThe complete command (in the case of CIFS/SMB) being:\nsudo mount -t cifs //{host}/*{share}* {local mount point} -o user={remote username},uid={local username}\nNote: Without specifying the password as an option (always a good idea to avoid plaintexting your passwords and/or in a way that bash history collects, IMO), this command would then prompt you for the remote password (after first prompting you for the sudo password of course).\nAll this does is mounts the share in a way that you (the user) can read and write to. Then, TrueCrypt (or EncFS or some other FUSE module) has no problem accessing an encrypted volume stored on that share (assuming no other issues of course).\nI don't know why this isn't widely discussed on the internets. I had to dig through the mount man page to discover this, after a fruitless internet search to this particular problem.\nThis is also not a hack or workaround. It's how mount was designed to work.\nI should also point out that the previous solution discussed here is potentially dangerous, as it obviates the user-based security built-in to FUSE, and that TrueCrypt (and other FUSE modules such as EncFS) rely on: That is, by default only the current user can see the mounted volume! Modifying /etc/fuse.conf to add \"user_allow_other\", and specifying \"allow_other\" on the command line, overrides this behavior and allows any user to see your decrypted data.\nIf you've encrypted your data in the first place, there's a fairly good chance you wouldn't want this side effect.\n\nA: Try adding \"user_allow_other\" to /etc/fuse.conf, and mounting with the \"allow_other\" option.\n\nA: I would also try to mount it with smbfs, using : \nmkdir /mnt/share\nmount -t smbfs \\\\\\\\192.168.1.10\\\\shared_folder /mnt/share -o username=your_username\n\n\nA: Truecrypt is based on FUSE - which is a user-space filesystem. In short: only the user has permissive rights to access the mounted volume. \nIn order to make SMB e. g. access the folder you have to avoid the daemon's capabilities of permission settings with a default mask on file-creation events:\nforce create mode 770\n\nMake sure you export the volume on Windows accordingly: the mount point Truecrypt uses on Windows is also user-specific. That means your ActiveDirectory Daemon or whatever you chose, running as SYSTEM e. g., needs permissive rights in order to access the mount-point: perform a right-click on Windows, set the permissions, and remount the TC container. This should solve the issues from both sides ;)\n", "Q: Make W7 install as small as possible and increase Ubuntu size How do I do this all from Ubuntu? When I used Wubi there was a max size, and i ended up liking Ubuntu 10.04 so I kept it installed, but now i want to do just run W7 as a VM. I have around only 58GBs used and around 100GBs free, how can i move the 100GBs of just free space to Ubuntu with GParted or any other software?\nAlso, i've tried decreasing the size of the partion in W7 with 3rd party software as well as the included one, but both can't decrease it at all for some reason. Apparently it's some hidden fragmented file that the defrag and partition editors can't get too, thats why im asking how to do it all from Ubuntu...\n\nA: This is because of the way WUBI works. WUBI is basically just a very big windows image file that can be removed just like any other program. It has no access to windows file system which is why you cant modify the partitions. (I bet you cant access any of your other windows 7 files?)\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall Wubi via the normal windows 7 uninstall process (making sure to back up any files you want to keep from your linux install)\n\n*If you want to dual boot (run windows and ubuntu side by side) use the windows disk management tool to create a big enough partition for your linux install\n\n*ensure you have install discs for\nwindows 7, many manufacturers supply\nonly repair discs meant to rescue a\ncorrupted partition, these wont allow you to install windows 7 on your vm.\n\n*burn a copy of ubuntu to a dvd\n\n*Backup absolutely anything you might\nneed in the future\n\n*check everything has backed up correctly\n\n*check your backup again (its quite important, you might have noticed)\n\n*set your bios to boot from your cd\ndrive, theres far too much variance\nbios setups to explain how to do\nthis, but it will be an option worded\nsomething along the lines of boot\norder\n\n*insert the ubuntu dvd\n\n*Think carefully, the next process\nwill format your hard drive, youll\nlose everything thats on it\n\n*when the menu comes up select the install option you want: Use the entire hard drive will install linux on the selected drive, completely formatting it\n\n*if you select specify partitions manually and choose the partition you created earlier you will be able to install both os's side by side.\n\n\nthere is an online guide that details the entire process here:\n\nA: For installing 7 in a VM you most likely want to get rid of unwanted components, e.g. with RTSe7enLite (running on Windows only)\nFor Ubuntu as your primary OS, it is better to install Ubuntu outside Wubi. Next step would then be setting up your VM within Ubuntu.\nDon't forget to backup before you start!\n\nA: You want to change of running Windows 7 directly with Ubuntu running in a Wubi container to running Ubuntu directly with Windows 7 running in a VM.  The more straighforward and safe way is a backup, format and reinstall, as in richzilla answer.  The more convoluted way is to make space, install linux, create a new VM for Windows, and migrate all your data.\nThe problem is that windows can't reduce the partition size because some files (probably ntfs own metadata) are in the way.  You can't move data when it is in use.  Ubuntu can't modify the partition when booted from wubi as Ubuntu itfself is using the filesystem.\nThe best way is to use a liveCD with gparted to reduce the partition size.  It will move the data, and create new partitions as needed.  It's very important to have a recent and verified backup of all your data.  Remember that your wubi container is also in that filesystem.\nThen you could do a new install of Ubuntu, move all your data out of the wubi container and uninstall wubi, freeing that space .  W7 would be accesible by dual boot.  If that is an aceptable outcome you can stop there, and probably should.  \nThere are tools to convert a Windows install into a VHD container but it is designed to run in MS Virtual PC, Virtualbox can run a machine using a VHD but the change in simulated hardware means that windows will most probably not work.  The best bet is a new install and migrating the windows data.\n", "Q: USB to VGA video adapter I'm having a hard time finding reliable info on this subject, but I'm looking for a usb to vga ( or dvi ) adapter for a Ubuntu 10.10 installation on a laptop.\nI'm currently using the regular vga external port of my laptop so I have a dual video output but I'd like to a third monitor attached to this setup.\nNote: The 2 monitor that I've got are wide resolution so the dualhead2go is not giving me enough workspace making the resolution really poor and uncomfortable.\nThanks for your comments,\nPhil \n\nA: I can't point you to a device that definitely works but a lot of them use chipsets that are compatible with the (in Ubuntu included) module sisusbvga.\nYou can read more about it (including example companies and chipsets) HERE.\nBasically you need to sudo modprobe sisusbvga and then it should work after editing your xorg.conf to tell your linux how to treat the new device.\n", "Q: Modify Monitor Color Profiles / Settings I can't seem to find this anywhere but every other OS has this...\nHow can I just modify the color settings on my monitor, e.g. white balance, gamma, etc?\nAlso, just in case, i'm on a Lenovo ThinkPad.\nHere is my graphics card specs:\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 02) \n\n\nA: GNOME Color Manager can help with device profiles.

So for example, you can see all the packages that provide input.h in maverick at http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?searchon=contents&keywords=input.h&mode=exactfilename&suite=maverick .\nAlternatively, you can use the archive provided contents file in http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/RELEASE/Contents-ARCH.gz , replacing RELEASE with the release (e.g. lucid, maverick) and ARCH (i386, amd64). Within that, you can search for the specific file and get the package from that.\nIf you know the file came from a package that's currently installed, you can use 'dpkg -S FILE' to find out what package and where the file is located.\n", "Q: What to do when keyserver.ubuntu.com is down?

Looking for setup steps for gitosis after installing from apt-get.\n\nA: *\n\n*apt-get install gitosis\na. The gitosis repo directory is: /srv/gitosis\nb. The gitosis user is auto created and named: gitosis\n\n*Init gitosis with your public key: \nsudo -H -u git gitosis-init < id_rsa.pub\n\n*Now you can clone to your local repo:\ngit clone gitosis@[SERVER]:gitosis-admin.git\n\nA: If I remember correctly, Progit has an excellent chapter on that one.\n\nA: I suggest looking into this page. It gives clear instructions about how to do the setup for Debian based (like ubuntu) systems. \nFirst you create a new repository, then you check that out using the git client. This check out can be used to configure the server. But that is all very nicely explained on that page.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Ok, so apt-get install gitosis should have created a new user on your system called \"gitosis\". Gitosis works by creating an admin repository in this users home folder, and to administrate git you clone that repository, make the changes you want and then push the changes back to the original repo.\nTo make gitosis create the admin repo, you probably need to create an ssh key pair and tell gitosis to use it for user authentication. Try ssh-keygen -t rsa to create the key pair and copy the public part (id_rsa.pub) to a folder on the server that the gitosis user has read access to (/tmp should work). After that you can run sudo -H -u gitosis gitosis-init < /tmp/id_rsa.pub to make gitosis initialize the admin repository.\nWhen the admin repository has been created, you use the private part of the previously generated ssh (most probably called \"id_rsa\") key pair to authenticate your git client when cloning the admin repo.\nTo clone the admin repo, the following command can be used git clone git@[servername]:gitosis-admin.git. \nNow you can add the public keys for anybody that is supposed to have access to the git repositories to the admin repository.\n", "Q: Tablet PC hardware for Ubuntu/Linux?

I am looking to put together a new desktop computer. For the last couple of years I have been using a  DELL laptop plus an external screen using Twin View and this has worked nicely.\nNow I would like to move to a desktop with a 3 screen setup using 1 video card. Is this possible, if so what would be the best hardware (video card) to use?\nIf its not possible I can stick with a dual screen setup, but again my questions holds, what video cards would be recommended?\nOne caveat. I am a hardcore addict with compiz fusion. I can't live without out it So the setup has to work with compiz fusion.\nAny input is greatly appreciated!\n\nA: For a new desktop computer you would want an Eyefinity enabled video card.\nI personally use an XFX HD 5870.\nMost, if not all, video cards that support three monitors will require either one monitor to have a Display Port (read: Very expensive monitor) or you to buy an active display port adapter. Those run around $90. Passive ones will not work.\nSo yeah. What you're looking for is an Eyefinity enabled ATI video card. Even the ones with two DVI ports, one HDMI port, and one DisplayPort will require one of your monitors to be hooked up to the display port because it can't pull power from the 3 others at the same time.\nEDIT: Also, any of these cards should be beyond powerful enough to support Compiz.\n\nA: Unfortunately, there are no triple-head video cards for notebooks that I know of. What you could do is purchase a DisplayLink based monitor for the third screen as they have a built-in video card. Compiz would not work on that display, but you could probably keep it on the other two.\n", "Q: Panel Background color, Transparency and background image don't work with Ambiance theme As the title suggests.

This carries over through restart.\nAlso you cannot resize the panel in Ambiance above 24 pixels as the background image doesn't scale.\nAm I doing something wrong, is it a bug or is it meant to be like that?\nI really like Ambiance, but am having a hard time using it because of these issues\nEdit: It seems these issues carry over to Radiance and New Wave as well\n\nA: This is indeed a bug with a current bug report: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/664794\nClick up at the top and mark this bug as affecting you as well.\nThe problem isn't just the Theme Ambiance, it is actually the \"Controls\" Ambiance. Clicking \"Customize\" and changing \"Controls\" to another one should fix this, while changing the \"Controls\" for any other them to Ambiance will cause this bug as well.\n\nA: It looks like that because the Ambiance theme uses images for the panel applets and background. Changing the preferences of the panel only changes the background theme and not the applet theme.\nYou can fix this by commenting out or removing the include \"apps/gnome-panel.rc\" line in /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc.\n\nA: a better way is to do the following\nedit file \n/usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc\ncomment out the line by adding a single # in front of the line.\n       bg_pixmap[NORMAL] = \"panel_bg.png\"\neffectively the line becomes\n#       bg_pixmap[NORMAL] = \"panel_bg.png\"\nthat removes the panel background.\n\nA: If you've got more than one user on the computer, and some of them don't use transparency and like the gradient, you can make a copy of Ambiance for yourself and modify the panel controller for yourself.\nTo start, copy ambiance sudo cp -r /usr/share/themes/Ambiance ~/.themes \nNext go into your copy of ambiance and modify the gnome panel:\nsudo gedit ~/.themes/Ambiance/gtk-32.0/apps/gnome-panel.rc\nIn gedit, the 10th line reads bg_pixmap[NORMAL] = \"img/panel.png\". Change this so that the line is commented out #bg_pixmap[NORMAL] = \"img/panel.png\".\nThe reason you only comment it out is so that if you ever want to go back to using it, you can without looking up anything else.\nYou now have the ability to have a panel of any height you want without any stylistic repercussions, and transparencies should work.\n", "Q: Optical Character Recognition software recommendations? I have seen some ebooks/papers that were apparently scanned from their paper versions but the text in the ebooks/papers can amazingly be copied out. I suppose the directly-scanned versions must have been processed by some Optical Character Recognition software. \nSo I would like to know what are the recommended Optical Character Recognition softwares? Especially those that are either for Ubuntu or free?

It's recently undergone many updates to the engine and has become one of the most comprehensive OCR tools on the market. Outscoring against most all other OCR tools (with something in the higher 90 percentile of text matches) it can easily transform standard document type-face to text.\nThe following is an example:\ntesseract ScannedDocument.png out\n\nWill produce a file called out.txt\n\nA: Adobe Acrobat (not reader, not a free application) is capable of OCR-ing a scanned PDF document and adding an invisible text layer on top of the image, so that the text could be selected and copied. Unfortunately I don't have it handy to check where exactly that feature is located in Acrobat's UI, but I've been successfully using it couple of times for the same purpose as you mentioned. \nAnd yes, this is a Windows software, not Linux one, but according to Wine HQ application database, it works under Wine.\n\nA: The best OCR software is usually embedded in printers/scaners/copiers. The Canon IRC 3880 in my office can output great OCR'd pdfs easier and faster than any desktop program that I know. Put the book on the tray (unbound), select your mail address, press the green button.\nMost of the OCR's pdf that you can find on the net come for similar machines.

I've created some packs of svg flag icons for the language indicator menu. I'm expanding it now, and have had a request for a flag for the \"Latin American\" layout of Spanish. But I can't figure out what two-character filename is linked to that layout. It's not ES (for spanish) and this list of language codes doesn't seem to include anything that fits. Does anyone know what the two-character code is for the Latin American layout?\n(If you're interested, the flag packs are posted on Gnome Look: seperately for dark panels and for light panels). \n\nA: ES\nThere is not one-to-one correlation between languages, countries, and keyboard layouts.\nSome languages are associated with multiple keyboard layouts, e.g. English: USA and United Kingdom. Some keyboard layouts are associated with multiple languages, e.g. Kazakhstan: Kazakh and Russian. Many keyboard layouts are associated with multiple countries, e.g. Latin American…\nThe Latin American (latam) keyboard layout is associated with all of the following countries:\n\n\n*\n\n*AR, BO, CL, CO, CR, CU, DO, EC, GT, HN, HT, MX, NI, PA, PE, PR, PY, SV, US, UY, VE\nand the following languages:\n\n\n*\n\n*spa\nSo in this case, you are lucky. Latin American is only associated with one language. \"es\" is your two-letter language code.\nThat aside, I would recommend against using language codes to indicate keyboard layouts. There is a separate system already in place for abbreviating the names of the layouts themselves. See shortDescription in xkb-data's base.xml.\n\nA: From the base.xml \"source\" file:\n    <name>latam</name>\n\nI suspect that's what you need.\n\nA: There are two distinctive things here: \nLanguages (and codes for them). \nLanguage codes have some international standards as monotasker referenced. There's no such thing in these standards as \"Latin American\" or something similar, because there is no such a language. Apart from Brazilian Portugese, Latin Americans speak some variation(s) of Spanish, and the code for Spanish as a language is clear. \nKeyboard layouts (and codes for them). \nOn the other hand, when talking about keyboard layouts, I highly suspect that there's no international standard code for them. Operating systems, distros and even some applications, prefer something of their choice as far as I can see. Mostly they are similar to the language codes, but for the variants, naming varies to taste, to some extent. To see what GNOME, Ubuntu or the default applications we use prefer as an abbreviation for Latin American keyboard layout, I added it to my Ubuntu 10.10 via System -> Preferences >- Keyboard -> Layout -> Add > By country via Argaetina or by language via Spanish lets say > Latin American. Then the Indicator Applet appeared on the GNOME Panel and it prefers the abbreviation LAm for the Latin American layout.

I have a library of music over 24,000 tracks all MP3's.\nRhythmbox sees 11,500 of them only.\nThis has been a problem for a while. I keep coming back to Rhythmbox as its integration with Ubuntu is so tight and I like that. But this problem is stopping me from using it.\nI have tried Banshee, but the sound quality is tinny and horrible (hearing rumors of Banshee replacing Rhythmbox in 11.04 is giving me nightmares)\nI used to use Songbird but it was always a bit buggy and they have now pulled Linux Support.\nExaile doesn't integrate well enough either. I tried Guaydeque, and it shows a lot of promise, but again its integration is horrible.\nIs there a way to make Rhythmbox see all my MP3's or is there a music player with tight integration, great sound, good features, Gnome native and actively developed I can switch to?\nEdit: I remember hearing somewhere it had to do with MP3 with variable bit rate?\nEdit: answers to various comments:\nTook a look and I can't see anything specifically the same about all the files that is different from the files it does see. But we are talking about over 10,000 files missing, to large a number for me to be able to draw any accurate conclusions in any timely fashion.\nNot getting any error messages. All I did was set my music library folder to be the folder in Preferences and ticked the box to watch the library for new files. It works fine with every other media player I have tried, but every time I try Rhythmbox (several times now over the last couple of years) it fails to get a the majority of my tracks.\nMy files are all on one external drive in one folder which than has subfolders for each artists and sub folders in those for each album. But that's as far as it goes for multiple locations, ie its not really multiple locations and no symbolic links.\nThis has been happening across several clean installs across several version of Ubuntu. \n\nA: There are two elements to Rhythmbox noticing files: the inotify watches on all the subdirectories (which may have hit a maximum, check /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches, but it should be very high, higher than the number of directories you probably have), and the other is the file type detection that GStreamer is seeing.\nTry to see if there are differences from GStreamer's perspective of the file. You can use gst-typefind to do this. A report like this may be useful to help track it down:\nfind /path/to/files -type f -print0 | xargs -0 gst-typefind\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem with Rhythmbox. I don't have nearly the number of files you have, but it was not seeing new files or changed files. I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Preferences --> Music, I unchecked \"Watch my Library for new files\".\n\n*Completely closed Rhythmbox (important).\n\n*Renamed the rhythmbox database - ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/rhythmdb.xml\n\n*Started up Rhythmbox and checked \"Watch my Library for new files\".\n\n*It started checking my collection and found everything.\n\n\nIt seems that my problem was an issue with the configuration file. I had reinstalled Rhythmbox, but had not done a complete uninstall. This left a corrupted configuration file in my Rhythmbox sub-directory. You may want to try this if it's possible that you have a corrupted configuration file.\n\nA: It is possible that using a symbolic link or using multiple locations could be \"confusing\" Rhythmbox.  I've got around 10.000 songs and they are all present and accounted for.  But they weren't all there until I used the absolute paths to the files.  That's the worst thing about Rhythmbox - no file browser.\nAs a side note, I don't know how you store your music, but you can set multiple library locations with the gconf-editor under apps --> Rhythmbox --> library_locations.\nTo see if the files are the problem rather than Rhythmbox being the issue check out the File Browser plugin.  It won't let you browser your entire file system, but it will let you browser your configured music directory by file rather than relying on Rhythmbox to read the tags.  You can find it here (w/instructions): http://www.webupd8.org/2010/09/folderview-rhythmbox-plugin-to-browse.html\nI don't see the point of this plugin personally, but I've tried it and it does work; in your case it would likely be useful.\nIf your looking for a good alternative with file browsing capability and so on, I've been using Clementine a lot.  It's easily my favorite Linux player (but I still use Rhythmbox too!).  You can check it out here: http://code.google.com/p/clementine-player/\n\nA: For me the answer was to close Rhythmbox and run the following (Xenial):\napt install gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad\nrm ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/rhythmdb.xml\n\nThis installs some additional GStreamer plugins (also try gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly) and then deletes the Rhythmbox music database so it will re-check the files the next time.\n", "Q: Can I call the GNOME restart confirmation prompt from the command line?

To make sure all partitions are unmounted for which this is possible, you can use xargs -n1 to call the umount command for each partition seperately.\n\n*Sometimes umount fails because a partition is “busy”, but really it's not. The -l option makes sure the drive is unmounted as soon as it's safe to do so.\n\n\nA: If you know the device file, say /dev/sdb, you can unmount all partitions of the device with the command:\nsudo umount /dev/sdb?*\nThe command sudo umount -a should be avoided, because it would unmount also partitions you do not want to unmount at that moment.\nBy the way, I think that the gnome right click menu item \"Safely remove\" is the graphical best way to operate.\n\nA: The command sudo umount -a will unmount them all.\n", "Q: Fonts in message area too small to read in Thunderbird I use Thunderbird as my email client.

The next time you turn it will be exactly as you left.\n\nA: The current believe is that the proper session saving/restoring feature is to use either suspend or hibernate. I agree though that hibernate and suspend can be a pain to get working if they did not out of the box ...\nBut have a look at ...\nCryoPID\n\nCryoPID allows you to capture the state of a running process in Linux and save it to a file. This file can then be used to resume the process later on, either after a reboot or even on another machine.\nCryoPID was spawned out of a discussion on the Software suspend mailing list about the complexities of suspending and resuming individual processes.\nCryoPID consists of a program called freeze that captures the state of a running process and writes it into a file. The file is self-executing and self-extracting, so to resume a process, you simply run that file. See the table below for more details on what is supported.\n\nFeatures\n\n*\n\n*Can run as an ordinary user! (no root privileges needed)\n\n*Works on both 2.4 and 2.6.\n\n*Works on x86 and AMD64.\n\n*Can start & stop a process multiple times\n\n*Can migrate processes between machines and between kernel versions (tested between 2.4 to 2.6 and 2.6 to 2.4).\n\nIt is not very well documented though and the last DEB released was for Heron and the website was last updated in 2005 so it might be useless. Here are the tarballs:\n\n*\n\n*i386 tarball\n\n*x86_64 tarball\nAnd also have a look at Tuxonice\n\nTuxOnIce is most easily described as the Linux equivalent of Windows' hibernate functionality, but better. It saves the contents of memory to disk and powers down. When the computer is started up again, it reloads the contents and the user can continue from where they left off. No documents need to be reloaded or applications reopened and the process is much faster than a normal shutdown and start up.\n\nppa:tuxonice/ppa \n\nThe PPA has precompiled Ubuntu kernels with TuxOnIce already compiled in, the userui binary and the hibernate script. So it might not be for the fainthearted.\n\nThere is one workaround that might be worth looking in to:\n\n*\n\n*Create a script that has all the programs you tend to open. Or create 2,3,4,5,6 of those scripts and bind a key to this script. Like control + alt + 1|2|3|4|5|6 or if that is in use something else. Hit the key and let the script open all the programs from that script.\n\n\n*And you can use something like this how to shift applications from workspace 1 to 2 using command to toss them onto another workspaces if you want them grouped.\nNot what you asked for but it seems we are deemed to look for workarounds :)\n\nA: 12.04\nAs a workaround you can re-enable hibernation in 12.04 and use it shut down your pc and then wake it up with all your application still in use.\nType in terminal :\n\nsudo gedit /var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/hibernate.pkla\n\nand then add this string to the text file :\n\n[Re-enable Hibernate]\n  Identity=unix-user:*\n  Action=org.freedesktop.upower.hibernate\n  ResultActive=yes\n\nThis way : \n\nThen hibernate option will be displayed again on shutdown menu :\n\nHope it will help.\n\nA: For 12.04 (and 11.10)\nThe short answer is: hibernation is the best option because the gnome-session-save functionality was removed after 11.04 since it was buggy, and the official tweak to manually re-enable this functionality does not appear to work. Part B of this answer describes how to use an alternative hibernation method, TuxOnIce, which is more compatible and reliable right now than the built-in hibernation.\nA. Trying to enable the old Gnome session saving functionality\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: as described at the end, this official tweak does not appear to work -- you may want to skip directly to B. Hibernation with TuxOnIce\n\n*This Launchpad bug discusses restoring the \"save session\" functionality. It is currently marked \"fixed\", because a patch was introduced in the gnome-session package in April 2012, allowing users to manually re-enable this functionality. The patch describes itself as:\n\n\n*\n\n*add GNOME_SESSION_SAVE environment variable for people wanting to\nuse the save session still, knowing that it can break your system\nif used unwisely (LP: #771896)\n\n\n*You can enable this by setting the GNOME_SESSION_SAVE variable to a non-null value. Here's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Alt+F2, type gedit ~/.pam_environment, and press enter.\n\n*Add the line GNOME_SESSION_SAVE=1 at the end of the file as shown below:\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl+S to save, and Ctrl+Q to quit the editor.\n\n*Now reboot (logout should also work, but just to be safe)\n\n\n*What the patch (source) does is disable the Options tab in Startup Applications, which used to contain the Remember running applications when logging out option. BUT it checks the GNOME_SESSION_SAVE variable, and if set (non-null), it should enable session-saving just as if the Remember... box existed and was checked. That's why the bug is labeled as \"fixed\"\n\n\n*\n\n*if (g_getenv (\"GNOME_SESSION_SAVE\") != NULL)\n                maybe_load_saved_session_apps (manager);\n\n*Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work, as confirmed by comment 32 in the bug tracker.\n\n*I even tried disabling the patch and rebuilding gnome-session from source. That makes the Options checkbox show up again, but it does nothing.\n\n*But hey, it may somehow work for you!! :)\n\n\n\n\nB. What works for now: Enhanced Hibernation with TuxOnIce\n\n\n*\n\n*Hibernation saves your current system state (including your session, applications open, etc.) to the hard disk, and shuts the computer down. When you start it again, it reads the saved state and restores it, just as if you had never turned the computer off. This technology is mostly used by laptop users to save on battery power, but there's no reason it can't be used on desktops as well.\n\n*Hibernation support is available in Ubuntu/Linux but was disabled in 12.04 because it wasn't working properly on a number of systems. See this question and this bugreport if you want more information.\nA more compatible alternative: TuxOnIce\n\n*TuxOnIce (wiki|homepage) is an alternative to the kernel's built-in hibernation technology, and is supposed to be more compatible, more reliable and more flexible.\n\n*It is easily installed, and if it doesn't work for you, as easily removed.\n\n*It does require installing TuxOnIce's custom kernel, but the instructions that follow should make it easy. If you've never opened the terminal before, you may want to now :-)\n0. Requirements\nThe only requirement for TuxOnIce is that your swap partition be at least as large as the amount of memory (RAM) you have. You can check this by:\n\n*Start the terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T\n\n*Type free -m, and you should see something like this:\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          1024        731        260          0          0        190\n-/+ buffers/cache:        540        451\nSwap:         1536          6       1530\n\n\n*The number after Swap: (e.g. 1536) should be more than the number after Mem: (e.g. 1024)\n\n*If this is not the case, and your swap is smaller than your memory, you must either resize and increase the size of your swap partition, or configure TuxOnIce to use a special swap file. That is beyond the scope of this answer, but if you ask another question and mention it in the comments, I will answer and explain how.\n1. Installing the TuxOnIce kernel\n\n*Start the terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T\n\n*Copy and paste the following into the terminal. This adds the TuxOnIce PPA and installs the custom kernel and headers.\n\n\n*\n\n*\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:tuxonice/ppa -y\n\nand once the ppa is added:\n\n*sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install tuxonice-userui linux-generic-tuxonice -y \nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic-tuxonice -y\n\n\n*Now reboot.\n\n*Ubuntu should now start up with the TuxOnIce kernel. If there are any problems, keep the Shift pressed at startup and you will get the Grub menu. Use the arrow keys to go to Previous Linux Versions, press enter, and press enter again to go back to the working kernel.\n2.

This file can then be used to resume the process later on, either after a reboot or even on another machine.\nCryoPID consists of a program called freeze that captures the state of a running process and writes it into a file. The file is self-executing and self-extracting, so to resume a process, you simply run that file. See the table below for more details on what is supported.\n\nFeatures\n\n\n*\n\n*Can run as an ordinary user! (no root privileges needed)\n\n*Works on both 2.4 and 2.6.\n\n*Works on x86 and AMD64.\n\n*Can start & stop a process multiple times\n\n*Can migrate processes between machines and between kernel versions (tested between 2.4 to 2.6 and 2.6 to 2.4).\n\n\nHere are the tarballs:\n\n\n*\n\n*i386 tarball \n\n*x86_64 tarball\n 2. Tuxonice probably this is your better bet and may work.\n\n\nTuxOnIce is most easily described as the Linux equivalent of Windows' hibernate functionality, but better. It saves the contents of memory to disk and powers down. When the computer is started up again, it reloads the contents and the user can continue from where they left off. No documents need to be reloaded or applications reopened and the process is much faster than a normal shutdown and start up.\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tuxonice/ppa\n\nThe PPA has precompiled Ubuntu kernels with TuxOnIce already compiled in, the userui binary and the hibernate script. So it might not be for the fainthearted.\n\nThere is one workaround that might be worth looking in to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a script that has all the programs you tend to open. Or create 2,3,4,5,6 of those scripts and bind a key to this script. Like control + alt + 1|2|3|4|5|6 or if that is in use something else. Hit the key and let the script open all the programs from that script.\n\n*And you can use something like this how to shift applications from workspace 1 to 2 using command to toss them onto another workspaces if you want them grouped. \nI am not allowed to copy someones answer, so source.\n", "Q: Start with interactive console shell This is a follow up question to my prior thread.\nThis solution works very well. However, after booting up, I only see a blinking cursor. Crtl+Alt+FX, where X=1..4 e.g. invokes a root Shell. I want this Shell to be there after the initial bootup, without having to invoke further keystrokes.\nProblem is: we have an \"automated keyboard\" controller that just types. If it doesn't have a shell, its input is lost :) \nI know that this is a very specific problem... so I'm extra happy for any answer I get.\nThanks in advance,\nwishi\n\nA: In your previous post you say \"I edited gdm.conf not to start.\".\nI think it can depend on how you modified that file, it is possible that you happen to go to the tty7 where gdm would start the X server, but without the X server started, so you have to change console to go to, say, tty1.\nIf you do not use it, it should be better to remove the gdm package.\n", "Q: How do I schedule waking up from hibernation? Is it possible to wake up Ubuntu from hibernation at a predefined time? It should not be WOL, but rather Ubuntu waking itself up. For example, it should do what the app WakeupOnStandBy does on MS Windows.\n\nA: I found that it is difficult to wakeup Ubuntu from hibernation. So I use the following commands to boot Ubuntu at a predefined time:\n# Clear previously set wakeup time \nsudo sh -c \"echo 0 > /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm\"\n\n# Set the wakeup time at 2:02 am\nsudo sh -c \"echo `date '+%s' -d '2am next day + 2 minutes'` > /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm\"\n\n#Check if alarm is set. It should show the unix time stamp\ncat /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm\n\n#After setting the time, PC can be turned off with this command\nsudo shutdown -P now \n\nThis setup has been very consistent and it has never failed. Auto-login should be enabled during Ubuntu installation for this to work, or else Ubuntu will wait at the login screen when it auto boots up. More info here.\n\nA: When hibernating, the operating system is off and can't do anything. It's the computer's BIOS that does the waking up, so it's only possible if your computer's BIOS supports it. With some BIOSes, you can configure a scheduled wakeup quite easily.\nPress the key that gets you into \"setup\" or similar when the computer first boots up (often F2 or Del) and see what options you have.\nAlternatively you may be able to configure the BIOS to wake from Ubuntu, if the BIOS supports waking and allows the OS access to configure it. This guide is quite comprehensive:\nhttp://www.mythtv.org/wiki/ACPI_Wakeup\n\nA: Since hibernation implies power-off I wonder if your BIOS supports automatically booting on power application. If so, you could cycle your power supply using an external timer or some other device.\n", "Q: How can I change the font size of KDE menus and dialogs...?

It features multi-docks, taskbar, launchers and a lot of useful applets. Applets can be detached from the dock to act as desktop widgets. Numerous ready-to-use themes are available in 1 click, and can be easily customized at your convenience. It can use hardware acceleration to be very fast and low on CPU.\nWeb Page and Launchpad\n\n\nA: SimDock\nThere is also SimDock which is in the Ubuntu Software Center. I believe SimDock is supposed to be a lighter-weight dock. But others seem to not like it as much as the others. Remember though whichever dock you use will most likely need compositing (either Compiz (Visual Effects) or Metacity Compositing turned on) to work and function correctly.\nEnjoy your dock :-)\n\nA: Wbar\n\nJust a simple and highly customizable quick-launch tool.\n\n\n\nA: Plank\nPlank is the default dock used by elementary OS, and it is also installable in Ubuntu. It is based on Docky, and is rewritten to use Vala instead of Mono, which could make it a great option to consider if for some reason you don't want Mono on your system.\nNote that Plank is currently still in development and is not available in the Ubuntu repositories yet. Thus, if you want to install it, you'll either have to add a testing PPA or compile the latest development build from source.

Sometimes when I put my laptop to hibernate, it's hanging and won't shut down. I have to force it off by pressing the powerbutton for 5 seconds.\nAfter I boot again, I can't connect to the internet. I have to logout, go to gnome, and after logging in, I rightclick the network applet icon and select the enable networking options. After that, my internet is working again.\nIs there a way to do this via the command line or another option? \n\nA: You can use nmcli (part of NM) or cnetworkmanager\nsudo apt-get install cnetworkmanager\n\nto control NetworkManager from the commandline.\nBTW: you can configure Monad to use a panel or such (but maybe that's not what you want).\n\nA: You can customise xmonad with status bar and tray apps for utilities like network-manager which need tray icons.\nThis guide, for example, details how to set up xmobar and trayer, among other things.\n\nA: I find after improper shutdowns that the /etc/NetworkManager/nm-system-settings.conf often has Managed=False set.  When you go into GNOME and hit that checkbox, all you're doing is toggling that to True.  You can do it with a text editor too.\n\nA: It sounds like you've killed the network-manager daemon. You can restart it by doing sudo service network-manager start.

I noticed that video performance on my Thinkpad X100e was very poor compared to Windows 7, so I installed the ATI fglrx proprietary drivers by using the \"Additional Drivers\" dialogue box. The system has an ATI Radeon Mobility HD 3200 chip.\nThe result of installing the drivers is pretty devastatingly negative, with symptoms such as skewed content in windows, browser tabs and text boxes failing to refresh when their content changes. In fact, please excuse typos in this post, because I can't really see what I am typing. :)\nI also notice that HD video playback performance is no better - perhaps even worse - than prior to installing the drivers.\nExample of what I see: \nHere's the output of fglrxinfo:\ndisplay: :0.0  screen: 0\nOpenGL vendor string: ATI Technologies Inc.\nOpenGL renderer string: ATI Radeon HD 3200 Graphics \nOpenGL version string: 3.3.10237 Compatibility Profile Context\n\nOutput of lspci | grep -i vga:\n01:05.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc RS780M/RS780MN [Radeon HD 3200 Graphics]\n\nI'm on Ubuntu 10.10 with kernel 2.6.35-22-generic-pae. \nWhat can I try?\nMany thanks,\n-R\n\nA: To revert back to the open source drivers it should be a simple matter of disabling the Proprietary Drivers in the Additional Drivers application. After that you will need to restart (or at least logout and log back in).\nAlso take a look here for a bunch of xorg.conf options to tweak the FGLRX drivers. If I were you I'd setup a xorg.conf which would a) allow you to easily swap between the closed source and open source drivers and b) allow you to tweak the drivers more. To do so take a look at the Ubuntu wiki\n\nA: Just do sudo aticonfig --initial after installing the the HD3200 driver and you're done.\n", "Q: Integrate Pidgin into the Me Menu, or help fix Empathy?

When I run \nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nover ssh, I get the following message.\n\nThis session appears to be running under ssh. It is not recommended\nto perform a upgrade over ssh currently because in case of failure it\nis harder to recover.\n\nIf you continue, an additional ssh daemon will be started at port\n'9004'.\nDo you want to continue?\n\nWhat is the real risk of upgrading over ssh?  How does the additional ssh daemon help mitigate this?\n\nA: What I would recommend doing is launching a screen session on the server and running the upgrade in screen - that way if your SSH session drops (for whatever reason) the upgrade process will not halt.\nScreen is a program that allows for persistent terminal(s) on a machine. So you can start a screen session and so long as the machine is on that screen session (and it's history, running programs, etc) will continue to operate though no one user is on the machine. It was designed in the early days to provide a multi-windowed text terminal prior to the days of X Server. You can install it using APT:\nsudo apt-get install screen\n\nSo you can ssh into your server, start screen, initiate the upgrade process and not have to worry about the upgrade bing botched because you've lost Internet connection or your computer crashed.\n\nA: I've never (yet) had a problem doing that, though I've only upgraded half a dozen or so boxes that way.  It is just that if something goes wrong the additional SSH daemon may be your only hope of avoiding a visit (or making use of whatever remote re-install options you have).\n\nA: If a new version of the ssh daemon is installed as part of the upgrade, the daemon will be restarted. If the update breaks the daemon for some reason, it would fail to start up again and you'd have no way of logging into the machine anymore.\nBy starting a separate sshd, which is not handled by the init system and thus won't be restarted during the upgrade, it is ensured that the old version of sshd will still be running even if the new version fails to start. Thus you can still log into the system and see what caused the daemon to break.\n\nA: @Marco-Ceppi 's solution is already integrated into do-release-upgrade.\nWhen you run do-release-upgrade it starts a screen session automatically. If your ssh session gets disconnected, you can resume the installation. All you have to do is open a new ssh session, and run do-release-upgrade again. It will reconnect to your previous installation. \nA second risk, pointed out by @sepp2k is that your sshd server might need to be upgraded, and it could perhaps not restart correctly. Therefore the upgrade program runs a second deamon, at the port specified. You should check your network configuration to make sure you have access through this port, before resuming.\nGood luck.\nMoreover, the screen-session do-release-upgrade starts by itself is run under the root account, so if your own screen-session crashes, you will be able to recover by running sudo screen -x, if (for some reason) the command do-release-upgrade doesn't recover it by itself, which seems to be common. \n", "Q: Is there such a thing as a restore point in Ubuntu? Windows has this. Basically what I want is to record the state of the system either manually or periodically and then restore to that point if required. For example, before upgrading the distribution, or before installing a certain package.\nWhat would be the easiest way to do this?\n\nA: There are different backup-utilities available, but the functionality of the \"Windows Restore System\" does not exist in that form (at least not that I know of) (since it's not really necessary see Footnote).\nIf you have a small system partition you can easily create an image of it using dd, saving it to disk and if necessary restore it.\ndd if=/dev/sdXX of=/media/backup/system.img bs=1M\n\nFootnote: I don't see the need for such functionality because there's no way to wreck the system by installing something as long as you stick to apt. Updated kernels might not boot or work correct, that's why the old ones are remaining (and can still be booted) until they're removed by hand. Of course you can still screw everything, but that's a lot harder to do.\n\nA: Time Shiftcan also do the same.\nsudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:teejee2008/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install timeshift\n\n\n\nA: You can also use a storage volume management system (e.g. LVM) or a filesystem (e.g. btrfs) that supports snapshots for this.\nAnd most virtualisation software also supports this in their \"disk files\" (e.g. the qcow/qcow2 format used in qemu).\n\nA: You can try Back in Time: \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:bit-team/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install backintime-qt4\n\nNote: GNOME/KDE UI has been deprecated, hence -qt4 now.

This will work and I get a clean kernel package that I can compile, but compilation can take up to 3 hours on my machine so I'd like to only rebuild what I need to and try to keep some of the *.o files around so I can just link them rather than recompile them.\nThanks\n\nA: Yes, you can remove the special stamp files debian/stamps/stamp-build-* before starting the next build (instead of the using the \"clean\" target). With certain changes, you may need to remove the debian/stamps/stamp-prepare-* files, too.\nWhen these stamp files do not exist, the build will attempt to reprocess those portions of the build for that stamp that is defined in the debian/rules file.\nIf you have multiple processors on your system, you can also parallelize your build by starting your command line with DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=parallel=N where N is the number of CPUs you have. (Some people suggest using the number of cpus plus 1.) Quick way to find number of CPUs (without counting them in /proc/cpufino) is to run the command getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN.\nFor example:\nDEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=parallel=$(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN) skipabi=true skipmodule=true fakeroot debian/rules binary-core2\n\n", "Q: How do I connect with my Verizon Mobile Broadband dongle? When I try and set up my mobile connection through the connection wizard it doesn't work at all. There is no indication that my computer even recognizes it. Any pointers? This is a Verizon dongle.\n\nA: You may need to install the usb-modeswitch package, if your Verizon device is a \"flip-flop\" device.\nA \"flip-flop\" device is one that initially appears as a CD-ROM device that contains Windows drivers for the device. This driver, when installed, sends a special command to the device to let it know that it can \"flip\" into modem mode.\nUsually these devices have no Linux drivers on them. The usb-modeswitch program sends the special command unconditionally, and lets Linux's built-in facilities talk to the modem.\n", "Q: How can I get the grub menu on boot? This is for a friend's Toshiba Portege laptop with Ubuntu 10.4.1 on it. They want the original Windows XP for tablet PC installed; they do have the disk, but the Portege seems unable to boot from a generic non-Toshiba USB CD drive (and the Toshiba one that came with it is broken for years now).\nSo I found out about plop. I followed the instructions (modified; I touched /etc/grub.d/40_custom or something) and now the executable '/boot/plpbt.bin' (I copied it there of course) is included as an option (I hope! I ran update-grub2 and update-grub and verified that the custom menu option exists in /boot/grub/grub.cfg).\nI cannot bring up the grub menu at boot; Esc unfortunately jumps to the Portege BIOS, and I haven't managed to succeed in getting grub to choose the Plop boot manager.\nHow can I bring up the grub menu on boot?\n\nA: You can bring up GRUB by pressing SHIFT during boot. If you want to permanently show grub, edit the respective options in /etc/default/grub.\n", "Q: How can I make Shutter open at startup? How can i make the application, Shutter (takes screenshots) open at startup? I know about sys > prefs > statup applications, but after I go to add what do I fill out the form with? Shutter isn't a command, is it?\n\nA: Actually, you answered the question yourself. Go to System -> Preferences -> Startup Applications and add a new item with \"Shutter\" (or something else) as the name and shutter as the command.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 10.04, 10.10 and 11.04\n\nYou can drag and drop the Shutter menu item (Applications ➜ Accessories ➜ Shutter) into\nthe Startup Applications window and it will be added to the list of applications that start on login.\n\n\nA: For the command, add shutter --min_at_startup to make it startup minimized.\n\nA: Ubuntu 11.10 and Above\n\nRefer to this Question, How do I add/remove the \"hidden\" startup applications? and specally to this answer to know how to access the startup applications\nThen click on ADD and type this command in the CUSTOM field:\n\nsh -c \"sleep 50 && shutter --min_at_startup &\"\n\nYou can change the time of the sleep if you want it to be launched earlier.\n\nA: I ended up creating bash script, because non of other solutions working for me.\ncd ~/.local/bin\n\nCreate file shut-ter-auto-launch with contents:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nprocess=shutter\nmakerun=\"shutter --min_at_startup\"\n\nwhile true\ndo\n  if ps ax | grep -v grep | grep $process\n  then\n    break\n  else\n    nohup $makerun &\n  fi\n  sleep 5\ndone\n\nexit\n\nAllow to execute it:\nchmod +x shut-ter-auto-launch\n\nUntick \"Launch at login\" option at Shutter preferences.\nAdd shut-ter-auto-launch to Startup Applications.\nShutter will launch after any other GUI app is launched.\n", "Q: How do I delete my last panel? The last panel on gnome is being a pain to delete.

I don't want any of them at the moment, just my dock.\n\nA: Open gconf-editor, in desktop/gnome/session/required_components change the panel value from gnome-panel to your dock of choice.\nRestart your session and your dock will be auto-started by gnome and re-spawned if needed.\nNote that you will lose some keyboard shortcuts like ALT+F2 if you remove your last panel, if you need them you should just hide it.\n\n\nA: I did that deleting the content of the panel property.\nOpen gconf-editor and then go to desktop->session->required_components.\nEdit the panel property and delete the content. Next time you login gnome-panel won't be loaded.\nTo undo just set the property back.\n", "Q: How to make Skype use notify-osd? How do I make Skype use the default Ubuntu notify-osd to display notifications (incoming messages, users connecting, etc.) instead of the Skype's own \"ugly\" message box?\n\nA: Another work-around: install Pidgin, make sure Pidgin has a Skype account, then everything will go directly to notify-osd. (Downside: you have to then have both Pidgin and Skype open.)\nIntegration instructions here.\n\nA: Try \n$ sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin\n\nthen go to skype options, notification settings, find event you want to edit (for example, online contact notification), check \"Execute following script\" and insert\nnotify-send \"%sname is now online\" -i skype\n\nThis worked for me. You can do this with other notifications as well.\n\nA: There is a tool called Skype-wrapper that uses native notification system of Ubuntu.\nTo install Skype-wrapper, enter the following commands in a terminal.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:skype-wrapper/ppa\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install skype-wrapper python-skype\n\nNote: The above PPA, at the time of writing, has packages for 10.10, 11.04, 11.10 and 12.04 only.\nAfter installing skype-wrapper, open Skype and sign in. Then, open skype-wrapper and allow it to use Skype by clicking the 'Yes' button. Select the option \"Remember this selection\" if you don't want to repeat this step everytime you use skype-wrapper.\n\nAfter authorizing skype-wrapper to use Skype, you will have both native notifications and Skype's actual notifications. To disable Skype's notifications, open Skype and go to options > notifications and disable all of the available notification types. Disabling notifications inside Skype doesn't disable skype-wrapper's native notifications. \n\nUseful link:\nHow to add Skype to the Ubuntu messaging-menu\n\nA: Another easy solution based on another answer on this question:\nsudo apt-get install libnotify-bin\n\nthen go to skype options -> notification settings and find the event you want to edit (for example, online contact notification) and click advanced view. \nNext, check \"Display built-in system pop-up notification\"\nYou can do this with other events as well.\n", "Q: Can I make grub2 boot from a CD in an external USB CD drive? I would like to boot from an external USB CD/DVD drive on a Toshiba Portege which can't. I've tried with plop, but haven't had any luck.\n\nA: I'm sorry, but your only options seems to be plop. I have successfully tried on a computer whose BIOS that doesn't allow booting from USB-CD-Drive.\nGRUB2 itself doesn't support booting from a CD-Drive but it supports booting from ISO files.\n\nA: Your BIOS must support booting from USB.\n", "Q: apticron EMAIL setting format for multiple recipients?

I removed all of my gnome-panel's in favor of the Avant Window Manager for a number of reasons, and would really like to not have to have a gnome-panel still just being hidden.\nIs there a command to launch the Alt+F2 window without having a gnome-panel active? I'd like to add an icon to my dock that launches that window, or a window that let's me run a command like that one.\n\nA: To supplement Ken's great answer, I would add that the openbox window manager includes the gnome-panel-control program that allows you to call up the GNOME Run Dialog. You could install openbox without using the window manager and use the following command:\ngnome-panel-control --run-dialog\n\n\nA: No, the Alt+F2 window is a dialog within gnome-panel, so you can't really launch it standalone.\nI highly suggest using gnome-do instead though.\nsudo apt-get install gnome-do\n\n\nA: an alternative to gnome-do is kupfer - http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=kupfer\n\nA: According to here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=9813331&postcount=2 there are a number of simple run dialogue programs: gmrun, Alawalk, Bashrun and Lauf. Lauf is apparently good.\n\nA: Although not a launcher, you can install guake. Its a drop-down terminal, much like the consoles in FPS games where you entered cheat codes.\n", "Q: A good video editor/creation tool \nPossible Duplicate:\nVideo editing on Ubuntu \n\nI'm looking for a good video editor/creation app for Ubuntu. Something similar to that on Windows would work just fine for my purposes. I would prefer something that could add in titles and transitions. Any suggestions would be appreciated! Oh, and the video file type doesn't make a huge different for my need either. \n\nA: Have you tried pitivi?

This option is designed for interoperability with the --null option of GNU xargs(1).\n\nor \nlocate $something | while read f; do rm \"$f\"; done\n\nAlso, you should protect *.orig with quotes, to avoid the shell expansion, and pass it to locate untouched.\n\nA: It's xargs not xarg\n\nA: The command locate *.orig | xargs rm does work actually but what was happening was that locate was finding *.orig files in the trash can and rm spits out the error No such file or directory when trying to delete files in the trash can.\n\nA: locate doesn't do the globbing, but the shell does. The shell expands *.orig to what it finds in the current directory which matches *.orig. \nJust use \nlocate .orig\n\nand if that gets you what you need\nlocate .orig | xargs rm\n\nor, as enzotib mentioned\nlocate -0 .orig | xargs -0 rm\n\nif you have Whitespace in the filenames.\n\nA: A trick : Save all paths in tmp file . then , Loop on it: \n#!/bin/bash\nlocate .orig /tmp/tmp.txt\nwhile read line\ndo\n    pth=$line\n    rm \"$pth\" \ndone < /tmp/tmp.txt\n\nrm -rf /tmp/tmp.txt \n\n", "Q: Killing a running process in an Ubuntu machine remotely from a windows machine which is in LAN Is it possible to kill a process running in an Ubuntu machine from a Windows(XP) machine remotely connected via LAN ?\nI can kill the process in a windows machine from a remote windows machine (in LAN) by the following command,\ntaskkill /S system /U username /P password /IM process.exe\n\nIs there any thing like that to kill the process running in the Linux machine ?\n\nA: Install openssh-server on Ubuntu and PuTTY on Windows. Then you can get a shell on your Ubuntu machine from the Windows one.\nOnce logged into your Ubuntu machine remotely, you can use kill or pkill or killall as you prefer.  I find pkill simplest if you just want to kill based on the process's name. For example: pkill firefox\nIf, however, you wanted to kill a specific process whose PID (process ID) you know (possibly from looking through the output of ps -ef), you can use kill 1234\nYou can combine kill signals with these to say how they should be killed. The default is 15, or SIGTERM (term = terminate), which is a polite request to please close now.  If a process doesn't respond to that, 9 (SIGKILL) is popular.  See man 7 signal for more information about signals. To use this with kill or pkill you'd simply add -9 for example:  kill -9 firefox\n\nA: If you are running an ssh daemon on your Ubuntu machine then you can login via SSH using PuTTy from your windows machine.\nOnce you are logged in, you can look at the current running processes with the ps aux command and then use kill or pkill to end the task\nNote: You may need to use sudo with the kill commands\n\nA: If you have sshd installed on the Ubuntu box (almost always a good thing) you can connect and kill the process as normal (e.g. killall process, or similar).\nOn the Ubuntu box:\n$ sudo apt-get install ssh\n\nOn Windows, download PuTTY:\nhttp://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/\nOpen PuTTY and set it to connect to the Ubuntu box's IP address (e.g. 192.168.0.1). You should be presented with a login prompt, so provide your Ubuntu username and password.\nAs maco has already said, there are a variety of ways of killing processes - just take your pick of pkill, killall etc., e.g.:\n$ killall firefox\n\n", "Q: Player for rtmp:// protocol?

I have access to a box over SSH and there are some files I'd like to transfer to another machine, but those are only accessible under another account\nIf I ssh with 1, then sudo 2 I can browse them.\nWhat I want actually is a mirror to copy them over to my Windows-based PC\nHow can I achieve that if only SSH is available?\n\nA: You can use something like tar to and pipes to do this (as long as you have tar available on both hosts). For example, to copy root's homedir over to another host:\nsudo tar c -C / root | ssh remote_host tar xv -C some/location/to/unpack/into\n(assuming gnu tar for -C support, it can be done without it using '()' but it's trickier) and of course, you can do the sudo on the remote end:\ntar c -C my_trojan_files . | ssh remote_host sudo tar xv -C /usr/bin\nThe trick here is that, in both cases, tar is emitting the archive to STDOUT, which is being piped into the command running on the remote host via ssh. You can do this with cpio and dump/restore as well.\n\nA: You can, using scp. It's done like this:\nscp <file to transfer> user@server:/place/to/put/file\n\nscp is provided by ssh in the package openssh-client\nFor more info, type 'man scp'.\n\nA: I assume that you do not have the password to the other user account, nor to the root account, and/or the remote host does not allow direct root login via SSH.\nIf it is not too much data, I would just SSH in beforehand, become root, create a tarball of the data, grant access to the tarball for your regular user, then download the tarball as your regular user. \n\nA: You can install winscp on your Windows box to pull the files from your Ubuntu machine over ssh. http://winscp.net\nTheir site has instructions on su-ing to another user after logon: http://winscp.net/eng/docs/faq_su\n", "Q: Can't get rid of fake floppy drive In my system it says I have \"floppy0\" mounted and I can't get rid of it. \nIt isn't a real drive of any sort, since my computer doesn't even have a disk drive, when I click on it it says \"unable to mount floppy0:\n\nA: You can also blacklist the floppy driver module (handy if your BIOS doesn't have the option to disable the floppy drive like many modern laptops):\n$ gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist\n\nAdd blacklist floppy to the end of the file, and reboot.\n\nA: Restart your computer and go into its BIOS (press Del, F10 or F12 -- read what it says -- when you boot up) and under one of the first parts of it, you should be able to disable the floppy drive by setting it disabled. \nSave and exit. Ubuntu will then stop auto-detecting it.\nJust as a quick explanation for this: Old floppy drives (not the USB ones) lived on amazingly unsophisticated buses. There wasn't an \"auto-detect floppy drive\" like there became for hard disks. You therefore had to explicitly state whether or not you had a floppy drive plugged in if you wanted to use it.\nSeeing as nothing bad (apart from the behaviour you're experiencing) happens when BIOS told there is a drive when there isn't, motherboard manufacturers played it safe and left the option on, assuming (I assume) that people building their own systems would inevitably forget to go into BIOS and turn the floppy drive on and select its type.\n", "Q: Creating a directory of recently created files On a system I have, files are uploaded through a series of various mechanisms into one central \"incoming\" directory. Once a day those files are processed and they are moved off to where they need to be (that logic isn't relevant here). They end up in a subdirectory of /files/. I guess a simple (albeit inaccurate in my specific case) would be to say that files that start with \"a\" get moved to /files/a/afile.\nSo I have a load of subdirectories in /files/. That's great and it works for me. However the client has just told me that it would be nice if there could be a \"recently added\" directory where files from the past week are available.\nMy first thought was to create a directory called /recent-files/ and extend the file processing script to do the following after it moves files out of /incoming/:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete all files from within /recent-files/\n\n*Scan /files/ for any file (not directory) created within a week\n\n*Create a symlink for each to its real path and stick it in /recent-files/\nSounds like it would work but my bash is still pretty weak when it comes to arithmetic and file-creation dates. Can anybody lend me a hand crafting a find ... -exec ... statement that approximates parts two and three?\nOf course, if there's another way of creating a command-line and NFS visible \"search directory\", let me know.\n\nA: If using Zeitgeist and FUSE is feasible for your scenario, Zeitgeist Filesystem enables sorting files and other Zeitgeist events by time in a userspace filesystem.\nAnother (simpler) solution might be to use something like fileschanged in your script to monitor your directory for incoming files.\n\nA: find -L files -type f -newerct '-7 days' -exec ln -s -t recent-files {} +\n\n(Of course, change \"files\" and \"recent-files\" as appropriate.)\nThe 'c' used in -newer isn't creation time, it's the \"change\" field as shown by stat (the command, e.g. man 1 stat).  It's currently uncommon for *nix filesystems to store creation time, but change ('c'), modification ('m'), and access ('a') time is available.  If your filesystem does store creation time, you can use 'B' (\"birth time\") — you'll get an immediate error message if it's unsupported.\nYou can see the exact cutoff with date:\n$ date -d '-7 days'\nSat Oct 16 02:46:27 UTC 2010\n$ date  # this was executed one second later\nSat Oct 23 02:46:28 UTC 2010\n\n", "Q: How to auto-expand ALL sub-directory levels in Nautilus tree view, via the keyboard?

I don't use gnome nor kde desktops because my system isn't as fast as they require it to be, but even when I don't use them, a 'Desktop' folder is always in my home dir, I've delete it several times before but it's again there when I reboot the system, what do I need to do in order to delete it for ever?\n\nA: Try removing the package xdg-user-dirs.\nFrom the package description:\nxdg-user-dirs is a tool to help manage \"well known\" user directories\nlike the desktop folder and the music folder. It also handles\nlocalization (i.e. translation) of the filenames.\n\nThe way it works is that xdg-user-dirs-update is run very early in the\nlogin phase. This program reads a configuration file, and a set of\ndefault directories. It then creates localized versions of these\ndirectories in the users home directory and sets up a config file in\n$(XDG_CONFIG_HOME)/user-dirs.dirs (XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to\n~/.config) that applications can read to find these directories.\n\nBTW: instead of removing it, you can of course also edit the user-dirs.dirs file and make it point to whatever directories you prefer...\n\nA: I'm pretty sure you will always have a \"Desktop\".  I could be wrong though. \nRemoving your \"Desktop folder\" would make it impossible to create stuff on the Desktop wouldn't it? And since it tries to always exist since it's basically like an always open folder wouldn't it just keep recreating itself?

I am using Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid (32).  \nI have installed KDE's Konsole (terminal), as it offers a couple of things I can't currently get in the gnome-terminal.  \nHowever there is a fly in the soup... On any day of the week, I prefer to use the keyboard over the mouse; wherever possible... but for some reason Konsole's menu does not respond to the typical (and expected) Alt-F to open up the File menu, etc... \nTo see if it was just a conflict between Konsole and the gnome desktop, I donwloaded Kubuntu 10.04, and installed it into a VM... with the same result: No menu accelerators for Konsole (only)!   \nAll other KDE apps seem to have normally functional menu-accelerator keys... so I am left wondering why konsole is different!?  ... and is there a fix for this?  \nUpdate:  The accelerators in question refer to the first menu-level only. ie to the items shown in menu-bar (not in the sub-menus). \n\nA: A terminal is often used by child programs such as Vi/Vim and Emacs, etc...\nThese programs run directly in the terminal, and have their own sets of shortcut-keys... These app-specific shortcut-keys sometimes utilize the same Alt+F, Alt-E, Alt+V, etc keys as are used by a conventional GUI app's menu bar accelerator-keys (eg. Kate, gedit, etc).\nAlso the terminal's native line-editing keybindings use Alt+F (word forward), Alt+B (word back), Alt+T (swap words), etc ... which also conflict with the typical first-level menu shortcut-keys of a conventional GUI app.\nTo prevent the loss of functionality to these apps (including konsole itself), the developers have simply disabled the first-level of menu-accelerators.\nAlthough this first-level of menu accelerator keys has fallen by the wayside, virtually all sub-level items of Konsole's menu structure have their own accelerator key (by default)...  Also, it is very easy to add/modify any menu item's accelerator-key via a right-click option..\nThis means that all menu-items (or as many as I wish to assign)  are accessible via the keyboard...\nThis effectively gives full and complete keyboard access to all menu items... Allbeit in a slightly different way... (but that's because the Terminal is different).\nClick for a related link\n\nA: I am using Kubuntu 17.04. Konsole 16.12.3  Accelerator keys are turned off by default.  \nThey can be activated by Settings Menu > Configure Konsole > General Tab > Enable menu accelerators.  This will enable the main menu accelerator keys (File, Edit, View, Bookmarks, Settings, Help).  The submenu accelerator keys are enabled whether the main accelerator keys are enabled or not.\n", "Q: nautilus elementary coverflow not working I installed it and press F4 and nothing happens.

I'm new to Linux and Ubuntu and trying it out but installing 10.10 via Wubi on to my old Samsung V25 laptop.\nFor the larger part, the system seems to be working fine, apart from one key point, its internal monitor is not functional, only output to an external monitor works.\nDuring install and the GUI section of setup, (where the slideshow is displayed, after the Windows part), displayed correctly on the internal monitor, however, after the first reboot, as soon as the Splash screen displays on my external monitor, the internal one shuts off completely. Not blank, it appears entirely turned off.\nThe graphics card is reported by lspci -nn as an 'Intel Corporation 82845/G/GL[Brookdale-G]/GE Chipset Integrated Graphics Device [8086:2562] (rev 03)'.\nWith some help of friends, I've run xrandr but it reports LVDS1, the laptop screen as 'Unknown Connection'. Trying to force display through it at a known safe resolution causes the error: \"cannot find crtc for output LVDS1\"\nHow can I fix this so I can use the laptop with just its internal monitor rather than having to hook it up to another screen?\nUpdate: Having done further searching online, I have now got the system to the point of being able to boot to text mode at 800x600 and, if an external monitor is connected, boot in to graphics mode. If the external monitor is not connected, graphics fails to start but I can at least Ctrl+Alt+F1 to the terminal. To do this, I added i915.modeset=0 xforcevesa to the boot instruction. Along with setting GRUB_GFXMODE and GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD to 800x600. And set the Driver in the Device section of xorg.conf to vesa.\nNow my only requirement is setting the laptop to boot with graphics mode without needing an external monitor connected.\n\nA: I would certainly report this issue as a bug if you're still being effected by it, from a command line (Applications > Accessories > Terminal) copy and paste the following command:\nubuntu-bug xorg\nThis should collect all the required information and you should be given the chance to add in more information about your situation and what you've done to try and fix the issue.\n", "Q: What GIS (Geographic Information System) software is available? Native GIS software for Ubuntu (Linux)? The most famous is grass and qgis but it is not the only GIS software, is it?\n\nA: I use Quantum GIS, it is an excellent promising GIS package, has a very nice graphic user interface based on Qt, it can act as an interface to the venerable GRASS GIS tools too.\nSAGA GIS which looks like a good second to Quantum GIS is available in the repositories. Do not forget Google Earth, even though it is not open source and have some limitations compared to a specialized GIS package it can be a very useful tool for some of your GIS work.\nA useful set of command line tools to use for mapping and some GIS work are the Generic Mapping Tools GMT. The Geospatial Data Abstraction Library Utility programs are a must, you can get these by installing gdal-bin from the repositories.\n\nA: There are many GIS options available on Ubuntu. As you note, GRASS and Quantum GIS are two of the most widely used applications. They are probably the most user friendly options as well.\nThuban (install ) is another desktop option.\nMapserve is a web-based GIS option available in the repos.\nThe Ubuntu GIS team has a PPA providing the most up to date versions of geospacial related software for Ubuntu. This would be a good place to start investigating further options. The Debian DIS team is relevant as well.\n\nA: There is a very nice overview of open source GIS applications that run on ubuntu on the OSGEO live dvd, and it is also available here:\nhttp://live.osgeo.org/en/overview/overview.html\nThis live dvd is based on ubuntu so all discussed applications can be installed on ubuntu, although some installation programs are better integrated (eg packages through synaptic).\n\nA: You can try gvSIG:\nhttp://www.gvsig.org/web/projects/gvsig-desktop/official/gvsig-1.9/descargas\n\nA: You could also check out the stackexchange GIS beta site https://gis.stackexchange.com/, to see if there are Ubuntu or Linux users there with tips.   \nOne of the thread answers includes the Ubuntu GIS ppa that andrew mentioned : \"The awesome Ubuntu GIS repository makes it really easy to install and keep updated with open source GIS software. Anyone installing an open source GIS stack on Windows will appreciate this.\"\nLink from the comment, for completeness : Ubuntu Wiki UbuntuGIS \n\nA: Not directly related to your question, but if you're looking to convert GIS formats, gpsbabel does a great job.  It's likely to be a good complement to any GIS app that you use.\n", "Q: Auto-connect to hidden wireless without elevating privilege When I boot my laptop into Ubuntu 10.10, the wireless won't automatically connect; it is configured, and I can get a connection using \"Connect to Hidden Wireless Network...\" and selecting the name from the drop-down - however, the first time (per boot) I do this, it asks me to elevate myself. The connection works if I then surrender the elevated privilege. The connection is set as available to all users, and to connect automatically.\nWhat I would like is that it silently and automatically connect to the wireless. How can I do that?\n\nA: If even after all warnings about using a hidden SSID you still want to use it, this is how you can do it.\nCreate a script, e.g. ~/bin/nm-connect-me.sh with the follwing contents:\n#!/bin/sh\n#\n# Automatically try to connect to 'MyWiFi' when WiFi is enabled\n#\n\n# the output of nmcli should be in English\nLC_ALL=C\n\n# loop for a while until NetworkManager is accepting commands\nwhile [ \"$(nmcli -t -f WIFI,STATE nm)\" = 'enabled:disconnected' ]\ndo\n nmcli con up id MyWiFi\n sleep 5\ndone\n\nexit 0\n\nThen add it to your list of startup applications.\nOf course you have to replace MyWiFi by your SSID name.\nThis information has been extracted from: http://blog.nixpanic.net/2011/01/connect-automatically-and-immediately.html\n\nA: I'd recommend not to use hidden network settings, because you'll have nothing but trouble from it (I am telling you this from my own personal experience).\nIt is not a security feature, in fact, if you google it a bit, you'll discover that your network can actually be less secure with hidden SSID. It may also be the cause you need to elevate..\nSee http://brighthub.com/computing/smb-security/articles/1211.aspx\n\nA: You can set the keystore password to blank, therefore you will not be asked for a password anymore (I mean the keystore password, not your account password, obviously).\n", "Q: How to find out root password for installing software I'm trying to install the NetBeans IDE in my Ubuntu and in the process it's asking for my root password which I don't remember. I know my sudo user password. How can I recover my root password?\n\nA: Use your password. If you are an administrator user, you can use your password in these password prompts. If not, you will need to log on as an administrator user to do system wide things like installing software.\n\nA: Root account is by default disabled -- that means root has no password. Ubuntu is using sudo -- sudo allows \"normal users\" to run commands with superuser privilegies and and to \"run\" sudo they are using their own password.\nMore information here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo\n\nA: As default Ubuntu has no password set for the root user, i.e., the account named root. To gain root privileges as another user you have to type in your own password. This is the password you set for the first user account while installing Ubuntu.\nTo set a password for the root, run the following command in a Terminal shell:\nsudo passwd root\n\nAfter this you are asked to type in the new password twice. After this the root account has its own password, so you can actually log in with the user name root.\n\nA: Please see the link below:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo#Re-disabling%20your%20root%20account\n\nA: Try installing Netbeans from the package repositories. It's packaged in such a way as to avoid the need for a root password.\n\nA: The root password on Ubuntu systems is left unset and unusable on purpose. Ubuntu uses sudo (switch user do) to elevate the privileges of an administrative user. (The user created on installation is, by default, an administrative user.). Sudo logs everything passed to it, which is useful, as you can check later what commands have been run with it.\nIf you're being prompted for any password, it's most likely your own (user) password that's needed.\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is it bad to login as root?\n\n*Why is there no option to login as root?\n\nA: By default the root account is disabled, and you won't have the password for your root account. If you need the password for your root account, then you have to create one for root:\nsudo passwd root\n\nNote: \n\n\n*\n\n*Enabling the Root account is rarely necessary.\n\n*Almost everything you need to do as an administrator of a Ubuntu system can be done via sudo or gksudo.\n\n\nYou can find information for enabling the root account in RootSudo. Use it at your own risk.\n\nA: Encryption for passwords was invented to protect them from viewing. You cannot just view it, but you can change it without viewing old one. The only way to view an encrypted password is to decode it. You can try, encrypted passwords are in file /etc/shadow, but you'll just waste your time.\nSo just change the root password like this:\nsudo passwd\n\n\nA: For resetting the root password in Ubuntu from other try run following commands:\nsudo -su\npasswd\n\nNow type your new password twice and Done!\n", "Q: How do I know what sound system is being used? I've noticed there is ALSA, OSS, and PULSEAUDIO. How do I know what I'm using?\n(I'm running MythBuntu 10.04 and I want to figure out how to make all apps - VLC, Basero etc output via the SPDIF).\n\nA: Different applications can make use of different \"sound systems\".  For some applications, you can choose the sound backend at run time (e.g., via a preference setting); for other, this has to be a compile-time choice (therefore, it's up to the package maintainer to select one).\nApplications that come in the main Ubuntu repository have been compiled with PulseAudio support, so you can control the sound inputs and outputs via System -> Preferences -> Sound or padevchooser.\nStill, some applications do not support PulseAudio and only offer a choice of ALSA/OSS: older versions of Skype and Adobe Flash are the primary example, but also the free music player Aqualung.\nSo, in the end, the answer is: it's application-specific, and you might need to dig into the application preferences or upgrade/recompile to get them working the way you want.\n\nA: If your sound is working, right click on the Volume icon in the taskbar, and click preferences. The System you are using will be mentioned at the top. \nPS: Thats how it happens in Ubuntu 9.04, which I am using now.\n", "Q: Where are my installed applications? I have installed Skype in Ubuntu, but I do not know where to start the installed the Skype application .Similarly  I have installed Netbeans and other applications but their icons are not appearing in any menus.\nRelated: how to uninstall already installed applications?\n\nA: You can discover where a package puts its 'stuff' by running:\ndpkg -L 'packagename'\n\nThere's still a set of 'standard' locations that programs are put into. For example, binaries (in windows parlance 'executables') are put in /usr/bin, and documentation is put in /usr/share/doc in a Ubuntu system.\nThis is a pretty simplistic answer. For more details about how linux/unix directories are typically structured, see this:\nhttp://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html\n\nA: The executables are located in the /usr/bin folder. I guess pressing Alt+F2 and typing\nskype\n\nwill do. It might also fall under the Applications menu > Internet.\nTo uninstall already installed software, you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Software-center. Find the software and remove.\n\n*Open a terminal, and type \nsudo apt-get remove <software-name>\n\nIf you do not know the complete name, just type a few characters of the application, and press tab twice. That will auto complete, or show a list of matching applications.\n\nA: There is no \"Program Files\" Directory in Linux. The Application's Parts are distributed according to what they are. There are a lot of explanations of the Directory Structure out there, you can use this one for a start. \n\nA: There are some very good answers to a similar question to yours over at \nWhat is the Linux equivalent to Windows' Program Files?\nBut the general idea is that the /bin and /usr/bin are where the start up application files (executables or scripts) are stored. The direct equivalent of \"Program Files\" though is probably /usr/share this is the directory that contains the various support files for most applications\nFor a good overview of the Ubuntu file structure check out the link below.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/LinuxFilesystemTreeOverview\n", "Q: Why is the resolution incorrectly set on boot after installing the Nvidia drivers?

Why is it needed? can't I just give an address:port and just \"connect\"?\n\nA: The ssh connections to your computer are handled by an ssh server. If you do not have a server running then the connection request just gets ignored. Similarly: if you want to check a web page then the computer you are connecting to has to run an http server. In a default Ubuntu installation neither of these services are installed.\n\nA: The TCP/IP network stack in the Linux kernel only provides a means for data transport: you need a program that listens to the incoming data, processes that, and sends output data back.  Such programs are usually called \"servers\" or \"daemons\"; that's why you need to run the \"OpenSSH server\" in order to receive SSH connections on your machine.\n\nA: for more information about SSH protocols read this page :\nOpen-Ssh Web Page and help ubuntu \n\nA: OpenSSH server is not needed, but as Riccardo explains you will need some SSH server to accept the ssh connection and do something useful with it.  And if you don't have a good reason to use something else, using OpenSSH is a good idea (it's the best known & most used SSH server, and thus well-tested).\n\nA: On a side note. If you are just looking to setup something like a little test server, then you can use a program called netcat. It is available in the software center / synaptic, or can be downloaded at: http://netcat.sourceforge.net.\nWith this tool you can create a fake server.

Open your favorite editor (gedit/vi/nano for example) and edit the configuration file.\nvi .xbindkeysrc\n\n\n*If you already have some content in the file, look if there is already a binding like it (unlikely, not by default) and add at the end.\n#Pagedown press\n\"xte 'keydown Next'\"\nb:8\n\n#Pagedown release\n\"xte 'keyup Next'\"\nb:8 + Release\n\n#Pagedup press\n\"xte 'keydown Prior'\"\nb:9\n\n#Pageup release\n\"xte 'keyup Prior'\"\nb:9 + Release\n\nNote: you need two entries, one for the button press and one for the release.\n\n*The buttons 8+9 will be mapped to the keys \"Next\" (which is PAGE_DOWN) and \"Prior\" (PAGE_UP).

When I checked them, they were set to MBR and NTFS.\nI have read that GUID is superior to MBR. Is that true? In any case, I have set these portable hard drives to that system instead of MBR. (I can, of course, change them back.) I see no difference in anything, operation-wise or performance-wise. What would be the pros and/or cons of this?\nWhen I formatted these drives as Ext4, however, I see, with no data on the drives, that about 23 GB was being used (for something), reducing the amount of available space by that much.\nWhen I reformatted them as NTFS, I see only 73.5 MB being used, a considerable difference.\nCan anyone here comment on the pros and/or cons of these various file systems and how they will benefit (or detract) from my overall usage of these drives?\nOr doesn't it make any difference at all? I'm using these drives strictly as storage media.\nI thank you for your consideration.\n\nA: GPT partitioning (what you call GUID) is newer and has some features that make it better than MS-DOS partitioning (what you call MBR).  For example you will need it for disks that are larger than 2 TiB.  But not all operating systems recognize it (especially older OS, like Windows XP, but linux distros from a couple of years ago too), and teh same is true for soem utilities, so using MS-DOS partitioning is better if you don't know beforehand what computers you need to connect to, or what applications you are going to use.\nSimilarly, when you need to exchange data with Windows or Mac OS X users sometimes, it's probably best to use NTFS or even FAT32.  Personally I solve this by having multiple partitions on my portable disk.  That way I can use the FAT32 partition for when I need to exchange files, and the ext3/4 partition for \"personal usage\".  If you only use them as storage for Ubuntu systems, I'd suggest you use a linux filesystem (e.g. ext3/4) because it will be faster & more stable.\n\nA: there are 2 good page where you can obtain more information :\nPERFORMANCE OF FILESYSTEMS COMPARED and Comparison of file systems \n", "Q: Installing CoverGloobus Is there any easier way to install Covergloobus 1.6 in Ubuntu 10.10 ?

Do note that you cannot upgrade from 9.04 to 10.10 directly, you can move from 9.04 to 9.10 to 10.04 to 10.10 though. \nThat can take a long time so you'll probably save a bunch of time by backing up your data and reinstalling. \n\nA: Thank you all for answering or looking. i have found the answer, as you do when you install net-book edition you install it using a USB stick. here is the link provided. http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download\n", "Q: Booting from USB inside VMware Workstation I'm attempting to install Windows 7 inside a VMware Workstation virtual machine using a bootable USB stick, however the VMware BIOS does not detect the stick, and so I cannot boot from it. The stick works perfectly for installing Windows directly onto the HDD (which I've already done) so there's no problem there, and the stick is being recognise by VMware as I have the option to disconnect it. \n\nA: Vmware BIOS doesn't support that feature but you can do a bridge to support this feature, the explanation here\n", "Q: Low output volume I have two laptops: Dell xps M1210 and Dell vostro 1400. On MS windows the output volume is so loud that I just need to set volume to around 20% to listen music and watch videos. I use Bose TriPort In-Ear Headphones most of the times. On ubuntu, even if I set 100% volume on the multimedia player, on the desktop volume manager as well, and also on the ncurses GUI of alsa mixer, I get very low volume output. Sometimes while playing some vidoes the volume is so low that I barely hear any words. I have struggled for two years since I started to use ubuntu to solve this mystery. The same sound card which gives excellent sound on MS windows fails miserably on GNU/Linux. Few weeks back I bought an Asus 100PX EEE PC. To my surprise even it also has the same issue. I have tried many versions of ubuntu and also I have done manual compiles of alsa modules without any success. I have asked and read about it in every possible forums and howto's. Nothing has helped me to address the issue.\n\nA: \nThere is a headphone and analog jack. You can go to the Sound options panel and adjust these manually with the slider. That way when you reboot, the sound wont be full on.\n\nA: When your in the NCurses GUI of alsamixer, have you tried to see if any channels are muted or very low? If any are muted, unmute it using the M key and make sure every channel is around 100%, you can use the arrow keys to adjust them.\n\nA: I had this problem too. What worked for me was installing pavucontrol. Then open it, then on the first tab (playback), you can move the slider to control alsamixer over 100%, i. e. over 0 db.\n", "Q: Recover data using Photorec onto an External Drive I lost my Windows Vista while installing Ubuntu. Few people suggested me to use Photorec to recover the data. I already installed testdisk. The place where I am confused is: I attached an external drive, got an icon on the the desktop, but I am not able to run the exe file which unlocks the drive. The drive is showing up under \"media\" with permissions drwx------. My question is even if I am not able to unlock it, am I safe to proceed to back up data onto this drive?\n\nA: If the drive is formated with a Linux format (ext3, ext4) you will need rights to move files to it. That may be the issue. From the look of the permissions you showed that appears to be the case. I would personally do the following:\nIn Terminal\n1.  sudo su\n2.  cd \n3.  mkdir recovery\n4.  chown  recovery\n5.  exit\nYou can now run your photorec program to recover data from the external drive. Please be aware that this data will not be named with the old names and you will have to take some time sorting the data.\nHere is an excellent page on what to do after you run photorec so that it is easier to find the files you need.\nhttp://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/After_Using_PhotoRec\n", "Q: Where are all my Empathy settings stored?

If you also want your saved passwords for accounts, you'll need to copy your GNOME keyring as well, which is in ~/.gnome2/keyrings. \n", "Q: Importance of Swap Partition \n*\n\n*What is the purpose of a swap partition?\n\n*How do I know I have just enough swap partition?  Not too much/little.\n\n\nMy Ubuntu PC is used for typical stuff:\n\n\n*\n\n*Web (email, facebook, etc.)\n\n*Some movies\n\n*gaming is rare\n\n\nA: This is very close to the same as this question about the “right” size for a swap partition.  Much of the same information from my answer there applies - basically, if you want to hibernate you generally want your swap space to be at least as big as your RAM, and other than that a round number like 1 or 2 GB is easily sufficient.  Because swap is so much slower than RAM, if you're filling up multiple gigabytes of swap your computer has almost certainly become unusably slow.\nThere's also no real need for a swap partition - swap files (available on the mainstream linux filesystems) give the same performance and make it trivially easy to add more swap space if you decide you haven't got enough.\n\nA: here a very deep information about swap\nsome people say the double of your ram but personally i recommend this :\nswap = 1.5 X Total Ram \nExample :\nif you have 2Gb of ram -> swap = 1.5 x 2 = 3 \nP.D : Ubuntu Desktop uses Swap to Hibernate (PC off, no power needed, program states saved). If Hibernation is important to you, have more swap space then ram + swap overflow. \n\nA: The free command can tell you how much swap you are using. For example on this machine:\n$ free -m\n             total       used       free     buffers     cached\nMem:          1947       1863         84         312        758\n-/+ buffers/cache:        792       1154\nSwap:         4000          3       3997\n\nshows me that I have 2GB (1947m) RAM and that the system has used most of it. However, 312m is used for I/O buffers and the remainder (758m) the system has decided to fill with disk cache.\nThe disk cache is interesting because it is using fast memory instead of slow disk for its contents. The contents could be gotten from disk, but they are kept around in case they are needed. This also means that there is 758m of memory that can be reclaimed in an instant if necessary because the system knows it can find that data on the disk instead.\nThat is why there is a second line showing that if there were no buffering and cache, I'd have half my RAM (1154m) available for use.\nThe third line shows that I have an overly large swap partition (it was there and wasn't doing anything) of which a whopping 3m have been used. This is stuff that the kernel really doesn't expect to have to use anytime soon so it was stuck out on the \"back porch\".\nWhile free gives you the snapshot now, vmstat can give you a running picture:\n$ vmstat 10\nprocs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ----cpu----\n r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa\n 0  0   3588  86236 316524 769132    0    0    14    13  126   81  4  1 95  0\n 0  0   3588  83872 316532 770512    0    0     0    20  264 1229  3  1 96  0\n\nThere's a lot of information there, but of interest is that there is no swap-in (si) or swap-out (so) traffic. Which means I'm not using the swap at all over the last 10 seconds.\n\nA: The swap partition serves a couple of purposes. \n\n\n*\n\n*It serves as 'backup' RAM. That is, should your computer run out of RAM, it will use the swap area as a temporary source of more memory. More specifically, it will 'swap' unused items from the RAM into the swap area in order to leave spare space for the applications that need it at that instant. This is not ideal as the data transfer rate to the hard drive is significantly lower than that to your normal RAM. In practice this means its much slower to retrieve information from the swap area.\n\n*It is used when the computer hibernates. Hibernation involves taking an image of the RAM in its current state (like an ISO represents an image), and saves it to the swap area. It then reloads this image when the computer restarts.\n\n*To be most useful, the swap area should be at least (RAM * 1.5) although more is recommended. For example, on my system with 3gb of RAM, I have a swap area of 7.2gb.\n\nA: I have a laptop with a slow hard drive, but relatively high RAM (8GB).  On this setup, I find a swap drive to be counterproductive for the following reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Getting applications back out of swap is slow, comparable to loading the application from scratch.  I would rather have an environment that responds quickly, even if that means I sometimes have to close and reload applications, than an environment which sometimes stalls on me unexpectedly.\n\n*If I wanted the ability to hibernate, that would mean writing a lot of data to disk.  That would be a constant drain on battery if it was done persistently (the default behaviour of swappiness 60), or if it was only done at hibernation time (by reducing swapiness), then it would take a long time to actually hibernate.  I found suspending to be RAM instead of suspending to disk to be quite satisfactory.  It could stay suspended for a couple of days, and it would unsuspend much more quickly than a full hibernation.\n\n*Because the hard drive is slow, I prefer to keep 1GB of RAM reserved for disk cache, effectively exchanging memory for speed.  This keeps my machine snappy, but it does mean I can use only 7GB of my 8GB of RAM for applications.  The software I use to achieve that is a fork of earlyoom which kills old browser tabs when 88% of the RAM has been used.  I occasionally have to reload old browser tabs which have been killed off.\nWhen would this advice not apply?\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have a fast hard disk drive, or an SSD, and have fewer concerns about battery drain, then the disadvantages I outlined above will not apply.  (Although early SSDs might have issues with wear, I believe any SSDs sold since 2018 should be fine.)\n\n*If your machine has very little RAM, or you like to use multiple memory-hungry applications at the same time, then you may need to use swap to get your work done, regardless of the disadvantages.  This was the primary use-case for swap, before memory started to become cheaper.\n\n*If you really need hibernation (perhaps you want to suspend your laptop, and re-open it after a few days without charging) then you need a swap drive (recommended at least as large as your RAM).\nCaveat:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some of the software that we leave running for a long time (especially the OS and desktop environment) will load code into memory which will never actually be used again.  These pages could be moved to swap and will never need to be pulled out again, thus avoiding the disadvantages I mentioned earlier.  For this reason, I sometimes create a small 512MB or 1GB swap file, and let the unused pages of memory get swapped out.  This just leaves me with a little more RAM for applications.  (Needed: A technique for measuring swap churn, to help tune the size of this swap file.)\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Swap area is the part of Hard Disk space used to support limited\nspace RAM memory. RAM is limited in size so, some applications need\nmore RAM than the available RAM space, In that case this Swap Space\nalso called as Virtual Memory used to support RAM.\n\n*It is slower in    speed compared to RAM's speed. When we run a large\napplication then    the least recently used part of that application\nin swapped to Swap    Area on the Hard Drive, it is swapped back from\nSwap Area when it is    needed. This gives Operating System a feel of\njust having more RAM    than actually it is.\n\n*It is a dedicated partition on Hard Disk created while installing Operating System.\n\n*It is good if create Swap Area of Double the size of RAM.\n\n*You can check used and available Swap Area using following command:\n$ cat /proc/swaps \nFilename                Type        Size    Used    Priority\n/dev/sda10              partition   7812092  16      -1\n\n", "Q: How can I enable video and audio codecs?

You can automatically zip these up and email them to  you (the script would have to be your work but it would be simple) or you can make them available through Apache et al (just bind a virtualhost's root to /var/www/munin/).\nThe huge advantage over other (interactive) avenues is it's not a security risk. Running Webmin (as one example) means there's a process running that people can communicate with. That's an attack vector into your system. And being a fairly popular application means it's well targeted by people that script-hack servers.\nIt might be a bit \"tinfoil hat\" but security really is much easier to work with when you've only got a couple of vectors to cover.\n\nA: I like to use a package that most people will probably use called Webmin\nIt's a web based program that allows you to monitor almost any server stats, it allows you to change power options (like shutdown, restart).

Suppose any component of my stack goes down. It alerts me and also bring it up for me.\n\n*Logstash: Any suspicious activity recorded in my logs, it lets me know.\n\n*SeaLion: Now all the above lets me know if there was a problem with my stack. But what caused the problem, I debug with SeaLion. Earlier I use to log the outputs of system profiling tools like sar, top, uptime, iostat, vmstat, netstat etc in files.

It runs Postfix (SMTP) and Dovecot (POP3) so Postfix receives the e-mail and delivers it to Dovecot.  Then I use Thunderbird on my desktop to point at Dovecot and retrieve the messages that are generated.\nI've found that unless I do the custom-built thing, I end up receiving a zillion messages that I just ignore even if there is a problem that I need to look at.  Pretty graphs are nice, but being told precisely what the problem is happens to be way better.

It's either in the /bin folder or /usr/bin I can't recall at the moment, but find Truecrypt and copy that to a small FAT partition of the USB drive. \nYou will want to have one small unencrypted FAT partition, and the rest of the USB stick encrypted, the small drive will have the compiled binary to run truecrypt on that distro.\nIf you plan to run Truecrypt on multiple distros, like one that uses deb and one that uses rpm, then be sure to compensate for this and create a folder on the smaller partition containing folders with each distros truecrypt binary, you could even include a windows version. \nIf you plan on mounting on windows, it would be easiest to use a windows native file system on the encypted drive, such as FAT or NTFS as Windows cannot natively read linux file systems without the use of special drivers.\n", "Q: How do I connect to my Brother MFC-6800 over USB?

For a company with non tech savvy computer users who will mainly need to upload/save pictures, send/receive emails, play solitaire/euchre, print envelopes, and manage taxes, what Ubuntu version would you suggest installing on all their systems? \nUbuntu? Kubuntu, Xubuntu. some other one?\nLooking for the mix that does the most of this out of the box (if any of them at all even come with an envelope printing application). \nThank you.\n\nA: Plain Ubuntu. It's the most widely-known and the best supported. It also has Canonical's full weight behind it, rather than being a community project, so commercial support is also readily available direct from Canonical.\n\nA: Although I believe the current version of plain-old Ubuntu will be just fine for most anyone, there is a very popular version that makes life a lot easier for many people.\nI highly recommend looking into Mint Linux. It is a popular version of Ubuntu (that is 100% compatible [won't act differently]) that comes preloaded with a lot of things people just expect to be on their computer (MP3 capability, Adobe Reader, Flash, certain fonts, etc.)\nIt get updated in the exact same way also so there shouldn't be any security concerns as it really is just a few great packages different than the vanilla Ubuntu.\n\nA: Ubuntu, clearly.\nGnome is built first of all to be easy to use. Whereas the KDE and, especially, XFCE people have other things on their agendas, such as Performance (xfce), Über-Modern technologies (kde) and so on.\nGnome is used by some of the major Linux implementers, such as the city of Largo or Swiss federal court - they certainly bought this argument.\n\nGNOME understands that usability is\n  about creating software that is easy\n  for everyone to use, not about piling\n  on features. GNOME's community of\n  professional and volunteer usability\n  experts have created Free Software's\n  first and only Human Interface\n  Guidelines, and all core GNOME\n  software is adopting these principles. (via http://live.gnome.org/SWOT)\n\nI would not only recommend ubuntu, i'd strongly discourage you from using anything else. For any reason you like, but firstly Usability and Support.\n\nA: Try them for yourself. Download the LiveCDs!\nI don't know of any dedicated Linux envelope printing application but you may find that with a small investment of effort you can get good results with glabels.\n\nA: Ubuntu - its more popular, and as a result there are more people to turn to when problems arise, better software availability, and in my experience, more stable.\nAs for which version, for a commercial environment, id suggest sticking with an LTS release for the longer support cycle, the most recent is version 10.04.\nGood luck. \n", "Q: Enable threading in Alpine? I'm setting up Alpine with 10.10 with my gmail account. However, I am having difficulty setting up the threaded view of email (as in gmail).

I'm not sure what the default is, I have 'mutt-like'.\nThen, when viewing a folder, hit $ (Sort) and H (tHread).\nI remember some issues with gmail and threading, I think that the threaded view in gmail is not dependent upon the \"In-Reply-To\" header that alpine (and other clients read and write).  gmail's threaded index is more complex, using primarily subject (that is all from memory, it could be out of date).\n", "Q: How do you Make Ubuntu One re-authenticate?

In the meantime it might be worth having a cleanup. Ditching old kernels will create 100MB of space per kernel, so that's a quick way to free a lot of space.\n\nA: As >>outofstep mentioned, you could just mount an additional harddrive or partion as /usr or as /usr/share. Most programs install the major part of their installation in these locations. \n(First obviously you have to mirror your /usr files to the new parttion to make sure everything will still be in place. But I'm certain you're familiar with that part.) \n\nA: You seem to know what you want placed where.

The manual page says:\n       If dest_w is None, XWarpPointer moves the pointer by the offsets\n       (dest_x, dest_y) relative to the current position of the pointer.  If\n       dest_w is a window, XWarpPointer moves the pointer to the offsets\n       (dest_x, dest_y) relative to the origin of dest_w.

I installed miredo and have IPv6 up and running it seems. I can ping6 hosts and download webpages with wget or my webbrowser when I specify IPv6 addresses, however whenever I specify a hostname that is offered over both IPv4 and IPv6 the browser picks the IPv4 address for the connection.\nHow can I change that and let the browser use IPv6 instead of IPv4 if available?\nGoogling around I found a hint that browsers will prefer IPv4 over IPv6 for 6to4/teredo tunnels, but so far I haven't found an explanation why or how to change that.\n\nA: For Firefox & other Mozilla/Gecko-based browsers, the network.dns.disableIPv6 setting in about:config should be false if you have IPv6 (it's set to true by default in Ubuntu, because otherwise lots of people get issues with buggy DNS proxies in home routers).\n\nA: As of recent, Chrome, Firefox as well as derived browsers actually avoid IPv6 if a site responds faster over IPv4. It is not possible to change this behavior by means of a configuration setting.\nThe feature itself is probably reasonable for the common user but it almost drives me mad that you cannot disable it. IPv6 connectivity is pretty good nowadays and sometimes IPv6 has several advantages over connecting through IPv4 even if latency - due to tunneling - is higher. I've been browsing over IPv6 for years and despite IPv6 routing and performance has been getting much better, this damn browser \"hack\" feature throws me back a decade.\n\nA: Just as freddyb pointed out, this depends on the configuration of the standard system call to resolve host names, getaddrinfo.\nTo solve your problem, replace the content of your /etc/gai.conf with the following lines:\nlabel ::1/128       0\nlabel ::/0          1\nlabel 2002::/16    2\nlabel ::/96         3\nlabel ::ffff:0:0/96 4\nlabel fec0::/10     5\nlabel fc00::/7      6\n#label 2001:0::/32   7\n\nupdated: thx to freddyb for pointing out that my previous response was wrong: We need to comment the last line, not the 3rd.

If I have miredo installed but Firefox set to \"no proxy\" Firefox uses IPV4 first.\n\n*Install aiccu\nIf I install aiccu and set it up with a tunnel (e.g. SiXXS) then no matter my proxy settings IPV6 is used first by Firefox.\nIt may be that as miredo is there to connect to IPV6 sites it is only used when IPV4 is not available, in which case try aiccu.\n\nA: The answer is simple: Alter the labels.\nlabel 2002::/16    1\nlabel 2001:0::/32   1\n\nThis makes them equivalent to \"vanilla\" ipv6.\nIf you leave them commented out they'll pick up default values.\n\nA: It is not the browsers preferring any of the options, it's the operating system.\nThe standard defines the priorities roughly like this:\n\n*\n\n*ipv6\n\n*ipv4\n\n*6to4-Traffic\n\nYou can change this by editing the label/precedence blocks in /etc/gai.conf (gai stands for getaddrinfo, the standard system call for resolving host names).\nA detailed explanation on gai.conf can be found in the man page\nThis, by the way, also explains Jonathon's experience that the SiXXS tunnel was preferred over 6to4.\n", "Q: No Ubuntu logo during startup i have just installed Ubuntu 10.10 on a Sony vaio but, their is no Ubuntu logo on boot all i get is a black screen some writing saying an error and then straight to the login screen. i really like the boot screen and if their is anyway to get the computer boot normally i would like to hear. thank you\n\nA: If this problem is related to the nvidia drivers, this script might help you (fixed this issue for me)\n\nA: Yeah, I had a similar problem.

I am on 10.10 from 10.04 via upgrade. How can I perform a clean install of 10.10 while keeping this partition? Will it perform as well as a clean install? What will be lost and what will be kept?\n\nA: this is possible. \nWhen you arrive at the hardrive information section of the installer, ensure you select the option to configure partitions manually.\nEnsure the partition that contains your home folder is not marked for formatting. You can then manually set its mount point as /home. \nThe rest of the system will be installed as normal on the remaining partition.\n\nA: In theory you can just install the new ubuntu and make partitions manually during the installation process, choosing to keep you old home partition (i.e. without formatting it) linked to the /home mount point.\nThe problem is that in your home all the configuration files for gnome, firefox and a lot of other big software you probably had in your old system, are kept. So installing a brand new system with such configuration files already existing may become a problem if some software has been changed a lot since your old ubuntu was released.\nSo in practice I would suggest to make a copy of the data that's in your home, install the new system keeping your home as I said, and if some serious problem with some software arises you can delete the user (along with its home directory) and re-create it.\n\nA: When you fresh install Ubuntu you have to manually manage partitions. You can decide where to mount / (root) and format that partition, then you select where to mount your home and choose to not format that partition (you don't check the format option). In this way you don't lose anything even if some configuration folder (.mozilla for example) may change. I suggest to backup Home folder before, in case of errors you can remedy.\nHere there's a good tutorial.\n", "Q: Why does removing gwibber-service get rid of indicator-me I don't use gwibber at all but when I go to remove gwibber-service it wants to remove indicator-me.  I still use empathy so I like the indicator being in place. Is there any way to have this removed and why does it want to remove this?\n--indicator-me is the indicator where you can change your online availability and access Ubuntu one \n\nA: The package indicator-me depends on the package libgwibber0 which depends on the package gwibber-service.  You can't remove gwibber-service without removing libgwibber0 and indicator-me.\nYou can, however, remove gwibber-service from your startup applications (System->Preferences->Startup Applications) so that it doesn't sit there using resources. You will find that the broadcast text box disappears when gwibber-service isn't running.\n\nA: As stated in this answer, the indicator-me package depends on libgwibber0 which depends on gwibber-service.\nThe reason that indicator-me has a dependency on libgwibber0 is because indicator-me uses libgwibber0 to provide the inline “social broadcast” posting input box.  \nThe reason why libgwibber0 has a dependency on gwibber-service is that libgwibber0 is an library for interacting with gwibber-service - since it doesn't do anything without a running gwibber-service, the package correctly states the dependency.\n\nA: Tracking the apt dependencies backwards is harder than it should be (or harder than I know). Looking at the (excerpted) output there seems an odd dependency:\n$ dpkg -I libgwibber0_0.0.6-0ubuntu1_i386.deb \n Package: libgwibber0\n Source: libgwibber\n Version: 0.0.6-0ubuntu1\n Depends: ... gwibber-service (>= 2.31.1)\n Homepage: https://launchpad.net/gwibber\n Description: Gwibber - shared library\n  libgwibber provides a library for accessing social networks via\n  gwibber.\n  .\n  This package contains shared libraries to be used by applications.\n\nThe odd dependency is that a library used by a service doesn't seem like it should depend on that service to be present.

Does Ubuntu come with a preinstalled or automatic firewall? If not, do I need one? \nI've read some articles about the advantages of Linux over other operating systems about security (no need to have antivirus, ...) but would like to be sure.\n\nA: it does.\nUbuntu has a firewall called UFW. By default its a command line utility, but there is a gui available - \nsudo apt-get install gufw\n\nOnce this is installed it can be configured from System -> Administration -> Firewall Configuration.\nIt should be noted that if your running on a home network behind a router, you router will already be taking care of your firewall concerns. \nAs a general rule, it is best to only run one firewall at once, so consider switching off your Ubuntu firewall whilst running on your home network.\n\nA: The linux kernel itself has a command line accessible firewall that works barebone:\nman iptables\n\nThis is usually used by the internet service providers, because it is very low on resources, but is very hard to configure (it requires advanced administrator skills).\n\nA: Ubuntu has a firewall included in the Kernel, and is running by default. What you need to manage this firewall are the iptables. But this are complicated to manage, so you can use UFW (uncomplicated firewall) to configure them. But UFW is still something hard for normal users, so what you can do is install GUFW  that is just a graphical front end for UFW.\nIf you use GUFW, the first time you will see at the bottom of the window 'Disabled Firewall'. But this is not true, your firewall is already running. This enable/disable message refers to the rules set with UFW, not to the firewall.\nIf you don't believe me open a terminal and write\nsudo iptables --list --verbose\n\nTry this with GUFW enabled and disabled. You will see that the only diferences will be the rules you set with GUFW.\n\nInformation from this Ubuntu Forums thread\n\nA: Ubuntu doesn't have a firewall turned on by default in the basic installation.\nIf you need a firewall, I recommend using gufw to turn it on and manage it:\ngufw \nGufw is an easy, intuitive, way to manage your Ubuntu firewall, powered by ufw.\nIt supports common tasks such as allowing or blocking pre-configured services, common P2P, or individual IP/port(s), and many others!\nHere is the wiki.\n\nA: you need a powerful firewall in Linux use iptables\nfirestarter \nFirestarter is an Open Source visual firewall program.

I'm sure that all changes were made only by these tools so maybe there is way to fix it. And, yes I know that 9.10 is a little bit outdated but it is still supported and I use it because of software compatibility.\n\nA: It's probably better to run sudo apt-get -f install and sudo dpkg --configure -a instead.  That should install/upgrade all the packages that were marked by the upgrade process but didn't get installed yet because of the crash.\n\nA: This command helped me, when a power cut interrupted my install.

When I checked it out it was given laptop fan always ON : Enabled so I disabled it. Now, while running the system the fan alternatively picks up speed and then slows down. \nThe laptop is not hot at all and the temperature is a bit cold here. Any help will be appreciated :)\n\nA: This is normal functioning for a laptop. Remember that the external temperature of the laptop is not necessarily a guide as to the temperature of the CPU, and naturally manufacturers are cautious when it comes to keeping the hardware cooled!\n\nA: If you're using proprietary drivers for your graphics card, this may have something to do with it. When I was running windows, and now on Ubuntu, I had a similar behaviour. On boot, you could clearly hear the fan spinning like mad, it would slow down only when the drivers were loaded.\nI think that the card firmware is playing it safe and spinning the fan at some \"standard\" speed until drivers kick in and read the temperature, and adjust the fan speed to a sane level.\nBut you might have a completely different issue... >_>\n", "Q: How to access the shared folder between two computers running ubuntu I have to computers running Ubuntu and I want to share files between those computer. these computers are already connected through a cross cable and sharing internet connection using firestarter.

I don't see this problem on other computers that I have, only one has this behavior. Anyone has this problem too? How can I check which components slowdown login time?\n\nA: It could just be your processor(s) warming up, same with the video card.

It'll still take a few seconds for the computer to realize that you've told it to login.\nOut of curiosity, is this only after shutdown, or sleep and hibernation too?\n\nA: One reason could be a very low video performance (there are some video effects from writing the user name to writing the password).

I am running Ubuntu 10.10 and finally got a Wacom Bamboo Pen & Touch tablet to work. \nHowever, I would like to change some settings (assign buttons;remove touch feature;...) and make them stay on startup. How can I do this?\nThank you very much for your patience.\n\nA: Write xsetwacom commands into ~/.xinitrc.\nxsetwacom deliberately doesn't keep settings between X server restarts. The easiest (and safest) way to get stable settings is to just stick your list of xsetwacom commands into a shell script and add it to your startup applications.\nAlternatively, you can bypass xsetwacom comletely and put your tablet settings in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-wacom.conf -- the \"wacom\" manpage lists the option lines. As always, be careful and remember that a poorly formed conf can render your device unusable.\n\nA: For me, the cleanest way seems to be to provide the settings as options to the X server.\n\n\n*\n\n*Find out your device identifier. For this, look into your /var/log/Xorg.0.log for a line that mentions your Wacom tablet's product identifier, such as \"Using input driver 'wacom' for '…'\". Or simply use the product identifier reported by xinput --list but omit the \"touch\" at the end. That suffix is rather the mode of the product and not part of its identifier; modes can be touch, pen, eraser, cursor.\n\n*Find the options to use. The option names are different from those supplied to xsetwacom, but they can be converted automatically. For that, use xsetwacom as you did to configure your device as needed, and then use the following command (with your own product identifier) to list its configuration in the format needed by the Xorg configuration file:\nxsetwacom --get <productid> all\n\n\n*Create a file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-local-tweaks.conf, or however you want to name it.\nYou may have to create the /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ directory. That's the new proper place to put these configuration files – no longer /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/ as mentioned in the other answer from 2010.\n\n*Fill the file with the options to configure it. You would insert them as \"Option\" lines into a framework like below:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"local wacom tablet tweaks\"\n\n    # Product to configure – supply your own product identifier.\n    MatchProduct \"Serial Wacom Tablet WACf00c\"\n\n    # Driver to use for this device.\n    # (Identical to the default, so not essential to mention.)\n    Driver \"wacom\"\n\n    # Configuration opttions to use – supply your own.\n    Option \"Gesture\" \"off\"\nEndSection\n\n", "Q: How can I change some of the system sounds?

I use to work at night and it is eye-hurting to watch at lightbulb-bright screens (I've got two - laptop's built-in panel and an external 18-inch CRT) in a dark environment. So I adjust my screens to be darker.\nCan I do this a software way instead of pressing monitors' buttons that many times every time?\n\nA: XRandR\nxrandr is very powerful but in this way similar to xgamma, also let you select the level for each three colors. For example\nxrandr --output HDMI2  --gamma 1:1:1\n                             # R G B\n\nWill set gamma to the default value (1 for each color channel). Select the appropriate output by choosing from one of the connected devices, listed with just xrandr (or xrandr | grep -vE \"^ \" | grep -v disconnect).\nNote: if you use Redshift or flux (closed-source) they will override xrandr setup.\nFrom man page:\n\n--gamma red:green:blue Set the specified floating-point values as gamma correction on the crtc currently attached to this output. Note that you cannot get two different values for cloned outputs (i.e.: which share  the  same  crtc)  and  that switching an output to another crtc doesn't change the crtc gamma corrections at all.\n--brightness brightness Multiply  the  gamma  values on the crtc currently attached to the output to specified floating value. Useful for overly bright or overly dim outputs.\nNote: his is a software only modification, if your hardware has support to actually change the brightness see this answer.\n\nAlso: How to change LCD brightness from command line (or via script)?\n\nA: The software you're looking for is Redshift (install):\n\nRedshift adjusts the color temperature of your screen according to your surroundings. This may help your eyes hurt less if you are working in front of the screen at night.\n\n\nA: Redshift\nI have been using this. It's very nice.\nsudo apt install redshift\n\nTo use it just type in the terminal redshift. \ngtk-redshift is just the GUI, not required.\n\nf.lux is also an option (proprietary, closed source).\n\nA: To adjust gamma (which is a good substitute for adjusting contrast), you can write:\nxgamma -gamma 0.3\n\non the command line (Terminal). You should see a very noticeable difference. Experiment with different values. \n1.0 is the normal (uncorrected) gamma value. Setting a lower gamma (for example 0.7) will increase the contrast of bright luminances, which makes midtones darker and decreases white washing. Setting a higher gamma (for example 1.5) will make midtones brighter and increase the contrast of dark luminances, but also increases white washing.\nFor my inexpensive laptop, I use gamma 0.8 to compensate for the too bright factory setting for the LCD and I find that the gamma correction helps with color reproduction too, which is nice because so far I haven't managed to get any color calibration working on this LCD.\n\nA: TL;DR\nUse:\n\n\n*\n\n*xbacklight\n\n*ddccontrol\n\n*redshift\n\n*xgamma\nBacklight vs pixel values\nFirst and most importantly, if at all possible adjust the display backlight, rather than using software correction of pixel values. If you dim the backlight you still get full or near-full dynamic range, giving you a clearer, \"deeper\" image that tends to be more readable.\nSoftware adjustment can't make the blacks darker, it just makes white greyer and reduces contrast. So instead of using pixel values from 0-255 it might use from 0-180 for example. Everything looks flatter.\nA tool like Redshift can be useful for changing colour balance, but as much as possible you should try to change brightness with backlight adjustment.\nDDC/CI\nLast I checked, most displays unfortunately do(did?) not implement backlight control from software. There's a standard for it, DDC/CI but adoption has been limited. Try the ddccontrol tool with your monitor and see if you have any luck.\nI've only seen it in very high end displays intended for calibrated photo and video work ... and even many of those use a USB connection and custom USB HID based driver instead of the DDC/CI standard. I'm pretty outdated though, and the linked article claims that basic options like brightness and contrast are widely supported now.\nFake brightness controls on cheap displays\nSome cheap displays don't support backlight control at all. The brightness controls on the display just adjust the pixel values on the LCD, just like software control does. Do not use these controls if you have such a monitor; it's usually better to do the correction in software, certainly no worse.\nDoesn't go dim enough?\nAll too many displays do have backlight control, but minimum brightness is still eye-searing. They can sometimes be modified, but otherwise your best bet is setting them to minimum backlight brightness and then living with changing pixel values to get them even dimmer.\nIt really annoys me that displays have such a limited backlight intensity range, often artifically and arbitrarily limited, starting at eye-searing to \"the power of a million suns\". I look for dim backlights when I'm speccing out displays to buy.\nLaptops\nOn a laptop, the backlight is usually controlled by software. Yay! \n(If your laptop is still old enough to use APM control instead of ACPI or custom drivers, get off my lawn).\nThe details are somewhat driver and software specific, but your laptop should offer convenient Fn keys that make it easy, and the OS should have a simple display brightness slider. The xbacklight utility offers a convenient command line control for this, though on my system it doesn't seem to like to go below 1% brightness and goes straight to black.\nI twiddle the driver controls because my T460 is very bright - wonderful during the day, but horrible at night. The minimum brightness step offered by the fn key adjustments is still way too bright, but the driver provides much finer grained control. xbacklight only lets me get down to brighness 8/255 and I'd like So I tell it to run at 4/255 brightness:\necho 4 | sudo tee -a  /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n\nThis works on a Lenovo T460 with Intel graphics, but other drivers and hardware may have different entries under /sys/class/backlight with different range limits etc.\nThe arch wiki has some useful info.\nGamma adjustment\nWhen you lower brightness you might want to increase contrast in software a bit, especially if working on text. It'll cost you image quality, but gain you readability at low brightness. The xgamma utility will let you do that, e.g.\nxgamma -gamma 0.8\n\nSomeone want to patch Redshift with brightness controls?\nSo, you know what'd be cool?\nIf Redshift could fade display brightness based on an ambient light sensor and/or time of day, via the same xrandr controls used by xbacklight.\n\nA: To those who have problem with brightness configuration after installing Ubuntu 10.10 and  are using Acer Aspire 4741, here's a solution for you:\ngksu gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nChange the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\" into GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"acpi_osi=Linux\"\nsudo update-grub\n\nRestart your linux\n\nA: These days there's an additional solution that is very much like Redshift: it's available as a built-in feature in the GNOME desktop environment.\nJust go to Settings → Displays and turn Night Light on. It lets you tweak the settings too:\n\n\nA: You can always do Windows-M or Windows-N.  The first inverts colors of all windows showing, the second does it to the current window in focus.\nReally helps when reading PDFs with tired eyes\n\nA: The title of your question suggests you are looking for a generic tool to adjust brightness/contrast and gamma of your desktop. The body of your question suggests you are looking for automatic adjustment matching the time of day. I was looking for an answer to the first variant and found only xcalib, a command-line utility. Thus I have written a gui front-end for xcalib, which can be found on https://github.com/Ablinne/kolorcontrol.\nIt provides sliders for brightness/color and gamma for red/green and blue channels respectively. It will display the commands for an autostart script.\n\nA: Eyesome Update\nA new version called eyesome has been created. It allows per monitor setup for:\n\n*\n\n*Hardware or Software Brightness control\n\n*Gamma control\n\nUp to 3 concurrent monitors are supported.\n\nOriginal Post\nIf you have a laptop you can control the backlight brightness. When you suspend and resume or reboot the last setting is automatically restored in Ubuntu 16.04. With Ubuntu 14.04 and earlier you sometimes had to write your own scripts to restore the brightness else it would be full brightness and fry your eyeballs.\nThe basic problem with a default Ubuntu 16.04 installation is you need to adjust brightness lower starting at sunset and adjust it higher after sunrise. To automate the process I developed this bash script: Automatically adjust display brightness based on sunrise and sunset\nKey Features\n\n*\n\n*Automatically get sunrise and sunset times each day with cron.\n\n*Start display-auto-brightness automatically every boot with cron.\n\n*Set different daytime and nighttime brightness settings.\n\n*Set different transition length in minutes after sunrise and before sunset. Usually 60 to 120 minutes.\n\n*Brightness adjusts every minute for transparent unnoticeable operation.\n\n*Instant/transparent brightness adjustment resuming from suspend.\n\nFuture Development\n\n*\n\n*Plans for software controls of External Monitors that do not have ambient light sensors by using xrandr.\n\n*Plans for Windows 10 support when Ubuntu on Bash on Windows (WSL) is installed along with VcXsrv and Ubuntu Desktop GUI in Windows 10.\n\n\nA: I really like the xcalib calibration tool.

Perhaps it didn't download from the internet correctly, or perhaps it wasn't quite burnt to disc correctly (this sometimes happens if you burn it too fast).\nTo find out if a \"disc error\" is your problem, you can find out the md5sum. For an .iso on your desktop you do this by running: md5sum ubuntu-5.04-dvd-i386.iso (obviously insert your file name into that command). You can compare this with the correct md5sums from the Ubuntu website.

If you're experiencing this over a wired connection then something else is in play here.\nUntil Network Manager is fixed (it shuts down wifi connections too quickly - before any of the init scripts are triggered), the only feasible workaround I could find is to use AutoFS.\nParaphrased from http://www.howtoforge.com/accessing_windows_or_samba_shares_using_autofs\nsudo apt-get install autofs\n\nCreate /etc/auto.cifs with these file contents :\n#!/bin/bash\n# $Id$\n# This file must be executable to work! chmod 755!\nkey=\"$1\"\n# Note: create a cred file for each windows/Samba-Server in your network\n#       which requires password authentification.

In your case, your server is called \"Server\", so create the relevant file with gksudo gedit /etc/auto.smb.Server.  Then put this into that file :\nusername=myusername\npassword=mypassword\n\n(obviously editing the fields as required).\nThen you'll need to make sure that this file is only readable by root with sudo chmod 600 /etc/auto.smb.Server.\nThen restart autofs as above and try browsing /smb/Server - you should see a list of your shares.\nIf you connect using an IP address, you'll need to repeat this process for /etc/auto.smb.192.168.1.10 or whatever.\n\nA: You should use the guide which shows you how to make an unmount shutdown script and make sure that it's still switch on. Upgrades or updates could theoretically have knocked it off it's perch. Check that your script is in /etc/rc0.d and that it's named S01smb_umount or similar so it runs as the first order of business.\nOtherwise you may end up with it unmounting the samba drive normally (waiting, waiting) and then running your script.

There's a way to safely try KDE on top of an Ubuntu installation, keeping the possibility to revert the changes in case I dislike how it runs?\n\nA: Just install it...\n\nsudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop \n\nAt login (after entering your username) you can select which one you want to boot (gnome/kde/xfce/...) so it's always possible to go back to gnome, even without rebooting.\n\nA: Maybe http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/kde can help you.\nJust install Kubuntu Plasma Desktop system on your computer through the software center.\nTo uninstall it follow the instructions given here:\nhttp://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/puregnome\n\nA: The absolute safest way to do that is to install it on a separate partition, but that's probably more work than you need.\nWhat I'd recommend is to install Kubuntu. I'm not sure if that's really what you meant when you said \"KDE on top of an Ubuntu installation\", but Kubuntu is little more than KDE+Ubuntu. Just do:  \n\nsudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop \n\non any terminal window (it will install a ton of kde packages). By the end, you'll get prompted if you want to use gdm or kdm as login manager. It's OK to choose either one, but kdm will give you the full Kubuntu experience.\nNext time you boot, just before logging in, choose KDE as your session manager. It will use the same $HOME and the same root folder, and thus you'll still have all the same programs installed, and their respective settings will be kept. I might be wrong, but I think only the settings stored under ~/.gnome2/ won't be loaded by KDE (they are gnome settings after all). \n\nFinally, you don't really need to remove KDE after that. You can keep using gnome regularly, and never choose KDE again in the session manager. If, for some reason, you do want to really remove KDE (maybe you need to free up space), here's what you do:\n\nsudo apt-get purge kubuntu-desktop\n\nkubuntu-desktop is a dummy package (you'll notice the removal process will be quick), removing this package will make apt consider all of the kde packages as unnecessary (since they were brought along by this one), so just do:  \n\nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge\n\nIf you chose to keep gdm as your login manager, you can stop here. If you happened to choose kdm as your login manager back in the first step, you'll have to either reinstall gdm (it's technically already installed, so you can just reconfigure it if you know how) sudo apt-get install --reinstall gdm or reinstall kdm again sudo apt-get install kdm. \n\nEDIT According to @AnwarShah the method above for removing Kubuntu doesn't actually work. I don't have an Ubuntu machine on which to test that right now, so I'll just provide an alternative method.   \nThe command provided in this answer, should purge all traces of kde from your system. Before running it you should read all of the packages and make sure none of them had been previously installed by you! Make sure to remove the name of any packages you want to keep. \n(Also, I haven't read through all of those packages, so I can't garantee anything regarding the commands effectiveness.)\nAlternatively, you could keept track of all packages installed when you install kubuntu-desktop, and then just do apt-get purge on these packages. This requires the forethought of copying the list of packages back when you installed kubuntu-desktop (and remembering where you saved it), but it's a little safer to do.\n\nA: Run it in a VM?\nOr try a Live CD.\n\nA: My choice (since refurbished systems are really cheap ~ $200) build a test-bench with these! I have several test-bench systems that I install on - before installing or upgrading critical systems.

Evolution seems to be able to sync the contact list information in Pidgin with its address book.

Mapping melikecandycoveredfrogs.com to 'http://myip/' does not make any sense. \nFor your domain to use your IP, you need to set an A record for specifying your IP.\nIn case you have a dynamic IP, I suggest you to use DynDNS, and use whatever method of updating the IP to the hostname, and then set your domain's CNAME record to the hostname of your DynDNS domain you use.\n\nA: Are you running ssh http://melikecandycoveredfrogs.com or\nssh melikecandycoveredfrogs.com?

If you used the \"Create a Startup Disk\" option from the Ubuntu menu, then try using unetbootin instead, it sometimes works when the Startup Disk Creator doesn't.\nIf it boots, select \"Verify Disc\" (Can't remember the exact name) to check that your ISO is valid. If this works, install again. If your boot-USB-stick does not pass the test, then download the ISO again, as it may have been corrupted. (You can check the ISO on-disk using the md5sum command and comparing it to md5 sums you find on the Ubuntu web page - google is your friend)\n\nA: Be sure to MD5 test the ISO you put on the USB stick\n\nA: Did you completely 'wipe' your computer with DBAN < http://www.dban.org/ >? If not, download and burn this program to a disk. Then set your BIOS to open first with your DVD drive and restart your computer with this DBAN disk in place.\nAfter several hours (depending on the size of your hard drive), your computer will be totally 'wiped' and you can then place your Ubuntu disk in your drive and restart your computer.\nIf everything is okay, Ubuntu should install normally.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How to make a bootable ISO image from a bootable DVD? I want to make a .iso image of a bootable OS DVD, to use in VirutalBox.  \nNautilus can make a .iso, but only of data files, it seems.\nThe .iso it created was not bootable.\nWhat is available to make a bootable .iso from a bootable DVD?  \n\nA: You can use Brasero to copy a CD to an .iso. It can be installed by sudo apt install brasero.\nSelect the option to copy a CD, select the CD drive as the source, and an image file as the target...\n \nOr from inside Nautilus: go to \"Computer\", right-click on the CD drive, and select \"Copy Disc...\".  (Or something like that, I'm using a local language system here.)\n\nA: First up, you can give VMs access to the host's DVD drive in VBox, this is done where you would normally add an ISO as a drive.\nIf this doesn't suit you, try ISO Master, available through apt/synaptic. It has some nice advanced features for ripping the boot sector out of existing DVD/CDs and adding that boot sector image to an ISO.\nThat said, ripping an image of the ISO with ISO Master should take the boot sector intact, and you won't need to transfer it manually.\n\nA: I don't have the exact syntax handy, but the dd command can copy the contents of the DVD bit for bit, and the resulting .iso file should be bootable for a VM.  Haven't tried this in this direction, though I have used dd to copy an ISO to a USB stick with success.  I normally keep the .iso files I download so I can recreate a USB stick or CD/DVD when needed.  \n\nA: Here is how to do this with default tools from the command line:\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert the DVD and run mount in the terminal to see the designation of the DVD drive. Most often this is /dev/sr0.\n\n*Run sudo dd if=/dev/sr0 of=filename.iso bs=2048 to copy the DVD to filename.iso.\n\n\nIf you get errors when copying with dd you can try ddrescue.\n\nA: A bit late to the party, but since the accepted Answer's Brasero is no longer installed by default (or not under that name), the next best thing with vanilla ubuntu is the \"Disks\" utility.

Is this true? Would I benefit from a defrag every now and then? If so, what tools are best?\n\nA: The linux kernel and linux filesystems do a lot of things to minimize fragmentation, but it's not true that fragmentation isn't possible.  The amount of fragmentation is dependent on the type of usage of a filesystem (as Jeremy points to the Transmission bugtracker, large torrents can be an example of \"bad\" behaviour for fragmentation, depending on how applications work with them).  In general, it doesn't get really bad normally, unless you manage to almost fill up your disk.\nOh, and you get the best defragmentation by copying everything to another filesystem, deleting the old filesystem, and then copying everything back.  That's also true on Windows...  ;)\nActually, you can do the copy + delete trick on the same filesystem too, but remember that you need to make a copy, then delete the old one, and not do a move/rename!\n\nA: The ext3 and ext4 filesystem do not need to be defragged, since they defragment themselves.\nYou can read this for more information: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext3#Disadvantages (if it's necessary)\n", "Q: How to upgrade subversion to v1.6.13? What is the best way to upgrade subversion to 1.6.13 on ubuntu 10.04 LTS?\nUbuntu 10.04 ships subversion 1.6.6 and important bug fix has been done for 1.6.13.\n\nA: If you absolutely need 1.6.13 now, then I suspect you would either have to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Compile it from source - ask for it if you want more details.\n\n*Download and execute a script from WANDisco.\n\n\nBoth of these ways will probably be harder to maintain than necessary though.\nWhat I would suggest would be to use the subversion ppa; its objective is to hold a (relatively) recent release of subversion. As of today, the version of subversion in that ppa does not fix the bug (CVE-2010-3315) that you are referring to (it is fixed by either 1.6.12dfsg-2 or 1.6.13).

But my major requirement is I could get other server into production if the main server gets down/corrupted. Is it possible to configure DRBD so that any changes made on primary server to '/' are replicated to secondary server?.\nEDIT:\nDear Experts:\nI have a Ubuntu server which hosts apache, tomcat, mysql, ldap and so on. I don't know how to say... like if this server gets corrupted or malfunctions I should immediately get another system with same databases applications, services, files and directories (just like a clone) into working. I wondering if there is something like primary and secondary which replicate (entire system) each other and if in case the primary server fails I can immediately come up with the secondary. \nI'm not only talking about DRBD it might be any third party tool that meets my entire requirement. I have to do this by the time assigned to me.  Somehow you try to understand what I'm in need of and put an end to this\nThank you!\n\nA: Replicating the entire system in a high-availability scenario is probably not a good idea, for two reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*There are a few configuration parameters that are unique to each server: for example, the hostname and IP address, possibly the mapping of DRBD devices to disks.  Setting the system up so that it can choose the correct configuration based on some \"environmental\" parameter (e.g., CPU serial number) is definitely more trouble than it's worth.\n\n*One of the advantages that High-availability setups give you, is the ability to do system upgrades without service downtime: you upgrade the \"backup\" system, test that it works, exchange the \"primary\" and \"backup\" roles, upgrade the former primary system.  If something goes bad, you still have at least one system up and running. Setting up an automated entire system replication voids this procedure: if you upgrade one system, the other gets upgraded too: you likely cannot do that while the service is running, and you loose the \"disaster-recovery\" feature.\nThat said, it is possible to replicate exactly the parts of the system you need to have a \"hot spare\" for the production systems, ready to kick in in case the primary server goes down.  \nThe exact details of how you do this depend on the service you want to run (www? mysql? nfs?), but the general idea is: replicate configuration and mutable data.  For example, assuming you want to have an highly-available NFS server, you can proceed like the following (on both servers):\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up a replicated DRBD disk and mount it on /nfs on both servers (primary and backup).\n\n*Create directories /nfs/etc and /nfs/data\n\n*Symlink /etc/export to /nfs/etc/export and make it export the /nfs/data filesystem to clients.\n\n*Have the NFS service managed by heartbeat, instead of by the system init/upstart daemon, so that it goes up and down according to the server role (primary or backup) and the availability of the DRBD disk.\nThis is rather sketchy, but should be enough to get you started.\n\nA: You may consider combining drdb with virtualization.  More info can be found here.\nFor example, you can create a xen VM that uses a drbd backed disk.\n", "Q: How is the Magic Trackpad's Battery Life (with Ubuntu) What are other peoples experiences are with the battery life of the Apple Magic Trackpad using Ubuntu?\nI think I've emptied included batteries after about two weeks usage for five days a week, eight hours a day. I don't know for sure because there's no battery level indicator, but I guess it's empty because it doesn't connect to the computer anymore.\nAre there other people who use it as their main pointing device? How long do your batteries last? :-)\nedit Dec. 2, 2010\nAllright, now I always turn the trackpad off when not using it. The batteries lasted  5-6 weeks this way, much better than the initial two weeks.\n\nA: The included batteries lasted five weeks in my usage. The device has been on at least eight hours a day. I expect quality rechargeable batteries to last more. There seems to be no way to know if it's going into a reduced power mode when not in use, but it doesn't seem to.\nIf upon holding down the power button, the green light goes on, stays lit for a second and immediately goes off without blinking, that's an indication that the batteries are dead. \n\nA: There's no reason that using Ubuntu of instead Mac OS X (or Windows for that matter), should affect how long your batteries last. This is because the Magic Trackpage does not \"run Ubuntu software\" on the device itself.\nHowever - two weeks seems very poor... there are people on the internet expressing dissappointment with four or six weeks. I imagine it depends on the batteries you use though.\n", "Q: How do I add shadow to my Gnome Menu Bar? I reinstalled Ubuntu 10.10 with Compiz and have suddenly lost the gradient shadow on my gnome menu bar (Top), I was wondering how can I get it back?\nI already have the value of \"any\" set in Window decorations and the shadow is applied to windows, but just not the gnome bar.\nI'm running the theme Ambiance with the faneza icon set\n\nA: I found out that shadow isn't applied on my gnome top bar because I had disabled desktop icons, no idea why that would be, but instead of disabling desktop icons completly I decided to just disable generated icons for my mounted volumes.\n\nA: Reload the panel with $ killall gnome-panel. When it reloads it will be picked up by Compiz and given a shadow.\n", "Q: Is there a way to get the administrator lock opened? I know that when a package is being installed, the root directory [I think?] gets an administrator lock and can't make an other installation at the same time. \nIs there a way to stop that installation? If it is so, is it good to do?\nI heard that it is better to leave the package to get installed and then try removing it. Is that true?\n\nA: When you run a software installation command (e.g., aptitude, apt-get, synaptic or the Ubuntu Software Centre), the file /var/lib/dpkg/lock is locked to prevent several instances of the command to run concurrently.  The reason to do this is that software installation has to modify vital system files, and concurrent modification may result in some changes not being applied or -worse- in corrupted files.\nAlthough the dpkg package installation system used in Debian and Ubuntu is quite robust and will do the right thing even if an installation is canceled or interrupted, it is usually safer to let the installation finish and then remove the installed package afterwards.\n", "Q: What is the difference between \"man\" and \"info\" documentation? Regarding man-pages and info help documentation:  \nWhy do two such similar sources of documentation exist?\nSometimes a man-page is available and the info is not; or vice-versa.\nI haven't yet latched on to the rhyme and reason behind it.\nMaybe there is a significant difference between them, but even if there is, why do they both exist?  It seems like unnecessary doubling up.\n\nA: Info is the default format for documentation inside the GNU project, man is the much older traditional format for UNIX.\nInfo uses Texinfo as its source format, which is a bunch of macros for TeX, and that makes it much easier to also create \"good-looking\" printed versions or PDFs.\nGenerally, manpages are more about 1 specific topic (a command, a config file, a system function, ...) while info normally has more the structure of a combined manual, more like a book.\n\nA: man uses less to display the manual page which in turn uses vim keybindings while info uses emacs keybindings and standard emacs commands for search, quitting etc.\n\nA: Man pages are the UNIX traditional way of distributing documentation about programs.  The term \"man page\" itself is short for \"manual page\", as they correspond to the pages of the printed manual; the man pages \"sections\" (1 for commands, 2 for system calls, etc.) correspond to sections in the full UNIX manual.  Support is still there if you want to print a man page to paper, although this is rarely done these days, and the sheer number of man pages make it just impossible to bind them all into a single book.\nIn the early '90s, the GNU project decided that \"man\" documentation system was outdated, and wrote the info command to replace it: info has basic hyperlinking features and a simpler markup language to use (compared to the \"troff\" system used for man pages).  In addition, GNU advocates against the use of man pages at all and contends that complex software systems should have complete and comprehensive documentation rather than just a set of short man pages.  \nThere are actually other documentation systems in use, besides man and info: GNOME and KDE have their own, HTML-based system, etc.\nIn the end, the form in which you get documentation depends on the internal policies of the project that provided the software in the first place -- there is no globally accepted standard.\n", "Q: Recommendations for a Windows Media Centre substitute? Are there any suggestions for media centre that can be used on Ubuntu 10.10? I need a media centre which works as same as the Windows Media Centre, but I can drop the online shows =)\n\nA: You should take a look at Moovida \n\nA: I recommend XBMC (Ubuntu Install from PPA Instructions).  It has options for a live-cd install, or can be installed as an application on Ubuntu.  It is extremely configurable, but beautiful and functional out of the box.  Of course, it has full LIRC support.  It is skinnable, so can look like anything ranging from Windows Media Centre through to Apple's simplistic Front Row.\nIt supports \"Series\" information - put all your Grey's Anatomy episodes inside a \"Grey's Anatomy\" folder and tell XMBC that it's a TV show folder, XMBC will then scan the internet for information on the show, setting the folder up with a custom logo and cast information.  Similarly for any movies you have digital copies of.\nIt also support VDPAU, which will give Nvidia card owners full hardware acceleration.  This is crucial for boxes like the Acer Revo (Google product search), which features Nvidia's ION chipset - without VDPAU support, that device's Atom processor wouldn't be capable of 1080p output.\nIt doesn't integrate any form of live TV to my knowledge, so if you need to integrate your tv-tuner card, then you're better of with perhaps MythTV or Mythbuntu instead.\n\nA: Why not Boxee? You can find it here, download is possible after registration, both 32 and 64 bit debs are available.\n\nA: If you require TV checkout MythTV, if not XBMC. Depending on your hardware, you may decide that you want to avoid using a window manager entirely. You should probably do some research...\n", "Q: gedit plugin development in C I'm interesting in writing gedit plugins in C. I've checked the Gedit/NewMDIPluginHowTo but I find it not good to start.\nWhere can I get more information about writing gedit plugins in C?\n\nA: Maybe you can start from the sources of existing plugins that you can find here:\nhttps://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gedit-plugins\nTry to compile and hack some existing plugin and you will build more experience to create your own one :)\n", "Q: Print numbered arguments in Command Line Tool Is there a packaged program that shows command line arguments?  I often find it helpful to have users run this type of program to either help them understand what their shell commands do, or to get clearer, less ambiguous feedback (e.g. when I can't see their screen and we're communicating online with paste sites).\nI've written the below script in Python, which works, but I'd find it easier to tell people a Ubuntu package they can grab rather than explain how write to a file, chmod +x, and change their system (e.g. maybe they don't have ~/bin setup in PATH, ...).\nI'd be happy to see a command-line sed/awk/perl/etc. script to do this functionality as well, even if it's ugly.  (\"If\"... doing this in one-line will be ugly.)\nAny solution needs to have somewhat similar results to this script; which are, in English: print each argument with a number (escaping problematic characters is just a bonus).\n#!/usr/bin/env python2.6\nimport sys\n\nif len(sys.argv) == 1:\n  print \"No args!\"\nelse:\n  args = enumerate(sys.argv)\n  args.next()  # skip program name\n  for i, v in args:\n    r = repr(v)\n    if v.strip() != v or v != r[1:-1]:\n      v = r + \"\\t(repr)\"\n    print \"%3d: %s\" % (i, v)\n\n\nA: My solution (you already know ;) as a function (no need to deal with PATH) to become one-liner:\nshowargs() { i=1; for f; do printf \"arg%d: <%s>\\n\" $i \"$f\"; ((i++)); done; }\n\n\nA: This is particularly easy and useful in Bash.  This guide at IBM walks through the use of $@, $#, $1, $2, etc. and has a nice testargs.sh script (see listings 7 and 8) that does something like you're looking for: it shows users what arguments and options they've entered.\n", "Q: Can someone recommend an Exif editor? Anyone knows a good exif editor for ubuntu? I need some simple functions like importing and exporting exif infos from a picture, copying exif info from one picture to another.\nI'd prefer a gtk+ application, better if stand alone and not a function integrated in photo manager.\n\nA: exiftool is also very powerful.\nExiftool\n\nA: Phatch\nI mostly use Phatch. It does handle metadata but it's aimed at batch processing so it's particularly good for workflow.\nsudo apt install phatch\n\n\nA: I use jhead for simple EXIF extractions but I believe it is capable of transferring EXIF information from one image file to another. I am not aware of an appropriate GUI.\nSome people prefer ExifTool.\n\nA: I use exiv2 to extract and fix EXIF data via the CLI, and Digikam to edit exif data in single images visually.\n\nA: Being ExifTool the most powerful tool around (unfortunately no-gui), this could be a solution: pyExifToolGUI: https://hvdwolf.github.io/pyExifToolGUI/\nYou could find a convenient package for Ubuntu in this PPA:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~ferramroberto/+archive/ubuntu/lffl\nHope this helps,\n\nA: Perhaps you could use jBrout for some aspects of Exif manipulation.  I've written about this here : http://www.scaine.net/site/2010/01/jbrout/\nI'm not convinced that it can copy Exif from one photo to another - you're better off with Phatch for that, as mentioend by outofstep.

Vertical space is a recurring issue, usually solved by maximising/fullscreening a window or, by setting visual effects to normal with the workspace switcher having an extra row (window across two workspaces).\nNeither of these workarounds work for the calendar screen of Evolution. All the other screens act the way they are supposed to (mail, contacts, preferences, etc).\nWhenever i try clicking anywhere on the calendar, including the min/max/close the entire window jumps up or down, making it impossible to select anything, forcing me to restart evolution just to get back to my inbox. I suspect the problem is in the dayview area.\nSo... how do i fix this?\n\nA: Unfortunately, I have experienced this bug as well, ever since the early Maverick beta stages. \nThis is an old bug (see here on the Launchpad), which isn't solved at the moment. A possible \"workaround\" is to launch Evolution in Express mode with evolution --express\n", "Q: How do software updates work? I would like to know how software updates work for my Ubuntu Server 10.10.\nI have been recommended to use apt-get install for installing new software and apt-get update for updating software for a Ubuntu Server in production use. Because these packages are tested for Ubuntu in contrast to download source code and compile the software on the box.\nBut on my Ubuntu Server 10.10, I don't get the latest stable version of PostgreSQL (9) or the latest stable version of Nginx (8) using apt-get install. So how is this working, will these software be updated when I later run apt-get update or do I have to later run apt-get install again, or do I have to wait for the next release of Ubuntu to get them?\nAnd are patches and security updates managed in the same way? Or can they be updated automatically? If there is such a setting, how do I check what my system is using?\n\nA: With apt-get you will only received the latest version that the Ubuntu team supports. If it is not your desired version, you will also not receive it with this release as there will be no major version upgrade within a release.\nSo you either have to wait for a new Ubuntu release and hope they upgrade your package or build and install it yourself manually. With the loss of automatic updates as well.\nYou could also try to find the newest version in the Debian unstable branch or wait for Ubuntu to implement Backports for Maverick.\n\nA: For your information, sudo apt-get update does not update software. It merely updates the list that the APT package manager uses to keep track of the software installed on the system, and the software available for the system from Ubuntu's repositories.\nThe correct procedure for updating to the latest version available in the repositories is to run sudo apt-get update to update the available software list, and then sudo apt-get  upgrade to actually install the new versions of the packages.\nIt's worth noting that the versions in the repositories might be slightly outdated: this is typically because this is the only version Canonical is supporting for this release of Ubuntu, or because no-one's uploaded the new version to the repositories yet. You're welcome to install more recent software manually or using Personal Package Archives (PPAs.)\n\nA: Ubuntu has a policy where (usually) only small security fixes to programs will be updated in the Ubuntu repositories (that you access through apt-get).\nThis is to ensure maximum stability in production enivronments - this is particularly important on servers. This means you won't see version updates to software such as PostgreSQL and Nginx until Ubuntu Server 11.04 is released.\nYou can find out information on the Ubuntu wiki about Stable Releases Updates.\n", "Q: Windows 7 style live previews Is it possible to get windows 7 style live previews of what a window is doing, when it is hovered over? \nfor instance, when i hover over a video player on windows 7, i can see the video playing in the preview.\nSomething that works on the gnome panel would be good, but even better would be a docky or awn implementation?\nThanks for any help.\n\nA: Compiz (the default effects engine that can be turned on) has had a Window Previews plugin since well-before Windows 7 was around. It just provides a preview for a window. It doesn't stack them and it only works for windows that aren't minimised (although I think there are some hacks to get around that).\nTo enable it, turn on compiz:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click the desktop\n\n*Click Change Desktop Background\n\n*Select the Visual Effects tab\n\n*Use Normal or Extra\n\n\nExtra may turn this on by default (I don't want to test it as I like my current compiz settings). Test it by hovering over a running program.\nIf it doesn't you want the CompizConfig Settings Manager (sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager). Once installed, load it from the System -> Preferences menu.\nUse the filter box to search for \"preview\" and turn the option on by checking the checkbox.

I use Ubuntu Server 10.10 and I would like to set up a web server environment with NginX, PHP 5.3.3, PostgreSQL and preferably APC and PHP Suhosin.\nI have already set up PostgreSQL with apt-get install postgresql and Nginx with apt-get install nginx.\nBut how do I set up PHP for these? Can I do this using apt-get install or do I have to download the sources and compile it? I would prefer to do it using apt-get.\nI would likte to use PHP-FPM for Nginx. Most of the tutorials I have found on Internet are old and compile the PHP, but this is not recommended for production servers.\nHow do I easiest set up PHP with Nginx, APC and PostgreSQL? or at least PHP-FPM + Nginx?\n\nUPDATE\nI have now installed a fresh Ubuntu Server 10.10 and executed the command Peter suggested with php5-suhosin added. After that Nginx works fine, then I edit the generated confiugration file to be as below. After reloading the new config file, Nginx still works fine using a index.html file, but when I add a index.php file it stop to work. I guess that this has to do with PHP-FPM, the APC or something PHP-related. But it could be the configuration file for PHP-FPM as well.\nHere is the configuration file for Nginx that I'm using, most of it is generated by default.

If so, delete it with an sudo apt-get remove apache2 to avoid apache and nginx competing for port 80.\nNote also that xdebug standard also wants to use port 9000, just like php5-fpm.

Accidently I choosed to generate a new random MAC-address for my Ubuntu machine in VirtualBox. And now when I have booted my Ubuntu with the new MAC-address, I don't get an external IP-address. I'm using DHCP to get IP-addresses.\nI guess I have to run a command and inform my Ubuntu system that the MAC-address has changed to get an external IP-address.\nIf I execute sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart I get this message:\nSIOCSIFADDR: No such device\neth0: ERROR while getting interface flags: No such device\neth0: ERROR while getting interface flags: No such device\nBind socket to interface: No such device\nFailed to bring up eth0\n\nHow can I solve this?\n\nA: Since your mac address have changed you no longer have an interface called eth0, this name is reserved for an interface with the \"old\" mac-address. The \"new\" interface should have the next free name (eg. ethN).\nTo see all the interfaces on the machine you can use this command: ifconfig -a\nIf you want to reset the name reservations for network interfaces you can remove the file /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules and restart the machine (or remove/insert the device, though this is not possible in this case).\nAlternatively you can change the interface-name that you have configured to what ever the new one is called by changing all occurences of the old name with the new one in the file /etc/network/interfaces\n\nA: I guess you are using static IP on your ubuntu host. \nSince you have changed the MAC address, the ubuntu will create a new \"eth\" for you instead of using the old one.\nModify the file /etc/sysconfig/networks/ifcfg-eth0 to ifcfg-eth1 or setup a static configuration using network manager.\n\nA: First in VM Guest create a file named newfile:\nsudo nano /etc/init.d/newfile with two lines:\n#!/bin/bash\nsudo ifup eth0\n\nnext, from console:\nsudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/newfile\nsudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/newfile \nsudo update-rc.d newfile defaults\n\nI used this solution because eth0 is down after reboot with static IP (with DHCP work fine).\nmy /etc/network/interfaces:\n    # The loopback network interface\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.10\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nbroadcast 192.168.1.255\ngateway 192.168.1.1\nnameservers 192.168.1.1\n\n(sorry for my english)\n", "Q: How can I configure a service to run at startup I have a daemon that runs fine if I start it manually with the service command:\nricardo@ricardo-laptop:~$ sudo service minidlna start                   \n * Starting minidlna minidlna                                                              [ OK ] \n\nbut it's not configured to auto start when the PC reboots. \nHow can I configure it to start automatically, even if no one is logged into the PC?\n\nA: Since Ubuntu 15.10 and newer (resp. Debian 8 \"jessie\" and newer), you have to use the following command to configure your service minidlna to run at startup:\nsudo systemctl enable minidlna.service\n\nAnd to disable it again from starting at boot time:\nsudo systemctl disable minidlna.service\n\nThis works with all service names available on your system.

Now, the laptop don't recognize when the power is plugged off so the screen etc. is not dimmed. It still makes a sound when power is plugged in and taken out but I suspect that this is not through Ubuntu. I have tried uninstall of the tools and, of cause, rebooting - but nothing helps. I'm not a pro with Linux so some expertise would be appreciated.

I use Ubuntu Server 10.10 and have installed Nginx web server with apt-get install nginx. It creates a default web page at /var/www/nginx-default/ and that directory has the permissions drwxr-xr-x 2 root root.\nWhen I access the default site on http://localhost/ I get this message on the page 403 Forbidden.\nHow should I set the file permissions on the www root so I can secure access the web pages? Or is there something else that I have to change?\n\nA: I would suggest changing the group of your webroot to www-data, the user used by nginx and also php5-fpm.\nFor example:\nsudo chown -R \"$USER\":www-data /webdirectory\nsudo chmod -R 0755 /webdirectory\n\nwhere my-user is your own account (which enables you to put the files easy in your webroot without sudo).\n\nA: I usually stick to a 755 (or rwxr-xr-x) on my web root, but I do not think this is the issue you're running into since your directory is already set to that.  nginx should have access to your directory.  The question then becomes the permissions (or existence of) the file you're trying to access.  The files within your directory will need to be readable by the user nginx is running as.  I usually leave these files set to a 755 (the same as the directory).  You can change the entire directory by doing sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/nginx-default/.\nIf there is not an index file in the directory, however, you will still get the same error.  The index file is used when you request a directory that doesn't have directory listings enabled.  The most common index file is index.html.  This default can be edited in your config, however, using something like:\nlocation / {\n    index index.php;\n}\n\nIf you want nginx to generate a list of files in that directory for you, simply turn on directory indexing, like so:\nlocation  /  {\n  autoindex  on;\n}\n\n", "Q: What UML (Unified Modelling Language) tools are available? I just can't find a decent (and free) one. What can I use?\n\nA: Dia  can generate code into Java, PHP, C++ and many more, but you should install Dia2code  for generating code. I use it for creating UML and then generate the code of the classes.\n\nA: I use Papyrus, a suite developed by the Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique in France that is today available as a plug-in to Eclipse. It is the most advanced open source modelling tool I am aware of and supports UML2 almost entirely. Broad description:\n\nPapyrus is aiming at providing an integrated and user-consumable\n  environment for editing any kind of EMF model and particularly\n  supporting UML and related modeling languages such as SysML and MARTE.\n  Papyrus provides diagram editors for EMF-based modeling languages\n  amongst them UML 2 and SysML and the glue required for integrating\n  these editors (GMF-based or not) with other MBD and MDSD tools.\n\nMost importantly, Papyrus supports Model-Driven Development (MDD), being a pretty able tool to develop Domain Specific Languages. On this regard, Papyrus seems to be the only open source tool supporting the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) pattern issued by the OMG. With a code generator such as Acceleo you end up with a full MDD stack - from which you may even create your own DSL plug-ins.\n\n\nA: After a longe search in desktop apps I decided to go web, now I'm using Cacoo, which allow not only uml drawing but a lot of different drawing (like network topography, general stuff, etc).

It has some limitations and bugs, but it is the least annoying of UML editors out there. However, as Dia, it cannot generate code, I am just listing it in case you ever need a straight UML diagram creation tool. \n\nA: Visual Paradigm is a powerful commercial tool for UML. But you can use the community edition which is free (for not commercial use). The only restriction is that every hour close the program.\n\n\nA: So far Astah* is the best UML tool I've ever used. In my opinion, the drawing experience is better because it can automatically align or anchor the graphical elements in a smart enough way.\nThey used to provide a free community version but unfortunately they have stopped that support since 2018/09/26.\nHowever, its UML Editor provides a free version if you are a student.\n\nA: You can use diagrams.net (https://www.diagrams.net/).

I understand from Jono Bacon's blog that Ubuntu will be switching to Unity as the default desktop in the upcoming 11.04.\nWhat's not clear is \"Why?\". \nCould someone explain the benefits of Unity over GNOME 2.x or indeed GNOME 3.x so that people can be informed about this decision?\n\nA: This Arstechnica article based around an interview with Mark Shuttleworth (the founder of Ubuntu and Canonical) gives some reasons for going forward with Unity, as opposed to using the GNOME Shell.\nThe GNOME Shell is the major new component of GNOME 3, that many people are incorrectly referring to as simply 'GNOME 3'. Remember that future Ubuntu versions will still be based on GNOME 3 - the underlying infrastructure, applications, etc will not change - they just won't use the GNOME Shell by default.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu would like to embrace different ideas to other parts of the GNOME family -  specific examples mentioned are Mac OS X style global menus, and heavier 'Zeitgeist' integration.\n\n*There are concerns about hardware support with the Mutter technology GNOME Shell uses. Whilst Unity has up to now also used Mutter, Unity has been ported to Compiz, which, through its inclusion in default Ubuntu for over three years, has proved itself to have excellent hardware support.\n\n*Recent Ubuntu design work, such as Application Indicators and NotifyOSD are likely to be incompatible with GNOME Shell, and we want to keep these improvements, not move backwards!\n\n*Other distributions may have different user bases and needs. Ubuntu has a lot of home users, whereas many other distributions have more commercial users in workplaces. Canonical employs a lot of professional design experts and they may feel they can do a better job than, or at least take a different approach to, the existing GNOME Shell.\n\n\nA: This article at Arstechnica can maybe shed some light on this. \n\nI also asked Shuttleworth why Canonical is building its own shell rather than customizing the GNOME Shell. He says that Canonical made an effort to participate in the GNOME Shell design process and found that Ubuntu's vision for the future of desktop interfaces was fundamentally different from that of the upstream GNOME Shell developers.\n\nSo basically, the Ubuntu Guys think that their vision of how a desktop interface should be is too different from vision that GNOME has with GNOME Shell. So they don't try to adapt GNOME Shell to suit their needs but instead they develop something entirely new, Unity.\n\nA: GNOME3 (and GNOME Shell) was delayed, and as I understand it the GNOME devs are not receptive to Canonical's design wishes, hence Canonical are pushing on with their own GNOME shell. There's a Slashdot story about it, though how informed some of the commentors are remains to be seen...\n\nA: Canonical wants to step away from GNOME and those desktop environments to create their own new next-generation desktop, not just using something out of the box, which would be what they would be doing if they used GNOME 2x or GNOME 3 Shell.\n\nA: I have dualboot and so always compare ubuntu, gnome and win, just the GUI!!!\nIf you know win7 and then compare it with unity, you will see that there are not may differences. So, I don't think that unity is something entirely new. It is just compiz like before with a panel and a dock, which is the same like win7 taskbar, just with a global menu.\nWhy? Quicklists = Jumplists\nboth combine starter and tasks (or grouped windows)\nthe grid in unity and gnome 3 is the aero-something in win\nthe start menu of win7 startmenu can filter recent documents with mouse over the related app. Unity has nothing like this. \nthe Lenses in Unity are realy different and will have some good features in the future.\ngnome3 is realy a entirely new, next generation desktop. Unity just made its way into the present.\nMaybe Unity likes to make it easy for windows user to start in the Linux world while gnome3 is too different.\n", "Q: How can I make caff work with msmtp?

So far I'm only getting this error message:\nNo real MTA found, using ‘testfile’ at /usr/share/perl5/Mail/Mailer.pm line\n108.\n\nHave somebody use caff with msmtp???\n\nA: The error you are seeing comes from the PERL\nMail::Mailer\npackage.  Although Mail::Mailer supports sending e-mail directly with\nSMTP (thus, no sendmail binary needed), it defaults to using\nsendmail on Linux/UNIX and the only way to change that is through\nchange of the constructor parameters in the sources.\nSo, I can see only three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install an MTA that provides command-line sendmail emulation;\npackage msmtp-mta provides that on top of msmtp; other MTAs\nlike esmtp and\nnullmailer can also do\nthis.\n\n*Provide your own sendmail-emulation script that pipes input to msmtp; you can then direct Mail::Mailer to use that instead of the system-wide sendmail (see the Mail::Mailer doc for details):\nexport PERL_MAILERS=\"sendmail:/path/to/my/sendmail/wrapper\"\n\n\n*Change the caff sources to create the Mail::Mailer object as:\n$mailer = Mail::Mailer->new('smtp', Server => 'smtp.server.example.org');\n\ninstead of the default invocation that it is likely using now.\n", "Q: Minimal BASH-like line editing boot error I've tried a few links already and many of them have me do numerous commands and every command seems to return \"unknown command\"\nThis is freaking me out since I need to get files off of here and I did nothing (makes me worried to run Ubuntu now after just switching from Mac).

Or alternatively will Unity continue to be developed after GNOME Shell is ready. \nSimply: will 11.04 be a one-off release in having the Unity interface as default.\n\nA: As things stand today, every foreseeable Ubuntu release until the end of the GNOME 3.x series will feature GNOME 3.x, minus GNOME Shell. GNOME Shell is just one part of the GNOME stack. \nThis is GNOME Shell:\nhttp://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/\nThis is GNOME 3:\nhttp://live.gnome.org/ThreePointZero\n\nA: As in Ubuntu 10.10 (and 10.04), GNOME Shell will be available to install, and should be a first-class citizen.  The existing “GNOME 3” session you can select from the login screen will remain, and will continue to provide a close to standard upstream GNOME Shell experience.\nSo, while Unity will be the default experience, it will remain easy to use GNOME Shell (or the existing traditional 2D desktop) instead.\n\nA: My answers to this question can probably help clear this up for you.\n\nA: Nobody knows for sure, but it seems highly likely. From what Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu) said today it sounds like there is a push for polish towards the next LTS release. Based on that it seems highly likely Unity will be kept as the default interface until at least 12.04\n\nA: They are changing for Unity because they \"don't like the way Gnome Shell is taking\". I don't think that they will be coming back to it if that's what they think.\n\nA: I'm sure that will be consider at future UDSes. The Ubuntu devs will always consider what development have happen to make Ubuntu the best distro it can be.\n\nA: there are no info yet but it is confirmed that Unity will be default for desktop editions in Ubuntu 11.04 =) \nSources : Webupd8\n\nA: I think not \"only\". Ubuntu 10.04 LTS I can say best version. So... there are and there will be a lot of versions (10.04, 10.10) to use... I think it is OK about default interface 11.04, even next versions :)\n\nA: Actually, it seems they'll drop GNOME Shell and switch also the Desktop version to Unity.\nSee this article on Ars Technica.\n\nA: No. 11.04 will also have KDE, XFCE, etc. just as previous releases have.\n", "Q: Help on Netbook Launcher Can i install the netbook launcher together with existing desktop mode and unity mode ?\n\nA: Since the release of 10.10 then the netbook-launcher package is no longer available in the Ubuntu repositories.\nThis is because this old Ubuntu Netbook remix was superseded by Unity and the Ubuntu Netbook Edition. Because of this the Netbook Launcher is no longer maintained.\nYou may wish to see this bug report confirming what I have just said.\n", "Q: How to calibrate the monitor on an Ubuntu system?

I never figured out why it didn't work in the first place.\n\nA: Your Mac needs the grub-efi installed (with rEFIt), otherwise ubuntu starts with bios and then cannot recognize more than one core\n\nA: Usually if you only have 1 CPU then you should only see one CPU. Seeing two cores is something you normally see in /proc/cpuinfo but this doesn't have to be the case.\nSome Intel machines have bios settings for switching on the extra core duo core being treated like a separate cpu.

I have a Macbook 5,1. That is to say that it is the only 13 inch aluminium Macbook as the later revisions were renamed Macbook Pro.\nTwo-finger scrolling seems to work fine but dragging doesn't work. In OsX this works so that you point an object, click and keep your finger pressed on the touch pad while slide another finger to move the cursor. This causes weird and undefined behavior in Ubuntu as it seems the driver doesn't recognize this as dragging. Any ideas?\n\nA: Thumb-down dragging in Ubuntu Maverick on newer Macbook( Pro)s is currently supported only by the new, currently non-configurable, but quite functional independently written \"multitouch\" X input driver from the mactel PPA.  (Canonical hasn't written utouch support for MB(P)s yet.)\nFrom one of the official Macbook or MacBook Pro Maverick hardware support pages--\nTo enable the multitouch drivers, add the mactel ppa:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mactel-support && sudo apt-get update\n\nThen run this in a console:\nsudo apt-get install xf86-input-multitouch bcm5974-dkms\n\nThen add this to the new file /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-multitouch.conf (on Maverick and later) with the same permissions as the other files in the directory:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    MatchIsTouchpad \"true\"\n    Identifier \"Multitouch Touchpad\"\n    Driver \"multitouch\"\nEndSection\n\nYou can then get three-finger gestures working using mouse \"buttons\" 8, 9, 10, and 11 (use xev to view them) via imwheel (Ubuntu universe).  I'm going to finish that part another day, though xev is clearly showing the \"press\" of the \"buttons\" to indicate it's ready to be hooked up.\nTo see if this applies to your model, you should go to Ubuntu.com Help Community MacBook or MacBookPro page and find your system, or something close to it, for the Ubuntu version you are using (stick to the correct version!) in the grey box on the right at the top.  Currently, many of the systems have out-of-date or incomplete information.  However, Apple changes little between versions, so you'll be able to use information from almost any machine's page (read them all!).  The MacBook Pro 7,1 Maverick page has the most complete information for Maverick as far as I've seen, though the Maverick MBP 5,5, 5,3, and 6,2 pages also have info not found elsewhere that I needed.  That's where this information came from.\nMore info on PPAs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mactel wiki page\n\n*What are PPAs and how do I use them?\n\nA: Just have a look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookPro7-1/Maverick\nIt describes the necessary steps to get Ubuntu working, e.g.\n\ntwo-finger scrolling and horizontal\n  scrolling can be enabled through the\n  mouse preferences\n\nI'm using my Macbook with Ubuntu everyday. Though a small number of technical things on OSX still work better (faster WLAN connect, faster sleep/wakeup), I'm much more satisfied with the usability of Ubuntu, the package-management and the available open-source-software.\n\nA: The driver on my MacBook Air that was installed for 11.10 is called \"multitouch\" (perhaps it is the same one mentioned in another answer), but I had the same issue with not being able to use two finger click and drag.  I finally found the mtrack driver, which I found can be tweaked to behave nearly like the OS X driver, including two finger click and drag.\nSee my post here:  https://askubuntu.com/a/103030/43660  for instructions on how to install and configure mtrack.\n\nA: Have you tried using the utouch package? \nsudo apt-get install utouch\n\nIt is supposed to have extra support for multitouch pads.\n\nA: If you'd like to try 'mtrack'. You'll also need to map the mouse button to the key strokes that triggers something, e.g. switch workspace.\nThe next steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Either use 'xev' to detect the mouse button or 'mtrack''s readme file on github to make sure which gesture produces what button number, e.g. three finger swipe up is button number 8.\n\n*Install  xte, xbindkeys and xautomation to map the 'gesture' mouse key number to your desired keystrokes. After the installation, create user config file for xbindkeys use this line:\nxbindkeys --defaults > $HOME/.xbindkeysrc\nthen, put your configurations in the file, for example, in my case, two finger scroll up/down in xev has mouse button 4 and 5.\n# Scroll Up\n# it means xbindkeys will send arguments 'keydown Up' and 'keyup Up'\n# to xte when mtrack detects gesture 'two finger scroll up'\n\"xte 'keydown Up' 'keyup Up'\"\nb:4\n\n# Scroll Down    \n\"xte 'keydown Down' 'keyup Down'\"\nb:5\n\nAnother argument is 'key', it means 'keydown' + 'keyup'. And you may need to reboot several times to find the best keystrokes (this is what I apent for an entire afternoon, I got a load of gestures tho).\nPlease feel free to take my configuration as reference at here.

Thus, one way to generate the debsums file for those packages that are missing them is to apt-get install --reinstall them.\n\nA: The package \"debsums\" is what you want to install to perform hash checks against installed packages.\nFor example, to check for changed files:\nsudo debsums -c\n\nNote that not all packages ship with md5sum file lists. You can see a list of those on your system with:\nsudo debsums -l\n\n", "Q: Is it normal that mdadm has to start from scratch when I restart my computer while it's rebuilding the third disk?

As this was the first time you were (re)building them, all of them were only built for 60%, and none of them were marked as \"complete\".\n", "Q: How can I make my laptop \"phone home\" if it ever gets stolen? If my laptop ever gets stolen, I want it to make an attempt to \"phone home\" so that I can track it down.\nWhat can I set up to accomplish this?\n\nA: Prey is an open source program that does exactly what you want (it also happens to run all major operating systems, including Ubuntu of course).\nPrey lets you keep track of your phone or laptop at all times, and will help you find it if it ever gets lost or stolen. It's lightweight, open source software, and free for anyone to use. And it just works.\nOMG Ubuntu has an article on the program.

Maybe you should follow this launchpad entry:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/663524\n\nA: Simply put, right now you can't.\n\nA: If you merge the icon theme you want with humanity and humanity-dark icon themes in /usr/share/icons you can change the theme. I'm using Faenza icons with Unity right now and it looks nice. Just remember to backup the Humanity folder first and rename it.\n\nA: Faenza was missing icons, so I just merged it with Humanity.

This of course meant that my computer had to rebuild the whole thing from ground up.\nBefore I restarted the computer I've had already set up a file system, which cannot be found anymore.\nSo: Does building up the RAID (again) overwrite any information placed on the volume?\n\nA: It's best not to reboot your system until after the initial RAID sync has finished, but you should be able to create your LVM physical volumes (pvcreate /dev/md0 etc). If you've already done this and they're not showing up, it's possible that on restart the system did not auto-start your RAID due to it being out of sync. If you RAID is running correctly, you should be able to manually restart your LVM with sudo vgchange -a y at which point the LVs should be visible again with sudo lvs.\n", "Q: Why won't ubuntuone service start automatically at boot?

I use GMail (and I use labels intensively) and because of having to use a very slow Internet connection now I've came to the idea that I should try using a desktop email client.\nWhat application (Thunderbird, Evolution, Claws, or some another) works best with GMail via IMAP?\nFirst of all I want correct GMail labels support (for example an email client shouldn't think of GMail labels as of independent folders, treating messages with multiple labels as multiple different identical messages in different folders), incl. special GMail labels-folders like bin, spam, drafts and sent.\n\nA: Offline GMail Extension for Chrome\nYou can convert it into a complete offline application by going to Wrench -> Tools -> Create Application Shortcuts.\nIt offers amazing integration with GMail (labels, priority inbox, multiple accounts, conversation view, etc) and was ported from the iPad interface of GMail, which makes it look very cool.\nThis runs on HTML5 offline storage unlike the previous version(pableu's answer) which ran on Google Gears (now deprecated). Here's a blog entry announcing it.\n\n\nA: Thunderbird's the easiest to set up for GMail IMAP, as it has all the info re: their servers/ports/ssl settings already. In my experience it's the most customizable with regards to filters, etc as well. \n\nA: Note that Thunderbird is working to Improve Gmail Interoperabilit during this Summer of Code. See: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=721316 for all the details.\nIn short:\n\nThe biggest win here is probably avoiding downloading the same message\n  to offline stores and indexing it multiple times, by using X-GM-MSGID.\n  X-GM-THRID may help with threading in gloda, cross-folder views, and\n  even within a folder. There are probably other things we can do to\n  improve our Gmail integration. For example, we could avoid notifying\n  for multiple new messages just because a message has multiple tags.\n\nThere are already some patches which are waiting for review, so it should come quite soon!\n\nA: I think they all work pretty well. Evolution is what I have been using for years. Not a hitch. Works better than the web client since the interface is less all over the place.\n\nA: Clawsmail simple, lightweight and supports plugin. Here are some explanation on what claws can give you with gmail or even google apps\n\nA: Gmail has an offline mode that's built around Google Gears. I know Gears will be phased out eventually, but maybe it's a good solution for the moment. If gears is phased out, Google might create an offline mode for Gmail that uses HTML5 offline storage. \nHere is some information from google about the offline mode and how to enable it, and there's also a Blog Entry of its announcement.\n\nA: You're not going to find a client that does Gmail via IMAP and treats labels as labels instead of folders. This is because IMAP shows Gmail's labels as folders, so any email client that you use is going to see folders, not labels. \nSo really, your question boild down to: Is there a desktop mail client that treats IMAP folders as if they were labels? To that, my answer is that I don't know of any.\n\nA: Both Thunderbird and Opera work well. Evolution crashes all the time. But AFAIK all IMAP clients treat labels as folders, so you would have duplicate mails.\n\nA: i like Thunderbird because its easy configuration and its interface, more organized than Evolution\n\nA: Well, I was looking for the same thing as you and decided to give Thunderbird a shot although nothing was said about supporting Gmail labels. \nAfter setting my Gmail account (only had to fill in user and password) I downloaded everything perfectly, including all my Gmail labels as folders.\n\nA: I love, as well as, use Alpine - the successor of Pine - from the University of Washington. Recently, it was revealed that Google too has an option for Googlers to use Pine to access Gmail.

More information will be made on the blueprint.\nRAOF's answer also has more information.\n\nA: Everything Jorge said but also nouveau can already render basic things in 3D through Gallium3D.\nThis feature isn't turned on by default because it's relatively unstable and it can break things. This could be mature enough for implementation by 11.04 release.\n\nA: It's quite likely that the 3D support in the open-source nouveau drivers will run Unity well.  However, upstream is not currently in a position to support their 3D component, and so neither will Ubuntu.

When I was using Lucid I noticed they had a backport ppa for kernels but they don't have one for Maverick.  I am currently using Maverick in Generic-PAE mode and was wondering what is the easiest way to upgrade the kernel to 2.6.36 with generic-pae?\n\nA: The backports kernels are only officially available for the previous LTS release; currently this is Lucid (10.04 LTS).  Maverick (10.10) is not an LTS and therefore will not receive backported kernels.  \nBackports of the as yet unreleased development release are built and made available in the kernel team PPA to allow testing.  Again these are made available for Lucid (10.04 LTS) only.  It is expected that people on a non-LTS release will be able to update to the next release once it is finalised and released formally.\n\nA: The easiest way would probably be to email the Ubuntu Kernel Team and ask that they include the -generic-pae flavor when they build the mainline maverick kernels. Best place for that would be kernel-team@lists.ubuntu.com.\n\nA: For the mainline 2.6.36 download the kernel from the Kernel Team's mainline builds and install, e.g. with a sudo dpkg -i *.deb. I'm not sure if this has PAE enabled, though.\n", "Q: Vi in MySQL for command editing When using the MySQL command line interface, is there any way to get it to let you use vi command editing keys instead of emacs?\n\nA: The MySQL command line interface uses readline to edit a command line.\nCreate a file ~/.inputrc with the following content to use vi mode:\n$if mysql\nset editing-mode vi\n$endif\n\nOf course, if you want to use vi mode in all applications (including e.g. bash) that use readline, you can leave out the $if & $endif ... lines...\n", "Q: Mdadm seems to have completely forgotten about a device and shrunk my array After a bit of investigating of a problem I've just encountered, it looks like mdadm has completely forgotten about a new device I'd added to an array. I recently added a new device to the array which went fine, but I've now rebooted (I don't think I had rebooted since making this change) and I've been greeted with all sorts of errors, and I'm fairly sure it's down to this.\nSo my question is: Should it be safe to just re-add that device back into the array? I really don't want to lose any data here! This is what I think I should do but I'd like confirmation from someone with a bit more experience first :) Bear in mind I've already done this once, and have fscked and grown the filesystem too, and have then written plenty more data to it.\nsudo umount /dev/md0\nsudo mdadm --stop /dev/md0\nsudo mdadm --add /dev/md0 /dev/sdd1\nsudo mdadm --grow /dev/md0 --raid-devices=4\n\n\nA bunch of extra information and steps I've already taken: I rebooted and was greeted with a message along the lines of \"Unable to read superblock\" for /dev/md0, my RAID array. I immediately suspected mdadm since I had recently been fiddling with it, and cat /proc/mdstat reports this:\n...\nmd0 : inactive sdb1[0](S) sdc1[1](S)[/code]\n\nWhich is wrong; I had just added /dev/sdd1 to the array too. sudo mount -a reported bad superblock on /dev/md0. I can't remember the next command I used now but something else reported that I had tried to write past the end of the filesystem, which makes sense since there was more data on it than could fit onto the first two devices alone.\nsudo fdisk -l reports that the new device and partition are alive and well. cat /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf shows this:\nDEVICE /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1\nARRAY /dev/md0 level=raid5 num-devices=2 UUID=*snip*\nspares=1\n\nWhich shows clearly that it's completely forgotten about the new device I added. Was I supposed to 'save' the config after executing the commands above? I assumed they were lasting changes; I can't see any use in them being lost on restarting.\nEdit note: I realised that the 'num-devices=2' is inclusive of the 'spares=1', which means that mdadm hasn't changed a disk from 'in use' to 'spare', it's just plain forgotten about it. I'll update the title to account for that.\n\nA: The line:\nDEVICE /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1\n\nmeans that mdadm will only check those 2 devices to be used as part of a RAID array.\nYou need to add /dev/sdd1 to that line, or replace it with:\nDEVICE partitions\n\nwhich is the default and will make it scan all partitions for mdadm superblocks.\n", "Q: Can't set the resolution (resolution smaller than expected) I have an old machine with a max. resolution of 1024x768 and I have a problem setting screen resolution from current (640x480 too big icons and words) to max .\nI tried the following :\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing nvidia driver (nothing happens)\n\n*Editing xorg.conf manually twice \n\n\n*\n\n*adding a subsection with a mode \"1024x768\" (nothing happens)\n\n*adding a subsection with virtual 1024x1768 from ubuntu help ( only displays a part of the screen)\n\n\n*using xrandr (nothing happens)\n\n*using nvidia -xconfig ( it actually did nothing)\n\n*deleting xorg.conf ( this gave me a 800x600 shifted screen a bit to the left ) but then i ran the nvidia-xconfig and the resolution returned the same .\nhere is my xorg ( doesn't seem to be generated by nvidia tool) \nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier \"Configured Screen Device\"\n    DefaultDepth 24\nEndSection\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier \"Configured Video Device\"\n    Driver \"nvidia\"\nEndSection‏ \n\n\nA: Well , I finally fixed the issue by completely removing ubuntu 9.10 and installing ubuntu 10.10 from scratch and I didn't install Nvidia driver . Ubuntu  10 recognized my best resolution itself and everything worked fine .\n\nA: I'm coming to the conclusion that external binary drivers from a graphics card vendor ARE EVIL INCARNATE.  On three separate desktop PC's over the past two years;\nA) 12yr old 1GHz pentiumII 256MB ram bog standard desktop with 10+yr old graphics card\nB) 2yr old 1.6GHz celeron 1.2GB ram with onboard video\nC) 1yr old 3.3GHz AMD 2GB ram with onboard video\nD) latest Intel 3.3GHz i5-2500K 2GB ram with new reputable brand-name 256MB video card\nall possible permutaitons of A), B), C), D) with the following three monitors\naa) 3rd hand CRT capable of 1024x768 (Packard-Bell, dodgy EIDID codes list worst mode first)\nbb) simple flatscreen capable of 1024x768 (Hansol H711)\ncc) new wide flatscreen capable of 1920x1080 (BENQ)\nAll of these combinations are less frequently able to detect the monitor and available screen resolutions after installing 3rd party drivers.  The list of available defaults gets truncated and the system loses its ability to use the native resolutions which are best for each respective monitor.\nOn fresh installs of various versions of Ubuntu including 7.10, 8.04, 9.10, 10.04 and 10.10 I've had the same behaviour every time - don't install 3rd party graphics drivers unless you need transparency effects; rely only on linux defaults, and it ends up with the best resolution of the monitor for workstation use by the end of the week.  For some reason the available modes are not always listed in >Display> gui nor in xorg.conf but occasionally they are and once found they work.\nAfter installing proprietary drivers, fancy screen effects become enabled but it forgets the most useful screen resolutions at every reboot and cannot read the monitor type.  I suspect that the 3rd party driver hogs the reply from the find monitors EDID or something like that rather than making it available to be applied.\nAfter much searching I'm still usually stuck with a downgraded screen resolution, always about 70% of the best available from the particular screen plugged in.  How can it choose which downgraded screenmode to offer the poor unsuspecting user without knowing something about the screen it is plugged into?  800x600 if plugged into a 1024x768 last year and offered 1024x768 if plugged into a 1920x1080.  Therefore it could seem that the proprietary driver is using information to f about with users instead of putting that information to best good use.  If I were a weak willed puppet in the dungeon of lost computer users I'd pay for a different operating system on the grounds of it being worth paying the professionals to sort out the hardware drivers.  As it is, I smell an extortion racket and when I smell that smell I usually flush twice and use bleach just to make sure.\nPS  If the 1995 operating system had not shipped on a broken installation disk I'd be playing some of my favorite games on it at high resolution and super fast frame rate.\n\nA: Your monitor is not recognised properly. I also have an FX5200 and it works fine, because I have an expensive CRT monitor (Hansol 720D). You have to set up a monitor with 1024x768 in xorg.\n", "Q: \"The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 16126D3A3E5C1192\" $ sudo apt-get update\nW: A error occurred during the signature verification.

I don't see any clean way to make it include your settings into the guest session.\nYou could of course change the way every new user's $HOME gets created, but I'm not sure that's really what you want (I won't consider it a \"clean\" solution to do it that way).\n\nA: This has become much easier in 11.10. \nFirst you need to create a folder: sudo mkdir -p /etc/guest-session/skel/. The -p switch creates /etc/guest-session so you can place /skel in it in one go. Now you just add the files you want to /etc/guest-session/skel and it will be copied onto the guest account whenever it's created. \nThe program that sets this up is /usr/sbin/guest-account in case you want to learn more about what's going on.\nThe tutorial CustomizeGuestSession elaborates on this topic. In particular it describes how you can create a \"special purpose user\" for a convenient way to customize the guest session appearance and behavior, without having to know which files to edit.\n\nA: Not sure.. but I've always followed the steps on this post under sections login as guest where you can customize the account. Then section freeze it where you actually setup rsync to reset the account on PC startup. You can easily modify this to reset on logout or shutdown.

Can a GUI app run in X without any of these? This upcoming Ubuntu move to Unity as its Desktop Manager, got me wondering where the modular line lies between a Desktop Manager and X.   \nMy understanding is that X is a window manager, and window = GUI.  \nIs the Desktop actually needed at all, to run GUI apps?\neg. Can X exist without a Desktop Manager, and can GUI apps be launched from the terminal running in X (which may have to be auto-started with X)... \nI can launch a GUI app from the terminal now (Gnome desktop), but I don't know if that is based on a dependancy to the Desktop.\nI may be completely on the wrong track here... but that's what questions are for ;)  \n\nA: X is a service that listens to requests from its clients (= applications) to paint windows and also passes on input device events to those applications.  One of these applications is the window manager (e.g. in case of GNOME that's Metacity or Compiz).\nAnd a desktop environment like GNOME, etc. is actually a collection of applications that are meant to be used together to provide a more or less comfortable user experience; usually it includes a window manager, a session manager, some sort of application launcher, etc.\nAnd yes, it's possible to start any GUI application (if it is an X client of course) on a bare X, but e.g. without a window manager all windows will have no frame (no border, no titlebar) and are put in the same position by default (the upper left corner).  X itself is rather \"dumb\" when it comes to such things...\n", "Q: How do I change the computer name?

TODO: how to check if it is installed, is it installed by default on the desktop image or just server?\nIf you want hostnamectl changes to stay after a reboot, then you'll need to edit the cloud-init config files, disable cloud-init's hostname set/update module:\nsudo sed -i 's/preserve_hostname: false/preserve_hostname: true/' /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg\n\nor disable cloud-init entirely:\nsudo touch /etc/cloud/cloud-init.disabled\n\nSee also: How do I change the hostname without a restart?\n\nA: In addition to editing /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname, various services might have issues with the change as well.  Mysql and postfix are installed by default in ubuntu.  A broken postfix won't affect most ubuntu users, since it's a background email server that isn't used by much.\nPostfix:  \nsudo editor /etc/postfix/main.cf\nsudo service postfix restart\n\nThe default config for mysql doesn't use hostname, so it will work fine as-is.  If you have customized it, edit the files in /etc/mysql/ and restart the service.\nYou may also want to edit /etc/motd  (message of the day), which is shown on virtual terminals and remote logins.  That one won't harm anything though.\nOther services that you may have installed that would need fixing are apache, bind9, etc.  In each case, find and edit the hostname in their config and restart the service. \n\nA: Another better and safe way to rename hostname\nInstall ailurus\n\n*\n\n*Add the PPA and update your repository\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ailurus && sudo apt-get update\n\n\n*Install ailurus\nsudo apt-get install ailurus\n\n\n*After installation it will be found under Applications>>System Tools>>Ailurus\n\n\nA: The host name uniquely identifies your computer on the local network (and possibly on the Internet as well) so it's not a good idea to change it unless you know what you are doing.\nBut you can change the shell prompt not to display the .belkin (domain name part):\nexport PS1='\\u@\\h \\w> '\n\nSee the bash man page and specifically the section on prompting for more information.\n\nA: Use the hostname command to change your hostname\nsudo hostname newname\n\nHowever, this does not edit your hosts file, which you must do so as to make sure that your computer recognizes itself\ngksudo /etc/hosts\n\nAnd add a new entry for your hostname pointing to 127.0.0.1 \n127.0.0.1 oldname newname\n\nYou could remove the old entry as well, but I prefer to keep it there.\n\nA: For some reason all answers are about changing the hostname.

You should check if you use the correct subpixel AA for your display (orientation & order of colours) as using the wrong type will make it really bad.\nOr you could just disable it (as I do).  ;)\n\nI did have a closer look at your image, and it seems like it uses two subpixels at both sides of all vertical lines, which maybe explains why it's more visible (usually at most 1 subpixel is used, I think).\nIt's very well possible that the hinting in open fonts prevents this, or that somehow there are fontconfig rules to prevent this for open fonts (you might be able to create a fontconfig rule that disables subpixel AA for the fonts that have these heavy colour fringes).  Or maybe this is a bug in the subpixel algorithm that gets triggered only by some fonts.\nIn any case, I'm probably a bad judge of how common it is for this to happen, because I see coloured fringes on all fonts when I enable subpixel AA, so I always disable it.\n", "Q: How can I see folders from terminal?

I am running Ubuntu 10.10, I have ubuntu restricted extras installed and the Medibuntu packages that allow me to watch DVDs.\nAny ideas? \n\nA: Other good softwares for dvd authoring are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bombono\n\n*DVDStyler\nHope you'll find useful.\n\nA: From https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/brasero/+bug/500947\n\nsudo apt-get install dvdauthor\n\nBrasero now burns DVD's!\n\nAnd from https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/brasero/+question/126918\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Open a terminal\n  \n*Insert and run this command:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\n  \n*Try to create the DVD now.\n  \n\n\nA: The question appears to concern burning rather than authoring, encoding etc. For burning a DVD I mostly use K3b.\n\nA: That's right. Brasero does not make DVDs. However there are many tools around that work fine. I'd recommend DeVeDe (see multiverse) for easy doing so. Or, alternatively any other video authoring software.\n\n\nA: Totem has a plugin which does this in one click, but works not for all videos. It's pre-installed, but not enabled by default. You can enable it in Edit > Plug-ins... menu in Totem, and then use it from File menu.\n\nA: I found that you can actually burn DvDs in Brasero you have to install an extra plug in called DVDauthor in the Ubuntu Software Center or Synaptic.\n", "Q: Keyboard short-cut to switch to a specific workspace using Ctrl-[1-8] on numeric keypad I have 8 workspaces in use throughout the day arranged as 2 rows x 4 columns. \nWorkspaces are numbered logically from 1-4 for the top row left-right, then 5-8 for the next row. \nI would like to be able to switch to a workspace using the keyboard combination Ctrl-num where [num] corresponds to number [1-8] on my numeric keypad. \nGnome/Compiz already allows me to switch workspaces via Ctrl-Alt-up/down/left/right or at least that is how I have configured it. \nFinding a way to make the mapping and behavior described above however is still confounding me. \n\nA: Under Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts you can map up to 12 workspaces.

Where can i get hold of the experimental versions of Dropbox for Ubuntu? \nIm looking for a version that allows the tray icons to be modified, and as far as im aware this functionality is only available in the latest versions.\nThanks.\n\nA: You can drop last experimental build from Dropbox Forum, here you can find the last version available, 0.8.110.\nSimply download your desired tar.gz and extract .dropbox-dist into your Home folder, than copy your desired icons in /home/yourname/.dropbox-dist/icons/hicolor/16x16/status. Be careful to icons name.\n\nA: Solved:\nThanks to @skalka, ive spotted the difference between the dropbox daemon, and the dropbox-nautilus application that shows up in the package manager. \nThere is a script on the dropbox forum for an app that will automatically pull the dropbox daemon up the latest version:\nhttp://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?id=12153\n", "Q: Is there a IRC Client which can use or emulate mIRC scripts I've used mIRC (Windows) for years, and have some custom scripts, written in mIRC's own scripting language.  \nIs there an Ubuntu/Linux IRC Client which will allow me to use my scripts as-is?  \nFailing that, is there a  \"functions a lot like mIRC\" Client available?\nI've just tried Pidgin's IRC client, but it seems to be quite basic.\nI couldn't see any way for it to tap into channel activity via scripts. \nI don't want to use Wine... WineHQ reports it as having too many bugs for my liking, and anyhow, I try to avoid using Wine like I do Windows :)\n\nA: Konversation is the most similar to mIRC.  I used it for a bit, then xchat but now am solely using  irssi.  It is hands down the best route if you learn how to use it properly.  \nOnce you have scripts/themes/plugins setup the way you want it feels so nice and much less cumbersome than the GUI based irc clients. \n\n\n*\n\n*irssi documentation - irssi documentation and information from irssi site, good general info and base setup guides there.\n\n*irssi and screen - screen is another app which leaves a persistent session, multiple sessions running.  This way you can run screen and have irssi run within a screen session so you can close your terminal and irssi remains running.  Later if you want to open irssi back up you can reattach to your screen session.  I run my irssi/screen on my media server that way from my desktop or anywhere else I can ssh to my media server, attach to screen running irssi and its right there for you. \n\n*irssi themes - Need to find the one you like.  You can modify them easily too. \n\n*irssi scripts - There are some good ones here, depends on what you want to do though.\n\n\nA: No, there isn't.\nTry irssi or XChat.\n\nA: As of now, mIRC works fine in WINE, if you really need a mIRC script and can't be bothered to port it to some other client.\n\nA: The solution I came up with and that works very well is to just run VirtualBox. Install a nice clean version of Windows XP and install MiRC and it works wonders.\n", "Q: filename encoding issue I am getting a file with a faroese name and trying to save it in a PHP script:\n2010_08_Útflutningur.xls\n\nIn Ubuntu 10.04 LTS is saving it as:\n2010_08_�tflutningur.xls (invalid encoding)\n\nI've installed and run utf8-migration-tool, but with no effect.\nIs this an Ubuntu error that I can fix or I just have to give up and modify the name in php?\nIs there a document which states what is the acceptable charset for a filename in Ubuntu, or what are the encoding specs?\nThanks\n\nA: By default Ubuntu uses UTF-8 for filenames.  Most modern linux distros and many other operating systems do so (Windows/NTFS is the best known exception with UTF-16).\nTo fix files that have names in the wrong encoding like the one you show, you can try to use nautilus-filename-repairer\nsudo apt-get install nautilus-filename-repairer\n\nYou can use the PHP iconv functions to convert strings (filenames) from one encoding to the other.  Of course that requires that you know what encoding they are in to begin with.\nTo get correctly encoded filenames from the client, you can try the technique explained by eswald.\n\nA: This looks like an encoding issue.  Unfortunately, PHP needs a bit of hand-holding when it comes to encodings, because its strings are single-byte by default.  If you are creating the filename within PHP, utf8_encode() should be helpful; note, however, that it assumes ISO-8859-1 encoding for the input.\nOn the other hand, if you are using the filename submitted by a client, perhaps you can request the the client do the encoding for you.  That is done with the accept-charset attribute of the <form> tag, and/or by setting the charset of the page that the form is on.  Certain clients may use one or the other, so for best results use UTF-8 for each.\n", "Q: How to reinstall Grub after burg How is burg different from Grub. \nI have installed burg and would like to know if at some point I want to go back to grub, how can I wipe burg and install grub back.\n\nA: Burg Manager is an application to easily install Burg (along with the default Burg themes and a Burg emulator) and change most of the Burg settings such as the timeout, download and install new themes, remove Burg and restore Grub 2, set the default operating system and many advanced options.\nyou can get it from here\n\nA: To restore GRUB, I think you have to type this into the terminal:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\nWhere /dev/sda is your hard drive.\n", "Q: Elementary theme will not install I really like Elementary themes and I now want to install the Elementary theme on my new re-installation of Ubuntu.

I allow uploads from all employees to the media folder on the server. \nAs you can imagine, it's going to get a bit messy in there with multiple spellings of artist and album names for directory names, duplicate files, and incorrect filenames and tags. \nI was hoping I could find a script that I could run daily as a cron job to clean up the media drive. Does anyone know of any that might work? I would like to maintain a path similar to: /mnt/music/Artist/Album/Song.file\n\nA: I found this script http://www.skryking.net/post/bash-sort-mp3-s-by-id3-tag:\n#!/bin/bash\nSAVEIFS=$IFS\nIFS=$(echo -en \"\\n\\b\")\n\nfor i in `ls -1 *.mp3`\ndo\nTITLE=\"`id3info \"$i\" | grep '^=== TIT2' | sed -e 's/.*: //g'`\"\nARTIST=\"`id3info \"$i\" | grep '^=== TPE1' | sed -e 's/.*: //g'`\"\nALBUM=\"`id3info \"$i\" | grep '^=== TALB' | sed -e 's/.*: //g'`\"\nYEAR=\"`id3info \"$i\" | grep '^=== TYER' | sed -e 's/.*: //g'`\"\nTRACKNUM=\"`id3info \"$i\" | grep '=== TRCK' | sed -e 's/.*: //g'`\"\n\nif [ -e \"$TITLE\" ]; then\n  TITLE=\"Unknown\"\nfi\n\nif [ -e \"$ARTIST\" ]; then\n  ARTIST=\"Unknown\"\nfi\n\nif [ -e $ALBUM ]; then\n  ALBUM=\"Unknown\"\nfi\n\nif [ -e $YEAR ]; then\n  YEAR=\"Unknown\"\nfi\n\nif [ -e $TRACKNUM ]; then\n  TRACKNUM=\"Unknown\"\nfi\n\necho \"$ARTIST $TITLE $ALBUM $YEAR $TRACKNUM\"\n\ninstall -D \"$i\" /storage/Multimedia/Music/\"$ARTIST\"/\"$ALBUM\"/\"$i\"\necho \"/storage/Multimedia/Music/$ARTIST/$ALBUM/$i\" >> filelist.txt\n\ndone\n\nIFS=$SAVEIFS\n\nObviously you will need to modify this to use your specific folders. It requires all the unsorted music to be in one folder and doesn't go into sub folders but other than that it's great.\n\nA: I used to have a similar arrangement. The method I settled for was not letting people write to the actual end directory and instead had an incoming directory that once a day processed all the files and in doing so, moved them to the music directory.\nI found this a lot better as I could deal with metadata and get rid of junk files all in one swoop.\nThis isn't going to be the most useful post because I lost the script I wrote to do this. It was a Python script that grabbed album art from Amazon, checked CDDB if there wasn't metadata, etc. If you're looking for a quick Python project, I can heartily recommend it - It was fun.\nOtherwise, you could use the incoming arrangement and run something like Banshee which has a great music-organising engine within it. The only problem is you'd have to do the imports manually as I don't think there's an auto-import function.\n", "Q: how to interpret these errors from syslog My Ubuntu has been acting weird lately.

Having installed an experimental version of dropbox and installed in manually, i dont want the deb in synaptic to download any updates (as theyll over write the changes ive done manually i assume).\nIve found the lock version option in synaptic, im assuming this stops a particular deb from downloading any new versions of itself? \nAlso can i just unlock it again when the version from the deb catches up with the experimental version that i have installed?\nAm i correct or does it serve another function?\n\nA: apt will only replace the current package of something if there is a newer package. Updates that come now will likely be to previous versions. It won't downgrade it unless they do something spectacularly silly with the versioning.\nLock version is not as clever as it sounds. It's supposed to do what it says on the tin, lock the version... But it only locks it within Synaptic. Anything else that does package upgrades (read: Update Manager, apt-get, aptitude, etc) ignores this. This is probably buggy behaviour so I would expect this to be fixed in time.\nBut to stop things getting upgraded, you want to \"hold\" it. To do that, load up aptitude, find the package (/ is the quick-key for searching, n finds the next instance) and press h on it to hold it. This is respected a lot more than Synaptic's \"lock\" feature.\nEdit: Another way of doing this via the command line is by running this:\nsudo -i\necho <package-name> hold | dpkg --set-selections\n\nBut as I started with, I don't think you need to do this in your circumstances. Provided you're using a package version that is clearly newer than the current stable releases (and isn't just a random build number - you can see in Synaptic) you'll be fine.\n\nA: It locks your program to the version that you are using... So that means no updates, bug fixes or upgrades to whatever programs you lock.... This is kind of like ignoring updates in Windows, or I guess you could even ignore them in Ubuntu if you wish... But this allows you to ignore updates for one or two programs, and allow updates for everything else.\n", "Q: How do I get vimeo videos to play properly?

I do have wine installed.\nThis suggests to me that irssi is dependent on wine. What is a Windows-related app doing in an Linux repository?\n\nA: IRSSI has no listed dependencies to wine, as the packages site confirms. That message indicates that there may be an upgrade awaiting, or if a package has been pinned it's state will not change (since there is no dependency). If you installed wine manually, or have made any modifications to the way it operates within Aptitude you will get that message. Unchanged ultimately indicates that during this process those packages, including wine, will not change.\n\nA: Maybe it's just because there are some Wine updates available, but you have not checked them for an update.

According to the manual:\n\nIt is important to list sources in order of preference, with the most preferred source listed first. Typically this will result in sorting by speed from fastest to slowest (CD-ROM followed by hosts on a local network, followed by distant Internet hosts, for example).\n\nFrom a cursory look at the source, sources.list is traversed first, then the files in sources.list.d in an order that you can't control.\n", "Q: Current Exaile song in Empathy status I switched to Exaile a while back, and the only thing I find lacking is the Empathy integration, if I may call it that.

It really puzzles me that any Google search counts far more \"results\" in Firefox or Chrome than in Chromium. Google says \"About 1.460.000 results\" for \"natty narwhal\" in Firefox or Chrome but only 914.000 results in Chromium. Does anybody know why that is so? Which results are better?\nTo add some information: I was observing this for over a month on 4 different machines in 2 different networks using very different internet gateways. Searches are performed more or less simultaneously thus the local IP and the network routes were similar.\nJust to point this out again: the browser in question is Chromium (not Chrome).\nUpdate: According to Bruce Connor's comments it may be that cookies, the state of being logged in or not, or other information influence search results. And, it's true when performing a search in \"incognito\" mode of Chromium as jhominal suggested far more results are displayed. \nTo hopefully get a more precise answer: What might that be from my cookies or \"secret Google user profile\" that makes about half a million results from the search irrelevant, to the opinion of google?\n\nA: For me http://www.google.com/search?q=natty+narwhal returns “About 1,270,000 results” in Firefox, Chromium, Opera, Amaya, NetSurf, Midori, Epiphany, w3m, elinks & lynx.\nDo you want me to test any more browsers?  ;-)\n\nA: Google is run on a huge distributed network, with clustered servers behind load balancers and proxy servers. I'd say the browsers are hitting different servers whose indexes are not in sync. There must be some inconsistencies when they replicate than much data.\nFor the same search I get 1,680,000 in Chrome, 1,690,000 in Firefox. I doubt the browser is relevant, it's more pot luck.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_platform\n\nA: Is probably due to how Google's algorithms select which data is relevant or not, depending on the browser and string.\nFirefox string: \n\nhttp://www.google.com.br/search?q=natty+narwhal&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a\n\nOn Firefox - 1.280.000 | Chrome - 1.280.000 | Opera - 1.280.000\nOpera String\n\nhttp://www.google.com.br/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=natty+narwhal&sourceid=opera&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8\n\nOn Firefox - 1.280.000 | Chrome - 1.280.000 | Opera - 1.280.000\nThe results are identical, but using google.com.br, when using google.com the results are:\nOn Firefox - 1.260.000 | Chrome - 1.270.000 | Opera - 1.270.000\nChrome String\n\nhttp://www.google.com.br/#hl=pt-BR&source=hp&biw=1600&bih=779&q=natty+narwhal&aq=2&aqi=g10&aql=&oq=natty&gs_rfai=\n\nOn Firefox - 1.280.000 | Chrome - 1.280.000 | Opera - 1.280.000\n\nA: I believe I have it nailed down.\nGoogle uses items from your past searches to narrow your searches results.\nThe highlighted link to \"Web History\" (available when you are connected to Google) lets you know what kind of history information Google uses to narrow your searches down. (It can be a lot of things, but default settings only look at your past Google Searches) \nAfter a visit to that link, a nuking of the \"Web History information\", and some wait time for Google to flush results from its system, results became consistent between incognito and normal mode in Chromium.\nI believe that Web History is used only for people who visit Google Search while connected to a Google account. (Which will be your default state if you are a Google account user.)\nAfter some more verification, I have confirmed that Web History is also activated by default for people who do not have a Google account (I suspect it works with a cookie). Though one cannot see what kind of information Google has without a Google account, there is a link to choose to opt-out.\nNB: I believe that the only other big factor in Google's results is the chosen search language (obvious when you think about it, but it kind of bugged me before I saw that Chromium was set in English and Chrome in French).\n", "Q: Should I try to get rid of Wubi? I didn't manage to boot from SD-card reader in my netbook, so I just used Wubi to install Ubuntu Netbook Edition (10.10). The system works smoothly and I'm glad with it, but there are certain perfomance problems: with Eclipse and also when there are lots of tabs in Chrome opened.\nI'm thinking now about having a \"normal\" Ubuntu install, but I'm not really sure if it helps me. I don't really want to set everything up again after reinstalling the whole system, so I'm wondering if I really should try to get rid of Wubi and is there any simple way to do that with keeping all my settings.\nThank you\n\nA: To my experience there are some problems that cannot easily be overcome in Wubi installations. These mainly come from the virtual Wubi file system residing within the Windows file system. If anything goes wrong with your harddisk most likely all of your Ubuntu files are completely lost. Recovering encrypted file systems is almost impossible from Wubi installations.\nIn addition, there have been problems in the past upgrading Wubi installations. \nTo avoid these it is IMO better to have a proper install of Ubuntu either in a dual boot setup or, if you don't need Windows too much let Windows run in a virtual machine within Ubuntu and share files that are stored in the Linux file system.\nThere are many recipes of how to migrate a Wubi installation to a proper Ubuntu installation. However you might find it more convenient and less time consuming to just backup and restore your /home folder when you haven't installed many non-standard software packages.\n", "Q: Is there a command to see who owns an Internet domain?

For some TLDs this is not allowed.\nwhois example.com is an unusual special case. However try something like whois ubuntu.com - this clearly gives you a name, physical address, email address and phone number.\n\nA: There are several whois services with different results (e.g. try online searches). In addition, there are paid services for hiding the real owner of a domain inquestion. Therefore owners can not be displayed for some domains.\n\nA: I don't know any command to find who owns a specific Internet domain address.

Just in case there is something wrong with it...\nOne possible reason for \"out of memory\" errors on systems with not much RAM can happen when fsck has to check a very large filesystem (it also depends on what filesystem, I guess, but don't know which ones are more likely to have this issue).\nSomething you can try is to create a swap partition and enable it (using swapon) before starting the installation.\n\nA: Try booting the Ubuntu Server installer with the parameter: lowmem=1\n", "Q: How to prevent GNOME Screensaver's \"random\" option from including Images directory? I love GNOME Screensaver application and all the themes that can use be used with it -the defaults and additionals from the repositories. So I would like to prefer the \"Random\" theme selection. \nThe problem: there's a choice as Images Directory among themes. When I opt for Random, screensaver shows the content of my Images directory as well. No need to give details, but this is not suitable for more than one reason. Shortly, that directory is very private for me and screensaver, by nature, is to be wieved by everybody when we lock the screen and leave the computer.\nOnce upon a time there were a number of discussions on the issue, but the developers' approach was something like this: \"This is not a bug, this is a feature\". Technically it may not be considered as a bug, but still it is a personal security issue for me.\nA workaround may be not to use the default Images directory for images -or putting just a few screensaver-safe image in it- and to use another directory for the personal images, instead. I don't like this way because desktop integration of GNOME & Ubuntu makes that directory -which comes as default- functional for some image related task.\nSo the question: How can I choose Random option for the GNOME Screensaver and yet not include the Image directory to the line?\n\nA: There are \"Wishlist\" bug reports about this on Launchpad and the GNOME Bugzilla. I wouldn't get your hopes up that this will be implemented in the graphical interface anytime soon though.\nBut it turns out your problem is solvable with a little effort!

I would like to run two X server instances at the same time.\nOne would be an interactive session using the mouse and keyboard attached to the computer. The other would be a 'virtual' session that I could then connect to and use over a network.\nIn other words, I want something like telnet/ssh that allows me to log in to my Ubuntu machine from somewhere else.

It provides support for local sound and local printing - last time I looked Firefox would not start up if sound was enabled.\n\nA: ssh -X\nThe first and easiest option would certainly be \"ssh -X\", but this will only work when the system you connect from is already running an X server. So suppose you are running an Ubuntu machine and want to connect to another Ubuntu machine, you can type \"ssh -X ipaddress\" in the console. This will leave you with a console, but when you start any application that uses X from that console, it will be shown in your current X session.\nXMing\nIf you would be running windows and want to start an X session on a remote Ubuntu machine, you can use XMing. XMing is basically an X server to run on windows. It is available on sourceforge. \nTo use XMing, XDMCP must be enabled on your Ubuntu machine. This was easily done in Ubuntu before 10.04.

There are two kinds of VNC server packages-- the ones that share your existing X display, and the ones that manage a separate X desktop for remote use. The latter is the kind you seem to want. Examples include vnc4server and tightvncserver/tigervncserver. \nThose packages allow you to start additional X displays in the background. To see them, you use a VNC viewer/client.

So when I am using it as a network server, is it possible to boot into only command prompt and there by I can bring down power usage and have a longer battery backup.\n\nA: You can edit the kernel parameters in grub to add text as a boot parameter.\nTo do that temporarily (just for the current boot), you can edit the boot menu entry by pressing e (if you don't want the default boot menu entry, first select the one you want).  If you don't see the boot menu, you can hold down the Shift key during boot to make sure it gets shown.  You have to add the word text at the end of the line that starts with linux.\nTo make this permanent, you can add text to the value of GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT in /etc/default/grub.  If you didn't change that file before (some people remove the quiet and/or splash, or add other kernel options), the line will then look like:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash text\"\n\nAfter changing this, you should run sudo update-grub to regenerate the actual grub boot menu configuration.\n\nWhen you want to start the GUI from the console, do it with:\nsudo start gdm\n\nTo stop the GUI again, log out (to make sure all your settings are stored etc.), switch to the console, and do the same with \"stop\" instead of \"start\":\nsudo stop gdm\n\n\nA: I dont know if you can boot into shell, w/o the graphics mode, but you can use the 6 terminals *Nix provides, buy pressing\nCtrl + Alt + F1 to F6\n", "Q: How can I add an unlisted repository as my primary \"Software Sources\"?

I tried with ssh-add but it also locks on log-out. \n\nA: It's really not a good security policy to use passwordless ssh keys. Using pubkey authentication for signing in is a great way to secure the ssh server, but if your private key is ever compromised, your security goes right out the window. My suggestion would be to keep the password on your SSH key, and let SeaHorse automatically unlock the key when you're logged into the computer, or remember it for that specific login session. That way your key is still protected by a password, but you only have to enter the password once per login session.\n\nA: You can remove the password from your key file, but of course that's not very safe...\n\nA: You can SSH login without password if you want to, as nathwill said you should use passphrase for extra security, but there are ways to add more security\n\n\n*\n\n*disable password login\n\n*use allowusers/denyusers\n\n*white list iptables\n\n\nA: Have a look an Keychain.

I am using System Monitor 2.28.0.  When I look in the Resources tab, I see a nice graph with for memory and swap.  Memory is about 60% 2.3 GiB of 3.8.  When I type the command free, I got :\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:       3994908    3962396      32512          0     100852    1477032\n-/+ buffers/cache:    2384512    1610396\nSwap:      8000328      28468    7971860\n\ncat /proc/meminfo | grep MemFree give\nMemFree:           34536 kB\n\nThe situation has remained the save for several minute.  I started a lot of process with a script and the script is waiting for the free memory to get lower.  According to what I am seeing in the Process tab (or with top), the number in System Monitor seem a lot closed to the total of the memory of the process that the one reported by free. \nThanks\n\nA: The difference is whether or not the \"buffers\" and \"cached\" memory is included in the \"used\" count.\nGenerally, Linux system memory is used by the kernel for two purposes: processes and file/network cache/buffers. If you look closely at the output of free, it is already shown:\n\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:       3994908    3962396      32512          0     100852    1477032\n-/+ buffers/cache:    2384512    1610396\nSwap:      8000328      28468    7971860\n\nIf you add \"buffers\" and \"cache\", and then subtract that from the \"used\" column, you'll get the second line under \"used\" (the line that starts with -/+ buffers/cache), which shows about 2.3G (2384512) in use, which matches the reported memory in use that System Monitor is reporting (it is ignoring the buffers/cached because those will go away to make room for more processes).\nYour grep against /proc/meminfo actually matches the first line's \"free\" column (32512 is close enough to 34536 -- it likely changed between the two command outputs).\n\nA: When i got my hand on system-monitor, the memory usage reported in the \"Resources\" tab was the same than the free column in /usr/bin/free.\nThe problem is that the free physical memory is nearly 0, soon or later: Linux caches aggresively so the money you spent buying RAM is used efficiently. And this meant that the graph would constantly show >98% of memory usage, which was useless.\nSo i/we decided to do just like -/+ buffers/cache: line of /usr/bin/free.\nThis way, the graph is meaningfull and let the user watch the ~application/userland memory usage instead of the physical state of the memory.\nI know, this is a bit misleading, because most (l)users don't understand that free physical memory is a waste of money and performance. I faced the same problem at work: on every monday, servers would reboot, and in the next 24H, every server would trigger a \"memory full\" alert. So i had the free memory computation fixed in the supervision software just like in system-monitor.\nCurrent Solaris has the same problem: the ZFS Cache (ARC) is not included in the free memory reported by tools like vmstat which makes stupid DB admins complains that \"ZFS is bad\" :)\n", "Q: Setting up a server for student developers I would like everyone's to have a folder in the home directory to accessible over the internet w/ password protected. I would also like to limit how much everyone can have in the home folder. \nWhen they ssh on to the machine they also are only limited to viewing there files, and can see nothing beyond their home directory.\nI am setting up a server for some students doing some coding and sharing of files. I would appreciate any help with this.\nPlease and thank you.\n\nA: First of all, you should use key-based authentication for ssh, not password based.  They need to learn how to do proper security from the start...\nOpenSSH has the option to chroot users into their home directory, that should keep the students inside their own $HOME.  Alternatively, you can use permissions / umask to restrict access to other student's $HOME.\nMore might/will be needed depending on what sort of development they need to do...\n\nA: chroots are a little bit overkill given the parameters.\nSimply setting the user's home dirs to 700 permissions, or more specifically \"only the owner can do anything in the directory\" will be sufficient. If you're worried about them knowing that eachother exist with ls /home you can go further and create a /home/students dir which is root owned and perms rwx--x--x and create the users inside of that.\nEdit /etc/adduser.conf to set the DIR_MODE=0700, and DHOME=xxx to set the default home prefix.\nAgreed with the person earlier who said that you should enforce SSH keys only for access to this machine. Rather than giving them a one time password, you should ask them to generate an ssh public key and give it to you via email.\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048\n\nShould be sufficient and will work on Linux and Mac. If they are on windows, PuTTY has a good tutorial for setting up ssh keys. After that command, they should send you ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub only.\n", "Q: Should I enable the ATI Proprietary Driver? Have the ATI Drivers improved any? Are they any better than the default open source driver? Are they worth enabling? \n\nA: \nHave the ATI Drivers improved any?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, quite a bit. But not enough.\n\n\n\nAre they any better than the default\n  open source driver?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*They offer better performance, power management. But they also contain more errors and are less likely to be improved in short intervals of time.\n\n\n\nAre they worth enabling?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're unhappy with graphics performance, cetrainly. If you are quite happy with the current situation, you wouldn't gain anything from enabling them. But you would potentially expose yourself to a few new bugs and errors.\n\n\nThey have improved a lot. And there is not big disadvantage to enabling them. But if you are happy without them, save yourself some potential trouble.\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu Installer not have a minimum memory condition? When installing Ubuntu, there is a slide for checking met conditions.\nI observed that if you have for example only 384 MB of memory, the installer could crash.\nSee https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/658615 for details.\n\nA: I'm not sure your particular crash was due to an out of memory situation (though there's one other bug with a similar traceback to yours that's also a suspected OOM), but there's a bug report requesting better dealing with such situations, which Colin Watson (Ubiquity developer) has acknowledged.\nSee \"Meeting Minimum Hardware Requirements\" on the Ubuntu documentation for more information on required specs.\n\nA: I think there is no absolute minimum memory requirement that will work for all circumstances, so it's a bit difficult to check for.  I have installed Ubuntu on systems with 256 MiB of RAM, for example.\nFor example, it depends on what you do in the live environment before you start the installation (or while doing the installation).\n", "Q: Video recording in cheese is slow cheese records at painful fps. video recording is really slow in cheese almost unusable.\nHow can I increase the fps for cheese.\nI have HCL laptop with built in 1.3 MP camera 2.47 GHz i3 processor with 2 GB RAM.\nrunning maverick 32 bit. \nI installed camorama from software centre which has fine video (fps), but I can't seem to use it due to some error. So  I doubt there is something to be tweaked with cheese itself.\n\nA: There is NO option to edit fps in cheese. Cheese just streams direct video input from your webcam.\nYou mention slow fps during recording, but I'm assuming that the video displayed in cheese even when not recording has the same slow fps, right? \nIn effect, the fps you see before recording is what you are recording?\nIf so, I imagine you are recording in your room? which means low lighting.\n\n\n*\n\n*try taking the laptop outside in bright sunlight and test if the fps improves or not.\n\n\nIf fps does improve outside, it means that webcam driver is running with an auto-exposure setting ON.\n(That means the fps depends directly on the webcam exposure. More light more fps. Less light less fps.)\nSome webcam drivers might have an option to turn this setting off.\nTo check : Install the v4l2ucp program. Once installed, you can start the program from the menu item  System > Preferences > Video4Linux Control Panel . \nCheck if you have the options for Automatic Gain and Exposure (a checkbox) , Exposure , Gain. If you have the options, then you can turn it off and adjust the options as suitable.\n\nIf you do not have the options, it means your webcam driver does not yet support the auto-exposure options. \nIf the webcam has options to toggle Auto-Exposure when you boot into Windows, then you're in luck. The option can be included in Linux kernel for your webcam.\nCheck if there is an existing bug requesting the feature: Search in Product: v4l-dvb \nIf not, File a bug in the kernel. Product: v4l-dvb , Select Component: webcam\nBug is an enhancement feature request and should include following info:\n lspci -vvnn\n lsusb\n dmesg\n uname -a\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem,I have a VGA webcam and cheese recorded very slow and jerky @640x480 resolution and 29fps. I got better results at 320x240 29fps however.\nI searched for an alternative and then switched to guvcview (GTK UVC Viewer). It offers a lot of options for fine tuning all the webcam video recording. Now I can record videos even at 640x480 and 30fps.\nPS: I don't remember how I got this installed. I forgot the repo etc. Sorry :p\n\nA: go to edit->preferences and change the resolution to 640x480 and it'll be fine,you can take photos with 1280x1024 and videos with 640x480...good luck\n\nA: Something from the Cheese FAQ:\n\nI'm getting a really slow response with the video, the video is sluggish and everything looks quite slow, like as the video lags, what could i do?\nYou may have set \"ximagesink\" (X Window System (No Xv)) as video-output. This means, that your cpu is doing all the work. Change it to \"xvimagesink\" (X Window System (X11/XShm/Xv)) in order to let your graphics card do the work.\nWhere can I set those things mentioned in the answer above?\nJust execute gstreamer-properties \n\nSo in summary: press Alt+F2, enter gstreamer-properties, change to the video tab, and play with the Default Output: Plugin option.\n\nA: I am actually having the same problem. I suspect it may be related to this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cheese/+bug/332381\n", "Q: CRON is changing encoding? I have a legacy Java program that outputs an SQL script. I then use Apache Derby to run that SQL on the target database (which is not on the same server as CRON).\nWhen run via putty, this works fine. When run in windows this works fine.\nWhen run using CRON, Derby reads £ signs as ?. \nIf I look at the sql script generated (using VI), it contains the £ signs. If I check the database however, it contains ?.\nWhy would running this under CRON make the program behave any differently?\n\nA: It appears that CRON was the issue. When the Java program ran, and outputted the results to file, it failed to write correctly. The SQL file I was reading was pointing at a wrong version.\nTo solve the problem, I added the following code near the top of the CRON script\nexport LANG = en_US.UTF-8\n\nThis ensured that the £ sign was correctly formatted.\n\nA: for me, the mentioned solutions weren't working.\nanother solution i read was to set\n\"LANG=en_US.UTF-8\" in the \"/etc/environment\" file.\nBut wasn't working neither.\nWhat was working for me was to open the crontab file with\ncrontab -e\n\nand set at the beginning:\nLANG=de_DE.UTF-8\nLANGUAGE=de\nLC_CTYPE=de_DE.UTF-8\nPYTHONIOENCODING=utf8\n\nWhich also sets the environment variable.\nThis must be done with every user you want to run these variables.

Go to System->Administration->Printing, then, under \"Color Model\", choose \"Greyscale\"\nThe othe option is to convert your pdf to tiff image, its basically what OCR tools do:\ngs -sDEVICE=tiffg4 -r300x300 -sOutputFile=output.tif -- input.pdf\nfor more info type man gs\nThe third option is to install kword, abiword or openoffice pdf extension and import the pdf , change color and print.\nIf you need it often, I'd consider installing Windows and acrobat reader into Virtualbox. It's really nice solution for such things.\n\nA: You can choose Plain Text as Highlight Mode before printing. In Gedit you can find this option under View menu. I guess every text editor as a similar option.\n", "Q: How to give directory and file permissions to a web server I'm a Linux newbie. I'm doing a project that uses the gosmore routing engine. In one of my email to the developer about a certain problem, he replied to me that to solve the problem:\n\"I think you will have to move gosmore directory to a home directory and give the webserver read and execute rights. On my Ubuntu installation this is the /home/lambertus/gosmore and my webpages run in /home/lambertus/public_html/yours.\"\nI did move the needed files to my home directory, and CHMOD it using this command:\nchmod -R 755 gosmore/\nThe thing is, when I \"ls -l\" for the gosmore directory, it displays that I had had already set the permission correctly (drwxr-xr-x...). But when I check Permissions in the gosmore directory (right-click > Properties), the permissions are still not set. Because of these, my gosmore installation doesn't still work. What can I do to truly set the permissions that I need for the directories? Thanks in advance! :D\n\nA: Make sure you're looking at the same directory. Nautilus (the GUI) and ls (in the terminal) will show the same permissions. Where did you end up putting the gosmer directory? Usually this needs to be /home/USER/public_html/gosmer for the webserver to see it as http://localhost/~USER/gosmer/. To enable public_html, use sudo a2enmod user_dir.\nFinally, is your webserver configured to run the language that gosmer uses? For example, PHP would need libapache2-mod-php installed, and if gosmer uses CGI, you'd need to enable the CGI module (sudo a2enmod cgi) and allow it (add ExecCGI to the Options directive for your virtual host in the Apache configurations. For example:\n<Directory /somewhere>\n  AllowOverride All\n  Options MultiViews Indexes SymLinksIfOwnerMatch IncludesNoExec ExecCGI\n  IndexOptions NameWidth=*\n<Directory>\n\nThis may need to be done in /etc/apache2/mods-available/userdir.conf if you're using public_html as the target.\n", "Q: What do the following packages do? What does each of the packages do? I was installing libmozjs-dev, and it said that the following packages need to be removed:\ncouchdb-bin desktopcouch evolution-couchdb gnome-user-guide python-desktopcouch python-desktopcouch-records ubuntu-desktop ubuntu-docs xulrunner-1.9.1 yelp\nI see some are self-explanatory, what do the ones with couchdb mean? and if I remove the packages, what effect will it have on my system?\nThanks.\nEDIT: I am on Karmic.\n\nA: I wouldn't say they're explicitly Ubuntu One related.\nCouchDB is a database. It's a fairly light, fairly fast way of storing simple data. Applications can use it to store their data. One advantage over things like SQLite (that is faster than CouchDB) is it is much easier to dump a load of records to JSON and import them at another end without conflict. You can do this with relational databases but it usually means layering on some transaction-logging logic which can still cause problems in asynchronous settings. This means it can easily be used in version control systems like Ubuntu One a lot more efficiently.\nI think we're getting away from the real point somewhat. The clue that something isn't right should be the presence of ubuntu-desktop in that lot. It's just a metapackage but it holds the dependencies for most of the Ubuntu desktop system. If you remove it, and then something does an auto-remove, you'll probably lose most of your desktop.\nThere's also a conflict with xulrunner-1.9.1 which is a core dependency of Firefox.\nIn short, libmozjs-dev isn't compatible with whatever you're trying to install it on. I note that libmozjs-dev has been dropped from the past two releases so if you're trying to force it into Lucid or Maverick (10.04/10.10) I would stop now and look for another way of installing it (namely downloading it from Mozilla and compiling it yourself).\n\nA: All the packages that have couch* in their names are related to Ubuntu One. ubuntu-desktop is a meta-package which install all the standard packages in Ubuntu, you'll find for example also kubuntu-desktop, xubuntu-desktop. gnome-user-guide is self explanatory, xulrunner is related to Firefox, ubuntu-docs is the Ubuntu specific documentation, yelp is gnome help on line browser.\nYou can find more detailed description in Ubuntu Software Center or in Synaptic.\n\nA: Contrary to what others say, xulrunner is not a dependency of Firefox anymore in recent versions.  It is a dependency of yelp (the GNOME help browser) though, and that's probably the reason why several documentation packages get removed too.\nCouchDB depends on xulrunner too, probably for the JavaScript engine.  CouchDB is used by (parts of) UbuntuOne in the form of DesktopCouch (but other applications can use it too of course).\nAlso, the last version of Ubuntu that included libmozjs was “Karmic”, and I'm pretty sure the functionality it includes is also available in xulrunner, so maybe you can use that instead of libmozjs?\n", "Q: Implementing kernel timer in Ubuntu Could you please give any basic example of a kernel timer (start_ktimer) implementation in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Kernel timers are described here: http://www.xml.com/ldd/chapter/book/ch06.html#t5\nA quick example for a kernel module can be seen under the section \"code for /proc/jitimer\".\n", "Q: Which is the most up to date and modern RSS feed reader? Which is the most up to date and modern RSS feed reader for my Ubuntu desktop?\n\nA: And to complete the list…\n\n\n*\n\n*Snownews\n\n\n\n*Newsbeuter\n\nBoth, as you can see, text based.\n\nA: I also greatly enjoy RSSOwl. It's modern, clean, and handles lots of feed formats. Features and screenshots are here.\n\nA: Thunderbird does a very nice job too, and it's built in!  \nChoose New Account > RSS\nThunderbird always seems a little neglected.  Too bad, because there is so much it can do.\n\nA: Google Reader works very well.  Of course, it's not Ubuntu-specific and runs in the cloud, but if you'd like accessing from multiple locations or tighter browser integration (e.g. for bookmarks), that's not something you can as easily get from a local application.\n\nA: There are several options and recommending a single one is hard, because depends on how you like to read your feeds. Nevertheless, I would recommend that you try at least these:\nFirefox extensions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Brief\n\n*Feedly\nBuilt-in browser feature:\n\n\n*\n\n*Opera\nAdobe Air:\n\n\n*\n\n*ExpressoReader\nStandalone:\n\n\n*\n\n*Liferea\nPlugin:\n\n\n*\n\n*evolution rss plugin\nWeb App\n\n\n*\n\n*NewsBlur (AWESOME)\n\n*Mac OS X Snow Leopard ! Stylish script for Google Reader.\n\n\nIf you are looking for something modern, not the old traditional \"panel view style\", then try Expresso Reader or Feedly. They both integrate with Google Reader. Expresso requires adobe Air, but is really nice and have both magazine style view and list view. I personally don't like Feedly, but it is a really modern way of reading feeds.\nI prefer the reader to be embedded in the browser as an extension (Firefox) or as a built-in feature (Opera). I'm currently using Opera, since I can read my feeds along with my e-mails and Brief is no longer working with Firefox 4.0. If you use evolution, then you might want to try the plugin for it. \nScreenshots:\nBrief\n\nFeedly\n\nOpera\n\nExpresso Reader\n\nLiferea\n\nEvolution Plugin\n\nMac OS X Snow Leopard style for Google Reader\n\n\nA: I suggest you install Liferea . It's perfect for the Gnome Desktop.\nOtherwise you can try Blam .\n\nA: NewsBlur is a new online reader by independent programmer Samuel Clay. It lets you read articles on the original site while keeping track of which one you're reading on the feed without interruption (you need to experience that to understand the difference it makes), does \"intelligent\" learning and filtering, can import from Google Reader and OPML, and has an overall well thought out user experience. Premium subscription costs $12 a year, and it's free software: the entire codebase is on github, MIT licensed, so you can run it on your own computer without limitations (some basic familiarity with Django and PostgreSQL would be needed) and make modifications.\n\n\nA: After trying the aforementioned RSS Readers, I've finally found a great one: QuiteRSS.\nIt's fast, stable, actively developed, feature-rich (e.g. built-in filters) and seamlessly integrates into Gnome. There is even an up to date launchpad ppa available! Packages for other OS are to be found here.\nHave fun trying it out!\n\nA: Rosselo, it's just being released.

Which may give you some clue why it is not getting started \ne.g. inside your script \ncase \"$1\" in\n  start)\n    echo \"Starting Service \"\n    <your command to start the service > /tmp/bootservice.log 2>&1\n    ;;\n  stop)\n    echo \"Stopping Service \"\n    <your command to start the service > /tmp/bootservice.log 2>&1\n    ;;\n  *)\n    echo \"Usage: /etc/init.d/test {start|stop}\"\n    exit 1\n    ;;\nesac\n\nexit 0\n\n", "Q: Can't install software from Software Center I cant install anything from software centre, I get this error every time I click on install,  \"Require installation packages\"\nHere is my output of sudo apt get update\n[sudo] password for gaurav: \nHit http://security.ubuntu.com maverick-security Release.gpg                   \nIgn

Since I switched from 10.04 i386 to 10.10 x64 Compiz window animation duration settings are having no effect. What I mean is if I set it from the default of 80 to 160 or 220, the speed does not change it's always just default full speed. However it worked fine on 10.04. Any idea what would be causing this? Perhaps something is overriding it? To clarify that's Compiz > Effects > Animations. I am using the Sidekick animation.\n\nA: Sounds like a bug in compiz settings manager, you should report a bug by following this guide:\nhttp://wiki.compiz.org/HowtoSubmitBugReports\n", "Q: Recommended Wireless Card for Dell Latitude D830? Can anyone recommend a specific brand and model of wireless card that I can buy to replace the (completely worthless) BCM4311 that came with my Latitude D830?  I've given up on trying to get the existing DW1390 card up and running, and I'm ready to buy a new card -- as long as it will work with Meerkat RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX, without any intervention on my part.  If I have to do ANYTHING other than reinstall Meerkat to bring up this laptop on a wireless connection then I'm not interested.\nAnd yes, I've tried every damned one of the thousands of \"fixes\" and hacks for the BCM4311 on the interwebs, and none of them work.  At all.  So if there's a pin-compatible (non-PCMCIA slot) replacement for the DW1390 that will work with Ubuntu I'm ready to lay out some cash.\n\nA: I've used both the Intel 3945ABG and 4965AGN with success in a D820 on an older version of Ubuntu.\n\nA: You might not even have the Dell Latitude D830 anymore but I decided to answer your question to help others that might have the same difficulty.\nI have just answered a question like yours, posted this month. Check out the link below:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/428695/254056\nBroadcom, the manufacturer of Dell Wireless 1390 WLAN Minicard (chipset Broadcom BCM 4311 802.11 b/g), which came with my machine (it may vary among computers of the same model), released in 2009 the driver/package 'bcmwl-kernel-source' with open source-code for use with Linux distributions, including Ubuntu. However, many compatibilities issues between the driver and the kernell have been reported ever since. You can check out more details about that at:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bcmwl/+bug/1119842\nSince it wasn't fixed until now, the solution is to remove the 'bcmwl-kernel-source' package and install 2 others, being one proprietary (closed code), as I described at the links above.\nCheers!!\n", "Q: Enabling multitouch on an acer 5742? I am trying to get multitouch to work on my touchpad. I am currently trying to run a script to get it to work.

Whenever i start up skype, i have to call someone, then hang up 4-5 times, before the other person can hear my voice.\nWhen i, or the other person hang up, skype tends to lock up. I can't kill it with \"killall skype\" or a logout, so i have to restart my computer. \nHave anyone else encountered this problem, and if so solved this? I'm using 10.10 btw. \n\nA: This may be unrelated, but i had all sorts of problems with ubuntu skype, until i went into skype configuration an unchecked, allow skype to manage sound settings. \n\nA: I encountered this problem. It happen less time if I install skype using the Canonical partner repository Software Tab. \nElse, to kill skype, you can go to system => Administration => System Monitor, and then you right click on the Skype process, and you kill it. It seems to be more powerfull than killall. It works for me.\n\nA: This makes no sense, but I fixed this for myself but uninstalling a gmail checker. No kidding. I don't know if it was messing up pulse when it alerted me, but now both Skype and Rhythmbox work fine. \n\nA: Your microphone volume could be too \"high\". Open \"Sound Preferences\" and try reducing it in the \"Input\" tab. Test it with the Sound Recorder application.\n\nA: I had a similar problem sometime ago and I found the solution in this RH bug (comment 27).\nCommenting the line load-module module-suspend-on-idle out in the /etc/pulse/default.pa file solved my latency problem. \n\nA: For me launching Skype from the command line like this fixed it:\nPULSE_SERVER=127.0.0.1 skype\n\n", "Q: Best place to put application files \nPossible Duplicate:\n'Installing' Applications, where to put folders? \n\nHello,\nWhere shall I put applications which do not require install (extracted from archive)?\nE.g.\n\n\n*\n\n*java based programs\n\n*executable scripts\n\n\nIn two variants:\n\n\n*\n\n*for all users\n\n*for one user\n\n\nSome times the archive itself contains directories like lib or bin.\nFor example, apps like ArgoUML\nShall I put all the apps in /usr/local/appname?\n\nA: I keep a growing collection of my own programs (nearly all self-contained shell and Python scripts) in ~/bin.  (Some are actually symlinks to scripts located elsewhere.)\nI similarly use ~/site for programs installed in my $HOME (usually through \"./configure --prefix=$HOME/site; make; make install\"); that is, they're only available for a single user.  These applications use the traditional bin, lib, etc. directories (~/site/bin, ~/site/lib, etc.).\nSystem-wide programs need to be installed in /usr/local/.  So if you have a single executable file, you can drop it in /usr/local/bin.  If an archive has its own bin, lib, etc., those go in /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib, etc.\nThe traditional way is to \"mix\" applications together, with all commands in bin, all libraries in lib, and so forth.  This is painful to uninstall, but requires no further settings for $PATH, manpages, shared resources, etc.  If you want a completely separate application, you can put it in /opt as /opt/appname.  You'll need to configure /opt/appname/bin to be in the $PATH (or specify the full path to execute it).\nWith all of these options that don't use a configure command, the program needs to already know how to find its libraries (often through a linker RPATH setting, but there are other ways).  I would usually not attempt to modify a program if it can't do this already; and certainly wouldn't recommend it for most users.\n\nA: I would suggest placing anything you download and run yourself in the /opt directory. For example with my eclipse build. I extract it in /opt/eclipse now I create a symbolic link and reference it around my system that way. It allows me to change versions and all my programs stay current and no messy rewrite of paths when i update.\nGoodluck\nhow to create symbolic link:\nln -s linkname /path/to/link\n", "Q: Dual-booting Windows 2000 and Ubuntu Win98 is on partition 1, 2000 is on 2, Ubuntu is to be downloaded on 1 = instal on C:  W98 is history [no more updates], I've striped it down to just be a backup save for D:\nmy 2000 is soooo updated that to re-install everything is not an option, I'm sure my install disc is soooo dated that I won't be able to re-update.\non C: with Win98 i use boot.ini to dual boot = i want to dual boot 2000-Ubuntu.\nwill Ubuntu and a 'boot.ini' live together after I install Ubuntu on C:?\n\nA: I am not sure if I understand you right. If you want to install Ubuntu into the win98 partition and leaving it a win98 partition as it is at the moment. \nIf that is correct, you can use wubi.exe to install Ubuntu just into the win98 file system. You can find the wubi.exe file at the Ubuntu download page.\nIf you want to replace the win98 partition, you can just install Ubuntu from the live CD and choose the first partition to be replaced by the Ubuntu installation during the installation process.\n\nA: grub 2 will add windows 2000 to the list of boot choices from past experience i dual booted windows 2000 just make sure you install on the right disk partition...\n\nA: Uhm, what exactly is your question? Dual boot Windows 2000 with Ubuntu and replace Windows 98 with the Ubuntu system? If that's the case just use an Ubuntu Live CD or USB and install over that particular partition replacing it with Ubuntu Linux. The process will overwrite your boot.ini file via Grub2 but there will be a boot menu allowing you to choose which partition/OS to boot into.\n", "Q: Showing files in kmail Hi\n    I added my IMAP mailbox in kmail, but I see that it show me all the files on the remote home directory where the IMAP server is stored. \nIs it possible to show only folders cointaing mails?

This can be done within the options for each account via your preferences menue also. \nHope this helps. piedro \n\nA: You might want to use dimap (distributed imap) instead of imap in the account configuration.

Using a ~ postfix means that your version is lower than the version without the ~ suffix.\nSo: A~B < A\nYou can test that with the command line txwikinger gave you.\nThe reason why ~ is often used for PPAs is that if the 1.0.0-0 version gets into the main Ubuntu repositories, you will get the official version instead of the PPA version.\nOne solution for your problem could be to remove the versioned build dependency; considering that there are no older packages there should be no problem with that.\nAnother (maybe better?) option might be to depend on a version >= 1.0.0~, as A~ < A~B.\n", "Q: Getting a script to run on boot, not on login How can I get a specific script to run (preferably not as superuser) whenever the machine boots, but before login. It can be the last thing to run on boot. I mostly just want the script to work even if no user logs in.\n\nA: I would recommend using cron. The special time value of @reboot will spawn your job at each reboot as your user. For example, run crontab -e and use:\n@reboot /home/yourself/bin/some_script_to_run\n\nFor more details on the special time formats, see man 5 crontab\n\nA: One possibility is to use Upstart. This lets you specify when you want to run your script in terms of dependencies, e.g. “when the filesystems are mounted and the network interface eth0 is up and running”. Create a file /etc/init/bruce_script.conf (you need to create the file as root) containing something like this:\ndescription \"Bruce's boot script\"\nstart on filesystem and net-device-up IFACE=eth0\ntask\nexec su -c '/home/bruce/script' bruce\n\nConsult the upstart documentation for more information, in particular the init(5) manual page for a list of what you can put in that configuration file.\n", "Q: is it possible to use Debian repositories in Ubuntu? Since Ubuntu is a Debian derivative I thought maybe it's possible\n\nA: is possible but not recommended it can cause your system to become unstable. Do not use any foreign repositories. Look for backports or compile the package from source, using the deb-src repositories, if you need.\n\nA: As mentioned, Ubuntu is really \"source code derived\", but since Ubuntu and Debian use slightly different compilers, kernels, and library versions, installing Debian packages on Ubuntu can result in a lot of weird behaviors (crashes, corruption, etc). That said, some things will work okay if the library interfaces are unchanged.\n\nA: Ubuntu is derived from the Debian \"unstable\" branch, which is the in-progress and most up-to-date version of debian.  If you tried installing a package from debian unstable, it might work, but there should already be an ubuntu equivalent that you should use instead.  If you tried using packages from any of the older debian releases, you would be getting old versions and would run into dependency errors that would either stop you from installing or break your official ubuntu packages.\nCheck if there is an ubuntu PPA (personal package archive) for the package you are looking for - odds are someone else has already recompiled it for ubuntu and you can just use that instead.\n", "Q: Is it possible to mirror the apt repositories? I am a student at Case Western Reserve University, and the bandwidth from the Ubuntu servers to my location is often horrendously bad (on the order of a few hundred bytes per second). Myself and a few friends would like to be able to download the packages once, and have them cached for the rest of our Ubuntu installations on campus. To do that, we would either need to setup our own APT repositories, or setup some form of caching (squid?) server at which we could point our systems.\nIs setting up such a mirror a difficult process? How would one accomplish it?\n\nA: There are several ways to mirror a repository or cache package downloads.  What is the best solution depends on how many people are going to use it and what infrastructure is already available.\nFor example, many universities already have local software mirrors, and in that case the easiest solution is probably to add Ubuntu to that mirror.  ;)\nAnd if your university already has a proxy server, it might be possible to use that (maybe with some custom settings for the repositories?).\nWhen you want to mirror the whole or some part of the official repositories (and/or other repositories), you can use something like apt-mirror, debmirror, debpartial-mirror, mirrorkit or ubumirror.  Mirroring the whole repositories might pull in a lot of packages that nobody ever uses, so if bandwidth is really an issue (even at night) it might be useful to mirror only the popular packages...\nWhen you want to cache only the used packages, there are apt-cacher, apt-cacher-ng or apt-p2p, or a proxy like Squid.\nOne advantage of having a local mirror (when compared to a cache) is that installation/upgrades will always be fast (for the packages that are available on the mirror), while when using a cache the first person who needs a package will have to wait until it's downloaded.  You can also configure the mirror to update at night, so that downloading packages happens when (almost) nobody else is using the internet uplink.\nOTOH the advantage of using a cache is that you will only download exactly what packages are needed, and never more than that.\n\nA: You might want to use apt-proxy instead of a full mirror, since it will then take considerably less space and time to get set up:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptProxy\nYou would then need to update the repository lists for anyone wanting to use your proxy.\n", "Q: Install amazonmp3 on a 64-bit desktop Try to install amazonmp3 on a ubuntu desktop 64bit edition.

It seems to be that the WiFi button (rfkill hard block) is not syncing with the rfkill soft block. I had this problem since an Ubuntu update just before Christmas. Before it worked perfectly. \nI solved the issue by making sure the hard and soft block are both set to no. You can check this by running rfkill list all in a terminal.\n\n\n*\n\n*The hard block you can change by pressing your laptop's WiFi button\n\n*The soft block you can override by entering rfkill unblock wifi\nCheck with rfkill list all if both values are set to no and your wireless should work again.\nIf you still have problems I have written up a bit more detailed blog post.\n", "Q: Format of /proc/mounts?

I have a problem with my Laptop (Dell Inspiron 1564 Core i5 4GB Ram VGA ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4300 running Ubuntu 10.10 32bit). It shuts down abruptly without even a lag in the application I am working with before shutdown. I think it's overheating problem. Actually the laptop is hot all the time when I am running Ubuntu. When I switch back to windows, even with intense load it won't shutdown or show any problem as long as I keep proper ventilation (when the air openings are blocked it does the same).  \nActually on Ubuntu i don't usually do things that need much CPU power, usually surfing internet, coding web pages and sometimes playing with python and ruby. I am not enabling desktop effects so no GPU load except the normal GNOME gui.  \nNow as I am writing the Processor load in the panel monitor applet is 0%, Memory 11% by programs, 22% by cache. And i have CPU Frequency monitor for each of the 4 cores set to 1.20 Ghz (the lowest possible value, i am not sure if this applet does really limit CPU usage). Running sensors in terminal gave me\ntemp1:       +26.8°C  (crit = +100.0°C)                  \ntemp2:        +0.0°C  (crit = +100.0°C) \n\nhddtemp /dev/sda at the terminal gave me\n/dev/sda: WDC WD3200BEVT-75ZCT2: 46°C\n\nAll that fine but the laptop is Really hot i can feel it in the keyboard, mouse pad is painful to touch, and the fan is always spinning. I am also placing 2 small fans running on USB under the laptop right now and the laptop is lifted over the fans so it's well ventilated.\nWhen I am running windows it doesn't get that hot except when there is a really big load on the CPU and this is keeping me away from using Linux for everyday tasks.\nActually I don't care much for speed as I can deal with low speed it's not going to shutdown abruptly.\nSo please if you can help me and tell me what are the possible causes, where should I start ?\n\nA: There seems to be quite a few fan/heating issues with dell laptops. My first port of call would be to upgrade the bios.\nI have had systems before that over heat and the bios update usually sorts the problem.\nUnFortunately it depends on dells support, please check the link below. \nhttp://support.dell.com/support/downloads/driverslist.aspx?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs&SystemID=INSPIRON1564&os=BIOSA&osl=en&servicetag=&catid=1&impid=-1&dateid=-1&typeid=-1&formatid=-1&source=-1\nHope this helps some what.\n\nA: If you're comfortable with doing it, it could well be worth taking the CPU apart and blowing the dust out of the fan and heatsink area. There are likely to be loads of guides around on the web, but the overall process is documented in the Dell service manual here. You should use proper compressed air to blow out the dust, and reapply thermal paste to the heat sink.\nI did this to my Inspiron 1300 that was running very hot, and it worked absolute wonders.\n\nA: What kind of GPU do you have?  Radeons are known to always run hot.  Switching to the proprietary FLGRX driver fixes this.\nThere is an open bug for this on launchpad.\n\nA: To lock the CPU to the lowest possible frequencies you can do this:\nsudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq < /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_min_freq\n\nOr you can choose from the list of available frequencies by doing\necho [FERQ] | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq\n\nreplace [FREQ] with one of the frequencies found by this command:\ncat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_frequencies\n\nThis might help in reducing the temperature. But actually i doubt that it is the processor thats causing the problem alone, even without graphics heavy applications a GPU can get very hot if the driver is not the correct one (perfectly optimized) so you might want to try out different drivers (if available, both open and closed source and different versions). Also try measuring the temperature when the computer is using cpu vs. using gfx. Try measuring temperature while running glxgears in full screen and then when running stress -c 5 to see which one makes the highest temperature.\nAn other thing that is important to think of is that you properly don't really know where the temperature sensors in you computer is.\nThe last this that i can think of is that the fan might not work correctly (not controlled correctly by the kernel) but if thats the case i will need to research some more ;)\n\nA: I had a problem with Ubuntu 10.04 and 10.10 overheating and using all of my cpu and most of my ram. I scanned through these forums but didnt see anything that fit the description of my exact problem so I just started to tinker. I noticed in system monitor that XORG was doing most of the damage. I did a 'stop process' and that locked up my computer because the XORG manages the windowing system or something. Either way, did a hard reboot and my computer hasn't run unreasonably hot since, and cpu usage is where it should be. Hope this is helpful and not just dumb luck on my end. \n", "Q: Replace evolution with Kontact?

You can then decide during login if you want to use the Gnome desktop or the KDE desktop.\n\nA: If you would like to sync between an existing data set then you might like to try opensync as a transfer medium.\nThe indicator calendar is getting massive attention for the Natty cycle, so it's likely it'll have strong bindings and all it requires is a kde developer to tie akonadi to it.\nThe open office integration is a simple code change, but it isn't simple to implement.\nOver all it would be easier to wait for the dbus work in evolution to complete so your Kontact client data is simply the same backend that evolution uses and thus that evolution is giving everyone else.\n", "Q: Where do I find the settings and administration menu?

The ~ is your home directory, so ~/bin will be /home/user/bin; it is a normal directory.\nWhen you run \"ls\" in a shell, for example, you actually run the /bin/ls program; the exact location may differ depending on your system configuration.  This happens because /bin is in your $PATH.\nTo see the path and find where any particular command is located:\n$ echo $PATH\n/home/user/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:...\n$ which ls     # searches $PATH for an executable named \"ls\"\n/bin/ls\n$ ls           # runs /bin/ls\nbin  desktop  documents  downloads  examples.desktop  music  pictures  ...\n$ /bin/ls      # can also run directly\nbin  desktop  documents  downloads  examples.desktop  music  pictures  ...\n\nTo have your own private bin directory, you only need to add it to the path.  Do this by editing ~/.profile (a hidden file) to include the below lines.  If the lines are commented, you only have to uncomment them; if they are already there, you're all set!\n# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists\nif [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ]; then\n  PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\nfi\n\nNow you need to create your ~/bin directory and, because .profile is run on login and only adds ~/bin if it exists at that time, you need to login again to see the updated PATH.\nLet's test it out:\n$ ln -s $(which ls) ~/bin/my-ls   # symlink\n$ which my-ls\n/home/user/bin/my-ls\n$ my-ls -l ~/bin/my-ls\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 user user 7 2010-10-27 18:56 my-ls -> /bin/ls\n$ my-ls          # lookup through $PATH\nbin  desktop  documents  downloads  examples.desktop  music  pictures  ...\n$ ~/bin/my-ls    # doesn't use $PATH to lookup\nbin  desktop  documents  downloads  examples.desktop  music  pictures  ...\n\n\nA: Regarding ~/bin and commands/programs only available to your user\nRecent Ubuntu versions include the ~/bin directory in your $PATH, but only if the ~/bin directory exists.\nIf it does not exist:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure that your ~/.profile contains the following stanza (the default ~/.profile already does):\n# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists\nif [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ] ; then\n    PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\nfi\n\n\n*Create the ~/bin directory:\nmkdir -p ~/bin\n\n\n*Either reboot your computer, or force bash to re-read ~/.profile:\nexec -l bash\n\n", "Q: How can I make /etc/rc.local run on startup? I have a script I would like to run when my system starts and have put it in /etc/rc.local, but it doesn't work. How can I enable it to run on startup?\n\nA: Can you run your script manually; if not, it's a problem with that script, otherwise look more at rc.local. If that script needs to run as root,  sudo must be used to manually run it.\n\n*\n\n*Ensure /etc/rc.local, and the script it call, is executable:\nls -l /etc/rc.local\n  -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 419 2010-08-27 11:26 /etc/rc.local\n\n\n\n*Ensure rc.local has a shebang line, which is the default:\nhead -n1 /etc/rc.local\n  #!/bin/sh -e\n\n\nA: In my case, none of the instructions were a perfect solution, so try this detailed one:\n\n*\n\n*Save all executing code in a separate text file with an arbitrary name, such as foo.sh\n\n*Add #!/bin/sh as the first line in foo.sh, executing it via sudo foo.sh to check for errors\n\n*In /etc/rc.local, place the full pathname to foo.sh, prefaced with sh, before exit 0:\nsh '/path/to/your/script/foo.sh'\n\n\n\n*Verify the first line in /etc/rc.local is #!/bin/sh -e\n\n*Ensure /etc/rc.local is executable:\nsudo chown root /etc/rc.local\nsudo chmod 755 /etc/rc.local\n\n\n\n*Verify everything works fine:\nsudo /etc/init.d/rc.local start\n\n\n\n*Reboot to test\n\n\nA: On newer Ubuntu versions systemd is used and /etc/rc.local is not loaded always by default.\nCheck if the Compatibility service is loaded with\nsystemctl status rc-local.service\n\n\nIf it contains active (exited) your setting seems fine and you could have another error in your /etc/rc.local file (this could be a command that fails for example).\n\nA: 2 suggestions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure that the target script file is also marked executable.\n\n*Is the target script running a sudo command?

As of now, unity itself isn't themeable - the theme doesn't change - only the window decoration changes, if that makes sense. \nIf unity is to become default in 11.04, surely it would make sense for the launcher and task bar to change as well?\n\nA: No decision has been made on this yet. \nKeep in mind that we will need something to handle having a high and low contrast theme for accessibility reasons; and that is very much a high priority, so we'll have to revisit this after conclusions have been made at the Ubuntu Developer Summit.\n", "Q: How can I make gnome shell default?

Maybe through an environment variable setting, or some other easy to use means. First I want to say this is commendable attitude.\nMy question is, is Unity engineered such that when other linux distributors, who are shipping nearly stock gnome, may want to provide Unity as an alternative interface to their users to choose from among many other options, will that be possible using stock upstream gnome technologies? Or are there a set of yet-to-be-upstreamed patches developed by Canonical to existing gnome components that would also need to be integrated by other linux distributors for Unity to work as anticipated?\n\nA: It is possible to use stock upstream GNOME technologies with minimal changes to Unity (but you'll lose things like indicators.)\nThere are patches that improve the Unity experience, however they are not a direct requirement for running Unity. There is a GIO patch (submitted upstream), a GTK patch for appmenu support (which are not upstream), so you would lose the global menu.\nMost of the patches in Unity today are for mutter/clutter, but porting Unity to compiz will remove the need for these. We are working very closely with Compiz upstream (Canonical has hired one of them) to basically make Unity a compiz plugin.\n", "Q: Will Unity be the only option during install? I'd like to know if Ubuntu will offer other Desktop environments as an option during installation.  This is only should we decide that Unity is not for us.\n\nA: Ubuntu (the stock CD) has never offered an option to install different desktops in the installer, you make that decision by selecting Ubuntu, or Kubuntu, or Xubuntu, etc.\nUnity will be the default desktop if your hardware supports it. If your hardware does not support Unity, you will get the same desktop that you have today, GNOME 2.x., which is available as the \"Ubuntu Classic Desktop\" in the login screen. Users can also just log into the classic session if they prefer the older GNOME desktop.\nFor those asking if Ubuntu will ever have an option in the installer for people to choose whatever desktop they want then no, that will not be available in the default desktop cd. Of course you can use the alternate installer to preseed your install with the desktop you want or have a custom kickstart or whatever.\nIf someone were to make a community derivative with GNOME Shell (or one that does let the user choose) then you can find information on how to do that here.\n\nA: It's my understanding that the standard gnome session (neither shell nor unity) will still   be available.  Since Unity still uses a large amount of Gnome, I would imagine that everything you need for the old-style Gnome session will still be on the CD.\n\nA: No, this is not planned in any form.\nThe main reason is a distribution needs an identity and direction. Mark Shuttleworth has guided Ubuntu this far, and the direction he is setting going forward puts Unity firmly at the forefront.\nOffering alternate desktop environments or shells during install only adds to user confusion and weakens the identity of the project.\nGnome 2.x will remain as a fallback for hardware that does not support unity, much as it currently does on the Netbook remix.\n\nA: Currently you can still just choose the Gnome Classic session at login.  It's all still there for now.\n\nA: I'm 99.9% sure that you will still have the option to install Gnome. If worse came to worse you could still make Gnome work with Ubuntu after the install. But I'm pretty sure it will remain an option. \n", "Q: How can I configure Unity's launcher auto-hide behavior? This has been an issue for me with Unity since its release.\nI'd like to make the the launcher auto-hide.

Lee's answer has the details. It has a few options:\n\n*\n\n*Never - The launcher will never hide.\n\n*Autohide - The launcher will hide automatically based on time.\n\n*Dodge Windows - The launcher will hide when a window would overlay it.\n\n*Dodge Active Window - The launcher will hide only when an active window would overlay it.\n\nThis question has information on how to configure the different modes of Unity:\n\n*\n\n*How can I configure Unity?\n\nA: 12.04 and later - Unity\nThe Unity Launcher auto-hide option is now a System Setting - Appearance option:\nBy default, auto-hide is switched off - in previous versions of Ubuntu these behaviour was reverse.\n\nFrom the Behaviour tab you have the option to switch-on autohiding of the Launcher and using the slide-bar to control the responsiveness to the reveal of the launcher.\n\nYou can use the Reveal Location radio-buttons to indicate where you need to position your mouse to reveal the launcher.\nThe option to switch on autohiding and controlling the hotspot location (left edge/top left corner) is on the Behaviour tab.\nUnlike previous versions of Ubuntu, the dodge windows option has been removed due to User testing that showed that this form of autohiding caused confusion.\n12.04 & Unity-2D\nThe Unity-2D Launcher delay is now a System Setting - Appearance option:\n\nFrom the Behaviour tab you have the option to switch-on autohiding of the Launcher and by clicking the Low/High buttons to control the responsiveness to the reveal of the launcher.\n\nYou can use the Reveal Location radio-buttons to indicate where you need to position your mouse to reveal the launcher.\nBy default the auto-hide nature is toggled off meaning the launcher is permanently visible.\n\nLinked Question:\n\n*\n\n*Shortcut to change Launcher 'Hide' setting\n\nA: 16.04 CLI one liner\ndconf write /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/launcher-hide-mode 1\n\n0 is the default value for auto-hide off.\nFound with:\ndconf watch /\n\nthen changing it from GUI.\n\nA: 11.04 & 11.10\nYou can disable the autohide feature of the Unity launcher by following these simple steps:\n\nWARNING: CCSM is an advanced tool and using it may break your Unity.\nTo avoid this, follow the steps exactly as mentioned here\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the CompizConfig Settings Manager package via the Ubuntu Software Centre\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Once installed, open the settings manager and scroll down until you see the 'Ubuntu Unity Plugin' which is located in the Desktop category.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Set 'Hide Launcher' to 'Never'.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The settings will have automatically applied and the launcher will now be locked in place.\n\n\nA: You can auto-hide the Unity Launcher.

Is there a way to the switch gnome-shell window buttons to the left? I've gotten so used to them being on the left that them being on the right has thrown me way off.\n(gnome shell has them defaulted to the right corner)\n\nA: For Ubuntu 12.04 and newer\nYou will need dconf-editor, which is part of the dconf-tools package. Install it first: \ndconf-tools\nStart dconf-editor:\nAlt+F2 → dconf-editor\nGo to org → gnome → shell → overrides → button layout. Change it to close,minimize,maximize:\nNo need to restart the shell.\nNote: This also changes the cancel button in the overlay mode.\nFor 13.10 and higher\nAs per a few users, it may require a shell restart. Thank you all for pointing that out.\nFor 15.10 and higher\nThe schema is now org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences as per this comment.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 18.04 and later there are multiple options:\n\n*\n\n*You can now just install GNOME Tweak Tool (which is a helpful tool anyway) from the Software Center or by running in a terminal:\nsudo apt install gnome-tweaks\n\nand in the menu Window Titlebars change Placement to Left.\n\n\n\n*Dconf-editor/tool change still works:\n/org/gnome/desktop/wm/preferences/button-layout\n\nset to close,minimize,maximize.\n\n\n*And the terminal option, too:\ngsettings set  org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout 'close,minimize,maximize:'\n\n\nA: While technically not gnome-shell, if you're using gnome-flashback or gnome-flashback-no-effects the key is located at:  \norg -> gnome -> desktop -> wm -> preferences -> button-layout  \n\nChanging it to:  \nclose,minimize,maximize:  \n\nshould give you what you want.  \nYou can use the command:  \ngsettings set  org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout 'close,minimize,maximize:'\n\nto get this done quicker.\n\nA: Do what hrhnick said, except use this command instead:\ngconftool-2 -s /desktop/gnome/shell/windows/button_layout -t String minimize,maximize,close:\" where \"minimize,maximize,close:\n\nThen hit Alt+F2 and type\ngnome-shell --replace\n\nand hit enter\n\nA: The workspace window view of gnome shell uses the same button layout as the window manager (albeit only for the close button). (relevant code)\nIf you set your close window buttons to the left using gconf, the close button on the window preview in workspace view will also display on the left.\nUsing gconf-editor, change /desktop/gnome/shell/windows/button_layout to close,minimize,maximize: and re-login to see the change.\n\nA: 17.04 and 17.10 (Gnome 3.22)\nThe beginning is as in this answer: https://askubuntu.com/a/113995/286561\n\nYou will need dconf-editor, which is part of the dconf-tools package.\n  Install it first:\ndconf-tools\nStart dconf-editor:\nAlt+F2 → dconf-editor\n\nBut the key is /org/gnome/desktop/wm/preferences/button-layout, the default is: appmenu:cloe, I've changed it to close,minimize,maximize:appmenu.

You can also use spacer at some point to add a space.\nFor 11.04 and 11.10\nAlt+F2 →  gconf-editor\nNavigate to desktop →  gnome →  shell →  windows, and double click on the entry: button_layout, then enter close,minimize,maximize:. You can also use spacer at some point to add a space.\n\nA: This command should work: gconftool-2 --set /apps/metacity/general/button_layout  --type string \"menu:minimize,maximize,close\" (Assuming you want to move them from left to right, which is what I interpreted from your question...assuming move from left to left was a typo :-) ).\n\nA: If you're using Gnome Shell and you want the window buttons on the left, use this command:\ndconf write /org/gnome/shell/overrides/button-layout \"'close,minimize,maximize:'\"\n\nThen restart the shell if needed: press Alt+F2, type r and press Enter.\n\nA: If you have installed Ubuntu Tweak, go to Window Manager and change the Place from left to right or vice versa. This will change all windows' Titlebar button layout, not only gnome shell.\n\n\nA: Gnome version 3.10, Using 13.04 and 13.10\nIf you upgrade Gnome to 3.10 you may notice a change in window decorations.\nGnome version 3.10 is moving towards Client Side Decorations(CSD for short)  in all of the Core apps.\nIn these apps the close button is integrated into the program window and does not use the normal window decorations.\n\nAs Web Upd8 states:\n\nAnother pretty major change in the latest GNOME 3.10 is the\n  introduction of \"header bars\" or \"client side decorations\". These\n  decorations use the GTK+ toolkit and theme engine:\nAs you can see, the close button is now displayed inline with the\n  toolbar which saves spaces but unfortunately it also creates an even\n  bigger discrepancy between GNOME core apps and the other applications,\n  because only the core GNOME apps use these client side decorations.\n\n\nSome applications that have CSD may respect the environment variable GTK_CSD=0 (a variable used to \"try out\" CSD in eariler gnome versions with =1)  for more information about Environment variables: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables especially the section: Launching desktop application with an environment variable to experiment with programs adding something like this to a launcher:\nExec=env GTK_CSD=# gedit\n\nsubstuting \"#\" with 1 or 0 for on and off, and gedit with program of choice\nHowever it seems with Nautilus in 3.10 the variable Does not work.\n\nSimply put:\n\nIn 3.10 it's going to have a close button at the top right no matter\n  what[...]\n\n\nSo what can you do?\n\n\n*\n\n*Stay at an older version of Gnome. Development is still progressing and the Gnome version in the repositories works just fine. It may be likely that options will be added in the future.\n\n*Replace Nautilus with Nemo.

The image is a one-page document in pdf format.\nIf I use Imagemagick's convert 1.pdf 1.eps to convert it to eps or other formats such as tif, I find the image becomes blurry. How can I preserve the clarity of the image?\nThanks!\n\nA: Hm, it seems like that image is stored into the PDF as a bunch of long small \"strips\" of the complete image.  It also seems like there is a filter or set of filters applied in the PDF that makes the image to be shown as b/w instead of the graylevels that it really is.  You can open it in Inkscape, for example, to see some of this for yourself, as it seems like these filters aren't imported (I guess the same happened when you converted to PS or TIFF).\nTurning it from a grayscale to a bitmap will probably require a bit of playing with contrast & such to get an optimal result (the scan isn't very hi-res to start with...).\nYou can import the PDF into The GIMP and play with various filters and colour-options, or maybe use similar functions in imagemagick to create a bitmap version.  It's difficult what filter/setting will give the best results...\n\nA: Open in the gimp, import pdf at 300dpi, go image > mode > indexed, and select 1 bit (black/white), save as tiff with no compression. Once you have a tiff that is essentially the image as a raster format in binary, and you can open in a raster processing program / image library of your favourite language or convert it to an ascii grid using gdal_translate\nI'm fairly sure with imagemagick if you specify -density 300 it'll be the same effect as using gimp at 300dpi if you needed to do batch conversions. Your eps/pdf viewer is rasterising the vector source to your displays resolution at its zoom level, i.e. at 200% on a 75dpi screen the effective dpi for a rasterisation that your viewer is doing is 150 and so on, so pick the zoomlevel you want the image to look clear at for processing etc and then set your conversion tools dpi accordingly.\n\nA: -monochrome\nThis option uses some smart dithering and generates very visible output:\nconvert -monochrome in.png out.png\n\nDocumentation: http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/quantize/#monochrome\nCompare that to a simpler -threshold 50 transform:\nconvert -threshold 50 in.png out.png\n\nwhich loses most of the image.\nConcrete example from: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/galex/pia15416.html\nwget -O orig.jpg http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/650137main_pia15416b-43_full.jpg\n# Downsize to 400 height to have a reasonable file size for upload here.\nconvert orig.jpg -resize x400 in.jpg\nconvert -monochrome in.jpg out.jpg\nconvert -threshold 50 in.jpg threshold-50.jpg\n\nin.jpg\n\nout.jpg\n\nthreshold-50.jpg\n\nRelated questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15861025/how-to-convert-an-image-to-1bit-px-binary-bitmap-with-imagemagick-or-rmagick\n\n*https://superuser.com/questions/75373/convert-color-photos-of-documents-to-good-black-and-white-bitonal-images\n\n*https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/108613/how-do-you-binarize-a-colored-image\nTested in Ubuntu 19.10, ImageMagick 6.9.10.\n", "Q: Will there be a clean upgrade path from 10.10 to 11.04? Will there be a straight upgrade path from 10.10 to 11.04 (Gnome to Unity), and will there be measures put in place to ensure that Gnome is properly \"cleaned\" out on the way?\n\nA: We will of course provide an upgrade path, I don't know what you mean by \"cleaned\" so please provide more detail in your question.\n\nA: In the past when we have major such changes (metacity to compiz, for example) to the defaults upgrades kept their current settings and new installs got the new stuff.\n\nA: Unity is simply a new shell for Gnome and will probably be installed as part of the current ubuntu-desktop metapackage. This means that upon upgrading to Ubuntu 11.04 Unity will be installed by default with the upgrade.\nI am assuming that Gnome 2 is planned to be installed as well, so users both upgrading and freshly installing will get both, just Unity by default.\n\nA: Having just upgraded from 10.10 to 11.04, it has replaced my 'old' desktop with Unity.  Have had a loooong search to find out how to replace it (SystemSettings->System->LoginScreen - switch to 'Ubuntu Classic')\n\nA: I believe that the statement was that \"Unity will be the default UI for clean installs on hardware that will give a satisfactory performance\" (or something like that), so that suggests that if you do an in-place upgrade, you will stick with stock GNOME\n", "Q: Will the new Unity desktop be programmed in Qt? Will the desktop version of Unity, scheduled to appear in 11.04, be programmed using Qt?  I ask this in relation to Matt Zimmerman's blog posting of several days ago, where he intimated that Qt was the more pragmatic choice for an SDK to get coders more involved.  As a corollary, it would make sense if the whole desktop were in Qt, which would also make it possible to do a lot more beautiful effects, and make a more visually engrossing desktop experience.  In any event, please elaborate on the future role of Qt in the Ubuntu desktop.\n\nA: I would suggest you also read up on the future of GTK+ 3.x, Clutter, and related technologies. Using Qt as the basis of the Ubuntu desktop will not automatically make the desktop any easier to use, any \"prettier\", any \"cooler\" or any more stable. Furthermore, it would be more useful to forge ahead on a path of greater cross-toolkit standards (ref: freedesktop.org) and greater interoperability, not on consolidating everything into Qt.\n\nA: Unity is built using some GNOME technologies like GTK and gmenu, and some other technologies that are not officially part of GNOME, such as Compiz, Zeitgeist, Software Center, and other bits from the Ayatana project.\nHowever for people who use older hardware or have driver problems the Unity 2D interface will be available in 11.04 and is programmed in Qt.\n\nA: At UDS Mark Shuttleworth mentioned, that one of the things that must be done until Unity will be ready to use, is to make it compatible with qt, so that these two could cooperate.\n", "Q: Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH for applications started from the desktop I have Qt Creator installed on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.  When I launch Qt Creator from the desktop I can build the application I am working on but cannot run or debug it.  After struggling quite a bit I found that LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not set for applications that are run from the desktop.  If I start Qt Creator from bash (where LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set in .bashrc) everything runs and debugs perfectly.\nHow do I set LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that it is set for all running applications?\n\nA: This seems like a bug in the application itself. It should have a wrapper script that correctly sets any needed LD_LIBRARY_PATH variables. Be careful when writing such a script, though, since you do not want to have any empty portion of the LD_LIBRARY_PATH string between the colons it uses as path separators. For example, this could result in a  bad path, if the variable was empty initially (resulting in a leading empty string before the colon):\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/some/path/for/app\"\n\nSo, when adding a path, you'll want to test for the empty string first. For example, using shell code:\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:}/some/path/for/app\n\n\nA: Create a new file /etc/ld.so.conf containing: \n# Begin /etc/ld.so.conf\n/lib\n/usr/lib\n/usr/X11R6/lib\n# whatever else #\n\nUpdate the dynamic loader cache by running: \nldconfig\n\n\nA: In addition to .bashrc, also set the environment variable in .profile. This file will get processed and loaded by your session, so it should affect everything running as your user. Also: This file says it is not read by Bash if .bashrc exists, but it seems to apply still (perhaps since Bash inherits the X session from where it was started).

Good stuff. It restores too of course.\n\nA: *\n\n*It'd be a good idea to just copy all of /home as that contains your documents and preferences. If you just want to know where preferences are stored, it varies. Many applications store them in .config (that's /home/username/.config) and .local. Most user preferences will be in .gconf. Some older applications might save settings in .gnome2. Firefox uses .mozilla; other browsers use .config as far as I know. To be safe, I'd just recommend backing up /home still.\n\n*Run dpkg --get-selections > ~/my-packages.txt to build up a list of everything installed (or removed) on your system. It will be saved in your home folder as my-packages.txt. Once you reinstall, run sudo dpkg --set-selections < ~/my-packages.txt (assuming the file is placed in the same location again) and then sudo apt-get -u dselect-upgrade to start installing packages. You'll want to also back up /etc/apt/ and restore it on the new installation to ensure that any extra software you may have installed is still able to be installed again.\nIt sounds complicated (and boy does this post look weird with this formatting) but it's not too awful considering the alternative of installing everything by hand again.\n\nA: www.remastersys.com/ubuntu.html\nUse the link to download remastersys.

In the video linked from this blog entry and other Canonical marketing material, it says things like Ubuntu is and always will be Absolutely Free.\nWhat does that mean? Especially considering that Ubuntu and its related products certainly isn't completely free \n\nA: I think it means that Ubuntu will not be splitted to 2 editions: Enterprise(Full) and Home(Reduced) like RHEL&Fedora, SLED&OpenSuse (or even Win7Ultimate & Win7 Starter)\n\nA: The core OS of Ubuntu is committed to remaining completely free (financially and freedom wise). It has a repository for partner and non-free software add-ons. Canonical is also enabling optional \"pay for\" software in the software center. It does not exist in the Ubuntu \"Main\" repository.\nServices like Ubuntu One are merely branded as such for clarity, and their client side software are indeed free. The subscription services that go along with Ubuntu is part of Canonical's business model, which will eventually make the company profitable.\n\nA: actually Ubuntu or canonical has a different business model than REDHAT or NOVELL the other two big linux \"selling\" companies in the software industries...\nwhile REDHAT make u pay them to get their \"repository\" full of software bug-fixed and updated ,,so do NOVELL,, but canonical gives you the software for free in the contrast along with all of their repository..\nthey on the other hand sell \"subscription to service \" or what we call paid services..If you are running a business and need continuous service u cant just rely on random community posts or IRCs..u need a time bounded solution to your problems,,,thats why the paid support is there...\nfrom business point of view this may not be as productive and profitable as redhat or novell....redhat already reached billion doller revenue...but canonical seems to spread their business in other industries where they can directly be paid and profited by their hardware partner,,,the huge embedded system market ..:) ubuntu for android and the coming ubuntu phone is the direction to new business to this open source leading company..\n\nA: This is a good question. \nThe Free Software Foundation does not include Ubuntu in its list of free GNU/Linux operating systems. \nTheir reasons are:\n\nUbuntu provides specific repositories of nonfree software, and\n  Canonical expressly promotes and recommends nonfree software under the\n  Ubuntu name in some of their distribution channels. Ubuntu offers the\n  option to install only free packages, which means it also offers the\n  option to install nonfree packages too. In addition, the version of\n  Linux, the kernel, included in Ubuntu contains firmware blobs.\nUbuntu's trademark policy prohibits commercial redistribution of exact\n  copies of Ubuntu, denying an important freedom.\n\nDon't worry, though! There is a free version of Ubuntu which has actually been endorsed by the FSF: Trisquel. \nTrisquel meets all of the FSF guidelines for free system distributions. It is based on Ubuntu but is without the non-free repositories and it uses the Linux-libre kernel. Not so many people know about Trisquel, unfortunately. Tell your friends about it! Try it out yourself.\nTrisquel is under active development and has an lively and helpful community.\n", "Q: How does Unity work in multi-monitor configurations? Unity in 10.10 appeared to be focused around single monitor configurations with a single tasking workflow. This works quite well on a netbook which has limited screen real estate. \nHow does the present version of Unity scale up to include multi-monitor and multi-tasking workflows?\n\nA: For 10.10 multi monitor support was rudimentary, as that was focused on netbooks -- if you were giving a presentation and you ran Unity we didn't want the top panel overlaid on your presentation.\nFor 11.04 and 11.10 the multimonitor support is much better. I'll talk about how my setup works with Nvidia, but I don't have the hardware to comment on ATI and Intel support so hopefully someone will post seperate answers for those.\nFor 12.04 and 12.10 there is a specification for how to improve multi monitor support in the desktop.\nNvidia Twinview\n\nEach monitor gets a panel with the window controls, the application menu, and then the indicators. When the windows are maximized each window gets integrated into the top panel of each screen. The indicators are cloned so that you're never too far from the system menu.\nWhen the windows are unmaximized the application menu for that app will be displayed on whichever panel the application is on so that you don't have the menu all the way on another screen:\n\nATI\nUsing the open source ATI driver with RandR (you setup from Monitor Preferences, see screenshot) then the same result is achieved as with Nvidia Twinview.\n\nKnown Issues:\nHere is a list of possible combinations of multi monitor setups and their results:\n\n*\n\n*http://people.canonical.com/~bryce/ExternalMonitor/results.html\nThere are some bugs (other than the first, they are generally small aesthetic details):\n\n*\n\n*Bug #742544: For users with the secondary monitor on the LEFT of the main monitor, the launcher displays in the wrong place and similarly regarding [the main panel's position, Bug #757652]\n\n*Bug #769458: Desktop background not correctly rendered on startup\n\n*Bug #742020: Indicators being shown as selected on both screens\n\n*Bug #743621: Occasional problems with applications that run in fullscreen\n\nThere's still the potential to improve support further, for example the suggestion in Bug #755357 to allow two global menus to be active at the same time.\nSee also What's the right terminology for Unity's UI elements?\n\nA: The biggest problem that I had with Unity was that it correctly identified my right monitor as the primary one and displayed the launcher on the left side of that monitor.\nThis caused the scenario where I could not easily invoke the launcher as moving the mouse to the left causes it to switch over to the left monitor. To show the launcher I had to either press Super (Win key) or move my mouse to the Ubuntu icon on the top panel and then slowly move to the left.\nI briefly looked for a setting that would move the launcher to the right side of the screen, but did not find any. Which lead me to revert back to Gnome \"classic\" as it was impossible for me to use Unity with its current multi monitor support.\n\nA: At the moment it's a bit stupidly implemented because there doesn't seem to be a way to set the primary monitor. The unity launcher settings talk about \"the left side of the screen\". Which probably would have been a sensible assumption to make during the previous millennium when nobody had more than one monitor but today talking about \"the screen\" is similar to talking about \"the hard drive\" or \"the usb port\" or anything that the user is likely to have more than one of.\n\nA: As far as I can tell there is no way to configure the launcher to a different monitor. The easiest thing seems to be to swap the physical connections such that the monitor on which the launcher appears is the left hand one. This may not be possible if you do not have suitable hardware connections.\n\nA: I really feel this needs an update, As I am using unity on 14.04 with a 750ti, Proprietary drivers, and three screens. There are options to place a launcher on each screen, one screen individually, enable and disable sticky edges, rotate the screen individually for all three, change scaling, mirroring, placing images across all screens, fullscreen on one and work on the other two, run a video across all three screens, or three individual videos (not necessary...). It's come a long way, and people looking for support should have an up to date answer.\n", "Q: How to browse windows shares from Unity How can I browse windows shares from unity?\n\nA: The only way I've found out how to do this is to open a folder window from Unity and then find it from there. Go to Files and Folders on the launcher on the left, and open any folder window (ie, Documents). If it doesn't open in the file manager, hit the little folder icon on the top-right. You should then see the classic file manager appear. Open the Go menu and select Network. From there you can browse Windows shares.\nIf you already have the file manager pinned to your launcher, you can also open it there.\nSo, in short, I don't think you can currently do this from within Unity. Whether this will be a feature for 11.04 remains to be seen.\n\nA: If you are trying to connect to a specific thing (network location, ftp, etc...) and want to do it like you used to (Places -> Connect to Server), you can open the file manager (or open any folder to open the file manager) and do File -> Connect to Server\n", "Q: How to track traffic on my server in real time? I was wondering if I deploy a server at home, with apache2. I would like to know how much traffic is currently on my site, in real time. \nPlease and thank you.\n:)\n\nA: You can install the package iptraf which gives you realtime monitoring of various tcp and udp information. Page hits are realtime logged in the apache log that you have configured. You can either scan that file for number of lines matching your time period, or you can use some like piwik for your apache server which gives you analysis similar to google analytics.\n\nA: I frequently add the status module to my apache configuration so that I can examine the running state of Apache (this example restricts access to only localhost status requests).\nThis goes in the virtualhost configuration:\n # Server status\n <IfModule mod_status.c>\n  <Location /server-status>\n    SetHandler server-status\n    Order deny,allow\n    Deny from all\n    Allow from localhost\n  </Location>\n </IfModule>\n\nThis goes in the general server configuration (I used /etc/apache2/conf.d/10status.conf):\n# Turn on extended status collection\n<IfModule mod_status.c>\n    ExtendedStatus On\n</IfModule>\n\nAnd then I make sure mod_status is enabled:\nsudo a2enmod status\n\nAfter that, I can just visit http://your-virtual-host.example.com/server-status and get all kinds of details, including the high-level summary, like this:\nServer uptime: 7 days 22 hours 56 minutes 45 seconds\nTotal accesses: 292855 - Total Traffic: 5.6 GB\nCPU Usage: u85.78 s8.21 cu1.49 cs0 - .0139% CPU load\n.426 requests/sec - 8.5 kB/second - 19.9 kB/request\n2 requests currently being processed, 8 idle workers\n....\nSrv PID Acc M   CPU     SS  Req Conn    Child   Slot    Client  VHost   Request\n0-1 27078   0/9/21119   _   0.06    3   101 0.0 0.04    372.17  67.195.113.233  example.com GET /foo.php?state=ND&thing=Madison\n1-1 -   0/0/21273   .   0.01    137 0   0.0 0.00    402.35  128.61.99.146   example.com GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1\n....\n\nI especially like the requests/sec, and the detailed report about what URLs are being (or were recently) served.\n\nA: I would recommend using apachetop, unfortunately it seems the development stopped, but it works well.\nThis site is more recent.\n\nA: If every 5 minutes or so is realtime enough for you, take a look at Munin.

So both editions will be using Unity, but with slight differences in the layout or interface.\nSo my question is, will there be any difference between 11.04 Unity \"Desktop\" and Unity \"Netbook\" interface?\n\nA: For a short summary from Unity’s Technical Lead Neil Patel interview with OMG!Ubuntu!.\n\nWill Unity for Netbook Edition be any different to Unity for Desktop Edition come Natty?\nYeah, all the things which we will change for the Desktop edition will automatically switch back to netbook-style when we detect a netbook.

I am currently running Unity on my Dell Mini 9 netbook. I like the interface, but it seems a bit less \"baked\" than the previous NBR shell.\nFor instance, performance is not great, it tends to be buggy, and it is overly difficult to manage the toolbar.\nWith the realization that Unity will become the defacto interface for 11.04, and much of the plumbing being reworked (i.e. porting to Compiz) - how much better will Unity be in 10.10?\nIs there any hope of getting improvements in any of the areas above, or will I just have to wait until 11.04 to see any tangible improvements? \n\nA: I think (as far as I know and how things have worked in the past) officially in the repositories you will only get security and important bug fix updates. You probably will not see any new code from Unity in 11.04 and beyond. Though there might be hope for a \"semi-official\" backport, as the 10.10 Unity has a PPA repository for 10.04. The same might be true for 11.04 -> 10.10. Time will tell.\n\nA: Now, Unity is average WM. But, in my opinion, Canonical will improve their Unity all the time until 11.04. Although it will be minor improvements, Natty will have brand new Unity. Not Unity that we know. This WM will be Canonical's direction of work  for this 6 months.

I could make it reattach the display variable to, if that's helpful to you...\n\nA: To manually do this, once you have SSHed in, but before you reattach to screen, check your DISPLAY environment variable:\necho $DISPLAY\n\nOnce you have re-attached to screen, explicitly set the environment variable:\nexport DISPLAY=:N.0\n\nwhere :N.0 is what the echo showed before the attach. This won't be perfect, since some application may be expecting to talk to the Session D-Bus, which is a bit more complex to send over the SSH connection.\n\nA: This is how I got it working when running byobu\nAdd this line in .bash_login before the \"_byobu_source..\" line:\necho $DISPLAY > $HOME/.display.env\n\nAnd then add this line to .bashrc:\nif [ ! -z ${SSH_CONNECTION+x} ]; then\n  export DISPLAY=$(cat $HOME/.display.env) \nfi\n\n\nA: there's a program called xpra in the repositories, it's like gnu screen for x11. it's not too hard to work with:\nX Persistent Remote Applications\nXpra gives you the functionality of GNU Screen for X applications.\nIt allows the user to view remote X applications on their local machine, and\ndisconnect and reconnect from the remote machine without losing the state of\nthe running applications.\n\nA: It seems that the problem is that the environment variable XAUTHORITY is not preserved in the screen session.\nI solved this by adding the following to my .bashrc.

But because i dont have the tuner(yet), I am just using Hulu desktop and some video files that i already have.\nThe problem is that when i open some applications, such as firefox, they open on the monitor that is playing the video. Sometimes they even open up behind the video application.\nIs there a way to stick applications to a certain monitor, so that it will always open up on that application?\nI was going to post an image of the display configure screen, but i am to new to post images.

The \"Same image in all monitors\" button is not checked.\nThe Samsung is the monitor i want it to open on, and the unknown is the tv that i watch the videos on. Firefox in particular always opens up on the tv whenever it was closed while maximized, and opens on the screen it was closed on when it was closed while not maximized. This is the biggest annoyance that i have with Ubuntu. I am coming to Ubuntu from mac, and have basic to mid-level terminal experience.\n\nA: Another choice is to use devilspie. You can get Devilspie from the Universe repository.\n\nA: I believe (if you have compiz enabled) that you can do this from the compiz settings manager using the place windows plugin. I've not done this myself, but if you play around a bit with the options you should be able to get the window to appear on the desired monitor.\n\nA: In System->Preferences select Monitors. Check \"Show Monitors in Panel\" then click on the monitor you want as default and hit the \"Make Default\" button. Log out and back in and there you go.\nI've tried this a few times and it never took until I checked the \"Show Monitors in Panel\" box.\n\nA: I fixed it by using compiz-config-manager. install using\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nGo to General > General Options > Display Settings\nSet Overlapping Output Handling to whatever display you'd prefer (the smaller or the bigger, not sure what to do when you have equally sized monitors?). \nAlso correctly setting the Outputs text field with your respective screen resolutions seemed to help in placing the windows better.\n\nA: Same behavior in Ubuntu 20.04: with the primary (built-in) display on the right, (sub-)windows open on the (wrong) left/dual monitor. Examples: Search messages window of Thunderbird being opened on primary display, System Settings window clicked on top bar of primary display.\nA work-around solution was possible with Settings > Displays > Drag displays to match physical set-up: Shifting the left display down below approximately 50 % of the height extension of the primary monitor (i.e. compromising the physical set-up, but still keeping the secondary display to the left of the primary display) generated a behavior correctly opening windows on the primary display.\n\nA: If you do not have CompizConfig, install it (you need it anyway). \nsudo apt install -y compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nGo to CompizConfig Settings Manager > Window Management > Place Windows (make sure that this plugin is checked). Under the General tab you see the option Multi Output Mode. You have options like: Use Active Output Device, or Use Output Device with Pointer etc.\n\nA: If the compizconfig method does not work on it's own (see Vadim's post), then you can try using the GNOME Tweaks manager, go to Workspaces > Display handling and select 'Workspaces span displays'\nDrag a window to the desired monitor and then close it. Next time you reopen it should open on that same monitor. Seems that you have to do it for each application.\nTested with Ubuntu 18.04\n\nA: Something similar to this happened to me a while back.  Try going to System > Preferences > Monitors.  Make sure that the main monitor (your working monitor) is to the left and not the right.  If the two monitors are different resoutions make sure that they both align at the top.

After installing (upgrading) official system to Maverick I am not feeling the same smooth and kinetic scroll experience.\nMy laptop has\n Graphics: Intel DMA-X4500MHD\n\nwhile my official desktop has\n Graphics: Intel DMA-X4500HD\n\nDo I need to install or update some software package to have similar kinetic scroll experience?\n\nA: No, you don't need some other sotware, the problem is you can't get kinetic scrolling on a desktop unless you use some kind of trackpad or something.\n", "Q: Where's the line between the dash and the file browser? I've noticed some overlap between Unity's dash and Nautilus, due to folders being able to be opened and browsed straight from the dash. However if you want to perform any kind of operation on the files (except for opening them) you have to open Nautilus. I fear having two different tools for the same (basic) task may bring some confusion to the user. Has this been considered? What will be the desired interaction between the dash and the file browser, and what is each of them supposed to be used for in the long run?\n\nA: For 11.04, the best way to think of it would be that the Dash (specifically Files and Folders Place) is for simple browsing of recently used/interesting files and searching of files. On the other hand, Nautilus will be for all types of file management.\nNautilus will be prominent via a default icon in the Launcher as well as re-enabling it on the desktop (so you can see the contents of your Desktop folder on the wallpaper). There will probably be a more obvious way to \"Reveal in Folder\" (or some similar wording) for items in the Dash, which will open the folder the file belongs to in Nautilus.\n\nA: I think the dash will be used to replace Nautilus for most of its tasks. Mark Shuttleworth recently said that we should move away from thinking about files and folders. It seems that the dash will transform into a new paradigm for file management:\n\na more search-centric model and Zeitgeist enabled tools that rely on context. (ars technia)\n\nIt is likely that it will gain some of the features that Nautilus has. Nautilus will still exist but it will be seen as more of a power users' tool than a vital part of the desktop.\nThis is all speculation though. We will just have to wait and see what happens.\n", "Q: Will unity performance improve in natty or remain slow? There are some apps developed by canonical that are way too slow. This are USC and Unity. Unity in 10.10 is insanely slow (compared to GNOME which isn't actually a very fast DE) and totally unusable for a netbook (i'ts funny because its targeted for netbooks usage)\nWill this get as good as GNOME in natty, or remain the same?\n\nA: Until now Unity has used the Mutter window manager, which is the next generation of GNOME's Metacity and incorporates Clutter. However this has shown itself to have mixed hardware support - while it works fine on some machines, it is (almost) unusable on others.\nHowever Canonical has already ported Unity to Compiz, which has been the default window manager in Ubuntu for the last three years. This should lead to far better performance and hardware support - if you current machine can run Visual Effects (enabled in System->Preferences->Appearance->Visual Effects) then the new version of Unity should run fine.\n\nA: Unity will be ported to Compiz for 11.04, which should help performance quite a bit. Also, according to Rick Spencer's blog, Canonical plans to do quite a bit of other performance work this cycle.\n", "Q: How to read ext4 partitions in Windows? I have two questions on ext4:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there currently a way to mount an ext4 partition in Windows (XP/Vista/7) to get basic read support?\n\n*If not, are there any plans to support this someday?\n\n\nA: To read ext4 you can use Ext2Fsd. It's a driver for Windows. The name suggest that it only work with ext2 and the site say that it work with ext2 and ext3 but last versions support ext4 too.\n\nA: An alternative is to install CoLinux on the windows machine and set it up with a minimal system (enough to mount the filesystem in question) and Samba.  Then just mount your FS, and share it to windows.  Not exactly elegant, but works nicely and doesn't risk filesystem corruption due to faulty drivers.\nIf a CoLinux install from scratch is too much hassle, try AndLinux, which is CoLinux with an OS already good to go out of the box.  Installs in twenty minutes.  You'll still need to set up the mounting, but the filesystem shares should already be good to go.\n\nA: You can install Linux in a virtual machine then bind the physical drives or partitions directly to it. Then set up the machine to be accessible over Samba/CIFS and map the shares to drive letters in Windows Explorer.\nThere is a guide for doing this in VirtualBox.\nThat's probably the simplest way and should work transparently after setup correctly. It should work with any filesystem that Linux supports and not have to much around with horribly out of date (and possibly unstable) 3rd party utils.\nWith some work you might even be able to make your entire main Linux distro bootable from within Windows.\n\nA: There was a utility called ext2read to browse Ext partitions in Windows (including Ext4 partitions) which may not work anymore as mentioned in the comment below by @heynnema and could corrupt your partitions.\nThe project isn't updated since 2012\n\nA: ext4 has some support through the older ext2* projects. btrfs has no current Windows support. New filesystems are always going to have a period where there's no support on another operating system and, frankly, that's going to suck.\nIt should also be mentioned that projects that try to read the filesystem into another system are always going to give you an increased risk of noshing up your partition.\nSo with that in mind, there is one solution that would take perhaps 30 minutes to an hour to set up that would give you near-native speed, any Linux partition support and would be just as safe (or very close to) as mounting it from Linux: Virtualise!\nYeah I'm suggesting you give up 300megs of RAM and a gig of disk space to run Ubuntu Server from within Windows. Most modern virtualisation systems like Virtualbox and VMWare allow you to pass the VM an entire disk or partition so that's what you'd do. Mount it from within virtual-ubuntu, install samba, share the ubuntu-mounted disks and mount the shares from within Windows.\nIt sounds like a lot of overhead but Ubuntu server is pretty slick and it won't need much in the way of resources. Once installed, you could probably get away with 150megs of RAM for it.\n\nA: You can use ex2explore for accessing ubuntu file from windows\n\nA: You could try booting into an Ubuntu live CD and mounting your existing Ubuntu partition from there, but if it crashed badly enough I don't know if this would work.\n\nA: If you're talking about a dual-boot system, Windows cannot natively read Linux-formated partitions. Therefore, you have two options.\nRecommended solution - Shared storage\nCreate a NTFS partition that will hold the files that you wish to be accessible from both Windows and Ubuntu, and store your files there.\nThis is the recommended, safe solution.\nAlternate solution - Third-party software\nSoftware is available for Windows that allows you to read and write to Linux partitions, to some extent.\nOne example of such software is Ext2Fsd. Ext2Fsd has limited EXT4 support. By default, it will load the filesystems in read-only mode, but you can enable read-write mode if you really want to. This is, however, not recommended. \n\n\n*\n\n*EXT4 partitions mounted using Ext2Fsd will be displayed as EXT3. This is normal.\n\n\nNote that these features of the fourth extended filesystem are unsuported:\n\n\n*\n\n*Journal: log-based operations, external journal\n\n*Extent: size truncating & expanding, file deletion\n\n*Extended Attributes: ACL support\n\n*Note: an error may be displayed after installing Ext2Fsd; the application still works.\nAfter installation, restart your computer and open Ext2 Volume Manager from the Start menu.\nThis is where you assign or change the drive letters for your Linux partitions, mount and unmount them, or perform other operations. \nIf you want to enable write support for an EXT4 filesystem, select Ext2 Management, uncheck the Mount volume in readonly mode box and then click Apply.\nYou can also select if you want your Linux partition to be automatically mounted on startup (you shouldn't use this option for USB drives and removable media).\nNote: this solution is far from perfect and data corruption may occur on your Linux partition. Use this at your own risk!\n\nA: You need to install Samba into Ubuntu and set up a shere folder in the Ubuntu partition. You can then map to that network resource from windows.\n\nA: Via a network or locally? If it is from other computers on the network, then you will probably want to configure Samba on your Ubuntu computer.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/11.10/serverguide/C/samba-fileserver.html\nIf you are dual booting the computer and want to access Ubuntu from Windows, you could try ext2read. I haven't tested it, but it apparently supports most standard Linux file systems.\nThe other option is to boot off a live CD / USB stick. Then you will be able to copy the files off to another location. Maybe another USB device or network location.\n", "Q: configuring wireless on command line interface Sometimes I boot into recovery kernel with CLI and networking for troubleshooting my laptop. So is there a way to connect to a wireless router or AP over command line? If it is possible what are the commands for the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*To list available networks.\n\n*To connect to a network with: SSID, WPA2 key and DHCP mode.\n\n*A command to connect with: SSID, ad-hoc mode, ip-address, netmask, gateway.\n\n\nA: You will need the wpasupplicant package in order to connect to a network secured with wpa or wpa2.\nListed by order :\n1 : sudo iwlist scan\n2 : sudo iwconfig <interface> essid \"my network\" \niwpriv <interface> set AuthMode=<WPA2PSK or WPA2AES>\niwpriv <interface> set <WPA2PSK or WPA2AES>='WPA PASSPHRASE'\n3 : sudo iwconfig <interface> essid \"my network\"\nifconfig <interface> inet <ip> netmask <mask> \nthen set a route to your gateway route add <destination> gw <gateway ip>\n\nA: nm-tool or sudo iwlist scan will show you all available wireless networks.\nThere's a cnetworkmanager package that ought to let you control Network Manager from the command line.

Check the manual for the rest!\n\nA: Copy/paste from man fstab:\n\nThe fifth field, (fs_freq),  is  used  for  these  filesystems  by  the\n  dump(8)  command  to determine which filesystems need to be dumped. \n  If the fifth field is not present, a value of zero is  returned  and \n  dump will assume that the filesystem does not need to be dumped.\nThe  sixth field, (fs_passno), is used by the fsck(8) program to determine\n  the order in which filesystem checks are done at reboot\n  time.  The root  filesystem  should  be specified with a fs_passno of 1, and\n  other filesystems should have a fs_passno of 2.  Filesystems within  a\n  drive will  be checked sequentially, but filesystems on different drives\n  will be checked at the same time to utilize  parallelism  available  in \n  the hardware.

I've read in another question that Canonical has already ported Unity to Compiz, and that this new version has much better performance on supported hardware. Since the work is done, is there an expected date for Natty testers to get it?\n\nA: This is available via the release of Natty Alpha 1.\nThere is currently a PPA available that was made available for earlier releases of Natty, but this is now no longer necessary; The Unity Installation Guide has intructions on how to install and test this.\nUnfortunately due to complications with backporting parts of the GTK3 stack, Compiz, and Unity itself (and not breaking your existing desktop) there will not be a PPA for 10.10 (Maverick). Testing for Unity will have to be done on Natty itself. More information on this development is available on Didier Roche's status report mail to the ubuntu-devel mailing list.\nThe source code is available here:  or with the following command bzr branch lp:unity\n\nA: We don't know for sure yet, but once all the developers are home from UDS (the Ubuntu Developer Summit) I'm sure more information will slowly trickle out.\nI'd say it's very much possible we'll have runnable examples within the next few weeks. Having said that Canonical may want to polish things a bit more, so people don't immediately jump to conclusions about an unfinished version of Desktop Unity. \nI'd be surprised if we get to Christmas and there's no sign of it though... it's a rather major new thing to be tested!\n\nA: Tomorrow apparently.12th November\nJust read this over on OMG Ubuntu (credit them)\nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/11/compiz-based-unity-coming-to-ppa-tomorrow/\n", "Q: Automate switch user password in script I have to write a script and it requires root privileges to execute some linux commnads and to stop & start some services. I'm asked to disable sudo access totally for all the users (as the normal users can gain access to root with the command 'sudo -s') and I did it. So I'm looking for the script to automate the switch user password(su) which does not need user intervention. \nEDIT:1\nOn further research I got following script what I'm in need of:\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport pexpect\nimport os\npasswd = \"my-root-password-here\"\nchild = pexpect.spawn('su root')\nchild.expect('Password:')\nchild.sendline(passwd)\nchild.expect('$')\nchild.interact()\n\nI have checked this script executing manually logging in as normal user and it switched to root without any problem.

Be especially careful that any commands they want to run are owned by root so they can't replace them with something that elevates their privileges later.\nIf they want to be able to run ifconfig for instance,\n%netadmins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/ifconfig\n\nTry that, and you'll see that the netadmins group can only run /sbin/ifconfig with no password entered as root.\n\nA: If you need to run that script as a non-root user, you should configure sudo to allow that.  You can configure sudo per user or group to allow all or only certain commands, either with or without password.  Completely disabling sudo for all users is probably not what you want...\n\nA: You could set the execute sticky bit on that script so that it will always execute as the owner of the script.  Something like chmod 4750 script_name\nExpect can be used to automate responses in a script.  Be careful with either of these as they can introduce security risks, especially when giving regular users elevated privileges.\nProperly configuring sudo, instead of disabling it completely, as JanC stated, is probably the best solution.\n", "Q: Are there mockups for the desktop-oriented Unity?

Something weird's going on I've got an rdiff-backup setup that backs up a largeish sql dump (1.6GB) over a network. The server it's backing up to (Ubuntu 10.10 server) has a small local disk (4GB, 1GB free) but has a cifs mount to a large nas (plenty of free space). I've a softlink set up from a user account's home dir to the NAS cifs mount, and the rdiff-backup job initiated from the client is writing to that directory.\nRecently, the job has been failing. The logfile says:\nSun Oct 24 21:20:14 2010  Sending back exception [Errno 28] No space left on device of type type 'exceptions.IOError'\nI've run the job manually with watch df running on the server, and I can see the 1GB of free space on the local drive diminishing until it hits zero. Then the job fails. To be clear, disk space is not an issue on the NAS.\nSo, for some reason, rdiff-backup is using somewhere on the local disk as a temp working directory rather than the actual directory where the backups are stored, on the NAS device, as I'd expect. However, I can't find which dir it's using so I can mount that separately with its own blob of space. Doing du -sx on / while the job is running reveals the total filesize of / remaining constant at 3.0GB, even though df says / is full.\nIf I list the file handles open by the rdiff process, I get a few sockets and some files on NAS mount. Nothing obvious on the local disk.\nWhat's going on? Why does df say / is full, but du -sx say there's 1GB free? Why is rdiff-backup filling up the local disk when it should be using the cifs mount? What's it actually writing to?\n\nA: As maco already mentioned in comments, /tmp is the problem.\nWith rdiff-backup you can configure temp directory location with parameter\n--tempdir path\n          Sets  the  directory  that  rdiff-backup  uses for temporary files\n          to the given path. The environment variables TMPDIR, TEMP, and TMP\n          can also be used to set the temporary files directory. See the \n          documentation of the Python tempfile module for more information.\n\nIf you set tempdir to that CIFS mount, problem should go away. (We had same problem, and that fixed it, you may have something else too)\n\nA: I noticed that this same error [Errno 28] No space left on device can occur when the write access to the destination directory is interrupted, e.g. by a loose USB cable.\nThe volume that hosts the destination directory may still be mounted after the hiccup, but for safety, the volume reverts to read-only. Thus, when the user tries to use rdiff-backup again, it will fail again, with the same error.\nIn case of an external USB drive, detach and re-connect the drive. Afterwards, rdiff-backup should work again.\n\nA: Whatever I did, rdiff-backup wanted to use more than 120gb to save 60gb, so I did rsync -av (source dir) (dest dir) instead.\n", "Q: Analytics on PPA package downloads? Is there some way to get download metrics on PPA packages?  It would be nice to know how many users are using my application from my PPA and what distributions they are using.

I can imagine that that would complicate things.\n\nA: For the record, the Launchpad bug URL is:\nhttps://edge.launchpad.net/soyuz/+bug/139855\nIt looks like the fix is going to be released real soon :)\n\nA: Ubuntu has a statistics tool called PopCon (Ubuntu Popularity Contest). It takes some statistics about packages that are downloaded and even when they are run. You should refer to the FAQ to get more details about this\n\nA: In addition to popcon, see also http://popcon2.net/ which is an analyzer of those stats. It's not perfect either though and definitely doesn't replace the need for real stats on PPAs.\n\nA: I know that this has been on the LP roadmap for some time, but apparently hasn't landed yet...

Do you know some solution for this problem or why it happens?\n\nA: I used to have this problem for a while on lucid. There was also a bug submitted to firebug (firefox crashed with firebug installed). Going to a newer version of firefox/firebug solved the problem at the time. \nI had no problems so far with firebug on amd64 using Maverick (10.10). \nMaybe you need to be more specific what the exact issue is, if this will not help.\n\nA: Firebug plugin works fine in Ubuntu 10.10 64 bit.\nI am using it without any issues on Firefox 3.6.12.\n", "Q: DSL PPPoE connection not working? I use a wired PPPoE connection to connect to the Internet. What I need to do on Windows to connect to it is put in static IP address, gateway, subnet mask and DNS servers for my LAN card. Next I have to create a dialer for a PPPoE connection, put in my user name, the service name and the password, and \"dial\" this connection. And it works fine.\nOn Ubuntu 10.04, however, I have tried setting things up in a similar fashion - put in all static addresses for the \"automatic\" wired connection, then put in user name, service name, password for a \"DSL\" connection. It worked for a while, then stopped. I have tried putting in all the details within the DSL configuration dialog, same thing happened - it worked for a while, then stopped. I have tried deleting the ethernet connection and only keeping the DSL one with all the numbers put in place, same thing happened - it worked for a while, then stopped. Each of the times, when it connected, it connected randomly, after trying a few times, and either stopped working within a few minutes, or after I had rebooted. I have deleted and remade the connection dozens of times - even with different names, but nothing seems to be working.\nI have also tried pppoeconf from the terminal, didn't work.\nI have checked /var/log/kern.log, but nothing changes in the file when I try to connect. I have also checked /sbin/route, but gedit can't even open it (says it can't figure the character encoding...).\nThe \"connection established\" notification pops up from the top right corner, the same way as when the computer is actually connected to a network.\nCan anyone figure what's wrong and how it can be solved?\n\nA: I seem to have found the solution.\nI deleted all the previous connections, deleted the configuration file from /etc/network created by pppoeconf and rebooted. Then I set up the wired connection (Automatic ethernet) using the static addresses but made sure it didn't have \"connect automatically\" checked in the configuration dialog. Then I created a DSL connection, but of all the settings, I only filled in the user name, service name and password for it. I checked \"available to all users\" and closed the settings dialog. Then from the \"connections\" applet on the panel, clicked the connection name. And it connected and worked.\nNevertheless, after a couple of reboots, I'm noticing that sometimes it won't connect on the first \"click\". It'll show notification \"Connection established\" but I won't have internet access. So I need to disconnect and retry a few times, and eventually it works.\nUpdate: I forgot to mention - I had to set the MTU to 1452 as well.\n", "Q: Will there be possibility in Unity to change default file manager? One nasty limitation of upstream gnome is that Nautilus usage is hardcoded in, for example, in Gnome Panel. That causes Nautilus Elementary to replace nautilus package and nautilus executable instead of creating separate project. This also prevents users from using alternative file managers such as Pcmanfm.\nMaybe Canonical should develop some measure to allow user to choose his file manager in Unity?\n\nA: You can already change the default file manager in GNOME, although the setting is hidden.\nPress Alt+F2 then enter gconf-editor.\nYou then need to edit the /desktop/gnome/applications/component_viewer/exec key to the command for the new file manager.\n\n", "Q: Simplest way to use graphic acceleration to watch videos I've heard about the possibility to play videos using graphic processor of video card instead of normal processor.

(Your question isn't very clear!)\n\nA: use ctrl to select a block. use shift to change that block size.\n\nA: If you want to use the full power of vim then you can pipe output into vim.\n$ ./ascript.sh | vim -\n\nThe output will appear in vim and you can use the full power of vim to do what you will. To select a block as you say above, you can move to a corner of your block of numbers and do Ctrl+V to start \"visual block mode\". Select the block, and then to copy it to the X clipboard you can do \n\n\n*\n\n*\"*p to copy to the X11 clipboard - use the middle mouse button to paste elsewhere\n\n*\"+p to copy to the standard clipboard - use Ctrl+V to paste elsewhere\n\n\nOf course if it is a one time command that is already on the terminal then this isn't an option, but I've found these techniques useful along the way, so hopefully other readers of this question also will.\n", "Q: Under which licence is Unity available?

If I set it to the bottom it just appeared. \nAfter a lot of trying, I found out it is because my xorg.conf is setup for dualscreens, and probably the trayer panel is spawned outside my view (I currently have only a single screen, but I switch a lot).\nAfter manualy tweaking the xorg.conf file to allow for just one screen, the panel appears on the right spot.\nThese are the things I had to modify:\nSection \"Monitor\"\n        Identifier   \"0-LVDS\"\n        Option      \"VendorName\" \"ATI Proprietary Driver\"\n        Option      \"ModelName\" \"Generic Autodetecting Monitor\"\n        Option      \"DPMS\" \"true\"\n        Option      \"PreferredMode\" \"1366x768\"\n        Option      \"TargetRefresh\" \"60\"\n        Option      \"Position\" \"0 0\" # Was 1280 256\n        Option      \"Rotate\" \"normal\"\n        Option      \"Disable\" \"false\"\nEndSection\n\nSubSection \"Display\"\n        Viewport   0 0\n        Virtual   1366 768 # Was 2646 2646\n        Depth     24\nEndSubSection\n\nThe problem is ofcourse that I can't use my dual screen setup anymore. Is there a way to force trayer on the right position even with the dualscreen setup?\n\nA: Yes, I think you are right when you say \"the trayer panel is spawned outside my view\". I just posted this answer in another forum (https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=878706#p878706)\nI think the problem is the interaction between where you place trayer and the virtual screen size and layout.  I had a similar problem where the trayer (bottom right) disappeared with my dual screen set up. In my case, I got into trouble doing this:\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --auto --primary --rotate normal --pos 0x0 --output VGA1 --rotate normal --left-of LVSD1\n\ntrayer --edge bottom --align right --SetDockType true --SetPartialStrut true --expand true --widthtype request --transparent true --tint 0x191970 --height 12 --distance 20 --distancefrom right\n\n(LVSD1 is my laptop)\nThe problem is that the left monitor is 1280x1024 whereas the laptop is 1600x900. That means that the trayer (--edge bottom) is located below the lower part of the laptop's screen. An easy fix is to align the bottom of the two screens, for instance doing (with my setup)\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --auto --primary --rotate normal --pos 1280x124 --output VGA1 --rotate normal --auto --pos 0x0\n\nMaybe in your case its just a matter of specifying the position of your primary monitor AND the trayer edge option so that they play nicely with each other.\nP.S.1. I think in most recent distros with recent xorg, you do not really need to specify an xorg.conf file. \n\nA: Another approach you can take is to use a fork of trayer that has multi-monitor support: https://github.com/sargon/trayer-srg\n\nA: I'm using stalonetray right now. This application allows you to absolutely place the traybar, which solves the problem.\n", "Q: Which tiling window manager is easiest to install and use inside of GNOME I just tried integrating xmonad with GNOME on Ubuntu 10.04, according to the instructions found here: http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Using_xmonad_in_Gnome#Ubuntu_Karmic\nUnfortunately, I was not successful at getting it to work.

Ok, so there's the buzz of Canonical (wanting to) switch for new Ubuntu version from the GNOME default desktop to their own Unity shell. (I hope that's accurate.)\nIt seems I can not totally fathom what Unity actually is. For looking at its homepage it currently is firmly targeted at netbooks and the somehow different usage model on these.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it a classical desktop? -- Taskbar? Shortcuts? \n\n*Is the difference between Ubuntu(GNOME)+Unity more/less pronounced than the difference between Ubuntu and Kubuntu?\n\n*Will \"my parents\" be able to get the interface if they've been using the classical gnome desktop so far? \n\n\n\nEdit: I would not like to split this up into more specific questions, as What is Unity? is exactly what the people I set up Ubuntu boxes for will ask me if they hear that the newer Ubuntu version is using that instead of the Desktop -- and it might well happen someone phrases it like that :-)\nI will certainly not give them the link to the HP as the explanation there does not lay out if it is a desktop or something more or something less: (It does not for me - therefore I'm asking here.)\n\nUnity is designed for netbooks and related touch-based devices. It\n  includes [...] that makes it fast and\n  easy to access [...] while removing\n  screen elements that are rarely used\n  in mobile and netbook computing.\n\n(emphasis mine) -- the explanation there doesn't even mention the desktop-PC!\n\nUnity has a vertical task management\n  panel on the left-hand side and a menu\n  panel at the top of the screen. [...]\n\nThis sounds like a re-themed normal desktop.\n\nClicking on an icon will give the\n  target application focus if it is\n  already running or launch it if it is\n  not already running. If you click the ...\n\nAha. Sounds like Windows 7.\n\n... icon of an application that already\n  has focus, Unity will activate an\n  Expose-style view of all the open\n  windows associated with that\n  application.\n\nNo clue what that's supposed to be.\n\nSo it would really be nice if someone could explain for non desktop-design-terms experts what Unity is.\n\nA: It may be important to remember that Unity is not supposed to be \"ready\" for desktops until Ubuntu 11.04. Ubuntu 10.10 just came out, so they still have 5 long months to change things back and forth. This question will be more easy to answer in February or March.\n\nA: \nFor looking at its homepage it currently is firmly targeted at netbooks and the somehow different usage model on these.\n\nYes, previously that was the case. The announcement about Unity for desktop is very recent so the marketing materials won't have been updated to reflect the new emphasis.\nI think Mark and pals really enjoyed the latitude they had designing Unity (aimed at netbooks with their small, typically 16x9 screens) without the restrictions of working the typical GNOME Panel way. They've got a taste for UI revamp now and want to bring it to the desktop.\nAnd this is certainly the time to do it: with GNOME 3 being introduced, their competitor in the shell space will be not the tried-and-true GNOME Panel but the equally-controversial newcomer GNOME Shell. In addition, I believe Mark is right about touch interfaces becoming more important, and this will certainly require some UI rethinking.\nHowever personally I'm extremely wary of both GNOME Shell and Unity. Whilst it remains to be seen how the desktop variant of Unity will work out, the central task management concepts of both shells seem poorly-matched to the way I personally work.\n[Namely: with 5:4 screens I don't want a large vertical strip taken up with big icons and I don't use separate desktop workspaces. I have lots of applications I regularly use, so the current hierarchical launch menu, combined with a couple of panel icons for the most common suits me fine; I hate the OS X Dock's integration of launchers and currently-running apps/windows. So the directions these projects seem to be taking to emphasise workspaces and vertical linear launchers aren't looking good from my point of view.]\n\nA: Unity is a desktop shell for GNOME. This is not the same as a totally new desktop environment. A desktop shell is the interface that you use. Unity will still use the same GNOME apps and libraries that the current desktop does. GNOME shell is an example of another shell for GNOME. \nUnity is developed by Canonical for Ubuntu. It is dual licensed under the GPL and LGPL (version 3). It was originally developed for the netbook edition but is going to be modified to be suitable for the desktop. \nCurrently, it is not suitable for desktops. \nIt consists of a top bar, similar to the normal gnome-panel but not the same. Instead of the Applications/Places/System menus is an Ubuntu icon that opens up an overlay called the dash which allows launching of files, folders and applications. It also has a global menu, that embeds the File, Edit etc. menubar from applications into the panel. It shows the menu of the currently focussed window. When windows are maximised, their controls (close, minimise, restore) are embedded into the panel as well. These are space saving features. The desktop edition is planned to not have the global menu because on a large screen it would move the menu far away from the windows being used and so the user would have to move their mouse all the way to the top to get to the menus. \nThere is a launcher and dock on the left hand side of the screen. This can't be moved. It is planned that for the desktop edition it will be detachable and be able to go on any side of the screen. It is also likely to have an autohide feature. \nThe expose style feature is like the scale plugin for compiz. It gives you an overview of your windows and allows you to switch between them. \nUnity for the netbook edition currently used the mutter window manager. This has had some performance problems so it is being replaced with compiz for better performance. It is planned that it should gracefully degrade if 3D accelerated hardware is not available.\nUnity netbook interface:\n\nThe interface for the desktop is currently being discussed:\nLaunchpad Blueprint\n", "Q: Why when I log in my two screens shows the same image automatically?

After the last word, and with a space between, tipe \"pci=nomsi\" (without the \"\") DON'T PRESS INTRO, because all the orders must be in the same line... if there's no space when you write the last part, it will appear down but it's considered all the same line.\nPres control+x and you'll bot with the new parameter. Try activating compiz, running some games in 3D etc... If it doesn't work don't worry, you didn't change anything and the next time you boot the parameters will be the originals.\nThe problem is everytime you reboot you have tu do that, so if it worked you can make it permanent installing Grub Customizer:\nsudo aptitude install grub-customizer\nOpen it from apps, system utilities, go to preferences, general, and in the kernel parameter box put \"pci=nomsi\" (again, without the \"\"). Close, save the new parameters and reboot. \nIf there's any problem, just run the program again and delete the new parameter.\nI wish it helps. Good luck!\n", "Q: Hotplug second screen I use here a laptop with an extended screen sometimes.\nFirst i needed to edit the configuration by Nvidia-settings to apply changes of my screen configuration, but now i have improved that by using Disper. That allows with one command to switch on/off the extended screen.\nonly single screen: disper -s ,\nswitch second screen on as extended screen: disper -e\nEither i looking for a way to do this automatically. Is there something that can provide me a signal about hotplugging of screens? Something that is useful to trigger Disper?\n\nA: I don't think the binary nVidia driver provides this sort of functionality, and it would have to be provided by the driver.  I'm not familiar enough with the binary driver to rule this out, though.\nThe open-source nouveau drivers do send a signal on monitor hotplug, and that's caught by GNOME, so things should Just Work™ with them.\n\nA: If you use the option in the nvidia settings to save the changes to your xorg config file, then you won't need use a command. Every time you plug in an external monitor it will use the monitor in the config you chose.\n", "Q: How to report Xorg restarts? Lately I've been having problems with the X server restarting when I'm enabling/disabling Twinview or running low on available memory.\nHow would I go about reporting such an incident after it happens?\n\nA: The best way to report a crashing Xorg would be to report a bug on Launchpad, using the ubuntu-bug utility.\nInstructions for doing this are available here. Good luck!\n", "Q: Will functionalities that we are used to in the old shell be available in Unity? I am currently using nautilus actions, an application that lets one add useful commands to the  context menu, will something as useful be included in the Unity shell?  \nSecondly, I have quite a number of useful scripts available in the Nautilus scripts folder these scripts are available to me via the Nautilus script context menu where I can pass file-names to them for processing by clicking on files and selecting the particular script, to do serious work, will this process be available in Unity? \nLastly, another useful thing is the Templates folder, document files or scripts placed here will be available in the right click \"Create Document\" menu item, when the document of interest is clicked a copy is created in area that you right clicked, as simple as this is it is a very useful thing, will a Templates folder that facilitates such a thing be available in the Unity shell?\nI will be asking the Gnome Shell people about these things too as this concern is applicable to that shell too, being such a dramatic change from the old Gnome interface.\n\nA: These will still be available in Nautilus file manager unless the nautilus developers decide otherwise. They probably won't be available in Unity's inbuilt file launcher. However, you can still open Nautilus to manage your files. If nautilus isn't included by default (I assume it will be), you can install it from the Software Centre.\n'Where's the line between the dash and the file browser?' is a similar question.\n\nA: Nautilus is expected to be default file manager in Gnome Desktop. It won't be completely replaced by Gnome Shell, only some parts of it.\nI hope the same applies to Unity.\n\nA: Nautilus will remain the default file manager in Ubuntu 11.04 - Unity doesn't change that.  Although there is some long-term idea that Unity will eventually be able to do data management better than managing files & folders with Nautilus, the Places work isn't there yet.  Nautilus will ship prominently (it will be on the Unity launcher by default) until a time arrives where the Unity Places work better for everything.\n", "Q: Which is the best way to install new hplip versions? Hplip is the software that drives most hp printers. Usually new printers are only supported in newer versions of the software. Canonical doesn't backport new versions packages to older Ubuntu versions, that means that newer drivers are not going to be available in the Software Center of older Ubuntu versions.\nAs an example yesterday I needed to hook a hp 1005p to a computer running 8.04. I was forced to install a newer hplip than the version available in the repositories. I installed it using the script from the hp page, but I'd like to know other alternatives.\nWhich is the best (technically, not the easiest) way to install it and why?.\n\nA: Installing from the Official Backports in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\nAt least for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS there is a relatively new version of HPLIP available in the official precise-backports repository. See this answer for how to enable the backports repository (should be enabled by default).\nYou can then install the latest version of HPLIP from the backports repository like so:\nsudo apt-get --target-release precise-backports install hplip\n\nIMHO, this should be the “technically” best solution to get a very recent version of HPLIP (at least for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS) as this solution does not pose the problems mentioned in Javier Rivera’s answer.\n\nA: I am currently running Ubuntu 12.04 (precise), which has version 3.12.2 of hplip. But I found out from the hplip site that I needed at least version 3.12.4 of hplip for my new HP Officejet printer.\nI noticed that the next most recent Ubuntu release, 12.10 (quantal), had hplip version 3.12.6, but I didn't want to upgrade my entire system yet just for that. I also preferred to stay closer to a consistent Ubuntu setup than what Javier ended up doing. So here is what I did:\nI went to the Ubuntu packages site and downloaded the latest deb file from 12.10 (quantal) for my architecture (amd64) for each of the following packages:\nlibhpmud0\nprinter-driver-hpcups\nlibsane-hpaio\nhplip-data\nhplip\n\nI then installed each of the deb files, in that order, using this command:\nsudo dpkg -i <deb-file-name>\n\n[Actually, first I tried doing that just for hplip. It failed due to missing dependencies. I kept following the dependencies until I compiled that list.]\nI think that is all I need, really, but for completeness, I did the same thing for two more packages:\nprinter-driver-hpijs\nhpijs-ppds\n\nNow my HP Officejet printer works perfectly, fully supported by genuine Ubuntu packages.\nThe only thing left to do is to figure out how to configure the files in /etc/apt to watch for updates for the quantal packages I installed. I'll update this post if and when I get around to doing that, or maybe someone else can help.\n\nA: To configure the HP LaserJet P1005:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install hplip\n\n*sudo hp-setup -i\n\nA: You can use the official hp installer as I did. It will detect that I'm using Ubuntu, uninstall the older drivers, fetch all the dependencies (includind build-essentials), compile the new version, make a nice deb and install it.\nGreat features:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's clean, it uninstalls old versions and install as a deb.\n\n*It's always the latest stable version, it quickly adds support to newer printers.\n\n*It worked with all the Ubuntu versions that I throw at it. Likely it's also cross-distro.\n\n\nProblems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Takes loads of time to install, it must compile the driver and fetch hundreds of megas of dependencies from the internet.\n\n*It doesn't integrate into Ubuntu Update, so no automatically security updates.\n\n*Does it really need to add an HP icon to the tray?.\n\n\nIt's a great piece of software, technically it's amazing, but the first two problems are a issue for me.\n\nA: If you have old version of hplip,\njust run \nhp-doctor\n and follow instructions for update process\n\nA: I think best way is from Software Center. I have done it several times and it was OK.\n", "Q: If Unity launcher is auto-hide, how will elements on upper panel behave? When launcher hides to left, active windows will maximize their borders to full screen. Alignment between windows left border and windows buttons + global menu on upper panel would be lost, it will look very strange. I want to know what is the real plan on auto-hiding.\nSorry for my poor english.\n\nA: It's true that the maximised window will then have window buttons which are a little inside from the left edge of the window. We haven't tested this yet, our position for the moment is that keeping them in the same place on the screen is more important than keeping them against the left edge of the window. We'll have to update that understanding once we're in a position to test it.\nIn answer to your question: that is the real plan on auto-hiding :-) but it may not be the final answer.\n", "Q: How can I remove \"Ubuntu Netbook Edition\" option from the GDM session menu? I was trying out Unity and then I uninstalled it but there is still an Ubuntu Netbook Edition option in the GDM session list. Accidentally clicking on that causes the user to log in to a broken desktop. How can I remove it from the list?\n\nA: Go to the Ubuntu Software Center and use the search box in the upper right corner. Search for ubuntu-netbook and remove the packages ubuntu-netbook and ubuntu-netbook-default-settings.\n\nA: The list is populated by looking at the contents of the /usr/share/xsessions directory. In here you’ll find files with the .desktop extension (extension hidden in some file managers, press CTRL+H). As these files are in a system folder, you will need root privileges to change or delete them. \n\nA: After upgrading from Ubuntu 10.10 Lucid Lynx (10.10) Netbook Edition to Ubuntu 11.04 Natty Narwhal, the upgrade process does not remove the ubuntu-netbook and ubuntu-netbook-default-settings packages. Subsequent login attempts result in a broken desktop being displayed with background but no panels whatsoever.\nIn order to fix this problem, press CTRL+ALT+DEL and select the Restart option. When logging in after restart, after selecting a username, select Ubuntu session option from the drop-down box in the bottom bar. This will start the Natty's default session with Unity. \nNext, run the following command in a Terminal window in order to remove the non-working option from the session list.\n\nsudo apt-get remove ubuntu-netbook ubuntu-netbook-default-settings\n\n", "Q: Why do indicator applets exist? Why Ubuntu uses the Indicator Applet?\nIt loses a lot of usability, why made it when Gnome already have one?\n\nExample\nWithout indicator applet:\nApplication is in the icon tray\nLeft click opens the application window\nRight click shows a menu related to application\nWith indicator applet:\nApplication is in the icon tray\nLeft click shows a menu with a few options related to application\nRight click shows a menu related to \"indicator applet\"\nThis means it takes 2 clicks to show the application main window,\nwhile before it need only one.\nWhy make something that already exists and is useful?\nWhy change for something that no has usability?\n\nA: \nWhy make something that already exists and is useful? Why change for something that no has usability?\n\nDesign-over-function.\nIt sounds harsh but the original remit was the cut down the number of icons and standardise the way they work. There's little consideration for what these icons need to accomplish or how people use them.\nThe process was very transparent but the conclusions drawn (that tooltips are bad, that similar things should be clustered, that things should all operate in exactly the same way) haven't helped usability or design in the short-medium term.\nJorge's blog post from earlier in the year hailed these positives but I'll post under them what I think has actually happened as a result.\n\n\n*\n\n*More accessability, and note how he’s scrubbing through the menus with his keyboard.\nBut less accessibility where most people want it. The music menu is agnostic so there is (or at least was - I haven't used IA in some months) no way to quickly skip tracks with a roll of the mouse wheel. The messaging menu is compacted so there's no way to toggle the to-tray effect of single applications with one click. There aren't any tooltips so it's harder to find out what the current song or current volume or current network or who has sent you a message. It's less accessible through lower function.\nI think this alone highlights the biggest issue when you try to standardise things. Each NA icon is supposed to control different applications and each of those works in a different way. Imposing a very restrictive set of design rules might make it look pretty (even that's debatable - my eyes have cones as well as rods, please use them!) but it means you have to invent a new way to control the application through its icon. So far all these alternative methods appear to be somewhat less intuitive or accessible than their predecessors.\nThere's also no consideration for people who don't want things clustered. I for example have oodles (3840px) of horizontal panel space. Clustering applications together just makes it even harder for me to get atomic control over something and doesn't have any positive impact. I'm sure others with less horizontal space would like to disable certain clusters.\n\n*For third party applications of the world this means they can support one “linux” thing.\nNot at all. Not even for application only targeting Ubuntu. Some users (raises a hand) really dislike IA so remove it. Not all supported versions of Ubuntu run IA. Other distributions aren't picking up IA with the same enthusiasm.\nIn short, application developers need to do more work now than they did before. Even more so if Ubuntu does drop the Notification Area (if it hasn't already).\n\n*Everything behaves the same in both desktops and everything is consistent.\nApart from when you use an application where IA isn't targeted. Then you have IA and NA looking different, working different and the effect is about fourteen miles worse than just using NA.\n\n*My tray doesn’t feel like a back alley.\nI won't repeat everything from the first point but it now feels like an incapable section that is practically only good for indicating things. There's an illusion of control but it's overshadowed by too many clicks and a lack of tooltip-driven feedback.\nI honestly think that Microsoft did it right in Windows XP. Show whatever's running and wants to show an icon but hide things that you never use.\nThat said, there are things that could improve how IA works. The major one being to use hover instead of click for selecting IA icon. That would reduce the need for tooltips and bring things back to single-click status. And if they do want to take over the world with it, they need to replace NA completely. The only way to do that is to take the same interface as NA does and support all the applications that NA currently provides.\nI wrote a post a while back documenting the regressions like this in 10.04. I have a bad feeling that within the next six months there's going to be a similar post about Unity which (unless it shows some unrealistically huge improvements soon) is just going to destroy the desktop experience.\n\nA: Design justification and analysis is available here.\n", "Q: Problem in switching from PL/SQL Developer to SQL Developer I want to become Ubuntu user, but SQL Developer is not comfortable enough for me. Main problem for me is that when I query data with select statemant and the result is displayed it is not possible to edit data directly (this feature is in PL\\SQL Developer). Does there exist solution for this: directly to edit queried data.\n\nA: If the queries are simple, just Click on Views -> Connections. Navigate to your desired  table and double click on it. From this window you can edit the data.\nFWIW PL/SQL Developer runs fine on WINE as well.\n", "Q: What office suite will be used in 11.04? Which office suite will be used in Ubuntu 11.04? Open Office or LibreOffice?\n\nA: Debian and Ubuntu have been using the Go-OO patched version of OOo for quite some time (e.g. the website link for OOo in Software Center points to the Go-OO site), and according to the Go-OO frontpage, Go-OO will be discontinued now that there is The Document Foundation / LibreOffice:\n\nGo-oo joins forces with LibreOffice\nGo-oo shares much of its goals and philosophy with The Document\n  Foundation's LibreOffice project, we're therefore supporting LibreOffice\n  since it's inception, and are in the process of merging most of our patches\n  over, as well as migrating to Document Foundation infrastructure. Going\n  forward, the Go-oo project will be discontinued in favor of LibreOffice.\n\nCurrently LibreOffice is upstream OOo (= Oracle) + Go-OO patches (mostly Novell) + some other various patches.\nSo if LibreOffice 3.3 is released in time for Natty, I guess there would be no point in releasing anything else—releasing standard OOo without those patches would result in a serious loss of functionality.  (Of course, if Oracle agrees with that, it could still be named OpenOffice.org like now, but I somehow doubt that will happen...)\n\nA: If I remember a UDS session correctly someone from the Desktop Team told me that LibreOffice will be shipped in Natty.\n\nA: It is Libreoffice. For more on Libreoffice and Ubuntu, please take a look at the Ubuntu wiki page.\n\nA: you can read information here\n", "Q: Why do some people need low-contrast themes? Everyone is familiar with the high-contrast themes that are created for people with poor eye-sight. Because of the high contrast it is easier to see what is on the screen.\nHowever, I heard there are also low-contrast themes. Could someone give some examples, but most importantly, could someone explain why there are low-contrast themes and who are helped by it? \n\nA: In an attempt to answer your question, low-contrast themes have the advantage of being simpler and cleaner. Even though its harder to identify what's on the screen, some people find that low contrast themes are less shocking than high contrast ones. \nI find low contrast themes useful when using the computer in a dark room, for example, because I don't have light reflecting on the screen. I hope it answers at least part of the question.\n\nA: I have had to install a (Windows) PC for somebody who needed low contrast themes in a previous job.  This woman could only see \"light\" and no colours, and had low vision in general.  (I think she said she had no cone cells or something like that, but it's been 2 years).  She used a low contrast theme in Windows that used 2 shades of blue.\nShe described looking at a screen with high contrast (e.g. black on white or white on black text) as \"looking straight into a spotlight and trying to see/read something that's written on it\".\nAt least one other almost blind person told me it was the same or similar for him (but his eyesight is so bad now that he does everything with a braille reader & TTS anyway—he also uses the console most of the time).\nBTW: I think it's possible to use compiz filters to show \"low contrast\" & \"high contrast\" versions of a normal display, but I don't know how well that works in practice?\n", "Q: How can I execute commands in a text file?

And Burning the CD is kind of an important step ;-)\n\nA: In an interview  Mark Shuttleworth talks about the strategy around this issue: \n\nAny plans on changing the one-cd\n  strategy, to get room for more\n  standard tools, like say a daemon\n  administration tool and a firewall?\nNo, it’s a good discipline, we need to\n  get better at helping people find\n  things like those tools of yours,\n  after they install and forcing less on\n  them up front.\n\n\nA: you can also buy ubuntu at half price books or check out this website http://distrowatch.com/ they sell thumb drives and CDs\n\nA: In countries like mine it pays to keep the installation media pretty small. What you install after is a matter of choice and ability. I do agree that a DVD version with some more umph would be great though.\n\nA: Try Edubuntu, it ships on DVD\n\nA: It does come in DVD sizes.. I keep one handy just in case.\nhttp://cdimage.ubuntu.com/dvd/current/\n\nA: \nInclude more apps\n\nI don't want more apps. I'm already uninstalling a bunch of unwanted apps and bulky libraries they depend on after a fresh install. Why should I have to download them just to have to get rid of them? Adding apps from repos is easy and results in less wasted bandwidth.\nSure, I install a lot of extra apps that aren't currently ubuntu-desktop deps. But they're probably not the same ones you install.\n\nthey don't include VLC because it doesn't fit so instead they include Totem which is a much worse player.\n\nWell that's very much a matter of opinion. VLC's a great player, in particular for its format support, but Totem, as a standard part of the GNOME desktop, fits the UI much better. All the Gstreamer stuff is coming along anyway, so installing the comparatively small Totem front-end is a no-brainer.\nSo I install VLC, yes, but could I claim it's an essential for the average desktop user? No. Indeed, parts of its interface, like the playlist, are pretty clumsy and newbie-hostile.\n\nLive CD and Instalation would be faster, since they wouldn't need compression at all\n\nThe installation process is disk IO-bound. The CPU usage from decompression is not a bottleneck.\n\nA: I am guessing it has something to do with wanting to make it available to as many people as possible, while the hardware isn't the real issue, the amount of time it would take to download a 1+gb  is rather long. Plus, not everyone has high speed internet, or have limits, say 5gbs a month... which a 4 gb download would eat it all up in one download.\n\nA: Because not everyone has broadband or unlimited download quotas.\n\nA: I don't believe that increasing the size of the disk image would allow Canonical to include more applications as the ~700MB CD image, when expanded and installed, eventually takes up ~4GB of drive space anyway. \nThere's no need to include an advanced application such as VLC as most average computer users have no need for it, and that's who Ubuntu is targeted at, and Totem fulfils their needs (and mine as a semi-power user and developer). If someone is in a situation where they need to use programs like VLC, GIMP and Inkscape, then they probably already know that they exist and how to get them.\nUbuntu's (this applied to Linux in general TBH) strength is that it meets the requirements of the majority of users with a footprint considerably smaller than that of Windows, and in fact I think during each development cycle Canonical should be finding ways to streamline the size of Ubuntu, not increase it.\n\nA: Older computers can't read DVDs, and a lot of people put Ubuntu on older machines to give them a second life, I doubt this is the main reasoning, but it is a factor to keep in mind. \n\nA: Ubuntu is moved to DVD\nUbuntu moved to dvd from ubuntu 12.10 onwards, Now ubuntu developers can breath easily (no size limit of cd):)\n", "Q: How can I create automated keyboard scripts?

Following an update, when I restart my system (automatic login is my preference), a dialog box appears with the text:\n\"Enter your password to unlock your login keyring\"\nWhat's wrong? Can anyone explain why this appears?\n\nA: You are using gnome-keyring (vault passwords for programs). Login to gdm unlocked base gnome-keyring, and if autologin base gnome-keyring to unlock accounts manually after autologin.\nYou can disable the use of gnome-keyring in programs that store passwords in it. Or change to another method of storing passwords in these programs (eg: base64 or plain)\n\nA: This is happening because your login password and the password for gnome-keyring is not matching. You might have changed the password of your user account. \nYou can resolve this in two ways:\n1). If you know your old password, Reset the password of gnome-keyring to current password of your user account.\n2). Delete the existing keyring.\nTo do these open a terminal and type the command seahorse. A window will open where you can manage the gnome-keyring and other keys. Under the 'Passwords' tab right click on the 'Passwords:login'. A menu opens and you can find both options (Change password and delete).\nYou can also delete the application that causing the error from the keyring list\n\nA: You can still use the gnome-keyring without having the annoying box popping up by setting your password for gnome-keyring to be the same as your login password.\nSee this answer for more information on how to do this.\n\nA: This happens if you defined to auto-login into Ubuntu (without your password) and the computer tries to login to a password protected wifi network.\nExplanation:\nEvery time you request to remember an external password, like log into a site and click on \"remember password\" (youtube, gmail, yahoo, etc.) and request to save the password, the password is saved into a file.\nIn order not to allow anyone to see these password, the file is encrypted so only you can have access to it - using your ubuntu password.\nThe wifi password is also protected in such a way, thus when logging in, the computer tries to connect to the WiFi, but needs to know the password, which is stored in the passwords file.\nTo unlock and read this password file, it requests the user to enter Ubuntu's passwrod.\nSolutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable the password protection by going to the \"passwords and encryption keys\" and changing the password of \"default\" keyring to none (Just don't type anything in the new password)\n\n*Just type the password when you log-in.\n\n*Not a complete solution: Make the wifi available to all user: How can I stop being prompted to unlock the 'default' keyring on boot?. You will still get the message when you open other applications that needs access to passwords, like the browser.\n\n\nYou should not disable the password if you are wary that someone may steel your computer and copy your passwords - Not my case, so I chose to disable the password protection.\n", "Q: Why not include something like Ksplice so there is no need to reboot after updating? Ksplice is an amazing software (or whatever it is). It changes the way kernel updates work: Instead of rebooting after an update, it patches memory, so you don't need to do anything.\n\nA: The Ubuntu Kernel Team does not currently have the resources available to perform the additional work to create (and test!) ksplice modules for all of the supported Ubuntu kernels. Uptrack is getting used on production systems in a lot of big companies. I would not dismiss it out of hand, since staying up to date with kernel vulnerability fixes is very important. If it's a choice between ksplice (and the potential dangers of not setting /proc/sys/kernel/modules_disabled to 1 immediately after booting), and waiting days or weeks for a good time to reboot, I'd recommend ksplice. And when you do reboot, the fresh \"real\" kernel will be waiting for you too.\n\nA: Well for one thing, injecting anything into the kernel is always a dangerous operation. For another AFAIK it's closed source and is only free on Desktop versions of Ubuntu and Fedora.\n", "Q: When will Ubuntu include delta updates? I'm tired of downloading 300mb updates. Windows has done delta updating since XP. It's just silly to download the whole thing if just a few bits of the package change.\n\nA: No .deb files are the de-facto method of installing and updating.\nThe method you mention is called delta updates and has been rejected as a method for several reasons, one of them being that calculating what to download takes up too much time (more mentioned in the link in the comments).\nAn alternative might be apt-fast.\n\nApt-fast is a script that can \"drastically improve APT download speed\" by using command line download accelerators such as Axel or Aria2 with multiple connections per package.\nInstallation\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:apt-fast/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install apt-fast\n\n\nExamples\n\nIt works the same as apt-get but you use (2 examples):\nsudo apt-fast install PACKAGE\nsudo apt-fast upgrade\n\napt-fast can also stop and resume downloads and download a package into a directory with apt-fast download PACKAGE.\n\nA: Delta-RPM was touted as the next killer package management feature, but it was less than fabulous mainly because of the calculations required. True if you are on a highly restricted bandwidth connection, it will save your time, but if all you want to do to save time consider using apt-fast a faster front-end to dpkg.\n\nA: There is a blueprint for it, and I would love to be able to make it happen for all sorts of reasons, but we haven't been able to find the time to do it - it doesn't help that it requires a significant chunk of time from the Launchpad archive infrastructure team, which has been entirely swamped.  It's still very much on our back-burner list for whenever we do find the time, though.\nOne likely issue is that the more you compress packages, the harder it is to sync them.  This is a fairly fundamental property of good compression algorithms.  It may be that even once we implement this there'll be some packages that will sync little better than the current situation.\nOther information:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/foundations-o-debdelta/\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDebdeltaSupport\n\nA: There is nothing on upgrading via deltas.

Tests like these could help to make your case. so far I have only heard of the better hardware compatibility of Compiz and suspect that it will be a better compositing system for Unity.\nHow the above two configurations compare with the latest Compiz on the old shell and  A test of Gnome Shell using its Mutter compositing running these applications would also be useful for comparison. Maybe someone at Phoronix could help in this regard if scientific presentation is desired but a honest personal experience being reported from such tests would be immensely useful I think.\nI know it is early days and I do not know the status of Unity with Compiz I surely hope we will not have to go back to the old days when it was a must to turn off compositing to get work done when using certain applications,especially since the Unity shell will be more dependent on compositing than the old shell, in other words what if we have to turn off compositing to use say, Blender,what will happen? \nHere is hoping that we will not have to wait another long time to get Unity/Compiz working well with applications that need 3d rendering.\n\nA: I don't know how it may impact some specific apps, but in my case (I have a ATI 4850), running Compiz instead of Metacity was MUCH MUCH faster. This is because the window drawing job was done by GPU instead of CPU. However, since GPU is doing something else than rendering stuff in google earth, it's performance may decrease a tiny bit. Thats why in Windows when you open a game, it disables transparencies and fancy stuff.\n\nA: With a properly performing video card driver there should be almost no decrease in performance for regular applications. Video games running at 100 frames per second are certainly going to see a performance loss due to the extra copy and communication involved but there is no compiz-level solution for this.\n\nA: In reality, Mutter and Compiz use a similar compositing engine, so you are going to get the same kind of slowdowns on each window managers.\nThe only real solution to the slowdown problem is a hack which places fullscreen windows on top of our openGL scene. However this means that you can't draw notifications or anything up there since they need to be painted in the openGL scene.\nWe should look into exposing GEM buffer objects as FBOs directly to compiz rather than exposing them as pixmaps. This will get us the few FPS boost that we need to display those applications at full speed. This will be far in the future though.\n", "Q: Why can't I load this website except on Windows? http://www.battleswarmzone-.spruz.com/ fails to load on my system under ubuntu, but loads under windows.

My current method is to mount the filesystem via SSH using Nautilus's graphical interface, but I would much prefer to be able to use some tool that mounts the AFS filesystem and gives me access to AFS-specific features (permissions, etc.).

Also, assuming I get OpenAFS installed, I'm not quite sure how to actually mount the remote filesystem to, say, /media/afs or some directory.\nI'm running Maverick with the 2.6.36-020636-generic kernel from http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/\nThanks for the help!\n\nA: Update: In the end, it appeared that the problem was due to using the mainline kernel. Once the Ubuntu kernel was updated to include vga_switcheroo, I tried again and installing OpenAFS via apt-get worked just fine. Running sudo service openafs-client start starts OpenAFS and mounts the AFS directory at /afs, and I use klog username to authenticate via Kerberos.\n\nA: \nAlso, assuming I get OpenAFS installed, I'm not quite sure how to actually mount the remote filesystem to, say, /media/afs or some directory.\n\nTo specifically answer this part, this can be done by passing the -mountdir option to afsd, or modifying the /etc/openafs/cacheinfo file. To mount AFS on /media/afs instead of just /afs, pass -mountdir /media/afs to afsd, or specify the /media/afs directory in the first field inside /etc/openafs/cacheinfo. See afsd(8) and cacheinfo(5). AFS is traditionally always mounted on /afs, though; there's usually no reason to change it.\nIn order to pass the -mountdir option to afsd in Ubuntu, you need to modify /etc/openafs/afs.conf before the openafs client starts, and add the extra options to the OPTIONS or VERBOSE variables. It's probably easier to just modify cacheinfo instead.\n\nA: Check this article: http://lug.rose-hulman.edu/wiki/HOWTO_Use_sshfs_to_mount_AFS/DFS_home\nHope this will help\n", "Q: Why do some GTK+ themes have transparency?

Oftentimes when I'm reading about some program, be it GNOME Do or Banshee or something else, I see people writing that they use mono -- and the implication is pejorative. Why is this? Are these comments made on practical grounds, ideological ones, or something else?\n\nA: Mono is a open porting of Microsoft .net. \nOn the ideological ground, this makes use of a closed technology for open technologies and that may not coincide with some ideals of GNU, and/or Linux.\nOn the practical ground, Mono is not (for now) supporting as much functionnalities as .NET does in its 3.5 version. However, it allows to program in C# (and other .NET languages) for Linux, which I think is a good thing and would be impossible without Mono.\n\nA: As others have stated there are two main reasons:\n1) Ideology: Users aren't comfortable with the idea that Mono is based on a closed source Microsoft product. However, Mono itself is open-source.\n2) Patents: This used to be a major concern which has since been addressed by Microsoft when they applied the Community Promise to ECMA 334 and ECMA specs 335. Unfortunately a substantial portion of people are unaware of this.\n\nA: Ideologically\nMono is supposed by some to be supporting Microsoft and its .Net platform.  Some people believe this is counter to the goals of Ubuntu, or at least their own personal goals, and they want to avoid that.\nSorry for the wiggle words, but I'm staying objective.  The discussion of whether Mono actually does this, and even whether supporting Microsoft is a good or bad thing, belongs elsewhere.\nPractically\nPrograms which use a virtual machine (as those written in Java and C# do), tend to use more memory, in my experience, compared to equivalents that don't.  This generalization doesn't always hold.  While there are users for which this is a valid concern, people often worry about performance more than necessary.\nFor example, I'm using a laptop with only 1GB of memory: this used to be huge.  The machine is starting to show it's age, but I can still run most things comfortably.  Users with 4GB of memory will not notice \"memory hogs\" nearly as much and should focus on other concerns.  (And I'll come back here in 5 years and laugh at that 4GB number.)\n\nA: Some people believe that Microsoft holds software patents over aspects of .NET, and that as an implementation of .NET, Mono violates those patents. Thus these people feel that using Mono could leave one open to patent lawsuits.\nI suppose Mono is so controversial because patent law in general is controversial. But then there are specific instances where entities that promote Mono have made agreements with Microsoft that look a lot like patent agreements, which could then be seen to strengthen Microsoft's argument for the validity of any such patents. (Of course, Microsoft hasn't actually provided any proof that the patents exist, thus maintaining a state of uncertainty, just as with their claim of patents violated by the linux kernel.) These agreements result in feelings of betrayal and distrust from other community members, because the agreement seems to hurt the community as a whole (by increasing the perceived patent risk) while benefiting the entity that made the agreement with Microsoft. So that leads to another reason that Mono is controversial: because some of Mono's main proponents have made controversial agreements with Microsoft.\nBy the way, I should mention that I write from the perspective of a spectator, and I have no detailed or specific knowledge of the whole situation. I've tried to remain unbiased and have mostly eschewed proper nouns so as to avoid dragging this question into the controversy that it asks about.\nEdit: In the comments, someone pointed out that Microsoft has a community promise not to assert patent rights against .NET implementations. But the promise has enough legalese in it that I don't feel I can really be sure that the promise provides air-tight protection without hiring a lawyer to go over it. After reading it, I can think of some potential loopholes that could allow Microsoft to assert patent rights over Mono, but since IANAL, I have no idea whether any of these loopholes are legally defensible, or just my misunderstanding of Microsoft's legalese. So while the community promise is encouraging, it certainly cannot end the controversy among  over Mono's possible patent liability.\n\nA: I don't use Mono because \n\n\n*\n\n*Microsoft alleges IP infringement without specifying what is being infringed and they have refused to clarify on Mono, only saying that Novell users are protected. I do not believe Microsoft's community promise until they back it up with actions.\n\n*Mono licensing is complicated.

(User IDs etc.) Say I have a home.tgz and want to drop that on a freshly installed ubuntu box.\nWhat do I need to do before I untar the file? Create users? What about user IDs? Groups? What about encryption?\n\nA: *\n\n*Create the user account, optionally with the same UID and GID as before and with the home directory in the same location (eg /home/sid)\n\n*Set the password\n\n*Untar the file into the user's home directory\n\n*Change ownership if you didn't use the same UID and GID as before\n\n*Add the user to any other groups required\n\n\n\nIf you want to simplify the process you'll need to do a couple of things.  In the following I'll assume the user is called mark. \n\n\n*\n\n*Record the group membership of the user: cd ~mark && id mark > mark.identity\n\n*Backup up the home directory from it's parent - for example if it's /home/mark then you'll want to to cd /home && tar jcpf mark.tar.bz2 mark\n\n*On the new host restore it to /home (cd /home && tar xjpf mark.tar.bz2)\n\n*Identify the group and username and group memberships and then restore them.

It wouldn't be hard to extend the script to check to see if each group existed and create it if not.  The above changes should take care of that.\nNote too that this won't take care of privileges gained through sudo.  It also won't help if you've got local email or anything else.  All it'll do is set the user up with the same groups as before.  Also, if a directory already exists it'll over-write it so some attention is required.\n\nA: In my test vm I added bob (1001) and alice (1002). I deleted bob and added joe (1001). Sorry I was wrong. You'll just have to reassign each user's home folder owner and group to each user.\nThis might seem tedious, but It's just a detailed explanation of the 3 steps.\nYou need super user privileges to do these maintenance tasks, so we prefix each command with sudo, which gives us those privileges.\nOn our new Ubuntu install:\n\n\n*\n\n*#1 create the user account: sudo adduser alice\n\n*#2 untar the backed up files into her new home directory\n\n*#3 make alice the owner of the files: sudo chown -R alice\\:alice /home/alice\nTo explain the commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*#1 adduser creates the /home/alice directory for us (among other things)\n\n*#3 the option -R means apply ownership recursively, alice\\:alice is how we specify the new owner\\:group for the files, and we tell chown to do this task on /home/alice.\n\n\nNow all files under /home/alice will belong to her, and she should have no issue accessing her files. Hope that makes more sense.\nCreate the new user account with the same name, then it will have the same UID as the old user account.

The flags merely represent each keyboard layout as the two letter designation rather than national flag images.  Currently, doing this causes all USA layouts to be represented with an image that has the letters \"US\".  \nI worked around this by using the Canadian keyboard layout as my Qwerty layout and USA-Dvorak as my Dvorak layout.

I am looking for a script which will provide optimum compression with 1024x768 size using command line tools like Imagemagick etc.\nHere is one that I did on MS Windows. Orginally It was 3008x2000. I used MS office picture manager to reduce the resolution to 1024x768 and the file size was around 600KB. Then I ran it through sea monster and the final outcome was 1024x768 resolution and the file size was 84 KB. Here is the picture:\n\nUsing the same process with Imagemagick and smoosh.it gives a picture which has a size of 314 KB.\n\nA: The quickest way to get off the ground is to shoot for something lossless. Resizing obviously can't help but lose data but if you use something like imagemagik to resize, leave the end quality quite high (at least 90%).\nTo compress, you have several options but the one I've had most luck with is Yahoo's Smush.it. It's an online webservice which means you have to upload your images. However there's a nice Python tool called Smooshy that does all this for you.\nThis is a lossless operation that basically keeps re-compressing the images until they start to show wear. In some cases, it can make a huge difference to filesize.\nThe bonus over jpegoptim is you don't have to worry about quality (it's always as good as the original) and it supports all formats. It just takes a little longer and you're bound by Yahoo's terms and conditions (they probably own your soul if you use it, etc).\n\nA: Using ImageMagik is quite easy\nmogrify -path destination/path -resize x768 -quality 90 source/path/*.jpg\n\nI've only defined height in the resize in order to ensure the image H/W ratio isn't altered, adjust quality parameter at will.\n", "Q: VNC doesn't work with compiz currently vnc (with nvidia gfx cards) dont work with compiz.. \nwill you be fixing this before 11.04 is released so that people can use vnc with the default desktop?\n\nA: The current VNC server in System/Preferences/Remote Desktop is called vino-server.  It doesn't currently support operation when Compiz (Desktop Effects) is enabled.\nTo work around this, you have to use a replacement vnc server.  I use x11vnc.\nsudo apt-get install x11vnc\n\nCrucially, you have to specifiy -noxdamage when you start the x11vnc server if you're intending to run Compiz.\nFirst, initialise x11vnc with a password :\n\nx11vnc -usepw\n\nand follow the prompts.  Then here's an example of how I run my vnc server:\n\nx11vnc -usepw -forever -noxdamage -scale 4/5 -avahi -nolookup -q\n\n\n\n*\n\n*avahi will mean that the server will advertise itself using avahi (multicast dns) \n\n*scale 4/5 will mean that a 1900x1200 screen will fit on a 1280x1024 screen.\n\n*nolookup means that the server won't try to lookup the client. No long pauses.\n\n*q will suppress some of the output to console.  Or use -logfile instead.\n\n*noxdamage will get your compiz effects working.\n\n*forever just means that the server will keep running after a client disconnects.\n\n\nIf you do a \"man x11vnc\", you'll see that there's a raft of additional options.  But the ones specified above should get you running.\nIf you need to run this on startup, I personally run this in /etc/rc.local, but I'm sure there are better ways.  EDIT : And there are easier ways, detailed on this very site : How to run scripts on start up?.  So, I suppose the easiest is the crontab -e option, but you could also save the command as a script somewhere, then just specify it in system/preferences/startup apps.\n\nA: the nodamage option works, but unless you're on a very fast network it's a bad idea - it forces everything to update all the time even if it doesn't change, which uses a huge amount of bandwidth.\n\nA: Correcting @Scaine's great answer, it is possible to use vino-server with compiz effects enabled.\nHere is how to disable xdamage in vino, and thus make VNC work with compiz:\ngsettings set org.gnome.Vino disable-xdamage true\n\nDone!\nNow you can use Ubuntu's default \"Desktop Sharing\" using even with Unity 3D. No need to install x11vnc\nBut, as others have pointed out, disabling xdamage causes huge network traffic. Not a big issue in a local network, but performance may suffer if remote controlling over the internet.\n\nA: If you enable desktop visual effects ( set to Extra ) with proprietary nvidia driver, vnc to the machine WORKS but the screen is frozen after you initially log in and you can't see anything ( except a frozen picture ). It works correctly with the opensource drivers ( well at least for ATI ).\n\nA: I am using a mac book pro to control my ubuntu desktop.

Here is the invalid UTF-8 byte it found in my sample file ...\n\"H.Bork, Gøte-borg.\"  ... the \"ø\" = F8 hex... which is an invalid UTF-8 character.\n\nA: iconv is probably what you'll want to use. iconv -l will show you the available encodings and then you can use a couple of commands to recode them all:\n# all text files are in ./originals/\n# new files will be written to ./newversions/\n\nmkdir -p newversions\ncd originals\nfor file in *.txt; do\n    cat $file | iconv -f ASCII -t utf-8 > ../newversions/$file;\ndone\n\nIf you want to do this with files you don't the encoding of (because they're all over the place), you want to bring in a few more commands: find, file, awk and sed.

The syntax of find might preclude it from being within a for loop. I'd hope that somebody else with more bash experience could jump in there and sort it out so it does the right thing.\n\nA: Gedit can detect the correct character set only if it is listed at \"File-Open-Character encoding\".\nYou can alter this list but keep in mind that the order is important.\n\nA: You can use any of the 3 command lines :\ngedit --encoding=utf-8 filename\ngedit --encoding=iso-8859-15 filename\ngedit --encoding=utf-16 filename\n. . . . .\n\n\nA: I've been thinking about this a bit more...  \nYes, the \"ø\" = 0xF8 hex* was definitely the reason why gedit would not open the file...\nWhy?

The reason why text mode used is that the installer just plays safe, I guess. \nThis is also the plymouth that you get after installation when the installed machine has graphics drivers incapable of using kernel mode switching, so I would not suggest removing it.\n\nA: You may want to use this to trigger the right update functions when you change your plymouth theme\nsudo update-alternatives --config default.plymouth\n\n", "Q: Suddenly the screen turns black and error (process:328): GLib-WARNING **: getpwuid_r(): failed due to unknown user id (0) I'm using ubuntu 10.10 and today during surfing suddenly the screen turned black with this error message \n(process:295): GLib-WARNING **: getpwuid_r(): failed due to unknown user id (0)\n\nWhat can be the reason?\n\nA: The error messages is specifically coming from plymouth; there's a fix being tested as described at https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/649917 . I'm assuming what's happened is that X has crashed and the message was displayed earlier in the boot process and was left on the display when X crashed.\n\nA: This warning message is related to a warning during booting, and happens for everyone from time to time. It, in itself, has nothing to do with the problem with your Desktop session disappearing. As mentioned in the other answers, try using Alt-F7 or Alt-F8 to see if the console switched accidentally. (Alt-F1 through Alt-F6 are text consoles, and Alt-F7 and above are the consoles traditionally used for your Desktop sessions.)\n\nA: You may press accidentally Ctrl-Alt-F8..F12 key while surfing? If yes, you switch to debug console. Message itself is harmless, I see it on my notebook every startup. Next time it appears, try Ctrl-Alt-F7 to return to your X session.\n\nA: As others have said, the message you quote is probably irrelevant to the real problem, which is that your X server disappeared.\nCheck out these pages for how to localize the problem and report a bug:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Reporting\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting\nHave a look in /var/log/kern.log for a message about an error in Xorg.\n", "Q: The future of the Ubuntu family How would the Unity path Canonical is going through regarding desktop environment affect the other flavours of Ubuntu? \nI mean official or almost Kubuntu, Xubuntu, and perhaps others not officially supported variations will follow a different path...\n\nA: Most likely it will not affect them at all. Kubuntu and Xubuntu are community efforts; there is very little direct contribution from Canonical to these projects. For instance, I believe that there is only one developer paid by Canonical working on Kubuntu. Xubuntu doesn't have any. Canonical's main contribution to these projects is infrastructure.\nEach of these projects has been driven by the strong communities which have grown around them. The fact that Canonical has decided to push Unity will not change that. In fact, if any thing, I wouldn't be surprised if the community ends up creating a new \"buntu.\" I imagine that there will be people interested in working on a stock GNOME derivative. Gubuntu perhaps?\n", "Q: How do I get and install an unmodified kernel? So, I want to learn how to develop drivers for Linux. \nAnd for that I heard it's recommended to use an unmodified kernel, since distributions can patch/change it a lot.\nI downloaded Ubuntu 10.04 (lucid): http://releases.ubuntu.com/lucid/ubuntu-10.04.1-desktop-i386.iso.torrent\nI found this page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/MainlineBuilds\nHow do I know what's the most compatible kernel version for that Ubuntu release ?\nI could not understand from the wiki page.\n\nA: If you click through to see what's available, you'll see that many of the kernels end in the release name (that is -maverick, -lucid etc).\nThe most compatible ones will be the ones for the release you're using. In your case, 10.04 is Lucid.\nBut it is usually possible to mismatch versions pretty heavily. I used a -maverick kernel on Lucid for quite a while and then switched back to compiling them straight from kernel.org myself (as I still do).\n\nA: all your need is compile a kernel from source here you have all information you need for this purpose, how to get as oli say, what package do you need, how to install, etc..  \n", "Q: Will ConnMan replace NetworkManager on the desktop for 11.04? In the 10.10 release, Unity on the netbook edition used ConnMan. As Unity is now moving to the desktop for 11.04, will that mean that ConnMan will replace NetworkManager on the default Ubuntu desktop as well?\n\nA: I second that, there is no plan to make the new connman-based network menu the default for Natty.\n\nA: The systray (old notification area) will go away in 11.04. NetworkManager is the most critical piece that still uses it. We have three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move to the new indicator-network which uses Connection Manager as a backend,\n\n*Provide patches for NM-applet that enable it to use the AppIndicator framework, and\n\n*Hack the systray so it only supports NM-applet\n\n\nThe Ubuntu Platform team is working on the NM-applet-indicator option, and it's their decision which approach is taken in the final release.\n\nA: No; the plan seems to be to enhance indicator-network / patch NM to use NM as a backend. \nThere's no blueprint yet, but the content of the Gobby document from UDS is here.\nSee Mark's answer for details.\n\nA: There are many reasons why indicator-network wasn't made default in the Natty release:\n1) Doesn't support all encryption options (you already mentioned that in your question).\n2) Hasn't been tested heavily (its a new project).\n3) Ubuntu has been using nm-applet since quite some time, and hence it was much better for them to just port it to the indicator rather than start from scratch.\nProbably indicator-network will become default in a future release of Ubuntu after it meets all of the above points. Good things take time to come by™.\n\nA: Go to System - Preferences - Startup Applications. In there, search for Network Manager, select it, click Edit, and provide the following values:\n\n\n*\n\n*Name: Network Manager applet\n\n*Command: /usr/bin/nm-applet\n\n*Check: Launch at login\nThe next time you log in, you should see the applet appear.\n", "Q: Hibernate and Suspend do not exist anymore, help When I close the lid of my laptop and open it after some time I am greeted with a message \"Failed to suspend\".\nWhen I tried to manually suspend/hibernate, I saw these options are not available there at all.

I have assigned static IP to both the laptops and both get connected quite easily. I can access all ubuntu services like ssh, squid, samba from the laptop running MS Windows. But from Ubuntu machine I cannot access any Windows services like shared directories etc. The Windows machine doesn't even respond to ping requests from ubuntu. \n\nA: To be honest this sounds like the Windows Firewall is running. You will want to disable the firewall on just the 'adapter' you created to make the ad-hoc connection.\n\nA: Actually you dont even need to install any tool.\nOn the Ubuntu machine sharing an internet connection.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Network Connections\n\n*Then Wireless Connections\n\n*Then Add\n\n*Enter a SSID, choose mode : Ad-Hoc\n\n*IPv4 Settings choose as a method : shared to other computers\n\n*(you may want to establish a wireless security)\n\n*Connect to the network (if you do not see it, you may disable and then enable your network manager)\n\n\nOn the Windows machine after the ubuntu machine is connected to the Ad-Hoc Network\n\n\n*\n\n*See the Wireless Networks and connect to the wireless network.\n\n\nThats it. You should now be able to use the internet connection provided by the ubuntu machine.\nGood luck\n\nA: First, it won't respond to a ping... open up Network Connections, then right-click on your Ad-Hoc adapter and click Properties. Go to the Advanced tab, and click Settings under ICMP. You want to make sure \"Allow incoming echo requests\" is checked here. If it is, then Windows probably isn't explicitly blocking the ping. \nJust to rule it out, what are you using for a gateway address in your Static IP setup? Presumably it should be the static IP of the Windows laptop.\nDo you have any other Windows boxes you could connect to the ad-hoc network? It might be worth testing their ability to see the network shares of the XP machine.\n\nA: install and configure firestarter tool, when finised, create ad-hoc connection then change the IPv4 method to \"shared to other computer\".\n", "Q: How do I create a wireless ad-hoc network? Whenever I need to copy some files and couldn't find a pen drive (I don't have bluetooth enabled in my laptop), I create a new ad-hoc wireless network in Windows and share the necessary files on the network and share files with the other system.\nNow, I want to do the same with Ubuntu. \nI can create a new network, but I am not able to share or send files.\nI also don't know how to access the system connected to the network.\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: Do you have Samba installed? Run the following:\nsudo apt-get install samba\n\nThen you need to set up samba:\nhttp://www.samba.netfirms.com/addusers.htm\n\nA: You just need to click the network icon, and choose \"Create new wireless network\" from the menu.\nA popup will come up asking you for a name and optionally a password. Once you are done, you can connect to this network using other systems as you would with Windows.\n\nA: So, just to check, when you do this in Windows, you create a new ad-hoc network, set a folder shareable, and then move to another computer, connect to the Windows machine you just set up, and use Windows' \"Network Places\" to find the share and copy the files?\nIf I have that right, then you should be able to do exactly the same in Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the Network icon at the top, select Create New Wireless Network, give it a name and a password, and click Create. (I think you already did this anyway.)\n\n*Open the file browser (it's called Nautilus, but you don't actually see that anywhere on screen ...). Basically it's what comes up when you click the Home Folder icon on the launcher.\n\n*Navigate to the folder you want, and (this is the annoying bit) go up one level to that folder's parent. Then find the folder you want in the list, right click on it, and select Sharing Options from the menu.\n\n*Set the folder to shared (and you probably want to allow guest access). When you check the box a window might pop up prompting you to install the sharing service. If you don't see anything, then you've already go it.\n\n*Once everything is installed, and the folder is shared, it should show up on the network just like any windows share. It thing you have to restart for it to work properly though.\nAlternatively, if you want to see shares on other machines from Ubuntu, the Nautilus file browser can do that too, in theory. Just click Browse Network, and then Windows Network. I'm not sure, but I think you need samba installed to do this smoothly also, but maybe I've just been having other trouble. If you don't see anything on the network, then go to the file manager, open the File menu at the top, and select Connect to server (type is Windows share) - that pretty much always works for me.\n", "Q: Will there be the normal GNOME desktop available for download Will we have a GNOME version of Ubuntu available for download like Kubuntu is for KDE and Xubuntu is for Xfce. Maybe something like 'Gubuntu' for GNOME\n\nA: \"GNOME version of Ubuntu\" is not a good definition, since the default Unity variant will also be using GNOME extensively (but not GNOME Shell). Unity and GNOME are not mutually exclusive.\nIf you mean a non-Unity GNOME version, it won't be \"available for download\", but on the CD and installed by default, since it will be the fallback for systems that can't run Unity.\n\nA: There is currently an unofficial community-led GNOME Shell remix of Ubuntu under development called Gnomebuntu, which aims to become an officially-recognized variant later on. You can follow developments on the project here. (There is an official website for it, but as of this writing all it has is a nice-looking placeholder.)\n9/3/2012 UPDATE: The project is now called Ubuntu GNOME Remix after the original name was blocked by the GNOME project, and an initial alpha version is now available for download here.\n", "Q: How do I reset the icons in the notification area back to their default locations? I restarted my computer and now they are all out of order, how do I put them back in the proper order?\n\n\nA: Move your current panel configuration so it is no longer used:\nmv ~/.gconf/apps/panel ~/panel_backup\nLog out and then log back in, you will now have the default panel setup.\n\nA: You can move any panel applet by right clicking on it (right click just between the items in the notification area), unticking 'Lock to Panel' and clicking 'move'. You can then drag it along the panel with your mouse and drop it with a left click. Aftwerwards, right click again and tick 'Lock to Panel'.\n\nYou can refresh the panel by pressing Alt+F2 and entering killall gnome-panel or you can enter xkill and then click on the panel.\n\n\nA: Have you ever plugged in an extrnal monitor or moved the icons around?  I noticed this seemed to start for me after plugging in an external monitor and enabling it in the Nvidia settings for the first time.\n\nA: Another trick is to killall gnome-panel. This works mainly for visual glitches, but may also work for arrangement.\n", "Q: wifi works on Windows Vista, but not on Ubuntu I am not able to connect to Wifi using Ubuntu 10.04, but on the same machine I am able to connect to it using Windows Vista.\nI had posted this question about it earlier, but none of the solutions work.\nI have the Ubuntu 10.04 LTS CD with me, how can I get Wifi to work?\n\nA: have you tried this post it all about broadcom 43xx wifi card install , problem solution, etc\n\nA: have to tried finding additional drivers?\nsystem-> administration->additional drivers.\nyou will have to connect to the internet by Ethernet to download the packages for the upgrade to make the driver work.\n", "Q: Run (system) script on SSH login and/or logout I'd like my OpenSSH server to start a script whenever a user logs in using SSH, ideally passing the host name or IP, as well as the user name. Additionally I'd like it to run a script, whenever a session is terminated (passing the username). These scripts should not run in the user's session, but system wide.\nThe idea is to give an audio warning on login and logout, e.g. using espeak, and to display the information on an external display.\nI've seen that there is a pam-scripts package but I'm not sure if this does what I want, nor how to use it.\n\nA: You can force a command onto your SSH-users instead of the one they request (or their shell if they don't give a specific command).  This can be done by specifying that command with something like ForceCommand /root/ssh-wrapper in /etc/ssh/sshd_config (it doesn't matter where the script is located or how it's named, just make sure it is executable by all users and the sshd configuration file points to it).  You also need to restart/reload sshd.  The original command is accessible to the forced command as $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND.\nI just hacked this script together:\n#! /bin/sh\n\n# add logger options when needed\nlog=\"logger -t ssh-wrapper\"\n\n# find IP address\nip=`echo $SSH_CONNECTION | cut -d \" \" -f 1`\n\n$log $USER login from $ip\nespeak \"$USER just logged in from $ip\" > /dev/null 2>&1\n\n$log command: ${SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND:-shell}\n${SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND:-shell}\n\n$log $USER logout\nespeak \"$USER just logged out\" > /dev/null 2>&1\n\nNow every time I login or logout a voice tells me about it, and a log entry gets written to syslog.  It also logs the command.  You can use something like the following to \"follow\" your sshd usage:\ntailf /var/log/syslog | grep ssh-wrapper\n\nPlease note that this script is mostly untested, so use at your own risk!  ;-)\nPS: remember that this script is run as the user that logged in, so you can't do everything you want if you change it to add more features...\n\nA: I've seen this matching events in log file before (which would allow you flexibility on matching anything). This page is poorly formatted but it might help you get started:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/AudibleLogs#Play with esound\n\nA: You can use the sshrc (man sshd , search for sshrc)\nssh will execute the /etc/ssh/sshrc if it exists and you can run one script (or call multiple scripts) from there\nyou can call any bash variable, like $USER or get the IP via \nread -d \" \" ip <<< $SSH_CONNECTION\n\nyou can write a script to test or log what ever you want.\nLogout script... well, that is what i'm searching for! :D\n\nA: (Answer cross-posted from the same question on ServerFault)\nJust write a script to do whatever you want and then stick it in /etc/profile or possibly/etc/bash.bashrc depending on your needs. Changes to those files will apply to all users. I'm not sure how you'd go about notifying on logout with this approach, though.\nAlternatively, another way to do this would be to have a simple daemon monitoring /var/log/auth for new (and closing) ssh sessions. That way it would be able to send notifications on both login and logout.\n\nA: I think PAM is the best option. It's system-wide and can't be overriden by user's config files.\nYou can follow these steps. They worked for me on Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS.\nRun:\n$ sudo pico /opt/custom/bin/info-session.sh\n\nEdit that empty file and add these lines:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n[ \"$PAM_TYPE\" = \"open_session\" ] || exit 0\n\nINFO=$(date +\"%Y/%m/%d %T $PAM_USER ($PAM_RHOST) $PAM_SERVICE $PAM_TTY\") # You can customize message.\n\necho \"PAM access: $INFO\" | write user > /dev/null 2>&1 # See Note 1.\n\nexit 0\n\nAfter that, give execute permission to the script:\n$ sudo chmod ugo+x /opt/custom/bin/info-session.sh\n\nNow, run:\n$ sudo pico /etc/pam.d/common-session\n\nAdd these lines at the end of the file:\n# Modified by user:\nsession optional pam_exec.so /opt/custom/bin/info-session.sh\n\nThere's no need to restart any service. Note that this script will also be run when a user logs in from terminal instead of SSH.\nNote 1: You can pipe to espeak or any other process which fits your needs (email, push notification, and so on...). If you use write and user is logged in, he or she will see output messages directly on their terminal.\nReferences:\nhttps://blog.stalkr.net/2010/11/login-notifications-pamexec-scripting.html\nhttps://blog.redbranch.net/2014/06/04/pam_exec-so-execute-commands-on-user-login/\nRelated:\nHow do I set up an email alert when a ssh login is successful?\nhttps://serverfault.com/questions/400613/how-can-i-configure-my-server-to-notify-me-whenever-it-is-remotely-accessed-via\nhttps://serverfault.com/questions/395393/email-notification-about-each-ssh-connection-to-linux-server\n", "Q: How do I bring Unity interface in-front of all other windows?

I have been using Ubuntu since 9.04 without many (serious) problems.\nI installed the 10.10 CD and put it on a flash drive after reading online that startup disk creator breaks with maverick. When I booted from flash, it would get completely stuck (no cursor, no blinking line at the top, just nothing!). So I went back to my Lucid install and ran update-manager -d. When the upgrade was done, I rebooted and was faced with the same problem again. \nI had to manually edit the grub.cfg file to set the old Lucid kernel as default. I was faced with a new problem: VirtualBox couldn't find the kernel files because upgrading the kernel deleted some files that were required.\nWhat I need to know is if there is a way to upgrade from Lucid to Maverick without the new kernel (I still don't understand why it broke, but oh well!)\n\n\n*\n\n*Toshiba Satellite A215, Dual core AMD athlon-X2\n\n*ATI Radeon X1200 (been using the default driver for it since jaunty)\n\n*Ubuntu Lucid with latest updates\n\n\nA: I would recommend opening a bug (type ubuntu-bug linux) and trying to get the Maverick kernel fixed instead.\nBut, if you absolutely cannot avoid it, and need to run the Lucid kernel on a Maverick userspace, you will need to manually install (and update!) the Lucid kernel (as well as its headers, for VirtualBox). Here is the procedure I would recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit your /etc/apt/sources.list to include:\n\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu lucid main restricted universe multiverse\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu lucid-updates main restricted universe multiverse\ndeb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu lucid-security main restricted universe multiverse\n\n\n*sudo apt-get update\n\n*sudo apt-get install -y linux-image-2.6.32-25-generic linux-headers-2.6.32-25-generic\n\n*Remove the Lucid lines from /etc/apt/sources.list\n\n*sudo apt-get update\n\n*Edit /etc/default/grub and change GRUB_DEFAULT to the number kernel that will be Lucid.\n\n*sudo update-grub\nI don't recommend removing linux-generic or linux-image-generic, since in theory the Maverick kernel will be fixed and you'll want to be able to always try the latest.\nAnd again, since you will not be getting automatic updates, you will need to manually install newer Lucid kernels as they get published.\n\nA: If you are frustrated by upgrades, then why do it? It sounds like you are a good candidate for LTS only and not follow the six month upgrade cycle. \nLucid has 2 1/2 more years of support which is one more than Maverick which just came out. You can get newer packages by enabling backports in Lucid and keep your old kernel. \nI sense more frustration to come because if you upgrade successfully to Maverick then you will be forced to upgrade every six months till the next LTS or do a fresh installation at some point, when you could just upgrade once from LTS to LTS. Just something to consider. \n\nA: yes you can the way I have set this up create a new partition and install on the second partition and when you reboot you will have the choice to boot either systems i hope this helps \n\nA: It is the same as configuring Grub: hold Shift during boot-up and you can still chose between various installed kernels.\nBut some features of Maverik are kernel-dependent. You can run any distribution with any kernel you want, however this isn't the officially supported default. \n", "Q: Installing matcad11 or matcad14 I was wondering if anyone knows if I can install and run matcad11 or 14 on my system.\n\nA: Mathcad does not have a version for Ubuntu, but Wine is a program that makes it possible to run many Windows programs on Ubuntu. You can install Wine through the Ubuntu Software Center. (By the way, feel free to ask if you need help getting things set up in Wine.) Mathcad 11 appears to work pretty well through Wine (see here); animations may not work, though. Mathcad 14 might work well through wine (see here). Either version appears to need some tweaking to get running.\nIf it won't work through Wine (or its versions like the commercially-supported CrossOver Linux), then I don't know of another way to get that specific program to work in Ubuntu.\nThere may, however, be acceptable replacements on Ubuntu. This blog post refers to SMath Studio as a \"free Mathcad alternative for Windows, Linux and Windows Mobile\".

On top of it I am running a VMWare Server Edition, which needs to recompile it's modules whenever a new kernel is installed. For that I'm executing: sudo vmware-config.pl\nUntil now, whenever a new version of the kernel was available I installed it, rebooted the system and rebuild the modules. But now I realized - rather by accident -, that rebuilding those kernel modules even worked without rebooting the system. VMWare is even able to startup again after that. That made me curious. I entered uname -r to see the kernel version, which showed me exactly the version I installed right before without rebooting the system. \nThe Manpages for uname are not exactly detailed on what is actually printed, but so far I thought it printed the actually running kernel version.\nMy question now is: Is it really possible the kernel reloads itself without rebooting? I did not install ksplice or a similar tool. From what I get it is now even in the repositories for Ubuntu Server 8.04. What's going on with my system? Do I have to reboot after the kernel update or not? What does uname -r print? Is the Ubuntu Server Edition shipped with a program similar to ksplice? I never read anything about a feature like that!\nI checked what kees told me to do:\nuname -r\n2.6.24-28-server\n\nThe file in proc gave:\ncat /proc/version_signature\nUbuntu 2.6.24-28.75-server\n\nAnd dpkg:\ndpkg -l 'linux-image*' | grep ^.i\nii  linux-image-2.6.24-28-server          2.6.24-28.80\n\nObviously I should do a reboot then :)\nThanks for the detailed information!\n\nA: The output of uname -r only shows the version up to the \"ABI\" number, but there can be revisions of the ABI. Only when the ABI changes do third-party modules need to be recompiled.\nFor more details about what you're running, read the file /proc/version_signature:\ncat /proc/version_signature\nUbuntu 2.6.24-28.80-generic\n\nThis will show the kernel package version you're currently running which may differ from the most recently installed kernel. For example, in the above, the ABI is \"28\", which is as much as uname -r will show:\nuname -r\n2.6.24-28-generic\n\nThen you can see what you have installed with dpkg:\ndpkg -l 'linux-image*' | grep ^.i\nii  linux-image-2.6.24-27-generic              2.6.24-27.69                            Linux kernel image for version 2.6.24 on x86\nii  linux-image-2.6.24-28-generic              2.6.24-28.80                            Linux kernel image for version 2.6.24 on x86\nii  linux-image-generic                        2.6.24.28.30                            Generic Linux kernel image\n\nIn the above case, if the next kernel package that got installed was versioned as 2.6.24-28.81, it would only be the \"micro release\" that changed.  Since module compilations are tied to the ABI, no recompilation is needed, but you still need to reboot to get the kernel fixes. If the next kernel installed was versioned as 2.6.24-29.81, then the ABI will have changed, and you'll need to recompile modules after you've rebooted.\nFor more details about the ABI, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam/BuildSystem/ABI\n", "Q: Any complete GUI interface for Mercurial?

In my case most linux and ubuntu users I met was through a FOSS community.  \n", "Q: Website display problem - across all browsers whenever I go to getpersonas.com or youtube the page loads like this:\n\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: The reason for this is because your browser is not loading the stylesheet, which is hosted on another domain. Possible reasons could be due to the stylesheet domain being blocked or because your browser is failing to get DNS resolution for it. \nTry reaching getpersonas.com through a web proxy like:\nhttp://www.zendproxy.com\nIf the site displays properly via proxy, then try to disable ipv6. To do that in Firefox:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type about:config in the address bar, press Enter.\n\n*Find network.dns.disableIPv6 in the list.\n\n*Right-click -> Toggle. \n\n*Restart Firefox and try again.\n\n\nYou can also disable ipv6 on the system level, so other browsers don't get affected by ipv6 issues. To do that, open the file  /etc/default/grub with an editor:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nThen change the following line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=”quiet splash”\n\nWith the following line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=”ipv6.disable=1 quiet splash”\n\nThen update grub:\nsudo update-grub\n\nYou can also try a different DNS server like OpenDNS or Google Public DNS.\n\nA: It looks like you aren't loading the stylesheet. Clear your cache or hit F5.\n\nA: Alright I finally got it working.  The problem was my ISP's DNS doesn't play nice with Ubuntu.  So I changed my DNS to OpenDNS and that fixed it.\n\nA: You could try to set up a new Firefox profile for testing reasons. First, make sure all instances of Firefox are closed! It might take some time for the process to end even though Firefox is not visible any more.\nIf the commands below do not work make sure Firefox is closed by typing the following in a shell.\nkillall firefox-bin\n\nThen run the Firefox Profile Manager. You can do that by entering the following command from a shell or by pressing Alt+F2 and entering it there:\nfirefox -profilemanager\n\nYou can setup a new profile there and try if it works with that fresh one. Be aware that the newly created profile will be set as new default. Do switch back to your original profile you have to start the profile manager again and select to start the appropriate profile.\nSee MozillaZine for more information on the profile manager.\nIf just read lovinglinux's answer and just wanted to let you know that - in case you tried to solve the issue with a new profile - you should get the same problem again, as setting up a new profile also uses the default about:config settings which are to use ipv6 by default (network.dns.disableIPv6=False). If the new profile solved your problems we have to search somewhere else for the problem. See MozillaZine for details on the option.\n\nA: Looks like there is a problem with the CSS file(s).

When I turn it on it auto-logs-in to the desktop automatically, but when I try to connect to the wireless network it wants my Keyring password to store the password.  Problem is it isn't in the documentation (yes, I read the documentation.)\nI see a lot of people asking about \"Enter password to unlock your login keyring\" and the cause usually centers around either they forgot the password, or the keyring password is different than the login password. So the advice is either how to change the keyring password to match the login, or deleting the keyring and creating a new one with a password they remember.\nWhile I could delete and recreate the keyring, I still wouldn't know the login password. Without the login password I cannot run sudo either.   I tried blank for the keyring password and that didn't work either.\nAlso, I know that the root password is blank, and the account is disabled.  So I am not asking about that.\nQuestion comes down to this: Is there a way to discover the password for the account that was auto-logged in? If not can I change it?  I'm up for reinstalling if I have to, but would rather not.  Besides, it is a netbook and does not have a optical drive.\n\nA: i would suggest booting in safe mode (there you get a root shell even if you don't know the current password)\nand there you can reset your password by typing \npasswd <yourusername>\nthis will prompt you for a new one.\nhow to boot save mode:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/LostPassword\n", "Q: Where can I find all the milestones of the current Ubuntu development release?

I thought that there was no need to scan for viruses either in Ubuntu or any Linux distros until I found virus scanner packages clamtk and klamav in Ubuntu software center yesterday.\nThis leads to the following questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do viruses differ between Linux and Windows?\n\n*How do the strategies for protection differ between Linux and Windows?\n\n*Should a virus scanner package be installed on my system? If so, which would be a better option?\n\n\nA: Both klamav and clamtk are front-ends for the clamAV software.  They do check for linux viruses, but they are most useful for making sure your linux computer isn't sharing infected files with windows machines.  Most of the virus scanners for linux are actually for servers, and are meant to scan email or uploaded files as they are sent.  \nWikipedia has a list of Linux malware, which should help inform about the risks:\nLinux malware - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. They list 30 viruses and various other possible threats.\n\nA: There are some theoretical viruses that target Linux systems (whether specifically or cross-infectors that propagate through Ms-Windows), But there has never been a documented infection of Linux programs in normal desktop use.\nIf you are in the habit of regularly downloading Windows programs from the internet and running them using wine, then you should get an anti-virus to scan them. You might also think about limiting your wine usage to a different user account - in case a malicious windows program (infected or otherwise) wants to destroy your user data.\nOtherwise, don't bother.\n\nA: I always run an Antivirus on my systems - nevermind if it's Windows, OSX or Ubuntu/Linux. Never think you are safe - a system can ALWAYS be hacked or infected - even Linux based distros. I remember the one time I got malware from Gnomelook.org on Ubuntu, because I installed a screensaver for my Ubuntu system. Read here.\nAnd I have had 1-2 other Java malware coming on my Ubuntu system, because they were targeted for OSX and Windows, but it also ran on Ubuntu/Linux. Who knows what else I had during that time, because I didn't use an Antivirus.\nSure, the threat is much smaller right now (for Ubuntu/Linux based distros), but like Android: Once it gets more popular - you will see much more malware rise from the hidden ashes, because it's possible now already (my personal opinion combined with what I mentioned before).\nI use the free and personal edition of \"Bitdefender\" on my Ubuntu system, because Avast wasn't working with \"Ubuntu 12.04\" and everything else was too difficult to set-up. Sure, ClamAV is good and easy (it's in the Ubuntu Software Centre), but their reaction time to threats (at least in the past) has been very, very slow. ClamAV also misses a lot of Windows viruses -> detection rate is not that good, at least when compared to commercial products (like Bitdefender, Avast, etc).\nVerdict: Just my two cents on the subject. Never think you are safe, because you are not. A system can always be infected one way or the other - always. I haven't had a single problem with Bitdefender on Ubuntu and while an Antivirus/Security solution can never give you 100% security - it is better than nothing. I have been infected with malware both on OSX and Linux - on two systems where most ppl in the community said it couldn't happen or where I was told an Antivirus is not needed: Community Link \nOranges\n\nA: You may not need a virus scanner per se, but you sure do need to keep your system up to date and secure (good passwords and system practices - permissions etc)\nPersonal Anecdote: I had a debian server running, It had an uptime of 400 days and I wanted to get to 500 before restarting it to update the kernel,  I was being silly, and too cocky about it being a linux system . Since it was a server that served a research group, I gave all of my coworkers an ssh account. Turns out that some hacker exploited a bad password by one of my users and loaded on automated script that ran through 5 or 6 exploits before finding one that worked (an exploit that was patched, had I updated the kernel). It rooted the server and then proceeded to set up a bot (Campus IT caught the hack before I did, they noticed suspicious IRC traffic and contacted me).\nFunny story, is that I used those same scripts to take back control of the machine to backup some raw data before nuking the system.\nLong story short, keep your system up to date, keep your passwords secure, maintain good administrative practices. And unless you literally go and do sudo rm -rf /* because someone online told you to, it's unlikely you will ever have any trouble with your linux computer.\n\nA: You can try BitDefender Antivirus for unices. Its one of the best scanners ive tried with a intuitive GUI and regular updates. Unfortunately its a on demand only scanner but good for those e-mail attachments and USB Drives.\nhttp://www.bitdefender.com/world/business/antivirus-for-unices.html\n\nA: Speaking of all the security issues in general, but leaving out the viruses, Ubuntu has build-in security.\nHowever, Ubuntu will not stop you from installing malware like the Windows anti-viruses try to do. For example, if someone tricks you into installing software that will spy, spam, or destroy all your data then you're out of luck.\nMany more security mechanisms are available if you choose to set them up: firewall rules, anti-virus scanners, network monitoring, two-factor authentication, etc... These additional mechanisms are mostly intended for servers and you should not need to worry about them as a desktop user.\nHaving that said, there are many vulnerabilities and Linux systems get broken into every day all over the world. Security teams come-out with updates to fix these vulnerabilities regularly. Ubuntu has it's own security team that releases updates and advices for systems administrators.\nHere is an overview about anti-Viruses and Ubuntu security.\nIn practice Ubuntu is much safer than Windows. In terms of exposure to malware, Ubuntu is comparable to Mac. But as @Giacomo pointed out, living in a nearly virus free world can leave Mac users naive.\nThe top 2 things that you can do to stay extra safe:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install software only from the official repository\n\n*Keep your software up by letting the Update Manager do it's thing\n\n\nA: Yes Ubuntu has a default firewall, but you need to configure it\nUbuntu uses ufw to configure the firewall. But it may not be enabled by default.\nTo enable the firewall open a terminal and type:\nsudo ufw enable\n\nFurther info can be found in ufw's man page. In a terminal type:\nman ufw\n\nComing to antivirus part, ubuntu does not have a default antivirus, nor does any linux distro I know, You dont need a antivirus program in linux. Although, there are few available for linux, but linux is pretty much safe when it comes to virus.\n\nA: The short answer is NO, but if you share files with a Windows operating system then it wouldn't hurt to install a virus tool that you can run on your flash-drives and such to check if they are clean before distributing them among Windows users.\nAny viruses contained in files from a Windows machine will only affect the same computers.\n\nA: Actually not, there is a really low chance to get a virus using linux; to avoid malicious packages, try to install software only from the software centre or PPAs that you trust.\nIf you want to scan your files for windows viruses (in order to prevent your friends' PCs infection when exchanging files), you can use CLAMAV (which is the best natively-supported Linux antivirus)\n\nA: I disagree with traditional answers that claim that no virus scan is needed. It is exactly that attitude that is making linux more and more vulnerable.\nThe only reason that no virusscan is needed is because black hackers tend to focus more on Window$ and portable devices. We actually have very little data about the actual amount of viruses and trojans in linux. This is also because there are very few security firms working on it. There are a few minor, public tools. There have been viruses in the past:\nAlaeda – Virus.Linux.Alaeda\nBinom – Linux/Binom\nKagob a – Virus.Linux.Kagob.a\n\nDon't \"live in denial about linux malware.\" There is even a little guide, a how to.\nThat said, there is a virusscan in linux. It is a bit harder to use than traditional windows scanners, but I have used it in the past to get rid of viruses on jump drives that were infected on window$:\n sudo apt-get install clamav  # to install it\n man clamav  # for more info\n\nDon't worry too much about viruses, but don't pretend that there is 100% certainty that they do not exist. So my answer is: there is probably no need to install a virusscan that is continuously monitoring your system, just don't think that there will never be or never have been linux viruses or that you will never need a virusscan.\n\nA: It's not needed since (contrary to popular lies), linux is rather secure, and you are unlikely to get a virus for linux. Your risk is higher that you might pick up a windows virus while running wine, or that you may get hacked by a remote user (a rare occurrence on the desktop).\nMy suggestion: install gufw from software center, enable your firewall, along with some optional rules if you like, and optionally install clamav as well (along with fresh-clam).\nOverall, your best defense, is to be armed with knowledge. A good way to do that is to get a feed reader like liferea, and follow popular linux sites like omgubuntu or sites like /. (slashdot) for news related to linux security. Don't run software from people you don't trust (that means, be careful with shady ppa's, use software that's in the standard repos where possible, and don't run strange plugins on websites, even if it is kinda funny when they fail to infect your linux system =P)\nHope that answers your question =)\nedit: viruses are the same on every system in the sense that they all try to use a vulnerability or a user's ignorance to propagate themselves or access something they should not. It's no different on linux, but linux is more secure, way more secure. The antivirus software you saw is actually mainly there to protect windows users; for example if a friend sends you an infected file, you might pass it on to a windows user without being affected yourself.\n\nA: No, you do not need an Antivirus (AV) on Ubuntu to keep it secure.\nYou need to employ other \"good hygiene\" precautions, but contrary to some of the misleading answers and comments posted here, Anti-virus is not among them.\nFor starters, there seems to be a confusion in some of the top-rated answers here between two issues:\n\n*\n\n*Existence of viruses for Linux and\n\n*Ability to actually infect a system.\n\nThese two are not the same.  There definitely are 'viruses' that can run on Linux, but in order to make them run, a malicious user needs to get someone with local privilege to actively install them.  This requires the owner of the system to trust the malicious user, download the software, and use sudo with a password to install it, (or run it as a regular user to cause some regular-user level damage).  Not a trivial set of barriers to overcome.\nUnlike on some other systems, a regular user who keeps their Ubuntu system up-to-date on security fixes (very easy to do), cannot normally install something by accident (e.g. by opening an attachment, or clicking on something).  The exception is unknown zero-day vulnerabilities, but for those AV will be totally ineffective anyway.  An Ubuntu user doesn't work with admin privileges by default, and remote root logins are disabled.\nIn addition, Ubuntu comes with:\n\n*\n\n*Random address loading (which foils most drop-to-shell attempts)\n\n*Application restrictions/barriers via apparmor so an application like firefox can only access a very restricted subset of files and actions for example (see /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.firefox)\n\n*Built-in firewall (iptables) which can be set-up to be very restrictive\n\nSo to be secure, you need to adhere to basic rules of safety such as:\n\n*\n\n*Keep your software up to date\n\n*Only run software downloaded from official repositories (or software you wrote yourself, or can audit the source code of)\n\n*Only use your standard package-manager for installs. In particular do not install proprietary binary stuff from random sources which you can't audit by looking at the source code using apt-get source).\n\n*Have a home firewall & do not run unnecessary services\n\n*Regularly run some log scanning to detect unusual activity -- I recommend logcheck\n\n*Add a local iptables based firewall for another defense perimeter layer\n\n*Keep your passwords long and secure (a good password manager is recommended). Use two-factor authentication wherever possible.\n\n*Use encrypted  sessions (use ssh and scp, and not ftp or telnet)\n\n*Use containers (e.g. docker or systemd-nspawn images) - by running software in isolation from the rest of the system, even the most buggy/vulnerable software, won't be able to cause damage outside its container. Container-technology means basically game-over for compromised software.\n\nIf you follow these sensible guidelines, you'd be way safer than you would be by installing a non-opensource 'AntiVirus' (how can you trust such software?) and falling into a false, and highly deluded, sense of security.\nOf course, if a malicious user asks you to download badstuff.deb from somewhere and install it by opening a terminal window and typing:\nsudo dpkg -i badstuff.deb\n\nand you oblige, all bets are off, and you have only yourself to blame for being infected.  An AntiVirus is pretty unlikely to save you in this case. Unless this particular badstuff.deb is among the finite set of blacklisted signatures.\nAs others have mentioned clamav \"for Linux\" is designed as a scanning server to other (non-Linux) systems.\nSome of the answers and comments here make the following non-sequitur claim: \"since user-level damage can be very harmful (e.g. removing $HOME and everything under it), sudo access is irrelevant. You need AV anyway.\"\nThis is a red-herring logical fallacy. You can willfully (or accidentally) remove $HOME anyway, with or without a virus.  The critical question, is again: do you run random code from untrusted sources or not.  If you do, AV (or any other precaution) won't save you from yourself willingly damaging your system.\nOn Ubuntu, the whole system and software repository ecosystem is designed to prevent running random code from random sources, thus installing an AV to \"protect Ubuntu from viruses\" is a waste of time and resources.\nSome answers here suggest installing a commercial, non-open source, AV software on Linux. Don't do this. AV software runs with elevated privileges, often changes system-call semantics (e.g. change open() to scan a downloaded file and possibly fail), and consumes very significant (memory, CPU, disk, network) resources. Such software cannot be audited so it is impossible to trust. Installing such software on your otherwise pretty secure Linux system, would dramatically increase the surface of attack of your system and make it far less secure.\nReferences:\n\n*\n\n*Are signature based antivirus or anti-malware effective?\n\n*What automated intrusion notification/detection setup is good for home desktop use?\n\n*Is it easier to write viruses for Windows compared to OS-X and Linux (Quora)\n\n*Google: Symantec antivirus flaws are \"as bad as it gets\"\n\n*Setting up iptables - Ask Ubuntu question\n\n*systemd-nspawn on Arch wiki\n\nA: I am not worried about my Ubuntu gets infected with virus because I know the chances are very slim , but I have avast installed in case my windows gets infected I can clean it from Ubuntu using avast ( I have dual boot, XP and Ubuntu).\n\nA: There are viruses for most all platforms (the first worm was for DEC VAX) , they are just more common on Windows.  Different platforms are more secure than others, but a virus can typically gain user level security, which is often good enough, on most platforms.  You can actually run Windows without a virus scanner if you keep it patched and are really careful.\nDifferences from Windows to Linux for viruses: On Linux it is harder for the virus to get root (or system) level access.  But it could probably still access your address book or saved passwords in Firefox (user level access).\nStrategy: If you are really careful and know what you are doing you can get away without a scanner.  A good strategy is to have your scanner just scan downloads or if you are bringing a file from another computer on a USB drive or floppy disk (assuming you have one).  If you want you can have it do regular full system scans too.  It is all about how paranoid you are, and how likely you are to get a virus.\nFor your laptop I would suggest only having the scanner scan downloads and when you are brining files from another computer.  Having it do full system scans can be a battery drain.  \nA very important element of a virus scanner is having it updated with new signatures, so pick the package that has the best signature updates, and that works best for how you want to use it.\n\nA: Basic ecology, man. Monocultures suffer from parasite plagues more than endemites. Popularity of Windows and the fact that there is just a handful of different configurations make them an easy and profitable target. How many boxes are out there with that precise version of the kernel that you are running? Of the software that you are running? \nAlso, in Ubuntu, you have security updates on an almost daily basis, rather than waiting for the next service pack.\nFurthermore, 99% of the software you are running comes from trusted sources.\nThat said, AV might still be useful, for example to check Windows files, including your WINE programs. Also, in fact, there are some Linux viruses out there; but they have a very hard time spreading and so are not, in general, a major concern. Read more here.\nAnd, of course, Linux does not protect you from bugs in Javascript or web browsers.\nYou can see a brief description of Linux antivirus programs here.\n\nA: Its needed if you wanna scan your NTFS partitions..I use opensource antivirus clamav to scan my NTFS drives.It is awesome,but some times the result may be false positive,so be sure before you delete a file..Cheers....!\n\nA: Security is a matter of how you use your computer. Thinking before acting, most of the times is the best Antivirus/Malware protection mechanism.\nFor users coming from Windows having an Antivirus seems to be essential but they are tricked into a false sense of security. Before clicking on a mysterious link just because Bob told you that the flash video there is awesome and you just have to check it out is such a potential risk.\nAlways think twice before visiting a certain site or opening a certain file. If it stinks like fish it probably is fish.\nNow to answer your question. No, as long as you don't plan to have Windows machines on your network or to interact with them in any way by transferring files for example then no you won't need any Antivirus. If there are Windows machines in your network or you plan to transfer files from/to such a Windows machine then to protect the Windows machine you should use one of the already mentioned Antivirus packages.\nThe security team is doing a great job at fixing vulnerabilities but this task is most of the times to be performed as a reaction to a certain vulnerability, just keep that in mind.\n\nA: A virus is computer program that writes itself to another program, which would then write itself to other programs and so on. In Ubuntu, only root is allowed to write to executables. This means that a virus would have to gain root access before it could infect your system. So even if the virus did reach your computer, it would be very difficult for it to actually infect it. It is not impossible, but difficult. \nBut a virus is not a virus unless it is able to actually spread. It is very uncommon for users to copy software directly between themselves. Instead, you'd download the software from the distributor, who has compiled the code from source and then signed it. First of all, this means that a virus would be incapable of spreading because it isn't being copied. But it also means that Ubuntu would actually refuse to install infected software quite simply because the certificate would no longer be valid. When you install Ubuntu from a CD, you can test the CD for errors. It's the same principle. If the software has been changed, then it is no longer valid. Whether that's because of tampering or a bad download, is actually quite irrelevant. \nIn other words, there are many reasons why viruses will have an insanely small chance of surviving in Ubuntu. So much that it can be considered almost impossible. \nHowever, viruses are only one kind of malicious software. The anti-virus manufacturers like to use that expression for everything because of the fear factor. It is completely possible to make other kinds of malware, like trojans. Actually, this is a little bit easier on Ubuntu than other operating systems, using PPAs for instance, but also easier to detect. So in other words, even if Ubuntu is mostly immune to any kind of virus, it is not safe to assume that it is safe to run just any software. \n\nA: Linux itself has some pretty neat security measures already, and the nature of linux there isnt much malware out there to begin with , so AV is not essential.\nThe reasoning behind that can get complicated , you may want to research it\n\nA: You ask if you need antivirus software on you desktop. My answer is not about technical issues, it is about legal ones. Where I live, banks require you to have antivirus software installed on the computer which you use for online banking. If you have antivirus (and some other measures), there's a good chance that you get your money back. It depends on many things, and there is no guarantee, but they actually do this. From their own logs they can see many things and they see patterns that show that the account really is hacked. \nIf you don't have antivirus, and your account gets hacked, they can blame you and they might refuse to refund your money. Then you can go to court and prove them wrong, but are you willing to take that risk?\n\nA: All software platforms need virus protection. However the majority of viruses are written for Windows and will not affect Linux. However, there is till the potential of cross-platform type viruses (Flash, Java PDF, etc) that can still do some damage on any system. Also, Linux can be a \"carrier\" and still spread viruses by e-mail or flash memories without you knowing about it because it had no effect on you. Therefore, I recommend installing Clam (Gnome) or Klam (KDE). This does not run in the background and needs to be updated and run manually about every week or so.\n\nA: The problem with scanning for viruses on Linux vs on Windows is that it is more trouble than it is worth. Scanning manually takes more diligence and commitment than most people have. Setting it up to scan in the background is tricky at best and impossible for most users.\nSo you can do it, if you have the time and patience, but for me it is wasted effort. I don't use Windows and people who do, deserve what they get, IMO. When you choose Windows, it comes as part of the package deal. When you choose Linux, you get out of all of that nonsense. The security is built in and there are few enough viruses for Linux that you can stop worrying about it.\n\nA: I am not running anti-virus on any of my computers that has linux installed. I'm not gonna say that you don't have to, but I chose not to.\nTo run a file on linux, you need to change the permissions for the file which requires super user priveliges. In addition, Microsofts windows are a greater market for virus-writers. You do not make a product that will be useable for a tiny amount of the market. The same rule applies to virus-writers. They will write harmful code to the platform where there are most users. \nAnother factor is in fact your own browsing. If you're visiting doubtful pages this increases your risk of getting harmful code on your computer.\nThe recent java-hole however, which resulted in malicious code could get the same priviliges as the java applet you were running could be fatal.\nThis could in theory download a file to your computer and give it privileges to run as an executable.\nA lot of security holes in linux is actually security holes in the applications you install.\nThis post does not imply that you shold not install anti virus. Trust your guts! :)\n\nA: Does Ubuntu need anti virus.  Let me share our recent experience, we are coming to the end of of redeveloping or site on a new Linux server, running Ubuntu, ROR & Mongo. The server is to deploy our multiple directories which will accept Video/Audio and Text data. The server is still in dev mode and NOT public facing. \nBut we have had 2 instances of malware being installed, for spam distribution, this was picked up by the ISP as unusual traffic for a server in Dev mode. developing.  This server does not have any inbound traffic apart from the developers (who) naturally are denying they are the source. But who else can it be as they are the only ones with access.\nMy point is, that once we have deployed to the live server users of our service will be able to create links YouTube etc, upload images, video, audio files, data and Pdf's.\nFortunately these 2 attacks have occurred during dev phase, had they occurred once the site is released it would have killed our service as the server would have had to be taken down.\nSo, whilst I understand the majority sentiment that Linux/Ubuntu is safe, I am afraid, from our experience it is not. Therefore we are having to investigate what security solutions are available.  \n", "Q: How do I listen to song samples on the iTunes website? How do I listen to song samples on the iTunes website in Ubuntu 10.04?\n\nA: In Firefox or Chrome I can confirm that clicking on the play icon does not do anything. However when you display the page source your are able to see direct links to previews in plain non-encrypted m4a format. Open these links in your browser and they will play if your audio plugin is capable to play m4a.\nI suspect some broken Java implementation responsible. Maybe there is an addon anybody knows of?\n\nA: I'm going to venture that the iTunes previews are encrypted with DRM.\n", "Q: What sort of information do I need to send a bug report to nouveau developers? I'm aware that nouveau on PPC is \"known to work\" more than \"rigorously tested\" but I'm having issues with certain OpenGL 2D programs (not 3D) where the colors are completely off.\nWhile it could be an issue w/ the application (note Alpha in title), SDL works well, if not a bit slow.\nWhat information should I capture in order to send upstream?\n\nA: The /Bugs wiki page on the Nouveau wiki at freedesktop.org says:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Attach complete, unfiltered, untrimmed kernel log from boot up to\n  the problem, and a complete X log if\n  the problem manifests with X\n  \n*Please, do not compress files you attach to bug reports, especially\n  plain text files such as logs, unless\n  the file is so huge bugzilla refuses\n  to take it. Gzipping files makes\n  taking a quick look impossible\n  \n*Make sure the mime-type of text files really is set to\n  text/plain, and not e.g.\n  application/octet-stream. This makes\n  life a little easier for people\n  reading bug reports. The point is to\n  let people read text files directly in\n  a web browser.\n\n\nA: As the nouveau developers are quite busy, I would highly recommend treating the issue as an application bug and talking with the app developers first, to rule out that it is just a bug in your app.  Or, see if you can reproduce it in a second GL app.\nIf/when you do forward to the nouveau guys, attach the following to your upstream bug report:\n(a) Screenshot / photo showing problem\n(b) /var/log/Xorg.0.log\n(c) /etc/X11/xorg.conf (if any)\n(d) Your ~/.drirc (if any)\n(e) output of sudo dmesg\nAlso, specify if this is a regression, and if it is make sure to itemize what changed on your system (hardware, software versions, particular updates, etc.) when you started noticing it.\n\nA: Try running your application in the terminal and send in the output:\nApplication > output.txt\n\nAlso you can send them the ID of your card, your xorg.conf, and sdlerr.txt (should appear in the working directory if you run the program from the terminal). I'm not sure if they should need any further information. What you could also do (NB Risky): is to try the updated drivers from the x development ppa (find it in ubuntu-tweak) and see if you get the same results on that one. That would tell you if it is fixed upstream.\n", "Q: Blank screen after Switch User or Resume About half the time when I switch users or resume from standby or resume the screen goes blank (black). If I work the cursor keys I can hear the system bell when it gets to the end of the user list. I can also successfully login, going from memory, but screen stays black. Sometimes closing and re-opening the lid will light up the screen again. Pressing the special Function key to enable/disable external monitor connection has no effect [Fn]-[F5],[Fn]-[F6]. If none of the previous work I need to put the computer into hibernation or full power off to restore screen function.\nIf I watch closely when switching users I think I can see the screen initially start to light up and then quickly fade to black.\nThe computer is an Acer Aspire 3500, model ZL6, running Ubuntu 10.10 installed 2 days ago. No proprietary drivers are in use. I'll provide a list of hardware details as soon as I can figure out how to generate that (didn't there used to be an entry for hardware details under the System menu?).\nPossibly related questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*No resume after Hibernate or Standby\n\n*When I resume from suspension - the screen is blank\n\n*Switch user fails to complete successfully\nFor what it's worth, blank after resume also used to happen occasionally when the laptop was running XP-Home, but nowhere near as often, perhaps 6 or 8 times a year.\nUPDATE: I found System > Administration > System Testing and ran the Monitor test. It went very very dark, but the window elements could be discerned, and the whole screen flashed (from very very dark to black). On the third repeat of that same test the screen went to full blaupck and stayed there. Moving the mouse, via touchpad, or touch keys did not wake it up again. I had to close the lid and put the computer into hibernate, and press the power button to restore it.\nUPDATE2: output of lshw: http://pastebin.com/q7n8676r, lspci: http://pastebin.com/6ujzVK4r\nUPDATE3: sometimes I can restore the screen by flipping to console 1 with ctrl-alt-F1 and then back to graphical with ctrl-alt-F7.\n\nA: This reminds me of a fixed Lucid bug (LP #546578) when x-server gamma was not restored properly from resuming gnome-screensaver. The solution there was to disable gnome-screensaver until the bug was fixed, which is probably not a good idea on your laptop. The underlying bug in X-Server may not yet have been fixed - I haven't followed that. You could check if it's related to this by typing\nxgamma -gamma 1.0\n\nin a terminal to see if the display gets bright again.\n", "Q: Is there a way to restore/format an iPod under Linux? I have an iPod Classic, and it's full of duplicates and it's a complete mess and would like to start anew, and I was curious if there was a way to restore an iPod like you could under Windows/Mac?\n\nA: While Banshee and amaroK offer the possibilty to load songs onto the iPod there is, as far as I know, no option to restore or format these things.\nHowever: The iPod Touch has a restore function in the settings menu and I think my iPod classic had one of those too. I can't check anymore though, since it's been broken for some time.\nIf it's really just about getting rid of the duplicate songs you could just delete those with any of the mentioned linux programs.\n\nA: It seems this was answered in this Ubuntu forum thread.\nI'm going try it myself.\n\nA: Try using Banshee media player, it might be able to do what you are looking for. Optionally you could install itunes using playonlinux (it's in the software center).\n\nA: While I do not believe there is an option to format or F-Disk your iPod so to speak you can delete all the songs etc off of it using Banshee or Rhythmbox. Also, your iPod should have a Reset option in it's settings menu but I'm not so sure as to that or not. But you should be able to erase all the song data off of it using Banshee :)\n\nA: Here is what I did to restore my iPod under linux:\nFirst, install Windows7 32bit under virtualbox and install iTunes and launch it. Then, put your iPod on recovery mode (turn off your iPod first, then press and hold the home button before plugging in the USB connected to your computer. Don't let go of the home button until you see the recovery screen.) Then, iTunes will automatically detect the device and restore it. \n", "Q: How can I import bzr branches into git? I am quite used to using git, is there an easy way to import/export from bzr into git and back bzr once I have made commits?\n\nA: Take a look at git-bzr. Note the Python rewrites at the bottom of the readme, which may integrate better. Also be advised that there are quite a few forks / derivatives of git-bzr around, but this seems to be most recently active; you may want to look around github for similar things.\n\nA: bzr-git has a \"bzr dpush\" command that you can use to push a branch into git and a \"bzr pull\" command that can be used to pull new Git commits into the bzr branch.\n\nA: I followed the instructions on Jeff Hodges' blog, which uses tailor to do the migration.  There's a list of migration tools available on the bzr website.\n\nA: You can add and use \"Bridge support in git for mercurial and bazaar\"\n\nYou can clone both mercurial and bazaar repositories now with little to no effort. The original repository will be tracked like any git repository... You can pull, and in fact push as well. Actually, you wouldn’t even notice that this remote is not a git repository. You can create and push new branches... everything.\n\n", "Q: No sound after resuming from suspend? When my system gets to suspension while the song being played, and got resumed from the suspension, I found my Rhythmbox player running but no sound coming even from the system. I had to suspend it and press the power button to get the sound back. Why is it happening so?\n\nA: Try turning off your sound device (click on volume control, click sound preferences, and then go the hardware tab, click the device, and choose off).\nThen press alt+f2, and type gksu alsa force-reload.\nThis should reload your audio.\nNow turn back on the device (Set it to the previous choice before you turned it off). \n\nA: What worked for me was asking pulseaudio to exit:\npactl exit\n\nThis causes the audio device not to be in use anymore.  Then I reloaded the module for my sound card:\nsudo rmmod snd_au8830 && sudo modprobe -v snd_au8830\n\nFinally, I restarted pulseaudio:\nstart-pulseaudio-x11\n\nI also re-uploaded the sample I was using for the bell sound.  Unfortunately, any applications which had connected to the old instance of PulseAudio had to be reinitialized somehow (for example, a Web browser with a YouTube video had to have their page reloaded).  It's a pain in the behind, but at least it's repeatable, and so far always works.  I have this in a shell script so that it's easy to do after resuming from suspend.  The biggest hurdle may be figuring out your sound card's driver.\nThis happens to be for an HP Pavillion a1257c with an Aureal Vortex PCI sound card.  This same sound card in a Precision 670 had no problems coming back from suspend, same OS, so it would seem to me to be definitely specific combinations of hardware which can cause difficulty.\n", "Q: Changing LDAP password expiry time? I am running LDAP Samba PDC on Ubuntu 10.04 server. By default the LDAP account pasword expires in 45 days. I want to change it.\nI've tried hard to find this setting in the LDAP conf files but I couldn't.\nWhat conf file needs to be edited to make this change? \n\nA: The configuration parameter you are looking for is pwdMaxAge as described here. However, you need to observe that this parameter is given in seconds. Hence you need to calculate number_of_days * 86400 if you want to specify a particular number of days.\n", "Q: Untrusted application launcher? Some time ago, Ubuntu introduced a Security \"feature\", that would only allow trusted .desktop apps to be run, on other apps it would pop up a message.\nNothing new so far, However, said Message used to have a button to make the app \"trusted\", but that button doesn't exist anymore:\n\nWhat's the point of this dialog?\n\nA: This dialog exists for your own safety, annoying as it is.\nTo remove it, right click the launcher, click properties, and then go to the permissions tab and choose execute for the users you want to allow.\nThis will allow you to use the launcher from now on.\nTo do this for a large amount of launchers in the same directory, open a terminal (in the same directory) and run:\nchmod +x *.desktop\n\n\nA: Right click the launcher and press \"Properties\", in the \"Permissions\" tab you will find a checkbox marked Execute, make sure that it is checked and Ubuntu will stop bugging you.\n\n\nA: This may also appear if any of the paths in your .desktop files are malformed or do not refer to existing files or directories. Check that all the path names in your .desktop file exist, and this will often fix the problem.\n", "Q: Is there software like Music Maker? I'm looking for a tool such as Magix Music Maker for Ubuntu (and free, if possible).\nI know that there is lmms, audacity, rosegarden, but I'm especially looking for a studio that includes basic sounds like drums, guitar sounds, bass (such as Magix Music Maker does).\nIn MMM I can pretty much click my song together using sound sets... which is awesome.:\n\nIs there such a tool for Ubuntu?\n\nA: If you are truly interested in music creation, I would recommend Ubuntu Studio.  It contains pretty much everything one might need for audio work in Ubuntu.  While it includes simple programs such as Linux Multimedia Studio, it also supplies the user with JACK, usually necessary for connecting audio and running at lower latencies.  \nOther key programs include Rosegarden, a MIDI composer, Ardour, Linux's main Digital Audio Workstation, Hydrogen for more composition and beats, etc.  \nThere are also a multitude of synths, most formidably (in my opinion): ZynAddSubFx and Fluidsynth.\nIf you're feeling especially bold and do not mind paying, energyXT is supposed to be quite simple and great for all of the above.  However, certainly for a beginner, I would try the free, opensource programs Ubuntu offers first.\nHere are a few much more general guides to linux and audio production:\nLinux Musicians\nLinux Audio\nHere is the main forum where ubuntu audio production questions and answers can be found:\nUbuntu Studio Forum.\n\nA: If you mean like a piano roll editor and really accurate MIDI, LMMS should do the trick. It is in the Ubuntu repositories, but I would recommend using the version in this PPA.\nhttps://launchpad.net/~tobydox/+archive/lmms\nAlso, install the appropriate sound font, and make your midi channels use it. This is also in the repositories, the package is: fluid-soundfont-gm. The soundfont is located in /usr/share/sounds/sf2 when installed.\n", "Q: Will there be a Vala template for quickly? Are there plans to develop a Vala template for Quickly? Would be interesting because I think, Vala will be the next gen programming language for Gnome. \n\nA: Yes, a quickly Vala template is indeed starting to take shape.\n", "Q: Windows 7 doesn't boot after Ubuntu install I had windows 7 installed on my pc, then I installed Ubuntu 10.10/\nDuring the installation process I have chosen to manually set my partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*I set a 10GB drive for ubuntu root\n\n*1GB drive for swap\n\n*and for boot drive I've chosen the one used by windows 7 \n\n\nNow I can boot ubuntu, I have the windows 7 option in the boot list, but when I choose Windows 7, it shows me a black screen for a second and returns back to boot screen.\n                 Boot Info Script 0.55    dated February 15th, 2010                    \n\n============================= Boot Info Summary: ==============================\n\n => Windows is installed in the MBR of /dev/sda\n\nsda1: _________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ntfs\n    Boot sector type:  Grub 2\n    Boot sector info:  Grub 2 is installed in the boot sector of sda1 and \n                       looks at sector 304908237 of the same hard drive for \n                       core.img, but core.img can not be found at this \n                       location.

I'm not much into Windows anymore, but from what I know there are tools on the Windows CD that allow restoration of bootsectors. You need to boot from the Windows CD and start the repair mode. On the command line, you can try\nbootrec.exe /fixboot\n\nto restore your Windows partition boot sector.\nThen, however, you won't be able to boot Ubuntu, because there will be no more GRUB2. GRUB2 should have been installed in the MBR of /sda which is not so in your case. This means you will either have to reinstall GRUB (using a Ubuntu live CD) there, or you may find it less time consuming to reinstall Ubuntu as a whole. The latter should not be a great thing if you only installed it recently for testing. In any case, take note that you should not install Grub2 on your Windows boot sector again.\n\nA: In order to have windows 7 back just run the windows 7 CD in repair mode.\nfollow this in order to have the console : http://pcsupport.about.com/od/toolsofthetrade/ss/windows-7-startup-repair.htm\nUnder the console you'll type :\nfixboot\n\nand\nfixmbr\n\nThose two commands will restore normaly the whole windows 7 boot process. if not follow the procedure of the link I gave you.\nSo now you are in single boot with windows 7 and Ubuntu is \"disabled\"\nIn order to restore Ubuntu and activate the dual boot correctly you may want ubuntu back.\nFor that follow this link at the easybcd part : http://www.linuxbsdos.com/2011/05/22/how-to-dual-boot-windows-7-and-ubuntu-11-04/2/\n\nA: you could also use GParted Live CD to fix MBR\nor hold down Shift until the grub menu showed up and choose Windows to try booting\n", "Q: Security of my built-in webcam and microphone Is there a way to control if your microphone and webcam is on? Or an easy way to securely disable it while you don't need it?\nI have a webcam and microphone built in to my notebook, which I never really need. I'm just curious if programs or websites can easily access them.\n\nA: I think the only common plugin that can access your webcam or microphone is Flash, and you can configure it to not allow that.\nAnd if you know what driver (kernel module) your webcam uses, you can blacklist that module.\nBut maybe a more realistic option is to use a browser plugin like NoScript, that allows you to disable plugins like flash for all sites except those you approve of.\n", "Q: Prevent Flash from using webcam and microphone? How do you configure Flash to not allow access to webcam and mic?\nI'm currently primarily interested in this for Chrome, but if the solution is different for other browsers, please list it as well.\n\nA: Simply open the Macromedia settings manager and select \"Always Deny\" in the \"Global Privacy Settings panel\".\nOn a side note: this page is accessible from all browsers and those settings will be used by all browsers.\n\nA: (An expansion on JanC's answer which wouldn't fit in a comment.)\nRight-click on a Flash applet and select \"Settings...\" to control just that site:\n\nThe \"Global Settings...\" option controls all sites.  It appears disabling it globally still allows you to enable per-site, as that's what I did for the above screenshot.\n\nA: There is an option in the right-click menu if you click on any flash applet that will bring you to a special applet on Adobe's site where you can configure that.\nIt also seems like the only options are \"always deny\" or \"always ask\"...\n", "Q: Windows 7 sees all Ubuntu partitions as primary I got a new laptop with Windows 7. I resized the windows partition and installed Ubuntu 10.10 in the free space using manual partition, with several partitions for /boot, /, /home, swap, and another to be formated as NTFS to share files with the Windows 7 boot.\nAll worked perfectly on the Ubuntu side, but the disk management of Windows 7 sees all partitions as Primary and doesn't let me format the one I set aside for NTFS.  I always thought that there could only be 4 primary partitions, so seeing 9 primary partions was unexpected.  With all my previous computers this worked fine and I could use both systems to access the common data partition.\nWindows 7 Disk Management:\n\nHow can I format this partition to NTFS?\n\nEdit:  This is the output of fdisk -l  \nDisco /dev/sda: 320.1 GB, 320072933376 bytes\n255 cabezas, 63 sectores/pista, 38913 cilindros\nUnidades = cilindros de 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes\nTamaño de sector (lógico / físico): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nTamaño E/S (mínimo/óptimo): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nIdentificador de disco: 0x949ef5d2\n\nDispositivo Inicio    Comienzo      Fin      Bloques  Id  Sistema\n/dev/sda1               1           5       40131   de  Utilidad Dell\n/dev/sda2   *           6        1918    15360000    7  HPFS/NTFS\n/dev/sda3            1918        8258    50931829+   7  HPFS/NTFS\n/dev/sda4            8259       38914   246238209    5  Extendida\n/dev/sda5            8259        8271       97280   83  Linux\n/dev/sda6           36969       38914    15624192   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n/dev/sda7            8271       14350    48827392   83  Linux\n/dev/sda8           14350       16781    19529728   83  Linux\n/dev/sda9           33321       36969    29296640   83  Linux\n/dev/sda10          16781       33320   132852736   83  Linux\n\nLas entradas de la tabla de particiones no están en el orden del disco\n\nThe partition 10 that I wanted to be NTFS appeared as of Linux type, even when in the installer i didn't select that.  I tried changing that to NTFS with the Disk Utility and it stalled changing it.  Installed GParted but every time I run it, it crashes with \nglibmm-ERROR **: \nunhandled exception (type std::exception) in signal handler:\nwhat: basic_string::_S_create\n\nFinally changed the type with fdisk to 0x07.  The output of fdisk changed only in this line\n/dev/sda10          16781       33320   132852736    7  HPFS/NTFS\n\nNow Windows 7 shows this partition and only this partition as being inside an extended partition.   Is there a way to validate my partition table as correct?\n\nA: You can format the NTFS partition in Linux, if this will work on the windows side i don't know. But this command should be able to format the disk correctly:\nsudo mkntfs -L \"LABEL\" /dev/NTFS-DISK\n\nWhere NTFS-DISK should be replaced by the right partiotion and LABEL replaced by a filsystem label of your choosing, you have to have the ntfsprogs package installed. Afaik you should then be able to (if you are a superuser/administrator) assign the partition a drive letter in Windows after formatting it.\n\nA: To work around this Windows bug I always use the graphical partition editor gparted   (not installed per default, but available on the live CD).\nAs always when editing partitions: Don't forget to make backups first!\n\nA: I've always worked around this problem: Install Windows first, or install it on a separate hard drive. Simply install Ubuntu afterwards, or ensure the disk containing your Ubuntu install has the highest boot precedence in your BIOS, and rerun GRUB update-grub.\n", "Q: What will the role of the Desktop folder be in Unity? Ubuntu has traditionally had some default folders. Most of them (e.g. Music, Videos) were there because they were intended to house a specific type of file. Desktop, however, was there because it was special in that its contents would be shown on the user's desktop.\nThis doesn't seem to be the case anymore, since Unity's desktop only shows the wallpaper. How is this going to be handled? Will the desktop folder be assigned a different purpose? Will it just be removed from default installs? Will its contents still have a special place? Also, can we expect Unity's desktop to show anything else besides the wallpaper in the future?\n\nA: The desktop folder is unused by Unity, other than acting like a normal folder.  It is still used by other desktops environments such as GNOME/Ubuntu.\n\nA: Desktop unity in 11.04 (natty) will have the standard nautilus based desktop activated again, so you'll be able to put icons and launchers on the desktop for 11.04.\nFor 11.10 we are completely rethinking how files are managed and accessed so it is likely that this question will become moot in a years time.\n", "Q: GNUPLOT remove overlapping between xtick labels In GnuPlot, i am setting xtics to something like this:\n\nset xtics\n  (\"AIM\" 0.00000, \"gtalk\" 2.00000, \"rtp-multicast-filetransfer\" 4.00000,\n  \"sipc_music\" 6.00000, \"skype1\" 8.00000, \"skype2\" 10.00000,\n  \"voip-extension\" 12.00000, \"voip-extension2downata\" 14.00000,\n  \"ymessenger\" 16.00000)\n\nThe problem is, that these labels overlap with each other in the plot, so how can i remove/overcome this overlapping?\nCan I increase the length between xticks or write some kind of legend showing:\nrmf : rtp-multicast-filetransfer ?\n\nA: This might not be the solution you want, but you can rotate labels with:\nset xtics rotate by -45\nThis would rotate tick labels at the x-axis by -45°.\n", "Q: Which way is the best to manage a workstation from windows server 2008? I mean, are there any tools to manage mixed networks with Windows and Ubuntu workstations from single Windows Server 2008? Some like GPO or Windows Managment Console.\n\nA: you can check out Landscape by Canonical (the company that backs ubuntu)\nhttp://www.canonical.com/enterprise-services/ubuntu-advantage/landscape\nbut there are only paid licencing models.\n\nA: Likewise, well-known for their free Likewise Open product which authenticates Linux against Active Directory, also has a commercial Likewise Enterprise product, which does what you describe.\nLikewise Enterprise supports a bunch of policies and integrates fully with Group Policy Management Console and Group Policy Object Editor, making the Linux workstation into a full AD client. Seems like a great tool to manage Linux from Windows. It's not free though, and I've not used it myself.\n\nA: As Martijn Heemels mentioned in his answer, there's Likewise Enterprise, which I've reviewed, and which worked pretty much as advertised--you can control the stuff in gconf through group policy. \nThere's also Centrify, which I haven't tested, but which is supposed to work more or less like Likewise. I noticed that Centrify's free version, which allows for AD authentication (Likewise Open does the same) is now available in Canonical's partner repo, so that's two options for AD auth with an up-sell to GP admin, both of which explicitly support Ubuntu.\nIf you end up deploying one of these, I'd love to hear how you fare.\n", "Q: Get root access for copying files to /usr/share/...? To be short, I want to copy a folder to a location /usr/share/screenlets/.... in Ubuntu 10.04 system. I tried by logging in as root from terminal giving su. \nI even changed my user account type to ADMINISTRATOR; Yet, no use. PASTE option in the context menu's list in the folder /usr/share/... is INACTIVE.\nHow can I copy those files?\n\nA: You need root access. You can launch nautilus with root access with gksu nautilus or can issue commands with sudo before the command to move or copy. I would not play around with user groups if I were you, as this can mess things up and spoil built in security features.\n\nA: You can also install Ubuntu tweak and then go to manage scripts . There you will find a script called Browse as root . It will ad a new entry to the context menu wich will alow you browse the selected folder as root. \nYou just right click from nautilus ... browse as root ... enter password and you can do whatever you want.\n\nA: First, however tempted you might ever get, never \"log in with root\". It's far too easy to break things beyond repair. Anyway, this is disabled by default so you'd have to do a whole lot more to get to that point.\n/usr/ is owned by the root account so to write files in there you need to write them as root. Two methods (there are undoubtedly more but here are the two main ways for most users):\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Alt+F2 to get a run dialogue and in that type gksu nautilus. This will open up a file browser window running as root. Copy your files across but be careful, you can nuke the system like this.\n\n*A much more direct method is just loading up a terminal and writing:\nsudo cp -R /path/to/files/you/want/copied/ /copy/to/this/path/\n\n(the -R is just there to recursively copy directories)\nIf you ever want to fire off multiple commands as root without prepending them all with sudo you can run sudo -i or sudo su and you'll get a root terminal. But again, be careful what you do.\n\nA: There is  a simple way to do it :\npress Alt+F2 to open the 'Run Application' box \ntype gksudo nautilus in to the text box and press 'Enter'. This will prompt a password dialog box. Enter your sudo password and it will open nautilus with root privilege. From there you can move/copy files without any permission error.\nNote: Just make sure that you don't delete/replace any system files.\nsee a similar post here: \n\nA: Right click anywhere on a blank desktop. Click create launcher.\nType = application\nName = whatever you want it to be\nCommand = /usr/bin/gksu nautilus\nComments = whatever you want it to be\n\nDouble click the new launcher on your desktop. Note that anything you want to copy and paste must be done in this browser, you cannot simply drag onto your user desktop space, so if you need to open to browsers just double click the new launcher twice. Welcome to drag and drop root.\nRemember that you can replace nautilus with whatever your favorite browser is, you might try xfe, so after dl of xfe command would be /usr/bin/gksu xfe. If you would like to make an OpenAs that you can manually type any program you want to run as root, Command = /usr/bin/gksu.\n", "Q: How come you don't need sudo privileges to update the packages list in the 10.10 Update Manager? I have noticed that when I press the \"Check\" button from the Update Manager in Maverick, it starts directly downloading the information on packages without asking me my password (sudo verification) like it used to be in 10.04 and before.\nI'm wondering why so because in the Terminal, you've still got to be sudo to execute an \"apt-get update\".\n\nA: This answer is a good explanation as to the how this change was made (more hands-on detail is available here).\nThere's also a why component to the question.  For package installation there are a number of security concerns involved in allowing arbitrary users to install software - for an obvious example, exploits which require a particular piece of software to be installed become more widely applicable.  There aren't the same sort of security concerns with updating the package cache.  It should be always safe to do (or, at least no less safe than other network access which an unpriviledged user is able to do), so it doesn't make sense to restrict it to a privileged user.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 10.10, Update Manager switched from the Synaptic backend to the Aptdaemon backend by default. Aptdaemon allows more fine-grained privilege management with PolicyKit, and the default PolicyKit configuration for regular users allows them to check for updates without needing elevated privileges.\n", "Q: upgrade manager just closes I keep on trying to upgrade this PC, but after getting the upgrade tool the distribution window closes and does not remember that I have tried upgrading. Is their any solution to this problem? I am upgrading form 10.04 to 10.10. Thank you.\n\nA: I would suggest you report a bug by pressing Alt+F2 and then entering ubuntu-bug update-manager. This will allow the developers to help improve Ubuntu. (The same procedure is used for any application.)\n\nA: I will commit a small heresy and say, upgrades don't always work. If you have lots of outside sources from PPAs and have applications on your system that are not standard releases, perhaps obtained by PPA or compiled yourself, it causes problems with the upgrade. Then you may have no alternative but to identify those packages and roll back to the standard Ubuntu versions. Then try again. In the worst case, you may need to do a fresh installation.\nSee: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/29584/safely-remove-ppas-and-roll-back-to-stable-versions-in-ubuntu/\nFresh installations are nothing to be feared. You get a clean slate. I always do them and it is a piece of cake. \nMy method is to first have a separate home partition. If you don't have this then you have to go through the added step of copying the files from your home folder to another device, such as a usb stick (make sure that you get the hidden files too, Ctrl+H). My home partition is at least five years old and I have re-used it at least 20 times and never backed up or saved anything, without any data loss. So much for the advantage of re-using a separate home...\nThe next step is to save your list of installed applications. You can use the commandline, but I prefer Synaptic. You open Synaptic and go to File, Save Markings (tick the box for full state). Give it a name and put it in a safe place, such as on your usb stick. Re-install. Re-boot. If necessary re-copy files back to home. Open Synaptic. Go to File, Read Markings and navigate to the text file. Apply and do something else till it is done.\nTry the roll back idea first, if fresh installations scare you (it's almost Hallowe'en afterall). Booh! :)\n", "Q: How do I rip CDs with Sound Juicer over X11 forwarding? I am trying to rip a CD with Sound Juicer over X11 forwarding (CD is in the desktop across the room, I'm SSHing in from my laptop), but Sound Juicer cannot find my CD drive.  It works correctly when I am logged in directly to the machine in a GNOME session.  My user is in the cdrom group.\nI suspect that some combination of udisks, PolicyKit, and ConsoleKit is to blame — that it is configured to allow users with active console sessions to enumerate and/or access drives, but not other users.\nHow can I configure my system to allow me to access this?  I cannot seem to locate any PolicyKit or ConsoleKit configuration programs like I seem to remember Fedora having when they rolled out PolicyKit?\nThe other option I see, which I find to be unlikely, is that Sound Juicer requires some GNOME session services to be running in order to locate the drive.\nUpdate: Based on the accepted answer, it does require GNOME session services, namely a D-Bus session bus by which it can run gvfs.  If sound-juicer fails, running dbus-launch sound-juicer works.  Alternatively, dbus-launch can be hooked in to your login scripts to run at SSH login.\n\nA: According to the sound juicer source it requires both access to gconf and gvfs. It looks like it uses gvfs to see what cdrom drives you have available. Failure to access them or having gvfs policies which stop you seeing them will be a real problem.\nI'd report this problem to the sound juicer bugs:\nhttps://bugzilla.gnome.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=sound-juicer\n", "Q: What protocol does Empathy's \"People Nearby\" use, and what other chat programs use it?

You are comparing a distribution upgrade with a normal upgrade of packages.\nWithin a release there is some consistency. The underlying structure will always be Karmic. The kernel version may change from 2.6.32.x to 2.6.31.y, but not likely change to to say 2.6.32, unless you choose to upgrade the kernel yourself. The reason is that some people want minimal change. Those who want more change usually opt for a distribution upgrade.\nBTW, do you realise that Karmic support is only for six more months? If you want to upgrade then it would be a good time to upgrade to Lucid which is LTS and has 2 1/2 more years of support, plus you get a newer kernel. :)\n\nA: The latest kernel in Maverick (10.10) is 2.6.35-22 and for Karmic (9.10) is 2.6.31-22.\nKernels work the same as everything else in Ubuntu - you only get version updates on new releases (e.g. 10.04, 10.10, etc), with the exception of security updates.\n", "Q: I have two System informations display Hey!

You'll need to do this from another installation (or perhaps Live -- otherwise the disk won't be available for VirtualBox to control) and you just add the disk (you can add real disks) as the primary drive.\nAnyway, once you're in, VirtualBox will let you take a screenshot.\nOtherwise you could use a video-out (s-video or composite, whatever, if anything, your computer supports) and another computer with a video capture card. You can use VGA if you have a VGA capture card but most people don't. Then just capture all the video output from the first computer on the second. Bit of a task if you ask me but it's worth it for serious video recording.\n\nA: My first answer gives you some options for low-level video/image capture. \nBut I've noticed you started another thread on a particular issue you get following grub.

How would I go about doing this?\n\nA: There is a difference between an ad-hoc and a hotspot. Android phones usually don't support ad-hoc connections and some other phones also don't support ad-hoc well.\nSo the best option is to create a hotspot, which is just like turning your computer in to a virtual router, and in ubuntu 11.10 you can create hotspot with a click, provided your driver supports master mode.\n  If it does, then go to \"system settings\" -> \"network\" -> \"wireless\"\nyou will find there an option for creating hotspots -> \"use as hotspot\", click on it and you are done.\n\nA: some phones wont connect to ad-hoc networks, get an old router such as an old unused dsl modem with wifi, then configure it so DHCP is turned off. plug it into an extra ethernet port on your computer and edit the connection settings to be  \"Shared to other computers\" instead of \"Automatic DHCP\" in the IPv4 settings, set IPv6 to off.\nyou might also be able to have your computer connect over wifi instead of an ethernet cable using the same configuration for the connection.\nNow your pc is a wifi hot spot\np.s. to edit your router settings you almost always need to edit your connection settings to be a manual IP address of 192.168.0.9  and then after connecting open a web browser and open web page  http://192.168.0.1         on some routers you may need change the 0's to 1's or use completely dif numbers\n\nA: The easiest way is creating an Ad-Hoc network. It's really simple (if your hardware drivers support it).\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the Network Manager applet\n\n*Click Create New Wireless Network...\n\n*Give it a name. Set the security.\n\n*Connect to it from your other devices!\n\n\nA: If you are using KDE Plasma desktop, it is quite easy: \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to \"Edit connections\" (in the network manager widget, select the\nwrench button and \"Edit connections\" button will show up)\n\n*Click \"Add\"\n\n*Select \"Wireless (shared)\"\n\n*In the appearing dialog, give your connection a name, adjust the name of the network (as it appears to other) by changing the SSID (only if desired) and if you want, select the security and set a password for your access point in the \"Wireless Security\" tab. \n\n*After that, all you have to do is simply connect  yourself to the network you have just created in the network manager widget. \n\n\nAfter that, your network is visible and other can connect to it.

On my machine booting takes more than a minute which is annoying when I see that Windows 7 boots in 20 seconds.\nHere is what I get when the machine is booting.\n\nHow can I see what happens when booting up?\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Grub by holding Left Shift on boot\n\n*Edit the top option by pressing e\n\n*Search the boot command until you see the two words \"quiet splash\".\n\n*Delete these from that line and press Control+X to boot.\n\nThis will show you what's happening behind the scenes (and what it's getting stuck on).\nThis is temporary. It will revert to the old behaviour on the next boot so it's fairly safe.\nIf you want to make it permanent, edit /etc/default/grub as root, delete \"quiet splash\" from the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT variable, save and then run sudo update-grub.\n\nA: You can also use a program called Bootchart (click to install: bootchart and pybootchartgui) to plot a diagram of everything that's happening while booting. It will point out where most time is spent and whether there is anything seriously wrong.\nThis is what a typical bootchart looks like.\n\n", "Q: Optimizing Boot-up I installed bootchart to monitor my boot-up process.\nI had some problems with my booting time (>80sec)\nBefore :\nhttp://i.stack.imgur.com/4tvky.png\nAfter some tweaking with Bum,Ubuntu-tweak and Start-up Manager i reached (>30sec)\nAfter :\nhttp://i.stack.imgur.com/F4Pyf.png\nIs it good ? or is there room for more ?\nWhat Boot-up time(range) is normal ? ( of course it depends, but on default setting on a mid/high-tech pc)\n\nA: The only thing that stands out for me in that bootchart is the (relatively) long period from ~6sec to ~11sec into the boot where the disc throughput is very low.  This suggests that ureadahead is doing a lot of (slow) seeking rather than (fast) linear reads.  Making ureadahead reprofile your boot may help here.  Deleting the .pack files in /var/lib/ureadahead will cause ureadahead to reprofile next boot.\n\nA: From what I'm seeing I think that you might be going as fast as you can. About the only thing I could think of doing would be to make a custom kernel specifically for your hardware, but I don't know how much of a speed boost that would give you. \n\nA: e4rat if you use Ext4. But prefferably with \"lite-git\" versions.\nUreadahead is nice for SSD disks. For HDD (on Ext4) you can gain more by using e4rat (but you NEED to disable ureadahead).\ne4rat will move files needed for booting and login (and whatever you start during first 120sec. - good if you always start some app at startup). And \"-lite\" variants will load only small portion of needed files to RAM and rest parallel to normal startup. That cut some seconds on slow HDDs when you need to load lots of stuff.\n(Also you have there Apache + mysql, which you can disable if you do not need it all the time, as both can be easily started from cli in no time letter)\n", "Q: Black screen when I start Google Earth? When i start google earth on ubuntu it shows a black screen. It used to work but one time it show a black screen. I tried installing it again and rebooting and everything but it didn't work.

How did you install google earth. Did you download the original package and install the libgl with \"wget http://librarian.launchpad.net/7037027/libGL.so.1 -O libGL.so.1\"? If you are using 10.04, you can install Google Earth from mediabuntu package, maybe this works. Otherwise, if you use 10.10, you can use this guide: http://www.liberiangeek.net/2010/09/install-google-earth-ubuntu-10-10-maverick-meerkat/ This works for me in 10.10 after I got crashes and black screens while using the original package. Using the original package was a mistake, because the original package never worked for me. \n\nA: I had the same problem on my 64bit Ubuntu 12.04 machine. I've tried clearing Google Earth's cache, purging Google Earth, and then reinstalling it. But that didn't fix the problem. So I went and tried something a bit more extreme. Maybe this is too extreme, but oh, well. I went and un installed all my 32 bit software, including Google Earth, and then reinstalled google-earth-stable. CAUTION: this may be drastic move, and may possibly mess up some things. Sorry if it does.

I've read the info page, but I can't find any way to scroll the list in top.  \nMaybe there is no way to scroll?... but there must, at least, be some way to filter the list, and I can't find that either. \nHow do I display line-entries which are off the page?\n\nA: The point of the \"TOP\" program is to tell you which processes are using the most resources or are at the TOP of the list.\nFor a full process list use \"ps\":\nps aux\n\nYou can filter it with \"grep\":\nps aux | grep firefox\n\n\nA: Indeed, the up and down arrow keys will scroll through top on newer versions, specifically at least on the version of top that comes with Ubuntu 16.04.2 (procps-ng version 3.3.10).\nBut if the arrow keys don't work to scroll for you, it could just be an issue with your terminal emulator.\nTake a look at the top man page:\n\nLastly,  some  of  top's screens or functions require the use of cursor motion keys like the standard arrow keys plus the Home, End, PgUp and PgDn keys.  If your terminal or emulator does not provide those keys, the following combinations  are accepted as alternatives:\n          key      equivalent-key-combinations\n          Up       alt + \\      or  alt + k\n          Down     alt + /      or  alt + j\n          Left     alt + <      or  alt + h\n          Right    alt + >      or  alt + l (lower case L)\n          PgUp     alt + Up     or  alt + ctrl + k\n          PgDn     alt + Down   or  alt + ctrl + j\n          Home     alt + Left   or  alt + ctrl + h\n          End      alt + Right  or  alt + ctrl + l\n\n\nSo if the up and down arrow keys don't work for you (make sure you hold them down, as deto said), try pressing alt + \\, alt + /, alt + k and alt + j.\n\nNote that this section of the man page does not exist on my RHEL 6.6 machine, which has procps-ng version 3.2.8 (you can see the version number with top -v), and so that version of top does not appear have any scrolling capability.\n\nA: I have only one suggestion: use htop instead.\nsudo apt-get install htop\n\n\nA: This is a bit old, but I'm finding that I can scroll top just fine in version 3.3.9 (Default on Ubuntu 14.04)\nIf you hold the down arrow, it'll look like you aren't scrolling, but just keep holding.  For each repetition, I believe there is a marker that is moving down, row by row (not visible) and when it hits the bottom the window scrolls down.\nAlso the PageUp and PageDown keys work a bit faster.\n", "Q: USB drive Login token system?

When I press the volume up/down keys on my keyboard, the volume changes too much. How can I make the step size smaller so that I have finer control?\n\nA: You can do this with CompizConfig Settings Manager. Use the command \nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\nif you haven't installed it already.\nNow open the CompizConfig Settings Manager and go to Commands in the General section. Check the Enable commands checkbox to the right. In the Commands tab, enter the following two commands separately as two commands: \namixer set Master 5%+ -q\namixer set Master 5%- -q\nAssign two keyboard shortcuts for the commands in the Key bindings tab. I use the Super+[ and Super+] combination. Now close the CompizConfig Settings Manager and this should work.\nI'm not sure if you can assign the commands to the in-built volume controllers of the computer though.\n\nA: 12.04 (and possibly 11.10)\nIf you want to control the pulseaudio volume directly rather than go the ALSA route, you can use the following script. While it should also be possible to control the volume via DBUS as detailed in this Stackoverflow answer, I however could not find a way to make this work in Ubuntu 12.04.\nAs is said in the script itself, it uses this Stackoverflow answer on how to programmatically change volume in Ubuntu and expands the idea into a script which takes the volume change as a command line argument and also shows an OSD notification. I have tried to model it as closely as possible to the default Ubuntu (12.04) behavior.\nThe script takes volume changes as either an absolute or relative number or percent value. So for instance:\n\n\n*\n\n*pavol.sh 2000 sets the volume to 2000,\n\n*pavol.sh 30% sets the volume to 30 percent,\n\n*pavol.sh +1000 increases the volume by 1000 and\n\n*pavol.sh -5% decreases the volume by 5 percent.\n\n\nIt is also quite liberally commented in the hopes that it is useful for further tweaking.\nHowTo\nUse your favorite text editor to create a file in your home folder (or anywhere else really - just remember the path) called pavol.sh and copy and paste the contents below into that file, i.e.\ngedit ~/pavol.sh\n\nRun chmod a+x ~/pavol.sh to make it executable.\nThen open Sytem Settings, go to the Keyboard settings and switch to the Shortcuts tab. There click on Custom Shortcuts and create two new keyboard shortcuts with the plus button.\nGive each one a name and as command enter something like this: /home/username/pavol.sh \"+3%\" It is important to enter the full path to the pavol.sh script (unless the script lies in a folder that is included in the PATH environment variable). Also use quote signs \"\" around the volume value or the keyboard shortcut will not work.\nAfter that click on the right side of each entry to set a key combination or multimedia key. If the desired combination or key is already assigned to another shortcut, the program will ask if you want to reassign it.\npavol.sh\n#!/bin/bash --\n\n## This script expands upon this answer on stackoverflow:\n## https://stackoverflow.com/a/10739764\n##\n\n\n\n## GLOBAL VARIABLES\n\n# restrict usable commands\nPATH=\"/bin:/usr/bin\"\n\n# this script changes the volume of the default sink (as set, for instance, via the Ubuntu sound menu);\n# use \"pactl info\" to display these settings neatly in a terminal\nDEFAULT_SINK=$(pacmd dump | grep 'set-default-sink' | cut -d ' ' -f 2)\n\n# get max. volume from the DEFAULT_SINK\nMAX_VOL=$(pacmd list-sinks | grep -A 20 \"name: <${DEFAULT_SINK}>\" | grep \"volume steps:\" | tr -d '[:space:]' | cut -d ':' -f 2)\n\n# show debug messages?\n# 0 means no debug messages;

I managed to keep it to around 2% and 3% steps by simply adjusting the output source volume levels to compensate for the master volume steps.\nSo naturally, I got a little annoyed when 16.04 upped this to 6%, and removed the master volume control, instead the volume buttons control both output sources.\nThe above fix for Ubuntu 16.04 doesn't work with the Plasma 5 interface used on KDE5, so won't work for Kubuntu 16.04 - I tried, and it doesn't work.\nSo, I did a quick check online, and the process requires manually changing a file, but it's fairly straightforward.\nEdit the file ListItemBase.qml typically found at /usr/share/plasma/plasmoids/org.kde.plasma.volume/contents/ui/ListItemBase.qml as root.\nThere's a couple of lines within functions increaseVolume and decreaseVolume that define the step by dividing the maximum volume by 15. They look like:\nvar step = slider.maximumValue / 15;\n\nThe higher the number, the smaller the steps. If this were 1, the volume is either 0% or 100%, but if this were 100, the volume would go up in steps of 1%.\nPersonally, I aimed for 2%, so I changed both of these lines to\nvar step = slider.maximumValue / 50;\n\nCredit goes to this Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/3t1xr0/how_to_change_the_volume_increment_step_size_for/\nHowever, you'll need to restart Plasma for this to take effect:\nkillall plasmashell #to stop it\nkstart plasmashell #to restart it\n\nHopefully this will help someone out, or maybe even lead to someone submitting a change in Plasma to make this config driven... both may end up being me after another update.\n\nA: Kubuntu 21.04\nIt has been made really easy, but if you don't know about this solution it is hard to find...\nJust right click on the volume icon in the system tray, select Configure Audio Volume... and set your desired Volume step on the General tab.\n\nA: For Xubuntu 22.04.1 with a Xonar DG soundcard I have found an amazingly simple solution: in the keyboard settings simply reassign the multimedia keys.\n\n*\n\n*For + Multimedia key:\namixer -D pulse sset Master 3%+ -q\n\n\n\n*For - Multimedia key:\namixer -D pulse sset Master 3%- -q\n\n", "Q: System time keeps changing I'm dual booting Ubuntu 10.04 with Windows 7, which I setup using Wubi.

How to format spare disk space to btrfs filesystem? I can't see btrfs in format dialog neither in gparted, nor in Disk Utility. Only Fat,ext2,ext3,ext4 etc.\n\nA: You might need to install the package btrfs-tools . This should enable integration with gparted and etc.\n\nA: It may be because btrfs is not really stable yet. So I guess the GUI tools do not support it yet, and you will have to use command line tools if you want to use it.\n\nA: On newer versions of Ubuntu:\nsudo apt install btrfs-progs btrfs-compsize\n\nNote: compsize is optional. It's needed to measure the compression (if enabled) of the btrfs filesystem.\nMore https://github.com/kilobyte/compsize\n", "Q: Unable to use built-in mic on Lenovo Thinkpad x300 due to regression bug from 1 year ago I'm using a LiveUSB of Ubuntu 10.10 to see if this bug I reported in Aug 2009 has been fixed. Sadly, it seems like it has not.\nThis is what I did to test: I booted with a Ubuntu 10.10 LiveUSB, I updated everything using Synaptic: including pulse and other sound related packages, everything except the kernel. After that I opened Sound Preferences,made sure sound input was not muted, moved the input volume all the way, opened Sound Record and tried to to record some sound. I could hear only static. Basically I cannot get any sound from the microphone that is on the chasis of this lenovo x300 laptop.\nMy theory is that pulse or alsa are only able to get sound input if I connect an external mic to the jack. I tried using an external mic a few months ago and it worked. But I don't want to use external mics, I want to use the mic on the laptop itself. \nAny suggestion on how to solve this problem?\n\nA: I have also faced the same problem with Ubuntu 10.10 and because of this I was unable to use skype. However, after fresh install of Ubuntu 11.04, mic is working fine. I don't know how it is working now. But it is worth to try.\n", "Q: Nvidia GeForce 8500 GT, Dell U2311H monitor, DVI-D cable issue I've have my Dell U2311H monitor working fine at 1920x1080x60hz using the DVI-D cable that came with it (18 pin, single-link).\nWhen I try and attach a longer 5m cable which supports Dual-link (24 pins) the monitor doesn't work and displays the following message:\n\n\"The current input timing is not\n  supported by the monitor display.\n  Please change your input timing to\n  1920x1080@60Hz or any other monitor\n  listed timing as per the monitor\n  specifications.\"\n\nNothing else changes except the cable, rebooting doesn't help.  As far as I understand, dual-link cables should be backwards compatible with single-link.\nWeirdly, in nvidia-settings it says DFP-0 has \"Connection link: Dual\"\nWhat could be causing this? Is there some way in xorg.conf to force it to single-link mode? There doesn't seem to be any option on the monitor other than selecting the DVI-D input.\nUpdate: Since it seems to be the cable length causing the issue (see my answer below), is there a way to save the EDID info correctly returned with the short cable and force it to be used with the long cable?\n\nA: I looked on a supplier's site and found that they declare it as having dual-link. In which case it would seem that either your cable or monitor is faulty. Try contacting Dell?\nIf you wish to accept the status quo, then your original question remains unanswered.\nPresumably you will need to defeat the EDID info being returned by the monitor. That's beyond me but I hesitantly suggest, lacking any other responses, that you generate the xorg.conf using nvidia-settings for the single-link cable and retain it for the dual-link. Failing that you could convert your dual-link cable to single-link, either by mutilation or by use of an adapter?\n\nA: I've tried again with a shorter dual-link cable and it is fine, so it seems that it was the length of the cable causing the problem.\nhttp://www.playtool.com/pages/dvitrouble/dvitrouble.html#shortercable seems to confirm that could be the culprit (maybe combined with a low-power signal generated by the graphics card.)\n", "Q: What does this startup dialog message mean \"Could not update ICEauthority file\" I restarted Ubuntu a few minutes ago, and got a warning dialog early in the bootup process (before the desktop was up)...  \nIt wasn't just a scrolling message which flitted off the screen of its own accord.\nIt was a dialog which stopped proceedings, until I acknowledged it.  \nCould not update ICEauthority file /home/me/.ICEauthority  \n\nWhat, Why, and Who dun it?  :)  \n\nA: Your .ICEauthority file probably isn't owned by your user (maybe because you ran something as root/with 'sudo' that has overwritten it). You can check this by running (in a terminal):\nls -l /home/you/.ICEauthority\nIf it says something other than\n-rw------- 1 you you ...\nyou need to make it owned by your user again:\nsudo chown you:you /home/you/.ICEauthority\nmaybe you also need to correct permissions:\nchmod 600 /home/you/.ICEauthority\n\nTo avoid such problems, don't run X applications with 'sudo' - use graphical sudo instead (addendum by Murat Gunes).\n", "Q: How to cleanly launch a GUI app via the Terminal? Some GUI apps launch cleanly via the Terminal command line, but some don't, and they cause the Terminal to wait for the app to terminate. Even then, some don't \"release\" the command line.\nThe mysterious ampersand & suffix seems to cause the terminal to put the process into the background (but I'm not sure what happens there).\nIs there a way to launch an app via the Terminal so that there is no \"hang on\" effect, just like launching something via Alt+F2?\nI'd like to have the command line available again immediately, without something still in the background and printing in the terminal.\n\nA: Suppose gedit is the program you want to run detached (aka. \"disowned\", \"disentangled\", \"decoupled\"). There are different ways depending on what you want to do exactly:\nProgram already running\nDisown:\ndisown -h is the way to go if you want to do that with an already running program (i.e. if you forgot to nohup it). You first have to stop it using Ctrl+Z. Then you can put in in the background using bg [jobId] (e.g. bg 1). You get a list of running jobs with their jobId using jobs. After that you can decouple it from terminal using disown -h %[jobId]. Example terminal session:\n$ gedit \n^Z\n[1]+  Stopped                 gedit\n$ jobs\n[1]+  Stopped                 gedit\n$ bg 1\n[1]+ gedit &\n$ disown -h %1\n$ exit\n\nProgram not started yet\nnohup\nnohup is not always present on all machines. If you know you want to decouple beforehand you would use:\nnohup gedit &\n\nMaybe you will want to redirect the shell output as well and your program a pseudo input source, so: nohup ./myprogram > foo.out 2> bar.err < /dev/null &. You would want to redirect the output to either not be annoyed by it or to use it later. The null-input can help to prevent hickups in ssh an such.\nSubshell:\nYou can achieve a similar effect by\n$ (geany >/dev/null 2>&1 &)\n\nThe brackets open a new subshell to run gedit in. The >/dev/null 2>&1 redirects the shell output to nowhere (suppressing the output). And the & at the end puts the process in the background.\nTerminal multiplexing\nAlso terminal multiplexing using screen or byobu. You basically run the program in a terminal of its own. I can really recommend byobu for other reasons too. Below is a list of boybu-shortcuts that might come in handy for your first steps:\nUseful:\n\n\n*\n\n*F2              Create a new window\n\n*F3              Move to the next window\n\n*F4              Move to the previous window\n\n*F6              Detach from the session and logout\n\n*Shift-F6        Detach from the session, but do not logout\n\n*F7              Enter scrollback/search mode\n\n*Ctrl-F5         Reconnect any SSH/GPG sockets or agents\n\n\nLess useful:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shift-F2        Split the screen horizontally\n\n*Ctrl-F2         Split the screen vertically\n\n*Shift-F3        Move focus to the next split\n\n*Shift-F4        Move focus to the previous split\n\n*Shift-F5        Collapse all splits\n\n*F5              Refresh all status notifications\n\n*F8              Rename the current window\n\n*F9              Launch the Byobu Configuration Menu\n\n*F12             GNU Screen's Escape Key\n\n*Alt-Pageup      Scroll back through this window's history\n\n*Alt-Pagedown    Scroll forward through this window's history\n\n*Ctrl-a-!        Toggle all of Byobu's keybindings on or off\n\n\nThe 'at' daemon and others\nat is a nice useful little tool to run a command at a scheduled time. It can be 'misused' to detach a command from the shell:\necho './myprogram myoption1 myoption2' | at now\n\nAlso you can look into setsid and start-stop-daemon, but the other methods should suffice.\n\nA: Open the terminal, type screen, type the command you want to run, close the terminal. The program should keep on running in the GNU Screen session.\n\nA: To start an application and detach it from the launched terminal use &!.\nfirefox &!\n\n\nA: \nThe mysterious ampersand \"&\" suffix, seems to cause the terminal to put the process into the background... (but I'm not sure what happens there).\n\nIt does, and is often what you want.  If you forget to use &, you can suspend the program with ctrl-z then place it in the background with the bg command — and continue to use that shell.\nThe process' stdin, stdout, and stderr are still connected to the terminal; you can redirect those from/to /dev/null or any other file (e.g. save an output log somewhere), as desired:\nsome-program </dev/null &>/dev/null &\n# &>file is bash for 1>file 2>&1\n\nYou can see the process in jobs, bring it back to the foreground (fg command), and send it signals (kill command).\nSome graphical programs will detach from the terminal; if that's the case, when you run the command \"normally\" you'll notice it starts the graphical program and \"exits\".\n\nHere's a short script, you can place it in ~/bin, which I named runbg:\n#!/bin/bash\n[ $# -eq 0 ] && {  # $# is number of args\n  echo \"$(basename $0): missing command\" >&2\n  exit 1\n}\nprog=\"$(which \"$1\")\"  # see below\n[ -z \"$prog\" ] && {\n  echo \"$(basename $0): unknown command: $1\" >&2\n  exit 1\n}\nshift  # remove $1, now $prog, from args\ntty -s && exec </dev/null      # if stdin is a terminal, redirect from null\ntty -s <&1 && exec >/dev/null  # if stdout is a terminal, redirect to null\ntty -s <&2 && exec 2>&1        # stderr to stdout (which might not be null)\n\"$prog\" \"$@\" &  # $@ is all args\n\nI look up the program ($prog) before redirecting so errors in locating it can be reported.  Run it as \"runbg your-command args...\"; you can still redirect stdout/err to a file if you need to save output somewhere.\nExcept for the redirections and error handling, this is equivalent to htorque's answer.\n\nA: Use nohup\n\nnohup is a program that runs a given command with hangup signals\n  ignored, so that the command can continue running in the background\n  after its parent process terminates. See the manpage\n\nFor example:\nnohup gedit something\n\n\nA: xdg-open\nHave a look at this general-purpose utility: https://linux.die.net/man/1/xdg-open\nThis will open a relative location in your file manager.\n $ xdg-open .\n\nThis will open a pdf file in a pdf reader.\n $ xdg-open foo.pdf\n\nYou can even provide web URLs\n$ xdg-open www.google.com\n\n\nA: In gedit's case, I just keep a copy open all the time. As long as you have an existing copy running, launching gedit calls from the terminal and then closing the terminal won't kill gedit.\nFor other things, what other people have said would work too. I'm a fan of nohup... But if you need a terminal you can detach but then re-attach to, you want to look at screen.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run it in a terminal and then run something that keeps pushing output. I use the Django development server but irssi or even watch uptime would be good examples.\n\n*Kill the terminal and start a new one.\n\n*Run screen -r and BOOM, you're back in.\n\n\nscreen is a lot bigger than that and you can combine it with byobu for a better terminal experience. Read around.\n\nA: This worked for me:\n$ (nohup gedit 2>/dev/null &)\n\n\nA: As a lot of people figured, nohup is the thing to consider.\nBut nohup stills remains open on the terminal and displays the program activity on the terminal which is irritating. You can just close the terminal after that to avoid so.\nI found out a very simple workaround which I use.\nnohup gedit & exit\n\nAnd that's it. It opens gedit and closes the terminal when gedit starts up. As gedit is not associated with the terminal now, it stays active.\n\nA: This works even inside a script (Like aliases, the '&' trailer is not normally allowed in scripts because they are not interactive):\nbash -i >/dev/null 2>&1 <<<'nohup gedit &'\n\n\nA: This worked for me:\n$ (some-program &) &>/dev/null\n\n# Examples:\n$ (gedit &) &>/dev/null\n$ (google-chrome &) &>/dev/null\n\n", "Q: Will there be a derivative with GNOME 3? I just wonder, will there be a separate version with GNOME desktop (GNObuntu/Gbuntu or something)? I think there are many users including me who like GNOME.

Thanks in advance.\n\nA: I had a similar problem on an old Macbook 1.1 with a broken cd-drive. I remember that all the approaches shown in the forums did not work. Try to do the following (it worked for me), the main difference is to format the flash drive as EXT: \n\n\n*\n\n*install refit\n\n*format your flash drive as EXT4. In the following commands note that you'll need to sudo.\n\n*install grub on the flash drive as follows: say the device is /dev/sdb and you mount it as /media/usbdrive, then run\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/media/usbdrive /dev/sdb\n\n\n*copy the ubuntu iso to /media/usbdrive:\nsudo cp ubuntu-10.10-desktop-i386.iso /media/usbdrive/\n\n\n*now you want to create the config file for grub inside /media/usbdrive/boot/grub/.

I was wondering if I could make an os-selecting-hardware-key or something like that. \nI'm currently using a dual boot system (ubuntu 10.10 + win7) and i want to use an usb drive to specify the OS I want to boot. So if the usb key is plugged in during the boot, it will start one operating system, if it isn't, it will boot the other one. \nI want to edit my currently installed grub to recognize only one OS, and install a second grub to the usb key, with the other OS in it. After that I just need to set up booting from the usb key in the BIOS. I may be completely wrong about it, but mainly I need some advices how to install grub(2) on the usb key.\n\nA: Open a terminal, and type sudo fdisk -l (your USB flash drive should show up in the list if it is inserted).\nNow, type sudo grub-install /dev/<insert flash drive name here> to install it on your flash drive.\nfor example:\nsudo grub-install /dev/cookies\nBe careful with these commands (don't mess up) or you could damage your system.

It will be bootable, I have not tried with a .dmg file, but I've tried with other filetypes and all2iso.\n", "Q: How does Ubuntu mount the encrypted home folder when accessing it over samba? I'm puzzled.\nAs far as I understand it, the user folder /home/user is encrypted with the users password. Connecting through smb to the computer does somehow decrypt the user's folder. How is this done? SMB doesn't transfer the password normally.\nAlso, I'm trying to achieve something similar using pam_mount, but there are some limitations. What software does ubuntu use to mount its encrypted file systems?\n\nA: If you're meaning the eCryptfs home directory encryption, then the reason it is available is because the kernel keeps the user's home directory encryption key in memory for as long as the user is logged in (as defined by a PAM \"session\"). Specifically, the software that handles this is pam_ecryptfs. See its use in /etc/pam.d/common-*.\n\nA: Actually I was wrong.

Whenever I install software from the command-line using apt-get or aptitude, I see messages like this:\nSelecting previously deselected package foobar-cil-dev.\n\nI understand \"downloading\" and \"setting up\", but what does \"selecting\" mean? And what does it mean that the package was \"previously deselected\"?\n\nA: It's a grammatical error. It should say \"unselected\". There is a subtle distinction in English here which the programmer may have been unaware of: \"deselected\" means it was selected at some previous time, but isn't now. \"Unselected\" simply means it wasn't ever selected before (or at least, not relevantly). Using \"deselected\" here is confusing, and should be corrected.\n\nA: Ubuntu comes with a default set of packages installed and the package manager track those packages. If you remove a package that is installed by default, it becomes marked as \"deselected\". This means it was installed previously, but has been removed. In fact any package that you install and then remove becomes marked as \"deselected\".\nThis is useful for example to replicate the same packages you have on another machine or after a clean install. You can generate a list of \"selected\" and \"deselected\" packages on your system using the package manager and then load this list on another machine, which will make the package manager on it to install all \"selected\" and uninstall the ones marked as \"deselected\".\nTo replicate your packages selection on another machine (or restore it if re-installing), you can run this:\ndpkg --get-selections > ~/my-packages\n\nThen move the file \"my-packages\" to the other machine, and there run:\nsudo dpkg --set-selections < my-packages && sudo apt-get dselect-upgrade\n\nWhen you run the command above, all packages that were marked as \"selected\" will be installed in a batch and all packages marked as \"deselected\" will be removed, if present. This is a very handy feature.\n", "Q: Can't use tethered WiFi I have a Dell Mini 9 Netbook with Ubuntu 10.04 Netbook Remix.  I can get on my home Wifi fine, but when I try to connect to a tethered connection (on my Palm Pre phone), it won't connect, even though it sees the connection.  Even if I turn off encryption, it still won't connect.  I can connect to the tethered connection fine from my Win7 laptop (even with encryption).\n\nA: Using a tethered network is when you connect your computer via usb or bluetooth to a device such as a phone and use a modem to connect to the network directly.\nWhat I think you are doing is not tethering but instead making an ad-hoc hot-spot with your phone which allows your computer to use the phone's network as if it were a real wifi connection.\nYou should check to see if the wifi hot-spot you're creating is on a certain band, using a certain kind of wifi such as 802.11g/n/a which (unlikely though it might be) may ot be supported or buggy in your wifi driver. I've known wifi hot-spots to not work because the network was 802.11a (old) and the newer driver hasn't been tested with those old networks.\n\nA: Does the win7 box connect without encryption? - separate thought there, but my approach would be to connect the win7 box with encryption and user aircrack to recover the key, not the word that generates the key.  I have previously had a problem connecting to cheaper access points with encryption because something goofed in the conversion from text to key...this approach solved it for me.\n\nA: I finally got it working!  I just had to go into Additional Drivers and activate the Broadcom STA wireless driver.  I am actually posting this response through the tether! :)\nEdit: Forgot to mention... I'm also on Ubuntu 10.10 now\n\nA: Is Ubuntu connecting to the Pre as a storage device, modem, or combination; or simply as a Wireless Access Point? What version of the driver are you running and what driver revisions have been installed on your machine previously? If you have it set up to connect as a mass storage device you will not have modem functionality.\nA more confusing scenario will be if Ubuntu is recognizing and accepting the Pre as it is, but the driver is not actually establishing the modem connection. For a discussion, driver links, a guide, and multiple solutions (such as removing the backports), see this link. It should assist in diagnosing the mobile hotspot software as well as any driver issues you may be having.\n", "Q: Can I use GNOME applets in Unity? Applets are small programs that you attach and start from the GNOME's toolbar. See picture:\nhttp://www.futuredesktop.com/audio-recorder/recorder-applet.ogv\nMy favourite applets are:\n\n\n*\n\n*rec-applet: Smart audio recorder applet. You can get this from Launchpad.\n\n*clipart-finder: Find and download clipart to your computer. You can get this from the Launchpad.\n1) Can I use these applets in UNITY as is?\n2) What changes I have to make to applets' code (rec-applet and clipart-finder) to make them usable in Unity?\n3) Where is the applet-specification for Unity?\n\nA: Since both shells encourage you to position launchers closer to the workspace (using the sidebar in Unity and the favourite applications well in Gnome Shell), many of the more common panel applets are close to being obsolete (since they usually just launch things with their main windows appearing close to the launchers). Some cleverness will finish the job.\nBoth shells are going for better defined, stricter methods for extensions like panel applets. Ubuntu's indicator stuff fits that territory; indicators serve a single use case and they go in one place. Unity also has a feature called Lenses. By default, you have two Lenses in Unity: Applications and Files. In the future, you will be able to install lots more to do all sorts of cool things (like browse Youtube).\nThere is some info about that on the Ubuntu wiki.\nAs the new shells evolve, additional extension points might emerge.\n\nA: I'm not sure about rec-applet, but clipart-finder looks like it could be integrated into Unity via the Lenses API.\nIn the Lenses API session at the recent UDS-N Neil Patel demoed a youtube place he hacked up over the course of two hours.  It was sweet, and looked like it would be an excellent match for clipart-finder.\n\nA: I think you can't. Unity only shows notification area and indicators. So if you port their code to use indicator-applet, they will work.\n\nA: Ok, neither Unity or GNOME Shell will have applets as we know them from GNOME 2.x. Applets are simply small GTK-applications, so if I can open the application window nearby the launcher button, then it would be a great solution.\nI hope that Unity can help us with:\n1) Find out the location of the launcher button. My applet application GTK-application will then create a window close to the button's location. The window is often small, so opening it in maximized mode or in the center of the screen would be very \"rude\".\n2) To indicate status or advancement, the GTK-application may want to modify its launcher button. Can we change the launcher's image or color, or even draw on it?\n3) Flip-flopping the window. Clicking the launcher button will show/hide the application window. This will mimic the original applet-launcher.\nI want to make rec-applet and clipart-finder rock, also in Unity and GNOME Shell.\n\nA: If there is a Gnome Panel applet that you absolutely must use and it isn't feasible to get an indicator to replace it, then this might be a workaround: \n\n\n*\n\n*Install xfce4-panel\n\n*Run \"xfce4-panel\"\n\n*install the XfApplet plugin\n\n*Add your Gnome Panel applet to the Xfce4 panel\n\n*Arrange the panel in such a way as to not bother other parts of your system, i.e in the lower-right corner. \n\n\nA: GNOME applet only runs on GNOME panel. As unity will not use GNOME panel, so it's not possible to run applets unless canonical figure out some way to work around\n\nA: There are some indicators being developed by the gnome2's applets developers. Follows a big list of them:\nWhat Application Indicators are available?\n\nA: Another alternative is to install Cairo-Dock on your Ubuntu Unity. You will find it in the Ubuntu Software Centre as GLX-Dock.\nThis is a very cool application with a lot of it's own applets, like weather, disk usage, system monitor, etc.\n\nA: still to this date I had this problem,\nbut finally we can run gnome applets in unity as explained on this question.\nbasically you run gnome-panel, remove what you dont want from it with alt+super+rightClick and add what you want too; now I can finally access the \"cpu frequency scaling monitor\" after more than a year...\n", "Q: Nautilus wants a password when I try connecting to a public Windows share There is a computer on my network running Windows 7 Professional with a bunch of shared folders and printers available on the default WORKGROUP domain. There is no password for any of these shares and they can be happily accessed from Windows on any other computer on the network. (And all the Windows computers can access Ubuntu's Samba shares).\nIf I use the Network place in Nautilus, the computer itself is visible under smb://workgroup/. However, when I try to mount that, Nautilus asks me for a password! With no other option, I entered the username and password for the one user on the machine. It tried to do something for a second then asked again (ad infinitum).\nTrying to add a printer with CUPS is equally broken. Its various interfaces have given me “Unable to connect to CIFS host” and “NT_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER,” but I'm not sure if it's the same problem. If we can figure out the file shares first, maybe that will explain itself.\nSamba itself should be almost pristine. I have not touched any configuration files; just added some shares through the Folder Sharing options in Nautilus (nautilus-share).\nAny idea what's going on here? :)\n\nA: Last time I checked (some months ago), I explicitly had to add a permission for \"Guest\" to the Windows 7 share (Advanced Sharing > Permissions) to allow password-free connections. \"Everyone\" alone didn't work for whatever reason. Maybe this has changed in the meantime, but it's worth a try.\n\nA: The problem here is most likely the fact that samba is not perfect and sometimes has problems with newer versions of windows.\nSamba actually has to play a kind of catch up game with windows, so sometimes thinks break between windows versions. If you need to configure samba (it might not fix the problem NB) try GADMIN-Samba in the software center.\nYou could also try tweaking the sharing options on windows 7, but in my experience vista and seven tend not to work too well with Samba.\n", "Q: How to fix apt-get autoremove? The apt-get autoremove command does not have any effect in Maverick. How can I solve that?\n\nEDIT: Restoring a VM backup containing a clean install solved the\n  problem.\n\n\nA: Go to System > Administration > Computer Janitor. You can find all the packages that can be removed. \n\nBut, I am not sure whether it happens in 10.10\n\nA: Restoring a VM backup containing a clean install solved the problem.\n", "Q: Will it be possible / desirable to port Unity back to Mutter at some point? As far as I know, there are plans to port Unity from Mutter to Compiz due to some performance problems caused by the first.\nIf these problems with Mutter are fixed at some point in the future, and considering that stock Gnome uses Mutter, would you consider porting back to it? Would it still be technically possible?\n\nA: \"Plans to port\" meaning Unity has been ported to Compiz, and we are just smoothing out some rough edges before we release a Compiz based Unity.\nWhile it would of course be technically possible, it would be a lot of work for no considerable benefit. The time that would be spent porting Unity BACK to Mutter could (and definitely will) be spent making Unity rock beyond understanding.\n\nA: The animations will still be there of course, and we hope better. The thing about the port is that we switched away from Clutter, because we were reaching technical limits. And this is not a lighthearted decision, considering what we've invested in our previous Clutter-based implementations and also considering that our lead developer (Neil Patel) worked on early versions of Clutter and still has a lot of respect for the work of the Clutter team.\n", "Q: Will the Unity \"file manager\" feature right-clicks? One thing that disturbs my workflow with Unity is that I can not right-click on items in the \"file browsing mode\". \nFor example, if I want to open a photo not with EOG but with Shotwell Editor, I first of to open the file by left-clicking on it, and then select \"Edit with ...\". Simply right-clicking on it would be much easier.\nThe menu could be implement to look similar to those when you right-click on a launcher icon. Are there any plans to implement such a functionality?\n\nA: Yeah, it will. I'm not sure if it's going to happen for 11.04, but 11.10 wil see a lot of work on the dash and places. For 11.04 we're going to bring nautilus back into the front so that working with files is easier until we flesh out the interaction details for the dash.\n", "Q: How can I rename many files at once? I need to rename a bunch of files in order to fix their sort order, therefore I need to be able to do a sort of \"find and replace\" so I can replace chunks of the filenames at a time.\nWhat tools should I use? I prefer GUI but a command line tool recommendation would also be fine.\n\nA: Métamorphose\nhttps://github.com/metamorphose\nmay be a little difficult to handle, but really powerful!\n\nA: There are a few but I recommend gprename \n which is a good compromise between usability and functionality. \nOther tools are: rename, krename \n, pyrenamer \n, cuteRenamer, ...\n\nA: If you like the shell and perl regular expressions I'd recommend rename. It's as plain as it's name.\n\nA: thunar file manager is a GUI with a bulk rename option\nhttp://thunar.xfce.org/pwiki/documentation/bulk_renamer\nit's not standard on Gnome but can be installed through the software centre\n\nA: If you are familiar with Emacs, I think nothing beats Dired for this task. Even if you don't use Emacs that often you may find Dired a handy tool.\nsudo aptitude install emacs23-nox\nStart Emacs Dired mode for a directory:\nemacs -nw path/to/dir/\nNow enter edit directory mode:\nC-x C-q (that is Ctrl+x followed by Ctrl+q)\nYou can now edit the filenames like editing text in every plain text editor. You may even chose to replace the filenames using regular expressions (note that unfortunately Emacs uses a different syntax than PCRE).\nFor example, to rename files with counter (starting by 1):\nM-x replace-regexp (that is Alt+x followed by the string \"replace-regexp\" typed in the minibuffer at the bottom of the screen).\nReplace regexp:  DSCN\\([0-9]+\\).JPG\nReplace with:    \\,(format \"P%04d.jpg\" (1 + \\#))\nTo reuse a counter in the filename:\nM-x replace-regexp\nReplace regexp: DSCN\\([0-9]+\\).JPG\nReplace with: \\,(format \"P%04d.jpg\" (string-to-number \\1))\nWhen finished, type:\nC-c C-c (that is Ctrl+c followed by Ctrl+c)\nOr alternatively press the following sequence to abort your changes:\nC-c Esc (that is Ctrl+c followed by Esc)\n\nA: I tend to use mmv, which is command-line based, and has a somewhat quirky expression syntax but tend to solve most of my problems.\n\nA: I really like qmv from the renameutils package. It enables you to use your favorite (terminal based) text editor to rename files. I prefer to invoke it with -f do which gives you a single column (one row per file) with filenames. Combined with the power of Vim it gives you all the tools you need to do massive filename editing.\nhttp://www.nongnu.org/renameutils/\n\nA: If you use Nautilus and know how Nautilus Scripts work, you could use nautilus-renamer.\n\nA: find -execdir rename\nThis renames files and directories with a regular expression affecting only basenames, for example:\nPATH=/usr/bin find . -depth -execdir rename \"s/^find/replace/\" '{}' \\;\n\nor to affect files only:\nPATH=/usr/bin find . -type f -execdir rename \"s/^find/replace/\" '{}' \\;\n\nI have explained it in more detail at: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16541582/find-multiple-files-and-rename-them-in-linux/54163971#54163971\n\nA: On the command line theres also the possibility to use magic of sed and shell:\nls *.c | sed \"s#\\(.*\\)\\.c#mv \\0 \\1.cpp#\" | sh\n\n\nA: For me the pyRenamer worked the best. Nothing (sadly) comes close to Total Commanders built it renaming tool. pyRenamer doesn't integrate with Krusader but considering the fact, that you don't use the renaming tools that often anyway, pyRenamer is a very good option.\n\nA: This is the tool I use: rnm (man page) (more examples)\nSome Usage:\nrnm file-name -ns new-filename             # single file\nrnm ./* -ns '/n//i/'                       # files will be sorted and indexed.\nrnm ./* -rs '/search/new/g'                # 'search' in filenames will be replaced with 'new'\nrnm ./* -ns '/fn//i/' -ss 'search'         # only files/directories which contain 'search' in their name will be indexed (renamed).\nrnm ./* -ns '/fn//id/' -fo                 # file only mode, directories will be ignored.\nrnm ./* -ns '/fn//id/' -fo -dp -1          # recursive to subdirectories all the way.\n\netc...\n\n\nA: Personally I use Ant Renamer with Wine because nothing I've tried (Métamorphose, PyRenamer, GPRename, KRename) is as powerful, easy to install and easy to use. And it's still FOSS so I don't see the problem.\n\nA: Krename is a KDE GUI for renaming files, generally found in most package managers.\nThis answer applies to removing leading numbers that may be found in music files such as mp3s. But Krename does mass rename as well.\n\n\n*\n\n*Load selected files or folder. Krename loads all files in the selected folder, just click on Open without having to individually select all files.\n\n*Go to the Destination tab to overwrite or copy files to another folder.\n\n\n*Go to the Filename tab, then to the Advanced Filename tab.\n\n\n*Start by removing the token $ in the Template window. A change takes place in the Renamed window below. No filenames appear, only the file extensions.\n\n\n*Click on Insert Part of Filename... and select the parts of the filename you want to keep. This operation will include all the files and the changes will be obvious in the Renamed window below.\n\n\n*Click OK. The files are renamed without the leading numbers.\n\n\n*Finally, click Finished at the bottom right corner.\n\nA: A newer GUI batch rename utility that runs on Linux (it also works on Mac and Windows) is Inviska Rename.\n\nBesides the usual rename functions like replacing a portion of the text with some other text, inserting or removing text, renaming file extensions, and so on, this tool can rename folders, rename music based on tags, and rename photos using their Exif information. It can even batch rename using file attributes like the creation or modification date.\nOther features include previewing the new filenames and undoing the batch rename, which I find very useful.\nSource\n\nA: The cross-platform file manager Double Commander (released under GNU GPL 2 license) includes a fairly powerful \"Multi Rename Tool\":\n\nI used to use the very powerful Bulk Rename Utility for Windows under WINE, but the Double Commander tool gets me most of the way there.\n", "Q: How to enable 3D in VMware Player?

When installed, you are able to import PDF presentations with OpenOffice.org Impress. Even though the conversion is not 100% smooth, you are able to edit the background and change the color. It may be a bit tedious if you are dealing with lots of slides, but it's the best solution I found for these cases. You should note that everything is converted into Impress' objects.\n\nA: If you have openoffice.org installed, you can install the pdf-import plugin (I believe it is in the software center), and then open your pdf in openoffice.org writer, change the background, and save it again.\nYou can even create a hybrid pdf file.\n\nA: in ImageMagick:\n\n\n*\n\n*file -> open -> foo.pdf -> import\n\n*select -> by color -> \n\n*second item in toolbar (dutch: bewerken) -> fill with BG-color\n\n*repeat 2 and 3 if necessary for other background colors\n\n*file -> print\n\n\nA: try to guess the background density and move all to white:\nconvert -density 300 foo.pdf  -white-threshold 80% bar.pdf\n\n", "Q: Will Compiz in Unity use Emerald as its window decorator?

This would allow you to add a line to your /etc/fstab which will mount the share as part of the system startup. You would then simply check to see if your mountpoint contains files to make sure that the mount worked successfully. Check with the Ubuntu documentation for detailed information on adding a line to /etc/fstab.\nIf you need to use ncpmount, bear in mind you will have to use the -P option, as the user will not be able to enter a password if one is required. That being said, you could use a rc.local file to run ncpmount as part of the system startup. I recommend looking to the Ubuntu documentation for detailed information about rc.local.\nFinally, after doing all that typing, I found this document on Novell's site. It's a walkthrough for setting up /etc/fstab to automatically mount a NetWare share on system startup.

I tried to make a dual boot setup on my computer. Already had windows 7 installed on one hard drive, then tried to install ubuntu on part of another hard drive. When i turn my computer on windows7 always boots, there is no option to select which os to boot regardless of the order i put the hard drives to boot from in the bios this always happens. If I remove the hard drive with windows on it instead of booting ubuntu it just says there is an error - windows can't boot because something is missing.

Something else which may help: originaly i had kubuntu installed before windows but when i insstalled windows 7 i could no longer get to it and just stopped uing it. How can I stop this from happening so that I can boot into Ubuntu?\n\nA: What's happened is that Windows 7 has overridden Grub (the Linux boot loader) with its own bootloader. This is fixable, it just takes a little bit of work. Here's how to fix it.\nYou'll need an Ubuntu 10.10 live cd.\nBoot into the live session\nOpen a terminal (Applications > Accessories > Terminal) and become root by running\nsudo su -\n\nNext you'll need to inspect your disk and look at the partitioning. Run\nfdisk -l\n\nYou'll need to do a little bit of detective work, but you want to identify the Ubuntu root partition. you will get output that looks like this\n   Device    Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n   /dev/sda1   *           1       18663   149903360   83  Linux\n   /dev/sda2           18663       19458     6384641    5  Extended\n   /dev/sda5           18663       19458     6384640   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nWith another for your windows setup. The /dev/sda1 line, and the numbers will probably be different, but you want to find the one that is listed as System: Linux.\nNow you'll mount that, and install grub.\nmount /dev/sda1 /mnt\ngrub-install --root-directory=/mnt/ /dev/sd1\n\nreplacing /dev/sda1 with what yours said.\nThat should be it, reboot and you should be able to boot Ubuntu and Windows.\n\nA: You need to install grub on the correct hard drive (the drive that boots first).

This is a small nuisance I've had in Ubuntu forever. When I set my computer to login automatically, Network Manager asks me for my keyring password every time it boots and it refuses to connect to the Internet until I enter it. Is there a reason for that?\nAlso, other network managers such as Connman don't have this problem, and I have noticed the latter also has an application indicator while NM-applet runs in the Notification Area. Are there plans to migrate to Connman, or to adapt NM-applet for Natty?\n\nA: NM does not ask for your root password! It asks for your keyring password.\nYour keyring saves passwords encrypted, so no one can steal them. That is why you need to enter your keyring password, so Ubuntu can decrypt your passwords to use them (eg. to get your WLAN-Password).\nYou can check the content of your keyring in Menu -> System -> Preferences -> Passwords and Encryption Keys. Here you will find all your passwords in cleartext, after you unlocked your keyring (rightklick an element -> properties -> password -> show password).\nTo change your keyring password, rightklick the line Password: login and choose Change Password\n\nChoosing no password will make keyring never ask for any password again, but still save them (unencrypted! So this should not be your first choice on a Notebook).\n\nA: The reason why NetworkManager asks for your password is that it wants to keep your passwords in a safe place (an encrypted keyring), while ConnMan doesn't care about that...\nIf you don't care about security, you can remove the password from the GNOME keyring, or use ConnMan instead...\nAnd migrating to ConnMan as the default in Ubuntu is currently no option, as it only support Ethernet and WiFi, but no modems (PSTN, ISDN, DSL, 3G), Bluetooth, VPN, etc.\n\nA: For WPA-Enterprise connections using a username/password, the password is usually stored in the user keyring, even if the \"available to all users\" checkbox is ticked.\nThe only way I have found to prevent that NetworkManager asks for my password is by manually editing the connection settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit the network connection, making sure the \"available to all users\" checkbox is enabled. Save it.\n\n*Open a terminal and change directory: cd /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections. Each file in that directory represents one of the connections saved to \"all users\" by NetworkManager.\n\n*Use sudo grep flags * to list all the files that use password flags. You will see the file name that represents your WPA Enterprise wifi connection. Let's call that file myconnection.\n\n*Edit the file sudo nano myconnection\n\n*Go to the section [802-1x] in the file, remove the password-flags and add a line password=mypassword.\n\n*Save the file\nOn the next reboot NetworkManager should have the password already, so it should not need to unlock the keyring to connect to it.\nNote that this approach stores your password in a plain text file. Although the text file is only readable by root, NetworkManager is able to read it, and any user can see the password as well going to the \"edit connection\" settings in NetworkManager. This solution may be practical to users who use a paswordless-login on a computer that is only used by them.\n\nA: There is an option in Network manager not to use password.\nIf you edit the connection, at the bottom of the page there is a box \"available to all users\" if you tick this it will not require a password.\nTo edit right click the icon, select edit Connections, select wireless,select your connection and click edit.\n\n\nA: As said above it is primarily a security feature. It disallows unauthorized users to access/modify data on your PC.\n", "Q: Why are the MeMenu and the messaging applet two separate things?

I also don't want to lose my Ubuntu installation/data. (I'm happy to trash the Windows partitions completely - I have backed everything up from those).\nUpdate: Having checked my bootloader, I've deleted the Windows partitions and I now have free space. Unfortunately it looks like I can't resize the existing / (root) partition because it's mounted. Can I get around this, or do I have to re-install?\n\nA: If you need to expand the current partitions, the new free space after deleting the old Windows partitions should be right next to them. Also this has to be done with a lot of care, otherwise you may screw up the whole system. My advice is to delete the Windows partitions and turn them into EXT4 partitions which you can use from Ubuntu to store stuff, like movies, etc.\nFor this you need to use the utility called GParted. Install it from the Software Center if you haven't installed already. When you start GParted, it lists the partitions in your hard disk. They will be denoted in \\dev\\sda1 etc. You may be able to easily distinguish the Windows partitions from their file systems and mount points. \nDelete the Windows partitions using the menu which appears when you right click. \n\nThe partition will now be marked as an unallocated space. Right click again and choose New. Choose the format you want to partition it into and click on the Apply All Operations tool button. \nRead this tutorial if you're new to GParted.\n\nA: In standard installations GRUB is probably not located in Windows partitions but it would be wise to check this first by running the BootInfo script before you end up with an unbootable machine after having deleted a partition.\nOnce you have backuped all your important data you can then boot from a LiveCD and start GParted as mentioned already. Note that deleting or resizing partitions is possible for unmounted partitions only.\n\nA: Your bootloader (GRUB2) is really not in C: but in /dev/sda. So you can go ahead and delete windows partitions in gparted, booted from Live-CD. Check that Ubuntu will boot. After that, boot LiveCD again and grow your Ubuntu / partition via mouse in gparted.\n\nA: Whichever method you use to accomplish this, you run a risk of losing some or all of your data. I think the least risky option is firstly to do a backup (eg rsync), followed by some sort of verification. Then perform a fresh install, creating whichever partitions you require. Then restore your backed-up data. Lastly reinstall your full complement of packages (perhaps using aptoncd; it should be available in the repositories).\n\nA: Regarding backups: If you have some extra space available on another external disk, the most robust option would be to make a full disk image using CloneZilla before you start tweaking anything. After that, you can reformat the NTFS partition as ext4/reiserfs/whatever and either a) mount that as part of the filesystem by editing your fstab (for automatically mounting) or b) use gparted to expand your existing installation into the empty space. Having a disk image will give you peace of mind; but it takes up a lot of space and time to make one. If you move any partitions around you'll have to reinstall GRUB (the disk sector it needs to jump to in order to boot will have moved.) To do that, as mentioned above, use sudo install-grub /dev/<disk name>. It should update grub automatically, if I recall correctly... If you don't move any partitions, just reboot into your Ubuntu install, and run sudo update-grub to have grub re-scan your disk for bootable partitions (removing the Windows option).\n\nA: Don't make it too complicated.  It's very simple...pop in the Ubuntu CD and restart.  When you go through the install process, select the option to erase and use all space from your hard drive.  It will delete all partitions, reformat and install.  It does everything for you.  When everything is said and done, it should work like new minus any extra configuration you choose to do.\n", "Q: How closely will Unity follow the Desktop version specification? I read here that these will be some of the features of the Desktop version of Unity:\n\n\n*\n\n*A floating Unity Dash that can be moved to all edges of the screen.\n\n*Floating, overlapping windows with their title bars and controls on them, not on the top panel.\n\n*The home screen consolidated into a simple pop-down menu that extends down from the top left of the screen and allows you access to your programs and desktop search.\n\n\nI'm not sure how closely these points represent the plans for Unity on the desktop. When it talks about a floating Dash, does it mean the Launcher? As far as I know the dash is fullscreen so, how could it be moved to the edges? Also, why move it if it closes as soon as you choose an item? If it means the Launcher, do you plan to allow moving it to all edges?\nIsn't floating, overlapping windows with their title bars and controls on them what we always had? also, Desktop-Unity is supposed to keep using the global menu so, doesn't that contradict the specification?\nFinally, supposing \"the home screen\" means the dash, do you plan to make it not-fullscreen?\n\nA: \nI'm not sure how closely these points\n  represent the plans for Unity on the\n  desktop.\n\nThat blueprint (or \"blueprint entry\", since there's no actual specification linked) does not represent the actual plans for Unity. It wasn't registered by people working on or planning Unity; it was registered by a community member as a proposal for the discussion of his idea at UDS, and since what it proposed overlapped largely with what the Unity people at Canonical were already planning internally and were about to announce at UDS, it was set as approved for discussion. As such, and as you noted, some of the terminology is off.\nTo get an idea as to what the plans precisely are, I suggest waiting for the actual blueprints to solidify and get approved in the coming week or two, and keeping an eye on design.canonical.com. If you're impatient, poking around the Gobby documents might also reveal some hints, and you can always ask around on IRC and the mailing lists.\n\nA: That blueprint does not reflect the final plan - it was a proposal from a member of the community, and some elements are consistent with the final plan, but not the whole piece.\nThe key differences in the Natty version of Unity will be:\n\n\n*\n\n*The launcher will hide intelligently by default (you can keep it hidden or lock it in view if you want)\n\n*There will be no systray, except perhaps for a NetworkManager special-case\n\n*We'll include Nautilus on the launcher by default and make it easier to launch from the Dash Files interface too\n\n*We'll support more hardware, including lower-end chipsets\n\n*The menu will not be shown unless invoked by mouse or accelerator key\n\n", "Q: getting grub error 17 after booting my laptop has 80 gb hard disk.

Since the installation didn't complete, do it again.\n\nA: You must install 10.10 again (and complete it). After that, you will have GRUB with Ubuntu 10.10 and Windows too.\n\nA: If you know that your laptop \"went away\" when it had finished copying files, you can boot from CD, then mount up your local linux partition and chroot to it (mount proc and bind /dev inside your intended chroot) then just rerun grub installation (grub-install ) and you should have everything up and running.

(Internal Field Separator)\nBy default it contains space, tab and newline.\nfor f in `find ... will split on the chars contained in the $IFS variable. If there is a newline or space in file names returned by the find command, it will be treated as a different file name and thus the loop will be executed for each part of the name.\n\n$ ls -l\n-rw-r--r-- 1 marko marko 0 2010-11-01 12:06 my?bad.exe\n-rw-r--r-- 1 marko marko 0 2010-11-01 12:06 space bad.exe\n$ for f in $(find -name \"*.exe\"); do echo \"ITERATING ($f)\"; done \nITERATING (./space)\nITERATING (bad.exe)\nITERATING (./my)\nITERATING (bad.exe)\n\nWe could tweak the $IFS variable, but it's tricky.

Take in consideration that the last file is terminated by \":\" and thus bash iterates one last time with an empty string.\n\nIFS=\":\"; for f in $(find -name \"*.exe\" -exec echo -n {}: \\;); do if [ ! -z \"$f\" ]; then rm \"$f\"; fi; done;\n\nYou should be able to perform also your basename/dirname test within this loop, as you did before.\n\nHowever, this solution is ugly and works only because we have a character which we can rely on.\nIt turns out that the find command itself can execute commands for each file it finds.\n\nfind -name \"*.exe\" -exec ./yourscript.sh {} \\;\n\nThen yourscript.sh wil lget the full name in $1 and you can delete with rm \"$1\" even if it contains newlines and spaces.\nThe find command can also be used to perform inline the basename/dirname test you do inside your script, but it's more advanced topic.\n\nA: This will handle filenames containing any character allowed in a filename, including newlines.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif (($# != 1)); then\n     echo >&2 \"Usage: $0 directory\"\n     exit 1\nfi\n\nwhile IFS= read -r -d '' file; do \n    base=${file##*/} dir=${file%/*/*}\n    if [[ $dir/${base%.exe}/$base -ef $file ]]; then\n        echo rm \"$file\"\n    fi\ndone < <(find \"$1\" -type f -name \"*.exe\" -print0)\n\nSee http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/020 and http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/100 for more elaboration.\n\nA: You could actually use ( *.exe ) to solve this problem in bash.\nPutting parenthesis like this ( and ) around a pattern means that it will be expanded and stored in an array.\nThen you can iterate over each item in the array using something like this:\nexes=( *.exe )\nfor exe in \"${exes[@]}\"; do\n    echo \"'$exe'\"\ndone\n\nHere's a full example:\n$ mkdir 'dir\n> with\n> spaces'\n$ touch 'dir\n> with\n> spaces/dir\n> with\n> spaces'\n$ touch 'dir\n> with\n> spaces/other\n> file'\n$ find .\n.\n./dir?with?spaces\n./dir?with?spaces/dir?with?spaces\n./dir?with?spaces/other?file\n$ cd 'dir\n> with\n> spaces'\n$ files=( * )\n$ for file in \"${files[@]}\"; do\n> echo \"'$file'\"\n> done\n'dir\nwith\nspaces'\n'other\nfile'\n\nI can only provide a full solution after you clarify what your directory structure looks like, because I am not sure if current_dir_name is doing what you think it is.\n", "Q: How to change monitor position/navigation?

The wireless laptop is the only one required to have internet access.\n\nA: If you're using NetworkManager, it should just work. That said, you will need to set specific settings for your wired connection.\nSelect your wired connection in the Connection Editor window for NetworkManager (right click on the applet icon, then select Edit Connections). Click Edit, then switch to the IPv4 Settings tab and click the Routes button at the bottom.\n\nYou can then force the wired connection to not claim the default gateway (since NM would usually prefer wired over wireless), by checking the \"Use this connection only for the resources on its network\" checkbox.\n\n\nA: The issue here is more of the load-balancing between the wired and wireless connection. Usually, there is only one default route (0.0.0.0, netmask 0.0.0.0), in the routing table.\nIf there is more than one, the first one will always be used, and so the second one will not be. On the router side, if the request comes from one IP address, it will be responded on the same IP address.\nWhat you need is known as load-balancing.

If you would like a recommendation on an address book that'll work with the panel applet and a calendar that'll work with the clock applet without forcing you to setup Evolution mail, look at contacts  and dates \n\nA: Nowadays when corporations and \"intelligence\" agencies intercept our daily communication which is all based to a consitent PIM (Personal Information Management) GNU/Linux OS still cannot provide easy-to-use calendar and addressbook solution.\nContacts in GNU/Linux Ubuntu is un-usable, because one can simply not syncronise it and dates has been discontinued for up-to-date releases.\nMeanwhile Apple ceases to provide local synchronisation capability in OS X 10.9 and argues user should just store their data in the cloud. - Well if we want to offer people who want to switch to a free operation system they should get an easy to use option.\nImagine you are using thunderbird and want to sync your calendar and addressbooks to a CalDAV/CardDAV server (on your NAS at home or your hosting provider), such as Owncloud or DAViCal you'd need to install SoGo-connector and on top of that Lightning and hope that all would work. Still your addresses & contacts would not be integrated in your systems calender and your appointment would only appear if your mail-client is running. - How tricky!\nMany other client applications have been either discontinued or ceased developpment.\nTherefore I come to the conclusion that the most simple and broadly GNU/Linux compatible solution is using mutt with pycarddav and khal. - There is nothing better than the good old command line! And the most reliable solution too!\nBut I guess the maintainers of GNU/Linux Debian & GNU/Linux Ubuntu should finally think about ways offering working gui solutions for all these users that will switch from proprietary desktop to GNU/Linux!\n", "Q: How to tell when the Operating System was installed? \nPossible Duplicate:\nDate Ubuntu was installed? \n\nuptime shows how long ago the computer was started, and that is very handy to know, but I want to know how long ago the system was installed.  \nIs there any way to do this?\n\nA: I would check the creation date of the /boot folder.\n", "Q: How to install World of Warcraft?

I read that on Natty if Unity is not be supported  by my hardware Ubuntu install a desktop like Maverick.\nCan, Unity and Gnome, stay together on a cd or Ubuntu will be on a dvd?\n\nA: The plan is to ship Natty on a CD. However, the addition of Unity, GTK3 and Banshee means that other aspects of the CD footprint need to be optimized, so that it can still fit on to a CD.\nThere is a blueprint which is driving this work: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/performance-desktop-n-install-footprint. Some things which might be removed from the CD include upstream changelogs and Perl\n\nA: I spoke with Martin Pitt about this specific issue at UDS last week.\nYes, CD's will still be the primary distribution media for Natty.  There is already a DVD version with additional software, but the development team considers the CD important.  Many users download the distro as an ISO; DVD ISOs take a lot longer to download.  Martin also shared his opinion that the space limitation of the CD forces the team to be efficient and selective in what they include, keeping the distro lean and mean.\nI've heard proposals rather than a DVD image, to move to a 1G usb stick type of distribution.  However, Martin has further ideas on how to cut more fat out of our existing stuff (like dropping changelogs in packages, trimming down what all's included with open office, and so on), so I think until all those ideas are exhausted we won't see ubuntu changing the standard target media type.\n(Personally, I favor the idea of having a 'core' cd and an 'applications' cd, but I think I may be alone in this opinion.)\n", "Q: Importing Windows Live Mail Email Accounts into Evolution I was wondering if it's possible to get Evolution Mail in Ubuntu to be able to import a Windows Live Mail email account export, I have multiple email accounts and lots of email messages attached to each account and and being able to import them all into Evolution would be nice.

With unity being ported to compiz (I read somewhere as a plugin?), will unity be getting a plugin/extension framework of some sort? If yes, what languages are on the table? Python, Vala, C++? Or will it be something more like GObject-Introspection?\nAlong with this, are widgets/gadgets/miniapps/w.e planned?\nPlease let me know if to split the question.\n\nA: In addition to what Murat said, the pluggable renderers may make it possible for items to paint themselves, creating the possibility a widgets place. The unity team has no plans for an official widgets layer or anything like that, but the possibility may exist when pluggable renderers are implemented. However; since none of this is actually coded, it remains to be seen what will actually be doable via renderers.\n\nA: Take a look at the existing Places architecture, and the \"Unity Architecture\" document. You'll note that Places renderers are going to be pluggable, and that there's a DBus API for daemons that are meant to expose Places entries, which translates to the whole thing being largely language-independent.\nThere's a sample place, and a YouTube place branch in the same project that you may want to study.\nWidgets and the like can be implemented as or in places, as well as Compiz plugins as before. You can expect there to be design guidelines advising developers on the scope of Places (similar to the ones for application indicators) soon.\n\nA: In addition to the other good answers, the libraries created by the DX team tend to be written in Vala which means that any language with GObject-introspection bindings will be supported.  Currently Python (and obviously Vala) are the only non-C languages with GObject-introspection bindings that I'm aware of, but I'd expect more languages to pick up bindings in the future (I know there's at least one set of Mono gis bindings in the pipeline).\nThat's in as well as the DBus interfaces which are language-agnostic.\n", "Q: How can I sync files when I plug in my USB \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I keep a folder synchronized to an external USB hard drive in Ubuntu? \n\nI was thinking it would be EXTREMELY useful if I could sync the files between a folder on my USB and a folder on my desktop.\nIf someone can give me a simple set of instructions on this topic I would be thrilled!\n\nA: Opps I think I created a duplicate post of this topic found here.\n", "Q: How does one enable Compiz on Alienware M11x R2?

There are comments in the /etc/rsyslog.d/20-ufw.conf file that give you the option to keep UFW-events from being logged to the kernel and message logs, which i have done. \nI would really like to get UFW-events out of the dmesg as well, but how to accomplish that? \n\nA: For people who would like to fine tune the log level further, I suggest using 'log' or reject/deny rules (see the ufw man page for details). For exampe, you can use 'logging off' and then insert explicit logging rules for what you want to log. Alternatively, you can use 'logging low' and then insert explicit deny/reject rules to quietly deny matches that would otherwise be logged.\n\nA: You can disable UFW logging with following command from shell:\nsudo ufw logging off\n\nDefault loglevel is low. From UFW man page:\n\n\n*\n\n*off    disables ufw managed logging\n\n*low    logs all blocked packets not matching the default policy (with rate limiting), as well as packets matching logged rules\n\n*medium log level low, plus all allowed packets not matching the default policy, all INVALID packets, and all new connections.  All logging is done with rate limiting.\n\n*high   log level medium (without rate limiting), plus all packets with rate limiting\n\n*full   log level high without rate limiting\n\n\nYou can get current log level with sudo ufw status verbose.\n\nA: You could also just use grep to filter out the UFW messages. For instance,\ndmesg | grep -v UFW\n\nThis way you can also keep the logging for reviewing.\n\nA: The above answer is the only way:\n    dmesg | grep -v UFW\n\nBut you can use this more easily, by setting an alias like this:\n    alias dmesg='dmesg | grep -v UFW'\n\nThis will execute dmesg | grep -v UFW if you enter dmesg.\nIf you want to keep the colorful version of dmesg, you can use the following command:\n    alias dmesg='dmesg --color=always | grep -v UFW --color=always'\n\nThis way dmesg use colors over the pipe too.\nWARNING! Only use this method while viewing logs and searching for something, because this might break some 3rd party scripts in that session.\n\nA: I have done some investigation into this issue.\nI don't believe there is a way around this.\nThe dmesg command directly prints the contents of the Kernel Ring Buffer. This contains all the ufw log entries that you are seeing.\nThe /etc/rsyslog.d/20-ufw.conf file is telling rsyslog which of the ufw entries in the Kernel Ring Buffer to log to either the /var/log/ufw.log or /var/log/kern.log.\nYou can prevent the ufw entries from being logged to /var/log/kern.log (to remove duplication) by uncommenting the line in /etc/rsyslog.d/20-ufw.conf that contains & ~.\nUnfortunately there is no way to prevent the dmesg command from displaying these messages. Your work around is the best I can come up with.\n\nA: To get rid of the warnings, you can also block the IPs explicitly in case you are sure they are malicious, see UFW BLOCK entries in the log\nIt uses the command sudo ufw deny from XXX to YYY so that those IPS cannot ping or ssh your server. The script in the link above parses all those malicious IPs from the syslog.\n", "Q: How can I find the total size of the contents of my Trash folder?

I did try to install some driver updates and such, but it is still not solved, I will look into it soon enough and see what has gone wrong, but the pen worked perfectly OOTB.\nPS... as far as I know, pen tilt is not supported, everything else works fine (pressure does of course)\n\nA: The Wacom Bamboo Pen currently (in 10.10) doesn't work out of the box either.  I saw reports that it works with the latest upstream release of the wacom drivers though, so it might work OOTB on Ubuntu 11.04.\n", "Q: Are there plans for a progress indicator? Status menus seem to be intended, among other things, to streamline indications. Some of these indications are not confined to the old Notification Area: others can be found on their own windows and indicate running processes, such as Nautilus copying some files, Firefox performing downloads or Brasero burning a DVD.\nI have seen a series of mockups showcasing mockups for a progress indicator:\n\n\nI would like to know if there are any actual plans to create a real progress indicator to house this type of indications.\n\nA: It IS possible via library called Taskview. See https://github.com/ssickert/TaskView. It already has plugins for lots of apps, we just need an AppIndicator which supports it.\n\nA: it won't happen with the current notification service... there are replacement notification services that could/would support such a thing, but the current dbus notification can't hack such a thing.\n", "Q: Sound problem with Toshiba Satellite L35-SP1011 I've installed Ubuntu 10.04 on a Satellite L35-SP1011 and there's no sound.\nActually I have many video problems cause I had to disable effect because when it had effect activated, laptop got frozen many times.\nI saw this problem but in older Ubuntu versions and tried some fixes without success.

I've noticed that Ubuntu 10.10 manages single .deb files with the Ubuntu Software Center. Since I find it too heavy to load I've installed gdebi with: sudo apt-get install gdebi\nand I've set it as default application to open any .deb file.\nMy question is: is it safe/supported to use this kind of operation? I mean: does gdebi still relate to internal apt-get to satisfy dependencies and install .deb files?\n\nA: Gdebi is still part of the standard Kubuntu installation and it still works the same there as it used to. As I understand it, the reason why it was removed in Ubuntu has nothing to do with problems with Gdebi, but rather with improvements to Software Center that made it extraneous. \nI say, go for it.\n\nA: It is PERFECTLY safe.  I frequently prefer to use the lightweight GDebi instead of Software Center, especially during the SC installation bug period.\n\nA: It should be just fine to use gdebi the way you are using it.\nBoth accomplish the same thing.  Gdebi does relate to internal apt-get to satisfy dependencies and install .debs.  It worked in previous versions of Ubuntu, it will work in Maverick.\n", "Q: recordMyDesktop stopped working after upgrade I've done the upgrade to Ubuntu 10.10 from Ubuntu 10.04, and recordMydesktop don't work now.

So far it has been as simple as\nsudo aptitude search unity #Remove all packages\nsudo aptitude search netbook #This was done for netbook editions\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nThere is no reason that a similar process for unity desktop won't carry over.\n", "Q: Is there a gedit plugin that adds search features? I'm hoping to add search and replace within selection and search within files. Having a search option in the context menu would also be handy.\n\nA: For searching within files I found this plugin: http://oliver.github.com/gedit-file-search/.  \nThe ability to search and replace only selected text has been requested for years\n( https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=150010 ) but I haven't found any plugins to do that.\nA complete list of gedit plugins: http://live.gnome.org/Gedit/Plugins\n\nA: Is this gedit search plugin what you're looking for?  Instructions to install are on that website.\n\nA: This thread is really old, but here is a little update. For gedit 3 I would recommend this plugin advanced-find over the gedit-file-search, because I was not able to install the latter with my gedit 3.4.1. Also, it works fine.\n\nA: From 16.04 onwards, the gedit-plugins package adds a \"Find in files...\" menu option into the hamburger menu (into the same section where the original \"Find...\" feature is located).\nThe default directory to search (can be overridden) is the currently active directory in the file-browser panel (provided by the accordingly named core plugin) (the file browser panel can be toggled on/off by F9).\nThe search is recursive in subdirectories.

Now it appears in front of you a long\nlist of config options. Filter it typing the keyword  quit in\nthe filter bar (up top).  After that the filter acts you will have\nonly few lines.

This will prevent you to close a window with\nmultiple tab.\nYou will not completely disable Ctrl-Q but at least you will make it harmless. \n\nA: Ctrl + Q isn't a Firefox specific shortcut, it's system wide on Ubuntu if you don't mind disabling it everywhere follow this answer. Basically, you create a new shortcut and assign /bin/false as command.\n\nNo restarting is needed.\n\nA: There is now an extension just for that:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/disable-ctrl-q-shortcut/\n2020 update:\nThe original extension has now disappeared from the addons store. Similar addons (see comments) have come and gone. One of the last remaining extensions (link) does not work on Linux due to: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1325692\n\nA: You can just add a custom shortcut for Ctrl + Q. In Ubuntu it is available directly in settings(How to). It will be captured by the OS and hence no app including Firefox would detect it. \nP.S. I have mapped it to play an 'Oops' sound.\nStep 1.

We would like instead to control it from a laptop/phone\nover the network.\nI'm open to suggestions for software to use, and the more flexible the interface,\nthe better.\n\nA: The first idea that jumps to mind is to just use mplayer. SSH into the remote machine, and control playback normally, DISPLAY=:0.0 mplayer dvd://1\nThe same could be done with xine  too.\n\nA: In software center, try anyremote (there should be a list of related interfaces if you search for it). On the website you can download a client for your phone. The documentation page contains extensive instructions on how to set up anyremote with your application, and a device for controlling the application remotely.\n\n\n*\n\n*I will update my answer with more choices as soon as I can (unless this is more than enough for you).\n\n\nA: VLC has a powerful set of interfaces you can use, including a web interface and a CURSES-based one that I use all the time for streaming video and controlling playback. The web interface can be customized with HTML/CSS for phone control or if you care about branding, and there's quite a bit of documentation available on the VLC wiki. Engadget had a nice article on this too: http://www.engadget.com/2005/11/29/how-to-stream-almost-anything-using-vlc/\n\nA: I use VLC on my computer and VLCRemote on my Android phone, works just beautifully. A one-time preference change is needed to enable the web interface in VLC.\n\nA: Try Remuco.\nRemuco is a duplex remote control system for Linux media players and mobile phones equipped with Bluetooth or WiFi.\nWith Remuco, you can remotely control your favorite media player. You can switch to the next, previous, or any other media within the current playlist, browse your media library and activate other playlists, rate your media, adjust volume, and more.

Basically, I want my windows to go wherever on the screen. I don't want to panel to be a block. How can I disable not being able to drag windows on top of not under the panel? Oh, and, yes: gnome-panel.\n\nA: Have you considered autohiding the panel and the setting a show delay so that it doesn't pop up AS SOON as you touch the top?\nFor the autohide just right click and check autohide from the panel properties menu. For the show delay hit ALT+f2 and type gconf-editor. Click EDIT > FIND and check both boxes. Search for \"show_delay\" and select the first result. Change the value to anything higher than 100. (I use 700, personally)\n\nA: You can install the compiz settings manager, go to \"window rules\"under \"window management\" and write gnome-panel on the field labeled \"bellow\" (Note: I'm writing this in a computer with Portuguese localization and trying to translate the terms to English so some names may be slightly different).\n\nA: In compiz-config, go to window rules and add type=Gnome-panel (case is important!) in the \"Below\" field.\nPlease note that alt+f2 will now be below as well, so add (title=Run Application) & (type=Dialog) to above.\nPlease note this DOES NOT WORK in Metacity\n", "Q: Nautilus sorts the Name-column \"mysteriously\". How can I change the collating sequence? What I describe here is not about a problem with my Nautilus. (it is the default behavour)\nI understand why Nautilus sorts the Name-column (ascending) so that \"6 cats\" occuring before \"10 dogs\"... Its collation sequence is treating a group of numeric-digits as a single number-value and not as individual characters.  \nThat's fine... I can see some value in it, but personally I find it to be confusing,  \nAnd I have no idea why Nautilus completely ignores many leading non-alpha-numeric characters.. ie.!@$%^_:\"- etc. as typed via as standard US keyboard..\nBy \"ignore\", I mean \"---two camels\" sorts to be immediately above \"two camels\", as if the \"---\" didn't exist... (strange !?).  \nHow can I change the default collating sequence?...   \ngconf-editor /apps/nautilus/list_view shows some sort options, but does not offer a choice of collation option....\nI hope there is an way to do this (otherwise Windows Explorer is one-up on this issue :( Windows allows you to choose the conventional collation sequence (via the registry)\n\nA: This answer is a workaround.\nI've put this information forward because it seems that Nautilus just can't sort in the manner I prefer / want / need.   \nPCMan File Manager has a similar look and feel to Nautilus, yet it sorts the detaill view in a \"by the column\" fashion...   \nIt sorts with most of the \"special\" characters to the top, and a few to the very bottom..  It is case insensitive, and is very close to what I was looking for (...\"approximate ASCII\"? followed by the remaining normally-sequenced Unicode Codpoint values/characters)..  \nIt is available in Synaptic Package Manager under the name: pcmanfm \n\nA: The sorting of Nautilus follows the default collating of the locale. This means you have to override the collating of your locale. \nTo get the sorting like you described, add the following line to ~/.gnomerc (create if it doesn't exist and mark it executable): export LC_COLLATE=POSIX.  One downside is that capital letters will sort ahead of lower case letters.\n\nA: Another workaround: \nin Krusader (version 2.2.0-beta1), \n\n\n*\n\n*go to Settings > Configure Krusader...\n\n*Panel > View\n\n*and choose Sort method: Character code. \n\n\nFiles with the same prefix are grouped.\n\nA: If you just want to put certain files or folders at the top, you can still use your non-alpha-numeric character but it needs also a \".\"\n_.file.doc\n", "Q: Why does adjusting my volume exit fullscreen videos? When playing flash videos (youtube, vimeo, whatever) in full screen mode, using my keyboard shortcuts to adjust the volume always causes me to exit full screen mode.  Unfortunately, they're my only way to adjust the volume, so it's really annoying.  \n\nA: Chris's explanation was very good, and there is also a Launchpad bug with more information.\n\nA: This is a bug in the Flash player.\nThe volume keys on your keyboard are handled by gnome-settings-daemon, which uses a passive grab on the volume keys. The way that X works means that an application needs to have focus in order to receive keypress events, so, what happens when you press the volume keys is that the flash player window sees a FocusOut event as focus is moved temporarily to gnome-settings-daemon.\nHowever, the FocusOut event has the mode set to NotifyGrab, and the flash player should be ignoring this event (it should only really respond when the mode is set to NotifyNormal, which would happen if you really did focus another window).\nHope that helps explain it a bit.\n", "Q: Why does Chrome video performance substantially degrade after waking from suspend in 10.10? Note: For some more details, some of which may not be true given what I've figured out, see this post.\nWhen I first boot my computer, video performance (both native H.264 HTML5 in YouTube and Vimeo, and in Flash) in Chrome is perfectly reasonable. CPU usage stays slow, everything works correctly, and the video is silky-smooth.\nBut for whatever reason, if I suspend my computer then wake it up, video performance plummets. Full screen HTML5 video is choppy at best, and full-screen Flash video basically brings my computer to its knees (I'm talking less than a frame a second, and a 5 second lead time to leave full-screen after hitting Esc). Restarting Chrome doesn't fix this — I need to completely restart my machine before performance goes back to normal. Video performance in other applications, such as Movie Player, doesn't seem to be affected at all by the suspend cycle — it's only Chrome.\nI'm using a Lenovo X201, with an Intel GMA HD graphics chipset, and Intel compnents all around (I don't need any proprietary drivers). This didn't happen in 10.04, and I haven't anything that I think would have caused this to happen. It's possible that a Chrome release could have caused this, but it seems less likely than a regression between 10.04 and 10.10.\nAny ideas?\nEDIT: In response Georg's comment, logging in and out doesn't fix it. Restarting Compiz or switching to Metacity (at least by using \"compiz/metacity --replace & disown\" — am I doing it right?) doesn't help (actually, it seemed to help somewhat with Flash once, but I haven't been able to reproduce this). I'm not sure about GDM — when I use \"sudo restart gdm\" I get kicked back to the Linux shell (?), which I have no idea how to get out of.\nAlso, I want to make very clear that this isn't just a case of Flash sucking (it does,but that's beside the point). I\"m seeing the same general problem with HTML5 videos, and Flash is performing better on my Nexus One than it does on my Core i5 laptop. There's something screwy going on with Chrome and/or 10.10.\n\nA: Upgrading to the new Chrome 8 beta fixed my problem with HTML5 video completely, since it added GPU acceleration. Flash is still as slugish as ever, but it runs well enough in Firefox, which isn't a problem for me since I've been using Firefox as my \"crap, I need Flash for this\" browser for a while anyway (I've had Flash disabled in Chrome 99% of the time for a while).\nThis isn't really an answer so much as an admission of defeat, but pending an actual solution, I think it's probably the most sensible advice for most people.\n", "Q: How to sync time? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to set Ubuntu to synchronize my clock with a time server? \n\nHow to sync time in Ubuntu 10.10 (a GUI solution if possible)?\nHow to sync time in Ubuntu 10.04 Server (a console solution if possible)?\n\nA: Open a terminal and run gnome-control-center command . In the gnome control center select 'Time and Date' .  Select 'Keep synchronized with internet servers' in the 'configuration' option.\n\nA: In a server you can use ntpd or ntpdate .\n", "Q: Why was Banshee chosen to be the default for 11.04? What are the reasons for Banshee replacing Rhythmbox in Ubuntu 11.04?\nI don't want your opinion on which is best nor why. I want to know what the reasoning was behind the decision.\n\nA: This was discussed and decided at UDS-N on Friday 29th October at 10:00 AM. The blueprint for the default application selection is on Launchpad. There hasn't yet been a video posted of the session on the ubuntu developers channel but there may be in the future. You can also look at the IRC log for this session.\n\nA: dv3500a's answer has links to the information. Here is an informative video from Gabriel Burt's talk at GUADEC that might give you some information that gives you an overview of some of the things that are nice in Banshee. Here are the slides.\nI was at the session and here are some of the highlights:\n\n\n*\n\n*The ability to change UIs from netbook to \"normal\". (It's handy to have one media player for both form factors)\n\n*A vibrant community of contributors (see the slides for numbers) who is willing to work with us closely.\n\n*An easy way to hack on extensions.\n\n*Follows the GNOME schedule.\n\n*Polished device support, including syncing of playlists to devices.\n\n*Video library support (though this is new and not very polished, maybe we'll hide it for 11.04)\n\n\nBanshee has a bunch of other great features, but these were the ones we mostly discussed at this session. \n\nA: Banshee has more features, and more plugins (Amazon MP3 sotre, ebook , videos...) and it seems to be more user friendly, even if, today, it's often too buggy. Some reasons are in this blueprint of maverick: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-maverick-desktop-application-selection (it has been used for natty discussions too) see in the whiteboard the ==Music Player== part\n\" [davidnielsen 2010-10-22]\nBanshee 1.8.0 no longer depends on HAL, it has excellent integration with Ubuntu specific technologies such as the SoundMenu and Application Indicators. The development pace is nothing short of amazing and the community which has grown around Banshee has proven to be welcoming and swift to fix bugs. Banshee has multiple UIs which suits Ubuntu well for deployment on UNE as well as the desktop. \"\n\nA: The cynic in me says:\nBanshee is a better clone of iTunes than Rhythmbox and given the recent suggestion that Ubuntu 11.04 will have the global menu bar by default, it all makes for a better clone of OSX.\n", "Q: How do I restore sources that are ignored on upgrade? When I upgraded my server to 10.10, some of my sources (basically hudson and git) are now being ignored... any idea how I can get them active again? The entries are in the /etc/apt/sources.list file, but the status line on apt-get update says\nIgn http://hudson-ci.org binary/ Packages\n\nA: Maybe this apt line is no more valid for maverick (10.10) version and it was only available for lucid (10.04).\n\nA: If you are receiving a Hit line after the Ign one all should be OK.\nIgn lines appear because newer versions of apt-get try to get the package list in .bz2 format first. If it fails, it will try to load the old format and report a Hit if it success or and Err if it fails.\n", "Q: USB Full Install damage flash drive? When comparing a full install of a USB flash drive versus simply creating a live USB, is there a significant amount of wear on the USB flash drive when using a full install? When reading around I was informed that having a full install would cause the system to use your USB drive too heavily and wear it out in terms of how many times it can be written and read from. Is this true?\n\nA: Yes, USB drives have a limited number of times they can be written and this is usually very high if used normally, but if you use it as normal hard disk it becomes a bit low. Look for example this test: How Long Does a Flash Drive Last?\nMaybe it will help you understand better.\n\nA: I have been following this question for several years and have never heard of anyone bricking a decent flash drive running Ubuntu from it.\nA decent flash drive is good for a minimum 10000 writes and uses wear leveling, at 10 MB/s this works out to:\n16 GB x 10000 / 10MB/s = 111 forty hour work weeks.\nThis figures writing to the device forty hours per week.\nTypically Ubuntu only writes to disk a small portion of the time.\n", "Q: Synaptic remove \"gedit\" wants to remove \"ubuntu-desktop\". How can I reinstall \"gedit\"? I want to make a clean start with gedit; ie. remove all customization.  \nSynaptic Package Manager, indicated that ubuntu-desktop would also be removed! \nWell, that sounded to be a bit on the dramatic side, so I tested it in a VM..  \nIt was dramatic!...  I lost my Ubuntu Deskop!  (...funny about that!)   \nOkay, my potential disaster was averted thanks to VMs, \nbut I still want to fully uninstall and reinstall a fresh instance of gedit.  \nHow can I do this?\n\nA: If you want to remove all customisation then reinstalling Gedit would not help at all. All of your Gedit settings are stored in your home directory with gconf so after reinstalling Gedit all of your settings would remain the same. To remove your settings you could remove the directory ~/.gconf/apps/gedit-2. You can find that folder by turning view hidden files on in the file browser.\n\nA: Reinstalling the package wont actually reset its settings. They're stored in your user directory.\nrm -rf ~/.gnome2/gedit/\nrm -rf ~/.gconf/apps/gedit-2/\n\n\nA: You shouldn't lose your desktop by removing ubuntu-desktop, because it is a meta-package that simply allows to easily install all default packages in the Ubuntu Desktop environment. However, it is recommended to install it again before any system upgrades.\nYou can safely remove gedit and ubuntu-desktop, then install ubuntu-desktop again. It will automatically select gedit for installation, because gedit is included in the meta-package.\nAlthough is perfectly safe to do what you want, is usually unnecessary to re-install applications, unless they got corrupted by a power outage or broken update. As @sagarchalise commented, deleting the config files for the application usually solve most problems and if you are looking to reset your customizations, then that is the way to go. Re-installing won't change any personal customization.\n\nNote: after reading your message about losing your desktop, I did a\n  test on a VM, just to make sure\n  nothing has changed since Maverick. I\n  didn't lose my desktop even after\n  rebooting and I was able to install\n  both packages again.\n\n\nA: CODE:\nsudo apt-get --purge --reinstall install gedit\n\nPut that into terminal and type your password.

But since there is no internet connection, I can't download it from the repos. How can I manually download it at a Windows system and install it? A .deb pacakge would be most helpful.\n\nA: To find out what packages you need (and the URLs for them), you can use the --print-uris argument to apt-get. For example:\napt-get install -y -d --print-uris ca-certificates\n\nThat will list everything you need to download manually on the Windows system. If you want to make it really easy, you could even generate an HTML file with the links that you could load on the Windows machines:\necho \"<html><body><ul>\" > /tmp/debs.html\napt-get install -y -d --print-uris ca-certificates | grep ^\"'\" | cut -d\"'\" -f2 | awk '{print \" <li><a href=\\\"\" $0 \"\\\">\" $0 \"</a></li>\"}' >> /tmp/debs.html\necho \"</ul></body></html>\" >> /tmp/debs.html\n\nJust access file:///path/to/debs.html once it is on the Windows machine, and you can download all the required packages.\n\nA: You can use the Ubuntu Packages Search page.\nYou then choose your version of Ubuntu. For Maverick, you would find the package you need at http://packages.ubuntu.com/maverick/ca-certificates.

It was announced in another question that the desktop version of Unity will keep the global menu by default. Here are the facts:\n\n\n*\n\n*The global menu was introduced into UNE to save vertical screen space because at Netbook resolutions the vertical space is limited.\n\n*On a modern desktop with a high resolution, there is ample vertical space making this unnecessary \n\n*On the announcement of UNE global menus, Mark Shuttleworth himself said the following:\n\n\n\"There are outstanding questions about the usability of a panel-hosted menu on much larger screens, where the window and the menu could be very far apart.\"\nThe benefits of a global menu don't seem to carry across to a high-resolution desktop and instead seem to bring draw backs (increased mouse travel, large distance between the menu and its associated window).\nThe other worrying factor is that applications seem to be moving away from having a menu bar, and instead of innovating on this and defining new guidelines for moving away from the menu, we are giving it prime place right at the top of the desktop. If applications continue moving away from the desktop we will have an inconsistent experience concerning where to locate application related options/tools depending on which app you are using (e.g. Chrome).\nFinally, the current global menu bar implementation doesn't work for all apps, and doesn't even work for all apps in the default install. This means that the default desktop implementation will be inconsistent.\nSo, there are a bunch of reasons why moving to a global menu is a bad idea, so we need some pretty convincing arguments for why it is a good idea.\nWhat are the reasons for the global menu implementation in the desktop version of Unity?\n\nA: On the one hand, we are making menu's \"bigger\" and \"easier to hit\" by using the edge of the screen, as noted in the first answer. On the other, we will actually deprioritise them, by using the panel primarily to show the application name (or window title) and only showing the menu when you mouse towards the panel, or use accelerator keys related to the menu. In that way, we're leading the trend of making menus less central to UI.\nTed Gould blogged some research he did on the use of menu's. Informally, his findings support the idea that menu placement is less an issue as we use them less than we tend to think we do.\nThis was an important question for us and one we believe is settled in a way that's supported by research. We supported the original pitch to make the global menu a feature of GNOME, which was unfortunately rejected.\n\nA: First, one of the same reasons Mac OS has always used a global menu applies equally here. One of the key principles -- tautologies, really -- in UI design is that \"bigger\" things are easier to \"hit\" with a mouse.\nWhat is less obvious until one thinks about it, is that things on the edges of the screen have infinite height or width (depending on whether they're on a horizontal or vertical edge).\nBy keeping a menu at the top of the screen, the user only has to \"aim\" horizontally -- vertically, they need only \"throw\" the cursor to the top of the screen.\nSecond, the idea that \"Desktop\" Unity doesn't need to conserve vertical space is just silly. In recent years, I've used wide-screen 17\" laptops with 1920x1200 displays, often with an additional external monitor of the same resolution, and I find myself wishing for more vertical space all the time.\nScreen real estate is always at a premium -- not just on netbooks.\nFinally, with regard to the remark about usability issues with the distance between the menu and application windows on large screens, I'm not at all certain where that's coming from. Mac OS has been getting along just fine for years, including as my primary desktop environment. There are undeniably implementation issues with the global menu's actual functionality with some apps, and inconsistent or poor design practices have certainly led to some applications relying overly much on menu bars, or laying their menu bars out in strange ways, but these are not fundamental problems with the global menu paradigm.\n\nA: In the argument that the window is far apart from the window, for people who keep their windows maximised, that wouldn't matter.  The more windows you have open, it seems like a little more room is wasted when not using global menus, which is why I like Mac OS's design choice.\nAlso, I don't think many people are going to be dragging their windows to the bottom of the screen, or even halfway down the screen.  I assume they would hold it at the top and resize the bottom boarders to see as much as they could within the window.\nIt's not just a matter of effectiveness.  It's a design choice.  It's nice to see someone other than Apple adapting global menus.\nTake your time to try out and enjoy the design choice before making an assumption that it will not work for anybody.\n\nA: Conserving desktop real-estate is a null argument.  If the aim is to maximise usable desktop space, why allow users to resize application windows?  Why allow them to change screen resolution?  Why allow them to change the size of icons on the launcher?  Why allow them to change anything?  If the designers know best what the user really wants then any change a user makes must necessarily be a change for the worse.\nThe placing of the application menu window is just as much a matter for user preference as resizing a window. Why not make menu placing as easy for the user to manage as it is for them to resize a window?\nThe Cross Dash and Box icons for closing, minimising and maximising windows change their position depending on whether or not an application is windowed or maximised.  Why not add a fourth icon (Stripes, perhaps) for advanced window options?  With the addition of this menu a user could choose their preferred placing for menu items for each window.\n", "Q: Can I switch between Gnome Desktop and Unity? I remember in ubuntu jaunty I tried to use ubuntu net-book remix. it worked and it looked so great, but I had no way to return to Gnome Desktop.\nthen I decided to remove ubuntu net-book remix but the title-bar disappear on maximized windows.\nwill it happen on unity?\n\nA: If I correctly understood an old question I did, yes you will be able to do it. Just like now you're able to select NBR or Gnome session when you login, with Ubuntu 11.04 you'll be able to select a Gnome session at login. The only difference is that Unity will be selected by default.\n", "Q: How to auto mount my external hard drive? On login, ubuntu 10.10 would not mount external hard drives automatically, While ubuntu 10.04 mount them on login.\nI've tried Storage Device Manager but it give error when external hard is not plugged.\nany idea or suggestion?\n\nA: This is the GUI way of doing it so you don't have to modify your fstab file manually.\nIf you look in the repositories you should see a program called mountmanager \n or from the terminal (command line) just type:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install mountmanager\n\nOnce it is installed you can open it by clicking System->Administration->Mount Manager from the menus.\nNote: this program is currently supported till 12.10. It isn't yet available for 13.04.  \nOnce the program is open you can click the extra drive you want to automount from the list on the left.  In the options you have a area where you can pick the mount point. In my case I wanted my external drive to be mounted at /media/drive/ so I created a directory there and set it as the mount point. Then I clicked partition->apply from the mount manager menus.  \nHere it stated it would be modifying my fstab file but I clicked okay.  Rebooted my machine and everything was good it was auto-mounted there.\n\nA: I had this problem and it turned out to be that the device had changed for the drive and it was conflicting with the root drive.  After the error the boot process stopped and queried me to type S to skip and continue or M to bring up a shell and do a manual fix.\nTyping M and then mount -a resulted in a message that the device was already mounted as / which was not true.  This was the hint that it was confused.\nIt is apparently safer to us UUIDs in the fstab than to use device labels as this avoids such conflicts.  You can type \"blkid\" to find the device to UUID mapping and also see if the device has changed from what you had in the table.\nThe mountmanager utility allows you to specify labels or UUIDs , so this can be of help if you want to automatically generate the fstab from a GUI.\n\nA: Basically ubuntu should automount your external harddrive. If it doesnot mount then you can enter the information on /etc/fstab. See here for mounting information. \n\nA: Install ntfs-config from the package manager and click on auto configure on first start.\n\n\nA: Editing fstab is really the best way to go.  It is really not a hard as it first appears. Just cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.orig and make sure that you have a live cd/usb handy in case you really mess up.\nYou could also try a script using gvfs-mount, and load it at startup.  It is in the package gvfs-bin if it is not installed by default.  The syntax is pretty straight forward.\n\nA: I'm in a similar situation, except that my system worked just fine with 10.04. I have an external mybook hard drive that I use for backup using nfs4 and grsync. At the end of fstab I have these mount commands:\n/media/mybook/laptop_backup /export/laptop_backup none bind 0 0\n/media/mybook/laptop_D610 /export/laptop_D610 none bind 0 0\n/media/mybook/laptop_www /export/laptop_www none bind 0 0\n\nIn 10.04, boot completed with these directories mounted and accessible over the network. When I upgraded to 10.10, the boot pauses with an error message regarding each one giving me the option to press S to skip or some other letter to manually fix the problem. Since I don't know how to fix it, I just skip (once for each directory) and boot completes. Manually executing sudo mount -a succeeds in mounting the directories. I guess the timing changed from 10.04 to 10.10 or something.\nNote that there is no mount command for the mybook external USB 1 TB hard drive in /etc/fstab. So I guess the drive automounted in 10.04 and that's not happening in 10.10. I tried adding:\n /dev/sdd1 /media/mybook type ext3\n\nBut that failed in the same way that mounting the directories did.\nAdding the nobootwait option fixed it. Oddly, it looks like nobootwait apparently causes the system to wait until the mount is completed, even though the man page says the opposite. Here's the commands from /etc/fstab: \n/dev/sdd1 /media/mybook ext3 nobootwait \n/media/mybook/laptop_backup /export/laptop_backup none bind 0 0 \n/media/mybook/laptop_D610 /export/laptop_D610 none bind 0 0 \n/media/mybook/laptop_www /export/laptop_www none bind 0 0 –\n\n\nA: This has worked for me:\nOpen the configuration editor and set up\n/apps/nautilus/preferences/\n    media_automount = true\n    media_automount_open = true\n\nThen install usbmount:\nsudo apt-get install usbmount\n\n\nA: Comparing different versions of Ubuntu does not work for me. There are always changes and if you upgrade then you accept change. Implicit in such comparisons is that the previous one worked, so the latest must not be as good. In the case of devices, it could be due to many reasons including enhanced security using Apparmor. This could be due to changes at any level including the kernel and may not be due to something Canonical had done.\nIn my experience, how things mount depends on the file system. If it is FAT32 or NTFS then it usually mounts devices as you attach them. If it is a device that is formatted under Linux then it may have additional permissions that require you to give your password.\nI have used K/Ubuntu since 2006 and have not had to edit fstab for the past three years. I have at present four external drives attached with at least a dozen partitions of all different file systems and everything works as expected. One is a brand new Seagate that I did not have to do anything to. i just plugged it in and attached it. If something does not mount there is usually a good reason for it. \nIt could be that it need a consistency check because it was not removed properly or it has been mounted many times without one. It could be that the device is not connected properly or something such as VirtualBox is using it. It could be that the device has a problem which could be easy to fix or complex. I have several usb sticks. Some work well and others have problems. I have had to throw a couple away over the years while others have had to be re-formatted to get them to work due to something that has happening in use, such as being impatient and removing it too soon or a flag set to make it bootable.\nIt is hard to generalise based on limited information.\n\nA: You have to add a line in /etc/fstab with the option \"auto\" at the end. I'm not at home, else I would copy-paste you my line... I've Ubuntu 10.10 and an external USB hard disk.\n", "Q: Font rendering (antialiasing) settings The default X11 font rendering settings have changed considerably since Hardy: Karmic and Lucid render fonts very differently -- it seems that more subpixel hinting and antialiasing gets applied. Is it possible to get the old settings back? (The new default hurts my eyes, and have a strong negative impact on my productivity.)\nIn System / Preferences / Appearance / Fonts, I have all fonts set to Arial. I have Arial installed on both my Hardy and Lucid machines. Smoothing is set to Grayscale, Hinting is set to Full, Subpixel Order is set to RGB.\nA visual illustration of <span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:13px\">Peter, <b>Peter</b>,</span>:\n\n\n*\n\n*: hardy_gray_good\n\n*: lucid_gray_bad\n\n*: lucid_subpixel_bad\n\n\nHardy renders the HTML fragment above as hardy_gray_good above, and I'd like to get the same on Lucid -- but Lucid can only render it as lucid_gray_bad or lucid_subpixel_bad (depending on my font rendering settings in System / Preferences / Appearance / Fonts / Details / Smoothing. How do I get hardy_gray_good on Lucid?\nSee http://dl.dropbox.com/u/635918/fontrender/fontrender.html for all the sample images and their zoomed counterparts.\nI'm not asking which font I should use. In this question I'm interested in fixing the rendering for all fonts, with the existing renderings (lucid_gray_bad and lucid_subpixel_bad) and the desired rendering (hardy_gray_good) illustrated for Arial at 13px.\nI'm not asking which of the 3 variants above are more readable -- for me, hardy_gray_good is much more readable than the 2 others, and I'd like to have it on my Ubuntu Lucid system.\n\nA: I've figured out that the font hinting setting is responsible for the quality difference I perceive. The rendering of hardy_gray_good was done with the medium hinting setting, while the others used the slight hinting setting.\nOne straightforward way to solve my problem is doing all these:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the value of System / Preferences / Appearance / Fonts / Details / Hinting to Medium. Other settings there such as Smoothing doesn't matter much: Subpixel is a great default for LCDs, but Grayscale can be fine too.\n\n*Edit the fontconfig configuration to set the hinting to medium. The simplest way to do this is the following:\ncp -i /etc/fonts/conf.avail/10-hinting-medium.conf ~/.fonts.conf\n\nThis editing has proved to be necessary for Firefox and Chrome, because they ignore the System / Preferences / Appearance / Fonts / Details / Hinting setting.\n\n*Restart applications such as Firefox and Chrome. The simplest way to restart all of them is logging out and back in.\n\nA: Why don't you try the new Ubuntu font? Maybe is more optimized for new settings.\n\nA: I would recommend using ubuntu font as well. You can also try Droid Sans font. Both these look good.\nYou can change the default settings from Appeareance Preferences. The previous defaults AFAIR are slight hinting, RGB and subpixel(LCD) smoothing. \nFull hinting is not always good.\n", "Q: How do I know if a laptop will work with Ubuntu? I want to buy a laptop at some point in the near future, but not knowing beforehand whether it works with Ubuntu makes the whole operation risky and tiresome. I would like to know if there is some kind of official hardware database where I can enter the name of the laptop I'm interested in and see if it's 100% compatible out of the box, or in case it isn't what is it exactly that doesn't work (ideally also if there is a way to fix it).\nDoes Canonical have a project along these lines?\n\nA: This will help you: Ubuntu hardware partners\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*Which computers are guaranteed to work?\n\nA: While I upvoted the idea of trying out a LiveCD or LiveUSBStick, if you can't do it at your favorite store, here are some thoughts...\nYou might check on Craigslist - there are some great deals on year-old laptops, and if you're carrying cash, an individual might be more willing to let you test Ubuntu on it.\nIf you really want to buy new, and you can't test, my experience doing many dozens of Ubuntu installs over the last five years says there are only a few things you're likely to have problems with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Multiple drives in a weird fakeraid configuration - I'm looking at you, Sony. You can prevent this by making sure the laptop only has one hard drive. (For more details, look here and here.)\n\n*Bleeding edge wi-fi or Ethernet controllers; sometimes it takes a while for support for those to make it into the Linux kernel. There are compatibility lists, and in any case, if a laptop's controller chips are from a major manufacturer (e.g. Broadcom, Intel, etc.) and have been out for a year, you should be okay.\n\n*Bleeding edge GPU. Same as for the wi-fi and Ethernet controllers; the manufacturer names are just different.\nI've never had a Ubuntu compatibility problem with a reasonably modern x86 CPU, motherboard, memory, etc. It even ran fine on my creaking old 2000-era HP laptop before I recycled it. So I'd guesstimate that if a laptop passes 1-3, chances are 99+% it will be fine with Ubuntu.\n\nA: This may also help you.\nhttp://www.linux-laptop.net/\n\nA: When I bought mine, I simply brought a live CD in the store, and asked to try it on their laptops. I explained them what this is, and that I want to check the compatibility of the different components with Ubuntu. I sometime had to explain what Ubuntu was...... One place told me a flat NO, that I could  not try it. I ran out of the store as fast as I could. At the store where I actually bought my portable (in Dec. 2006), I tested that the display was actually working on the internal monitor, at the full resolution, as advertised on the spec sheet, that the wireless adapter was found, and that I could use the card reader, with a card I brought in. I finally tested the sound itself, which was rather easy to do.\nToday, you could bring Linux on a USB disk instead, or even an SD card. Also, in 2010, you should expect every sales rep on the floor to be at least know about Linux. Usually, they should understand that starting it from a CD, especially if this is a branded one, not burned at home, there is no harm that will be done on the machine. \nNOTE: The fact that some components are not discovered right at boot from a live CD does not mean that Ubuntu will not support it. Chances are that you will find the proper driver for it.  You will just have some manual setup to do.  \nYou may also want to note the brand names and models from a store and check on the net, with Google. You should usually find either some test cases or message exchange about it that will give you a good idea about the model you are looking for.\n\nA: As it was written in another answer by linuxbuild:\n\nA database of Linux-compatible computers & devices:\nhttps://linux-hardware.org/\nTimeline of tested computers:\nhttps://linux-hardware.org/?view=timeline\nA tool to analyze and count your computer:\nhttps://github.com/linuxhw/hw-probe\n\n\n", "Q: How can I tell whether my Firefox is 32 bit or 64 bit?

(at least Bazaar, i'm not sure about git)\n\n*There is a console plugin. But I usually just open a terminal on another desktop, and have focus follow the mouse. You could also look into stuff like quake. (which ties a dropdown terminal to the ~ key, like in Quake)\n\n*You can connect short-cuts to custom shell scripts, that operate in the 'main' directory. Perfect for common rake tasks.\nPS. If you don't need or want a file pane, you should take a look at Scribes. It's a textmate clone. Pretty much. Very lean, but it does integrate nicely. Supports remote locations, code templates, syntax highlighting. It's only funny quirck is that it saves as you type and it does not have a proper file-pane.\n\nA: MonoDevelop\n\nIt was originally written as an IDE for writing C# (which it is fantastic for) but extensions have been created to extend the editor for other languages.\nExtension languages include:\n\n\n*\n\n*python\n\n*java\n\n*moonlight\n\n*boo\n\n*vala\n\n\nIt's also rumored that a PHP module is being worked on.\nPersonally, I have used it mostly for C# and some python development (I really wish the devs would get to work on the python autocomplete fefature).\nIt also has the ability to integrate plugins for database management, source control, unit testing, etc...\nWhile not a very 'light weight' option, it's definitely worth using.\n\nA: All the above are great editors. I recently found this new light IDE and it is cross-platform compatible as well.\nPyCharm\nIt is package for all the scripting languages. It comes in other versions as well, PHP Storm5 and WebStorm\nThe PHP Storm, contains support for all the languages. Also, the beauty of this editor is that, if you are a student. You can apply for this IDE for free and not just for yourself but for unlimited users for one-year. Also, like Visual Studio it has that intellisense feature, where you get the properties and methods in the drop down.\nI am really having a lot of fun using this editor.\n\nA: Vim \nI think Vim is amazing!\nVim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing. It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems.\nAlthough Vim was originally released for the Amiga, Vim has since been developed to be cross-platform, supporting many other platforms. It is the most popular editor amongst Linux Journal readers.\nVim is free and open source software and is released under a license which includes some charityware clauses, encouraging users who enjoy the software to consider donating to children in Uganda. The license is compatible with the GNU General Public License.\n\n\nA: I really have to add Sublime Text 2 to the list because it's simply amazing. It's the best TextMate alternative for Linux.\nIt has way too many features to write the all here, but to name just a few:\n\n\n*\n\n*a sidebar for projects or files and Chrome-style tabs as well as multi-pane editing which includes horizontal, vertical and even a quad pane mode\n\n*\"Goto Anything\": press Ctrl+P and type something - this will search in both filenames and lines of code across currently open files as well as recently close files. Start your search by using \"#\" to go to that word line, \"@\" for symbol or \":\" for line\n\n*minimap which shows you an an overview of your files\n\n*macros, various find tools (find in files, find in open files, incremental find), easily switch between project, multiple selection, autocomplete and lots more.\n\n\n\n\nA: I can suggest you Komodo Edit. You can find it here: http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit\n\nA: Gedit \nGedit is a simple but useful text editor that supports syntax highlighting for python. It doesn't have many features out of the box, but is very simple to use. It can be extended with plugins. There is a set of plugins that can be installed from the gedit-plugins package.\n\n\nA: I would highly recommend the successor to Sublime Text 2, Sublime Text 3. It is very fast and has support for keyboard shortcuts. You can install lot of plugins to add new functionalities.\nSadly sublime text is not opensource, and paid/nagware. However, there is an opensource project attempting to displace it Lime Text\n\nA: Emacs is a great text editor (plus a lot of other functions) that will serve you well in the long term. It does have a somewhat steep learning curve, but I think you will be well rewarded. Install it with:\nsudo apt-get install emacs\nI would start with the builtin emacs tutorial. It should be easily accessible from the default \"buffer\" that opens. It will get you started and well on your way.\n\nA: DrPython \nDrPython is a python specific IDE written in python and I believe you can even extend it in python. Features include:\n\n*\n\n*Syntax highlighting\n\n*A class browser\n\n*Integrated python debugger\n\n\n\nA: For a simple but powerful text editor I like SciTE. It has a great many language options and is cross-platform. Notepad++ was developed from the SciTE codebase, so it's a good start point if you're migrating from Windows / Notepad++.\n\n\nA: Don't hate me for what I gonna said: netbeans 6.9. (download the \"ruby version\" to avoid other unnesesary stuff to load..)\nyes, you gonna said: but it needs java!! but, if you have +512mb, just try it, and tell me later, it's just an option more :P\n\nA: In the interest of offering another editor option for completeness - check out Eclipse with the Aptana plugin.\nPros\n\n\n*\n\n*It's useful if you already have Eclipse installed and you want to work on Ruby.\n\n*It has all the features you asked for and more (intellisense for example)\n\n*Once you grok the Eclipse interface you can be productive in a wide variety of programming languages and technologies\nCons \n\n\n*\n\n*Eclipse is resource hungry - not for low memory machines. \n\n*The user interface has a learning curve if you are not familiar with Eclipse. \n\nA: My choice is Kate. Is a KDE application, so a bunch of dependencies will also be installed if you are using Gnome.\nkate \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kate3.png\n\nA: Why don't you use eclipse?..  There is an python extension for eclipse.\nFeatures include:\n\n\n\n*Django integration\n\n*Code completion\n\n*Code completion with auto import\n\n*Syntax highlighting\n\n*Code analysis\n\n*Go to definition\n\n*Refactoring\n\n*Mark occurrences\n\n*Debugger\n\n*Remote debugger\n\n*Tokens browser\n\n*Interactive console\n\n*and many others:\n\n\n\nCheck this url: http://pydev.org/manual_101_install.html\n\nA: Vim\none of the classic text-editors, cross-platform, and a fan favorite of programming gurus. A slight learning curve, but once you catch on, and see how powerful it can be you'll never turn back.\n\n\nThere's a bunch of plugins available that'll have you setup in a full-fledged Rails IDE in no time: CLICK HERE \n\nA: Redcar\n\nFound it advertised on StackOverflow. Open source, cross-platform, looks/feels/works like TextMate. It even supports TextMate bundles, and comes with TextMate themes! It has a project file browser, and a bunch of other features. Read the installation instructions and then:\nsudo gem install redcar\nredcar install\n\nNOTE: it's under development\n\nA: Go with Emacs, it has a solid Python mode. You don't need anything too fancy anyway. Instead of using a class browser, it helps to use a web browser or to read through the manual for whatever modules you're using.\n\nA: Nano\nIf you want to familiarize yourself with the Command Line interface (CLI) in the terminal, I would suggest Nano. It is a very flexible and further more it is already pre-installed in the GNOME terminal.\nTo access Nano:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bring up the GNOME terminal.\n\n*Type nano in the terminal.\n\n$ nano \n  \n*Voila, you are in nano!\n  \n\nIt is rather daunting at first but it is useful if you are a system administrator and it will useful in situation where the is no graphical interfaces.\n\n\nA: Scribes \n\nScribes is designed to make you more productive Simple, slim and sleek, yet powerful.\nFeatures include:\n\n*\n\n*Extensible via Python plugins\n\n*Remote editing (ftp, sftp, ssh, samba, webdav, webdavs)\n\n*Snippets! Watch the flash demo.\n\n*Automatic word completion\n\n*Automatic correction and replacement\n\n*Automatic pair character completion and smart insertion\n\n*Automatic indentation\n\n*Powerful text processing and manipulation functions\n\n*Bookmarks and smart navigation\n\n*Document Switcher\n\n*Syntax colors for over 30 languages\n\n*and much more...\n\nInstall\n\nsudo apt-get install scribes\n\nOr The latest version of Scribes can be installed using the following official PPA: -\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mystilleef/scribes-daily\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install scribes\n\n\nA: Bluefish Editor\nFrom the website:\n\nBluefish is a powerful editor targeted towards programmers and webdesigners, with many options to write websites, scripts and programming code. Bluefish supports many programming and markup languages, and it focuses on editing dynamic and interactive websites.\n\nAlso, Scribes (which looks a lot like Mac OS X's Textmate).\n\nA: I also suggest Gedit. Check out gedit-mate for a great \"set of plugins, tools, color schemes and snippets that will improve your work.\"\n\nA: I suggest using jedit. It is one of the few editors that let you display more than one file simultaneously which I find very useful. You can also simultaneously display different parts of the same file. The only other editor that does this is kate but it doesn't seem to work with the more recent versions of ubuntu.  \n\nA: For cross platform python editing you can use SPE \n(However, Kate, Sublime2, and Geany with snippets are fantastic)\n\nsudo apt-get install spe\n\n\nA: The official python website traks  python editors as well as IDEs. Check there for the latest support!\nhttp://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors\n", "Q: Using same HDD on multiple laptops as boot drive I have a hdd with ubuntu (Lucid Lynx) that I use on my samsung laptop. Can I use the same HDD as main (boot drive) on another laptop (HP)? Will it automatically install drivers? Do they override? Is it possible, that it will break my existing setup with overriding my drivers so I can't use it later on my samsung?\n\nA: Ubuntu is much better in this aspect than Windows. Ubuntu kernel already contains all modules (drivers). So your second laptop must boot correctly. The only exception is proprietary video drivers, I don't recommend install them on second laptop. Open drivers must work out-of-box (but maybe without advanced 3D).\n", "Q: Need wired/wireless atheros driver for AR9285 and AR8152 How can I install atheros drivers to my Toshiba laptop (64bit), manually?\nI need AR9285 wireless adapter, and AR8152(v1.1) wired, fast ethernet.\nI cannot connect my UberStudent1.0 (linux OS, Ubuntu10.04,equiv.) to the net. I have on the laptop Mint8 which connects well and able to download any drivers. Please, would you kindly show me how to install them if they are not .deb formats. Tarballs, zip,etc, still give me a hard time to work with.\n\nA: You might need to install additional wireless drivers, this can be difficult without a network connection. \nI recommend downloading the AMD64 .deb directly from this page and then copy them onto a USB key or CD-R and back onto your laptop. Then install it by double clicking on it and following the instructions in the Software Center, then you'll probably need to reboot. Your wireless card should work at that point.\nAfter that install linux-backports-modules-wireless-maverick-generic so that you'll have that package installed so you'll get upgrades.\nsudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-wireless-maverick-generic\n\n\nA: check this for wireless driver! I had the same problem before and I've found the solution!\n for install drivers you can simply go to System > Administration > Additional Drivers, ubuntu will detect drivers you need\n", "Q: How do I automatically obscure my face when using video chat? I want to use Empathy, Skype, etc for video chat, but I want to have my face automatically detected and obscured in the video stream. What can I do to make that happen? I don't want to turn off video or just use a static image.\n\nA: I don't think that it is practical to do any kind of real-time face-hiding like this. The algorithm that you use would have to accurately detect and hide your face perfectly in every single frame of video. If it fails to hide your face for even a single frame, then you've failed, and the other person has a picture of your face.\nThe problem is that because of the real-time requirement, you can't review the video and fill anything that was missed by the automatic face-hiding algorithm. You have to be able to trust this algorithm to get it right on its own every single time. I don't see how you can do that.\nSo yeah, I vote for Oli's paper bag. It reminds me of the (apocryphal but illustrative) story of American and Russian responses to discovering that pens don't work in space. The Americans invented a pen that does write in space (the pressurized ball-point pen), while the Russians switched to pencils.\n\nA: A paper bag?\nI won't dwell on this too long but you want to video chat but not be seen? Seems a little odd and a little suspicious but anyway.\nI don't think anything like what you want really exists but there are separate projects that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do face detection and overlays in that space (OpenCV)\n\n*A fake-webcam driver to turn a video source back into something that looks like a webcam to the system and therefore Empathy/Skype/ChatRoulette/etc (WebcamStudio)\n\n\nLet's be clear, you're going to have to do a little bit of work here. It's not going to be a clean solution either. But if you want it, you can do it.\n\nA: Webcamstudio has basic face detection but you can also use it to place an image anywhere on the screen. I'll go through both. I'll be using Ubuntu 10.10 with webcamstudio_0.57alpha2_all.deb available from their Google Code website\nIf you haven't done already follow the instructions for adding yourself to the video group as described here\nOnce installed open up webcam studio. You should have something like this\n\nOn the left-hand side, under Devices double-click on your webcam device. Click on Apply to get turn on your webcam in the software\n\nFrom here we have two options for obscuring your face. The first is to place an image over the screen. In the left-hand panel under Animations click on the waving hand\n\nYour screen should look something like this. Click on Play to apply the waving hand\n\nIf you want to try face detection, instead of adding the hand click on the webcam device and then in the Face Detection tab tick the checkbox and choose a face to use.\n\nTo see this in action open up a program that uses the webcam. For this example I'm using Cheese. In Cheese go to Edit > Preferences and change the webcam to the WebcamStudio Video Device\n\nHere is the waving hand in action\n\nAnd here's face detection in action\n\nAs you can see it doesn't work very well. I've asked on their mailing list for help on this matter but the response is that it's not very reliable and depends on lighting conditions and the quality of the camera.\nThere are other ways to obscure a video stream within that program but that's for another tutorial.\n\nA: there is software to do this, lookup opencv, im 90% sure it can do what you want. not sure if its able to be implemented yet, without doing your own programming.\n", "Q: Print terminal output in gedit automatically? the command\ntime ./myprog \n\ndisplays the time it took to run myprog on the screen. Now i would like to write this information to a text file.\nHow?\n\nA: Without a path time is the shell built-in, and its output does not get redirected. Instead, you can use the time program, in /usr/bin/time which will write to stderr:\n/usr/bin/time -p ./myprog 2> timing.txt && gedit timing.txt\n\nI added -p so the output is similar to the output of the time built-in.\n\nA: Edit: I should have tested this!\nKees is very correct. time is a shell builtin in most cases so its output doesn't flow through STDOUT like other programs would normally. You can use the command version sitting in but to save having two identical answers (or me deleting mine), here's another way to capture things that don't output in a traditional way.\nbash -c \"time ./myprog\" 2>&1 > file.txt\n\nSame principals as before exist. If you want gedit to load after this, wump on && gedit file.txt, if you want it to append, change > for >>.\nIf your command is very noisy and you just want the times, you could run the output through tail:\nbash -c \"time ./myprog\" 2>&1 | tail -3 > file.txt && gedit file.txt\n\n\nOld answer\nTo just save it to a file just do this:\ntime ./myprog > file.txt\n\nYou don't need the .txt extension but it might help you. If you want to append to the file (instead of replacing it), swap the > for >>.\nIf you want this showing up in gedit specifically, you need to save it to a file and then open it in gedit. I can't see a way of piping the text directly into gedit without saving it first.\ntime ./myprog > file.txt && gedit file.txt\n\n", "Q: Sharing files with a dd-wrt router I plan to buy a new wifi router with the intention of installing dd-wrt right away. One of the features I plan to use is attaching a USB harddrive to the router and using it to backup (using rsync) my laptop and desktop. \nAs far as I can google, dd-wrt shares files through SAMBA. I know it's not the prefered option for Ubuntu users and we would prefer NFS, but does anyone know how bad or good it is this setup? \nDoes anyone here use dd-wrt as a file server succesfully?\n\nA: If you just want to rsync to it, you can run it over ssh.\nYou can also browse files over SSH, even mount it permanently. For just moving files around, it's a bit slower and resource intensive than plain samba or NFS but for running rsyncd, it should be fine.\nNFS isn't compiled into the dd-wrt kernel so if you want to use it, you need to use the userspace version which is somewhat slower.\nRouters don't tend to be the best fileservers. They have a great networking stack but the interface between the router and the drive is pretty slow. On top of that CPU overhead that wouldn't be noticed on a proper server can cause a little router quite a lot of stress.\nThere are also possible security ramifications of running a precious service like a fileserver on something with a direct connection to the wild.\nA NAS (Network Attached Storage) device would probably give you better performance and not cost all that much. A lot of the QNAP devices are multi-protocol aware and perform quite well.\n\nA: I have an Asus WL-520GU router with Tomatousb 1.28.  I have a 2TB drive attached to it through the USB port.  I set the router up for \"yes, authentication required\" in filesharing and put in a username and password.  I used Tomato because I read that it had better USB support - no idea if that is true.\nOn my computer I have Maverick installed.\nI put the following line in my fstab file:\n//192.168.1.1/share /MountPoint     cifs    rw,nosuid,nodev,default_permissions,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=002,username=unamefromrouter,password=pwfromrouter\nThis lets the main user create/delete and all others read.  Not totally sure what packages I had to install to make cifs available (smbclient maybe?).  I use luckybackup to backup to it by just pointing to the MountPoint folder.  It works pretty good except sometimes it will gag if I try to watch a movie while running a backup.  I can actually play movie iso files directly from it with VLC(but occasional stutter if using wireless).\n", "Q: Add a string to a text file from terminal I would like to modify a bunch of text files from the terminal, more precisey:\nadd the string '50' to the first line of every text file in /mydat/ ?\nAlternatively, if you know of a link to a page on the web that lists commands to manipulate text files from the shell...\n\nA: find and sed are your weapons of choice:\nfind /mydat/ -exec sed '1i 50' {} \\;\n\nThat will stick 50 followed by a new line on the beginning of the file.\nAlternatively if you don't need recursion or complex selectors for find you can drop find completely:\nsed '1i 50' *\n\n\nA: To edit a file, you need an editor. ed and ex are examples of command based editors, which is useful for editing files from a script. Here's an example inserting a line to every file with .txt extension in /mydata, using ed:\n#!/bin/bash\nfor file in /mydata/*.txt; do\n    printf '%s\\n' 0a 50 . w | ed -s \"$file\"\ndone\n\nThat'll handle all kinds of odd characters in the filenames too, unlike all the examples using for-loops with ls in the answers given so far.\nHere's a link describing how to use ed: http://bash-hackers.org/wiki/doku.php?id=howto:edit-ed\nFor getting to grips with bash, I strongly recommend reading http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide\n\nA: Essentially you need to loop through every text file in a directory, then add a small string to the start.  It's not hard when you break it down into two steps.\nTo add the string to the beginning of a file, the format would be this:\necho \"50 $( cat file.txt )\" > file.txt\n\nIf you get a cannot overwrite existing file error, you need to disable noclobber\nset +o noclobber\n\nNow you just need to drop that in a loop that loops through the files you want to alter.\nfor FILE in $( ls /mydata/ | grep txt$ ) ; do\n  echo \"${FILE}\"\ndone\n\nIf that outputs all the files you want to alter correctly, add in the command to alter the files (as below).  If not, alter the grep statement until it matches what you need.\nfor FILE in $( ls /mydata/ | grep txt$ ) ; do\n  echo \"50 $( cat ${FILE} )\" > \"${FILE}\"\ndone\n\nAnd if you want it done in one line: \nfor FILE in $( ls /mydata/ | grep txt$ ) ; do echo \"50 $( cat ${FILE} )\" > \"${FILE}\"; done\n\nEdit\nIf you want the 50 on its own line, use printf along with \\n instead of echo, as below.\nfor FILE in $( ls /mydata/ | grep txt$ ) ; do printf \"50\\n$( cat ${FILE} )\" > \"${FILE}\"; done\n\n\nA: Since you asked, commandlinefu.com lists a bunch of commands and tricks for use in the shell, and it has lots of stuff about text-file manipulation. \n\nA: It's relatively straightforward to add text to the end of files. For BASH: echo 50 >> file.txt will append 50 to the end of of file.txt. Wrap that up in a for loop like so: for $FILE in 'ls' do echo 50 >> $FILE; done;for $FILE in * do echo 50 >> $FILE; done;  will iterate over all the files in the current directory appending 50 to the end. Note that the single quotes are actually `, but that's the indicator for code markup here... blech. To add it to the top of each file, create a temporary file and echo 50 into it, then echo the contents of the file after that. Then rename the file to overwrite the original. Wrap it up in a script and you're set!\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho \"Adding 50 to each file in current directory.\"\n\nfor $FILE in *\ndo\n[[ -f \"$i\" ]] || continue\necho \"50\" >> tmp\ncat \"$FILE\" >> tmp\nmv tmp \"$FILE\"\ndone\n\nThat should work, but run it on a test directory before anything important.\nEdit: Updated the script as suggested in Mahesh's comment.\n", "Q: Disable \"Google Mail all mail\" folders in Evolution My gmail account is properly set up and shows a list of folders, Inbox, Drafts, etc. But it has an additional folder all [Google Mail] and in it I can see All Mail, Spam, etc. I want to disable it and disable the subscription to it so that it doesn't appear in the interface at all.\n\n\nA: You can disable certain IMAP folders in GMail, including the All Mail folder, if you enable the Google Labs \"Advanced IMAP Controls\".  From webmail:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > Labs and set \"Advanced IMAP Controls\" to \"Enable\"\n\n*Once advanced IMAP controls are enabled, you can go to Settings > Labels and uncheck the \"Show in IMAP\" box next to the folders you want to get rid of (All Mail, Spam, etc.).\n\n*Go back to Evolution and refresh the account, and the folders you unchecked will be gone.\n\n\nBe warned that you lose functionality if you disable some of those folders, though.

You can also use it to create a custom Ubuntu distribution. It has a CLI and a GUI, so take your pick. In the GUI, choose the first option, Backup.\n\nTo install it,open Software center Then Edit -> Software Sources -> Other software (Tab) and click add and paste\ndeb http://www.geekconnection.org/remastersys/repository karmic/\n\nNow close the software sources window and wait for repos to be refreshed and install remastersys.\n\nA: My preferred method is to use a CloneZilla live CD. Download the .iso, burn it to disk with Brasero, put it into the machine you want to image, reboot, attach the destination drive, and follow the prompts. Be cautious when using dd, it's a very low level tool and mistakes can destroy data easily. If you want to make a byte-for-byte copy of an image, select CloneZilla's partition-to-partition option.\n\nA: Use dd (replace sda1 with the partition you want to save):\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/home/user/backup.img\n\nThis will make a mountable image of a partition.\nJust be aware that this could take a while, and the image will have the size of the partition, not the files on it. In your case this would be 80GB. If you compress the image it should be about the size of the used space of your hdd.\nRefer to DriveImaging: Creating Disc Images Using dd for a more comprehensive explanation.\n\nA: The simplest method is to use dd but the common complaint is that dd gives no progress bar when copying a large disk.  You can use pipe viewer (pv) in conjunction with dd to show a progress bar and the ETA to completion.  Install pv with \nsudo apt-get install pv\n\nThe drive that you are copying does not need to be mounted, and if you are recovering data from a damaged drive it is a good idea if it is not mount in read/write mode.  Anything you do to the drive has the potential to overwrite deleted data or to cause further damage to the file system.  The point of making a bit copy at this point is to enable recovery without putting the data at further risk.\nTwo things you will need to know before proceeding are the device name of the drive you are copying and its real size.  Both of these can be found by issuing the command \nsudo fdisk -l\n\nwhich will display the drives attached to the system and their size in MiB.\nIn its simplest for the command for copying the disk to the file rescue.dd in the current directory is:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sdx of=rescue.dd\n\nwhere /dev/sdx will need to be changed to the actual device name that you are copying.  You may need to change the ownership of rescue.dd since it will be owned by root.\nTo get a handy progress bar and the ETA to completion, pipe the dd command through pv:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sdX | pv -s 99999m -bpae | dd of=rescue.dd \n\nwhere /dev/sdX is the device name of the drive you want to copy and 99999 is the size of the device in MiB (not MB).  Your user will own the file rescue.dd since the second invocation of dd which writes the output file is owned by your user, not root.  Data display will be average data rate, a progress bar, %completed, and ETA to completion.\n\nA: If you want to see progress, and also don't mind the command line, PV is your friend.  I'm trying out Ubuntu MATE on my Raspberry Pi 2, and I wanted to backup my SD card and write the new one, but I hate running a big IO without knowing what's going on.  This is what worked most quickly:\n$ sudo su\n# pv /dev/sdb | xz > my-pi.img.xz\n# pv ubuntu-mate-15.04-desktop-armhf-raspberry-pi-2.img.bz2 | bzip2 -d > /dev/sdb\n\nRestoring was just as easy\n# pv my-pi.img.xz | xz -d > /dev/sdb\n\nIn all cases what's going on is pv is taking the input file/device and spamming it to stdout, while providing a progress report to stderr.  Then, xz or bzip2 is taking stdin from the pipe (the stdout of the previous command) and acting as a filter.  The output redirect lays the file out to the device or image file.\nI don't know that it's operating with blocks at all, but I suspect Linux is doing all my buffering for me, and reading/writing data by the block at the hardware level.  \nIn that vein, is there a big advantage to using dd?  I can see if we were reading or writing specific parts of a disk (e.g., if you want to extract a partition from an image, having ripped the endpoints off fdisk or parted), but for spamming a whole disk, I really prefer the simpler command.\n", "Q: How can I enable the \"Share Desktop\" feature in Empathy? What steps do I need to follow if I want to use the Share Desktop feature with another user in Empathy?\nI've already enabled the Remote Desktop option through System -> Preferences -> Remote Desktop and checked the service for this task is up, so I can't get what else I'd need.\nBy the way, I've tried using this feature with contacts using Empathy too. \n\nA: There is currently only one protocol-implementation in Telepathy (the library on which Empathy is built) that supports this: “gabble”, which implements XMPP (Jabber).  Other protocols or other implementations of the XMPP-protocol, including local-XMPP (“People Nearby”), don't support it (yet).\nSo IF both you and the other person use XMPP with the Gabble plugin (the “Jabber” option in the Accounts dialog), it should work out of the box like Jorge explains.\nFortunately, it's easy & quick to set up a Jabber account; there are hundreds of servers that allow you to register an account from inside Empathy, or you can use your existing google account.\n\nA: Desktop sharing works with googletalk and Empathy on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS if you install vinagre...\n$ sudo apt-get install vinagre\n\n\nA: This works in 11.04, 11.10 and 12.04 - however, the fix for 12.04 isn't in the main repositories yet, it should be there by the end of May however.\nThe \"Share Desktop\" feature of Empathy uses vino as a VNC server and vinagre as a VNC client by default. The feature also seems to be supported only with Jabber/XMPP protocol. I tested this on Ubuntu 12.04.1 (updated on October 2012) both 32 and 64 bit. \"Share Desktop\" works after installing the vinagre package (vino was there by default) and using a Jabber account.\nYou typically do not need to set up the share desktop feature before you use it. All you need is to make sure that the person on the other end is using Empathy an has \"vinagre-preferences\" running. Simply right click on the person's name and select \"Share My Desktop...\"\n\nYou'll get this message while the other person gets a prompt.\n\nThe other person will see something like this:\n\nWhen you're done there will be a final message to make sure the person is disconnected:\n\nIf the menu entry is grayed out it means that either the other person doesn't have support for it or you might be using a protocol that doesn't support the feature.\n", "Q: Mount a directory to look like a drive Is it possible to mount a directory, either an ext# local one, or one in a /media mounted windows drive, so it is seen as a mounted drive itself?\n\nA: If you mount a folder using a transparent fusefs system, gnome will pick it up and show it as a drive. You'll loose some overhead in the calls, but not much for a fast machine.\nYou could also make a gvfs system that mounts a folder, or a localhost ftp, ssh or other type of mount. That will show as a drive too.\n\nA: If you only want quick access to a certain directory in Nautilus and the file dialogs, you can also use a bookmark of course...\nAnyway, there is a FUSE filesystem named bindfs (`sudo apt-get install bindfs) that probably does exactly what you want.  For example the following:\nbindfs -n /media/USB-HDD-01/ISO/ /home/johnc/ISO-images\n\nwould result in ISO-images to show up as a mounted filesystem in the Places sidepanel in Nautilus.  The -n is required because otherwise bindfs tries to use the allow_other FUSE option, which by default is not allowed for regular users (if you use bindfs in /etc/fstab this is not a problem).\nThe first directory you give is the existing one, the second directory you give is an empty directory under which the contents of the existing one will appear.\nTo unmount, use:\nfusermount -u /home/johnc/ISO-images\n\n\nPS: Nautilus (the file manager) will show mountable/mounted filesystems, not drives, but I assume that's what you were looking for.\n", "Q: How can I physically identify a single drive in a RAID array? I have an external drive bay with 4 eSATA disks in it. My system has a 4-port eSATA card, as well as a pair of internal hardware RAID1 drives. The external drives are in software RAID1 pairs as /dev/md0 and /dev/md1. Both have been configured as LVM physical volumes to create my storagevg LVM volume group. Recently, a single drive went offline (I suspect cables), but there does not seem to be a good way to physically identify which drive I need to check, especially since initialization order isn't the same between boots. How can I find the disk needing attention?\n\nA: If you have trouble matching the drive serial number or port indication with your disks' spatial locations, you can run cat /dev/sdz >/dev/null (where sdz is the failed drive) and locate the drive by its LED (or by ear if you aren't in a noisy server room). If the drive won't even power up, that should be enough to tell which one it is. Be sure to put a visible label on the disks for next time.\n\nA: The info that udisks gives (either on the commandline or in the GNOME Disk Utility) includes the disk serial number.  On the disks I have, the serial number is printed on the upper side and on the front side (the one on the other side of the one that contains the connectors), both as numbers and with a barcode.  Unfortunately, most PC cases make it impossible to read those serials without pulling the disk out...\nYou can also find the serial numbers in /dev/disk/by-id/.\nAs your disk is off-line, I assume it isn't \"seen\" by the kernel currently?  In that case, you might have to go by elimination: you want the disk with a serial number that is not listed...\n\nA: With software raid this is a common issue.  Hardware raids tend to have a feature that allows you to blink the LED associated with a drive, assuming that your hardware supports that.\nBut with software RAID each drive has some unique metadata.  Which you can read it from each drive using the command mdadm -E /dev/sda1 for each drive in the the array, modifying the devices to match your environment.  So if you have a situation where a drive is giving you problems and is currently offline.  I would run this on each drive that is online, recording the minor number for each drive.  Then using a Live CD that supports MD, system rescue cd is a good one, with only one drive at a time connected and running this command to find the culprit.  This probably isn't as straight forward as you'd like but it should work.\n\nA: Disk Utility (sitting in System -> Administration) will give you the serial numbers for all your disks.\nHere's what I see (look at the top-right for the serial). You'll notice that this drive is within a mdadm RAID array. Disk Utility can penetrate the array for raw disk access.\n\nI have 6 of the same model of disk in my PC so I drew a little diagram showing their  position in the case and the serial number so I can locate them quickly on serial in an emergency.\nThe opposite is also true in that if a disk dies, I just need to find which disks are showing up and I can eliminate them until I know which serial is missing.\nEdit: I'm trying to improve my bash-fu so I wrote this command line version to just give you a list of disk serial numbers that are current in your machine. fdisk may chuck out some errors but that doesn't taint the list:\nfor disk in `sudo fdisk -l | grep -Eo '(/dev/[sh]d[a-z]):' | sed -E 's/://'`;\ndo\n    sudo hdparm -i $disk | grep -Eo 'SerialNo=.*' | sed -E 's/SerialNo=//';\ndone\n\n(And you can crumble that into one line if you need to - I've broken it up for readability)\nEdit 2: ls /dev/disk/by-id/ is somewhat easier ;)\n\nA: lsscsi\n\n$ lsscsi -l\n[0:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      TOSHIBA THNS128G AGLA  /dev/sda\n  state=running queue_depth=1 scsi_level=6 type=0 device_blocked=0 timeout=30\n[1:0:0:0]    cd/dvd  HL-DT-ST DVDRAM GT30N     LT09  /dev/sr0\n  state=running queue_depth=1 scsi_level=6 type=5 device_blocked=0 timeout=30\n\nif the disk is not in state running, that's a pretty good sign. So /proc/mdstat\nwill tell you which member failed. Assuming you don't have a nice drive cage\nyou'll have to drill down by serial number, sg_inq should help with that.\nIf you do have a good drive cage, you should be able to enable the disk\nbeacon to help identify the faulty member.\nhttp://www.mail-archive.com/linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org/msg07307.html\n\nA: To get the serial codes of all harddisks run:\nlsblk -i -o kname,mountpoint,fstype,size,maj:min,name,state,rm,rota,ro,type,label,model,serial\n\n\nKNAME MOUNTPOINT   FSTYPE   SIZE MAJ:MIN NAME   STATE   RM ROTA RO TYPE LABEL         MODEL            SERIAL\nsda                         3.7T   8:0   sda    running  0    1  0 disk               WDC WD4000F9YZ-0 WD-WCCXXX4\nsda1                        3.7T   8:1   `-sda1          0    1  0 part\nsdb   /mnt/backup3 ext4     3.7T   8:16  sdb    running  0    1  0 disk backup_netops WDC WD4000F9YZ-0 WD-WCCXXX1\nsdc                         3.7T   8:32  sdc    running  0    1  0 disk               WDC WD4000F9YZ-0 WD-WCCXXX3\nsdc1  /mnt/backup2 ext4     3.7T   8:33  `-sdc1          0    1  0 part\nsdd                         3.7T   8:48  sdd    running  0    1  0 disk               WDC WD4000F9YZ-0 WD-WCCXXX2\nsdd1  /mnt/backup1 ext4     3.7T   8:49  `-sdd1          0    1  0 part\n\n\nA: It's simple.

The only other thing you can do is quiesce the I/O as\nbest you can and then use something like dd or sg_read on\nthe members themselves to stride a pattern of reads to the\ndisk that creates a uniquely identifiable blink pattern using\nthe activity LED, a poor man's beacon if you will. It's really\nyour only alternative, unless bringing the array down is an option.\nThis kind of serviceability is what differentiates external storage\narrays. Since you didn't plan ahead by scribbling down the serial\nnumbers and their positions, you can't do the simple set difference\nto identify the faulty drive.

Usually I scroll with two fingers (same on Win7), but suddenly my mouse would just jump around and send a lot of weird keypresses at the same time, when I tried to scroll. I tried having a look at the settings in the synclient, but everything seemed to be the same. I turned the touchpad off and then on, tried messing around with a lot of settings, but nothing seemed to help the two-finger scroll problem.\nThen I rebooted my computer, but the problem was still there. At last I turned the computer off, waited 5 seconds and turned it on again. And all of a sudden my touchpad worked just as good as before.\nThis is happening every time I reboot from Win7, in to Ubuntu, and the only thing that fixes it, is to turn off the laptop, and then turn it on again (no waiting required).\nMy guess is that the Synaptics driver on Win7 does something to the touchpad, that is not reset before a complete power off.\nHave anyone gotten any suggestions?\n\nA: A lot of devices (especially in notebooks) don't only have drivers, but also a firmware that is stored in a flash memory. This firmware is not permanent - like firmwares on other device - but is put there by the driver in use.\nThe problem: The firmware is not cleared on reboot of shutdown if the flash still has power (i.e. standby-power). The firmware used by windows-drivers is often incompatible with that of Linux drivers. So for a lot of notebook-users the only way to get their hardware (e.g. WiFi) working again, is to turn the notebook off, remove the battery and wait a while.\nThere is no way around this, that I know of.\n\nA: You may be interested in installing the gpointing-device-settings, which will provide more configuration options for your touchpad.

I tried to use Sound Converter to convert several folders of files from .m4a to .mp3 format and lost all file metadata in the conversion. I used Ubuntu 10.04 LTS with Sound Converter 1.4.4-2.\nIs this expected? Should I be using another program to perform this function on Ubuntu?\n\nA: I tested soundconverter 1.4.4-2 using maverick and a sample Apple lossless in the .m4a container from here: http://samples.mplayerhq.hu/A-codecs/lossless/, the metadata is preserved after conversion to .mp3, I verified this with the Banshee media player,Totem and Rhythmbox, I even made copies of the file and tried a batch conversion and all files converted to .mp3 has the original metadata, I converted a .flac lossless to .mp4 also and again the metadata in the .flac was carried over to the .mp4 file, even the cover art from the flac file was there, I then converted the .mp4 audio file to .mp3 and the metadata was still there, I also used Easytag-aac to embed a cover art in the .m4a file and after conversion I was able to see the cover art in the .mp3 file when playing with Banshee. \nFrom my experience here I would say that the loss of metadata after conversion with soundconverter should not be the expected outcome. Even this dated thread http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=138419&page=3 from the Ubuntu forum shows that soundconverter is supposed to retain the tags in the output format.\n\nA: I've not used SoX but at last check it did deserve the appellation \"the Swiss Army knife of sound processing programs\".\nIt can be found in package sox.\n\nA: This is an old problem but it still exists, at least on Ubuntu 18.04 with SoundConverter 3.0.

I have a folder containing a bunch of ppts, each of which I'd like to convert to an individual pdf.\n\nA: You can use unoconv. It's available in the repositories, so you can just apt-get it: unoconv (direct install link)\nNote that the info in the web page is outdated. Use man or type unoconv -h to get actual command line options. It works like this:\nunoconv -f pdf presentation.odt\n\nThis command will create a presentation.pdf file.\nI have only used it to batch convert ods to pdf and it works perfectly. I haven't tried it with presentations (but for a quick test now), but I expect that it will work nicely.\nNote that it will not work on Lucid (10.04), because of a bug in the python-openoffice biddings. If you need to use it on Lucid, you can add this ppa to your software sources to upgrade your Openoffice version.\n\nA: The easiest way to convert .ppt files to PDF is to install unoconv through the command line:\nsudo apt-get install unoconv\n\nThen open the terminal from the drive where the ppt files are available.\nNow type:\nunoconv -f [format] pdf  filename.ppt\n\nThat's all. Done.\n\nA: You can also use the command line of libreoffice for your purpose. This example converts all ppt-files in the current directory to pdf's:\nlibreoffice --headless --invisible --convert-to pdf *.ppt  \n\n\n--headless\n  Starts in \"headless mode\", which allows using the application without a user interface.\n         This special mode can be used when the application is controlled by external clients via the API...\n  It  implies  --invisible  and  strictly ignores any GUI environment.   \n\nand  \n\n--invisible\n              Starts in invisible mode.\n                Neither the start-up logo nor the initial program window will be visible.

I have only 512 Mb flash drive. Is it possible to create bootable Maverick 10.10 on it? Maybe, with some packages dropped? What tool can I try for it?\n\nA: You could try using Ubuntu Customization Kit available here http://uck.sourceforge.net\nit let you create a custom distribution based on Ubuntu with packages you need. You should also be able to customize language pack, default language, keyboard layout ecc... I hope it helps.\n\nA: There are many light weight distributions such as Lubuntu, Xubuntu, EasyPeasy (soon with 10.10 based version 1.7.), Puppy (still based on Lucid) - to name just a few - that have already done the job. If you need additional packages or another desktop you can alway install this later until your flash drive is full.\n", "Q: How to add icon of device on unity launcher?

If libfoo is pulled in by the package bar, and I upgrade it by executing apt-get install libfoo, how will this affect reverse dependencies?\nIf I then remove the package bar, will libfoo still be removed by apt-get autoremove?\n\nA: If you run apt-get install libfoo it will mark it as manually installed. This means it won't be removed by autoremove.\nAnd as far as I know, running apt-get install libfoo won't upgrade libfoo. It's already installed as a dependency of bar and it'll automatically be the most updated version that it can be (while still compatible with bar).\nIf there's a newer version of libfoo that isn't compatible with bar's dependency (packages can state what version of a package they need including \"newer than x\" or \"older than x\"), libfoo will be held back.\n\nA: 1) If libfoo is a dependence, doing apt-get install libfoo will install only the version compatible with the other application using it.\n2) If you remove bar and no other application is using libfoo, it will be removable with apt-get autoremove.\n", "Q: How to set up DAAP sharing in Banshee? Ok, so I can see and listen to music libraries from other computers on my network via Banshee (They are running Rhythmbox with DAAP enabled) but I cannot see my Banshee library from them. \nI have DAAP enabled in plugins (on Banshee).\n\nA: Best thing to do is install mt-daapd. This is a daemon which broadcasts a DAAP share and can be configured through a web interface or by editing a text file. To install, type the following in the command line:\nsudo apt-get install mt-daapd\nTo configure, navigate with your browser to:\nhttp://localhost:3689\nwith\nusername: mt-daapd\npassword: mt-daapd\n\nYou can change these once you are on the web interface.\nFrom there on it's pretty simple, and the interface should be self explanatory.\n\nA: Banshee still doesn't have DAAP sharing. It can consume, but there's no DLNA server in there yet.\nAccording to the application selection blueprints for Natty, the Ubuntu developers wan't to \"fix UPNP support\". I take that to mean making Banshee comparable to RhythmBox but there's room for misinterpretation.\nThe Banshee Team recommended method is through an external application called Tangerine. This has the benefit over an embedded solution in that Banshee wouldn't need to be running for things to find music.

The font of gnome became very weird when I surfed the Internet.\n\nI have used it for several months since the 10.04 is released. And I always install all the updates. It's the first time to meet such problem. I'm wondering what's the root cause.\n\nA: I suggest you take a look at the question \"Reset gnome font configuration?\" which has an answer saying how to reset the GNOME font configuration, which I include a summary of below.\nTry running the following in a terminal (Applications->Accessories->Terminal):\ngconftool-2 --unset /desktop/gnome/interface/font_name\ngconftool-2 --unset /desktop/gnome/interface/document_font_name\ngconftool-2 --unset /desktop/gnome/interface/monospace_font_name\ngconftool-2 --unset /apps/metacity/general/titlebar_font\ngconftool-2 --unset /apps/nautilus/preferences/desktop_font \n\n\nA: This looks a lot like glyph cache corruption. That's certainly not a real font or character set, but instead it is chopped up and mixed around pieces of the regular latin alphabet. You also have some random corruption in the form of those dashed lines on the right hand side.\nThis kind of bug is usually caused by your video card drivers, although it is not usually this severe. For example see the screenshots on this bug report:\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=495323\nIt can also be caused by an overheating or failing video card or other hardware problems.\n\nA: I have restarted the system to get things work again. The weird issue doesn't reproduce until now. \n\nA: Your fonts configurations are on ~/.font.conf Try to rename it and restart your computer. If it works I think you can delete it, though you can keep it.\n", "Q: Why do dist upgrades still have to freeze and ask questions? I left my dist upgrade (from Netbook Edition 10.04 to 10.10) running overnight and I wake up to see it frozen at some ridiculous question about replacing a config file.  Why can't they still get this right?  Don't pause and ask questions!!\nIsn't Ubuntu supposed to be for average usrs?  How is an average user supposed to know the \"right\" answer to such a question?\nIf the developers really feel they have to offer this flexibility, at least ask a question at the beginning of the upgrade like \"when there are config file conflicts, should we stop and ask you about it or just make our best guess?\"\n\nA: This would not be practical to do at the beginning of the process as in order to know which packages will ask a question, it has to unpack and evaluate their upgrade.\nThere is the possibility of doing this at the end, or defaulting to \"keep config\" but this adds complexities to the installer.\nThe installers are scriptable. Some have interactive parts that (if there) you would still want to run... Again, there might be the possibility of moving this to the end of the process.\nThe problem with both these ideas is they require changing significant portions of the dpkg system. As a result packages might need to be built differently for it to work and oh look, we're incompatible with debian! This is infinitely more of a problem than asking a few questions through the upgrade process.\n", "Q: Home network printer recommendations I'm looking to buy a new printer to share between an Ubuntu 10.10 laptop and Windows Vista computer. I'm after something: \n\n\n*\n\n*fairly cheap (<=£100); \n\n*with either wired or wireless networking;\n\n*that works out of the box with Ubuntu;\n\n*from any manufacturer.\n\n\nI've seen a lot of recommendations for HP gear, but whenever I try to check compatibility of the latest bunch of HP Officejets on the Ubuntu Wiki, there's either no entry or just \"needs retesting\".\nCan anyone suggest a good printer?\n\nA: The Open Printing site keeps a database of printers that work well with Linux. It's what I use before settling on a printer. I personally have had great successes with hp printers.\n\nA: I've found the best way to make sure a printer will work in Linux is to find a printer with native Postscript capabilities. They're slightly more expensive, but they tend to last forever. Beyond that, I've been very happy with HP. I love my HP LasterJet 1320; it was relatively cheap, has native PS, and can do double-sided prints to save on paper. I realize this doesn't match your \"networked\" requirement, but they may have a separate module for that, but then it probably wouldn't be as cheap. :)\n\nA: I use HP printers at work, and so far I have not come across a model the does not work out of the box with Linux, and we are talking 10-15 different models.\n\nA: I recently acquired an HP Officejet 6000. It offers wired networking and works well with CUPS and HPLIP. My Device URI looks like this hp:/net/Officejet_6000_E609a?ip=192.168.1.222 which gives fast wake-up from energy saving mode. For a reasonably fast and economical A4 inkjet printer, I certainly recommend it.\n\nA: It depends how much you use your printer. I recommend laser printers, they cost more, but they are much cheaper doing printing job(ink costs a lot).\nHP printers are good using under linux.\n", "Q: How make all programs close to the notification-area like rhythmbox does? I say \"close\", not \"minimise\". I dont want minimise to tray like some programs do, I want to close to tray, like Rhythmbox does. When I close the window I want the program to remain running but be minimised to the notification-area.\n\nA: ALLTRAY \nAllTray is a program written for Unix-like systems to enable a user to dock any program (such as Evolution, Thunderbird, or a terminal program) into the system tray. This is mostly useful when one wants to have a program always running, but easy to put out of the way.\nwith AllTray, you can minimize any app to the system tray.\n", "Q: Is it possible to alter and update the status icon of a running indicator applet? I'm trying to create a simple application indicator that mimics the CPU load applet for the gnome-panel. \nI currently do this by updating (overwriting) the status icon of the indicator with the new CPU load information and re-set the status icon to the same icon on every update (I know this is stupid, but I don't know if it's currently possible to solve otherwise). \nUnfortunately this doesn't work and I always see the \"first\" icon state, eg.\n\nThe indicator icon doesn't update, while the icon's content does.\nI also tried to temporarily set the status icon to something else first, eg.\n...\nupdate_icon()\nindicator.set_icon(\"indicator-messages\")\nindicator.set_icon(\"indicator-cpu-load\")\n...\n\nbut that didn't work either.\nAny ideas?\n\nUPDATE:\nIt is indeed possible to do what I wanted using a hack to cause the indicator to repaint its icon (thanks to Jorge Castro and Ted Gould):\n...\nupdate_icon()\nindicator.set_status(appindicator.STATUS_ATTENTION)\nindicator.set_status(appindicator.STATUS_ACTIVE)\n...\n\nThe attention state icon should be the same as the active state icon, else there would be some flicker.\n\nA: This is indeed not the intended behaviour of Application Indicators: they're meant to have one or two icons and not something that you could almost put in a widget.\nThere seems to be something wrong in the caching of the icon, as it should update a changed icon, though.\nAnyway, you probably want to use something like 'libindicator' to create your own, custom indicator. The collection of application indicators on your panel is drawn by one indicator. You have a lot more functions at your disposal when writing a custom indicator, than when using the limited API of Application Indicators, which was limited deliberately to make sure we don't get a mess.\nAlso make sure to look at the package 'libindicator-tools', which contains some handy utilities for testing indicators.\n\nA: I don't think this is possible and looks like it's by design, from the bug report.\n\nWhat we instead would like to\n  encourage is for people to start\n  thinking like icon themes. The reason\n  for this is that it allows for\n  multiple sizes and theming of the\n  panel separate from applications. So,\n  for instance, an application could be\n  themed with a light background (thus\n  needing dark icons) and the panel\n  could have a dark background (needing\n  light icons). The application\n  shouldn't have to know about this. And\n  by using icon naming this problem is\n  solvable on the panel side of things.\nFor the Natty cycle we also want to\n  provide a convenience API to provide\n  for building a custom icon theme for\n  people who want to generate icons.\n  This doesn't solve all of the theming\n  problems, but it does make it possible\n  to solve the multiple sizes one.\n\nUpdate: To answer your comment Ted thinks that is a bug and recommends that you file a bug on indicator-application, something along the lines of \"theme updates are not realized by the indicators\"\n", "Q: Is there a way to change the system font completely? Is there a way to change the system font completely? I mean I want the font from login in screen until every application follow the change.\n\nA: The font settings are stored in gconf and can be changed easily with gnome-appearance-properties. They can also be changed using gconf-editor or the commandline-tool gconftool-2.\nIf you want to change the fonts of the login-screen you have to run these tools as the user gdm like this:\nsudo -u gdm dbus-launch gnome-appearance-properties\n\nIn some cases this doesn't work and you have to go a more complicated way:\n\n*\n\n*Log out (so that you are on the login screen)\n\n\n*figure out what displaynumber the login screen has by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F7(F8,F9).

When asked whether to make the selection the new default, select yes.\n\nA: The per-user locale default for the Desktop session is stored in ~/.dmrc. This is the file that is updated when selecting a new locale at the GDM screen. GDM uses this to set up the environment when starting the user's session.\n\nA: If \"User Accounts\" is crashing each time you start it, you should reset the accounts.\nTo get the error-message, run 'gnome-control-center' from a terminal and click on \"User Accounts\".

There is a helpful tutorial at TechRepublic (Use runit to supervise Linux services) that walks through the process of setting it up, but it says:\n\nedit /etc/inittab and add:\nSV:123456:respawn:/sbin/runsvdir-start\nto the bottom of the file. This will\n  start (and re-start, if it ever exits)\n  the /sbin/runsvdir-start program.\n\nI found a post saying that inittab isn't used in some ubuntu versions. I can install/use chkconfig or update-rc.d, but I don't really know what I'm doing or how to translate the above statement into arguments for either tool. Any pointers?\n\nA: Jaunty is no longer supported (it reached End-Of-Life last month), so I would recommend upgrading (go to 10.04 if you need a long-lived system). However, when you upgrade to a version that uses Upstart, you can create a file in the /etc/init directory to do what you need. For example, create /etc/init/sheevaplug.conf:\nstart on stopped rc RUNLEVEL=[123456]\nstop on runlevel [!123456]\n\nrespawn\nexec /sbin/runsvdir-start\n\nThat is a direct translation of the inittab line you gave, and should behave similarly with Upstart. You can start and stop it with service sheevaplug start and service sheevaplug stop, etc.\n", "Q: USB Mouse stutters periodically I'm using an HP dv6000 (not sure of exact model) with a pretty basic Logitech wireless laptop mouse. From time to time, the USB mouse will be very stuttery and less responsive. Not all clicks register and the motion is not smooth. It seems like it's related to the notify-osd coming up when I get an IM or Email or whatever else, but it happens other times as well.\nIt's not the whole computer becoming less responsive, because if I use the touch pad during one of these fits, it works perfectly smooth. I've replaced the batteries in the mouse and have tried different USB ports with better line of sight, etc. I can't figure out what's going on. Any thoughts?\n\nA: Other than those points already mentioned, check that the USB cable of the receiver isn't running close to a power cable.  Some of the cheap ones can be affected by interference.  \nSecond have a look in the LED hole of the mouse.  I had a similar issue recently and it was down to a small piece of fluff in the hole.\n\nA: So, REALLY dumb answer that has gotten me before: make sure there isn't a hard to see piece of lint or dust jammed into the little cavity with the mouse's laser eye.  In some rare cases I've seen the cursor stop moving or even jitter across the screen by itself because of this.\n\nA: Replace your mouse. (After you have done some additional ruling out to make sure you are absolutely certain).\nI've had about two logitech mice do this when they got old. I thought at first it was software related until I tried other mice and the same troublesome mice on windows.\nIn my experience it's a standard problem with USB mice from Logitech. Appears to happen after they get dust or something in them, and they are rather hard to clean so best to get a cheap mouse and replace it.\n\nA: Before you try the above - is your mouse fully charged? (If rechargable) or do you have fresh batteries? It's always been the case for me when my wireless mouse has done what yours is doing.\n", "Q: Generating an app list from the old installation to run it on the new installation I want to shift from ubuntu-desktop 10.10 to ubuntu netbook edition 10.10 on my netbook. Currently, the moment I ssh into ubuntu from my ad-hoc network, ubuntu freezes. It always requires a  cold shutdown. So hoping that netbook edition may not have this issue. I have custom installed many applications on the desktop edition. So I want save the app list into a script and run the script on the new installation, so that all apps will be downloaded and installed. I need suggestions as to the best way to achieve this.\n\nA: Run this monster on your existing install, replace 12.04 your Ubuntu version and i386 with the architecture (i386 or amd64):\nrelease_num='12.04'\narch='i386'\n\ncomm -23 \\\n    <(sort <(aptitude search '~i!~E' --disable-columns | grep -v \"i A \" | cut -d \" \" -f 3)) \\\n    <(sort <(wget -q -O- http://releases.ubuntu.com/maverick/ubuntu-${release_num}-desktop-${arch}.manifest | grep -E -o '^[^ ]+')) \\\n| sed 's/$/ install/g' > packages\n\nIt will generate a file called packages. Copy this to somewhere in your new install and then run:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo bash -c \"cat packages | xargs apt-get -y install\"\n\nNote: This compares the packages used on the LiveCD with the current ones. At the moment there are a few packages (gparted, btrfs-tools, etc) that are on the CD that aren't installed. If you installed gparted manually, you'll need to reinstall it on the new machine manually too. Thankfully this only applies to a few packages, all of which are simple to install if/when you realise you need it.\nAlso if you use any PPAs or other repositories, make sure you set them up on the new machine before you run this.\n\nA: I suggest using oneconf \nIt integrates with Software Center rather nicely, and does what you want.\n\nA: I think others have answered the technical piece of your question, I'd like to answer the implied question - \"will moving to Unity fix this ssh problem\", and the answer is I'm afraid I doubt it. Remote shell sessions are generally not exercising Unity or the desktop. If you can ssh fine into your desktop from a wired network, but not from an ad-hoc network, the freezing is probably related to your wireless drivers and not the desktop shell.\n\nA: There's a file called 'filesystem.manifest-desktop' in the folder 'casper' on the CD (or extract it from the ISO file). It contains all the packages that get installed, minus the ones downloaded during the installation (updates, langpacks?).\nSo something like this should give you the list of added and removed packages:\ndpkg --get-selections | awk '{print $1}' > now.txt\nawk '{print $1}' filesystem.manifest-desktop > then.txt\ndiff -u then.txt now.txt | grep '^+' | sed 's/^+//' | grep -v '^+' > add.txt\ndiff -u then.txt now.txt | grep '^-' | sed 's/^-//' | grep -v '^-' > rem.txt\n\nYou can then install via:\ncat added.log | xargs sudo apt-get install\n(You need to make sure that all those packages are available, else that command will fail.)\n\n\n*\n\n*filesystem.manifest-desktop from ubuntu-10.10-desktop-i386.iso\n\n*filesystem.manifest-desktop from ubuntu-10.10-desktop-amd64.iso\n\n", "Q: How do you I find a list of softwares which are outdated and needs upgrade? How do I find a list of packages that are outdated and need to be upgraded using aptitude? \nI am using Ubuntu 10.04.\n\nA: update-manager (sitting in System -> Administration) should probably be your first port of call. Though if you want a command-line version:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\naptitude and synaptic can also tell you.\n\nA: Another way to achive that from the command line is that of apt-show-versions.\nThe man page states:\n\napt-show-versions parses the dpkg status file and the APT lists for the installed and available package versions and distribution and shows upgrade options within the specific distribution of the selected package.\n\nOnce you've installed the package:\n\n$ sudo apt-get install apt-show-versions\n\nthe only thing you have to do is:\n\n$ sudo apt-show-versions -u\n\nHope that helps\n\nA: Aptitude doesn't handle package installation as well as apt-get, so I would recommend sticking with apt-get. To get a list of packages that need to be installed, I would use the --dry-run option:\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade --dry-run | grep ^Inst | cut -d\" \" -f2\n\n\nA: In synaptic: from left \"Status\" and select \"installed (upgradable)\", or just use update-manager which shows all needed updates.\nSynaptic: System->Administrator->Synaptic Package manager\nUpdate manager: System->Administrator->Update manager\n", "Q: How can I set up Ubuntu to install updates without asking? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I enable automatic updates? \n\nI would like to have Ubuntu silently install updates every day or so. It it possible to set it to do so? Are there any potential dangers to doing things this way?\n\nA: sudo apt-get install unattended-upgrades\n\nunattended-upgrades can be quickly configured to let you upgrade more than just security updates although you should recognise that sometimes (mainly with Firefox in my experience) upgrades can break running applications. That's something you'll have to weigh up yourself.\nTo configure edit /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades but you can read more about the configuration options on the help site\n\nA: In the Ubuntu Software Center, go to the menu \"Edit\" -> \"Software Sources…\", then in the third tab \"Updates\", there is the option to select \"Install security updates without confirmation\".  This will not install all updates automatically, but it will do so for security updates.\nThere are also other ways (see Oli's answer) in case you want all updates to be installed...\nPotential dangers are the same as with all updates: every change can introduce new bugs...\n(An that's even more so with updates that introduce more features, so it's probably reasonably safe for security fixes, but somewhat less so if you also have repositores like ubuntu-proposed or ubuntu-backports or some PPAs.)\n\nA: You need use software sources (Ubuntu 10.10 from Ubuntu Software Center -> Edit -> Software Sources).\nSelect tab Updates, then the \"Install security updates without confirmation\". It only installs security updates.\n\nA: Check the following wiki page .\nIt should be as safe and running an interactive upgrade, except for the fact that if you get an issue from an upgrade you may not be aware in advance.\n", "Q: How to download flash (streaming) videos from sites like youtube, dailymotion, vimeo, etc.? I have read this thread but please hear me out.\nI use Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (32-bit) and I didn't bother to install the Flash plugin for Firefox as I am using a netbook and sometimes Flash caused firefox to crash. What I would like to ask is if I had the link to the video, is there some way I can download it and watch it offline (via VLC) so that I don't need to install Flash plugin? Command line or GUI techniques is welcome.\nBased on what I have read, using the /tmp technique requires Flash plugin to be installed and the video to be loaded before I can go scavenge it in the said directory. Note that I also want to dload videos from site aside from youtube.\n\nA: One of the better tools is the Firefox Add-On 1-Click YouTube Video Download. It gives you an easy right-clickable download link.\n\nA: CLI alternatives for downloading from YouTube or other flash video streaming sites:\n\nPackage: get-flash-videos\nSyntax:\nget_flash_videos [OPTION]...

From the description on the page:\n\nDownload videos from various Flash-based video hosting sites, without\n  having to use the Flash player. Handy for saving videos for watching\n  offline, and means you don't have to keep upgrading Flash for sites\n  that insist on a newer version of the player.\nIncludes support for the following sites/players (and more!):\nYouTube, eHow, Brightcove (used by many sites like Channel 4, Daily\n  Telegraph ...), BBC (news, etc), Metacafe, 5min, Google, fliqz,\n  nicovideo, vimeo, Blip, Break, Collegehumor, Muzu, Sevenload,\n  Megavideo, Wat.tv. Also includes a 'generic' method which works on\n  many other sites.\n\nI would definitely recommend using this program.\n\nA: I would recommend ClipGrab, it downloads videos from many popular video sites including:  \n\n\n*\n\n*YouTube\n\n*Clipfish\n\n*College Humor\n\n*Daily Motion\n\n*MyVideo\n\n*MySpass\n\n*Sevenload\n\n*Tudou\n\n*Vimeo\n\n\nIt also allows you to transcode the video into multiple formats including audio formats such as mp3 and ogg vorbis.\n\nYou can install it from the ppa:clipgrab-team/ppa PPA.\n\nA: You can use \"Easy Youtube Video Downloader\" extension in Firefox:\nEasy YouTube Video Downloader Add-on\n\n\nA: The commandline tool youtube-dl can download videos from YouTube, dailymotion and some other sites.\nsudo apt-get install youtube-dl\n\nThere is also a Totem plugin to look at Youtube videos.\n\nA: CClive is a command line application that downloads videos from a number of sites including youtube and dailymotion. If you run:\ncclive url1 url2 url3 ...\n\ncclive will download the videos to the current working directory.\nSee man cclive for details of more advanced options.\nAbby is a GUI frontend for cclive. It seems from the google code page that the development is inactive and I can't get it to work in Maverick. I remember using it in Lucid and it worked OK.\n\nI recall having problems with cclive and abby when I was using it on Lucid for downloading youtube videos. This is because youtube changed their implementation (probably to stop downloaders like cclive) and the version of cclive in the repositories wasn't up to date enough to work. There were similar problems with youtube-dl. A solution to this is to install a newer version from source or find a ppa of the newer version.\n\nA: I'm a big fan of jdownloader. It has plugins for most of the common video sites. You can choose at what definition you download from (on youtube at least, i'm not sure about other sites). It automatically runs url you copy for downloading, its a nice streamlined process. I suggest you try it out \nhttps://launchpad.net/~jd-team/+archive/jdownloader. Add the PPA from here and install \"jdownloader\" (by the way, its written in java, its only downfall)\n\nA: I would recommend this extension for Chrome http://grabanymedia.altervista.org/ translated into English, Italian, French, German, Portuguese\n\nA: If you only like to watch the youtube videos, you can with vlc. Only thing you need to copy the youtube URL and paste to the VLC main window and hit Play (enter). You also can drag and drop the URL from the browser to the vlc main window with mouse or touchpad. It even easier.\n\nA: How about you-get? Details is at the Git repository and the application could simply installed by $ pip3 install you-get. I have seen this program downloaded from YouTube and Vimeo. \n\nA: For the YouTube videos, I use the Greasemonkey script YouTube Video Download\n\n\nA: There are lots of websites that provides downloading streaming video . My favorite is keepvid.\nIt will support downloading of videos from \n\n\n*\n\n*YouTube\n\n* MegaVideo\n\n* Flickr\n\n* Dailymotion\n\n* Facebook\n\n* Vimeo\n\n* Metacafe\n\n* and so on\nAll you have to do is enter the link of the video to the 'URL' search box on the top of the site and click the 'DOWNLOAD' button.

I am writing a small reminder-app and want to play a system sound once the timer has reached 0. What is the easiest way to play that sound, and which sound would you recommend?\n\nA: The easiest way would probably be to shell out:\nsystem(\"/usr/bin/canberra-gtk-play --id='bell'\")\n\nThis will work in other programming languages as well.\n/usr/bin/canberra-gtk-play will play a sound from the current sound theme. See the freedesktop.org sound naming spec for a list of available sounds and their meanings. Beware that (as far as I know) there isn't a sound theme that provides all of these sounds.\nUse ls /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo to see what sounds are supported by the 'ubuntu' sound theme which is default, and rarely changed (due to no easy way to install sound themes) on Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Installing gtk development environment Not new to Ubuntu or programming but I am new to programming in C and gtk. Have been using Quickly for the odd program. I want to play around with C and gtk.\nWhat gtk packages do I need to install to have a working development environment with C?  \n\nA: I cheat and use the list of packages needed to build other big GTK applications instead:\nsudo apt-get build-dep inkscape\n\nOr for a more minimal starting point, go with the bare minimum and add on when you need to:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential libgtk2.0-dev\n\n\nA: For a full development environment, the gnome-devel  metapackage will install a full GTK + GNOME development environment, including the development documentation and the Anjuta IDE.\nThis is quite a lot more than the minimal set of things you'll need for GTK development, but it can be nice to have everything you're likely to need available.\n\nA: You probably want an application like Anjuta or CodeBlocks (both can be found in the software center).\nI would HIGHLY suggest Anjuta over most other IDE's for it's Glade integration (among other features), usage of autotools (less headaches), and the portability of the code (you can use any text editor you like =).\nIf you have no idealogical issues, you can try using Monodevelop (it's a good IDE, similar to Visual Studio).\nTo get the dependencies for a basic GTK+ development, just install buildessential and libgtk2.0-dev as Kees noted.\n", "Q: Why is the automatic login disabled for users with encrypted home? I've tried to setup an autologin, but that isn't possible, because my home is encrypted. What are the reasons for this?\nPS. Here I have described my problem: Ubuntu Netbook Edition and automatic login. \n\nA: The problem is that your password is required to unwrap the mount passphrase used to decrypt the eCryptfs home directory. Without that, it's not possible; the system doesn't have the encryption key yet.\nThese login styles are mutually exclusive; you can either automatically log in (thereby letting anyone with physical access to your computer be able to access your data), or you can encrypt your home directory (keeping things encrypted and safe from access without a passphrase), but not both.\n", "Q: I need a command to remove all files from a directory (and subdir) that are under 20MB With the exception of certain file extensions.  (removing junk other than subtitle files from a video directory)\n\nA: First, run  \nfind . -type f ! -name '*.sub' ! -name '*.srt' -size -20M -print  \n\nto check that it mathes only file types that you want. I'm a long time unix user and I always do this before asking any command to remove anything (typos always happen at the worst possible time). Then edit the previous command line to become  \nfind . -type f ! -name '*.sub' ! -name '*.srt' -size -20M -print0 | xargs -0 /bin/rm -f  \n\nand run it. It should do what you want. You can repeat the ! -name '*.srt' part more times if you need to exclude more files. Be careful to include the single quotes: they are important to prevent the shell from doing filename expansion.\n\nA: here:\nfind . -type f -name *.bak -size -20M -exec rm {} \\;\n\nwith -name *.bak you are looking for files with extension \"bak\", -type f is looking for files (not directories), -size -20M give you all files smaller than 20MB (-size +20M for the reverse search of files bigger than 20MB) and with the -exec you are removing the results of this search.\n\nA: find . -type f ! -name '*.ext' -size -20M -delete\n\nis more easy to type and remember than anything else. You have to remember that -delete is position dependent, and deletes without further notice and trashcan. \nJust be careful, backup often, and test before deleting: \nfind . -type f ! -name '*.ext' -size -20M \n\n", "Q: Correct way to apply patches to your kernel? I am following the instructions located here to setup my server. It states that I have to apply a patch which I've downloaded onto the machine. My question is, the article says to use the following command:\n/usr/src/linux # patch -p1 < file.diff //note I replace file.diff w/ routes-2.6.36.16.diff\n\nThis returns:\n-bash: /usr/src/linux: No such file or directory\n\nI go on to assume that /linux # should be replaced with the actual linux kernel version/dir. I've tried this using the following command:\n/usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.35.22 patch -p1 < file.diff\n\nThis returns the same. When I view the contents of /usr/src I only have two directories linux-headers-2.6.35.22 and linux-headers-2.6.35.22-generic-pae I need guidance as to the correct way to apply a patch to the kernel. \nEdit\nIf I execute /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.35.22/ patch -p1 file.diff I get -bash: /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.35.22: is a directory. I need to know how I go about finding the specific file that needs to be patched here...\n\nA: You need to download the source. You can do this via apt-src but I would (personally) just grab the latest from kernel.org, extract it, patch it (just using local paths like the desktop, it doesn't need to be hidden in /usr/src at all!) and follow the \"old fashioned way\" instructions for compiling it.\nNote that some patches are only for certain versions of the kernel (this includes point releases) so make sure your patch works for the source version before you waste 20-30 minutes compiling it.\nBut your specific problem is you need to be in the directory that you want to apply the patch to. In your case:\ncd /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.35.22/\npatch -p1 < /path/to/file.diff\n\nObviously change the path to the patch (or stick it in the same directory). If the source files are owned by root, prefix sudo onto the patch command or run sudo su to become root while you do this.\n\nA: To avoid frustration, you should generally do such things the Ubuntu way.  Full instructions using official packages can be found here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile \nIt provides lists of dependencies and step-by-step commands for getting a custom kernel up and running.\nBy following that procedure, you will end up with an uninstallable package containing your custom kernel, which means that you will be able to switch back to the official kernels in future if needed. \n\nA: The instructions you are following are showing you the command-line prompt /usr/src/linux #, which is not something you type as part of the command. The command to type that will apply the patch starts at patch and continues from there.\n", "Q: How do I get Nvidia drivers to work with mainline PPA kernels?

I used the 256.53 Version which works with 2.6.35 but that won't install because of mismatching gcc versions with the kernel (yes i selected ignore but it won't install). the newer 260 Version installs but i only get a black screen. \n\nA: This looks like a bug with how the Ubuntu Kernel Team is building the mainline kernels. They appear to be building on a Hardy (8.04) system (with gcc 4.2.3-2ubuntu7). In the meantime, you could try building the Nvidia drivers within a Hardy chroot. Tthough somewhat overkill for this case, you could set up the chroot and build it there.\n\nA: You can't use the mainline builds with the nvidia driver (due to gcc versions, as you note).\nCompile it yourself. It's not nearly as hard as it sounds. I download the latest source from kernel.org and build it \"the old fashioned way\".

I copied them and pasted them all in Inkscape, nothing strange, but then every time I copied a new image to the Inkscape workspace somehow the images that were already there got replaced with the image I just copied. I don't know if it's a feature of Inkscape or something like that, or could it be Ubuntu.\nWell, I certainly don't know what it is but it's rather annoying.\nAlso this affects the PDF files that were already created. Say I have a PDF with an image of a dog, and I click copy and choose the image of a cat, the PDF file gets edited, even when it's not in use.\n\nA: Best guess: you are only linking to the images within the PDF file and everytime you copy a new image, the old one gets replaced (maybe caused by a clipboard manager).\nThere are two ways to include a raster image in Inkscape: either link to it (then you need the PDF and the image file to see the whole document) or embed it (then the PDF will also contain the image's data).\nI'd save whatever image you want to disk, then import it in Inkscape (File > Import...):\n\nand select \"embed\" in above dialog.\n", "Q: Wifi light doesnt turn off on Acer Aspire One I recently installed Ubuntu netbook edition on my Acer Aspire One D255 netbook, and I notice that the wifi light never turns off, even if I'm not connected to a network. When I am connected to a network, it never stops blinking. I dont remember this behaviour when Windows 7 was on it.\nIs there a way to turn this light off? Does this mean the wifi is constantly on even when not being used?\n\nA: I have an aspire one as well, and I have noticed that the light remains on (Windows or Linux [NB Windows XP]) whether or not I am connected to a network (though it flashes sometimes when I'm downloading anything.\nAs far as I've been able to tell, the network light is only on if your wireless device is powered (This is how it's supposed to operate btw), and does not remain on if you have the wifi disabled (powered off state).\nDon't worry about it, your system is fine (unless I'm missing something). If you want to turn the light off when you are not using a network (and if you want to save some serious power), turn off the wireless switch when you are not using wifi.\n", "Q: Are pre-existing files in a mountpoint directory safe and uneffected? I've noticed that pre-existing files in a \"mountpoint\" directory disappear when the mount command is applied... and then they re-appear when the directory is unmounted.  \nAre these files just on \"holiday\" for the duration of the mount period? ... are they safe? ... and is there some way to still access them while the mount is active?   \n\nA: Files are safe as mentioned in @codeMonks answer. \nBut there's a safer workaround to access the files. Let's say that you have existing directory /data/media/ with assorted media files (/data and /data/media are on the same filesystem)\nNow mounting something like over /data/media  will hide files that it contained. (lets assume that you've added usbdrive /dev/sdb1 and mounted it over  /data/media)\nTo access files in /data/media:\nTo be on the safe side, first create empty directory /mnt/mymedia\nand then use mount --bind (works on directory level)\nsudo mount --bind  /data /mnt/mymedia/\n\nPlease note that you have to use the upperdir /data if you're mounting after usb drive! But if you used \nsudo mount --bind  /data/media /mnt/mymedia/\n\nbefore mounting said usbdrive you can still access you original files from /mnt/mymedia\n\nA: Don't worry about your files, they won't be overwritten while the directory they're in is used as a mount point. Unfortunately, when you mount over that directory they are completely invisible to the system. There's no trivial way you can access them while the directory is being used as a mount point. If you need to use them, you'll have to unmount the filesystem there first.\n", "Q: How to setup multiple WANs with load balancing? What is the best way to setup multiple WAN's into a Ubuntu distro and load balance?\nI have two internet connections, one static and one dynamic and I need to combine and load balance them. I have been looking into the following method http://www.netlife.co.za/archived-articles/12-started.html but was wondering if anyone had suggestions that were more Ubuntu specific or possibly other distro's that would work better for this. \n\nA: As far as I know, Zentyal, previously known as eBox, offers that functionality, and it's easily installable on Ubuntu.\nVersion 1.4 is available from the repositories as eBox, and version 2.0 can be installed from an additional repository.\nSee here: http://www.zentyal.org/\nAnd here is a nice detailed HOWTO: http://www.howtoforge.com/using-ebox-as-a-gateway-firewall-traffic-shaping-http-proxy-and-more\n\nA: The primary problem is that while you can create configurations to load balance your outbound traffic, you won't be able to control your inbound traffic. The inbound traffic is aimed at a specific IP address, and each of your Internet connections has a separate IP, as assigned by the upstream provider. Doing this requires coordination with your upstream provider, and likely a full BGP configuration to publish alternate routes, etc. Doing bonding (combining traffic) would also need the upstream involved.\n\nA: Try out Zeroshell, bundled with an Linux.\nRuns very smooth on low end h/w with no glitches.\nConfiguration options lets to play as you want.\n", "Q: How can I get my Epson v500 scanner working? I have a v500 scanner, but it doesn't show up in simple scan. I've turned it off and on a few times to see if that was the problem. Here is the usb information:\nBus 002 Device 008: ID 04b8:0130 Seiko Epson Corp. Perfection V500 (GT-X770)\n\nA: If your scanner doesn't work with simple scan, it is probably best to install the iscan package. The following general instructions will work for your model and any other ones listed on the site.\nIt is worth explaining in detail which packages to choose as the download site is quite confusing. As noted in the comments by JoZ3 the preferred site is now the Epson download centre rather than the old Avays site.\nFirst, select the scanner model and OS from the Epson site, and then refer to the important FAQ, which explains the packages and the order they need to be installed.\nAfter you click accept on the driver download page for your model (V500 in this case), there are a lot of confusing options as detailed below:\n\n1) Selecting the packages\nIn all cases choose the .deb files. If you are on a 32 bit system, you will need the package that has i386 in it or if you are on a 64 bit system you will need the ones with x86_64 or amd_64 in them.\nYou need both the data and the core packages, as noted by the FAQ.\nHowever, it is also very important to note that if you are using an Ubuntu version that is 8.10 or higher (which mostly everyone is), you must choose the deb file that contains usb0.1.ltdl7 somewhere in its title. (The debs with usb0.1.ltdl3 in the deb title are for Ubuntu versions 8.04 and lower.)\nReferring to the above screenshot, for a 32 bit system you would thus choose the following packages for your scanner:\niscan_2.29.1-5~usb0.1.ltdl7_i386.deb\niscan-data_1.19.0-1_all.deb\n\nIf you want the additional plugin (iscan-plugin-gt-x770_2.1.2-1_i386.deb for a 32 bit system), please go back to the original screen and select it.\nYou may also want to select the user guide for iscan; the English version is listed on the site as userg_revQ_e.pdf.\n2) Installing the Packages\nNow locate your downloaded files and use software-center or gdebi to install the iscan-data first and then the main iscan package (and after that the plugin if necessary). \n3) Running the Program\nNow it's probably best to logout and login again and then switch your scanner on and go to the menu to find the iscan program in the graphics tab. Now start the program and your scanner should automatically be recognised and be ready for use.\n(The example below is from another one of my scanners set up in the way described above.)\n\n\nA: This page has the Scanner Software (might have to answer a few questions) that should work for your scanner. It is offered in 32 and 64 bit versions. Look at the web-page. Scroll to Perfection V500 PHOTO data package and download and install the 1 .deb file. \nNext scroll to Perfection V500 PHOTO core package and select the proper .deb file for your current system. Download and install. \nNext: Log-out and back in or restart your machine. Once logged back in go to> applications menu and find the \"Image Scan\" application, should be under Graphics. \nI use iscan on my Epson MFP and it works great. It will also work with simple-scan sane and xsane \n\nA: I got it working in Precise 64bit by installing the 3 .deb files from Epson's website\nThese are the ones I used for the V500:\n\n\n*\n\n*iscan-plugin-gt-x770_2.1.2-1_amd64.deb\n\n*iscan_2.29.1-5~usb0.1.ltdl7_amd64.deb\n\n*iscan-data_1.20.0-1_all.deb\n", "Q: USB Drive speed testing app with test options I know there is a benchmark in the Disk Utility app, but I need something with a few more options. Some of my USB Drives are exhibiting weird results which may be due to testing patterns etc, so some test options would really help me out (chunk size, flush buffer on every write, test size, data pattern / access pattern)\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: iozone (sudo apt-get install iozone3) gives you a stupid level of config and detail. There's also bonnie++ but I think that has less use in this case.\n\nA: Open up a terminal window then type in:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nto get the name of the partition and next: \nsudo hdparm -Tt /dev/sda1 \n\n\nA: You can also try F3, from Michel Machado.\n", "Q: What do the abbreviations \"etc\" and \"usr\" mean? I can relate to acronyms and abbreviations much more readily when I actually know how they were derived.\nIt is oftn pssble to wrk out wht an abrvtion means if you know the the root words behind it... but unfortunately etc is a standard abbreviation for \"et-cetera\"... and for usr I think of \"user\"... but I can't see any correlation.\nMost of the terse names in Linux actually make sense when I finally work out the expanded original normal words behind them..\nAre the origins of these abbreviations lost in the mists of time, or are they \"obvious\" to all but me?\nThis question was prompted by a comment I read yesterday, where someone described these things as Linux incantations ... I sympathize with him :)...\n\nA: /etc is an abbreviation for etcetera, as I'm sure you guessed... It's the directory which stores all of your configuration files. /usr, as you guessed, is the directory where \"user\" files reside; it contains all of the items that are not part of the system itself such as user programs and data. System programs are stored in /bin, user programs in /usr/bin, or, in Ubuntu, in /usr/share/. TuxFiles has a good description of the Linux directory structure.\n\nA: As you suspected, /etc is from etcetera, unhelpfully named for \"where everything else goes\", and /usr was for \"user applications\". A lot of the detail on the history of the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard is documented on Wikipedia.\n\nA: The abbrevation \"usr\" of \"/usr\" does not mean user.\nThat was only until 10 years ago or so. Since around 2000 it's now the abbrevation for \"Unix System Resources\".\n\nA: I heard that /usr was for *U*nix *S*ystem *R*esources.\n", "Q: Rebuild mdadm Raid5 after OS hard drive died I have an ubuntu desktop 10.4 \"server\" with 5 hardrives. 1 of the hardrives had 3 OS's on it (Windows Vista, Windows XP, and Ubuntu 10.4). I primarily used the ubuntu OS so that I could use mdadm and boxee.\nThe other 4 hard drives were configured using mdadm in a Raid5 partition.\nAs far as I know, those 4 hard drives are fine...\nBut my main OS hard drive has completely died. The computer won't boot up, obviously, without a drive with an operating system.\nMy goal is to somehow reload an operating system onto a new hard drive that I just received from newegg.com, or to load a live cd...and then retrieve or reassemble my mdadm raid 5 partition so I can at least get my rather huge music collection off the machine and onto an external hard drive.\nWhat [detailed] steps do I need to take in order to achieve this?\n\nA: Wow. Linux really does kick ass. Here's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Because my old Boot/OS drive failed, I installed Ubuntu (10.10) onto a brand new hard drive. (I made sure not to reformat or install over the other 4 RAID drives which did not fail).\n\n*After Ubuntu installed and booted up for the first time, I then installed mdadm with \"sudo apt-get install mdadm\"\n\n*Now I wanted to see if my RAID was recognized by the system. Inside the disk utility, the raid array was listed, but it said \"Not running, not enough components to start.\"\n\n*I checked on an Ubuntu forum about this problem...and the solution was rebooting the system. I rebooted...and the RAID array is now fully functioning again (listed inside the disk utility, and mounted in the filesystem under \"Places\").\n\n\nThat's all I had to do!\n\nA: Amazingly enough, your RAID should actually be autodetected by Linux simply by the virtue of being made up of \"Linux RAID Autodetect\" partitions. So, after you install on the OS drive, after first boot, you should have an MD device here:\ncat /proc/mdstat\n\nTo manage it, you'll want to make sure you have mdadm installed:\napt-get install mdadm\n\nJust installing mdadm will actually try to auto-detect your arrays so check /proc/mdstat again. If they're still not there, you can assemble by running something like:\nmdadm --assemble /dev/md0 /dev/sdXX /dev/sdYY ....\n\nYou'll want to save the configuration if you have to do that manually:\n/usr/share/mdadm/mkconf\n\nAnd then update the initramfs for your system:\nupdate-initramfs -u        \n\n", "Q: Tool for File Recover | Deleted Files Recovery Advise me please some recovery tools for File Recover | Deleted Files Recovery | Damaged Files\n\nA: The problem with deleted files is that they no longer have inodes and a lot of the data about the filename and how they're linked together is lost. It's not like in windows where the filesystem just renames the file.\nThere are ways to do it, you can follow some of the guides here:\nhttp://e2undel.sourceforge.net/recovery-howto.html\nThey show you some of the tools which use heuristics and guessing to put data back together.\n\nA: The first thing to try is the Trash bin.\nGo to Places -> Home Folder\nThen click on Trash\nIf the file is there right click and then select Restore.\nIf this does not help try following the official ubuntu data recovery instructions here\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery\n\nA: Autopsy and the SleuthKit tools are relatively user friendly for this purpose, at least in relation to some other tools.\n", "Q: How do I test multi-gesture capabilities of a touchpad? I bought new laptop and I was told that my touch pad is 'Multi Gesture Touchpad'. I'd like to zoom, scroll with two fingers and perform three finger operations. \nHow do I test the multi gesture capabilities of my touchpad?\n\nA: You can enable two-finger scrolling by forcing the scrolling setting:\ngconftool-2 --set --type=int /desktop/gnome/peripherals/touchpad/scroll_method 2\n\nIf this doesn't work, try with the below script:\nxinput --set-prop --type=int --format=32 \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\" \"Synaptics Two-Finger Pressure\" 10\n\n#   Below width 1 finger touch, above width simulate 2 finger touch. - value=pad-pixels\nxinput --set-prop --type=int --format=32 \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\" \"Synaptics Two-Finger Width\" 7        \n\n#   vertical scrolling, horizontal scrolling - values: 0=disable 1=enable\nxinput --set-prop --type=int --format=8  \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\" \"Synaptics Two-Finger Scrolling\" 1 1   \n\n#   vertical, horizontal, corner - values: 0=disable  1=enable\nxinput --set-prop --type=int --format=8  \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\" \"Synaptics Edge Scrolling\" 0 0 0       \n\n#   stabilize 2 finger actions - value=pad-pixels\nxinput --set-prop --type=int --format=32 \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\" \"Synaptics Jumpy Cursor Threshold\" 120 \n\nI have added it to my startup applications. If it doesn't seem to work, try adding a sleep 10 at the top of the script.\n\nA: You can enable tapping and two finger scrolling at System -> Preferences -> Mouse -> Touchpad.\nAfter that, you should be able to\n\n\n*\n\n*scroll with two fingers\n\n*left click by tapping with one finger\n\n*right click by tapping with two fingers\n\n*middle click by tapping with three fingers\n\n\nFor zooming and other features you might have a look at utouch.\n\nA: There is no guarantee that your touchpad will be one of the supported ones in the new utouch project. But you can test it out by installing the utouch package:\nsudo apt-get install utouch\nI'd also recommend looking at the wiki page for all the details about utouch: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Multitouch\n", "Q: Updating TomTom GPS devices?

It was awesome.\nToday I'd like to sort of do the opposite. I want to view an application running on my phone on my PC. I could install a SSH server on my phone but I frankly don't fancy that purely for security reasons. I want this to be initiated from my phone.\nIs there a way to connect from my phone and tunnel the PC's X connection back to the phone and then run an application on the phone that show on the PC?\n\nA: \"reverse ssh tunnelling\" or \"remote port forwarding\" is your friend.\nissue this on the phone\nssh -f -N -X -R 5555:localhost:22 desktop_user@desktop\nthen, on the desktop this\nssh -X -p 5555 phone_user@localhost\n\nA: If I understood it correctly you just need to use the DISPLAY variable on your phone to redirect the applications display to your desktop.\nOn your desktop:\nxhost +phone_ip\n\nOn your phone:\nexport DISPLAY=desktop_ip:0\n\nstart app\n\nA: Reviving this old thread just to provide modern solutions for old problems:\nI'm not sure how innards of scrcpy work, but it surely is something worth checking out - it's an open source project providing BOTH display AND control over your Android device.\nAside from the basic \"show me phone's screen\" it supports many other things like gestures, hotkeys, recording, wireless (!) control of android through adb and many other features. Additionally another project (linked on the github page - sndcpy) allows audio forwarding. This is purely a host PC program, and only requires debugging enabled on the target device. IIRC everything works over ADB (so Android only???).\nThere is no visible lag when running through USB on my Ubuntu 20.04 Lenovo <-> Android 10 Huaweii P20Pro on full resolution and maximum FPS, and on wireless there are minor drops to 15 FPS and minimal input lag. I successfully managed to play a game on my phone through my notebook's mouse and keyboard.\nMain adventages:\n\n*\n\n*multiplatform - scrcpy works on linux, windows and mac\n\n*host OS only - minimal setup on adroid is required (allowing USB debugging)\n\n*works out of the box\n\n*what a quality!\n\n*open source\n\nTo be fair, this doesn't exactly satisfy the \"initiate from the phone\" condition, but I'll post this answer anyway, only because the scrcpy is so powerful in what it does and deserves more recognition.\n", "Q: Python 3 error when running the print command All I wrote in the interpreter was as follows:\n>>> print \"Hello, World!\"\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1\n    print \"Hello, World!\"\n                        ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\nHow did I even get an error? All I tried to do was run a print command.\n\nA: One of the major changes in Python 3 is that print has become a function.

This is how you print \"hello world\" in Python 3:\nprint(\"Hello world\")\n\nI recommend taking a look at What's new in Python 3, this issue is the first one mentioned on the list.\nI also recommend asking any programming questions on StackOverflow, in my experience, they are welcoming to beginners.\n\nA: In Python3 print is a function:\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n\nCheck:\nhttp://docs.python.org/release/3.0.1/whatsnew/3.0.html\n\nA: Some of the other answers have already covered this, but you should do print(\"Hello World\") instead.

I resized Windows 7 partition and started the installation of the 10.04 LTS. However, I soon discovered a big problem that prevented me to start the installation.\nThe issue is that the HDD is partitioned with 4 primary partitions: 2 for Win 7 (SYSTEM and C:) and 2 for HP recovery tools. Due to this fact, even if I have more than 200GB of free space, I cannot install a new partition, because 4 is the maximum number of primary partitions!\nI'm very disappointed about that, it seems that this partitioning scheme actually prevents a user to install a different OS on the HP laptops.\nI thought about removing the recovery partitions, but my company did not allow me to do so.\nDo you know if there is any other way to install Ubuntu on this setup?\n\nA: You can always use Wubi. It will install Ubuntu inside your windows partition.\n\nA: My usual solution to this is to find a partition that I can delete. The \"HP Tools\" partition appears to be realatively unimportant, and can be safely deleted, allowing you to create an extended partition and then any number of logical partitions. It's pretty tiny, but you can resize other partitions to make it larger.\nYou may want to back up its contents in case you ever need it, though...\nOne word of warning. Never run the HP recovery partition. On a machine where I accidentally booted that (and only let it boot, never agreed to do anything) it re-wrote the partition table that the machine shipped with (but fortunately didn't overwrite anything)\n\nA: You don't need a primary partition to install Ubuntu, you can shrink your current tail partition and create a logical partition on the free space.\n\nA: I have a Probook as well, and the partitioning scheme is stupid, and the only way I have found is the use Wubi.\n\nA: You've hit the maximum number of partitions in your partition table for the disk (msdos). Basically your disk can only hold four partitions, which were already claimed by your default setup. Hypothetically you could delete the HP recovery tools partitions, but I'd recommend moving them to another disk temporarily and creating an extended partition in their place - this will allow you to create up to 8 logical partitions within the extended partition. It's a workaround for the old partition table that isn't needed for the more recent GPT partition tables that come with hard drives bigger than 2TB, or any EUFI OS, such as Windows 8.\n", "Q: Software for the Analysis of Interaction Sequences? I am looking for a computer program for analysing sequential observational data for Ubuntu.

I have a machine with 10 GB of RAM, and I would like to run Ubuntu on it (Debian also OK if its easier), fully in RAM in such a way: I boot from a compressed image on an USB flash disk, that is uncompressed into RAM, and then I can remove the disk from the USB slot, and use the system only with RAM, without any permanent disk. \nWhenever I make any changes that I want permanent, I would put the flash disk back into the USB slot (possibly not the same one as I used initially to boot, as I would like to keep many versions of the boot flash disk), and run some command that would save the current state into a compressed image on the disk.\nHow can I set this up?\n\nA: It is not possible using the Ubuntu desktop CD to do this without keeping the USB disk inserted the entire time.  However, given that you have a sufficient amount of RAM, you can use the toram casper option to copy the contents of the desktop CD into memory (by using a tmpfs).\nStartup Disk Creator  will get you most of the way there.  Just be sure to use the \"stored in reserved extra space\" option.  Next, edit syslinux/txt.cfg in the resulting USB disk and put toram just before the -- in every append line except the one for \"Check CD for defects.\"\n\nA: Well, aren't live cds doing this already? I use finnix, which is debian based, a lot to do mainteinance, it can boot from CD (or USB), load itself completely into RAM and free the CD slot for use.\n", "Q: Unity mouse/keyboard shortcuts for \"wall\" and \"expo\" In Unity, is it possible to set up active borders or keyboard shortcuts to enable the \"wall\" and \"expo\" views?\n\nA: I could be wrong, but as far as I understand it, this is not currently possible with the mutter version of Unity. I know mutter supports keyboard shortcuts, but I'm not sure how they are configured (GNOME Shell has one for the overlay).\nThe compiz version will likely have shortcuts though, since compiz natively has keyboard shortcuts enabled for expo etc.\n\nA: In the current Unity it's not (easily) possible as far as I know, but I assume it will be possible once Unity is a compiz plugin (Compiz already has plugins for this).\n\nA: Yes, you can (works for me in 11.04). Since Unity now uses compiz, you can use compizconfig-settings-manager . It has a searchable interface, is specialized for customizing compiz, and restricts your input to valid options (to reduce mistakes).\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nAfter installing, you can run it with ccsm from the Alt+F2 run window. You can search for plugins by name. \"expo\" and \"wall\" will work for you.\nThis answer has a screenshot tour for setting up shortcuts for expo and scale.\nEdit: I just noticed that you tagged your question 10.10.

I have the size set to the smallest possible and would like to disable the hover animation because it's really annoying, and difficult to work with when enabled. In the least, I would like to be able to specify how many pixels it'll grow when hovered over.\n\nA: From the Cairo Dock FAQ:\n\nI find the dock too flashy, can it be more sober?\nTip: try different themes, some are already very sober, like Dust-Sand or Elementary.\n  When you can do more you can do less ! You can for instance deactivate the \"Icon effects\" plug-in,\n  or deactivate the effect on mouse hovering in \"Animated Icon\" plug-in.\nYou can also decrease the zoom effect or lower the icons' reflect in the \"Icon\" module,\n  change the background colors in the \"Background\" module, or change the view to the \"default\" view in the \"Views\" module.\n  In brief, you can easily have something as sober as a gnome-panel, but this would be a shame ! ^_^ \n\nRight click on the dock, Cairo-Dock -> Configure go to the Icons module and change the Maximum zoom of the icons setting to 1 and the icons will no longer \"grow\" when you hover over them.\n", "Q: How to extract tpb files?

My goal is to install it on 4 rarely used PCs for them to play around with, and maybe put it on their own computer some time.\nThere is some stuff I want to be the same on every computer (e.g. Thunderbird instead of Evolution, the mail-in and mail-out server of the users), and stuff that needs to be customized on every machine, like hostname, a different user on each PC...\nAlso, the computers have differently sized hard drives. Will a 10GB image pushed onto a 300GB hard drive \"break\" the file system so it seems to be only 10GB big? Sorry, this is hard to explain in English.\nDoes anyone know of a way to generate a custom image of a full hard disk sda1 as /, sda2 as swap and sda3 as  /home? Also, if I just burn the .iso on a DVD I won't be able to boot and push the image on the HDD, right?\n\nA: Archive the installation with something like FSArchiver and save that on an USB disk or network share or something, and then write the filesystem back to the disks on the 4 machines.  A good tool for this is the SystemRescueCD.\nAfter that change whatever you want to change on the systems.  (There ways to automate this sort of thing, but it's probably more work to set them up than to change things manually on 4 PCs—that would be different if you had 100 or 1000 PCs of course.)\nFSArchiver doesn't care about the size of the source/target filesystem, as long as all the data on the source filesystem fits on the target filesystem.\n\nA: There is Remastersys: here\nIt allows you to make a DVD from your installed system. The link I provided will give you all the instructions you need in detail.\nYou could also save a package list (really easy if you have apt://synaptic installed). (You can do it from the first menu).\n", "Q: OSS object oriented alternatives to oracle database I want to know if oracle style object oriented database code can be written in mysql, postgresql or any OSS database softwares.

I know most computers nowadays have access to decent graphical cards capable of running Compiz/Clutter. However, there may still be some users with old hardware.\nI know gnome panel will be supported for at least a few years, but what happens after that? Will you 'recommend' (force) everyone with old hardware to use Xubuntu or Lubuntu?\n\nA: Indefinitely, hopefully. There will always be video cards that either aren't powerful enough or just aren't supported. And there'll probably always be users (like me) who have both powerful and supported graphics but that don't want Unity or Gnome Shell.\nMoving to a scenario where you're forced to use a UI that requires accelerated graphics would be a dark day for Ubuntu.\nIt's important to note that this doesn't just apply to old graphics hardware but also new hardware that doesn't have a Linux driver (or at least one accessible in a given release of Ubuntu).\nI suspect the actual kill-date will be determined when Gnome announces it'll stop supporting the 2.x interface.\n", "Q: Indicator applet-less applications? Since I heard that indicator applets are going to replace the notification area, I wondered what was going to happen to applications that use the notification area and don't have an indicator applet?\nIs the Ubuntu team going to write an indicator applet for every application out there?\nYou can't expect the developers of applications to add that Ubuntu-only task to their list.\nDon't get me wrong, I love the indicator applets. But I'm a little concerned about this.\n\nA: \"The menu bar should contain a notification area equivalent, whitelisted to contain only notification area items inserted by Wine or Java applications.\"\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/MenuBar#Vestigial notification area\n\nA: We've been working on a transition plan for a while now. The desktop team put together a list of applications that are affected by the transition and people have started to post design recommendations, filing bugs, and fixing applications. Any help talking to application developers of your favorite applications is always welcome!\nKDE applications all work (application indicators are based on the same KSNI technology) and everything we ship on the CD is ported. Many applications are also just porting to the technology on their own. Application Indicators specifically have a fallback mechanism in place so that application authors can use them without having to break on systems that use the old notification area.\nIn Unity when I use an application that doesn't use application indicators remember that the icon for the application is sitting in the launcher too, so it's not like it totally disappears from your view, it's just not sitting in the top right of the panel.\nFor 11.04 there is a whitelist for applications that need to use the area. Users can modify this list to add legacy apps if they require it.\n(Omar has information on what will happen to other apps.)\n\nA: In addition to what Jorge said, it's important to note that libappindicator includes a fallback to GtkStatusIcon if the platform doesn't support indicators. So any gnome application could use libappindicator, and they would still have full support on platforms other than Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How do I start a second instance of a program from Unity's launcher?

This may be a silly question, but since the newer Mac systems are built on unix, is it possible to run a Mac app natively on Ubuntu? I'm specifically interested in the Coda development environment.\n\nA: They're both POSIX systems but no. Most OSX applications rely on various libraries (eg: Cocoa -- like GTK but not GTK) that aren't open source and therefore can't be ported.\nI think there has been some interest in writing a layer like Wine to replace things like Cocoa but as far as I know, nothing has ever come of it.\n\nA: Correct, both are POSIX compliant. But Unix BSD originates from the Unix source code, that belonged to AT&T. The University at Berkeley and San Diego shared the rights to this code with AT&T, the original C code. The operating system interface layer to Unix System V was published in the \"Unix SVID\" documents\" - three large volumes of how to use Unix System V - and interface to it: Interface Definition. \nThis book was compared to a number of standardisation documents at the time: X/Open and OSF had very similar definitions, and then the IEEE approved of the POSIX definition with the US DoD throwing in their \"Steelman\" requirements for a robust operating system. Xenix is like Linux an implementation from scratch of POSIX: Linus Torvald started with the skeleton and took on the task of working through the volumes, pulled through and submitted it to the IEEE for compliance verification and Linux passed. \nThe others, like SCO Unix, were approved as \"Unix\" by AT&T, and POSIX was made to be compliant to them - not that they should comply to POSIX. Mac only runs on the Intel iApX/x86 instruction set, while Linux is available on many more chips-set and \"architectures\".\nThe main difference between Mac and say Linux Mint is the file hierarchy. macOS has /Applications, /Library and /User folders - in Linux Mint/Ubuntu these are in the \"Unix\" like file hierarchy /usr/share/bin usr/share/lib and /home - big deal. Besides that, the two are the same.\nOver the years, the libraries have been named differently and placed differently. Otherwise the difference in the file systems could have been bridged with environment variables. But Apple have designed things their way, and they the systems have gone different ways.\nOn Mint - outside Ubuntu, work is done on \"Windows\" as a diversion of KDE, where a standard way of setting up the libraries are defined, and this allows development for both - see \"Homebrew\". \nBoth use the X11r4 window manager and Apple based macOS on the Xfgc from DEC, we are free to choose. But the window manager is important, since this is the way the user interface to the systems. Both Mac and Ubuntu/Mint share the icons, widgets and styles. Apple has taken a lot of the management tools for macOS, just compiled them for their hardware and used them as \"proprietary\" - compare \"Disk Utilities\" on a Mac to \"Disks\".\n", "Q: How do I set up an OpenGL programming environment?

I understand Mac and Linux both have a similar architecture, so what are the differences that prevent for example, mac applications being compatible with linux?\n\nA: Mac OS X is just basically just a special kernel (because Apple can lock down what hardware gets used so effectively, they can optimize without having to cater to myriad hardware) and a GUI pasted on top of UNIX. It's also incredibly close to completely compatible with Linux technically except for the steps Apple has taken to keep open source away. It's quite possible to drop a linux packaging system like apt-get into an OSX installation and have it work fine. \nVLC actually sued them to remove the VLC Player from the App Store because they didn't want to see them benefit financially by their \"1-way\" street of taking open code, changing it, and then locking it down.\nReally I guess I'm trying to say that OSX and Linux are more alike than either community would probably lead you to believe. And like Grayson was saying, both of them are incredibly close to their grandfather UNIX - you can effectively learn 90% of both OSX and Linux systems by just studying UNIX.\n\nA: Mac OS is based on a BSD code base, while Linux is an independent development of a unix-like system. This means that these systems are similar, but not binary compatible.\nFurthermore, Mac OS has lots of applications that are not open source and are build on libraries that are not open source. Because of this reason, it is not possible to port those applications to run on Linux without being the copyright owner of those applications and libraries.\n\nA: From using all 3 major Operating Systems (considering Ubuntu as the third, as the representative of Linux,) I can tell you that Ubuntu is very similar to Mac OS X in simplicity, also I have noticed window dialogs tend to be remarkably similar to that of which we see in Ubuntu. While Ubuntu maintains certain factors that are similar to Windows, such as the default taskbar (that is typically replaced anyhow.) \nFrom a usability respect, both Operating Systems are nearly equal.\nAs twxwikinger said, the major difference between Mac OS X and Ubuntu would have to be that Mac OS X is closed source, as he explained. \nEssentially, Ubuntu is free due to it's Open Source licensing, Mac OS X; due to being closed source, isn't. \nBeyond that, Mac OS X and Ubuntu are cousins, Mac OS X being based off of FreeBSD/BSD, and Ubuntu being Linux based, which are two separate branches off of UNIX. \n", "Q: How to use Compiz as the window manager for Unity When I tried to enable compiz, it said that I can't because of mutter.

I definitely want this, if I can at least open my media(pics, videos n all from both OS)\nLinux Root, \nLinux swap, \nLinux Home\n1.Do I really need all this?\n2.If I do need these 3 Linux partitions, considering 37GB for Linux, how would you suggested me distribute it?\nYour help is highly appreciated.\n\nA: You can use all 37gb for Linux (the installer will recommend a size for the swap partition for you). You do not need to have a seperate /home partition as the installer will preserve your settings and data if you ever need to reinstall.\nYou can then just mount your Windows partition so you can access your data right from Ubuntu. \nSince you've already repartitioned your disk it's probably not worth the effort to undo, but the Wubi installer is designed so you can have an easy to install dual-boot without having to to worry about this kind of thing.\n\nA: If I understand you right, your harddisk is looking like this:\n1. 262GiB NTFS (Windows Main + your Data)\n2. 100MiB NTFS (Windows System Files)\n3.  37GiB Unallocated Space\n\nIf this is correct, I'd propose the following setup:\n1. 262GiB NTFS (Windows Main + your Data)\n2. 100MiB NTFS (Windows System Files)\n3. Logic Partition Starts here\n    4.  8GiB ext4  /        (Linux root Partition)\n    5.  2GiB Swap  Swap     (Linux Swap Space)\n    6. 27GiB ext4  /home    (Home Partition)\n\nThe system partition could even be less, my (full of garbage) system has never grown over 6GiB and if you cleanup from time to time it never will. Important (imo) is the separate home partition, this will allow you to reinstall/upgrade the system as often as you want, without losing a single one of your settings or files.\nThe reason behind the proposed partition layout in the tutorial, is the assumption of the ideal setup for Windows (which should also have an extra data partition).\n\nA: You don't really need all of that; that said, it'll make it easier to switch between Linux installs if you use a separate /home partition. You will need a swap partition, will be installed by default. You won't need a separate Windows Data partition; you can access your whole partition from Linux if you so choose. When I was dual booting, I did! If you decide to go with separate root and home partitions, Bobby's got a good partitioning scheme. You can set those up from within the installer environment.\n", "Q: Which startup applications can I safely turn off?

I'm interested in playing with AWN and Docky, but have spent quite a bit of time getting my current layout (using native gnome panels) in a usable state. Is there any way to save the layout (i.e. which panels I have, what launchers - including custom - are on them, etc.) to a file so that if I end up not liking either AWN or Docky I can restore my original native settings without redoing it all manually?\nI'm running Maverick.\n\nA: The gnome panel configuration is stored at ~/.gconf/apps/panel, you just need to backup it up.\n\nA: There is a great script to do just that!

Why isn't Metasploit in Ubuntu's software repositories? \nMore broadly, on what basis is software chosen or not to be added to the official Ubuntu repositories? Who takes those decisions? etc.\n\nA: There are really two questions here.\nI'll answer the broader question first. The answer is \"The Ubuntu Community\".\nThere's a process for adding software to Ubuntu's archive and having it tested as part of the releases:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/NewPackages\nTo answer about metasploit, its hard to say why it hasn't been packaged yet. There is a debian \"Intent To Package\" bug filed that is 1607 days old here:\nhttp://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=323420\nIf this were ever completed, it would automatically be included in the Ubuntu universe repository. However, the bug report lists a blocker on the copyright status of some of the files. If this isn't resolved, then it won't enter Debian, and likely won't be included with Ubuntu unless the distribution legality is clarified.\n\nA: Software is chosen based on it's packaging, licensing and available maintainership. If your desired package is open source and has a package maintainer in debian that is making sure to maintain it, then it makes it's way into Ubuntu automatically.\nSee the MOTU Getting Started Guide: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/GettingStarted\nThe package you want looks like it may have an open source version, but getting it in will be a matter of working on the packaging.\n\nA: The real reason\nIt's not open source. At least not all of it.\n\nIt seems that some parts of metasploit-framework (byakugan at least) are\n  proprietary.\nWhat about doing a metasploit-framework package with the core and all\n  the free parts and a metasploit-framework-nonfree with the non-free parts?\n\nFind the contested parts here.\n", "Q: Notification of new devices on wireless network? Just wondering if there is an application that can notify me of a new device on my wireless network (IE: home computer online, mobile phone online, home computer offline, etc) so I can easily take care of the family network and jump on problems before they appear. Is this possible with Ubuntu/wireless networks?\n\nA: Not sure if that's what you need, but:\nArpwatch is a monitoring software that looks for new activities on the network, based on broadcasts emitted by computers that connects to it.\nIt basically logs each new computer activity, or when a computer changes its IP address. Logs are put on the system logs, but can be sent as email notifications.\nArpwatch is included in Ubuntu's repositories, so you can install it from synatptic, or with sudo apt-get install arpwatch\nTo configure it, you need to edit /etc/arpwatch.conf\nand add a line of the form :\neth0 -a -n 192.168.1.0/24 -m myname@myserver.com\nwhere:\n\n*\n\n*eth0 is your network card location\n\n\n*-a : makes arpwatch notify you of every new IP\n\n\n*-n : specifies the address and subnet that are of interest to you\n\n\n*192.168.1.0/24 : is your network address and subnet mask (/24 actually means 255.255.255.0)\n\n\n*-m : makes the report being sent to the specified email address (by default, notifications will be put in the syslog)\nNow the problem is that arpwatch just logs changing events (unknown computers connecting, or existing computers changing IP). It won't warn you every time your computers are connecting :-(\n\nA: You can install this applet:  service discovery applet\nand add it to your panel, this will show you all devices which publish some information through avahi/Rendezvous/Bonjour/ZeroConf. You should see all Ubuntu devices.\nBut I am not sure if you will see Windows devices.\n", "Q: HP TC4200 tablet Stylus not working on Unity interface I've installed 10.10 Netbook edition on my HP TC4200 tablet PC.  I primarily use it in the slate mode with a stylus and on screen keyboard. \nI can use the stylus as a mouse replacement for everything except for selecting the icons on the Unity-Panel and i have to use the Touchpad to select and activate the icons to launch a program from the Unity-Panel.

I suspect it might be able to help this person too however I am not sure which drivers get backported.\nI did a apt-get source linux-backports-modules-wireless-maverick-generic but this just gives me a debian directory with the packaging with no indication of what drivers get included. Where can I find which drivers get backported?\nIdeally I'd like to find a web page that has this information so I can refer to it for older releases as well.\n\nA: The problem is that you're looking at the meta package for the modules. If you use apt-cache show linux-backports-modules-wireless-maverick-generic | grep ^Depends you can see what the actual package is that contains the modules. In this case, it's linux-backports-modules-wireless-2.6.35-22-generic\nAs for a webpage, the easiest is via packages.ubuntu.com, where you can keep clicking down to get the list of files. Without a webpage, if it's already installed, you can use dpkg -L linux-backports-modules-wireless-2.6.35-22-generic\n", "Q: What is the easiest way to back-up and archive DVD's to another DVD?

One thing I miss about XFCE is the ability to move to the next workspace/desktop by moving the cursor to the edge of the screen.  Is there a way to do this in Gnome?\n\nA: Actually yes! BUT, only if you are running compiz.\nFirst you need compizconfig-settings-manager (get it from software center).\nOnce you have it installed, you can find it in the preferences menu (system>preferences).\nYou will be met with a screen like this:.\nNow, the plugins you want to edit are either Desktop wall, or Rotate Cube. Which one you use depends on the workspace switcher that you have.\nIn either plugin's configuration dialogue (click once to access it), there is the option to switch on pointer movement.\nIf you don't want to use either of this virtual desktop managment plugins, you can also switch viewports with the viewport switcher plugin.\nTo do this, click on the last tab, which contains mouse based options. The two options you want are the second and third last buttons. Click on them, and they will bring up a dialogue like:\n\nThis one. You need to check enabled (usually these options are not enabled), and then you can choose to switch based on a corner of your screen.\nAs far as I understand you cannot do this with Metacity as your window manager. However, you don't need to have all the bling enabled with compiz either. Once you have the settings manager you can disable all the useless plugins you don't need.\nHope that helps! If you don't understand something, you can leave me a comment and I'll try to explain better.\n\nA: If you're not happy with compiz (some systems don't perform well with compiz) you could also run Brightside .\nBrightside settings are made from a terminal with\nbrightside-properties\n\n\nThe applications starts by running\nbrightside\n\nThis command can also be put into startup applications to run after login.\n\n", "Q: Printing Envelopes in OpenOffice I have an Epson RX580 multi-function printer, and OpenOffice refuses to print envelopes on it correctly.  I've tried changing every setting I could, but it keeps on cutting off the return address.  Has anyone found a solution?  I had researched the matter in vain ... I'd hate to have to boot into Windows just to print an envelope!\n\nA: My other suggestion is to try glabels see here for some ideas: http://blog.worldlabel.com/2010/advanced-usage-with-glabels-labelscards-linuxgnu.html, glabels is a program designed mainly for labels, business cards and so on but custom layouts can be made with it so I think you could make a template for envelopes, its description says it supports mail merge from sources such as CSV files, vCards and Evolution data servers.\n\nA: Sometimes the printer settings will cause this, make sure you have the right paper size and orientation selected in the printer properties, sometimes the printer does not pick up the page formatting from the application, you can also export as pdf and then try to print the pdf with Adobe Acrobat reader, in the Acrobat reader print dialog, check \"Choose paper source by PDF page size\".\n\nA: It appears Ubuntu 10.10 users trying to print envelopes to an Epson RX580 printer are out of luck.  I cannot find any procedure that allows users to manually define \"page size\" in Cups. We are stuck with the Cup's defaults.  I am a newbe to Ubuntu 10.10, so hopefully there is a Cups expert out there that can help.  I would be satisfied if Cups would allow me to manually define my desired \"page size\" rather than being forced to choose from the limited menu options. \n\nA: OpenOffice stubbornly refuses to print to custom paper sizes on any printer.  One thing you can try is to change your printer driver, which will give you more standard paper sizes to choose from.\nOpen your printer properties from System > Administration > Printing and select \"Choose...\" next to \"Make and Model.\"  You'll notice there are two drivers for your printer model -- one that says \"Simplified,\" which is the default driver, and one that doesn't.  If you choose the driver that isn't \"simplified,\" then restart OpenOffice, you get a much longer list of paper sizes (including \"Commercial 10\" which is the most common US envelope).\nAlso remember that OpenOffice does not choose the paper size based on the document's page size -- you have to select it manually by clicking on \"Properties...\" in the print dialog.\n\nA: Well, I know this is not a great answer, but I'll tell what I do. I have to print custom cards at office and I have had hard experiences with a not-so-supported printer, so i just went back to the basics.\nI measured my cards and created the textboxes acordingly in OpenOffice Draw. It assumes I'm using US Letter and I just have to be careful with my boundaries. Envelopes required me to rotate the text. No problems so far. I use a template for each kind of card and it only required me some extra work at the first time.\nI understand that my problem has more to do with my hardware and as there is no other option, I'm happy with this work-around. I could even create the file for you if you really need it.\n", "Q: Postgresql 8.4 for newbies Are there any how-to's or tutorials about postgresql 8.4 fro doing following things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Logging in to postgresql\n\n*creating database\n\n*getting into database environment\n\n*adding or altering the tables\n\n\nSorry for asking this question here. I googled for 3 hrs online without being able to clarify any of my issues. I also tries the Ubuntu community wiki, it wasn't that much helpful about using a already created database.\n\nA: You can use pgadmin, a gui client for PostgreSQL for all these purpose. It is in the software center.\nHope this will help you:\nhttp://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/interactive/index.html\n\nA: I was in your position too, and I agree, it's hard to find anything at a basic enough level. Postgresql is a bit more complicated than MySQL, but it's not impossible to figure out.\nThe greatest help I've found was this article on Linode Library:\nhttp://library.linode.com/search?query=postgresql (choose your relevant OS/version)\n\nA: This may help: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostgreSQL\n\nA: I'm in a very similar spot... I have a little bit of MySQL knowledge, and having a bit of trouble figuring out the equivalents in PostgreSQL.\nI don't know if it helps any, but one thing that took me a bit to get my head around (still working on it, really) is the concept of 'roles' in postgres vs. 'users' in mysql.  Ch. 20 in the manual (linked above) talks a bit about roles.\nOther than that... I'm listening along with ya.  On my Macbook I installed PostgreSQL 9.0.1 lickety-split using a one-click installer from EnterpriseDB and fired up pgAdmin no problemo.  My first attempt at following the chicken-scratch in the Ubuntu Community Wiki ended in failure, as I think I followed the portion for the wrong version of Ubuntu/Postgres :(\n", "Q: Delete threaded mails in evolution How do I delete all emails in a thread in evolution?

Firefox and Youtube videos were working after upgrading from 10.04 to 10.10 but a couple of weeks ago, my Youtube flash video player shows up as a grey box.  The sound still works and I can hear the clip playing, but I can not see the video, or even the controls.\nThis is true for many of the flash based video players, and I think it even happens to some of the flash games out there on Firefox.\nEverything works fine on Chromium. This isn't that weird because Chromium has its own flash plugin.  However, some flash players still function properly on Firefox, like the full episode flash player on thedailyshow.com\nWhy would flash be grey box for some flash players but not all?\nI have a 32bit system, and a ATI x300 GPU card, which has been giving me problems right after updating to 10.10, but that seems to be resolved now.  I selected the allow proprietary codecs stuff at install , and then installed the Adobe Flash PPA and plugin in Ubuntu Tweak.\n\nA: I would advise removing the Ubuntu Tweak PPA from your software sources by opening the Software Centre then clicking Edit->Software Sources.... Click the 'Other Software' tab then untick the Ubuntu Tweak PPA.\nClose the software sources window and it should refresh your software index.\nUninstall any flash plugins you have installed then install ubuntu-restricted-extras. This should get flash working again.\nIn the future do not use PPAs unless you are certain of what you are doing. Note that Ubuntu Tweak is for users who know what they are doing and can mess up your system if you use it without precautions.\n\nA: The problem lies with RGBA, if you have that enabled/installed.\nTry running firefox from the terminal, with this command:\nexport XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1 && firefox\n\nA: I had the same problem with flash on my 64-bit Kubuntu box. Blocking cookies from YouTube within firefox fixed the problem for me. I hope it helps.\nYou will have to delete the already installed youtube cookies, of course, for this to work.\n\nA: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flash-aid/reviews/\nThis will painlessly give you the latest Flash. 64 or 32 bit.\n\nA: I usually find that all I need to do when flash turns into a grey box is scroll up or down a little.\nIt's been some time since flash did that the last time though.\nI have no clue why it works for me, but give it a try.\n\nA: Finally I gave up, I just reinstalled Ubuntu 10.10.  It was a clean install, and the problem was gone.  Though it solved the problem, but unfortunately I have no idea what caused the issue, and I guess now I never will.\n\nA: You could try removing the closed-sourced ATI drivers. I find that they cause more problems then they're worth, especially if your card is already supported by the opensource driver.\nsudo apt-get remove fglrx*\n\nshould do the trick.\n", "Q: How to mount a remote (over SSH) directory to be available like a local directory (incl. in shell, not just in Gnome)?

Can I mount it on my laptop to use it seamlessly from all the applications (incl command-line ones)?\n\nA: Yes indeed, you can! It's called sshfs.

I am trying to build a minimal vmware image to use for private browsing (also called a browser appliance). I have tried using images for other small linux distros, most of them are either too heavy (I do not want any other functionality than browsing and downloading) or outdated (DSL, various browser appliance images at vmware official site).\nI have downloaded the minimal Ubuntu install image (12MB) and was hoping to select only the needed pakcages while installing but it was not asking for my choices anywhere. \nI am new to the command line installation and I  would be thankful if someone could point out how to install only needed packages, and what are the bare-minimum packages to browse internet (I plan to use only firefox and  transmission)\n\nA: I recommend ubuntu-vm-builder \n(see documentation), which is really a large wrapper around debootstrap \nwhich will create about as minimal an image as you can possibly use.\n\nA: I am not sure if the \"minimal\" CD provides the minimal install option, you can do a minimal install using either the alternate CD or the server CD.\nThe minimal install will install only core components (no GUI).\nThen you can install the packages just as you need, from the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install packagename\n\nA: sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends firefox openbox leafpad pcmanfm gwget xterm\n\nthen follow this guide to add firefox to your openbox session if you need it to autostart.\nI added the extra applications because you might need them to actually work with your new \"distro\", but you don't need them and you can replace them with better alternatives.\nNB: to get a menu in openbox, right-click.\n\nA: I believe you can download an Ubuntu web-browsing appliance direct from vmware's marketplace (free)\n\nA: Well, sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends firefox should install the bare minimum requirements to run Firefox.  Somehow I doubt you want to go that minimalistic though (e.g. I'm pretty sure it won't start the graphical interface by default).\nIf you don't have the experience to install a usable system from scratch yourself yet, you could also install one of the more lightweight Ubuntu remixes or derivatives, and remove whatever you don't need afterwards.  Once you get more experienced with Ubuntu (e.g. by removing too much while following the previous suggestion ;) ), you can always rebuild an even more minimal system yourself...\n", "Q: How to sort or manually arrange Evolution Mail Account Names in Preferences? Is there some way I can re-arrange the order of Mail Account Names in Evolution's Properties dialog?  \nI find it strange that this list shows entries in the order in which I add them, and there is no facility to change this order.  \nThe column is not sortable, and there are no Move-Up/Down buttons.  \nUpdate: I'm using Ubuntu 10.04 (2.6.32-25-generic)... Evolution 2.28.3\n\nA: This issue has been addressed and you CAN re-order folders. To do so, go into Edit/Preferences/Mail Accounts. In that view you can drag folders to the order you desire, as well as select a default account.\nI am using Evolution 3.10.4 in Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: I agree with aneeshep, under Ubuntu 10.10 they are sorted alphabetically.  If the order is not to your liking, prefix the account names with numbers is all I can suggest.\nAs far as I am aware there isn't a way to manually change the order, but I am quite happy to be corrected.\nMaybe it is something that should be filed as a feature request to the evolution team.\n\nA: There is a bug filed in launchpad regarding this issue :\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/evolution/+bug/649610\n\nA: I'm currently prefixing my accounts with numbers to achieve the order I want them displayed.

Is there some way that Nautilus can be made to select multiple files as a Rectangle-select action of the mouse (Lassoo style) in the  list view? Compact and Icons view work ok.\n\nA: I don't think this is possible because of the nature of this view. \nHowever: to select multiple files I suggest you learn the Shift keyboard shortcut for selecting files \"in a row\" and Ctrl for selecting individual files \"all over the place\" as it were. You'll quickly pick these up.\n\nA: See this upstream bug report.\n\nA: This is a highly commented bug (see bug report link from htorque above) for which it appears a Nautilus developer is active in. \nHowever it seems it is not a bug that is likely to be resolved anytime soon, this is a dissapointing shock that the Gnome file manager is crippled in what seems a basic function!\nThere appears to be a preliminary Patch fix\nbut I have no idea how to use it!\nIt is a shame that such a condesending response has been given (above by fluteflute) when clearly there is a genuine issue with Nautilus, I guess using Thunar is another possible alternitive as lassoo selection in List View in Thunar (and probably other File managers too)\n", "Q: A question about git and github I have a problem.

I would really like to play m3u8 files (more specifically, http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/NTV-Public-IPS.m3u8) but when I try to run it on VLC player, it goes on to multiple .ts files with a very annoying gap between the stream. \nIs there any way I can play this stream on ubuntu just as if I were playing it on an iphone (which is what the stream is for).\n\nA: HLS-Player is the way that works for me! \n\nA: *\n\n*m3u8 files are m3u files encoded in utf8.\n\n*m3u files are a text based playlist format. You can open the file with any text editor and see the that it contains a list with files to be played.\n\n*if you open the file with vlc, it has to download every single video before playing it. Vlc does not seem to preload the files, this is why the gaps occur.\n\n\nA: Try using Banshee Media Player (please note I've not tested the stream in question). It has podcast support, and works with m3u's pretty well in my experience, so this should be no different.\nRhythmbox might work just as well actually.\n\nA: You can install these two plug-ins for firefox and see what happens:\nsudo apt-get install mozilla-plugin-vlc gecko-mediaplayer\n\n\nA: .m3u8 is a apple's live streaming format (hence it plays fine on iPhone).\nThere is finally an experimental VLC player out there with m3u8 support, try to build it and see if it works ;)\n\nA: If you really want your video to play then change the extension .m3u8 to .mp4 and that's it.

I am considering to temporarily change my repositories to Maverick, on a Lucid system.\nI want to install a newer version of Evolution because it has a particular feature I want.  \nI don't want to apply general Maverick updates.. I'm only interested in Evolution... \nMy reason for this it to let apt/Synaptic sort out the dependencies...   \nI suspect this could be pretty dicey  if I allowed anything more than just a simple single app, but even then, it may be a bad move.. \nAm I courting disaster here? \n\nA: It is not the best way but will eventually work for some little application.\nBut: evolution is definitely more than \"just a simple single app\". It has dependencies to the evolution-data-server, to many different newer gtk-libs, and so on.\nEspecially since evolution got many refactoring for the move to gnome3.\nI don't think this is a good idea.\n\nA: If for evolution only the better way would be to add an appropriate ppa e.g.:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:jacob/evo230\n\nand install from there (in case you trust this ppa). Mind that Evolution may not exactly work the same as in Maverick and that installing other dependencies may cause instabilities to your system.\n\nA: Though i would not recommend it either, there is a mechanism called pinning (Just in case you ever want to install a more recent version):\nPinning is a process that allows you to remain on a stable release of Ubuntu (or any other debian system) while grabbing packages from a more recent version.\n(https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PinningHowto)\n\nA: No, it's not safe.

Basically, is not allowing to get the videos using the old urls, so the player throws that error.\nI suggest you try my extension FlashVideoReplacer. It allows to watch YouTube, Vimeo and Blip.tv videos using totem, gecko-mediaplayer, gxine, kaffeine, mozplugger, or xine plugins. The beast feature is that it replaces the video on site, so you don't need to start standalone players or download the video. There are limitations tho. It doesn't work on YouTube channels, just single video pages and flash needs to be installed to work.\nThe extension is for Firefox, but I'm working on versions for Opera and Chrome.\n\n\nA: Like lovinglinux says: this is probably because of a change on the YouTube site by Google.  And I think the best solution would be to request a backport of that plugin from 10.10 to 10.04 (as it definitely works on 10.10).\n\nA: Hi there is a updated package available from this ppa     https://launchpad.net/~barcc/+archive/ppa. To install it from this ppa open a terminal and execute the following commands. \n sudo add-apt-repository ppa:barcc/ppa\n sudo apt-get update\n sudo apt-get upgrade totem\n\nHope this will help\n\nA: I am having this same issue in 10.04\nI installed the https://launchpad.net/~barcc/+archive/ppa repo, but the totem package seems too be the same version as in lucid updates.\nI installed totem from the repo, but still same error with youtube.\nIf this works in 10.10, how do you get the backport.\n", "Q: How to setup a mouse shortcut to raise window if it's covered by another window, otherwise lower it? I'd like to raise window if it's covered by another window, otherwise lower it, with some shortcut mouse (click + extra keys).\nKnowing that a window (that you are interested in) is in a region close of where your mouse is you can, you can scan the windows which are under your mouse.\nThis was possible before in some older GNOME desktop.

As recently announced by Mark Shuttleworth, Ubuntu will be moving towards using Wayland as its display manager.\nWhat are biggest differences between X11 and Wayland? Why will Wayland make Ubuntu better?\n\nA: Simply put, the hope is for better graphics (less buggy, faster, easier to use).\nEven things might be possible one day that were not before.\nI personally think this will at least spice up things, as competition always does.\n\nA: There are lots of differences between X and Wayland.  Probably the biggest one from the graphics side is that Wayland doesn't do any drawing.\nX has two drawing APIs.  One of these is a part of the core X11 protocol, which is ancient, useless, and nobody uses.  The other is the XRender extension which provides modern composite operations, among other things such as gradients.  This is what Cairo, for example, uses.  X also has font drawing APIs.\nWayland has no drawing APIs.  A Wayland client gets a DRM buffer handle, which is basically a pointer to some graphics memory; Wayland doesn't know or care how the client draws to that buffer.  In X terms this means that all applications get direct rendering - drawing requests don't need to go through the server.\nThe only rendering Wayland does is to copy the client's buffers onto the screen.\nIn terms of benefits, Wayland is a lot less complex than X which should make it easier to maintain - although some of this simplicity comes from pushing the complexity (eg: how to actually draw onto that buffer, network transparency) to other layers of the stack. By making clients responsible for all of their rendering,  Wayland makes it possible for clients to be smarter about things like double-buffering.\nThere are other benefits outside of graphics.  It's much easier to sandbox applications, for example.\n\nA: Two little things that anyone will notice pretty quickly in day-to-day work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wayland does away with the papercuts that were deemed too hard to fix in X11. A famous example: Using the function keys (speaker volume, display brightness etc.) while a menu is open or the lock screen is on.\n\n*Wayland is better at input devices. For one, there are many more options for configuring touchpads, including a persistent tap-to-click setting.\n\n\nA: All other posts highlight the benefits of Wayland, but it's not all good only. The biggest advantage of X over Wayland is that X works over the network. X is network transparent, you can display the window, or with XDMCP a complete session, on a terminal while the actual program is running on another, usually more powerful machine.\nWith something like Wayland, the idea for network transparency is gone.\nMaybe it's not so much required these days with fast networks and other protocols like VNC and RDP, just thought I'd mention it for completeness.\n\nA: The major difference in my eyes is that Wayland is closer to the kernel than X-Server. With the move of graphics drivers from X to the kernel (known as kernel mode setting, KMS), Wayland plans to use this new functionality to replace X. You could expect to see the following...\nLess of a footprint than X - because the display is handled by the kernel Wayland will not have to implement as much to become usable. This goes both ways as I suspect X forwarding (look at one screen on another PC) may go away with X.\nKMS features: Being able to change screen resolution without restarting X server (though I believe this was fixed in X a while back, at least for nvidia), debug console on kernel panic for intel chipsets (moving to nouveau) if you're into that sort of thing.\nCan anyone correct me on any of this if I'm wrong?\n\nA: You can see the Wayland architecture page to see how it differs in design. It's supposed to simplify the whole graphics stack by forcing everything through a standard GEM/DRM stack straight into the kernel and managing compositing itself.\nCompare that to the X stack where you have bits and bobs all over the place. Some of the X mess has been through flexible design, some have been growing pains. All the compositors (Compiz/Metacity/Mutter/KWin/etc) have been added as an afterthought. They are, at their core, hacks to do what X should probably be doing itself. If things carry on expanding outwards like they have been, we'll get to a point where the project become unmaintainable.\nAll in all, when hardware support is there, it should make the whole stack more efficient and less painful to use in standard setups.\nHowever there are a couple of issues that I haven't seen remedies for so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*X is pretty network-aware. You can send windows to other computers, you can have multiple screens with remote logins and all sorts of funky things like that. This might seem fairly specialist but it's widely used technology. Wayland appears fairly local and static in comparison.\n\n*There's also driver support. Closed-source drivers are yet to support the KMS/shared-GEM/shared-DRM technologies that Wayland thrives upon. A purist might be okay with Nouveau but somebody who pays £100-400 on a high performance 3D graphics card won't be happy with the flaky poor 3d performance they'd get with the current open driver.\nUpdate: Nvidia is working to support both Wayland and Mir.\n\n2018 update. 17.10 used Wayland as the default display server (unless you had a closed driver, or a driver that didn't support it, or needed X). 18.04 and 18.10 both use  X as global default (though you can install Wayland).\nI'm not in charge of anything but from this position, it seems like we're still a metric Nvidia away from getting real traction. Until that point, I don't think we're going to see enough mindshare and developing power get behind Wayland. The gaming/performance market is using X. The MCE market are using X (and direct framebuffers). I'm not sure Wayland will ever have a real chance.\n", "Q: Is there an Ambiance theme available for Windows? I tend to run Windows apps with VirtualBox in seamless mode (so that virtualized Windows applications windows and Windows taskbar appear alongside host OS windows instead of a separate virtual machine screen). To make the experience even more \"seamless\" I'd like Windows theming (especially windows' title bars and a taskbar) to look exactly as Ubuntu windows look. So it seems that I need a Windows clone of Ubuntu Ambiance theme. Is there one?\nI'm ok to have Windows minimize/maximize buttons on the right, as I've switched Ubuntu to the same classic mode.\nI am interested in both Windows XP and Windows 7 themes.\n\nA: Have a look at this omgubuntu blogpost.\n\n\nA: Yes, you can download it here.

Is it valid if I mark a bug \"Fix Committed\" if the package in question is hosted upstream (outside of Launchpad)?\nexample: bug report, committed fix.\n\nA: \"Fix Committed\" means developers have figured out a working solution to a problem, and have it merged into their development repositories. \nThe problem will be delivered in updates when the bug is marked \"Fix Released\" for your Ubuntu version.\n\nA: You shouldn't need to do this by hand. If you set a bug watch Launchpad can monitor upstream bug reports and set the status automatically. For this to work the project upstream needs to have it's bug tracker registered in Launchpad. (You can always add more if it's missing)\nWhen you do this Launchpad will then track the bug in Ubuntu and upstream. That makes it easier for developers to find bugs that have been fixed upstream and not yet fixed in Ubuntu.\nIn your specific case wajig didn't have it's bug tracker registered in Launchpad. I went ahead and did that. Unfortunately the project in Launchpad isn't set to use the external bug tracker. You can probably contact the person who registered it to change it so that it points to the actual upstream wajig tracker, which will make it easy to link bug reports in the future.\nSince that STILL doesn't solve your original problem I left a comment in the bug report; which will hopefully point the right people to the problem.\n\nA: You can find a list of Launchpad bug status definitions the way they are used in the Ubuntu bug tracker at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/Status. Normally, for Ubuntu package tasks, \"Fix Committed\" doesn't correspond to \"the fix is upstream but not in Ubuntu yet\"; for that you can usually just set a bug watch and let Launchpad deal with it, as Jorge suggested. \nNote that some Ubuntu teams assign different roles to certain Launchpad functions, including bug status; this can initially cause some confusion. If you're consistently triaging bugs in a particular component, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the way the team responsible for that component does bug triage.\n\nA: No, Fix Committed is when the fix for said bug has been fixed in the code repository that the project uses.\n\nA: Launchpad defines the status Fix Commited as \"Fix Committed: a developer has committed his/her fix to the project's codebase.\" This means that the bug has been fixed by a developer, but it was not yet released, so you won't see that it has been fixed, until it gets into the state Fix Released.\n", "Q: Where can I find wayland? Mark Shuttleworth writes that wayland will be replacing X in the future in Ubuntu.

I'm looking for something similar to iPlotz or Mockup.\nI've found the Pencil Project, but it requires xulrunner-1.9 (which seems to be incompatible with xulrunner-1.9.2) in order to run as a standalone application. It can be used as a firefox plugin... but it is a bit slower.\nThe error on my desktop (Ubuntu 10.04) is: Could not find compatible GRE between version 1.9.1 and 1.9.2.*\nDoes anyone know other software?\nEdit: Open-source software is preferred, and it doesn't matter whether or not it's free.\n\nA: After some research, I found Dia, and it's exactly what I was looking for: simple, open and stable.\nMaybe I explained my needs badly.  More than just software to design layouts, I also needed something that provided the ability to build flowcharts. I tried ArgoUML, too. It looks great, just a bit complicated.\n\nA: Try Balsamiq. It uses Adobe Air and runs properly on Ubuntu.\n\nA: Maybe it's not so sophisticated, but you could also try Gazpacho, an UI designer.\nIt's in the repositories.\n\nA: As of Pencil 1.2 it runs on xulrunner 1.9.2 (I'm on Ubuntu 11.04 64-bit).\nFirst install xulrunner 1.9.2 :\nsudo apt-get install xulrunner-1.9.2-gnome-support \n\nIf you're still having problems or you're on 64-bit, run it like this:\nxulrunner /opt/pencil/application.ini \n\n\nA: I did a bit of digging and found this. According to it, after you install the latest version of Firefox and Pencil (Pencil's latest version does not come in deb by default, so get the rpm and install with alien -i <rpmname>), edit the application.ini from the Pencil folder in /usr/lib and change the max version mentioned to the version of Firefox you have (the main release version is sufficient, e.g., 16). Then edit usr/bin/evoluspencil, which is nothing but a script to invoke xulrunner. Change /usr/bin/xulrunner to /usr/bin/firefox. Now opening Pencil from the applications menu will work just fine, and Firefox needs not be open for it to run.\n\nA: WireframeSketcher is a rapid wireframing tool for Eclipse-based IDEs like Aptana, Zend Studio and the like. It also comes as a standalone version for all major platforms including Ubuntu. Give it a try.\n\n", "Q: How will Wayland be delivered? Mark just announced support for Wayland in Ubuntu in future. I was just wondering the following (hopefully Mark can answer). \n\n\n*\n\n*When will a version be available to test?\n\n*Will it be available as a package(s) in the repository or will it be delivered as its own distribution?\n\n*When do you expect it to take over as the default?\n\n\nA: Mark stated that they will be able to deliver something in 6 month ( that means Ubuntu 11.04 ). \nThat may mean that there will be a way to install Wayland ( from repository ) and replace X with that; probably only for test purposes.\nAlso, according to Mark X application will continue to run under Wayland in a sort of  compatibility mode.\nGraphics toolkits should be ported from X to Wayland to be 100% native (Qt is almost there), so I believe that we won't see Wayland as default before Ubuntu 12.10.\n(Qt on Wayland)\nhttp://virtuousgeek.org/blog/index.php/jbarnes/2010/09/20/qt_on_wayland_first_clock\n\nA: There is a Maverick PPA containing Wayland packages: (but I'm only allowed to post one url)\nThere is no reason it would be a separate distribution.\nI have a script to build Wayland on Ubuntu Maverick here:  http://www.chaosreigns.com/wayland/ubuntu.html\nAnd more info about Wayland here:  (but I'm only allowed to post one url)\nThere has not even been a source code release of Wayland yet, it's only available via git repository.\n\nA: As most probably know by now, Mark decided to drop Wayland and make their own display server called Mir. Basically because with their Unity project, they want to have a consistent display stack across all devices (desktops, laptops, tablets, phones, TVs, etc...) and wanted to have more control over this development.\nYet another reason not to get ahead of yourself and to wait for the actual release. I have a bad habit of taking something like Marks earlier post on Wayland and running with it and have been disappointed many a time.\nMore on Mir:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mir/Spec     \n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir_(software)\n", "Q: What does dsfg as a part of package names mean?

It would also not be very beneficial right now. What I gather from the information, I have seen so far, wayland does not yet have enough feature implemented that it could be just plugged into an Ubuntu or Kubuntu Desktop.\nHence, currently it is more something for developers to test out, who probably have no problems to just build the tarball, or clone a branch directly from the git repository.\n\nA: I just found this: https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ppa\nAnyway, don't know how to use it =P\n\nA: This might be the closest you're gonna get.\nAgain, sounds like its not currently far enough to be useful to build.\nhttp://wayland.freedesktop.org/building.html\n", "Q: Linkedin to broadcast How add Linkedin to broadcast?\n\nA: The broadcast tool (called Gwibber) needs to support this.

I would like to backup my mail directory on a USB key.  However, my IMAP has a strange naming convention that something include a colon (:) character.  Since the USB is in a window format, rsync fail to create those file.  Is there a way to replace the colon character by an underscore when running rsync?  (Or to do the same synchronization with another tool?)\nJust a few point that I clarified in the comments :\n\n\n*\n\n*This is a worst case scenario backup, I would like to be able to read it on a windows machine without installing anything.\n\n*I got a lot of data that stay constant.

I am looking for a existing tool that can be used out of the box.\n\n\nThanks\n\nA: Use rdiff-backup instead of plain rsync. It will automatically detect and substitute for characters that aren't supported on the destination disk, and also put them back as they were when you restore to a unix filesystem.  It produces an unpacked directory  that looks just like the origin plus one extra metadata directory.\n\nA: The most straightforward approach is to leverage the filesystem layer to transform the file names. Since Ubuntu 12.04, there is a FUSE filesystem that transforms file names into names that Windows's VFAT supports: fuse-posixovl .\nsudo mount.posixovl /media/sdb1\nchown guillaume /media/sdb1\nrsync -au ~/mail /media/sbd1/\n\nOr to avoid requiring root access:\nmkdir ~/mnt\n/sbin/mount.posixovl -S /media/sdb1 ~/mnt\nrsync -au ~/mail ~/mnt/\n\nCharacters in file names that VFAT doesn't accept are encoded as %(XX) where XX are hexadecimal digits. As of POSIXovl 1.2.20120215, beware that a file name like %(3A) is encoded as itself, and will be decoded as :, so there is a risk of collision if you have file names containing substrings of the form %(XX).\nBeware that POSIXovl does not cope with file names that are too long. If the encoded name doesn't fit in 255 characters, the file can't be stored.\nPOSIXovl stores unix permissions and ownership in files called .pxovl.FILENAME.\n\nThe following bash ≥4 script copies ~/mail/foo:bar to /media/usb99/mail/foo_bar, and similarly for all files under ~/mail. Files that already exist in the destination tree and that are not older than the source are skipped.\n#!/bin/bash\nset -e\nshopt -s dotglob globstar\nfor source in \"$HOME\"/mail/**/*; do\n  target=/media/usb99/${source#\"$HOME\"/}\n  target=${target//:/_}\n  if [[ -d $source ]]; then\n    mkdir -p -- \"$target\"\n  elif [[ $target -ot $source ]]; then\n    cp -p -- \"$source\" \"$target\"\n  fi\ndone\n\nThis script works under zsh with minor modifications: replace shopt -s dotglob globstar by setopt dot_glob and [[ $target -ot $source ]] by [[ ! -e $target || $target -ot $source ]].\n\nHere's a zsh two-liner (three if you count the autoloads). It's shorter, but fairly advanced and not very readable.\nautoload zargs zmv\nzargs -- ~/mail/**/*(/e\\''REPLY=/media/usb99/${${REPLY#$HOME/}//:/_}'\\') -- mkdir -p --\nzmv -C -Q -o -pu '~/mail/(**/)(*)(.)' '/media/usb99/mail/${1//:/_}${2//:/_}'\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The zargs line is equivalent to mkdir -p ~/mail/**/*(…), except that it won't bomb out if the cumulated length of the directory names are too long. That line creates the target directories as necessary.\n\n*~/mail/**/*(/) expands to all the directories under ~/mail (directories only due to the (/) at the end).\n\n*(/e\\''…'\\') selects only directories and further executes the code within '…' to transform each file name, which is stored in the REPLY variable.\n\n*${${REPLY#$HOME/}//:/_} removes the prefix corresponding with the source directory and changes : into _.\n\n*zmv -C copies each file matching its first operand (a zsh pattern) to the file name obtained by expandingg its second operand.\n\n*-o -pu says to pass -pu to the cp utility, so as to preserve permissions and copy only updated files. (We could tell zsh to perform the update check; it would be a little faster but even more cryptic.)\n\n*(.) selects only regular files. -Q says that this is to be parsed as a glob qualifier and not as a . with parentheses around it indicating a subexpression.\n\n*$1 and $2 in the replacement text match the parenthesized expressions (**/) and *. (** loses its special meaning as zero or more subdirectory levels if it's in parentheses, unless the parentheses contain exactly **/.)\n\n\n\nI initially thought to use pax, which is an archiving tool\n(here intended to be used in pass-through mode) that has a file renaming feature (its -s option). However, the -s and -u options do not work together (the POSIX definition of pax literally says that -u must check a file of the same name in the destination tree, rather than the file name transformed by -s; the pax implementation in Ubuntu follows the spec literally rather than usefully). It's still possible to make use of it to make renamed hard links, and then copy the hard links (with rsync -au or pax -rw -pp -u) to the other media, but it feels more trouble than it's worth.\ncd ~/mail\nmkdir -p /media/usb99/mail\npax -rw -l -pp -s '!:!_!g' . ../mail.colonless\nrsync -au ../mail.colonless/ /media/usb99/mail/\n\n\nA: You could use tar to create an archive. This way you don't have to change the names and can save it to whatever filesystem you want.\n\nA: What I do with my USB memory stick and mobile USB disk is partition them with 2 partitions: a FAT32 one and an ext4 one.  The first one I can use to exchange data with non-linux users, the second one for my personal use with my Ubuntu systems (and maybe for exchanging with other linux users).

But playing 1080p youtube/streaming sites with crystalhd is flawless. i hope anyone can point why totem is not friendly with crystalhd in some cases. \ninstalled lastest crystalHD from git..\n\nA: The driver for BCM lives in linux-firmware-nonfree. Install that! It should cover you for GStreamer-using media players. Totem, the default video player in Gnome+Ubuntu is GStreamer-based.\nYou might need to run sudo modprobe crystalhd now to load the driver (it should do this automatically on the next boot).\nIf that doesn't work, you could build the modules yourself. It's not hard and it's fairly well documented. Download the zip from their support page and read through the readme.\nI confess I don't know the status of other media players. I did think mplayer and xine had both made progress but I could be wrong.\nAs for Flash, even if Adobe were shouting support from the rooftops, I wouldn't believe it until I'd seen it.\n\nA: As of tonight, i've been able to succesfully have hardware acceleration in Flash Player (youtube 1080p videos running smoothly). I've detailed my instructions here:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I get Flash 10.2 RC + Crystal HD for HW accelerated video to work?\n\nA: I have got it up and running very well on AO532h with Ubuntu Natty. I had to compile from a git snapshot though from here:\nhttp://git.wilsonet.com/crystalhd.git/ (I used 2011-01-23 one). Acceleration with Flash (10,2,154,18) works without problems, as well as in totem (GStreamer).\n", "Q: Remastersys: how to make the .iso smaller than 700MB? I'm trying to create a Live CD .iso image of my Ubuntu 10.10 installation with Remastersys.\nThe problem with this, is that it creates .iso's of about 750-770 MBs, I need the images to be less than 700MB so that I can burn the .iso on a CD.  \nHow can I do this? Can I remove some programs or some features of Ubuntu to lessen the space? \n\nA: You could use a base install of ubuntu (from the alternate CD), and then install the applications you need to make up your system.\nYou can also remove some of the unnecessary packages (documentation, etc) from the default install that you don't want.\nI've not been able to make it below 700MB before, but I've come close (I had to install some other apps in that situation unfortunately).\nAny way you do it, it will produce a safe iso so long as you don't remove the base system (ubuntu--minimal's dependencies should be a good guide).\n\nA: Yeah it is pretty close to impossible when considering the default cd size before install for Ubuntu is 695 MBS so that gives you 5 mbs to play with, not much room to play... just about anything would push you over 700 mbs...\n\nA: If you remove programs you will save space, you can also remove documetation, background images, themes and so on, this will save space.\n", "Q: How do I enable the Compiz Atlantis effect?

A while back there was a lot of talk about Canonical implementing subtle transparency in GTK for Ambiance and Radiance themes - Is this no longer on the agenda? Was there a hold up?\n\nA: The problem with implementing rgba currently is lying with the applications that run on the gtk+ library. However, with the switch to gtk+ 3 it is likely that Ubuntu will inherit this feature as a default option.\nI'm sorry I don't have a link to hand, but the feature was not dropped, just hindered.\nEDIT: Here is a link that indicates the possibility of rgba as a feature of gtk3 (which Ubuntu uses as of 11.10).\n\nA: It seems like it's, at most, a back-burner issue. There are no blueprints from the Natty Narwhal Ubuntu Developer Summit. The last UDS I've found about it discussed at was for Maverick (blueprint here), in which it was dropped from the beta and listed as \"POSTPONED\" with no mention of which release it was postponed until.\n", "Q: Is there software that can recognise which musical notes I am playing into my microphone - to help me practice music? To help me practice music, I'd like to make a sound (hum, sing or whistle into my microphone) and have the corresponding note displayed on screen.

Upstart doesn't like to start gunicorn because it tries to call setpgrp (see github issue), what would be the best way to start [gunicorn] on a 10.04.1 server install? - Ideally with automatic restarting of the failed main process and multiple workers. On the gunicorn site they mention [runit] and [supervisord], is it worthwhile installing another kind of process supervisor alongside ubuntu's upstart?\nI'll document progress here after exams if someone doesn't come up with a better solution.\nOK I've tried:\nrespawn\nrespawn limit 10 5\n\nexpect daemon # also tried expect fork\n\nexec python /path/to/manage.py run_gunicorn --daemon\n\nbut I can't seem to get the job to start, it just hangs? nothing shows up in ps aux | grep manage or the syslog, I'm guessing upstart isn't catching the fork properly. Is it because I'm using manage.py instead of gunicorn directly? I'll give running it directly a shot as soon as I get a chance.\nClarification: manage.py is from a django 1.2 instance with gunicorn as an installed app, but no special settings in settings.py (I don't know the syntax for specifying gunicorns port/address/workers in settings.py so I was planning to just use cmdline args)\n\nA: I've just commented in the github issue as well.\nSince there seems to be some issue with setpgrp and gunicorn, you may have better results if you run it with\nexpect fork\nAdded to the upstart job definition.\nso something like\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\n\nrespawn\nexpect fork\n\nexec /path/to/gunicorn --daemon\n\nShould work well.\n'man 5 init' is a wealth of information and should help understand why things work this way.\n\nA: We just pushed a patch to Gunicorn master [1] that will allow you to use Gunicorn with Upstart.

Because backports always have higher version numbers than the other pockets, if they are enabled, they will be preferred.\nHowever, this has actually changed in recent Ubuntu versions. For the 10.04 (Natty) release, we changed apt so that it only installs backports if they are specifically requested (which you can do by adding the -t oneiric-backports (or similar) flag to apt-get.\n(None of this is affected by the order of entries in your sources.list files; those are only used if multiple lines provide the exact same version of a package, in which case we fetch it from the first-listed one)\n\nA: in short yes (they take precedence). once a package version is higher, it is used by default unless you change your system's preferences.\n", "Q: Docky Bookmarks AND Mounted Drives Plugins won't work I recently installed KDE in Ubuntu, and to my surprise, Docky works in KDE (dunno really).

When I do\nsudo umount /media/KINGSTON\n\nI got \numount: /media/KINGSTON: device is busy.\n\nI close all the windows and make sure all shell are pointing to other directories.  How can I find which process is preventing the umount?\n\nA: The most useful tool is lsof . It shows what files are in used by what processes. If /media/KINGSTON is a mount point (the device name would also work), the following command shows all files that are in use on this mount point:\nlsof /media/KINGSTON\n\nIf you run this command as an ordinary user, it will only show your own processes¹. Run sudo lsof /media/KINGSTON to see all users' processes.\nThe output from lsof looks like this:\nCOMMAND   PID   USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF   NODE NAME\nzsh4    31421 gilles  cwd    DIR    8,1     4096 130498 /var/tmp\nzsh4    31421 gilles  txt    REG    8,1   550804 821292 /bin/zsh4\nzsh4    31421 gilles  mem    REG    8,1    55176 821326 /usr/lib/zsh/4.3.10/zsh/complist.so\nzsh4    31421 gilles   12r   REG    8,1   175224 822276 /usr/share/zsh/functions/Completion.zwc\n\nThe COMMAND column shows the name of the program executable and the PID column shows the process ID. The NAME column shows the file name; you might see (deleted) if the file was deleted while open (when a file is deleted, it no longer has a name, but it still exists until the last process using it closes the file). USER should be self-explanatory. The other columns don't matter here except perhaps FD, which shows how the file is used by the process:\n\n\n*\n\n*cwd: current working directory\n\n*txt: the program executable²\n\n*mem: a memory-mapped file (here, think of it as an open file)\n\n*a number: an actual open file; a subsequent letter indicates the opening mode, such as r for reading and w for writing\n\n\nThere is no mechanical way to locate the window where a file is open (this is in fact not technically meaningful: if a process has several windows, a file is not particularly associated with one window or another), nor even any simple way of identifying a process's window (and of course a process doesn't have to have any windows). But usually the command name and file name are enough to locate the offender and close the file properly.\nIf you can't close the file and just want to end it all, you can kill the process with kill 31421 (where 31421 is the process ID) or kill -HUP 31421 (“hang up”). If plain killing doesn't do the trick, kill with extreme prejudice: kill -KILL 31421.\nThere is a GUI for lsof, glsof, but it's not quite ready for prime time yet, and isn't packaged for Ubuntu so far.\n¹ \nLsof can list some information about other users's processes, but it doesn't detect the mount point so won't list them if you specify a mount point.\n\n² \nExecutable code is often called text in discussions of executable formats.\n \n\nA: Meanwhile the fuser command has much improved. You can do the full job with a single command:  \n$ sudo fuser -ickv /\"mountpoint\"\n\nWhere:\n\n\n*\n\n*parameter k kills the offending process, \n\n*while v shows in advance the process and its user\n\n*and i asks you for confirmation.  \n\n\nIf some process resists, then try again with fuser -ickv -9 (or more generally with -SIGNAL) that kills the most stubborn ones.\nBut you will always find some \"immortal\" process...!\nIn this cases I lately learned to use\n$ sudo umount --lazy --force <mountpoint>\n\nas a last resource, that up to now worked for me every time.\n\nA: open a terminal:\nfuser -c /media/KINGSTON\n\nIt will output something like this:\n/media/KINGSTON/: 3106c 11086\n\nThis will give you the pid of the processes using this volume. The extra character at the end of pid will give some extra info. ( c in  3106c)\nc - the process is using the file as its current working directory \nm - the file is mapped with mmap \no - the process is using it as an open file  \nr - the file is the root directory of the process \nt - the process is accessing the file as a text file \ny - this file is the controlling terminal for the process \nSo to unmount just kill that pids and re-try the unmount \nsudo kill -9 3106 11086\nsudo umount /media/KINGSTON\n\nNote: To find the exact application name of these pids you may use this command\ncat /proc/<pid>/cmdline\n\nFor example :  cat /proc/11086/cmdline\nthis will output something like below.\n    evince^@/media/KINGSTON/Ubuntu-guide.pdf^@\n\nHope this will help\n\nA: Also this can help: \nlsof | grep \\/media\\/KINGSTON\n\n", "Q: Why is rsync recopying a lot of file when I sync to an USB key?

Using partimage (package available from the repositories) is a better option.\nBecause partimage does not have integrated FTP support you would need to use something like curlftpfs. I am not sure it would be reliable. FTP was designed to upload files previously created, not to update them incrementally.\n\nA: Other tools you might want to check out are tar and rsync. Creating backup tarballs is simple and there are lots of preconfigured lines out there.\nRsync might be your best bet. It does incremental backups and takes lots of options (again, look around for an rsync oneliner that does what you want). It doesn't result in one file though, but an exact copy of the folder structure and files.\n\nA: Use this while logged into your ftp server via the ftp command:\nput \"|dd if=/dev/DISK0 bs=1m count=1000|bzip2\" backup.bz2\nof course, replacing DISK0 with your disk.\n", "Q: How to force Skype's Panel icon to show Skype's main window in workspace 4 specifically?

This is less a question to the developers of Unity and Canonical than a question about Ubuntu itself so please excuse me if this question doesn't belong on this site.\nWhile the question seems to speak for itself, maybe the word install script is a little abstract; I'm talking about a script which not only checks for the required dependencies but also patches gnome libraries and such.\nAs a programmer, I know this is a lot of work and I can't ask the Ubuntu developers to spend their time on other distributions but, in the case that an install script is entirely impossible, there should at least be a document with guidelines on how to install Unity, patch Gnome and what is required to take the necessary steps.\n\nA: An install script would have no use for others distribution. Unity itself uses a standard build system, so yes, it should be build on other distro as long as the build depends are met. As for the gnome patches those would need to be incorporated by other distributions in their packaging, this is not something that could be done externally with a script.\n\nA: If the wider external community likes unity enough, someone might write a script, port it, package it, etc, but that's a bit out of scope for the unity developers to think about really.\nHowever it is up to the developers on whether to support other distributions, and with the work involved, unlikely to happen directly, unless GNOME changes their attitude toward canonical (again unlikely; Red Hat vs Canonical is the main reason for the whole issue, if we are honest).\n", "Q: Installing e text editor I am trying to get e-text editor to run.

Primary monitor has a resolution equal to 1280x1024 and the second has 1920x1200. My gdm login screen always appears on the second monitor even if it is switched off. My question is how to force gdm to show the login screen always on the primary monitor with resolution 1280x1024?\nI use Nvidia GT9500 videcard in Twinview mode. I can't use Xinerama because vpdau doesn't work correclty in this mode.\nWhat I have found is that mouse pointer always appears in the center of union of the screens and center is always on the monitor with higher resolution. Login screen always shows where mouse cursor is.\n\nNow my primary monitor has a resolution equal to 1920x1080. The problem still persists, mouse cursor always appears in the right-bottom corner of the second monitor. \n\nA: For newer versions of Ubuntu such as 13.10 or upgraded 13.04 using Gnome 3.8, this procedure is different because the X configuration file no longer controls the monitor layout. You must do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set the monitor layout correctly as a logged-in user (see Permanantly set monitor as primary)\n\n*Copy the configuration file over to the gdm settings\ncp ~/.config/monitors.xml ~gdm/.config/\n\nFor more details, see https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=161903\n\n\n*Within the monitors.xml file there are tags labeled: <primary>something</primary>\nFor the monitor you want to be primary put a 'yes' in between the tags and a 'no' for all other screens.\n        ex: <primary>yes</primary>\n\nA: are you using a Nvidia card with a dual-screen setup?\nIf so, I had the same problem, and solved it the following way: Switch off the computer, unplug the second monitor, switch the computer back on, run 'sudo nvidia-settings', plug the second monitor back in, run 'Detect Displays' in the Nvidia GUI, and make the necessary configurations before saving the settings. The IMPORTANT point is that the screen that you wish the login to show up in is set to 'Screen Number: 0'.\nIn my case, leaving the second monitor plugged in before running 'nvidia-settings' left it as screen 0 for some reason, but by plugging it in after, this was sorted.\n\nA: If twinview does it the same way the ATI catalyst control center does it, there is a xorg.conf you can edit with gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf\nThe relevant part of mine looks like this:\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier     \"amdcccle Layout\"\n    Screen      0  \"amdcccle-Screen[1]-0\" 0 0\n    Screen         \"amdcccle-Screen[1]-1\" 1400 0\nEndSection\n\nAll you have to do (after backing up your xorg.conf of course) is change the ServerLayout by swapping the Screen entries (and adapting the screen numbers), in my case that would be:\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier     \"amdcccle Layout\"\n    Screen      0  \"amdcccle-Screen[1]-1\" 1400 0\n    Screen         \"amdcccle-Screen[1]-0\" 0 0\nEndSection\n\n\nA: You can try \"Separate X screen setting\" on the NVIDIA X Server settings.

In this file you can put the names of all the files that you would like to be hidden, one per line.\n\nA: If you place a full stop (or period) at the beginning of the name of the file it should hide it, for example:\n.helloworld.txt\nTo view your now hidden file, click \"view\" on Nautilus then check \"Show Hidden Files\".\n\nA: If you and the program don't care about the name of the file, try this command:\nfor annoyingbak in *.bak; do mv \"$annoyingbak\" .\"$annoyingbak\"; done\n\nThen run it whenever you're annoyed by the .baks.

Never do that. Check the Community Help:  \n\nYou should never use normal sudo to\n  start graphical applications as Root.\n  You should use gksudo (kdesudo on\n  Kubuntu) to run such programs. gksudo\n  sets HOME=~root, and copies\n  .Xauthority to a tmp directory. This\n  prevents files in your home directory\n  becoming owned by Root. (AFAICT, this\n  is all that's special about the\n  environment of the started process\n  with gksudo vs. sudo).\n\n\nA: sudo -H GUI-application-program\nIn Ubuntu (17.10) 17.10.1 and probably future versions of Ubuntu, gksu and gksudo are deprecated. They work in Xorg but not Wayland. But you can use sudo -H to run GUI application programs without damage to your configuration files. Do not use plain sudo.\nIf you are running Wayland (the new graphical system that replaces Xorg), you need a command with xhost too.\nxhost +si:localuser:root       # if Wayland\nsudo -H nautilus --no-desktop\n\nSee the following link for more details,\nWhy don't gksu/gksudo or launching a graphical application with sudo work with Wayland?\n\nA: sudo by default preserves your $HOME variable.  For example, if you run sudo firefox you will run with root privileges but your configuration.  If you change settings in this situation, you will end up with parts of your configuration owned by root instead of your user id.\n\nA: Taken from here:\n\nYou should never use normal sudo to start graphical applications as\n  root. You should use gksudo (kdesudo on Kubuntu) to run such programs.\n  gksudo sets HOME=/root, and copies .Xauthority to a tmp directory.\n  This prevents files in your home directory becoming owned by root.\n\nPlease note that this is primarily about configuration files. If you run Nautilus as root, even with gksu/gksudo, and you create a file or folder anywhere with it (including in your home directory), that file or folder will be owned by root. But if you run Nautilus (or most other graphical applications) as root with sudo, they may save their configuration files in your home directory (rather than root's home directory). Those configuration files may be owned by root and inaccessible when you're not running as root, which can severely mess up your settings, and may even keep some applications from working altogether.\nThe solution, once you have made this mistake, is to find the configuration files and delete them or chown them back to belonging your non-root user. Many such files start with a . or are contained in a directory that starts with a .. Some are located inside the .config folder in your home directory. To see files and folders that start with a . in Nautilus, press Ctrl+H (this shows hidden files.) To see them with ls, use the -a (or -A) flag.\nTo find if there are files not owned by you in your home directory, you can use the following command in a terminal: \nfind $HOME -not -user $USER -exec ls -lad {} \\;\n\nwhich will list all files under the home directory not owned by the user. \n\nA: If you choose gksudo nautilus, You ask your password graphically. With sudo, you ask it in a terminal\n\nA: Found in the file generated by the terminal command 'info gksudo':\n\ngksu is a front-end to su and gksudo is a front-end to sudo. Their primary purpose is to run graphical commands that need root without the need to run an X terminal emulator and using su directly.\n\nI have found that, in many cases, the 'info' files have helpful descriptions as well as useful information on options. I would strongly suggest that learning about any command first start with accessing the 'info' file on that command.\nFor the beginner, in the terminal, type or paste the command info with the command name in which you are interested as a parameter. The format is info [command_name] (remember not to include the command prompt or the brackets). Suggested terminal entries for the beginner are:\n$ info\n$ info info\n\n", "Q: Where can I find Vagrant packages? Vagrant is a tool to build and manage virtual machines for developers.

So you end up with different results.\nThe first thing to do is to test you can record sound at all, use the sound recorded to test this and make sure to adjust the settings in System > Preferences > Sound\nOnce you know the sound input works, next you just need to use padsp in front of your command above, for instance:\npadsp mencoder tv:// -tv driver=v4l2:width=640:height=480:device=/dev/video0:forceaudio:adevice=/dev/dsp1 ...\n\nThis command makes a /dev/dsp access for your command on the fly and pipes the sound via pulseaudio. See details here:\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man1/padsp.1.html\n", "Q: Where can I find Ubuntu Posters? I'd like to put up some posters around where I go to school, where would I find some great looking posters, flyers and tips on advocacy?\n\nA: It might be useful to contact your Local Community Team and ask if they have any professionally printed posters or flyers available.  (We do!)\nThe LoCoTeam might also have info about localised poster & flyer designs, and other promotional material.  Or they might want to cooperate with you in having something printed (printing in larger volumes is a lot cheaper).\n\nA: In addition to the above, you can also organize a Software Freedom Day event. Some of the flyers / posters / etc. are generic enough to be used year-round.  You can find some of those at:\nhttp://wiki.softwarefreedomday.org/StartGuide#Useful_Documents.2C_Templates.2C_Files_and_Examples\n\nA: You can find lots of marketing materials on Spread Ubuntu, they have some great looking SVG posters which can be downloaded and edited using Inkscape. You may also be interested in joining the Ubuntu Marketing Team or the Ubuntu Art Team which are both involved in created posters and logos.\n\nYou can also find some nice materials on openclipart, while not Ubuntu related they do have svgs which are useful for making materials.\nThere are some good designs available in the Ubuntu deviantArt group, but be careful of the licensing which is shown on each work individually.\nDon't forget to upload your own results after editing to share with others. If it's Ubuntu specific, then spread ubuntu is a great place to upload to.\nAn important note to consider when making Ubuntu posters is the licensing. Make sure to only get your source materials as either public domain (such as openclipart) or free creative commons licenses such as CC-BY and CC-BY-SA. This will guarantee that you can continue to collaborate and share your work with others without restrictions.\n", "Q: Converting 10.10 desktop iso to alternate iso Is there any utility available to convert ubuntu-10.10-desktop-i386.iso to alternate cd image file?\n\nA: I do not know what you mean by \"convert\". You may want to use zsync to download alternative cd using desctop cd as a base:\nzsync -i maverick-desktop-i386.iso http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily/current/maverick-alternate-i386.iso.zsync\nIn that case zsync will download only those parts of alternate cd that are different from desktop one. \n\nA: In short, no.\nThe alternate CD has the compressed .deb packages & the installer from Debian, whereas the desktop CD has a squashfs image of an unpacked filesystem, which is copied over. The compression used is different, so rsync or zsync won't work well.\n\nA: I don't think that is possible since they provide different installers, also that would require to recreate the install packages from the livecd image, which would be too complex.\n", "Q: What specs would a tablet need to run painting apps (mypaint, etc.) well? I want to pick up a tablet or touch-enabled laptop to use for drawing and painting with a stylus. But I'm not sure whether one of the convertible netbooks from Asus and others would have the guts to drive the graphics apps well. (I generally use mypaint, gimp, and inkscape.) What do people think would be a minimum usable hardware configuration? By usable, I mean being able to make a quick stroke with a stylus on a reasonably large mypaint file and not have lag in its appearing on the screen. Is the issue mainly ram? Can any of the mobile (i.e., netbook) processors do the job? All of this is, again, assuming that I'm running Ubuntu.\n\nA: The main limitting factor is your memory, screen resolution can effect the responsiveness too. I'd say a 2Ghz Core2 with a 512MB Video card and about 2GB of RAM should do well for medium sizes (3kx4k) and large complex vector images.\n", "Q: Best hardware choices for multi-seat (multi-user) system? We are building a multi-seat or multi-user system. The budget for the entire system is around $2000. The tower should be around $800. Each user will probably only use the computer for web browsing (keeping flash to a minimum), however, there can be almost no lag. The system should support at least eight, preferably a maximum of 12, depending on how much of the budget is left ($160 per user). The central tower computer itself will be assembled manually. \nWhat hardware should be used? So far, the plan is:\n\n\n*\n\n*at least 1gb ram per user\n\n*an AMD 8-core processor (Opteron Magny-cours)\n\n*a compatible (g34) motherboard with several PCI slots\n\n*a large hard drive\n\n*a well-ventilated case\n\n\nAre these good choices? Would other hardware be better?\nAlso, each user requires a video card. Would it be possible to share a two output multi-monitor video card between two users?\n\nA: I think 2000 USD for 12 users might be somewhat cheap, but OTOH, the multiseat systems I'm most familiar with support Compiz and OpenGL FPS games... on a 14-user system.  ;)\nStill, 12 monitors + 12 keyboards + 12 mice would cost 1500 € around here, and probably close to 1500 $ in the US?  But 1000 €/$ for 8 \"seats\" plus 1000 €/$ for the machine itself might be doable.\nTo have multiple users on one display adapter, you'll probably need to run nested X servers like xephyr (or XGL if you want 3D support, but unfortunately that's not officially supported anymore, and only works with nvidia adapters).\nAlternatively, you can use USB graphics cards.\nAs Stefano says: using two 4- or 6-seat systems might be useful, as you could use one as a backup for the other and vice versa then.\nMemory is important, but you don't need the minimum for a single user system × number of seats.  Eight people running Xorg or OOo will have the Xorg or OOo application itself in memory only once, as only the user-specific parts (e.g. documents) are different.  This also depends on the type of applications that are going to be used.\n\nBTW: I'm not sure if you are selling this to somebody, but you should also stress the long term financial benefits.  A local company here in Belgium that sells quite a bit of multiseats and is a sponsor of our LoCoTeam once computed the benefits of a class of four 6-seat multiseats with Ubuntu compared to a class of Windows desktops as follows: 800 € / year saved on the electricity bill + software licensing cost saved the first year of > 2700 €, and in addition almost 800 € saved in licensing cost during the following years.  And that didn't even include the savings on the hardware bill...\n\nA: Proc is overkill =P, assuming main use is browsing/office, both will be heavyish on disk io/memory vs CPU (at least for me my browser regularly exceeds 1G mem heh)\nMaybe use 2 cheaper boxes (each $300ish) and an option is displaylink video adapters, they could be cheaper than individual graphics cards\nA system supporting up to 4 users, you could probably add more usb vga adapters, but it would be pushing it\n\n\n*\n\n*$300 desktop\n\n*$100 vga adapters ($33 ea x 3) (usb/pci/pcie), might need 4 if can't use onboard at same time\n\n*$600 kbd/monitor/mouse ($150 ea x 4)\n\n\n$300 desktop (priced from newegg):\n\n\n*\n\n*Foxconn M61PMP-K AM3 ($50)\n\n*AMD Athlon II X2 250 Regor 3.0GHz ($60)\n\n*Micro ATX Tower Computer Case with PSU ($30)\n\n*Crucial 4GB (2 x 2GB) 240-Pin DDR2 SDRAM DDR2 800 ($80)\n\n*Western Digital Caviar Green WD10EADS 1TB 32MB Cache ($80)\n\n\n1 less core per user than your 8core scenario, but double the diskio and half the load per machine. Biggest cost still appears to be kbd/monitor/mouse for each user, not really worth trying to make the desktop/central server cheaper.\nAlso with two redundant systems backups etc are a bit easier, worst case if a box dies is half the class/room is without computers.\nHeh I did something similar a few years back but used LTSP and a server booting several (tested 20) eeepc's as network clients, load on server is very low (apps are run local, disk is network mounted from server) but everyone gets same apps and remote home dir. Graphics was good being local, but access to usb devices e.g. gps's etc proved difficult.\n", "Q: How to pretend to browse from a different country? How to pretend to browse from a different country for view Streaming Online Television From Another Country or to use programms that don't work in my country or to Buying (shop). \nEdit:\nThe best solution until now (11/2012)I thing, is to use the add-on AnonymoX with firefox.  \n\nA: you can use tor proxy to browse internet anonymously. Check this link for more info:\nhttp://maketecheasier.com/install-tor-in-ubuntu/2010/07/06\n\nA: Vassilis, in order for your computer to be registered in another country you will need a computer in that country. For instance watching the BBC iPlayer can be done by having a computer in UK and paying the TV license (obviously). It helps if you're a resident who is visiting abroad as a home address makes this easier.\nThe best method I've found of using a proxy is the ssh tunnel method which is documented here: http://embraceubuntu.com/2006/12/08/ssh-tunnel-socks-proxy-forwarding-secure-browsing/\nThis assumes you have a computer in the target country of course.\n\nA: If you use Firefox you can go to Add-ons - Extensions and download and install an extension Hola Better Internet and after it is installed you will see its icon in the upper right corner. Click on it and choose country you want to vpn to. Done.\n\nA: In short, your internet connection IP address already identifies you to a specific country. In order to look like you are coming from another country, you need to contact another computer in the country you want to be seen as, and FROM THIS computer, launch the actual connection to the targeted service. The service has to see that the source IP address is from the right country. \nUsually, this means that you either use a service such as TOR that will redirect your connections from all over the world, or have a computer in the right country, that you can completely control, or at least that you control enough to launch another connection from it. TOR might be your best bet.\n\nA: Using the proxy server, You can pretend as acting from different countries like Japan, Canada, USA etc.. It helps to change my IP and also hiding the original IP address by showing a fake IP address. This makes to view the online television streaming from any country or use any programs like Buying (shop) etc..

Please indicate a method or Ubuntu software for printing on CD/DVD surfaces.\n\nA: What you need is a good CD cover template for your printer.\nThen you can use any program you want to make your cd label. Everything from gimp, openoffice draw to inkscape or scribus. There is also a program specifically for labels called glabels which may already have a good template you can use.\nI have an SVG template which I use with my Canon iP5000 which positions the CD image on a page size the printer is expecting. I developed the template with a lot of trial and error using a non-printable cd which I could wipe the ink off and try again and now I can happily make CDs in inkscape, export to PDF and print them out.\n\nA: I have found a solution by creating a user-defined template in gLabels Label Designer (v. 2.2.8). I just defined dimensions of CD table of my Epson R285 jet printer, without changing any values regarding print margins. When you print on CD/DVD select in Print Source pull-down menu 'Print to CD' option.\nV.\n\nA: The use of CD jacket printing allow the customers to create their products look more good-looking and beautiful. Moreover, it brings out the best person artistic thoughts out in the open, so that everyone could advantage from it.\nhttp://www.emanprinting.net/cd-jackets-printing.php\n\nA: I have an Epson R265. To print to a printable CD/DVD I used Inkscape. \nI opened Inkscape and selected the provided CD template (File - New from template - CD label). Created my artwork using the template and clicked - File - Print.\nIn the print dialogue I selected the R265 as the printer to print to. The current drivers provide all the print to CD options you need. \nIn the print dialogue under the Page Setup tab set Paper Type to - Inkjet paper and Paper Source to - Print to CD. Under the Advanced tab set Shrink page to - Crop. \nThere are numerous other printer parameters you can fiddle with, but that is basically it. When you create the artwork you should put your graphics and text on layers above Layer 1 (which shows the disc outline) and then before printing hide Layer 1, otherwise it will print the circles of the outline as well as your artwork. \nThis is not quite as fool proof as using the Epson utility under Windows, but it is pretty simple.\n", "Q: How to change the Caffeine icons in panel when using the Elementary theme When I use the Elementary theme 2.0 the default Caffeine icon is displayed in my top-panel.

Here I have filed a public bug report on launchpad. There I was informed that it is a duplicate of an already reported bug. I was adviced not to shift to ubuntu 10.10 netbook edition in an answer to the question I posted here. By turning off the network services, wireless and also after some tests, I strongly believe that it is caused by the wireless driver. The wireless card is: Atheros AR2427. I have to install the drivers manually by executing this command: \nsudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-wireless-maverick-generic\n\nThere is no response on the bug report page. The issue has become a big pain. Many times I have lost very imprortant work because of that bug. Please suggest some solution. If there is no solution, atleast tell me how can I avoid system freezes.\n\nA: Unfortunately it looks like that card isn't supported yet, but you could try these instructions.\n", "Q: How do I change the Deskbar Applet panel icon? Is there any way, to change the Deskbar-applet-panel icon? I have checked in /usr/share/deskbar-applet/art, but none of those icons seem to change the panel icon or is there a different path for the icon(s) to be found.\n\nA: Check one of those:\n/usr/share/icons/hicolor/16x16/apps/deskbar-applet.png\n/usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/deskbar-applet.svg\n/usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/deskbar-applet.png\n/usr/share/icons/hicolor/32x32/apps/deskbar-applet.png\n/usr/share/icons/hicolor/22x22/apps/deskbar-applet.png\n\n(Found those by running sudo dpkg -L deskbar-applet.)\n\nA: The deskbar applet icon is managed by your icon theme. If you change your icon theme, it will also change your applet icon. However if you just want to change that particular icon, you can modify the theme by doing:\nlocate deskbar-applet. - this will give you all locations of files with the name deskbar-applet, and now you can change the icon files under your themes' directory(ies).\n", "Q: Gnome- vs Unity-panel (applet) compatibility? I just love the indicator-applet and other parts of the Ayatana-project and think Ubuntu has done an awesome job there. And as the question about applet compatibility seem to be answered as a 'no' I'd like to take the question to the next level - the 'why' and 'why not'.\nHow come these Ayatana-applets today work in gnome-panel but gnome applets won't work in the Unity panel?\nAnd - as it's connected - why not make them compatible? Isn't it all about usability?\n\nA: Many of the gnome-applets you are familiar with use old technologies like Bonobo, etc. To bring them up to a modern standard, they would need to be rethought/rewritten/etc from scratch using newer technologies such as D-BUS.\nMaking the applets compatible will not improve usability but just backwards compatibility. Furthermore, \"Ayatana-applets\" as you call them, are not \"applets\" in the sense you might be thinking, but are indicators (see here). With the amount of work that would be required for bringing the old applets into new technology would be rather pointless (to quote the Bible indirectly, it's like putting new wine in old wine skins), since GNOME 3 will be basically make these obsolete.\nIt would also be of note that GNOME Shell will not support these old applets either.\n", "Q: How to tell thunar to stop using my device? When I do\nsudo umount /media/KINGSTON\n\nI got \numount: /media/KINGSTON: device is busy.\n\nBy using \nfuser -c /media/KINGSTON\n\nAnd \ncat /proc/<pid>/cmdline\n\nI found that the process is thunar--deamon.  I closed all file manager windows.  When I try to umount it by right cliking on the desktop, it also gave an error :\nAn application is preventing the volume \"KINGSTON\" from being unmounted\n\nI am affraid that killing Thunar is going to impact other process running in other terminal.  How can I tell it that I don't need this usb key anymore so it stop using it?\n\nA: If you know that the media device is synchronised (there're no outstanding writes), then use the -f switch to umount (force unmount).\nFrom the unmount man page, the -l switch does a \"lazy\" unmount, which detaches the filesystem now, and cleans up all references later. \nsudo umount -f /media/KINGSTON\n\nor\nsudo umount -l /media/KINGSTON\n\n", "Q: How to open ssh://username@hostname link I want to open link like \"ssh://username@hostname\" with ssh.\nI think xdg-open can help me(xdg-open ssh://username@hostname), but I don't know how.\nHow can i do it?\n\nA: What I could gather, you have to register the protocol in the gconf:\ngconftool-2 --set --type=bool /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/ssh/enabled true\ngconftool-2 --set --type=string /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/ssh/command 'gnome-terminal -e \"%s\"'\ngconftool-2 --set --type=bool /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/ssh/needs_terminal false\n\n(source)\nI can't get it to register ssh in chromium though. Haven't tried with firefox, but these instructions should help.\n\nA: You can open the ssh link on the command line by using ssh username@hostname (I think you know this already) if you want to access it via nautilus in gnome then you can minimise all windows and do [ctrl]+L which will open a dialog. Type in your url ssh://username@hostname and click open.\nThis should solve most of your problems. xdg-open can only open the url if the url has been mounted somewhere already. Otherwise it can't access the ssh files.\n\nA: if i understand your question correctly then i think you want to open such link in gui mode. To open such links in nautilus just replace ssh with sftp\nopen nautilus and type sftp://user@host in address bar and press enter\n\nA: I was looking for Gnome support for ssh:// links that we use at our work on our internal websites.

But when I create a new wine prefix (or use PlayOnLinux to do so) it uses the default ugly grey-and-blue windows 95 theme. \nIs there a way to change wine into automatically using my own theme, i.e. the ambiance theme for new wine prefixes?\n\nA: Unfortunately Roland is right, you are probably best doing this manually at the moment.\nHowever, it is possible to change Wine's system-wide default registry settings by editing /usr/share/wine.inf -- this is the registry that new Wine Prefixes get created with.  I'm not sure how to add a theme in there, although you could look at the registry of a current Wine install after you change the theme for hints.\n\nA: You cannot make wine use this theme automatically, due to limitations in both Wine and Playonlinux. If you look into your ~/.Playonlinux directory you will see that there are wine versions downloaded by Playonlinux, but unfortunately, the format they are in doesn't make it possible to apply a theme in this manner.\nYour best bet is to apply the theme to your prefixes manually after installation, and possibly to make a request on the Playonlinux forums for such a feature.\n", "Q: How to install Wacom Bamboo Pen I have a new Wacom Bamboo Pen.

I installed the nvidia driver version 256.53 for compatibility issue and now work great. I followed multiple tutorial to fix the very ugly plymouth boot, but no one support 1366x768, and only support 1024x768. Can I get a normal plymouth with the nvidia driver?\n\nA: These two solutions to this similar question rely on hardware support.  Specifically, they rely on the VESA modes available in your video BIOS.  This should always contain the default VESA resolutions but it's also possible for the laptop or video card manufacturer to add extra resolutions - such as 1366x768 - to this table.  Sometimes manufacturers don't add any extra resolutions here, as it's only useful for really old applications that want to use the VESA system or when proper drivers aren't installed.\nSince at boot time we have no video driver available, just the VESA calls, we're limited to the resolutions in the VBIOS.  Anything else needs to wait until a hardware driver is loaded which can do proper resolution setting.\nFor the open-source drivers which support KMS we can load these early during startup, so we get a proper resolution quickly.  The nvidia and fglrx drivers need to wait until X is started, by which time there's no need for a splash screen.\n\nA: On my current and my previous laptop I could only use the 1024x768 resolution in grub and plymouth. This is probably because the drivers needs X to show a higher resolution.\nAnyway, there is no way to change that, you will have to live with \"only\" 1024x768 until gdm starts.\n", "Q: I am unable to login to my Ubuntu machine or reinstall I started my laptop one day and I got a warning message before the login screen saying (Use/lib/libconf2-4/gconf-sanity-check-2 exited with status 256).\nTrust me, I checked Google and all Ubuntu forums to find the answer to this before posting my issue here.\nI found that many people have had the same issue but none of their sulutions worked for me.\nmostly cause:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can't login using gnome so I have to use the command line.\n\n*Everytime I sudo I get something about soduers mode not being 0440 (when I looked that up and tried to change the mode as some forums suggested, I got an error saying permission denied.)\n\n*I tried to 'su to root' to fix that but then i get something about authentication being wrong!\nSo it looks quite shut from everywhere and I am REALLY lost.\nI dont mind reinstalling Ubuntu and having all data erased, I already have everything saved on a hard drive, but when I put in the Ubuntu Install CD, it ejects it before booting from it and refuses to boot from any other CD as well.\nPlease help me out I have been trying for 3 weeks now and this is honestly my last resort .\nThank you so much in advance.\nI love Ubuntu and I want it back.\n\nA: You might want to check your BIOS settings if you can't boot from a CD.

This is more a journey of understanding for me... and I wan't to understand if gksu is valid for konsole or kate, or must I use the KDE variant kdesu..   \nHere are some results of some tests I've just tried.   \nFrom user fred's terminal, launch gnome-terminal\n\nsu style   resulting            custom   (ls)   new file\ncommand    prompt               prompt   home   ownership\n---------  -------------------- -------  -----  ----------\nsudo      .root@DT:~#           fred's   fred   root\ngksu       root@DT:/home/fred#  root's   fred   root\nsudo -i    root@DT:~#           root's   root   root\nsudo -s   .root@DT:~#           fred's   fred   root\n\nThese results don't agree with the Ubuntu Documentation Page, where it says:  \n This prevents files in your home directory becoming owned by root\n\nUPDATE: The XAUTHORITY env variables for the sudo and gksu invoked Terminals are different (as mentioned on the Ubuntu Documentation Page)  ..\nsudo    #### XAUTHORITY=/var/run/gdm/auth-for-fred-RsngLK/database\nsudo -i #### XAUTHORITY=/var/run/gdm/auth-for-fred-RsngLK/database\nsudo -s #### XAUTHORITY=/var/run/gdm/auth-for-fred-RsngLK/database\ngksu    #### XAUTHORITY=/tmp/libgksu-xR2OGn/.Xauthority   \n\nThis shows that gksu is definitely not the same as the sudo -s command I referred to in the question ... and therefore anwers my otiginal question (in some still obscure way) ... and Chris's answer certainly got me thinking hard on this one! ... I need a coffee!!\n\nA: sudo is for command line apps, gksu/gksudo for graphical ones\n\nA: gksu is basically a graphical frontend for sudo that allows graphical command to be run without the need to run an X terminal emulator and using su directly. It's effectively just a GTK+ skin for the superuser commands.\nSo if you wanted to run a GUI based program as root, you would invoke it with gksu cmd, rather than sudo cmd, which is used for invoking console programs as root.\n\nA: sudo -i resets the login environment to the target user (root, in this case). Mainly, it is that the HOME environment variable is changed, which means the target user's ~/.bashrc is loaded.\ngksu is, therefore, like sudo -i in that is switches $HOME to the root user.\n", "Q: Login timeout disable? How can I disable automatic timeout entries in the login screen?  Allow me to explain.  My typical experience goes something like this: I put my laptop to sleep, then wake it.  When it wakes, it comes up with the login screen.  I type in my password and it will usually reject it, with a message indicating the login timer has expired.

I need to find out where the freezing is coming from. noapci, noacpi, nomodeset, etc... don't make a difference to the situation.

But, the \"box\" characters (around the entries) are never displayed correctly. I guess most fonts simply don't have that character set. Is there any way that I can add these characters? Maybe even copy them from the default unicode.pf2 font?\nIf this is not really possible, do you know of any fonts that have got these characters?\nUpdate:\nI have tried a lot of different things, such as converting from ttf to bdf and then to pf2, and I have tried converting only the ascii characters with the option --range=0x0-0x7f, but none of them seemed to make it work perfectly. I have a feeling that it is because I'm generating a larger font than the default, and the default glyphs therefore cannot be used. \nI will try to see if I can get it to work with a smaller font size, though this were one of the reasons I wanted to change the font.\n\nA: In theory grub-mkfont allows passing multiple fonts.  In this case if you can pass a link to Unifont or another font with wider coverage at the same time.  The produced Grub font will be a combination of the coverage of both input fonts.\nNote: a recent performance improvement to the Grub boot-time font loader means that the glyphs in a Grub font file must be in a specific ascending order, but unfortunately the change was not made to the grub-mkfont utility at the same time!  This is now a bug:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bug #729470 \"grub-mkfont outputs fonts that grub cannot use (font characters not in ascending order: 0 <= 0)\"\nBTW, if you're interested, this bug was discovered because of experiments with investigating use of the Ubuntu Font Family in-development Ubuntu Mono font in the Grub boot menus and hitting exactly the same problem that you've just hit!\n\nA: IIRC I ran into what you describe when using all glyphs:\n\n(source: xrmb2.net) \nMaybe it's an issue with grub-mkfont, maybe it has to do with the font, I don't know. :(\nWhat worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using gbdfed to generate the 'bdf' file from a console font (eg. '/usr/share/consolefonts/Lat15-VGA16.psf'): File > Import > Console Font, then File > Save As...\n\n*Converting only the ASCII characters with grub-mkfont:grub-mkfont --output=out.pf2 --range=0x0-0x7f out.bdf\n\nA: If you run grub-mkfont with the -v flag it will show you how many  glyphs you get. If you get more than a thousand, the border character ought to  be in there. Limiting the range will only make things worse. The DejaVuSansMono font displays all the characters correctly and it has over 3000 glyphs in the .pf2. Many other fonts get the arrows right but not the border.\n\nA: use a unicode font.. That worked almost fine( such as arialuni.ttf, shows all characters as required).. My problem is with the little bigger character spacing...and that happens with every font I tested. \n\nA: Basically what you want to do is use the range operator to limit the characters that your new grub font contains. If you don't use the range operator then you're going to get all the glyphs including the erroneous or incorrect box elements from your target font.\nFor example:\ngrub-mkfont -s 16 --range=0x0-0x7f -o /boot/grub/grubfont.pf2 font.tty\nWill generate a font with only ASCII characters, anything your font doesn't have should decay gracefully to the default font so boxes and arrows should come from the default. Please see this website for further information:\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20100429235139/http://grub.enbug.org/gfxterm\n\nA: You can get this to display correctly by loading both the default font and the desired font.\nThen, set the font to the desired font.\nWhen the characters for the box are not found, the regular font which is also loaded will act as a default and the needed characters will be supplied.\n\nA: I realize this thread is ancient, but I was reading it today and came up with another answer not yet provided... so here it is:\nIf you're getting odd characters in GRUB after changing fonts, it's because those characters didn't exist in the .ttf file you used to create the .pf2 file.  \nThe characters used to create the border are:\n\n\n*\n\n*U+2501\n\n*U+2503\n\n*U+250F\n\n*U+2513\n\n*U+2517\n\n*U+251B\n\n\nThe other commonly missing characters from a .ttf file are the arrows which are:\n\n\n*\n\n*U+2191\n\n*U+2193\n\n\nYou can use FontForge (open source software) to copy and paste those characters from a .ttf which has the characters included to the .ttf you're trying to use which does not.  After generating a new .ttf with FontForge you can use grub-mkfont to create your .pf2 file that has all of the appropriate characters.\n", "Q: Two external hdd but one does not get recognized I have two HDD on my ubuntu machine.

My laptop also has vista installed. Would it be possible to somehow run ubuntu (virtually?) while windows is running without having to restart the laptop?\n\nA: Yes, this is possible. VirtualBox can virtualize an operating system that already exists on a physical partition.\nHowever, this is not recommended. When you installed Ubuntu, it configured everything based on the hardware it found during installation. When you load it in the VM, it will find all sorts of other hardware and may need massive reconfiguration.\nThat being said, you can find a tutorial that does something very similar to what you are trying to do here: http://www.neowin.net/forum/topic/784138-howto-boot-existing-ubuntu-partition-using-virtualbox-inside-windows/\n\nA: I don't believe You would be able doing this using wubi alone. You need to install a virtual system like virtualbox and then you could create an Ubuntu vm in it. You wouldn't use wubi though, but rather a usual Ubuntu iso.\nhttp://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/virtualbox has instructions how to do this.\n", "Q: Why doesn't BURG replace GRUB? BURG looks a lot better and user friendly than GRUB, at the same time it get the job done. \nWhy Ubuntu have not switched to it?\n\nA: BURG is a one-man fork of GRUB.  GRUB is the primary project with an active development community.  I don't intend to ever switch Ubuntu to BURG; I would rather focus on improving GRUB.\nLook at the commit activity of the two projects (quickest way: bzr log lp:burg vs. bzr log lp:grub/grub2).  BURG has only had five commits in the last six months - to all intents and purposes, it's moribund.  Over the same time period, GRUB has had just over five hundred commits.\nBURG did some useful things with themes, although GRUB has most of that - it just doesn't ship them by default, which IIRC was due to licensing problems.  BURG supported a different installation mode which helped some people, but now that GRUB has Reed-Solomon encoding and the ability to skip certain sectors in the boot track this shouldn't generally be needed.  There are a handful of other small improvements.  None of them justify losing the fantastic GRUB community.\nIncidentally, I'd thoroughly encourage reporting the reasons you feel BURG is superior to GRUB as bugs on GRUB.\n\nA: Because BURG is not ready to be deployed on this many machines. It's very early in it's development, and I'm sure later on, say when they have reached a beta version, people will start to look into it. \nCheck burgs Project Page on Launchpad to keep up with development(s).\nAs people have pointed out, the boot loader can be considered the most important part of a system. If it doesn't work correctly, none of your operating systems will start. This is why this type of software has to be extremely mature before it gets deployed on a massive scale.\nColin Watson (one of the Ubuntu grub maintainers) also has more information in his answer.\n\nA: Another, more current reason why BURG might not have been switched to is that it appears to be an abandoned project. The last commit to trunk as of this writing was all the way back in 2010.\nWithout continued development, new features and - more importantly - bug fixes to make BURG work better with newer hardware and software simply aren't happening. Unless development resumes or the project is forked, there's little chance it will be accepted.\n", "Q: How can I install Ubuntu on my Playstation 3? I'd like to use the Cell processors in a PS3. Given the changes to PS3 firmware recently, what is the best way to get Ubuntu installed on a PS3?\n\nA: If you have upgraded your firmware since the removal of the 'Other OS' feature, then there is no official way to install Ubuntu (or any other Linux distribution) on your PS3.\nThere was an unofficial SDK released for the PS3, which would possibly allow you to reinstate the feature, but I'm unsure of any possible legal issues so I won't link to it here.\n\nA: Oh sorry for the outdated link,\nHow about this..?\nhttp://gizmodo.com/5143547/how+to-install-ubuntu-on-your-ps3-for-vintage-gaming-emulation\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=316047\n", "Q: How do i get alert if someone tries to access my system? I am using ubuntu 10.04.I want to get an alert when someone tries to access my sytem.For example if someone access my system as an ssh user i want to get an alert in my system.How to get this type of alerts?\n\nA: fail2ban is probably the one tool you'll want for this. It works by parsing the logs of popular services (ssh, apache, etc) and looking for login failures.\nWhen it finds a certain number of failures (ie if it sees somebody trying to brute-force their way in over SSH) it can update iptables to block the attacking IP. It can also send out emails to notify you (as you ask).\nYou can read more about setting it up from here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fail2ban but there are lots of pages on the internet telling you how to do more with it. It's not a simple tool.\nOther than that, for any service, if you move it off to an unpredictable port, people will be much less likely to just stumble upon it and be able to start brute forcing it. I run my all my SSH servers in the 40000-50000 port range. I have fail2ban installed too but I've never had anybody find the SSH server yet.\nOf course this isn't useful for any service (http will always be expected on p80 for example) so if you're maintaining other users, you have to consider how much extra effort changing the port will cause them.\n\nA: I answered a similar question about running a script on ssh login/logout.  Of course that only works for SSH logins.\n", "Q: Where are release notes from security updates that were installed in the background? My Update Manager is set up to download and release security updates silently in the background. Therefore release notes are no longer displayed. I wonder if there is a way to read the release notes later. How could I find out which updates were installed recently and what bugs are fixed?\n\nA: The results of unattended-upgrades are logged at /var/log/unattended-upgrades. Though this will not contain the changelogs; it will show you what has been upgraded. You can then use one of the methods mentioned by others to see the actual changelogs.\nYou might also be interested in the apticron package. It can be set up to email you about any packages on the system that need to updated. This email will include summary of changes in each package generated by apt-listchanges.\nBy default it will mail root. If you don't have this set to forward to a real account already, edit /etc/apticron/apticron.conf, to set the email address:\nEMAIL=\"foo@bar.com\"\n\n\nA: You can find information on most, if not all, security updates right here:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/usn\nFeeds are available for use in your RSS reader, or you can also subscribe to a mailing list. Both are linked to on that page.\n\nA: This is not as easy a proccess as it could be.\n\n\n*\n\n*Identify the packages that have been upgraded\nIn Ubuntu 11.04 go to the Ubuntu Software Centre, and look in the History section (from the left hand side) and then at the top filter to look only at Updates. This will show you what updates were installed when, and which versions to.\nIn Ubuntu 10.10 do as above to identify which packages were upgraded and when, but it doesn't tell you the version numbers.\nIn Ubuntu 10.04 you will need to use Synaptic's history function, because the Software Centre hadn't yet included this functionality.\n\n*Visit the Launchpad page for a package. For instance for update-manager this is at launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/update-manager. From the links in the top right of that page you can view the complete changelog (launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/update-manager/+changelog)\n\nA: From what I heard so far I feel that all put together may give a sufficient anwer to my question:\n\nFind out which package has changed\n\n\n\n*\n\n*List /usr/share/doc with Nautilus in \"List View\" mode sorted by \"Date Modified\" to give you a list of packages and a date when changes were made.\n\n*or check Software Center resp. Synaptic for a history as fluteflute suggested. \n\n*or check /var/log/unattended-upgrades resp. run Apticron following andrewsomething's answer\n\n*if only security updates are of interest read USN according to Jacob's answer\n\n\n\nRead Changelogs of packages in question\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Open usr/share/doc/PACKAGENAME/cangelog.gz or changelog.Debian.gz where all release notes are listed mostly the same as in Launchpad.\n\n*or go to Launchpad and read there (see fluteflute's answer)\n\n*or let apt-listchanges do the job (see andrewsomething's answer)\n\n\nWhich way ever you choose you will be able to see what packages were changed and you can read the changelogs. None is as easy to perform as reading during an attended update but maybe just going to /usr/share/doc is almost.\n", "Q: sudo tasksel remove lamp-server What is the command I ran and now I have no ubuntu left...\nWhen I which the computer on, the monitor comes on, it goes passed the grub screen, it does not show anything after that.  How do I fix this?\n\nA: I haven't tried this myself, but it may work. I don't really know what you mean by \"I have no Ubuntu left\" and how much of Ubuntu you are missing.\nTake a look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Tasksel \nThe first thing i would try is to run...\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^\nIt may help. If not, let us know.\n\nA: According to this bug report, tasksel behaves badly when removing packages. It seems that it removes many packages that it shouldn't, which can leave the machine in an inconsistent state.\nPackage Removal (A Better Way)\nTo remove something that you installed with tasksel, you need to mention the packages specifically. For example:\nsudo aptitude remove apache2 apache2.2-common php5-common mysql-common\n\nThe theory is that removing these packages will cause the other parts of each system to also be removed. However, a manual search through Synaptic would still be beneficial.\nThis answer gives a much more detailed listing of what needs to be removed if you're trying to remove the LAMP stack.\nRecovery\nTo recover from tasksel's over-zealous removals, you have to reinstall the affected packages. In some cases, installing ubuntu-desktop will do the trick:\nsudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop\n\nTo be more thorough, open up the Ubuntu Software Center and look through your removal history (see screenshot) to find the packages that were removed at the same time that you ran tasksel remove. You can then reinstall those packages.\n\n\nA: This is a common bug with ubuntu (see #574287). \nI was recently faced with the same issue.

For example I am running the Climate Prediction project and it runs for a year or so, I'm at 30% work done so I want to backup that 30% work done.\nAlso as an addition to this, can someone advise me the best way to upgrade BOINC when new versions are released on their website but are not available on the PPA yet.  I know you can install BOINC anywhere, but I want to install it to the same place the PPA install does so all my settings and work done is recognised.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I think that everything about \"How to Backup\" you will found here: http://www.boinc-wiki.info/Backup_BOINC\n\nA: You probably want to backup two places:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/boinc-client - your settings\n\n*/var/lib/boinc-client - projects, work data and logs\n\n\nYou need to shut down the boinc-client before the backup, copying a data file while it is in use can easily give a corrupted copy.\nNote that if you backup from one boinc-client version and try to resume from a different version (which could happen under a reinstall), the backup may not work properly on the new client. \nThe \"official\" way to do a clean shutdown is\n\n  \n*\n  \n*In Boinc Manager select the project and then click on \"No New\n  Tasks\"\n  \n*In Boinc Manager select each WU you have not started and click\n  \"Abort\".\n  \n*Once the last WU has finished crunching, if it still says \"Ready to\n  Report\" then select the project\n  and click \"Update\"\n  \n*When there are no longer any tasks displayed in the Tasks tab,\n  select the project and then click\n  \"Detach\"\n  \n\nAlternatively, you can use the command line tool boinccmd.\n", "Q: How can I configure Ubuntu/GNOME to accomodate my keyboard/mouse habits from Windows? I've primarily used Windows, but recently switched to Ubuntu/GNOME at work.\nIn my Windows setup, the context menu is triggered on the release of the right mouse button; in my Ubuntu/GNOME setup, it's triggered on the press. This is causing me pain because apparently I've developed a habit in Windows of right clicking a bit early, i.e. while still moving the cursor. This has no undesirable side effect in Windows, but in my Ubuntu/GNOME setup, the click immediately brings up the context menu, and the residual movement can sometimes highlight a menu item, and the button release will then act on that selection.\nIn other words, in Ubuntu/GNOME, where as my intention is just to bring the context menu, I instead accidentally selected some menu item (usually the top most) and execute it. How can I prevent this from happening? Can I make Ubuntu/GNOME bring the context menu on release of right mouse button, the way I'm used to in Windows?\n\nAnother habit I've picked up is that I use Alt-F,S to save documents. Now, some editors (e.g. Eclipse) are \"smart\" in that it knows if a file doesn't need saving, and will disable the Save menu item in that case. Regardless, Alt-F,S would \"work\" in that it's a no-op (just like Ctrl-S would be). That is, even though Save is disabled, hitting S would still close the File menu, it just wouldn't save the document.\nHowever, in Ubuntu/GNOME, when the Save menu item is disabled in Eclipse, Alt-F,S would get \"stuck\" on the File menu. Since Save is disabled, S would just not do anything, and the File menu stays open.\nI know I can just try to switch to Ctrl-S instead, but can I just configure Ubuntu/GNOME to let me try Alt-F,S even if that particular menu item is disabled? (just ignore the action, just like Windows does).\n\nBy the way, I'm open to using another window manager if necessary.\n\nA: The first question involves code changes to gnome, as far as I know there is no way to change this behaviour without code changes. you might want to report a bug.\nThe second question is a problem with Eclipse/Java.\n\nA: try kde, is more windows-like, gnome is more mac-like\n", "Q: Software Centre - where did my \"Other\" items come from? In the Software Centre, under Installed Software, I have a number of packages marked as coming form \"other\". Where might these have come from? The libdvdcss2 entry does not surprise me, but I have no idea where the qt and update-manager entries have come from.\nAs far as I'm aware I have never installed these packages from a PPA, or installed them manually.\nUpdate: After taking the screenshot I removed the qt packages because I don't actually need them. However the output of $ apt-cache policy update-manager is:\nupdate-manager:\n  Installed: 1:0.142.21\n  Candidate: 1:0.142.21\n  Version table:\n *** 1:0.142.21 0\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     1:0.142.20 0\n        500 http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ maverick-updates/main i386 Packages\n     1:0.142.19 0\n        500 http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ maverick/main i386 Packages\n\nI'm wondering if it could be to do with the maverick-proposed repository.\n\n\nA: The version which is currently installed is no longer available on any of the configured repositories.\nDo you have the -proposed repository enabled ? I believe there were some recent uploads to update-manager there which were rolled back, that would explain it...\nAbout to the main part of the question, Software Center is only able to determine the \"Origin\" of a package if it is still available from an active repository, when the Origin is unknown it's shown on the \"Other\" item.\n\nA: From the terminal run:\napt-cache policy libqt4-dbus\n\nIf the repository from which you got the packages is still enabled you will see it on the list.\n", "Q: How to change Shotwell keyboard shortcuts? I want to edit quickly lots of pictures in Shotwell. It already has some shortcuts, like ] for Rotate. However, I work on a Qwertz keyboard, where ] is typed as AltGr + 9, which means I have to hit two non-home-row buttons with the same hand. It is slow, awkward, and bad for the tendons. \nI would like to map it to some easy key like R. Is there a config file somewhere which I can edit? \n\nA: We've had other complaints about the rotate key shortcuts. They  will be changed back to Ctrl+R and Shift+Ctrl+R in Shotwell 0.8.\n\nA: I do not know how to change shortcuts in Shotwell directly but you can use a Gnome feature to do that : \"Edit Menu Shortcut Key\"\nActivate this feature\n\n\n*\n\n*Run gconf-editor and go to /desktop/gnome/interface/\n\n*Check the 'can_change_accels' option\n\n*no need to restart anything, just close gconf-editor\n\n\nChange menu shortcuts in your apps\n\n\n*\n\n*Start your application : Shotwell here\n\n*Place your mouse on the menu you want to change\n\n*Press the key combination : you'll see your shortcut appear in the menu\n\n\nI don't think you'll be able to set R as a key shortcut directly with this feature but Shift + R (or Control or Alt ...) should work\n\nA: As Bubblegum pointed out, GNOME has a generic feature for changing keyboard shortcuts.  You might think that you could use this technique for editing Shotwell's shortcuts.  Unfortunately, if you try to do this you'll see that the shortcuts you assign are lost as soon as you restart Shotwell.  This is a known bug:\nhttp://trac.yorba.org/ticket/2653\n", "Q: Backup Evolution Mail I would like to backup my email that I have already downloaded and stored in Evolution.  I know there is an option in Evolution to backup your Evolution settings but how can you backup your mail accounts and mail.\nThank you.\n\nA: You can create a backup by clicking File->Backup settings... in Evolution this will save you data and configuration.\nManually you should run evolution –force-shutdown first to make sure evolution is not using the files.\nThen you can Backup:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/.evolution (this saves your data)\n\n*~/.gconf/apps/evolution (and this your configuration)\n\n\nA: The easiest way to backup all of your Evolution is to backup the (hidden) evolution folder in your home directory:\n~/.evolution\n\n\nA: The simpliest way is go to File>Backup data (or something else). That will create an /home/yout_username/evolution-backup.tar.gz. This is the backup file with everything (except passwords).\n\nA: Note that archiving ~/.evolution does not produce the same result as \nFile>Backup \nSo, the two methods mentioned by in answers are not equivalent.\n", "Q: Is it safe to shutdown computer without unmounting NTFS partitions? Sometimes I mount my NTFS drives in Ubuntu but forget to unmount them before shutdown.\nSo does Ubuntu unmount them before shutdown or do I have to unmount them manually before shutdown?\nI am asking this because I have forgot to unmount my NTFS partition many times and when I boot into my Windows, windows starts scanning for my disk sometimes.\nThanks.\n\nA: The Disk scanning is a natural reaction of modern operating systems (Ubuntu would do it if you had a driver for your ext4 partition on windows too) to other systems writing data to their filesystem. The OS just scans the disk to \"fix\" \"errors\" that it might have picked up from the other system's activity. In reality the \"errors\" usually don't exist, but it's just that the $logfile is marked as if the system needs a check, so of course the software does what it \"thinks\" is best.\nAs Karthick pointed out, your system unmounts all drives on shutdown, so no worries.\n\nA: Yeah its safe. Ubuntu unmount the NTFS partition during shutdown.You can also set your NTFS partition to auto mount so that you don want to mount it every time you logon.\nTo auto mount ntfs partitions in ubuntu, you must install ntfs-config\nsudo apt-get install ntfs-config\n\nYou can also edit your fstab file to auto mount your NTFS partition,but it may be little confusing one for a beginner.See the below post to edit your fstab file to auto mount your NTFS partition but be sure what you are doing is right.\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=785263\n", "Q: How to restore Windows XP menu entry in GRUB?

In Windows I used command-line clipboard copy-and-paste utilities...   \n\n\n*\n\n*pclip.exe and gclip.exe\nThese were UnixUtils ports for Windows (but they only handled plain text).

The X Window System also has a secondary selection (which isn't used much), and a clipboard selection. You're probably looking for the clipboard selection, since that's what the desktop environment (e.g. Gnome, KDE, XFCE) uses for its clipboard. To use that with xsel:\nxsel --clipboard < new-clipboard-contents.txt\nxsel --clipboard > current-clipboard-contents.txt\n\n\nA: Parcellite\nI've used parcellite for many years as a clipboard manager.

I'm aware that I need to upgrade to a new LTS version of Ubuntu if I have time.\nBut until I have time for that, are there alternative ways to get some (albeit unofficial) security updates from a secondary source?\n\nA: I don't imagine you will find a repository that continues supplying security updates after a release has reached its \"end of life.\" It's just too much work for something that has no future.\nThat said, even after the official repository has been discontinued, you can still access the old repo for the purpose of installing new programs, ect... Also, this can be important for when you find time to do the upgrade as you should make sure that all of your packages have been correctly updated to the release’s final versions before doing the upgrade. I'm not sure, but the do-release-upgrade script might very well choke if it can not find the repository for the release that you are upgrading from.\nAfter \"end of life,\" the repositories are mirrored at old-releases.ubuntu.com.

I couldn't reproduce your problem, but there is no need for adding a wildcard after firefox in your command.\nInstead of using:\nsudo apt-get purge firefox*\n\nUse:\nsudo apt-get purge firefox\n\nThis command will take care of removing all Firefox packages. If you are still having troubles, then please post the terminal output when you try to remove Firefox, so we can see which packages are being removed.\nBTW, the purge command has the same effect as remove, since Firefox does not store any config files in /etc. If you want to remove personal Firefox settings, you need to manually remove the folder ~/.mozilla/firefox\n\nA: To make Google Chrome your default browser, run Google Chrome, open up Preferences and then under the tab \"Basics\" you'll find \"Make Google Chrome my default browser\". Click that button.\nYou don't need to uninstall Firefox.\n\nA: If uninstalling firefox installs epiphany, then that's because some other package depends on \"a web browser\", which packages do by depending on the virtual package www-browser.  If the google-chrome package doesn't have a Provides: www-browser line, and you have no other browser installed, APT thinks it needs to install a package that does provide a www-browser and then Epiphany is the first choice on a GNOME system.\nI downloaded one of the Google Chrome .deb files and I can confirm that they don't provide www-browser.  If you want to get this fixed you need to file a bug report with Google and tell them to fix their .deb packages.\n\nA: For those who will find this old question:\nIt happens due to installed mozplugger, and it continues to happen nowadays\nin particular, mozplugger depends of one of these:\niceweasel | iceape-browser | firefox | abrowser | galeon | rekonq | konqueror | opera | epiphany | chromium (>> 10.0.64-8.114~r75702-1~) | chromium-browser | xulrunner-1.9 | xulrunner-1.9.1 | xulrunner-1.9.2 | xulrunner-2.0\nThis list did not change for many years.\nSo if one uninstalls the only installed browser from this list, apt-get would try to install another.\n\nA: If you want to remove,do it by:\nsudo apt autoremove firefox\n\n\nA: Full remove, including configurations files:\nsudo apt-get --purge autoremove firefox\n\nA: Full remove = sudo apt-get purge firefox (delete the preferences too)\n", "Q: How do I connect to a wireless network using a TP-Link TL-WN321G USB adapter I'm having troubles connecting to the Internet with my new wireless USB adapter.

And the way I fixed the problem is ridiculous: I plugged the USB adapter into one of the rear USB ports. When plugged into the front side bus the wireless networks were detected but I was unable to connect to any of them as described in my question. Also the adapter doesn't seem to work when plugged in while booting. It has to be plugged into one of the rear USB ports after start up.\nThis is mind boggling.\nAnyway, although it might seem funny: Plugging the TP-Link TL-WN321G USB adapter into one of the rear USB ports instead of the front side bus made the thing connecting to a wireless network.\nIn what way the firmware update has contributed to the solution I can't tell.

I am a Sr. citizen.\nPlease guide and help me in the matter mentioned below. My system is a Pentium III, 804 MHz processor, Asus CUSL-2 Mother board,  512MB RAM SD TWO hard-disks 80 GB & 20 GB. \nI installed Ubuntu 9.04 on a separate HD of 20 GB using CHIP's Live DVD to install.\nIt is JAUNTY JACKLOPE version. It is successfully installed. On starting the system, it also displayes booting options as under:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 9.04 kernel 2.6.28 – 11 genuine\n\n*Ubuntu 9.04 kernel 2.6.28 – 11 genuine (Recovery Mode)\n\n*Ubuntu 9.04 memtest86+\n\n*Other Operating System:\n\n*Microsoft Windows XP Professional\n\n\nIf Win.XP is selected, it starts. But if Ubuntu 9.04 option is given, it starts booting, checks all parameters and gives [OK] to all but stops at \"Checking battery....\" it stops and after 2 to 3 flickers the monitor screen becomes blank/dark... nothing comes on it. I have tried with all the three options as displayed above. The result is the same- i.e. nil.\nPlease help me in the matter and provide guidance in a very simple detailed way and oblige. Thanking you in anticipation.\n\nA: Hey,\nIt sounds like you just installed Ubuntu 9.04 Jaunty. Therefore, this implies that you know how to install Ubuntu the regular way with the graphical desktop CD/DVD installer.\nHowever, you said you used  the \"CHIP\" live DVD.\nI am not sure what CHIP or their live DVD is. Is www.CHIP.de a site for a German computer magazine or something?\nWell regardless, assuming you just installed Ubuntu from this DVD, there is one very big problem. Ubuntu 9.04 Jaunty is no longer supported by Ubuntu. This means it will no longer receive security or bug fix updates/patches. The bottom line of this is that if you use 9.04, your it will be vulnerable to any new malware (viruses) or hacking attempts that have been developed since Ubuntu 9.04's support stopped last month (it was supported for 1.5 years.) The support life-times are explained in the 1st google result for the search term \"ubuntu wiki releases\".\nFortunately, the solution to the lack of support is the same solution that will likely make your laptop work with Ubuntu. The solution is to install a newer version of Ubuntu that is supported for a while. Ubuntu 10.10 maverick is the latest version and will be supported until April 2012, but your system is fairly old so I'd recommend ubuntu 10.04 lucid which is supported until April 2013 (and partially supported until April 2015.) Since Ubuntu 10.04 is a newer version/release it is very likely to include a fix for the bug that prevents 9.04 from starting up.\nTo download Ubuntu 10.04 and then install it, follow this link:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download .\nSelect \"Ubuntu 10.04 - Long Term Support\" and then \"32-bit, recommended\". Then hit download. On this same page you will see instructions for burning the 10.04 CD and installing it. Once it is burnt, it will be the same basic steps that you used to install 9.04 Jaunty. However, you will want to chose to install 10.04 to your entire 20GB hard drive that Ubuntu 9.04 jaunty is on, deleting the old Ubuntu 9.04 install in the process. (Remember, you only want to do this if you do not have any data on the Ubuntu 20GB drive as it will be lost! (Which I presume because I presume you just installed it.) If you do have any data on the Ubuntu drive, copy it over to the windows drive, or a CD, or a usb drive, etc.)\nOf course, I presume you have data on your 80GB windows drive so make sure windows (the NTFS parition) on that drive is not touched.)\nAgain, assuming you just installed 9.04, the steps above to install 10.04 are what I strongly recommend. However we may be able to make your 9.04 install work by installing all bug-fix/security updates for it from the recovery mode. This is assuming you have broadband (fast) internet connection rather than dial-up, which would greatly complicate and slow down things. Here are the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you are connected to the internet (via a router or whatever) over a wired ethernet connection, as opposed to wireless. (Wired ethernet is the usual way for a desktop.) If you are on wireless, tell me and I'll give you a lot more instructions.\n\n*Turn on your computer and at the boot menu, select: Ubuntu 9.04 kernel 2.6.28 – 11 genuine (Recovery Mode)\n\n*Ubuntu should start up into recovery mode, getting past the error you saw before. Once you see a blue menu with several text options, select \"Drop to root shell prompt\" (it may be named something similar.)\n4: At this root shell prompt, (it's a command prompt, like the old days of dos, but way more powerful) enter these commands:\napt-get update\napt-get upgrade\n(You have to enter these commands exactly. You will see a lot of text scroll by for each step, and the 2nd one may take a few hours on your computer. The 2nd one will prompt you to continue, hit Y for yes, then enter.) If you don't run into any errors, that means your system is updated successfully.)\n5: Assuming it worked correctly, you enter the following command to reboot:\nshutdown -r now\n6: When the computer gets back to the boot menu, you should see Ubuntu with a higher kernel number as the default. Select that and see if it starts up successfully without running into the bug you saw before.\nI apologize for this message being so long but it was necessary for the seriousness of the problem and to make things easily understood yet comprehensive. Ask me if you have any questions at all.\n", "Q: Upgraded to 10.10 but desktop shell did not change I upgraded from 10.04 to 10.10 but my desktop shell did not change to Unity.  How can I change it myself to check it out (and change back if I decide to)?\n\nA: Unity is going to be the default in 11.04 (currently unreleased), not 10.10.\nTo install Unity from within the 10.10 Desktop version take a look at this question.\n", "Q: Why does my CPU usage keep spiking? My CPU usage keeps spiking a lot. I can be sitting on my desktop and my CPU usage will go up to around 90%, according to Conky. \nHere is the output of top:\n  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND \n 3183 thomas    25   5  868m  66m  19m S   12  1.7   1:14.99 chromium-browse    \n 1151 root      20   0  149m  45m  19m S   11  1.1   8:07.03 Xorg               \n 5739 thomas    20   0  190m  19m  12m R    6  0.5   0:00.19 nvidia-settings    \n 1891 thomas    20   0  134m  34m 4436 S    4  0.9   1:35.87 beam.smp           \n 4840 thomas    20   0  433m  18m  12m S    3  0.5   0:01.13 gnome-terminal     \n   23 root      20   0     0    0    0 S    1  0.0   0:46.66 kacpid         \n\nAnd right now my CPU usage is around 70%. It's as if there is some malicious process or something hidden away just eating up my CPU usage.\nIf it helps to know, I'm running a Core 2 Duo with the nvidia drivers installed, version 260.19.06.\n\nA: This CPU usage spike usually tends to come from programs that need to run periodically (like gwibber-service) to update something in the background. You should find any applications that are doing this (using system monitor/top it's easy to catch the culprit in action).\nBTW it happens to me as well, and I was able to determine a few culprits: docky, my music player (banshee and rhythmbox are both rather bad behaved at times, but probably because of too many plugins), gwibber, and apt (looking for updates in the background). These may not be the cause of your problems, but you can try seeing if any are responsible.\n\nA: I noticed the same problem after upgrading to 10.10.  I did a release upgrade thru Update Manager.  I noticed my memory was getting used up slowly and the processor cores were taching at around 95% for all cores.  This was strange as nothing was running and processes and memory wasn't being used by anything.

I remembered reading that this could be achieved by changing the user id of the account to something less than 1000 (I think I made it 990). So I did this. That worked fine, but now when I wanted to change it back, the name is not appearing in the list of user accounts in the users and groups menu under administration.\nHow do I modify the phantom account?\n\nA: gdm uses UID_MIN from /etc/login.defs to determine which user IDs are system users and which are regular users. If you adjust it to match your system's user range, gdm will show them at the login screen again.\nFor example, since users on my network have their uid start at 500, I changed /etc/login.defs so they could log in:\n$ grep UID_MIN /etc/login.defs\nUID_MIN          500\n\n\nA: You can change the userid with sudo usermod -u <new id> <username>.\nBtw: to hide users from log in screen: How to hide users from the GDM login screen?\n\nA: If the users/groups are not showing up on the graphical administration there is something wrong with your /etc/passwd, /etc/group files.\nCheck the file contents, also from a terminal run: \nsudo pwck\n\nThis will check for errors.\n\nA: The gdm login  lists ubuntu login user with a UID >=1000\nSo set this UID less than 1000 for the user which you dont want to show in the login screen.\nGoto System -> Administration -> Users and Groups\nClick the user name, go to advanced settings, then change the \"User ID\" to a different number less than 1000.\n", "Q: iptables rule to force all browsers to use proxy I have installed squid as my proxy server in Ubuntu 10.04 standalone system which has a single NIC. Why i have installed Squid in a standalone system is because of my friends who uses my system to browse sites and download files. So I have installed Squid to block porn sites and downloads. But they simply bypass the proxy settings by disabling it in browser..I know there is some way to force all browsers to go through proxy using iptables. But how? I have searched everywhere for the answer but cant get the right one yet. Can somebody help me?\n\nA: First block direct access to port 80 for all except root and squid. (root needs it to get updates for your system). (I'm assuming squid runs as user proxy - edit as appropriate).\niptables -A OUTPUT -m owner --uid-owner root -j ACCEPT\niptables -A OUTPUT -m owner --uid-owner proxy -j ACCEPT\niptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP\n\nThen you can set up firefox to use squid as a proxy as normal. If your friends change the settings then they will be blocked.\nNote that squid can't proxy https traffic, so I haven't put those details in these rules. If you want to do only filtering with no proxying or caching, then you could use DansGuardian. This is a guide to using dansguardian with some users excluded from the filtering. The guide will mean that https (port 443) will be filtered by DansGuardian, as well as http (port 80).\n\nA: alternately you can drop LD_PRELOAD options for proxychains into .profile - if you want to proxy https you can do so with 3proxy\n", "Q: Installing Python 2.4 for development? I have a VM of Ubuntu 10.10 x86, and I need to build a Mercurial installation against Python 2.4. I have to do this because the web host I am working on has Python 2.4 as the latest copy of Python.\nIn Ubuntu 9.10 it was a simple as editing two make files to target the python2.4 executable, and doing a make local against it. However since Ubuntu 10.10 does not have 2.4 I need to install the base, libraries, and dev tools for 2.4.\nHow do I go about doing this?

My wifi connection drops sometimes and, for some reason, Network Manager attempts to connect to my neighbor's network, which requires a password that I don't know. The network in question is not listed in the \"Edit Connections...\" dialog and I can find no reference to it in any configuration file, but still the password dialog pops up every time my main connection drops. Is there a way to blacklist a wireless network so that the Network Manager will never attempt to connect to it? Or, equivalently, how can I remove the configuration data that causes the Network Manager to attempt to connect to this particular network?\n\nA: Hm... not sure why NeworkManager behave this way. This should only happen if you have already added the wireless network in the list and Connect automatically is checked.... maybe is from a connection configured by another users and made available to all users.\nYou can try to manually add the wireless network and the uncheck Connect automatically.\n\nA: The phenomenon you saw might also be due to the wireless roaming that wpa_supplicant (which runs in the background) does at opportune moments, e.g., when your neighbors network has the same name as yours.\nOne way to stay on your own access point is to lock the saved connection to your APs MAC address.

My .bash_env file sets several environment variables, including PATH and EMAIL, but in an Emacs session launched from the Gnome Panel (command: \"/usr/bin/emacs23 %F\") these variables do not have the expected values. I've run into this problem before (see this blog post). I fixed it then by sourcing .bash_env in my .xsession file. Obviously, this is no longer working. \nThe variables are set properly if I manually launch Emacs from a terminal. Oddly, they aren't set if I change the panel launcher to execute Emacs in a terminal (I would think this would start Bash before starting Emacs).\nHow can I make sure the regular Bash environment is set up for the Emacs session?\n\nA: Set the environment variables in ~/.profile (and source ~/.profile from ~/.xsession if you use a .xsession). That way they will be available everywhere, because they'll be set when you log in.\n~/.bash_env is not the right place for environment variables (despite the name) . (Despite its existence (that's $BASH_ENV, right?) I've yet to find a good use for it.)\nWhen you run Emacs in a terminal, it is a subprocess of the terminal emulator. There would be no reason to have a shell in between.\n\nA: /usr/bin/zsh -c emacs worked for me.\n\nA: Just add bash to your launcher command, like bash codecodecode emacs %stuff (aka, just add bash at the beginning of the line) and it should work.\n", "Q: Solving permission problems when using external EXT4 hard disk with multiple linux installs I have an external hard drive and since I only use Ubuntu and Fedora I decide to format my hard drive to ext4 everything is fine.\nThe problem is when I mount the drive I need to change the permission so I can read and write.\nWhat kind of permission should I use? adm my user name?\n\nA: Lame though it may be of me, I'm going to have to answer the question with another question.

I ask corresponding question: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/273144/predefined-group-ids-across-linux-distros/ but after all I made own research.\nI discover that sys group share id 3 on Debian, Ubuntu, RedHat, Fedora, CentOS, Suse, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, MacOSX, Solaris.\nWith such discover in mind one solution may look like:\n$ sudo chgrp -R sys /mnt/data/dir\n$ sudo chgmod -R g+s /mnt/data/dir\n$ sudo fsetacl -R -m g:sys:rwx /mnt/data/dir\n$ sudo fsetacl -R -d -m g:sys:rwx /mnt/data/dir\n\nand flavor of this (whenever you on Linux/FreeBSD/MacOSX/Solaris):\n$ sudo adduser user sys\n\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/126213/external-hard-drive-permissions-ext4/\n\n*How could I mount an ext4 partition and have write permission?\n\n*https://serverfault.com/questions/306344/sharing-an-ext3-ext4-partition-on-external-drive/\n\nA: This is a slight variation of @gavenkoa's approach of using shared groups, and does not involve modification of the mounted drive.\nCheck what group id (GID) is used in the mounted drive.\nsu\ncd /mnt/data/dir  # or wherever it is mounted\nls -l\n\nLet us say you see something similar to the following:\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 12588 12000  4096 30.06.2017 11:22 Documents/\n\nThis means 12000 is the current GID of the data in the drive, and the data can be read, and executed (cannot be written, though) by any other user of the group.

Thanks\n\nA: The simplest solution is to make sure your Ubuntu & Fedora user accounts have the same user id (UID).\nI think Fedora starts user accounts at 500 by default, while Debian & Ubuntu start them at 1000, so it's very likely that in one OS you are user number 500 and in the other you are user number 1000.  The file system uses this UID number to keep track of permissions, so if you make sure they have the same UID, they will be considered the same user, and no permission issues will happen.\nI think the best you can do is make them both UID = 1000, so change the UID in the Fedora system, then make sure all files on the external disk and in the user's $HOME in the Fedora install are owned by UID 1000.  After that you should have no permission problems anymore.\n\nA: Run \"disks\" application installed by default on Linux and then click on the gear and choose \"take ownership\".

For example\napt-get remove --simulate '.*openoffice.*' \n\nworked without a problem, but didn't save me any RAM, either.  So I've looked to the things that are actually running, and as the box doesn't have bluetooth, \napt-get remove --simulate  gnome-bluetooth\n\nseemed reasonable but took package gnome-user-share along with it. But that's okay. However, if I don't want printing capabilities,\napt-get remove --simulate cups\n\nwants to take out ubuntu-desktop which is a metapackage which depends on literally 100 essential sub-systems (e.g. nautilus and gnome-panel among others). Of course, removing cups won't cause the removal of nautilus, but it does seem like it will leave my apt package state confused.\nAm I missing some deep Ubuntu mystique or would removing cups be bad? (I put the --simulate flag in my examples lest someone cut-paste-cry).\n\nA: Removing cups or ubuntu-desktop won't leave your package state confused. Only --force-… can do that.\nubuntu-desktop roughly means “all the basic functionality an Ubuntu user on the desktop should have without having to look for it”. Printing is included in that. If you don't want printing, you're sacrificing functionality. You can still remove ubuntu-desktop, but then it's up to you to make sure you know which of its dependencies you must keep.\nIf you're only limited in RAM and not in disk space, you don't have to remove CUPS, you can just not start it. Under lucid, rename /etc/rc2.d/S50cups to /etc/rc2.d/K50cups, and similarly in rc3.d, rc4.d and rc5.d.\nBut you're not going to gain much by not running CUPS; it would start, and quickly get into the swap and never come back as long as you don't print, and it's less than 2MB anyway. If you're RAM-starved, the best you can do is really to ditch Gnome (I see nautilus at 30MB, gnome-panel at 13MB, nm-applet at 11MB... Some of this is shared, but compared with the Gnome stuff, the system daemons are peanuts.)\n\nA: Since you are not looking after free disk space, but rather free RAM (memory) you can work around by not launching those applications in the first place :). Use gnome-session-properties an un-check any service that is not needed by your session. \nIf for example you will need to print something at a later time, you can start cups only for that session.\n\nA: Removing ubuntu-desktop is not going to break your machine if you are careful enough; I have done so myself when I wanted to use an alternative to a package supplied by ubuntu-desktop by default.  The only thing missing after doing so is the \"warning\" that you are removing something that is part of a default Ubuntu desktop.\nBut if your main issue is RAM and not disk space, it's also possible to make sure the programs you don't need just don't run.\n\nThe following works for Maverick (10.10) but not for Lucid.  See Gilles' answer for Lucid (and older Ubuntu versions).\nIn case of cups you can edit /etc/init/cups.conf and comment out the start on ... line like this:\n#start on (filesystem\n#          and (started dbus or runlevel [2345])\n#          and stopped udevtrigger)\n\nThat will prevent CUPS from starting automatically (but you can still start it manually with sudo start cups).\n\nFor applications that run inside a user session, those can be disabled in System --> Preferences --> Startup Applications.\n", "Q: dark video with Skype When I use skype the video looks really dark (both to me and the other person).

Good luck getting it to work.\n\nYou can mount your Gmail filesystem\n  either via fstab or on the command\n  line using mount.\nTo use fstab, create an entry\n  /etc/fstab that looks something like:\n  /usr/local/bin/gmailfs.py\n  /path/of/mount/point gmailfs\n  noauto,username=gmailuser,\n  password=gmailpass, fsname=zOlRRa \n  Note: If you cut and paste this entry\n  remember to remove the spaces after\n  the commas\nThe username and password fields speak\n  for themselves. The fsname is the name\n  of this Gmail filesystem. It is\n  important to choose a hard-to-guess\n  name here - because if others can\n  guess the fsname, they can corrupt\n  your Gmail filesystem by injecting\n  spurious messages into your Inbox.\nTo mount from the command line, do:\nmount -t gmailfs\n  /usr/local/bin/gmailfs.py\n  /path/of/mount/point -o\n  username=gmailuser,\n  password=gmailpass, fsname=zOlRRapassword=gmailpass, fsname=zOlRRa\n\n\nA: You could use something like dropbox, but as far as i know there is no gdrive in ubuntu.\n\nA: You can use gspace Firefox add-on to use gmail as a online storage place.\nYou can use 'Google Doc Mount' to mount google-docs as an external drive in nautilus. There is a nice article at omgubuntu about Google Doc Mount.\n\nA: Since no one really answered your question, here it goes: it's in the works.\nGoogle has reportedly said to Linux users to hang tight, altough this was like a month ago.\nYou can still use Gdrive from the browser, but the syncing app to install in Ubuntu hasn't been released yet.\n\nA: Not exactly what you are looking for but, it creates a drive on your system which stores and syncs your google docs with you system. Putting other files in it might also work.\nBut if you only want to sync your documents then its a great application cause it would create a drive of google docs and you can put your files into it and they will be instantly synced with google docs. Its two way sync\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:doctormo/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gdocs-mount-gtk\n\nHere is the complete How-To\nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/08/edit-work-on-save-your-google-docs-via-nautilus-no-browser-needed/\n\nA: Yes there is.\nSee the Grive tools, with detailed installation instructions:\nhttp://www.thefanclub.co.za/how-to/ubuntu-google-drive-client-grive-and-grive-tools\n\nA: There is also the google-docs-fs package, which I've been using, but there are some limitations until the official Linux version is released. (See tutorial.) Like Gaba said, Google hasn't said anything about the Linux version yet, sadly. Also google-docs-fs is no longer being maintained. \n\nA: If \n\n\n*\n\n*we are looking for a freeware application (if not, there is Insync) \n\n*non-googledrive solutions are to be accepted as an alternative\n\n*the idea is to have at least as much free space as google drive provides,\n\n\nthere is already Megasync client for Linux. \n50 GB for a free account and a sync app that, just like Dropbox and GoogleDrive for Windows (and unlike all google drive applications for Linux that I tried, except Insync) is able to make selective synchronization. \n(That is why I cannot use free google drive apps as alternative. I have stored a lot of files on the online google drive but I do not need all of that on each device.)\nFor the fanatics of monochrome layouts, there is the downside of a red tray icon.\n", "Q: Where can I find the downloaded videos on my hardisk after I've watched it in a web browser? Where can I find the downloaded videos on my hardisk after I've watched it in a web browser?\n\nA: Yes the videos you watch on youtube will be placed in /tmp folder..The name of the video will be in the form of alphanumeric you have to rename it to .flv For example if the file name is fff2356xg you have to rename this into fff2356xg.flv \nNote:\nNot all videos you watch will be stored in /tmp folder..As far as i know youtube will work\nYou can also save your youtube videos by adding save infront of the URL,For example if the youtube video is http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0USn7eufXps you want to add save infront of the URL http://www.saveyoutube.com/watch?v=0USn7eufXps so that you dont want to watch the whole video,you can simply download it.\nYou can also install youtube-dl to download youtube videos,it is a simple command line utility to download youtube videos.\nTo install youtube-dl:\nsudo apt-get install youtube-dl\nExample:\nType youtube-dl http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0USn7eufXps in terminal to download the video\n\nA: on maverick it drops in /tmp for flash video and gstreamer plugins\n\nA: Although the /temp folder is the most common place, keep in mind depending on the web site player and flash version, videos can be stored in the browser cache folder. If you are using Firefox, the cache folder is under ~/.mozilla/firefox/yourprofile/Cache. If you are using Opera, the cache folder is under ~/.opera/cache. If you are using Chrome, then the cache is under ~/.cache/google-chrome.\nSometimes locating these files in the cache is not so simple, because they might be stored under a folder inside the cache. What I do is filter the folders by date it has been modified.\nKeep in mind some sites use rtmp protocol to prevent their video streams from being downloaded. In this case, you won't find any video files in the tmp or cache folder.\n", "Q: Add an audio file to and mkv video I'm quite new to multimedia things, I'm trying to find a way to make nice screencasts, I've already been able to capture my desktop with ffmpeg:\n$ ffmpeg -f alsa -ac 2 -i hw:0,0 -f x11grab -r 30 -s $(xwininfo -root | grep 'geometry' | awk '{print $2;}') -i :0.0 -acodec pcm_s16le -vcodec libx264 -vpre lossless_ultrafast -threads 0 -y out.mkv\n\nIt works pretty nice, but I'd like to add music in the background, if I add it with mencoder:\nmencoder  -ovc copy -oac mix -audiofile track.mp3 out.mkv -o out.mp4\n\nIt delete the video sound, I don't want to replace it, I want to add music to my explanation, any ideas?\n\nA: kdenlive and add a second audio track, then remux\n\nA: I'm not sure why mencoder didn't work for you, but you can also do the same thing with ffmpeg.  You just need to use two inputs to ffmpeg.\n ffmpeg -i track.mp3 -i out.mkv -vcodec copy -acodec libfaac -ab 192k final.mkv\n\nI didn't try it, but I don't think you can do -acodec copy, especially since you're using two different codecs.  Just pick whatever you want in the output and add that in, its really fast compared to the video.\n\nA: You can install  mkvtoolnix; \nsudo apt-get install mkvtoolnix\n\nThen use mkvmerge from the installation to mux audio and video into the mkv container from the command line. \nThere is also a Gui tool, mkvtoolnix-gui that is a front end to mkvtoolnix.\nsudo apt-get install mkvtoolnix-gui\n\nExample to mux video file called, input-video.mkv with a sound file called soundfile.mp3, creating a new muxed mkv file called output-with-sound.mkv, do the following in the directory where you have the video without audio and the audio file:\nmkvmerge -o output-with-sound.mkv -A input-video.mkv soundfile.mp3\n\nMore examples including synchronization  here: http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/doc/mkvmerge.html\n", "Q: How can I navigate to /tmp? I want to find the downloaded videos on my hardisk.\n\nA: /tmp is located under the root file system (/). If you want to access it using Nautilus windoe manager (GUI) use the above suggestion. if you want to access it via Command Line Interface (CLI), just open a terminal (depending to your user interface: GNOME or KDE) and type cd /tmp. You should be there in a jiffy :)\n\nA: If you are trying to access the files downloaded by flash, they have been moved to the browser cache instead of the /tmp folder.\nFor Chromium this means:\n~/.cache/chromium/Cache/\n\nFor Chrome:\n~/.cache/google-chrome/Cache/\n\nFor Firefox:\n~/.mozilla/firefox/<some-random-string>.default/Cache/\n\n\nA: First launch the file manager by clicking on \"Places\" in the top menu and selecting \"Home Folder\". From there click on \"File System\" on the left part and that will take you to the / directory, from there you'll see /tmp, which you can then browse to.\n\n\nA: Type nautilus /tmp in terminal it will open /tmp \nOr Goto My Computer--->File System\nAll the system files and folders including tmp will be located there.\n", "Q: HD6870 segmentation fault with fglrx Installing a new system.\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel Core i7 870 Socket 1156 2.93Ghz Tray\n\n*Gigabyte GA-P55A-UD3 P55 CHIPSET\n\n*8GB Transcend DDR3 1333Mhz (4 x 2GB)\n\n*Sapphire ATI Radeon 6870 1GB GDDR5\n\n*Ubuntu 10.10 64bit\n\n\nAfter installing the proprietary fglrx display adapter driver using the \"Additional Drivers\" wizard and rebooting the system I'm getting the following segmentation fault in Xorg log.

But in its own way, it actually is \"predictable\"\", as it is not an X bug, as such.\nIt largely results from different X applications using different X features in different ways...   \nBut it doesn't really help to know that it isn't \"actually\" a bug. because it feels like a bug!  \nThere is a list (below) of what I've found / tested.  \nIs there some way (a daemon?), which irons out all these wrinkles? I'd prefer something that doesn't sit in the panel.\nThe X / Ubuntu clipboard is potentially awesome, because of its 2/3 levels ability, but is a bit annoying because of the inconsistent implementations...   \nI've been trying to understand why the copy/paste thing didn't always do what I expected... It's amazing what you can learn when you read the info docs :) ... But a question can hit the target faster.  \nThe main issue seems to come about when the source application is shut down, and you try to access \"clipboard\" data which came from that application.\nX GUI applications have two major copy/paste methods (modes).    \nMode NAME    Text Copy method         Text Paste  method\n----------   ---------------------    -------------------\nPRIMARY      currently selected       mouse middle-click\nCLIPBOARD    Control+C selection      Control+V\n\nI've tested the behaviour of the selection modes for a few different X applications: gvim, gedit, firefox, and gnome-terminal.\nNB: \n * All pasting was done into gedit\n * The gedit source was from another (root) instance)\n * I've tried a couple of \"managers\", parcelite and pastie, but I can't see any point in comparing them, because neither address the problem.

You have to add it to .bashrc or startup aps, or just start it manually (it is command line, not gui) but it has always worked well for me. You do have to remember to switch the focus to the field (if browser, for example) or document (gedit, kate, gvim...) before pasting or it will appear to not work.\n\nA: I was just looking at GPaste which is what I use. It seems to handle copy and paste actions even if you have closed the application you copied from! \nThere is even a nice extension for Gnome-shell :-)\n", "Q: Removing blue link borders around pictures in HTML emails in Evolution Sorry for the long title.\nSo I have created an HTML signature file that I want to use in Evolution.

When I load the file as my signature file in Evolution it also does not show any link borders, actually it doesn't show the pictures at all, but when I send an email with the signature, the person who gets the email always gets those ugly blue link borders around the graphics.  I have sent test email s to Gmail and Yahoo! Mail accounts and I see it in both of them.  Does anyone know a way I can prevent Evolution from doing this.\nAny advice gladly welcome\n\nA: You could try to add the border=\"0\" attribute to the img tags. I see that you set the borders to 0px, solid in your style attributes, but perhaps not all html renderers can interpret this (more advanced) css.\n<img src=\"/foo/image.png\" border=\"0\" /> accomplishes the same css magic, but only using html which should be more \"backward compatible\"\n", "Q: Docky make the icon jump when it needs attention I wonder if there's any possibility to make icons in Docky jump when in need of attention.\n\nA: I thought they already jumped.

Archlinux with its bootloader, Grub1, on sda3. Ubuntu's bootloader grub2 in on sda. How can I create an entry for sda3 Grub1 in ubuntu's sda Grub2. Simply put, On bootup I should see Grub2 first and it should have an entry for Grub1. \n\nA: GRUB2 supports the chainloader command ( that instead of booting directly a kernel, simply 'pass the stick' to the next boot loader ).\nSo in your /boot/grub.cfg file you should add something that resemble this:\n# (1) Arch Linux\n menuentry \"Arch Linux\" {\n set root=(hd0,2)\n chainloader +1\n}\n\nBe aware that if you update your grub2 configuration by its tool ( update-grub ) you will need to apply this setting again.\n\nA: You can just put\n# (1) Arch Linux\n echo \"Adding Arch Linux\" >&2\n cat << EOF\n menuentry \"Arch Linux\" {\n set root=(hd0,2)\n chainloader +1\n}\n\nin /etc/grub.d/40_custom and then run \nsudo update-grub\n\nReference: http://members.iinet.net/~herman546/p20/GRUB2%20Configuration%20File%20Commands.html#chainloader_boot_entry\n", "Q: USB mouse late to load I was using 10.04 going into this weekend and, after a kernel update, I began to observe some unreliable USB behaviour: namely, my USB mouse is extremely late to the party (usually turns on several seconds after login) and my USB card reader pretty much isn't working at all.\nIn the hopes of the latest and greatest taking care of it, and being in need of the switch to x64, I upgraded to 10.10 and was disappointed to find that the problems are still here.\nI'm not terribly familiar with Ubuntu's USB systems these days so I'm asking the question: how do I begin to diagnose this issue?\nUpdate 1:\nI've added noapictimer and irqpoll to my kernel command.

This morning Ubuntu gave me an option to install drivers for Wireless Card and Nvidia drivers for display. There were two options for wireless driver and two options for NVidia display.. For NVidia driver one option was marked as Recommended (I remember installing this when I installled Ubuntu), so today along with two Wireless Drivers (Broadcom) drivers, I installed the other NVidia driver as well. After restarting I am seeing this lag which is quite irritating. \nIs there anyway to rollback to previous configuration like windows?\n\nA: Sounds like you installed another driver for your graphics card without reason, and possibly an old version, like the nv driver.\nOpen jockey (system>administration>additional drivers), and disable the extra nvidia driver (ensure you have the recommended one enabled still). You only need 1 driver.\n\nA: I don't know if this will be any help, and I'm far from an Ubuntu expert, but I was having a similar problem myself. After installing the recommended \"Additional Driver\" for the Nvidia card on my Pavilion TX2000, I experienced terrible lag or choppiness when scrolling in a browser,switching desktops, and basically anything that used the window manager. I tried using the install provided by NVidia, but Gnome wouldn't even load after I did that, so I went back to the recommended driver. The attempted NVidia install added a \"NVidia X Server Settings\" option to the System->Administration menu. I loaded this, and noted that, in the \"X Server Display Configuration\" section, \"Resolution\" was set to \"Auto.\" I changed this to 1280x800 (the same value chosen by the \"Auto\" setting, by the way,) and then set the refresh rate from \"Auto\" to \"60 Hz.\" After applying that setting, the issue seems to be resolved. I don't know if this will be applicable to anyone else's system, but I thought it was worth putting out there.\n", "Q: Windows FTP script download from Ubuntu I'm using following FTP script on windows xp to download zip files from Ubuntu cloud servers.

Oftentimes I run into small bash scripts that use this sort of syntax in if statements:\nsome command > /dev/null 2>&1\nWhat is the purpose of outputting to /dev/null like that, and what does the 2>&1 mean?\nIt always seems to work but I'd like to know what it's doing.\n\nA: STDIN is represented by 0, STDOUT by 1, and STDERR by 2.\n/dev/null is the bit-bucket: the place where you dump anything you don't need.\n\nSo, the STDOUT is redirected to the bit-bucket(trash) and the STDERR is redirected to where the STDOUT is located: the bit-bucket.\n\nYou can also do this:\n>/dev/null 2>/dev/null\n\n\nA: >/dev/null redirects the command standard output to the null device, which is a special device which discards the information written to it\n2>&1 redirects the standard error stream to the standard output stream (stderr = 2, stdout = 1). Note that this takes the standard error stream and points it to same location as standard output at that moment. This is the reason for the order >/some/where 2>&1 because one needs to first point stdout to somewhere and then point stderr to the same location if one wants to combine both streams in the end.\nIn practice it prevents any output from the command (both stdout and stderr) from being displayed. It's used when you don't care about the command output.\n", "Q: Command to mute and unmute a microphone During voice / video conversations I would like to mute/unmute the microphone without having to go through all these steps each time:\n\n*\n\n*Sound indicator, Sound preferences, Select Input, Mute or unmute the microphone.\n\nI'm looking for either:\n\n*\n\n*an application that can do this from the command line,\n\n*a way I can assign a keyboard shortcut that can mute/unmute the microphone\n\n\nA: Simply mute/unmute with this command:\namixer -D pulse sset Capture toggle\n\nYou can also add notification to make sure it's on or off, as per vladimirich answer to the same question\namixer -D pulse sset Capture toggle && amixer get Capture | grep '\\[off\\]' && notify-send \"MIC switched OFF\" || notify-send \"MIC switched ON\"\n\nInspired by Mark Rooney's answer on muting/unmuting sound.\n\nA: pacmd is the command line interface to PulseAudio (the sound subsystem used in recent releases).

Let's say you want to control the LifeCam HD-5000 only. Then you could do it like this:\npacmd list-sources | grep -P \"card: \\d+ <[^>]*LifeCam_HD-5000[^>]*>\" | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -rn1 -I_ pactl set-source-mute _ toggle\nThis queries all audio sources from PulseAudio, extracts card rows that have LifeCam_HD-5000 as part of their name, uses awk to extract the second part of the row to get the card number and passes it to pactl to toggle correct source muting using xargs to put the number in correct position in the command. The -rn1 flag tells xargs to do nothing if the card number couldn't be found.\nIf you need to know the mute status for some scripting, you can do\npacmd dump | grep -P 'set-source-mute [^ ]*LifeCam_HD-5000' | awk '{print $3}'\nwhich will emit yes (muted) or no (not muted).\n", "Q: What is the name of the package that allows you to connect to a windows machine over RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) I have Ubuntu Netbook with Unity installed, and I do not see the program that allows you to connect to Windows Via RDP, I would like to be able to install this functionality, anyone know what the name of the package is?\nThanks\n\nA: The package is rdesktop, you need to run it from the terminal \"rdesktop remote_hostname\".

I have a slipstreamed ISO for XP and only a USB to boot from. I do not have access to another Windows machine, and my Windows virtual machine does not recognise my USB drive. The solution needs to be purely linux-based.\n\nA: Unless you have a modified SETUPLDR.BIN, it won't work from USB directly.\nNeeded:\n\n    Modified SETUPLDR.BIN\n\n    special stuff in the bootsector of the partition (use ms-sys).\n\n    Modified copy of txtsetup.sif copied to the root level\n\n    NTDETECT.COM copied to root level\n\nWinUSB does not do this, UNetBootin does not do this, the diskpart tutorial does not do this, WinToFlash does not do this, and bit-banging the iso onto the device with dd does not do this.\nRufus does this. However, it is a Windows-only utility (that is unsupported by Wine), so follow the tutorial here (the big post):\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/99478/make-a-bootable-usb-to-install-windows-xp-from-linux\nYou could also try to use QEMU or VirtualBox where you actually make one of the VM's hard drives be your real target hard dirve, and simply have the hypervisor boot the iso like a CD (actual hardware emulation, not BIOS disk emulation that Grub4DOS does. Yes, a \"real fake\" as opposed to a \"fake fake\".).\nJust note that you will need to make a second hardware profile, because Windows configures itself to a specific hardware configuration during the first part of the installation, and the hardware platform conjured by the hypervisor is not the same as your real hardware platform.\nNot sure if this would work. I recommend imitating Rufus. \nThe method of loading the whole iso into memory and booting it usually results in a blue screen at some point. Firadisk stops that blue screen. If you really want to do that method, see this: http://diddy.boot-land.net/firadisk/files/win_iso_install.htm\nEdit: Just tried Multisystem (a Linux app) for making a USB drive bootable into the XP installer. It does work, however, it uses the method of loading the whole iso into memory in conjunction with Firadisk, as the above link discusses.\nPersonally, I find Multisystem's specific solution to creating a USB XP installer undesirable. I had to install xterm and run an installation script that downloaded a bunch of stuff. The resultant USB drive of me only telling Multisystem to make it bootable from an XP installation iso included Grub2, Syslinux, Grub4DOS, a bootable Grub2 iso, Plop stuff, and a bunch of menu entries. You have to know to hit \"Grub4DOS\" under the first menu, the Grub2 menu, to get to the option to install XP. You'd think that if that's the only thing I want it bootable into, XP installation would be in the first menu (yes, I know, it's not possible with the Grub4DOS method, but how about a note in the menu?). Plus it has to load the whole iso into memory which takes both RAM and time. (What if system doesn't have enough RAM?)\nAnd Multisystem insists on installing Grub2 every time you use it with a thumb drive (even if it's already installed) and even wanted to resize my thumb drive's partition. And puts a bunch of extra on there.\nNote:  must install Firadisk from the non-free tab for it to be able to make a USB XP installer. A howto I read said to also install Plop for creating a USB XP installer, but I don't see how this is needed.\nAnother Note:  you must boot into the second phase of the XP installer with the Grub4DOS menu option to again load the iso into memory, which is still needed in the second phase. (As opposed to just booting into the target hard drive) That is, if you go for the RAM'ed iso + Firadisk method.\nI recommend imitating what Rufus does. Just copy the files on and make a few tweaks.\nJake\n\nA: You can sure use UNetbootin. Although there are a few important things to be aware of, or else it won't work:\nFirst, be sure to format you usb key to NTFS and flag it as bootable -- you can use gparted to do that (sudo apt-get install gparted).\nThen run UNetbootin with your usb key already mounted. On its interface, select \"Diskimage\" and then browse for your .ISO file.\nCheck the \"Show all drives\" box (so it can find your NTFS formatted usb key) and select the right drive (be careful!) -- on my case, it was \"/dev/sdd1\".\nClick \"Ok\" and wait. It takes a long time to finish copying all the files. So wait.\n\nA: This utility will run in Linux (presumably it works with Ubuntu):\nhttp://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/\nIt says you can just give it an ISO file and it will make the USB stick a bootable copy of that ISO. Then boot off the USB device from the BIOS.\n\nA: You can use UNetBootin, i think, but you need unetbootin-494 for it to work, because a newer version than that won't find drives formatted to NTFS. I installed my Windows 7 on that way and now I'm trying it with Windows XP.\n\nA: This might work for bare metal> http://ansi.interblc.com/2010/02/06/howto-boot-iso-images-via-grub2-with-ubuntu/. of course it could also just make the installer puke...haven't tried it.\nAnother option might be booting bartpe from usb and staging the installation files in an i386 folder like you were doing an oem install and copying the boot sector from the iso to the HD. this can get really hairy, but I got it to work once.\n", "Q: Will Canonical be dumping a standard file manager for non-root users in coming releases?

Or add an inhibitor applet to your panel. when you click on it, the screen will not turn off! =) \n\nA: This guide is half of your solution:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=3550\nBasically it has you add an option to your GRUB menu that starts the system at a different runlevel. Then you can modify the scripts for that runlevel which will configure the system however you want. However, the second half of the guide only covers modifying xsetup and your network interfaces.\nThe setting you're looking for is in Power Management. We can use gconf-editor to find the name of the setting, in this case /apps/gnome-power-manager/timeout/sleep_display_battery. A setting of 0 will disable the screen shut-off, otherwise it is the number of seconds until shut-off. To change this setting using a runlevel script or the command-line, you can run:\n$ gconftool-2 --set \"/apps/gnome-power-manager/timeout/sleep_display_battery\" --type integer 0\n\nIf you're having trouble putting that command and the runlevel guide together, please comment on this and I will try and assist further.\n", "Q: I failed to safely eject my USB drive and lost data...how do I get it back? I have to admit I didn't \"Safetly Eject\", but I have done this a million times... what gives, and how do I get my data back??\n\nA: Ubuntu doesn't \"randomly format\" drives, so you could make your question a bit less dramatic...\nUnplugging a device with a file system on it without unmounting it is guaranteed to cause problems sooner or later, and if you are using a FAT filesystem on it, it won't easily \"repair\" itself like ext4 or NTFS would.  But we don't know what the exact cause of your problem is in this case.\nIt might be useful to look in your log files (dmesg, syslog, etc.) to see if there are any error messages when you plug in the USB memory stick.\nIf you see read errors, then probably something is wrong with the hardware, and you want to use something like ddrescue or gddrescue to make an as-good-as-possible image of the flash drive.\nIf there are no read errors, it's probably \"only\" the filesystem that got corrupted.  You can use a simple dd to make an image then.  After making a backup image, you can try to fix the filesystem with fsck and see if that brings back all the files you need.\nIn case there are hardware problems, or a simple fsck doesn't solve the problem, you can try using tools like photorec on a disk image (which can recover not only graphics files but also a lot of other document formats).\n\nA: Building on what aking said:\nFirst things first, get a bit-for-bit copy of your USB key that you can work on. Working on the USB key directly will likely make things worse.\nTo make the copy insert the key and note what device it appears as in dmesg (it will be something like /dev/sd[bcdefg...]). You can then copy the whole image using dd:\ndd if=/dev/sdX of=mybrokenusbkey.img\n\nYou can then poke the image file with various recovery tools to see if you can get the data off. I would install \"testdisk\" and use that to see if the data is recoverable.\ntestdisk mybrokenusbkey.img\n\nThe testdisk package comes with a specialised tool called photorec which is geared towards finding pictures. It has a fairly good success rate even if the filesystem structure is pretty hosed. It relies on the fact that most lightly used memory devices store file in sequential blocks. \nHowever whatever you do don't try playing directly with the USB save for making the first copy of the data.\n\nA: Some good resources on recovering data:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery\n\n*http://www.ehow.com/how_6093669_use-tools-rescue-hard-drive.html\n\n*http://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/manual/ddrescue_manual.html\nThere are also several live distributions that specialise in forensics and data recovery. SystemRescueCD is but one. In your case, you probably won't need it since it is just a usb key, but if it was a hard drive then you might want to keep a copy handy.\nBest of luck!\n", "Q: What calls PostgreSQL's initdb on package installation? I'm trying to a build a custom package of PostgreSQL with some configuration tweaks suitable for our application. Part of that configuration involves a pg_hba.conf using \"trust\" instead of the defaults.\nI can see when I install a setup script is triggered and the PostgreSQL 'initdb' command is run. This copies the sample config files and applies some transformations to it (keyword replacement) and copies into /etc. However even if I remove the keywords from the pg_hba.conf.sample file and hard code the values I want they automagically get reverted to the defaults.\nI've tried to follow the post install scripts but all I can see is a call to configure_version which isn't anywhere in the PostgreSQL source code.\nSo what is the call-chain from post installation scripts to the initdb program being called?

I have a Western Digital My Book 3.0 - 1 TB USB 3.0 Desktop External Hard Drive, and I wanted to know if it would work on Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat.\n\nA: Yes, Ubuntu supports USB 3.0.\nLinux started supporting USB 3.0 in the September 2009 release of the 2.6.31 kernel, and Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala was the first version of Ubuntu to support USB 3.0.\nIn Ubuntu releases older than Ubuntu 11.04 Natty Narwhal, there is a bug in the XHCI (USB 3.0) kernel module that prevents suspend: Bug #522998.\n\nA: Yes, it will. Current kernel does support usb 3.0, so you should have no problems using your drive.\nBy the way, linux was the first os to have usb 3.0 support: http://www.neowin.net/news/main/09/06/11/linux-is-first-os-to-support-usb-30\n\nA: It may be worthwhile to note that USB 3.0 boot is not supported yet.\nRefer bug 565047.\n\nA: apparently there is an issue : (522998) \nWhen the XHCI module is loaded for USB 3.0 operation the system cannot suspend. Manually unloading XHCI will allow suspend to complete normally. \nTo avoid future suspend problems, the workaround is to add SUSPEND_MODULES=\"xhci-hcd\" \nto /etc/pm/config.d/unload_module then the system can suspend normally. \n\nA: Yes it supports usb 3.0 see the link below,I have connected two via usb 2.0 it works perfectly.USB 3.0 is down complaint with 2.0.My USB ports are 2.0 but the HDD is 3.0 capable.\nhttp://www.neowin.net/news/main/09/06/11/linux-is-first-os-to-support-usb-30\n\nA: I have Ubuntu 11.10 running in VMware Player 4.0, and after much searching, I found the following in the VMware release notes:\n\nUSB 3.0 support is available for Linux guests running kernel version 2.6.35 or later (Ubuntu 10.10) through a new virtual xHCI USB controller. To enable this feature, add the following line to the .vmx file: usb_xhci.present = “true”. Do not enable this feature for Windows guests. Because Windows does not currently have a generic xHCI driver, this feature will not work in Windows.\n\nAfter adding this line to my .vmx file, the system now detects the USB 3.0 HDD I have plugged in.\n\nA: I believe the problem is hardware related and nothing to do with (k)ubuntu. I have a new PC with 2 USB3 ports setup to dual boot between Windoze 7 and Kubuntu 13.10. The ports worked fine under Windoze but not at all under Kubuntu.\nBrowsing the forums for a solution I came across the answer in a Linux Mint (Ubuntu derivative) forum. Apparently internal USB3 ports plugged into the motherboard 20 pin header will not be recognised by Linux.\nThe answer is to buy a PCI-E to USB 3 expansion card. I bought the Inateck Superspeed card from Amazon, plugged it into my motherboard's PCI-E expansion slot (MUST be a PCI-E slot, will not work with standard PCI) and on booting my PC Kubuntu recognised the ports and connected drives instantly. (Windoze had to wait until I installed the supplied driver).\n\nA: Apart from the posts above i need to also add that Linux is the first operating system to support USB 3.0 thanks to Intel's hacker Sarah Sharp. Which makes it one of the first steps that makes a small suggestion into how linux will be in the near future in comparison to other ..... \"systems\"\n\nA: It seems as though system looks for a USB 2.0 drive somewhere during the boot sequence, even if it started off form a USB 3.0 drive.\nThis is what I did:\nI have a Western Digital MyPassport (USB 3.0) drive and a HP Elitebook 8540W PC with 2 USB 3.0 ports and with 2 USB 2.0 ports. \nWhen I boot from a USB 2.0 port, everything is fine.\nWHen I boot from a USB 3.0 port, booting starts, but stops somewhere in the middle reporting an error (no live system found or something - I can send the specific code if desired)\nSo I created another bootable HD : Lacie 300GB (USB 2.0 and installed the same ubuntu version on it:Ubuntu 10.10 i386 (My PC is a 64 bit processor, but I use the bootable USB disks on other PC's as well)\nStrange:\nWhen I connect BOTH the Lacie to a USB 2.0 port AND the Western Digital to a USB 3.0 port AT THE SAME TIME and I boot the PC, I manage to start booting from USB 3.0 (via the Bios boot sequence of my PC) but I obtain the desktop of the system which is on the Lacie USB 2.0 drive. \nI used a different desktop background to be 100% sure for distinguishing both systems. Apart from the desktop, they are identical.\nSo I think somewhere during the boot sequence, the system looks for a drive that is connected to the USB 2.0 port and not the one that is connected to the USB 3.0 port even if it started booting from USB 3.0\n\nA: Had the same problem.  This was an expantion card.  After an hour of messing around I thought to look at the card inside again. and of course I forgot to plug the power cable to the card.  Simple fix.\n", "Q: Getting the word count of a pdf document in Evince Is there any way I can get the word count of a PDF document that I'm viewing in Evince, Ubuntu's default pdf viewer? I'm able to convert the documents to text files and get the word count from the terminal, but I'd quite like to be able to quickly get at them without having to use the terminal. Is there any plugin that can do this, or is it already built in and I'm just missing it?\nP.S. I'd prefer not to change my viewer as Evince is the default PDF viewer in Ubuntu, and I'd quite like to do as much as possible using the default applications since a lot of them, Evince included, are really nice.\n\nA: You can do this via command line:\npdftotext filename.pdf - | tr -d '.' | wc -w\n\n\nA: I don't believe that is possible (well it's technically possible but hasn't been implemented).\nYou have to remember Evince is a document viewer and a word count is a feature more usually required in an editor (yes I know this isn't always the case).\nYou might like to contact the Evince developers and ask if they would have any interest in implementing this feature.\n\nA: How about a quick bash script requiring zenity and evince. When called without an argument, it'll give you a dialogue box so you can choose a file. When called with an argument (or after said dialogue box), it'll both open the file in evince and give you a dialogue box with a word count.\nIn other words, copy the following into a text file, called evince-word-count.sh or something, save it somewhere in your path (e.g., ~/bin/), make it executable (either through Nautilus's right click and properties or with chmod +x ~/bin/evince-word-count.sh), \n#!/bin/bash\nif [ \"$#\" -gt \"0\" ] ; then\n    filename=\"$1\"\nelse\n    filename=\"$(zenity --file-selection)\"\nfi\nevince \"$filename\" &\nzenity --info --text \"This PDF has $(pdftotext \"$filename\" - | tr -d '.' | wc -w) words\"\nexit 0\n\nNow, right click on some on some PDF in nautilus, choose \"Open with...\" and then have it open with evince-word-count.sh. Now, when you open a PDF, it'll both open in evince, and give you a word count.\n\n\nA: A response from Olaf Leidinger on the Evince mailing list:\nI think such a feature is better suited for document editors, as they have\nmore information on the document as a plain viewer and counting words is\ntrivial.\n\nTake a PDF file as an example. What you see as text might actually be some kind\nof vector graphic shape. Even if the text is contained as such in the PDF file,\nthose words you see might be composed of multiple \"draw text at position\n(y,x)\"-commands -- e.g. in case of umlauts or end of line. So a single word\nmight count as multiple words. Therefore I think it might be hard to implement\nsuch a feature reliably. Have a look at pdftotext to see what I mean.\n", "Q: How can I relabel my flash drive?

Ubuntu (10.10) offers emacs21,22,23 and emacs-snapshot. What are the differences between them and which one does the emacs package install by default? Also, I presume emacs-snapshot-gtk is the most up to date one. I would like to use this because it seems to pay attention to my .Xdefaults settings, which emacs doesn't. What disadvantages might this cause?\nI use emacs for LaTeX, ORGmode and ESS/R programming.\n\nA: emacs-snapshot is a development version of Emacs. It has more goodies but likely also more bugs, so use it at your own risk. The others are released versions; the only reason I can think not to install the latest one is if you're very short on disk space.\nThe emacs package depends on emacs23 (you can see the dependencies in any package administration tool).\nGtk programs don't use X resources (.Xdefaults).

There's an ethernet cable plugged in by the network manager can no longer find it. I have no choice but to reboot.\nAny suggestions?\nThanks.\n\nA: It looks like your ethernet driver does not work after suspending your machine. You can tell Ubuntu to unload it before suspend and load it again after resuming your computer. To do so, you must create a file /etc/pm/config.d/unload_modules and put in it the next entry:\nSUSPEND_MODULES=\"your_module_name_here\"\nwhere your_module_name_here must be the name of the driver. You can find it using network manager.\nHope it helps\nIgnacio\n\nA: Can't help you with the cause, but a possible solution is manually forcing it.\nsudo ifconfig eth0 up\nsudo dhclient eth0\n\nThis COULD work, but it's obviously just a stop gap for figuring out the real problem.\n\nA: This sounds like an ACPI issue.  On my own laptop a simple case of unplugging and replugging the network cable solves the issue.\nAre you using Linux drivers or Windows drivers through NDISWrapper?\n\nA: I created the /etc/pm/config.d/unload_modules file and entered the line:\nSUSPEND_MODULES=\"r8169\"\nDo I have the name right?

I created a screencast using recordmydesktop which produced an .ogv file. I believe this is an OGG file encoded using the Theora codec. I'm wondering how can I convert this to MPEG4/H.264? I've tried to use FFmpeg in a naive way, as follows:\nffmpeg -i demo.ogv -f mp4 demo.mp4\n\nHowever this produces an evil blob of dark greens and grays when trying to play it again in MPlayer. I then tried to get more sophisticated, using the command-line flags specified here:\nffmpeg -i demo.ogv \\\n       -s 352x288 -vcodec libx264 -vpre default \\\n       -acodec libmp3lame -ab 192k -ac 2 -ar 44100 -f mp4 \\\n       demo.mp4\n\nBut, the result was the same.\nIf anyone has any insight into what might be the best way to accomplish this task, I'd appreciate it if you could let me know.\n\nA: This is an older question now but a modern FFmpeg (under Xenial Xerus and releases following this) would successfully convert an ogv file in the following manner:\nffmpeg -i input.ogv \\\n   -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 22 \\\n   -c:a aac -b:a 128k -strict -2 \\\n   output.mp4\n\nand this should create an excellent file with great quality playback!\nExtra Tweaks:\nSome tweaks to these settings are more than possible. Here are some of my suggestions:\n\n*\n\n*If you wanted to get a better quality video output decrease the crf setting to something like: -crf 18. Bear in mind that file size increases as the quality setting is lowered.\n\n*Consider adding -movflags +faststart to the command line if you wish to present your video via simple HTTP(S) progressive download.\n\n*Newer versions of FFmpeg (i.e. released after December 5th 2015) will not need the -strict -2 option but it is still needed for Xenial Xerus...\n\n\nA: FF Multi Converter is another great choice, not only for successful .ogv to .mp4 conversation.

GMA500 fixes resolution issues and enables video acceleration. The only problem with the GMA500 drivers I am having is that I can not find a fix for the webcam program called cheese, and I can't find a way to enable the vaapi (Video Acceleration API) backend. Videos don't work with the GMA500 (without vaapi) and I cannot properly use cheese.\nIf anyone can help me out with this I will be grateful because Google isn't helping me much with this problem.\n\nA: The GMA 500 'Poulsbo' has had a history of difficulties. However I found a guide on the Ubuntu Forums that describes itself as the Guide to Get the Best Performace from the GMA 500. The forum thread has over 2.5k posts.\nWhilst I'm not sure if this will get Cheese working, this seems to me the best thing to try.\n\nA: I don't have an answer, but maybe testing with gstreamer-properties will lead you somewhere.  Cheese just uses gstreamer, so if you can get it working in gstreamer-properties then it will work in cheese.\n", "Q: Upgraded to 10.04 LTS and cannot startup I've been running 9.10 on an old Toshiba Satellite laptop for a few months and recently went to upgrade it to 10.04 LTS, using the Update Manager.  After the update, the computer will not boot.  There is an Ubuntu splash screen and then nothing.  Are there any good things to do to troubleshoot?  I've reinstalled 9.10 and can make adjustments before upgrading this time if it will help.\n\nA: Make sure you've unplugged any USB devices that may have plugged in. often, USB devices cause startup process to hang. Also search askubuntu.com for similar questions. Lot of people seems to have this issue. (Including me)\n\nA: An excellent troubleshooting guide when you get the blank screen is availabe at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/BlankScreen. When you begin to troubleshoot with this guide, if you are unable to access the tty using Ctrl+Alt+F2, you can restart the system, and hold right-shift after the bios check to get the grub menu. Then use the second entry, recovery mode, to start the recovery menu. Choose the root entry and you will be able to perform the edits called for. After editing, if asked, choose low graphics mode.\n", "Q: Making diff output more readable I'm looking for a tool that will take diff / debdiff output (and more specifically, the output of this script) and display the result of the comparison in a highly readable, graphical way. Any pointers would be appreciated. \nIdeally, it would be the GTK+, FOSS equivalent of MDR.\nMeld, Diffuse and similar software are not fit for this purpose, since they're intended to work standalone, and don't take input from stdin. \n\nA: Kompare can do this (and is the best GUI diff-viewer IMO):\n./whatchanged package_name | kompare -\n\nNote the '-' given as the input file argument. Most *nix programs have this interface to accept piped input, so you can probably use whichever one you like.\n\nA: If you only have a console, colordiff is a quite good solution.\nTo install it, run this command sudo apt-get install colordiff in a terminal\n\nA: I would use this simple script to use meld (or any of the other existing tools), that way you get a little bit of flexibility:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nTMPDIR=`mktemp -d`\nDIFF_FILE=`mktemp`\nTARGET='./'\n\ncat /proc/$$/fd/0 > $DIFF_FILE\ncd $TARGET\nrsync -apvz --delete --stats --compress --progress $TARGET $TMPDIR\npatch -R -p0 -d $TMPDIR < $DIFF_FILE\nmeld $TARGET $TMPDIR\n\nTested with meld and the output from bzr diff, so copied this into /usr/bin and chmod 755 and I did this:\nbzr diff | meld-diff\nThe results show as expected.\n\nA: I like using vim's internal syntax highlighting as a pager, so that I can view colorized diffs. For example, putting this in your .bashrc:\nsudo apt-get install vim\nalias vless='vim -u /usr/share/vim/vimcurrent/macros/less.vim'\n\n(And then re-source your .bashrc with . ~/.bashrc.) Then you can run vless as your pager:\nvless /path/to/your.diff\n\nIt's not graphical, but it is at least highlighted.\n\nA: Although a KDE application it can be installed without TOO many dependencies, kdiff is an awesome diff editing / merge tool.\n\nA: I know you are not ask for a diff tool integrated to a editor, but I'm sure you can avoid context switch (from editor to terminal, and back to editor) after learn a bit about what your editor can provides. Both, emacs and vim comes with diff tools.\n\n\n*\n\n*For emacs case, you will use Ediff Mode (instaled by default). Look at this wiki page or consulting the official manual \n\n*Using emacs is simple, just type Alt + x and type ediff. \n\n*You can use ediff to browser difference beetween branches and revisions of your repository (bzr, git, svn, etc).\n", "Q: Debian post installation triggers often make my system unusable! Is there something I can do? Mainly it's the menu and monodoc-base triggers that cause the problem. Recently monodoc base has become a major pain. It keeps saying there are a bunch of errors, and uses up 100+ CPU% and makes it impossible to do a thing. I've had to force it to stop so many times now.\nI don't want to lose monodevelop, but will a reinstall work to stop the hell? I got kinda mad and went ahead and did it. Gonna see how it goes, but so far, it's improved.\n\nA: I fixed it O.o.\nRemoving monodoc-everything, and reinstalling that + monodevelop worked. Even the post-install trigger menu is behaving. Looks like I'm going to start hating on mono.\n", "Q: Best place to install apps I am completely new to Ubuntu and I must say AskUbuntu and you folks are of great help. So now when I have started installing and playing with apps, my question is what is the best place to install/download apps? Like in Windows it usually goes under your C: drive and then you manage it under Program Files. Linux structure is quite different with a different folder hierarchy. I have attached the directory structure of my machine as well. I thought this question would help lot of beginners. \n\n\nA: The purpose of those directories is more or less documented in the filesystem hierarchy manpage: man hier.\nNormally you don't have to care where programs go, as the package management will take care of that, but maybe it is good to know that programs or scripts that you install yourself (meaning: outside the package management, without a .deb) should always go under /usr/local/, /opt/ or in your personal home directory.  The difference between the first two is that software under /opt/<programname>/ can bring its own libraries without risking problems with the rest of the system, so it's often used by closed source software that relies on specific library versions.  And in any case, never install your own scripts in /bin/ or /usr/bin/, as you risk conflicts with the package management then.\n\nA: Welcome to the Ubuntu community =)!. Your question gives an interesting perspective on how a windows user views the new world of linux/unix.\nWhen you install (most) applications, they tend to be installed into /usr/bin (on ubuntu), but that is only the binaries. The data files are installed to various other locations, such as /usr/share/applicationnamehere. Libraries generally go into /usr/lib.\nOf course all of this information while useful, will probably still not make it seem any more simple to you. The surprising thing you will soon come to notice, is that Ubuntu automatically places your applications in the appropriate folders for you! If you install a \".deb\" (installer package) it puts everything where it has to go. You don't get the option to choose where it goes, because the system already has you covered, unlike windows.\nThe most simple way for you to get applications to the right places, is simply to use the software center, which from your question I'm guessing you have already started to do. You won't have to worry about a \"Program Files or no Program Files\" issue, Ubuntu's got you covered :)!\nAnother thing to note, all you need to do to run an application is to type its command. For example, to run the standard text editor, press alt+f2, and type gedit, then press enter. Voila!\nYou will find Ubuntu, and desktop linux in general, to be a rather intriguing world to work in. \n", "Q: Tab completion COMP_WORDS bad array subscript I have upgraded my Ubuntu to 10.04 and I am facing this problem of COMP_WORDS bad array subscript when I press TAB for certain completion.

It behaved properly.   \nEven if cream was behaving normally a month ago, it isn't now. \n... because they both use the same version of gvim, the issue is unique to cream.  \nWell, whatever is causing this, be it cream or something else, the net result is a \"bug\".   \nI'll uninstall cream and use gvim...

It runs alright, but even on simple games like teeworlds and minecraft I find they can max out one of my 3 Ghz cores, making the game occasionally choppy.\nIs an ATI card likely to be better?  Is there anything else people can recommended to improve performance?\n\nA: Most games will run at 100% CPU utilisation, its part of their event loop to ensure high priority for what they have to do.  The event loop wants to stay in the CPU cache to ensure a smooth gameplay.\nMost of the time choppy gameplay is down to reading textures from the HDD or network latency.\nIf you have a single core processor, other processes can interrupt the smoothness of the game.\n\nA: I'm using a 9600 GT, and I can play games like Team Fortress 2 (sometimes choppy), but not much newer. A newer card will help, I've had good experiences with nVidia and Linux in the past, the GTS240 and GTX460 are good ones to look at, depending on your price range. \nCheck out the answers to this question for a little more info on what should be able to run:\nGaming on Ubuntu - How far can you take it?\n\nA: If it's your CPU being stressed, I doubt throwing more GPU at it is going to help. The games you mention have modest graphical requirements for which I would expect a 9800GTX to be more than ample.\nI mean sure, the new ATIs are nice and all, but I don't think I could justify that expenditure on Minecraft.\n", "Q: Drapes crashed after adding too many wallpapers The wallpapers managing tool,Drapes, crashed after I add too many wallpapers.Drapes can't be started.

If that's the case, Pulse needs to be at the top of the list in the multimedia settings in System Settings in order for things to work correctly.\n\nA: KDE uses a different sound engine than GNOME. It uses Phonon. I would start there. Go to Settings, System settings, Multimedia in the Hardware section and Phonon at the bottom. Click on backend. \nTry switching from Gstreamer to Xine. Sometimes Gstreamer and PulseAudio do not work well with some sound cards and Xine gives better results. Many GNOME users get better results by installing Totem-xine than using the default Totem with Gstreamer. It is easy to switch back if you don't like it. You may have to logout and back in for that setting to take effect.\nIf it is already Xine then you can try Gstreamer in the same way.\n", "Q: Why is system load average around 9 on login?

All were set up using \"Sharing Options\" in Nautilus' right-click menu. The standard \"Music\" and \"Videos\" folders are configured identically: the \"Guest Access\" box is checked, but the \"Allow others to create and delete\" is not. The third folder, called \"shared\", is configured to not allow Guest access but to allow others to modify files. I have not altered /etc/samba/smb.conf by hand, I have only used Sharing Options to create and modify these so-called \"shares\".\nMy roommates have two Windows 7 computers and one Ubuntu Netbook Remix netbook. I have the aforementioned desktop machine and laptop running 10.04. None of these machines can access any of the shares. Attempts to access the Guest shares result in the message\n\\\\machine\\directory is not accessible. The network name could not be found.\nThis is the error message generated by a VM running Windows 2000. The other Windows machines generate a similar error. The Ubuntu laptop gives the error Unable to mount location: Failed to mount Windows share. Hurrah, once again, for informative error messages. That really helps a lot.\nWhen attempting to browse the folder called \"shared\" from the laptop, I'm confronted with a password dialog. This behavior is the same will all machines I've tried in the situation. On entering my username and password for the account to which the shares belong, the password dialog briefly disappears and is replaced with an identical dialog. No error message, useful or not, appears.\nWhen attempting to browse this folder with the VM, the outcome is the same except that the password dialog helpfully states \"incorrect username or password\". My assumption is that the username and password in question is that of the user which owns the shares. I have tried all other username and password combinations available in this context and the outcome is the same.\nI would like to be able to share files. Sharing them with Windows machines is a nice feature, or would be if it was available. Really I consider sharing files between two machines with the same version of the same operating system kind of a minimum condition for network usability.\nSamba last functioned reliably for me more than ten years ago.

I'm not surprised that your roommate uses Windows 7.  I sometimes have trouble sharing files between Windows XP and Windows 7.  \nI used to work on an Windows XP computer with Ubuntu running in VMware, and transfer files through sharing via Samba.  When I tried the same setup with Windows 7, no joy.  \nIt seems like there's something that's changed in Windows 7.  So unless you are having issues sharing with an Windows XP, I wouldn't exactly say Samba was more reliable 10 years ago.\nreference here and/or try to get newer versions of Samba\nhttp://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Windows7\n\nA: I usually do it by editing the conf file. I did this: sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf, and added this at the end of the file.\n[Shared]\n     comment = My Files\n     path = /home/me\n     read only = yes\n     write list = koanhead\n     guest ok = yes\n\nAt 'write list' mention your system username, so that you only have write permission.

On ubuntu machine open file browser and type this at the location bar smb://ip-of-the-samba-pc/shared\n\nA: You say you were able to make user-level access work. That sounds to me like it is merely your samba configuration that is wrong. In the olden days, I'd have said clear out the samba.conf, and make a simple one that suits your needs, a proper samba.conf doesn't need to be more than 10 lines, maybe.\nAnyways, since then a simpler solution has emerged: install system-config-samba\nsudo apt-get install system-config-samba\nBefore you begin you might like to reset the samba.conf to it's original state. To make sure no \"hidden\" syntax errors have snuck their way in during all the troubleshooting\nThe control panel is quite simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*click the '+' sign\n\n*select directory\n\n*make visible (and writable?)\n\n*go to the 'Access' tab\n\n*choose 'Allow access to anyone'\n\n\nAn alternate (and slightly more proper) way of doing it:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a *nix user named: guest (or whatever you like)\n\n*\n\n*for security reasons make sure \"guest\" has /bin/false as login shell\n(unless you want the guest to be able to login through ssh etc. as well)\n\n\n*in the \"Preferences\" menu: select \"Samba users\"\n\n*make sure \"guest\" is on the list: if isn't create it.\n\n\nthen\n\n\n*\n\n*in the \"Preferences\" menu: select \"Server settings\"\n\n*On the \"Security\" tab: by \"Guest Account\", select 'guest'\n\n\nNow anyone who tries to log in anonymously will be assigned to the user 'guest', and thus will have whatever rights 'guest' has.\n\n\n*\n\n*now create the share as described before, except instead of choosing \"Allow access to everyone\", merely select 'guest'.\n\n\nmake sure the *nix user 'guest' has sufficient rights to read and/or write in the shared folder.\nGood Luck!\n/B2S\n\nA: In order for new Windows systems to access the current/old Ubuntu Samba shares, you need to enable password encryption (encrypt passwords = yes in the smb.conf).  \nThe thing that has changed in Windows 7 is that they have put in a security requirement for Samba passwords to be encrypted.  The same applies to XP if you have KB2536276 installed.  \nI went round & round with this issue on our network at work until I found the solution of changing that \"no\" to \"yes\" on encrypted passwords.  This still works for a wide-open share that everyone has read/write access to with no password - even though you have no password, it still must tell Windows that the nonexistent password is encrypted for Windows to let you on there.  \nThis answer is assuming you have everything else configured for Samba to work correctly, such as users (or the lack thereof) and permissions set.  \nFor the open/easy share with no passwords etc, make sure you have security = share, guest account = nobody, and/or map to guest = Bad User in the conf.\n\nA: I'm sorry to tell this, but I had same problem, my computer were undetectable in LAN, after that I reinstalled the system(clear reinstall with full formatting) and everything worked fine.\n\nA: If using Windows 7, you may need to change your registry settings:\nSee the Samba wiki for more information, or simply execute the file Win7_SambaDomainMember.reg\nIf using Ubuntu 11.10, make sure that you have python-glade2 installed\nsudo apt-get install python-glade2\n\n\nA: An easy solution to share your home folder is to uncomment the lines in the [homes] section of /etc/samba/smb.conf (remove the \";\")\n\nA: I believe  should check wether or not you have firewall/iptables rules preventing it. If you are not sure easiest way is (and also manage iptables in future) to install ufw and \nsudo ufw allow samba\nsudo ufw enable\n\n", "Q: What went wrong with my upgrade to Maverick 10.10?

Even then as root if I try to run some programs it will return to the login screen. The display seems to be fine - it is the onboard S3 - no special drivers.\nPlease help - I am scared to upgrade my other machines!!\n\nA: This could be related to an application or Driver.  I have seen Compiz and other programs crash X in the past, so to start with I would start to disable auto run applications.  \nAs you can't get a desktop, start a new session in Failsafe GNOME mode, using the dropdown for sessions, once you have selected your name.  \n\nThen follow the instructions on this Link to disable your auto start applications.\nIf you have Compiz enabled, follow this link to see how to disable that too.\nHave you tried creating a new user and seeing if the issue affects that account too?\n", "Q: Why does wifi drop out constantly? With any version of Ubuntu I try it seems that I have an issue with wifi.\nTry as I might, I cannot make the wifi stay connected. I have since installed iwScanner and I can see that my wifi network is on a different channel to the others in range. I can also see a signal strength of about -60 consistently except every minute or so (sometimes as often as 10seconds apart) it drops to -100 or essentially nothing.\nIf I boot the same machine into Windows 7 it seems to work okay, other laptops seem to work okay.\nIt is a Linksys WUSB54GC v.3 which seems according to the community docs to be supported. I am not really that far away from the router and besides my mobile phone connects to the wifi network fine from the same distance.\nThe router is getting old so I had considered maybe it was a problem with the router (Draytek) but then I should have issues with the other machines.\nNetwork is not broadcasting its SSID and is using WPA2\nEdit\nAlso the dropouts to -100 signal are much more frequent when I try to connect to the network using network manager. Every ~2 seconds consistently.\n\nA: I have seen a similar problem that was caused by the fact that my laptop scanned for N networks about every minute or so. That dropped the link to my router that did not support N network. I switched to another routher with N support and did not see the problem anymore. Could you have a similar problem? \n\nA: I would first recommend you to try to change the encryption of your router to WPA, and even WEP if necessary. Some drivers have had problems with WPA/WPA2 encryption. Also, it could be realted to overheating. I had a Lenovo Thinkpad with an Intel Wifi card that every now and then would drop its connection. After much testing I discovered it was dropping packets when the card was hot. The same happens to a PCMCIA card I still have.\nGood Luck\nIgnacio\n\nA: As I answered before, don't hide your SSID. It was not meant to be used that way, it is not a security feature, and it may well be the only cause to your problem.\n\nA: I had the same problem, but then I had a very simple answer. I changed my WiFi settings so that I had to manually connect to WiFi; It no longer connected automatically.Then I restarted my laptop, and it all worked. However, If this continues to be an issue for you, and you can't find a good solution, I would either see if it gets fixed in the next OS update, or contact the GNOME e-mail help center.

I just installed Maverick and was surprised that almost all packages are marked as manually installed (linux-headers and wireless-crda aren't). Doesn't that defeat the purpose of the differentiation between automatically and manually installed packages?\n\nA: Okay, now this is the first thing I do right after installation. I mark (almost) every package as automatically installed, and they stay as dependencies of ubuntu-desktop:\napt-mark showmanual | xargs sudo apt-mark auto\nsudo apt-mark unmarkauto ubuntu-desktop \n\nIdeally, that would be enough.

A flaw in the reverse direction would be much worse, because it could cause packages to be removed when they are still needed.

It is based on idTech 5 and uses OpenGL. There is just a need of coorparating with id Software.\n\nA: How do you expect anybody here to be able to answer this with any degree of certainty?\nIf id want to release a Linux version (still not confirmed) and want to sell it through the Software Centre and Canonical are happy to support a 5-8gig game and they can come to an arrangement on the distribution fees, then sure, it could be there.\n", "Q: Installing from Software Center does not create menu entries I notice that sometimes after installing something from the Software Center, the software gets added to a menu and I get a nice message telling me how to launch it.

Is there any way to improve this situation?  What's the best way to \"finish the job\" of installing software that leaves me in this situation (i.e. add it to a menu)?\n\nA: That's depend on how the software is packaged. Almost every application installable by Software Center are then added to the Menu. But some minor application ( some application don't have an icon on Software Center, that is a good advice that won't be shown in the Menu ) or command line applications aren't packaged to be shown on the Menu.\n\nA: Some applications are missing the .desktop file necessary to show an item in the menu.

If I try adding a new partition it complains \"No partition table found on device /dev/sdc\". Creating a msdos partition table seems to work correctly, except that when I go to add a new partition it complains with the same error. What am I missing? \n\nA: Trying using Disk Utility in the Administration Menu (command line: palimpsest) instead of gparted. You should be able to create a partition table with it or replace the existing one.\nIt's entirely possible they use the same libraries & access routines - if that fails i'd suspect your hardware is faulty.\n\nA: You can create it.Open Gparted, right click on allocated space of your USB flash drive and select New.Enter everything as you see in the snapshot below and click add.\n\nNOTE:\nNow fill all the fields as you see in the snapshot below and click add.\n\nNOTE:\nNow goto Edit Menu and select Apply All Operations.\n\nNow new partition is created.\n\nA: Ok, Hew, I too had the same problem when I first got the millenium hard drive enclosure to connect it to the computer via usb port.\nJust follow these steps, and you need to be patient throughout.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up GParted and choose your device.\n\n*Click on Device > Create New Partition Table.\n\n*Click on OK in the dialog window that appears.[NOTE: Do not click apply yet!]\n\n*Then Right-click on the unallocated space, Create a new partition of the desired size.

HP USB disk storage tool and bootice also fail. \n\nA: Just make sure you don't create partitions on the disk if you plan to use it on Windows. Windows has a problem with USB sticks having multiple partitions.\n", "Q: Delete empty \"lost+found\" folder automatically if it's empty Every certain amount of time, Ubuntu checks my filesystems and it creates several empty \"lost+found\" folders.\nCan I disable this feature? Is there any way that Ubuntu deletes automatically these folders if they are empty?\n\nIs there any manner to hide this folder on NFS?\n\nA: Whenever fsck goes through the system and tries to recover damaged files, it will put them into the lost+found folder. I guess this is basically a problem with fsck creating that folder even if there's nothing to put in. As Ubuntu periodically runs those checks on your partitions, those folders will always be re-created, so deleting it won't work.\nIf you just want to hide the folder from Nautilus, you can create a '.hidden' file containing 'lost+found' and put it into the lost+found parent's folder.\nEg. for the lost+found folder in '/':\necho \"lost+found\" | sudo tee /.hidden\nFor the one in you home directory (if any):\necho \"lost+found\" > ~/.hidden\n\nI guess alternatively you can remove them after every boot by adding the following to the file '/etc/rc.local':\nif [ -d /lost+found ]; then\n    rmdir /lost+found 2>/dev/null\nfi\n\nif [ -d /home/USER/lost+found ]; then\n    rmdir /home/USER/lost+found 2>/dev/null\nfi\n\nThis will run rmdir on the folders if they exist, which only removes them if they are empty (2>/dev/null will discard the \"not empty\" message from rmdir). There probably aren't lots of directories, so I kept it simple. Just make sure 'exit 0' stays on the bottom line.\nDownside: this only keeps track of directories created by fsck during boot. If it's run at a later time, you'll again see that directory. You then could put above into a periodically executed cron job.\n\nA: \n[Having a] lost+found directory with a large enough size to contain a large number of unlinked files puts less of a burden on e2fsck to create the directory and grow it to the appropriate size.\n[fsck will attempt to create lost+found if it doesn't exist], but in the face of a corrupt filesystem, it can be more risky.\nVery old fsck's for other filesystems on other platforms were not able to create /lost+found, nor were they able to grow it. This is the history for the rationale of /lost+found...\n\nIt is needed much less often since ext3.  With a journaling filesystem, files shouldn't get \"lost\" on a crash / power failure.  You might argue it's only kept to avoid fatal surprises for old-timers (and weirdos who disable the journal).  If you don't know what you're missing, maybe it's not a problem.\nStill, removing it is like patching e2fsck.  You \"can\" do it, but you shouldn't.\n\nA: This article will give you a proper explanation about lost+found directory :\nhttp://tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/lostfound.html\n\nA: cd where the lost+found folder is located\nsudo touch .hidden\nsudo mcedit .hidden (Write lost+found and save with F2.)\n", "Q: Change Docky icons for Wine applications? is there a way of customizing the icons shown in Docky for wine applications (including starter and running applications)?\nMost Windows programs have icons with too low resolution by default, so I'd like to assign better icons to them. \nThanks in advance!\nYSN\n\nA: What's wrong with creating a new launcher (for example on your desktop), setting the icon to one you like and then dragging that launcher onto Docky?\nJust tried it and it works here.\nEdit to try and help, here's the source of my modified launcher:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Darkstar One\nExec=bash -c \"cd \\\\\"~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/GOG.com/Darkstar One\\\\\" & wine explorer /desktop=DarkstarOne,1920x1200 DarkStarOne.exe\"\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=true\nPath=/home/oli/.wine/dosdevices/c:/Program Files/GOG.com/Darkstar One/\nIcon=/home/oli/Desktop/darkstar.jpg\n\n/home/oli/Desktop/darkstar.jpg is the location of the new icon.

It seems to be part of larger apps, but what if I just want the invoice capability without a lot of overhead?\n\nA: Check BambooInvoice or SimpleInvoices. They are both free, open source, web based invoice mangers. You will need to host them on your site or you will need to setup a LAMP server on your machine. If you don't need a server for anything else and won't be allowing external access to it, then you can use XAMPP, which is pretty easy to setup.\nDemos:\nBambooInvoice | SimpleInvoices\nBambooInvoice\n\nSimpleInvoices\n\n\nA: The best way to create an invoice is with a spreadsheet, there are a number of spreadsheet applications available in Ubuntu, the main one is the program called calc from the OpenOffice.org Office suite, this is usually installed by default, if you find calc a bit too heavy just to do an invoice then there is the nice lightweight but powerful gnumeric, a gnome based spreadsheet, you can install it by typing sudo apt-get install gnumeric in your terminal or just search for gnumeric in the software center, here is a sample invoice template for gnumeric: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1035299/Ubuntu_Community/Templates/Sales_Invoice_1.gnumeric\nThis template can be placed in your Templates folder located in your home directory, any time you need an invoice just right click where you want the file to stay, click “Create Document”  in the right click context menu, the item should appear on the flyout menu just click on it and you will have a copy of the invoice in the location you right clicked, you can then rename it and then double click the file, gnumeric will open the file quickly so you can enter your items and costs, this is a pretty swift and lightweight way to ready an invoice for your clients.\n\nA: I'm a fan of freshbooks http://www.freshbooks.com\n", "Q: Need an applet to report web sites unavailability Is there a gnome applet that will let me configure a list of URLs to be verified and report when some is unavailable ? \nPreferably using notifiations.\nThe validation must use HTTP GET or HEAD .\n\nA: You could write a small bash script to throw notifications at you...

You might need to export DISPLAY=:0 in cron so the notification shows up in the right place.\nNote that if you use a DNS intermediary like OpenDNS, if a domain name you ping doesn't exist, it'll hit their no-domain search server.

Can you clarify if a simple ping is enough?  Some websites, for example, won't let you ping them.  Worse, getting a ping doesn't guarantee that the website is actually up.\nSince you've specified that you'd like this solution to be URL-based, you can use Oli's solution above, but first :\nsudo apt-get install httping\nAnd the script becomes :\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor site in $(cat ~/.sites); do\n    if ! httping -c 1 -g \"$site\" &>/dev/null ; then \n      notify-send \"$site is down!!\"\n    fi\ndone\n\nNOTE : This wasn't working for me until I realised that I had configured my home router to use OpenDNS.

I then use :e otherfile to open a second file, and make some changes to that. Again, without saving the changes, I'd like to go back to the first buffer. I'm using :bn for that, but when I do I get E37: No write since last change .... If I do :bn! then I can change back to the first buffer. From the first buffer I can change back to the second buffer with a straight :bn, but I have to do :bn! to go from the second buffer to the first every time.\nI've got set bufhidden=hide in my vimrc, but if I run :set bufhidden? in Vim I get bufhidden=. Is that the problem maybe?\nEdit: I've narrowed the problem down a bit. In the first file, :set bufhidden? returns bufhidden=hide, but in the second file, it returns bufhidden=. What's up with that? Am I missing something fundamental about Vim buffers here?\nEdit2: Ok, it seems like set bufhidden=hide only applies to the first buffer opened. It needs to be explicitly called in subsequent buffers. I must be completely missing the point here, because this doesn't seem useful.\n\nA: Ok, I was just being an idiot. I didn't want set bufhidden=hide in my vimrc - that's just for a single buffer. Now that I've changed it to set hidden everything works as I felt it should.\n", "Q: How do I re-activate (wake?) the monitors from the command line My machine is a little weird on the graphics/monitors. I'll go into that in a bit, but I'm specifically looking for how to do the following:\nWhen the monitors are standing by, but the system is running, usually pressing a key on the keyboard will wake them up. Is there a way to accomplish the same kind of waking up from the command line, when remotely connected over the network?\nThe specifics of what this solves for me is that when I reboot my machine, the nvidia powermizer settings get reset to adaptive. Because this is a managed desktop I cannot edit /etc/ files to change this. I do have something that sets it to maximum performance once I log it. This eliminates the flicker I get on my second display port monitor, and it allows the screens to wake up after being timed out to stand by.  So, if I reboot and do not log in, the screens might sleep, and then not wake up. However the machine is still running fine.\nIf you're curious the driver is nvidia 195.36.24, the card is a Quatro FX 580, the monitors are two Dell U2410 attached via display port (DFP-3 & 4); the VBIOS is 62.94.96.00.05\nThanks.\nPS would create tags sleep and powermizer\nUpdate\nAs much as the answer is correct for my question, it seems that the state of non-waking monitors cannot be gotten out of this way.\n\nA: xset dpms force on\n\nIf you have a more complicated system where you need to wake more than one display, you could iterate through them with something like this:\nfor display in `ps aux | grep -oE \"/usr/bin/X\\s[^ ]+\" | cut -d \" \" -f 2`; do\n    xset -display $display dpms force on;\ndone\n\n\nA: I don't expect this to work for many people, but if you're having the same problem as I was having on Ubuntu 16, this will work over SSH (not sure if you need X11 forwarding):\nsudo unity-control-center\n\nsomehow did it.\n", "Q: Anyway to get a Palm Pilot (Tungsten E2) to sync with evolution or thunderbird? any thoughts or suggestions?\n\nA: Installing gnome-pilot  will allow you to sync your Palm to Evolution once you configure it (it's found in System > Preferences > PalmOS Devices). The first time you use gnome-pilot (\"PalmOS Devices\"), you will get a setup wizard like shown below. If you have issues, you may need to change the Type: and/or Device: settings; my setup is as shown below. \nThere are other sync programs (like JPilot) but gnome-pilot is the only one I know that can get your data into one of those programs.\n\n\n", "Q: Download just .html files over FTP In a website maintenance job, my client has an FTP server with the website on.

I want to get a copy of all the relevant files but at the same time, I don't want to waste time downloading dozens of gigabytes of stuff I'll never need.\nThe FTP is mounted in ~/.gvfs at the moment. Is there something quick and easy I can do to copy all the .html files out, keeping the directory structure so that when I'm done working on the files, I can just copy them back using merge/replace?\n\nA: I didn't test this but the following should work:\nrsync -av --include \"*/\" --include \"*.html\" --exclude \"*\" ~/.gvfs/. /path/to/destination\n\n\nA: You can try using the Filezilla FTP client.

If I need Sun Java, Adobe Flash Plugin or anything else that comes from Canonical Partners the package downloads are painfully slow even small sized packages like the Flash plugin, to speed things up I have to go here: http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/pool/partner/ to find what I want, download the packages with a download manager (which is usually about 20 times faster than the package manager) and then place them in my /var/cache/apt/archives folder I run the package manager afterwards, as long as the right versions of the packages I ask to install  are detected in the /var/cache/apt/archives folder they will be installed immediately. I would like to stop doing this, so I am wondering if anyone else has this problem, what could be the cause and if there is a fix. I am located in the Western Caribbean region.\nI think it would be helpful to note that all other packages coming from the repository I have selected with synaptic download at acceptable speeds.\n\nA: Use apt-fast. It is a replacement for apt-get that speeds up download greatly as it uses axel download accelerator for downloading and is a brilliant front end for dpkg. For more information refer to this page.\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2010/08/you-can-now-install-apt-fast-from-ppa.html\n\nA: Ubuntu attempts to select a local mirror of the repositories that are geographically close to you. The partner repo doesn't have any mirrors because of copyright issues (AFAIK -- it's non-free software) so you end up using the London-hosted copy. PPAs are probably the same.\nAs you're in the Caribbean, I imagine traffic UK-bound would have to hop through the US before going trans-Atlantic to London. That's a long way for something to travel and if any of the links are bad or lossy, traffic can grind to a slow speed. At the least, response time is very slow.\nIf you want to test this further you can run ping archive.canonical.com and see what you get for a response time (I'm in England and get ~26ms). And as a general speedtest to London, you can run wget http://london1.linode.com/100MB-london.bin (1.3MB/s here).\nAs for fixing the problem... Canonical either need more, geographically-distrubuted servers for the partner repo, or you need to move closer to London.\n", "Q: Customize Gnome-Do's default action order I'm using Gnome-Do with the \"Files and Folders v2.5\" plugin. I set it to read my .scripts folder, so that I might run my personal scripts from Gnome-Do. The only problem is that Gnome-Do's standard action for shell scripts is to open them instead of running them. That forces me to Tab and scroll-down every time. How can I change Gnome-Do's standard action?\nAn example for clarity:\nI have a foo.sh executable file inside my .scripts folder. When I type foo inside Gnome-Do, it correctly selects the file and offers the Open action. I then have to Tab, press Down, and hit Enter to select the Run action instead. I would the Run action to be first on the list.\nAlternatively, a more appropriate way to integrate Gnome-Do with personal scripts would be fine as well.\n\nA: This is not directly possible in Do, but it does have a capability to learn what you mean.  The default action for any item is always the action you've used most frequently out of the possible actions for that item.\nSo, one way of getting what you want would be to just use the run action a lot from Do.\nAnother way would be to inform Do that your script is an “application” that's runnable, like Firefox or Evolution or such.  Do determines the list of applications by searching for .desktop files in the standard locations.  One of these locations is ~/.local/share/applications.  So, if you create a foo.desktop file looking something like:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nName=Foo desktop frobinator\nGenericName=Desktop frobinator\nComment=Awesomeate your desktop!\nExec=/home/raof/.scripts/foo.sh\nIcon=shotwell\nTerminal=true\nType=Application\nCategories=Graphics;Photography;GNOME;GTK;\n\nyou'll get a “Foo desktop frobinator” runnable item in Do.\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu Server properly manage the power settings on a netbook? I'm planning to install Ubuntu Server on a netbook to minimize power consumption.\nAre there any special considerations I should make for this kind of setup? Will Ubuntu Server properly manage the laptop's power settings and CPU scaling by default, or will I need to make changes to the configuration or install packages that would normally only be found in Ubuntu Desktop?\n\nA: Yes, CPU scaling will work as expected, this is part of the core OS that isn't different between Desktop and Server. If you want things like suspend-on-lid-close to work, though, you may need have some of the Gnome stack running to gain gnome-power-manager.\n\nA: if you want to use your netbook as server, then you can install ubuntu-server, but if you want to install a server-dedicated system to make some economy on resources usage then simply install xubuntu or zenwalk (a slackware based system)\n", "Q: Is it safe to install Compiz Experimental Plugins 0.1.1 on Maverick?

I have installed the version 7.0a of Truecrypt in both Operating Systems.\nLocated in the Windows 7 HDD I have a 150 GB encrypted file container. It is a standard and dynamic file container, which means it's not hidden and uses a sparse file. This file was created using the Windows version of the Truecrypt program. When I logon in Windows the container is mounted as the drive E: and everything works fine!\nIn Ubuntu the Windows's NTFS file system is automaticaly mounted after I logon. I've configured that using the ntfs-config package. In my ~/.profile I have this line to mount the truecrypt's file container:\ntruecrypt /media/7EDEBCFADEBCABB1/Users/Wagner/hd/hd.tc /media/truecrypt1\n\nThe file container is mounted after the logon without any problem. I can access it, copy files to/from it, etc. But when I try do copy relatively large amounts of data (>~50 MB) to it via nautilus or cp -R, it starts the copy, copies some data until certain point and then it just hangs! The progress bar does not move anymore and nothing happens. There is no error, it just hangs and that's it. I have to kill the process myself.\nThis problem does not happen in Windows: I can copy very large amounts of data to the container and it works great. But in Ubuntu the problem always happens! I mean, whenever I try to copy a bunch of files together the copy process hangs.\nDoes anyone ever faced this problem? Can anyone help?\nThanks!\n\nA: I have versions of the TC 7.1 and the same thing happens with Ubuntu 11.10 with copying large files. When copying large files from one virtual disk TrueCrypt (ntfs partition) on the second disc tc (ext4 partition) crashes the system.

I have written an application, and I'm now interested in creating a Debian package and setting up a PPA. The application is written primarily in XSLT, and includes a very thin front-end that can be written in any language that can access an XSLT processor. I currently have front-ends written in JavaScript (able to run in the browser client, and from the command-line under Rhino) and Python. I'd also like to write a front-end entirely in bash, and simply use one of the command-line XSLT processors available in apt.\nThere are several available via apt, including xsltproc, xalan, and 4suite's xslt processor. I'd like to make the bash front-end flexible so that it is able to use any of these command-line clients, and will simply use whichever is available. \nHow can I best express in terms of Debian's package dependency system the relationship between my package and these three other packages, which is a logical disjunction (OR relationship)?\nMy package relies on xsltproc OR 4suite OR xalan. Ideally, when my package is installed, the user should be prompted to choose any of these three package to install as a dependency; and if one of these packages is already installed on the system when my package is installed, then no additional dependencies should be installed. Is such a thing possible with Debian packages?\n\nA: OR relationships can be expressed like xsltproc | 4suit | xalan in the Depends: field for the binary package in debian/control.

I know a very fast repository I often use to install packages,  I would dearly like to use this when I am setting up Ubuntu, the mirror used by setup when the region is choosen is usually very slow, this results in apt configuration taking a long time.\nI usually have to remove network connectivity from the machine I am setting up and the setup process will quickly complete. I then use synaptic to change to the fast repository before installing all those large packages I need, it would be much smoother though, if I did not have to do this and could feed the setup process repository information before hand.\nI am wondering if I use the synaptic package manager in the live session and select a repository if the selected repository will be the one used during setup or will the setup process use the one it thinks is best usually a local mirror?\n\nA: Boot into the live session (not installer), open synaptic, change repository, refresh and without restarting open Install Ubuntu from Desktop.\nUbuntu live cd has a virtual RAM drive where changes are recognised.\n", "Q: iPython Like Command History For Shell For those of you who don't do python programming on ubuntu, ipython is a python shell on steroids, but it has this amazing feature that it not only autcompletes based on known names (i.e. the same way bash does when you press tab), but if you start typing a command and press up, it doesn't scroll through the entire history (like bash) but only through the recent commands that started with the same string of leters. \nSo if you did some long command like scp -r -P 8000 -l user server.com:~/dir/to/copy ./ followed by several other commands. If you started typing scp and pressed up, bash would display the command shown before instead of just scrolling through the entire history.\nIs there an extension like this for bash? or is there any shell that offers this kind of feature?\n\nA: Try hitting Ctrl + R, and typing a few letters. It works in the reverse order as well.\n\nA: And don't forget the fantastic history expansion shortcuts in bash. 1\nI'm posting some excerpts from the manpage,  in case you haven't tattooed them on your arm (or memorized them). \n   Event Designators  \n       An event designator is a reference to a command line entry in the  his‐\n       tory list.\n\n       !

To mitigate the scope of bash's feature theft, the bash man page says \n   The shell supports a history expansion feature that is similar  to  the\n   history  expansion in csh.  \n\nSo, it's \"similar\".  Any of this might break in csh or tcsh.  Or whichever csh descendent you are not using due to the fact that it isn't as wonderful as bash . \n\nA: Bash does have that feature too, but it's not enabled by default. You can bind it to cursor up/down by sticking this into ~/.inputrc:\n\"\\e[A\": history-search-backward\n\"\\e[B\": history-search-forward\n\nI prefer to bind it to Ctrl+up/down instead:\n\"\\e[1;5A\": history-search-backward\n\"\\e[1;5B\": history-search-forward\n\n\nedit: To preserve ctrl+left and ctrl+right for moving back and forward in whole words, also include these lines in ~/.inputrc file:\n# mappings for Ctrl-left-arrow and Ctrl-right-arrow for word moving\n\"\\e[1;5C\": forward-word\n\"\\e[1;5D\": backward-word\n\"\\e[5C\": forward-word\n\"\\e[5D\": backward-word\n\"\\e\\e[C\": forward-word\n\"\\e\\e[D\": backward-word\n\n\nA: There is an alternative similar to what @ak2 mentioned above, but you do not have to create a new .inputrc file.\nInstead, if you have sudo permissions, you can enable this in the /etc/inputrc file. In this file are various keyboard settings including the history search feature (for 18.04 at least). The excerpt from /etc/inputrc is:\n# alternate mappings for \"page up\" and \"page down\" to search the history\n# \"\\e[5~\": history-search-backward\n# \"\\e[6~\": history-search-forward\n\nSimply uncomment the bottom two lines using a sudo file editor (e.g., $ sudo vim), and a new terminal session will have the history search feature (for all users).\n", "Q: Disappearing window borders after reboot Since the install of Ubuntu Desktop 10.10, any launched programs shows up without a windowborder. \nI update daily, but the problem remains. Until now I found only one \"remedy\" that fixes the problem (until the next reboot). This \"remedy\" is not logical to me and is something I just stumbled upon.\nOn the desktop I choose with a right mouseclick for the option 'Change Desktop Background'. When this window popsup I choose the last tab for 'Visual Effects'. Then I choose any of the options other then 'normal'. The program starts looking for a driver, but fails to find any. At the moment the program reports this back to me.... surprise......all the windowborders are visible and stay that way until I reboot.\nI can not explain this, but I would like to find a real and permanent solution to this problem.\n\nA: Sometimes this problem shows up to me too. I found out a workaround for this. If you have the Compiz Fusion Icon installed (package fusion-icon) you can click on it with the right button and then click on the 'Reload Window Manager' option. This always works for me.\nSure it's not the solution for the problem, but it might help you until it gets fixed. And I'm sure there is a command which reloads the window manager without having to install the fusion icon, but I don't know it. If anybody knows the command please post a comment.\n\nA: It's a graphics card driver issue.  The driver you are currently using isn't working nicely with compiz.  what graphics are and which driver are you using?\n\nA: It is random problem, caused by driver and timing issues with upstart. More quick workaround (for me) is Alt-F2, then type metacity and Enter.\nIf that happens every boot, you can add \nsleep 10 && metacity --replace\n\nto your startup apllications.\n\nA: I've seen this in two situations, the first:\nI've had that issue twice in Maverick (10.10) now, both times caused by an incompatible libdecoration0, which comes with compiz.  To see if you've got the same error I did, when Gnome starts, type compiz --replace (in a terminal, so you can see stdout output).  To fix this, I removed the version of Compiz I'd upgraded to 0.9.0 and 0.9.2 (at different times) and rolled back to the 0.8.6 version which came at install.\nThe second (probably more common), relates just to the install of my nVidia drivers and attempting to use the nvidia xorg driver when the kernel DKMS kernel module has been compiled/loaded correctly.  Thankfully, nowadays this is a two line fix (simply reinstall the nvidia drivers to rebuild the DKMS module):\n\napt-get purge nvidia-glx-185 apt-get\n  purge nvidia-glx-185 nvidia-settings\n\nOf course, your setup involves and ATI card and fglrx driver, but it's probably worth giving the above a go (substituting Nvidia for ATI of course).  See if you can get an error/log readout too.\n\nA: the following always does the trick for me:\n\ncompiz --replace\n\nIf above doesn't does the trick, then try:\n\ngnome-panel --replace\n\n\nA: It happens to me sometimes, I just hit ALT+F2 and type\ngtk-window-decorator --replace\n\nTry this solution for permanent fix: \nLaunch the Terminal and type: \nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n-After the installation go to System>Preferences>CompizConfig Settings MAnager (from the menus on top).\n-scroll down until you find Window decorations.\n-find Command and use one of those: \n/usr/bin/compiz-decorator\n\nOR\ngtk-window-decorator --replace\n\nThis should fix it for you.\n\nA: At one stage in upgrading the xorg drivers for my video card (through daily updating), compiz uninstalled itself. Through trial and error I have found two ways to fix this issue.two things can fix this.\nFirst...\nsudo apt-get install compiz\n\nif that doesn't work, sometimes this will fix it.\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nupdates break my video card drivers all the time.

It runs Linux with the touchscreen support. Plus, it is not just \"nicely priced,\" but has an extremely reasonable price tag: $105. \n\nA: I use Ubuntu in a HP Pavilion tx2500 it works great. \nSince Lucid touch screen and pen works out of the box.

I loaded up 10.10 on my computer and managed to \"make\" the programs I needed but find an issue with the AC97 sound card. All day and most of the night and day today I tried all the tips and nothing. It seems 10.10 isn't playing nicely with this program :( The program is DSD1.4.1 found here: http://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/DSD - actually it is links to the two required files under DOWNLOAD. The mbelib-1.2.3-src.tar needs to be worked first as DSD requires this to operate. I got it all done, did the \"make\" and when I try to run it I get the following:\nDigital Speech Decoder 1.4.1\nmbelib version 1.2.3\nioctl reset error\nioctl speed error\nioctl stereo error\nioctl setfmt eror\nAudio In/Out Device: /dev/audio\n\nI learned today from another user that the two prior versions of Ubuntu work but that 10.10 doesn't. As I said I tried all the tips on both sites but no luck. My internet connection is too slow to DL anything as large as this (17 hours) so I am a bit stuck! The other user also had the exact same issue using 10.10, and the sound still works, just not using the program DSD.... very odd. Hoping someone here can figure out whats going and maybe a fix for it. \nI later found out it seems no sound cards are working properly but can't verify this one. It does only happen with version 10.10 though. \nThank you in advance!\n John\n\nA: The flag here lies in the last line of output that you provided; it demonstrates that the program uses the older, deprecated OSS interface that was removed in 10.10.  Have you tried using padsp $program (where $program is the name of the executable that you ran to obtain the output that you included above)?\n\nA: In my experimentation here,  padsp does not work with DSD.\nthere are certain types of binaries that padsp doesnt work with (type man padsp for details) and I'm fairly convinced that dsd is one of them , though lack the coding skills to prove it \nregression to ubuntu 10.04 LTS will fix fix john's problem\nthere is a rumour (ubuntu forums) that killing /dev/audio was done as a temporary bugfix that got overlooked in the release, but I have yet to see a fix for it \n", "Q: A simple script.

I am using Ubuntu 10.10 Netbook Edition with classic desktop interface (No Unity). For visual and usability purposes, I want to use compiz. I, however, afraid Unity support will be broken when i install on my machine.\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: If you're using the standard GNOME (\"Ubuntu Desktop Edition\") session, it should already default to Compiz if it works on your hardware. You don't have to separately install it. \nYou should be able to switch to Unity by choosing the \"Ubuntu Netbook Edition\" session without problems, in which case Compiz won't be running, and won't interfere with Unity in any way.\n", "Q: How to \"mash together\" the contents of 2 hard drives? Previous research suggests that I need an LVM.  However, I can't find anything for what to do about data being on both drives.  I took the hard drive of an existing, running 10.04 computer and put it into another existing, running, machine.  I want to be able to access the files like they were on the local(booting) hard drive.  For example, having the applications that were previously installed on the \"foreign\" drive accessible through the \"Applications\" button.  Any suggestions?\n\nA: You could merge the contents using a union mount, but this would not do what you want. All the system files from the new hard drive would mask the entire system on the boot hard disk, so you would effectively be trying to replace the whole operating system while it is running, not just the newly installed applications.\nIf you want to make the second system into a \"clone\" of the first, with all the same applications installed, you can use aptitude. First, you run aptitude-create-state-bundle on the first system. This creates a record of all the applications you have installed. You copy this file to the second system, and then use aptitude-run-state-bundle on it. This will install all those same applications on the second system.\n\nA: I think that's impossible, there is only one root fs (/). But you can always boot from your second drive, just run sudo update-grub while its connected.\n\nA: It's not possible because:\n1) Changing from non LVM to LVM requires to rebuild your partitions (data loss)\n2) You can not merge existing running systems, it would bring all the sort of problems like only keeping the package database from one system\nYou only option is to backup user data, reconfigure the diks with LVM and reinstall.\n", "Q: Getting back Ubuntu's default boot splash I am a Gnome user. Just out of curiosity, I installed the package kubuntu-desktop to check out the latest KDE. The package has hijacked and replaced the nice ubuntu boot splash with the blue KDE one.

On Windows, I have found Foxit Reader to be quite handy when I need to highlight texts in PDF document, make annotations, etc. etc. Unfortunately, I have not yet found product as user friendly (which also does not corrupt PDF files...) and full-featured as Foxit software...\nAny recommendations?\n** UPDATE **\nI just tried the Open Office PDF import extension. It seems to work ok... If anyone used it for a while, I'd appreciate your feedback on that one. Thanks!\n** UPDATE **\nYou can't highlight text with OpenOffice's PDF extension.\nDoesn't matter, I was reading this thread and found out about Xournal . As it turns out, it's in the repository. It does not natively save in PDF, but once all edits are done, the document can be exported to PDF (and overwrite the old one, just like Gimp with the native .XCE format and original PNG file, for example)\nI realize that this question is no longer a question in itself, but could be migrated to community wiki. However, feedbacks are still welcome!\n** EDIT **\nSo... to close up this question, I have to say that I adopted Xournal . It is light and works pretty well, even on multi-page PDF documents.\nThank you all for your answers!\n\nA: You can always try evince, okular or even Acrobat Reader from Software Center.\nOr install wine and just use Foxit Reader.\n\nA: If you do not mind using wine, my recommendation would be to use PDF-Xchange with wine, I found PDF-Xchange, the portable version, to be the best wine based solution, you can use it to annotate, update pdf metadata, measure page, fill out and save forms, and a few more things, there will be no watermarks in saved pdfs, its rendering of pdf documents is blindingly fast, it puts Adobe Acrobat Reader running on any platform  to shame even  when it is running under wine, I have annotated and updated the metadata of hundreds of documents with this tool and have no problems with PDF corruption, in fact it will offer to fix xref tables in documents corrupted by pdfmod or other pdf software, it is available here: http://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-viewer, it runs beautifully under wine. I wished a free product like this was available natively for Linux. \nThere is a commercial Java based system called, PDF Studio available here: http://www.qoppa.com/pdfstudio/index.html\nClaims to do a lot, similar to Adobe Acrobat Professional, runs natively on Linux, I do not know how good it is, I think they offer a free trial copy so if you do not mind commercial applications you could check it out.\n\nA: Foxit Reader for Desktop Linux\n\nA: Based on neuromancer's comment, I have tested many tools and, even to this day, 2 years after this question was asked, Xournal  is still the best PDF annotation tool.\nBy creating a layer on top of the PDF document (which acts as a \"background\"), it does not directly modify the edited PDF and allows highlighting and adding text.\nIt might not be the software I was expecting in the first place, but definitely does the job.\n\nA: I would suggest Master PDF editor. It is available from the Software Centre, and provides a fully featured PDF and XPF document editor.\n\n\nA: A linux version of foxit reader is available for linux.  see at http://www.foxitsoftware.com/products/reader/non.php\nBe aware that this is not an open-source/free software !\n\nA: As Sabacon mentioned, there is PDF Studio a java based tool that is very comprehensive. There's an evaluation version that adds watermarks on documents. To get rid of the watermarks, you have to pay. \n\nA: PDF-Xcahnge Viewer is a great tool to annotate PDFs (even though add/remove/move pages is available only in the paid version).\nThis is a Windows program, but work flawlessly on Wine.\n\nA: I would like to elaborate 'sabacon' answer. Though there are many open source pdf editors available including 'PDF studio' but they seem to have less functionality and stability. Believe me I have used all possible pdf editors and I was so frustrated that I proposed to write one for my Masters project. Finally I settled on PDFXchange viewer on Linux with wine. I use it on Windows all the time and is feature rich just like a professional editor. All you have to do is install it using wine.\nFrom my experience I have found that it does not work well will 64 bit Wine so you may want to make a wine prefix (32 bit) and install it there.

For example, de-fragmenting, disc cleanup, or stuff like that?\n\nA: You want to make regular backups of all important documents, that's the most important \"regular maintenance\" task there is.  But of course you're already doing this...  ;-)\n\nFurthermore, you can use applications like Computer Janitor to clean up unneeded libraries, old kernels, etc.\nIn most cases fragmentation is not really a big issue, and in any case it won't harm you as much as it did in the old days.  The files that are most likely to get fragmented are probably log files (which really isn't all that important; if you need them microseconds are not what you care about) and more in general when small chunks of data get written to several files in parallel.  I wouldn't worry about this though, as long as you don't see filesystem performance degrade badly (my main desktop was installed in 2007 and upgraded ever since, and I don't see any performance issues, even if at some times both partitions have been quite full).\n\nA: Not really. There is no need to defrag the disks, because they don't get fragmented unless you have like 99% of the disk full. There is no need for a cleanup, unless you are really low on space. Performance is not an issue, like in Windows. There is also no need to cleanup the registry, because Ubuntu doesn't have one.\nHowever, some applications might need maintenance. For instance, Firefox databases might become bloated with time, so you need to vacuum them to keep the performance high. Any application that uses SQLite files can suffer from the same issue.\nIf you want to do cleanup, see CCleaner equivalent?.\nWhat I do to avoid wasting space is to always cleanup the apt cache. This is what I use when upgrading packages:\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nThe first command cleanup the cache, the second update the software sources, the third upgrades necessary packages and the last one uninstall unnecessary software.\n\nA: While you don't have to do regular cleanups, there may be times you want to cleanup unnecessary stuff to make some more disk space and lighten the system.\nCheck Cleaning up a Ubuntu GNU/Linux system at UbuntuGeek.\nUpdate: also How do I free up disk space? here (as DrKenobi refers).\n\nIf you use firefox, there are addons like Vacuum Places Improved to optimize database.  \nI also prefer creating a tmpfs point for the entire firefox profile -- but that would be a matter of personal preference. As an additional advantage, this helps me maintain a profile backup -- just in case.\n\nA: For a typical Ubuntu user, here is what you can do :\n\n\n*\n\n*use the Computer Janitor (System > Administration) to cleanup old packages and all use the apt-get command line tool to cleanup up unused packages\n\n*the Trash (bottom right corner of the screen) to cleanup deleted files\n\n*manual maintenance of your home (/home/~username) directory\n\n\nOther than that, you don't need to defragment your hard drive, really. As for spywares and all, I never had any problem so far (for a typical user).\n\nA: Nope, the nature of (and, a bit, obscurity of) Linux means defragmenting, registries, and viruses are not an issue. However, Linux does accumulate a bit of useless data which doesn't slow your computer down but does take up hard drive space (an issue if you're using an SSD). This is easy enough to fix -  you can run 'apt-get autoremove' in a terminal to remove unneeded packages, and/or install Ubuntu Tweak from the software center or terminal:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\nwhich is generally a great tool to have under your belt anyways. It has a janitor feature that can automatically detect and, when selected, clean up your old kernels, unneeded packages, browser caches, and more.\n", "Q: Why are indicator applets not working? The indicator applet and the indicator applet session are not showing anything for some reason. Last time I was on ubuntu they were working fine.\n\nDoes anyone know why this might happen?\nThe last time I was on Ubuntu, I had uninstalled unity, would that have anything to do with this?\n\nA: From the screenshot it looks like you're missing sound and message indicators.\nUninstalling unity will have removed these indicators too, so you just need to reinstall them and hopefully restarting (logging off should do it) will put everything back.\nsudo apt-get install indicator-applet indicator-messages indicator-sound\n", "Q: Upgrade from Intrepid to Lucid, using CDROM I want to upgrade a PC from Intrepd to Lucid, but I can only go as far as 9.10, even though I have \"Show only LTS\" enabled in Sources.

So, a re-install is the absolute last option.\n\nA: My answer to a similar question applies to you in this case.\n\nA: You're trying to skip an awful lot of development there. Two years worth of upgrades is quite a leap. You may want to do the upgrade to 9.10, and then to 10.04 from there. The only way to know for sure, of course, is to pop in a 10.04 CD and then attempt an upgrade!\n\nA: For non-LTS releases, the furthest you can usually upgrade is the next release. LTS releases can usually jump from LTS to the next LTS.\nThis is the case because there's a certain amount of transformation that each release does to the old install. LTS installers know the state of the previous LTS but it's not practical (from a testing standpoint) for every installer to have every combination of previous install.\nI'm already surprised that it'll go as far as 9.10.\n", "Q: Any idea how to use tail -f in Squid to see logging and processing on localhost?

Numbers were accepted and they too were underlined, but only a few keys allowed me to break out.   \nI then tried Ctrl+Shift+Alt+U immediately followed by Ctrl+Shift+Alt+E.\nThis produced an unprintable  hex 000E(?) and broke out of the loop... \nThe unprintable character got me thinking that this may be Unicode related. \nIf so, how so?  What is happening here?\nIs this underscored u a trigger for an Input Method Editor? \nThis behaviour occurs:  Here (as I type), \"gedit\", text-edit fields... (but not in the Terminal)... and \"gvim\" reported \"pattern not found\"...\n\nA: Ctrl-Shift-U is the short-cut to start entering a full unicode character by hand.

(aside: The wrong glyph appears in Ubuntu 12.04. It should be SO not SS. see below)\nTo see the different glyphs available use either the character map icon utility or one of the following terminal commands:  \ngnome-character-map\ngucharmap\n\nConsequent to this, by holding down the right button and \"mousing\" over the map the unicode in the bottom corner and the symbol with its defining font (if any) are displayed (circled in green for this example). In this case, for U+000E, the \"character\" is not printable so there is no symbol and thus no font. The other squares, highlighted in yellow for this example, are similarly unprintable because they are also control codes and associated with the characters circled in yellow. Thus ctrl-D or ^D is the same as U+0004. \nTo see this, open a new terminal window and instead of using the standard ^D convention to close and exit the window, simply press and hold Ctrl-Shift while typing U then 4 and then release Ctrl-Shift.

Thanks in advance\n\nA: I would advise that you leave your sound servers alone, maybe you should try if a USB based headphone will help work around the problem until the bug is fixed, also make sure that it is really not a hardware issue, I had an old Dell Inspiron that had a similar problem and it turned out that the problem was hardware failure, Windows that came on it with the proper drivers had the same problem.\n\nA: Have you tried to explicitly set the sound card's model in the alsa-base.conf file?\n\n\n*\n\n*Re: headphone jack not recognised by ubuntu 10.10\n\n*HdaIntelSoundHowto\n", "Q: Vulnerability Scanner, nmap vs Nessus I need a good vulnerability auditing tool for Ubuntu so I decided to try nmap I also recalled that there was a product that can do this kind of work called Nessus it is no longer available in the repository and the packages for Ubuntu  at its site http://nessus.org/nessus/ are old, I suppose that the latest one may work on maverick though, does anyone have any experience using nessus? How does it compare to nmap?\n\nA: Nmap is faster, Nessus is more complete. The repositories of BackTrack have the lastest nessus and Nmap.\n\nA: nmap is not a vulnerability scanner, it's  network services scanner, it only detects available network services, it does not scan them for vulnerabilities.\nNikto (from package nikto) is a good web server vulnerabilities scanner.\n\nA: As far as I'm aware, Nessus is no longer free. You should take a look at OpenVAS, which is a Nessus alternative (and has even better coverage), instead. \nOpenVAS (Nessus alternative) and Nmap are very much different. You can use OpenVas to find vulnerabilities without knowing how to look for them as OpenVAS tries out numerous attacks collected from various sources, whereas you do need to know what you are doing, where to look for, with Nmap.\n\nA: You can still get Nessus for Linux. You need to download it direct from http://nessus.org/nessus/\nPlease note that there are differences between the pay for version and the free version. See here -> http://nessus.org/documentation/index.php?doc=faq#anchor66\nThanks\nChris\n\nA: Nessus is available in a Free version (non-commercial use only).\nOpenVAS the fork of Nessus is Open Source and continues to be developed (http://www.openvas.org).\nNexPose is a vulnerability scanner from Rapid7, community version can scan up to 32 IP's for Free.\nNmap with NSE can perform vulnerability checks (as mentioned above).\nA comparison was done recently between the different scanners - http://hackertarget.com/nessus-openvas-nexpose-vs-metasploitable/\n", "Q: How do I restore two finger middle click again? it used to be that tapping two fingers on the touchpad send a middle mouse click.

But when i minimize it, it automatically crashes.\n\nA: I have 9.10 Karmic and 10.10 Maverick systems at hand and if I start onboard from the terminal I got the same warning on both of them as well: \"WARNING:Config:Can't load Default loading default layout instead\" on both systems. Here is the screenshot from the Maverick fresh installation:\n\nWhat does that warning mean? I'm not sure but I feel that its something related with the keyboard layout. I use \"Turkish Q\" layout. That warning might try to say that \"there's a Default layout for onboard but, for now, not that Default but your default layout will be started\". If this is the case, obviously, it makes sense. However, I have no clue what the \"main Default\" is or what to do in order not to get that warning, but -at least for me- that warning has no ill effect and I didn't even know about such a warning before I read your question. (I don't start onboard from terminal so I haven't seen it.) In my opinion that is not the important part of your problem or maybe its not an issue at all.\nYour second and main problem: You say that onboard crashes when you minimize it. On my Maverick system, when I minimize onboard (version 0.94.0), its icon still lies on the bottom panel as usual for most of the programs. Like this (circled in red):\n\nBut on my Karmic system (onboard version 0.92.0) it behaves in a different way: When I minimize onboard , its icon sits the top panel, right side. Like this (circled in red):\n\nOn Karmic, with onboard version 0.92.0, if this is not set to be on top panel, it crashes when onboard is minimized. Most probably, this is a bug. So, on Karmic, I set it to be on top panel. On Maverick, with onboard version 0.94.0, both ways work, as it should be, so its up to taste to choose one or the other behaviour, i.e. minimizing to top or bottom. It may be possible to uninstall 0.92.0 and install 0.94.0 on Karmic but I didn't try it and I don't know if there are dependency problems or not.\nSo, from where can we set this behaviour? Let's go to the Settings section of onboard. How? Start onboard (version 0.92.0 in this example) and click on the area circled in red:\n\nNow click on the Settings :\n\nTick the option \"Show icon in system tray to hide/show onboard\":\n\nSettings interface for onboard 0.94.0 is a little bit different, but the same choise exists as shown belown (remember that on Maverick with v. 0.92.0 that choice was a must as a workaround to prevent crash; here it is optional as an option should be):\n\nIn short, in your situation (Karmic + most probably onboard v. 0.92.0) I advice to tick that box. Then, you don't have to start it from the terminal; you may start it via Alt+F2 or via Applications menu (if you have added onboard to the menu.)\n", "Q: Is it possible to minimise applications using the Unity bar?

Eg., when a terminal is focused and you have four terminals opened, then clicking on the launcher would give you this:\n\nThis also happens with only one instance open - seems odd, but changing the click behavior for one use case would introduce (unwanted) inconsistency.

The only way of booting the computer now, is using the Live CD and choosing boot from the hard disk. Besides, if I put this HD in a 32bits computer, grub boots normally. How can I enable boot directly from the HD using the 64bits desktop?\n\nA: Sounds like you need to reinstall grub (or at least have it embedded on the MBR). Grub does usually work fine in a 64bit environment (at least it works here).\nThere are a lot of guides out there for doing this but most concern Grub v1. Ubuntu has been on Grub v2 (confusingly the actual version number is 1.9x) for a while and the repair instructions are slightly different.\nIf I were you, I'd follow this guide and see where you get.\n\nA: Just saw the line:\n\nI put this HD in a 32bits computer, grub boots normally\n\nThat (paired with it booting from the CD) suggests that your BIOS is looking at the wrong drive to boot.

I'm using 'tar' to clone or to have high availability of this server. I followed the tutorial from the link [link text][1]. I tried this installing a new server of same version. When I extracted the tar (tar -xvpzf ~/clone.tgz -C /) on the destination (new), at the end it's ending with the following output similar to the below (don't know if it's error).\ntar: var/run: time stamp 2010-11-09 17:09:11 is 7335.159880406 s in the future\ntar: var/spool/postfix/usr/lib/zoneinfo: time stamp 2010-11-09 17:08:26 is 7290.159730037 s in the future\ntar: var/lib: time stamp 2010-11-09 17:27:51 is 8455.159349527 s in the future\ntar: usr/bin: time stamp 2010-11-09 17:28:02 is 8466.159254097 s in the future\ntar: usr/share/sgml: time stamp 2010-11-09 17:27:47 is 8451.158909506 s in the future\ntar: usr/share/man/man7: time stamp 2010-11-09 17:27:50 is 8454.158393583 s in the future\ntar: usr/share/man/man1: time stamp 2010-11-09 17:28:02 is 8466.158166556 s in the future\ntar: usr/share/man/man8: time stamp 2010-11-09 17:27:51 is 8455.158057701 s in the  future\ntar: usr/share/omf/time-admin: time stamp 2010-11-09 17:27:52 is 8456.157830449 s in the future\n---------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------\n\nI'm using following command to create a tar file of the specified directories on the source system.\ntar -cvzf ~/clone.tgz --exclude ~/clone.tgz --exclude /etc/hosts --exclude /etc/hostname --exclude /etc/udev/ --exclude /etc/network/interfaces --exclude /etc/resolv.conf  /etc /home /opt /tmp /usr /var /mnt\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any precautions before using tar? (the tar is one time creation from then I'll be using rsync)\n\n*Should I've to include any more directory like bin or lib? -  suggest me\n\n*Should I've to exclude any directory? Like I had a network device (eth0) problem (failed to start up eth0). So in the above command I've excluded \"/etc/udev/\" and after this I felt this was fine. Like this, is there any thing I've to exclude from /etc/ or from any directory that I've included? -  suggest me.\n\n*How could I schedule rsync (incremental bkp) with ssh combination to sync the directories (specified in tar) to the remote location (say /mnt/newdir) which I could tar and extract it later in case of system failure. Rsync can be scheduled to run as root user but the ssh will prompt for the password. FYI, sudo is completely disabled and as well as direct ssh login to root is also disabled.\n\n\nIf there is any better way without any harm to server to achieve this, can suggest.\n[1]: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php? t=525660\n\nA: I would recommend you to use rsync instead, it will allow you to do a live system to system real synchronization without the need of temporary files. It also provides the benefit of doing incremental updates when you need to update the clone.\nI would exclude only: /proc/ /sys /dev /tmp /mnt\nOn the clone system you will need to make sure /etc/fstab and /boot/grub/grub.cfg are updated with the UUIDs of the clone systems partitions.\nIf you have a database like mysql you will need to be carefull and stop the DB before performing the copy.\n\nA: First off, many of the IaaS cloud providers offer powerful snapshot capabilities that solve this quite easily.\nOn EC2, if you run an EBS based system, you can just periodically snapshot it. If something awful happens to the source instance, you can roll back to the previous snapshot on a brand new instance. If you want to archive a snapshot you can boot another instance with it attached, and use something like tar+s3 without negatively impacting the production box.\nThere are a number of problems with this approach which may not be apparent right now.\n\n\n*\n\n*You are locking yourself into a single technology. If you get this working on Ubuntu 10.10, and you want to go to 11.04, you have to upgrade the source system, then snapshot it again. Likewise, if you use EC2's EBS snapshots, you need a new solution if you go to rackspace cloud.\n\n*You have no change history if you use rsync. If you modify something on system 1, then something breaks, you'll likely break your backup system too when you rsync.\n\n*Rsync can be extremely high-impact on your production system.\n\n\nWhat you really want is a config management system, and data high availability.\nI'd recommend you choose a config management system, like puppet (in main!), chef, or cfengine. Start doing all of your configuration in the config management system, and then you can just boot a generic system, and apply the config management to it. Add in 'etckeeper' and you have history.\nFor data high availability, rsync should work, and be much more straight forward as you can just copy the data you want to. There's also drbd to have what amounts to a \"network RAID1\". These are not replacements for data backups, which should include historical snapshots (whether through block device snapshots or something like tar) rather than syncing to a recovery host (what if somebody deletes all the data which gets rsynced to the recovery box, deleting it all there too?)\n\nA: The messages are likely caused because the new server clock is behind in time than the older one.\nIf you are cloning the package manager configuration and database (and you are), you should clone /bin, /sbin and /lib or the destination system will be in an inconsistent status. Another approach will be to exclude /etc/dpkg.info /etc/apt /var/lib/apt and /var/lib/dpkg and reinstall all the packages in the target system.\nThe files in /var/dpkg and /var/apt contain info about what is installed in your system. If you don't exclude them, the package manager will believe that all the programs and dependencies in the parent system are installed in the target. But if you didn't copy /bin, /sbin, etc... they will not. It's very likely that something will break on the next install or update.\nTo keep then synced with rsync I have always used certificated based authentication, not passwords. It's quite easy to setup, I remember that I did it just reading the man page the first time. Here is a quick guide, if you want more information I believe that this deserves a new question.\n", "Q: File and directory comparison tool? I'm looking for something that will compare directories and files like Beyond Compare does for windows.\nIts mainly for use of source control, but I need to use it for deployment as well.\n\nA: KDiff3 \nIt is a graphical front-end to diff for KDE users (or if you don't mind using Qt apps).\n\nThere is also dirdiff  for directories.\n\nA: Krusader\nKrusader is a free tool (available in the Software Centre) that shows folder contents in comparison and you can synchronize with a lot of different options. You can filter while synchronising and comparing.\n\nTo compare file contents you simply mark two files select \"file\" > \"compare content\" and they are compared on a letter by letter basis. the default comparing tool used by krusader is the default KDE tool \"Kompare\". You can set krusader to use any other comparison tool - like for example one of the above.\nThis is the most complete solution I ever found and it's very convenient.\nAnd it supports all the function keybindungs used by midnight commander (norton commander syntax).\n\nA: Maybe Meld is what you are looking for.\nOr here are some other alternatives.\n\nA: I learned about hashdeep two weeks ago. And it has some strong advantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*In contrast to meld, it works well for very large folders. Where meld becomes extremely slow and the UI unresponsive (blocked), hashdeep just works at a constant speed\n\n*In contrast to rsync, hashdeep detects moved files - files with the same content, just in a different directory.\n\n\nVerbose output is like:\n...\nfoo/bar.txt: Known file not used\nx/foo/M0824_2L.JPG: Moved from y/P1010998.JPG\n\nhashdeep: Audit failed\n   Input files examined: 0\n  Known files expecting: 0\n          Files matched: 6233\nFiles partially matched: 0\n            Files moved: 3695\n        New files found: 19257\n  Known files not found: 4713\n\n\nA: A good way to do this comparison is to use \"find\" with \"md5sum\", then a \"diff\".\nExample:\nUse find to list all the files in the directory then calculate the md5 hash for each file and pipe it to a file:\n$find /dir1/ -type f -exec md5sum {} \\; > dir1.txt\n\nDo the same procedure to the another directory:\n$find /dir2/ -type f -exec md5sum {} \\; > dir2.txt\n\nThen compare the result two files with \"diff\":\n$diff dir1.txt dir2.txt\n\nThis strategy is very useful when the two directories to be compared are not in the same machine and you need to make sure that the files are equal in both directories.\nAnother good way to do the job is using git\ngit diff --no-index dir1/ dir2/\n\nBest regards!\n\nA: Diff is your friend.\ndiff -ur path1 path2\n\nThis will compare all files that are common between path1 and path2.\nIf you change -ur to -urN then that will also show the contents of files that are only present in one of the paths.\n\nA: Unison is a fast file synchronization tool that uses the rsync algorithm and lets you preview differences before updating between 2 locations, be they remote or local.\n\nA: Try also FreeFileSync. It has a decent interface, acceptable comparing speed, good filtering of the comparison result, differents ways of syncrhronization. It comes with a folder monitoring tool (RealTimeSync) that can launch FreeFileSync (actually any command or script) when that specific folder (or folders) or the files within are changed.

But it does its work nicely.\n\nA: You can use diffuse (for files only, not for directories):\nsudo apt-get install diffuse\ndiffuse file1 file2\n\n\nA: 'Beyond Compare' is available for Linux, too. Check their download URL.\nTheir german site is at http://www.beyondcompare.de/.\n\nA: You can try meld. \nIt's the repositories and provides a GUI for file or folder comparison.\n\nA: Meld\nMeld is a tool that can compare and merge files and directories. It is a GUI analog to the standard diff  and patch  command line tools. (See man diff and man patch for more details on those)\n\nAlso, lots of source control systems (such as bzr  or git ) have the ability to create diffs between versions.\n\nA: Use the diff command:\ndiff -u file1 file2\n\ndiff -u selects a format with a few lines of context. A plain diff file1 file2 only lists the differing lines. There are many more options to control the output format, ignore whitespace-only differences, etc.\nIf you want to write the output to a file, redirect it:\ndiff -u file1 file2 >file1-file2.diff\n\n\nA: Gnome Commander\nThe interface might not be real sexy, but it's extremely powerful!\n\nAnd if you were used to other *Commander (like Norton, or the likes), you won't be lost.\n\nA: Command line tools\nInspired by this blog entry.\ndiff\nListing different files:\ndiff -qr folder1 folder2\n\nListing also content:\ndiff -Naur folder1 folder2\n\nrsync\nIf the two directories are not on the same machine, rsync might be the easiest solution. Usually rsync is used in order to sync directories, but you can run it in verbose and dry mode, so it will only list files it would have to change.\nrsync -rvnc --delete folder1 server:/path/to/folder2\n\nYou can ommit c if you want to compare files based on timestamps and file sizes to speed up everything:\nrsync -rvn --delete folder1 server:/path/to/folder2\n\n\nA: Eclipse IDE is a bit heavyweight if you're just doing comparisons, but it does do a good job of that, amongst other things.  You can select 2 projects, paths or files and compare them with each other, and also synchronize with source control servers.\n\nA: IMHO FreeFileSync is very good and more useful than Meld. It's fast and stable, can do costomizable synchronizations and can also export the result of the comparison into a csv file.\nLanchpad link\n\nA: Cross-platform, easy, no fuss & profile saving features make Jfilesync my top choice\n\nA: To compare files\nFile_1.txt\nLine1\nLine2\n\nFile_2.txt\nLine1\nLine 2\n\nYou can use the command cmp:\ncmp -b \"File_1.txt\" \"File_2.txt\"\n\noutput would be \na b differ: byte 11, line 2 is  62 2  40  \n\nTo compare dirs (your need):\nyou can use the diff command:\ndiff -r --brief dir1 dir2\n\nman diff\n  -r, --recursive\n              recursively compare any subdirectories found\n\n   -q, --brief\n          report only when files differ\n\n", "Q: Blank screen when booting after editing the Startup settings I used Startup Manager to edit Startup settings and when I restarted, I got a black screen and couldn't log on.

My Mac mini doesn't boot without a monitor connected to it. As I've read in various forums on the internet, Mac OS X lets the Mac Mini boot without an attached monitor if SSH is turned on. Obviously, there's a setting in the EFI somewhere.\nIs it possible to apply this setting in Linux as well?\n\nA: It's possible to buy dummy adapters, which tell the computer that there's a monitor connected.\nThey are quite easy to make oneself. Just use a DVI-I --> VGA adapter and connect the 2nd to the 7th pin using a 75 Ω resistor.\n\nA: The bug is in Bootcamp. If you install grub-efi and enable it as the primary bootloader, you ran run Linux without any monitor attached.\n\nA: I would guess that by using the nvram command under OS X, you can poke in a value that tells it to start without a monitor.

I am comfortable with the gnome terminal, but wouldn't mind having a tool that makes it easy to \"bookmark\" hosts, and even drag and drop scp copying would be helpful.  I use Putty at the moment in windows, (and WinSCP for copying files) but was wondering if there was a better, or more integrated cross platform tool. (work machines have windows 7)\n\nA: PuTTY really is the de facto cross-platform telnet/SSH application. I am having trouble identifying exactly what you're looking for, but of the following criteria:\n\n\n*\n\n*Free\n\n*Supports Windows and Linux\n\n*GUI (bookmarking and drag and drop)\n\n\nPuTTY, as far as I am aware, is the only piece of software that satisfies all constraints. WinSCP is Windows-only and all other clients with which I am familiar are either commercially licensed or text-based. FileZilla may support SSH, I have not tested this personally but potentially it could be a more robust file manager than PuTTY or WinSCP.\nAlso, for what it's worth, GNOME/Nautilus supports browsing of SSH shares from \"Places > Connect to Server...\" It supports bookmarks and (obviously) drag and drop.\nSources: This page and my own experience with various SSH clients.\n\nA: i use gftp as my ftp client.

Is there a way to get the colors of a gnome custom theme to KDE without matching every single setting manually? (Theres tons of different color settings in the KDE color schemes, most of which I even don't know where they are applied ... \nI use KDE with compiz to run emerald as windows decorator. \nBecause I really like the \"Elementary\"-theme. \nBecause my eyes aren't that great I had to tweak the gtk-elementary theme for some additional contrast. I saved it as \"elementary-piedro\". \nNow I want to choose this theme in KDE-Systemsettings/appearance/gtk-applications but it doesnt't show the tweaked version? Where is it saved by the normal \"gnome appearance preferences\"-utility? \nIs there a way to use the tweaked settings for KDE-applications?\n\nA: firstly, you need to use gtk+ as your style in KDE, secondly, you would need to edit the gtkrc for your gnome theme as opposed to the theme (in appearance properties). This is the only way that KDE applications can use your GNOME theme (when running KDE).\nThe gtkrc file is a configuration document, like css is to html, or like preferences are to an application. The gtkrc for a particular theme is usually found in either /usr/share/themes/themenamegoeshere/gtkrc or a similar to location, or /home/username/.themes/themenamegoeshere/gtkrc.\nFor elementary just locate the themes folder and find it's gtkrc. Open this with gedit (double click).

If it is localhost or similar then the MySQL server is denying access because you are connecting from an external machine. Change the host field to % to allow connections from any IP (though obviously never use this in a production environment where the guest is accepting connections from the Internet)\n\n*Is your MySQL server set up to allow remote connections? Open /etc/mysql/my.cnf and verify that your bind-address is set to the private IP of the guest machine. Also, make sure your port setting matches whatever you are trying to connect on.\nBeyond that, you'll need to post logs or connection information so that we can take a closer look at the actual problem.\n\nA: Instead of using the port forwarding for each application you can use the 'Bridged networking' for your guest os. So that you can assign an ip with same subnet mask as your host system. For example if your host sytem's ip is 192.168.0.10 ,after enabling the bridged networking you can assign a similar ip to the guest also, say 192.168.1.11. Thus you can access all services running on guest as normal. Read the below link for more info about setting up bridged network.

This should tell you at least what version was installed originally.\n\nA: \"Almost\" the same question has been asked here: \nKnow Ubuntu Distribution server or desktop\nI would like to post my answer here as well because it has a few new hints how to check if your on a desktop or server edition.\nAs mentioned in previous posts, it's not easy to determine if you use a desktop or server edition because all package can be installed or removed.\nIf you are in a consistent and predictable environment it shouldn't be very difficult to determine if desktop or server.\nI use only ubuntu-desktop (vanilla) or ubuntu server. For me the dpkg -l ubuntu-desktop it's a very reliable method to determine if its a desktop or server.\nAs mentioned in the linked post, it's not easy to determine if you use a desktop or server edition because all packages can be installed or removed. \nHere is my function I use for my scripts.\nBasically it checks if xserver-common or xwayland are installed. If one of them is installed it means its an desktop system.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\ncheck_if_desktop (){\n  IS_DESKTOP=\"false\"\n\n  displayManager=(\n    'xserver-common' # X Window System (X.Org) infrastructure\n    'xwayland' # Xwayland X server\n  )\n  for i in \"${displayManager[@]}\"; do\n    dpkg-query --show --showformat='${Status}\\n' $i 2> /dev/null | grep \"install ok installed\" &> /dev/null\n    if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then\n      IS_DESKTOP=\"true\"\n    fi\n  done\n}\n\nHere are a few other things to check:\nBy default the server edition uses the classic /etc/network/interfaces, while the desktop edition operates with Network Manager, so check if Network Manager is installed\ndpkg -l network-manager\n\nOr run the command nmcli (the command line tool for NM)\nif you get a message like this:\nThe program 'nmcli' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:\nsudo apt-get install network-manager\n\nthe probability is high that you are on a server edition.\nBut keep in mind, you can modify a server to operate with NM.\n\nUse the following command to determine if desktop components are installed\ndpkg -l ubuntu-desktop\n\nOn a Server you will get a message like this: \ndpkg-query: no packages found matching ubuntu-desktop\n\nOn a Desktop you will get a message that tells you which version is installed\n\nCheck for other packages that are typically found on a desktop:\ndpkg -l unity (gnome, mate and so one) # Desktop environments\ndpkg -l compiz (E17, fluxbox and so one) # Window manager\ndpkg -l xorg # X window server\n\nor use:\n dpkg-query --show --showformat='${Status}\\n' *packagename* 2> /dev/null | grep \"install ok installed\"\n\ncheck if the X server is running:\nps -e | grep X\nsudo netstat -lp | grep -i Xorg\n\n\nCheck for services that are only available on a desktop:\nIt depends on your Ubuntu version how to check the services:\nsudo service *servicename* status # on SysVinit \nsudo status *servicename* # on Upstart\nsystemctl status *servicename*.service # on systemd\n\ntypical services are:\n\n\n*\n\n*lightdm\n\n*x11-common\n\n*gnome-shell\n\n\nand some others that are associated with certain derivatives\n\n\nMy application depends on server distribution\n\nEven if it doesn't make any sense to run a server application on a desktop edition, there shouldn't be any issues with installing all the dependencies for your application on the desktop edition and make it working.\nCan you elaborate on this why it depends on the server distro?\n\nA: There is no clearly defined, simply worded answer for this question.\nIt is possible to load the desktop features to server, and to remove them from desktop. The root issue is what packages are part of server functionality, and will get the additional period of support and updates.\nThe best answer (IMHO) can be found in a Launchpad question (from 2008):\nwhat's the difference between server and desktop edition?\nhttps://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/40114\n\nA: This answer isn't as cut and dry as some people are making out. You can do a ubuntu-standard package install and use that as a server. You can use ubuntu-minimal as a server. You can take ubuntu-desktop and break it so it doesn't use X... Or even leave X there for administration (eww). You can change the kernel packages from -server to -generic to -rt etc. You can change the motd or even just upgrade from a version where the motd isn't as long as the new one (none of my servers have ever come out with all that guff -- probably because they're upgraded from older LTSes).\nI guess the questions that all of us should be asking are: Why does it matter? What are you trying to learn? What difference does it make to you?\nIf you're trying to run something graphical, check for what you actually need (X, x11vnc, etc). If you're trying to check that there isn't a graphical interface, do the same!\n\nA: You must remember that there is no fundamental difference between the Desktop and Server editions. \nIt is highly likely however that your hosting provider has not got all the graphical pieces, such as GNOME on the top of the stack, because there is no need of them. The installed packages is what makes it a server.\nYou might be interested in ubuntu-maintenance-check script (link) that tells you the maintenance cycle of each package installed - those that have a longer period are server packages.\n\nA: Check existing dirs in home dir. In Desktop edition you can see folders like Music, Downloads, Desktop.\n\nA: it can be checked by typing cat /etc/motd.

The dust hasn't truly settled yet as far as I am aware.\n\ntruecrypt is more operating system angostic than some other solutions.  if you need portability across os that is a good idea.  as to filesystems, this too comes down to portability.  are you using it on only linux boxes? then ext4 with luks and full volume encryption is the recommendation...portability to an unmodified windows box? then ntfs with truecrypt\n\nA: I suggest you use the Alternate Installer, which is able to encrypt the whole disk except the /boot partition.\n\nA: I recently setup a LUKS encrypted partition in my external hard drive. It works great. I use Kubuntu 10.04. Here are the steps I followed. \n\nA: A very easy way of encrypting a folder is to use Cryptkeeper.  It can be installed using the Synaptic Package Manager.  You can then assign a password/phrase to any folder of choice.  Running Cryptkeeper produces a set-of-keys icon in the control panel.  Clicking on the icon lets you select the encrypted folder and provide the password in order to be able to access the files it contains.  Details can be found at:\nhttp://tuxtweaks.com/2009/03/create-an-encrypted-folder-in-ubuntu-with-cryptkeeper/\n\nA: I believe the file system you use shouldn't have too much impact either way on the security of your encrypted volume. Other factors, like the encryption/hash algorithm, will have a much more direct influence.\nPicking the file system underneath has more to do with how you want to use the volume once it's encrypted; if you're using it on only Ubuntu and other Linux machines, ext3 and other Linux file systems would be a great choice.\nIf you have to access your volume on multiple platforms, something like NTFS or FAT32 would probably work best.\n\nA: cryptmount is a better option. It will let you encrypt the whole partition or you can create an encrypted filesystem on a file. You can find more details at http://binwaheed.blogspot.com/search?q=cryptmount which I wrote two years ago\n\nA: It's probably best to use a built-in solution like eCryptFS or LUKS.  For an explanation about using eCryptFS, see the sites Jorge points to.\nLUKS encryption is easy to set up with the GNOME Disk Utility; just tick the encryption checkbox at the bottom of the \"format partition\" dialog:\n\nThe difference between both is that eCryptFS encrypts files (including the filenames), while LUKS encrypts a complete partition under the filesystem level.\nUbuntu can then remember your password when mounting if you want, allowing you to just plug and play on your device after logging in.\n\nA: You don't really go into details of what your use case is so I'll just highlight the built in encryption features:\nUbuntu has built in support for an encrypted Private directory that might meet your needs, or you can set up encrypted home directories. \n", "Q: Adjusting display geometry in a virtual machine?

No need to do anything with xorg.conf. XServer 1.10 (included in   11.04) and thus Unity 3D runs only in Virtual Box >=4.0.6.\n1. Use Mouse to adjust screen size\nAdjusting the screen by resizing the Virtual Box Windows with the mouse allows for any screen resolution up to the host screen resolution.\n2. Use predefined standard screen sizes\nIf you need a fixed (standard) resolution you may also choose System Settings -> Monitors (for 11.04) or Displays (for 12.04) for a selection of fixed resolutions (here shown for 12.04):\n\n\n*\n\n*For maximum host screen resolution you will need to run Virtual Box in Fullscreen mode (Host + F)\n\n*For a fixed host screen resolution we need to disable Auto-resize Guest Display (HOST+G) from Virtual Box Manager View menu.\n\n3. Define new geometry with xrandr\nIf you need a fixed geometry that is not in the list of resolutions for monitors you will have to use xrandr to define a new resolution:\nFirst we use gtf for calculating the modeline of possible resolutions:\ngtf <xres> <yres> <refresh> [-x]\n\nGive the desired values for x-resolution, y-resolution and refresh rate. The flag -x is default and can be omitted. For a portrait resolution 480x640 at 60 Hz you will get the following output:\n$ gtf 480 640 60 -x\n$ 480x640 @ 60.00 Hz (GTF) hsync: 39.78 kHz; pclk: 24.82 MHz Modeline \"480x640_60.00\" 24.82 480 504 552 624 640 641 644 663 -HSync +Vsync\n\nFrom this we can copy & paste the modeline to add it to xrandr list of known resolutions:\nxrandr --newmode \"480x640_60.00\" 24.82 480 504 552 624 640 641 644 663 -HSync +Vsync\n\nand add this for the Virtual Box Monitor:\nxrandr --addmode VBOX0 480x640_60.00\n\nReplace VBOX0 with the appropriate monitor if you have setup Virtual Box with multiple monitors (or any other output name the driver reports).\nWe can now switch to the newly defined geometry as described above (2.).\n\nA: Possible one could try the commands and xorg.conf snippets that are listed here:\nhttp://wiki.debian.org/XStrikeForce/HowToRandR12\nI haven't tried that yet and don't know if there is enough information to get it working.\n\nA: Just to summarize a working answer succinctly. Tested in 18.04 with lubuntu-desktop:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install guest additions on the VM: sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms\n\n*Restart the VM: sudo shutdown -r now\n\n*After logging into the VM, resize the VirtualBox window to the desired size. (The VM screen inside the window does not resize automatically yet.)\n\n*On the VM, go to Preferences -> Monitor Settings -> select Auto -> Apply -> OK\n\n\n(You could skip step 1 if guest additions are already installed. Check if sudo lsmod | grep vbox returns anything first.)\n\nA: I am running ubuntu 10.10 on Virtualbox i had the same problem . couldn't adjust the resolution and also the full screen mode was not working. After a bit googling i found this article \nhttp://tutorial.downloadatoz.com/how-to-fix-ubuntu-10-10-virtualbox-guest-additions-problems.html\nThis really worked for me.\n\nA: I had this problem with Windows8 (Host Ubuntu). It wouldn't scale to the external monitor's size.\nIn the Virtualbox, File, Preferences [CTRL]+[G], Display, choose Maximum Guest Screen Size - Automatic.\nSolved.\n\n", "Q: Where is Kile's dictionary? I've accidentally added 'itterative' to Kile's dictionary (right click on the wrong button). Now I'd like to remove 'itterative' from the list of correct words but I can't locate the dictionary anymore (the old link in settings->configure kile ) does not link to where it used to...\nThanks in advance,\nPS: I use Kile as out of the box...no special settings no-nothing\nEDIT\nTo adress Oli's answer below. Kcontrol is not in the 10.10 reps (apparently) downloading the .tar.gz version of kcontrol and install it, by typping:\ncd ~/Documents/khepera\nSUBDIRS=\"libtns_util libxfgc libkhepera kcontrol\"\n\nfor i in $SUBDIRS ; do make -C $i install; done\nfor i in $SUBDIRS; do make -C $i clean; done\nfor i in $SUBDIRS; do make -C $i tgz; done\n\ncreates load-full of errors. I guess they could be solved, but it seems of an overkill just to locate Kile's dictionary. Any other ideas?\n\nA: Maybe worth to try the file ~/.config/enchant/en_GB.dic. I believe that this would be the standard place for Kile to put your personal additions to the dictionary (of course replace en_GB with your relevant language/country code). It's a simple text-file, so just delete the line that contains the wrong word.\n\nA: kile stores its local dictionary in /home/roger/.config/enchant/.dic for me - as Oli says it depends on what spell checker is in use.\nIf you're still stuck after that, you could try searching for files in your home directory with 'dict' in the name or ending in .dic\nOne way to do this would be with the find command at a terminal, e.g.\nfind . -iname '*.dic'\nThis will search the current directory (.) and all its subdirectories for a file ending in .dic (or .Dic : -iname is case insensitive)\n\nA: Depends on which spellchecker you use with  Kile. AFAIK, it's very modular in this respect.\nTo edit it (or see what it's set to) you need kcontrol. Install it if you don't have it. Run it and then navigate to KDE Components -> Spell Checker and see what the setting is.\nI think the default is ASpell (might have changed) and you can edit its dictionary by running:\nnano `aspell config personal-path`\n\n", "Q: How can I proxy game traffic (UDP and TCP) through a remote Ubuntu server?

I just browsed a site a while ago that was flagged as an \"attack site\" or has malware, but Firefox didn't warn before I went into it. Only when I opened a new tab with another page from the site did it block the page. \nHow do I check for vulnerabilities on my system since I think there are no anti-malware available for Ubuntu? If there are, please do tell.\nThanks!\n\nA: If the vulnerability to exploit is in the browser (or plugin it uses) then yes. They're just as exploitable as their counterparts on Windows and OSX. There are of course plenty of single-platform examples too but many Flash (for example) exploits are cross-platform.\nThankfully most exploits are just droppers (to install something else on the computer) and most of those aren't compatible with Linux. But you shouldn't get complacent and get cocky. Web security applies to everybody. Just because people aren't targeting you today, doesn't mean they never will.\nThere are antivirus products for Linux (AVG, ClamAV) that go some way to detect bad things but the market hasn't caught up with Desktop Linux users yet IMO.\n\nA: I've been using Linux exclusively for ten years. I have had a broadband connection all that time and use the internet constantly. I do not run any anti-virus or anti-malware protection and have had no issues. That is not to say that it can't happen, but the likelihood is so slight and the difficulty in using Linux anti-virus software is such a pain that it is not worth the effort, IMO.\nIf the threat was credible there would be applications available. Linux users tend to be very security conscious. The same could be said for other Windows practices, such hard drive defragmentation. Yes, you can do it in Linux, but there is no benefit or it is so low that it is not worth the hassle.\nThis is just an opinion and they vary, but that is what ten years of experience has taught me.\n\nA: It is not so much viruses but rootkits that are dangerous to Linux. Just be careful with root access, sudo and su commands.\n", "Q: Looking for a pci wireless card for a ubuntu-based access point. Any recommendations? I have recently been trying to setup a wireless access point on a small ubuntu server, but the wifi card doesn't seem to be compatible.  Its a Dlink DWA-552, which I was hoping would work, but the chipset doesn't seem to support what I'm trying to do.\nIs there another wireless card that's currently available that would work?  This particular server only has a single PCI slot available, so that may be a limitation.  I'd also prefer a card that supports 802.11 N (non-draft), but the important thing is that it works.  If it works, I'd be happy with 802.11 N-draft or even 802.11 G.\nDoes anyone have any recommendations?\n\nA: Indeed there are many adapters that work, however there may always be some compatibility issues when upgrading. My recommendation would be to install an external WLAN adapter that connects to the Ethernet LAN adapter thus being OS independent.\nFor me, the Buffalo WLI-TX4-AG300N Wireless-N Nfiniti™ Dual Band Ethernet Converter just does it's job and I can highly recommend this device even though it's priced slightly higher than an external or internal WLAN N card. In your case, when you run short of PCI slots you may find it very convenient.\n\nA: When I made my wireless router I used a GIGABYTE GN-WP01GS.  I used hostapd to set it up but found that WPA did not work reliably.  Putting it in WEP mode works quite well though.  Also, do not set it to master mode in your network interfaces file and instead just use hostapd to configure it.  Finding 100% compatible wireless devices is such a crapshoot.  Good luck!\n\nA: Can't ndiswrapper be used at all to solve this problem? I'm planning on getting 802.11n based system, and I also need to address this issue. I like the accepted solution (Buffalo converter), but I wonder why this isn't as easy as using ndiswrapper to leverage the windows drivers....\n", "Q: \"Requires to install untrusted updates\" Error in Update Manager I selected security updates and other updates in update manager and I clicked 'install updates'.

I have a music folder that contains about 15 other folders, each only a single level deep. Is there any way, via keyboard or other, to open the music folder in list view and expand all of the contained folders as well? I know about using * to open a nested folder, but that only opens the immediate children of of the selected folder.\nHere's the directory structure:\nMusic\n   Billy Joel\n     Storm Front\n         Shameless\n         She's Got a Way\n     Glass Houses\n         For the Longest Time\n   Coldplay\n     Parachutes\n         Yellow\n     X&Y\n         Fix You\n\nWhat I want to be able to do is open Nautilus to the Music folder, then click or type something to expand all the folders to display their contents as above. Right now, when I go into Music, all I see is:\nMusic\n   Billy Joel\n   Coldplay\n\n\nA: There is an upstream bug about this, but unfortunately it's open since 2003 and probably won't receive a fix in the near future.\nDon't know if there's a Nautilus script that allows you to expand/collapse all folders.\nWhat does work, is to expand directories \"level-by-level\" by using the asterisk (*) multiple times (first time it expands all subdirectories, second time all subdirectories of subdirectories, etc.) - it's close to what you want, but admittedly not optimal.\n\nA: The list may be expanded by first selecting List View from the Main Toolbar, selecting the folder that you want to expand, then pressing the asterisk (*) key on the numeric keypad or on the regular typing keyboard.  (On U.S. keyboard layouts asterisk is Shift-8, for example.)\nIf you select the top directory in the list, it and all sub-directories below will be expanded by one level.\nIf you select a directory further down the list, then it and all sub-directories below will be expanded by one level, but not those above.\nEach time the asterisk key is pressed, the list will be expanded by an additional level.\nTo collapse the list in a single step, press the / or - key on the numeric keypad, or their equivalents on the typing keyboard.\nIf you view the left side pane in Tree view, the same keystrokes work there, too, except individual file names are not displayed.\n(Determined experimentally with Nautilus 2.30.1 on Ubuntu 10.04.3 LTS.)\n", "Q: How can I make Compiz and Metacity co-exist happily? I only have one or the other While experimenting with sending virtual keystrokes, things got seriously hung up!  I powered off, When the system restarted all window decoration was missing, and all fancy compiz graphics was missing.\nI ran metacity --replace. That brought back the window decoration, but still no compiz. I ran compiz --replace, that brought back compiz functionality, but this time, no window decoration.\nHow can I get Compiz and Metacity back together again?\n\nA: Compiz and Metacity are both compositing window managers. That can't coexist--you can only have one or the other.\nReally your problem is that you're missing window decorations with compiz. Can you post the output of compiz --replace? I don't know enough to help you here, but maybe someone else does. Also explain exactly what you were doing when the decorations disappeared.\n\nA: I face the problem often. Try installing the compiz fusion icon -package name 'fusion-icon'. Once installed it will show up in your system tray. Trying playing around with the settings. Indirect rendering tends to solve this problem sometimes.\n\nA: I had the same issue when I upgraded the driver for my graphics card, I recommend you install Ubuntu Tweak - it will easily enable you to configure compiz and advanced window effects without the need for a terminal.\n\nA: Compiz and Metacity are both window managers. You cannot use two different window managers at the same time. However, windows' decoration is done by a window decorator, not a window manager. You can use, e.g., either gtk-window-decorator (which can match your previous MetaCity themes), or Beryl's own emerald window decorator, which was made to work with Compiz, and has lots of nice themes.\nWhatever you choose, be sure to check the settings for Compiz's Window Decorator plugin. (Run CompizConfig Settings Manager or ccsm and enable that plugin, and choose either gtk-window-decorator or emerald for the command; perhaps adding --replace if it helps.)\n", "Q: How do I install the Glasgow Haskell Compiler?

I have a Ubuntu desktop edition instance running as a virtual machine on a server.  I would like to use it as my primary open source dev environment but the VNC tools I have used don't seem to be as rich as \"Remote Desktop Connection\" in Windows.\nThe three things that are missing for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*connecting/logging into a non-console user sessions\n\n*dynamically resizing the graphical resolution based on the size of the remote desktop window\n\n*device sharing (USB devices plugged into client shared with remote)\n\n\nIs there an appropriate client that I can run on Windows to connect to my Ubuntu dev instance that provides these capabilities?\n\nA: Yes, Teamviewer is a cross platform Remote Desktop solution, and is free (as in beer, not as in speech) for personal usage.\n\n\nA: The closest think to RDP (remote desktop) in linux is likely NX. It is not installed in Ubuntu as default.\nThere are a couple of different servers, they need to be installed in the machine that you want to share:\n\n\n*\n\n*FreeNX is in the repositories\n\n*NoMachine NX is likely the most complete version and the reference implementation. It's open core software. The main libraries are free (FreeNX is built over them), but the main product is closed source. It free (as in beer) for up to three simultaneous clients.\n\n*NeatX is a new implementation that google is backing. It's neat but lacks important features.\n\n\nThe only client that works in windows that I know is the NoMachine one. You can download it from their site, it's free but closed source.\n\nA: tsclient is an Ubuntu RDP/VNC client which has a similar look and feel to mstsc, the Microsoft Terminal Services Client, in Windows.\nIt can do both VNC and RDP, and you can set it to run fullscreen, at a specific size, or windowed (based on the size of the remote display).\nAs for remote desktop USB sharing, tsclient is capable of sharing your hard drive with the remote system, so you can do file copies, but it won't share arbitrary USB devices. For that matter, the only piece of software I was able to find that is capable of such a thing seems to be commercially licensed.\n\nA: You can try Log me in free. It works on Windows, Mac OS X, and Ubuntu, and performs well.\n\nA: One more solution is to use VirtualBox as a virtual machine system. It has a Windows-standard RDP server built-in. I am not sure if it provides the features you've mentioned, but it can be worth a try.\nAlso don't forget that you can run your graphical applications remotely with just a command in your local shell:\nssh -Y server command\nIf you've got a good bandwidth between your server and home, this can provide you with nearly a seamless experience. I even use it to run Win32 apps with wine on my virtual server and have their GUI on my laptop.\n\nA: You can use xrdp as a RDP server (thus you can directly access that machine from windows), and rdesktop as client.\n", "Q: Mount point inside encrypted partition doesn't mount This seems a very simple problem but it's driving me nuts. I'm trying to mount two ext4 partitions at boot time with /etc/fstab.(They are written differently because I read in a forum that there were some problems mounting by uuid)\nHere are the two lines:\nUUID=c7fa17c3-e1e0-489e-93ec-341928069664 /home/alice/VirtualGarden ext4 rw,suid,dev,exec,auto,user,async 0 2\n\n/dev/sda8 /home/alice/Saco  ext4 rw,suid,dev,exec,auto,user,async 0 3\n\nThe main problem is that after boot I won't have access to either partition. They appear in my desktop, but when I try to list their content they are empty. Everything works if I mount them as a normal user after boot. For example:\nmount /home/alice/Saco\n\nI don't know if this makes a difference, but the mount point (/home/alice/) is an encrypted partition. I tried to move the mount point to /Saco and it mounted perfectly after reboot.\nAnother thing is that if I use the UUID in fstab Nautilus creates two links for the same partition. I did some research and I have solved this by using  /dev/disk/by-uuid/.\nAny tips or advise are welcome.\n\nA: Your encrypted partition doesn't get mounted unless you provide the password, while the system tries to mount the other partitions before that happens.\nThe obvious advise: mount your partitions somewhere else (eg., /media/alice/... or /mnt/alice/...). You can place a symlink to those mount points, if you absolutely want them to be accessible from /home/alice/...:\nln -s /media/alice/VirtualGarden /home/alice/VirtualGarden\nln -s /media/alice/Saco /home/alice/Saco\n\n\nA: Why do you use the manual way if you are unclear,install ntfs-config to automount partitions.I have been using this in 10.04 for few months.It is good,just try it.\nInstallation:\nsudo apt-get install ntfs-config\n\nAlso see this post\n\nA: It seems that your encrypted partition is mounted after the system has tried to mount /home/alice/Saco. As there is no /home/alice at the time system try to mount /home/alice/Saco, then this partition is not mounted but is available to be mounted manually after the system has been booted up. Would you provide information about when you mount your /home/alice encrypted.\n", "Q: Edubuntu Deployment and Active Directory Authentication How I can deploy Edubuntu from one machine to many machines in the same domain and authenticate to Windows Active Directory?\n\nA: Why not use LTSP-Cluster and integrate the server with your AD.\nLTSP is already integrated into Edubuntu as an option during installation.\nhttps://www.ltsp-cluster.org\n\nA: PiNet \"Centralised user accounts and file storage system for a Raspberry Pi classroom\" might be the solution you are looking for.\n\n\nA: I think I would use Clonzilla: http://clonezilla.org/\nYou have to make an image from one of your computers than restore this image to others.\nThere is a good and useful guide on the web page.I think this is the fastes way, and you also have a clean backup image \nFor AD authentication you can use likewise open or Centrify Express both of them free for use.

I tried xbacklight, but is says it can't see a backlighted out. The install is out-of-box Ubuntu 10.10 desktop. So how do I change the brightness?\n\nA: An Italian user, Voria, is maintaining a ppa with all the patches needed to make Ubuntu fully working on Samsung laptops. Here you can find more details about this ppa and packages in it. I have successfully applied this on a Samsung R519.\nIn particular samsung-backlight and samsung-tools are most important packages to have everything working (brightness, wireless switch, external monitor, touchpad switch and so on).\n\nA: Try keep pressed the blue Fn Key while pressing the Up ( or Down ) arrow.\nIt works for me on my Samsung Notebook (R710)\n\n\nA: upgrade to 12.04 and it works and the wifi works too!\nthe only problem i had was the brightness was too low to start with. this was fixed by going into BIOS at start up and udjusting brightness with the keys whilst in BOIS. then load OS and the brightest setting is now alot brighter\nhope this helps\n", "Q: Can I use KVM on a \"real\" Windows install? I need to get a password from my Chrome install on my Windows 7 partition. The Windows version of Chrome, however, uses Windows' own crypto API to protect this data (I doubt Wine has a compatible implementation). This means I'd have to reboot, get in, get the password and get out, wasting ten minutes in the process.\nIt'd be faster if I could just virtualize what's on my Windows partition!\nsudo kvm /dev/sda\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this a good idea?\n\n*Would this work?\n\n*Would this work well?\n\n\nA: I've not used kvm, but there's a guide to converting a physical installation of Windows into a Virtualbox VM here:\nhttp://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Migrate_Windows\nThis works quite well for Windows XP once it's installed drivers, but with Windows 7 I suspect the Windows Activation process will throw a fit because of the hardware change, and you will need to reactivate. That may involve a phone call to Microsoft. I've done this a few times with XP.\nUsing the existing partition directly as the disk in a VM (you can do this with VMWare Server) could also work but with the same caveats. And then you'd go through the driver and activation cycle again if you tried to boot from the partition directly. I wouldn't recommend this.\nIt's worth nothing that Chrome is going to be adding password sync into its own sync mechanism soon, and it is in the development channel. (I haven't test this).\nhttp://lifehacker.com/5543459/password-sync-coming-soon-to-google-chrome\n\nA: Theoretically is should be possible, but windows might not like it since all the hardware have changed.\nOther things to mind: partitions that windows uses cannot be mounted, there have to be a bootloader to kickstart windows (if grub is used the partition containing your /boot should be unmounted first.), Hell may break loose and you have properly violated your windows license.\nBut if you are ventures go for it! Windows 7 have come a long way in the include drivers department.\nNote: I have not tried this with windows my self, but a few times with linux and that works quite well.\n", "Q: Is Ubuntu 10.04 compatible with Toshiba L640D Will Ubuntu 10.04/10.10 work on a Toshiba L640D?

I would like to use it as my git server, so I could store my repos there. \nSo, where can I find some detailed instructions of how to setup git on ubuntu server? All these SSH keys and stuff like that, multiple users, etc.\n\nA: I like gitolite. The Pro Git book has a section on it but I recommend reading the whole book.\nAs for your multiple users requirement:\n\nGitolite allows you to specify\n  permissions not just by repository\n  (like Gitosis does), but also by\n  branch or tag names within each\n  repository. That is, you can specify\n  that certain people (or groups of\n  people) can only push certain “refs”\n  (branches or tags) but not others.\n\n\nA: http://scie.nti.st/2007/11/14/hosting-git-repositories-the-easy-and-secure-way can be slightly modified to suit your purposes...a similar tutorial http://blog.agdunn.net/?p=277.\n\nA: Definitely follow the official documentation: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Git (section Setting up Git and Project Management)\n\nA: The solution that worked the best for me, was setting up WebDAV.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo a2enmod sudo dav_fs \n\n*sudo a2enmod dav\n\n*add new file to /etc/apache2/sites-available and name it, for example, git.yourserver.com. Edit it and add following lines:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\nDocumentRoot /var/www/git.yourserver.com/repos\nServerName git.yourserver.net\nOptions Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n\n<Location />\n    DAV On\n    AuthType Basic\n    AuthName \"git repos\"\n    AuthUserFile /var/www/git.yourserver.net/password.dav\n    Require valid-user\n</Location>\n\n</VirtualHost>\n\n\n*\n\n*create directory /var/www/git.yourserver.com and directory repos inside id\n\n*sudo chown www-data /var/www/git.yourserver.com/repos\n\n*sudo htpasswd -c /var/www/git.yourserver.com/password.dav user_login and enter password for user named user_login\n\n*sudo chown root:www-data /var/www/git.yourserver.com/password.dav\n\n*sudo chmod 640 /var/www/git.yourserver.com/password.dav\nNow, sudo a2ensite git.yourserver.com and sudo service apache2 restart.\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter /var/www/git.yourserver.com/repos and create directory, for example, myrepo.git\n\n*cd myrepo.git\n\n*git --bare init\n\n*git update-server-info\nNow, logout from your remote server and go to local directory you want to edit your files in.\ngit clone http://user_login:user_password@git.yourserver.com/myrepo.git\n\nand you've finished. If you want to send your commited changes to the server: \ngit push origin master\n\nYou can create as many users as you want using sudo htpasswd. Just remember not to use -c switch, when adding more users, because old file will be deleted.\n\nA: You can use the tutorial to install a Git server as aking1012 proposed you or you could just install SSH server on your EC2 instance (probably it would be wise to secure it and change the default port).\nGit can be server-less you init your repository and then you access it from remote via SSH. So instructions like this on the Ubuntu Server should do it:  \nGIT_DIR=project.git git init  \ncd project.git  \ngit --bare update-server-info  \ncp hooks/post-update.sample hooks/post-update\n\nFinally install SSH on your server:  \nsudo apt-get install ssh-server\n\nNow, you should configure SSH to secure it.\nIt's time to put your project online (the data you already have on your development machine):  \ngit push ssh://<username>@<remote-git-hostname>/path/to/project.git master\n\nAnd now you can start cloning around. You go on your development machine:  \ngit clone ssh://<username>@<remote-git-hostname>/path/to/dir.git\n\nCheck this excellent resource on Git.\nAnd for generating your ssh keys for safer authentication, you can read this article about SSH authentication.\n\nA: It is very easy to achieve with gitolite. In less than an hour you will have easy configurable and secure multiuser git server.\nI have an howto article on my site\n\nA: I also like the gitolite approach for managing users and security.  I have a Git + gitolite server AMI for EC2 currently being tested.  Feel free to give it a try; documentation is available here:\n\nAlestic Git Server\n\nUsing this approach, you can have a central Git server with private repositories running in a matter of minutes.  There is a learning curve for gitolite and EC2 if you aren't familiar with them.\n\nA: For all my Git server setups I use Gitolite which allows for a security granularity of \"per-branch\" access. Setup is pretty straight forward if you're doing it on a remote server it's as easy as running an interactive script.

But I think this is probably a cause worth pushing for. Submit a bug against Ubuntu and add your patches (just make sure they can work without needing to send the notification if there's no X environment). It's this sort of usability that we need.\nI've never heard of gxmessage before, but I would use notify-send.\nA full solution would need to cater for the possibility of multiple displays (eg multi-head, remote users, etc) but thankfully I wrote some code for that bit yesterday:\nfor display in `ps aux | grep -oE \"/usr/bin/X\\s[^ ]+\" | cut -d \" \" -f 2`; do\n    DISPLAY=$display notify-send -u critical 'Shutdown notice' 'Save all your work. THE SYSTEM IS GOING DOWN!!' -i /usr/share/pixmaps/gnome-computer.png\ndone\n\n(I'm using export instead of a -display or --display flag because I don't know that notify-send takes either)\n\nA: You could send a message manually using zenity\nzenity --warning --text \"badp's about to restart the computer\" --display=:0\n\nOf course, you could include this in a script.\n\nA: You should be able to write a script that crateas a ptty and listens for written messages (from write or wall) and then forwards that on to a GUI output.\n\nA: AFAIK there is no X client for the wall command to display these message in a graphical environment. You can use gxmessage app for displaying popups but then you will have to write the script yourself.\n", "Q: JVM is crashing randomly when trying to use Eclipse Since I installed Ubuntu 10.04 on my PC, I have eclipse crashing every hour or more without apparent action.\nIn the logs, I see that the cause is related to JAVA :\n#\n# A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:\n#\n#  SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0x00007f95f32ce9c0, pid=2382, tid=140280562099984\n#\n# JRE version: 6.0_18-b18\n# Java VM: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (16.0-b13 mixed mode linux-amd64 )\n# Derivative: IcedTea6 1.8.2\n# Distribution: Ubuntu 10.04.1 LTS, package 6b18-1.8.2-4ubuntu2\n# Problematic frame:\n# V  [libjvm.so+0x5309c0]\n#\n# An error report file with more information is saved as:\n# /home/elapouya/perso/projects/django/rsame/hs_err_pid2382.log\n#\n# If you would like to submit a bug report, please include\n# instructions how to reproduce the bug and visit:\n#   https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjdk-6/\n#\n\nwww.eclipse.org knows this bug and it is RECOMMENDED to use 1.6.0.10 or more, or go jdk 1.5\nI installed the latest JVM official but still crashes.

If so, can you also connect using mysql -u root -p -h <ubuntu-server-ip> from your Red Hat server?\nYour PHP script seems fine, though for what it's worth you will typically want to make a more explicit comparison when checking your $conn variable, like:\nif ($conn === FALSE) { echo mysql_error(); } else { echo 'Connected'; }\nAlso, if $conn is set to FALSE, calling mysql_close($conn) at the bottom is a waste of server time (mysql_close(FALSE) will take up time to return FALSE silently); you only need to free a valid resource identifier, and in this case (a non-persistent connection) you don't need to explicitly free the resource anyway.\n", "Q: Why does \"metacity --replace\" hang my system, but \"metacity --replace&\" is fine? The following applies to Lucid 10.04\nIt happens on my \"real\" computer and also in a VirtualBox VM...  \n(UPDATE) I just now installed Maverick 10.10 to a VM... and almost the same thing happens!\nI do have keyboard control (initially) but the only way I can exit the terminal is to close it with the process still running (or Ctrl+C), and this causes the lockup (pressing Enter doesn't take it back to the prompt)     \n$ metacity --replace \n\nThe above command (in the terminal) causes my system to hang, every time.  \nThe command does not return to the prompt.\nThe window decoration disappears (maybe because the command hasn't completed?).\nThe keyboard becomes non-functional, (but the mouse still works)... \nHowever, the following commands work fine, every time.  \n$ (metacity --replace &)\n$ metacity --replace &    # this works too   \n\n\nIt may \"hang\" only in that I loose the keyboard, and so can't press Enter to bring it back to the prompt, (...as I have noticed is the case with some unrelated commands which don't \"fully\" return to the prompt, until I press Enter)  \nWhat's going on here?\nMy \"host\" OS is not new, but the VM is in mint condition (almost)... and they both exhibit this keyboard \"lock-up\".   \n\nA: Pressing Enter doesn't return to the terminal prompt because metacity is running in that terminal.  Any warning/error messages metacity produces will be printed there.  This is standard behavior for any GUI app.  If you don't want them to take over your terminal session, use '&'.\nAbout the rest -- disappearing window decorations etc. -- I'm baffled myself.  \n\nA: Running metacity --replace does not make it run as a daemon. If you hit Ctrl-C or otherwise stop that metacity process from running (closing terminal would do that as well), you will be left without a window manager. That is why you lose your window decorations. I am not exactly sure why the keyboard stops functioning (my guess is that once the window manager is closed new updates to the window, like typing, won't be painted to the screen), but I have tested this and if you hit Ctrl+Alt+F1 you can still drop to the framebuffer. Clearly the keyboard has not stopped working entirely, in fact if you click a menu item in gnome-terminal you can use the up and down arrows to navigate it.\nYou should run metacity in a wrapper, such as screen, when you need to start it from terminal and then close the terminal window you used. Just run screen metacity --replace and press Ctrl+A+D to detach from the screen process.\n", "Q: How to use touch-gesture-recognition-stack on multitouch-enabled touchpads? I currently have a Synaptics touchpad with only few classic multitouch features (2 finger scroll, right click). By installing the respective testing suite, I saw that it doesn't accept my touchpad as input device. I want to buy a newer notebook and would like to benefit of touch-related features (window management, swipe, pinch, rotate).\nDoes the touch-framework only work on touchscreens or also on touchpads? What requirements should I take into account when choosing a new notebook?\n\nA: From what I can find, it seems like support currently exists in the gesture-recognition framework, but there is a kernel bug that is blocking it from working with Synaptics devices. I found a bug report for it that has a status of \"Fix Committed.\" It seems to indicate that it supports devices that are not explicitly multi-touch.\nHowever, this bug report for an issue with the kernel has been triaged. There is discussion up to today, and it seems like fixes have been committed to the natty git kernel repo that may provide the support you require.\nYou could try compiling the kernel from this (presumably very unstable) natty kernel snapshot: git://kernel.ubuntu.com/cndougla/ubuntu-natty.git\nOr just watch the kernel bug report over the next few weeks and try to upgrade to that kernel version ASAP.\nAlso, for what it's worth, the kernel issue prevents the framework from working with a Synaptics touchpad, but you might be able to enable multitouch gestures using X11 by following this guide.\n\nA: If you want to enable Two finger scrolling and right click on your multitoch touchpad, then you can install a package described in this bug report \nSee comment #115 and #116.

However, I can't use it with the PC currently as I am waiting on a replacement heatsink. In the mean time, I wanted to use it with my Dell laptop. I hooked it up to the VGA port, and it seems to be working properly.\nHowever, I wanted to know if there was a way I could move all of the main display elements over to the attached monitor?

This will turn it off and move all windows to the main display. Make sure you have enabled your LCD monitor, or you will not be able to change the laptop display to \"Off.\"\n\nA: I use a laptop along with a 24\" monitor, and find it tremendously useful to utilize both screens, which are at different resolutions. I don't have any panels on the main laptop LCD, and keep the main desktop elements on the external monitor.

I want to disable a bunch of upstart jobs here. I know how to make a upstart job. And also I know how to stop manually a job. However, I can't find a sample where I turn a automatically job into a manually job. That is, I want the job to be started only when the user activate, for instance running this command (as root):\n\nservice job-name start\n\n\nA: Just for reference: Since upstart 0.6.7 (in Ubuntu since natty), there is a stanza called manual designed for just this purpose.\n\nA: As mentioned by @MvG, there is the manual stanza which declares an upstart service to be started manually only.\nAs root, put this into the .override file in /etc/init/ matching your job name:\n\necho \"manual\" > /etc/init/${JOB-NAME}.override\n\nor using sudo:\necho \"manual\" | sudo tee /etc/init/${JOB-NAME}.override\n\n\nA: Delete or comment out the start on part (using the number sign '#').

I have edited the file since it was installed. How can I revert this config file? Apt is smart enough not to overwrite edited config files, so how do I tell it that I want it to do so?\nFor argument's sake, let's say that I want to revert the file /etc/foo.conf from the package foo.\n\nA: You could download the package manually from packages.ubuntu.com, extract the file and replace your version with it.\nOr you could:\nsudo rm /etc/foo.conf # just for good measure\nsudo apt-get --purge --reinstall install foo\n\nThe second feels a lot more brutish. It might wipe other config out too if it uses more than one file. The first is more clicking and effort but it seems much safer.\nFor the second, you might be able to just delete the file and --reinstall might replace it. If so, that would be safer.\n\nA: The answer provided by Ryan Thomson was heading to the right way. Still it would not be able to do the job (The details reason is given below).\nThe correct (and easiest) way of doing so is using -o with apt to pass dpkg option and force dpkg to ask you whether you want to retain the modified config files or the original ones. The command will be like this -\nsudo apt-get --reinstall -o Dpkg::Options::=\"--force-confask\" install foo\n\nThis would ask you a question like\nConfiguration file '/etc/foo/foo.conf'\n ==> Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.\n     Version in package is the same as at last installation.\n   What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:\n    Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version\n    N or O  : keep your currently-installed version\n      D     : show the differences between the versions\n      Z     : start a shell to examine the situation\n The default action is to keep your current version.\n*** foo.conf (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ? \n\nYou have to press either Y or I to install package maintainer's original config file. You can even press D to see what the changes or start a root shell with Z option to fix yourself.\nNote: After the replacement, you'll find your modified file as at /etc/foo/foo.conf.dpkg-old\n\nWhy other options would not work?\nBecause the other options in dpkg doesn't work well. The options which deals with a package's config files are\n\n*\n\n*--force-confmiss\n\n*--force-confnew\n\n*--force-confold\n\n*--force-confdef\n--force-confmiss would not work when package version doesn't change. From man-page\n\n\nIf a conffile has been modified and the version in  the package  did  change,  always  install  the  new version without prompting, unless the  --force-confdef is  also  specified,  in which case the default action is preferred.\n\n\n--force-confmiss works with missing conffiles. It too will fail when version didn't change. Quoting man-page\n\n\nconfmiss: If  a  conffile  is  missing  and  the version in the package did change, always install the missing conffile  without prompting.  This  is  dangerous, since it means not preserving a change (removing) made to the file\n\n\n--force-confold will retain modified version only if the version is changed. For same package, it too will fail. Quoting man-page\n\n\nconfold: If a conffile has been modified and the version in the package  did  change, always  keep  the  old  version   without prompting,  unless  the  --force-confdef  is  also specified, in which case the default action is preferred.\n\n\n--force-confdef will also fail because the default action is to retain older file (Indicated from the message shown with --force-confask. It has line (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] which means retaining is default. See above). And if --force-confnew is specified but version do not change, that too will not work. Quoting man-page\n\n\nconfdef:  If a conffile has been modified and the version in the package did  change, always choose the default action without prompting. If there is no default action it will stop to ask the user  unless  --force-confnew  or  --force-confold  is also been given, in which case it  will  use  that  to  decide  the  final action.\n\n\nOnly --force-confask will work, because it will explicitly ask you the question even when the version is same. Quoting man-page\n\n\nconfask: If a conffile has been modified always offer to replace it with the version in the package, even if the version in the package did  not  change  (since  dpkg  1.15.8). If  any  of --force-confmiss, --force-confnew, --force-confold, or --force-confdef  is also given, it will be used to decide the final action.\n\n\nHope that will help.\n\nA: If the harm is already done, here's a command line way of getting back the official version of the configuration file. First, download the package file (either with apt-get --download-only as below, or from the package page on packages.ubuntu.com), then extract its contents in a temporary location. You can then copy the file into /etc. Make sure to respect the original permissions (most files in /etc are owned by root and mode 644 (i.e. word-readable and root-writable), but each exception is there for an important reason).\nsudo apt-get --download-only --reinstall install foo\nmkdir /tmp/foo\ndpkg-deb -x /var/cache/apt/archives/foo_VERSION_ARCH.deb /tmp/foo\n\nNote that this doesn't apply to the configuration files that are not from a package, such as /etc/fstab or /etc/passwd. If you lose these, you're on your own. (Most are very system-dependent anyway.)\n\nFor the future, I recommend using etckeeper . Install the package and run sudo etckeeper init. This sets up version control for all files in /etc. You don't need to do anything else to manage etckeeper; you only need to interact with it when you want to do a version control operation, such as referring to older files. Files are automatically committed before and after each run of apt and every night (this is configurable).\nBy default, on Ubuntu, etckeeper uses Bazaar. Change the setting in /etc/etckeeper/etckeeper.conf before running etckeeper init if you prefer Darcs, Git or Mercury.\nWith Bazaar, to revert /etc/foo.conf to the last committed version:\ncd /etc\nsudo bzr revert foo.conf\n\nIf you want to go back further in time, use sudo bzr log foo.conf to view the history of the file, and sudo bzr revert -r 42 foo.conf if you've determined that revno: 42 is the revision you want to revert to.\n\nA: Depending on the package, you may find a default config file in /usr/share/doc/foo/examples.\n\nA: Use Synaptic (Ubuntu tweak is even more convenient but synaptic is more straight forward) and choose \"completely remove package\". This will delete all config files  (you might want to backup these files!). \nThen reinstall. You're done.  \nWith Ubuntu Tweak you get even more options for cleanup, rerolling and configuration backups. Maybe you want to give it a look. It's in the softwarecenter. \np.s.: Synaptic also uses the \"purge\" option (like mentioned by Oli above ...) \n- just with a GUI for more comfortable handling.  \n\nA: I finally found the answer that I vaguely remembered from years ago: \ndpkg --force-confnew --force-confmiss -i PACKAGE.deb\n\nThe \"confnew\" argument forces dpkg to replace modified config files with the package-provided ones, and the \"confmiss\" does likewise with config files that have been deleted.\nAccording to this chatlog, you can also use these options through apt-get in the following manner: \napt-get -o DPkg::Options::=\"--force-confnew --force-confmiss\" --reinstall install PACKAGE\n\nwhich saves you from needing to find the deb file yourself.\nObviously, these options are dangerous and have the potential to blow away important system configuration files if misused.\n", "Q: Installing and setting up MySQL?

I installed it by running sudo apt-get install mysql-server and once that was done, when I try mysql I get the message:\nERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)\nI tried mysql start and get the same thing. I am sure I am doing something wrong, any pointers would be great.\n\nA: To start the mysql demon (or service) you should do:\nsudo start mysql\n\nthe old way should still work for now:\nsudo /etc/init.d/mysql start\n\nBut it's quite strange that mysql didn't start while installing. IIRC, it should be started at the end of the installation and autstarted by default with the system. You can check if the server is running using:\nps -A u | grep sql\n\n\nA: You can check for mysql startup errors by looking at the log files.  In a terminal, type:\ntail /var/log/mysql.log\ntail /var/log/mysql.err\n\nThat should let you see the specific errors that are keeping it from running.\n\nA: To installations of MySQL can specify where we will have the socket for local connections\nyou have to modify this file (/etc/mysql/my.cnf)\n\nsudo nano /etc/mysql/my.cnf\n\nand add the parameter socket in the section client:\n[client]\ndefault-character-set=utf8\nsocket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock\n\n", "Q: How to setup Gnome & KDE to use the same soundsystem? Using maverick ubuntu with added kubuntu-desktop:\nI look at KDE systemsettings in the multimedia section. Under phonon backend it says I use xine. No option to add or change anything here. \nNow gnome uses gstreamer and pulseaudio ... \nI'm using a lot KDE applications in gnome and a lot of gnome applications with KDE. I use wine applications also. Therefore It seems reasonable to reduce the soundsystem to one framework. (?) \nShould I use Xine or gstreamer? \nI read Kubuntu uses pulseaudio as well, but I can't find it in there,though I really like pulseaudio for the ability to manually tell the system toplay this apllication's sound on headphone, the other one on internal soundchip and so forth ... \nWhat to do to have a running pulseaudio system for all occasions and what's the best way to play the sound of the applications with either xine or gstreamer? \n\nA: If you use Kubuntu 10.10 (or Ubuntu 10.10 with kubuntu-desktop installed, as you seem to be), you are using the same backend.  I.e., you're using ALSA as your sound drivers and low userspace, and you're using PulseAudio for your backend on top of the ALSA userspace.  Xine-lib and GStreamer are both configured by default to use PulseAudio if available, so in your case, without doing anything you're using pulse already.  (Note: currently work is being done for QtGStreamer, so at some point KDE will pick up that backend natively; thus Kubuntu will gain it, too.)\n\nA: You need to install phonon-backend-gstreamer to give Phonon the option to use GStreamer.\nsudo apt-get install phonon-backend-gstreamer\n\nI'll leave it up to other people to answer your other questions, as I don't use KDE often enough to answer those...\n", "Q: How do I install jboss? I'm looking for a How-to for installing JBoss on Ubuntu 10.10.\n\nA: check what's here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JBoss \n\nA: Basically, there currently isn't any good support for installing JBoss AS in Ubuntu using the repository. All of the existing packages only contain the .jar files and there isn't a package that will really install the server and let you run it. \nYour best bet is to go to jboss.org and download the application server from there.\n\nA: I know this question is too old, but I find this excelent tutorial for installing Jbos in a ubuntu server.\nInstall JBoss 7.0.2 Application Server on Ubuntu 11.10 or Ubuntu 11.04 or Ubuntu 10.10 or Ubuntu 10.04 LTS\nand this\nInstall JBoss 7 on an Ubuntu 11.10 server\n", "Q: Change the complete KDE Desktop Look like a Theme?

But if you need to change things outside of that then you need to talk with the kde developers in order to make something more complete and cohesive. So far people on http://kde-look.org/ probably have the most advanced ideas on how to publish and deploy entire themes.\nAnything they don't know, probably doesn't exist.\n", "Q: How can I set portable icons in Nautilus? Let's assume that I have a portable storage device that I use on multiple machines (running GNOME and otherwise, but let's focus on GNOME + Nautilus). Is there any way to set an icon for a folder in such a way that the icon will be stored (hidden) within the folder and displayed automatically on multiple machines?\nI found this Brainstorm idea but thought it may be too specific in its use of folder.jpg. I'm just interested in a way to do this, regardless of what the file is named.\nTo clarify, I'm focused on the use of icons, not thumbnails.\nI'm starting to believe that there is no way to do this without regularly running a script to set icons based on, say, an icon stored within each folder.\n\nA: As you are talking about setting a folder.jpg, I assume that you want a regular image like album artwork image to be set as the folder icon.\nYou can use cover thumbnailer to set an image as the folder icon. If you want that image to be hidden, then just add period \".\" before the image name for example: .MusicFolder.jpg\nBut if you want to achieve the same on different systems then you'll have to install cover thumbnailer on your every machine.\n", "Q: Asus K52F laptop web camera shows upside-down picture in Skype How to fix upside-down picture produced by web camera in Asus K52F (1.3 Mpix, don't know the model) laptop (Intel i3 M350, Intel video, Ubuntu 10.10) ?\nUpdate: It seems ridiculous :) but the \"upside-down issue\" is continuing even in Ubuntu 11.10. I am pretty sure it's a Skype prob (2.2.0.35 beta from official Ubuntu partner repository.)\n\nA: Quoting Hans de Goede:\n\nHi,\nTry using the latest libv4l which has a (constantly updated) list of know to have an upside down webcam laptop models. Installation instructions are here:\n  http://radu.cotescu.com/2009/11/05/flipped-images-ubuntu-webcam/\nIf that does not work your laptop model is not in the list of libv4l, please do (as root):\nlsusb > lsusb.log\ndmidecode > dmi.log\n\nAnd send me <hdegoede@redhat.com>, a mail with the 2 generated files attached. Do NOT copy and paste them I need them 100% unmodified.\nI'll then add your laptop to libv4l's upside down table and get back to you with testing instructions.\nRegards,\nHans\n\n\nYou can see here, that your laptop model has been added to the the latest version of libv4l.\nNow you either need to test it (instructions in above link), or wait for Ubuntu to update that package (which, I guess, won't happen for Ubuntu 10.10).\n\nA: Check whether the procedure described here works for your case:\nhttp://swik.net/Ubuntu/Only+Ubuntu/How+to+fix+upside+down+webcam+image+in+ubuntu/cnw5h\n\nA: My laptop is the same as yours. I followed htorque's solution, the only difference is that when you call skype the command LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libv4l/v4l1compat.so skype doesn't work because the folders are different.\nUsing the following instead I can see the webcam in the right mode:\nLD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib32/libv4l/v4l1compat.so skype\n\n\nA: after reading this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=838210 you should fix problem.\nrecent posts are related to Ubuntu 10.4 LTS but it should work also in 10.10 :)\n\nA: Install an app called v4l2ucp and use the tilt option to rotate the output of your webcam.

My laptop PC is a HP G5055EA and I tried some scripts and applications to disable its touchpad, but no one works permanently: some of this software disables touchpad only for a few minutes and others does nothing at all!\n\nA: Your laptop should have a key combination to disable the touchpad still if you are asking for a software then you can search in the software centre for pointing devices and install that.\nyou'll find it in system > preferences > pointing devices\nthere you'll find the option to disable touchpad under General tab\n\nA: Many laptops have a hotkey (Fn + Touchpad key) which should Switch On/Off a touchpad under Ubuntu as well (like it works in Windows systems). However, such keys combination doesn't work in my Asus K52F (which has a new i3 Intel chipset).\nI found that Jupiter applet link text works very well in my case.\n", "Q: Which tool to use for \"home banking\"? I would like to manage my bank accounts in a secure manner on Ubuntu.\nI saw several applications in the Software Centre, but I don't know which one to choose. I don't need fancy features like stock options. I just have regular accounts which I want to follow, I don't want complicated stuff.\nAs bank data are quite sensitive, I would highly prefer an application that does encryption of the data. Though, if you have a really cool app but it does not have this feature, as long as it offers to store the data in one dedicated place, I could do with encrypting that place.\nSo what tool do you use that could fit my needs?\n\nA: Grisbi is what I use, and I really find it easy and full-featured.\nIt allows for crypting your files if needed.\n\n\nA: There is also kmymoney\n\n\nA: I use wxBanker\n\nwxBanker is a lightweight personal finance manager. It focuses on being as simple and straightforward to use as possible.\nThe main project page is located at https://launchpad.net/wxbanker, which contains downloads as well an Ubuntu PPA. Also linked are resources such as teams and mailing lists for translators, users, and developers.\n\n\nA: Probably the most powerful solution you can use is GnuCash. It's not the easiest to learn, but there is quite a bit of documentation available to teach it, and it has a lot of useful features such as double-entry, hierarchical accounts, and the ability to import from Quicken. The GnuCash developers have specifically stated that they will not take on the responsibility for encryption, as it goes against their philosophy of making a program do one thing well; but they state that they are in full support of using encrypted file systems to store your data.\n\nA: Homebank \nHomebank is, as the name suggests, a home banking application. It targets home users rather than businesses so seems well suited to your need.\n\nAs far as encryption is concerned, I don't think this is an inbuilt ability. However, you can keep all of your files in a particular folder and encrypt that separately. An encrypted /home might be useful for this. Homebank does allow you to set the default directory for its files, but does not appear to stop you putting them in other, less secure, places.\n\nSee also, this related question.\n\nA: I found YNAB (you need a budget) which runs very nice in wine too. The upcoming version 5 appears to be web-based instead.\nThere's a free companion app for Android and iOS too, though it's not standalone, it requires you to have the YNAB software also. \nThis software completely turned around how I think about money! At its core it's a simple envelope system, but it emphasizes a method that looks forward (give every dollar a job: what does my money need to do before I'm paid again) rather than the backward-looking post-mortem of basically all other tools (what happened, where did all my money go?).\nThe YNAB website offers many free online classes - highly recommended. There's also a user forum but frankly the YNAB subreddit is even better.\n\nA: I use Mint.com.  It is all online, which may bother some people that Mint has access to all your data, but other than that, it works really well for tracking expenses and making a budget.\n\nA: While it's not a desktop application I would recommend Mint by Intuit. Being web based it will run on any system with internet connection and can connect to most any bank, credit card, or other money service.\nAt this time support for international banks appears to be:\n\n...financial institutions in the United States and Canada. We hope to support more countries in the future.\n\nWhich can be a pitfall for those outside of the North American continent that don't have a bank which operates in the US or CA.\n", "Q: How can I set my laptop to remember my multiple display configuration?

Am I doing something wrong?\nThis is little bit easier in windows.\nIs there some application for ubuntu too?\n\nA: These settings are stored in your xorg.conf file. I'm guessing you have an intel chip (you say netbook).

The icons on the Unity launcher are square and contain the icon image and have a coloured background. The icons have different colours as their backgrounds (see screenshot).

Am struggling to install vmtools on a ubuntu 10.04 server guest on my esxi server.  I have tried the \"Install VM Tools\" option but that does nothing.  I have tried running the apt-get install vmware-tools but get the message that there are no packages.  Has anyone managed to do this as it is driving me nuts?\n\nA: When you use the \"Install VM Tools\" action a virtual media should be available from the cdrom from the guest OS (the cdrom is attached to the vmware tools iso).\nBecause you are using a server install (no cdrom auto mount magic) you will need to manually mount the cdrom:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/cdrom\nsudo mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom\n\nCheck the contents from /mnt/cdrom, there is a binary that you will need to execute to install the tools (I don't have vmware installed right now to check).\n", "Q: How can I limit CD drive speed while on the live CD to avoid drive noise? I sometimes disconect my harddisks for the weeks while only using the internet and I use the Ubuntu Live CD. But every time it needs something while in live desktop it accelerates and makes a lot of noise, also the acceleration takes too long. I want lower drive speed than acceleration lags, because acceleration lags stop me completly exactly when I need something.\nHow can I lower the CD drive speed, say to maximum 16x, without restarting?\nI can't restart because I only use the CD drive, no harddisks, no flash disks, no network disks.\nEdit:\nNo USB drives.\nSetcd does not work for the live session.\n\nA: well, if you don't want to buy a pendrive, do the following lines:\nsudo apt-get install setcd\nsetcd -x 1\n\nChange -x 1 to -x [number]. Higher the number, faster the drive.\nBut you should remember, that CD works on high speed for a reason. Ubuntu may become slow, when you do that.\n\nA: The easiest thing to do is use the supplied USB creator tool or Unetbootin to create a bootable USB drive, which is exactly the same thing as using a Live CD, only without the drive noise.\n", "Q: Which contact sheet generator can be scripted? A contact sheet is a image containing the name and a the small version of a group of images, like this:\n\nWhich is the best program to do it from the command line (preferably something that is already package with Ubuntu)?\n\nA: montage (part of the imagemagick package) can do this.\nThe options are exhastive so i thoroughly recommend running man montage but here's an example I pulled to show off the perverse level of detail you can go into:\nmontage -size 400x400 ~/Pictures/2008/Sept/*.JPG  -thumbnail 200x200 -font /var/lib/defoma/gs.d/dirs/fonts/Vera.ttf  -set caption '%t' -bordercolor Lavender -background grey40  -gravity Center   -pointsize 9  -density 144x144  +polaroid  -resize 50%   -set label ''  -background white  -geometry +1+1  -tile 5x  index.html\n\nIt makes both a webpage and a contact image.\n\nA: For interactive use, feh takes the prize, especially if you're dealing with a lot of images. feh -t images... and you're off. Has options to easily control thumb and total sizes, and the thumbs are clickable through to the real thing.\nFor printing, feh works, but montage (as per @Oli's suggestion) is probably more dependable as it handles more image formats than feh.\nFor completeness I should mention that gimp-plugin-registry has a plugin for Gimp (\"Contact Sheet 2.0\") that produces contact sheets from a directory of images, which is relatively user friendly.\n", "Q: What repositories are you using for 10.10 software? Here is hoping that this is not duplicated somewhere else...\nBack before the easy addition of Launchpad PPAs, many of us used to customize our sources list to include user/3rd party repositories. Some ambitious Ubuntu'ers would even maintain updated lists on their websites.  It was the easiest way to install software for things like Google Earth in the earlier days.\nSo the question I am asking may prove useful for the newcomers and for the experienced.\nWhat other repositories (like Medibuntu) have you found useful for 10.10 (other than PPAs)?\n\nA: The getdeb repositories (and playdeb ones) for sure : go there to see more, it's better to see it yourself !  : http://www.getdeb.net/welcome/\n\nA: My understanding is that there is a general movement towards PPA's of individual devs. As winniemie point out, there is getdeb.net, but there is also ubuntu-tweak.com that serves out individual packages, both via the site and then their application, ubuntutweak.\n\nA: VirtualBox is the only non-Canonical or non-PPA repository I use right now.\nOh actually... It's still a PPA but it's more than one application. In 10.04 I used a \"rolling updates\" PPA. It was basically an aggregation of several other PPAs. It wasn't a daily pull but rather more stable updates. I use the  Maverick version now though they're still getting up to speed, adding new things.\nMaverick quasi rolling :)\n", "Q: Different cursor in Skype I have changed my default cursor theme to the DMZ black, but when my mouse hovers over any Skype window, it turns into DMZ white (only while hovering). When I try to take a screenshot of it, the cursor shows up as black on the image, which is rather weird.\nAnybody who's got an idea how to fix it?\n\nA: This is common problem with Skype, I've had it too. To fix it, you need to install kde's system-settings (sadly, no option for the cursor in qt-config, and it's probably not so trivial, or wise to edit the qt-config by hand). In KDE's system settings, choose the mouse option to change your Qt cursor theme.\nAnother possible fix is to change the default theme for your entire system. Run galternatives and change the x-cursor theme to the one you currently use.\n\nA: Strange, but on my system (13.04) the issue has been healed just through installation of libxcursor1:i386.\n\nA: I'm using th Mint KDE 16 64 bit, and I install skype from software center, and have that problem. Then I run install command on terminal shell:\nsudo apt-get install libxcursor1:i386\n\nAfter that I reboot the computer, and it's done.\n\nA: Maybe someone else would be also interested in another possible solution: when I installed Skype from Ubuntu repository (11.10) I also had the same issue - but I've tried downloading and installing Skype client from skype.com page and then after installing it - normal KDE settings applies on it as well...\n", "Q: Will I be able to set a 2560x1440 resolution on a 27\" screen? I just picked up one of those fancy Dell U2711 27\" screens that has a maximum resolution of 2560x1440. While I await delivery, I need to upgrade my graphics card to drive this baby as my current one won't do the trick.\nI am considering an EVGA with an nVidia GTS450 chip and dual DVI-I ports. It can go up to 2560x1600 in DVI-D mode with the corresponding dual link cable.\nShould I expect any driver issues with this setup and the nVidia binary drivers? I have googled quite a bit and most people I found claiming problems with these resolutions are using notebooks (so either VGA or HDMI, that I don't think should work).\nEdit: Is it possible alhough all the components are good up to 2560x1600, that they won't allow me to set 2560x1440? I've had this happen with some widescreen LCDs in the past where a video card would go up to a higher resolution, but the exact mode needed was not an option (resolutions such  1152x... come to mind).\nConclusion: Indeed, everything worked out of the box with the nVidia binary drivers in Meerkat. Just for future reference, I ended up using a GTX460 card with a dual-link DVI-D cable. Thanks!\n\nA: Quoting this blog post:\n\nI'm using the Displayport connector [...] and have no problems running at the full 2560x1440 resolution. Further, I had zero problems using the Nvidia driver that comes with Ubuntu. It detected the display, set the maximum resolution and refresh rate, and worked right out of the box.\n\nI can only assume that it will work fine when using a dual link cable.\n\nBTW, the monitor's manual explicitly states that the HDMI resolution is limited to 1080p, so ignore all the threads where people complain about not getting 2560x1440 via HDMI. :)\n\nA: Up to 2560x1600 is supported by both the DVI dual-link and nvidia driver.\nIt should \"just work\". Sounds like an awesome display.\n\nA: I'm running dual display, 2048x1152 + 1280x1024 without trouble.\nWith a suitable graphics card and dual link hookup, I think you'll be fine.\n", "Q: How to disable hibernating? Whereas many questions are geared towards implementing hibernation, mine is how to disable it.\nI've just encrypted my swap partition, and I such my system can still hibernate, but cannot resume anymore. So, to avoid mistakes I would to disable hibernating system-wide.\nNote: I still want suspend!\n\nA: Run this:\nsudoedit /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.freedesktop.upower.policy\n\nChange action id=\"org.freedesktop.upower.hibernate\">defaults>allow_active to no. Save and exit. That will stop users being able to do that from the desktop.\nIf you have a sleep or hibernate button on your keyboard or case, these will still work IIRC so you need to \"break\" their default behaviour.

I want to install GNU Parallel in Ubuntu but I can't find a package for it in the default Ubuntu repos.

One server has ssh shell access (and thus scp, sftp, etc.), the other only ftp. \nMy home computer is an Ubuntu desktop. What I have been doing till now is using Filezilla to download to my desktop, and then uploading to the new server from there. This is slow and inefficient, everything is transferred twice and my home network speed is limited, and has a monthly bandwidth quota besides. The two servers have a fast connection between them though. I'd rather just ssh into one server and retrieve the files I need directly. \nSo what I'm looking for a console ftp client which has feature set similar to Filezilla (I need to pick and choose what to transfer and what to leave behind). Does such a creature exist?\n\nA: To my mind, the most powerful command-line ftp client is undoubtly lftp.\n\n\n*\n\n*it allows one to use standard shell command over the ftp wire\n\n*It provides up/down queue for long operations\n\n\nA: Check if Midnight Commander (mc) is installed. If so, you can do ftp from there.\n\nA: You could make life really easy for yourself using a fuse filessytem.\nOn the machine you can ssh into, install curlftpfs\nsudo apt-get install curlftpfs\n\nThen add yourself to group fuse\nsudo usermod  -aG fuse <username>\n\nLog out, and log back in again, for changes to take effect.\nMake a directory for a mount point\nmkdir ~/ftp\n\nThen mount the ftp server as a local filesystem\ncurlftpfs ftp.server.com ~/ftp -o user=<ftp_username>\n\nEnter the password when prompted.\nYou can then use the remote ftp servers files as if they appear on the local server. Allowing you to use cp, rsync etc without the hassle of handling ftp.\nRead the man page for more information\nEspecially useful if you do a lot of this sort of thing.\n\nA: Just in case anyone still needs this :)\nI was able to transfer a large website from a linux VM (from the SSH command line) to the Azure website cloud service DIRECTLY (via ftp) by using the ncftp client as guided here \nFinally, remember to remove the ftp client from your vm afterwards.\ncheers.\n", "Q: How to find out what Graphics Card is present in your system?

My requirements are really only for a basic desktop on the monitor's default resolution.\n\nA: Via chrome9 was to have been detected during the installation, because X.org supports this device using Openchrome driver xserver-xorg-video-openchrome.

Go to launchpad.net and open a bug. Don't forget to provide lspci to help solve it.\n\nA: There were already several bugs reported in early October for the openchrome and VIA in Ubuntu 10.10, since many people found that their machine (or rather xorg xserver) failed to come up after the upgrade.

My main computer is a laptop and I would like to buy an external, bigger monitor for it. I already tried one, but it only had a normal VGA connection. Unfortunately the screen flickered a lot, and I suspect that this was because my notebook's VGA port does not deliver enough power.\nThat is the reason why I want to buy a monitor which I can use with my HDMI port. Is this properly supported with Ubuntu? Can I buy any screen I like that has an HDMI plug? Or do you have to avoid certain products?\n\nA: Ubuntu should be compatible with any monitor you buy. I assume you have Ubuntu already installed and the graphics chip is supported.\nThe VGA problem you had was almost certainly a configuration problem (e.g. wrong/unusable refresh rate), not a hardware problem.\nFor a big screen (1680x1050 or higher resolution) I would anyway recommend using a digital connection. So either directly HDMI or DVI with a HDMI-to-DVI adapter. \n\nA: I use Samsung UN40KU6300 and UN40KU7000 40-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV.  It performs like an awesome computer monitor but with the price of a TV (\n\nMy only issue with Ubuntu and HDMI is if you are using a USB-C HDMI adapter.

I've been trying to create a short-cut key for grabbing part of the screen.\nIf I run the command /usr/bin/gnome-screenshot --area the program I want runs and does what I want. When I createa a custom action in the keyboard shortcuts menu, and I activate the command (using ctrl-prnscr) the command fires up but behaves as though the --area option isn't there (it grabs the whole screen instead of giving me a cursor to choose with).

I recently upgraded Ubuntu 10.10 from 32 to 64bit, but there are two entries I'd like to remove - they're the 32bit entries, with -pae suffix. There is even a initrd-...-pae image for them in /boot. Do you know how  to clean this mess?\n\nA: Rather than just deleting them (and thus confusing the package manager), uninstall the kernels you don't want to show in the GRUB list. Then run sudo update-grub to regenerate the list.\n", "Q: How do I install Parallels Tools via the command line? I have Ubuntu Server 10.10 running on Parallels 6 (latest update from yesterday) on my iMac. I click on the Install Parallels Tools in the Parallels Desktop Menu, but do not see where what I think should be the file prl-tools-lin.iso is placed.\nDon't understand whether the warning that I may have to do mount -o exec applies to me or not. Think I might be able to mount and run the .iso file, if I can locate it. Any ideas?\n\nA: I have solved this issue with Ubuntu Server 18.04 as follows:\n1) Click \"Update Parallels tools\" (upper right corner of the parallels virtual machine window)\n2) Log in and then give the commands:\n$ sudo mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom\n$ cd /media/cdrom\n$ sudo ./install\n\nIf, when mounting the CD-ROM, you get the error:\nmount: /media/cdrom: unknown filesystem type 'iso9660'\nyou can fix this using:\n$ sudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-image-$(uname -r)\n\n\nA: With Parallels 10.1.1 and Ubuntu 14.04 using the menu entry Actions -> Install parallels tools... did not mount the installer in /media/parallels. Trying sudo updatedb; locate prl-tools-lin.iso also returned an empty result.\nThe solution is to cd /usr/lib/parallels-tools then sudo ./install, which will execute the text installer. Incidentally sudo ./install-gui (from the same directory) will execute the GUI installer (requires X server).\n\nA: To find a file on your compute you can use the built in index, from a command line:\nsudo updatedb; locate prl-tools-lin.iso\nBut really to answer this question we need to go to the guides:\nSelect Actions -> Install parallels tools...\nIn a terminal, enter:\ncd /media/Parallels\\ Tools/\nsudo sh parallels-tools.run\n\nIf this fails to work then you can get the iso file and mount it manually like so:\nsudo mount -o loop /path/to/prl-tools-lin.iso /mnt\nDon't forget to unmount it when you're finished:\nsudo umount /mnt\n\nA: If you're using Parallels 6+ instead of typing: \"sudo sh parallels-tools.run\" you will probably need to type \"sudo sh install\" without the quotation marks.\n", "Q: My system screen goes black and displays Term Signal Killed?

I have to start the UbuntuOne Preferences, than I have to wait a while until the connect butten is enabled and than I can connect. How can I start it after login?\n\nA: The Ubuntu One launcher delays 30 seconds after session startup before starting the syncdaemon. The syncdaemon can then take a few minutes before it's alive and well and answering requests. So, if you wait 30 seconds after startup, you should be able to open a terminal and see the process with ps -C ubuntuone-syncdaemon.\nIf you find that it isn't starting, in that same terminal, please do\n/usr/lib/ubuntuone-client/ubuntuone-syncdaemon --debug\n\nand pastebin the output so we can get to the root of the issue.\n\nA: Make sure it is enabled in System -> Preferences -> Startup Applications\n\n\nA: Ok, I made some tests.

If you do have other media players, you will need to copy those players into the below command and add any other players you want to backlist.\ngsettings set com.canonical.indicator.sound blacklisted-media-players \"['<mediaplayer>','<mediaplayer']\"\n\nHere is an example of how to blacklist spotify from the sound indicator:\ngsettings get com.canonical.indicator.sound blacklisted-media-players\n['']\n\ngsettings set com.canonical.indicator.sound blacklisted-media-players \"['spotify']\"\n\ngsettings get com.canonical.indicator.sound blacklisted-media-players\n['spotify']\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: While the other answer didnt work for me with 11.04 Natty Narwhal I looked for another way. For example to remove rhythmbox from the sound-menue the following command in terminal worked:\ngsettings set com.canonical.indicator.sound blacklisted-media-players \"['rhythmbox']\"\n\n\nA: Rather than blacklist the entry, it can be removed from the list.\nTry the following:\nkch:~$ gsettings get com.canonical.indicator.sound interested-media-players\n['banshee', 'rhythmbox']\n\nThis shows I have two entries.

Or is there a tool for Ubuntu which can do it?\nThere is an example here on wikipedia. If you hover your mouse over a person in the image, there is a hyperlink to an article about that person.\n\nA: I found the solution in the Imagemagick documentation. The section on 'image map' has it all.\n\nA: I'm not sure if I understand what you want, but this:\nmontage -size 64x64 -geometry +5+5 -tile 3x 'img/*.jpg' images.html\n\nwould create an images.html file, that shows the montage file 'images.png' (= thumbnails of size 64x64, 5px spacing, 3 columns) and already correctly links the thumbs to the images in the img folder.

I case others are looking in the future/\nIn the current release I'm using Compiz.reloaded manjaro pkg, there doesn't seem to be a bicubic filter included. I also was not looking to improve the window button AA but the OpenGL effect AA (like Desktop Cube for example). \nMy way of solving this was to go to the nVidia X Server Settings and to set the OpenGL image quality to High Quality vs the default Quality setting. I also over-rode application AA setting to maxed out AA. It looks alot better now but I have GTX 1080 so your mileage may vary with this solution depending on how powerful your GPU is. If you're gaming on steam, I wouldn't overide application AA settings as that could cause instability with games. \nProbably the better solution would be to make a individual 3d profile for compiz but the mechanisms to do this in the nVidia X Server Settings are very un-user friendly and I just don't have the patience to learn it at the moment.\n", "Q: \"No required driver detected for unity\" on Apple iBook G4 I know this question exactly looks like “No required driver detected for unity” on Dell Mini 1010, but like the title states, I'm not using a Dell Mini 10, but an Apple iBook G4. From what I understand of the associated question, it seems like a graphics device driver issue. So, where can I find such a driver ?\n\nA: Unity requires accelerated graphics.

I don't know when it all started but the thing is that when I log in, I see a very intense disk access activity for a while that prevents any application from starting in a reasonable time (it takes from 10 to 20 seconds).  \nThat's why I cannot launch a terminal window and top or iostat just in time to see what happens. When it prompts it's too late.  \nI tried to delimit the problem uninstalling zeitgeist, docky or whatever program I thought was behind that behaviour. I even deleted my Private encrypted folder to avoid decryption issues. Nothing changed. \nAny idea about how to proceed? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: I'd switch to a virtual terminal at the GDM login screen (Ctrl+Alt+F1), log in and start iotop (you maybe need to install it first). Then switch back to GDM (Ctrl+Alt+F7), log in, and immediately switch back to iotop using Ctrl+Alt+F1. You should now see, which process is responsible for the heavy IO.\n\nForgot to mention an alternative: you could try using bootchart to generate a chart that visualizes the boot process + desktop start. You maybe need to edit its configuration, so it shows more than just the first seconds of desktop loading:\nOpen the file '/etc/init/bootchart.conf' and remove the line:--crop-after=compiz,metacity,mutter,kwin,xfwm4 \\\nTwo things:\n\n\n*\n\n*You maybe need to reboot twice after the first installation to get a useful result (it's possible that an index file needs to be rebuilt, I don't know for sure).\n\n*Once installed, bootchart will run on every boot, unless you add bootchart=disable to the 'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT' parameter in '/etc/default/grub' (followed by a sudo update-grub).\n", "Q: How to import ubottu factoids database to my IRC supybot?

I found the ubottu factoids database here http://www.ubottu.com/factoids.cgi\nI want to add this database to my IRC bot. Can anyone tell me the procedure?\n\nA: ubottu uses the Encyclopedia plugin to manage its factoids, not the 'Factoid' plugin that comes with supybot itself.  You can download the current bot code by running bzr branch lp:ubuntu-bots, more information about the bot code can be found on its launchpad page.\nEither drop all the subfolders that you get after branching the bzr repo into your bot plugin directory or create a new one and add that path into supybot.directories.plugins\nAfter loading Encyclopedia inside supybot, you'll need to modify your settings so that it knows where your factoid database is.  The important config values for that are plugins.encyclopedia.datadir and plugins.encyclopedia.database . If you don't set these, it will use your bot's data directory and ubuntu as the database name. (note: the database name should be entered without the .db extension)\n\nA: Ubuntu Factoids uses the Encyclopedia plugin. Get it from bzr branch lp:ubuntu-bots and then download Ubuntu factoids database from here. Place your database in the data directory (i.e /supybot/data/). You should point to the location of the database in your bot configuration. Be sure that you enable Encyclopedia plugin by typing load Encyclopedia.

I'm currently uninstalling redundant applications from my Ubuntu 10.10 system and I came across the Byobu Window Manager under the 'Provided by Canonical' section. Does this play any sort of critical role in window management, or is it simply a redundant application that's been included to facilitate some niche operation?\n\nA: Byobu is a user-friendly wrapper around GNU Screen, which is a terminal multiplexer.\nUnless you're a command line junkie or sysadmin you likely don't need it; you can remove it without it affecting your GUI.\n", "Q: Remove nVidia driver and go back to Nouveau I've installed nVidia driver successfully but I want to go back to Nouveau driver and eliminate any xorg.conf file created by nVidia config tools.\nWhat is the proper way to do it? (not ending up with no driver at all, or no X server)\n\nA: Quick answer: remove xorg.conf (see below) and then disable the nvidia drivers from additional drivers menu once the gui is available.\nLong answer: I did get nvidia and dual screen to work, but spent two days trying... here's my knowledge. Single screen was always the easy chore. Stock install of 11.10 without Nvidia works but not for dual screen. Countless issues but one thing to document is whether 11.10 nouveau video driver is being used or nvidia. After an upgrade to 11.10 the nvidia blows up. To get single screen to work hit ctrl-alt-f2 and login to shell. If you know it's nvidia plugins still being used try:\n(make backup first)\nsudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak     \nsudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf\nsudo reboot\n\nBut going back and forth can mess things up so sometimes make sure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu  nouveau uses ~/.config/monitors.xml\nIf nvidia is enabled instead, make sure to name this .bak so it's not used\n\n*Nividia uses xorg.conf\n If nouveau/stock driver is used name this .bak\nOtherwise things might boot to hung shell. Sometimes nvidia screws up xorg.conf itself (pre 11.10) and the file should be deleted.\nLong story short to get dual monitors to work I found that only nvidia 173-updates drivers from the settings>Harware>additional drivers menu would work. The nvidia console itself is still broken but you can manually add :\nOption      \"twinview\"\n\nto the screen section of xorg.conf and after reboot it works. (theres other posts about this) To get an initial xorg.conf run \nsudo nvidia-xconfig\n\nThe ppx-swat/ nividia current stuff did not work even after adding the twinview line. Stock 11.10 drivers were nice for single monitor but with dual screen make the windows super laggy, as if crashing or something. I hope this helps someone using nvidia and 11.10\n\nA: To reconfigure xorg.conf. Move your current /etc/X11/xorg.conf. If things go wrong you might need it later again:\nsudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.BACKUP\n\nThe following steps will install the nouveau-driver on configure the xserver accordingly:\nsudo apt-get install nouveau-firmware\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg\n\nGo following the screen steps, answering the wizard questions and you should able to restore or reconfigure to previous Nouveau state.\n\nA: If you installed using the recommended procedure through System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers or Additional Drivers, simply go back there and click the driver in use to hilite it, click \"Remove\". this will safely remove the nVidia driver in use and allow Nouveau to take it's place. You can, if desired, remove the /etc/X11/xorg.conf manually before restarting the computer.\nThe driver in use is normally the one with the green button on the left.\n", "Q: Disable CPU frequency scaling on Lenovo Laptop I have a bug where my CPU frequency is scaling down every few hours or so. This happens when:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm on AC power\n\n*scaling governor is on 'Performance'\n\n\nWhat do you have to do to disable CPU frequency scaling? I know you can manually force the min CPU frequency uder /sys/devices/system/cpu, however I really want a permanent solution so I don't have to be constantly changing the CPUfreq values.\n\nA: Just to make sure it's not going to interfere, remove the powernowd package from your system. From a terminal, run:\nsudo apt-get remove powernowd\nAfter that, or if you don't have that package installed, install rcconf by running:\nsudo apt-get install rcconf\nThen run sudo rcconf and press space with the ondemand service highlighted to disable it. This service controls CPU frequency scaling. Press enter to save and quit. To manually stop it once, you can run sudo /etc/init.d/ondemand stop.\n\nA: I guess ayan4m1 explain everything to remove cpu frequency scaling from your box, except by one little detail: If you remove cpu scaling (or set it for performance service), then you will increase energy consumption (even in AC power).\n", "Q: OS Drive and Storage Drive Well on my computer, I can't install Ubuntu to my 750 and boot from it, but it does however, work from my 160, and I use this as a work computer, and I have 280+ GB of information that I plan to put and use on it. \nSo, it was suggested to me, after much frustration, to use the 160, as the OS drive, and the 750 as a storage drive. How do I get all of my files on that other harddrive and make it work as though it was all on one harddrive. \nThe programs would know to go to whatever folders for whatever they need, such as Banshee for music, etc. This is really... odd, and I didn't expect this to happen, so how do I do this? \n\nA: I think it makes a lot of sense to leave the biggest drive for data, though it's unfortunate you can't successfully install on your 750G drive. Perhaps you should open a bug for this with the model numbers and everything?\nAs for how to setup your system to use the 160G HD for Ubuntu and the 750G for data, have you already installed? Assuming the install is already done and Ubuntu boots properly; you can simply mount the 750G drive in Ubuntu and use it normally to keep data files. It should be detected and visible in nautilus, as such:\n\nIf it doesn't appear there, you may need to do a bit more like see if it's detected in the Disk Utility (System->Administration->Disk Utility), and possibly format it if it's not already holding your data. \nOnce your disk works properly and can be mounted from Nautilus, you can add it to mount points by editing /etc/fstab (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountingWindowsPartitions for a good howto with details). From there, you could do things like mounting directories from your data drive to a directory under /home/your user/Music, for example, or creating links from these directories into one of the data directories in your home folder.\n", "Q: Update manager: \"A problem occurred when checking for the updates\" As of a few days ago I have this red circle with a horizontal white line through it persist on the panel in the top right.

Every now and then, I encounter some mention of other devices being shown in the power indicator. For example, along with the laptop battery, listing the battery level for an iPod being charged over USB. I understand the specification mentions that, too, but I definitely haven't seen it with any of my various devices that have batteries in them.\nSo, does that feature truly exist right now? Any information on what hardware is supported and whether that support can expand in the future? Anything people can do to help? :)\n\nA: I have 2 Logitech wireless mouse (mice ?). One of them (an old model) shows the battery level on the indicator. The other one (newer) doesn't.\nI'm really not sure what makes it work or not, or how. But I can tell you it actually exists :-)\n\nA: The gnome-power-manager source has many references to wireless mouse battery levels and the like, and the NEWS file has some related entries. I only took a cursory look, and am not sure; try something like bzr branch lp:ubuntu/gnome-power-manager && grep -r -i mouse gnome-power-manager/ and see if you can figure it out.\n\nA: Also, if you plug an iPhone (not sure about iPod Touch) You'll see this under there\n\n\nA: As far as I know there isn't any hardware support for iPod, or other devices to express battery levels.

Any help?\n\nA: It depends where you placed the veetle file. If you downloaded it to your desktop, run cd Desktop and then run the sh.\nEDIT:The veetle script is already an executable. Do not run as root, veetle recommends against it and it will add complications later. (This happened to me)\nSh is needed to run the command.\n\nA: Try ./veetle-0.9.17-linux-install.sh with a dot slash ./ at the beginning, or possibly sudo ./veetle-0.9.17-linux-install.sh since things are generally installed as root. (Do not put 'run' or 'sh' at the beginning. That is not needed.)

Obviously this is the kind of major decision that would require public feedback and a meeting of the technical board, but I can't seem to find the minutes from the meeting it was discussed.\nWere there UDS sessions?  A thread on the mailing list?  I admit I wasn't paying as much attention as I could have, but I was a bit surprised when Mark made the announcement at this developer summit.  I got there halfway through the first day, and by that point most people were acting as though making netbook edition the default was a foregone conclusion, so I figure I must have missed something.\n\nA: There was no public discussion. (Yes there were sessions on Unity at UDS, but these were about the path forward for Unity, not about whether it should be default or not.)\n\nMaking Unity was a decision made by Canonical on behalf of the Ubuntu community. It was announced in the first session at UDS by Mark Shuttleworth. As far as I'm aware this was the first time the idea was announced (although there were blueprints on Launchpad prior to the announcement that suggested it was a possibility).\n\nAll members of the Ubuntu Technical Board are Canonical employees (at least they all have @canonical.com emails) and I am sure they were all involved in the decision to use Unity.\nSome things I think we should appreciate: it would have been very difficult for the community alone to make a unanimous balanced decision about the best way forward. This is especially true given Canonical's planned improvements to Unity in the next six months. Canonical was able to conduct usability testing, etc and also talk to OEMs (e.g. Dell) about the impact of the switch.\nThis being said, it can certainly be argued that the roles of the Ubuntu technical board, other Ubuntu teams and Canonical could made clearer.\n", "Q: Recurring Error in Update Manager - Could Not Initialize The Package Manager \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I fix this “E:Type '*' is not known on line * in source list …” update error? \n\nPlease refer to the attached screen-shot.

I've disabled all useless stuffs to me in Startup Applications, but still I cannot obtain fair performances. Any suggestion?\n\nA: You can try the alternative (bootchart) I posted here: Intense hard drive access activity immediately after log in\n\nA: BootChart is the definitive tool. Here is a helpful explanation:\n\nBootchart is a tool for performance analysis and visualization of the GNU/Linux boot process. Resource utilization and process information are collected during the boot process and are later rendered in a PNG, SVG or EPS encoded chart.\n\nInstall it (open a terminal):\nsudo apt-get install bootchart\n\nVisit the BootChart.org website for documentation and how-to use it.

Any ideas?\n\nA: Unity has known performance problems due to the mutter window manager. For this reason, Unity is switching to compiz next release - Ubuntu 11.04. You are probably better off waiting until then before using it.\nReporting a bug may help the developers. To do this press Alt+F2 and enter: ubuntu-bug unity.

Hey i would love to get into 3D modeling and design and i was wondering if their were any alternatives to 3DS Max and other such programs for Ubuntu\n\nA: Blender \n\nBlender is the best free and open source 3D modelling program out there by a long shot!\nThe program is under constant development, has a huge community and has been used in many major films for video editing and 3D concepts. As Said before blender has new builds being uploaded hourly at graphicall.org and you can download all the official stable, aplha and beta versions of the program at belnder.org.\nThe community is friendly and welcoming and you can fit right in at sites suchs as blenderartist.org, blendernation and blenderguru (great website for tutorials.\nI myself have been using the program for about six years now, and have used it for both personal and commercial projects: These can be seen at (sixthlaw3d.wordpress.com).\nTo see the quality of what can be produced using blender, watch Elephants Dream, Big Buck Bunny and Sintel. All were created using blender, and other free software on Ubuntu.\nThe program has a brilliant set of tools, and the development team are constantly making improvements on the software to keep it cutting edge and competitive.\nThis is a very, very short summary of this awesome program but check out it in more detail in the above links :)\nHappy blendering!:)\n", "Q: Application to organize / manage installed networks I was wondering if there is a Application where you can organize networks. I mean if you have installed some networks you have to note every pc's name, his ip-address and so on.\nIs there a Application where you can manage it?\n\nI saw the monitoring tools but that is not exactly what I'm looking for. Maybe I didnt explain me well, after all my englis his not so good :)\nFor example if I install many different networks I write in a book how I configured them. I write pc-name ip-address ip-gateway ip-broadcast and so on for each network.\nIt will be great if I can do it in a program to organize it well, and for example it gives me a node view of the network.\n\nA: You can use a network monitoring tool that comes together with an „inventory” feature.\nI am using Zabbix for monitoring all computers from a network and in Zabbix you can create a profile for each computer when you can add the mac address and various other information. Maybe Zabbix is a bit to much for your needs.\nYou can also try GLPI Project http://www.glpi-project.org/?lang=en ... I am not sure it is is also to complex for your needs or look at this project http://www.open-audit.org/about.php\n\nA: It sounds like you need an IPAM application along the lines of Infoblox.  The only free (GPL) alternative I could find is this tool, called IPplan.\nIt allows for a spreadsheet-like view of a subnet, listing nodes automatically (and querying via SNMP if desired) and allows for individual nodes to be edited for additional information.\n", "Q: Keyboard Function Keys Do Not Work I use the Microsoft Natural MultiMedia Keyboard 1.0A. The keyboard is not a wireless board.\nThe Escape button and the function keys have never worked. I am currently running on 10.10. On previous incarnations the keys never worked either. However a recent journey through all the Microsoft options in System > Preference > Keyboard > Layouts suggested that the Escape button could be functional.

Can I find out whether the keys can be made to work or not?\nOf the top buttons, nothing happens when I press My Documents; a small red cross appears at the top right of the screen when I press My Pictures and the Media, Mail and Web/Home buttons work just fine.\nThanks,\nAnthony.\n\nA: That looks like one of those non-standard keyboards where you have to press the F-lock key before you can press a function key?  Doesn't that work?\n\nA: your last question was: \"Okay,let's put it this way. My keyboard is a non-wireless Microsoft Natural Multimedia Keyboard 1.0A. How do I get the kernel to recognise the keyboard? – Anthony Burman Nov 22 '10 at 19:57\"\nFrom what your saying the problem however doesn't seem to be that the keyboard isn't recognised. You say that you get a red cross when you press pictures. that means Ubuntu get's input but just cannot comply.\nThe suggestion above is correct but perhaps brief. let's take the \"my pictures key\". if you want it to open shotwell when you press \"pictures key\" you should open System>Preferences>Keyboard Shotcuts and click \"add\" in the bottom. A screen pops up where you can enter the command: in the case of shotwell this will be: /usr/bin/shotwell\nBy default it will still be disabled but if you click \"disabled\" you can than press the button on your keyboard that you want to associate.\n(for other programs you could try to locate them in the terminal: locate program-name |grep bin (you will than have to choose the one in /usr/bin or /bin) if you want to boot a certain gnome applet you could try: locate gnome |grep bin ,it will show you a lot of gnome applets, names should be pretty explanatory.)\n\nA: It should be possible to go to System->Preferences->Keyboard Shortcuts and select your wished action.\nFor example select \"Home folder\" and press your My Documents button if you wish to open your home folder with this key.\n", "Q: Understanding the Sensors Applet I just installed the package sensors-applet and I'm having a hard time reading the outputs. It's giving me 4 different temperature readings:\n\nThe first two (TZ01 and temp1) always give exactly the same reading (usually 50°C/122°F); however, TZ01 properties says that 60°C is a high value, while temp1 properties says that 90°C is a high value. I'm assuming they're both the CPU, but which one has the correct high value?\nFurthermore, I still don't know what the other two are about. They always report similar (but not identical) temperature levels (usually around 15-17°C/58-64°F).

By default Banshee rips CDs in Ogg Vorbis format. I prefer to rip my CDs in FLAC format. I can't find a setting anywhere to make Banshee rip to FLAC. \nIs this possible?

For example in the runlevel 2:\n$ls -l /etc/rc2.d/\n...\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  17 2010-11-03 20:02 S20vboxdrv -> ../init.d/vboxdrv\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  25 2010-11-03 20:03 S20vboxweb-service -> ../init.d/vboxweb-service\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  17 2010-11-11 21:43 S21vboxsvc -> ../init.d/vboxsvc\n...\n\nIf I start|stop the service manually:\n$sudo /etc/init.d/vboxsvx start\n\nit works as expected.\nThe service doesn't appear listed if I do \"service --status-all\", but it shows up when I use sysv-rc-conf --list.\nIt doesn't start automatically  when I boot the computer. On the other hand, the service stops automatically when I reboot or shutdown. For some reason when the system boots the link /etc/rc2.d/S21vboxnet is not being executed or something else is happening. \nI know that Upstart is the way to do things now in Ubuntu, but SysV init is still supported, right?\nEDIT: I think I'm close to solving the problem. I think that the solution has to do with having my home file system encrypted. When the init process is executing the corresponding startup scripts and tries to execute \"sudo -H -u myuser VBoxManage myVirtualMachine -type vrdp > /dev/null\" it doesn't have access to myVirtualMachine's data(which is at an encrypted file system) because I haven't logged in as myuser yet and, therefore, my home filesystem hasn't been mounted.\n\nA: As I thought the whole problem was caused by my home partition being encrypted. \nI ended up following this question to remove encryption. \nMy advice is that, unless you know what you are doing, don't encrypt your home partition at Ubuntu's installation. If you do, be aware that unless you have logged in, everything under your home directory will be locked to other users (including root).\n\nA: Wouldn't it be better just to make a new system user to run VirtualBox than to un-encrypt your home folder?\nThat way you still have your protection and the VM's could start without issue. \n", "Q: Typing inverted question/exclamation marks I type a lot in Spanish and have a regular 105-key International Keyboard.

For example, gnome panel, is actually used by Ubuntu in its desktop version. It's the two panels (top and bottom and top) that you see when you open a session, includung the desktop. \nUnity consist of the dock on the right, the menu bar on the top, the applications and files menus....(http://www.google.com/images?um=1&hl=fr&client=ubuntu&channel=fs&tbs=isch%3A1&sa=1&q=ubuntu+unity&aq=f&aqi=g1&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=) : Unity is the whole interface of Ubuntu netbook ( and in 11.04 version, of Desktop version too). \nBut beware, Unity doesn't replace Gnome, it just replace the gnome interface.

I've read that GNU Emacs handles international scripts via a system called Mule (Multi-Lingual-Environment).  \nI also read (somewhere, a while back) that there was a move afoot (in recent years) to make it Unicode compliant, and that this was being implemented in version 23 (-ish?).   \nI typed some Unicode text (eg.कैसे) into gedit, and successfully copied it into Emacs. The copy-paste works in both directions.  \nHowever, in Emacs, using Ctrl+Shift+U to type a single Unicode-Codepoint does not work, nor is the IBus Input Method Editor recognized by Emacs.  \nWhat is the state of play with Emacs and Unicode?\n... and is it possible to use the IBus IME with Emacs?\n\nA: Short answer: IBus with ibus.el; Gnome Ctrl+Shift+U ⇒ Emacs C-x 8 RET\n\nEmacs's support for more-than-8-bit character sets comes from MULE, which is about as old as Unicode (it derives from support for Japanese), and much older than widespread support for Unicode (in terms of programs supporting Unicode text, fonts, etc.). Good Unicode support came with GNU Emacs 23, which is the default version as of Ubuntu 10.04. Acceptable Unicode support came with GNU Emacs 22, which was the default version as of Ubuntu 8.04. Prior versions did have some support for Unicode, but it was more common to run into bugs or limitations.\nEmacs doesn't use Gnome, so you can't use Gnome input methods in it. For example, Ctrl+Shift+U to insert a code point by its hexadecimal code is a Gnome feature, so it doesn't work in Emacs. The native Emacs equivalent is Ctrl+Q, which for historical reasons must be followed by the octal code; if you prefer hexadecimal, customize read-quoted-char-radix to the value 16. A similar Emacs command is C-x 8 RET (ucs-insert; if you use it often, you may want to bind it to a shorter key sequence), which can be followed by a hexadecimal code point or the name of a unicode character, with completion.\nEmacs has its own set of input methods, and can also use system input methods such as UIM (install uim-el. IBus support is relatively new; you need ibus.el, which isn't in Lucid and I think not in Maverick either; see also IBus on the Emacs wiki.\n\nA: GNU Emacs 23.x has built-in Unicode support for UTF-8-encoded text. Its also provides support for UTF-16. I really recommend you install the emacs23 package to avoid several bugs on Emacs related with Mule problems.\nAnd to try to avoid Intelligent Input Bus problem, you can install Anthy input systems. I've seen it works very well for Japanese:\nsudo apt-get install anthy anthy-el\n\nAfter installing it, edit your .emacsrc to include the text below:\n; Set load path for anthy.el\n(push \"/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/anthy/\" load-path)\n\n; Load anthy.el\n(load-library \"leim-list\")\n(load-library \"anthy\")\n\n;; Workarounds and customizations\n\n; Fix slow input response in emacs23\n(if (>= emacs-major-version 23)\n(setq anthy-accept-timeout 1))\n\n; Set japanese-anthy as the default input-method\n(setq default-input-method \"japanese-anthy\")\n\n; Shift-space to toggle anthy-mode (default is Ctrl-\\)\n(global-set-key (kbd \"S-SPC\") 'anthy-mode)\n\n; Map wide-space to hankaku-space\n(setq anthy-wide-space \" \")\n\nIf this doesn't work for you, you may have found a bug on Emacs regarding its support for iBus.\n", "Q: How to setup Thinkpad features on Thinkpad T500 I have a IBM-Lenovo Thinkpad T500.

Changing the option that defaults to 'This week' doesn't seem to help at all either. Am I missing something seriously basic here? All I want to do is a simple search within the folder or drive I've got open in Nautilus. Any help much appreciated.\n\nA: This is a known bug that affects 32-bit systems which has been fixed, you need to update.\nBug #644652: https://bugs.launchpad.net/nautilus-elementary/+bug/644652\n\nNautilus Elementary is no longer being actively developed:  http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/11/nautilus-elementary-is-dead-marlin-file-browser/\n\nA: Nautilus elementary's search now uses zeitgeist which means that you can only search the data which has been previously opened, this is the reason why you see Images, videos and source codes when you click on search because you have opened them before.\nSo this makes the search option in the nautilus elementary meaningless IMO.\nAlternatively, you can go to Places > Search for files for a better search or you can download Gnome Tracker Tool from the software centre.\n", "Q: Why there's no USB support in VirtualBox Ubuntu edition?

(my computer at one point could not find the boot record because I was playing around with the partitions.. i couldn't start the computer, had to install new UBUntu, and my boot menu came back).\nSo I want to get rid of this duplicate Ubuntu install without having the same problem again where I cannot get the boot menu.  The duplicate install is what caused my boot menu to appear again so thinking that they are connected.\nThanks.\n\nA: *\n\n*Know the partition on which the \" / \" directory of your primary Ubuntu is mounted:\nRun this from your primary Ubuntu: df\nOR\nSystem > Administration > System Monitor > File Systems\n\n*Associate the GRUB (boot-menu) with your primary Ubuntu installation:\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/dev/sdan /dev/sda \nReplace sdan with the partition on which the \" / \" directory of your primary Ubuntu is mounted (sda1 or sda2 or sdan) \n\n*Remove the duplicate Ubuntu installation using a partitioning tool.\n\n*Boot your primary Ubuntu, and run this command:\nsudo update-grub\n\nA: You should be able to remove the duplicate and then run sudo update-grub in the remaining installation to update the grub menu. If you want to be safe, re-run sudo install grub /dev/sda where /dev/sda is the master boot hard drive. This will reinstall grub into the Master Boot Record, and configure it to point to your existing Ubuntu install's boot directory.\n\nA: Just do whatever you need to do to remove the extra Ubuntu installation (Like installing a new OS). Then just run the live version of Ubuntu (you can find it here) and follow this guide that will show you how to restore grub: http://aroundtheweb.info/2010/10/restorerecover-grub-2-ubuntu-10-10-maverick-meerkat-reinstalling-windows-xpvistawin7/\n", "Q: How do I make Empathy use the system proxy settings? I want to use Empathy which is provided by default with Ubuntu 10.10. Unfortunately, it seems unable to take account of the proxy settings I applied system-wide.\nOn the contrary, other programs are able to connect to the Internet, like for example Pidgin. Is there any solution to make Empathy also use my proxy settings?\n\nA: This is a longstanding bug in Empathy. There is currently no fix available but perhaps others can post work arounds.\n\nA: As already mentioned this is a bug with empathy (or at least with some of the connection protocols used in empathy). \nThere is a workaround for the MSN protocol: \nEmpathy is able to use the same connection protocols that pidgin uses (libpurple) through telepathy-haze, which is installed by default.\nFor MSN to work, uninstall telepathy-butterfly:\nsudo apt-get remove telepathy-butterfly \nThen restart Empathy, which will now fall back to use telepathy-haze for MSN connections. You should now be able to set \"use the http-method\" under \"Edit -> Accounts\" after adding a new account for MSN. \nThere might be similar workarounds for other protocols. For me everything else works out of the box (at least behind the  proxy at work).\n", "Q: Why do I have to enter my password twice when changing proxy settings? When I change the proxy settings and apply them system-wide, I always have to enter my super-user password, as anyone could expect.\nHowever, I have to do that twice : once for \"proxy settings\" and another time for \"Gconf\". How do I set this up so that I have to enter my password only once?\n\nA: The reason why is difficult to answer (could be just decision during the design), and it will probably be fixed - per this Brainstorm Idea. \nWhile its not fixed, you can try to prevent to enter password twice if you follow up the instuction from this bug #507095.\n", "Q: How to remove Windows partition and install Fedora 14? I currently have a dual-boot setup with Ubuntu and Windows. Now I would like to remove the Windows partition which is 150GB and install Fedora 14.\nIn other words, I want to be able to dual-boot Ubuntu and Fedora.\n\nA: One of the tools you will want to look into is GParted, which is a powerful partition manager for Linux.\nAssuming you installed Windows before any of the Linux partitions, you will need to do some moving around to get things working the way you describe. The best way to do this is to boot from the Ubuntu LiveCD (which includes GParted) and run it from there. (The reason being that you cannot modify partitions that are currently active (In most cases, anyway).)\nOnce the tool is started, you will be able to see all of the partitions on your disk and manipulate them as you see fit.\nHere is a screenshot of what the interface looks like:\n\nNotice the keys next to the ext4 and linux-swap partitions. That indicates that those partitions cannot be modified because they are in use.\nIn your case, assuming that you have backed up everything of importance on the Windows partition, simply remove it (it will probably be the first partition, with the NTFS filesystem).\nNow you can expand your Ubuntu partition to take up the space freed by removing the Windows partition, and you can add room for the Fedora partition in a similar way.\n\nA: If you want to keep your partitions the same size you can just use the Fedora installer and reformat the Windows partition.\n", "Q: How do I fix the GPG error \"NO_PUBKEY\"?

Is there a way to do this without using a terminal?\n\nA: Execute the following commands in terminal\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys <PUBKEY>\n\nwhere <PUBKEY> is your missing public key for repository, e.g. 8BAF9A6F.\nThen update   \nsudo apt-get update\n\nALTERNATE METHOD:\nsudo gpg --keyserver pgpkeys.mit.edu --recv-key  <PUBKEY>\nsudo gpg -a --export <PUBKEY> | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo apt-get update\n\nNote that when you import a key like this using apt-key you are telling the system that you trust the key you're importing to sign software your system will be using. Do not do this unless you're sure the key is really the key of the package distributor.\n\nA: It happens when you don't have a suitable public key for a repository.\nTo solve this problem use this command:\ngpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 9BDB3D89CE49EC21\n\nwhich retrieves the key from ubuntu key server. And then this:\ngpg --export --armor 9BDB3D89CE49EC21 | sudo apt-key add -\n\nwhich adds the key to apt trusted keys.\nThe solution can be found here & here & here.\n\nA: I faced the same issue while installing Heroku. The link below solved my problem - \nhttp://naveenubuntu.blogspot.in/2011/08/fixing-gpg-keys-in-ubuntu.html\nAfter fixing the NO_PUBKEY issue, the below issue remained\nW: GPG error: xhttp://toolbelt.heroku.com ./ Release: The following signatures were invalid: BADSIG C927EBE00F1B0520 Heroku Release Engineering <release@heroku.com>\n\nTo fix it I executed the following commands in terminal:  \nsudo -i  \napt-get clean  \ncd /var/lib/apt  \nmv lists lists.old  \nmkdir -p lists/partial  \napt-get clean  \napt-get update  \n\nSource - Link to solve it\n\nA: Make sure you have apt-transport-https installed:\ndpkg -s apt-transport-https > /dev/null || bash -c \"sudo apt-get update; \nsudo apt-get install apt-transport-https -y\" \n\nAdd repository:\ncurl https://repo.skype.com/data/SKYPE-GPG-KEY | sudo apt-key add - \necho \"deb [arch=amd64] https://repo.skype.com/deb stable main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/skype-stable.list \n\nInstall Skype for Linux:\nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get install skypeforlinux -y\n\nSource: https://community.skype.com/t5/Linux/Skype-for-Linux-Beta-signatures-couldn-t-be-verified-because-the/td-p/4645756\n\nA: More generally, the following method should work for every repository. First of all search, with eventual help of a search engine, for a text on the program provider's website looking like the following:\n-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.1 (GNU/Linux)\n[...]\n-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\n\nSuch a text is for example displayed on http://deb.opera.com. Copy the passage, paste it in an empty file that you create on your desktop. This results in the key file.\nThen continue with the importation of the key:\n\n\n*\n\n*Applications > Sofware Center\n\n*Edit > Sofware sources..., enter password\n\n*Authentication tab, click on 'Import Key File...'\n\n*Select the saved key file and click on 'Ok'.\n\n\nYou may now remove the previously created key file.\n\nA: This error can also occur when the apt list file by the PPA points to a local keyring, like\ndeb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/SOMETHING.gpg] https://download.something.org/something something/\n\nAnd while that file may exist on your system (possibly downloaded with a prior command), it may be unreadable due to missing permissions. I just fixed this kind of error by running \nchmod 644 /usr/share/keyrings/*\n\nafter having fetched the keyring file. The underlying issue was the usage of sudo when I already was root user. Really weird as all of this is root anyway and there was no access permission failure message anywhere... but that fixed it\n\nA: You need to get and import the key.\nTo get the key from a PPA, visit the PPA's Launchpad page. On every PPA page at Launchpad you will find this link (2), after clicking on 'Technical details about this PPA' (1):\n\nFollow it and click on the key ID link (3):\n\nSave the page, this is your key file.\n\nNow it's time to import it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Applications > Software Center,\n\n*Edit > Software sources...,\n\n*Enter your password,\n\n*Go to the Authentication tab and click on Import Key File..., finally\n\n*Select the saved key file and click on OK.\n\n\nA: By far the simplest way to handle this now is with Y-PPA-Manager (which now integrates the launchpad-getkeys script with a graphical interface).\n\n*\n\n*To install it, first add the webupd8 repository for this program:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/y-ppa-manager\n\n\n\n*Update your software list and install Y-PPA-Manager:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install y-ppa-manager\n\n\n\n*Run y-ppa-manager (i.e. type y-ppa-manager then press enter key).\n\n\n*When the main y-ppa-manager window appears, click on \"Advanced.\"\n\n\n*From the list of advanced tasks, select \"Try to import all missing GPG keys\" and click OK.\nYou're done! As the warning dialog says when you start the operation, it may take quite a while (about 2 minutes for me) depending on how many PPA's you have and the speed of your connection.\n\nA: note: As of recent versions, it is no longer considered good practice to add PPA keys to the keyring. However, I will leave this answer but apt-key is now deprecated so it is recommended we follow different methods for now.\napt can only handle 40 keys in /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d . 41 keys and you will get the GPG error \"no public key found\" even if you go through all the steps to add the missing key(s).\nCheck to see if there are any unused keys in this file from ppa(s) you no longer use. If all are in use, consider removing some ppa(s) along with the corresponding keyfiles in /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d\nFurthermore, using\nsudo apt-key adv\n\nIs considered a security risk and is not recommended as you are \"undermining the whole security concept as this is not a secure way of recieving keys for various reasons (like: hkp is a plaintext protocol, short and even long keyids can be forged, …)\". http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2195579\nI believe the correct way to add missing keys (for example 1ABC2D34EF56GH78) is\ngpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 1ABC2D34EF56GH78\ngpg --export --armor 1ABC2D34EF56GH78 | sudo apt-key add -\n\n\nA: Good! I finaly found the way!\nI've tested all method's to fix GPG error NO_PUBKEY and nothing working for me.\nI've deleted the entire contents of the folder /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d\ncd /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d\nsudo rm -R *\nsudo apt-get update\n\nAnd I use the Y-PPA-Manager method because I'm too lazy to create all pubkey's manually (too many): http://www.unixmen.com/fix-w-gpg-error-no_pubkey-ubuntu/\nrun sudo apt-get update again and finaly all work great now! Tanks!\nBased Source : post #17 on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/+bug/1263540\n\nA: There is a tiny script packaged in the WebUpd8 PPA which I'll link as a single .deb download so you don't have to add the whole PPA - which automatically imports all missing GPG keys.\nDownload and install Launchpad-getkeys (ignore the ~natty in its version, it works with all Ubuntu versions from Karmic all the way to Oneiric). Once installed, open a terminal and type:\nsudo launchpad-getkeys\n\nIf you're behind a proxy, things are a bit more complicated so see this for more info\n\nA: I had the same problem with DynDNS's Updater client.\nTurns out it was just expired keys.\nReinstalling the software (downloading a new .deb from the website, then using Software Centre to reinstall) fixed the problem.\nError message for reference:\nW: GPG error: http://cdn.dyn.com stable/ Release: The following signatures were invalid: KEYEXPIRED 141943.......\n\n\nA: 2021 August. This is what worked for me.\ncd /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d\nsudo rm -R *\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThe last line will raise errors of missing keys.\nWhat you'd then have to do is manually install each of the keys listed in the errors\nfor example if the error is saying that your missing PUB_KEY is 9BDB3D89CE49EC21,\nYou can manually add the Key with the command sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 9BDB3D89CE49EC21\nRe-run sudo apt-get update\nRepeat the process for the new key raised in the error\nSay if the new key was 3BDB3D89CE49EC24,\nJust Manually add the Key with the command sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 3BDB3D89CE49EC24\nRe-run sudo apt-get update and repeat the process until all the errors are gone.\nThen go back to the package site you were trying to install and repeat the installation process.\nFor my case, the error was coming while I tried installing Sublime Text\nDoing the above and returning to the Sublime installation guide here solved the issues.\nDon't forget to upvote if this works for you.

I sometimes want to use my computer as a DVD-player. Unfortunately I know that I will often have to cope with encrypted DVDs, for example with CSS.\nTherefore I installed the libdvdcss2 library from Medibuntu. But from now on, how can I be sure I will be able to read any DVD whatever its encryption, may it be CSS or another protection?\nBy the way, I precise that passing through such protective measures is allowed in my country, \"for interoperability purposes\".\n\nA: For legal reasons, DVD decryption is not provided by a standard Ubuntu installation\n\nHowever, you can install libdvdread4 which has a script that allows to install DVD decryption\n\nsudo apt-get install libdvdread4\n  sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh\n\nOR\nAdd the medibuntu apt repository\n\nsudo wget --output-document=/etc/apt/sources.list.d/medibuntu.list http://www.medibuntu.org/sources.list.d/$(lsb_release -cs).list && sudo apt-get --quiet update && sudo apt-get --yes --quiet --allow-unauthenticated install medibuntu-keyring && sudo apt-get --quiet update\n\nAnd directly install libdvdcss\n\nsudo apt-get install libdvdcss2\n\nBoth methods may not be legal in every country (as far as I know, it's not legal in USA, but it's legal in Germany)\nFor a completely legal way buy the Fluendo DVD Player as posted in fluteflutes answer\n\nA: One way to do this is using the Fluendo DVD Player available (for $24.95) in the Ubuntu Software Centre. This would ensure you can always play all DVDs as it is software supported by a company. \nNB: Purchasing this also has the side effect of protecting you from any legal issues.\nNB2: I'm sure someone else with more knowledge than me will be able to give you a 'free' solution.\n\n\nA: You can't be sure that you will be able to read every DVD.\nlibdvdcss2 will allow you to play, copy and rip DVDs encrypted with CSS (Content Scramble System). This is by far the most commonly used DRM on DVDs.\nHowever there are other methods which are much more nasty. The ones I have come across were where some sectors of the DVD were deliberately corrupted so that they couldn't be copied. For these I used ddrescue  which is a command line app similar to dd.\nThis program was designed for rescuing data from failing drives where there are accidental bad sectors. They can also be applied to get rid or the DVD DRM. If I remember rightly, this is the command:\nddrescue -d /dev/dvd ~/dvd_backup.iso ~/dvd_backup.log\n\nYou can then mount or burn the ISO file. \n\nA: Seems like you are using handbrake as I do. It can do a great job in DVD/ video transcoding. One thing that needs to put clear first is that HandBrake is defaulted to rip unprotected DVDs, it is unable to rip the DVDs with copy protection. And libdvdcss has been removed since the version of 1.0.2. The Handbrake team has answered the relevant question on its community forum: https://forum.handbrake.fr/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=35883&p=168507&hilit=libdvdcss#p168507\nBut if you still have to rip the DVDs with DRM, you may get some help there: http://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/handbrake-libdvdcss.html\n", "Q: My ISP imposes SMTP restrictions on outgoing mail, is it possible to configure a system wide SMTP address?
