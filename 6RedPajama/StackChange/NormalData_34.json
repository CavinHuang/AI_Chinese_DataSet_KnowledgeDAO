I have a late-2013 Retina MacBook Pro, and it gets really hot really easily. I've monitored the temp with htop and iStat and they both show the same readings. It's supposed to be able to play some pretty graphics intensive games, at least that's the impression I got. I tried playing Rust (very basic graphics for those unaware of the game) on medium settings, and my cpu temp was hovering around 100. I also tried playing Endless Legend, and my cpu temps were hovering around 100 before I even got into the game, just looking at the menu, in windowed mode, at 1280x800 resolution, with low graphics settings, with no other applications running. Is this normal? Is the game performance of the Retina MBP this bad usually or is mine unusually bad? Are these temperatures safe or will they decrease the life of my computer if sustained for a few hours at a time?\nEDIT : Check out the performance trying to play a game of chess here. You can see the CPU temp spike to over 100 degrees in seconds\n\n\nA: 100C (212F) is the thermal limit for the intel processor in your machine. The computer will shut itself down to prevent damage if necessary. This means a sustained and significant increase above that threshold. Not a spike. The temperatures you report are within normal operating temperatures based on the usage. Tips, moving forward:\n\n\n*\n\n*Keep your Firmware up to date.\n\n*Make sure the back vents are not covered or obstructed in any way. This ensures proper ventilation. \n\n*Don’t manually adjust the fan settings, or the like, using applications like “iStat Menus.\" The firmware in your machine is very good (better than you, or I, or any human being) at keeping the machine cool and dissipating the heat produced from CPU/GPU intensive processes. \n\n\nBottom Line: This is completely normal behavior and nothing to worry about. \n\nA: This recently happened to me, and I found the answer (It was in Apple's forums somewhere, I am searching for it and I will source it once I find it).\n\n\n*\n\n*Check your Activity Monitor, it is located in ~/Applications/Utilities/.\n\n*Under CPU, click the \"% CPU\" button and make sure the arrow next to it is pointing down.\n\n\nIf Safari is using most of your CPU, here is what you can do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Safari\n\n*Go to Safari Preferences (⌘+,)\n\n*Make sure both \"New windows open with\" and \"New tabs open with\" are not set to \"Top Sites\"\n\n\nIf you want to view your Top Sites after this\n\n\n*\n\n*Secondary click Safari's NavBar (where the Searchbar/URLbar is)\n\n*Click \"Customize Toolbar...\"\n\n*Drag \"Top Sites\" icon to where you want.\n\n\nA: It's because your computer have probably an APU (CPU and GPU on the same die). When you play a game, the CPU and the GPU are used, so it's more difficult to refresh them in only one die. \nThat change nothing to decrease graphics, because a frame is more easy to make, but in return the GPU make more frame. The only way to change this is to turn on the frame limiter if you have one.\nBut don't be afraid by the temp, the processor have a security for shutdown the computer if he is too hot. In my computer, I've the same problem. With iStat menu you can try to fix the fan at 100% for a better ventilation.\n\nA: My late 2013 suddenly became hot when charging. No problems previously. I reset the SMC (google it to find how it's done) and it cooled down within minutes. Phew - sorted!. Some posts refer to new machines and I have heard of this fix working on newer machines. Yeah you'd think it would be sorted on a new machine - but sometimes it's not or a glitch happens on setup. Good luck!\n", "Q: How do I restart iPad with broken power button and unresponsive screen? My iPad 4 running iOS 8.0.x suddenly stopped responding only when in apps.  On the home screen taps and gestures work fine.\nWhen I tap any app icon the app launches but doesn't respond to any touches or gestures.  This happens to both Apple apps (Settings, etc.) and third-party apps.\nThe iPad still responds to system gestures though, like four-finger pinch to go to the home screen.\nI'm guessing a restart will fix this, but the power button is broken and the iPad is on a full charge.  Is there any other way to force a restart?\n\nA: If you have AssistiveTouch enabled\nYou can use all the physical features on your device (volume control, on/off button, etc.)\nTap on the dot that appears on your screen. On the popup, tap \"Device\". Press and hold \"Lock Screen\", then slide to power off.\nDepending on what is causing your device's power button not to work, you may or may not be able to turn it on now in the traditional way by pressing and holding the power button. If that fails, connect your device using its USB cord either to a computer or to a wall socket, and it should turn on after several seconds.\nOnce the iPad turns on you can enable AssistiveTouch by going to Settings > General > Accessibility > AssistiveTouch (under \"Interaction\"), and swipe the switch to turn on AssistiveTouch.\nAssistiveTouch is an accessibility feature designed for people with limited movement capacities.  For more information about AssistiveTouch, see this Apple support article.\nIf AssistiveTouch is not enabled\nYou will just have to wait for the battery charge to run out.\n", "Q: Pinch to zoom broken in Yosemite I had pinch to zoom working fine after installing Yosemite but after a month or so it's stopped working. The setting is enabled in Trackpad > Scroll & Zoom and it seems none of those gestures are working anymore. I can use 4/5 fingers outwards for Expose though. \nHow can I get the full functionality back?\n\nA: Turn off pinch to zoom in preferences, then turn on again. This has worked for me before. If that doesn't work then doing a reboot will usually fix any and all trackpad issues. Problems after a reboot? Check out the above slightely more extreme ways around the problem..\n\nA: I tried to toggle Pinch to Zoom off and on in System preferences but it didn't fix the issue. So I put the MacBook to sleep, woke it up and then Pinch to Zoom started working again.\n\nA: If you have Ad Block installed..\nTurn off Ad Block in Safari's Extensions.. \nUncheck and then recheck Pinch to Zoom in Trackpad settings..\nTest.. If working now turn Ad Block back on.. and test again\nIt should now work as normal.\n\nA: Not for any of my 6 macs.

I do not realy like this iTunes syncronization, connect device with cabel, start iTunes, .. too complicate. Can I sync and play music via CloudDrive?\n\nA: No. Unless you use a specific third-party app that allows this (I don't know of any) then synchronisation of music from a computer to an iOS device with iCloud Drive is not possible. \nHowever, you may find that iTunes Wi-Fi syncing sufficiently solves the problem you describe of having to physically connect your iOS device to your computer in order to synchronise media. \n", "Q: Foolishly left old beta on my iPhone that has now expired, is my only option to restore and lose everything? I installed an iOS 8 beta on a test iPhone I have back in the summer, and forgot to keep it updated with more recent betas, and now it's not allowing me to get into it due to the beta being expired.\nIs my only option to be able to use it again to restore it from scratch and lose everything? Or is there some way to update it to the actual released version of iOS 8?\n\nA: Simply download the IPSW of the final build of iOS 8.1 from developer.apple.com, connect your device to iTunes, alt-click the Update button and select your IPSW.\nNo data will be lost and your device will be updated.\n\nA: My understanding is that you will have to restore the device, which will wipe the contents of the device. \nHowever, if you have a back up of the device's contents (either on iCloud or stored on your computer), it is a simple option in the device re-setup process to restore your device (now with the latest version of iOS) to this backup, thus allowing you to regain access to your data. \n", "Q: Updated to OS X Yosemite, everything has deleted So I've already tried to find a solution on Google, but I'm not really good at following some broad IT instructions. \nIf you guys could help, that's be more than awesome!\nAfter I installed OS X Yosemite, all my stuff was gone! \nIt's like a whole new Mac! \nMeanwhile, I have figured out that my usual stuff is still stored somehow on my Mac, but I don't know how to get it back to being my regular account. \nIf I go to Finder > Macintosh HD > Users, there's a folder with all my stuff in my regular account.\nAny assistance would be truly appreciated!\n\nA: Since you can see your \"stuff\" it is still there but under another user.\nSomehow you made a mistake and created a brand new User account with nothing in it so now you have 2 users on your computer each with they separate folders and files.\nWhat you need to do is to log out of that user account (go to Apple icon top left and select log out).\nNow you can log in in to your other user account. \n", "Q: Strange message in console about _DirtyJetsamMemoryLimit key This message is always displayed in the console log at regular intervals.\ncom.apple.xpc.launched: (comm.apple.imFoundation.IMRemoteURLConnectionAgent) the _DirtyJetsamMemoryLimit key is not available in this platform\n\nCan anyone explain why it's displayed and if it has any impact on system performance, as well as how to get rid of it?\n\nA: It's harmless. Jetsam is a system that monitors memory use in OSX and iOS. It keeps a list of processes on the device, to monitor for situations where a device is running out of free RAM and look for things to kill to free up RAM. It also watches for processes that are using too much RAM; breaching a \"high water mark\" level.\nThis error message is because the code is shared between OSX and iOS but the _DirtyJetsamMemoryLimit key is only available on iOS.\nYou can read more about Jetsam at the following link.\nhttp://newosxbook.com/articles/MemoryPressure.html\nAnd if you are really interested you can read some of the Jetsam code in the following two files.\nhttp://www.opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-1456.1.26/bsd/kern/kern_memorystatus.c\nhttp://www.opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-1456.1.26/bsd/sys/kern_memorystatus.h\nLong story short, I don't think this error message necessarily indicates a performance problem. The memory system on iOS is a lot more strict because iOS doesn't have things like swapfiles that allow the system to exceed the physical amount of RAM. OSX has a lot more room to play in.\nAnyone can verify that it has no impact on performance by using Activity Monitor and showing all processes in the CPU view. Look at the syslogd line and make sure the CPU time is reasonable compared to other tasks you wish to perform with your Mac.\n", "Q: How to hide specific shares in the sidebar from Finder?

And now it should work. Let  me know if it doesn't.\n\nA: I think that the problem is because when I first installed Scilab I hadn't already updated my Mac to the Yosemite version. Therefore I had installed Scilab not for the Yosemite version, but for the previous one. \nWhat made me think this was that in the official website of Scilab it's written that for Yosemite versions, we should install this Scilab 5.5.1 - Mac OS X 10.10\n148.82 MB version, and probably I had not installed it.\n", "Q: What's wrong with the Weather widget on OS X 10.10 Yosemite?

I want to automate repetitive actions for a game on my (jailbroken) iPhone 4. I hesitate to mention the name of the game in case you would be abetting me in violation of its Terms of Service (ToS) by automation, but its player-base recommends replaying the tutorial to reroll an early game RNG element. The tutorial is easy but time-consuming, making it a prime target for automation. I stumbled across AutoTouch in the Cydia store, but it requires purchasing a license to run scripts for longer than a minute or some-length and I am skeptical of its performance. So, is there an (preferably cheaper) alternative to touch-automation than AutoTouch?\n\nA: I don't think there are any other option (cheaper) that I've heard of.  Most of the unique tweaks in the jailbreak world are always priced high.\nYou should probably tweet to the developer @KentKrantz\nand ask him about AutoTouch performance on iPhone 4 running iOS7 or maybe ask him for a trial license after which if you're interested you could buy the full license for $5 which doesn't seem a lot.\n\nA: As of this writing (31/08/2021), a lot has changed.\nAutoTouch\nLicensing / Cost\nAutoTouch used to have a one-time license fee, but now has a subscription model which can be viewed on https://license.autotouch.net/ and is as follows:\n\nNote that the key difference between iOS Basic and Pro is the availability of JSBridge in the latter, which is described as follows:\n\nWhat is JSBridge?\nJSBridge is a mechanism implemented the ability to call classes, methods, variables of Objective-C from JavaScript.\n\nMy experience\nI have had quite a good experience with AutoTouch (the last time I used it was with iOS 10).\nTo put it in perspective, I know of very few tweaks that cost around the USD 10.00 mark (IntelliscreenX, PwnTunes, and PKGBackup come to mind). However, nowadays there are devs who only make their tweaks available on a subscription model (via Patreon), so the subscription model is no longer unique in the world of Jailbreak Tweaks.\nIn the yester-years (iOS 10), AutoTouch only supported Lua as the scripting language, however since v7.0.0. it also supports Javascript (See this), which should make it immediately useful for more devs, if I dare say so.\nOverall, Autotouch has been around for many years ( since iOS8 atleast), and has seen continuous support and improvements. During this time, other contenders have come and gone only to end up abandoned.\ntl;dr: Is it worth the money?\nBased on my experience, YES ...

ZXTouch looks very promising indeed but remains to be seen if it is supported after iOS 14 or if it will join the ranks of abandonware. For instance, there are already signs of trouble for ZXTouch, see https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/p1edwp/discussion_what_happened_to_zxtouch/\n", "Q: How to only include certain Podcasts on the iPhone with the Podcasts app I subscribe to several podcasts, but only want a small few to be downloaded to my phone. It does not appear to be possible to specify which podcasts the Podcasts app should be downloading and which ones it shouldn't. If this is possible, I would like to know how.\n\nA: EDIT: With more recent iOS updates, this technique is no longer as useful. Playlists are useful to control whether an episode is sync'ed to the device. If a podcast is in a playlist, and that playlist is selected to sync to the iOS device, then all the podcasts in that playlist will be transferred to the device. \nWhat no longer works is being able to create a playlist in iTunes and then play that playlist on an iOS device. There is only a single Up Next playlist available, and you have to manage it on each device.\nORIGINAL: I use Podcasts on my MacBook Pro, my iPhone 5 and my iPad Air 2. The only thing that I have found to work is this setup.\nAll my downloads of new episodes, etc. are done on the MacBook Pro. I basically leave iTunes running most of the time even when I am away and only have my portable devices with me.\nI use Playlists on the MacBook pro iTunes to sort episodes for which device. Video podcasts primarily go to the iPad and audio primarily to the phone, but when flying I often put audio podcasts on the iPad to save battery life on the phone.\nThen in iTunes I connect each device and use the settings for the device to control which podcasts and which playlists are synced to the device. I generally only sync checked files and I uncheck episodes after they are played.\nAlso in iTunes on the MacBook Pro I have smart playlists for recently played and recently added and I use those to help me find the newer Podcast episodes quickly and to uncheck played episodes quickly.\nThis is admittedly a lot of work. I spend a couple hours or more each week managing my playlists. I sync nearly every day to add new episodes and clean up old episodes. I just could never make the \"automatic\" sync'ing work the way I wanted, so I decided to take control of it with these techniques.\nFinal Note: in iTunes Preferences on the Store tab, I turn off Sync Podcast subscriptions and settings. I have found there is a bug in this process that sometimes causes iTunes to stop downloading any podcasts. There was some discussion on the Apple Support Forums that pointed me to this change.\n\nA: Assuming you use the most recent podcast app, there is a settings page for each podcast you subscribe to. You can get to it a number of ways, but I would by going \"My Podcasts>[podcast A]>*tap the album art*>Settings\" There it gives you a number of options about what to download, how often to refresh and if autodelete should happen.\nhttp://youtu.be/7siab_ymF6w\n", "Q: Time Machine: Local Snapshots and Backup while on Battery I like the idea of local Snapshots for having the possibility to restore accidentally deleted or changed files. My question is, when unchecking \"Backup while on Battery Power\" is Time Machine still creating those Snapshots?\n\nA: The purpose of the switch \"Backup while on Battery Power\" is for you to choose if to continue the time machine backup while on battery or NOT.\nThe reason is to allow you to preserve battery power by unchecking it, but it will no longer create Snapshots.\n", "Q: Yosemite and photos I upgraded my mac to Yosemite and now I can't find my photos or video folder.

Both are free but cfgutil is much more powerful and can do things like remove apps, erase, pair, and even run scripts when you attach and detach iOS devices to your Mac.\nTo make cfgutil available at the command line, open Configurator 2, and choose Configurator 2 -> Install Automation Tools ... from the menu.\nYou could also look at homebrew and install libimobiledevice - that is open source and free as well and seems to be kept updated fairly well over time.\nbrew install libimobiledevice\n\n\nA: With iTools 3.1.9.8 (available for Mac & Windows) you can get logs from your iOS device by selecting Toolbox and Real-time Log:\n\n\nA: I'm using libimobiledevice(link).\nThis is a cross-platform software protocol library and tools to communicate with iOS® devices natively.\nOnce these are installed, you can plug in a paired device, unlock it and use the following command to view the logs on the screen: idevicesyslog\nThis is akin to running a tail against the device. Again, the device must be paired. You can use the command line (e.g. if you’re running this on Linux) to view the logs, but if you’re not paired you’ll need to pair your device: idevicepair pair \nYou can also unpair: idevicepair unpair\nWhen pairing and unpairing, you should see the appropriate entries in /var/db/lockdown.\n\nA: There's also an app called \"iOS Console,\" but it requires iOS 9.\n", "Q: iOS reminders app not syncing with Yosemite I was working in the reminders app last night and noticed that it failed to sync across all my devices, which run the latest version of OS X and iOS.

From the research I just did, it seems that I had to upgrade to Yosemity using a different drive!? Where as I added Yosemity into the main drive. Am I right in thinking that I now can  only downgrade by reformatting the hard drive (loosing my data and so forth)?\nApparently I'd be able to reinstall Mavericks via the internet holding command-option-r. Does this mean I don't need to have a copy of the Mavericks installer? And since I am re-formating the main drive, would this method still work. \nBasically, apart from losing my data, and the hours it will take, is there a chance that I format the main drive and something going wrong and ending up without an operating system?\n\nA: As of today there is no known way to downgrade from Yosemite to Mavericks without erasing the drive.\nBooting to the internet recovery mode altcmdR means that you boot to a netboot image containing a basic system downloaded from Apple/Akamai. You don't need the Mavericks installer. If you reinstall a system the system originally shipped  with your Mac will be loaded.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot process (takes 2 minutes connected to a 50 MBps-line):  \n \n\n*Boot process finished:  \n \nTranslation:\nFestplattendienstprogramm: Disk Utility\nOS X erneut installieren: Reinstall OS X\n\n*Starting Disk Utility looks like this:  \n \nNow you just have to repartition your Macintosh HD: 1 Partition & GUID partition table (available via Options)\nIf you stuck here unable to partition your drive because it's forbidden or greyed out, your Macintosh HD was probably converted to a CoreStorage Volume Group. Please check and execute the steps 10-12 of my answer to this question. Afterwards you have to start Disk Utility again and partition the drive to your needs.\nBTW: SystemUSB is an attached thumb drive with a bootable system and disk2 (OS X Base System) is the netboot image you downloaded and booted to earlier in step 1.\n\n*Quit Disk Utility to get to the menu again (picture 2)\n\n*Start Reinstall OS X. Now probably Lion is downloaded to your newly created hard disk partition and installed there afterwards.\nIf you get a message like 'Could not find installation information for this machine' just restart your Mac to the internet recovery mode. (The netboot image seems to be very picky with the WLAN connection and it took me two attempts to get around this step)\n\n\nIf you choose the recovery mode cmdR the latest system will be installed. You need a working Recovery HD-volume though. Such volume won't exist on a brand new hdd.\nIn both cases a stable and fast internet connection will be convenient.\nUsing the internet recovery mode you won't end up with an 'unbootable' system (depending on the reliability of your internet connection) because your (maybe falsely partioned) hdd is never involved in the (net)boot process.\nIn your case (MacBook Pro early 2011) i would download 'Mavericks' with your App Store account, create a 'Mavericks Installer' thumb drive, boot to it and continue with step 2 outlined above. It's just faster and more reliable than first downloading and installing Lion and then Mavericks.\n", "Q: Setting environment variables for scripts run by launchd? I have a script that worked in the past, but seems to be having issues now (I believe it's due to Yosemite). What I had done was created an environment variable that was set to \"false\" and then my script would set it to \"true\" so that if the script took too long and started again before it finished it would not attempt to run again concurrently. However, it doesn't work anymore. \nI set the variable initially with /etc/launchd.conf\nsetenv autoBackupImagesInProgress false\n\nAnd the part of my script that doesn't work anymore is\n#Ensure that this script isn't already running\nif [ -z \"$autoBackupImagesInProgress\" ] ; then\n   #Concurrency variable was not setup so this will not work;\n   #edit .bashrc or .profile to include export autoBackupImagesInProgress=false\n   #should be /etc/launchd.conf\n   print \"WARNING: Concurrency protection unavailable\"\nelif [ $autoBackupImagesInProgress = true ] ; then\n   #Another process has already started this, but has not yet finished\n   print \"WARNING: Already in progress; aborting.\"\n   exit 0;\nfi\n\nThis works if I initiate the script from the terminal or Spotlight, but not when this is started with launchd. When run from launchd this will always print the first warning and never hits the elif. \n\nA: Open your Script Editor(Launch Pad -> Other -> Script Editor) \nType scripts like this:\ndo shell script \"launchctl setenv autoBackupImagesInProgress false\"\n\nUse multiple lines if you want to set multiple variables.\nSave this script as Application, open SystemPreferences → Users & Groups → your user → Login Items and add your saved script.\nTo apply changes, logout your account and log in again.\n", "Q: Verifying emergency decryption code I encrypted my computer with FileVault full disk encryption on Yosemite. FileVault gave me an emergency decryption code to use when I forgot my password.\nFor some reason, when I changed my account password while the drive was being encrypted it gave me another emergency code.

International SMS will be set up, but I have iMessage linked to this mobile number. I have other iPhones, iPads and Macs which also receive iMessages on this account.\nDo I have to disable iMessage on all my devices before I travel to ensure when people send a message to my mobile number, I will receive it as an International SMS?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Simple answer, yes.\nIf you want SMS to arrive at your phone there must be no other device left active that can possibly pick up the iMessage.  \nOtherwise Apple considers that if any device received the iMessage, it is considered delivered & will not try again as SMS.\nRelated question - How to tell Messages \"I'm not at home\"? which remains unanswered, despite the great efforts of one member; but shows promise for Yosemite, if not Mavericks.\n\nA: When there is not any internet connection SMS messages should be delivered to your phones, so you should not need to disable iMessage anywhere. However just to be on the safe side, I would recommend you to disable it. It would be a fail proof way to feel safe about SMS/iMessage mystery.\nIf you use only your phone number as your iMessage account you can just disable it in all your devices to be sure that you will get all SMS messages. \nIf you have any e-mail address associated with your iMessage account, you can just remove your phone number from iMessage accounts in your devices and keep your e-mails. That way you can still receive iMessage, whenever internet connection is available.\n", "Q: Privacy Pane wont let me add a preference pane to control my computer I have a 2010 Macbook Pro 15 inch and i just upgraded to yosemite with a fresh install (no data on any hard drives).

Is there any bypass for this? Please Help\n\nA: In theory, the answer is no. Activation Lock is designed to make bypassing it impossible.\nHowever, this page claims to be able to bypass activation lock using some questionable mojo.

Testing near the 3rd Floor time Capsule I get download speeds of 35 - 55mb.\nNear my chromecast enabled television on the first floor, with the extender Time Capsule either on the second floor or first floor, I used to get download speeds of 5 - 15 mb, good enough for Netflix.\nSuddenly, I'm getting download speeds by the television of 0.02 mb.\nIt I turn off the extending Time Capsule, so the whole house has to rely on the one base station Time Capsule on the third floor, I get rates of .8mb - 4mb on the first floor near the TV, not usually enough to reliably use Netflix.\nIn the first floor kitchen, which is two floors below, but directly under, the base station Time Capsule, I get 15mb - 35mb download speed. But I don't need Netflix in the kitchen!\nIs the extender Time Capsule just broken?Can it be fixed? Is it worth fixing?If I replace do I have to use an Apple product like the Airport Express, or will any wireless router work?\n\nA: It sounds like the Time Capsule isn't functioning properly. It may be worth scheduling a free appt at the Apple Genius Bar. They can tell you if there is a recall or if by some chance the repair/replacement is covered under warranty. Perhaps it needs a firmware upgrade? You can check in the Airport Utility on a Mac or iOS device. More info here on Apple's website.\nOne more thing to consider... Since you are getting decently fast speeds in one location, but not in another, is it possible that there could be something interfering? Oftentimes a refrigerator, microwave, metal paneling in a wall, etc. can disrupt the WiFi signal—although I would expect the connection to be intermittent and fairly slow.\nYou may consider switching the two Time Capsules to see if the same issues occur with the other one as well. This can at least isolate it to either being a defective Time Capsule, or some other environmental element. It could also be a defect with the Chromecast. Is that possible?\nAren't wireless issues fun?? :) so many possibilities!\nMost name brand wireless routers can work as an extender of an existing network. So, no, it definitely doesn't have to be an Apple product. However, make sure all extenders are in \"bridge mode\" so that they truly do act as an extender and aren't trying to create their own subnets. If you do get another router, it will not be in bridge mode out-of-box. You'll need to configure that using the router manufacturer's documentation.\n", "Q: Highly abnormal graphic glitch on yosemite / retina: all white backgrounds appear pink Suddenly, all white and transparent image backgrounds appear pink for me (but only on images, not on anything else that's renderered).\nFor example, the SE searchbar looks like this:\n\nOr the latest email from amazon:\n\nOr the tag:\n\nThe problem does only occur on HiDPI resolutions.

Leave all options as they are, but change the bottom one, MTU, from Standard (1500) to Custom and in the field that shows up below type 1400.\nAccept all changes and see if you have any more success while browsing.\nTest using ping in Terminal\nA more definitive test you can do is in the Terminal.app and using the ping command.\nIf the website that gives you trouble has a URL http://www.troublesomewebsite.com/, you can do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Ping the website by typing: ping www.troublesomewebsite.com. If you get responses, proceed to the next point below; if not, replace the www.troublesomewebsite.com with an address of another website you're having issues with and repeat.\n\n*When you find a site that does respond, type the following command and see if you get responses: ping -s 1472 -D www.troublesomewebsite.com. If you DO get responses, then it's NOT a Path MTU Discovery issue.\n\n*If you DON'T get responses, decrease the number 1472 to say 1464 and run the command again, like so: ping -s 1464 -D www.troublesomewebsite.com. Keep doing that until you start getting responses. Most likely, if this IS the PMTUd problem, you should get responses again with the packet size set to somewhere between 1464-1456 bytes. Add 28 to the number at which you start getting the responses and that's the MTU you can set on your computer to work around your issue.\n\nBackground Information\nPath MTU discovery is a mechanism that manifests itself by frequent and seemingly intermittent timeouts when browsing some websites but not others. This has to do with misconfigured firewall rules on the website side, which prevent ICMP traffic to go through, specifically the ICMP unreachable message. That in turn breaks the pmtud behaviour, which is how most of the TCP/IP stacks have been working for at least the last 20 years or so.\nThe MTU becomes an issue especially if your broadband connection uses DSL - in such case, there is an extra 8 bytes of PPP header that need to be used, and if the Service Provider didn't configure their links to use larger frames, this results in a smaller payload available to your packets - hence the need to decrease the MTU on your computer.\nMore information available in RFC1191 and this Wikipedia Article\n", "Q: Iphone ringing when husband receives a call Why is my phone ringing when someone calls my husbands phone?

In Vim, Ctrl W, by default, sets you up for a window command (e.g., Ctrl Wh moves to the window on the left, etc.)\nI am new to using a Mac and haven't got completely used to the Command key, yet. As such, I am regularly closing my terminal session accidentally. (Fortunately, I'm running tmux, so my session is preserved, but it's nonetheless getting pretty annoying!)\nIs there a way to change keyboard shortcuts in iTerm2? I realise it's probably unlikely and easier to change the Vim keybindings, but I don't want to change what I'm used to.\n\nA: Just tested this in Yosemite. If you re-map the keyboard shortcut for \"Close\" in the System > Keyboard > Shortcuts, then that changes the ⌘+W behavior.\nSee:\n\n\n", "Q: How do I use the defaults command with App Groups? In OS X Yosemite it's possible to have preferences that are shared between multiple apps that are in the same App Group. On the development side of things it's as simple as setting up the App Group and then using [[NSUserDefaults alloc] initWithSuiteName:@\"TEAMID.com.company.AppGroup\"] instead of the usual [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]. These preferences get stored in ~/Library/Group\\ Containers/TEAMID.com.company.AppGroup/Library/Preferences/TEAMID.com.company.AppGroup.plist.\nWhat I'm trying to figure out is how to modify those preferences from outside of the app using the defaults command. So far the best I've found is this:\ndefaults write ~/Library/Group\\ Containers/TEAMID.com.company.AppGroup/Library/Preferences/TEAMID.com.company.AppGroup PreferenceName -bool YES\nThis sort of works in that it modifies the correct .plist file and updates the preferences I tell it to. But it doesn't seem to be compatible with the caching that's used in Yosemite. As soon as the app tries to read the same preference, it reverts back to what was set previously.\nIs there any way to make this work reliably?\n\nA: As far as I've been able to determine there's still no proper way to do this. However, you can make it work by killing cfprefsd after using the above command. So I just use something like this in the Terminal app:\ndefaults write ~/Library/Group\\ Containers/TEAMID.com.company.AppGroup/Library/Preferences/TEAMID.com.company.AppGroup PreferenceName -bool YES; killall cfprefsd\nNot great, but better than nothing.\nUpdate for macOS Sierra (10.12): Unfortunately using the file path doesn't seem to work anymore. Strangely it works on files that are elsewhere—like if I copy an App Group plist to the desktop—but I can't get it to work right on an App Group plist in its normal location.\nIt's worth noting that man defaults has included this note for a while:\n\nThe defaults command will be changed in an upcoming major release to only operate on preferences domains. General plist manipulation utilities will be folded into a different command-line program.\n\nLike I said though, this isn't an issue with arbitrary plists, it seems specific to plists in ~/Library/Group Containers/.\n", "Q: Can I use OS X Notes app from 10.9+ on 10.8 I recently read a question which explained that the ability to search Notes was introduced in OSX 10.9 and above.

If so, what is the recommended setup to have a working dual screen setup with the mac mini? Would I need to get two of these adaptors and plug one each into the two Thunderbolt ports that my mac mini has? Seems a bit overkill if you can't utilise more than one port on an adaptor at once.\nYour advice or recommendations greatly appreciated.\n\nA: The general answer is your Mac Mini 2014 has two Thunderbolt 2 ports so your best bet is to drive one monitor from HDMI and the other from Thunderbolt so that you have another Thunderbolt port free for storage or networking.\n\nOut of the box, fully supported by Apple is either two displays via Thunderbolt (and they can chain if one of the display is actually Thunderbolt and not DP or another adapter) or one display via Thunderbolt and the other via HDMI.\nSee http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT5219#18\n\nMacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012), MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late\n  2012), and Mac Mini (Late 2012 and later) computers can use an\n  HDMI-compatible device on it's HDMI port while using one Thunderbolt\n  display, or they can use two Thunderbolt displays.\n\nIf you can't or don't want to use Thunderbolt or HDMI, you could avail yourself of USB adapters. The part you listed looks like it will connect to a Thunderbolt port and end that chain and be seen by OS X as one display no matter which of the older ports you connect to one (or more) displays.\n\nA: You connect two monitors to a Mac Mini via two separate ports; one monitor for one port.\nIt sounds like with both your monitors you'd like to connect via VGA. So then you'd need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Thunderbolt Mini display port to VGA adapter.\n\n*HDMI to VGA adapter.\n\n\nA: http://www.matrox.com/graphics/en/products/gxm/dh2go/digital_me/\nSomething like this should work. Seeing how thunderbolt can support display port connections this would allow you to use multiple monitors while only using one port.\n", "Q: How can I restore the legacy metadata editor in iTunes 12?

Second, unable to boot to Mac OS X and thus unable to start Boot-Camp Assistant how may I uninstall Windows?\n\nA: I did something similar and ended up incidentally tweaking the partition table from inside of windows. Because of that it wrecked the EFI and GUID and nearly bricked me completely I thought. Start the computer and hit command-r and you should be able to tell where to go from there. I have to warn you though its probably going to involve wiping one or both partitions.

I'd like to be able to dismiss and open macOS Notification Center notifications with the keyboard.\n(I'm not talking about opening/closing the Notification Center itself.)\nIs this possible in some manner with a tool or setting or other software?\n\nA: You can create Automator service to run this Applescript and give it a keyboard shortcut in the System Preferences Keyboard shortcuts\nThis will close Alert and banners Notification\n\nIn Automator choose a new service\n\n\nAdd a Run Applescript Action \n\n\nand replace it's code with:\nmy closeNotif()\non closeNotif()\n\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell process \"Notification Center\"\n            set theWindows to every window\n            repeat with i from 1 to number of items in theWindows\n                set this_item to item i of theWindows\n                try\n                    click button 1 of this_item\n                on error\n\n                    my closeNotif()\n                end try\n            end repeat\n        end tell\n    end tell\n\nend closeNotif\n\n\nSet the 'Service receives [no input] in [any application]'\nSave the service.\n\nOpen the Keyboard shortcuts in System prefs and set your for your service under 'Services'\n\nNow any newly launched app will pick the shortcut up.\n(Note: I structured the script to counter throwing an error that will occur when the notifications/windows start to close.\notifications/window are numbered 1 through to the total count. But as they close the script would still be working of the old count. \nBut the system will be re assigning the index of the windows.\nSo where we say start at 1 -6 the script will try and close window 1, window 2, window 3 and so on. But the system has re assigned the window numbers 1,2,3 to the last remaining windows. But the script will try and close window 4 and throw an error because it does not exist.

Temporarily disable Notification Center in Mountain Lion from command line?\n\nA: The original script by markhunte works but stops after a few windows. It may be that the list of windows only includes the ones that are currently visible. When you have too many this won't close all. I added a loop outside the main loop to query the windows until we get a window count of zero. Here is the code:\nmy closeNotif()\non closeNotif()\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Notification Center\"\n        set theWindows to every window\n        set nWindows to number of items in theWindows\n        repeat until nWindows is 0\n            repeat with i from 1 to number of items in theWindows\n                set this_item to item i of theWindows\n                try\n                    click button 1 of this_item\n                    delay 0.2\n                on error\n\n                    my closeNotif()\n                end try\n            end repeat\n            set theWindows to every window\n            set nWindows to number of items in theWindows\n        end repeat\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nend closeNotif\n\nA: Closing all notification (alert/banner)\nSimilar to the answer by markhunte in that a bit of AppleScript is used, but the implementation is vastly improved.\nNamely, unlike the script by markhunte, closes also banner notifications, doesn't crash when a notification doesn't have a close button, works even when notification center is open, works with notifications where the close button isn't the first button, detects stuck notifications, and so on...\nUsing an Alfred workflow\nIf you use Alfred, you have this workflow available: Notification dismisser. It will close all the currently displayed notifications with a shortcut or Alfred keyword. Super simple to use and works as expected.\nWithout using Alfred\nIf you don't use Alfred, you can take the main script from the workflow and (same as the answer by markhunte) using Automator save it as a \"Quick Action\". Then set a keyboard shortcut for it in System Preferences. Does the same as the workflow, albeit requires a bit more effort than clicking \"install\" as with Alfred.\n\nA: An indirect approach is in System Preferences > Notifications, to set the alert style to Banners. The alerts will show briefly and then dismiss themselves. To see the alerts again using the keyboard, press Fn-N to show the Notification Center.\n(If using a keyboard without a Fn key, you can assign a shortcut from System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Mission Control > Show Notification Center.)\n", "Q: Imac not start, wirless keyboard reset I have a problem with an IMAC 27'\n1: the osx was corupt so it wasn't boot anymore.\n2: i changed the batery from the keyboard so, i canot use the keyboard for startup key combination to reinstal the operating sistem\nAll i want to do is to reinstal the operating sistem (i have the original cd) but i can not do anything. any command i try to do on startup, dosn't work because the keyboard was reset (i think).

I recently had a problem with the Macintosh HD that could not be repaired using the disk utility so I erased the disk (using disk utility) then restored from time machine (most recent backup)\nDoes this result in the HDD being reformatted or could any potentially bad disk areas be reused inadvertently?\n\nA: Klanomath's procedures are 100% correct if it's a hard drive.\nI use a tool named Scannerz to evaluate drives and it's extremely conservative. If you find bad blocks their procedures are pretty much exactly what Klanomath described, except it will be quite evident how extensive the damage is during testing. SMART technology only finds bad sectors if a write attempt to them has been made and fails. If there's a lot of damage on the drive and it's never been used because it's in free space, SMART will never know about it but Scannerz will pick it up. Zeroing the drive as described will force sector reallocation, and if the supply of spares is exhausted, the operation will fail.\nIf it's a manufacturing oddity that yielded a few bad blocks, the drive can be recovered by reformatting as Klanomath described. If it's extensive, you could probably partition the bad areas out but that's a risk I wouldn't take. I know some people have done it with success, but you end up with a drive with multiple volumes where one likely existed before.\nAs far as SSDs go, ideally their drive management software is supposed to pull bad blocks when they're encountered during a write operation. Unfortunately, an SSD, like an HD can develop an odd block here or there that just fails while it's holding data. The problem here is a dilemma, because the people responsible for writing that code must ask themselves whether or not they should just yank a block right out of the middle of an existing file and replace it with a blank, or should they leave it in place, and let the user try to recover what they can from it. This problem is rare, but it can happen.\nIn any case, typically there are trim and garbage collection routines that an SSD uses that will (hopefully) automatically pull the bad blocks and correct them after a failed write operation. On some SSDs, these may occur while the system is in use, on others they may occur when there's a quiet time of a few minutes.\nSteer clear of any tool that tells you it's going to take a bad sector and \"repair\" it. There's no such thing. That's a dishonest marketing trick that has it's roots back in the 1980's when drives were using MFM and developers could actually gain access to the drive directly, and even then, it was at best only sort of possible to do it. Those days disappeared with IDE when the controller was put right on the HD.  Scannerz, for example, has an option to re-map sectors, but a warning will flash up telling you not to do it and that any information in the bad block is already basically dead, and the manual has a warning about a page and a half long, once again, basically telling you not to kid yourself.\n\nA: According to wikipedia 3 levels of formatting are common:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Low-level formatting (i.e., closest to the hardware) marks the surfaces     of the disks with markers indicating the start of a recording block (typically today called sector markers) and other information like block CRC to be used later, in normal operations, by the disk controller to read or write data. This is intended to be the permanent foundation of the disk, and is often completed at the factory.  \n\n*Partitioning divides a disk into one or more regions, writing data structures to the disk to indicate the beginning and end of the regions. This level of formatting often includes checking for defective tracks or defective sectors.  \n\n*High-level formatting creates the file system format within a disk partition or a logical volume. This formatting includes the data structures used by the OS to identify the logical drive or partition's contents. This may occur during operating system installation, or when adding a new disk. Disk and distributed file system may specify an optional boot block, and/or various volume and directory information for the operating system.\n\n\nProblems with your disk may occur through physical (bad blocks) or non-physical reasons (bogus b-trees etc.).\nQuick Erase or repartitioning will only rebuild the necessary metadata like Volume Header Attribute File etc. from scratch and doesn't map out bad blocks. It's just a high level formatting or a combination of partitioning (without error checking) and high level formatting.\nAny other type of erase (1-pass zeros/3-pass/7-pass with read/write operations [valid at least for Mac OS X 10.6-10.10]) will map out bad blocks if sufficient reserve blocks are available. Usually the 1-pass-zeros is enough and doesn't stress the hdd as hard as the other methods.\nThis method is sometimes referred as Mid-level formatting because it's neither a full Low-level formatting nor a full Partitioning.\nYou may verify the number of bad blocks afterwards with any SMART utility.\nIf more than 5 bad blocks are detected get a new disk. Sooner or later it will fail.\nThe above-mentioned is not necessarily valid for SSDs. Do not full erase (especially 3-pass/7-pass) if there 's no unavoidable necessity.\nA SSD has its own bad block management and wear leveling.\n\nA: Plus 1's for everyone as far as I'm concerned. A good question and two good answers.\nI'd like, however, to emphasize the following quote from Bob O:\n\nSteer clear of any tool that tells you it's going to take a bad sector and \"repair\" it. There's no such thing. That's a dishonest marketing trick that has it's roots back in the 1980's when drives were using MFM and developers could actually gain access to the drive directly, and even then, it was at best only sort of possible to do it.

Any application that tells you it's going to turn a failed sector into a working sector without this type of equipment is flat out lying.\nAs far as S.M.A.R.T. monitoring goes, there's free download called \"smartmontools\" that you can get from the web. There are a few applications out there that basically, as far as I'm concerned, steal the work of the \"smartmontools\" people, put a GUI front end on it, and then sell it. They don't make it clear that it's a free tool, and they often don't even keep it up to date. Typically they store the binary in the application's folder under Contents->Resources and it will have the name \"smartctl\". You can check the version by navigating to that folder and typing \"smartctl -v\" and it will tell you which version they're using. Odds are, it's at least 6 months or more old.\nYou can get the real smartmontools at the following link:\nhttp://www.smartmontools.org\nIt's a command line application, but it's at least as up to date as you can get.\nIs S.M.A.R.T. a good testing concept ? Well, yes and no. The unfortunate thing about it is it will only recognize problems after the fact. It's sort of like a weather man that shows up to your house after a severe wind storm did damage and announces that a severe wind storm just did some damage. The thresholds are too lenient and often won't predict drive damage properly. Scannerz measures timing artifacts via relative performance indices, and based on a post I read recently in Ars Technica, apparently it's picking up more than S.M.A.R.T. is. \nA word of warning about Scannerz: They say to stop all other user programs running other than their own, and they mean it. You can't start a scan on a drive and then start simultaneously download and watch a video or a news show or whatever. It will catch every little timing oddity and report it as an error. I suppose a super high speed system like the new Mac Pro's may not be that influenced by that, but my poor little systems will! I'm not that rich!\n", "Q: How to delete events on iPad Calendar.app I have been able to add events on my iPad calendar but I don't see how I can delete an event.\n\nA: *\n\n*Launch Calendar.\n\n*Tap on the event you would like to delete.\n\n*Tap on Edit in the upper right hand corner.\n\n*Tap on Delete Event at the bottom.\n\n*Tap on Delete Event once again once it pops up to confirm that you\nwant to delete that event.\n\n", "Q: Play iTunes play next I have several songs in the Play Next queue.\nI am not playing anything at the moment.

In which they recommend avoiding .local if you can and instead using a suffix such as .private, .intranet, .internal, or .lan.\nThe reason .local should be avoided is because it's used by the Bonjour service.\n\nShort Answer\nAdd the following Search Domain as in the screenshot (you can disregard my DNS Server settings):\n\n\nLong Answer\nAnother possibility is documented here in an article about using Dnsmasq for local development on OS X and a related StackOverflow question in which someone seems to have found it successful except when their offline (which doesn't make a lot of since.. but the key point here is, it seems to work for them at least part of the time)\nThe linked article directs that you should create a directory at /etc/resolver if it doesn't already exist by using the command\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/resolver\n\n\nNow you should create a new file in this directory for each resolver you want to configure.  Configure with at least these two options (there are more options available):\n\n*\n\n*the name of the resolver (corresponding to the domain name)\n\n*the DNS server to be used.\n\nFor more information about these files, see the resolver(5) manual page:\nman 5 resolver\nCreate a new file with the same name as your new top-level domain in the /etc/resolver/ directory and add a nameserver to it by running the following commands:\nsudo tee /etc/resolver/local >/dev/null <<EOF\nnameserver 127.0.0.1\nEOF\nHere local is the top-level domain name configured to respond to and 127.0.0.1 is the IP address of the server to use.\n\nI looked to see if I had that directory by default and I did not, but I did notice I had a file /etc/resolv.conf which existed by default.  I have not attempted, but if the solution in the article is unsuccessful I would try using this pre-existing resolv.conf file.. under the assumption.. it must be there for a reason.\n\nA: Apple does not resolve .local using a DNS server, but Apple Bonjour its zeroconf impementation.

A user has forgotten his FileVault password and master recovery code. FileVault 2 is not enabled, just the user's home directory is encrypted and exists as a sparsebundle. I would crack the sparsebundle but I'm having troubles getting the hash. All I really want/need to do is be able to decode the user folder so that its data can be accessed again.\nBTW, I saw somewhere that you can have apple reset the FileVault password using your Apple ID? Is this true when FileVault 2 full-disc encryption is not enabled?\n\nThe long version:\nThis involves a Macbook Pro running Mountain Lion where the user changed their user password and cannot remember either the original password, nor the password it was changed to. All that they remember about the passwords were that they were not real words, as they were acronyms of the first letter of every word in a sentence (which he doesn't remember either), lower and uppercase and likely contained some symbols. It could be anywhere from 4-9 characters long. To regain access to the computer, I booted in single-user mode and made myself an admin account, then used that account to change the original user's login password.\nNow when the original user logs in with the new password, he is told that his filevault password is not his login password and that he needs to enter the old password before he can even login.\nProblem is, of course, he doesn't remember it. No does he know the filevault master recovery code.\nHere's what I think I know so far:\nIt would be useless to crack the user password, since it's already known. I'm still kinda iffy on keychains, but they only store the current password, correct? Previous user login passwords are not stored anywhere, are they?\nSpeaking of keychains, I have both the public and private keys for the master filevault keychain. Is there anything I can do with these to unlock the filevault master keychain without knowing the filevault password?\nOr can I somehow use these to decode the sparsebundle?\nThe Macbook Pro is running OSX Mountain Lion but filevault 2 is NOT enabled, just the user folder is encrypted and exists as a sparsebundle. I changed permissions so that I could access the sparsebundle... from what I understand I could either try cracking the master.filevault keychain or the sparsebundle itself. From something I read, I am led to believe that the sparsebundle's hash might be unsalted because it's an upgraded Mac? I assume that meant because it was calculated in an older version of OSX that didn't salt the hashes, but I don't really know.\nWith regards to the master.filevault keychain, the hash is in plaintext, surrounded by zeros, correct? It doesn't really matter I suppose, as trying to crack it would likely be too difficult since I'd have to just brute force it with upper and lower case letters, symbols and 4-9 characters. I have a forensic computer with 3xATI video cards ready and waiting, but it said something like 320,000 years. (Side question: is it possible to use a dictionary list as words that the password will NOT be? The password here, if you remember, was the first letter of every word of some phrase so it's definitely NOT an english word or a variant of one.)\nSo, I guess I'm gonna give cracking the sparseimage bundle a try; can anyone tell me how to get the hash for it? Is it really in  /private/var/db/shadow under the user's GUID? Is this the hash of the filevault password for the user, or just of the user's login password? What I read was somewhat unclear on that point and the directions on how to pull the hash from the GUID file were kinda confusing. \nWhat I'm asking, I suppose, is if anyone can help me; all I really want/need to do is be able to decode the user folder so that its data can be accessed again. Whether this is by unlocking the filevault.master keychain, somehow using the private key and certificate of the filevault.master keychain to bestow access, cracking the sparsebundle image's password or whatever else, I don't care. If you know how I can get it done, I'm all ears.\nBTW, I saw somewhere that you can have apple reset the filevault password using your Apple ID? Is this only for filevault 2 whole disk encryption, or does it apply to all files/folders encoded with filevault? Does it only work on Maverick? I'd love for this to be true, since his Apple ID is perhaps the ONLY password he actually remembers.\nAny help would be welcomed- thanks in advance for the answer ;)\n\nA: If you can unlock the FileVaultMaster.keychain, you may be able to recover the user's data from the encrypted disk image.

I just discovered that one of my apps X \"disappeared\" for whatever reason from my iPad. It contained MBs of valuable data, and luckily I have an iCloud backup dated a week ago or so which have it all. However, I installed two dozens of new apps since then and likely created some amount of user data that I'd like to keep.\nHow do I restore that single app with all its data from iCloud while preserving all the other apps and their data installed since the date of iCloud backup?\nI've read the related question, but it doesn't directly help in my situation:\n\n\n*\n\n*I disabled backup to iCloud to prevent overwriting the X data in iCloud with an \"empty\" copy of X.

However, there is a checkbox within the iTunes device settings that specifically asks if you want to delete files associated with an app when you delete an app and, if you have that checked, those files will be gone.

I have three macs that are continually dropping the WiFi connection - all running Yosemite and one of them being a BRAND NEW 5 day old Macbook.  I deleted the files you recommended and the Wireless Diagnostics app (spotlight will find it) now runs without registering dropouts every few minutes.

Once you have 10 data points, you can narrow down what's happening between your Mac and your WiFi router.\n \n\n*You may need to capture WiFi logs and sysdiagnose to collect the precise reason why WiFi dropped and when. You may need engineering help to analyze these logs.\n\n\nIn the case above, the ping is a poor tool to tell WiFi issues. Not only does WiFi have to work, the IP addresses need to be working, DNS needs to be working, the upstream link needs to be working, the routing (BGP/whatever) that your ISP has configured needs to be working. Basically, If you can't call a number across the country - rather than focusing on no answer, you can focus on if your Phone is connected to the wall jack.\nIf you can ping a device on your local network (the router number above 10.0.10.1) would be way better to see if WiFi is viable rather than pinging 8.8.8.8 which lies far outside your control of the local network.\nIf anyone wants to dig into their data, post a new question with the details above and @bmike me in the comments here. I often like to help dive into this sort of issue once the data has been collected or there's a chance to get to the data to know what's happening.\nIf you don't want to collect the data to nail down why your disconnects are happening (and how often it really happens), here are other things you can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get off 2.4 GHz - use 5 GHz as it's far less susceptible to interferance and channel overlap.\n\n*If you are on 2.4 - get a tool like WiFi Explorer to make sure you have a viable environment to have a reliable experience.\n\n*If you want to learn more and have limited time to piece things together from internet volunteers, this take control book by Glenn Fleishman is excellent.\n\n\nA: Mgmt summary: Seems fixed now, finally, in Monterey. (That looked like the perfect reason to answer a 7 year old question to me...)\nI happened to service a Macbook Air that was almost impossible to use, wifi disconnecting every 5 seconds; only when I turned off bluetooth, the wifi would work.

These are all supervised and \"enrolled\" with the old server setup.\nTraveling around the world to 200+ locations with a Mac is not an option, so the best solution seems to be to open Safari on each device, go to the server / mydevices page and enroll them manually. Is this even possible with an already enrolled and supervised device? Most of these devices are not online, and it'll be fairly random as to when they're enrolled to the server and they'll probably be disconnected shortly afterwards, so what I really need is some way of predefining which group these devices belong to as they all have a different app that needs to be installed. I do not have the list of serial numbers to know which belongs to which group, but the name of the device should tell me which group it should go into.\nSo… What I need is either:\n1. Being able to make a placeholder for each device based only on the name of the device (is this possible?)\n2. Being able to filter a device into a group automatically on enrollment based on the name (name contains string)\n3. Putting a device into a group based on the user account that was used to enroll it with\nI'm pretty confident that option 2 is not possible, not sure if there's a way to do option 1, but what about option 3?\nThe last option is for the users to log in to the MDM server interface after enrolling the device, and placing it in the right group. But as far as I can tell that means they'll get FULL access to all devices enrolled into the server, and the ability to change and remove groups. Is there any way to give them access to their own devices and groups without having access to them all?\nConsidering updating the server to Yosemite at the same time since I have to start from scratch either way.\nEDIT: Oh heck… Can I even re-enroll these when they're supervised?\n\nA: You can only have 1 MDM profile installed at a time, so it will not allow you to re-enroll the devices if they are already enrolled (even if the original server is now defunct)\nI cannot recall if you can remove the MDM profile from a supervised device, but I believe that you can.\nThe easiest way would be to probably send a link that can be opened in safari to re-enroll the devices as you mentioned above. You can always take the profile and host it at a different URI so no user account is needed, therefore you wouldn't need to worry about access at all.\nHope this helps a little.\nMike\n", "Q: Portrait Lock orientation mode problem When I turn my iphone 5 sideways it has no problem going into landscape mode but when I try to lock it, it goes back to portrait mode\n\nA: Portrait Lock is just that, it locks the screen in portrait.\nThere is no global Landscape Lock, it can only be done in-app.\n", "Q: GRUB overwritten Refind/Mac bootloader - Unable to boot Getting desperate here, need some help \nbackground:\nI have a late 2012 imac, running OS X 10.10\nAlso i had Xubuntu & OpenSuse running as secondary OSs\nI was using refind & everything was rosy.\nRecently i updated opensuse 13.1 to 13.2 through a live USB.\nThis basically zapped my refind & goes directly to GRUB2 bootloader.\nNow GRUB shows me options (and advanced options) for Xubuntu & opensuse 13.1 only\nThough 13.2 was installed as an upgrade, it doesn't show up.\n13.1 doesn't boot either even after choosing it in GRUB.\nXubuntu loads without problems.\nNow the issues am having:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Magic keyboard doesn't seem to be 'active' during the boot process, so pressing the 'option' key does not do anything.\n\n*I also think that GRUB is not recognising any other bootable USBs either.\nHow do i go about restoring OS X or refind?\nRefind website says it's recommended to install refind via OSX if running on a mac as installing via Linux will corrupt the partitions...further\nis there any alternate to pressing 'option' during boot? \n(i have a normal USB keyboard connected)\n\nA: Update - i was able to solve this situation.\nThe simplest solutions evade at times.\nIn case someone else runs into this, what i did-\nIn the grub menu i was trying to see if i could do something in the command line interface..\nJust typed exit & immediately i was popped back onto refind.\nImmediately booted into OS X & reinstalled refind..\n", "Q: Accessing ICloud Drive files from an iPad I've added some files (photographs) to iCloud drive on my iMac. \nNow, I'd like to access the files on my iPad.\nI've enabled the setting in \"iCloud\" on the iPad, like all of the tutorials say.\nNow- how can I find those files using my iPad? \n\nA: Have you made sure that you have also set iCloud Photo Library (Beta) in iCloud settings as well.

Especially in X11/Inkscape, if I work zoomed in on a big canvas, this often moves my canvas several screens to the right or left and I have to carefully swipe/scroll back to my original view.\nI would like to make the swiping more explicit by allowing only two finger swipes, which should then just work as vertical/horizontal scroll gestures, as if I had triggered them on a normal mouse (with 2 scroll wheels).\nPreferences > Mouse > More Gestures > Swipe Between Pages (two fingers) does not help. I also already tried to map (globally) single finger swipes and scroll actions in Better Touch Tool (BTT) to No Action. But they still work in all apps.\nWhat else can I try, i.e., what other tools can I use or what other system settings can I change (via Terminal) to make it work?\nSystem specs: Macbook Pro Retina, Magic Mouse, OS X 10.9.5 (Mavericks), BTT 0.9985\nUpdate: Please note that:\n\n\n*\n\n*I had been using BetterTouchTool version 0.9985 (as stated above)\n\n*I also tried MagicPrefs (some older version)\n\n\nIf someone provides a detailed, convincing solution that solves the above problem, I will try to reclaim my now abandoned Magic Mouse, validate the solution, and gladly accept the answer.\n\nA: MagicPrefs (http://magicprefs.com) version 2.4.2 did the trick for me. Choose \"Preferences\" in the menu it puts in the upper right of the menu bar, then click on the \"Configure Scrolling\" button, and then uncheck the row of checkboxes to the right of the label \"One Finger Scrolling:\"\nNo more scrolling with one finger!\nSadly, as the app notes, you can no longer use \"momentum scrolls\", where the page keeps scrolling after you have lifted up your fingers. You can't have it all, I guess.\n\nA: Have you tried the MagicPrefs pane (http://magicprefs.com)? \nI suppose it can help. Or other tool that may help is BetterTouchTool (http://www.bettertouchtool.net). \n\nA: This might sound like a strange solution, but you should try using your mouse on a different surface.\nI recently changed my mouse mat/surface and this sort of strange Magic Mouse behaviour has all but disappeared.\nMy old surface was so used it has started to become shiny in patches. My guess is that these shiny patches are causing the mouse to report abnormal patterns of signals, which causes all manner of strange behaviour in general use.\n", "Q: Path to my background images on IOS8 iphone or How to recover my background's images from my iphone I made a great picture and place it as background at my iphone , now i cannot find it anymore at my camera roll.\nI need this picture that is still as my backgroud image.

I'm restoring iPad from iCloud (context) after factory reset, but the app I need to restore from iCloud doesn't show up as scheduled for install: App Store > Purchases shows an icon to download the app from the cloud (which will not restore its data, as I've seen before the reset).\nHow can I restore the app I need and its data from the iCloud?\nI know the app is there backed up as it's shown in the list of iCloud-backuped apps (iCloud > Storage & Backup > Manage Storage > (my device) > Backup options) now after reset-and-restore--and also was there before I initiated factory reset.\n\nA: My specific situation was that initially I tried a backup version that was too late to contain the app required. Once I switched to an earlier backup, the app was there and successfully restored with all its data.\n\nA: Ok this was my scenario - I updated to a new phone restored from the cloud. An app (Notespark) that i needed which was no longer supported or sold in the store didn't show up. (Note to self: ALWAYS BACKUP TO ITUNES BEFORE BUYING A NEW PHONE. THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOMETHING ICLOUD MISSES.) \nAfter research and several attempts to re-restore and making a couple more backups along the way, I realized that the data was actually brought over, but there was no app. How did I find this out?\nWhen I manually added the app, the current info didn't show. So I restored an older version and the newer info then showed in the app! (Lucky me.)  I made sure to create a backup from this so at least I had a snapshot of when the app data was current. \nNow my dilemma was using a phone that was sleep since July but have current data in that app or vice versa.  So to finally merge the two I went and tried iExplorer.\nI then restored the more recent backup I did and then using the program, moved over the\nlast backup's app data (the one I needed) using iExplorer, rebooted, and bam- everything is finally merged. \n", "Q: Safari's 'Shared Links' in Notification Center Safari has the option to subscribe to RSS feeds, so you can watch them in the 'Shared Links' section of your browser.

I'm using Yosemite. I have 2 displays (each with its own space and both have the dock) and I have a application (app1) with various windows. These windows are distributed between these two displays: I have some of them in display 1 and some of them in display 2. \nThe problem is that: when I'm in another application (not app1), if I click the app1 icon in the dock, its windows are all activated in all displays (no matter in what display I clicked app1 icon in the dock).\nWhat I want is: when I click app1 icon in the dock, activate the windows that are only in the active display. For example: suppose that none of app1 windows's are activated; if I am in display1 and click app1 icon in display1 dock's, only app1 windows that are in display1 are activated (keeping whatever was in display2 as it was).\nYou may also replace every reference I did to 'display' to 'space', because I'm using separate spaces per display. I saw a very similar (and old) post where people recommended DockSpaces, but I can't find this application anymore.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I do not have the Yosemite but on Mavericks works as follows:\n\nThe trick is to assign a second Space to the desktop. You do that by\n  pressing the Mission Control button on your Mac keyboard (F3) or\n  whatever you've assigned in System Preferences > Mission Control, and\n  moving the mouse to the upper right of the display until you see a\n  Plus (+) icon. Click it to create a new Space.\n\nAfter you've created a second Space, your dock option will change.

I have Mountain Lion and want to upgrade to Yosemite.\nI need to use iCal on my old iPad (iOs6).\nI heard Yosemite asks you to update to iCloud Drive (that can't be installed on iOs6/7) and that you won't be able to sync some apps until you update. \nWill iCal sync on Yosemite if you don't upgrade to icloud drive? If not, should I update to Maverick instead?\n\nA: I eventually updated and checked myself, and the answer to my question yes: even if you don't update to iCloud Drive, iCal keeps working and syncs on your devices connected to the old iCloud.\n", "Q: Does Apple approve widget-only iOS apps? Does anybody know if Apple will approve an app whose sole purpose is to provide one (or several) today widget(s)?\nSomehow I have a feeling that they won't, but the fact that keyboard-only (or crappy non-keyboard emoji apps) exist makes me wonder.\nDoes anybody know of any similar app that has been rejected or approved?\n\nA: See the topic I mentioned earlier and search on the page for 'collection of widgets' but here are a few widgets in the App Store which contain multiple widget in one app and work on the Notification Center for iOS8 or higher devices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Widgets Pro\n\n*Wdgts\n\n*Widget\n\n*Vidgets\n\n*Widgets Pro\n\n*OneWidget\n\n*Widgets.\n\n*My Widgets\n\n*Widgets - Calculator, Currency and Calendar\n\nA: Point 3.3.38 of the iOS Developer Program License Agreement states:\n\nExtensions, WatchKit Extensions and Keyboard extensions:\n3.3.38 Applications that include extensions in the Application bundle must provide some functionality beyond just the extensions (e.g., help screens, additional settings), unless an Application includes a WatchKit Extension. (...)\n\nSo yes, these are allowed given that you provide some help or settings screens within the main app.\n\nA: From everything that I've learned through my career as an Apple developer the one thing they refer back to constantly is, \"make your application do/provide/solve one thing really well.\" I believe even if the application is just a single widget, if it brings value to the user experience then it won't have a problem getting approved. When submitting an application to the app store, one of the questions that the developer has to answer is this what does this solve or how does this help the users? I believe this might be a way for situations just like this to have their chance to explain why it is a product worth selling.\n\nA: There are multiple widgets only app out there see also the major widget topic at MacRumors Forum (especially the topic start post). There are also quite a few there which contain various widgets in one app. \n", "Q: iPod touch can't get IP address from Airport Express I've got the following setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*DSL modem connected via Ethernet to an Airport Express\n\n*A second Airport Express extending the first\n\n*Both Airports Express are the current model, running version 7.6.4 of their software.\n\n\nBetween the two I have nine working wireless client devices, mostly Macs and iOS devices.\nHowever my 5th-gen iPod touch can't get an IP address.

The problem is, his new phone doesn't have as much space, so I can't load up the back up on there.\nIs there a way to extract at least the photos and contacts from the back up?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Mac or PC?\nBecause if you Sync'ed the phone with your computer it most likely copied the pictures to your My Pictures folder (PC) or into iPhoto (Mac). If you didn't sync the phone but just performed a backup then you will need one of the many utilities that let you browse/extract data from the backup.\nI have not futzed with such a utility in many years I hear that iExplorer is a decent product. \nIt should allow you to do just what you want on a Mac or a PC.\n", "Q: iTunes song name I am listening to my local radio (www.otvoreni.hr) using iTunes (i have downloaded stream.pls file and opened it with iTunes) and it is playing properly.\nNow, no matter how much i tried, i cant find an option to show current song name/artist... and it is driving me crazy -.-\nAnybody have any advices?

The screensaver setting is disabled (\"Start after\" is set to \"Never\") and display is set to sleep after 1 hour.  However, after 10-15 minutes of inactivity, the screensaver comes on.  Is there some other way of disabling it?\n\nA: From Synergy Configuration File Format\nscreenSaverSync = {true|false}\n\nIf set to false then synergy won't synchronize screen savers. \nClient screen savers will start according to their individual configurations.\nThe server screen saver won't start if there is input, even if that input is directed toward a client screen.\n\nA: My personal experience is that Yosemite ignores your screen saver settings... it adheres to them for a little while then simply does whatever it wants. It's a new nuisance bug in Yosemite... not a fatal issue, but just frustrating.\nFor example, you can't really turn it off. Well, not for more than a day or two, when it decides to turn itself back on. And, if you pick a specific screen saver, don't get too attached, because Yosemite will change that in a couple of days as well. \nOh well, if Apple is going to introduce new bugs, I guess this one is one of the bugs that's just annoying, rather than really problem causing... there are at least one or two of the really disrupting bugs in Yosemite that still exist, but that's for another topic.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install Windows 8.1 on a disk with two other OS X versions? I have one partition with Yosemite and another partition with Mountain Lion for some legacy software. But I want to also install Windows 8.1 and use it in dual boot.\nBootcamp is asking me to have only one partition, before installing Windows. Is there any workaround to make Bootcamp think the partition it runs on is the whole disk, or something like that. I don't want to erase my Mt Lion partition then install Windows then, if possible, re-create a new OS X partition for Mt Lion, etc. I actually need the Mt Lion partition to still work. It's weird Apple didn't think you'd ever need more than one partition if you want to install Windows too.\n\nA: WARNING:\nIf you create another partition in OS X after installing Windows with Bootcamp, it is very likely your Windows partition will become unbootable. Apparently Bootcamp cannot handle more than 4 partitions: EFI, OS X, Recovery, and Bootcamp/Windows.\nBe sure to make backups and be aware of the risk of losing your Windows partition if you create an extra partition in OS X after installing Windows with Bootcamp.\n\nA: Nevermind, I think I solved it. In case anyone finds this question and is interested, you can create more disk partitions after you install Windows with Bootcamp.\nYou can do this by taking these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup of the OS X partition you want to have (besides your\nmain OS X partition) on an external drive \n\n*Delete all the partitions except for the main OS X partition from\nwhich you will be installing Windows - now you should have one\nsingle partition with OS X\n\n*Install Windows using Bootcamp\n\n*Go back to OS X and create another partition from the main one\n\n*Restore your extra OS X partition on this newly created partition.\n\n", "Q: imac retina memory configurations An imac retina 27\" i5 (model 15.1) comes with 8GB (2X4GB) of RAM. \nI am purchasing 2x8GB chipsets.\nWill I cause a problem with my imac if I just add the 2x8GB sets yielding 24GB, or must I remove the original 8GB (2X4) first as apple suggests.\n\nA: I just did the same thing the other day. Works fine. One thing I would note is that the memory that came preinstalled was in slots 1 and 3 so I just put the new memory in 2 and 4. It wouldn't startup! So I removed the memory and tried again. Put the original 2 x 4gb into slots 1 and 2 and the new 2 x 8gb into slots 3 and 4. All worked fine and have had no problems since.\n\nA: You won't have any problem if you add more memory. But, be careful, new memory must have the exact same specs as original.\n", "Q: Will there be a performance benefit in the upgrade for iPod touch 5 to iPod touch 6 for the KNFB reader? A totally blind user wants to make use of the KNFB reader but does not want a cell phone, some of the reviews I have read suggest that it works best on the iPhone 6, other reviews suggest that that iPod touch 5 is a suboptimal version of the iPhone 5.  I have near zero knowledge about smart phones and less about apple devices. \nIs it possible to tell if an iPod touch 5 will provide the same level of function with the KNFB reader as users are seeing with the app on the iPhone 6?\n\nA: There is no iPod Touch 6. In fact, the iPod Touch hasn't been updated in 2 years and even at launch did not have as good a camera as the the iPhone 5 it was introduced with (the iPod Touch camera is coverable to the iPhone 4S or maybe even the iPhone 4?). I can't speak about the KNFB reader specifically, but the newest iPhone (6 and 6 plus) are much faster than the iPod Touch 5 from 2012, so no, the older hardware in the iPod Touch 5 cannot provide the same level of functionality.\nWhether the functionality in the ipHone 6 is enough of an improvement to make the cost worthwhile is a question only the user can answer.\n", "Q: Chrome history and favorites in Spotlight? I have fallen in love with the new Spotlight window in Yosemite as a replacement for Quicksilver (or Alfred, or whatever).\nHowever I would love to be able to \"search\" into Chrome favorites and history. A bit like if I searched into Chrome's address bar.\nIs there any way to make it happen?\n\nA: To my knowledge, thus far the only browser tied into Spotlight like that is Safari, which is one its major selling points (and the main reason I won't use FF, or now Chrome, as my primary browser.)\nThe beauty of the Safari/Spotlight connection goes beyond bookmarks, however. Spotlight actually creates an index of all the text on each page you visit. I set my Safari to never delete and now I find myself creating far less bookmarks. If, for instance, two years from now I remember reading a page about best places to stay in Tulum, I can just search my Safari index from Spotlight and pull up that page. I don't need to have ever bookmarked it and I don't need to start over with the web.\nIt's a little known, but very clever, innovation that Apple provides with Safari and Spotlight.\n", "Q: Mavericks: Can't be logged into two servers at the same time? I ran into a bug (or feature) in OS X 10.9 that I can't figure out.\nIf I'm trying to log into two servers, and I use \"guest\" credentials to log into one of them, things get screwy.\nExample: \n\n\n*\n\n*Connect to Server1 (smb://server1) as a \"Guest.\" Select share. Works great.\n\n*Connect to Server2 (smb://server2). Finder does not give me the option to log in. Instead, it shows a box with a list of shares on the server. When I try to connect to a share, I get an error saying I do not have the right permissions.\n\n\nThe reason? I'm apparently also logged in as GUEST to server2. Check it out:\n\nIn most cases, I can't disconnect from the server, regardless of how many times I click the button. I have to restart the system instead.\nThis is not a problem in OS X 10.6.8, nor in 10.10. I've also tried connecting via SMB1 (using CIFS, and by forcing SMB1 at the account level). I'm at a loss as how to fix this from the client end. Any thoughts? \n\nA: Update: I had to disable the Guest account on SERVER2. The guest account didn't have access to any shares, but it seems that simply having it active was enough to cause a problem. Here's what I think happened: 1) Log into server1 as \"GUEST\". 2) Log into server2. OS X must cache network credentials, so tried \"GUEST.\" 3) Server responded with a list of shares, but since GUEST didn't have access, returned permissions error when I tried to open a share. Still seems buggy to me. If anyone has additional insight, feel free to post here.\n", "Q: Spotlight shortcut Cmd+Space stops working in Yosemite I have to go to the spotlight menu under system preferences and change and re-set the keyboard shortcut to Cmd+Space and then it starts to work again. \nHas anyone else also experienced this?

From what I read, I cannot upgrade to Yosemite (if incorrect, please let me know) but the question is that I also have an iPad 2 and will I be able to upgrade to iOS8 if only have Lion on the desktop/mac mini?\n\nA: Per Apple's iTunes 12.0.1 support article, OS X v10.7.5 (last version of Lion) is the minimum requirement for iTunes 12, which in turn is required to sync a device that is running iOS 8.\nBased on this, it can be done. Not sure if I'd want to (performance may be horrendous in iTunes on hardware that is closing in on a decade old, and that wasn't particularly powerful even in its time) but it's possible.\nYou're probably safe til next September/October when iOS 9 (will presumably) be released - it will probably align with iTunes 13 that would almost certainly drop Lion support.\n", "Q: Why do you need a SIM to \"activate\" an iPhone Why do you need a SIM to \"activate\" an unlocked iPhone, even to use with iTunes?\nWhat happens if you use a SIM from another network than that you intend to use?\n\nA: iPhone is a phone.\nIn order for it to work as a phone you need a phone service provider.\nAlso in order for the software to complete the boot process you need a active SIM even if you do not intend to use it as a phone.\nThat comes in a form of a SIM card from a network provider.\nIf you activate it with one provider but later you want to switch to another, you can do that providing your phone is unlocked from any providers.\nIn your case the unlocked means you can use any SIM from any provider to activate the phone function.\nhttp://support.apple.com/en-us/HT3406\n", "Q: Update required when turn on Mac (Yosemite) I recently install Yosemite, I then found that every time I turn my computer off and turn it back on, it would ask for my password for an update (Update Required) it would then go through an update with a progression bar and then boot as normal. I have been on the App Store and checked if I require any updates for anything and it just says I am up too date.

So, is it possible to attach an external monitor to the new iMac 5k?\nAnd can somebody with powers maybe generate a new tag iMac5k, if it is considered useful?\n\nA: Yes. According to Apple's website, under the device's \"Connections and Expansion\" section:\n\nHeadphone port\n  SDXC card slot\n  Four USB 3 ports (compatible with USB 2)\n  Two Thunderbolt 2 ports\nMini DisplayPort output\n  Support for DVI, VGA, and dual-link DVI (adapters sold separately)\n  10/100/1000BASE-T Gigabit Ethernet (RJ-45 connector)\n  Kensington lock slot\n\niMac with 5K retina display specs\n\nA: I know there's an accepted answer, but I'm running a BenQ GW27605HS as a second monitor via a Thunderbird -> HDMI adapter and works great.  There seems to be a Yosemite bug (ANOTHER Yosemite bug) where the screens will always start up mirrored, but a visit to the system prefs quickly fixes it.\nBtw, I would definitely upgrade to the faster graphics card if you're going to do this -- I'd do it anyway with the 5K display but especially if you're going to use an additional monitor.\n", "Q: How do I make passphrase prompts for ssh keys appear in the terminal, not as a graphical prompt? I'm SSHing into my mac and doing some stuff remotely through tmux (namely uploading some stuff to github). When I just tried to run a git push, my command kept stalling silently. I found ssh stalling on this message, debug1: key_parse_private_pem: PEM_read_PrivateKey failed, and divined that the password prompt was being caught by the Keychain app and being displayed on the screen. I was able to get it to go through by using teamviewer to enter my password on-screen.\nBut how do I keep these private key prompts from going to the screen in the future? I'm fine with being prompted for my passphrase, but I would like it to happen in a terminal window in the future.\n\nA: the password for your key is managed by ssh-agent and it defaults to ask for your password using the GUI you mentioned. You could:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unlock your key using the shell frontend to ssh-agent by calling ssh-add. In this case you might want to lock your key with ssh-add -D before you log out of the box.\n\n*Circumvent ssh-agent by temporarily unsetting the SSH_AUTH_SOCK variable ssh uses to connect to the agent. You can do this for a single command like this\nSSH_AUTH_SOCK=\"\" git push\n\nor for the whole shell session by calling unset SSH_AUTH_SOCK.\nMarcel\n", "Q: Chrome window buttons hidden when Save As / Open window appear I am having issue with chrome, when ever I want to download or upload any item, the default window which appears, I cant see the buttons of that window, they kind of go down the dock, until unless I click the browse button (marked in black) to collapse the window and scroll back full again, only then I can see the buttons.\nIs it issue with chrome?\nCheck screen shot for details.\n\n\nA: Option 1 = Switch to fullscreen \nOption 2 = Autohide the dock\nWhen you try to save this time resize the dialog window so its not so low and continue saving.\nIt should remember the same size when you switch back to your normal screen or dock settings.\n", "Q: How do I mass delete photos from my iPhone in Yosemite / iOS 8? I previously used Image Capture (ie. this solution: How to mass delete your photos in your iPhone?). It seems like the delete functionality was removed in Yosemite. Now what? I have 800+ photos and I don't want to select them one by one.\nWhen I connect to iTunes, it says \"iCloud Photos is On\" - and does not allow me to sync through iTunes.\n\n\nA: Turning off iCloud Photos Beta and restarting my iPhone worked, then the option returned in Image Capture.  Seems to be a bug in iCloud Photos Beta\n\nA: When your iOS device is using the iCloud photo storage option, you can delete all the photos using the web interface at https://icloud.com as opposed to using Image Capture.\nYou can \"delete\" all the local copies of the photos by navigating to:\n\n*\n\n*Settings > iCloud > Photos\n\nTap the iCloud Photo Library button and then tap \"Remove from iPhone\" which will delete all photos off the iOS device in question (if it's not an iPhone - the prompt should say iPad or iPod).\nThis failed me on my iPhone 11 Pro and iPad Pro with iOS 13 so they have residue photos left. In one case 36,000 photos that take up 45 GB of space. I will have to look at a second step since this does not seem to be as reliable at cleaning with recent hardware and software. Image Capture of course works, but I’ll see if I’m clever enough to do it untethered to a computer.\n\nA: I'm using OS/X Yosemite Public Beta. The delete functionality does work out of Image Capture, but the control is not in the menu toolbar. The delete icon on the bottom of the window works (red circle with slash).\n\nA: This doesn't really solve the bug that you seem to be encountering but if you just pull up iPhoto and import the photos it will ask you if you want to keep the photos on your device or delete them. Kind of quick and dirty but if you want them gone that will work.\n\nA: This worked for me -- Turn off/uncheck \"Photos\" in iCloud on your Mac & iDevice. Restart both devices. The delete button was then displayed in Image Capture. Prior to restarting my iPhone, Image Capture displayed my photos in duplicate. The restart solved this.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: This seem to be a bug on iCloud Photo Library (maybe Apple will officially disable this for everybody once the OS X Photos app is released).\nAs a workaround, you can login on iCloud Photos online and delete the pictures from there. Use the Select Photos button on the top right corner (next to Upload). It's not optimal, but much faster than doing it on the phone.\n\nA: There's a little box in the lower-left corner of the Image Capture window.  Click the box and the \"Delete after import\" option should appear (at least it did for me).\n\nA: I have the same issue, I think it's a bug in iCloud.\n", "Q: Bluetooth mouse stops working almost everytime I wake my mac from sleep I use my mac (yosemite 10.10) at work with bluetooth mouse and at home with just the trackpad.

The later can occur if TRIM is inactive, the disk is very full or it has no time to do garbage collection. So if the SSD wants to write data, it will need to delete old data first, slowing down the process.\nWhen encrypting the SSD, all its contents gets re-written and free blocks are liberated. This will result in faster write speeds. Reformatting a disk is an effective way of restoring write speeds.\nJust a theory however...\n", "Q: How to get iMovie, iPhoto & garage band back after rebuilding system? My hard drive malfunctioned and I had to have it replaced with a new one and reboot my Mac. Now iPhoto, iMovie and garage band have all disappeared and are no longer on my Mac. Is there any way to get them back without having to pay for them?\n\nA: Log into the App Store, and they should be there in the 'Purchases' tab - assuming that when you bought the Mac you told the Store that you wanted to register the apps to your Apple ID.\n\nA: The apps aren't part of the OS - so you will need to use the same Apple ID as you used to \"redeem\" them initially. If you feel you didn't redeem them, you could contact Apple support and ask for them to check if the included apps for that Mac have been claimed. If not, I would expect them to get you redemption codes to not have to pay for them if they should be included.\nIf someone redeemed them, it's up to Apple whether they decide to slide you them gratis or ask for you to purchase them - but it wouldn't hurt to ask nicely.\n\nA: You cannot ever get them back if they're not in the purchases >-<\n", "Q: With FileVault: Yosemite starts with default desktop background Since enabling FileVault (I think only after I did that for my second hard drive), the desktop background keeps resetting to the default at every startup.

Have approximately 4 wifi spots that I have re-set up in my new house.\nTo save battery apple devices also use location of known wifi hotspots to give locations.   My problem is that I suspect that this is a crowdsourced information gathering.   Sometimes my devices show themselves at my old house (while at new house).   I have waited for 2 weeks now, trying to use location services as much as possible to train apple about the new location of the wifi spots.\nIs there anyway to force or speed up the change?   My alternative is to change the name of the hotspots, but do not want to go through the hassle of setting everything (range extenders, devices) again.\n\nA: There's a company called SkyHook that sells a wifi-based geolocation product to many companies, but not sure if Apple is one of them. It was a couple of years ago though. \nYou can ask them to update their database here: http://www.skyhookwireless.com/submit-access-point. If Apple is doing their own geolocation services now, you're likely out of luck.\nETA: changing your (E)SSID probably won't do anything; the location services are more likely to use the BSSID, which is the wireless MAC address of the equipment.\n\nA: im not sure this will help, my gut says it might, but under wireless settings in your iOS device, forget network then re connect, (note you need to reenter password and SSID)\n", "Q: How do I make an AppleScript use a Folder in the Contents of a Bundle for an alias on the Desktop?

After that your messages will contains both of certificates.\n\nA: The problem is that StartCom's PKCS12 certificates are bad.

If nothing else, I at least want to view them so I know what I'm losing if I reformat.\n\nA: All newer Mac OS X systems are capable of reading all common Windows file systems (FAT/FAT32/NTFS) right out of the box. So it shouldn't be a problem to access the contents of the internal HDD connected to your drive dock, given that the Unitek is working with your Mac.  \nSince you didn't use any special backup software (generating unaccessible file formats) the same should be valid for your external HDD.\n", "Q: Always Automatically 'Right-Size' All Finder Window Columns Individually? Is there a way to make all Finder Column Views automatically 'right-size' all of their columns individually by default in OS X 10.10.x 'Yosemite?'  \n\nA: The only solution up to OS X 10.10 (Yosemite), is to download XtraFinder - a free app that is very useful for your issue as well as many other things, including restoring full coloured labels rather than OS X's silly little dots. \nSadly the full functionality of XtraFinder was destroyed initially when El Capitan came along but if you don't mind disabling System Integrity Protection some of XtraFinder's features can be restored. The guy who publishes this is working on an update that will restore everything in El Capitan, later. You can plumb the internet to get more information about XtraFinder and also how to disable SIP. \n", "Q: updating an old mac OS X 10.4 skype informed me that they no longer support OS X 10.4 Is it possible to update my computer or should I trash it. \nthe processor is Dual 800 MHz powerPC G4 , 2MB SDRAM , Start up disc macintosh HD, Built around 2001.

(A \"Get Specified URLs\" task followed by a \"Display Webpages\" task.)  Ever since upgrading to Yosemite, however, there's been a bit of an issue.  Sometimes several tabs are opened, and it's no longer handling that very well.\nPreviously, even if Safari was slow, all of the tabs would open when it's available.  Since the Yosemite upgrade, however, only some of the tabs open and the rest pop up a message:\n\nYou can't open the application \"Safari\" because it is not responding.\n\nIs there a way to tell Automator to wait until Safari responds rather than just fail on some of the URLs?\n\nA: If you replace the \"Display Webpages\" task with a \"Run AppleScript\" task you can control what it does (i.e. add a delay)...

I've had syncing of notes to iCloud turned on for a while, and I was never really able to figure out when the notes were synced. It always seemed pretty random. Anyways, my notes from iOS 8 on iPhone 5S are synced to iCloud just fine, but the Notes app on my Mac refuses to sync to iCloud. As a result, no edits/new notes are pushed to iCloud, and the notes from my iPhone are never synced to my Mac.\nI have turned Notes on in my iCloud settings, but it doesn't work. I also tried to disable it and enable it again several times, but it just doesn't work. I have disabled Notes sync for all other Internet Accounts on my Mac, so it is only enabled on the iCloud account.\nWhat on Earth is going on here? Thanks in advance!\n\nA: From what I've seen from Apps like Notes, Numbers, and Pages... They're now acting as usual apps which looks for \"filesystem\" files. i.e. something on the local drive.\nWhen you fire up an iCloud enabled app, then need to open a document, in your Favourites is \"iCloud Drive\" and now things are stored under there, under folders which correspond to their apps i.e. Numbers, Pages etc...\nAs to the syncing.. You needn't worry about this. Apple handles this.. Sadly, if you're looking to move directly over from App 1 on Device 1 to App 1 on Device 2 in 1 second, it won't happen.\nedit\nTo resolve this, what I've done in the past is delete the container that the app in question lives in and start again.\ne.g. in your case.. notes lives in: ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes\nProblem is, when you do this, you probably will lose the notes you have... The ones which are already in iCloud will resend back down to the Mac you deleted the notes Container from.\nDo note that after you do this, it's HIGHLY advised that you do a  \"repair permissions\" on the drive so the sandbox permissions/ACL's are reset.\n\nA: Just a follow-up on this. I wouldn't say that I have fixed the problem, but closing and opening the Notes app seems to enable syncing again. It continues to stop syncing automatically, however. I am not sure if this happens after wakening the Mac up from sleep, which I do a lot. Nevertheless, restarting the app seems to work so far.\nAlso, make sure that you are viewing \"All Notes\" or \"Notes\" under the \"iCloud\" section in the sidebar of the Notes app, and not just the notes that are on your Mac locally. This happened to me once because I had hidden the sidebar (drag the edge of the left side of the window to the right to show it again).\nIt seems to be a bug in the Notes app on OS X, as syncing works fine between iOS and iCloud. For now my solution is to manually restart the Notes app when I want to sync, which sucks, but at least it syncs!\n", "Q: In Mail, Cmd-Opt-Ctrl-F does something unexpected I would like to assign Cmd-Opt-Ctrl-F to flag an email item, but that combination in mail is already assigned somewhere, and I cannot find where that is.\n\n\n*\n\n*It is not in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts. \n\n*It does not seem to be on any of the Mail menus.\n\n\nThe action that it causes seems to be \"position to a specific mail item in one of the folders\". \nSo I deleted that mail item. Then Cmd-Opt-Ctrl-F did not do anything, so I thought. So I went into System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts and set it up.\nNow when I press that combination, instead of flagging the item as desired, it positions to a different mail item in the same folder. And always that exact item.\nAny ideas where Cmd-Opt-Ctrl-F is being assigned, and why it has such a weird action?\n\nA: In Mavericks Mail:\nThe shortcut for Flag is shift- cmd - L to assign the Urgent Flag.\nThere is no Cmd-Opt-Ctrl-F in my Mail app.\nHowever, if you try to add that shortcut in keyboard shortcut it will alert you if that short cut is used by someone else and show you by whom.\n", "Q: How to delete U2 album from iPod Touch The free U2 album was downloaded to my iPod Touch.

If I try to enter the start or end time as 14:00, it enters the 1 and then beeps at me.  \nCalendar does display events in 24 hour format, I just can't create a new event using it. I've check the calendar and Mac settings and they all appear correct. \n\nA: I do not have Yosemite but on Mavericks you can set it up as follows:\nOpen system preferences Languages and Regions\nClick on the 24 Hour time format.\nThat should change the time format in Calender.\n\nI can enter any time (as 2 digits)\nLet me know if it works in Yosemite.\n\nA: There does seem to be a problem here. My computer was showing a 12 hour clock plus am or pm. Changing this to 24 hour clock in the date and time section of system preferences didn't work. After some digging I found that the language and region section of system preferences also has a 24 hour clock setting option.

I'm about to set up a Mac mini to dual boot Mavericks and Yosemite for software development purposes. What's the recommended minimum size of a Yosemite partition?\n\nA: I have run Mavericks/Yosemite on a 64 GB SD card and after a clean install, there was about 20-30 GB free.\nI would say that you could install Yosemite on a 20 GB partition, but I would not recommend anything less than 30 GB.\n\nA: Instead of rebooting constantly to test software in different environments, try a virtual machine. I use VMware Fusion. Major advantages include suspend rather than shut down, and you can have as many as you have disk space for. You can have as many running simultaneously as you have memory for, and you don't need extra hardware to handle different versions - the hardware is simulated, so it's even possible to run future versions on older hardware within some limits.\nMy VM library includes 10.6 thru 10.10, Windows XP thru 11, Ubuntu, and DOS.\n\nA: It is possible,  but unadvisable,  to run OS X 10.10 Mavericks on a 16 GB partition. I am doing so at the moment during a reinstall.\nMac OS X prefers to have applications on the boot drive, as well as the user home locations, swapfile, and sleep image file. \nif you are not willing to hack files, then a 32gb partition is a minimal install partition for practical purposes,  allowing for the roughly 12 GB system, 8 GB of vm files, 8 GB of sleep image, and some apps.\n\nA: From the official source:\nThese Mac models are compatible with OS X Yosemite\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac (Mid 2007 or newer)\n\n*MacBook (Late 2008 Aluminum, or Early 2009 or newer)\n\n*MacBook Pro (Mid/Late 2007 or newer)\n\n*MacBook Air (Late 2008 or newer)\n\n*Mac mini (Early 2009 or newer)\n\n*Mac Pro (Early 2008 or newer)\n\n*Xserve (Early 2009)\n\n\nYou can upgrade to OS X Yosemite from the following\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X Snow Leopard (v10.6.8)\n\n*OS X Lion (v10.7)\n\n*OS X Mountain Lion (v10.8)\n\n*OS X Mavericks (v10.9)\n\n\nGeneral Requirements\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X v10.6.8 or later\n\n*2GB of memory\n\n*8GB of available storage\n\n", "Q: Copying a DVD in Yosemite I am looking for software to copy a DVD home created without copy guard.

Eject the source DVD and insert your blank. Select the DVD image in the Disk Utility window and click on Burn Image (if it is not in the toolbar, it should be a menu choice).\nNot as easy as Toast but easy enough...\n\nA: Roxio says they will issue an update (one of these days)...\nhttp://forums.support.roxio.com/topic/104311-tt12-on-yosemite/\nHowever, with it being March 2015 and still no update, it might be costing more money to re-engineer the app than they can afford to invest based on sales projections.\n\nA: There are a few options for copying and burning DVDs. For copying DVDs a few options are: HandBrake, a free and open source option. Another DVD copying software is MDRP (Mac DVD Ripper Pro) which gives you 5 free DVD rips before purchase is required. One more option if the other two don't work or don't suit you is RipIt by the Little App Factory which gives you 10 free DVD copy's also. \nA free app for burning DVDs with video or just audio on your Mac is Burn which I have used to create a home movie recently and works well.

Both monitors are identical. They have both a VGA port and a DVI port on the back (see photo). \nI am not certain how the ports can be used properly to connect the two monitors together. What is the easiest way to use them both with a MacBook Air that has only one Thunderbolt port? Can I use a Thunderbolt to VGA adapter to connect to one monitor via a VGA cable and then use a DVI cable between the two monitors?\nI would like to use both monitors without purchasing an expensive piece of hardware like the Matrox TripleHead2Go. \n\n\nA: since they air only has 1 thunderbolt and some usb2 ports, you're pretty pinched.\nyou could get a thunderbolt dock along the lines of the caldigit unit..  this has an hdmi and a pass-through thunderbolt on it.\nyou can then get an hdmi-dvi cable for oen monitor and a thunderbolt to dvi adapter for the other.\nanother option would just be a thunderbolt hub.  neither solution is very cheap, but it willg et you wht you want.  there are also devices for usb-vga conversion, but that's a last resort, imho.\ni'm curious how well these will be powered (how much resolution and how laggy) they will be, but it should work.\n\nA: Venicejeff is right.\nTo expand, you can't daisychain monitors that don't have a thunderbolt port on them. DVI and VGA require dedicated inputs. So if you want those two monitors you will need an adapter that gives you another video port. Like a thunderbolt dock and some adapters or that Matrox unit that you mentioned in your question.\nThe only other option is one of the Lenovo monitors and the display built into the MacBook.\n", "Q: Make gmail in chrome the default email application for Yosemite I love my MacBook but I'm not a huge fan of Mail. Can I make GMail in Chrome the default email application for Yosemite so that when I click on email links I am sent to a new draft there?\nI've done this before on other systems.\n\nA: To Set default protocol handler in your chrome browser, visit any web app or website which support protocol handlers (For ex: Gmail for mailto:, Google Calendar for webcal: ) and you’ll see Protocol handler icon <<>> on right side of your address bar, click that icon to set default handler.\nhttp://www.ashout.com/complete-guide-to-google-chrome-handlers/\n\nA: Sort of...\nIf you mean \"when I click on a \"mailto:\" link on a web page, can it go to my Gmail tab in Chrome instead of Apple's Mail.app.\" the answer is yes.\nIn Chrome go to Setting -> Advanced ->content Settings. Scroll down to handlers -> manage handlers and select Gmail from the mailto link.\nA more complete tutorial for Chrome, Firefox and IE can be found here.\n\nA: I tried doing this, but ran into an issue where my \"Manage Handlers\" window was blank and I could not add anything to it. \nHere is the javascript solution that works even if your Handlers window does not. I figured I would post this here, in case anyone else finds this post and has this problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you are logged in to Gmail and the active window is your main Gmail page (or nothing will happen).\n\n*Copy/paste this into the address bar: \njavascript:navigator.registerProtocolHandler(\"mailto\",\"https://mail.google.com/mail/?extsrc=mailto&url=%s\",\"Gmail\")\n\n*Add the javascript: to the front again if needed, because when you pasted it, Chrome probably trimmed everything before and including the colon.

The file format changed and iWork '09 cannot directly open the new files.\nYou can export iWork '09 compatible files from Pages 5.x though.\n\nA: Being that I have frustrated no end by this ridiculous message with NO solution (that I could find) from Apple, here is what I finally stumbled on.\nAfter a recent \"re-start\" I could not open some documents. Always got the \"xml\" message.\nTried all sorts of things. Updated to Yosemite - wouldn't run. TRIED to update Pages to 5,x (had 4.x before) - no dice. Then Yosemite finally updated. Pages ? I got the \"installing\" message but that NEVER ended.\nAfter more frustration, I finally found a particular document I had had on my \"startup: list that was PASSWORD protected. For whatever reason, on re-start, the password protected file didn't come up.\nSo, finding THAT doc in my pages list, I clicked on it and the password box came up. I entered the password and the document appeared. Once I did that the other docs that previously got the \"xml\" message appeared as well. And finally, I find that I DO HAVE Pages 5.x installed after all (Only Pages 4.x was showing before.  \nNote - for about a week or 10 days now something (automatic update ?) has changed in my MAC. When I click on say \"Pages\" (in the dock) my Chrome browser slides to the right instead of simply staying in the background. My menu bar also \"hides\" where before it stayed at the top.

Given that the encryption is done with gpg—a pretty widely-used open source tool for encryption—it's likely that the passwords will be pretty safe.\nMoreover, the gpg-encrypted files can be stored offline, as requested by the OP. However, since the files are encrypted with gpg you can probably safely put the binary files online somewhere, so long as you take the necessary steps to protect your gpg key that decrypts the passwords.1\nPasswords that are tracked by pass are stored in ~/.password-store, which is, by default, a git repository. Since the files are encrypted with gpg and can only be decrypted with your key, one thing you can do—if you want to—is add a git remote that is hosted on some cloud service, like GitHub or Bitbucket. I personally keep my ~/.password-store directory in a private repo on Bitbucket (since Bitbucket has unlimited private repos, unlike GitHub). And I feel pretty safe with this setup, given that the files are encrypted and can only be decrypted with my gpg key. \nAs far as autofill goes, there is a Firefox plugin that has been written by the community that uses pass.\nThe community has also developed a cross-platform GUI app, an Android app, a Windows client, and an emacs package.\nI suppose one reason to prefer some of the other answers is that they are probably more user-friendly, but I personally prefer pass to any other options that I have come across for a Mac, since I don't have to trust companies and their closed-source password managers and since the encryption of the passwords is done with a widely-used open source encryption tool.\nIf the set up process seems intimidating, here is a blog post that walks you through the process.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Here are two blog posts (1, 2) that detail good and safe ways to generate and protect your gpg keys.\n\n\nA: I am also a web developer and couldn't recommend 1Password more highly: https://agilebits.com/onepassword/mac\nHonestly, the price has by and far been worth it for me. I believe I have ~300 login items in there and nearly all of them have different, very secure passwords. You can store nearly any data in the there and it is extremely flexible. The keyboard shortcut Command + \\ automatically fills out logins and makes that part extremely easy (as long as there is a URL with that). Note that as of 1Password 5.0 it does not support auto-filling HTTP Basic Authentication. You can still copy/paste those credentials, though.\nIt is also possible to tag and organize items. There are many types of items including logins, servers, credit cards, identities (for filling out your name/address/email/etc.) and notes which also create a natural organization. \nEdit: I also like the fact that since the URL can be (and is) saved in 1Password for the login it will not automatically fill in a form that is not the correct URL. For example if a scammer sends you an phishing email with a link to login to your bank, 1Password won't recognize the site and hence will not automatically fill the form when you hit the keyboard shortcut. \nI will also note that 1Password offers excellent multi-device syncing. \nI have tried SplashID and my brother (who also does web development) has tried LastPass, I believe, several years ago but we both are on 1Password and love it. \nI am not affiliated with 1Password. \n", "Q: How to play video to Chromecast with subtitle?

Huh? “To improve reliability, ... will remove your existing backup history”\nDoesn't that kind of miss the point of having backups??\nTime Machine is set to use a network share dedicated to that purpose.  It claims to have 7T free, which would be true only if the volume in the sparse bundle automatically expands (does it?).  The bands files total 118G which sounds like the size I created the volume for initially.  I think the initial full backup consumed about 25G.\nThinking the volume might have been corrupted, I restored it from a snapshot of the host storage's volume that was made just before Yosemite was installed.\nWhat's going on?  I can't imagine that Apple is serious about casually throwing away all backups.\n\nA: When I posted, I suspected that this was specifically related to the Yosemite update, as I'd seen a few hits in Google with similar things (but no fixes), especially since I had already restored the meta-backup meant to address exactly the issue discussed in the older Q's of generic network disk corruption.  \nAfter reading the Troubleshooting post referenced by the older Q, I learn that this message is produced by a verification (fsck) that's run once a month.  This means that whatever anomaly it found was not something that occurred in the previous backup, but could have occurred any time in the last month!  Now, I think the correlation with this “happening” right after the Yosemite upgrade may be that the last-check-date gets lost or it intentionally performs a check right away after installing.  So, any problem that occurred in the last few weeks suddenly is brought to your attention.\nIf this is checked on purpose, I think it would be better to check before installing the update, to give people a chance to get a working backup of their system before the update.\nI rolled back the NAS volume another week, and all was well.  Just let it finish “finding” and then checking the disk.\n", "Q: permanently stop iPhone text messages from appearing on my iMac How do I permanently stop iPhone text messages from appearing on my iMac.

I am trying to install a Linux distribution on a partition of my hard drive. I used Disk Utility to resize the main partition on my hard drive and it completed seemingly successfully. I was left with the following:\n\nHowever, as soon as the partition was created, I was left unable to rename or resize the remaining OS X partition again (all options were grryed out). Also, Disk Utility allows me to click the \"+\" to make a new partition, as well as name and choose the file format for the new partition, but doesn't let me resize anything (as seen below)...\n\nFurthermore, when I click on \"Apply\", I get the log message \"Preparing to partition disk: .. \", but this process then hangs and never terminates (as seen below).\n\nDisk Utility also lets me click Apply again, and the same message will appear in the log again, but with no results. \nIf I try switching hard drives in the left pane, and clicking back to my main hard drive, it shows me that no partition was created at all.\nThe drive was verified and repaired boht within the OS and upon boot many times, with success each time.\nWhat is going on here?

Is this a common problem with yosemite and is there a fix?\n\n\nA: This effect occurs when \"Reduce Transparency\" is enabled (System Preferences > Accessibility).\n(Very odd that this is how the effect would degrade, instead of just make it a solid colored square.)\n\nA: I solved it accidentally on my 2009 macbook pro running 10.10.3 by removing the battery, unplugging the charge cable, and holding the power button down for 15 seconds.

I then have to manually change it everytime. Anyone know why this is happening, or how to fix it?\nAlso, I can't get rid of Soundflower for some reason.\n\nA: First of all, I'll address the how to uninstall Soundflower problem:\nA number of people have run into problems uninstalling it in the past. The main problem seems to be that you have to reboot your machine after running the uninstaller but if that doesn't work for you try removing it from the Audio MIDI setup. \nOpen Audio MIDI Setup in the utilities folder and look for Soundflower listed there, select it and click the minus near the bottom left to remove it.\n\nNow that you've removed Soundflower, you need to set the headphones as your default output device:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your headphones\n\n*Open System Preferences and Open the \"Sound\" panel\n\n*Go to the \"Output\" tab\n\n*Select your headphones here\n\n*Close system preferences\n\n\nYour system should now default to the headphones whenever you plug them in.\n\nIf you run into further problems, you can try a couple of advanced steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder and in the \"Go\" menu, select \"Go to Folder...\"\n\n*Type ~/Library/Preferences and click Go\n\n*Locate two files called com.apple.systempreferences.plist and com.apple.audio.AudioMIDISetup.plist and move them both to the trash\n\n*Reboot your computer\n\n*If you're still having problems reset PRAM by rebooting again and holding command-option-p-r as soon as your computer boots up, keep holding until your computer restarts again and you hear the startup chime.\n\n\nFollow all the above steps from the beginning of this post and one of them should solve your problem, make sure you check each time if your headphones are now working by default.\n\nA: Uninstall Soundflower. There should be an uninstaller located at:\n/Applications/Soundflower/Uninstall Soundflower.scpt\n\nRun it, enter your password, and reboot (very important). If it's not there, upgrade Soundflower first here.\nEDIT: You can set your default audo device by going to /Applications/Utilities and opening Audio MIDI Setup. Select the device you want to use, click the gear, and then Use this device for sound output.\n\n\n\nA: Restart the computer, select the output device you want, restart again, then look in System Preferences again to see if it saved as the setting you previously had. \n", "Q: Are all Verizon iPhone 5S are GSM Unlocked globally?

With Terminator, you can open multiple file in one window, code separatly on them, and many other great things.\nI thought that if it runs on Ubuntu it could possibly run on Mac OSX but it seems that it doesn't work.\nIs there a Terminator-like terminal app for OS X Yosemite?\n\nA: My solution to darting between Mac and Linux as a developer is to use tmux, which runs in the terminal on both platforms. You get an identical feature set, and you can even sync your config files between the two platforms for all your fave build shortcuts across terminal panes, and anything else you'll ever think of, I imagine.\ntmux runs in a terminal, and from there you can divide up the terminal window as desired.\ntmux runs in a terminal, so it's not sexy.\n\nA: Use iTerm2. Can do most things that Terminator does.\n\nA: The gnometerminator docs are slightly outdated. Fink is now in stable, but must be installed from source on OSX 10.11.\nhttp://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/package.php/terminator?rel_id=10.11-x86_64-current-stable\n\nA: Did you try to do run Terminator with Fink:\n\nTo install Terminator on Mac OS X you will need to be using\n  the Fink project, and have it configured to allow unstable software.\n  With those requirements satisfied, in a terminal run: fink install\n  terminator\n\nhttp://gnometerminator.blogspot.no/p/introduction.html\nAlthough iTerm2 works great for me (although I prefer Yakuake for terminal on Linux)\n\nA: While not completely 1:1 with all of the features of Terminator, Hyper is a nice looking terminal on macOS that is easily extensible. I use multiple window panes frequently and Hyper does a great job at that.\nIf you have a really busy terminal (and I mean REALLY busy, like spewing data) it's a bit slower since it's backed in web tech. Still, it's an option worth looking at.\n\nA: There is hope in brew too:\n$ brew search terminator\nhomebrew/x11/terminator\n\nHere I would like to say too that, agreed ITerm2 is great but there might be use cases where terminator ... I mean the same terminator on Linux would shine such as better keyboard mappings for emacs out of the box or similar.\n\nA: it's a bit late, but for anyone reading this, use warp\nthis one is amazing\n", "Q: How can I check warranty state of my iPhone? I’m from Maldives and I am buying an iPhone 6 plus from a shop in Male. They say that there is a 1 year Apple warranty but they aren’t providing me with any slips of the warranty. \nHow can I verify whether my iPhone is covered by warranty?\n\nA: Apple provides an online tool to check service and support coverage using your device's serial number.  You can find the serial number on your iPhone by tapping Settings > General > About.\nSelfSolve.apple.com allows you to enter an Apple serial number and then see what warranty options are available.\nThe device does not need to be registered in order to be checked.\nSee below for an example of a MacBook Air that is still covered under AppleCare.\n\n\nA: You could check it on Apple Support.\nIf your iPhone is registered it will appear there and you will be able to check your warranty status. If is not registered, you must do it there.\n\nA: Selfsolve.apple.com is definitely the right place to check warranty coverage. You can also call Apple with the serial number (phone number below).\nBefore you buy, is it used? If so, make sure it is removed from the previous owner's Apple ID so you aren't locked out! More tips on buying used iPhones here.\nI'd also recommend going to supportprofile.apple.com afterwards where you can edit registration information for the device if it's not currently registered. If it's not under warranty, it's always worth calling in to see if there is a recall or replacement program for the issue you're experiencing. AppleCare is 1-800-275-2273.\n", "Q: \"Use Option as Meta key\" with ability to type the # symbol I am using Terminal version 2.5, where I have two requirements:\n\n*\n\n*I need to be able to type the Meta key.\n\n*I need to be able to type the # character, too (Option+3 for the UK keyboard layout)\n\nHow can I satisfy both of these? By default, (2) is satisfied, but (1) is not. I can then turn on \"Use Option as Meta key\", which satisfies (1), but breaks requirement (2).\nHow can I have both? (It shouldn't be so hard for me to just be able to type.)\nEdit: what I'm looking for, for example, might be a way to just \"Use Option as Meta key\" for the left/right Option key, or a way to override the \"Use Option as Meta key\" for the sole exception of the # character.\n\nA: iTerm 2 can be configured to only use one option key as meta:\n\n\nA: For requirement 2 you can choose to make the keyboard an Australian one. The only difference between UK and Australian i alt3 and shift3. For UK they give # and £ and vice versa for Australian. This means that for an Australian keyboard # is shift3 as it is for a US or under Windows or Linux.\nTo change the keyboard layout (under Yosemite)  got System Preferences->Language & region - hit the Keyboard Preferences button and use + to add Austrailian  to the left hand column\n\nA: I finally figured out how to do this by code:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/30336086/make-shift3-produce-not-%C2%A3-on-osx-by-code\nIf you have developer tools, you can compile & run that from the commandline.\n\nA: I have built a solution myself and it doesn't require abandoning Terminal.app in favour of iTerm 2.\nIt is a simple status bar app that runs in the background and rewrites all left Alt + $KEY key events to two key events in rapid succession, Esc, then $KEY; however, it only does this if Terminal.app is in focus.\nYou can find the source for the app here. You'll need Xcode to build it.\n", "Q: Diff between diskutility and finder on free space I came across this today :\n\nAt first I was like : \"Caching bastard.\" but no... The finder is right and the diskutil is wrong... Why ?\n\nA: The reason is probably that you have local snapshots of time machine backups (http://support.apple.com/en-us/ht4878). The difference is that the Finder calculates the free space you can use (the backups would be deleted if necessary). They are stored at /.MobileBackups (at least that's what it has been in Mavericks iirc) if you want to have a look and verify how much space it is consuming.\nOther possible causes:\n\n\n*\n\n*some people claim that if you have disk encryption enabled those\nvalues may differ \n\n*maybe Disk Utility was opened before you removed\nsome files and didn't refresh?\n\n", "Q: 500gb take up space on my HD, but don't belong to any visible file or folder I've got a problem: 500gb take up space on my HD, but don't belong to any visible file or folder.

Is there anything that can be done with this except backing up the disk, reformatting and copying the contents back in? (That will take a lot of time.) The format of the disk is Mac OS extended, encrypted, journaled.\n\nA: *\n\n*Did you emptied the trash after removing the image file (if it was removed in Finder).\n\n*Check in About this MAC > Storage, if this 500 GB is not used by Backups. If it is, that means that it might be local snapshot of time Machine backup including this file. See http://support.apple.com/en-us/ht4878 \n\nA: I recommend you scan your Disk with 'Daisydisk' and locate the files that are eating up your Diskspace.\n\nA: Occasionally a disk image will unmount but not release the space. If you are Terminal-fluent, kill diskimages-helper. Or reboot (cold, full-power-down reboot.

I also want to transfer my contacts for emails and Facetime. I apologise as I am not that computer literate.\n\nA: You can do it. First thing you need to make sure that your old iPad has the latest iOS, you can check in in Settings > General > About, check the version it should be 8.0 or above. After that you need to plug in your old iPad to your computer and in iTunes click on your iPad and in the Backups section select this computer and click back up now. After back up is done you can connect your new iPad Air 2 and select restore from back up. All your photos, contacts, emails etc should appear on your new iPad. \nIf you old iPad cannot run iOS 8 than I suggest you to enable iCloud on your old iPad, you can do it in Settings > iCloud and tick everything that you are willing to transfer to the new iPad Air 2.

Can I download Google Chrome on my Mac and switch between it and Safari? I have a website update I need to do and don't want to change my mac but must use Google Chrome for the updates.\n\nA: You can install Google Chrome and use it side by side with other browsers such as Safari (built-in), Firefox (need to download & install), and Opera (need to download & install).\nOne of the browsers will need to be set as your default.  This can be changed in System Preferences > General.\nIt's worth noting, Safari is the default browser in all versions of OS X and iOS.  Google Chrome is also a browser, and Yosemite is an operating system.  Your question is a bit misguided.  You don't necessarily \"switch between Google Chrome and Yosemite\".  That said, if you're talking about editing a website via online tools through web hosting providers such as Squarespace, presuming they support Chrome they'll also likely support Safari.  I'd suggest first trying to update the site in Safari before you download and install a browser which you may not even need.\n", "Q: Can I make a shared link in Mail.app appear above my signature?

I've decided that I want to use CTRL+V, CTRL+C and similar instead of CMD because I work half of the day with Windows and it's impossible for me to easily switch off my habits every half a day. I've considered 2 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*final switch between CTRL and CMD which had a lot of consequences that I didn't wanted to tackle\n\n*switching on Shorcuts option available at System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts and adding here any \"special\" shortcuts on per app basis. \n\n\nI've used 2nd option. This generally works fine. I've added things like Copy, Cut, Undo Paste and so on mostly mimicking what I have on my Windows machines. And everything seems to be working fine except one small detail \"CTRL+V\" paste. It only works as a PASTE until the email I'm creating fits on page. When there's a lot of text.. the CTRL+V becomes Page Down button. It's like CTRL+V in the Mail app is hardcoded to be Page Down and the shorcuts seems to be working fine until CTRL+V is able to actually behave as Page Down then it stops working. \nHow do I disable Page Down (CTRL+V) behaviour as described above?\n\nA: I run into same issue: At work I have to use Windows and at home I use a Mac. I'm sick of having different shortcuts for these basic tasks. Here is my solution for it:\nGo to your User folder on your Mac and open the Library directory.\nHere you create a \"KeyBindings\" folder.\nThen navigate into that folder:\n(Your User folder)/Library/KeyBindings/\nCreate a file \"DefaultKeyBinding.dict\" with following lines:\n\"^v\" = \"paste:\";\n\"^c\" = \"copy:\";\n\"^x\" = \"cut:\";\n\"^z\" = \"undo:\";\n\nSave everything and restart your Mac.\nNow, you will have CTRL + x/c/v/z working like it is on a Windows machine.\nThis will change the behaviour for page down as requested by MadBoy.\n\nA: There's a much easier and more effective way to do this: go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard tab and click the \"Modifier Keys...\" button. \nFrom there, you can set the Control key to behave like the Command key:\n\n\nA: Karabiner\nThis will do exactly what you're looking for, I think this is the setting you're looking for too.\n\n\nA: Create or edit the file: ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.Dict (may need to create the folders as well) to contain the text:\n{\"^v\" = noop:;}\n\nYou will then need to close and re-open the programs that you were have problems with.\n", "Q: Does the App Store update Java, if installed?

I have a mac book pro that is crashing everytime I logged in (with every users). The cause may be that my gf put so many pictures and video on the hard drive that it can't even start (from the restore utility, it has 40mb of free space).\nI am looking for a way to recover the data from the hard drive , before I can restore it with a clean setup.\nI have done it previously on windows partition by using a live linux distro and copying to an external drive, but the mac book doesn't seem to recognize it. Is there a trick ? Or a way to access the console from the login screen ? Maybe a way to mount and extract data from a recovery image I would create from the recovery partition. I am at lost here,\nThank you in advance for your advices \n\nA: Your response indicates that you can boot into the recovery partition so I am making that assumption for this answer.\nIf you can boot into the recovery partition (accomplished by holding down Command+R while your computer is booting), there are a couple things that may work. Either using Disk Utility to create a disk image (easy but time-consuming) or using the terminal to transfer files (hard if you're not comfortable with the command line but more likely to work).\nTo create a disk image:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect an external hard drive to your computer, then boot into recovery mode by holding down Command+R at boot until you see the Apple logo.\n\n*Choose a language, then select Disk Utility from the options you are presented with.\n\n*In Disk Utility, you should see a list of all disks connected to your computer on the left-hand side. Choose the one that says Macintosh HD (or whatever you call your HD).\n\n*Click the New Image button from the top of the window.\n\n*Change the Where field to your external hard drive but leave the other settings alone (Image Format: compressed, Encryption: none), then click Save.\n\n*It will take quite a while if it works but, once done, you will have a mountable disk image containing all of the files from your computer. Test it by opening it on a working computer before erasing your HD though (I've made that mistake before).\n\n\nIf that fails, you can use Terminal to transfer files from the recovery partition by following these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect an external hard drive to your computer, then boot into recovery mode by holding down Command+R at boot until you see the Apple logo.\n\n*Choose a language, then click on the Utilities menu option from the menu bar and select Terminal.\n\n*Once in the terminal, you can use standard terminal commands to find and copy data from your internal drive to your external drive.\n\n\nI can add more info on using the Finder to copy files if you need it but this is a useful primer.\n", "Q: How to check is Chrome is running in incognito mode using Applescript?

I have the exact same numbers and i'm doing the exact same thing for sending its.\n\n\nI wish to get back that feature to know when an sms is delivered or not.\nAny help appreciated.\n\nA: The short answer is you can't; Unless the standards have changed since I retired as a mobile planner 12 years ago.\nSome networks do provide confirmation (Vodafone in Australia did). Once a SMS leaves the originating network there is no way of checking on it. \n\nA: In canada, with a Rogers carrier, using iPhone, i start messages with \" !\", an exclamation point, and I get confirmation that a message was sent.\nie:  \" ! Tom are you home\"\na message then follows confirming I sent message to XXX-XXX-XXXX\n\nA: To add to what dave said, send a message with airplane mode on (or when you're far enough underground that there wont be enough signal to send it), and youll see an exclamation point appear to the side of it (eventually if not immediately). There is no way, as far as i know, to get an explicit \"your message is sent (so whoever said it didnt is lying)\" message. Now that i think about it, maybe thats so apple doesn't seem like the bad guy in situations like that. Sort of a best of both worlds thing: we would've told you if it didn't send, but were not gonna take sides here.\nIn actuality they probably didn't give it much thought and putting a 'indicator' every time a message doesn't send makes a lot more sense than putting a an 'indicator' every time one does, (as the majority of the time peoples messages are sent). Also in case i have to explicitly say it, the implication is that if it does not have an exclamation point, then as far as the people at apple are concerned, it has sent. (As opposed to 'whats app' for example, which gives you those check marks to tell you something went through. Apples equivalent is nothing at all. You will only see something if it does not work.)\nNot sent: \n\nSent:\n\n\nA: Tap “Settings” on the Home screen and go to  “Messages.”\nTap the “Off” button within the iMessage section of the Messages screen so that the button reads “On.”\nTap the “Off” button in the Send Read Receipts section so that it reads “On.”\nTap “Settings” to save your preferences and return to the Settings screen.\n\nA: Using any phone, start your messages with \"*0#\" then you are going to get your delivery confirmation.\n", "Q: Bose QuietComfort 20 not working after Yosemite upgrade I have a mid-2012 MacBook Pro Retina, and am using QuietComfort20 headphones that previously used to work.\nNow, after a clean install of OS X Yosemite, I'm unable to use the headphones, no audio comes through them at all.\nWhen I adjust the volume use F11 or F12 I get the following \n\n\nA: Seems that the Audio Output selector was \"Parallels Access Audio\".

So either your built-in ethernet or your wireless card leads depending on your gateway settings to a target. Both may be in effect but not at the same time to one and the same target.\nHowever a second ethernet card added to an expansion slot (e.g. ExpressCard/34) may be bonded to your internal ethernet card. This is known as Link Aggregation or Port Bonding and Port Teaming. Both have to master LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol) or IEEE 802.1ax and IEEE 802.3ad though. And the switch at the other end needs to support it also and usually has to be configured for it on your two ports.\nThe latest Mac Pro as well as the older ones with 2 NICs are capable of doing such right out of the box.\n", "Q: Mountain Lion -- Finder always freezing I'm on 10.8.2.

The light is usually activated by scroll lock being enabled, but in OS X, there is no such thing as scroll lock.\n\nA: Summary: solve by downloading Apple's keyboard LED test tool, which tests keyboard lights by enabling scroll lock, num lock and caps lock.  Make a keyboard shortcut that runs a script that runs the LED test tool and terminates the script while scroll lock is on.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go here:  https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/samplecode/HID_LED_test_tool/Introduction/Intro.html\n\n*Click the little \"Download sample code\" button\n\n*Open the downloaded folder and go to Build / Release\n\n*Drag the HID LED test tool file to your Applications folder\n\n*Launch the OS X \"Automator\" program\n\n*Choose \"Service\" document type\n\n*Under \"Library\", click \"Utilities\", and drag \"Run Shell Script\" to the blank area / workflow pane.\n\n*For \"selected service receives\" choose \"no input\" in \"any application\" (important)\n\n*For \"pass input\" choose \"as arguments\" (important)\n\n*For \"shell\" choose \"/bin/bash\"\n\n*Paste in this script:\n/Applications/HID\\ LED\\ test\\ tool &\npid=$!\nsleep 3\nkill $pid\n\n\n*Click \"run\" to test.

If nothing happens, test by clicking \"Play\" in the automator if you skipped that part.  If that doesn't work, the bash script may need to be updated, or maybe the path to the LED test tool is wrong.  Then double check steps 8 and 9.  Lastly, try making an automator document that does a \"Launch Application\" command instead of a bash script, and see if you can get any program at all to launch, such as TextEdit, using a keyboard shortcut.\n\nA: I have created a fork of the apple LED test script specifically to turn on and off the LED Backlight on cmstorm keyboards.

System becomes unusably slow while zoomed in (8-12fps, while still trying to \"catch up\" on missed frames). It takes a long time to \"recover\" from a zoom by zooming back out.\n\n\nHardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013)\n\n*According to other sources, this seems to affect all Mac hardware running Yosemite\n\n\nThis has been reported on the Apple discussion forums multiple times: one\ntwo\nthree\nfour\nI have not been able to find any acceptable solution.\nNote that zoom performance is \"perfect\" (read: acceptable) once the external monitor is disconnected. It is also \"perfect\" when mirroring is used.\nEdit: Removed link to http://testufo.com as it's too fragile under normal circumstances to be a useful reproduction.\nEdit 2, Nov 18 2014: After upgrading to Yosemite 10.10.1, the performance is slightly improved, but still not up to previous standards. For example, go to https://kraken.io/ and move your mouse over the image slider. Then try doing the same thing zoomed in - it's unbearably slow. It feels like when zoom is activated (on multiple screens), it drops down to software rendering or something equally slow. The same test with only the single screen is perfect.\nEdit 3: Other workarounds that have been suggested have had poor results:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart (or kill the WindowServer process, which will log you out). The first few minutes of usage are comparatively smooth, but still not 100%.\n\n\nEdit 4: Enabling Increase contrast seems to be the best workaround so far. See my 2nd answer.\nEdit 5: This is now completely fixed in 10.10.2.\n\nA: After upgrading to Yosemite I've also been getting extremely slow response in a number of different situations such as long pauses for Spotlight to return file matches, slow start up of applications especially after waking from Display Sleep, as well as other operations. (It feels like walking in quicksand and finding you can't move like you could.) Also, I've been seeing console logs filled with repeated messages regarding invalid connections and dumps of mismatched trackpad gestures, sometimes with the nearly the same message filling an entire 4000 line console view. I think I've now found the cause, at least for my iMac so I'm putting it here to see if it's the cause of similar problems for others around slowness after switching to Yosemite slow issues.\nI was digging through my user Preferences folder (in ~/Library Preferences) skimming random preference files to occupy myself while trying to get another idea of what to do next. (Trying to work had become really tedious). In com.apple.sidebarlists.plist, I stumbled upon a key with a value that continued after paging down quite a ways and then noticing that the scroll bar was still near the beginning of the file. I checked the file size and it was 11 MB (most of the preference files were much smaller than 100 KB, many being less than 10 KB in length). Trying to look at the file in Xcode was nearly impossible due to the sluggishness so I dumped it into a text property list to edit and found several keys with huge values, all with the key name of Bookmark (6 key values were just over 2.7 MB bytes long and 2 others were just under 4.3 MB long). Several of these were associated with external USB volumes, one with a volume that no longer existed and one with a volume that was a partition on the system drive; most if not all also had a short Alias key that existed for every volume described in this file. After many lost hours from my botched up attempt to edit the file to remove the problem sections (which I don't recommend) leaving my machine unable to boot up, I finally trashed the file. Since then all of the bothersome delays are gone (hopefully for good).\nI can easily see how it might have slowed Spotlight (that felt like waiting on a drive to spin up) since opening the Spotlight Finder window probably required reading the \"sidebarlists\" preferences to determine how to display the window and would take a while to read through the sequential data (similar to the slow down when I read or edited the file myself. Now that preference file is a lean 7 KB (about 1,570 times smaller than it was) and it feels great…as light and fast as it was running OS X 10.9 (Mavericks).\nHere's a summary of what to look at and possibly do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open /Users/(username)/Library/Preferences (~/Library/Preferences) in a Finder window; change to  list view and sort the files by size.\n\n*Check to see if com.apple.sidebarlists.plist or possibly any of the preference files is much larger than most of the others.\n\n*If you find any excessively large files move them out of the folder and put them somewhere (such as in a new folder you create on the Desktop). This won't cause any problem since it will be recreated when you restart though you may have to reset some of the Sidebar settings to your liking using Finder -> Preferences. \n\n*Restart your machine (or relaunch the Finder) and see if the speed issues have improved. If so, keep track of whether things remain better (how could you not?)\n\n*Whether or not it works it would be good for me and others to know so that we can help end this problem those affected in this way or determine that this isn't the cause and continue to determine just what is wrong, if possible.\n\n\nI do hope it helps as it has for me (so far) since writing this post would have been unbearable if the same slowness still existed!\n\nA: This is now fixed in OS X 10.10.2\n\nA: There is a workaround posted on the Apple forums.\nPros:\n\n\n*\n\n*The mouse/key entry performance does \"feel\" significantly better, as does the momentum zoom. \n\n*Zoom is per-screen, rather than both at once\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is still not nearly as performant as it was in Mavericks. The testufo.com site will still not render at 60fps while zooming.\n\n*While this workaround does make multiple-screen performance somewhat better in Yosemite, it makes single-screen performance much worse! Single screen performance is already \"perfect\" using the default \"Full Screen\" zoom and this is a step backwards.\n\n\nInstructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*In System Preferences-Accessibility, set the Zoom Style to Picture-in-picture.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Click More Options...\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Click Adjust Size and Location\n\n*You will see a rectangular magnified panel with an \"OK\" button in the middle. Drag the corners to the upper-left and bottom-right corners of the screen. Click OK.\n\n\nNow, when you zoom, it is usable, but still noticeably slow.\n\nA: Best workaround so far:\nIn System Preferences-Accessibility, select Increase contrast (which will implicitly select Reduce transparency). This seems to improve performance in some circumstances, but it does dramatically affects aesthetics. The slider on http://kraken.io is smooth while zoomed in. There are still some circumstances where zooming is a little sluggish, but it is not nearly as bad as before.\nEdit: After several hours of running with Increase contrast enabled (and upgrading to Yosemite 10.10.1), I can say performance is now back to an acceptable level.\nI'm still not thrilled about having to enable an accessibility feature I don't want or need to improve performance. I really don't like the appearance of Increase contrast: solid black outlines around text inputs & buttons, the zebra-stripe effect on lists, etc. is all a bit jarring coming from the subtlety of OS X.\nI tried just enabling Reduce transparency (which gets implicitly selected when you enable Increase contrast) but that setting alone doesn't help: both need to be enabled to see any performance gain.\nScreenshot: Normal appearance\n\nScreenshot: Appearance with 'Increase contrast' enabled\n\n\nA: FWIW, my experience is identical in all scenarios you describe (The original and both work-arounds). I'm using 10.10.1 on a 2014 Mini CoreI7 with 16GB of RAM and an SSD with two external 24\" displays. I do see a very slight lag on the kraken.io site, but nothing awful.\nSome ideas on further troubleshooting steps — Each of these steps aim to reduce the resources needed to render the screens.\n\n\n*\n\n*Try going down to thousands of colors in displays.\n\n*Try reducing the screen resolutions for each of your displays\n\n*Try changing the arrangement of your screens so they are stacked vertically. — (I'm guessing that by reducing the largest dimension of the combined screens' offscreen buffer you'll see a decrease in memory needed to render it; I'm not familiar enough with modern GPUs though to know how they optimize memory usage and this may have little or no effect. The reasons this would have helped in the past may no longer apply today.)\nEven if these help, I get they probably won't be a practical solution for you. I offer them mainly as a way to try and diagnose the underlying issue. Wish I could offer more.\n\nA: I noticed your post. I've upgraded my main production hdd up to yosemite a little early. I ended up running mavericks from an external drive and accessing yosemite just for files as the hdd is still inside my macPro. Now I am booted back up to yosemite as it is getting updates and acting a little better (slowly). So some things are working better, but i am still trying to debug things and I believe I just figured out how to get my cpu back a lot from the windowserver thread. Just go to accessibility and turn off all zoom features. I think that having, in my case, zoom with the ctrl+scroll wheel turned on, that it was rendering everything in a zoomed level as well as the current level, so it would be ready if i were to click ctrl and zoom in on something. when i turned this off, the computer's cpu jumped right back down to an acceptable level. its insane that mavericks runs better off a usb2.0 hdd than ribboned right into the logicboard. Also, after i turned this zoom stuff off, i clicked increase contrast and it didn't make much of a difference from the gain that i already got. it makes the os look like crap, so i turned it back off to get my blur back in the UI. hope this helps. sorry for my capitalization, i just don't really feel like it atm. :)\n\nA: Two monitors, transparency off. I've have trouble with horribly laggy control-magic mouse zooming since updating to Yosemite. Sometimes it'll take as much as 5 seconds for a simple screen zoom to complete. Trying to de-zoom while the Mac is off doing it's zoom thing sometimes just adds to the problem.\nMonitor level zoom is much better behaved if I set Scrolling to \"without inertia\" in the Mouse options dialog of the Mouse & Trackpad pane of the Accessibility System Preferences.\nZoom is now snappy, and stops when I stop moving my finger on the mouse. For that, I can live without the occasionally useful \"mouse inertia\" feature.\n-Maybe Apple will get around to fixing the inertia problem, but til then this seems the best solution.\n\nA: On my Catalina (10.15.7), the problem still remains; WindowServer uses between 12% to 27%. I have a 4K monitor (BenQ PD3220U) attached, and it seems like macOS has a problem with that:\nIn a related post I saw that when checking logs with the command:\nlog stream --predicate '(process == \"WindowServer\")' --debug\n\nI get:\n2020-11-16 20:34:43.764462+0100 0x525      Debug       0x0                  378    0 \nWindowServer: (CoreDisplay) [com.apple.CoreDisplay:default] [DEBUG] - On display\n0x04280880, surface is not detached, CoreDisplay is detached (0x00000000), \nDetachCode = 0\n\nThese are logged at a rate of 10-30 rows per second, depending on the scaling set on the external monitor.\nThe (sad) solution that worked for me was to give up the MBP internal monitor; by shutting the lid there is no more frantic logging, the fans stops and WindowServer is calming down. Sweet silence, but not happy for losing a screen.\n\nA: I'm sure this won't work for everyone, but for me all I did was bring up display preferences and change it to mirror my displays, then changed it back to separate displays.  WindowServer's CPU dropped immediately from about 80% to 10%.\n", "Q: Do I have a Recovery HD? I replaced my MBPs HDD with an SSD and put the HDD in the optical bay.

Firstly, the SSD which was formerly /dev/disk0 has now moved to the end. I recently encrypted it, I don't know if that has anything to do with it. Second, the same drive is also listed above as /dev/disk1, evident by the  size of it (120GB Samsung EVO).\nThird, there is a mysterious Apple_Boot Boot OS X partition on the HDD, I do not know what that is. But the point of this question is the presence of a Recovery HD partition on the HDD.\nWhen I hold CMD-R at boot to start recovery, it puts me straight to internet recovery (unless I connect my backup disk), which probably means no recovery partition has been found. The Disk Utility GUI also does not show one (debug enabled)\n\nI was under the impression that the installer creates a new recovery hd if not present, does the one for Yosemite not do that? And if no, why does diskutil list this Recovery HD which seemingly cannot be used for recovery?\n\nA: With the encryption process included in Yosemite there is a duplicate drive created in the space after the drive that was encrypted. If I'm entirely honest I don't know how that works or what its purpose is I just know that every encrypted machine in this situation has it. That being said you can see using diskutil that your ssd does have a recovery drive on it. Disk Utility no longer shows that in its list. So... not a lot of science to back it up but all signs point to a proper install having occurred and the recovery partition being right where it should be.\n", "Q: How to use the antishake option for iMovie I have a .mp4 video clip recorded with a GoPro camera, that I like to stabilize. I want to use iMovie, which I understand should have an antishake function according to this information.\nIn iMovie I apperently can't chose the antishake function, I can see the icon, but it's grey and can't be selected?\nDoes anybody know the reason for this and how to fix it? I dont want to buy new software and would prefer to use iMovie.\nAs an extra info, I use Yosemite and Macbook Pro.\n\nA: Not sure if anyone is still looking for the answer to this but as far as yosemite is concerned these answers are wrong.  You simply drag the clip or movie into the timeline as normal and click either the entire clip or section that you want and then you click on enhance.  Once you do that you now make sure to click on the video camera icon and the option for Stabilize Shaky Video will show and you can select it \n\nA: Via http://www.wondershare.com/imovie/stabilize-shaky-videos-in-imovie.html:\n\nChoose a video clip either from the Event browser or project. You can apply the Analyze for stabilization to the whole event or just to the video clips you want to apply. You can stabilize the video clips first, and then drag them to the project or stabilize the video clips in the project. You can go to File > Analyze Video > Stabilization from the iMovie menu to stabilize the video. \n\n\nA: Well, found the answer myself. The mistake was, that it's not enough to import the clip you want to edit, it needs to be included into an event. The procedure is therefor:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create \"Create New\", which is a container for the video to be uploaded. \n\n*Import video into the container just created. \n\n\nNow the video can be edited with antishake.\nHope the information will be helpfull to others.\n", "Q: How can I ensure TRIM is enabled when installing Yosemite onto an SSD drive? Im going to update my mid 2010 13\" MacBook Pro to an SSD drive (Samsund 840 250 GB). I am currently running Yosemite on my old HHD drive and was simply going to make a bootable USB with Yosemite on it to install onto the new SSD drive once I got it into my computer. But then this mess with TRIM and kext came to my attention. So, how can I get Yomsemite onto my new SSD drive so that it will recognize it?\nI've read a lot of threads saying to disable TRIM before upgrading to Yosemite but I didnt do that : ( Can I disable it now? Then make the bootable USB of Yosemite for my new SSD and install it with no problems? Somehow that seems too easy...\n\nA: If you're running OS X on a HDD then I don't see how TRIM enters the equation, since TRIM is only for SSDs. If want to do a fresh install on the SSD, simply install it and proceed with your bootable USB, I do not see the problem.\nWhat I did when installing the SSD was to put it in an enclosure, connect it via USB and  use Carbon Copy Cloner to clone the OS and some other stuff to the SSD, while leaving the big data (movies, music, etc.) on the HDD (which I then put in the optical bay). If you want to have certain parts of you user data on the HDD, you can create a symlink for that.\nIf you do not insist on a fresh install of OS X this is the way to go in my opinion.\nEDIT:\nA word on TRIM: \nThe issue with TRIM on OSX is that it is supported only for SSD installed by Apple themselves. So to enable TRIM on third-party SSDs, one needs the Trim Enabler app which does it for you. All was fine until the release of Yosemite. The Trim Enabler App uses a so-called kernel extension or kext (I think this is more or less the same thing as a driver, but I'm not sure). With Yosemite, Apple introduced kext signing which means no kernel extensions will be loaded which are not signed (which can be done only by Apple). Now the developer of Trim Enabler has no way to get his extension signed (Apple would not do that because if they did, no one had to buy SSDs from Apple to get TRIM, a policy which I find appalling). \nThe problem is that if you have TRIM enabled with the app and then try to boot a computer with kext signing enabled, it will refuse to boot since the TRIM extension is not signed. That makes it necessary to boot to recovery mode and disable kext signing from a command line.\nSo the only workaround is to disable kext signing altogether. This is a global setting, so it will apply to all possible kernel extensions which means you must be extra careful when installing drivers (which you probably never do on OS X) because it can't be verified they are trusted by Apple. But since the signing mechanism was only introduced in Yosemite, having it disabled does not put you more at risk than you were on Mavericks or before that.\nThe status of kext signing is saved in NVRAM, which can be reset accidentally (or manually). If reset, it will default to kext signing enabled and thus you will be unable to boot and must take the steps already outlined. \nWhatever you do, as long as you are able to boot into recovery mode, no permanent damage will arise from enabling TRIM.\nBut if you are not comfortable with the thought of having to go to recovery and type terminal commands, I would just stop worrying about TRIM and not use it, at the expense of some longevity and performance of your SSD.\nAll information on TRIM in conjunction with Yosemite is here. I do not know how this applies to you since you're on a HDD, but assuming that you have an SSD running with TRIM enabled through Trim Enabler, you should disable it before upgrading. \nI forgot to do that. What happened was that the installer ran successfully and I even got to the desktop afterwards, only after rebooting did the problem occur (grey stop sign at boot). I had no secondary computer to look up the commands listed in 2, but if you do, you can simply boot into recovery mode (hold CMD-R at boot) (either from your backup - which I hope you have - or from the Recovery HD if present, or the internet-based recovery), which will then allow you to open a terminal, run the commands, shut down and all will be working as kext signing will be disabled. You can then boot normally and choose to disable TRIM if you are uncomfortable with kext signing disabled (I see no reason to, since it did not exist before Yosemite) or just continue to use it.\n\nA: See my answer here: \nSince the release of 10.10.4, Apple now provides a new tool called trimforce, allowing users to activate TRIM also on unsupported disks. So now you can do: \nsudo trimforce enable\n\n\nA: Simple way: Download Yosemite from App store (5,12 Go)\nDownloading you will asked where to install Yosemite.

The problems with unsigned kexts will only affect users with third party SSDs, upgrading from a lower OSX version to Yosemite, and having enabled TRIM using Trim Enabler.\nYou have nothing you worry and, in case you decide to install Trim Enabler after the hardware upgrade, it will disable kext-signing checks during the install.\nYou have two major options for upgrading your hardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the existing partition/OS from your HDD to your SSD\n\n*Fresh installing Yosemite to the SSD and then installing all your needed programs and copying your documents/data.\n\n\nI would personally go for option 2 as it will help clean up the cruft that accumulated on one's computer overtime. It's also a good time to decide if it's worth reinstalling a bunch of apps that I probably only used once or twice.\n", "Q: How do I renew my Developer Program Account?

Is this about copying certain MIBs in /usr/share/snmp from one machine to another?\nThanks!\n\nA: Typically, you can use laLoadInt to get processor load, and hrMemorySize and related MIBS to get memory metrics.  However, my experience is that on Mac OS (at least, on 10.8.5), snmpd was compiled without kmem, because apparently apple doesn't support the calls.

How can I get my mouse to just work normally where a couple inches crosses the screen at a steady rate no matter how fast I move it?\n\nA: If you haven't already, go to Logitech support. Search for and download the support software for your specific model of mouse. Afterwards you should have a preference pane under System Preferences for Logitech which you can use to adjust the tracking speed of that peripheral.\n", "Q: Time Machine Changed My External Hard Drive's to MBR and now I can't access it!

I could have sworn that Google Hangouts used to provide a settings panel for testing and adjusting audio settings.  I know I've used it in the past: it was a facility that showed volume levels, let you play a test sound, etc.  Now I cannot find it anywhere.  After starting a video Hangout in the latest Safari or Chrome on OSX 10.9.5, clicking on the gear icon in the top portion of the screen brings up a dialog that has only the following options:\n\nThe only feature now is \"Play test sound\"; none of the submenus, or elsewhere in Hangouts as far as I can see, is there any ability to adjust volume, test that the microphone is working properly, etc.\nI feel I'm either a complete idiot now or dreamt the whole thing. What am I missing? How do I adjust sound settings for Google Hangouts? I really believe there used to be a more extensive preferences/settings panel than the one (the only one) I can find now.\n\nA: AFIK it is only possible \n(Hangouts On Air only) Audio setting: \nWhether you’re performing your favorite song in a Hangout On Air or just talking with a few friends, you can optimize the audio by going to your settings and choosing the sound setting that works best for you.\n", "Q: IP management throug Airport Extreme When I am traveling I need to be able to connect me to the office and get the same IP address as I have in the office. Would it be possible to configure this with an Airport Extreme and if so how?\nI understand that Airport Extreme can not act as a VPN server. If that's what I need - is there some recommendation on a simple VPN server that is reliable?\nRegards\nOscar\n\nA: The Airport Extreme (or Express or Time Capsule) don't have any VPN functionalities. I mean, apart from opening a port to let you access a VPN in your home network.\nSo, you will need some sort of server inside your home network. Mac OS has a VPN server but it doesn't have the most friendly interface (if it has an interface at all). Once upon a time I used iVPN (http://macserve.org.uk) to help me configure it. Otherwise, Apple Server also has a graphical interface.

No matter what I try, I can't get Applescript to automatically add yahoo as the smtp outgoing server. Here's my code:\ntell application \"Mail\"\n    set AccountName to \"account_name\"\n    set newacct to make new pop account with properties {name:AccountName, user name:\"account_name@yahoo.com\", server name:\"mail.yahoo.com\"}\n    tell newacct\n        set password to \"ThePassword\"\n        set full name to AccountName\n        set email addresses to {\"account_name@yahoo.com\"}\n        set port to 995\n        set uses ssl to true\n    end tell\n\n    set addsmtp to make new smtp server with properties {server name:\"smtp.mail.yahoo.com\", user name:\"account_name@yahoo.com\"}\n    tell addsmtp\n        set password to \"ThePassword\"\n        set uses ssl to true\n        set port to 465\n    end tell\n    set smtp server of newacct to addsmtp\nend tell\n\n\nA: Everything I've read (granted most of it, quite old) indicates that you need to include the words \"smtp server\" before \"addsmtp\", even though it should be quite obvious from the context.\nThere is also apparently a bug in the way AppleScript handles references to the new server.\nRemove from the first set smtp server to the end of the script, and replace with this:\n    set smtpservername to \"smtp.mail.yahoo.com\"\n    set smtpusername to \"account_name@yahoo.com\"\n    set addsmtp to make new smtp server with properties {server name: smtpservername}\n    tell addsmtp\n        set authentication to password\n        set password to \"ThePassword\"\n        set uses ssl to true\n        set port to 465\n        set user name to smtpusername\n    end tell\n    set newsmtpserver to smtp server (smtpservername & \":\" & smtpusername)\n    set smtp server of newacct to smtp server newsmtpserver\nend tell\n\n\nA: I know this question is old but I've been having some similar problems and found this question in my search for answers.  \nPerhaps this changed in recent version of macOS, but in the Mail AppleScript Dictionary in Catalina at least it appears that the correct syntax for setting the smtp/outgoing server for an imap account is:\nset delivery account of <imap account>...\n\nas opposed to the OPs:\nset smtp server of <imap account>...\n\nI haven't actually tried it myself because I'm having all kinds of other Mail AppleScript problems, which I'll post one or more separate questions about in a bit.  If anyone else can test this I'd love to confirm this solves the OPs problem.\n", "Q: How to change folder access if it says \"You have unknown access\"? I installed OSX Server and activated FTP for Downloads folder. Now folder looks like file in Finder and Downloads info looks badly. Also when i trying to delete Downloads, OSX required password and then said The operation can’t be completed because an unexpected error occurred (error code -8003).\nScreenshots:  \nOf course, first of all I disabled FTP and rebooted computer.

I am currently on 10.8.x. \nI want to be able to type where the insertion point (blinking I-bar) doesn't move but the text I type goes in front of it. \nSo for example imagine that | represents the current position of the I-bar, and I have the text \"[$path.'/to/my/folder'] = .\" in the clipboard.\nThen I have the following situation: \n$myPathArray| = '/rest/of/path';\n$myPathArray = '/rest/of/path';\n$myPathArray = '/rest/of/path';\n$myPathArray = '/rest/of/path';\n\nSee, I want to be able to place the insertion point where the | is above, then paste and have the text get inserted so that now I would be in the following situation without having to move the | myself:\n$myPathArray|[$path.'/to/my/folder'] = '/rest/of/path';\n$myPathArray = '/rest/of/path2';\n$myPathArray = '/rest/of/path3';\n$myPathArray = '/rest/of/path4';\n\nThat way I could just press down arrow one single time after pasting and be here:\n$myPathArray[$path.'/to/my/folder'] = '/rest/of/path';\n$myPathArray| = '/rest/of/path2';\n$myPathArray = '/rest/of/path3';\n$myPathArray = '/rest/of/path4';\n\nHow can I do that? \nIt would also be nice to be able to type stuff in so if I typed \"kcab\" at the insertion point I would go from this:\n|wards\n\nto this:\n|backwards\n\nI am using various text editors like PHPStorm and BBEdit but I would think these two types of text modes would be OS-level features.\n\nA: I have never seen such behavior on an OS level. This is likely because such behavior is normally needed for a very specialized task like programming or spreadsheeting, which would be better handled by individual applications.\nYou might be able to rig something up in Automator that could duplicate this behavior, but I suspect you probably want a different solution.\nYou can easily do what you need using Sublime Text's multiple select feature, without having the exact behavior that you describe.\nIn general, if your scripts are starting to get very repetitive, it's probably a better idea to figure out how to easily automate it, rather continue down the path of manual repetition.\n", "Q: Reminders won't sync to iPhone Running iOS 8.1 on an iPad mini, Yosemite on an Air, and 8.1 on a 5C.\nFor whatever reason, the 5C has stopped syncing reminders to/from iCloud. Works fine between the iPad and Air.\nSo far I've tried disabling reminder sync on the iPhone (not entire iCloud), and rebooted. When I open Reminders now everything is gone (expected) but none of the lists sync down. Reminders is stuck in a state where the only visible button is the \"New List +\" section, which does not react to taps.\nIf I turn off sync and open the app, I'm presented with \"New List +\" and a default empty \"Reminders\" sheet.\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\nPotentially related: iOS reminders app not syncing with Yosemite\nKind Regards,\n\nA: What worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable reminders in iCloud settings\n\n*Open reminders\n\n*On the default reminders list create a random task, e.g. \"Test\"\n\n*Re-enable reminders in iCloud settings\n\n*\"Merge\" reminders\n\n*Open reminders and wait for the sync to finish\n\n\nA: I had the same problem, until I realized that the in the iPhone's iCloud settings, Reminders is unchecked by default. So all I did - on my iPhone - was go to Settings > iCloud and then just activate Reminders. Within a few seconds all my Reminders between my iPhone and Mac were synced.\n\nA: on the date October 1, 2019 the problem is with Apple\n\niOS 13 came out a couple of weeks ago, but one thing you may have noticed is that Reminders no longer sync with Macs. Apple has now confirmed that Reminders won't update until its latest macOS update is made available.\nThe new version of Reminders for iPhone impressed us with its improvements in iOS 13.1. However, to sync Reminders between an iPhone and a Mac requires macOS 10.15, a.k.a. Catalina, which is released in the coming weeks.\n\n\nA: The only thing that worked for me was to fully sign out of icloud on the phone and deleting all icloud data off phone then signing in again to icloud. Reminders then sync'ed. \n\nA: There are limits to Calendars and Reminders on iCloud which must be followed. Reminders or lists which surpass those limits will not be synced, and will be reverted back to the previous state. Reminders below the limits will sync fine.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202158\nIn my case, my list title had over 100 characters in length, and some of my reminders had over 1000 characters in length. The list always reverted to \"New list\" (default name) after renaming, and the reminders were not synced at all, and would disappear from the device after a while.\nSo if some of your reminders or calendars aren't syncing, check if they are over the iCloud limits. As far as iCloud is concerned, \"Lists\" (inside Reminders app) and Calendars are the same thing (EKCalendar), so their limits are also the same.\nI know this is not the solution for jlindenbaum's specific problem, but I came to this question with iCloud sync problems and was wondering why it wasn't working even after having followed a lot of advice and different answers to this question. So my answer is to help people with the same problem I had with iCloud sync.\n\nA: For me, it turned out be the number of completed reminders - the limits. I deleted all my completed reminders, and it syncs properly now.\n", "Q: Why Are My Cache Files & Other \"Hidden\" Files/Folders Visible? & How Do I Get Rid Of Them?

My screen is stuck on one village and I can't get off it no matter which account I log into Gamecenter.  All of the devices now show just one of the four account game screens and the Gamecenter logins have no effect beyond the welcome back message.  The problem isn't just on one device, but all of them.

In desperation -- because we're a busy design and education company -- we purchased a brand spanking new 2014 27\" iMac. Beautiful machine. That was the easy part. And we bought the necessary cables to speed the transfer of data and applications from Firewire (G5) to Thunderbolt (iMac). \nNow here's the migration issue and request for help: In setting up the transfer of data from one machine to another, the procedure says to start Migration Assistant on both machines. The problem with the G5 is that the monitor is dead so there's no way to navigate to the Migration app in the Utilities folder. The Migration Assistant on the iMac therefore cannot locate the G5 and just spins endlessly.\nI just learned that on older PPC Macs you could restart the machine and hold the \"T\" key down to force it into target mode.

Soon after that I would be able to unlock the disk using my password and then boot in ~10 seconds.\nA couple of days ago, I installed rEFInd on a flash drive and then booted from it  as a test (I need the stick to boot into Ubuntu on my second drive and was in the process of reinstalling it). I was then in the rEFInd menu and chose one of the tiles (I think it was \"Boot Linux from 16GiB FAT volume\" or something like that). Naturally, since no Linux was actually installed, I was met by the black screen with the blinking cursor and powered the computer off by long-pressing the power button.\nEver since then, it takes almost 20 seconds for the Apple logo to appear after power on, even though the rEFInd stick is not connected. This triples my boot time and I see no reason why it should be so, since I did not change anything on the SSD.\nEdit: The process can be shortened by pressing ALT at boot, then manually selecting the SSD, after which booting will begin immediately.\nCan anybody tell me a) how to diagnose the problem and b) how to fix it?\n\nA: Turns out resetting PRAM and NVRAM via pressing ⌘+⌥+P+R at boot (before the gray screen appears; hold until computer restarts and the startup chime has been heard twice) fixes the problem.\nI have since successfully booted both OSX and Ubuntu via rEFInd without any excessive waiting.\n\nA: I had this happen with rEFInd before. I think rEFInd boatloader ended up in your efi partition. The excruciating long wait is rEFInd checking every device/partition to see if it's bootable.\nI have the debug menu in disk utility enabled, so I just selected show all partitions, mounted the efi partition from available partitions in the top left window, and removed rEFInd's .efi file. I also emptied the trash just to be sure.\nTo enable disk utility debug menu open terminal and run \"defaults write com.apple.DiskUtility DUDebugMenuEnabled 1\". rEFInd should have is own folder, so not delete anything from the apple folder or anything else for that matter.

Its has a SATA II port and now uses a HD Hitachi 7200rpm. In your opinions, if I'll upgrade, I can see an increase of performance or not?\nIn my project i've thinking to put SSD (250GB) in HD slot and buy an external case for HD in order to store photos and other big files.\nSurfing online I've found some forums talk about temperature sensor on HD. I didn't understand  which problem there are with this component. Can you explain me if there are problems?\n\nA: Here are some points from my Upgrade of my old iMac (late 2009, Model 10,1, #A1312) \n\n\n*\n\n*You can expect a significant Performance increase when starting Apps or saving Data, but overall-performance is depends on you RAM size too. If you are  working with Photoshop f.e. you should def. have more than 8GB (on 10.10) - the more the better.\n\n*You will encounter Problems with the Heat-Sensor. Apple uses a non-standard 3-Pin on the Hitachi HD to access the Heat-Sensor build into the Drive. Other HD or SSD will not have that, so you cannot connect the Heat-Sensor to the Mainboard. The result: the OS will turn up the Fan speed to a maximum, which is annoyingly loud. You can counter that effect with an additional Software to control the Fan speed, f.e. 'HDD-Fan Control' or 'iStat-Menu‘ and others.\n\n*In order to fasten the SSD, usually in a 2,5\" Format, into the internal 3,5-Slot of the iMac you need a Frame for the SSD. Annoyingly some of the Frames have Screw-Slots in which the Apple Srews do not fit. You should read the excellent visual Tutorial from iFixit for replacing the HDD (Link is for my Model, check your Model before attempting to follow it).    \nConclusion: even though it's a PITA, i never regretted doing it.\n\nA: I have an iMac late 2009 (21.5\") and just replaced the HDD by a Crucial SSD - MX200 with 500 GB. The instalation was easy because the connectors just fitted without issues. I had an bay bracked from Sabrent (model BK-HDDH) that makes very easy to fit. It will also work if you use a double sided tape to fix the SSD in place.\nI use the app SSD Fan Control to reduce the fan speed and it works like charm.\nVery happy with the result as all the operations are now much faster than before.\nMy next objective is to move the SSD to the optical bay and put an HDD back but I am still looking for an nice adapter for the slimline SATA conector.\n\nA: your idea is charming, but does not work with your system.\nWhat you can do is to add a ssd and merge it with the hd into a fusion drive using Apples on-board tool residing within the disk utility.\nIf you are running Yosemite it will be o. k to just start. if you are running Mavericks and willing to upgrade to Yosemite, DO THIS PRIOR ANY HARDWARE CONFIGURATION CHANGE. Built up the Fusion Drive afterwards!\nThere are two options. 1. Add the ssd atop the hd using a dedicated interface OR 2. Substitute the optical drive with a ssd.\n(Blame one if I am wrong, but a substitution of the hd a primary boot disk is possible with newer iMacs)\nI did it the second way because the optical drive was gone on my Mavericks ran mind-blasting fast with the fusion drive. After upgrading to Yosemite it now is slowed somewhat especially while shutting down. I did not had the time to rebuilt the fusion drive directly upon Yosemite but will do it!\nThe best description, including the spare parts and everything else you need, you can find at ifixit.com\nHope that helps\ntom\n", "Q: Does a purchased iTunes song contain my Apple ID?

I have no idea why it's picking up that URL. The only solution is to force quit that process and from then on Safari behaves normally until the next time I put my Mac to sleep.\nVery frustrating.\nBTW: the site is the site of a local private hospital, nothing special.\n\nA: Sorry it's not a solution, but just to reassure you that you're not going mad: I have the exact same problem, different URL, but similarly old and unvisited - it's not even an open tab or within top-sites.\nHowever, as well as peaking at 98% CPU usage, I also eventually get  the red error notice in Activity Monitor 'Safari Web content (not responding)' and everything slows down - although Safari is mostly still usable.\nI've tried disabling extensions and iCloud sync.

It found and facilitated removal of some scummy malware that had wormed its way in to Safari.

I have OS X set to require my password immediately after “sleep or screen saver begins” (and I'm assuming this includes display sleep). Since Mavericks, there seems to be a one-second grace period: if I trigger the screen saver or put the display to sleep, and then immediately hit the shift key or move the mouse, I'm dropped back into my account with no password prompt.\nI'm currently running Yosemite.0 (10.10.0). Is this a bug in Mavericks that never got fixed, or what? More importantly, how do I get it to require my password immediately?\n\nA: By design the first action system does is to save your work in a large file (depending what you had going on) so to be able to wake up exactly to where you left of. Once that is done the next step is to lock it with password.\nThat action does require time (writing the image), so if you are very quick you can catch your system in the writing action.\nHere is a example:\nClose lid-->\n11/15/14 07:54:30.000 WindowServer[86]: device_generate_desktop_screenshot: authw 0x0(0), shield 0x7fdfc2449050(2001)\n\n11/15/14 07:54:30.038 WindowServer[86]: device_generate_lock_screen_screenshot: authw 0x0(0), shield 0x7fdfc2449050(2001)\n\nOpen lid-->\n11/15/14 07:54:33.928 WindowServer[86]: CGXDisplayDidWakeNotification [174799469151647]: posting kCGSDisplayDidWake\n11/15/14 07:54:33.929 WindowServer[86]: handle_will_sleep_auth_and_shield_windows: Deferring.\n\n", "Q: Can I prevent a whatsapp text from being sent, if it hasn't yet been delivered?

She can select my shared folders as destination folder for her downloads (after login-in).\nBut when she creates a new folder into the Shared ones, the Permissions are changing.

This one is always lock (lock box checked) and lock icon.\nThe result is that Plex cannot add the freshly downloaded files and that I have to interfere into a normally automated process which is pointless.\nDon't need to add that I am using the \"Apply these settings to all content\" options...

Specifically, what display resolutions and pixel densities should I use for the icon_512x512@2x.png, icon_512x512.png, icon_256x256@2x.png, icon_256x256.png, icon_128x128@2x.png, icon_128x128.png, icon_64x64@2x.png, icon_64x64.png, icon_32x32@2x, icon_32x32.png, icon_16x16@2x.png, and icon_16x16.png images in my icon set?  \n\nA: Use the resolution given in the name of the image. For @2x images, double the resolution in both directions. PPI does not matter—Apple uses 72 PPI.

So after searching for a bit, I found a couple of sites that offered a step-by-step explanation on how to do it using rEFInd.\nI successfully installed it - I got the rEFInd startup screen and everything. The problem is that when I selected the USB drive I wanted to install from. It always got stuck on a black screen saying\n\nNo bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key\n\nBut that’s a different problem. After not being successful in booting from the USB drive, I had a “brilliant” idea. \nI could take the same image I flashed onto the USB drive and try to do the same but on the partition I had prepared for Linux, so then maybe rEFInd will be able to boot if it’s on the hard drive. So I did the following:\nsudo dd if=/path/to/downloaded.img of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m\n\nWith diskN being the partition on the hard drive, then restarted. And after that, the MacBook Pro never came back. It makes the chime sound, and that’s it. Also, I notice that Caps Lock and Eject keys don’t work, as I tried booting from a Linux CD and now I cannot eject it.\nStartup key combinations don’t work, so using the recovery partition is not an option. It only turns on, makes the chime sound and get’s stuck on a white or grayish screen.\nAny advice on how to solve this or ideas on what could have happened?\n\nA: After reading the comments I would try to use Internet Recovery (Command + Option + R) and see if that works.\n\nA: What worked for me was that I got a USB enclosure, formatted the “Linux” partition, uninstalled rEFInd with this command:\nsudo rm -r /EFI/refind\n\nAnd everything came back to normal.\n", "Q: Possible Methods to Restore Speed of File Sharing (AFP) in OS X 10.10? I have an iMac and a MacBook Pro under the same network connected through AFP file sharing protocol. Before I upgraded to OS X 10.10, the speed is very fast - copying a 200MB file would take a couple of seconds. Now as I have upgraded to 10.10, the speed slowed down drastically. When I copy a 200MB file it took me around 10 or 15 minutes. The iMac is connected to the router directly through Ethernet and the MacBook Pro is connected through wifi.\n\nA: AFP is more so meant for a LAN configuration and not a WAN network. Instead you could try CIFS or another protocol and see if you see the same speed or an increase.\nI would also try to use AirDrop and see how that works.\n", "Q: Option to use AirPort Express with 1 TB harddrive for Dropbox equivalent I have an AirPort Express with a 1 TB harddrive, obviously this airport is connected to the internet and in the next month our house will be conected to the optic fibre network giving us 200 megabits/seconds connection speed. Now to me this looks like a great opertunity to store some fairly large files on a shared disk.  \nOne problem is that the AirPort Express also functions as the backup device, so ideally we would only split of 100 GB so as to allow the other 900 GB to continue functioning as a Time Machine. Idealy this would be approachable from both inside and outside the network (with passwords!) so that I can connect to it from a university as well as at home.\nAdditionally the network has the following operating systems connected to it that would ideally also be able to connect to the harddrive: OS X Yosemite, Ubuntu 14.04, Windows 7 and probably in the near future a Linux Mint installation. \n\nA: You can surely do this but please not that doing so will void your Apple warranty with the Airport Extreme. \nWhat you need to do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pull the HDD out of the Time Capsule (take it apart)\n\n*Install the HDD in an enclosure or caddy\n\n*Connect the enclosure to your Mac\n\n*Use Disk Utility to create a 100GB partition\n\n*Reinstall the HDD in your Airport Extreme and you are good to go!\n\n\nWhen you partition the drive anything stored on it should not be affected since it is only resizing the current partition.\n\nA: I see some issues with your plan...\nDropbox is a 'share once, download many' solution. \nProviding your own 'file-server' is a 'share every single time' plan.\nIf your new connection is going to be 200Mb/s both ways & you also have a no-limit plan, then that may be all fair & good, but most domestic connections are 10:1 - that is, for every 10Mb download speed, you get 1Mb upload speed, so if you have a few people needing your shares, you'll quickly kill your connectivity.\n", "Q: Mavericks firewall does not keep my choices I'm on Mavericks and I run a python script to have a minimalist local server.  \nAnytime I launch the server the firewall popup comes in and asks me \"Do you want the application “python2.7” to accept incoming network connections?\" I click \"Allow\".\nI have inspected the Firewall Options from \"Security and Privacy\" and there is an entry \"Python\" that points to my virtualenv version of python that is marked as \"Allow incoming connections\".\nSo everything seems ok but this popup won't go away, it is always there anytime I launch the server.\nMight be a problem linked to the different virtualenv installations of python?\n\nA: It sounds like the problem is that virtualenv modifies the python binary when it copies it into the environment, invalidating the signature.\nTry to follow this and see if it resolves your issue: http://blog.movieos.org/post/63545845092/stop-my-os-x-firewall-complaining-about-a-virtualenv\n\nA: You can use a self-signed certificate for this.\nApple's code signing procedures page explains how to make one.

For example, there's this server based game. You delete the app, log out of gamecenter (since they claim to save your progress on the cloud) but once you redownload the app again, you return to where you left off. How is this possible?\n\nA: Developer access to the UDID was removed in iOS 6, so they are not (no longer?) using that.\nThe replacement was identifierForVendor. However, once the last app by a particular vendor is removed from a device, even if an app from that vendor is re-downloaded in the future, the identifierForVendor will change. So that's out too.\nGiven that a factory reset of a device will cause the link to break (according to various reports on the internet), the best guess is that SuperCell, or whomever, is using the advertisingIdentifier. This uniquely identifies the user, regardless of app vendor, and survives deletion of apps. The only time it changes is, you guessed it, during a factory reset.\n", "Q: I accidentally deleted an iMovie project, but I recovered it. Now it is too blurry to see!

If there are a lot of files in the trash, sometimes the Finder will display a progress bar saying (for example) \"Preparing to delete 62,736 files\", then another progress bar for the actual deletion. By comparison, deleting those same files from the command line is nearly instantaneous. \nWhat is the Finder doing that takes so long? Is it detrimental to my system to skip that by deleting files via rm?\n\nA: This is a case of \"destructive\" vs \"non-destructive\" editing of files.\nLike in old days of cutting and gluing together audio tape or film, editing then was destructive like RM command is. You type in the command, hit ENTER and RM is immediately executed.\nOn the other hand, moving files to the TRASH folder is just that, and the system responds, \"wait while I figure out how much stuff I need to move\". You pay in time for the ability to UNDO a possible accidental erase.

This is also doing the same for apps like steam that need to use accessibility features for in game overlays. \nI've tried several fixes, including re-installing apps, to no avail.\nIt seems that since the yosemite upgrade, it just doesn't seem to store preference information, like it's stuck in a certain state and nothing will override it.\nAny help out there please as it's becoming quite an annoyance!\n\nA: Sadly, adding the permission to the Firewall preference pane doesn't work.  It may work for one launch, but the problem returns when you quit and launch it again.  OS X doesn't like unsigned apps and will ignore your preferences for your own protection.  I had the same problem with Kodi and the only way around it was to sign the application yourself using the shell command prompt.\nsudo codesign --force --sign - /Applications/Steam.app/ \n\nYou will then have to OK it once to allow a connection, but it will then stop nagging you finally.\n\nA: If you turn on the firewall in OSX (Yosemite and El Capitan at least) by default the \"Automatically allow signed software to receive incoming connections\" option is ticked. Any software that is not signed will require confirmation each time it is launched to allow it to receive incoming connections.\nYou can check whether a piece of software is signed by running the following command against it in a Terminal window.

Wifi broke for some reason a long time ago on the 4s (the buttons are permanetly disabled).\nIs there anyway to connect to the internet? I have my phone plugged into a wifi enabled macbook but phone still has no internet connection.\n\nA: Is your iPhone 4s running (at least) iOS 7.1? If so, then I believe this support page from Apple should do the trick:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-ca/ts1559\nIf neither of Apple's instructions work, then one idea is to you back up your iPhone using iTunes and restore the device. I recommend making a clean restore. If the Wi-Fi works, then you can either leave it as it is or go ahead and restore again, but this time, using the backup that you made on iTunes.\nIf that still doesn't work, then... well, I don't usually recommend this, but you could jailbreak the iPhone and try a fix from there. I'm not entirely familiar with that process, but that's the only other thing that I can possibly suggest. Otherwise, you're out of luck (unless you want to try the Apple Store to get it fixed/replaced, but I think that it'd be a waste of your time).\n\nA: You can use the hot spot over Bluetooth, no wifi needed.\n", "Q: 2011 macbook pro blue screen I'm trying to determine whether I'm having a ram, drive, or board issue.

However I do not have such a credit card.\nMy question is: Can I browse or/and consume content in the ITunes store of a foreign country, where I have no credit card, bank account, etc. ?\n\nA: It depends on the country you will plan to open the account on. \nFor example, if you want to open an account on US or UK, you could select None as payment method. Payment methods you can use in the iTunes Store, Mac App Store, App Store, and iBooks Store, same website for UK.\nIf you want to open in in Spain, you don't have this option. ¿Qué métodos de pago puedo usar en el iTunes Store?.\nBest option is to open any websites I post before, go to the bottom of the page, select the country you want and check available options.\n\nA: You can browse any store without an account.

Alas, testflight requires the user's UDID which is obtainable only through iTunes on a Mac, which is cumbersome. We would like to be able to email users with app invites using their email address only.\nCan we use the iOS Developer Enterprise Program to let potential partners try the app using their email address only, without UDIDs involved?\n\nA: TestFlight do not require UDIDs any more. You can distribute apps with TestFlight without having the UDIDs of all those test devices. Just invite the testers by providing their email addresses. They will be able to join you. You need an Apple developer account (99 USD per year) to use TestFlight.\nAnd yes, with Developer Enterprise Program (299 USD per year), you can also distribute enterprise apps. You can distribute such apps to the users directly by just providing the Email address, and have them installed on the devices without any limits. Enterprise account does not require UDIDs. Know more about TestFlight, Developer Enterprise account and other options at Enterprise App Distribution - Hexnode blogs\n\nA: Yes, with an iOS Developer Enterprise Program membership you are able to distribute your app to devices without needing any device information.\nHowever, now that TestFlight is incorporated in all paid developer accounts, that's much preferable to solve the problem of managing test users than upping your account to enterprise. \n\nA: Also check out Diawi it might be an alternative but still \"official\" way https://www.diawi.com/\n\nOver-the-air installation of apps on iOS is based on tools and features provided officially by Apple: itms-service and a valid manifest file providing information on the app.\n\n", "Q: iPad volume isn't working My nan's iPad volume isn't working.

Try flipping that button, it should fix it :).\nIf not, I have no idea or advice.\n\nA: Did you tried to perform a power cycle?\nTo power cycle the iPad, hold the power switch down for 10 seconds until the power off slider appears on the front of the phone, you must continue to hold the top switch as you operate the power off slider. Wait a minute and turn the iPad back on with the switch.\nIf you are still experiencing problems, I would backup and reset the iPad to test it.

I would like to exclude specific words, like in google: (food -fast).\nAre there special boolean operations or shortcuts availble to be entered into the iOS mail app?\n\nA: If you search using Spotlight (from the Home screen), you can use to: and from: qualifiers, as well as flag and unread status.\nFrom Apple's iOS: Understanding Spotlight Search page:\n\nExamples:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Flagged june 2013\nSearches for all flagged messages from june 2013, as well as for messages containing these words\n  \n*Unread last week from:@icloud.com\nSearches all unread messages from last week where the sender's email ends with @icloud.com, as well as messages containing these words\n  \n*Vip read yesterday\nSearches all read messages from contacts marked as VIPs, as well as messages containing these words\n  \n*to:appleseed monday\nSearches all messages sent on Monday to a contact named \"Appleseed\", or an email address starting with appleseed, as well as messages containing these words\n\nNote that these examples mention \"messages containing these words\". A note above the examples states that to search message bodies, you must use Mail's search function, not Spotlight, but these examples are for Spotlight.

I am really confused. I don't have a lot apps or a lot pictures anymore so how do I sync iTunes with my iPhone so it will tell me how much storage space I have? \n\nA: This happens from time to time. You can get a recalculation of the space by connecting to iTunes and power cycling the phone.\nIf that doesn't work, you may need to back up the phone and erase it and set up as new - seeing that the space used is correct, then erase a second time and restore the backup.\n", "Q: Final Cut Pro 10.0.7 Yosemite Compatibility?

Is there an app to see what apps he is using along with how long he is on each app?\n\nA: Without installing additional applications (since is not your iPad after all), you could use the Battery consumption indicator that comes with iOS as a rough indicator how long a app was running- consuming battery. It does not tell you the time of usage but the amount.\nThe benefit is you will not be intrusive nor raise any suspicion from the \"user\" looking at the battery consumption, as compared to some tracking software, since the kids are very clever these days.\niOS 8 tells you what app is draining your iPhone's battery\nExample for 7 days (Clash of Clans is a game) and here you can see the heavy usage over a week that might help you managing the situation.\n\n\nA: You mentioned that it's a school-issued iPad. Many school districts use mobile device management packages, such as maas360 or Lightspeed to control these devices.\nYou may want to contact the school to see if they have any recommendations. \n\nA: Maybe its better to configure your router. You can control the access over it or you can give his iPad just access to some pages, which he will need for his homework. And after the homework is done, you can remove the access control. Is a little more work than installing an app, but it does really helps. \n\nA: If you are using Apple kit, use Airport Utility to prevent internet access during certain hours.

Intel 6 series chipset with 6GB for both HDD and optical bay interfaces which means SATA III (?). When I format the HDD through USB I can write to it via SATA, but Disk Utility suggest repairing. If I check this drive, Disk Utility cannot repair this drive. \nHow to resolve this problem?\nMacbook Pro 13\", late 2011\nI tried to repartition in two parts. The partitions are created, but before it is complete, and names are assigned to the partitions, Disk Utility fails. \nIntel 320 series works without problems in OptiBay, but it has SATA 2, so looks like a SATA problem. \n\nA: Have just faced a similar problem with MacBook Pro (17-inch, Early 2011) and SSD installed into the Optibay. Operating system: macOS 10.12.3 (16D32).\n«Disk Utility» got stuck on the «Waiting for partitions to activate» phase of the erasing process.\nThe solution, which worked for me, was to put the SSD into the main bay and the HDD into the Optibay.\n\nA: As of Nov. 2. 2014 there is a report regrading that problem.\nhttp://www.larryjordan.biz/caution-ssd-drives-and-yosemite/\nIf you own a 3rd-party SSD (Solid State Drive) unit and plan to upgrade to Yosemite – you NEED to read this.\nThe issue revolves around Trim utility software used by the SSD drive.\nFor possible fix read here.\nhttp://www.cindori.org/Trim-enabler-and-yosemite/\nhttp://blog.macsales.com/21641-with-an-owc-ssd-theres-no-need-for-Trim\n\nIn OS X 10.10 (Yosemite), Apple has introduced a new security\n  requirement called kext signing. (A kext is a kernel extension, or a\n  driver, in Mac OS X.)\n“Kext signing basically works by checking if all the drivers in the\n  system are unaltered by a third party, or approved by Apple. If they\n  have been modified, Yosemite will no longer load the driver. This is a\n  means of enforcing security, but also a way for Apple to control what\n  hardware that third party developers can release OS X support for.\n\n\nA: erase / format the SSD while still outside and connected via usb (sata to usb cable): GUID Partition table, Mac OS Extended (journaled).\nWhen you want to use the SSD as startup disk: use CarbonCopyCloner or SuperDuper to put a clone of the actual StartupDisk, when still outside, then swap with the HDD.\nDo not use Trim, some SSD controllers are not handling it very well.\n\nA: There was a firmware update for late model 13\" MacBook Pros, possibly just the 2012, that properly enabled the SATA 3 in the optibay. In all other (non Retina) MBPs it's safest to use only SATA 2 drives for stability in the optibay, even though they report as SATA 3. Your HDD should have worked in the optibay, but may have been faulty, unless it was SATA 3. \nSearch the OWC blogs for the many articles regarding the optibay issue. \n\nA: Intel datasheet for intel 540 ssd does not list macos as a supported op sys\n", "Q: in mac os x, how NOT to bring all the opened window of an application to front I have a problem with switching between windows in Mac OS X the way I use it.\nFor example, I have 2 opened windows of PDF files in the background, and on top of them there is another window of excel sheet. \nNow when I open a new window of PDF files, I don't want the other 2 windows of PDF that were in the background to come to front.\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: That's how Mac works.  \nAll windows belong to the same instance of the same app, unlike windows where it's possible to have each window inside a different process.\nThe simplest workaround is to duplicate the app you need 2 instances of & drag the file you wish to launch to one specific copy of that app.\nAlternatively, you might be able to do it in terminal or Applescript/shellscript, but you would need to pass the correct arguments to it on the fly...\ndo shell script \"\\\"/Applications/myApp.app/Contents/MacOS/myApp\\\" + arguments [at least file path]\nI'm not sure all apps will work with this method, I've only ever tried it with very specific structures with published command line switches.\n", "Q: Apache running on Yosemite not working as expected I plan to use both /Library/Webserver/Documents and ~username/Sites/.

I'm travelling from Australia to the US. Apple Pay isn't available in Australia yet. \nMy question is: Can I use Apple Pay in the US with an Australian AMEX?\n\nA: Short answer: No, you can't.\nLong answer: Apple Pay is, officially, US-only right now. However, it is possible to use Apple Pay in Australia:\n\nTo show the Apple Pay settings, simply open the Settings app on your iPhone (or iPad mini 3 or iPad Air 2), tap on General, Tap on Language & Region, and tap on ‘Region’.

It never plays anything or loads any files or URLs. But I can't figure out what is triggering it to open. Is there a log somewhere that shows why an app opened? Presumably it's due to a file association somewhere.\n\nA: This is a super old question, but I can admit to giving up looking for a source for a rather long time. It turns out (in my case) that the magic \"4th conductor\" within the headphone port that is used for the microphone also is used for the remote control. ie: Vol up/down, Play/Pause, Next/Prev, etc. This works by shorting that 4th conductor in various ways. When the cord for my headphones, with only 3 conductors, wiggled in it's loose fit, my laptop thought that I had pressed the play button, which triggered iTunes to open up.\n(I have also seen a similar thing happen with bluetooth headphones, as mentioned above.)\n\nA: I was also experiencing this issue. I had turned off all the auto downloads in iTunes. Then, in System Preferences, I \"delete\"d iTunes Helper - which did not delete anything and may not have had any effect. I discovered later that it was when I turned on/connected Bluetooth headphones that iTunes opened without any notice in the background. \nI haven't found a way around this yet, but at least I know what was causing it. \nThis was with iTunes 11.4 and OS X 10.9.5\nOf course this may or may not be what is happening with your set up. I would be interested to know if other things also cause this.\n\nA: I just had this problem start up. After an extremely frustrating troubleshooting process, I realized my Mac was accepting commands from my Logitech universal TV remote (which I was attempting to use with my TV). Every time I pressed the OK button on the remote, iTunes would start to play. I had never attempted to pair this remote with my Mac.\n\nA: One thing I can think of that might help is to Open Console.app and filter (upper right corner) for \"iTunes\".\nAnother thought:  Is there an iDevice that is wifi syncing periodically on the same network?  Not sure how to test that other than turning off wifi.\n\nA: As this is happening on my machine, I am guessing it is from a bluetooth speaker connection. As I've disabled any auto updates in itunes and removed the program from startup items. Also turned off any sharing on the computer. OSX 10.10.3  itunes 12.1.2.27. It's nothing really, but it's super annoying. \n\nA: I have experienced iTunes app opening on it's own, too. I believe the external speaker connection is the culprit as well. Though, I did not have head phones connected, I did have external speakers plugged in. \nI realized static electricity from a window fan directly next to my desk may've been responsible for the static & glitch. Avid users know to maintenance computer & auxiliary inputs against dust & static build up (i.e. avoid computer contact with carpet). Static electricity can flow from your finger tips too!  \nHaving lived through reel to reel tape decks to record & playback music, I used my tape head de-magnetizer to eliminate static build up from my computer, screen & cables.  I do not recommend using a de-magnetizer because it may damage the hard drive and/or corrupt or erase stored data.  \nThat said, a simpler & safer way to reduce and/or eliminate static charge to your computer & accessories might be to wipe w/ dryer sheet.  I can't attest to it's effectiveness but definitely think it's worth a try.\n\nA: In my case, it was definitely the external speaker/headphone connection. I plugged in external speakers and iTunes kept opening on its own. I unplugged the speakers, no further problem.\n\nA: if it's happening on your computer running the free program Malwarebytes might find and fix it -- if it finds any items have it remove them. Fast and easy. \n", "Q: Why does Yosemite add a number to my system name and how do I stop it? I named my system \"Foob\" on my 2012 MacBook Pro. Yosemite has renamed it \"Foob (4)\".

A friend recently updated to iOS 8 on his iPhone. The iPhone is jailbroken and has an iOS 8 supported iFile version installed.\nBefore the update he was able to start an app and then tab out to desktop, open iFile, find the app's .plist and exchange it for a different .plist. When he resumed the app the new .plist would take over and continue running the app.\nAfter update, he can tab out of app and exchange the .plists but when he tabs back into app, iFile reverts back to the original .plist file.\nMy question is, does iFile for iOS 8 have a cache that is storing .plist files in different places and if so, how do I go about locating them or is there possibly some options that can be turned off either in iOS 8 or in iFile that will stop this from happening?\n\nA: It's not iFile caching the property lists, it's iOS 8 doing this. For improved performance, preference files are not actually read from file often—only when necessary. Furthermore, the cache that iOS maintains can overwrite the stored property list files when necessary, meaning that it can be difficult to change preferences. SyncedPreferences also adds to the complexity, being that iCloud must update the key-value pair asynchronously with the iOS 8 cache. As far as I am aware, there is no way round this other than changing the property list when the app is guaranteed to not be storing its preferences in cache (i.e. just after a reboot).\n", "Q: OS X 10.9.x failed login attempts previous days I have found some answers on here but need to check something.

I didn't want to fill up the 2TB external hard drive used for Time Machine, so I excluded the folder that contained only the rebuilt library.  I now have deleted the old Library and want Time Machine to backup the new, rebuilt library, but it won't.  I moved the rebuilt library to the ~/Pictures/ folder and deleted the exclusion from Time Machine, but the Library doesn't get backed up.  I deleted the com.apple.timemachine.plist, formatted the external hard drive, and started all over with a new Time Machine backup, but the iPhoto library still won't get backed up by.  \nWhat's weird is that when the first Time Machine backup begins, it says the backup size will be ~1.1TB (which is correct), but once it's complete, the backup is only ~600GB (iPhoto library is ~500GB) I know Time Machine won't backup iPhoto if iPhoto is open.  iPhoto is closed the entire time.  \n\nA: I had the same issue.

It's more it less an order of operations, but should I format and encrypt the external hard drive first without any data and then run TM?\nI figured that way would be faster rather than TM having to encrypt the data on the fly.\n\nA: I'm not sure I understand what you are trying to do. A drive is encrypted only by virtue of receiving encrypted data, it does not encrypt anything itself. So if you write from your unencrypted disk to your encrypted one (via Time Machine), all data still has to be encrypted by your mac prior to being written to the external medium.\nSo I don't see why encrypting an empty drive before writing to it should change anything.\nThe reason why encryption does not noticeably impact performance is that the speed bottleneck in this business is the disk access, which is waaay costlier in terms of runtime than the encryption of the data. Modern processors even have specialised instructions to speed up e.g. AES which is used for Time Machine I think.

Any help would be appreciated. \n\nA: After trying to run the scripts suggested by other answers, unloading and reloading both the kext and the bluetooth daemon, my bluetooth still wasn't responding.\nHowever, I have discovered that if Yosemite sleeps with VMWare running and bluetooth doesn't work when the OS is woken up, closing VMWare rectifies the issue.\nIt seems that the drivers in VMWare don't always handle the sleep / wake process correctly.\n\nA: -- UPDATE: This problem is NOT fixed in OSX 10.11 El Capitan --\nThe following is an alternative to the Automator solution posted by webaholic, for those who, like me, find inconvenient having to entering your password again (most likely you'll have just entered it to logon after waking your Mac up).\nFirst, in Terminal, create a script that reloads the bluetooth subsystem:\ncat > bt_restart <<END\n#!/bin/sh\nkextunload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport && \\\nkextload   -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport\nEND\nchmod +x bt_restart\n\nSecond, make root its owner and move it to /sbin:\nsudo chown root:wheel bt_restart\nsudo mv bt_restart /usr/local/sbin\n\nThird, add the command to the list of NOPASSWD commands in sudoers:\necho -e \"\\n\\n# Restart bluetooth without password\\n$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/sbin/bt_restart\" | EDITOR='tee -a' sudo visudo\n\nFinally, create a script on your desktop that calls bt_restart:\necho '#!/usr/bin/sudo /usr/local/sbin/bt_restart' > ~/Desktop/\"Restart Bluetooth\"\nchmod +x ~/Desktop/\"Restart Bluetooth\"\n\nDone!

My mouse was called \"My Name's mouse\" with the apostrophe, maybe that was causing the errors.\nI have changed the name to avoid using spaces and special characters, now is called just \"mymouse\" and I don't seem to have the problem anymore.\n\nA: To summarize, here's a list of things mentioned here, in links from here, in similar threads at other sites, or even made up by me reasoning from those others. I've tried all of these, singly and in many combinations. All of them have seemed to work at least once; all have failed at least once.\n\n\n*\n\n*new mouse batteries\n\n*remove and re-pair mouse\n\n*turn off WiFi and mouse; connect Bluetooth mouse; restore WiFi\n\n*turn off WiFi, mouse, and VPN; connect; restore\n\n*delete Bluetooth PAN; connect\n\n*kextunload/load USBTransport; connect\n\n*wire kextunload to sleepwatcher; sleep; awake; connect\n\n*disconnect all USB connectors (heck, all connectors); connect\n\n*log out; log in; connect\n\n*restart; log in; connect\n\n*reset SMC (which involves \"shut down\"); restart; log in connect\n\n*shut down VM hosting (such as VMWare, Parallels, or VirtualBox)\n\n\nI choose to keep this list handy, and use \"all of the above.\"\nI think the only thing that's certain, here, is that there's a large dose of \"random\" involved somewhere, perhaps a race among all these drivers for networks, pseudo networks, layered networks, virtual networks, and proxy networks. In which case, it's probably not merely Apple's fault, because those drivers come from a variety of sources. \nOf course, Apple's once-famous \"just works\" reputation was largely built on forbidding exactly this kind of colliding diversity.\n\nA: I still have this issue in macOS Sierra. @Tyilo's link above to his gist gave me a starting point. But I also wanted to use homebrew to install sleepwatcher, and the plist files weren't set up properly out of the box. So I played around for a long time and came up with this script that got things working reliably for me.\nbrew install sleepwatcher\nsudo touch /etc/rc.sleep\nsudo tee -a /etc/rc.wakeup <<EOF\n#!/bin/sh\n# Sleepwatcher script to get bluetooth working after the mac wakes up\n# Got this approach from https://gist.github.com/Tyilo/c92684d277acb62272b5\nkextunload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport\nkextload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport\nEOF\nsudo chmod +x /etc/rc.wakeup\nbrew services start sleepwatcher\nsudo tee -a /Library/LaunchAgents/de.bernhard-baehr.sleepwatcher-20compatibility-custom.plist <<EOF\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>de.bernhard-baehr.sleepwatcher</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/usr/local/sbin/sleepwatcher</string>\n        <string>-V</string>\n        <string>-s /etc/rc.sleep</string>\n        <string>-w /etc/rc.wakeup</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\nEOF\nsudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/de.bernhard-baehr.sleepwatcher-20compatibility-custom.plist\n\n\nA: Thanks to Tyilo from the comments on the accepted answer, I have modified his script to install sleepwatcher and append to the script some code that will not only unload the Bluetooth driver (com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport), but also restart blued, Apple's Bluetooth daemon.\nThe script can be found here: https://gist.github.com/timgws/fc63aeca6a248bbb25ff\nRunning this has resolved all the issues for me.\n\nA: Aware that this is quite an old post now but was being driven nuts by the delay I was getting after sleep wake-up before the Magic Trackpad was usable.... could easily be a good 30 secs. Tried most / all of the hints and tips I could find to very little effect.\nHowever, I just tried moving the Bluetooth icon on the Menu bar (CMD ALT Drag) from its normal position (about 7th in ) to 2nd in (as counted from the Right), i.e. next to the Spotlight menu.\nSo far?... problem gone !\nNot 100% sure why this would be, but suspect it might be something to do with the order in which tasks from those items on the RHS Menu Bar are addressed after wake-up, i.e. those nearer RHS have higher priority?\nOnly takes a couple of secs to do, so if you also have this problem - might be worth a try?\n(iMac 27\" i7 / OS X 10.10.5)\nJH\n\nA: Most of the suggestion I've read seemed a bit complex for something as simple as this. Decided to take a noob approach:\n\n\n*\n\n*Went to System Preferences/Mouse/Set Up Bluetooth Mouse\n\n*Screen displayed \"No Mouse found\" and started searching.\n\n*Turned my mouse off then turned it on again (Windows solution to a myriad of problems).\n\n*It found my mouse.\n\n\nA: Looks like the kextunload commands don't actually work anymore on High Sierra. However, there's a 3rd party command line tool for doing the same thing and it works: https://github.com/toy/blueutil – you can tweak the scripts mentioned here to use blueutil instead, or there's even a full-blown solution (very similar to what we have seen on this page already): https://gist.github.com/ralph-hm/a65840c4f5e439b90170d735a89a863f\n\nA: This article by Michael Kummer reports a fairly exhaustive list of failed attempts to fix bluetooth problems on mac, and finally suggests a compromised solution by disabling handsoff that seems working: https://michaelkummer.com/technology/mac-bluetooth-issues-affect-keyboard-trackpad/\nAlso seen in https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradmoon/2017/07/13/this-trick-may-solve-your-mac-bluetooth-connectivity-issues/#6fefb3f45196\n\nA: Mikaey's solution on the apple support forum:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn your WiFi off\n\n*Try re-connecting to your bluetooth devices (should work)\n\n*Turn WiFi back on\n\n\nThis has solved the issue for me.\n\nA: Reinstall MacOS.\nThis is not really a solution solution but I just want to share my experience to give some hope to those who are facing the same problem as mine -- that this might still not be a hardware problem or wifi interference problem, which may be more costly or troublesome to solve that reinstalling MacOS.\nWhat I experienced: After my 2015 Macbook Pro woke up from sleep, it could not connect to bluetooth devices. The problem had worsen overtime, from initially just little inconvenience (e.g., disabling and re-enabling bluetooth module or wifi could fix it) to later a huge pain (e.g., requires a restart with SMC/PRAM reset).\nA symptom or side effect which might be related was that the computer sometimes took too long (10s of seconds) to wake up.\nReinstalling (clean) MacOS was my last resort but it seems to simply work. After reinstalling I did not observe any problem or hiccup with bluetooth, wifi, or sleeping.\nDisclaimer: There is probably some proper fix that can achieve the same effect, which may or may not have been discovered yet. Also, reinstalling OS always comes with risks of losing data and productivity that one should evaluate.\nNew update: It was problem-free for a week. But then the bluetooth problem seems to come back sometimes. I did not do much tinkering with the system in the week other than installing some very common software and packages mainly through Homebrew.\n\nA: Based on other people suggestions I created simple shell script to reset bluetooth. See gist for details. \nSimplified version (depends on blueutil brew):\nblueutil -p 0\nnetworksetup -setairportpower en0 off\nsleep 3\nnetworksetup -setairportpower en0 on\nsleep 3\nblueutil -p 1\n\nIt turns off bluetooth, turns off wi-fi, turns wi-fi back on, and finally turns bluetooth back on. \n\nA: UPDATE2: The last solution only worked for about a week. I have updated to macOS Mojave (10.14.6) and this issue appears to be fixed. Will monitor and report back if anything changes.\nUPDATE: I have been able to solve this 100% after observing for months by going to System Preferences -> General -> unchecking Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices\nSo I've been dealing with this on my Macbook Pro (Early 2015) for about as long as I've had it. Tried pretty much everything, kextunload/kextload, SMC reset, etc... to no avail. To be specific, my symptom is that after waking up sometime the bluetooth icon would have a squiggle through it like this:\n\nAnd would refuse to connect to any devices. This behavior was present on Yosemite as well as High Sierra (version I'm currently on).\nThe ONLY workaround that has worked with > 80% consistency for me (other than rebooting) is this:\nSystem Preferences -> Bluetooth -> Uncheck Show Bluetooth in menu bar -> Check Show Bluetooth in menu bar then wait 10 seconds (at this point your bluetooth should be available and not have the squiggle through the icon)-> retry connecting device.\nThis has worked 80% of the time for me although sometimes I still need a reboot. Hope this helps.\nUPDATE: This has prevented bluetooth unavailable but it appears bluetooth would just sometimes not connect / work even though the icon shows it's fine... Not really sure what to do any more. This seems like a problem Apple should investigate.\n\nA: Try clicking the mouse after your Mac wakes from sleep. \nThis seemed to connect my Magic Mouse 2 faster with a Mac Mini running macOS Sierra (10.12.2).\n", "Q: Filemaker 12 Trial Installer Is there an archive of old FileMaker Trial installers somewhere?

The problem only started a few months ago.  I'm currently running yosemite, but the problem started while on mavericks.  My battery cycle count is ~130.\nI tried completely discharging the battery and then re-charging, but that seems to have had no effect.  I've also read through apple's battery documentation, but I can't find anything there either.

From 100% I woke up the next day to find the battery at 28%.\nSo I dug up some research I had done and it comes to this command:\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25\nFrom examining your setting I see yours is not 25 but 3, if you have not found a solution for your problem, this could be it.\nHere is some additional read on this from the Apple Discussion Forums: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4729695?start=0&tstart=0\nYou can see some pros and cons of doing this. I quote the documented differences:\nhibernatemode = 3 by default on supported portables. The system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will power memory during sleep. The system will wake from memory, unless a power loss forces it to restore from disk image.\nhibernatemode = 25 The system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will remove power to memory. The system will restore from disk image. If you want \"hibernation\" - slower sleeps, slower wakes, and better battery life, you should use this setting.\nIf I notice better results I shall do well to post them here as backing evidence. Good luck!\n\nA: To better understand what is it doing during the sleep and what is consuming your battery:\nYour system is set to absolute sleep (no activity at all) for 4200 seconds (that is standard)\nYou have the \"womp - wake on ethernet magic packet\" enabled.\nUnless you need that, you can disable it with sudo pmset womp 0\nYou can look up the reason for wake by using the following in Terminal\nsyslog | grep -i \"Wake reason\"\n\nMore details are in the Console log.\nLook for activity that happens after you initiated the sleep and it starts about 4 hours after sleep begins with message like:\nkernel[0]: Wake reason: EC.SleepTimer (SleepTimer)\n\nNow look what is it doing after that line.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my MacBook Air. Tried different settings etc, didnt work. Then I noticed one pattern - If I had Chrome running, then this happens, but if I had quit chrome before closing the lid, then battery remains. So, thats what I am doing now. Making sure Chrome is not running when I close the lid.\n\nA: When any computer is asleep it still uses power to keep the ram fresh.  Another thing that macs do is to occasionally check for new emails and notifications even while asleep.  This feature is called power nap.  To turn that off, visit https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204032 for information.\nLeslie's advice will help even more with using hibernate instead of sleep.\n\nA: I had this issue with my new MacBook Pro once. I found that I had NoSleep enabled (even with the app closed). If you have NoSleep installed make sure you turn it off. \n\nA: I had this problem with my MBP and iMac 5K (wake up in sleep mode automatically. It was actually the Google Drive app's fault; after I removed it, the problem was solved.\n\nA: I had same issue, culprit was flux app. I disabled flux app and all os back to normal for me. \n\nA: I add another important reason: macbook Pro will not hibernate if SSD start up disk is installed in the optibay (in those models that used to have one).\nThe \"symptoms\": MacBook just didn't hibernate, did not turn off automatically after autopoweroff minutes in pmset, nor turned off if scheduled. The consequence of this, a very important battery drain overnight (around 5% per hour) that I just wasn't able to solve applying any pmset setting combination / SMC reset / PRAM reset / macOS clean installation / previous macOS versions. I also spent several hours trying to determine if any startup process prevented deep sleep / hibernation... nothing seemed to work, so I almost gave up and attributed this to a hardware malfunction.\nBut... the culprit was a start up SSD disk installed in a case replacing the superdrive, that is to say, installed in the optic bay.\nI simply changed the disks places, with the start up SSD connected to the native disk bay, and the issue was solved!\nHope it helps!!\n\nA: I had the same problem with MacBook Pro 13in 2017 model. But the battery drain and laptop being warm happened only when the laptop was sleep and the charger was connected but turned off. I didn't observe the problem when the laptop was disconnected from the charger during sleep.\nSo, I guess it must be an electrical issue(earthing).\n\nA: Basically, there are a number of apps, processes, settings etc that can prevent your mac from sleeping.  I wrote a little function that I have added to batch_profile and run manually to sleep my computer.  If sleep is being prevented the function will produce an audio alert.\n(note, it automatically closes apps that I know always prevent sleep and it also turns off bluetooth which is also often a problem).\nfunction slx {\n  echo \"...stopping any backups, closing any programmes known to cause issues\"\n  tmutil stopbackup\n  pkill -x qemu-system-i386\n  pkill -x qemu-system-x86_64\n  pkill -x Music\n  pkill -x VLC\n\n  echo \"...turning off bluetooth & ejecting external drive\"\n  blueutil --power 0\n#  diskutil eject /Volumes/SanDisk512TimeMachine\n\n  retry_count=0\n  max_retries=4\n  while true; do\n    canSleep=$(isPreventingSleep)\n    if [ $canSleep -eq 1 ]; then\n      echo \"success\"\n      break\n    else\n      retry_count=$(($retry_count+1))\n      if [ $retry_count -eq $max_retries ]; then\n        pmset -g assertions\n        blueutil --power 1\n        say \"cannot sleep\"\n        echo \"cannot sleep\"\n\n        break\n      fi\n      echo \"...trying again\"\n      sleep 4\n    fi\n  done\n}\n\nextractpmset() {\n  pmset -g assertions | awk 'NR>=3&&NR<=10' | grep -v \"UserIsActive\" | grep -v \"ExternalMedia\"\n  #pmset -g assertions | awk 'NR>=3&&NR<=10&&!/UserIsActive/'\n}\n\nisPreventingSleep() {\n    output=$(extractpmset)\n    if [[ $output == *\"1\"* ]]; then\n        echo \"1\"\n    else\n        echo \"0\"d\n    fi\n}\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/atreeon/c2d280576b2e95877d1d123efacd8066\nYou can also read man pmset and run pmset -g to check all your settings.  I went through every single one, changed a few and it seemed to do the job.\nAlso you can run pmset -g assertions to check if anything is preventing sleep.  On my machine ExternalMedia says it prevents sleep but in actual fact I don't think it does so I've excluded that from the list of things that could be preventing sleep.\nIMO, the function is what the mac should do automatically when you select sleep.\n", "Q: Spotlight/Search Not Indexing, MBP Running Too Hot Short version:\nSince installing Yosemite on my (mid'12) MacBook Pro, I have seen issues with battery life cut in half and the computer running excessively hot.\nSymptoms:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Activity Monitor, the mcs process is running at over 100% CPU on a regular basis. If I'm not mistaken, this is for the Spotlight/Search Indexing. Spotlight takes FOREVER to find anything.\n\n*Time Machine won't back up at all. It just hangs in the \"Preparing Backup\" stage. I figured out that if I temporarily kill the indexing process in Terminal, I can get a complete backup.\nThings I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*I even brought it to the closest Genius on Apple's recommendation. They didn't find anything wrong with the hardware, but they did want to put a new motherboard in it for over $500. I don't believe it's hardware.\n\n*I found that force quitting out of the mcs task in Activity Monitor, the temps drop about 10-12° back to normal operating temperatures.\n\n*I rebuilt the indices in Terminal, tried removing them, dropped the hard drive in and out of Spotlight pref panel, and everything else to get the index to rebuild itself properly.\n\n*I wiped the hard drive clean, re-formatted it and reinstalled Yosemite and everything else to see if I could get it to work.\nI can't install a Time Machine back to the time before Yosemite, way too much to lose. Anyone have any ideas?\n\nLong version:\nSince installing Yosemite on my (mid'12) MacBook Pro, I have seen issues with battery life cut in half and the computer running excessively hot. I have installed Macs Fan Control to keep track of the temps. It was running at about 88-90°C with no programs running at all, and in the mid 90s just turning on a browser. Previously, it never cracked 80°C unless I was pushing it hard in Photoshop or iMovie.\nI did all of the resets, reboots and restarts to chase down the issue, and a call with Apple tech support didn't find anything. I even brought it to the closest Genius on Apple's recommendation to run diagnostics on it. They didn't find anything wrong with the hardware, but they did want to put a new motherboard in it for over $500. I don't believe it's hardware.\nIn the Activity Monitor, we discovered the mcs process running at over 100% CPU on a regular basis. If I'm not mistaken, this is for the Spotlight/Search Indexing, which when asked to search for something, takes FOREVER to find anything. With Yosemite, tracking the indexing process is invisible to me, so I don't know what it's doing, but it seems like it is always indexing (through the Spotlight search for \"index\").\nAlso, to add fuel to this fire, Time Machine won't back up at all. It just hangs in the \"Preparing Backup\" stage. I figured out that if I temporarily kill the indexing process in Terminal, I can get a complete backup, so I have been doing that manually for the last few weeks, at least. Every once in a while, it will back-up if I don't kill the indexing process, so that's always fun to not have anything consistent causing issues.\nSo back to the heat. I can push the fans a bit in MFC to keep the temps down, but that seems like a Band-Aid. I found that force quitting out of the mcs task in Activity Monitor, the temps drop about 10-12° back to normal operating temperatures. So my belief is that there is an issue indexing and it's overworking the system. Pretty easy conclusion to come to.\nI rebuilt the indexes in Terminal, tried removing them, dropped the hard drive in and out of Spotlight pref panel, and everything else to get the index to rebuild itself properly. Nothing has allowed the indexing to calm down at all. Just using the Search feature for finding simple text files on the drive is a painful process. No, there is no AntiVirus software running, either.\nI have even gone full scorched Earth on the laptop. I wiped the hard drive clean, re-formatted it and reinstalled Yosemite and everything else to see if I could get it to work. I did this mostly in the name of Time Machine, but it's still pushing my buttons. The same issues are still happening with the index, heat and battery life.\nI'm out of intelligence and out of patience. I'm disappointed that I installed Yosemite, though it could be a coincidence (I doubt it). I'm open to all ideas at this point. I would just like to roll back my life to the day right before I decided to install Yosemite—everything worked, and I didn't spend my free time trying to solve Mac problems. And no, I can't install a Time Machine back to the time before Yosemite, way too much to lose.\nAnyone have any ideas?\nDoug\n\nA: Not much of a solution, but I did manage to get the heat down, the battery life back up, the search indexing and Time Machine all functioning again. How? I backed everything up, wiped the drive and re-installed the OS from scratch.\nMight have had a virus, might have been a broken app, may have been something else running uncontrollably in the background. Everything is not re-installed, but I'm running Mail, browsers and just about everything else, and the battery life is almost triple of what it was 3 days ago.\nDonno what it was, but the drastic solution worked.\nAlso, the temps are down around 55° regularly, from 88° to 96° with no applications running. Battery life is double of what it was 36 hours ago.\ndoug\n", "Q: can I use time machine to restore old icloud confirguration? by  mistake, i accidentally blocked my I cloud account.password, security codes, lost the lot.\nIs it possible to use the time machine to come back a few days ago when my passwords were still working? \n\nA: It's doubtful.  iCloud is locked on the server side, a TM restore would only restore your client side configuration.\n", "Q: View Full Path of Current Document in Apps Like Preview & TextEdit I'd like to be able to view the full path of a file, rather than just its file name, in document-based apps like Preview & TextEdit.

With it you can't run any unsigned drivers and old one is probably unsigned.\nYou might try to disable kext signing if you want to use the driver. Make sure you absolutely have to do it and you don't have other options since this change is system wide and system is becoming less secure after that.\nIn Terminal:\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"kext-dev-mode=1\"\n\nAnd reboot.

Neither are showing this note.\nWhat could be the problem? I've already synced by Google accounts too, on the OSX Notes at least.\n\nA: OS X Yosemite and iOS 8 have changed the way iCloud syncing works.

Have you done this? If so, the iPad won't sync.\nTo solve: \nFirst I would try what tubedogg suggested above, and then I would recommend emailing your critical notes to yourself and putting them in the Notes app in iOS 8 or iCloud.com. See if it syncs, and then I would say it is safe to upgrade to Yosemite.\nIf it still doesn't work you could always have a go at using an alternative notes service like Evernote or any other which features syncing.\nI learned this from personal experience when upgrading to Yosemite iOS 8 and iCloud Drive.

My Time Capsule disks shows \"Internal disk needs repair\".\n\nHow can I repair the disk (without erasing it)?\n\nA: It is simple but non-obvious, as you have discovered...\nThere is an Apple KB article that states:\n\"Simply restart your AirPort Time Capsule. AirPort Time Capsule automatically performs a file system check on the internal drive during startup. If the AirPort Time Capsule detects an issue that it can resolve, it will repair the file system of the disk. If an issue is found that cannot be resolved, the AirPort Time Capsule's LED will flash amber, and AirPort Utility will state the issue. You should use the most current version of AirPort Utility.\"\nYou can find that here.\nFailing that you may have to remove the disk from the airport (ifixit.com has instructions) put it in an external USB drive sled and attach it to your Mac for further repairs and diagnosis. If Apple's Disk Utility cant fix it then you may have to use a commercial utility on it like DiskWarrior or Drive genius.\n\nA: When you get the message \"disk needs repair\" with amber flashing light from your Time Capsule, Please be sure to check that anther external hard drives but internal disk drive of TC is ok.   Taking out it from TC is easy and checking it by Disk Utility from your MacOS laptop or desktop removes all the problem instantly before being suspicious about the internal hard drive of TC.\nI was in a daze that I had to zero-out the internal hard drive mistakenly and then I found the error was being sent from one of external hard drives to TC.\nThis is a reference in favor of your convenience!\n\nA: For stubborn issues, move the Airport's drive to an external case and try Disk Utility's First Aid or another repair utility.\nI tend to backup to an external USB drive connected to the Airport for backups, as backup speed in most use-cases is non-critical.\n", "Q: External HD Accidentally pulled out of computer A few days ago I accidentally pulled my WD MyBook 1110 Media external HD out of the USB connection on my Macbook Pro.\nI have tried to repair the HD with Disk Utility, but the 'Repair Disk' option is grayed out.\nOf course I would like to recover the information on the external HD.

My main usage was as an e-reader & iPod, plus some mail & web.\nOne thing I did find was that after reducing the total memory used on the device [in my case by removing about 3GB of songs from it] to about 10GB total used on a 16GB phone, it appeared to run noticeably faster than when it was near full.\nDepending on how you are going to set up your nephew's phone, it's probably best to do this on his computer, setting it up as a new device under his own Apple ID [this will, of course, wipe all data from it. All apps etc would need to be re-purchased under that account] - otherwise he'll need your ID & password & also it's likely you'll be sharing the same diary & contacts etc... not really what you'd want, I presume.\nYou might want to see if Family Sharing would be a useful option - individual accounts, shared apps & songs, one credit card, parental controls.\nOnce set up as a new device, it may do the update automatically, as part of the setup process - if not...\nYou can source the updater file from http://ipswdownloader.com just by dialling in the required iPhone [get the latest available for that device, ie 6.1.6 as Apple will not sign anything older than the latest the device can run]. \nLaunch iTunes, with the device connected\nHold the alt/option key whilst clicking \"Check for Update\".

First, my question: Does swapping out a foreign SIM for the Sprint SIM that comes in new Sprint iPhone 6's prior to the first power up in any way prevent the iPhone from being locked by Sprint for international use. (I understand that unlocking Sprint iPhones for domestic use is impossible; I'm only asking about international use)\nNow, a little background: I recently purchased an on-contract Sprint iPhone 6, and have not yet powered it on - though it was added to my account at the store already. I will be taking a trip overseas in about 3 weeks and would like to use the phone with local carriers while I'm there. Unfortunately, according to Sprint's international unlock policy, I won't be able to get them to unlock the phone before then since it won't have been active for 90 days. I've read hints online about being able to prevent a Sprint iPhone from getting locked internationally by swapping in a foreign SIM for the standard Sprint SIM when first powering it on. Is there any truth to that? Would Sprint have any way of noticing that I've powered it up this way? Would it cause any problems with my account with them?\n\nA: We don't know what you wound up doing or what happened ...  \nHowever, I will tell you that I recently obtained a Sprint iPhone 5 that had no SIM card and had never, ever been activated.  Apparently it was an Apple repair exchange, but the owner decided to move service over to Verizon rather than activating his exchange, and sold it to us instead when he found out Verizon could not activate it there.\nI considered, like yourself, that perhaps the phone is in fact unlocked until the first SIM is installed.  So, I initially put in a U.S. AT&T SIM card instead.  That worked, and even displayed 4G service availability on the screen, until we got to the iTunes portion of the start up when the phone tries to verify itself with Apple and get the right carrier profile.  We received a message in iTunes that the \"activation policy\" does not allow using this SIM card unless Sprint unlocks the phone, and \"this is not a hardware issue.\"\nIn my opinion, that is a pretty good indication that the phone is locked at the factory before any SIM is inserted, and also that it is possible for the phone to run even on AT&T within the U.S. if properly authorized (something Sprint denies).  As for whether the factory SIM lock includes international SIMs (your actual question), obviously we don't know from my experience, but I'd venture to guess it probably does as well, as in my opinion, the international unlock is a really just a partial SIM unlock which leaves the U.S. GSM carriers blacklisted.\n", "Q: GarageBand not starting after Snow Leopard upgrade Starting four days ago, I wasn't able to open any of the icons at the bottom of the page of my MacBook.

Is it possible to install Solid State Drive with 6Gb/s speed in Mac pro Mid 2010?\n\nA: Yes it should be possible to install a SSD with SATA 6Gb/s.  \nThe MacPro5,1 was offered with a 512 GB SSD by Apple actually. The internal interface is limited to 3 Gb/s (which roughly translates to 300 MByte/s max) though. As a consequence you will not benefit from the faster transfer rate of the SATA III SSD.\nThe same is valid for MacBookPro6,1 and MacBookPro6,2.\nSATA 6Gb/s is backward compatible with SATA 3Gb/s. Some features recently implemented in SATA 6Gb/s won't work if a respective device is attached to a SATA 3Gb/s interface (e.g. Isochronous Native Command Queuing). \n", "Q: iPhone 5c says I am out of storage when I'm not I have 8.1 GB on my 5c and 11.3 GB on iCloud but I can't take a picture because my phone says there's not enough storage. What's going on?\n\nA: I had the same problem - there was 1.6 GB free but it would not let me take pictures because the memory was supposedly full.  Restarting the phone did not help.  I just connected the phone to the PC and it synced in iTunes and then it was fine.  \n\nA: Do you have 8.1 GB free space on your iPhone? Because you probably don't have enough free space, and then it just won't snap any pics. If you just freed up space try restarting the app (double tap home button and then swipe the camera app up, then open it again).\nAnd if your phone is full (storage wise) but you have a lot of space on your cloud than the photos haven't been removed from your phone. HOWEVER, if you are using iCloud photo stream (iOS 5+6+7) or iCloud photo library (iOS 8 & 9) do NOT remove the photos but store them somewhere else (on your PC or Mac via lightning-USB cable or on some other cloud), because they will otherwise be removed from iCloud as well.\nAll this comes from my personal experience and the Wikipedia article about iCloud\n", "Q: Best solution to force MacBook Pro 2011 to use integrated graphics (discrete graphics still working though) After changing my AMD Radeon HD graphic card again, and seeing so many complains about the MacBook Pro 2011 issue online, I decided to plan to make the my MacBook only work with Intel HD 3000 graphics no matter what, to avoid the amd discrete graphics from ever overheating and failing again. I saw so many suggestions online about this, but I haven't found a real solution if the AMD is still working, and it needs to be disabled all the time no matter the application running. Please, I need suggestions. I don't want this AND graphics to fail on me again, if I keep on using it or in automatic graphics switching. Thanks. \n\nA: The only walk-around, that works is described here: How to disable discrete graphics card and use only integrated graphics MacBook Pro Early 2011?. In short: remove kernel drivers for the discrete gfx card. It will make the MacOs work in the fallback mode without 3d acceleration. \nTo control the brightness of your screen, I recommend to use: brightness slider. Because, the standard way of changing screen brightness will not work.\nps. The only way, I know, is to overheat your Mac as suggested here and use gfxstatus to force MacOS to use the integreted gfx.

But when the AppleTV 3 is asleep, nothing can see it until I wake it up.\nObviously, I'd prefer it if all my devices could see the services on all my other devices, all the time—I understand this is what the Bonjour Sleep Proxy service is supposed to do.

For whatever reason, multicast traffic does not appear to correctly pass through the WiFi on this device, even with the latest firmware. \nTP-Link have a related technical note on this, but it doesn't seem to apply to my particular device. In the meantime, I've just left the WiFi turned off on this adapter (still using it for two wired devices, including the 3rd gen Apple TV), and things seem to be working better again.\n\nA: I had the same problem with TL-WPA4220 - the powerline wifi didn't seem to be passing multicast traffic to and from my Macbook Air (including Sonos, AirPlay to Apple TV, Dropbox LAN sync, and plain ping 192.168.1.255).\nI tried reducing the TL-WPA4220 from 40MHz to 20MHz, and I don't know why, but everything seems to be working now:\n\nAs part of basic RF hygiene make sure that the 'WPA4220 has not defaulted to 300Mbps (40MHz) operation.

The problem is, why it takes 19 days to erase it?\n\n\nA: The time needed to erase a hard disk depends on the size of the disk, the erasure method (1-pass/3-pass/7-pass) and the number of bad blocks.\nIf your drive contains bad blocks and you try to erase them, the drive may try numerous times to reread/rewrite the entire block and often invokes the error correction to rebuild the data depending on the erasure method.\nExamples:  \n\n\n*\n\n*4 weeks ago i had to erase a 320 GB HDD with (finally) 23 bad blocks. It took about 4 hours to finish the task (1-pass).  \n\n*6 month ago i examined a breaking HDD. Every single bad block took 5-10 minutes to be validated.\n\n\nFurthermore the algorithm estimating the completion time of the erasure will be misguided depending on the position of the bad blocks.\n\nA: Though I don't believe this is the complete answer you would be looking for, there is always the concern of speed of the network and speed of the disk installed in your time capsule.\nFor the network speed, if you're doing this over WiFi you probably need to consider if you're getting poor performance or high latency. It might not have been noticeable before, but for the large operation you're doing right now it could be killing you. Of course, if you're doing this over wired Ethernet then this bit probably isn't affecting you.\nThe other bit is disk speed and general filesystem performance. When you're erasing the time capsule, you're not just formatting the disk. Instead, you're erasing the contents of the sparse bundle that is stored on the time capsule disk. The two things that will matter here is 1) you've got a relatively slow hard disk in there (5400 RPM low power variety by default) and 2) the larger the drive and sparse bundle, the longer it is going to take for the job to complete.\nI've found that on my NAS, deleting a time machine sparse bundle of nearly 900GB can take most of a day. The problem is that OS X is meticulously going through each individual file inside of this sparse bundle filesystem and deleting them and then updating the various indexes and tables that keep track of what is where. Not that each individual operation is particularly lengthy, but when you actually look inside of a Time Machine sparse bundle you will see probably hundreds of thousands of files and/or references to files which each need to be operated on. It is doing this to keep things neat, tidy and orderly but at the expense of being painfully slow. Frankly, I've found it faster to just delete the sparse bundle container though that can still take a long time.\nIf why you're doing this is because Time Machine is complaining that there is a problem with the backup and is already in use, you might want to try just rebooting the Time Machine capsule and your Mac and see if that fixes it; it usually seems to in my experience.\n", "Q: How to delete all photos in the camera roll in iOS 8.x?

I need to export video events to my external hard drive. I am using iMovie version 9.0.4. How do I do this.  All the instructions I'm finding on the web are for later versions of imovie.\n\nA: Are you referring to an exported movie (i.e. all the bits stitched together) or just the events that you've collected that you would make up a movie project with?\nIf it is the former, then it is simply right clicking on the project and there should be an \"Export movie...\" option. I believe there is a menu bar item for this as well.\nIf you're referring to the latter, then I think it is as easy as just making a copy of the actual events from your hard drive to the external drive. You should be able to go to an individual event, right click and there should be a \"Reveal in Finder\" or some such option. You should then be able to just drag this event to the external hard drive (either as a move or a copy).\nFrom memory, iMovie '09 doesn't care if you move the events or projects around on your hard drives. The only thing that might need attending to is that you'll have to re-launch iMovie for it to recognize that there is a movie or event on the other hard drive. You probably need to have the folders 'iMovie Events' or 'iMovie Projects' (can't remember how they're named right now, but you'll see them in your home directory) on those drives for iMovie to recognize it.\nIn short, you should be able to create a directory on your USB external drive like:\n/Volumes/USB_External/iMovie Events\n\n...and then copy whatever subdirectory from your /Users/myusername/iMovie Events/ folder to the external one.\n", "Q: WhatsApp doesn't use contact name on lock screen notifications Hello Community Members,\nI am using iOS device (iPhone) with latest iOS version.\nI am facing an unusual problem with WhatsApp. \nWhen I get message from one of my contacts and screen is locked, WhatsApp shows that I got message from name (name it uses is set by user, and not as saved in my contacts)\nExample: If I get a message from my brother, whose contact is saved on my device as \"Bro\" and if screen is locked, it reads 1 message from Mr. Mehta (which is set by my brother as his display name on WhatsApp)\nAnyone facing same issue, or it's just me.

You will then need to move the public key that is generated to your mac.  Save a copy of the private key to use later using the \"Save private key\" button.\nOn your windows machine copy the contents of your public key exactly and paste them in the authorized_keys file you will create below.  The easiest way I think is to open an ssh connection using Putty to your mac machine, the first time you will have to enter a username and password.  Then create the folders and file structure and use an editor to move the contents.  From the putty terminal window connected to your mac enter:\nsudo mkdir ~/.ssh\nsudo touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\nsudo chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\nThen the editing part of the file you created:\nvim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\nPress the i key to insert text.  Paste in your public key, and press the keys esc then, :wq to save it.\nNow you can re-open Putty and create a new session.  On the left hand tab expand SSH and select the Auth tab.  Towards the bottom you will need to browse and load in the Private key that you saved earlier.\n\nI got most of this from the help file in PuttyGen.exe the first time I did it.

Occasionally, when plugging in, removing or restarting a microcontroller such as the Arudino or Teensy, the computer abruptly turns off and restarts. Afterwards, the computer displays a gray screen that says \"Your computer restarted because of a problem... etc.\" \nI'm not quite sure if this is related to a problem with my computer, an issue with the microcontrollers drawing too much current or my battery. I know that microcontrollers are sometimes forced to restart if they are asked to source too much current. eg. powering a servo. However, I would expect that a laptop would be able to source enough current to a bare microcontroller to avoid being shut off.\nI also should mention that my battery condition is \"replace now\". I can still use it for ~30 minutes without the power cord, and as far as my memory goes, my computer was always plugged in when this problem occurs.\nI read that one problem might be that my PCU might need to be reset. I believe that I reset it using the \"SCOP\" keyboard shortcut on start-up but the computer gives no indication of this.\n\nA: A USB port can only typically source 2.5 watts (5 volts at .5 amps).  If you are only programming the microcontroller, you should be OK, but if there are any other things the port would be powering (MOSFETs, LEDs, Servos, motors, ... ), and it exceeded the 2.5 watts, you would typically get the \"USB Low Power\" alert, and not a catastrophic shutdown.  \nMy guess as to what is happening is one of a couple things.  \n1) The USB port on the MBP is damaged, which can be check by seeing if the problem exists on all other USB ports, or just this one.  \n2) Verify that all your wiring is correct on the Arduino board.  When a microprocessor is reset, it's typical for a pin to be pulled low to initiate the reset.  If the board is improperly wired or setup, when the reset happens, one of the USB data lines could be getting 5v applied to it, or the 5v line could be pulled to ground.  \n3) Electrostatic Discharge could also be causing these problems.  I've had microprocessors (connected via USB programmer) reset when touching the metal on my MBP after walking around the office.  You may want to consider some ESD mats and bracelets.  \n", "Q: How to set up my iMessage account on my MacBook Pro?

This is a hack which is known to work, but I'm having some trouble with hibernate as a result.  \nIt seems my sleep image is only 8GB, despite the fact that my RAM is 16GB; consequently, if I lose power while having more than 8GB in memory, safe sleep fails.  \nAny ideas on how to correct this?\n\nA: A guess\nSee whether the problem is reproducible with compressed memory disabled. \nIf that's not a workaround, please vote down this answer and leave a comment. \nRelated\nvm_compressor_mode (vm.compressor_mode) values for enabled compressed memory in OS X\n– there's a link to an answer about disabling compressed memory. \n\nA: I have exactly the same configuration (MacBook Pro Early 2011 16GB/10.7.5 though) and my sleepimage has full 16 GB size.\nJust delete it by opening Terminal (located in /Applications/Utilities), and typing in the following command, followed by the enter key: \nsudo rm /private/var/vm/sleepimage\nEnter your administrator password (it will not be visible) and hit the enter key again.\nYour Mac will automatically rebuild it when needed (hopefully with the correct size).\n\nA: Recently I experiment a lot with disabling memory compression in Mavericks and I had clearly reproducible problems  with hibernating to disk.\n1) Enable memory compression and using an hibernate mode that writes to disk works without problems\nvm_compressor=4 + hibernatemode=3(RAM powered+sleepimage) or 25(only sleepimage) \n-> no problem when restored from sleepimage\n\n2) Disable memory compression and using an hibernate mode that writes to disk leads to kernel panics when waking up.\nvm_compressor=1 + hibernatemode=3(RAM powered+sleepimage) or 25(only sleepimage) \n-> kernel panic when restored from sleepimage\n\n3) Disable memory compression and using an hibernate mode that NOT writes to disk works fine.\nvm_compressor=1 + hibernatemode=1(only RAM powered) \n-> no problem, as long you have enough battery power \nto prevent lost of RAM while sleeping\n\nWell 3) is only a compromise since it lets you disable the memory compression, but you will loose the safety of the sleepimage.\n", "Q: Login screen displays in the wrong place?

From time to time the system alerts that the disk is unreadable, but sometimes it seems to connect and I can browse it in Finder, and even open some of its files with Quick Look, but some folders became empty although the disk has the same amount of free space. The Disk Utility can't repair the disk with alert: couldn’t unmount volume for repair. How can I possibly restore my data? My computer is MacBook Pro (early 2011), OSX Yosemite (10.10). The disk has its own power adapter. I've tried Data Recovery app, but it doesn't see the disk file system and can't scan it, while at the same time I can open some files on the disk in Finder... I also need to force eject the disk because it never ejects normally.\nI've tested the disk with the case and power adapter which work for sure (with another HD).\n\n\n\n\nA: I have solved the problem connecting the disk directly via SATA, I didn't have a Macintosh to install a 3.5\" disk into, so I connected it to a PC with Windows 7, installing the HFS+ drivers, which allowed PC to see the disk and read (but not write) the data on it. I was able to copy the data to another external disk which I formatted into exFAT, so it could be used with OSX and Windows both. I still don't understand what was the problem with the disk, but I saved the important data, so I consider the problem solved.\n", "Q: Can I re-download the default keyboard (iOS 8) after deleting it?

But first, I want to make sure I'll be able to get that keyboard back if I need to. \nWill I be able to get it back after deleting, and if so, how?\niPhone 6 Plus (iOS 8.1)\n\nA: Yes.

I had my iPhone stolen earlier today. I went through the steps of trying to find it using Find My Phone, etc.\nI ended up getting my phone back miraculously through a system of Find My Phone and just my own personal investigation, but when I got it back it seems to be different. All my apps are gone, and I'm not sure if this was part of the Wipe My Phone I did but there is also Cydia and Pingu installed on my iPhone. I'm pretty sure those involve jailbroken iPhones.\nMy question: is my iPhone jailbroken, and what steps do I go through to reverse that? I don't want a jailbroken iPhone. \n\nA: This doesn't directly answer your question, but I still wanted to says it.\nI think he gave you a different phone. If the phone was already jailbroken and the sim was taken out, I think it won't show up in Find My Phone (unless the guy goofed up did some silly things).\nI think he gave you someone else's (already hacked) phone and kept yours so he finish hacking it.\nIf you know your phone has any unique features, like a scratch or something, be sure to check that the phone he gave you also has it. If not, it's probably not your phone.\nWhy would he hack your phone you ask? Because it makes it very easy to do identity theft on you.\nWhat you should do now:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the passwords to everything in your life (no joke).\n\n*If you have email setup on your phone, change its password and\nread your Sent mail from the day you lost your phone to the day\nyou changed your password.\n\n*If you ever used a credit card to buy things with your phone,\ncontact your bank, tell them the card may be compromised\nand ask for a new card.\n\n*If you had any classified/confidential data on your phone, do\nwhatever you must do to mitigate the consequences of that\ninformation going public.\n\n\nNow, all that being said, he is probably not a professional since he let you track him down to his house, so the steps I mentioned above might not be necessary. Also, if your phone is password protected and you did the Wipe My Phone before he hacked it, your data and passwords are probably safe.\nBut regardless, you should still exercise caution and watch your finances/identity very closely for at least a couple months just in case.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Cydia is installed when the iPhone is jailbroken. iOS 8 Pangu Jailbreak installs the Pangu app during the jailbreak process. So the answer to your question is Yes, the iPhone is jailbroken.\nHow to remove the jailbreak from your iPhone\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your phone to iTunes\n\n*Do a factory reset\n\n*Restore back to the most recent iPhone backup\n\n\nFollowing the above steps can restore the iPhone to factory condition and restore back to the recent backup through iTunes.\n", "Q: Why Does My MBA Close All My Apps After 5 Mins Idle? Sometimes if I walk away from my MBA without locking the screen and I return I'll be faced with a login screen.

During my time with Yosemite, I've had an innocuous issue that gets logged to system.log non-stop.\nThis question is not about solving the issue.\nI'd like to stop the chatter, because they're writes to the drive which is an SSD, and could do without them.\nHow can I silence or prevent the writes to the log?\nThe messages come from the kernel and blame IO80211ScanManager. Example:\nNov 19 02:04:46 Louis-MBP kernel[0]: IO80211ScanManager::startScan: pid 29 had pending scan request. Deleting.\nThey dominate the log, whose 4000 most recent messages usually cover about a day.\n\nA: Logging to system.log is controlled by the /etc/asl.conf file.  The default is to send all kernel messages to system.log.  If you add a priority level restriction, the trivial system complaints won't be logged.\nEdit the file /etc/asl.conf and find a line that looks like this\n? [= Sender kernel] file system.log\n\nand change it to \n? [= Sender kernel] [<= Level error] file system.log\n\nSend a HUP signal to the syslogd process (or just restart your system) and the logging behavior will be changed.  Use pgrep from Terminal to find the process ID for syslogd.  E.g.\n$ pgrep syslogd\n21\n$\n\nThen send a HUP signal to that process ID with the kill program.\n$ sudo kill -HUP 21\n$\n\n\nA: Delete the system log with the command\nsudo rm /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist\n\nmacOS is the same as iOS. Whatever service is running is stored in a plist to give the command to run a script. So if you can disable or remove a service in iOS you can do it in macOS too.\nThis only deletes the system log service running on boot, nothing else. You can run logging manually if you want when you open the console.\n", "Q: Is it possible to view bugs submitted by others to Apple's bug reporter? Engineering has determined that your bug report is a duplicate of another issue and will be closed.\nThis is a message I see quite often these days at http://bugreport.apple.com and it is frustrating for several reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*you submitted a bug for nothing without the possibility to check the database first\n\n*you can't check if it is truly a duplicate\n\n*there is no follow-up on your issue\n\n*you'll never know if they are fixing the bug\n\n\nI can't believe that these major disadvantages are on purpose.\nSo: Is it possible to view bugs submitted by others to Apple's bug reporter?\n\nA: It is not possible. But there is a website called OpenRadar where the community files the same bugs as in Apple's bug reporter.\nIt's supposed (never confirmed) that Apple analyses all bugs and solves the ones with more duplicates. In that way, people report again and again the same bugs on Apple's Bugreport in order to speed up the process.\nSo, if you want a bug to be solved asap, file your bug report, duplicate in open radar and then share that radar to as many people as you know.\n\nA: It is currently impossible. Only Apple employees with special permissions can access the full Radar database. 3rd parties (such as registered developers, integrators, resellers and others) can only access entries they created in the BugReport system.\nOne specifically annoying consequence is this:\nMany Apple code samples contain workarounds for old radar bugs with references to those bugs (e.g. CFProxySupportTool sample project contains workarounds for rdar://problem/5530166 and rdar://problem/5533931) \nHowever, when using older sample such as this, It is impossible to know when is it safe to remove those workarounds - because you can't know if the specific bug was resolved in some OS version.\n", "Q: Mac node npm can not setup bower I try to setup up bower on my Mac Pro.\nInfo:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Mac OS X

I just removed two document folders from my Sidebar in Finder, and now I can't find them! Any ideas on where they could have ended up?\nThanks! \nEmma \n\nA: The folders/documents in the sidebar are just shortcuts to the given folders/documents.\nSo if you just removed them from the sidebar they still are where they've been. \n", "Q: Locate phone with Find My iPhone without locking it Can you use the Find My iPhone app without it locking the phone your trying to find? I only want the location, not to lock it.\n\nA: Yes, sure - so long as the phone can currently find a net connection.\nEither from another iPhone, using the Find my iPhone app & entering your own Apple ID, or from the website - https://www.icloud.com/#find \nIt will show on the map & give you options to Play Sound - useful if it's somewhere near you, down the back of the sofa, in a coat pocket etc, or more seriously if it's been stolen or lost you can set Lost Mode or Wipe all data.\n", "Q: How to associate a route with an interface? I have a Mac with two network interfaces, connected to different networks.  For the sake of argument, let's say one is connected to a private network and the other to the Internet.\nI understand that I can use the Networks system preference pane to place the Internet interface higher in the \"service order\" than the private network and that, by doing so, its \"Router\" will become the system's default gateway (and the other interface's \"Router\" is ignored).\nHowever, this obviously results in all traffic being routed over the Internet (except the specific subnet of the private network to which the machine is directly connected).  I want to override this behaviour for the entire private network, routing all private traffic via the appropriate interface.\nWhat is the \"Apple Way\" of accomplishing this?  Merely executing sudo route add ... only creates the route temporarily, whereas I want to associate it with the interface in some permanent way (i.e. that will survive the interface changing state, or the system rebooting).\nI presume that the solution will involve launchd invoking a script after the interface has come up… but how?!\n\nA: 1 - Here is a copied solution but deprecated:\nFirst of all, you have to be a local admin.\nOpen a terminal and change to the StartupItems directory\ncd /Library/StartupItems\n\nThen create a new directory with root priviledges, e.g. AddRoutes and change into it\nsudo mkdir ./AddRoutes\ncd ./AddRoutes\n\nNow you have to create and edit the bash script\nsudo touch ./AddRoutes\nsudo nano ./AddRoutes\n\nPaste the following Lines into the bash script and adapt it for your network\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# Set static routing tables\n\n. /etc/rc.common\n\nStartService ()\n{\nsleep 10\nConsoleMessage \"Adding Static Routing Table\"\nsudo /sbin/route add -net 10.0.0.0 -netmask 255.0.0.0 -gateway w.x.y.z\n}\n\nStopService ()\n{\nreturn 0\n}\n\nStopService ()\n{\nreturn 0\n}\n\nRestartService ()\n{\nreturn 0\n}\n\nRunService \"$1\"\n\nWhen you finished with the script, save it.\nThen create the corresponding plist.\nsudo touch StartupParameters.plist\nsudo nano StartupParameters.plist\n\nWhen you created the plist file, paste the following lines into it.\n{\nDescription = \"Add static routing tables\";\nProvides = (\"AddRoutes\");\nRequires = (\"Network\");\nOrderPreference = \"None\";\n}\n\nWhen you finished the plist file, save it.\nFinally you have to set the access rights\nsudo chmod 755 /Library/StartupItems/AddRoutes/*\n\nAt the end you have to reboot and now your permanent static routes are set.\nYou can verify with the following\nnetstat -nr\n\n2 - Here you may find a more up-to-date solution involving a little program:\nstaticroute\n\nConfigured static routes survive a restart, and will automatically be added and removed as network interfaces go up and down.\n\n", "Q: Calendar in list but not in sidebar I loaded the My Meetups Calendar from meetup.com into my gmail account which I synchronize with Calendar.app. The My Meet up a calendar is in the calendars list in the menu, but not in the sidebar, and that means I have to specifically open a separate window to see the events on my meetups. \nIllustration:\nHow can I fix thhis?\n\nA: I solved this by going to Preferences (⌘+,) -> Accounts -> Google Account -> Delegation (tab) -> Click on My Meetups.\nI can now see the meetups in the calendar :)\nWarning: This is a viable solution only, of course, if you don't use the delegation feature -> If you do, you will give (unneccesary?) access to your Meet ups to your delegates, which may not be what you want.\n", "Q: Stop switching windows when other app is loading Imagine that you open an app that takes several seconds to load like Photoshop and you don't want to just sit there so you move to your browser to check whatever. Now, as you interact with browser or other app OS X will move screen or switch active window to app several times during the start. \nI understand that it is letting me know that app is turning on but I would like system to stop switching at any moment it likes while I am doing something else. Otherwise I have to just keep sitting around waiting until my initial app loads.\nIs there way to stop this?\n\nA: OS X already does this. If you open an app, then switch app before the window loads, the window of the second app will open behind the app you are currently working in.\nPhotoshop does not create standard OS X windows, instead using its own windowing system. This means that Photoshop windows and therefore the app itself does not abide by OS X windowing standards.\n", "Q: How do I repair my HDD when Disk Utility won't recognise it needs repairing? When I try to shut down OS X Yosemite on my MacBook Air, the screen goes black almost immediately with the mouse pointer remaining visible (and moveable). However, it appears that irrespective of how long I give my Mac to shut down, it never does.\nWhen I run Disk Utility it tells me that my HDD needs to be repaired, and that I need to reboot while holding Cmd + R before running Disk Utility. When I do this, Disk Utility tells me that there is nothing wrong with the HDD.\nAnyone know the best way to go about resolving this issue?\n\nA: I would probably do a reinstall of Mac OS X Yosemite. Doing so will not delete your personal files, but will reinstall the files that the operating system requires. It sounds like there's either a Mac OS X operation or some other third party operation hanging in the background while it's tying to shut down.\nIf that doesn't work, there are some third party HD diagnostics tools out there. I'd recommend checking one of those out. Additionally, when you take it to the Genius Bar, they'd most likely run an Apple Hardware Diagnostics test.\nIf it shows anything here, and if the computer is under warranty, I'd make a free appt at the Apple Genius Bar and get the hard drive replaced.\nAdditionally, as a last-case scenario, you can completely erase the HD and then completely reinstall the OS X. If it doesn't hang after that and you don't see any more errors with the HD, then it has been isolated to a software issue.\n\nA: It turns out that the two problems were not related. My Mac refuses to shut down henever an external hard drive is connected to it.\n", "Q: How to spoof a USB-Ethernet adaptor's MAC address in OS X I've recently bought a usb-ethernet adapter (not apple) and I get internet connection. In my university we have to put a specific mac address but I can not change it. \nI have tried with \nsudo ifconfig en4 ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\n\nand with\nsudo ifconfig en4 lladdr xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\n\nand with both I got the same result.

If I try to change the mac address of my Wi-Fi I can do it.\nI'm using OS x Mavericks and my USB-Ethernet adapter is a Chinese one, the model is AX88772A \n\nA: I fixed this issue by installing my adapter's chipset driver on Mac Os X.\nAfter rebooting, the usual command (e.g. sudo ifconfig en6 ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx) works as expected.\nBelow the details.\n\nI had the same problem with a Tecknet UL688G USB 3.0 to 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet adaptor.\nOn both Mac Os X 10.10.5 (Yosemite) and 10.11.4 (El Capitan) the command to change the MAC address was ignored, while it worked flawlessly on Ubuntu 15.10.\nSo no, not an hardware problem, at least in my case. \nAfter a few failed attempts with third party software and useless drivers, I found out that my adapter had the Realtek 8153 chipset, as confirmed by the system report of Mac Os X:\n\nI found the chipset driver on another manufacturer's website, relative to a different product that uses the same RTL8153 chipset, installed it, rebooted, and voilà.. after that it was possible to change the MAC address from command line.\n\nPS. the Realtek's website has the driver as well; it is probably the most updated version, although it gave me some errors during the installation. However, it also works as expected.\n\nA: Spoofing a MAC address in OSX isn't as simple as it is in Linux so you may want to try using a python script such as SpoofMAC. \nAnother way to configure/get info about network services in OSX is with the networksetup command.\n\nA: Stumbled upon changing mac addresses before~\nSeveral answers to try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try changing en4 to en0\n\n*http://www.macspoofer.com/\n\n*http://sweetpproductions.com/wifispoof/ (this is for wifi - but it might help?)\n\n", "Q: iOS8 how can I reduce the amount of system alert dialogs that I'm being asked?

Im open to native or workflow-based solutions. \nAny help or ideas are appreciated.\n\nA: You could do it installing this workflow: Open in Finder Tab.\nJust type ot Directory and you will have it open on a new Finder tab.\n\nIf you want to open a directory in the same window without open a new tab, you could edit the workflow.

I would like to share a directory, say ~work/Documents/SomeDirectory/SomeSubDirectory/, such that the other account (say ~home) can read from and write to it.\nI know how to do this with Unix access control, but I don't want to go through the trouble of creating groups and checking all the parent directories.\nIs there a simpler way to achieve this by using OS X Sharing & Permission settings (those accessible under Get Info in the Finder). If so, how would I go about sharing SubDirectory between the two accounts with minimal effort (yet also minimal exposure to third accounts and esp. remote users.)\n\nA: Why not to use /Users/Shared? Simply create a directory in it and create two aliases of it one for each of your users. This is the most simple way just using Mac OS and the Finder. The access rights of the original directory unter /Users/Shared can by edited by finders information dialog (add the other user with read/write access).\n", "Q: Upgrade available for Open GL graphics card Is there a compatible Open GL graphics card for my 17-inch iMac\n(MA590LL) to support 3D software?\n\nA: It's an integrated chip, so no, no upgrade is possible for this generation of iMacs. \n", "Q: Is there a keyboard shortcut to change tabs in Notification Center? Is there a keyboard shortcut to switch between the \"Today\" and \"Notifications\" tabs in Notification Center in OS X Yosemite?\nI'm looking for something equivalent to the cmd-shift-[/] shortcuts in Safari.\n\nA: I hate these kinds of answers, but there doesn't appear to be one.\nAnother question points out that you can use some kinda-hacky Applescripts to work around the limitation: Does Notification Center have keyboard shortcuts?\nI was toying around this, and it seems the key combos that notification center responds to depends on the active widgets. If you're in notification mode, you can reliably jump back to widgets by hitting TabTabEnter, but on Widgets, I find that the calculator tends to monopolize all keyboard input and prevent any tab jumping from working.\n", "Q: Why do my apps open in a single space when resuming? When I restart yosemite and I select 'reopen windows when loggin back in' I have a lot of apps that open in the same space.\nFor example when I have sublime text and libreoffice open in a space and restart, the space they they were on will be empty. They will all be on a single space but only in the mission control view and not in the actual space.\nIn contrast to safari and other osx native apps. I would just like to be able to shut down my macbook and resume in the exact same way. Is there a setting for the apps to resume in the space there were on, fully openened?\n\nA: Not certain in Yosemite, but in Mavericks apps would only restore to the Space they were on if they were set to specifically open in a given Space - otherwise they would all huddle together on the front-most Space at launch.\nRight click the app in the dock to set to 'This Desktop' once you have it in the correct one.\nQuickly move an app to another Space by left-click-hold the top bar of any window then hitting your key-combo for the desired Space.\n\n", "Q: Iphone 3GS not charging My IPhone was on 20% last night and I immediately plugged it in to the wall, it continuously kept connecting and disconnecting and at times giving \"Charging is not supported with this accessory\". Today, when I woke up, I noticed that my phone was off. I tried to charge it, I used 2 different chargers, I tried it with USB and plug. I know it turns on because when I hold the button There is an image of a battery with the thing. \n\nA: that's a tough one and could be an issue with a bad battery or something wrong with the \"charging circuitry\" in the phone itself which would require a visit to the Genius Bar or a 3rd party phone repair shop.\nOne thing you might want to try before going that route is to plug it into the Mac or PC that you normally sync with. Does it give you that same error? If so it may be that there is an issue with the connector. Either in the phone itself or the dock connector. You can try blowing in there to dislodge any lint/dust/dirt but a quick spurt of canned air would be my recommended method. Do both the connection port on the phone and the dock end of the connector and try again.\nIt is possible that the connector is worn and jiggling the connector in various ways might point to that.\n\nA: When the phone is in this state (extremely weak battery), it doesn't respond immediately even if it is charging.  If it's charging, it'll take several minutes to have enough charge to even display that it's charging.  So plug it in and be patient.   Most likely, that's all you need to do in this case.\n(Using a known good charger and cable is also a good idea - that is, that currently work with another device.  It could be something else, like the battery itself, but less likely. )\n\nA: Turn it off when you go to sleep and plug it before you go to sleep and in the morning it will be charged.\n", "Q: Paste HTML into Pages I'm trying to copy stuff (including tables) from a web page and paste it into a Pages document, retaining html formatting (as much as possible). With Pages'09 this used to work using OpenOffice as intermediate pasteboard: copy html - paste in OO - copy in OO - paste in Pages. Quite silly, but at least it worked.\nHowever, after I've upgraded to the newest iWork, this doesn't work anymore. Table cells come out as ordinary paragraphs.\nIs there a way to get formatted HTML into Pages?\n\nA: There seems to be no way to get formatted html tables into Pages, though other kinds of formatting will work. On Firefox, you're out of luck unfortunately. I just tested this now, using the latest version of Pages.\n\n\n*\n\n*Firefox to Pages: unformatted\n\n*Firefox to TextEdit: unformatted\n\n*Chrome to Pages: unformatted\n\n*Chrome to TextEdit: formatted with tables\n\n*Safari to Pages: formatted, no tables\n\n*Safari to TextEdit: formatted with tables\n\n*TextEdit to Pages: formatted, no tables\n\nA: You can paste the contents of a HTML table in a table in Pages, so the table has to be there already.\nYou can create a table with Insert -> Table -> Plain. The number of rows and columns doesn't matter. Then you have to select the first cell in the table. Make sure you don't select the whole table, and you don't select the contents of the cell (blinking cursor). If you paste, the table will be filled with the contents of the HTML table. If there are more rows or columns in the table in Pages, the extra rows/columns will stay empty. If there are not enough rows or columns, Pages will add them.\nCreating the table first in Pages is an extra step. But you don't have to use OpenOffice as an intermediate anymore, so I think this will actually be easier for you.\n\nA: Go back to using Pages 09.  It does not get deleted when you download Pages 5, you should find it in Applications/iWork.  The 2013 update is missing dozens of useful features which many users have relied upon, including the one you mention. There are good reasons why it gets very poor reviews in the App store.  An alternative is of course Word or Open/LibreOffice.   \n\nA: Apparently apple changed more than just their design for the new iwork suite, it appears pages can't handles as many file types as it used to.You need to find out which format you can use that keeps html formatting but is paste-able in pages, see pages supported file formats for more info about this, and definitely check out this answer. I found out that if you copy your html and export it to pdf via TextEdit.app you can import the pdf in pages and keep the formatting of html elements, the only problem is, the imported pdf wil behave as an image, so you can't change any values in it.Not ideal I know but as far as I can see there is no other way to do it.\n\nA: Can you modify your workflow a bit? Copy HTML, paste into alternate word processor, save that file as a .doc/.docx, then open the resulting file in Pages. I just tried this (copy HTML including table to Word 2011, save as .docx, opened in Pages 5) and it worked fine for me.\nIt is more awkward as inserting the table into an existing document will require saving a temporary file and then the wait for it to be converted to Pages format, but it does work.\nI do definitely see the issue with straight copy-paste though. It is frustrating that Pages does not even include an option to paste special and retain source formatting or structure.\n", "Q: Acer UHD4K2K not working through Thunderbolt I have an Acer UHD4k2K monitor hooked up to my Retina Mackbook Pro. I was previously using an HDMI cable (only 30Hz), as that's what came with my monitor.\nA Thunderbolt cable that's long enough arrived yesterday and I can't get it to detect the display.\nI'm plugging a thunderbolt cable into one of the thunderbolt ports on my Mac (I've tried both) and into the MiniDP port on the monitor.

Thunderbolt has an integrated Handshaking, and is for Data-Io only - non Apple Products, like the Acer cant make sense of the Thunderbolt Data and wont be able to recognize it as \"Display Data\"\n\n*SOLUTION: Make your life easy and get a third party Mini-DP cable. The thunderbolt PORT will recognize what you want from it and switch mode to be just a mini-dp port.

So on my Mac OSX, the MP3 look normal, and have no clones, but once I plug in the USB to my car, every song has its own clone. \n\nA: If you delete them manually a lot of them will reappear at eject. .DS_Store, trashes, fseventsd & spotlight files especially.\nThere have been a number of software solutions over the years, most only partially successful. BlueHarvest was about the best I'd tried until recently, but wasn't 100% effective.\nI'm currently testing CleanMyDrive, freeware, though they are using it as a bit of an advert for CleanMyMac for your internal drives, but you can ignore that. So far it seems to be fairly effective, but still misses the trash files every so often.\n\nA: The \"clones\" are osx system files that are not supposed to show up (should be hidden). This is true in general for files starting with \".\", that might be visualised on other operative systems, like Windows. If you have no way to change the settings of your mp3 reader to avoid visualising those files, I guess you'll have to find some way to avoid the problem (like deleting the files manually: to visualise them: https://www.mikesel.info/show-hidden-files-mac-os-x-10-7-lion/).\n", "Q: Terminal command to change Privilege of \"everyone\" to \"No Access\" I want to change the privilege of a specific folder for the \"everyone\" group to No Access.

Is there any way to get to 7.1.2 without going to 8 on my old iPad?\n\nA: After release of ios 8 that is no longer possible.\nApple no longer signing iOS 7.1.2, closing the downgrade window.\nApple has finally ceased signing iOS 7.1.2. \nThis means that you can no longer downgrade to the older firmware from iOS 8.x, or upgrade to it from older versions.\n", "Q: Mail Connection issues to aol with yosemite 10.10.1 After I upgraded my macbook pro to yosemite 10.10.1, suddenly the mail won't connect to the aol mail.

The password and account info is correct as I can log in using the same credentials on the web and the same mail was working just before the upgrade.  Anyone has any ideas?\n\nA: You are not alone.  I have the same problem using earthlink as email provider.  Answer is that you use \"MacMail\" on your computer which connects to your provider.  The connection is broken in the yosemite system.

Or is that the only option?\n\nA: Yosemite mail is horrible, if you have a large inbox it just kills an older machine.  I have a 3ghz mini with 16gb of ram and it STILL crawls.

This might be a network forum question, nor sure but here is my question:\nMy router is AirPort Time Capsule, the new model that has wireless ac.\nMy laptop is Retina Macbook pro and looks like it also supports wireless ac\nand my phone is iPhone 6 and I think that one is also wireless ac.\nWhy when I go to SpeedTest application on the iPhone my speed does not show higher than 20 or 30 Mbps but when I do speediest on browser on MacBook then it goes to 50, 60, or 70 Mbps? \n\nA: It would largely come down to the hardware components (i.e., related to wireless communication) that each device is composed of.\nFrom the Apple store, you can inspect the list of components within a given device. You want to identify the specific part number/name and the manufacturer. Some device review sites might provide that info as well.\nYou can then go to manufacturer sites and reference the specific parts, and learn more about the specifications for each part. Doing this comparison, this should answer your questions about the varying performance that you're observing.\nAlso keep in mind that newer versions of the same hardware model can have more advanced wireless components, which improves performance in the newer product (even though it appears identical to the older model).\n", "Q: SSH with ipv6 working only if I pass %en0 with my ipv6 address I am trying to ssh with Mac OS X (10.10.1 Yosemite) terminal using ipv6.\nIf I use command like \nssh username@ipv6_address\n\nIt's not working and I am getting error \"No Route to Host\".\nBut If I use command like (with %en0)\nssh username@ipv6_address%en0\n\nIt's working and I am able to SSH with ipv6 address..\nCan you please guide me what's the reason of not working without %en0?\nThanks.\n\nA: When you want to connect to an unroutable address like link-local you need to specify the interface. This is because for unroutable addresses your system can't determine the outgoing interface by looking at the routing table.\nUnroutable destinations include link-local addresses (fe80::) and link-local multicast (ff02::) and more.\n", "Q: IOs/phonegap - can't submit to itune - Invalid Segment Alignment I get the following error after submitting the app to itune:\nInvalid Segment Alignment - The app binary at 'Envisearch.app/empty.o' does not have proper segment alignment.

Hope Apple wakes up soon and looks into this one.\n\nA: The WiFi suggestion from rastriffler let to what fixed it for me -- I have both 802.11g (2.4GHz) and 802.11n (5GHz) networks in my house.  Bluetooth operates in the 2.4GHz band ... and it appears for me that being connected to the 802.11g network was angering it.  I switched to the 802.11n network and things started working nicely again.\nSo suggestion: try a 5GHz wireless network or a wired connection ... or simply turning off WiFi to test and confirm if you have the same issue.  I figure there are other problems you can run into with Bluetooth, but this is what was wrong for me...\n\nA: Bluetooth and WiFi can interfere. On several devices there are recommendations to turn off Bluetooth while using Wi-Fi (for example, Vaio manuals). I had this problem on my new Macbook Pro after the first few hours of work, once that I started a \"heavy \" (several hours) transfer from the older laptop - using WiFi. The mouse disconnected every 1-4 minutes. After a few hours, once the transfer was completed, the mouse started to work fine, again. On normal network use, this should not happen. But that was a good occasion to discover the new Force Touch Trackpad that is actually brilliant..\n\nA: What did not work for me were the bluetooth/airdrop approach, rebooting, cleaning contacts, changing batteries, deleting bluetooth from Networks.\nWhat seems to have done the trick was to fold a post-it and stick it between batteries and the cover (so the batteries can't move). \n\nA: I too struggled with this disconnecting problem for many weeks trying every solution I could find including upgrading to \"El Capitan\". I gave up in the end and reverted to using my \"Targus Bluetooth Laser mouse\" Then an idea came to me.\nPreviously when using the Targus mouse all other bluetooth mice (I also have a \"Mighty Mouse\") have been turned off. So I thought why not try the Targus and Magic mouse at the same time. Here is the sequence.\nTurn OFF Magic Mouse\nTurn on and connect Targus mouse\nTurn ON Magic Mouse\nLeave Targus on while testing the Magic for maybe a few hours (whatever you feel happy with)\nWhen satisfied all is well turn the  Targus OFF.\nFor me now all is perfect with the Magic so after a few more hours I decided to RESTART my Mac, (Leave Magic turned on and other mice off)\nMagic started straight away on restart and has stayed working perfectly for 5 days now. I did intend to test this routine with the Mighty Mouse but as all is happy I did not want to push my luck but I feel that if you have or have access to any other bluetooth mouse then this should work.\nI really hope this works for you...\n\nA: I have Magic Mouse II (because the original Magic Mouse did the disconnect/reconnect thing).  Main differences: +$10 and rechargeable built in.  i.e., there is no access to the battery. BTW, adding spacers to the battery would not have been an issue as my mice disconnect and reconnect while sitting idly by the MacBook Pro. \nResult with the new mouse: same problem. I guess I shall return to the Genius who \"gave\" me the new mouse but armed with some of the responses seen here. Mainly worried about WiFi interference. Working from home I need both wireless systems on.\n\nA: Have one additional mouse with the cable. First go to System Preferences -> Mouse, set up Bluetooth mouse, click your mouse, remove it. Then turn Wi-Fi off. Then search for mouse again and Mac will find it. Now it works!\n", "Q: Can the excessively limited \"Recent Items\" list be adjusted to include more document types? Recent Items under the Apple menu or in the Dock could be an excellent way to quickly access files that you have been working with recently. Alas, it's functionality is destroyed by obvious document file types not being included in the list. If you open a PDF it's included, if you open a Word file it's not. That makes no sense.\n\nYou can see in the picture above that even though Office applications have been included in the recent list, the actual documents (.doc[x], .ppt[x], .xls[x]) that were opened have not.\nIs there a way to adjust the file type list to go into Recent Items/Documents to a useful set of document types?\n\nA: This problem has been fixed in OS X version 10 / Yosemite or possibly earlier. Now, Office files are listed in the recent file category as they should be (see below).\n\nA: Another way to try it is to set the recent items list to zero, so it shows nothing, ever. You can do this in Terminal.\nIn Terminal:\ndefaults write NSGlobalDomain NSRecentDocumentsLimit 0\nNormally that's a 20. just set the default to zero and you shouldn't see anything in recent items.\nFor an application-specific change (for instance, Safari) use this command:\ndefaults write com.apple.safari NSRecentDocumentsLimit 0\nReplace com.apple.safari with the proper wording for the app you wish to modify, like vlc or flipplayer or whatever.\nTo reset default values, type:\ndefaults delete com.apple.app_name NSRecentDocumentsLimit\nto remove the application-specific setting, or \ndefaults write NSGlobalDomain NSRecentDocumentsLimit 20 \nto set the global value back to 20 (or whatever you want)\n\nA: Is there a way to adjust the file type list to go into Recent Items/Documents to a useful set of document types?\nNot that I know of, but you can increase the number under System Preferences> Recent Items, which might help.\n\nA: The problem I think lies in the mac definition of documents, which doesn't include Microsoft documents. I had the same problem when trying to set up a recent documents smart folder, and when I selected documents as the file kind word documents etc would only appear if opened in a particular way. However, if you set it up to find particular file extensions ie .docx and arrange the files by date opened it works. You can then add a series of file types (.doc, .pptx etc) to get a list of recent. To do this with smart folders you need to press the alt button whilst clicking the add condition to have the necessary options to collate multiple file types. \n", "Q: Macbook Pro Crashing and Startup Failure Firstly, some background information for the problem:\nMy girlfriend's Macbook Pro had an issue that was annoying, but not fatal. Roughly once a day (but sometimes not for a few days, and sometimes twice or more in one day) the laptop would suddenly freeze and turn itself off. It would sometimes immediately restart itself, and sometimes remain dead until the power was turned back on. Either way, if it was turned back on very soon after the crash, it would more often than not die half way through start-up. If we waited ten or twenty minutes to turn it back on it was usually fine. This never resulted in any lost data and there were no other signs of a problem during normal functioning, so it was never more than a mild inconvenience, until last night that is.\nYesterday, we were trying to fix this or at least understand the problem. We ran an Apple hardware check by holding D during startup, which found nothing. To help eliminate software issues, we updated it to the latest version of OS X. The update went well, and for half a day it was running Yosemite with no noticeable problems. Then, in the evening, the usual crash happened again. However, now the computer does not turn back on. Upon booting, the startup sound plays, and then the Apple logo appears along with a progress bar - much like the progress bar that appeared during the Yosemite installation - which reaches around half completion before going to a blank white screen and turning off after a few minutes. If the laptop is plugged into mains power, it keeps restarting itself over and over again and failing each time. If it is running on battery power, it just dies once and waits to be turned back on.\nBeing unable to fully start up the computer any more, we don't have access to all the information that might come in handy. I'll list some details that might have some chance of helpful, but I might not remember everything all at once so please do not hesitate to ask questions or for clarification on anything unclear.\n-It's a Late 2011, 15-inch Macbook Pro (4GB of RAM, probably the 2.2GHz processor)\n-The frequent crashes often happened while playing video files, and (we think) it only happened when using Airplay to mirror the screen through Apple TV. It has happened using two different video playback programs.\n-As mentioned in the text, Apple Hardware Check found nothing before. Now, we cannot seem to access Apple Hardware Check - only the OSX-update-like progress bar of doom. We also can't seem to access safe mode with it.\n-We tried resetting PRAM, after it wouldn't start up any more. It didn't change anything.\n-The last, fatal crash, after which it will not start up any more, happened during Airplay as usual, but also while updating the software on an iPhone through iTunes. The iPhone also died, but was fine after being plugged into another computer with iTunes and following through with the update there.\nIt was obviously somewhat stupid to not get this problem fixed while it was only an inconvenience, but it was not reproducible at that stage, so our hopes of having someone fix it were low. Now we're trying to get as much information as possible about what could be causing this and how we might be able to go about fixing it. Any help and/or information towards fixing this issue, or advising me on how to go about getting it fixed, is thus appreciated.\n\nA: Apple has an extended guarantee program for that:\nhttps://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/\n\nA: This happened a few times to one of the Macbook Pros at my office (Same model). It started shutting down before the Yosemite update though so I'm not sure if it's the same problem.\nWhat got things working again, albeit temporarily, was reseating the RAM and then plugging the power adapter in. The machine then started up on its own and properly booted into OS X Yosemite.\nFrom what I've read in other places, this may be a problem with the GPU switching in Yosemite but for right now, this fix is a tried and true method for what you're describing.\n\nA: This is a clear case of GPU failure. As your MBP is Late 2011 model, it has a faulty GPU. I have also one with that defect. Almost all the Early and Late 2011 15\" MBP have the same problem. Even Apple refused to acknowledge it and there is a lawsuit against Apple in US. If you live there, then you are lucky.\nThere is a temporary fix. Download gfxCardStatus app and use it to switch to Intel HD 3000. Do not run any AMD GPU invoking apps.\nThere is no solution to this issue. Even if you swap the logic board at your nearest Apple Store, you will get the same 2011 model logic board which is faulty. It will go down within few months. You can read about the widespread issue below.\nhttps://bgr.com/2015/01/16/2011-macbook-pro-class-action-suit-apple/\nhttp://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/suddenly-bunch-early-2011-macbook-pro-owners-running-video-problems/\nhttp://www.cultofmac.com/262861/early-2011-macbook-pros-dropping-like-flies-heat-issues-blame/\nhttp://macdailynews.com/2015/01/30/widespread-2011-macbook-pro-failures-continue-class-action-lawsuit-to-be-heard-by-judge-in-april/\n\nA: Had EXACTLY the same problem with my Early 2011 Macbook Pro. Kept trying to startup when on external power and made it to about halfway of the progress bar, then stopped and started again. Did nothing when on battery only.\nFor me it was the battery. Before all this happened a full charge would take me only half an hour so I knew it was bad already. Take out the battery and try starting up without it. If it starts then you know it's the battery. \nRunning without battery will run the CPU on reduces speed though. 0.8 GHZ in stead of 2.2 (measured with Intel Power Gadget), because it needs the battery to give extra power on peak moments so Apple (actually Intel) reduces the speed when there's no battery detected.\nNow waiting for the battery replacement to arrive, but I'm assuming it will run normally with the new battery. If it doesn't I'll edit this answer.\nEDIT:\nSo, (2nd!!) battery replacement arrived and now my macbook is as good as new. I first ordered a non-original battery. While it worked at kept its charge my macbook kept running on 0.8 GHZ in stead of the 2.2. Then ordered an original replacement and now it's back to 2.2 GHZ.\n\nA: This is most likely due to an issue with the dGPU or Discreet GPU getting corrupted. This was a known issue and covered under Apple's Extended Warranty program for a few years, but not valid anymore.\nThere is a working way-out for this and best explained over here- GPU problem - Boot Hangs on Grey Screen\n", "Q: Can I create a shortcut to type a short sequence of characters? Is there a way to create a keyboard shortcut that would input a short defined sequence of characters into whatever text field is currently active?\nIs it maybe possible to achieve this with AppleScript or Automator?\n\nA: You can do it from the substitutions list in System Prefs > Keyboard > Text, as in the example below.\nThe brackets are there in the example purely to make it file to the top [otherwise it gets mixed in with all my personal ones & I'd have to blur them all out]\nJust hit the + button at the bottom, type to enter your trigger, then double click in the result field & type your desired output string. If you copy/paste into the output string, you can include carriage returns, for a full postal address etc, but you can't insert them manually.\nOnce setup, as soon as you hit the spacebar after a trigger keyword, it will auto-replace. Toggling 'correct spelling automatically' will change whether it suggests it to you before you've finished typing or not - as soon as it's recognised the correct replacement, space will trigger it, if 'auto' is on.\nTo avoid triggers which would otherwise be possibly confusing I always use ncsomething, historically because my originals used to be stored on NoteCards, but also now because I know of no word in English that starts with nc. So ncemail generates my email address, ncmobile for my phone number etc etc...  \nI've found over the years that using a distinct word is easier to remember than a very short abbreviation, unless it's one you use a lot. \nAs a bonus, you can also use it for spelling mistakes that aren't usually picked up by the normal spell-checker…\nFor example I frequently type pice instead of piece; for some reason spellcheck never picks that up so now it's in my substitutions list.\niCould is also one that gets past the checker, so I have one to fix that too, back to iCloud\nAny changes you make to the substitutions list are 'live' immediately, you don't even need to close the window. \n\n\nA: You can customize your keyboard layout with Ukelele.

Enter your Apple ID and password.\nThe above has worked for me on MacOS Sierra, I suspect that XCode was stuck waiting for credentials before download.\n\nUpdate: Check for Unfinished Downloads option may not be present in the later versions of macOS.\n\n\nA: In launch pad hold the Xcode icon until the X appears and click the X to delete Xcode then go back to the app store and get a fresh copy.\n\nA: The Xcode had stuck in installing. I just opened finder, applications folder and tapped on Xcode. The installing has finished immediately.\nI am not sure if it is coincidence.\nXcode 10.3, Mojave 10.14.6\n\nA: sudo rm -rf /Applications/Xcode.app should wipe it out, then you can re-install from the App Store. But do make sure it's not actually updating first. It's a multi-gigabyte download so can take a while (yes, even hours, depending on your internet speed.) Opening Launchpad will show a progress bar if it's in the middle of doing something.\n\nA: I just installed Xcode (V12.5) on a fresh installation of Big Sur.  It took about 5 hours to complete the final installation part of the process (all previous installs on this machine have been much quicker.\nIn fact the progress bar (in App Store) didn't actually complete, but Xcode did appear in the Applications folder is working fine.\n\n\nA: There is a small progress bar under the Launchpad icon in the Menu Bar.\n\nYou can also see the current download progress by hovering over the icon.\nWait for it to end.\n\nA: In the Updates tab of the Apple App Store, after waiting 1 hour for \"2 minutes left,\" I hit CMD+R to refresh and that seemed to \"jump start\" it. It finished within 60s after that. Could have been coincidence though (YMMV).\n\nA: For the benefit of anyone else running into this problem - I don't use my MacMini much.  In fact I am back on it right now after a break of almost one year.  When I tried to startup Xcode I got this same message and it would not budge.\nI uninstalled it and then tried a reinstall only to be told that my OS was \"too old\".  So there you have it - the system goes into a tizzy trying to upgrade Xcode and being held back by the OS not being up-to-date.\nInstead of failing gracefully, it keeps trying over and over again!\n\nA: Sometimes, a simple restart can solve this.\n\nA: Download a fresh copy from Apple's download page\n", "Q: Why is my iPhone 6 wireless working on b/g mode? My router is AirPort Time Capsule which supports wireless ac. My iPhone is an iPhone 6 that also supports ac mode.\nI was looking at data in AirPort Utility and for my phone it was showing it is on mode 802.11 b/g which I think is old and slow but my iPad 3 was on 802.11 a/n mode.\nDoes that mean there is something wrong with my iPhone wireless?\n\nA: Most routers/AP will step down to b/g when there is a device on the network that does not support N or AC. Often this is a printer, or Roku or something you have on the network. Examine all the clients and devices to determine which are causing the router to step down, and either reconfigure, upgrade or eliminate them. Also, there may be an outside device on your wireless network causing similar issues.\nAlternatively, you can configure your Airport to work in N mode only. Open the Airport Utility, select Wi-fi Settings, Radio Mode and change the mode for 2.4GHz. This is also a good way to see what devices might be incompatible with the faster speeds your router supports.\n\nA: This happens when your Airport Time Capsule have the same name for 2.4GHz and 5GHz. \nTo solve it, just go to Wireless Options… and change the 5GHz network name.\nOn your iDevice replace the old wifi network with the new one and should work.\nSource: How to force 802.11ac?\n", "Q: Percent character breaks Terminal If I type the % character in the Terminal, it breaks that shell and every new shell I open until reboot:\n$ seq 10 | parallel -j50% \"echo Hi {}\"\n-bash: printf: `\"': invalid format character\n\nDoes anybody know why this is?\nTo expand a bit more, if I open a Terminal, and echo \"100%\", this happens:\nLast login: Fri Nov 21 08:28:47 on ttys033\n~$ echo \"100%\"\n-bash: printf: `\"': invalid format character\n\n0; echo \"100~$ \n-bash: printf: `\"': invalid format character\n7;file://mac-122667.dhcp.fnal.gov/Users/perdue~$ \n-bash: printf: `\"': invalid format character\n7;file://mac-122667.dhcp.fnal.gov/Users/perdue~$ \n-bash: printf: `\"': invalid format character\n\nEvery time I press RET after putting a percent character in, the Terminal flashes and prints an error statement about printf. I was actually working on this more after I posted the question and one thing I did was upgrade bash:\n~$ echo $BASH_VERSION \n4.3.30(1)-release\n\nThis helps. Previously it was Bash 2.something (if I recall - whatever Mountain Lion's default is). In that version of Bash, every open Terminal window aside from the one where I put the % was okay, but every new one I opened was also corrupted and nothing could get the Terminal back but rebooting.\nNow, with Bash 4.3, I can type a command to get the prompt back to normal. And new Terminal windows are also okay.\nBut - I still can't use % in commands I put into the Terminal. Fortunately, I don't need to often, but things like awk just don't work for me on my Mac.\nSo, my $PS1 is:\n~$ echo $PS1\n\\[\\e[0;34m\\]\\W\\[\\e[0;31m\\]$ \\[\\e[0m\\]\n\nIf that looks confusing at first, these are colors I am setting in my bash_profile:\n# colours for use in prompts\nRED=\"\\[\\e[0;31m\\]\"\nGREEN=\"\\[\\e[0;32m\\]\"\nYELLOW=\"\\[\\e[0;33m\\]\"\nBLUE=\"\\[\\e[0;34m\\]\"\nPURPLE=\"\\[\\e[0;35m\\]\"\nCYAN=\"\\[\\e[0;36m\\]\"\nexport PS1=\"${BLUE}\\W${RED}\\$ ${NOCOLOR}\"\n\nIf I echo \"100%\" with another user account, it is okay! So clearly, I am shooting myself in the foot somewhere in my .bash_profile. Which is too bad, because I basically like my setup, or so I think, ha!\nIf anybody wants to look at my dot files they're now on GitHub. (I am a bit embarrassed to show them - there is some cruft there, haha.)\n\nA: Looking at your .bash_profile, this seems to be the most suspicious line:\ntrap 'printf \"${OPENTITLEBAR} `history 1 | cut -b8-` - `pwd` ${CLOSETITLEBAR}\"' DEBUG\n\nIt is doing a printf on the history (which will contain your % character). \nI have no idea what that is intended to do (update window title with last command?), but I would guess if you comment it out, the error will stop.\n\nA: Analyzing these kind of problems is always tricky. I usually create a new account without any bash configuration to start from a clean slate (assuming the problem doesn't show up there) and then work upwards from there by adding config file by config file (or line by line if necessary). \nBesides the usual suspects (.bash_profile, .profile, or .bashrc) you may also want to look at .inputrc, /etc/profile and any file sourced from one of these.\n", "Q: Embed SVG image in email composed in mail.app? Is there any way to embed an SVG in an email? If I try to attach it the same way I'd embed an image file, it comes out as an attachment, rather than a visible image.\nFor some content (e.g. charts, diagrams), .svg is much smaller than images, so it would be nice to send smaller emails by embedding .svg.

As a developer I find it hard to believe it could be this complex without the OS offering any helpful hints.\n\nA: Apparently you should not drag the app to the launchpad, instead, drag the app to the application folder (open a finder window), or just do a $ cp /from /to.\nSo the process is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open DMG (it mounts)\n\n*Drag .app (and possibly other files) to your \"Applications\" folder\n\n*Unmount/Eject the DMG\n\n*Ctrl+click (right-click) to \"open\" so you can approve the app\n\n", "Q: how to clean the memory termed as 'others' in iphone 4s since a couple of days iam facing the problem with internal memory of my apple iphone 4s device so can you help me to find a solution for this. my ios software is 7.1.2 and not the jailbroken piece\n\nA: Not quite sure what you mean.

I'm using the default Gmail inbox, where emails are magically filed under the proper tab: Primary, Social, Update and Forum.\nIn Mail on OS X Yosemite (10.10) however, all end up in the Inbox.\nI can see my custom labels (I use several) under \"Google\" in the left panel. Under Mailboxes, I have of course the standard Inbox, Drafts, Outbox... But the Gmail tabs appear nowhere, not even as folders.\nI could maybe create rules on Gmail that would match the tabs, e.g. if this is a \"Social\" email, then add a label \"Social\", but this seems clumsy.\nIs there an easy/elegant way to enable it?\nEDIT\nYou can follow the instructions from this page (too long to reproduce them here). It boils down to creating server filters for each category (=tab), in order to archive the email from your inbox and apply a label on it. Then, it will show nicely in OSX Mail. Some caveats though:\n\n\n*\n\n*The search function in Mail does not work on all folders at once\n\n*You lose the small tab counter, telling you for instance you have 3 new emails in Social. The counter resets itself as soon as you hit the tab in Gmail. Not in OSX Mail\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, Gmail doesn’t expose its “Categories” to IMAP. I'm using Mail.app as my email client, and I had the same desire to have my mail categorized with Gmail’s bayesian-or-whatever classifiers, so I found a fix.\nThis workaround uses filters to automatically apply labels to categories. Once labeled the old fashioned way, they can then be exposed to IMAP.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Gmail/Settings/Filters\n\n*Using a search operator enter category:[chosen category] in the “Has the words” field and click “Create filter with this search.“\n\n*Check “Apply the label:” and select or create new label\n\n*(optional) Check “Also apply filter to matching conversations.“\n\n*Create filter\n\n*Go to Gmail/Settings/Labels and show the label in IMAP\n\n*(optional) Hide the label from label and message lists\n\n\nThis will link up your Gmail categories to your Mail.app.\n\nA: Short answer: no.\nGmail works on a system of \"labels\", which is represented in IMAP (a protocol used by email clients to talk to email servers) with traditional folders.\nThe \"tabs\" you are referring to show up as \"category:social\", etc. in the search bar in Gmail when you click on them. There is no representation in Gmail's IMAP server for these categories, therefore Mail (and any other email client) is unaware of them.\n\nA: You can use the MailTags plugin for Apple mail. This post gives a good recipe for syncing not only labels but also categories (the tabs) in Google mail with Apple Mail.\n\nA: If the goal is to stop getting Promotions or Social polluting your Inbox... Yes.\nI wouldn't call it elegant, but it's easy and it works.  \nIN GMAIL: \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new label:  Under other labels, you may have to click More for + Create New Label . Call it \"Promotions\"\n\n*Settings, Filters & Blocked Addresses, Create a New Filter\nHas the words: category:promotions\nCreate filter\nDo this:  Skip Inbox, Apply label \"Promotions\"\nIN APPLE MAIL:  Nothing... it will automatically get put into a new subfolder called \"Promotions.\" The \"new message\" sound may still sound, but the promo message won't be polluting your Inbox and you can choose not have it show that you got the message in Preferences, General:  New message notifications:  Inbox only\n\nA: It may be that some of you, as in my case, want to be sure that items under the Primary tab always shows up in the Important folder available to IMAP. When creating the filter per the directions above, no need to create a new label since there is an option to mark, e.g., category: Primary, to always be important. Then... as in my case, this keeps \"Primary\" (the label) in sync with \"Important\" available as an IMAP folder.

I've had the administering of around 100 macs thrust upon me (previous guy left, little documentation. Only things like the images he used, no documentation of whats in them Merry Christmas to me! :( ) As far as I can tell, they had no Administration system in place. The solution was basically get everything the way you want it on the master, disable updates and things, clone to other machines. Repeat every several months/ year or so (based on image dates)\nAnyway, my manager wants me doing things differently. I'm working on integrating the Macs into our AD somewhat. When I bind them to our AD with a name like M109831-TED117 it  shows up in AD as m109831_ted117. While the capitalization isn't an issue, the underscore is very inconvenient. \nWe are on a Win 2008 DNS server. this is Binding Mac clients ranging from 10.5-10.7 and I tried both Directory Utility (like here http://blog.pluralsight.com/join-mac-to-windows-domain) and through the comparable dsconfigad commands\ntl;dr \nWhen binding to AD why does my dash become an underscore?\nPut in name M109831-TED117 when binding and it shows in AD as m109831_ted117. can this be changed?\n\nA: I thought it could be a machine based GPO that was applied to either the Mac clients or the DNS server.\nHowever, I did a little digging and found this:\nhttp://www.bu.edu/tech/files/2009/10/AD-OD-10.6-1.pdf\nLook on page 6.  It specifically mentions about OpenDirectory and how it renames dashes to underscores. It looks like the change is coming from the Mac end of things. Why?    I found this regarding OpenLDAP which is what Open Directory is based on:\nOpenLDAP Hyphens within attribute names considered as separate tokens\nIt appears to be a software bug.\n\nA: As per this Apple Support article it's a DNS limitation.\nYou might also want to check out the dsconfigad and scutil command-line tools.\n\nA: Your problem sounds backwards.  The minus \"-\" sign is an allowed character in DNS and NetBIOS and the underscore \"_\" is disallowed.  See http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/909264\nIf it is forcing a change, then there may be a GPO that is enforcing the name change.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro detects the screen, but external screen stays black (mini dp to hdmi) I am trying to connect my MacBook Pro (OSX 10.9.3, 2.4 GHz Intel Core i5, 8GB DDR3) to Panasonic Viera TH55AS670D LED TV through Mini DP to HDMI connector. When I connect the wire my laptop screen blinks (which means it detects external screen) but the TV stays black. When I go to System Preferences and open the Displays tab - it shows the exact model of my screen, but nothing shows up on my screen.\n\nA: When connecting an external display to a MacBook Pro (MBP), sometimes you'll get lucky, and both electronic devices will recognize each other and adjust their own settings properly, and the laptop will be displayed on the TV.  However, this doesn't always happen.  When it doesn't...\nFirst, always check and make sure the external display (TV in your case) is powered on and all its cables and connections are properly seated.  In order for the TV to sync, a few things need to happen, the MBP has to recognize that a TV is connected (which you say is happening), the TV has to recognize that a video source is present (unclear if this is happening), the TV has to be set to the proper Input or Source (Input numbers on the back and sides of TV don't always correlate to the Input number in the TV Menu), and the format of the video coming from the laptop must be supported by the television.  \nIt sounds like the laptop is doing everything it should, so focus your attention on the TV.  Cycle through all the different inputs in the TV.  Try different HDMI ports.   If that doesn't work, it could actually be the Mini DP to HDMI adapter.  Try and connect the laptop and adapter to another HDMI device.  If it still doesn't work the another device, then the adapter may be bad.  If it does work with another device, then either the TV has an issue with HDMI inputs, or the settings in the TV are preventing it from working properly.  Possibly try and reset the TV back to its default settings.  \n\nA: (Just putting an answer here to close the loop)\nTo do this conversion of display signals, mini DisplayPort to HDMI, it should be done with an active adapter rather than a less inexpensive passive adapter.  This is because Active adapters \"recreates\" the signal and passive just reorders the existing signals.\nFor more details, see the linked answer here on Ask Different\n", "Q: Google Calendar will not sync with Calendar.app after Yosemite I recently clean installed Yosemite on my 11\" Macbook Air and my Google calendar will not sync with Calendar.app. Everything else on my Google account syncs with no problem, but the calendar refuses.

(One on each screen)\n\nA: There is no way of doing that.\n\nWhen the Dock is configured to appear at the bottom of your screen, it's available on whichever screen you’re working on. Just move your pointer to the bottom of either display. When the Dock is configured for the left or right position, it appears on the leftmost or rightmost display edge.\nTip: If you don't see your dock because it's set to hidden or there's a full screen app on the display, move your pointer to the location of the Dock. If the Dock still doesn't appear, swipe your pointer towards the Dock again to unhide it.\n\nSource: OS X: Using multiple displays in Mavericks\n\nA: I had Dock on all monitors, but suddenly it stopped working.

I just called by my lawyers 133 times for some very important message. My iPhone is just 3 meters in front of me being charged.\nFinally my lawyer come to my apartment and we both saw that the iPhone is fully charged but not turned on.\nI thought charging iPhone would automatically turn it on.\nI did more research. I found out that most people have the opposite problem.\nWhy does my iPhone turn on when I plug it in to charge?\nPeople are complaining about the iPhone keeps turning on and  I have the opposite problem.\nActually how does iPhone officially behave? If I charge it, should it be turned on by itself?\n\nA: When an iPhone is plugged in, it will boot up (that is actually a common techniques used for restarting an iPhone if the power button doesn't work for some reason). \nIf the iPhone is powered off while charging, it will remain powered off and will not automatically come back on. \nI understand that you have an iPhone 4 and there is the chance that it was having trouble receiving calls unrelated to the power. However, if the phone was powered off when you checked, that is the simple answer as the cause of the missed calls. \n", "Q: Terminal.app magically changing color values Terminal.app does some very odd color shifting that makes it impossible to match colors consistently, and I'm wondering if there is any way to disable it or better control it. The \"magic\" is what shows purple instead of blue, for example, even when the ansi color for the theme is set to plain blue.\nThis behavior appears to be tied to setting the background color... setting any background color (with terminfo setab capability) disables the \"magic\" color shift, while an attribute reset (sgr0) re-enables it.\nThis is my test (sets the foreground, prints some unicode filled blocks, explicitly sets the background to black, prints again):\nb=$'\\xE2\\x96\\x88' && bs=$b$b$b$b$b$b$b$b &&\n  tput setaf 4 && echo -n \"$bs\" &&\n  tput setab 0 && echo \"$bs\"\n\nWith the default theme, it prints purple (magic) then blue (ansi). So, my first attempt was to sample the purple color, and update the preferences to use that purple instead of blue... everything should be consistent now, right?\nOn the next run, I get a slightly brighter purple and then the purple I entered. At first I thought I just put the color in wrong, but as I kept brightening the color setting to match what Terminal.app was showing without the background set explicitly, the Terminal.app just kept getting brighter too -- all the way up until it was white!\nFrom this, it seems to me that Terminal.app is automatically scaling the the colors displayed on the default background color by some factor, but it leaves colors on any explicitly set background alone; making it impossible for the two colors ever to match (except white and black).\nFWIW, the window background is set to fully-opaque black.\nIs there any way to get rid of this behavior? I'm thinking that this is maybe bug-report-worthy, but I'm curious if there is just something I'm missing.\n\nA: In order to get the right color scheme the background needs to be explicitly declared inside LSCOLOR (gnu) or LS_COLOR (linux) and match the non-ANSI one set in your Terminal.app (i.e. Window > Background > Color and Effects).\nSo, something like LSCOLORS=eadafafacafafacacaeaea would work while something like LSCOLORS=exdxfxfxcxfxfxcxcxexex wouldn't.\n", "Q: DNS works in terminal but not elsewhere in Mac OS I have an issue similar to the one in this question: DNS not resolving on Mac OS.\nThings out on the Internet work fine.

(Using Yosemite.) The answer from the previously linked thread about bouncing mDNSResponder sounded promising, but that doesn't appear to exist in Yosemite.\n\nA: Why does it work in Terminal and why doesn't it work in Mac OS? The answer to your first part is in man dig or man host:\n\nThe dig command does not use the host name and address resolution or the DNS query routing mechanisms used by other processes running on Mac OS X.  The results of name or address queries printed by dig may differ from those found by other processes that use the Mac OS X native name and address resolution mechanisms.  The results of DNS queries may also differ from queries that use the Mac OS X DNS routing library.\n\nTo answer the second part, I would run a packet trace and see if the query packets are going out, and if so, to where? tcpdump -i en0 -vnnt \"udp port 53\"\nmDNS is for Bonjour discovery; I don't believe it has much to do with standard DNS but don't quote me on that.\n\nA: When your local area network has been configured with a domain name ending in .local, then all LAN hostname resolutions queried by a Mac (~10.3-10.10) will be passed to mDNS first - bypassing unicast DNS!\nDig and nslookup are unicast DNS utilities, so they will both bypass the system hostname resolution order (files->mDNS->DNS) and query unicast DNS directly.\nYou may fix this by changing the local domain name to use a TLD other than .local.\nThis is very common in split-horizon DNS and heterogenous but Windows-dominated company networks. A lot of Windows sysadmins are used to the .local TLD as valid private TLD name since at least a decade.\n\nA: We have a similar ongoing problem at our company. As far as we can tell, it seems like for some reason the OS stops appending some host names with the default search domain.\nI wrote a simple script to fix it that changes the default search domain to google.com, pings the affected host (which fails), then changes the default search domain back to empty. It works but does not fix the root cause of the problem. This script only changes the setting for the wi-fi interface because that is all we need, please keep that in mind.\nnetworksetup -setsearchdomains Wi-Fi google.com\n\nsleep 3; ping hostname\n\nsleep 3; networksetup -setsearchdomains Wi-Fi empty\n\n", "Q: Calendar Event Color I want to arrange different calendar events with different colors.

At seemingly random times, but at least once a day, the ports become nonfunctional and I have to restart the computer to use them again. Here's how I'm using the ports:\n\n\n*\n\n*Left-side USB: I have 2-4 tablets and phones connected through a powered hub. I've tried two different hubs and two different cables going to the hub, but that hasn't helped. When the problem occurs, the phones and tablets still receive power through USB, but can no longer sync with the computer. They no longer appear in apps like iTunes or iPhoto, and Xcode and Android Studio can't connect to them.\n\n*Thunderbolt, next to the USB: I switch between a FireWire 800 drive and an Ethernet cable, connected with Apple's FireWire and Ethernet adapters. I've tried two different FireWire drives and two different FireWire cables. When the problem occurs, the light on the FireWire drive turns on, but the drive doesn't mount and Drive Utility can't see it. When I have the Ethernet connected, the Network control panel shows the Thunderbolt Ethernet status as Cable Unplugged.\n\n*Thunderbolt, next to the power: I have an external display connected with a Mini DisplayPort cable. When the problem occurs, the display is unaffected.\n\n*Right-side USB: I usually don't use this port, but sometimes I have a tablet connected directly there and it is still working when the problem occurs. However, if I then unplug the USB hub from the left side and move it to the right side, one of two things will happen: 1) the right-side port will go to the same state as the left side, with no ability to see devices, even if I switch back to the single device that was connected before, or 2) all keyboard and mouse input will stop -- the built-in keyboard and trackpad, and an Apple Bluetooth keyboard and trackpad. At that point, the cursor will be frozen on the screen and the caps lock key will not light up when pressed, but the power key still invokes the sleep/restart/shutdown dialog.\nI've searched Google and the Apple discussion forums and haven't found any other reports of this ... plenty of USB ports dying permanently, but not temporarily until a restart. I've also checked the console log, but haven't seen anything that seems relevant. I've been trying to notice what action triggers the problem, but I haven't been able to determine that yet.\nI'm running Mac OS 10.9.5 ... perhaps the 10.10 upgrade would solve it, but I'm not eager to adjust to a new OS since I've had to spend lots of time adjusting to the new computer this month.\nDoes anyone have an idea of why this happens, or any additional troubleshooting I can do? Also, is there any way to restart just the part of the OS that manages these ports, without restarting the whole computer?\nUpdate with a couple clues\nMy USB ports were working when I finished work last night, and put my MacBook Pro to sleep by selecting Sleep in the Apple menu (leaving the screen open). When I came in to work this morning, the MBP was awake, and the USB ports weren't working. I checked the console from the time I put it to sleep and found these messages that seem to show it waking right back up again:\n11/21/14 5:01:40.000 AM kernel[0]: AppleCamIn::systemWakeCall - messageType = 0xE0000340\n11/21/14 5:01:40.000 AM kernel[0]: AppleThunderboltNHIType2::waitForOk2Go2Sx - retries = 43\n11/21/14 5:01:43.000 AM kernel[0]: Wake reason: EC.DarkPME (Maintenance)\n11/21/14 5:01:43.000 AM kernel[0]: AppleCamIn::systemWakeCall - messageType = 0xE0000340\n11/21/14 5:01:43.000 AM kernel[0]: AppleCamIn::wakeEventHandlerThread\n11/21/14 5:01:43.000 AM kernel[0]: Previous Sleep Cause: 5\n11/21/14 5:01:43.000 AM kernel[0]: IOPPF: Sent gpu-internal-single-slice-plimit-notification last value 0 (rounded time weighted average 0)\n11/21/14 5:01:43.000 AM kernel[0]: IOPPF: Sent gpu-internal-plimit-notification last value 0 (rounded time weighted average 0)\n11/21/14 5:01:43.000 AM kernel[0]: AppleThunderboltNHI::prePCIWake - power up complete - took 0 us\n11/21/14 5:01:43.000 AM kernel[0]: IOThunderboltSwitch<0xffffff8036012400>(0x0)::listenerCallback - Thunderbolt HPD packet for route = 0x0 port = 12 unplug = 0\n11/21/14 5:01:43.000 AM kernel[0]: TBT W (2): 0x0001 [√]\n11/21/14 5:01:43.000 AM kernel[0]: **** [IOBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport][SuspendDevice] -- Resume -- suspendDeviceCallResult = 0x0000 (kIOReturnSuccess) -- 0xcc00 ****\n11/21/14 5:01:43.000 AM kernel[0]: IOThunderboltSwitch<0xffffff8036012400>(0x0)::listenerCallback - Thunderbolt HPD packet for route = 0x0 port = 3 unplug = 0\n11/21/14 5:01:43.000 AM kernel[0]: ARPT: 61054.632953: si_survive_perst_war: bar0win before 18003000, bar0win after 18001000\n11/21/14 5:01:43.000 AM kernel[0]: ARPT: 61054.636742: pcicore_pci_pmeclr PMECSR : 0x4008\n11/21/14 5:01:43.000 AM kernel[0]: ARPT: 61054.636751: pcicore_pmestatclr PMECSR : 0x4008\n11/21/14 5:01:43.000 AM kernel[0]: ARPT: 61054.636897: pcicore_pci_pmeclr PMECSR : 0x4008\n11/21/14 5:01:43.000 AM kernel[0]: AppleUSBMultitouchDriver::checkStatus - received Status Packet, Payload 2: device was reinitialized\n11/21/14 5:01:43.293 AM hidd[90]: MultitouchHID: device bootloaded\n11/21/14 5:01:43.000 AM kernel[0]: en0: BSSID changed to 40:8b:07:c0:a3:94\n11/21/14 5:01:43.000 AM kernel[0]: AppleThunderboltHAL::earlyWake - complete - took 479 milliseconds\n\nI also have tons of these, but they also occur when USB is working, so I don't know if they're related. I Googled that and found that it has to do with iTunes trying to sync with my iPhone, which had a working USB connection at the time:\n11/21/14 5:01:43.007 AM com.apple.usbmuxd[65]: DeviceRequestAsync failed: 0xe0004057\n\nI also have a couple of these, which seems relevant:\n11/21/14 5:02:35.000 AM kernel[0]: AppleUSBHub::setPowerState(0x82758cc542ea13c3, 2 -> 4) timed out after 42242 ms\n\nThen this morning, after I noticed USB wasn't working again, I tried sleeping and waking the computer and found that it would not go to sleep. And then these lines appear in the console:\n11/21/14 11:23:54.000 AM kernel[0]: AppleSMC: bad busy count (255,1)\n11/21/14 11:23:54.000 AM kernel[0]: Backtrace 0xffffff8000692d5e 0xffffff800069477c 0xffffff7f810ca780 0xffffff80006cd7b2 0xffffff80002b29ef 0xffffff8000226bc1 0xffffff80002139c5\n11/21/14 11:23:54.000 AM kernel[0]: Kernel Extensions in backtrace:\n11/21/14 11:23:54.000 AM kernel[0]: com.apple.driver.AppleSMC(3.1.8)[6FA91D9F-0745-3E0C-884B-CB1489A21F25]@0xffffff7f954c3000->0xffffff7f954d5fff\n11/21/14 11:23:54.000 AM kernel[0]: dependency: com.apple.iokit.IOACPIFamily(1.4)[045D5D6F-AD1E-36DB-A249-A346E2B48E54]@0xffffff7f954b0000\n11/21/14 11:23:54.000 AM kernel[0]: AppleSMC: bad busy count (255,1)\n11/21/14 11:24:20.000 AM kernel[0]: USBF:    83510.168    AppleUSBHubPort: Port 1 of Hub at 0x14000000 about to terminate a busy device (USB2.0 Hub) after waiting 10 seconds\n\nSo, it seems that the internal USB hub has crashed, which prevents the computer from sleeping. It also suggests that trying to sleep the computer is what crashed it in the first place, but I'll do more testing with that. First, I need to restart again. While I'm doing that, I'll try a hardware test and an SMC reset, since one of the log entries mentioned an SMC error.\nUpdate from Genius Bar\nI spent about two hours trying to replicate the issue before taking my computer to the Genius Bar, but I couldn't. I'm pretty sure the problem is related to sleeping the computer, but it only happens when I haven't noticed exactly what triggered it. Anyway, the Mac Genius said it was not a hardware problem since it always works again after a restart. He theorized that one of my USB devices caused some garbage to be written to the computer hard drive, which breaks the USB functionality, but gets cleared out after a restart. He ran fsck -fy as a possible fix, and then I went home, hopeful that would do the job.\nUnfortunately, that changed for the worse. Now my computer sometimes loses its USB ports when sleeping, and sometimes restarts itself when sleeping. The restart is something I've never seen before. I put the computer to sleep, then when I wake it up later, it takes a long time for the screen to turn on, and when it does, I'm at the login screen. When I log in, I see all my saved application states opening and I see the \"you restarted because of a problem...\" message. It's weird because I don't see a kernel panic screen or hear the startup chime. The crash log that appears in the \"you restarted\" dialog is titled \"Sleep Wake Failure.\"\nI can't tell if that's another symptom of the same problem, or a different problem entirely. In the short term, I've found that if I always unplug my USB devices before sleeping the computer, there's no problem. In the long term, I'll do more research on \"Sleep Wake Failure,\" starting with this long thread, and then maybe try an Erase and Install.\n\nA: I took my December 2014 Retina MacBook Pro into the Apple Store with the problem but they couldn't reproduce it in the store and asked that I come back with a device that demonstrates the problem. That evening, I spent some time at the office and at home trying to reproduce the problem while capturing it on video. I was able to reproduce it with a DAS Keyboard, Logitech Mouse, a Dell Keyboard and a Dell Mouse (via USB port).\nI brought the system and two devices into the store but I started out offering to show them one of the videos. The Genius Bar Tech watched one and agreed to replace the logic board. It's at the Apple Store now and I expect to get it back sometime next week. This problem is most intermittent - it took a fair number of tries to get it to show up these couple of times.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQPl2DaUrc\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxG0loDpes8\nEDIT:\nI got my system back with the new logic board and the problem is still there. I think that I'm just going to live with it as it's typically cleared up with a plug/unplug and reboot. If it becomes a hassle, then I'll get a port hub, either Thunderbolt or USB 3.0.\nIt appears that this is a problem in currently shipping product. Hopefully they will eventually fix it.\n\nA: I have been battling the same issue of my USB ports no working when I disconnect from my external monitor and keyboard.\nI was able to reset my USB ports by resetting the SMC following the steps on the site below. The USB drive needed to be plugged in when resetting, in my case a USB keyboard. I took a couple tries but worked on the second attempt. \nhttp://macs.about.com/od/usingyourmac/qt/Resetting-The-Smc-System-Management-Controller-On-Your-Mac.htm\n\nA: Im having the same problem with my week old MacBook Pro, I'm editing via Avid Media Composer and Panasonic P2, the connection between the P2 card device in my case a Panasonic AG-HPG20 card player recorder keeps losing connection and then reconnects and so on, tried using my camera as the device but still the same problem.\nI've now discovered its the power supply as when I use the Mac without the mains charger plugged in the problem does not occur, Ive also discovered that there is a humming noise coming from the charger, I still have my old Mac (2009) and charger, the old charger is silent, unfortunately Apple change the plug connection so cant swap. Will be popping into my local Apple store to swap it...\nHope that info helps other people, took me a long time to work it out....!\n\nA: Thanks for the SMC reset details. This might be helpful for some, I have a MBP 11,3 (2014, 15inch). Last night I ran into a similar problem, my left usb port stopped working. \nWhat I did was, a force shutdown and start it. Holding the power button for 10 secs and start with all its ports disconnected.\nFor some reason this worked. USB works. This might work for some  (at least in my case) not for everyone.\n", "Q: iTunes: How do I export a podcast as an mp3 to my phone? I downloaded a free podcast, I see it in my saved episodes.

I mean, can they make the print smaller? \nHow? Where is it?\nDo I need to set up a account and sync my devices? \n\nA: Podcasts can be synced to your iPhone when connected to iTunes. These will then be available in the Podcasts app on your phone. \nWhen you have your iPhone connected to iTunes view your device page in iTunes. Then click on Podcasts and from here you can manage your podcasts on your phone.\nI am assuming that you are using iTunes and have an iPhone, you didnt state this in your question (although you have added these tags).\n", "Q: What are api.smoot.apple.com and other hosts my iPhone is secretly talking to?

Note this is regarding Yosemite, but I would imagine it similarly applies to Mobile Safari on iOS, especially since the hostname is the same (emphasis mine):\n\nThere are two \"Spotlight Suggestions\":\n\n*\n\n*\"Spotlight Suggestions\" in Safari\n\n*\"Spotlight Suggestions\" in Spotlight\n\nBoth query the same servers, both use the same name, and both return the same information.\nA reasonable person might believe that, having followed Apple's instructions for disabling \"Spotlight Suggestions\" (the Spotlight kind), they'd disabled \"Spotlight Suggestions\" (the Safari kind) -- especially if you didn't actually see any suggestions appear in Safari (I didn't!).\nMark Rowe, Safari developer at Apple: \"That’s probably a fair complaint.\" https://twitter.com/bdash/status/524005838743035904\n...\nThe network query posted here is actually a search metrics POST, not a live search query, and it's used as metrics for local and remote search performance.\n\n\nA: I think this is just Apple's remote keylogger service.  I imagine iOS devices behave the same as OS X.  On OS X, every single keypress is sent to api.smoot.apple.com along very accurate longitude and latitude and device information.\nIt might be a little fuzzy, but you can see in the screen capture below that with each keypress there is a GET request that carries this information to Apple.  At the immediate instant that you start searching your computer, typing characters, each character you type is sent to Apple.  On the final request the full string is sent.  Besides the keylogging, you can also see that your exact location as you type is sent.\nOn your local network, you can try and block this.  I doubt that you can regain any privacy if you're using a mobile device.\n\nUpdate: \nOctober 14, 2016\nI check on this problem ever so often.  As of this date and macOS Sierra version 10.12, it is still transmitting abundant data via GET HTTP requests on each keystroke, including precise latitude and longitude, live, for local machine searches.  I do wish there was full disclosure so that all users were made fully aware of how invasive this feature can be and clear options for either disabling it or even better, making it so that data is only sent when explicitly chosen to send.  While it might be a minor inconvenience if a user opted to do so, it would be just great if we could click a button or hit tab to perform a search via the web vs our local machines.\n\n\nA: api.smoot.apple.com is another norm in the industry. It does quite a few things like most vendor api's do.  Its used to assist users and make their lives easier by providing suggestions, advertisements, and whatever the vendor deems appropriate.\nHowever, no vendor is a saint and Apple is no different; its a business.  If that includes using your network to transmit your data to them in aggregate or by keystroke, then they have no reason not to put themselves in the pipeline to collect and use what they deem appropriate.\nIt is the same with Google.  In Chrome's settings, you can disable everything, but you can not prevent it from communicating with its API.  I tested a few months ago and Chrome would not render a single webpage i put in the address bar if i blocked the google api.  If I have turned all those settings off, what is being sent to Google?  So, Chrome has already forced itself into user's data pipeline.  It is by definition a trojan, but lets not start name-calling.  The industry trend started many years ago.    \nIntel WiDi...I really need to connect to the Intel api every time I launch WiDi on my PC...really Intel?  I could not opt-out of the auto-updater?\nMicrosoft Windows 10...just try to stop it from changing itself to facilitate \"security\" or collection of data regarding your desktop environment.  You agreed to allow it when you installed Windows.\nIn fairness to app vendors, it is the norm and users allow it because they want the functionality.  A legitimate app wont install unless users agree to whatever permissions the app says it needs.  No one bothers to look at all that because, hey, I need a flashlight app right now; who cares if it requires permissions to read my text messages and read my SD card...in order for me to install it...so I can use my camera flash like a flashlight right now.  Most apps are up front with their permission requirements...most users just don't care; make what i want happen right now.\nAnd just to clarify, Michael Prescott's post above about \"while searching\"...do you think your phone keyboard, which is used for text messages and every other app on your phone does not communicate with an api? (Android or Apple device immaterial) \nIn order to trend a user and correlate patterns vendors can use, vendors need to uniquely track users for targeted marketing before they depersonalize it...conveniently, a user's OS (apple or windows) has an advertisement id enabled automatically...\n\nA: I recently had this issue and found out its a ssh command  group.com.apple.PegasusConfiguration- zsh or bash modules, which can be used to access ur data. read more info on here .\nhttps://podcast.intego.com/262\n", "Q: Iphone 6 plus will not default to SMS when other user iphone is not on wifi My iphone 6 plus will not revert to SMS when another iphone user is off wifi.\nNo problems before when I had an iphone 4s full plan and hubby had iphone 3gs go phone (no data) the imessage app worked great.\nNow the iphone 4s is a go phone (no data plan)upgraded to ios 8.1.1.

How should the pdf know, when it is added?\nIf your mds is consuming lots of CPU time ou should re-index your Spotlight Database like mentioned here\n", "Q: Error in applescript \"Invalid index\" I have an automator workflow which works fine except for a part of it - applescript. \nThis is how the workflow goes -\nRun applescript (this part works fine) - \non run {input, parameters}\n\n    tell application \"Mail\" to set theMessageText to content of (get first message of inbox)\n    set x to text ((offset of \"9\" in theMessageText) + 2) thru ((offset of \" \" in theMessageText) - 1) of theMessageText\nend run\n\nSet value for variable (The name of the variable is 'number')\nGet value for variable (I have made sure that this receives no direct input from previous actions.

On Yosemite, I don't use Safari at all. Never.\nEvery now and then (like once a week or so), Safari automatically opens, without my interaction and it does not even come to forefront, it just remains in the background, and I notice it when I go to the dock to open something else and notice it is there.\nIt appears to just want to connect to apple home page (no suspicious tabs or anything that I can see).   \nAnyone has any suggestions? \n\nA: I was having the same problem, about twice a day. I installed Little Snitch to see what servers were involved, and I noticed a Dashlane server was one of them. I disabled the Dashlane extension in Safari and it hasn't happened for the last 24 hours.\n\nA: I've been having a similar problem. I will have text selected in some other application, and I will use a keyboard shortcut, and suddenly my Mac has opened Safari, gone to Yahoo, and searched for the text I had selected. This was very annoying and surprising, because Safari is not my default browser. And I don't have Dashline or any other Safari extensions installed. But I finally figured it out. I went to System Preferences : Keyboard, clicked on the Shortcuts tab, then chose \"Services\" on the left. (I actually got there from the Spotlight preferences, which has a button that took me to keyboard preferences.) There's a long list of services to scroll through. I found one called \"Search with Yahoo,\" and it was checked. (I assume it said \"Yahoo\" because that was my default search engine in Safari.) \n \nThe check box assigned a keyboard shortcut of command-shift-L (which I use all the time in another application, and only when something is selected). So I unchecked it and the problem has gone away. \nI don't know if this helps you, but it might be useful to go through the keyboard shortcuts to see what you find.\n", "Q: Change Default Photo Aspect Ratio in iOS Is there a way to set the default photo aspect ratio to 3:2 (from 4:3) in the default camera app in iOs?  I know it can be done using different photo apps, and I know that photos can be cropped to a variety of aspect ratios after they’ve been taken. But I’m looking for a way to set it before taking photos, using the default camera app.\n\nA: Unfortunately, with iOS where it is right now, this is not possible. We have watched progressive improvements over time with the default camera app but there are still quite a number of limitations regarding \"defaults\" in the camera app. \n", "Q: How to restore an account from a lost mac from time machine? I have 2 computers : an iMac and a MBP. My old MBP is dead.

I have maximized them such that the document completely occupies the left half and the browser completely occupies the right half of the screen ( I do this easily with the keyboard shortcuts of Spectacle)\nWhat is the keyboard shortcut to navigate quickly between these two visible windows?\nCmd + Tab is not ideal because if I use multiple virtual desktops(like workspaces in Linux) and I go to a third application there in another desktop, when I come back to the virtual desktop which contains my browser and document, Cmd + Tab brings in the third application to the mix.\nCmd+Space and then typing the application name(e.g the browser application or the document application) is the closest I could get to what I originally wanted.\nIs there a software or configuration that I can use to get this functionality?\n\nA: Those would be\nControl+F4 - Move focus to the active (or next) window\nShift+Control+F4 - Move focus to the previously active window\nIf you have the \"F keys as standard function keys\" option disabled in System Preferences > Keyboard, enable it.\n\nOr use Fn in addition to the above shortcuts.\n", "Q: \"The app isn't available, Try again.\" on TestFlight I'm trying to set up Internal Testing for my iOS app. I've submitted the build to the app store, and it is awaiting review happily. I have a group of Technical users in iTunes Connect with Internal Testing available, and I have invited them all to test the app.\nHowever, when any of use click the button in the e-mail (using the Mail app on the relevant device), Testflight opens and then says \"The app isn't available. Try again.\"\nGoogling for this error has been completely futile (it's a googlewhack!) - is there a simple delay before the app is available? It has been several hours. Has anybody else experienced this and can maybe tell me what step I have missed?\n\nA: I solved the issue by removing all Internal Testers. Then I disabled Testflight Beta Testing on the Pre-release page.\nThen I enabled Pre-release, navigated to Internal Testers and selected users to invite - and that invite worked fine.\n\nA: The app must reviewed before you can start distributing your beta.\n\nApps made available to external testers require a Beta App Review and must comply with the full App Store Review Guidelines before testing can begin. A review is required for new versions of your app that contain significant changes. Up to 10 apps can be tested at a time, internally or externally.\n\nTestFlight Beta Testing\n", "Q: How do I clone my drive to a external USB drive? I have CarbonCopyCloner but it cannot see my new SSD in the destination section. The destination drive is a USB-attached SSD.\nHow do I clone to this drive in CarbonCopyCloner?\n\nA: Before you can clone your hard drive with CarbonCopyCloner, you need to create a partition on the drive and format it appropriately for use with your Mac. Most external drives come pre-formatted for use with Windows machines.\nYou can use Disk Utility for this purpose. You'll find Disk Utility under /Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility on your machine.\nIn Disk Utility, look along the left hand bar for the USB-attached drive. If it has a partition on it already you'll see the drive listed, with the partition indented below the drive in the list:\n\nSelect the drive, not the partition, and then use the Erase tab on wipe the drive. You want to format the drive as Mac OS Extended (Journaled). You can give the drive a friendly name if you like. Once Disk Utility has wiped and formatted the drive with the appropriate file system you'll be able to use it as a clone target in CarbonCopyCloner:\n\n\nA: IN DISK UTILITY SELECTED PARTITION THEN MADE 1 PARTITION ADDED A NAME FOR THIS SSD PARTITION AND APPLIED. THIS DID THE TRICK. NOW I CAN SEE NEW SSD IN FINDER AND CAN LOAD INDIVIDUAL FILES AND ALSO SEE IN CARBON COPY CLONER FOR FULL CLONE BACK UP.\n", "Q: Office 2011 - option + left / right keyboard shortcut not working When using Microsoft Office 2011 (Word, Powerpoint and Excel) on my Macbook Pro (running OS X 10.9.5) the option + left arrow, option + shift + left arrow, option + right arrow and option + shift + right arrow keyboard shortcuts don't work as they should e.g. skip (select) forward or back a word. This functionality works in non-Microsoft programs such as at the command line. All other keyboard shortcuts are working as they should.\nI have checked under Tools > Customise Keyboard and they are assigned correctly. I have tried resetting shortcuts both within Office and in System Preferences without success. This has been going on a while - through successive Office updates. As a work-around I have reassigned this functionality to another shortcut but would like to know what the problem is.\nAnyone experiencing similar or knows a solution?\n\nA: I had my keyboard set to Unicode Hex Input. Setting this to Australian or English resolved the problem.\n", "Q: Cannot delete mail from storage in Usage section of IPhone In the usage section of IPhone 5 it says I have 349MB inn Mail.  However, I have deleted ALL inbox, sent, trash etc...there is nothing in the mail.  How do I get the Storage in the Usage section to empty this mail?  Thanks\n\nA: Try rebooting the phone. Press and hold Home+Sleep until the Apple logo appears.\nIf that doesn't work, and the email account you are using with Mail is not connected using POP3, then try removing the email account and re-adding it. Go to Settings app > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > tap on the specific account > Delete Account. Confirm that you want to delete it, and reboot the phone - press and hold Home + Sleep until the Apple logo appears. Re-add the account by going to Settings app > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Add Account.\n\nA: Tubedogg is correct, but I would like to add that his method for rebooting the phone actually forces the phone to reboot. This is good for when the phone is non-responsive or you are doing other troubleshooting steps. But it should not be necessary for most applications, including this one. Simply holding down the Sleep button (at the top of the phone, or side if it is a 6/6+) until you get a control that tells you to slide to power off. That is a graceful shutdown.\nRemoving the account may work and is worth a try. failing that you may want to backup the phone then wipe it: Settings -> General -> Reset -> Erase all content and settings. Once it is wiped, just restore from the backup you just made.\nDoing that cleared up a lot of free space on my phone (a 5 with 8.1).\n", "Q: Finder: unlock files grid in folders Using Finder:\nIn some folders, I can move the files around.

I then updated to 10.10.1 and started to see some strange behaviour. At first I didn't notice, but it turns out I can not connect to remote ssh-boxes anymore. Local connections (including those via open-vpn tun-interface to a remote host) seem to work fine though.\nLooking at a TCP dump when trying to connect to a box via internet revealed the following strange fact:\nmy.internal.ip.address.50596 > gl02.opentracker.net.ssh: Flags [S], cksum 0x7b7d (correct), seq 4179750266, win 65535, options [mss 1460,nop,wscale 5,nop,nop,TS val 958226379 ecr 0,sackOK,eol], length 0\n\nDoing the same one an up-to-date Mavericks box shows no signs of \"gl02.opentracker.net\" address and everything works just as it should be.\nSince I cannot find a way to prevent (or even change/turn off) this \"feature\" on my MacBookPro, I consider this to be HARMFUL and an unwanted intrusion / exploitation (go take a look at ww.opentracker.net - I do NOT want to be anal-yzed by those guys!!!).\nSo here are my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is my Mac trying to connect to \"gl02.opentracker.net\"?\n\n*Where does this behavior come from?\n\n*How can I turn this off?\n\n*Is this a malicious attempt to break my security? (--> thinking \"Root-Pipe\" exploit I heard about)\n\n*If so, where do I find people with proper digital-forensics knowledge and further information about this subject?\n\n\nIf you need more information regarding the configuration of my machine, please tell me which commands to run / config-files to provide to help track down this issue.\nThanks.\n\nA: opentracker.net is a service provider that offers analytics. My guess is that your redirection happens when you are connected to a network provider that internally uses opentracker.net.\nI suggest you try again from another network provider.\n", "Q: mac os x - UNIX domain sockets in abstract namespace Are they possible?\nAccording to this it is possible starting from Mac osx 10.9. Ctrl + F for \"New support for Abstract namespace sockets\" on that page. But I was not able to find one single example for Mac.\nAlso in Linux the sockets created in the abstract name space you can see them in /proc/net/unix (cat -v /proc/net/unix).\nThe mac does not have /proc/...\nWhere can I expect to find them? Does it have something similar to Linux?\nThanks.\n\nA: The developer documentation linked is for perl, not Mac OS X. The documentation states that perl v5.11.0 is capable of supporting abstract socket namespaces.\nThe undocumented assumption is that the underlying operating system also provides this support.\nI am not aware of any Apple documentation saying Mac OS X supports abstract namespace sockets.\n", "Q: Is it still possible to update my iPad from iOS 7.0.4 to IOS 7.1.2 and not to iOS 8? Can i upgrade my iPad 2 iOS 7.0.4 to iOS 7.1.2 ? I dont want to install iOS 8. I'm afraid of the performance issues and jailbreak possibilities of my iPad 2 running on iOS 8.\n\nA: Nope. It's not possible on any iPad or iPhone because Apple stops signing the older iOS versions after newer ones are released. It's impossible to upgrade to iOS 7.1.2\nThree options you have right now\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrade to iOS 8.1 [download the firmware separately and update before Apple stops signing] \n\n*Upgrade to iOS 8.1.1 from iTunes\n\n*Stay on iOS 7.0.4\niOS 8.1 has jailbreak, so this could be your chance to upgrade before the window closes.\n\nA: From anecdotal comments from several friends with iPad2s, the 8.1.1 update did fix some performance issues. One acquaintance who was all set to splurge on a second-hand iPad Air1, installed 8.1.1 and is now very happy that her money can be spent elsewhere.\nApple quite prominently mentions that 8.1.1 fixes performance issues with iPad2, but ArsTechnica actually published some benchmarks and the improvements are mostly minor.\nYour milage may vary, however, depending on what you are doing with the iPad.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 13\" with Retina Display: Black Screen So this is not my computer, but my girlfriends. She was doing thesis work in the library when all of a sudden the screen to her Macbook began to malfunction. At the point it is at now, whenever it is booted up, it makes the normal booting sound yet the screen is completely black with gray bars in the center. The bars span the screen vertically, but are compacted into an almost solid gray bar horizontally.\nThe first repair shop nearby claimed that it was a broken screen that needed replacing, but I would like to see if anyone else has ideas before accepting that solution. Could it also possibly be issues with the integrated graphics card? Has anyone else had this issue?\nAnd as a less technical issue, what would be required to use an external display with a Macbook Pro?\n\nA: There is a small possibility that the video cable is mis-seated and simply unplugging it and re-plugging it in might help.  ifixit.com can help you with the take-apart.  It is not difficult, just make sure you ground yourself and disconnect the battery before touching anything.\nHas the machine been dropped?\nHas anything been spilled on it?\nIs the LCD panel physically broken?\nTo connect a Macbook Pro to an external display you simply need the proper video adapter.  Either Mini-Misplayport to VGA or Mini-DisplayPort to DVI, depending on the monitor.  Most monitors have many options, including both VGA and DVI.\nIf the laptop and monitor are new enough you can use an HDMI cable.\nTo further diagnose your girlfriend's broken laptop connect it to an external monitor.  If the lines appear on the external monitor then the issue is the Logic Board.  If it works fine then you have a LVDS cable or LCD Panel issue and will need a new display clamshell.  iResQ.com does cheap display repairs.  No, I don't work for them. :)\n\nA: Just wanted to add, don't forget that you have warranty on your device... If it is a retina display MBP I'm guessing it's not overly old, so may still be within the limited warranty period (even if it's not in warranty it's likely Apple will still help you) — especially seeing as you said that there is no accidental damage also (and yes, I do work for them...)\n\nA: *\n\n*do an SMC reset\n\n*see if it'll drive external display ok.\n\n\nIf it is good on external display, then it's likely the LCD or the LVDS cable (most likely)..\nit could also be the connection at the logic board (cheapest point to check first, but BE VERY CAREFUL - - easy connector to bend/break, and very expensive if you damage it).\n", "Q: Error opening txt file on MacOSx I am getting this strange error on Mac OS X. When I am trying to open a text file using 'TextEdit' or 'TextWrangler' I am getting this message \"Verifying filename.txt\". This message pops up and then after a while whole system comes to halt. I have to forcefully shutdown the system. I was able to open these files previously with either of the two applications. I have OS X Mavericks (10.9).\nHas anyone faced a situation like this? What can be the remedy?\n\nA: Without seeing the screencap, it really sounds like a filesystem error to me, yeah I could be full of little red ants but the first thing I would do is open disk utility and do two things, repair permissions and verify the disk (you cant repair it, repair will be greyed out).\nIf permissions repair works you are golden, if the disk does not pass verification, boot into recovery mode (reboot holding COMMAND-R) and run disk utility and repair the disk.\nIf that doesn't fix it (EG Disk Utility returns an error message) it may be time for a third party repair tool like Diskwarrior or Drive Genius. If THAT fails then it's time to backup, reformat and reinstall the O/S and restore your Apps and files... You do have a backup, don't you?\n", "Q: Shrinking extremely large window I have a very large window on Mavericks. The window is so large that I can't seem to get the mouse to the lower right corner to shrink the size of the window. How can I reduce the size of this window? Is there some keyboard shortcut?\n\nA: If you can see the top left corner of the window, there should be a Red, Yellow and Green circle.  \n\nIf you click the Green circle, the window should resize so that its entirety is visible.  You can then drag any side or corner to the desired size.  \n\nA: Alternative method, even though the first method works & was accepted as the correct answer... this also works for attached file-picker sheets where you cannot reach the red/yellow/green dots.\nShift/drag any visible edge of a window will simultaneously resize it from all sides except the side opposite to the drag; then enabling you to drag it to a new position.\n", "Q: I am not a company but am trying to avoid having to buy multiple individual iOS licenses I'm developing an app for iOS and since it's not going to be published by my company it looks like I have to get my own developer license.\nI can live with that, but there's a part of the app that I'm stuck on that I need to get a third-party to help me work through. Some of the libraries I use for the project have problems with the simulator, so what I need to know is:\nAm I stuck having to buy two iOS developer licenses (one for the third-party programmer, one for myself)? \nOne possibility would be for me to keep testing this person's code and send them the output, but I can't think of an obvious way to automate that and it just seems suboptimal. Any other suggestions (short of starting my own company)?\n\nA: You can add a member to Your developer program if You enroll as company. You won't have to buy another account.\nHere's the info from Apple (You need to have developer account in order to enter this link).\n\nIf you are enrolled in the iOS Developer Program as a company and hold either the Agent or Admin role, you can invite co-workers to join your development team by visiting the People tab in Member Center.\n\n", "Q: Disable window snapping to top on move to second monitor/display This annoying behavior started happening in 10.8 or 10.9 and I'd like to turn it off and make it never ever happen again.\nWhat happens is that when dragging a window from one display to another, when I let go of the mouse button on the second monitor, the window doesn't stay where I left it upon mouse button release, but instead it snaps to the top of the screen where I did not position it.\nDoes anyone have any idea how to disable this annoying setting?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Very annoying indeed and it's getting worse. The situation I am in is trying to view webpages in different screen widths. As the browser edge gets closer to other windows, Mac now thinks it must \"jump to and hold it there\" interrupting my process of expanding the page through every pixel width.\nThere is no setting to manage this yet, however, holding +alt while you scale or move windows dismisses the feature. The very nice bonus of dismissing the 'feature' with alt is how much video/CPU time it took to implement this nuisance is released back to your use. The dragging and re-positioning now becomes much more responsive and smooth rather than just jumping around the screen. It's now a habit to just hold alt as I resize any window on the screen.\n", "Q: Get back guest user osx 10.10.1 I upgraded to 10.10.1 and now I can only reboot to Safari mode and enable parental controls on guest user is greyed. \n\nDoes anyone know how to get the real guest user account back?\n\nA: If FileVault is enabled the guest user can only use Safari because they can't access the encrypted disk partition the system resides on.\n", "Q: Yosemite auto creates multiple desktops (spaces) on main monitor Since upgrading to Yosemite I've been having issue with OS X creating additional desktops on my main monitor for no apparent reason. I usually have 3 different desktops setup on my main monitor and just one on my second monitor. By the end of the day, OS X will usually have created 2-3 extra desktops automatically.\nI can't find any setting or shortcut that might be causing this to happen. There also doesn't seem to be any reason for it since it can happen as soon as I boot up my computer.\nIs there a way to set a maximum number of desktops so I can prevent this from happening?\nImage from related question - Why does Mac Yosemite open dozens and dozens of empty desktops?\n\n\nA: It has to do with the 'separate space' feature for external displays Apple introduced in OS X 10.10 Yosemite: If the setting \"Displays have separate Spaces\" in System Preferences -> Mission Control is activated (see https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18809?locale=en_US), every time you hook up a display a new space will be created for that display. After you pull the plug, OS X will not delete that created space, hence accumulating lots of spaces over time.\nIf you don't activate the option, you're external display will behave like before 10.10: only one menu bar on the main screen etc.\n\nA: It is not normal behaviour to have multiple (in your case dozens) of extra Spaces being created via Mission Control.\nI looked at System Preferences >> Keyboard >> Shortcuts >> Mission Control, but there is no shortcut for creating a new Space. As such, it wouldn't be that you are inadvertently creating Spaces using a shortcut.\nNow, when you go full-screen with an application (e.g., Safari), then that window will become its own Space. However, when the window is closed, or restored to its original size, it will return to its original Space.\nConsidering your situation, I would submit the issue as a bug that Apple needs to address.\n\nA: It does very much sound like you've made the application \"full screen\". These are given their own desktop space. If you're using a trackpad, use three fingers to scroll up or down (I'm not on my MBP right now) and you'll see them all there. \nIf they're your full screen apps, make them NOT full screen. \n", "Q: I have 2 iPads. Should they both have the same id? I got a new iPad and gave my daughter the old one. She is unable to get on it using the password and ID I gave her. So I changed the password on mine -she still can't use that password- is it different on all devices and I forgot it? \n\nA: No, your Apple ID email/password combination will be the same everywhere - on your iOS devices, computers, and online. You can use it on as many devices as you would like and it will always work just fine - regardless of the device. \nUnrelated to that though, I would consider setting up a new Apple ID for your daughter and then configuring Family Sharing to link the two. Apple IDs are very much designed for one user per Apple ID. \nAside from that, make sure you are entering the Apple ID username/password combination correctly and it will work.\n", "Q: JDK 7 on mac 10.6.2 (32bits) I want to install JDK version 7 on my mac Snow leopard 10.6.2 (32bits).\n How can I do it ? Pleas give me some help ? is it possible or not ?\n\nA: Java 7 and Java 8 is only available in a 64-bit version on OS X, and therefor it can only be installed on a 64-bit Mac.\n\nA: Oracle is only supporting Java 7 on Mac OS X 10.7 and above.\nHowever, there is a possible solution/answer on our sister site here.\nOr visit Adobe help here.\nBut, I am not sure it is possible at all on 32 bit, so consider if your system can support 64 bit.\n\nA: I have tested this solution, and when I install jdk version 7, the installation is failed.

If you don't, the numeric access code will not appear on your iPad or Mac during the setup process.\nAs soon as you enable your email address for iMessage (you only need to do this on your iPhone) the numeric access codes appear as expected. Once you have text message forwarding setup you can disable your email address again in iMessage as it seems to only be necessary for the numeric access code setup step, not the actual text message forwarding itself.\n\n", "Q: MAMP Pro license record I purchased a license for MAMP Pro and copy/pasted the license on the webpage when I ordered it.  But there is no record of the license key on the invoice or on when I login to their support system..  I am retiring this computer and transferring my work to a new computer so I am trying to find my license so I can reinstall MAMP on the new computer.\nI've looked through the ~/Library/Application Support folder and /Applications/MAMP Pro/ but I can not find it in a plist file either.

On prior versions of OS X and Xcode I constantly used the title bar right-click to view the folder hierarchy of the Xcode project: right-click the title bar and open up the containing folder (or an ancestor).\nHowever now that Xcode has no title bar I can't do this anymore. Is there any way to bring back the title bar so I can open the containing folder quickly and easily again?\nI know I can right-click the project icon in the project navigator pane and choose \"Show in Finder\", but this is much less convenient as it requires that pane be visible, and it only opens the direct containing folder, not any ancestor I want (nor can I use it to quickly verify the project is the one I think it is). Thankfully the Finder windows still have a title bar so I can do it then, but it's still at least a couple steps extra for something that used to be a single-click operation.\n\nA: Try command clicking on the blue Project folder, for you it's the Portfolio Manager App bit on the left.\n\nA: You could right click on the top bar and open the folders you want. \n\n", "Q: Why is my simple Automator script broken in latest Yosemite update (used to work)? I had a basic Automator script I was using with a keyboard shortcut to bring up the login screen as a sort of lockscreen.  It was working mostly fine until 10.10.1 (I had to manually launch from 'Services' in a given app before I could use the shortcut from that app for some reason).\nHere is the Automator portion:\n\nHere is the shortcut:\n\nI can 'lock' the screen as usual from Terminal so I know the command is still good.  I can also click the Run button in Automator and it works there.  However, clicking on it from Services does not work, and of course the shortcut does not work.  Both of these worked in 10.10.\nWhy has it stopped working and is there a workaround?\n\nA: I used the exact same settings that you did but used Command+Options+Control+L as the shortcut and it worked. The only things I can imagine is that that the key combination is already in use.\n", "Q: Mastering Categories in Numbers I have a budget with a Column for \"Categories\" and for \"Amount\". Within the Column for categories, as one might expect, is a category for \"Groceries\". Groceries is column \"C\" and Amount is column D.  \nIn a separate column I typed the following formula:\n=SUMIF(Category); \"=Groceries); Amount\nWhere have I gone wrong?\n\nA: What exactly are you trying to accomplish? Are you testing for the presence of the Groceries category label before adding the amount into your calculation? Are Category and Amount named collections/ranges?\nThe format for SUMIF is:\nSUMIF(collection_to_test, \"test condition\", optional_collection_of_values_to_sum)\n\nSo assuming Category and Amount are named ranges, your formula should be:\n=SUMIF(Category, \"=Groceries\", Amount)\n\nIf they are not named ranges, it would look like this:\n=SUMIF(C2:C10, \"=Groceries\", D2:D10)\n\nNaturally, substitute your own particular cell ranges for the first and last parameters.\n", "Q: Reloading a MacBook with applications My daughter has a MacBook, 10.6.8 and we have the install discs. \nIt's gotten to that age, 5-6 years, where it runs sluggishly, and I'm thinking to wipe the drive, maybe replace with an SSD, and reinstall the OS.\nI am looking to be sure that the applications that have been activated by serial number continue to work. Is there a simple process to do this? In the very old Mac days, the serial number / keys were stored in a preference folder. Now, I'm not so sure what pieces need to be saved to move software from an old drive to new. \nI'd go the CCC (clone) route, but a full image would probably take the sluggishness with it. Trying to clean up the next version of the drive. \n\nA: Take a single Time Machine backup, just in case.\nWhen you wipe the laptop, use the Time Machine drive to selectively (manually) restore certain items.  Information and files related to application licensing will most often be located in:\n~/Library/\n~/Library/Application Support\n~/Library/Preferences\n\nA: the sluggishness may come from newer O/S upgrades that have degraded the performance of the computer. I say this because Mac O/S rarely has the \"bitrot\" issues that plague Windows, making it necessary (if not just advisable) to reinstall the O/S every 3-4 years. So if you have kept up with the O/S upgrades that may actually be the culprit.\nThere are also utilities that will clean up temp files, caches and run the maintenance scripts that can slow down the system. I personally like Onyx (MacUpdate.com). Run that, go to the automation tab and run it with the defaults. Reboot when done. Initially things will be a little slower (MS apps need to rebuild their font cache) but after an hour or so of use you should be able to tell if cruft has built up in the corners that was fixed by Onyx.\nFailing that I would go with a replacement drive, an SSD would be best. An SSD will make the system feel a lot faster. And for those folks with some mechanical ability it's a quick and easy do it yourself repair. ifixit.com has instructions and I have used the SSD kits from OWC several times with good effect. they come with an external USB drive case, so you clone your old drive to the new one in the USB case then swap the drives. Pretty simple if a bit time consuming (count on half a day for backup and hardware swap. More if you are less experienced, less if you've done this kind of thing before.)\nAnd depending on how much RAM you currently have, more can help too. I like 8GB for general use, more if it is affordable. Many people swear by 4GB being enough but I have found that for my purposes 8GB is the sweet spot.\n", "Q: Remove eject button from finder I accidentally ejected an external drive in the finder, is there an option to hide or remove/disable eject button from finder? \n\nA: You can use the command below to edit the com.apple.finder preference.\ndefaults write com.apple.finder ProhibitEject true\n\nthat will set it for the current user, to set it system wide use\nsudo defaults write com.apple.finder ProhibitEject true\n\nThe eject button will still show in finder but will not do anything when pressed.\n\nA: The easiest way, and suitable for ANY drive is to right-click the drive and  choose \"remove from sidebar\". That way you can create an alias or navigate to your files from \"{username}'s Mac\" without messing with any other system configuration.\n", "Q: Yosemite -Airdrop not working between 2012 Mac Mini and 2012 MacBook Pro Retina I have a 2012 Mac Mini, and a 2012 MBP Retina both on Yosemite. Airdrop worked very well under Mavericks, and I waited to see if the 10.10.1 update would fix it before posting this. My MBP detects my iPhone 6+, but not my Mac Mini, and my Mac Mini does not detect Anything with Airdrop. My Mac Mini is ethernet, but wireless is on, just not connected. How can I get them to see each other?\n\nA: Old Airdrop and new Airdrop are different apps.\nThis may or may not help you but I found it while trying a mid-2011 and late-2013 iMacs. The docs say anything older than 2009 iMacs and MBP meet the system requirements for Airdrop, however, they don't mention that anything before 2013 is using a different version of Airdrop altogether and it's almost name-only in similarities.\nI don't know how this affects your two 2012 versions, but perhaps this is the case for late-2012 and you can check both computers to see if either are affected by this. You will know if one computer has a message like \"If you would like to share with another Mac, ask them to open Airdrop in the finder.\" This is the old Airdrop version message.\nIf you see two links with selectable options with who to allow discovery of your machine, and another link that says, \"Don't see who you're looking for?\" Then this is the message with the new version of Airdrop.\nIf one of your computers is new version and one is old, you can fix this by clicking the \"Don't see who you're looking for?\" link on the newer version and select \"Connect with older Mac.\"\nNow you should see each other in your finder. If this is not the case, then these instructions will not help you.\n\nA: AFIK the AirDrop is wireless feature, while it could be made to work with Ethernet card.\nTurn on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on all devices.\nIn case you might want to do it manually, Enable the Airdrop\nOpen terminal and paste following:\ndefaults write com.apple.NetworkBrowser BrowseAllInterfaces 1\n\n", "Q: Using a USA charger in Europe I am about to buy an Apple charger on Ebay coming from USA, yet I am not sure if I can use it here in Europe, more precisely in Portugal.\nI'm not concerned with the plug itself since I have the plug from my old broken charger and given that I can easily detach and attach it to the new charger this is not a problem.\nMy concern is related to the different electrical system used in USA and in Europe, so do I need to buy a converter or is it safe to use it ?\nBest regards,\nFilipe Silva.\n\nA: If it’s a genuine Apple charger, you should be fine, those are universal. If it’s not (and it’s not unheard of for counterfeit items to be sold on eBay), all bets are off.\nSee for instance Ken Shiriff’s teardowns of iPhone chargers to see what enormous differences there can be among charger designs and their safety: http://www.righto.com/2012/10/a-dozen-usb-chargers-in-lab-apple-is.html\n\nA: Apple Charges are universal (worldwide)\nEvery charger has a label that has to say something as following:\n110-220 Volt (or 100-240 Volt)\n50- 60Hz.\nThen it is a Universal charger.\nFYI: The USA system is 110 Volt 60 Hz while the European is 220 Volt 50 Hz.\nAnd Apple charger covers both systems. And you do not need a expensive converter or some traveler kit for $50. All you need is $3 US to Portugal plug that you have already.\n\nA: Apple sells a \"World Travel Adapter Kit\" that fits most of the Apple chargers sold in the last five or so years.  The kit also includes a USB charger that fits each of the adapters.\nYou can use any Apple charger that fits this kit, anywhere in the world.\n\nA: There will be no problem, I've been using mine (both the 85W and the 60W) both in Europe and the U.S. just by swapping the plug, never had any issues.\n", "Q: Escaping variable in script I'm using script.sh in an OS X Mavericks terminal containing only the following:\necho ${1}\nls ${1}\n\nNow, when I call ./script.sh \"/Users/me/some\\ directoy\\ with\\ whitespace/\", the echo command prints /Users/me/some\\ directoy\\ with\\ whitespace/, but ls still insists on splitting everything up, so the results there are\nls: /Users/me/some\\: No such file or directory\nls: directoy\\: No such file or directory\nls: with\\: No such file or directory\nls: whitespace/: No such file or directory\n\nNotice the \\ at the end of the first three error lines. How do I do this correctly?\n(I'm aware that using both \"\" and \\ in the input argument leaves the \\ in my variable, but I assume I would need those.)\nI also tried using ./script.sh /Users/me/some\\ directoy\\ with\\ whitespace/ without the quotes, then making the script\necho ${1}\nls \"${1}\"\n\nbut that made the echo output not contain any \\ now, and the ls output looks like this:\nls: \"/Users/me/some\\: No such file or directory\nls: directoy\\: No such file or directory\nls: with\\: No such file or directory\nls: whitespace/\": No such file or directory\n\nNotice that all it did was add the quotes without seeming to understand them as syntax.\n\nIt is somehow related to the IFS (input field separator) since if I make the script\nIFS=*\nls ${1}\n\nand run it as ./script.sh /Users/me/some\\ directoy\\ with\\ whitespace/, it correctly shows me the content of the specified directory. I'm not sure why, though.\n\nA: You don't need the braces. This should work just fine:\necho $1\nls \"$1\"\n\nYou don't want to use backslashes and quotes in the directory name. One or the other should be fine.\n\nA: The correct script is\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"${1}\"\nls \"${1}\"\n\n(You can start with #!/bin/sh instead if you prefer.)\nThe syntax of bash and other shells is a bit weird. You might think that $var means “the value of var”, but it doesn't. It means “take the value of var, split it at each whitespace sequence (or more generally, split it according tot he value of IFS), and interpret each part as a glob pattern which, if it matches any file, is replaced by the list of matches”. Yes, that's quite a mouthful — which is why you should always write \"$foo\" instead. Always put double quotes around variable substitutions unless you know why you need to leave them out. Inside double quotes, the meaning of \"$foo\" is “the value of the variable foo”.\nSee Why does my shell script choke on whitespace or other special characters? for further discussion of this topic.\nTo invoke your script, you can use any form of quoting — but only one:\n./script.sh /Users/me/some\\ directoy\\ with\\ whitespace/\n./script.sh \"/Users/me/some directoy with whitespace/\"\n./script.sh '/Users/me/some directoy with whitespace/'\n\nIf ./script.sh /Users/me/some\\ directoy\\ with\\ whitespace/ doesn't work with the quotes in the script, then you aren't typing that in a bash shell. I can't guess what else you might be typing it in. Or else you didn't test with the version of the script you thought you had.\n", "Q: Unwanted photos on My Photo Stream I'm receiving unwanted photos on my photo stream from another user?  What setting needs adjusting?  It's an iPhone 5 with iOS 8.1.\n\nA: Apple says:\n\nAdd and remove subscribers to a shared photo stream\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Select iCloud in the Source list.\n  \n*Select the shared photo stream whose subscribers you want to change, and click the Info button in the toolbar.\n  \n*In the Subscribers section of the Info pane, do one of the following:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*To invite a new subscriber: Type the invitee’s email address.\n  \n*If the person you’re inviting doesn’t have an iCloud account, select the Public Website checkbox.\n  \n*To remove a subscriber: Select the subscriber’s email address, and press Delete.\nIf you invited a new person to view your shared photo stream, an email and a notification are sent, asking that person to subscribe to your shared photo stream. If you removed an existing subscriber from your shared photo stream, the shared stream is immediately removed from the subscriber’s Apple devices. If you want to reinvite a subscriber to view your shared photo stream, delete the person’s email address from the “Shared with” section, and add the email address again.\n\n", "Q: concatenate text files in multiple folders I have hundreds of folders with a few text files in each folder.  I'm trying to concatenate the files of each folder into a single text file.  One file for each folder.    Ideally, the concatenated files would be saved to another location. \n\nA: You can do with a simple script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ndirectories=\"/your/path/dir1 /your/path/dir2 /your/path/dir3\"\n\nfor d in $directories\ndo\n        cat $(find $d -name \"*.txt\") > $(echo $d | sed 's/\\///g').txt\ndone\n\nThis script will concatenate every txt file on /your/path/dir1 and saves it as yourpathdir1.txt in your actual path.

I've installed Ouimeaux to control a Belkin Wemo on OSX, and it's working correctly in Terminal - meaning that the following command in Terminal will toggle my Wemo switch on/off:\nwemo switch Myswitchname toggle\n\nIt works.  Now, I'd like to assign a hotkey to that with BetterTouchTool.  It seems like it'd be as easy as selecting the option to Execute Terminal Command in BetterTouchTool...  but pressing the hotkey does nothing.  It works in Terminal though.  Do I need to write it differently for BetterTouchTool?\n\nA: I feel silly for not figuring this out myself, but I'll post it here in case anyone else is having a similar issue.\nIn Terminal, I can simply type this command and it works:\nwemo switch Myswitchname toggle\n\nBut with the Execute Terminal Command in BetterTouchTool, it needed to be entered this way in order to work:\n/usr/local/bin/wemo switch Myswitchname toggle\n\n", "Q: unlocking iphone 5s on a different carrier I own an iPhone 5s with iOS 8 (or above) locked to T-mobile carrier (USA), although I do not have the original sim. I am stuck on the setup page since I had reset the iPhone to factory setting and it keeps asking me for the original sim which i do not have. (IMEI checks does show that the iPhone is already activated as it was used on the original sim before) However, i put in a new sim from optus carrier (i am now in australia) and the network shows signal with 4G data, I have attached an image of it. Now my question is, is the iPhone sim locked? Can i just unlock the sim or would i have to unlock the iPhone? \n\nA: afaik if the phone is network locked you'd need to be on the original carrier network to unlock it (then connect on itunes to complete etc) and whatever code is required (if any) must be applied with the original SIM.\n", "Q: Yosemite keeps asking to install Java runtime, while it's installed I was prompted to install JRE version 8 after upgrading to Yosemite on the family 2010 21\" iMac.

Then, after a few seconds, red color starts flickering (in large rectangles and lines), then goes out completely.\nThe screen becomes bluish, and everything that should be red seems black.\nI've attached a photo.\nIt's strange that sometimes it just starts working correctly again after some time, even if I don't touch it.\nThe computer was turned off for 2-3 days, because I've bought another computer and didn't need the old one. Before that, it was working fine and the display had never got any problem.\nI've tried to format the disc and reinstall OS X Yosemite, but it didn't help.\nIs this definitely a hardware problem?\nHave you ever had the same issue?\nDo you have any idea what is causing it?\nMaybe, can I repair it by myself? (I'm not afraid of disassembling the machine if it's not hard to repair. E.g if a connector has just got disconnected or something like that.)\nThanks for any help and relevant information!\nUpdate:\nI've had it turned on for about ~1 hour and now it works again. Is it probably oxidation of the connector?\nUpdate 2:\nI've tried to knock, press, and move the lid in many ways, but couldn't reproduce the problem.\nUpdate 3:\nIt suddenly happened again! Then I started a program which spins up CPU usage to 100%. Then the display started working fine again in less than a minute! Managed to get it working in this way twice.\nIs it probably some kind of oxidation of the connector?\n\n\nA: Let me summarize the troubleshooting steps.\nBefore disassembling:\n1- Run the Apple Hardware test to see if it comes up with anything.\n2- As far I know you have a NVIDIA graphics car. Run without it to test.\n3- Connect a external monitor to test if the internal display is failing.\n4- Open up the computer and unplug/plug the Video cable few times to clean the contacts. Or replace the Cable following the instructions here.\n", "Q: How to add keyboard shortcut to toggle F1, F2, etc. as standard function keys? I saw an AppleScript on Github to automate toggling F1, F2, etc. as standard function keys, but I don't know how to install it to my system and trigger it via a keyboard shortcut.

Here's the script: https://gist.github.com/alampros/2b81af6cfc564f6accd3\n\nA: In order to assign a keyboard shortcut to this script, you could create a service in Automator.\n\nYou must change Service receivesto no input.

I was on the same situation and the problem was solved. The software is in demo mode.\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried BootChamp, it's free but on my Yosemite install, it hangs.\n\n\nI think you just have to find a way to boot on your Windows 8 partition and go to your Windows 8 Bootcamp settings to reset the boot disk to Windows 8. This will update the Master Boot Record to set your Windows 8 as a bootable disk.\nYou could think about using your Windows 8 installation or recovery disk to repair your installation. You could also try to see on OSX if you Windows disk is available in\nSystem Preferences > Startup Disk and define it as the startup disk.\nWhen you succeed booting in Windows 8, you will likely be able to reset the boot disk to your OSX partition and retrieve your dual boot.\n", "Q: iCloud and OS X Server: Limits for Contacts, Calendars, Reminders? iCloud and OS X Server: Limits for Contacts, Calendars, Reminders?\nFor iCloud, there are some limits detailed here: http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202158\nHowever there is no mention of such limits when running your own OS X Server. \nDoes anyone know the limits of OS X Server Calendar (CalDAV) and Contacts (CardDAV), if there are any?\n\nA: The data repository for Calendar service is located at /Library/Server. Inside that directory is a folder containing data specific to the Calendar service at /Library/Server/Calendar and Contacts.  Within that folder is a Config folder that has the main configuration file for the caldav daemon called caldavd-system.plist.\nThe limits are based on your configuration and physical capacity.  Outside of that users can have as big a Calendar and Contacts as they want/you want them to have.  Apples limits are arbitrary for use of their service.\nEDIT There is a difference between limits and compatibilities.\nBONUS If you want to learn how to set up your own limits try here.\n", "Q: Where exactly is QuickTime Player on OS X 10.8.5 Mountain Lion? I bought a used MacBook Pro Retina Mid 2012 with Mountain Lion. I can't seem to find the QuickTime Player anywhere. There is no such app in Apps nor in Utilities. When I right-click a video icon, Open With doesn't offer QuickTime (even if it's a .smil file, which is more QuickTime specific, not to mention any other type). Simply, there is no such thing as QuickTime Player on my system. Is this possible or am I doing something wrong? How can I get it (the current one, not the legacy one)? Apple doesn't offer any download as far as I can see, the page claims I have one. Only, I don't :-(\nAny advice? Thanx...\n\nA: QuickTime Player should be located directly in /Applications/, that's its default location. QuickTime Player X is part of the OS installation, and Apple provides no separate downloads of the app.\nReinstalling the OS is of course a huge step just to get QuickTime back. If you have access to the Mountain Lion installer, you can use an app like Pacifist to extract QuickTime Player from it.\nMountain Lion, as it was a paid upgrade, also cannot simply be downloaded. You may have a copy of the installer on an usb drive or a dvd-r. Originally it was an App Store download, and when bought an app file called \"Install OS X Mountain Lion\" was placed in /Applications/. After the installation this file, which was more than 4 GB in size, was deleted. You can get it back from the Purchases tab in the App Store to re-download the file. If it shows as \"Installed,\" you should try holding down the option key while clicking on the Purchases tab. You might also be able to locate the installer on a Time Machine backup in the /Applications/ folder.\n", "Q: Wont let me backup iPod because not enough storage My iPod has not been backed up in six weeks. And I need 5 GB to back it up.  5 GB is my max storage. I don't want to have to delete everything i got to back it up. What do I do? Please help.\n\nA: Backup your iPod to your computer rather than iCloud. iTunes will do that for you, see the \"Back up using iTunes\" section here\nhttp://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT203977\nThere are also third party tools that may help if iTunes fails.

After connecting HDMI to VGA converter my monitor is not getting any signal. How can I fix it? Please help me. I am so frustrated.\n\nA: The recommended way is to use the Thunderbolt (Mini DisplayPort) to VGA converter.\nhttp://store.apple.com/us/product/MB572Z/B/mini-displayport-to-vga-adapter?mco=MTA4NDU0NjA\nThe Apple HDMI does not supply signal to VGA monitors.\nThe Cable you have is good, but only for Digital monitors and VGA is Analog type. OK if you are sufficiently confused now, just get the Mini DisplayPort to VGA Adapter and it will work.\n\nA: I've gone thru the above growing pains and figured out the mini DisplayPort to VGA conversion adaptor would work for my first monitor on my Mac Mini.  However, I am installing a second monitor (I would highly recommend), and intended on using the HDMI port on my Mac Mini and a VGA to HDMI adaptor cord to connect the new monitor. \nNow I learn the HDMI only works with digital monitors, which now makes sense.  Already bought the monitor, and returns are very expensive, so you'll really need the correct cables and adapters to make this work.\n", "Q: Yosemite window close button off center? I just updated my 13\" MacBook Air (early 2014) to OS X Yosemite. The close button on the semaphore buttons at the top-left of the window has the x in it off center! That's not something I expect from Apple! It looked fine in Mavericks. I don't have this issue with my MacBook Pro at work, since that one has a Retina display. I Googled for it and some people report the same thing, but nobody says anything about fixing it. Has Apple acknowledged this and plans to fix it? I used Linux in the past and I'm seriously considering installing Linux on this machine due to this.\nChanging the colors to graphite centers the x, but I don't like graphite. Please help\n\nA: Your display is made up of pixels which are each made up of 3 subpixels, red, green, and blue. (This is the LCD part in the picture below.) Unfortunately, since red is on the left, it may look a little off center.\n\nHere's a screenshot of the button:\n\nand here's what it looks like on my display:\n\nIt would have been difficult for Apple to avoid this issue while still having the close button red. Graphite fixes this because the button is no longer red, and each of the subpixels is equal, so it doesn't look like it's shifted to the left.\nIn Mavericks, the button was a bit less saturated and a bit subtler, so that may be the reason why it seems to be a problem in Yosemite.\n\nA: If you wear glasses, you may be experiencing chromatic aberration. Nice article about it here: The off-center close button\n", "Q: Is there any way to partition the SSD portion of a Fusion Drive?

I'll be using Windows heavily on it though, and would like to take advantage of the SSD on both operating systems rather than just from within OS X.\nI'm pretty technically savvy, so I wouldn't mind using Windows, Linux or another operating system to accomplish this task.\nThanks!\n\nA: Since FusionDrive is really Corestorage with some added magic (or supposed to), there is no mandatory reason to assign the whole SSD to the Fusion drive.\nWhen creating you DIY Fusion drive, just reserve space by creating adequate partitions and refer to the partition ID (diskXsY) instead of the whole disk.\n\nA: In my opinion it shouldn't be a problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*delete the CoreStorage LVG (FusionDrive) and end with 2 seperate disks: the SSD and the HDD.\n\n*Install Mac OS X on the SSD.\n\n*use the Bootcamp Camp Assistant to install Windows 7/8 on the SSD\n\n*partition the HDD according to your needs (HFS+ & NTFS/HFS+/NTFS)\nYou will end with a partition layout similar to that:\n/dev/disk0 (SSD)\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *100.2 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS MacSystem                49.6 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n   4:                     MS-DOS WinSystem                49.6 GB   disk0s4            \n/dev/disk1 (HDD)\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *3.0 TB     disk1\n   1:                        EFI                       209.7 MB     disk1s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS MacData                 1,5 TB     disk1s2\n   3:                     MS-DOS WinData                 1,5 TB     disk1s3\n\nCaveats:  \n\n\n*\n\n*both systems have to be installed on the size restricted SSD  \n\n*the data partition i/o won't benefit from the SSD\nThere is no way that both systems will benefit from a FusionDrive in the sense of fast I/O and size.\n\nA: Fusion Drive technology is part of the Mac OS itself. Windows cannot use it.\nIt can, of course see the Core Storage Drive & its NTFS partition & boot from it, but it cannot use the hybrid technology underlying 'Fusion' itself.\nBootcamp will make the NTFS partition purely on the HD.\nbtw, Bootcamp is the only way to add the extra partition to a Fusion Drive. Anything else will break it, requiring you to totally rebuild the structure from scratch using Terminal.\nDisk Utility cannot remake or properly readjust a Core Storage Volume.\nDon't touch the partition itself from inside Windows.\n\nA: Yes. Note that the fusion Drive is a HD drive with a small SSD apart (look for replace fusion drive), running in RAID \nWill ned to run the Mac OS in a SD card or flash drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*Discover the IDENTIFIER of each one on terminal type: diskutil list\n\n*Erase (format) each one in my case (disk0 and disk1), I was using a SD card as my HD (I installed the OS in a SD card), you can not make that running the Mac from it's internal fusion drive. In terminal:\ndiskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ HD disk1\n\nand \ndiskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ SSD disk0\n\n\nNow you can use Disk Utility to rename, create partition, etc\n(I figured it out 'damaging' my fusion drive trying to partition it)\n", "Q: 13'' Mid-2012 Pro, can I use FireWire to VGA for a triple screen setup? I have a mid-2012 13'' Macbook Pro. I'm currently using a Thunderbolt to VGA to use a second monitor.\nI'm feeling myself in need for a third monitor for my work. I was wondering if it was possible to use a Firewire to VGA adapter to plug in a third screen?\nI'm worried that my Macbook can only support 2 screens, and even if it could support three, I'm not sure I can do that with the Firewire to VGA adapter.\nI'm looking for advice from seasoned Apple guys.\n(Both external displays would be the same, I don't have the specs here but they're old VGA monitors with relatively low resolution)\n\nA: As far as I know such device simply don't exist.\n", "Q: Game Center, can't sign up IOS 6.1.6 Ipod touch 4th gen I have an Ipod touch 4th Gen on ver 6.1.6, it is not jailbroken.

I love everything about my Macook Air except its very low maximum memory (and yes I bought it with the maximum available at the time).\nSo I'm thinking \"I know how to solder... how hard can it be?\".  It's not that unusual for the theoretic limit at the time a computer is manufactured to be surpassable later when modules with more memory become available.\nIs the claim that the memory can't be upgraded based solely on the assumption that no one knows how to solder?  Or is it massively more difficult to solder new memory into a laptop than it is to solder some simple electronics project?  Are there any big difficulties other than just the need to solder the memory in place (and unsolder the old memory)?\n\nA: Here is video of changing memory chip on iPhone 6 with common hotair solder. It should be similar process and it does not look so impossible..\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bGb5AOwp44\n\nA: iFixit, who is a proponent of replacing everything in your system, does not provide a guide to replace the RAM (only the entire logic board, on which the RAM is soldered). This alone should tell you that it is something that should not be attempted by users who are not professionals.\nOne user did ask in their forums if it was possible. Here's one response:\n\n...to replace/upgrade/or modify those chips, we send them to factory. Precision soldering is required, it is not to be done at home (too fine a work for home, unless you have done this same exact work before and done it well everytime).\nEven after factory re-work, some boards/assembly simply fail (shorted etc). Definitely not worth the risk unless you have direct access to a mother board assembly factory and someone does it for you over there.\n\nAnother user said:\n\nIn any case SMT chips as densely laid out as these are can't be desoldered and new ones desoldered by hand. You need very special gear only available at a fab house.\n\nAnd a third user added:\n\nThey use a special fixture to hold the chips in place and heat both sides at the same time. Your chances is less than 20% getting it to work and heating the board without the proper masks could cause the other components to shift killing your system for sure...\n\nGiven that you can sell your (presumably functioning) existing machine for a fair amount of money, it seems like it would be much more practical to buy a new machine than take a very high chance of destroying your current one, since then it will be worth next to nothing.\n\nA: Yes, it is possible, and REWA Technology has done it and demonstrates how they did it in this video: https://youtu.be/CTsEJ49LLsQ\nAfter taking the laptop apart, you must:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Heat up the sealing adhesive around the two camera chips\n\n*Remove sealing adhesive with tweezers\n\n*Apply some BGA paste flux around the RAM chip\n\n*Blow it with a hot air gun for 30 seconds\n\n*Take off the RAM chips\n\n*Solder the tin to the soldering iron and flat the bonding pads\n\n*Clean with an anti-static wipe\n\n*RAM chips cannot be mixed\n\n*Blow the bonding pad with a hot air gun\n\n*Apply some BGA paste flux to the bonding pad\n\n*Align the RAM chip to the bonding pad\n\n*Blow it with a hot air gun\n\n*Solder the rest of the RAM chips to the bonding pad\n\n*Remove the 10k resistance R2051\n\n*Detach a 100k resistance from a broken motherboard\n\n*Solder the detached 100k resistance to R1636\n\n*Test both ends of the resistance for a short circuit or missing solder\n\n*Put the pieces of the laptop back together\n\n\nA: \nOr is it massively more difficult to solder new memory into a laptop than it is to solder some simple electronics project?\n\nYes, it is; although \"massively more difficult\" is almost an understatement. It's an entirely different process.\nTake a close look at the Macbook Air motherboard. The RAM chips are the four large components in the red box on the left side.\nYou'll notice first that there are no visible solder joints on these parts. This is because these parts are mounted to the motherboard using BGA technology — the solder joints are all on the underside of the chip. They cannot be attached using a soldering iron — they are typically attached using reflow soldering, which requires specialized hardware that you almost certainly do not have access to. Inspection of BGA joints is typically performed by X-ray… which you probably don't have access to either.\nYou'll notice as well that there are no available positions for additional chips. Assuming that Apple uses the same PCB design for the 4GB and 8GB models — which may not be the case! — you would likely have to remove the existing memory chips and replace them with compatible higher-capacity parts. This type of rework is extremely risky; the PCB is not designed to be reheated multiple times to remove and replace parts, and the heat cycles involved may damage the board, especially if inappropriate technique is used.\nAs if that weren't enough, it's not even clear the machine will recognize, or even be able to use, the new memory even if it is attached properly. Standard computer DIMMS contain a small EEPROM (the SPD chip) containing data on the type of the memory present, and the timings necessary to communicate with it. This part is not appear to be present on the Macbook Air; it's likely that the timing information is stored somewhere else in the system. Since this is not a user-serviceable part, there is no documentation available on where this data might be, nor how to update it to represent your new memory.\n\nTL;DR: It's impossible. Not just difficult; seriously, it's impossible. If you need more memory, you'll need to replace the machine.\n\nA: It's most likely because the difficulty (practical impossibility?) of getting RAM that is compatible and would fit inside the case. They don't use SO-DIMMs. \n\nA: It is unfortunate that apple don't offer more memory as an option. But to replace it on your own, even if it is possible, is just stupid. Unless you are planning to start making similar upgrades for profit. But even then it's either to expensive or to risky. You can probably desolder the old chips and solder the new ones with a \"relatively cheap\" hot air desoldering station and home made heat shields. This however requires a lot of practice and luck. Even if you have done this several times you don't succeed every time. And even if you manage to create an ok connection to the chip you can't be sure the logic board accepts the new chip.\nIf you want to pursue this I recommend buying a functioning macbook air logic board. Get four BGA-sockets of the right kind with pogo-pins for testing. And first make sure it works with the bigger modules. But then even if it accepts the larger memory, your success rate soldering is probably 1 in 10 so you'll end up working with one board for more than a day.\nAnd you are probably going to fry a logic board or two.\nIf it was profitable/possible there would be some asian dude selling authentic MacBook Airs with more memory on Aliexpress.\n\nA: RAM: Look in OWC to se if replacement memory for your MBA. If so you will find instructions on how to change it.\nSSD: same as before, for some models they have replacement SSD.\n\nA: It’s completely possible and not even that hard but you will need practice. No idea how they reset the bios to accept the ram though. I’ve desoldered bgas extensively the smaller they are the easier it is.\nThey get hard when they are bigger because if it’s huge you need a lot of heat. And you need to create profiles and have \n\nA: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTsEJ49LLsQ here is a video demonstrating the how to DIY procedure on change the RAM chips.\n", "Q: Mavericks Server: DNS: Increase forwarder timeout The question:\nHow can I increase the timeout for querying the forwarder DNS on OS X Server 3.1.2 ?\nI get DNS errors, which I believe could be solved by increasing the timeout for querying the forwarder DNS server.\nMy environment:\nI'm using Mac OS X 10.9.5 with the OS X Server 3.1.2. I use the DNS service in the OS X Server. A forwarder has been set to my internet gateway (a FritzBox, which is a DSL modem plus tons of other features including a DNS server.)\nEDIT: I set a second forwarder to 8.8.8.8 .\nConsider this collection of things:\n[MacBook Air] <--> [Mac Mini Server] <--> [Fritz!Box] <--> internet\n\nThe symptom:\nI open github.com in the browser, it obviously cannot resolve the host immediately and waits... and waits... and finally shows the error that the host cannot be resolved.\nThe wireshark info:\nOn the MacMiniServer I ran Wireshark and could basically see this flow of packets:\n[MacBookAir]    -> [MacMiniServer] : #1 : Ask for github.com\n[MacMiniServer] -> [Fritz!Box]     : #2 : Ask for github.com\n[MacMiniServer] -> [OtherDNS]      : #3 : Ask for github.com\n[MacMiniServer] <- [Fritz!Box]     : #2 : reply with github.com IP\n...\n\nThe fourth line occurred about 1.5 sec after the second line. So I assume that the DNS server saw the first query time out (#2) and asked another server. After 1.5 sec the FritzBox answered, but the MacMiniServer doesn't care any more and waits for the OtherDNS to answer. This repeats with many other DNS servers, and finally leads to a failed lookup.\nOur connection quality is currently very bad at our place and things get worse, when I am downloading something. This seems to make the DNS roundtrip take longer than 1 sec and trigger lookup failures in many clients (computers, iPhones, etc.).\nEDIT: After I added 8.8.8.8 as another forwarder in the OS X Server DNS, the following behaviour can be seen: The server forwards to the FritzBox. After a certain time, it forwards to 8.8.8.8. Then the responses come in from both FritzBox and 8.8.8.8 . However, the problem persists and from time to time, the system fails with name resolution. The problems mostly occur during times, when I assume that many households in the neighbourhood use IP-based TV.\nHow to fix?\nI'd like to stay with the OS X Server solution and adjust the settings there. If this is not possible, I am willing to set up my own DNS server. (I did it on my FreeBSD server before switching to the Mac Mini Server, so that's an option, but I'd like to keep the \"customization\" of the server as low as possible.)\nEDIT: I am a bit confused, as to why I am having these problems after switching over to a Mac Server (never occurred with the FreeBSD box). However, I could also imagine, that the region with its poor DSL quality is getting no attention by the ISP and things are just getting worse with increasing age of the cables and the switch to Mac is just a coincidence...\n\nA: A DNS server that is configured to use a forwarder behaves as follows:  \n\n\n*\n\n*When the DNS server receives a query, it attempts to resolve this query by using the zones that it hosts and by using its cache.  \n\n*If the query cannot be resolved using local data, the DNS server forwards the query to the DNS server that is designated as a forwarder.  \n\n*If forwarders are unavailable, the DNS server attempts to use its root hints to resolve the query\n\n\nI doubt such timeout setting exists. Any timeout setting would just slow down the query forwarding to the forwarders. Additionally both forwarders (Fritz!Box/OtherDNS) you define in the Mac Server settings would suffer from a timeout.\nSkip the Fritz!Box and add one or two reliable & fast DNS servers (OpenDNS/Google).\nYou may check namebench to get some other fast and reliable forwarders.\nI use the same setup (Server/Fritz!Box) and i get 50 ms from localhost and 77 ms from dnscache.berlin.ccc.de.\n", "Q: Applescript: path to files in application's Resources I'm new to applescript and coding.\nI'm trying to make a little Applescript application that plays an audiofile contained in the .app, using:\ndo shell script \"afplay \" & quoted form of (\"/Users/billy/Desktop/test.app/Contents/Resources/Stuff/audio.m4a\")    \n\nThe problem is; how can I make the app work on an another mac, without having to change the /username/ manually?\n\nA:    set myPath to POSIX path of (path to resource \"audio.m4a\")\n\n    do shell script \"afplay \" & quoted form of myPath\n\nor\nset myPath to POSIX path of (path to resource  \"audio.m4a\" in directory \"Stuff\")\n\ndo shell script \"afplay \" & quoted form of myPath\n\n\n\n\nYou should look at the libraries in the library window of Script Editor.\nIn this case standardAdditions\n\n\nA: Try:\nset pathA to POSIX path of (path to desktop as text) & \"test.app/Contents/Resources/Stuff/audio.m4a\"\n-- or \nset pathB to POSIX path of (path to home folder as text) & \"Desktop/test.app/Contents/Resources/Stuff/audio.m4a\"\n\ndo shell script \"afplay \" & quoted form of pathA\n\n", "Q: Disable Safari Top Sites on Mavericks How can I disable the Top Sites on OS X ver 10.9.5?

I am a freelancer programmer and so far I have only worked on projects on Windows platform. I don't have much idea about OS X hardware. I am not looking for a very high end configuration but integrated development environment and one database server should just run fine. I have a Dell laptop i7 processor, 8 GB RAM, 1 TB HDD; I am fairly satisfied with the performance. I am mainly going to use it for app development and not for any rich graphics app development.\nWhat are the minimum and recommended hardware requirements for Xcode development on OS X?\n\nA: Being a programmer myself, I think screen size and amount of memory are the most important factors to consider. The processors and graphic chips of all current MacBooks will be sufficient for this kind of work, although the MacBook Airs come standard with an Intel i5 processor, which can be upgraded to an i7 for a small price.\nMemory: MacBook Airs come standard with 4 GB, which I think is not enough. They all have the option to upgrade to 8 GB though. The 13\" MacBook Pros come with 8 GB standard, with 16 GB as an option. The 15\" MacBook Pros have 16 GB standard.\nFor screen size, I like to have lots of it to do development work. Unfortunately, Apple stopped selling 17\" laptops some years ago. On the other hand, almost all MacBook Pros now come with a Retina display, which means they have a much higher resolution for the same screen size. If you are comfortable working with smaller font sizes, you can switch to a \"more space\" option in the display settings, which gives you lots of screen real estate. You can choose between 13\" and 15\" MacBook Pros, but the 15\" models are Apple's top of the line, so they might be costlier than what you're looking for. The MacBook Airs don't have Retina displays, and they come in 11\" and 13\" models.\nA last point to look out for is disk size. All MacBooks, except for the 13\" MacBook Pro without Retina display, come with an SSD. But with the cheaper models it's just 128 GB. On all MacBook Air models you have the option to pick up to 512 GB, and up to 1 TB on the MacBook Pros.\nI suggest you go to the online Apple store for your country, and customize a MacBook Air or MacBook Pro to your liking and within your budget. Welcome to the Apple development world!\n\nA: You can use all the laptops from Apple for Xcode development, so choose one that fit in your budget. \nAny used Mac that can run 10.10 will really suffice to get started. From there you can measure things and decide how much $$ to spend to speed up the work you care to.\nAlthough it is not a laptop you should also look at the Mac-mini, the $499 cost is much lower than a laptop. I am using a Mac-mini for xcode development and use a Mac-pro for my daily work. Having a separate development platform lets me always keep it clean of personal accounts and data and apps.\n\nA: Im working with Apple hardware for 4 years now, I started with an i5 MBP which I upgraded with an SSD and 8 GB of RAM. I come from Linux and the times I used Windows is for programming is hard to remember. I was so satisfied with its performance that I got hooked on OSX.\nScreen size is defenitely an issue when working seriously as a programmer. I waited for the MBP with thunderbolt output and along the way ultimately configured my setup with two 27\" ACD's with an MBP i7, 8 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD late 2013.\nMy backup is a MBP i5, 4 GB RAM and 256 SSD early 2014, and i can say for starters the i5 will do but i would not prefer an Air. \nI can only say that performance differences is notable, but for a startup, the MBP i5 surely does the job for less ;)\n", "Q: How do I prevent App Store showing badge on its icon on OS X 10.9 Mavericks?

I’ve picked up my new iPhone 6 yesterday. I’ve set up my Apple ID and connected it to my WLAN normally. Internet works, but when I launch the App Store it just says “Cannot connect…”.\nCould it be due to the unactivated SIM card? The phone is locked to T-Mobile Croatia, but they haven’t yet activated my SIM card. (I expect them to do this throughout today, but there could be delays.)\nThe only other cause I can think of is my preexisting Apple ID. I’ve created it last year when I wanted to access some Apple developer specific videos, but I haven’t had an Apple device until now.\n\nA: Turns out, iCloud Drive (or a related service) messed up my Apple ID in some way. I signed out of my Apple ID, performed a password reset, and signed in using the new password.

Then I searched for extensions that could implement this feature, having no success with that either.\nIs there any way to block specific cookies?\n\nA: SweetP Productions Cookie was created for this purpose. Cookies can be configured individually. One can keep cookies from selected domains and remove the remainder via configurable methods such as browser quit, timer, at login, et al. Removal can be accomplished via a secure standard: US DoD 5220.22-M. \nCookie also can be configured to delete cache, history, favicons, previews, form values, downloads, and more.\n\nA: You can use a connection manager like Little Snitch to block access to domains of your choice.  It's not from within Safari, but it'll work perfectly - even system-wide.  However, Little Snitch and its competitors aren't free, but they do have trials.\n", "Q: iPhone 6: How to interrupt software updates that continue to use mobile data? \nHow to turn off software updates?\n\n\niPhone 6, iOS 8.1.1. Everything seems to be turned off, still software updates is using the greatest amount of cell data. By resetting the stats we still see data being used.\n\nA:     Fischer, there are two different types of software updates that occur on iOS; updates to the apps you have installed and updates to the operating system itself. \n    To disable app updates over your friend’s cellular connection, navigate to Settings → iTunes & App Store and scroll to the very bottom. Tap the toggle next to “Use Cellular Data,” but keep in mind that this will also disable the use of iTunes Match and iTunes Radio over the phone’s cellular connection.\n   If you are concerned about updates to iOS itself being installed over your friend’s cellular connection, don’t be — having contacted a friend of mine who is an Apple Genius, she tells me that your iPhone won’t install updates to your operating system without a connection to WiFi or the user’s specific permission.\n   If your friend continues to have an issue, she may want to contact Apple about a potential bug.\n\nA: Sadly, once the updates start, you don't have a good way to end them other than letting the download complete. You could turn off cellular data entirely or connect to WiFi for the download.\nYou could also erase all content and settings and then restore from a backup - but that's quite a lot of work to kill one download that'a already started.\n\nA: You are going to want to go to settings>Cellular. Then you should see a list of apps with a toggle button next to each one. Scroll down until you find the \"Settings\" icon. You want to turn the switch off. This will deny the settings application (which is what gets software updates) the ability to use cellular data.\nHope this helped\n\nA: Disable Background App Refresh.\nApple now allows apps to automatically update and download content in the background. This feature can harm battery life and cause apps to use cellular data, even while you’re not using them. Disable background app refresh and an app will only use data when you open it, not in the background.\nTo access these options, open the Settings app, tap General, and tap Background App Refresh. Toggle apps to off if you don’t want them to refresh in the background, or disable the background app refresh feature for every app on your phone.\nDisabling push notifications can also save a bit of data, although push notifications are rather tiny.\nReference: http://www.howtogeek.com/212295/how-to%C2%A0reduce-your-iphone%E2%80%99s-cellular-data-usage/ \n\nA: Go to General / usage / Manage storage / scroll down to IOS icon and tap it: you then get an option to delete the download.\n", "Q: How do I reset my MacBook Pro to factory settings without the original install disc? I am selling my MacBook Pro and want to totally factory reset it so none of my things pop up. How do i do this without the disc?\n\nA: 'Factory reset' can be done with Apple's Internet Recovery by holding  Cmd ⌘     R   at the boot chimes.\nCheck your machine is capable of this or whether it requires a firmware update to do it before actually trying it, or you may end up with an unusable machine & then have to get hold of OS Install disks.\nYou may also  want to go to Disk Utility & do a secure erase first, just to lessen the chances of someone trying to recover your old data [unlikely but possible on a simple wipe & install]\n\n\nA: If your Macbook Pro doesn't support Apple's \"Internet Recovery\", because it's older than \"early 2011\", you can go through these steps to remove most of your data from the machine.\nNote: More time, but MUCH less effort is required by simply installing a fresh copy of the Mac's OS X...\n(0)\nBack up your data\nThis should go without saying, but...\n(1)\nDe-authorize this Mac\n\niTunes --> Store --> Deauthorize this computer...\n\nThis makes sure your paid content isn't available on this Mac any more.\n(2)\nDelete all your user accounts\n\nSystem Preferences --> Users & Groups\n\nCreate a new Admin user.

Go back to Users & Groups, and delete all your other users, and choose \"Delete the home folder\" when prompted.  This gets rid of most of your personal data from the machine, but not all.\n(2)\nFrom the Finder, delete all the apps you installed, that you don't want the purchaser of your MacBook Pro to have.  In practice this means everything not published by Apple, and even a few of those.\n(3)\nCleanse caches and \"Application Support\" details\nThis effort requires patience: you must look through your /Library folder, and delete everything that names you, or even hints at you.\n\nFinder --> Go --> Go to Folder... --> enter \"/Library\" (without the quotes)\n\nCheck these folders:\n(note: this is an incomplete list!

Thank you\n\nA: Check out question 5.8 in http://www.finkproject.org/faq/usage-fink.php?phpLang=en#unstable I got the hint from http://sourceforge.net/p/fink/mailman/message/25799171/\n\nQ5.8: There's this package in unstable that I want to install, but the\n  fink command just says 'no package found'. How can I install it?\nA: First make sure you understand what 'unstable' means. Packages in\n  the unstable tree are not in stable for any number of reasons. It\n  could be because there are known issues, validation errors, or just\n  not enough people giving feedback that the package works for them. For\n  that reason, Fink doesn't search the unstable tree by default.\nIf you do enable unstable, please remember to e-mail the maintainer if\n  something works (or even if it doesn't). Feedback from users like you\n  is what we use to determine if something is ready for stable! To find\n  out the maintainer of a package, run fink info packagename.\nFor fink-0.26 and later: If you run fink configure one of the\n  questions will ask whether you want to turn the unstable trees on.\nTo configure Fink to use unstable when you have an earlier version of\n  the fink tool than 0.26, edit /sw/etc/fink.conf, and add unstable/main\n  and unstable/crypto to the Trees: line.\nIf you use Fink Commander, then there is a Preference to use unstable\n  packages.\nNone of these options actually download the unstable tree's package\n  descriptions.You'll need to turn on rsync or cvs updating to do this,\n  which is not set up by default on a new Fink installation. The\n  following command sequence will set you up on a new Fink installation:\n\nfink selfupdate\n\nfollowed by\nfink selfupdate-rsync\n\nor\nfink selfupdate-cvs\n\nand then\nfink index -f\nfink scanpackages\n\n\nNote: There are Fink Commander analogs\n  for everything except fink index -f. You will have to use the command\n  line for that.\nIf you're already set up with rsync or cvs updating, then the\n  following command sequence (or the Fink Commander analogs) will\n  suffice:\nfink selfupdate fink index fink scanpackages   If you're not sure what\n  your update method is, check fink --version in at a command line and\n  see if that mentions cvs or rsync.\nIf you don't want to install any more from unstable than your specific\n  package(s) and its (their) dependencies, (and any base packages that\n  got updated) don't use the update-all command until you turn the\n  unstable tree back off.\n\n", "Q: Time Capsule isn't being found by AirPort Utility I have a MacBook Air (mid 2011) running OS 10.7.5. Last month I bought a new Time Capsule, and I would like to reformat/erase my old Time Capsule (about 5 years old) and give it to a friend. But right now, AirPort Utility cannot even find the old Time Capsule.\nWe wanted to test whether the old Time Capsule would work at all with my friend's ISP and Windows PC. We got them to talk to each other, but then we probably typed in something injudicious (an IP address, I think). Afterwards, we couldn't talk to the old Time Capsule with the PC, and now I can't talk to it with my MacBook either. When I use it directly as my wireless router, AirPort Utility no longer finds it - no Time Capsule icon at all, just a spinning wheel and a message saying it can't find anything but it will keep looking. (I never succeeded at locating the old Time Capsule when my new one was providing the wireless, even before we made things worse).\nSo the primary question is: what can I do to obtain any kind of access to my old Time Capsule - just enough to reformat it and start over? (There's no data on it that I need to care about.) Or can it be reformatted with some magic button press or paper clip insert on its own?\n\nA: The Airport Express, Airport Extreme and Time Capsule units have a reset button located on the back that will restore the unit to factory default settings. See http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT3728 This will allow you to reconfigure the unit.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to switch between Google Chrome profiles in Mac OS X (10.10 Yosemite)?

I would look at using an xargs to pipe the ls to mv. (I'll admit this would take me a minute to cook up, but it's do-able.)\nOnce you have the script working correctly use cron on a one minute schedule (hint * * * * *).  Since most of the time the script will exit after one command this will not use any measurable resources.\nPrevious answer:\nOne option would be to use fswatch to rename screenshot files as they are created.  This option really has the most forward compatibility as well.  \nfswatch as the name implies allows you to WATCH for File System changes within a script, and then pipe the output to some other command.   In this case probably xargs calling mv to change the name the way you want it to read.  \nI would reccomend this type of solution, as it is more update proof that modifying the way OSX names the file.  (i.e. that is let OSX do it's thing, then just have a script that watches and renames immediately).\n\nA: http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/23001/deeper works to change destination and filename where you want your screenshot to be saved as.

When I click on the presentation's window, it whizzes back to the second monitor that's not present.\nHow do I move the presentation window to the primary display that's present?\n\nA: There are a couple of approaches.

There’s an issue with connecting to the App Store, so I’m watching videos on youtube.com in Safari. I’ve noticed that the videos are low-res. I don’t see the setting to turn on HD video sources. (I’m connected to my WLAN.)\nIs it not possible to view HD videos on YouTube in Safari?\n\nA: Workaround: Use the desktop site, here is how:\n\n\n*\n\n*In mobile Safari, find the clip that you want to watch, it will\ninitially start in low resolution.\n\n*Tap the address bar.\n\n*Swipe down in the page and you should see Request Desktop Site,\ntap it. Sometimes this may open the clip in the YouTube app on the first attempt, try again!\n\n*On the second attempt it may ask you to open in YouTube app, don't\nallow!\n\n*On the third attempt you should see the Desktop version of YouTube.\n\n*Tap inside the video to start playing in HD, sometimes you need to tap a second time.\n\n\nNote: on my iPhone 4s iOS 8.1.2 the Desktop version of YouTube is much slower, unresponsive and harder to use. But since YouTube app can't play any videos over AirPlay, I had to find alternatives.\n\nA: Mobile Safari (on iOS) will not play videos in HD on Youtube. You would have to view the videos from within the Youtube app to get higher resolution video.\n\nA: You can go to the 3 dots on the top right of the screen, then press Playback Settings, then press the quality button, and choose a higher video quality.\nThis doesn’t save to every page.\n", "Q: Keyboard backlit light control from command line Is there any command to control the intensity of keyboard light of a MacBook Pro? \n\nA: I haven't found a great solution yet.

It's not search per se, but just opening certain kinds of PDFs that have been cropped using a Java-based tool called \"Briss\" (which converts 2-up scans to 1-up).\nI think that this is a Yosemite bug that hasn't been fixed yet.

I have bought a used iPod which the previous owner had loaded photo albums on. I do not have iTunes and it will not let me delete the photos/photo albums without it.\nHow do I delete the photo albums that are on this device?\n\nA: One approach would be to wipe the iPod (Touch, I assume?). Obviously doing so will erase all of those photos, any music, you have on the device, as well as all of your apps.\nYou do this by going to Settings -> General -> Reset -> Erase All Content and Settings.\nIf it is a new enough device to have iCloud backup, you could always disable photos, before wiping the device, and then restore using the iCloud backup. However, if you have photos on the device that you want saved, this approach will not work.\n", "Q: Assign spotlight short cut to different keys By default in Yosemite Spotlight shortcut is assigned to ⌘SPACE, but change language is also ⌘SPACE so for a multilingual person it turns out to be a tough choice which one to use. I am wondering if there is a way of assigning a different short cut as ⌥SPACE for a spotlight or the language switch?\nI know I can disable language switch and only use 'next language' as ⌥⌘Space, but I am looking for an easy 2 keys solution\n\nA: just go to Preferences -> Keyboard.

I am able to view these files and folders inside apps that support Dropbox on my iPhone.\nI want iCloud Drive to behave in the same way therefore files arranged in custom-made folders that visible from inside any apps that support iCloud Drive on my iPhone. However it appears that to view files in iCloud Drive from an app on my iPhone, the files need to stored inside the folder for that specific iPhone app.\nHow can I set up iCloud Drive like Dropbox?\n\nA: There are apps in the iOS app store that will allow viewing and editing of the files stored in your iCloud Drive account, I use Documents, by Readdle, for this on my iPhone 5s. Documents allows you to manage iCloud Drive files, including downloading and uploading of files. Keep in mind that a desktop Mac includes a file manager, whereas iOS is set up differently and doesn't include the same functionality.\n", "Q: My purchased ringtones are gone from my 5s after updating to 8.1.1?

I often postponed charging my iPhone until it really run out of battery.\nAfter I charge my iPhone, I usually go to sleep or rest or forget about it. Unfortunately, as shown in If we run out of battery and then charge iPhone, will it turn back on?, things tend to go wrong.\nThe iPhone can be fully charged, but not turned on at all. So For 3-4 hours, I would receive no incoming calls.\nIf I want to receive incoming calls, I could go back to my iPhone 3 minutes after charging and explicitly turn it on. However, after that 3 minutes, I usually have other things to do or is sleeping. So I am often forget to do so.\nThis has cost me a lot of money because I often lost important call because of this.\nHow do I change iPhone behavior so that charging the iPhone automatically turn it on? \nI think it's just common sense. We want our iPhone to get turned on all the time and if we do not like it, we can always turn it off. The idea that my iPhone can be charged without me being able to receive any call bothers me a lot.\n\nA: In a word: Yes.  \nTo the best of my knowledge, the mere act of plugging-in the dead iPhone to a recognized charger will cause the phone to initiate the boot sequence once the battery has charged sufficiently to allow for running the phone and charging simultaneously.  \nYou can check this behavior by turning your phone off and then plugging it into a known-good charging system.  You should see the apple appear shortly and the phone will proceed to boot-up.\n", "Q: Will running games like hayday or clash of clans in the background for a very long time consume battery? I noticed that I often open 4 games at once. Hay day, clash of clans, infinity blade, and boom beach.\nI wonder if I should terminate those apps when I no longer use it?\nIf i keep it on will it consume battery>\n\nA: In iOS if an app does not do background processing it does not take up battery. Games should not be doing background processing.\nWhen you get low on memory iOS will send a signal to all apps so that they can reduce their memory usage and some will free memory. If there is still not enough memory for the current app iOS will terminate other apps.\nThus iOS will terminate apps for you - you do not need to terminate them manually and there is no benefit in doing so.\nSo leave the apps alone..\nOf course if an app is badly written and does background things then terminating might be needed but this is unusual and the developer has to do this deliberately so I thin k games should definitely be OK - there are some apps that look at your location which do misbehave but hames don't need this.\n\nA: Your natural instinct on an iPhone is to always open your multi-tasking and to close apps to conserve battery. This actually can poorly affect your battery. Memory in a phone and memory in a computer do not really work the same way.\niOS uses memory to quickly open applications from memory. When you constantly close apps from multi-tasking and reopening them you are putting much more strain on the RAM by constantly removing all the application memory and re-writing it to RAM everytime you open it.\nBest practice for iOS in my case has been to never close an app from multi-tasking unless it crashes or is frozen.\nIf an application is draining a lot of battery then remove the game or submit the issue to the game developers to fix it, but some games are very graphic intense and can cause battery drain issues. No game will run beautifully with maximum graphics and not put at least some strain on the battery.\n", "Q: Does Yosemite still allow \"per-user\" Screen Sharing? According to answers to questions on superuser and serverfault, OS X Lion had the ability to allow multiple users to simultaneously log in from other Macs and get a VNC session with their own desktop on the target machine (not necessarily running OS X Server, from what I can tell).\nFor instance, I could connect to our (as yet un-purchased) Mac Mini from a Cafe with my Air, while my wife connects from the living room with her white MacBook, while one of our kids is actually sitting right in front of the Mini using it without screen sharing.\nThere is no mention of this on Apple's web site, that I can find, but of course they're focused on new features, so that's no surprise.  It seems unlikely that they would remove features, but that's not without precedent.\nSo: can anyone confirm whether or not this feature still exists in OS X Yosemite?  (Or Yosemite Server?--although the answers to the other questions did not mention the feature requiring OS X Server.)\n\nA: Yes, this feature still exists, and operates in the same way.  \nAs an example, here is a connection from one Yosemite machine to another:\n\n", "Q: How to send text message when they also what imessage My brother has a Windows Phone, and an iPad.

However, when I attempt to create a second partition, I am presented with the following:\nPartition failed with the error: This Core Storage operation is not allowed on a sparse logical volume group.\n\nHaving scanned around for similar articles I see that this is a common problem when people have installed Yosemite on a SECONDARY partition.

It worked once the encryption was complete. My encryption resumed as soon as I plugged in my computer.\n\nA: The Mac would only have a single partition devoted to OSX (actually there are also hidden partition). You cannot modify the partition while it is in use by OSX.\nYou should restart in recovery mode, and you can then modify the partitions.\nI have never used Bootcamp, so @Buscar's suggestion may work, but it is easier to use diskutil to make a partition for Linux etc.\n\nA: klanomath's answer is correct (and should probably be made an answer and not a comment) You already have three partitions on your computer: The EFI partition, the Mac recovery Partition and the main Mac filesystem (usually labeled Macintosh HD).\nBoot Camp will resize the Mac partition and create a Windows partition, that part is easy as the Boot Camp app walks you through the whole procedure, all you need is an 8GB (minimum size) USB flash drive (regular USB drive will work too) for the installation media and a Windows install disk ISO file.\nIf after installing Windows with Boot Camp you then boot into the recovery partition and use disk utility to add a partition for Linux, Windows will no longer be bootable as it only supports 4 partitions.\nThere may be a way to do this but I am unaware of it, possibly a Linux forum can help. But if you have plenty of memory I would consider putting both Windows and Linux in a VM using one of the three products available for the Mac: Parallels (commercial), VMware (commercial), Virtualbox (freeware).\n", "Q: Can I transfer a call from the iPhone to Facetime on the mac? Using Yosemite, can I transfer a call from the iPhone to Facetime on the mac?  I know it is possible to go from FaceTime on the mac to the iPhone.  I want to go the other direction.\n\nA: This is currently not possible (iOS 8, OS X 10.10.3).\nA similar question has been asked on the Apple Communities forum, and the consensus there was that it's not possible: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6649250\nIt's possible that Apple will add this functionality in a later version of their software/OS.\n", "Q: IOS 5.1.1 Safemode problem I jailbroke my old iPod Touch 3rd Generation, with IOS 5.1.1, using the latest version of absynthe. It worked for several months, but then it randomly stopped. It went into safe mode, but the touch screen wouldn't work. It showed the lockscreen, but nothing worked at all, except for the physical buttons. The only way to reboot is to follow the same steps as DFU mode (Hold power button 3 sec, then home button AND power for 10, then just home for 8)... However, it always boots right back into Safe mode.\nI had to restore, and once rejailbroken, it worked fine, until I installed SBsettings. Then it did the EXACT same thing, and I had to restore and re-jailbreak AGAIN! The other day, I finished installing ALL of my extensive list of tweaks, and got it to about where I wanted it, when lo and behold, it booted to safe mode again. I have spent so much time on this, and I do not want to do it again. Does anybody here have any knowledge on the topic? Is there a program I can run from my computer to manually control the device or kick it out of safe mode? Is there some other method of doing this? I am looking for any solution OTHER than restoring. I have done that several times.\nAlso, I know the problem isn't with my jailbreak. It worked for several months before, then one day stopped. Now, it has the problem within a day of rejailbreaking, OR instantly if I install SBsettings. I re-installed the jailbreak, and applied the new one as well, and that didn't work. I have given up, and don't want to go through the painful process of restoring, rejailbreaking, and re-installing all of those tweaks again.\nAlso, because I can't get into my iPod, I can't provide a list of tweaks. I would if I could, but it just can't happen unless I can get in there.\n\nA: SafeMode v0.9.5000 is not working well on iOS 5.11\nYou should downgrade to v0.9.4000\nSee http://www.jailbreakqa.com/questions/304545/screen-is-unresponsive-to-touch-in-substrate-safemode-ios-421\n\nA: you may be installing an bad app or repository that has updated since you had it running stably.\nthere are lots of variables, try installing one app a day and determine which app (besides sbsettings) is giving you problems.\n\nA: I had a similar issue on my iPad 1st Generation running iOS 5.1.1.\nThe solution that worked for me is deleting the com.saurik.WinterBoard.plist in private/var/mobile/Library/Preferences.\nHowever, since you say that the issue seems to be with SB setting, you should delete com.iptm.bigboss.sbsettings.plist. Also, deleting the com.Apple.springbord.plist seems to help too.\nIf you have the computer application for Windows, 3uTools, you should be able to access it under the “Files” tab.\n\nA: Reboot and after Apple logo appears hold volume up until it turns on\n\nA: Did you have your WEI QUAN SI FANG IOS ALL Provisioning profile expire Nov. 20 or something because mine did. Also, it may be the jailbreak you are using, try using another jailbreak. I am also  using absynthe so I will have to try something else.\n", "Q: Fixing iMessage/Message to not use email address (OSX and iOS) How do I fix my little Apple ecosystem, iPhone (8.1) and Mac (Yosemite), to not associate any email addresses with my identity?\nBackground: Years ago (may well have been before Mavericks), you could set up Message (on your iPhone), and iMessage (Mac OSX), such that any message sent to you from other Apple users would appear on all your devices, as well as any messages you would send out as well. This was awesome for me, as you could converse on a thread with iMessage on the Mac, and then leave your Mac, having just your iPhone, and continue to follow the conversation.\nWith the arrival of some minor releases, however, my email addresses started creeping into my settings, my icloud address (which I never use), and the email address associated with my Apple Id. Never understood why. And then, this \"mirroring feature\" of messages feature started behaving weirdly.  That is, some of messages that I would send out would appear at the recipient's iPhone as they always have with just SMS, except for the blue bubble, of course, and then some of the messages would appear as being from my email address. With the latter, that means they would appear as being from a different user than normal (identified as just my email address), so that your recipient would have difficulty following a conversation, and you would have difficulty following responses on just your iPhone, depending on which of the two entities representing you (phone or email) your recipient responds to.\nThis \"less than perfect\" situation continues today with Yosemite, in spite of the feature being modernized with a new name (Relay something) and publicized as a new feature.\n\nA: Your email address, which is your Apple ID, is what ties everything together. That has not changed since iMessage was introduced.\nYou can change where the message is coming \"from\" by going (on iPhone) to Settings > Messages > Send & Receive > and at the bottom under \"Start new conversations from\", adjust the checkbox to change what shows up as the \"from\" to your recipients. Most people would use their phone number here.\nYou should ensure the same setting is selected on your Mac. Go to Messages menu > Preferences > Accounts > select the account which says \"iMessage\" in small type below your email address on the left side, then on the right side, click the Settings tab and at the bottom, adjust the \"Start new conversations from\" setting.\nThe new feature you are referring to is SMS Forwarding, and is mostly unrelated to the above. It allows you to set your phone to forward messages, received on the phone as SMS, to your Mac as if they were iMessages. Replies made on your Mac are sent back to the original sender as SMS, again through your phone.\n\nA: I finally solved this issue. Somewhere along the way either an update on my iPhone or iMac caused any iMessages being sent from my iMac to be from my email address instead of my phone number.\nI went onto my iPhone and went to Settings > Messages.\nMy phone number was there and checked, but none of my Apple ID's/emails were listed. So I pressed the button at the top, it said something like \"Use your Apple ID\", and then it added my Apple ID's/emails as well.\nI then restarted Messages on my iMac and it asked if I wanted to use my phone number. I then went into settings for Messages on my iMac and clicked the dropdown for \"Start new conversations from:\" and my phone number was now available.\n\nA: On my iPhone I just unchecked the email address and then turned iMessage off then back on and it picked up my cell number versus the dang email address    \n", "Q: Open iTerm and execute some commands automatically I need to open some terminal sessions via iTerm 2 and execute commands on each terminal (e.g. rails s ; rails c)\nHow to do it via automator or alfred?\n\nA: You could do it with an Alfred Worflow (you need the Powerpack).\nFirst create a Blank Workflow and fill the data:\n\nUse the plus symbol in the right cornet to add Trigger → Hotkey action.

The system is only allowing my to reset my password or find my apple id \n\nA: In order to turn off Find My iPad you have to have the password to your old AppleID. If you don't you may have to call Apple Support (or go by an Apple Store?) and have them reset the password to that account.\nI believe that if you even try and just wipe the iPad it will require that password. No two ways about it you need that password.\nYes it is annoying but if anyone could simply turn off find my iphone/ipad that would negate it as a setting to help you find stolen devices.\n", "Q: iPod touch resetting My ex husband bought our daughter an iPod touch and put everything under his email account so when she try's to text and stuff it goes to him. Is there a way to reset just the email to hers so she can talk with her friends in private. I would reset the whole thing but she has already bought a lot of music and we don't have iTunes or Internet on home computer. \n\nA: Easy enough...\ngo into Settings -> iCloud and sign out of his account there. You may also have to do the same in the Message -> iMessage settings.\nOnce that is done you can use her email for the icloud and iMessage account.\nIf you do that and are still getting his messages use the Apple Support page for de-registering your account on that phone:\nhttps://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage\n", "Q: my iPhone keeps losing wifi connection. Why is this? My laptop connects to my Wifi but my iPhone does not. I connect my macbook air from the basement to the wifi and i get all 3 bars, but then i connect my iPhone from same place in the basement, the iPhone keeps losing the wifi.i had an iphone 4 before so I thought it was just the Antennas of the iPhone 4 that was weak. Now I have the iPhone 6 plus and its the same issue. what do you think is the problem? is it my router? i have a netgear WNR1000v2 and it is upstairs, about 50-60 ft away from my room in the basement. \n\nA: Download a wifi analyser onto your phone (plenty of good free ones) and check the signal strength your getting on it when scanning for WAP's.\nThis should help you rule out if its the signal strength, leaving either your netgear or iPhone as the culprit.\nSee this article as well\nhttp://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/ios-8-problems/2/\n", "Q: Is it possible that Lost mode for my phone was deactivated by a thief? Why my iPhone cannot detect the location? I enable the lost mode and its confirmed by email but the device did not show any location. But when I first set my lost mode they asked me a pass code, but now if I turn on my lost mode the phone never ask me a pass code. It only appears on the screen that it is done. What is the problem with that? It's possible that my lost mode and Apple ID are hacked by the thief or they deactivated it.\n\nA: They could just have to phone turned off. Although if your phone is logged into itunes, it's POSSIBLE (with forensic software or more knowledge than most iphone thieves) to get your itunes user and password and then of course they could turn it off. However, I think it is an easy thing to determine if someone else is logging in with your credentials, so I'd be willing to bet that they just have the phone turned off.\n", "Q: Script Editor.app: newlines are formatted as CR rather than LF I often use the builtin Script Editor.app to write, compile, and debug AppleScripts before I copy/paste the polished code into a shell script (with #!/usr/bin/osascript).

As a result I always have to tr '\\r' '\\n' before pasting into scripts, or they won't work (and won't even cat nicely).\n\n\n*\n\n*I just want to know if others can confirm this issue? (I'm running OS X 10.10.1 now with Script Editor 2.7, but IIRC the same behavior was with 10.9 and earlier.) \n\n*Also, any guesses on why this is happening?

It seems that choosing the Mac Built-in Mic option causes only my voice to be in the video while choosing the iPad Mic option cause only the sounds from the iPad to be in the video.

Front facing FaceTime HD camera cannot take video at 240fps. Only the rear iSight camera on the iPhone can do that. You won't find any information about this is because it's understood if that were available the company would have it very well advertised.\n\nA: As presented on Apple's website, the 240 fps slow-mo is a feature of the iSight camera (i.e. the back camera).

This doesn't happen when I have the laptop on my lap. Its consistently reproducible. It's somewhat annoying as sometimes when I adjust the laptop on the sleeve the screen goes black. Does anybody know why this happens?\nIs some static being created when the laptop is moved when on the sleeve that causes the laptop screen to go black and back to the lock screen?\n\nA: It's because the sleeve has a \"Magnetic snap closure with no zippers\" which actually mimics the magnetic latch that's triggered while the lid of the MacBook is closed which turns off the screen. \nI've noticed this happen to me a few times in different situations when I would put my iPhone on the hand rest part of the MacBook or If i left my Adonit Jot Pro(which has a magnet to attach itself to the iPad) stylus very close to my MacBook.\n\nYou can try to reproduce the effect by taking a magnet over the marked location (at least on my non-retina MacBook Pro it happens over there, not sure if the position has been changed on Retina MBP)\nEDIT - I now have a MacBook Retina, I haven't noticed this effect anymore.

Is there any way of adding a new notification sound?\n\nA: Yosemite Instructions:\nConvert the sound you want to use to .caf using afconvert:\nafconvert -f caff -d LEI16@22050 input_file output.caf\nGo to \n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ToneLibrary.framework/Versions/A/Resources/AlertTones/Modern\nSince I wasn't sure just adding the new .caf file to this folder would work, I made a copy (backup) of sms_alert_note.caf and then replaced sms_alert_note.caf with the new file. Since it doesn't work at first (I think you have to somehow reload the framework), I restarted. After restarting the default \"Note\" sound was replaced by my own sound.\nEDIT: El Capitan (dirty) solution (without disabling SIP)\nFirst: prepare the .caf file as instructed above using afconvert.\nReboot your Mac into recovery mode (hold cmd+R while booting). Open the Terminal from the utilities menu and type diskutil list to get a list of the connected disks. Make a note of the name of the disk containing the boot volume\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD           1.0 TB     disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             784.2 MB   disk0s3`\n\n/dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD          +1.0 TB     disk1\n                                 Logical Volume on disk0s2\n                                 8D6D5ACA-6AFF-4F53-9E61-2D83A2536501\n                                 Unencrypted\n\nIn this case the boot disk is disk0 containing the boot volume \"Macintosh HD.

You will now be able to use your custom sound by selecting the name of the notification you replaced in the AlertTones/Modern folder in Messages -> Preferences -> Message Received Sound. If you replaced sms_alert_note.caf this will be \"Note (Default)\".\nI don't expect this to hold through system updates, but it might if the AlertTones folder is not modified.\n\nA: An easier way in Yosemite: open mail>preferences>General(it's the first tab)>new message sound>add/remove custom sound.\n", "Q: Launchpad occasionally stalls for few minutes This is happening occasionally and I can't nail the source.

I even got it while using Pages. Now supposedly one cannot get viruses on Macs (really?).How can I solve this issue without having to install any programs?\n\nA: Did you update OS X recently?\nI've had this happen a few times -- what's happening is that some applications you installed require a java runtime environment, but the one you previously had installed is not compatible with the new version of OS X.\nWhen these pop-ups appear, they don't necessarily have to be related to your foreground application (like Pages). Chances are, one of these programs was set to run in the background, like an auto-updater, but now when it's trying to launch, there is no longer a Java Runtime Environment for it to use, so your system is prompting you to install one.\nSo, to prevent this pop-up from appearing, you can either install a JRE, or figure out what software you have installed requires it, and disable or uninstall that software.\nThere are a few places 3rd-party background applications can be triggered from in Mac OS X:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your Login Items (System Preferences -> Users & Groups -> Login Items)\n\n*User Launchd agents (~/Library/LaunchAgents/)\n\n*Launchd agents (/Library/LaunchAgents/)\n\n*Launchd daemons (/Library/LaunchDaemons/)\n\n*StartupItems (/Library/StartupItems/)\n\n\nExamine the files in those locations and see if any of them require Java.

I just decided to remove that plist file to resolve the issue, but it would have been more elegant for me to have found and run an uninstaller for the facebook video chat plugin. Depending on what launchd job or startup item is causing your issue, you may want to be more careful.\n\nA: The easiest solution is to update with \"Java for OS X 2014-001\" at the below link.

I moved all of our media (music & photos) to the NAS, so that both users could use the data with the according apps.\nI thought, that it would be easy to mount the network shares for both users, but actually it isn't - or i'm doing something wrong.\nI'm using a simple Applescript in the following form\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    activate\n    mount volume \"smb://ipaddress/sharename/\"\nend tell\n\nthat is started automatically when my user logs into the system.\nThat works fine for me. But when my partner switches to her user account, the mounts aren't accessible for her. Moreover, when she starts the same script as i do, the paths are getting messed up:\nIf two users mount the network shares, two different folders exist on the system: /Volumes/music for the first user and /Volumes/music-1 for the second user, which messes up all file paths (especially in iTunes, but also in Lightroom or other apps).\nIs there ANY way to mount a network share for both users? I really don't care if i use AFP or SMB, i just want a network share which is usable for multiple users. Seems like a common scenario for me.\n\nA: *\n\n*Setup your NAS to export a NFS-share. Refer to the Synology knowledgebase how to do this or use the following how-to to set it up, fine tune and secure your set-up.\nYou may do it manually in the command line also:\nLet's assume your media folder is /Shares/Media. Create or edit a file named exports in /etc. The example below restricts the access to computers with an IP address in the range 192.168.0.1 - 192.168.0.254.

In Yosemite, I find that occasionally one or both of those settings will revert to the defaults; the \"Source\" menu will revert to \"National Geographic\", the \"Shuffle slide order\" box will be unchecked, or both.\nIs there any reason these settings should be changing without my intervention? Is there any way I can monitor the settings (such as in a system log somewhere) to find out more about when this happens and why? Is there a default write command I can execute to make my desired settings the default?\n\nA: (Answering my own question)\nThis problem never went away for me, but I do have a workaround. I found the preferences that kept changing were in com.apple.ScreenSaverPhotoChooser. I set everything the way I wanted it in System Preferences, then read all the values from that preference file with\ndefaults -currentHost read com.apple.ScreenSaverPhotoChooser\n\nI then copied all those values into a script that would write them back to the same preference file whenever it spontaneously changed its values.\n#!/bin/bash\ndefaults -currentHost write com.apple.ScreenSaverPhotoChooser CustomFolderDict -dict identifier \\\"/Users/me/Pictures/MyFolder\\\" name MyFolder\ndefaults -currentHost write com.apple.ScreenSaverPhotoChooser SelectedFolderPath \\\"/Users/me/Pictures/MyFolder\\\"\ndefaults -currentHost write com.apple.ScreenSaverPhotoChooser SelectedSource -int 4\ndefaults -currentHost write com.apple.ScreenSaverPhotoChooser ShufflesPhotos -bool true\n\n(I may be able to combine all those lines into one line; I am not sure about that and haven't tried it.)\nI saved the script as ~/bin/screen-saver-prefs and made it executable. Whenever I happen to notice that my screen saver is not doing what I want, I just open up a terminal and run screen-saver-prefs at the prompt. ~/bin is on my PATH, so I don't need to reference the directory. If you don't want to do that, just use the full path to the script to run it.\nIt's not the most elegant or efficient solution, but it works.\n\nA: Is your machine a member of an Active Directory domain with a group policy set to have the screensaver work in a certain way?\nWhere I work they have policies for such things, as well as proxy settings that break Yosemite. It may be (if you are similarly tied to Active Directory) that you could have something similar going on.\n\nA: I upgraded to 10.10.2 and I thought the problem had been fixed but it hasn't. This is what I have found out which sheds some light but I don't know how to fix it.\nIn the ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost Folder there is the screen saver files. The one in question I see is this one:\ncom.apple.ScreenSaverPhotoChooser.3894DB94-8127-583F-A292-E5634E257DF3.plist\nAfter setting my screensaver information properly. the XML file contains this:\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n  <key>LastViewedPhotoPath</key>\n  <string></string>\n  <key>SelectedMediaGroup</key>\n  <string>2CE52ED9-1E40-4569-816A-1B5A446FC00F</string>\n  <key>SelectedSource</key>\n  <integer>1</integer>\n  <key>ShufflesPhotos</key>\n  <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\nAfter the screensaver is run, it looks like this:\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n  <key>LastViewedPhotoPath</key>\n  <string>/path/to/last/image/(my proper image that it was viewing)</string>\n  <key>SelectedSource</key>\n  <integer>1</integer>\n  <key>ShufflesPhotos</key>\n  <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\nAfter running it again, it turned to this.\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n  <key>LastViewedPhotoPath</key>\n  <string>/Library/Screen Savers/Default Collections/1-National Geographic/NatGeo03.jpg</string>\n  <key>SelectedFolderPath</key>\n  <string>/Library/Screen Savers/Default Collections/1-National Geographic</string>\n  <key>SelectedSource</key>\n  <integer>3</integer>\n  <key>ShufflesPhotos</key>\n  <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\nUnfortunately, even if I copy the original plist back into the folder, the settings don't revert.  But Obviously, I'm seeing the \"SelectedMediaGroup\" is missing after the screensaver runs once. and then it doesn't know what to do so it reverts to National Geographic as the default.\n\nA: How often does it revert, once an hour?  Once a week?  Could there be a corrupt photo, or non-photo file in the folder?  Maybe try and simplify the folder with just a couple photos, see if it still reverts, and slowly add a few more pics over the course of a few days and see if it continues.  \nYou could also try and move the com.apple.screensaver.plist file, located in ~/Library/Preferences/, to the desktop, reboot, and reapply your desired screensaver settings.

However, I have an issue with the default way the Menu bar works in full-screen. \nI often move my cursor to the top of the screen to click on my tabs in my browsers and editors, and accidentally trigger the Menu bar obscuring my tabs.

This doesn't solve my issue because it strips away many of the advantages of fullscreening.\n\nA: I use BetterTouchTool in two ways. \nFirst, I defined an action that right clicking the maximize button will maximise windows rather than trigger fullscreen mode. Of course, you can set your own action or key combination instead or even override the green button entirely. \n\nSecond, I use Window Snapping, which basically imitates the functionality in Microsoft Windows.

It's not necessary to flush the cache or reset discoveryd (the DNS resolver in Yosemite); sudo fs_usage | grep private/etc/hosts shows discoveryd reading the file immediately after I save changes to it.\n[Update: discoveryd was only used in OS X versions 10.10.0 - 10.10.3. In both earlier and later versions, mDNSResponder provides the same function... and also immediately notices changes in /etc/hosts.]\nHowever, dig, nslookup, and host will not see entries in it because they bypass the system's resolver and do raw DNS lookups. They've always done this, so this is not new in Yosemite. The \"official\" way to do a lookup through the system resolver in OS X is to use dscacheutil:\ndscacheutil -q host -a name www.example.com\n\n...but since that's painfully verbose, I tend to just use ping instead (and then look at the first line, where it lists what IP it's pinging). Starting in 10.9, you can also use Network Utility's Lookup tab (before that it used dig, and therefore bypassed the system lookup policy).\nBTW, please pay no attention to the macrumors thread that Tetsujin linked; it's full of people who don't quite know what they're doing and are misunderstanding the results of their own mistakes.\n\nA: I have discovered another wrinkle with this issue.\nIn order to fix the problem I was having, I had to ADD IPv6 style hosts file entries.\nIt seems that Safari will overlook IPv4 entries IF you have an IPv6 network configuration setup.\nYou must add duplicate entries that resolve to IPv6 localhost address in /etc/hosts.\nIPv4 entry\n127.68.56.101 facebook.com\ne.g. IPv6 entry\nfe80::1%lo0     facebook.com\netc.\n\nA: My hosts file kept on being ignored after I edited in text edit. I tried several ways to fix the line endings, added IPv6 entries to the existing IPv4 entries with no success following JB Smiths answer above. I suspect his answer would work if my company supports IPv6 which I found out after my attempts. \nThe only solution that worked for me is using this free GUI plugin to edit hosts file.\nhttps://github.com/specialunderwear/Hosts.prefpane/blob/master/README.mdown\n\nA: I found this article because Yosemite 10.10.5 was not picking up my hosts file changes, and nothing I could do was fixing it. (I rebooted, tried flushing caches, followed every bit of advice I could find on the internet etc etc).\nThe answer was so simple it is embarrassing, actually, but I thought I'd share. I used textedit to edit the hosts file, and it took the liberty of saving the file as hosts.txt. Normally I would notice something like this, but I am using a fresh install of Yosemite and hadn't yet turned on \"show all file extensions\" so it didn't look like the file name had changed when I viewed it on my desktop.\nSo it's kinda obvious, and most people reading this post have probably already done this, but be sure to check that your hosts file is actually there and hasn't been replaced by hosts.txt.\nTo turn on displaying filename extensions go to Finder > Preferences > Show all filename extensions \nTo stop TextEdit from adding .txt extension to files, open a file in Text edit and choose File > Save As (If you don't see the Save As menu item, hold down the option key after you click File, and Save As should appear in the menu).  Look for the option If no extension is provided, use \".txt\" and deselect it.\n\nA: I believe Apple will recognize this as a bug (I submitted one today). I did notice that new entries in /etc/hosts are picked up but, changes to existing entries are ignored.

After examination I found my second thunderbolt port damaged. A small metal plate/contact on the top of the port had been dislocated, bent out of shape and was preventing the monitor from plugging.\nI brought it back in shape (see pic) but it still dangles and makes plugging the monitor difficult. I managed to plug-in once and confirmed that the port was working.\n\nI have a few questions on this.\nFirst the technical:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does anyone know what is the functionality of the dislocated piece? I googled for the specifics of the connector, but couldn't find any documentation.\n\n\nAnd a couple of warranty related:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have an AppleCare Protection plan. Shouldn't this be covered by AppleCare?\n\n\nI didn't misuse the port in any way and the machine was only 10 months old when this happened. Still the genius bar folks were less than friendly and claimed misuse based on minor scratches on the chasis. They even implied that my regular schedule of plugging/unplugging 2 times a day was somehow \"heavy\" use.\n\n\n*\n\n*Are there any other avenues to pursue a repair from Apple? (I live in the EU.)\n\n\nThanks!\n\nA: I had this problem fixed by Apple. Phone support claimed they could only help me with software problems. I didn't try to get through to the Customer Relations. Instead I tried visiting another Apple Store, where they were happy to fix the problem within warranty. This is a costly repair to pay yourself, as the whole \"logic board\" has to be replaced.\nRegarding my specific questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*\nDoes anyone know what is the functionality of the dislocated piece? I googled for the specifics of the connector, but couldn't find any documentation.\n\nIn my best understanding, the dislocated piece is only used to hold the connector in place. The only other use I can think of is for grounding. However, thunderbolt connectors already have a ground pin. So if you are out of warranty, before shelling around $600 for a repair, you may want to try cutting the metal pin and see how it works for you.\n\n*\nI have an AppleCare Protection plan. Shouldn't this be covered by AppleCare?\n\nWell, it depends on whom you ask. In the first Apple Store, the Genius was adamant that the problem was caused by misuse so it was not covered. In the second Apple Store the Genius directly recognized it as an assembly fault and fixed it for free. So, don't be discouraged by a first rejection of your claim. Try again, different time, different place (if possible).\n\n*\nAre there any other avenues to pursue a repair from Apple? \n\nIf you don't manage to get a repair from an Apple Store, trying to get through to Customer Relations as suggested in the comments above may be an option. Another option would be to try having the problem fixed by an Apple Authorized Service Provider, who may have a less judgmental attitude.\n", "Q: Pulled too hard when opening iPhone.

Better take it to an Apple Store or any cellphone repair shop. Otherwise, use iFix guideline. \nhttps://www.ifixit.com/Device/iPhone_5s\n\nA: Some faults on iPhones can be solved by manually disconnecting the battery. In order to do this you'll need to remove the LCD screen (which may void your warranty where applicable). If your device is out of warranty and more importantly you have the right tools then there is no harm. First check a video guide (i suggest Jerry Rig on Youtube).\nThis way you familiarise yourself with the process first. \n\n\n*\n\n*The bottom two screws need to be removed with a pentalobe screw driver. \n\n*Once they're out use either a suction cup or a plastic pry tool to lift up the lcd screen. The battery connector is underneath a small metal shield with 3 Phillips screws. \n\n*Once they have also been removed, use your pry tool to remove the battery connector flex cable from the board connector. This will completely (soft) reset the device. After a few seconds reattach the battery connector and power on the iPhone. \n\n\nHopefully your device will power up as normal..... othwerise there may be faults which  need further investigation.\n", "Q: Mac Yosemite Airdrop is very slow I'm transferring files over Airdrop between 2 Macs running Yosemite. Before (10.8) it was pretty fast, reaching around 30M/second. Now (Yosemite 10.10) it's around 300k/second. Is this drop in speed because of the Yosemite upgrade or is something wrong with my Mac (it's a mid-2012)?\n\nA: I've noticed the same thing when I connect to a hotspot after upgrading to Yosemite, and to a lesser extent any wifi network. It seems to be an issue of new software issues and the wifi max speed.\nWorkaround\nOption-clicking on the wifi icon and selecting Disconnect from <Network name> will disconnect you from your current wifi network, which has tripled or quadrupled speed for me when starting a new transfer. This works best when both computers are disconnected. It kind of sucks, but when you're transferring files in the hundreds of megabytes as I was, it's worth it.\n\nA: Initial versions of Yosemite used some new Wifi code that resulted in some serious issues for some users. If you are suing Wifi for Airdrop (which is likely), these Yosemite-induced wifi issues could have caused the slow Airdrop speeds you experienced. Later version of Yosemite (10.10.3 and later, I believe), fixed the Wifi issue (for most users). And El Capitan maintained that fix.

If they are not then they go to a standard proxy port.\n", "Q: Apple TV doesn't play some youtube movies I put this Samsara movie into my youtube favourites.\nThere are two unexpected issues here.  \n\n\n*\n\n*If I try to play that movie either from iPad or iPhone and display it to my Apple TV my Apple TV said that it can't play this movie.  \n\n*The other strange issue is that the above movie isn't shown amongst the favorites on my Apple TV. However the youtube web interface clearly shows that it is my favorite.\n\n\nThis version of Baraka which is not Full HD can be played, but still doesn't show amongst my favourites despite the fact that it is there on the web UI:\nAny explanation?\n\nA: The reason your favourites do not appear in the listing on the Apple TV is that the owner of the video has not allowed it to be viewed on a mobile device (which the youtube considers the apple TV to be). The Apple TV recognises this and removes it from the list so you do not try and play an unplayable video.\nThe owner of the video (or more probably the copyright owner of the soundtrack) can decide whether to allow mobile devices and Apple TV's to display videos.\n\nA: First some insides.\nIt comes in different resolution/Sizes.\n166 Mb, 259 MB, 588 Mb and 1.05 Gig (1080p Full HD)\nIf the Add to Play list or Streaming to Apple TV is not working!\n\nIn situation like that I use the Ant-Player add on in Firefox and download the movie.\nBut, just to say, I can add it to my play list and stream! You should try to let it play for few minutes first since it is very slow to start and then try to stream to your Apple TV.\n", "Q: iPod Touch 1st generation upgradeability How do I restore and upgrade my iPod Touch 1st generation so I can download newer  games on it?\n\nA: Unfortunately, you can't.\nThe latest iOS that the original iPod touch can run is 3.1.3 released February 2010\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_iOS\n", "Q: Programmatically mark file(s) to be ignored by Time Machine I'm writing some code that produces a kind of package file, however it includes a kind of working database that isn't strictly necessary (as it can be re-computed) but is best kept bundled with the package file.\nAnyway, the problem is that the database can get quite large, and often changes are fairly small, this means that these databases are always being backed up by Time Machine, which is very wasteful as they don't really add anything important to back-ups.\nI can't really ask the end-users to mark these databases manually for every package in their Time Machine preferences, especially if they move the package file around and forget. But I also don't want these databases to be waisting a bunch of space in their Time Machine backups, as it could cause premature pruning of old backups with no useful benefits.\nI've already considered moving the databases into the user's ~/Library/Caches folder but this is a lot more complicated to manage. The database is also useful within the package as it eliminates a somewhat lengthy pre-compute step.\nSo; is there any other means by which I can tell Time Machine to ignore a file or folder? Ideally something I can do via script, but if it requires a small program it's not a huge issue.\n\nA: There is a C function 'CSBackupSetItemExcluded' you can use to tell Time Machine to exclude a file.\nYou can find it documented here...\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MacOSX/Reference/Backup/#//apple_ref/c/func/CSBackupSetItemExcluded\n", "Q: Safari 8 leftbound URL with favicon In version 8 of safari the URL of a webpage is displayed centered in the adress-field, and the favicon (or apple-touch-icon) is invisible.\nOnly when I click into the adress-field the URL moves to the left edge and the favicon becomes visible.\nWhat must I do to always have the URL displayed leftbound with the favicon visible? \nThis is what I've got now, but don't like:\n\nThis is what I want:\n\nHow can I get it?\nbtw:\nIs there a way to display favicons in the tabs? sometimes its hard to navigate through many open tabs when there is nothing but text.

Should in-app purchases transfer between different devices that use the same Apple ID? Is it up to the developer?\nMy situation: I have two iPads. I purchased Monument Valley and installed it on both iPads. No problem. I only had to buy it once. Now there is the expansion, Forgotten Shores, which is implemented as an in-app purchase rather than a new game. I purchased it on one iPad, but the other iPad still shows it as something I would need to buy.\nI've tried deleting and re-installing from the second iPad. I've also tried syncing both devices to iTunes on my laptop. It still shows the expansion as something I would need to buy.\nIf I click buy, is Apple going to realize that I've already bought the expansion, and just tell the game that it is purchased? Or is it actually going to charge me again for the same expansion?\nI'm not sure how this is supposed to work... I haven't tried to do in-app purchases across devices before.\n\nA: Most apps with in-app purchases have the ability to redownload those purchases if, for instance, you delete the app & need to reinstall it, or if you are loading the app on another device with the same AppleID. Below, the Restore Purchase button in GarageBand which allows me to download loops I have purchased:\n\n", "Q: Enforce dedicated graphics on MBP 2010 My MBP (mid 2010) is suffering from the Intermittent black screen or loss of video issue. More specifically, it may happen that when switching from dedicated to integrated graphics, the screen goes black. Only a reboot helps in this case.\nSo I tried to disable the automatic graphics switching (via \"System Preferences\" -> \"Energy Saver\"). Nevertheless, graphics switching still occurs; I can't say when or what's causing that, though. It always appears to be the case after waking up from sleep / suspend-to-ram. As per gfxCardStatus, \"Dynamic Switching\" is enabled then, which is exactly what I seeked to prevent via the systems preferences.\nIs there a way to permanently disable the dynamic graphics switching and only work with the discrete graphics? I wouldn't mind the shortened battery lifetime if that helped to prevent the black screen issue to occur.\n\nA: Can you try and see if executing this in the terminal changes modes?\n<route to app>/gfxCardStatus.app/Contents/MacOS/gfxCardStatus --discrete\nOther available commands are --dynamic and --integrated. If that works, a workaround solution would be to automatically launch that command on wakeup.\n\nA: now i don't know when you purchased your computer, but apple offers 3 years extended warranty for your computer, if you can, make an appointment to a local appplestore, and try to get your graphic card replaced for free!\n", "Q: Retain print spool until printer available? I'd like to be able to add, by script and by hand, files on dropbox to the print queue and for these to be retained there until I'm at a specific printer with my Macbook Pro.\nAs it is now, I add docs to be printed when the printer isn't available and after a while these are removed before the printer becomes available.\nIs there a setting in OS X I can use to retain the files of the print spool until the printer in question is available? \nAlternatively, is there a simple print spool application that can handle this task? I've looked in the App Store and on macupdate.com and googled and found very little. \nAny suggestions how to solve this issue in OS X 10.9 Mavericks? \n\nA: As all macs using cups for printing, you can manage it with a web interface. To enable it, you have to type:\ncupsctl WebInterface=yes\n\nThen you should be able to check print server configuration, printers and queues from:\nhttp://127.0.0.1:631/\n\nIf you enter in this website, under Administration → Server, click on Advance and yo must see something like the following image:\n\nAs you can see, you will be able to modify the Retain Documents parameter, that is the amount of time a Document stay on the printer queue.\n", "Q: Shutdown cause -112 My 2013 rMBP regularly freezes (screen stays on but freezes as well). I have Yosemite 10.10.1. I couldn't see such behavior in 10.9 and I don't think it's a hardware issue (had the machine serviced and an Apple Hardware Test was performed, no issues found).\nIn the console I found the \"Previous shutdown cause: -112\".\nNow, I found various lists and also a header file where this error code occurs but it probably is not connected to this issue.\nAnybody has any clues regarding this problem? It happens at least once a week. Thankfully most data is preserved after the restart, but it is worrisome anyway.\n\nA: We have a small group of 2012 and 2013 retina MBP and only one in the group has the -112 restart cause logged when it freezes in a hard manner. The rest have never once froze hard or shut down/rebooted spontaneously.\nNo diagnostics from Apple show a specific failure - the SSD has been tested extensively and doesn't have any other errors that fsck lists or corrects (other than the typical minor and correctable filesystem corruption that a hard reboot causes).\nIn the last 3 months, it has logged two -112 restarts and two -128 restarts.\nIf you paid for AppleCare - take it in and get it repaired. If you have to pay for a repair, it will likely be the $300 to $400 flat rate repair where they send it in for factory diagnostics and overhaul.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible/a good idea to use an ExpressCard SSD for swap? I have a 48GB WinTec filemate ExpressCard SSD which I'm not currently using for anything.  My idea was that I would re-partition it with a 16GB partition for swap and virtual memory (I have 8GB of RAM), and the rest for either random files, or maybe stick a flavor of Linux on there.\nI have some concerns about it though.  The drive, while it is difficult to physically remove (you have to press really hard on that tiny 34 slot), it is still possible to remove it without ejecting the disk and powering off the slot.  So if it does get accidentally removed while the system has swap/virtual memory on it, what would happen?  Is there a way I could set it to switch to use another drive if the expresscard drive gets removed?\nAnother concern is speed.  I normally run at the almost the full 8GB of RAM and usually go over for most the day since I am usually running vagrant, Chrome with lots of plugins, multiple monitors, AirMail, HipChat, Skype, Sublime with lots of plugins, iTunes, and other random applications.  Since I am probably accessing swap frequently is this drive going to be too slow?  I will post the screenshots of the speed tests I did below.\nExpress Card SSD:\n\nSATA2 SSD:\n\nSATA1.5 HDD:\n\n\nA: This seems like a lot of work to me since your swap rates are easily measured and generally not at all the bottleneck that needs alleviating on OS X systems I've managed.\nLosing swap will be highly destructive to data integrity so you should have your system backed up regularly and able to be restored and files reconstructed if they become corrupt during a write operation. There are several guides here on how to move swap elsewhere, but I would say it's categorically a bad idea.\nIf you can post back what your exact hardware model is, perhaps there are better ways to accelerate your workload. I would post about 15 minutes of vm_stat 60 and a picture of your Activity Monitor memory when the system is fullly loaded and stable running your desired workload.\nMy initial thoughts are that you should install your OS onto the SSD and have the home folder on the normal \"boot drive\" rather than messing with swap. Apps will run properly, you can remove just about all installed apps from /Volumes/SSD/Applications and let the Library there and core OS have the entire space for swap and OS. Moving some highly used data files there might make the most sense as well. Again, these are educated guesses and without knowing the CPU / RAM / internals of your specific Mac, there might be better solutions as well.\n", "Q: Audio cutting out at certain points I'm trying to listen to a podcast through Apple's headphones on my Macbook Pro (Retina, 13 Inch, mid 2014), running OS X 10.10.1, but the audio keeps cutting out.\nWhen the audio cuts out, the following log messages appear in the Console app:\n26/11/14 18:27:51,370 AirPlayUIAgent[348]: 2014-11-26 06:27:51.369515 PM [AirPlayAVSys] AirPlay became the default audio device\n26/11/14 18:27:51,378 discoveryd[51]: AwdlD2d AwdlD2dStartBrowsingForKey: '_raop' Browsing service started\n26/11/14 18:27:51,379 discoveryd[51]: AwdlD2d AwdlD2dStartBrowsingForKey: '_airplay' Browsing service started\n26/11/14 18:27:51,407 SystemUIServer[198]: 2014-11-26 06:27:51.407192 PM [AirPlayAVSys] AirPlay became the default audio device\n26/11/14 18:27:51,437 coreaudiod[597]: 2014-11-26 06:27:51.436712 PM [AirPlay] Set up for stream GeneralAudio, PCM/44100/16/2 -> ALAC/44100/16/2\n26/11/14 18:27:51,437 coreaudiod[597]: 2014-11-26 06:27:51.436854 PM [AirPlay] Available DNS names: Infra [84383554262E@Julia\\032-\\032MacBook\\032Air._raop._tcp.local.%4], P2P [intentionally disabled]\n26/11/14 18:27:51,437 coreaudiod[597]: 2014-11-26 06:27:51.436997 PM [AirPlay] Pairing not required.

Bash and vim's file completion facilities are effective for navigating through a few levels of a directory structure, but can be cumbersome when working with unfamiliar directories.  Alternatively, I use a fuzzy search plugin in vim, which is effective within a project, but less so across the full drive.\nWhat I'd like to use in these situations is the osx file browser dialog.  I imagine this would be accomplished via the \"Save As...\" or \"Open...\" dialogs.  Is there any way to launch one of these dialogs from the command line and have it write the selection to stdout?\nI found this question about displaying alerts. The answers are focused on using Automator.  Can we use a similar approach to achieve my goal?\nWorst-case scenario, I imagine it wouldn't be too difficult to build, but I've been focused on web programming for the last 10 years or so.  Could someone point me in the direction of some relevant resources?  I imagine I'd need to build a native osx app in objective-c or Swift using Cocoa?\n\nA: This can be done using AppleScript, like in the question you linked to. Watch out, this is not the same as Automator.\nExample script:\nosascript -e 'tell application (path to frontmost application as text)\nset myFile to choose file\nPOSIX path of myFile\nend'\n\nThis uses the simplest form of the choose file command, and puts the result in the variable myFile.

This is the only way of connecting I have and for now I can only do it on Windows (with FortiClient 4.x.x) because 5 doesn't support importing .vpl anymore.\n\nA: You can use the \"FortiClientTools\" application in Windows to import your .vpl configuration file. From there, you can export the configuration file to a newer type (4.3/5.0) that can be imported into newer versions of FortiClient. Exported config files that are encrypted will likely have a filename extension of .sconn; unencrypted config files should be appended with .conn.\nIf you need to import those config files into the newest version (5.2) of FortiClient, you can change the filename extension from .sconn or .conn to the newer format (.sconf; .conf). Once the extension has been changed, you can import that config file under the FortiClient menu -> Preferences -> General -> Restore.\n", "Q: Dual screens and maximized video on Yosemite So when I maximize a video on Mac (Yosemite) it renders my other monitor useless.

Our UPS is set to shut down the computer after running on battery backup for 1 minute. I have tested this with an iMac running Mavericks (10.9.5) and the UPS behaves as expected, but on the Mac Mini running Yosemite the computer does not shut down and just continues to run off the battery. \nUpdated to add: I tested with the CyberPower 825VA and the Mac Mini running OS 10.10.0. Today I installed OS 10.10.1 update and tested again with the same results. I also tested with a Furman F1500-UPS in place of the CyberPower unit and there has been no change in the behavior.\nUpdated 11/28/2014--I have verified in Terminal that \"haltafter\" is on and set to 1. I also tried triggering a shutdown by \"haltlevel\" 100 (shutdown when battery dips below 100%) and the machine is still not shutting down. I tried booting from an external drive that has OS 10.8.5 on it, but the Mini would not let me do this.\nUpdated 12/01/2014--I booted the aforementioned iMac from an external Yosemite boot drive and it displays the same behavior as the Mac Mini. No progress on the issue thus far.\nUpdated 12/08/2014--I have now tested 3 different brands of UPS with 3 different Macs all with the same results. Have gone back & forth with Apple support about this for the last week and they haven't informed me of any progress on this issue yet. I will update when/if this is solved.\nUpdated 12/15/2014--After reporting this bug to Apple and several back and forth calls with them, this issue has been passed up to the engineering team that deals with Power Management. I was told I might hear something back today if there's a quick fix or workaround, otherwise this issue may not be resolved until 10.10.2 is released. \nUpdated 01/22/2015--After seeing Eric's reply below, I installed OS X 10.10.2 (14C106a) beta. I only tested with 1 UPS so far, a Furman F1500-UPS, but it is now functioning as expected.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my new Eaton 3S 550 UPS. I gave installing 10.10.2 beta a try (build 14C99d) and now it works!

It means the upstream software hasn't changed, just that the Homebrew formula has been revised in some way.\nTaking node as an example, the current release version of Node.js is \"0.10.33\". However the Homebrew version number has been updated to \"0.10.33_1\" (in other words, revision 1 of 0.10.33) because the formula was updated to point to a newer version of npm (one of node's dependencies) as you can see in this commit. So it is still the same version of node, but the Homebrew package itself has a new revision.\nSimilar the luajit package is updated to 2.0.3_1 in this commit where the lua dependency is updated to a newer version. lua itself hasn't been changed, it is still version 2.0.3 but the Homebrew formula has been updated.\nLong story short it's perfectly safe to update to releases with an underscore. They don't indicate beta releases.\n", "Q: How do I hook a new Mac Book Pro Retina up to dual DisplayPort monitors? I have two DisplayPort monitors.  These are regular DisplayPort monitors, not mini-Display Port, not made by Apple and not made specifically for Mac.\nI would like to buy a new Mac Book Pro Retina.  How can I hook it up to my dual DisplayPorts? What type of adapters do I need?\nAnd, if I can't do that, how can I hook it up to a single DisplayPOrt?\n\nA: From EveryMac…\n\nThis model supports a simultaneous maximum resolution up to 2560x1600 on two external displays via Thunderbolt. Alternately, it can support a single display up to 2560x1600 via Thunderbolt and a single 1080p display at up to 60 Hz, 3840x2160 at 30 Hz, or 4096x2160 at 24 Hz via HDMI.\n\nIf you have 2 Thunderbolt ports, you can use 2 miniDP to Display Port cables, one from each port, just as though the ports were miniDP as they are backwardly-compatible.\nSee Thunderbolt ports and displays: Frequently asked questions (FAQ)\n", "Q: My macbook air wont let me erase my disk?

I just noticed that I have a 2MB ~ file in the root of my Macbook HD. This wasn't here last time I checked (probably months ago,) and my guess is that it is from a system crash the other day or maybe from the upgrade to Yosemite.\nWhat is this file and can I delete it without incident?\n\n\n\nA: This seems to be an attempt to write something to the ~ directory, but instead has been written to the file /~. This file isn't required by OS X, but if an app is still using it then deleting it could break things. Make a backup if you delete it.\n", "Q: I can't figure out how to download podcasts I can't figure out, anymore, how to download my podcasts onto my ipod.\n\nA: What version of IOS do you have in your iPod??

I am using OSX already for a couple of years, but I still have trouble finding a good workflow for cleaning up photos in a folder using Finder. What I like to do is view each of the photos and delete some of them. \nWhat I currently do is: \n(a) put the relevant folder in List view (so I see all the details like size, and date modified), and \n(b) use quick look (by pressing spacebar) to see the photo. \n(c) Then I press cmd-backspace the delete the file if required.\nThe issue is: if I delete the file, the next file (or the preceding) file is not selected in Finder, which requires me to either use my mouse to select the next file (if I remember correctly which one it is), or (preferably) press the arrow keys a number of times to navigate to the relevant file.\nIn Windows Preview, deleting a file automatically shows the next file, which is very convenient. \nWhat would be a good workflow to do this simple task in Finder?\n(I don't want to use iPhoto etc. Using the icon view in Finder is not convenient either because the photos are too small and I can't use a single arrow key to go through each of the photos. I tried using Cover Flow in Finder, but I find the size of the photos also to be rather small)\n\nA: When I try this it works. Not that I would actually do this.\nI use QuollEyeTree (freeware) \nThis lets you Tag files of interest, then you can perform operations on the tagged files e.g. Delete, Move etc.\n\nA: I used to use ViewIt about £15 for the full version, but there is a freeware lite version. \nYou can go through folders of photos in full windowed or thumbnail view. Drag & drop a folder to the window to get started\nDelete is by key command as I recall, Cmd/backspace same as the Finder. Next pic is selected in thumbnail view or brought to the current view in full window view.\nHaven't needed it in years, so don't know how it's kept pace, but it might be worth checking out the lite version & also compare what you'd gain with the paid version.\nEdit - shows how long since I used it, sorry. The lite version is PPC only. The paid version will apparently run in permanent trial mode with nags. \n", "Q: How to Download m3u8 stream to local HD in OS X?

It's a recording.\nI've tried using the ffmpeg library using various commands but the resulting file was either not downloaded at all due to \"corrupted\" error, or was downloaded but was heavily corrupted.\n\nA: You can use FFmpeg for this.\nFor example:\n$ ffmpeg -user_agent \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_5) AppleWebKit/601.7.8 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/9.1.3 Safari/537.86.7\" -i http://185.38.12.60/sec/1503173737/363333397f6b65370bfc740ca4dea8c3f8dd2a93419f7748/ivs/12/b1/2ec5e15ba2a6/hls/tracks-4,5/index.m3u8 -c copy pd.mkv\n\nUser Agent is important key for many online cinema.\n", "Q: PDF \"is damaged and can't be opened\" on mounted drive I have a late 2013 MBP, OSX v10.10. I have a drive mounted via ssh tunnelling. The basic command looks like: \nalias mountCS='ssh -f useru@host1 -L port:host2 -N ; sshfs -p port user@localhost:remoteDir /Users/User/mnt/CS'\n\nWhile ssh'ed in to the same remote host I created a pdf from latex. When I try open to take a peek from mounted dir I get the error \"“results.pdf” is damaged and can’t be opened. You should eject the disk.\". However, this happens with R pdfs too. If I simply copy it to a local directory it opens fine though. Odd right? When I first set this sshfs mount up, it didn't do this. \n\nA: When this happens to me, I delete the ._results.pdf file, and then I can open it from the mounted directory.\n\nA: This is related to Files wrongly considered as damaged in encfs volume and probably this bug: https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/162 - so upgrading to a newer version of sshfs should work, but I've found that it works if you start sshfs with -o allow_root, so\nsshfs -o allow_root hostname:path mountpoint\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: Can I add a couple of text files in Xcode for write and read I'm using Xcode for developing in C++ language.

I spilt a little bit of juice on my Macbook Pro keyboard which causes the spacebar to stick (it still works but is not so convenient to use). I took it to a non-official Mac service where they told me that it needed some cleaning that would cost around $60. Then I took it to an official Apple service where the guy without any deeper investigation told me that a brand new replacement top-case is required for $600.\nThe computer is otherwise completely functional. I still have a warranty until February that would probably be void if a non-official service fixed it.\nDo you think the $600 offer is realistic and this much has to be paid just to fix a sticky spacebar?\nUpdate: my girlfriend accidently spilt a half glass of water on my keyboard, and after drying it, the stickiness vanished :D Gotta admit, Macbooks are of high quality and I should care more about my computer.\n\nA: That $600 rate is less than Apple charges for a liquid damage overhaul at the repair depots. That repair is around $900 for the Air and 13 inch models and $1200 for 15 inch models.\nSince the keyboard is integrated within the housing, it's like taking the engine, chassis and all parts out of a car and building it up new in a new frame.\nThe labor time and consumables (ribbon cables that are too fragile to reuse, etc...) seems about right for a $600 repair. Apple techs see this sort of things all the time, and won't push the expensive repair unless there is internal damage. A light cleaning would be $39 of labor or possibly free if they could do it while you waited. If they didn't open and inspect the Mac, you could ask what that charge would be to be sure it really needs an overhaul and rebuild.\nI would say, you could do a surface cleaning yourself as long as the machine is functional and then shop around for a used Mac between now and February. Then at worst, you could then do the $600 service or if the corrosion damages internal components you might be on the hook for the $900 repair. During that time look out for any Black Friday sales and/or new models since repairing it makes more sense if you have AppleCare for several years or really love this particular model Mac. You could also sell it for $700 to $800 to someone that needs a cheap Mac and then pay for the repair once you have an agreement for them to buy it. \nYou'd only be out of pocked a few hundred $$ and could buy your choice of new Mac. Lots of options, but the quote is legitimate and you would have a warranted Mac for 90 days post repair should you send it in.\n", "Q: Why don't my icloud.com contacts download to my iPhone?

I'd like to point out that i'm not referring to the general Mission Control which displays all aplication windows. I'm referring when displaying windows of the same app.\nFor example now (by default) is shows like this http://screencast.com/t/X4IlAs5Dj .\nThe problem is i can barely see the tabs inside Chrome and i have to either remember perfectly in which window i had a certain tab or just click on them until i find the right window.\nWhat i'd like would be to display the windows like this: http://screencast.com/t/RBqdpevli\nHaving them like this would be straight to the point.

It works in mission control too. \n\nAlso in mission control you can move your mouse to the app and scroll up to scatter the app windows, then you can use the Space Bar to have a sneak peak of the window at full size.\n\n", "Q: Why doesn't Google Drive show up in the list of apps when sharing a photo? \n*\n\n*Open the Photos app\n\n*Select an image\n\n*Pull up the menu (bottom left icon)\n\n*Available apps are Message, Mail, Twitter, etc.\n\n\nGoogle Drive does not show up in that list (which seems to be called \"Activities\").\nI have signed in to the Google Drive app and even restarted my phone.\n\nA: I just had the same issue here in August 2018 on iOS 11.4.  I am using the Apple-native Photos app and installed Google Drive two days ago, when I successfully was able to share from the Photos app onto Google Drive.  Now, two days later, it isn't working.  I tried the Save to Files option but Google Drive doesn't show up there either.\nTurns out, it appears that I have selected too many photos at one time to upload.  When I select ten or fewer photos to share, it shows the Google Drive icon in the Activities list as an option.  But when I select more than ten photos, the Google Drive icon disappears from the Activities list.  Must be some kind of internal limit placed on it or perhaps a total upload size limit.  So if I want to upload more than ten photos, I will just do more than one upload.\n\nA: It's a pain, can't be done at this time, but you CAN go through the Drive APP and select + and Upload Video and Images option to do about the same, but its not as intuitive / easy I agree.\n\nA: For Google Drive to show in an extensions list, the app must have been updated to support these extensions in iOS 8. It would appear at this time that the app has not been updated to support this.\n\nA: Answers above are old we are at iOS 10.  Google Drive did show and now it has disappeared just after successfully uploading from Photos to my Google Drive.\nI'm signed in and can see my drive contents.\n\nA: Have you checked the “Save to Files” option? \nI just now had the same question as you, found this post, figured it must have been deprecated, figured I’d give “files” a shot — found it there after the click. looks like thats where cloud & on disk storage options have been organized now.\n\nA: I've found that this issue occurs only when using non-Apple apps and confirmed that Google Drive appears in the Activities menu when on Safari. To have access to every possible app in the Activities menu, you must use an Apple app (Photos, Safari, etc). Hope this helps. \n", "Q: Can I call a phone number from the Terminal? In Yosemite, is there a way to start a phone call from the command-line aka Terminal?\nSomething like:\ncall +316123456789\n\n\nA: You can with open \"tel://+316123456789\" start a phone call process - but you still need to click on the \"Call\" button to make the call.\n\nTo do so, you may also simply press ↩. To automate everything via Applescript:\nopen location \"tel://+351918306031\"\ndelay 2\ntell application \"System Events\" to key code 36\n\n\nA: In theory, you could use Automator to setup a sequence of actions to trigger making a call.  I've never actually used Automator, but my understanding of it says it'll work.  \nFirst, you could create an Automator script that perhaps triggers Rene's answer of running open \"tel://+316123456789\" and clicking the 'Call' button. Or, you could have it open the Google Hangouts Chrome Extension and similarly dial a number.\nSecond, you would call the Automator script from the command line (as described here): \nopen MyAutomatorCaller.app --args '+316123456789'\n\nLastly, you could create a Bash alias for the above command (i.e. in ~/.bash_profile):\ncall() { \n    open MyAutomatorCaller.app --args $1\n}\n\n", "Q: Apple Mail: move message to another account or local folder and delete from the original account When I move a message from one account to another (by dragging, or \"Move to\"), or to a local folder, I expect the message to be deleted on the original account. However, what Apple Mail does is archiving the original message. Is it possible to realize my desired behavior (e.g., via a rule or a script)?\n\nA: It would only possibly work if the mail accounts were POP accounts and you had your server settings configured to delete messages from the server when read. Most mail accounts now use IMAP which use different behaviors for message storage, both on the server and in the email clients.\nYou could structure some Rules in Mail to accomplish what you're trying to do.\n\nA: Archive is a misnomer on Apple Mail. \nIt is not Archived. \nIt is actually the Goggles \"All Mail\" folder. \nIf you do not want to see it in your Apple Mail disable it in Google Mail.\nGoogle will keep all your emails in it.\n", "Q: Running OS X Yosemite, but About This Mac shows Version 10.90 In About this Mac it shows that the OS is Yosemite but the version number is 10.90.

Make sure you Use mobile partner and don't use the auto connect app of tata photon+.\nIf you have any query you can reach me at khushindergill@icloud.com or khushindergill@gmail.com\n\nA: This will definitely work out for tata photon max wifi data card. Go to Huawei support- consumer page, enter details of the dongle in the column to the right. E.g. my wingle was CE315 (you will not find photon max wifi data card in dongle group). Then download and install \"The tool and guide of HiLink AutoRun(for Mac10.10)\". After this your wingle  will start working.\n", "Q: Macbook Air 13 inch (256 GB/ 8 GB/ i5) along with Windows (Using BootCamp) I am completely new to the Mac and I am planning to buy MacAir (256 GB/ 8 GB/ i5) model and want to use Windows 7 along with it using BootCamp. I have no problem with MacOSX but need to use Windows (Visual Studio 2013 specially) because of my job demand (.Net Developer). I want to use Mac mainly because of Battery Life and Performance. My question is that Can I experience the same when I will use Windows? \nApart from that I also heard that Windows reduce the battery life. So Does it mean that my battery life will be affected even when I will use MacOSX. Thanks in Advance\n\nA: If you are truly dual booting (using Boot Camp) you will find your battery life better on OS X than on Windows. However, when you boot into OS X, you won't suffer any ill effects from having a separate Windows partition sitting idle. \nIf you opt to run Windows in a Virtual Machine (using, for example, Parallels Desktop, VMWare Fusion, or Virtualbox), you will notice a significant decrease in battery life because you'll be running both \"machines\" (OS X and Windows) at one time.\n", "Q: In OS X Yosemite, how to keep the app switcher (or dock) on my main display? I believe the app switcher (command + tab) is tied to where the dock \"is\". The dock is available on both displays, but I believe the last display in which you clicked on the dock is where it actually is. \nSo when the dock is on my secondary display, the app switcher shows on that display. Which throws me off and I would rather have the app switcher stay on my main display. \nHow can this be done? \n\nA: App Switcher is controlled by Dock. Whichever display the dock bar is on, so is App Switcher. This applescript is how I reset Dock bar to main display:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set screen edge of dock preferences to right\n    set screen edge of dock preferences to bottom\nend tell\n\nIf you run Dock unhidden/visible, most likely the Dock will make a flash appearance on the rightmost edge. To get rid of the flash:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n\n    set autohide of dock preferences to true\n    delay 0.2\n    set screen edge of dock preferences to right\n    set screen edge of dock preferences to bottom\n    set autohide of dock preferences to false\n\nend tell\n\nYou can bind the script to a keyboard shortcut so it can be invoked quickly when necessary.\nIf you always have Dock hidden, you can put the script in a loop with a preferred amount of delay, and run it as a daemon. This way the daemon will periodically make sure the dock is in main display.\n\nA: Desired Effects Sought\n\n\n*\n\n*Hide Dock at Will \n\n*Keep Dock on Main Screen\n\n\nHide Dock at Will\nSet hotkey to hide dock \nin OS X: System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Launchpad & Dock \n\n\n*\n\n*check  \"Dock Hiding On/Off”\n\n*Set hotkey for “Dock Hiding On/Off” to Control D (or whatever you want).\n\n*Set timing for Dock Hiding timing to long duration (as shown in the following commands). I set mine to 99 (I think) so I will not accidently trigger the Dock.\nSet timing for Dock Hiding timing to long duration (as shown in the following commands). I set mine to 99 (I think) so I will not accidently trigger the Dock. \nEnter this into Terminal to make the Dock show without a delay:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 0; killall Dock\n\nMaybe you want to have a long delay (5 seconds) so that you never accidentally trigger the Dock:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 5; killall Dock\n\nTo restore defaults:\ndefaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-delay; killall Dock\n\nKeep Dock on Main Screen\nYou would think this is easy, but what really screws things up is when you move an application to full screen. It wreaks havoc with the dock positioning as well as revealing. To fix the problem, I am now trying Lawrence Post for the Apple Scripts. I implement them using Keyboard Maestro (highly recommend that app for automating these things). Should the full screen situation create a dock positioning problem, I simply set a hotkey to execute the Apple Script and reposition the dock. \nStill to do\nAutomate using Keyboard Maestro to sense the dock has been moved to other monitors and automatically put the dock back to the main screen without using a hotkey.\n\nA: I keep my dock on the right side of the screen which keeps it on one display, i.e. the rightmost display when I set up the arrangement. \n\nA: The solution that worked for me was to move the dock from the side to the bottom. \nMy set-up:\n\nFrom System Preferences > Dock:\n\nGo to your main screen and take the cursor down to reveal the dock. Now try cmd+tab. The tab-switcher should appear in your main screen.\nI found that I hardly care if the dock is at the bottom since I have it hidden and use Spotlight almost always. For others the compromise may seem larger. \n\nA: As sudo-workaround. I recommend hiding the dock. It feels a little more natural to me. At least until they allow the option to keep in on one display.\n", "Q: Widevine disappeared in Chrome in Yosemite I updated to Yosemite a couple of days ago. When I watched a streaming service using Google Widevine it all worked fine but after a reboot Chrome keeps asking for me to install Widevine, and when I do and restart the browser it is still not working.

Basically, teach me some way with which I can install and repository from github.\nThanks.\n\nA: You don't need to compile the SET afaik, the install is:\n    git clone https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit\n    cd social-engineer-toolkit\n    python setup.py\n\nnow to start the setoolkit run\n    ./setoolkit\n\n\nA: There are (at least) three ways to proceed:\n\n\n*\n\n*run brew search <packagename> and, if successful, install via brew\n\n*write your own formula for brew\n\n*clone the repository with git and compile it yourself\n\n\nFor details on all three methods, it's best to consult the corresponding documentation (and come back with specific questions if you are stuck). \nPS: The tool mentioned in the question is actually written in Python, so compilation will not even be necessary. \n", "Q: Syncing Google Calendar with iPhone Alarms Does anyone know if there is a way to make google calendar alerts more intrusive on an iPhone? Currently, you just get a weak push notificiation, which is very easy to be ignored by accident.\nOne way would be to automatically sync calendar events with phone alarms (which are very intrusive, as they have to be manually disabled by users).\nIs something like this possible with a jailbroken iPhone?\n\nA: All you have to do is to choose a long and loud ringtone as your calendar alert sound. Try it, it works, and doesn't require any technical manipulation. You can change the alert from the preferences (and not within calendar itself). \nYou will probably have to make a ringtone yourself if the regular ones seem too harmless... A ringtone can be as long as 30 seconds. Here is how to make one: http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-make-ringtones-for-iphone/\nYou can also set a second alarm in calendar for an event. It will be hard to miss two consecutive alerts of 30 seconds!\n\nA: This worked for me!\n\n*\n\n*Synchronize Apple Calendar and Google Calendar by going to Settings -> Calendar -> Accounts -> Gmail(sign in to your account) -> turn on sync Calendars. As long as the notification is set up on Google Calendar, it will also notify you on Apple calendar.\n\n*Then you can go to Settings -> Calendar Alerts. There you can set up a ringtone of your choosing that is long.\nVoila! Your notifications should now behave just like an alarm.\n\nNote:\n\n*\n\n*Adding events to Apple Calendar will not add them to Google Calendar, but the other way around works! Add events to Google Calendar as usual.\n\n", "Q: How to Fix Disk Utility Getting Stuck on \"Verifying storage system\" Okay, had a brief power outage today that shut down my computer and external drives, so I figured I should run a quick disk check just to be safe.\nHowever, when I run try to verify with Disk Utility, one of the volumes (an encrypted Fusion Drive) is getting stuck on the \"Verifying storage system\" step. I've tried leaving it, but even after more than eight hours it wasn't showing any progress of any kind.\nI've tried using both the Disk Utility app as well as the diskutil verifyVolume command line utility, but nothing happens.\nI've also tried doing this with the volume not being used as the system volume, but it makes no difference; not sure if it's relevant, but even though the volume isn't the system volume, Disk Utility isn't unmounting it to verify it. It only just occurred to me now, so I'll try and remember tomorrow to keep the volume unmounted and run a check in that state to see if it makes any difference.\nI'm not even sure if I remember seeing the \"verifying storage system\" step before, or if it does come up it must scroll away quickly normally, certainly never had it stick before.\n\nA: So I tried running disk verification with the volume unmounted and verification occurred without getting stuck as before.\nYou can unmount a volume from Disk Utility (don't eject it), but if it's your system volume then you'll need to boot into the recovery partition (hold Command + R during start-up) as the volume won't unmount otherwise.\nI still can't determine why verification is getting stuck for the volume while it's mounted, or why Disk Utility isn't unmounting the volume automatically, but all tests are returning success so at least the file-system appears to be okay.\n", "Q: How to load images from PC to iOS 8 iPhone camera roll? I have 100 pictures on my PC that I want to load into my Camera Roll. The PC is running Vista so I can't install iCloud onto it.\nOn iCloud.com, I only see Notes, Contacts, etc, but not Photos.\nPlease help. Thanks.\n\nA: I recommend trying Dropbox or Cubby. I know Dropbox allows roughly 3GB (I think) for free and depending on the size of your photographs that may be enough. \nAll you do is login online and upload the photos to Dropbox (note that Cubby is comparable in nearly all aspects) and then install the app on your phone. You can then save the images to your camera roll. \nNote that if you use Backblaze (if you don't now perhaps you should anyway), you can simply download the images from your app on your phone. \n\nA: You can email the picture to your your Apple ID email address. You can then open that email on your phone and add the picture to your camera roll from there.\n\nA: By enabling iCloud Photo Library you can now visit https://www.icloud.com/photos and upload all your photos from there. Your iPhone will then automatically download your photos into its “Camera Roll.”\nSince this only requires a web browser, it works even on unsupported operating systems like Windows Vista.\nHowever this will also upload your photos from your iPhone to iCloud, which requires that you have enough iCloud Storage allowance to store all your photos in iCloud.\n\nA: The other answer seems to suggest solutions which involve manually saving photos. Additionally, this might not allow you to retain image metadata, such as when the picture you're transferring was taken. You may use iCloud Photo Library, but in some occasions (if the pictures are too big) you may not want to use up bandwidth uploading the photos to iCloud, and downloading them again.\nIn that case I'd recommend any of the myriad of Wifi photo transfer tools for iOS, such as WiFi Photo Transfer. This allow you to locally but wirelessly transfer photos to your iOS device easily, and retain picture metadata. This is done via a web browser, so the source OS is non-specific.\n\nA: Get app called Documents, it’s free.\nOnce you have it go to Wifi Transfer and follow instructions.\nIt is easy to use.\n", "Q: Disable alert: \"Cellular data disabled for [app]\" The above alert pops up every time I open an app whose access to cellular data I've turned off. This adds an unnecessary step every time I launch one of these apps. My feeling is, \"Who cares if cellular data is disabled for Photos? I just want to see my damn photos.\" This happens with 3rd party and native apps alike. I first noticed the issue in iOS 7 and am seeing it again in iOS 8. Is there a way to turn off these alerts?\n\nA: Sadly, there's no way to stop seeing that alert every time you open the app from the cellular data network.\nEvery time the app tries to connect to the Internet, then you'll see that alert.\nIn fact, there is one way you'll probably won't like, but just in case... If you put your phone on airplane mode, then you won't see that message (though you'll see the annoying \"no data connection\" if you perform any activity that asks for connection anyway).\n", "Q: 2013 MacBook Pro running on Yosemite crashes when thunderbolt is attached Ever since updating, and also now having a done a clean install, my 15\" retina mac book pro crashes every time I plug a thunderbolt connector into it - whether its the thunderbolt diplay, or a monitor, doesn't matter.\nAs a laptop it great - but I need to be able to hook it up to other display options.\nAny ideas?

Since you have only one account the system deduced automatically that only your account would be the one to unlock the drive. Since the users are predefined, Apple felt it best to just display the accounts in a clickable list.\nThe reason for this is if you had multiple accounts on the computer, but only wanted a select few to be able to unlock the drive you could enable those specific users and make it so the others required additional authorization from an enabled user.\nOS X also has a handy little helper in that OS X will pass the login info that you gave it during the boot drive unlock into the login window and bypass that screen so you don't have to type in your user/pass twice. \nhttp://support.apple.com/en-us/HT4790\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/PH18637\n", "Q: Fix a DIY Fusion Drive A few weeks ago, I took out my early 2011 13-inch MBP's optical drive, put my 500GB HDD in the optical drive area, put a 120GB SSD where the HDD used to live, and made a DIY Fusion Drive according to the instructions at Macworld's website. I got amazing results at the time (a formerly-1:21 boot time became 0:18!), but a few weeks later, I tend to get rather un-Fusion Drive-like speeds. I've seen Fusion Drives duplicate a 4GB file in 21 seconds (source), but a test run I did just now took 1:31. What can I do to restore my Fusion Drive to its youthful glory once again?\n\nA: What make SSD? \nSamsungs may need a firmware update & performance restoration to prevent slowdown [scary, done in DOS, using very inadequate instructions from Samsung, I've not yet braved it]... \n...or you could try TRIM Enabler which may go part way towards speeding it up again.\n\nA: There is no need/possibilty to fix that. This is a common behavior of Fusion Drives.\nThe Fusion Drive (\"CoreStorage\" in the pictures below) usually contains a logical volume group, a combination of a SSD and a HDD).\nAfter installing your system and some applications you'll get full SSD-speed copying a test file because all the files reside on the SSD:\n\nInstalling more applications and having more \"high priority data\" the SSD will be full and the only possibility to copy data to is the HDD. The test file will be copied with HDD-write speed:\n\nOver time your TestFile and some other low-priority data will be slowly swapped to the HDD, because you'll have even more high-priority data. The TestFile loses its high-priority status because of low accesses. The TestFile will be copied with even less than HDD-write speed because it has to read/write from/to the HDD at the same time:\n\nEven if the TestFile regains a high-priority status because of frequent accesses a resulting copy will be copied to the HDD with accordingly low HDD-write speed:\n\nPlease check this answer to determine where the TestFile may reside and where the TestFileCopy is written to.\nSome more usefull information: arstechnica and wikipedia.\n", "Q: iPhone 6 charging best practices \n*\n\n*Should I charge every night? (Assuming that I consume more than 50% during the day, but sometimes not much more.)\n\n*Should I turn off the device during the charge? (Assuming that I don’t need the device as an alarm clock.)\nAny other tips are also welcome.\n\nA: Yes, the ideal time to charge your phone is around 50% depletion. Ars Technica explains why:\n\nFull discharges put a lot of strain on the battery, and it's much better practice to do shallow discharges to no lower than 20 percent. In a way, this is like people running for exercise— running a few miles a day is fine, but running a marathon every day is generally not sustainable.\n\nTurning off the device may assist slightly in lowering heat, which in turn may extend the life of the battery by a minuscule amount, but it is not really enough to worry about.\n\nA: There’s no need to let it discharge 100% before recharging. Apple lithium-ion batteries work in charge cycles. You complete one charge cycle when you’ve used (discharged) an amount that equals 100% of your battery’s capacity — but not necessarily all from one charge. For instance, you might use 75% of your battery’s capacity one day, then recharge it fully overnight. If you use 25% the next day, you will have discharged a total of 100%, and the two days will add up to one charge cycle. \n...  \nSource : LINK\n\nA: It's worth looking at what Tesla recommends for its (Li-Ion) batteries in the Model S. Range and overall battery life are a lot more important in a car than a phone.\nThe strong recommendation is (1) keep the state of charge between 20% and 80%; (2) NEVER run the batteries down to 0%; (3) only charge to 100% occasionally, when you want (in a Tesla) maximum range for a long journey; and (4) don't charge when the batteries are extremely cold (0C or less) - the Tesla will actually divert current to warming its batteries before beginning a full charge.\nThe Tesla supercharger is very careful about how it charges. It will charge slowly at first if the SoC is low, then increase to full charge rate and drop off again when the SoC reaches around 80%. So it might take 2 hours to get to 80%, and ANOTHER 2 hours for the remains 20%. I hope the Apple charging system is also smart. \nWhich leads to the question of whether an Apple charger is better than a cheaper but faster OEM charger. I believe that charging is managed by the iPhone or iPad, not by the charger, so that would indicate that OEM chargers are OK. However, the Apple charger is pretty smart about how it rectifies mains AC to DC current and in its design for safety, and these factors are worth extra cost over ultra-cheap alternatives.\n", "Q: how to delete an administrator on yosemite My roommate moved out.

I have disabled it to keep TRIM enabled on my aftermarket SSD. What are the security issues I could run up against? If I install applications only from trusted resources can I run in any kind of trouble?\nI couldn't find online extensive answers to these questions. Sorry if it's a duplicate.\n\nA: TRIM Support has been enabled for Third Party SSDs in OS X El Capitan. You can google it or watch this Youtube video\n\nA: It is OK. It is mainly used to detect tampering/modification of device drivers at the kernel level. You should see Trim's note here http://www.cindori.org/trim-enabler-and-yosemite/\n\nIn OS X 10.10 (Yosemite), Apple has introduced a new security\n  requirement called kext signing. (A kext is a kernel extension, or a\n  driver, in Mac OS X)\nKext signing basically works by checking if all the drivers in the\n  system are unaltered by a third party, or approved by Apple. If they\n  have been modified, Yosemite will no longer load the driver.

I tried to do the same LSUIElement change in the plist file to Clock.app and it gave the same crash.  Some research told me the following:\n\nThere's one more step to the process if the developer has signed the application with an Apple Developer Certificate — and that includes all Mac App Store applications. Without this step, you'll likely get a crash when opening the app. To prevent this, you'll need to re-sign the application using the following command in the Terminal:\nsudo codesign -f -s - /path_to_app/appname.app\nReplace \"/path_to_app/appname.app\" with the path and the application name that you just tweaked the Info.plist for.

The link I pasted above also gives a few more warnings you should read before doing this.\nMake a backup, try it out, and let me know if you have the same success I did?\n\nA: .plist files use a key/value format, declaring the type of the key.

I have the corresponding Xcode as 5.1. Now In order to use Swift we need Xcode 6 and above which is only available for OSX 10.9 or later. \nMy question: \nI had to upgrade my OS sooner or later even if I was not using Swift. My concern are:\n1).I have lots of softwares installed on my current Macbook. Like I have Anaconda Python Distribution package. Similarly I have R studio , IDLE (Python 3.3) using Homebrew Package Manager etc. When I click on the online upgrade to Yosemite, will I lose all the existing softwares installed on my current OS?. What about other files? \n2). Also in case I don't lose my existing softwares, will the existing softwares stop working especially like Anaconda etc due to some compatibility conflict? \nI think I would have to upgrade to new OS which is Yosemite currently but I am very sceptical if this would make me lose my current set of softwares and files or make them incompatible with others? Some of those softwares installation is really a big pain like installing new Python using Homebrew along with other lib. \nPlease advise. \nThanks\n\nA: I can't directly answer your specific questions but I advise you to wait before upgrading. Right now version 10.0.1 is out and I still have a couple problems I never had on Mavericks (now imagine all issues you'll have coming from 10.8). \nBut as far as I remember from upgrading to Mavericks a year ago, I didn't lose any software or packages nor did I have any problems.\n\nA: Your existing software will remain in place. When upgrading your OSX installation from 10.8.5 to 10.10 it will not wipe your drive and you will not loose your current set of applications and files. The question of compatibility is however a separate issue.\nRegarding homebrew, there apparently was an issue with homebrew on Yosemite since the default version of ruby was upgraded to 2.00 on Yosemite. The issue has recently been closed so I suspect if you are running the latest update of homebrew it will continue working . Otherwise instructions on how to get it up and running again can be found in the following answer. The neat thing about homebrew is that everything is installed separately in /usr/local, so it does not conflict with shipped tools from Apple. My python3 installation from homebrew continues to work beautifully alongside the apple shipped version of python on Yosemite. \nApparently I can't find any information about Anaconda and Yosemite compatibility. A new version hasn't been posted since 09/30 and the changelog never even mentions about a fix/enhancement for yosemite.\nA special note about updating to Yosemite. I reckon that you have a lot of additional applications, libraries and files installed through homebrew or separate installers. During the installation your main drive (hdd/sdd) will be converted from a regular HFS+ Volume to a CoreStorage Logical Volume Group (more info at Arstechnica) which depending of the number of files can't take anywhere between 5 minutes and a couple of hours. It might look like the setup is stuck at\" One minute remaining\" but if you open up the installer log using the shortcutCommand + L you can see the installer moving your files. So don't worry about the setup being stuck and just wait it out (took about an hour on a 512GB SSD drive).\n", "Q: Upgrade vom 10.8 to 10.9 all of my Macs are running OSX Mavericks right now, except one iMac that is still on OSX 10.8.5\nI've tried to find a possibility to upgrade to Mavericks, but can only find Yosemite upgrades in the appStore - is there another possibility up upgrade that machine?\nThanks for your hints and ansers,\nThomas\n\nA: Update: I just found out from this answer Where can I get a copy of Mavericks after Yosimite has been released? that it is possible to download if you are a member of the Apple Developer Mac program. \nI tried the link from the US Store https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id675248567?mt=12 but it appears it is not available anymore.\nI found this from reddit http://www.reddit.com/r/osx/comments/1oey0b/download_os_x_109_mavericks_gm_final_dmg/\nThis is the link http://www.techglobex.net/2013/10/download-os-x-109-mavericks-gm-final.html\n\nDownload OS X 10.9 Mavericks GM Final .DMG Setup File (Build: 13A603,\n  Latest, V2) - Direct Link | Link 2 | Link 3 | Link 4 | Torrent Link |Link 2\nDownload OS X 10.9 Mavericks Server GM Final .DMG Setup File\nDownload Xcode 5.0.1 GM (Build: 5A2034a) Download iPhoto 9.4.7 Seed\nDownload Remote Desktop (Build: 370A61) Download .DMG Extractor for\n  .IPSW Files - Direct Link\n\nMake sure you check if it is legitimate https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202369\n\nFor OS X Lion or later, locate the lock icon () in the upper-right\n  corner of the Installer window’s title bar.\nFor Mac OS X Snow Leopard, a certificate icon is shown instead.\n\n\nA: If you have ever previously 'bought' Mavericks from the App Store, it will be available in your Purchases list & you can download it again.\nMine is showing 'resume' as I tried a partial download to test it still works.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu HUD in Mac OS Is there and app or something that gives Yosemite the functionality that Ubuntu HUD has - search menu for items?\nI am switching to Mac from Ubuntu.

I finally upgraded to iOS8.1.1 on my iPhone 5 a couple of days ago. Everything seemed to be fine, but when I went to record something this morning, I noticed that all of my voice memos were just dated, rather than showing the name/label I'd given them.\nI record a lot of voice memos for songwriting, melody ideas, rehearsals, etc. and have recordings going back to 2010, so knowing what they actually are is incredibly important. \nI double-checked and it looks like all of my voice memos are backed up to my PC via iTunes with the original names intact. Is there anyway to get them back into Voice Memos on my phone, with those names, or will they just revert back to the dates again?\n\nA: You could try using the free software iBrowse to open your iPhone, then open the Recordings folder, and look for Recordings.db. This can be opened with SQLite Database Browser. Open the DB in SQLite Database Browser, then Browse Data and find your filenames and their titles.\nIf they are not there, you could try making a new Voice Memo, and repeat this procedure. Now see if you can manually edit the DB to make the rest of your files match the format used to name the new Voice Memo. Ultimately save your .DB and copy it back to your iPhone using iBrowse.

When it starts to heat the battery drops sharply and sometimes the phone simply dies\nI'm fairly certain that the hardware in my phone is being affected with this overheating\nMy first year phone warranty ends in 10 days and I'm contemplating whether I should give it to Apple India Service and if they will replace my phone.\nAny Solutions? Suggestions? Experiences with Indian Apple Service Centres?\n\nA: Although there are several other answers, I'll contribute my own $0.02 for future readers as well.\nThe device is overheating due to processes consuming the device's physical memory and is causing it to overheat. Activities like calling and data usage often requires a lot of battery power, which then leads to the device over-heating.\nSome temporary solutions would be to:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you are standing in the sun, remove the device from the heat.\n\n*Closing background applications when not using them to avoid battery consumption.\n\n*\n\n*This also includes disabling WiFi and/or service when not in use.\n\n*Games are very bad at power consumption, \"Clash of Clans\"  being a major example using up to 10.3mAh/min sometimes even when not in use.\n\n*Avoid the use of 3rd party cables (as mentioned by another user who answered).\n\n\n*Put your phone into sleep mode every once in a while the system can cool down and regain some of the used RAM.\n\n*Delete some apps, the less apps using your battery and memory the better.\n\n\n\nAs for long term solution, get the new phone. Even though the device heating to rather hot temperatures can be normal, after a short period of data usage it shouldn't. Often times it is some faulty hardware that is causing the problems.\nIf you aren't in the situation to get a new phone, then a factory reset is the way to go. This will delete any apps or cached data that would be causing the battery over-consumption and would restore the device to its intended factory abilities.\nHope this helped!\n\nA: Happened to me but different iPhone model. I got hints from here https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4338574?start=0\nStarting from fresh (factory reset) worked for me.\n\nA: Mine did the same thing. I wiped and restored it to a backup several times with no improvement. The Genius at The Apple Store couldn't figure out what was wrong and eventually replaced it. The new one does the same thing, but not with as much frequency and it doesn't randomly restart itself with the apple screen as the old one did. \nMy original 5s always ran hot, but the problems became magnified tenfold with the introduction of iOS 8. \nI think swapping it out for a replacement is a good idea, though you may still experience similar problems at least it'll be a fresh battery that's getting pounded rather than a year old battery that is already deprecated from use. \nGiven that Apple no longer bothers applying any quality control to their software, it would seem they've decided it's more cost effective for them to repeatedly replace hardware that fails as a result of their unfixed software bugs than pay engineers to eliminate those bugs before releasing said software. And they're right! Most (American) people will just suffer with a glitchy, unusable piece of garbage rather than go to the trouble -- and it frequently and intentionally is a lot of trouble -- of demanding a company honor their own warranty.\n\nA: don't use a third party cable or plug when charging your iPhone, they can damage your iPhone, causing them to overheat.\n", "Q: What Time Does My iTunes Gift Get Received To The Recipient?

I want to try out and compare both the Cocoa- and X11-based versions of Emacs.\nIn general, I try to install all such packages through Homebrew, but in this case it looks like I Homebrew requires me to choose one of the two versions.\nIs there a way for Homebrew to install and simultaneously manage two parallel installations of Emacs?\nIf not, I suppose that I'd install/manage one of the two versions with Homebrew, and the other one \"by hand\".  In this case, however, I'd like the non-Homebrew installation to be configured and built exactly as Homebrew would.  This means configuring the build in the same way as Homebrew does, except for those aspects of the installation (e.g. locations of runtime files) that would directly conflict with Homebrew's Emacs installation.\nWhat's the simplest way to generate an installation script that would faithfully replicate Homebrew's build for one of these two versions of Emacs?\n(I imagine that the task mentioned in the last question would be a triviality for Ruby programmers, but I don't know the first thing about Ruby.  I write code for a living, though, so solutions involving some programming–say, python/perl/bash scripting–would be fine with me.)\nBTW, the solution does not have to be \"super maintainable\", since I expect that after running this side-by-side comparison for at most a few months I'll pick one of the two versions, and stick with it from then on.\n\nBackgroundFor many, many years I've been happily running Emacs on Terminal, in text-only mode.  What makes this set-up less ideal than it has been so far is that now I want to start using Emacs' Org Mode, which has many key combinations that don't get correctly transmitted by Terminal.  For example, when I type M-S-<right>, what Emacs actually receives—via Terminal—is M-<right>.  This is a known issue, and there are official work-arounds for it, but I'd prefer to avoid them altogether if I can.  My hope is that one or both of the versions of Emacs mentioned in this question will do this.  But, since I've been using Emacs 5-10 hrs/day for almost three decades now, I've become quite sensitive to the details of my interaction with it.  This is why I want to try both the Cocoa- and X11-based versions of it side-by-side before settling for one.  If neither fits the bill, I'll try AquamacsEmacs.  I tried AE several years ago, but it did not win me over (for reasons I can no longer remember), so I see AE as a distant third choice.\n\nA: In this case I would install Aquamacs or Emacs for OS X to get the Cocoa version and Homebrew for the X11 version.\nAquamacs is tuned to appear more Mac like so might not do exactly what you want - but all this is done in configuration so easy to change for an emacs veteran\n\nA: Homebrew no longer supports the --with-x option, but you can build an x11 version of emacs for OS X from the source pretty easily. \nconfigure --with-x --without-makeinfo --with-jpeg=no --with-gif=no --with-tiff=no\n\nHowever I had to do a couple of hacky things to make this work and I'm not sure why. To get the configure script you have to use autoconf, which by default will generate a configure that builds the cocoa version. It seems to be necessary to use the '--enable_ns=no' option to prevent this (ns for nextstep), however neither configure nor autoconf recognizes this option for some reason. So I had autoconf generate configure and then went in and manually set with_ns=no at some point in configure.\n", "Q: Process using more memory than I physically have I'm loading a 4GB csv in Python using pandas, and activity monitor says I'm using more RAM than I physically have in my laptop (15GB out of 8GB). How's this possible internally?\n\n\nA: This guy explains it well http://www.chriswrites.com/what-is-virtual-memory-on-the-mac/\n\nSo What is Virtual Memory?\nYour Mac comes with a limited amount of\n  physical memory (RAM) installed by default. Memory is critical to any\n  computer to run applications and carry out all the operations\n  commanded by the user. Memory must be as fast as possible (and it\n  helps to have as much as possible) to maximise your Mac’s performance;\n  thankfully, prices have drastically fallen in recent years.\n  Nevertheless, every computer has a finite amount of memory so Mac OS X\n  might actually need to use more than is physically available on your\n  system.\nThis is where virtual memory comes in – you can think of it as a kind\n  of extension to the real memory on your system, albeit much slower\n  because it is in fact physical space on your hard disk (or SSD, if you\n  have one installed). Let’s say that you have 4 GB of main memory on\n  your Mac and a 512 GB hard disk. If Mac OS X needs to use all 4 GB of\n  main memory, it can still make use of any free space on your hard disk\n  as an extension to that memory. Unfortunately, virtual memory is much\n  slower than the physical RAM installed in your computer, because hard\n  disks cannot match the speed of memory chips.\n\n", "Q: OS X Yosemite Hard Disk Errors even after Repairing them Basically, I do a lot of C programming (for class) so I use gcc a lot on my mac.

Is this happening to anyone else? How can I get past this?\n\nA: I have the same issue. The DNS name doesn't exist, so changing browsers is of no use.\nApple needs to either publish the domain name in DNS so that it resolves to an IP address or they need to update the HTML to use the correct name that does exist.\nIt appears that either Apple's DNS broke and they either haven't realised, don't care to fix it, or it is very difficult to fix and they haven't put a workaround in place (improbable IMFO).\nUnless you know what the IP address should be and it's just a DNS issue, you could add a host entry as a workaround. However, if the IP address is unknown or if the server/infrastructure is down in addition to DNS then there is nothing we can do except wait for Apple and hope they fix it.\n\nA: So apparently the Register button does nothing.

This change happened when I upgraded to Yosemite 10.10.1. \nThis is indicated by, very randomly, a share suddenly appearing empty in the Finder. It will still have its icon, but opening it will display an empty folder. When this happens the console will be flooded with \"Reconnecting to share\" messages - about 10 per second! \nThis is erratic - I can sometimes go days without it happening, or sometimes it happens within a few minutes of being connected. There is no specific file or folder that I am accessing which causes it. I can simply mount the share and never touch it and it locks, but I can also rsync the entire contents of the share to a backup drive and it does not lock. This to me rules out the possibility of a badly formed filename or something.\nIf I try to connect to a second share while the first share is in this state, the connection never completes. The \"Connecting to smb://...\" dialog remains on-screen indefinitely.\nAnd the worst of all: If I actually try to eject the stuck share, the Mac becomes unusable. Apps beachball permanently. The console app even hangs, so I can't read any messages. If I have a terminal up still, executing any command that does any sort of filesystem operation will hang the terminal. Running a \"df\" command will hang the terminal. Essentially the entire filesystem layer drops the spinning beachball (lol). The only way out is a hard reboot (control-command-power).\nThe same behavior also occurs if I forcefully stop the Samba server running on the Linux box. As soon as the connection disappears, the Console will show a message reporting that the share is inaccessible, and at that point, the console freezes and no further messages appear, and all of the other filesystem-related behavior I described happens.\nThe upshot is it seems that the process that manages the mount to the Samba share is buggy in some way. Has anyone experienced issues like this? Before I submit this as a bug report to Apple, I'd like to make sure it's really an issue with the OS X CIFS/SMB drivers, and not with some obscure edge case scenario. Of course, the fact that this issue does not occur on 10.10.0 or any previous version of OS X is a telltale sign, but I am also not even sure what to report because as I said, the behavior is erratic, unpredictable, random and when it does occur, no logs can be obtained.\nThanks!\n\nA: I've had similar problems compared to what you're describing, although it sounds like your problems are worse. It's very common based on what I've read and there's no cure. The issue is that Apple isn't using the Samba software but rather their own version. Here's my experience, FWIW:\n\n\n*\n\n*SMB volumes were slower for me on Mavericks and older on these machines. Upgrading to 10.10.2 has sped it up and made everything work much better.\n\n*The shares are still very slow. One very large share performs much like you're describing at times. But other smaller ones are fairly managable, albeit frustrating.\n\n*We use Path Finder to connect to our shares, not Finder. This may be superstition on our part, as I don't know if it is actually doing anything different. But it does seem to give us fewer crashes.\n\n*DF in the terminal does not create the issue you have, it just lists like normal.\n\n*I have upgraded the RAM, but the hardware is older. One Mac Pro 2008 model has 8GB while another has 16GB. I've seen machines have a slow finder when they don't have enough RAM, but the problem is the software. Unfortunately, upgrading the RAM was the only solution I had to improve performance.\n\n*Windows shares may not list as slowly as my Linux NAS, but I have no benchmarks to prove that. (That would make sense if both weren't using Server Message Block.)\nIf none of this information helps you, may I ask if you've tried a fresh install?\nAs for me, I'm very interested in compiling Samba from source providing I can find enough support.\n\nA: Update from 2022! I too experience issues with samba mount from macOS for many releases. It's still happening with macOS 12.3.1. It's a lot more stable but if you stress it (working with Adobe Lightroom Classic raw files over the network) you can still get panics. Figer crossed Apple will resolve this compmletely before this question turns a decade old. \n", "Q: \"Buy me a coffee\" as in-app purchase? Does Apple tolerate a \"buy me a coffee\" feature as In-App purchase ? \n\nA: Yes. This kind of 'donation' IAP is fine and approved by Apple.\nThis has always been possible, but Apple also clarified this with an update to the App Store Guidelines in February 2021:\n\n3.1.1: Clarified how apps can enable customers to “tip” developers: “Apps may use in-app purchase currencies to enable customers to “tip” the developer or digital content providers in the app.”\n\nFor an example of an app which uses this, see Pedometer++ (an app promoted by Apple on numerous occasions) which uses three donation IAPs of different values to allow users more control over the quantity of their donation—also allowed.\n                                 \n", "Q: Extract target of alias from Terminal In my Finder windows I have many aliases that target other folders or documents. At the shell prompt in Terminal, these aliases show up as regular files. How can I get the target of an alias so that, for example, I can \"cd\" to it or perform other command-line operations on the alias target?\n\nA: To enable cd'ing into an Folder Alias I've found the following at Mac OS X Hints. Don't know if it still works.\n\nHere is the bash function I include in .bashrc. Note that the second elif       requires double brackets for the test, because it include the logical operator     or (||):\n\nfunction cd {\n  if [ ${#1} == 0 ]; then\n    builtin cd\n  elif [ -d \"${1}\" ]; then\n    builtin cd \"${1}\"\n  elif [[ -f \"${1}\" || -L \"${1}\" ]]; then\n    path=$(getTrueName \"$1\")\n    builtin cd \"$path\"\n  else\n    builtin cd \"${1}\"\n  fi\n}\n\n\nAnd here's the C source code for getTrueName. \n\nA similar approach is available at superuser.com\n\nA: Maybe I'm off but ...\nAnother approach would be simply to replace mac aliases by regular unix links via \"ln -s ..\".\nIt has many advantages as Finder shows links as aliases but many applications works as if links were their target.\nMac aliases are not always seen by applications as their target so that's also a good reason to prefer regular links… especially if you are used to terminal commands and want something really reliable at system level.\nOnly a suggestion and as already said, I may be far from your needs.\nHope it can help anyway. :D\n", "Q: Can I take the optical drive out of my MacBook Pro? I'm proud to say that I'm the happy owner of an almost antique 2009 MacBook Pro. I've had this 15-inch MacBook Pro for quite a while now and I'm not planning on changing it (have you seen the price of MacBooks these days?). As it is quite old now, it is not really working as well as before and my optical drive doesn't work anymore. It does not recognise any CD and keeps burping them out. It doesn't really matter as I've gotten used to it and don't use the optical drive now.\nSo here is my question: \nCan I safely take the optical drive out and not replace it with another one?\nI know it is possible to take it out and put an SSD in instead but what about just taking in out? And leave and empty space? What about the cables? Can they just hang in there and not be attached to anything?\nI'm just thinking it could lighten up my already quite heavy laptop.\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to remove the optical drive. However, it isn't that easy. You will need several specialized screwdrivers, a tool to remove the cables, and some manual dexterity. If you have experience disassembling laptops it will not be a problem.\nGo to ifixit.com and find the instructions for your model. \nSide note #1: this would be a good time to change the spinning drive for an SSD. \nSide note #2: I don't find the price of MacBooks these days to be excessive. Have you seen the junk you get for $500?\n\nA: I can confirm that removing the optical drive in a MacBook Pro 13\" Unibody Mid 2010 2.4GHz 7,1 with 10.10 installed by following MacBook pro 2010 13\" ifixit instructions and leaving it empty works and causes no immediate problems.\nInstructions for your 2009 15\" MacBook Pro are available on ifixit.\n\nA: Simple answer, yes.\nIf it's not there it will be ignored as though it doesn't exist… which it won't.\n\nA: iFixit has a guide here. They also sell an adapter that you can use to replace it with a hard drive or solid-state drive, although just taking out the drive should not cause problems other than voiding your warranty.\n", "Q: Mac Mail has very slow to send/receive mail (plus other bugs too) It's been worse since Yosemite.\nFrom the same exchange account (office365) I will send and receive emails instantly on my phone, but they will take several minutes through the app.\nLoading existing conversations also often takes a long time.\nConversations often get jumbled up and emails that don't belong will be added to a conversation.\nAnd finally accepting event invitations is a little messed up. I click accept and nothing happens. Then a few minutes later the email will dissapear and the event will appear in the calendar.\nI am having these issues on both my laptops.\nI've tried offlining and enabling the account. Also tried reindexing.\nDoes anyone know if these are just Yosemite bugs? Or is there somethinng I can do to fix it? \nThanks!\n\nA: I also had extremely slow mail using Yosemite until I did this:\nFrom the Mail menu, click Preferences > Accounts > Mailbox Behaviors\nDrafts:\nStore draft messages on the server > leave unchecked\nSent:\nStore sent messages on the server > leave unchecked\nJunk:\nStore junk messages on the server > checked\nDelete junk messages when > Never\nTrash:\nMove deleted messages to the Trash mailbox > leave unchecked\nStore deleted messages on the server > leave unchecked\n\nA: I have found Mail to be much improved following Johann's recommendations.\nWhat I would like to add is the first time I followed Johann's advice I overlooked that I needed to make these edits individually to each of my four (4) mailbox accounts.\nIf you have multiple accounts usually the first account is highlighted when you enter Preferences.  After making edits to that account, be sure to click on each of your other accounts and verify what is checked or unchecked in all of your other accounts.\n\nA: under the mailbox menu the last item is \"rebuild.\" Do this for each mailbox. The mail will seem to disappear but when the rebuild is done, how long depending on how many messages are in the mailbox, everything should be back and mail.app should run faster.\n", "Q: Reduce the minimum iPhone volume (bluetooth speakers) When connecting my iPhone (4S or 6) to a JBL Flip 2 bluetooth speakers, the minimum volume is too loud. Under that, it mutes. It is not a problem of the speakers, as the volume using another, non-Apple, phone, can be reduced much more.\nIs there a way to get finer decrements of the volume than those of the side buttons? Moving the slider suggests so, but it is difficult to control in such small space. \nI tried using a volume cap as suggested elsewehere, but there seems to have no effect on the volume precision. \nAny ideas?\n\nA: I was just here searching for a way to do exactly this (reduce the \"Step\" for volume adjustments).  I gave up and went to solve a couple more music/iPhone related problems.\nAnyway, turns out that if you have the Apple Watch and use it's built-in volume control, there are no stops--even when playing through bluetooth it let me adjust all the way from really loud down to whisper.\nAnother thing to notice--after I adjust my phone volume with the watch I think it somehow affects the built-in controls and I'm able to get a different range but I can't put my finger on exactly what's going on--and after I leave it sit for a while it goes back to it's old behavior.\n\nA: Slide up the Control Center. There you'll have a slider to control volume which allows stepless adjusting.\n", "Q: Lightweight Mavericks installation What should I do to aggressively lower the memory usage of my Mavericks installation ?\nThe only things I need to run are XCode and Firefox, everything else can go out the window; I'm not opening any app and yet I already feel the system's slowness, which is understandable because it runs with only 2,5GB of RAM but unfortunately I can't upgrade right now, so what should I disable and where ?\n\nA: Go to Activity Monitor's Memory tab and sort the list of processes by Memory. You'll have a complete list of your biggest RAM hogs, complete with the ability to select and quit them right from Activity Monitor.\nAlso, Memory Diag is a great app for freeing up RAM. Just click on its menu bar icon, click the big Optimize button (provided you're not at critical RAM usage), and watch the RAM free up!\nAlso, I highly recommend Safari instead of Firefox. Safari shows you the individual websites in Activity Monitor, so you can just quit the most RAM-hungry sites.\n(EDIT: It shows you the actual URLs in Yosemite. In Mavericks, you'll see several Safari Web Content processes, but you can hover over them to see the URLs.)\n", "Q: Would it violate the TOS to install a third party hard drive? \nIs it a violation of apples terms of service to\n  replace the factory installed hard drive with a larger third party\n  one?\n\nI understand that it is a violation of the terms of service to install OSX on non-apple hardware and I was wondering if installing a third party hard drive would be a violation. If so would I need to buy a first party hard drive directly from apple, or is it completely taboo to poke around inside an apple product?\nSimply put can you replace the hard drive of an Apple laptop with a third party hard drive?\n\nA: Done all the time. Apple does not make drives, so really all drives are non-Apple hardware.\nThe TOS restriction is targeted at complete clones - main board, case etc.\nVarious Apple models over the years have considered the drives to be user-replaceable - they just slide out without any tools. The pre-cylinder Mac Pro and XServes are good examples. Various laptop models made the drive very easy to change - one screw and it pops right out.\n\nA: you will void your warranty unless you have a certified apple technician do it.\n(many small tech shops are apple certified, not just apple store geniuses.)\n", "Q: Installing Mavericks on a brand new machine that shipped with Yosemite pre-installed? Due to battery backups not working properly in Yosemite, I need to downgrade a machine to Mavericks. Unfortunately, this is a brand new Mac Mini and it shipped with OS X 10.10.0 installed. \nI read various questions here, as well as some articles from other websites, and created a Mavericks 10.9.5 installer on a USB stick. I can boot from this USB stick on an iMac we have here, but the Mac Mini will not allow me to. \nIs it even possible to run Mavericks on this machine--Macmini7,1? \n\nA: It's a great big \"Maybe\".\nThe installer will likely decline, but it will really depend on the hardware and drivers the hardware needs.\nHere's what you do:\nGet an external drive. USB > 8Gb will work. Plug this drive into a Mavericks-compatible machine and install Mavericks on the external.\nNow plug it into the new Mini. Reboot holding the Option key, wait for the boot picker to appear. Choose the external with Mavericks.\nIf you get a kernel panic, the new Mini will not run Mavericks.\nIf it boots to the desktop, you're good. Get some cloning software like Carbon Copy Cloner, erase the Mini's internal drive and clone Mavericks from the external drive to the Mini.\n\nA: No, not possible.\nIt can be possible when the a mac was delivered before with Mavericks. But the 7,1 was delivered with Yosemite from the beginning.\n\nA: If you absolutely must run it and provided Mavericks has drivers for new Haswell Iris graphics you might look here for solution.\nThat would be piker's alpha boot loader which is usually used to run Mavericks on 2006/7 Mac Pros but since it can fake SMBIOS values where system get information about Mac hardware to OS X it might work to fool Mavericks into thinking it is one of the supported model.\n", "Q: How do I install Flash in the guest account only?

It seems to happen once or twice within a few minutes after I come out of sleep.  A smallish banner on the top right kind of slides in place.  It's always text that starts with \"Breaking Apple News\" and then it advertises something.\nIs this Malware, or did Apple really stoop to this level?  If it's really Apple SW doing this, is it at least optional to disable it?  I paid for my MacBook Pro.  I don't think slide in ads are appropriate here.\n\nA: You may have accidentally allowed a website to send you push notifications. If you use Safari, go into Preferences > Notifications, and see if you've allowed any sites to give you notifications.\n\nA: The sliding banner in the upper right of my MacBook Pro was a nuisance, too. To eliminate it, I clicked the apple icon in the upper menu bar and selected \"preferences\". In preferences, select \"notifications\". In notifications, highlite each item (such as Pinterest) from the left display box and un-check it in the right display area. You must do this for each site that is appearing in the sliding ad boxes on your machine. They will appear in the left display box when you go to notifications.

I'd like to get a Time Capsule so that the documents are backed up when the time comes. However, the thought crossed my mind that the old iMac with OS X 10.5 might not be compatible with the new Time Capsule. \n\nA: The new Time Capsules require OS X 10.75 and later:\nhttp://www.apple.com/airport-time-capsule/specs/\nYour best option is to upload your documents online (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) as your 10.5 backup on an external drive say, may not restore to the current version of OS X.\n\nA: Purchase an inexpensive USB external HD and either manually copy the user's data from iMac to HD, or do a Time Machine or SuperDuper! backup. Time Machine and Migration Assistant are a perfect pair for restoring older systems to new.\nBe aware that in order to run Migration Assistant on a newer version of Mac OS X, the Time Machine source backup must be created on a Snow Leopard (10.6.8 latest) or later installation, so you will need to upgrade this Mac, if possible.

But where is Notes getting the old information?  If I choose the Accounts... menu item in Notes, it takes me to the Mail, Contacts, and Calendars pane in System Preferences, which currently has nothing in it.  If I click Add Other Account there, it takes me over to Mail, as if I were going to add a new Mail account.  But Mail is already correctly connecting to the new server, I don't want a new account there!\nI tried repairing disk permissions and it didn't help.\nI'm tempted to nuke the Notes files in ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes and see if it gets reconstructed.\n\nA: Notes accounts are usually associated with email accounts like iCloud, gmail, yahoo etc.\nif you have an iCloud/iTunes account, log in to it under System Preferences-->Internet Accounts\nClick the checkbox next to notes.\nOpen Notes, then drag your old notes into the iCloud account on the left.\n\nA: Well, I seem to have fixed it myself.  In ~/Library/Containers, I renamed the folder com.apple.Notes.  When I next opened Notes.app, it reconfigured itself, asked for access to some keychain items, and now it can communicate with my IMAP account.

Run Task Manager (in More Tools menu or got to chrome://system/) and check memory used by opened tabs and kill them. If won't help, Force Quitting the affected application should solve the problem.\nAlternatively check your memory pressure (memory_pressure command) and double check your free space so there is enough storage for swap files. Also try running sudo purge from the Terminal.\n\nA: More likely it is a problem with the OS itself. I just received this message when I had just a few programs open and memory pressure was \"green\" in Activity Monitor - but my uptime is 106 days. As everyone know - no computer/OS can run forever without a restart although 106 days is not a high number if you compare with mainframes, but for a personal system it is pretty good (albeit my second Mac's uptime is 168 days as we speak - with no signs of running out of memory). Restart is probably the best suggestion until Apple fixes this.\n\nA: It's possible there is some odd request for memory that the virtual memory system cannot oblige. The best bet is to restart the Mac and then run Activity Monitor to show the memory pressure and then observe those memory details when/if you reach that memory state again.\nIt's likely something caused by a buggy program leaking memory - so you could look into updating any programs that are running when this last happened to ensure it's not something that a bug fix can remedy.\n\nA: The very same issue happened to me a couple days ago.\nI follow these instructions to reset my Mac's NVRAM and PRAM. The memory consumption went from 4.5 GB down to 2.8 GB when it started up. \n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off your Mac.\n\n*Turn it back on again and press & hold Command+Option+P+R (all at the same time) before the gray screen appears.\n\n*Hold the keys until you hear your Mac start up for the second time (let it beeps twice).\nI had to repeat the process, one time right after the other, and now my memory issues have been solved.\n\nA: If you're seeing this message but the listed applications don't seem to explain the supposed excessive memory consumption, check whether non-application processes might be behind it. They'll be listed in the Memory tab of Activity Monitor, but won't appear in that dialog.\nI was being barraged by this dialog with neither the listed applications nor free disk space explaining the supposed problem. Turns out I had a few UNIX processes using unusually large amounts of memory. The amounts they were using still don't explain the dialog's claim, and memory pressure was still in the green, but as soon as I quit them (didn't even have to force-quit) the dialogs stopped and haven't recurred since.\nWARNING: It's a good idea to do a little online research into what any unknown processes are and do before forcibly quitting them, as some may have significant bad effects on the system if killed. Depending on the process, it may be preferable to restart the system either in lieu of, or immediately after, force-quitting it.\n\nA: There may be multiple causes of this error message because I get the error message regularly and have 300GB free on a 500GB SSD.  32GB RAM and the message has popped up with only about 24GB of physical RAM used.\nIt's always been when I had a crap ton of Safari tabs open.  I suspect a memory management issue with Safari.  Maybe some websites trigger it but Safari should be resilient enough to recover.  \nAdditionally, Safari all too often throws the \"force reload\" option at me because web pages have stopped responding.  It's just not ready for prime time.  Someone needs to tamp down the bozo eruption in the Safari team...\n\nA: In my experience, this occurs when my main system hard drive is running low on free space.  Operating Systems use the hard drive for extra memory storage, called \"virtual memory\". (I've definitely always wished that the OS could just reserve enough space for itself, but it just can't predict how many applications we'll be running).\nOn top of that, it's worth noting that regular web use now requires far more memory than it did in the past.  In activity monitor, you'll notice that every single tab & window (every open web page) is it's own process, taking up a significant chunk of memory.  On top of that, account for all the ads, movies, flash, scripts, plugins and 360 videos etc. that we expect to run smoothly.  New OS's and new web pages just use a lot of memory to provide us with the services we expect to \"just work\" (eg. syncing across devices, notifications, automatic updating etc. etc.).\nIn short, in my experience there usually isn't a single process that's suddenly taking up a huge amount of memory (although a leaky program could indeed be a culprit - Sketchup 2016 does this to me, for example).  More commonly, it's the additional functionality we expect of many programs/web plugins.\nI believe restarting the computer always alleviates this problem for a short while - primarily by unloading all the webpages and apps we had launched over time.  But if our expectation of the computer and hardware constraints stay the same (and we run the same number of processes without changing anything else), eventually we'll run into the problem again.\nTwo solutions that work for me: \n1) Open fewer tabs/pages and fewer programs at one time. Close some web-pages/programs before opening the hefty apps, such as MS Office, Parallels, 3D CAD, Adobe programs etc.\n2) Free up more space on the system hard drive (eg. move all your music and photos to another drive), to allow the system to handle your typical virtual memory needs.  For me, this means my 1TB OS drive needs >20% free space (200GB)!  Your requirements may be different.\nIf you're on an older Apple laptop or iMac or Mini, the OWC Data-Doubler is a really fantastic way to accomplish this.\nMethod (1) is my temporary fix, so that when I eventually enact method (2) I will have restored the snappy performance I expect while running many heavy-duty programs simultaneously.\n\nA: After 7 years, this question is still valid and users are facing the same issue on macOS Monterey.\nThere are many reasons why you are seeing this error and troubleshooting it no so easy. To find the real cause of these issues, you need to do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Restart your Mac (Old school method)\n\n*Reset NVRAM and PRAM\n\n*Update to latest macOS\n\n*Remove unwanted browser extensions\n\n*Close all inactive browser tabs\n\n*Switch to Microsft Edge if you are using Google Chrome\n\n*Use Activity Monitor to find out apps using the heavy resource.\n\n*Force quite unresponsive Apps\n\n*Make sure frequently used apps are up-to-date\n\n*Delete unused apps\n\n*Add more RAM\n\n*Switch to SSD (if you are using HDD)\n\n*Clear \"Other\" storage to free up the space.\n\nYou can find detailed information for each troubleshooting step at \"A Detailed Guide to Fix “Your system has run out of application memory” Error\"\n", "Q: How to eliminate specific brew doctor errors?

I now want to recover/get some files from my Time Machine backup of my previous Macbook but don't want to migrate my whole Time machine onto my new Mac. So for example I want some folders from my Documents folder of my older Mac, but not the whole folder. And some specific Apps/Programs and not all of them.\nI'm working on a Synology NAS so I don't have a backups.backupdb folder. I can open the network folder \"Time machine\" and there is my Computer name. But when opening I just find a list of files called \"ff\", \"fe\",... The main Computername folders are called computername.sparesbundle. So its not like the Machine drive & file hierarchy. Is there any other option? When trying to \"Browse Other Backup Disks\" via Time machine itself it opens the Time machine \"star wars\" but shows my current working computer instead of the Time Machine backup.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: The following worked with my Synology NAS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Browse to the network drive in Finder\n\n*Double-click on the sparse bundle file for the computer you want to access.  \n\n*Click on the \"Time Machine Backups\" disk image in Finder (added to the left-hand pane by step 2 above).\n\n*Open the backups.backupsdb folder inside this disk image.\n\n*Continue as per previous comments.\n\n\nA: Turns out I left my bitcoin wallet on my old machine...now that they coin is up to $1k again, I suddenly cared enough to dig and find my old wallet.\nHere's the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*As Tetsujin says, just open through finder. \n\n*Drag the relevant restricted folder(s) to your local desktop. \n\n*Create a user/pw that matches the old user of the time machine backup: system preferences --> users & groups --> unlock --> (+) add standard user with appropriate user name (looks at permissions of the folder if you can't remember user name) --> guess the appropriate pw\n\n*move the restricted folder to the \"new\" user, and voila, in finder you will now be able to view all files.\n\n\nAt this point you could recursively chown the restricted folder to your typical user and move it back to your home. Or you could login as this new user and access the time machine directly (didn't try this).\n\nA: Open Time Machine > backups.backupdb > [ComputerName] > Latest \nOnce in there, everything is set out just like your old Machine's drive & file hierarchy.\n\nA: I wanted to add information specific to Netgear ReadyNAS since I had the same need. I wasn't sure how to access the Time Machine sparse bundle from my Macbook at first since I wasn't connected as the right user.\nThe following worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect to your ReadyNAS via Finder. You must connect as the same ReadyNAS user that you use to the Time Machine service.

In this case, you can use port provides .\n\nThe answer also suggests to use a Linux distribution (e.g. Debian) to search for the file and choose a similar Macports port with the found Debian package name:\nHere is a search engine for Debian: search package content\nExample:\nResult for \".../sapi/embed/php_embed.h\":\nFile                                        Packages\n/usr/include/php5/sapi/embed/php_embed.h    php5-dev\n\n", "Q: iMessage unread count on Mac I use iMessage/SMS on my Mac linked from my iPhone, I have been having issues with it on my Mac lately with the unread count being incorrect.\nIt says that there is a message unread when its been read on both my phone itself and my Mac.

Whenever I install one they work fine, but the next time I open Safari, the extension is not there. So I have to reinstall them at every launch.\nI have tried to clear my Safari stuff, like plists and Library folders. Im using Safari 8.0.1.\n\nA: Is the login keychain locked or otherwise inaccessible? Apple now stores the list of installed Safari extensions in that keychain. See the link below for more details:\nDeploying & Installing Safari Extensions on Safari 6.1+ & 7.2+\n\nA: A Google search for \"Safari 8.0.1\" reveals that Apple wants developers to focus on \"extension compatibility\", meaning they probably screwed around with the way extensions are handled and ended up making this bug happen. I'd say finding a way to downgrade is the way to go.\n\nA: try running disk utility and repairing permissions on that drive.\n", "Q: How to get rid of \"You have new mail.\" in zsh I'm using zsh with prezto as my shell with iTerm as terminal app.\nI always get the message \"You have new mail\" when opening a new prompt. I don't have any new mail in Mac Mail and I don't run a mail server.\nHow can I get rid of this message?\nThanks\n\nA: So apparently some program (probably my MAMP) put an email in\n/var/mail/\n\nDeleting this message did the trick...\n\nA: In case you want to check what those mails actually are before ignoring them, you can read the mails by:\nmail\n\nand read one the emails by entering a number, e.g.:\n1\n\nand if you have fixed the problem reported by the mails (in my case, the cron jobs are failing due to renaming a folder) and feel comfortable to delete all the mails:\ndelete *\n\nthen quit the program:\nq\n\nas shown in following screenshot:\n\n\nA: Whether zsh checks for new mail can be adjusted through the MAILCHECK parameter as described in zshparam(1). It specifies the interval in seconds between checks for new mail, a zero turns off the checks completely. So just put this into your zsh configuration file:\n# don't check for new mail\nMAILCHECK=0\n\n\nA: It tells you that you have received some mails (for example, because of your configuration of cron). \nThe best way is to read this mail. Type mail: at least one mail should appear. You can read by typing its number ID. You can also directly delete it (or even multiple mails) by typing d 1-1344 (1-1344 being the range of your new mails' IDs). Leave mail with x. \n\nA: Unsetting (or even changing the value of) MAILCHECK didn't stop the message printed when I open a terminal tab/window. I eventually stumbled on an answer on superuser that enables me to still see this mail when it's convenient, but skip the constant nag message.\nIn short, create a ~/.forward file and, on a single line, the path of a file you'd like to receive mail in. Later, you can still elect to read the mail with mail -f <new_mail_file>. \nIf you have more advanced needs, it looks like forward can also specify a script by setting the line to |script_path or \"|script_path args\". I haven't tried this, but it should make it pretty simple to route messages based on the script that produced them, convert/compact them into a simple summary logline, etc.\n", "Q: How to know which Apple ID is used to lock iPad if the display is dead?

Suddenly, the device display is off, and can not be charged.\nWhen connected to a USB port on a mac, or PC, it does not get detected.\nI tried to hold Power button+Home Button for 10 seconds then releasing the Home button, but it did not work.\nI tried to put the device in Recovery Mode, DFU mode, but nothing worked. The device does not get detected by Windows or Mac.\nI toke the device to the service center I bought it from (Not an Apple Store, we don't have Apple Stores in Saudi Arabia). \nAt the service center, they have a policy not to service any iOS device if it is locked using Find My iPhone feature from iCloud.\nI told them that the feature was never turned on. They checked http://icloud.com/activationlock and entered the serial number, and found out that the device [Activation Lock : ON ]. So they asked me to login to icloud using the apple ID that was used to activate the lock and remove the device from [My Devices] in iCloud.\nI logged in to icloud.com using my nephew's apple ID, but could not see the iPad in the list of devices.\nI thought maybe the activation lock was done using another apple ID, so I tried mine, my brother's, all of the apple IDs I tried, none of them had this iPad listed among the devices in iCloud.\nNow, I can not get service for the device because they think I stole the iPad.  Although I have an invoice that proves the purchase. \nI know that revealing the apple ID might be considered a breach of security, but if I could just get the first and last letter of the email of Apple ID used to lock the device, then we can reduce our efforts in this hassle.\nMy question is: how do I know the apple ID that is used to lock the iPad knowing only the serial number of the device?\n\nA: Unfortunately, it is likely that your nephew temporarily used someone else's Apple ID in order to gain access to purchases that the other user had made.  My son did this on his device, against my rules.  If this happened, then that other person may have initiated the lock.  Since you have an invoice, proving ownership and the device is only a month old, I would encourage you to use the 1-year AppleCare that came with your device.  Here is the AppleCare contact page for Saudi Arabia.\nPlease let me know if this information is helpful for you.  Did you by chance register your device with Apple, when you made the purchase?  If so, then Apple will have a record of that action, as well.\nCheers,\nByron\n\nA: I finally resolved this issue. Here is what I did to know which account was used to lock my iPad:\n1- Go to http://www.apple.com/support/\n2- Select the device (in my case: iPad)\n3- Clicked on Contact Support\n4- Click on [Get Started]\n5- Choose the country where you live in (in my case: Saudi Arabia)\n6- Then select the problem category (in my case: Battery, Power & Chargin)\n7- A list will come up to get more details about the problem. I selected (Unable to Power on)\n8- It will optionally ask to send an email to the device (so that you click a button within the email and it will collect diagnostic information and send it to Apple for investigation), since the device is dead, you can skip this option. (click No, Thanks)\n9- Depending on the Local time, you will get various options of how you may get technical support. I did these steps at 8:00 AM on Sunday and found four options:\na) Talk to Apple Support Now (toll free number in Saudi Arabia)\n\nb) Call Apple Support Later\n\nc) Chat\n\nd) Take in for Service\n\nWhat you really want is to CHAT since you will not have to wait too much. \nNotice, I did the same steps the night before, and all I could get is option a) and d)... But the toll free number informed me that I was calling out of office hours.\nAnyways, once you click (Chat), you will be asked to input the serial number of the device.\nAfterwards, you will wait for a minute or so until a human being will be chatting with you.\nI explained my whole story to him, and he re-assured me \"no to worry\".\nHe asked me a few questions to proof that I purchased the device among which he asked me about my apple id. I answered correctly and then he found out that an iCloud account, which was created at the first run of the iPad, was linked to my apple id. \nHe asked me if I remember creating that icloud account. He provided me only with the icloud account email address, and then it all came back to my mind.\nIt turned out that the iPad is locked using the icloud account, not my apple id account...\nOf course, both accounts had the same full name, and both were linked to the same external email address, and I uploaded him a copy of my invoice and then he gave me this information. No passwords were given needless to say.\nI logged in to iCloud using the account he reminded me of, and I was able to remove the device activation lock.\nI was so happy with the way it turned out. I was so happy to the limit that I decided to share my experience with the world. \n\n", "Q: iTunes/Applescript: get all tracks from (incomplete) album I try to write an Applescript that would sort playlists by album.

The hard drive (the 500 GB, regular HDD) was replaced about a year ago (close to 10 months after purchase) following a failure.\nOne morning, after waking up and waking the computer from sleep mode I encountered a strange amount of lag.  It was bizarre because I was using the machine the night before without any problems, and now it was constantly stuttering while trying to play a movie on Netflix.  Sound would play while the video froze every few seconds.\nI restarted the computer, and the problem persisted.  Moreover, it lags no matter what I do.  iTunes can't make it through a song without freezing up 6-7 times, VLC constantly stutters too. The rainbow wheel pops up and spins any time I load a new page in Safari or Chrome, search with Spotlight, change pages in SimpleComic, change tabs in Finder, try and drag a file from one folder to another, etc.\nIt's constantly stuttering, freezing, and hanging any time I try and do just about anything.  It usually only lasts 10-20 seconds, but it happens repeatedly.  I've tried every remedy I know: restarting, repairing disk/permissions, turning off transparency, reinstalling OS X, restoring a Time Machine backup from before the problem, even clean reinstalling OS X.  Nothing seems to work, there are no error messages, and I'm really annoyed.\nI'd think it's a hardware problem, since a clean reinstall didn't work, but I ran the Apple Diagnostic Test and it found no problem.  Moreover, everything works, just with crazy lag system-wide.\nI'm wondering if anyone else has this problem, knows what it is, or if there's anything I can try that I haven't.\n--EDIT--\nAfter a few tests, I've ruled out the logic board and HDD.  I tried running the hard drive through an older Macbook, and it seemed to work alright (a little slower than normal, but it's a 2008 machine that hasn't been turned on in about a year so that's to be expected).  I also started running OS X off an external hard drive, and it runs perfectly (which is why I think the logic board is fine).\nRight now I think the issue stems from the SATA cable, which may be failing.  I've ordered a replacement and I'll update this again once I've installed it.\nThanks for all the help so far!\n\nA: It turns out that the issue here was a failing SATA cable.  It hadn't totally kicked the bucket, hence the computer could still boot and run fairly normally from the internal hard drive.  I believe the intermittent lag was caused by the faulty cable.\nThe good news is, replacing it was easy (albeit a little pricey at $40).  It's only a few more steps than removing a hard drive, and iFixit has a nice guide for anyone who has this problem.\nBe sure you know it's the SATA cable before replacing it.  I ruled out the hard drive and logic board like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hard Drive - I tested my hard drive in another Macbook.  You could also try a USB enclosure or, in a pinch, remove your optical drive and try it there.\n\n*Logic Board - I installed OS X on a USB drive and booted from it.  Performance was normal (expect it to be a little slower).\n\n\nIf you have a USB enclosure for your internal drive, you can rule these both out at once.\nThanks everyone for their comments.  I hope this helps anybody who hits a similar problem.\n\nA: try a new SSD, if you have the same problem you can return it and you'll know it's not the hard drive.\n\nA: How many of those apps do you use/keep open simultaneously? If the answer is \"a lot\", there's no way your RAM could support it.

Performance was normal (expect it to be a little slower).\n\nHow does this rule out a logic board problem? Aren't you just swapping one volume for another but still using the same logic board?\n\nA: I'm having exactly the same problem and i tried everything just like what you did. at last i brought it to apple care and it was the hard drive. it seems that our mac version is having problem with this version of osx. i replaced my Hard drive and every things runs back to normal\n\nA: On reading the first post I was screaming at you hard drive cable! (I'm here too late) as they are always the cause on these machines from 09-12 it seems they fail and the Mac runs slow or you end up not being able to access the hard drive at all and get white screen with boot options on startup with no fix other than a new cable. \nBy the way have you noticed the dimming light on the front of the Mac when it's in sleep mode does not quite go completely out like the original but rather dims to a very low level instead?

Is there a way to backup my drive? \n\nA: I see 2 alternatives, if it won't boot…\n\n\n*\n\n*Take the drive out, mount it in an external USB case, then you can back it up from any other machine that can read the drive.\n\n*If you have another Mac, mount it in Target Disk Mode\n\nIf you have two Mac computers with FireWire or Thunderbolt ports, you can connect them so that one of them appears as an external hard disk on the other. This is called “target disk mode.”\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Connect the two computers with a FireWire or Thunderbolt cable.\n  \n*Start up the computer to be used as a disk in target disk mode:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*If the computer is off, start it up while holding down the T key.\n  \n*If the computer is on, choose Apple menu > System Preferences, click Startup Disk, and then click Target Disk Mode.\nWhen the computer has started up, a disk icon appears on the desktop of the other computer.\n  \n*Transfer files by dragging them to and from the disk.\n  \n*Eject the disk by dragging its icon to the Trash.\n  While you drag, the Trash icon changes to an Eject icon.\n  \n*On the computer you used as a disk, push the power button to shut it down, and then disconnect the cable.\n\n", "Q: Uninstalled apps consume Mobile data I am asking this question on behalf of a friend. I don't own any Apple product. iPhone 6, iOS 8.1.1\n\nMy friend was so angry and he wanted to show me this picture. Two things made me laugh out loud, system services is consuming most of his mobile data, I asked about it previously.\nWhat's funnier, is that the uninstalled apps are also using mobile data, everyday! He had to upgrade his mobile data plan because system services and uninstalled apps used half of his MB. He's paying way more!\nIn fact there's a joke in my country, that the carriers are offering iPhone 6 and 6 Plus users additional 300 MB for system services and uninstalled apps to use. I think something similar is on 9GAG too!\nNow, I'm a programmer, I do apps all the time, and even I could not understand how an uninstalled app still use Internet! Those aren't apps who used to used Internet, no, those are uninstalled apps who are still today using Internet! …and everyday, the number of MB spent by uninstall apps increases!\nNotice, my friend is a WhatsApp addict, uninstalled apps are using less than half of what WhatsApp is using—system services are using way more than WhatsApp.\n\nA: Uninstalled apps do not consume data. Rather, apps which were previously installed on the device consumed data, and those apps have now been uninstalled. The total data usage of all apps which were installed on the device at one point are condensed into a single row, called Uninstalled Apps.\n", "Q: Backup mailbox of mail.app with applescript I would like to automate, with applescript, the back up a mailbox of mail, which is manually done with the menu \"Export mailbox ...\", but:\nI can not set the folder where the mailbox will be saved;\nI can not set the mailbox to export, it works only with the mailbox that I've previously selected manually with the following command: Click menu item...\nThe lines of the script, which does not work, are:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n  --set mboxSavePath to \"HD Macintosh:Users:simonepiersigilli:Desktop:e-mail:\" -incorrect command to set the save path-\n  --set mboxSavePath to \"/Users/simonepiersigilli/Desktop/e-mail/\" -incorrect command to set the save path-\n  --set path POSIX to mboxSavePath -incorrect command to set the save path-\nend tell\ntell application \"Mail\" to activate\ntell application \"System Events\"\n  tell process \"Mail\"\n  --click menu item \"cesare@appuntidigitali.eu\" of menu \"Entrata\" of menu \"Caselle\" of menu bar 2 -wrong command to set the mailbox to export-\n  click menu item \"Esporta casella di posta…\" of menu \"Casella\" of menu bar 1 -correct command to open the menu \"Export mailbox ...\"-\n  -- Now click the Go (choose) button\n  click button \"Scegli\" of sheet of front window -correct command to click the button choose-\n  tell application \"Mail\" to close the front window\n  end tell\nend tell\n\n**UPDATE****\nThe intention is for the script to be run every week and it will have to backup the following inbox and sent mailboxes highlighted in red.\n\n\nA: GUI scripting is not that great.

How do I do this without creating a different Apple ID for both? They are both mine - but I want to be able to communicate between the two.  Is this possible?  Thanks. Theresa  \n\nA: hmmm… initially I thought this couldn't be done, however.\nFrom messages, start a new conversation, from the top right icon. Start typing your own name until you can select your iMessage-capable account, accept then type the message.\nSend.\nA few seconds later the message will arrive on both devices & you can then converse with 'yourself' - though it will all appear in both columns, as though you were actually talking to 'yourself'.\nLooks odd - but it works.\nTested initiating on both iPhone & Mac. Both work.\niPhone seems to generate multiple conversations for some reason, but the Mac keeps it inline.\nMinor inconvenience, I'd say, for the benefits of being able to talk to yourself ;-)\n", "Q: Is it possible to map doubleclick on folders in Finder List View to Expand/Collapse triangle? I really hate all these windows cluttering the desktop, and spring-loading isn't a big help. So to have a more Windows-Exploreresque view, I try to use the collapse/expand triangles in List view only, to be able to sort my files properly in the folder hierarchy.\nI installed XtraFinder to use Return for opening files (please raise your hands if you like cmd-o to do that) and Navigating back via Backspace. But my motor skills are very hard set on doubleclicking folders or hitting enter to expand them.\nIs there any way, to never \"open\" folders in new windows/same window, but to toggle collapse/expand always instead?\n\nA: I'm raising my hand…  \n Return ⏎  or  Enter ⌅    is to rename,  Cmd ⌘    O   or double-click is to launch or open.\nThe Finder is the most beautifully key-commandable environment. Just look at what you can do…\nOS X: Keyboard shortcuts (Finder is towards the bottom)\nVery simply, in List view  →  &  ←   will open & close the current folder, add the  Option ⌥  key to recursively open/close all folders in that folder simultaneously.\n Cmd ⌘    [   or   ]  will go to the previous or next folder...\n", "Q: Turn on a iOS hotspot without 3G connection Is it possible to turn on my hotspot on my iPhone 5s (running iOS 8) without wifi or 3G connection?\nI would like people to connect to my network to play LAN games while overseas. However, I do not want to turn on my 3G so as to save money from the data charges. Is there any way to turn on your hotspot while your 3G/4G is off without jailbreaking?\n\nA: In short, No.\nThe iPhone's hotspot only works with your carrier, 3G, 4G etc, it doesn't operate over Wifi.\nI've never Jailbroken, so I don't know if that would help.\n", "Q: Boot Camp restarted back to OS X instead of Windows I just tried to install BootCamp for Windows 8.1 on my new retina MacBook Pro and it was making the USB stick for like 1 hour then it partitioned the disc and after that, when it should restart to install menu, it automatically restarted back to OS X. So now my disk is split but I can’t run the installation since it has automatically booted into OS X. Any solutions?\n\nA: go into system preferences, choose startup disk and select your windows partition, then restart.\n", "Q: How to add iPhone to my product list if it's already registered to another apple ID? How to add my telephone serial number, if it's already registered on another ID? I got this phone in exchange for my broken previous one in tech. service, so I think that it was used by someone and registered early.\n\nA: As far as I know, an iPhone is linked to an Apple ID until it is released by the owner or by Apple techs (like when your phone is traded for a new one, rather than being repaired and returned to you). \nThis is intended to prevent theft; you can't just take someone's phone because they have to release it from their Apple ID first. If they don't, the phone will be very trackable by the owner of that Apple ID, the phone can't be reset without the owner's Apple ID & Password, and you can't get any new apps or anything because you won't have the Apple ID & password to enter for a purchase or to enter in order to remove the Apple ID from the phone.\nIf you got this phone legitimately, you'll have to contact the \"tech. service\" you used and ask them what they'll do to fix the issue. They may be able to take it back, and, as an authorized Apple repair center, send it to Apple to have the Apple ID cleared. I'm not sure they would or could do that.\nThere's nothing a user can do to release a phone without the original Apple ID & password, and this is intentional. If Apple set up 'online support' and allowed any user to release any phone from the Apple ID associated with it, then it would be much easier to steal and sell iPhones.\n...again, as far as I know... ;)\n", "Q: How to mirror MacBook Pro screen to Apple TV? I have a MacBook Pro with OS X 10.9.5 and I would like to mirror its screen to an Apple TV via AirPlay. Is it possible? And if yes, how can I do it?\n\nA: If your MBP is early 2011 or newer and there's an Apple TV on the same wifi network as you, you should see an icon that looks like a TV in the menu bar. Click it and you'll get a dropdown menu listing all the available Apple TVs (in case there's more than one). Click yours and you should be good to go!\nIf your MBP is older than early 2011, you'll need a third-party utility of some sort. If you're willing to shell out $15, I've heard great things about AirParrot.\n", "Q: Using TV as monitor for Macbook Pro while running Boot Camp I have a mid-2010 MacBook Pro (has Thunderbolt port) and I would like to use a TV as my monitor. I understand this is possible if you are running OS X but what about Windows?\n\nA: Apple provides Windows drivers (via Boot Camp) for all aspects of the hardware it is running on, so yes you can.\nYou'll need a TV with an HDMI input, a Thunderbolt to HDMI adapter and an HDMI cable. After that the Mac, regardless of whether it is running Mac O/S or Windows will see the monitor as a display device and should be able to detect the optimum resolution, allowing you to use it as a monitor.\nNote that some HDTVs don't have great definition and displaying the Mac or Windows desktop and apps might result in a blurry result. Only one way to know though, give it a try.\n", "Q: For 2.4GHz/5GHz wifi which is best for Apple devices: different SSIDs or same? My WiFi router, a Netgear Nighthawk, can do 2.4GHz and 5GHz; and it can have the same SSID or different for those ranges.\nWe run MacBooks, an iPad, an iPad Nano and an iPhone 4 on the network. Does it make sense to have both ranges on one SSID and let the devices pick the right frequency or keep them separate?\n\nA: I have a similar set up (not same router).\nWhile using the same SSID, I noticed instability, probably due to randomness  of who gets what.\nSo now I have separate SSID for 2.4 and 5 GHz and I decide who connects to what.\n\nA: Either way, the devices will not necessarily pick the strongest signal, they tend to hang onto the one they're on til they lose it completely. \nAt least with separate SSIDs you can look at which it's attached to currently & force it over if necessary.\nRequires 2 sign-ins initially, but after that it will either look after itself, or you can manually check & swap over.\n", "Q: Root Device UUID Error while installing Mountain Lion on VirtualBox 4.3 While installing Mountain Lion on VirtualBox, it starts booting, then stops at the line \"root device uuid: xxxx-xxxxx-xxxx\". I've allocated all the required RAM and memory, but even after looking online and fiddling with my settings I still can't get it to work. Any thoughts on how to fix it?\n\nA: I ran into this problem recently while attempting to install a Mountain Lion VM on my Mac Pro (10.10) using VirtualBox 4.3.2.  I was trying to follow the instructions here, but I got stuck in the EFI boot sequence.  I attached a screenshot, but I think its where you got stuck too.\n\nI tried the same process on my macbook pro laptop (with the same iso), and it worked fine.\nI fiddled with it for a while and found a solution.  If you follow those same instructions, but before you start the VM remove everything except CD/DVD from the boot order, it properly boots to the installer and you can continue with the process.\nForgive VM name typo\n\nMake sure you restore the boot order before it restarts.\n\nA: Uncheck enabled EFI and Clock hardware\n", "Q: News channels on ITunes Radio? On iTunes radio I have been unable to find any new news channels with the exception of public radio in every city.\nAre there any other news stations on iTunes Radio?\n\nA: In iTunes you should have two options for listing to radio stations.\n1) Internet stations (available in all Countries) - see the \"Internet\" tap under Music, where you should be able to find live stations with or without news.\n2) Radio (not available in all Countries) - see the \"Radio\" tab under Music, this will only offer music streaming from a standard radio setup (possible to setup with your own music taste).\n\nA: In iTunes Radio or now Apple Music you can search for your local NPR station by call sign (not all are available). Or check out the main NPR station:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/station/npr-news-and-culture/idra.840950253\n", "Q: How to hide an app from the Launchpad? Is there any way to hide an app from the Launchpad in Yosemite?\nI don't want to delete it or something like that I just want to hide apps that I don't use frequently, and I have a lot of them, putting them in a folder that I ignore makes the Launchpad slow to process, any solution to get rid of them without deleting them?\n\nA: If you feel that your Launchpad is filled with apps, you can make folders in Launchpad by moving a app over another app.\nHow to do this shown at wikihow, this is done in Mac OS X Lion, but will work in Yosemite.\nWhat the content of link describes is how to make folders in Launchpad, this is easily done by moving an app (inside Launchpad) over another app. This will make a folder with both apps in it.\n\nA: Prepending a dot (.) will make the folder or file became hidden. You can do it using Finder or shell. Just change the app name, prepending a dot. To unhide the app, just remove the dot. Note that Launchpad will take some time to see the changes. If it doesn't work, try to reboot.\nTip: in Finder, you can toggle to see hidden files using keyboard shortcut CMD + SHIFT + .\nUsing shell:\ncd /Applications\nsudo mv YourApp.app .YourApp.app\n\nAs you may know, mv command takes 2 parameters: from and to.\nTo unhide is similar:\ncd /Applications\nsudo mv .YourApp.app YourApp.app\n\n\nA: Just Move them out of the Applications Folder.

So, please guide me what should I do? How I can do a package from a SIM to use internet however or does not allow to call any number from iPad?\n\nA: If you have an iPhone too, and both your iPad and iPhone are running iOS 8, then you can make phone calls from your iPad, which then uses your iPhone to make call from.\n\nPhone calls\nWith Continuity, you can make and receive cellular phone calls from your iPad, iPod touch, or Mac when your iPhone is on the same Wi-Fi network.\nTo make and receive phone calls, here's what you need:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Sign in to the same iCloud account on all your devices, including your Mac.\n  \n*Your iPhone and your iPad or iPod touch need to use iOS 8 or later. Your Mac needs to use OS X Yosemite.\n  \n*All devices must be on the same Wi-Fi network.\n  \n*All devices must be signed in to FaceTime using the same iCloud account. This means any device that shares your Apple ID will get your phone calls. Look below for instructions on how to turn off iPhone cellular calls.\n  \n*Wi-Fi Calling needs to be off. Go to Settings > Phone. If you see Wi-Fi Calling, turn it off.\n  \n\nhttp://support.apple.com/en-us/HT6337\n\nA: An iPad is not a telephone.  \nIt can be done with 3rd party solutions like Skype or Viber, but not natively.\nBy default it is capable of data over cellular, but not standard voice calls.\n\nA: iPad is not meant for making calls. The usage of sim card on iPad is for internet usage through 3G or LTE. That is the only reason for the existence of a cellular version of the iPad.\nIf you wanted to make calls from a tablet, you should've gone in the Android route or just bought an iPhone.\n\nA: I see no problem here.... calls are calls whether VoIP or cellular. If you want to make calls with your iPad there are many apps out there to let you call any landline or mobile. Skype and Hangouts are 2 examples. It's a bit like asking if your car will run with Michelin or Pirelli tyres..... and if you are so insistent on making that cellular call. There is a pretty good device available for this.... a cellphone. \n", "Q: Does iOS have a built-in RSS reader? Do any iOS versions come with a built-in RSS reader?\n\nA: Sort of... you can go into Safari, choose a website, then click the bookmark icon, select the @ tab, click Subscriptions and then click Add Current Site. \nOtherwise Reeder for IOS is a great RSS reader. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder-2/id697846300?ls=1&mt=8\n\nA: You could use Reading List on Safari. It's syncs automatically between all your iDevices. Reading List feature has been available on iOS since the launch of iOS 7. Some apps like TweetBot allow you to directly send links to the Reading List which you can catch up later.\n", "Q: Time Machine Strategy? I just finished a tough weekend of getting my Mac back. \nFor whatever reason, it would no longer boot. I am running 10.6.8 on a 2010 MacPro.\nI installed a new copy of the OS, and migrated, then updated the OS, and it froze. Back to the install disks, loaded, updated OS first via software update, then migrated and I'm back in action. \nThe migration took hours as the drive had a lot of data including large iTunes files, etc. 3TB drive is my main drive. \nIs there a better strategy for one's OS drive and data files that would make a re-build less time consuming? e.g. Use the OS drive, and keep it smaller, say 1TB, just for the OS and apps, and then a second drive for data only? \nI'm grateful Time Machine worked so well, just looking for a faster way to get going next time. \n(Note - I have too many apps needing Rosetta to jump to 10.10 full time. Not ready to drop $hundreds on updated software.)\n\nA: If you have a 3tb drive would you not partition it? 1tb would be HUGE for OS and apps, I can't imagine the number of apps you'd need to fill that much space. Do remember though, that you'd still need to backup your data (SuperDuper and Carbon Copy Cloner are sometimes more useful for data backup). As you have a MacPro then dropping a new, smaller boot drive in should be very simple and then you could use your 3tb drive just for data (iTunes etc). You might also think of a smallish ssd as a main boot drive (even 128gb is probably fine for all the OS and Apps you'd throw at it). This would boot very fast and apps also load a lot faster.\n", "Q: Completely new Time Machine backup? I made use of Time Machine to restore my Mac's OS and data to a new drive after the old one failed. Time Machine doesn't seem to recognize that the new drive and the back ups are related. Is there a method to connect the two, or do I need to wipe that drive containing the old history, and just start a new TM backup? \n\nA: The Time Machine backups became disassociated with the new drive because of the change to the UUID of the new drive. With a little usage of tmutil in Terminal following the directions here, you can rebuild the association of the Time Machine backups to the new drive.\n", "Q: FaceTime window jumps to unwanted position at start of call Running FaceTime 3.0 on MacOSX 10.10.1, there's an annoying behavior that I can't seem to change:\nWhen I first get an incoming call, the FaceTime window jumps to the far right of my rightmost display (an external 30\" Cinema display), and can't be repositioned until the call is fully connected (at which point I need to move it more than a yard to the left to center it with the camera in the MacBook Pro).\nWhy can't the window just stay where I put it?\n\nA: Similar problem with FT audio. It goes to the upper right too and ends up covering my apps. Easy to move yes, but then it's not on top anymore and I have to dig around for it to end the call.\nI poached this AppleScript and tied it to an Alfred Workflow\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"FaceTime\"\ntell application \"FaceTime\" to activate\ntell front window to set position to {950, 696}\nend tell\n\nYou could make your own trigger with normal script.

My trackpad still works though.  \nIs there a way to login if nothing on my internal keyboard works.  Please note, the answer can't be some sort of reset for which I need to push any keys - I have tried these, and they don't work, because the keyboard doesn't work.  \nThanks!!  \n\nA: You can't setup Bluetooth devices without logging in, USB keyboard is the only way to go.

I just bought a used MacBook and I want to wipe it clean to start fresh. It didn't come up a DVD or anything.\nI tried following another post on here that said to push Option on start up and it sounded like it could do a fresh install using an internet connection. However when I did it the only icon I got was the hard drive in the laptop.\nIt looks like you can purchase the DVD on the apple website (http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC573/mac-os-x-106-snow-leopard) though here it looks like it offers a free upgrade to http://www.apple.com/osx/how-to-upgrade/ 10.10.1\nBut it's not clear if that applies to me since I'm not the original owner.

This keeps happening, and the CD can't be accessed.\nI'm totally new to the Mac environment and workflow, so excuse me if the answer is fairly simple.\n\nA: Sounds like the CD drive is malfunctioning. This could be caused by many different problems, from partially detached cables inside the laptop to just a dirty CD slot and/or laser lens. One simple weird trick is to take a can of compressed air and give the CD slot a blow-out when not loaded with a disc. \nThere are CD laser lens cleaning discs, including this version with a 3.5\" floppy disc cleaner included!\n", "Q: Is it possible to backup iOS devices to an external drive? I have a new Mac Pro with a small 256GB SSD. I have a larger 2TB drive that I run backups to.\nMy girlfriend has a MacBook Air with a tiny 128GB SSD.\nOur problem is our iPhones have 50GB of music, pictures and apps, so backing them up on iTunes on our boot drives would be a suicide. Right now I have an old Mac Pro with plenty of disk space I use for my iPhone but I would like to use my primary computer.\nWhats the best way to have everything with iTunes/iPhoto just go to an external drive? And is it possible for both of us use the same set of drives? Could we just use an Apple Time Capsule for both of our machines? And then couldn't we just figure out how to make iTunes and iPhoto to look for that network drive to work?\n\nA: If I understand correctly, you want to backup your iOS devices to a drive other than your Mac's (because they have small SSDs). It is possible to backup multiple Macs to a single Time Capsule. \nSadly though, it seems that Time Capsule doesn't support backing up iOS devices (yet. I really do hope this becomes an option soon, and I'm not the only one). Here are ways you can make sure those 50GB in your iPhones don't end up in your Mac's SSDs though.\nPhotos\nIn terms of pictures, iOS8 should have you backed up with iCloud Photo Library. If enabled, all your pictures and video will automatically be stored in iCloud, which gives you 5GB of free storage (or 20GB for $1/mo, 200GB for $4/mo). \nIf that is not your jazz though, you can always sync to iPhoto, but move the iPhoto library to an external hard drive. iPhoto stores all your photos a single archive, the iPhoto Library on your Pictures folder, which you can move as you please. When iPhoto opens, it will automatically look for the iPhoto Library where it last saw it, but if it can't find it it will ask you were it is, and keep working as if nothing had happened.\nBackups\niTunes backups might be a little more tricky, but it seems to be possible to move the folder where iTunes stores its backups to an external hard drive, and then trick iTunes into backing up there.\nI haven't tried doing this myself, but here's a post that claims you can do it and outlines the steps to follow, both for Windows and OSX. The instructions for OSX aren't too bad, as long as you aren't too scared of using the Terminal application (Applications/Utilities/Terminal). In a nutshell:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/ to a new location,\nsay /Volumes/~Your External HDD~/MobileSync. This directory has a\nfolder called Backups, which is where iTunes stores backups for\nmobile devices.\n\n\n*\n\n*Note 1: ~/ is an alias computers use for your home folder.\n\n*Note 2: Your ~/Library folder is hidden by default. You can open it in Finder by opening Terminal typing in open ~/Library.\n\n\n*Remove/rename ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup. We won't need it anymore.\n\n*Create a symbolic link to the new location for Backups in your external hard drive. This is basically like an alias in the old location of Backups to its new location. To do so open Terminal and type in\nln -s /Volumes/**~Your External HDD~**/MobileSync/Backup ~/Library/Application\\ Support/MobileSync/Backup\n\nIf you launch iTunes now it should follow the symbolic link and go on with business as usual, not knowing that in fact it's now working with a folder that's on an external hard drive. \nYou'll need to have the hard drive connected to backup, \nHope it helps!\n", "Q: Upload pics to iCloud from old iPhone not primary iPhone I purchased an iPhone 5S and it was turned on at time of purchase.  However, I did not completely back up all photos to iCloud from old iPhone 4.  I cannot get the iPhone 4 photos to upload to iCloud in order to put them on new laptop.   Help\n\nA: Transfer them directly to the laptop, using iPhoto [Mac] or Photo Gallery [Win]\n", "Q: SSD w/ brand new clean in stall of Yosemite fails to boot I've just installed a new version of Yosemite on a third party SSD (Crucial). When I boot it up it hangs on a gray screen.\nSteps that got me here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect SSD to Macbook Pro (with existing HD) using USB2\n\n*Install Yosemite onto SSD while connected to MBP\n\n*Complete installation (at this point, I'm up and running with a\nworking Yosemite running on the external SSD)\n\n*Install SSD into internal port\n\n*Boot MBP\n\n*Immediately hangs on gray screen\n\n\nI've read about issues with Trim and Yosemite, but to my knowledge I've never enabled or installed Trim on this SSD.\nThe Option key and Command-R are both non-responsive during startup.\n\nA: You are most likely suffering from a bad SATA cable. This is a very common issue with any MBP so far, and often presents itself when someone decides to swap out their drive.\nYou can check this by plugging in both the SSD and an external boot medium and then booting up with option key pressed. If you can see the external medium after some time but not the SSD, your SATA cable is most likely broken. \nThis is the thin black cable going to your motherboard from the SATA plug. It's pretty cheap to buy and can be installed really easy. It is screwed down to the chassis so you will have to unscrew it before you can replace it.\nAddition to my post: TRIM has nothing to do with this. Neither does Yosemite :) TRIM is a garbage collection technology (or: a ATA command to initiate GC on a specific part). Modern SSD's work fine with or without it. The difference is that TRIM can be used by the operating system to direct some specific garbage collection. This is separate from the SSD controller's own garbage collection scheme. You do not need TRIM, you should not install a \"TRIM Enabler\" as they work (since Yosemite) by disabling kext signatures and blindly modifying some code and/or a plist for a kernel extension. Some newer enablers use local kext signing as an immediate solution. You will however not have any noticeable performance difference, but you will have a system that's been messed with. The only thing you have to make sure is that you don't have your SSD completely filled 99% of the time as this limits the SSD's ability to maintain itself properly in some cases.\n\nA: I would recommend you reinstall 10.10 on to the USB drive using following process.\nFirst restore your system with the old HD and OS to be able to do this:\nConnect to your Mac a properly formatted 8GB (or larger) drive, and rename the drive Untitled. \n(The Terminal command used here assumes the drive is named Untitled.) \nAlso, make sure the Yosemite installer, called Install OS X Yosemite.app, is in its default location in your main Applications folder (/Applications). This means that if you moved it before installing Yosemite, you need to move it back before making your installer disk.\nSelect the text of this Terminal command and copy it:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app --nointeraction\n\nWarning: This step will erase the destination drive or partition, so make sure that it doesn’t contain any valuable data. Paste the copied command into Terminal and press Return.\nType your admin-level account password when prompted, and then press Return.\nWait until you see the text Copy Complete, which could take as long as 20 or 30 minutes, depending on how fast your Mac can copy data to your destination drive.\n", "Q: Network topology: Internet connected on a leaf node? Before I go ahead and spend money on new kit, I'd like to run by you my proposed network setup to see if it's feasible:\nCable Modem <--> Airport Express <--> Airport Extreme\n(bridge mode)                          |\n                                       +------> Clients\n                                       +------> Another Airport Express ----> Clients\n\nThe Expresses extend the wireless network from the Extreme.\nThe reason for connecting the Cable Modem to the Express is because of it's location in the house.  The Extreme is centrally located, and does a good job today, but I'm moving from ADSL to Cable, and that will be connected on the edge of the house rather than to the Extreme like it currently is.\na) Would this topology work?  Would the Extreme route traffic through the Express to the internet?\nb) Are there any problems in this approach that you can envision?\n\nA: I don't see any issue with this as long as both the Extreme and the second Express are run in Bridge mode extending the current network provided from the first Express. Whether that is possible will depend on what kind of signal each receives.\n", "Q: Schedule a Mac to sleep, just one time Is it possible to schedule a Mac to sleep just one time? I know I can set a schedule for it, but I want to have control over it.\nSo occasionally I'll go to bed but leave a file transferring, and I want the Mac to sleep about an hour from now. So how would I go about doing that, without setting a long-term schedule?\n\nA: By default there is no way of doing that with the options you have in the system preferences.\n\nBut, you could do it from command line with a simple command:\nsleep 10; osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to sleep'\n\n\n\n*\n\n*sleep 10 pause the execution of the following command for 10 seconds. If you want minutes or hours you must change 10 with number of seconds you want.\n\n*osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to sleep' put the computer to sleep.\n\n\nA: The pmset terminal command should do what you want.  The following will put the computer to sleep at 23:45:00 on December 2, 2014.  The command must be run from an administrator account though:\nsudo pmset schedule sleep \"12/02/14 23:45:00\"\n\nThe MM/DD/YY date format cannot be changed; so, if you are used to a different format, use caution.\nIf you do this on a regular basis, you can write a function and save it to your ~/.profile:\n# Schedule sleep in X minutes, use like: sleep-in 60\nfunction sleep-in() {\n  local minutes=$1\n  local datetime=`date -v+${minutes}M +\"%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S\"`\n  sudo pmset schedule sleep \"$datetime\"\n}\n\n\nA: Try man shutdown; it has an -s option for sleep-mode\nshutdown -s <time>\n\nwhere <time> can be:\n\n*\n\n*now\n\n*+m e.g. +180 for 3 hours from now\n\n*yymmddhhmm e.g. 2112250000 for the moment it becomes Christmas (this year)\n\n\nA: For power control of your Mac from your iPhone on a local network, I have used Off Remote which can also schedule within the next 24 hours a system action (Shutdown, Lock, Restart, Log off, Sleep) and is only $3 in the iOS store but requires installation of an additional helper app on your Mac to receive the instructions from the iPhone app.\nAnother answer here suggested using Power Manager software which costs $50, but I would suggest the $36 Keyboard Maestro software which is a bit less intuitive than Power Manager but has greater flexibility beyond power management.  In searching for the ability to schedule my Mac to sleep, I remembered that I have this utility and was able to quickly drag and drop the macro components in KM to create a script that paused for a set period of time and then put my Mac to sleep:\n\n…there is also an action within Keyboard Maestro to also schedule macros (to put Mac to sleep, shutdown, restart, etc.) to be triggered at designated times:\n\nKeyboard Maestro is cheaper and much more robust for developing macros that can enhance the use of your Mac, but there is a bit more of a learning curve than the Power Manager application.\n\nA: All the above answers work, but if you want to do this regularly, I recommend the Power Manager software, which allows you to set custom sleep times, both for one time and recurring events very easily (far more easily than using Terminal commands, in my opinion).  The software is relatively expensive ($50), but there is a free 30 day trial with all features.  You can also control Power Manager from your iPhone, which is nice if you are away from your computer but want to set it to sleep or shut down.\n", "Q: How to differentiate between applications with the same name in applescripts I'm trying to use tell application \"Google Chrome\" in order to script the OS X Chrome app, but this keeps being interpreted as referring to a virtual application with the same name which refers to the windows \"Google Chrome\" inside a parallels desktop virtual machine. (Parallels Desktop automatically creates dummy OS X applications corresponding to all of the windows programs, so that they can appear running in the OS X dock etc.)\nHow could I differentiate between applications of the same name in such tell statements, based on the application path or some other attribute?\n\nA: You can use direct path to the application inside Your Apple Script.\nThis will looke like:\nset p to \"/Applications/Safari.app\"\ntell application p to activate\n\nHere's the link about AppleScript and POSIX paths\n\nA: When you type tell application \"whatever\" and you click compile, if whatever does not exists, it will appear a window that let you choose the application.

It's reverted to the standard script icon (see screenshot).\n\nHow do I export my script as an app without losing my custom icon?\nIf not possible: are there other ways to sign an Apple Script application bundle on OS X 10.10? This would allow me to do a manual icon replacement and sign the bundle afterwards.\nImportant twist: Replacing the applet.icns file afterwards is not an option, as the bundle won't pass signature validation anymore. In short, users get a damaged app error when launching the app, unless they have lowered their OS X security.\n\nA: You can force codesign after You change bundle content. In Terminal.app use something like this:\n codesign -f -s [identity] /path/to/bundle\n\nFor more info please read man codesign.\n", "Q: Will a Microsoft Office Add-In developed in Visual Studio work for both a Windows and Mac ( osx ) versions of Ms Office?

Sometimes I would like to download the PDF file, but doing so is annoyingly difficult: right-clicking on the PDF brings up a contextual menu that does not have an option to download the PDF — it only includes an option to open the file in another application (Adobe Acrobat, in my case):\n\nIt would be convenient to have an option in this menu to save the file to disk. As it is, I have to open the PDF in Acrobat (using the option in that menu) and then save the file from within Acrobat.  This works, but takes time, requires switching applications, and quickly gets old when viewing a lot of PDFs. Now, the curious thing is that for other embedded object types such as images, the Safari contextual menu does have a save-to-disk option.  What is puzzling me, therefore, is why there is no \"Save PDF as ...\" option or its equivalent in the contextual menu for PDF files.\nSo, is there a way to get a similar save-to-disk option for PDFs? Is it normally there, and have I done something at some point to disable it?  Or is it truly never an option for PDFs?\nObligatory system info: OSX 10.9.5, Safari 7.1, MBPR.\nAdditional clarification: Acrobat offers a plug-in for Safari that has different menus and options.  I prefer Safari's native PDF support to the Acrobat plug-in, and disabled the plug-in long ago for that reason.  So, to be clear: this question is specifically about the menus offered by Safari's PDF facility, not the Acrobat plug-in.\n\nA: You have a couple of options. \nIf you move the mouse to the bottom-center of the screen it will appear a menu where you have an option to save to disk. See image below.\n\nAdditionally, you use Print option, and there is an option in the bottom-left of that menu called PDF that you can use to save the document.\n\n", "Q: Can I access a voice memo file that's attached to an email stuck in my iPhone's outbox?

I have a jailbroken iPhone 4 running on iOS 7.1.1. I checked Cydia and updated a few tweaks and since that update, my tweak called \"f.lux\" wasn't working so I deleted it. After deleting it, I would swipe to unlock my home screen but my phone would just shut off and restart. Restoring it in iTunes didn't work and errors would always pop up. I tried using TinyUmbrella and it didn't work. I also tried downloading an ipsw file but that doesn't seem to work either. Do I just need to buy a new phone or is there a way of fixing it?\n\nA: It’s not possible to do that without iTunes.\nIf you have a PC or Mac with iTunes installed, you can bring the device in DFU mode by performing the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the iPhone to your computer\n\n*Press and hold the Home button and the Sleep button at the same time\n\n*After 10 seconds, release the Sleep button\n\n*Continue holding the Home button until this iTunes message shows up: \"iTunes has detected an iPhone in recovery mode.

The problem is the copy with mouse does not go to the end of the line because this line is huge.

This shows between the first real line and the second real line.\n\nA: You can use a little trick: save that long line to a temp file and copy that.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the desired portion of the line by moving the cursor to the first good position. By pressing v f [character], you select everything from that position to the next occurence of [character]. Pressing v $ would select to the end of that line.

I then disconnected my external screen and tried my MacBook pro's build in screen. After working with that for an hour it also started to show glitches. These did not go away after opening and closing the lid.\nBecoming more and more annoyed I decided to reset the PRAM, and low and behold, it didn't work. So I went on with resetting the SMC. This is when the real problems started. My MacBook pro now booted up into a grey screen after loading for a bit. \nUsing Single-User mode I tried repairing the SSD with fsck -fy, this didn't help. Slowly I had to come to the conclusion that it most likely was a dedicated GPU hardware failure. \nThen, suddenly my MacBook pro decided that it would want to boot up in Safe Mode, however, after a few minutes vertical and horizontal lines showed up again.\nSo, I decided to turn off the dedicated GPU by moving the kernel extensions into another folder. This worked but made everything very slow. After putting everything back, I decided to follow the following instructions:\nhttp://www.asyncro.com/2014/03/24/macbook-pro-discreate-graphics-card-issue-fix-updated/\nHaving followed every instruction, including letting my MacBook overheat, my notebook was still slow. \nNow, here is the thing, after putting all kernel extensions back into place and restoring everything back to normal, the notebook suddenly started normally at full speed using the dedicated graphics card.\nUntil now I have not experienced any problems (few hours later). At first I thought that it might be because of the gfxCardStatus software, so I deleted that in order to replicate the problem. However, my MacBook is still running fine now and I seem not to be able to replicate the problem.\nMy Question\n\n\n*\n\n*Can it be that all my problems were caused by a badly behaving SMC and that there is nothing wrong with the dedicated GPU?\n\n\nA: No, you most likely have the very same common GPU issue. Seeing the glitches multiple times is a sure tell sign.\nBeneath all that drama caused by resetting and tweaking things, temperature variations on the GPU contacts were what caused the glitches and the inconsistent behaviors. Your laptop is probably in the initial phase of GPU(soldering) failure. Sooner or later the problem worsens and more severe graphic glitches will appear or the computer simply becomes unbootable.\nYou can try the simple steps below to stress-test the GPU, but by doing so you could be accelerating the problem and end up in an unusable state sooner. You can decide if it's in your interest to forcefully trigger the problem. Regardless, these steps are not beyond any normal operating parameters, so if your laptop is immune from the GPU problem you are not doing anything harmful by performing these steps, warranty-wise especially.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a temperature & fan speed monitoring app like iStat Menus that can show you fan speeds, CPU and GPU temperatures in real time.\n\n*Run a GPU benchmark app to stress the GPU. Valley or Heaven should work, for free. Keep running/looping so the GPU temperature stays around 70'C or higher, for as long as possible (hours).\n\n*You should pause the benchmark app periodically for the temperature to drop down (back to 45~50'C range). Or just turn it off at nights. Repeat the heating/cooling process until the symptoms appear.\nThis test might end up proving nothing, and yet it doesn't mean the GPU is trouble-free. It takes time and many temperature cycles for the solder joint problem to become apparent.\n\nA: Apple has launched MacBook Pro Repair Extension Program for Video Issues which can be found here\n\nApple has determined that a small percentage of MacBook Pro systems may exhibit distorted video, no video, or unexpected system restarts.

One for numbers to subtract, the other for the running total.\nAdd another column for numbers to add if desired.\nIn the example below, the starting number is in cell reference B2 and the number to subtract from it is in cell reference A3.  Cell B3 enter this formula: =B2 - A3 then, click and drag the yellow dot (shown in the illustration) to autofill the formula down into the cells below.  Numbers will update the cell references automatically.  \nOf course, this can be improved upon but this is the basic formula to answer the OP's question.\n\n", "Q: How can I boot an Intel Core i7 iMac in 64-bit mode? I have an iMac running OS X 10.6.8. The processor is a 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7 and the machine has 4 GB of RAM. How can I boot the computer in 64-bit mode (instead of 32-bit mode) so that I can upgrade to OS X 10.9 and run Final Cut Pro 10.3?\n\nA: To start up with a special kernel check this from Apple: Starting up with the 32-bit or 64-bit kernel in 10.6 and later:\n\nStartup key combination (for current startup only)\nIf your Mac uses the 32-bit kernel by default, but supports the 64-bit\n  kernel, you can start up using the 64-bit kernel by holding the\n  6 and 4 keys during startup.\nIf your Mac uses the 64-bit kernel by default, you can start up with\n  the 32-bit kernel by holding the 3 and 2 keys\n  during startup.\nYour Mac will revert to the default kernel the next time you reboot\n  it.\nOn-disk setting (persistent)\nTo select the 64-bit kernel for the current startup disk, use the\n  following command in Terminal:\nsudo systemsetup -setkernelbootarchitecture x86_64\nTo select the 32-bit kernel for the current startup disk, use the\n  following command in Terminal:\nsudo systemsetup -setkernelbootarchitecture i386\nNote: This setting is stored in the\n  /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist file\n  and will take effect every time you start up from this disk. If you\n  start up from a different disk, the setting on that disk, or the\n  hardware default, will take effect.\n\nTo determine your currently running kernel open Terminal.app and enter:\nuname -a\nRunning with the 64-bit kernel, the output will end with RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64. Running with the 32-bit kernel, the output will end with RELEASE_I386 i386.\nIn your case you just have to update to Mavericks (Mac OS X 10.9). Mavericks doesn't contain a 32-bit kernel anymore and since your i7-processor is 64-bit, everything just works right out of the box without key strokes or modifying com.apple.Boot.plist.\n", "Q: How to create dual content display with Apple TV and iPad/iPhone? We've been looking into using the Google Chromecast with a custom receiver to allow a user to use an app on iOS, Mac, or PC (node-webkit is used for Mac and PC) and then show different content on the TV with the Chromecast to what is being displayed on their device. So that we can do stuff like reports, status boards, etc.\nWe'd like to also support the Apple TV... but I've not seen anything on the Apple Developer site regarding displaying HTML content other than just video and audio or mirroring the entire screen of the iPad or iPhone. We'd want dual content.\nI have seen screenshots on the Apple website showing games that have different content on the the device to what is displayed on the screen.\n\nCan anyone offer advice? As it looks like it's possible... but the resources and information on this are difficult to find.\n\nA: Well, What you see in the image is simple - It's a controller for the free game called MetalStorm.\nYou could follow this article on \"Creating a dual-screen experience for iOS and Apple TV\" and look deeper into the Apple developer website about Airplay SDK and Multi Display Programming, where-in you would be able to find information about creating such a controller.\n", "Q: iMessage out of whack... how to \"reset\" I had iMessage working just fine with the latest iOS8 on my iPad, iPhone & Yosemite OSX on my MBP... then after a system restart on my MBP a week+ ago iMessage is all out of whack. It works fine and as expected on my iOS devices (iPad & iPhone), but on my MBP, while I can receive & send messages, I have the following symptoms:\n\n\n*\n\n*No one resolves to their name... only phone numbers are listed for the other person in the conversation. This includes people I've sent messages to or received.\n\n*When I sent a message, I can find the person by name & autocomplete, but when I accept the person from autocomplete, it resolves to their number.\n\n*All recipients show up as red... for instance if you hover over the name/number, usually it shows a blue selection box, but for me they are all red.\n\n\nI've tried signing out & back in, but that didn't work. I don't have any contacts in iCloud as I am on a hosted Exchange (Office 365) where all my contacts are. This is how it was setup since I got my MBP 1yr ago so I know this works and it still works on my iOS devices.\nEverything I've seen talks about syncing your contacts to iCloud... but I've never needed to do that in the past and even when I manually copy one contact over, that has their name, email & correct phone number, it still won't resolve them to their name, only their number.\nAny ideas how to reset this as everything I'm doing isn't working :(\n\nA: It's an issue with OS X & Exchange sync. As a workaround, you can use the OWA app by Microsoft to sync your contacts to iCloud:\n\nOn iOS there's an app called OWA. Within the app there's a setting within the People section for sync'ing your contacts. Basically it creates a new group in your iCloud called OWA that is a carbon copy of your contacts.\n\nOnce I turned this on and saw it sync with my laptop, I got my names resolved and showing in iMessage again!\n\nI have documented a more complete explanation and resolution in Resolving Contacts Sync on OS X - Error SOAPWebServicesErrorDomain.\n", "Q: Is there a Mac equivalent for window snapping? In Windows, you can use the Win key + arrows to snap windows to half the screen.  Is there a OSX equivalent? \nI found a program that does this called HyperDock.  It worked well, but it was just a trial version.  It has more features than I care about and costs to much (IMO).  \nAre there any other programs that are free or cheaper that do the same thing?\n\nA: BetterTouchTool (blog.boastr.net) does just this. I find it very convenient to use with a trackpad: by tapping in different parts of the trackpad I can snap windows to the corresponding region of the screen, one of the most useful features of BetterTouchTool (but it has many many more, check it out!)\nEdit: BetterTouchTool is no longer free\n\nA: Since macOS El Capitan there is native support for arranging windows side by side. This answer provides a lot more information on how to use the feature, and how to make it work with the keyboard.\nIf you want more customisation, and depending on your technical inclination, you might want to try Spectacle, or install something like Mjolnir / HammerSpoon\n", "Q: Can not delete individual messages from iMessage I do have the same issue like Wanda.

I'm trying to use Mail.app in English in Yosemite. The reason for this is that when the app is in another language, it uses that language's headers for replies and can be very distracting to the other reader. \nSo the two possible solutions are a reply-header fix (like Outlook's \"Use English for message headers on replies and forwards and forward notifications\" option) or a Mail.app language fix. There supposedly is a way to fix a single-app's language, but they don't work. \nHere is what I've tried: \ndefaults write -app Mail AppleLanguages -array en\ndefaults write -app Mail AppleLanguages -array en-US\nEditing the file:\n/Users/[username]/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist\nand adding an \"AppleLanguages\" array and then as the first String value, adding \"en\", which is what the defaults command does. \n\nA: To modify Mail to use another language than the default system language open Terminal and enter\ndefaults write com.apple.mail AppleLanguages '(\"preferred_language\", \"default_language\")'.\nIn your example: defaults write com.apple.mail AppleLanguages '(\"en\", \"fi\")' (assuming your default language is finnish)\n", "Q: Apple Macbook Dual Monitor MST I was looking into buying dual monitors for my Mid 2012 non-Retina MacBook. I really liked the looks of the Dell UltraSharp 24 (U2414H)\nAccording to Dell, the Monitor supports MST for the Display Port. \nDoes my MacBook support this multi streaming technology?\n\nA: Unfortunately no, not at present (10.10.1).\nFirstly, your MBP needs to support MST which is part of DisplayPort 1.2 - you can check your laptop's specifications as they may vary depending on which GPU option you went with when you purchased your MBP.\nSecondly, even if your hardware supports it (many recent MBPs do) Apple hasn't added support to OS X for this feature yet. Users who want MST on MBPs have been using bootcamp to boot to Windows which supports MST on the same hardware just fine.\nUpdate (10-08-2015): It would appear as though (thanks to the links of those below) that MST support has been added in 10.10.3. Yay!\n\nA: This doesn’t seem to be supported on the new 2017 MacBook Pro (A1708) with two Thunderbolt 3 ports.\nHowever this is clearly not a hardware limitation since I am able to BootCamp into Windows where both external monitors work in extended mode (not mirrored). On the macOS Sierra side I can only have the two external displays mirror each other.\nI have been using the IOGEAR GUD3C01 to test all of this.\n\nA: Not supported on 10.13.3 on 2018 (2017) 15\" MBP using Kensington SD4600p dock.\n\nA: As of 10.10.3 Apple does apparently support MST* on certain hardware:\n\nThese Mac computers support multi-stream transport (MST) displays at 60 Hz:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) and later,\n  \n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) and later,\n  \n*Mac Pro (Late 2013),\n  \n*iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2014) and later\n  \n\nFrom: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT206587\n*Unfortunately it does appear to be limited to an MST display that relies on multiple streams like the 4K MST Displays mentioned further down on the Apple Support page, and not MST for chaining multiple DP1.2 Displays as I haven't been able to find any information about this being possible.\nFrom my own testing with the new MacBook Pro 2016 13\" with two thunderbolts ports, a StarTech DP 1.2 USB Type-C to DisplayPort cable, two Dell U2414H and a standard DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable to chain with, the display on the end of the chain just mirrors the other display. This is with DisplayPort 1.2 enabled in the settings on both displays.\nWhich seems to confirm that MST DisplayPort daisy chaining on OSX 10.12.2 on the 2016 MacBook Pro line is unsupported, with no sign of it getting supported anytime soon.\n", "Q: Can I take GoPro videos that I have imported on to my iPad and later put them on my MacBook Pro? I travel a lot and I use a memory card reader on my iPad to import my GoPro videos and pictures while I am traveling just because it is easier than bringing my whole MacBook along with me. Can I then later take those videos and put them onto my MacBook? I basically use my iPad as a temporary storage device that way I can get them on my MacBook to edit them and upload them appropriately (hopefully). Appreciate any help!\n\nA: vkvau is essentially correct, when you sync your iPad to your Mac iPhoto should open and give you the option of importing all/selected pictures/videos and then an option to delete them.\nIt's all quite easy and exactly as the iPad was designed to work.\n", "Q: Mac Speech 'choppy' Is there any reason why the text to speech reader will sound choppy?\nOn the first attempt to read a block of text, it stops for a split second every few clauses - even failing to say some words along the process. On the second pass, it does a lot better.\nIt feels like it's buffering. It wasn't like this before.\nSome points:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apparently, it's not related to software since I've observed it in Snow Leopard, and it's there after upgrading to Yosemite.\n\n*Changing the voice and voice speed does not help.\n\n*Restarting doesn't help either, initially I thought a high-demand process was taking up CPU time that prevents this function from working effectively.\n\n\nMacBook Pro Late 2011 on Yosemite.\nAny hint would be appreciated.\n\nA: Buscar is thinking exactly what I was. Open activity monitor and keep an eye on processor and RAM usage when your Mac is reading some text to you.\nIt is likely that some resource is limited and slowing things down. It is most likely RAM or CPU but it is also possible that the Mac is doing a lot of reading/writing to the HD or even the network or other mounted device.\nIf you reboot the Mac, make sure that there are no mounted network volumes nor any removable media (CDs, USB flash drives, etc.) mounted and then try to have some text spoken with nothing else running does the same thing happen?\nIf so try it with your network turned off, maybe even in Safe Mode.\n", "Q: MacBook OS X Mavericks reinstallation I'm trying to reinstall OS X Mavericks on a MacBook through internet the error that i receive is:\n\"This item is temporarily unavailable.\"\n\nA: For me at least, since I previously \"purchased\" Mavericks from the App Store, it showed up in my previous purchases list so I was able to download it. If you never actually installed Mavericks from the app store directly (i.e. upgraded an older Mac using the App Store) then it probably won't be there. This is a strange oversight on Apple's part - some apps out there still don't properly support Yosemite, and my workplace also has had problems with Yosemite working with their directory infrastructure, so we still use Mavericks as a matter of course.\nIf you didn't \"buy\" (read: download for free) Mavericks officially from the App store, your only option is to find a friend who did and ask them to create you a USB installation media. Instructions for doing this are easily found on the Internet. \n\nA: Since Apple has released the replacement for Mavericks called Yosemite, the Mavericks is no longer available on app store for download.\nThere are no official sources to get Mavericks.\nYou option is to find a friend or someone and get a copy from them.\n\nA: This might be a little late, but the link to create a bootable installer once you have your hands on a downloaded installer is:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372\n", "Q: Rosetta under Yosemite? Is there any simple way to run rosetta under Yosemite?\nIf not, am I correct that Snow Leopard Server will run on Parallels (and it seems this is the 'legit' way, I'd like to be 100% legal), and that would solve my goal of hanging on to some PPC apps without the constant need to reboot to other drives or use multiple machines? \nI'm running a mid-2010 Mac Pro, and need higher than Snow Leopard to run the new TurboTax, but wanting to hold on to an investment of $$ in PPC-only apps.\nUpdate - I bought two Apricorn PCI cards to install SSDs without taking up HD space. One SSD boot Snow Leo, the other, Yosemite. At this point, the Snow Leo OS is the one I use most often, booting into Yosemite when I need the newer software. The SSDs offer such a fast boot that starting up/ rebooting is pretty fast, not too much trouble. \n\nA: There is no way at all to run Rosetta in Yosemite. Rosetta was included in Mac OS X 10.4.4–10.6.8 (Intel) only.\nThe Apple license agreement doesn't allow customers to run a Snow Leopard client  in a virtual environment.\nSo the only legal way to use PPC apps with Yosemite is indeed Snow Leopard Server (Apple part number is MC588Z/A internal link (It only works in their store)) in Parallels (10.0 recommended) or VMware Fusion (at least 6.0.5, 7.0 recommended).\n\nA: The best way is to just run it on an older dedicated Mac that runs SL.\n\nA: You could try to get PearPC up and running with an older version of OS X? I successfully ran it with 10.3 on a Windows XP machine several years ago, though recent half-hearted attempts to get it to run on 10.8 (or perhaps 10.9) didn't get that far. However, I think I was trying to get 10.0 or 10.1 to install and didn't attempt something like 10.4 or 10.5.\nNot easy to set up, a lot of RTFM, but this might be the best approach for you at the moment without dual booting.\n\nA: Be aware that if you succeed in installing SL Server (with Rosetta) in Parallels, it will work fine but you will not have OpenGL support, so many games will give you only the sound and no picture at all. And that was the main reason I wanted it ! ex.: Brick of Atlantis\n", "Q: Thunderbolt display not charging MBP battery I have a mid-2012 Retina MacBook Pro and two Thunderbolt displays purchased in mid-2014. The MBP sits plugged into one of the Thunderbolt displays almost all the time, unless I'm using it away from my desk. \nLately, I noticed that the computer's charging behavior was odd:\n\n\n*\n\n*The menu bar's battery indicator did display the \"charging\" lightning bolt;\n\n*The percent charged number did not change over the course of many plugged in hours;\n\n*The indicator light on the MagSafe charger did not turn on.\n\n\nSome power was clearly coming through, since the battery was not draining; it was just also not charging. Restarting did not solve this, and neither did resetting the SMC (my go-to move for weird power or peripheral glitches). But: plugging the laptop into the other Thunderbolt display did solve the problem. \nThus it seems there's a problem with that particular Thunderbolt display. How do I troubleshoot it? \n\nA: I just did what AdamJ said, took my magsafe adapter off and clean it up with a toothbrush to remove dust. It really worked and now my thunderbolt display is charging my macbook pro! :)\n\nA: I had the same problem here.  Reset the SMC and it fixed problem for ½ a day.  Then back to not charging.  Although the Macbook Pro indicator did show a charger connected, it just wasn't charging the battery and there was no light (amber or green) on the magsafe power from the Thunderbolt display.  Another magsafe external charger gave the same results. Swapped the little magnetic magsafe adaptor with my wife's magsafe adaptor and now the light glows amber and my Macbook is charging again.\n\nA: I've just recently started having the same issue with my 27\" cinema display and a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014). Flipping the magsafe adapter didn't seem to work consistently for me. Plugging in the regular power adapter worked fine.\nFor me, cleaning the contacts with some isopropyl alcohol on a q-tip seemed to do the job. Might not be a long-term solution but so far it's doing the job.\n\nA: Experienced the same problem recently.  Took the magsafe adapter off, blew any dust from the inside and replaced.  Works now. \n\nA: I had the same problem after returning from a trip to Europe this morning. It was solved by plugging in the wall adaptor, which took a couple of seconds to start charging. Then the macbook air did start to charge after plugging it back into the thunderbolt display. The wall adaptor seemed to reset the charging circuit in the MB Air.\n\nA: Having similar problems. Swapped Thunderbolt 30\" displays, didn't fix it. Using the portable power adapter, the MBP charges. Once it's charged, we can switch to the Thunderbolt magsafe adapter, and the charge more-or-less holds (losing 1-1.5% per day), but won't increase unless we connect the external power adapter again. If the user goes mobile and then comes back to her desk, she has to use the external AC adapter to get her battery fully charged again, then can switch to the Thunderbolt display's power connector.\n", "Q: My external monitor goes grayscale on the non moving parts of the screen (mid-2014 Macbook Pro Retina) I have a mid-2014 Macbook Pro Retina 15\".

I usually play videos and streams on my larger 27\" and periodically the stream is in color and the rest of the screen is in shades of gray. More specifically my external monitor goes grayscale on the non moving parts of the screen. \nIs that normal? \n\nA: Turns out it's not a Mac thing -- it's a \"feature\" of the Acer monitor.

Anyone know how I might get this to happen? I'm open to using Caffeine or something like that, but with 3x 30 inch monitors my power bill will suck if I don't let them sleep (and turning them off is annoying because all my windows get rearranged).\n\nA: Just put your displays to sleep in the energy saver settings (like in the picture below) and it should work.\n\nPlease check the answer at serverfault for the reason why the VPN-connections breaks.\n\nA: You might try caffeinate. It's the terminal utility that the Caffeine app runs. Running it from the terminal allows you to have more options:\ncaffeinate -ims can prevent system + disk + idle sleeping while still allowing your screen to sleep\nman caffeinate: \nAvailable options:\n\n -d      Create an assertion to prevent the display from sleeping.\n\n -i      Create an assertion to prevent the system from idle sleeping.\n\n -m      Create an assertion to prevent the disk from idle sleeping.\n\n -s      Create an assertion to prevent the system from sleeping.

I found this setting:\n\nSorry for non-English screenshot. Here is OSX Networking settings for SOCKS proxy. I can see only \"black list\" for ip addresses to access without proxy. But I need \"white list\" of ip addresses.\n\nA: I enjoyed your screen shot. I just learned how to say прокси-сервер!\nI believe what you'd be doing is asking the proxy redirector to make exceptions to its exceptions. I think this will probably not be possible.\nThere is a kind of tool which may work better for you.  It is called a URL re-writer or URL re-director.  Instead of setting up a SOCKS proxy, which would be designed to forward every kind of web call, a URL re-writer would watch all the outgoing connection requests and replace just the ones that match to wherever you re-direct them.  This is very good for sending a small number of addresses or domains to another place--like your proxy server or tunnel endpoint.\nThese URL rewriters come in two flavors: the sort installed in routers—-like squid—-or they can be browser plug-ins. Some routers have this feature built in and call it \"transparent web redirecting.\"\nThere's a plug-in for Safari called \"urlrewrite-safari\" that lives at https://github.com/sjmulder/urlrewrite-safari .  There's one for Firefox called \"Redirector\" which works much the same. I haven't looked to see what's there for Google Chrome.\nThe only snag is that when you do a web search for \"URL rewrite\" or \"URL redirect\" you also end up with a lot of server-side redirection stuff, too.\n", "Q: Network issues since upgrading to Yosemite - Unable to find local systems I am on a Windows corporate network.

Many haven't upgraded from Mavericks to Yosemite because of this issue.\n\nA: This is very common problem in split-horizon DNS and heterogenous but Windows-dominated company networks. A lot of Windows sysadmins are used to the .local TLD as a valid private TLD name since at least a decade though it's not RFC-compliant anymore.\nWhen your local area network has been configured with a domain name ending in .local, then all LAN hostname resolutions queried by a Mac will be passed to mDNS first - bypassing unicast DNS!\nSo hostname resolutions for .local often fail in Mac OS X applications (Safari, Chrome etc and often ping).\nIn contrary dig and nslookup are unicast DNS utilities, so they will both bypass the system hostname resolution order (files->mDNS->DNS) and query unicast DNS directly.\nSome workarounds exist (your mileage will vary):\n\n*\n\n*flush DNS cache frequently\n\n*add prod.local as search domain (to add local additionally is sometimes advised as well)\n\n\nIMHO the only proper and RFC-compliant way to fix this is changing the local domain names to use a TLD other than .local in your Windows corporate network.\n\nA: I don't have that issue.\nDid you try flushing the DNS cache?\nOpen a terminal and run this code:\nsudo discoveryutil udnsflushcaches\n\nIs your DNS server listed in you network preferences under Advanced > DNS ?\nIf not, add the ip address of your DNS server there.\n", "Q: How do I get the URL of a right-clicked link sent to an automator action?

Similarly, in LaunchBar the action is built into the basic index, too, and one can initiate it with term or similar.\n(2) Type texdoc PackageName where PackageName is the LaTeX package you're looking for the documentation for. For example: texdoc enumitem or texdoc thmtools.\nIt'll open the documentation PDF. That's it!\nNote that of course you can also do this from the command line directly if you open a terminal window.\n\nA: If you're a Powerpack user, I'd suggest creating a file filter. Follow the steps in the tutorial below, but drag in a LaTeX file instead to tell your filter which file types to include. You can include as many file types as you need.\nhttp://blog.alfredapp.com/2014/04/24/tutorial-creating-an-alfred-workflow-without-a-single-line-of-code/\nIf you're not a Powerpack user, you can add the LaTeX file types to Alfred's Default Results. Go to the Preferences > Features > Default Results, click on \"Advanced\" and drag in your file types. However, be aware that this could clutter up your results quite a bit if you have a lot of files of this type, making it harder to locate your apps or essential files. :)\n", "Q: Calendar repeat day of week events I need to repeat bi-weekly events. This is on either the second Wednesday of the month and the first and third Thursdays. When I specify biweekly events and there is a fifth Thursday, that is included.

I use tweezers often in our car, which the cd player's eject function won't work.\nBut since yours is so \"deep\" down, can you still see it? If not, well, slim tweezers?\nIf you can still see it, you should be able to use the tweezers.\n-------------------------------\nAnother way is maybe a hook fashioned out of a plastic sheet? take a slim but sturdy sheet, cut it so that it fits into the drive, and fold a small fold along one end. The fold will act like a hook and grab onto the drive. \nInsert the plastic folded end first, facing down. try to get the plastic on top of the disc so the fold slides over the top and unfold behind it.

Three connections I know of are VGA, HDMI and DVI. What is the difference and what cables do I need? Are there any other options I can consider? Are there any adaptors that let me switch between VGA and DVI?\n\nA: The best connector is obviously one which matches your monitor.\nIf you are getting a new monitor, most now use HDMI.\nHDMI and DVI-D are very similar, and dual adaptors are common. The main difference is lack of sound on DVI.\nVGA is an analog connection, and effectively obsolete, but you can get VGA adaptors for a Mac.\n", "Q: Mac connects to anonymous wireless networks randomly I have my own router and it has a strong signal full bars, but sometimes when I leave my macbook for a time and come back I notice that it connects other random anonymous wireless networks.\nhow can I disable it, so it only connects to my router?\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Network > Wifi\n\n*Click on Advanced\n\n*Remove the preferred networks from the list by using - button\n\n\n\n", "Q: Using Apple Developer as proof of sales between two companies We are currently negotiating with a company where that company will use our technology (image recognition) to create an iOS app. We will receive a Royalty based on sales and we do not know the company enough to feel that we can trust them.

I usually have music playing on my Mac while wearing earphones. And I often change the volume with my wired keyboard keys.\nI imagine that it is an issue with the keyboard itself, but sometimes (rarely), when I increase the volume, despite the fact that I'm no longer pressing the keys, the volume still goes up to the max.\nAnd of course, my earphones explode on me before I realise what's going on.\nTo solve this, rather than changing my volume-adjusting habits, I was wondering if there is some way to put a volume hard-limit in the system. Like, \"whatever happens, don't let me go beyond 70%\" or something.\nOSX Mavericks.\n\nA: If this problem is still relevant to you, I've got good news.\nI wrote an app, which limits the volume on your Mac to a given percentage you set. It's called Earsafe, you can check it out at earsafe.io.\nAll the best!\n\nA: I do not know about the \"Hard limit\" but you can use the\nsudo osascript -e \"set Volume 10\" \n\nfor max\nor sudo osascript -e \"set Volume 5\" \n\nfor mid range\nand so on.\n\nA: It’s 2019 and sadly this is still relevant.\nI was using Konstantin Anoshkin’s (now extinct) background daemon and I ended creating one myself that solved some things I did not like.\nThe script uses AppleScript and Javascript to create a slightly more complex app that you can close and that shows a notification and emit a “bip” when you exceed your volume limit.\nclass Volimiter {\n  constructor(appName, maxVolume) {\n    this.app = Application.currentApplication();\n    this.app.includeStandardAdditions = true;\n    this.appName = appName;\n    this.maxVolume = maxVolume;\n  }\n\n  get currentVolume() {\n    const { outputVolume } = this.app.getVolumeSettings();\n    return outputVolume;\n  }\n\n  limitVolume() {\n    if (this.currentVolume > this.maxVolume) {\n      this.app.beep();\n      this.app.setVolume(null, { outputVolume: this.maxVolume });\n    }\n  }\n\n  showNotification() {\n    this.app.displayNotification(\"\", {\n      withTitle: this.appName,\n      subtitle: `Limiting your  volume to ${\n        this.maxVolume\n      }% to protect your ears`\n    });\n  }\n}\n\nconst PurrfectVolume = new Volimiter(\"Purrfect volume \", 25);\nPurrfectVolume.showNotification();\n\nfunction idle() {\n  PurrfectVolume.limitVolume();\n  return 0.5;\n}\n´´´\n\nYou can set your desired maximum volume on the second parameter of Volimiter, on line 27. Just play with what it feels right.\n\nTo be able to go over the volume limit (i.e. you switch to speakers and want to watch a movie) you can quit the script/app from your task manager.\n\nI wrote everything about it in this in [this blog post](https://medium.com/trabe/limiting-your-macs-volume-in-2019-f314e20408ab).

I need a folder action that hides files according to their extensions. (I do not need a folder action that hides extensions for visible files.) This action needs to apply to every file in the folder and to every file that is added to the folder in the future. \nAssistance for a similar task was asked for here, but that was solved with a smart folders workaround that does not work for me because I cannot use a smart folder in this context. Another similar task was asked for here. In response, the moderator bmike said that pieces for this folder action I have described could be put together from other articles on this site. I have been unable to do so. My need for this folder action is also not unique to LaTeX and so the other solutions discussed there will not be of any use. So what I'm looking for has not been resolved elsewhere. \nI have tried two things. Initially, I tried to model what was shown here. First, I created an .app through Automator that runs this shell script: \nfind /Users/USER/FOLDER/* -iname *.EXTENSION -execdir chflags hidden {} \\;    \n\nSecond, I created a script that run the following commands:\non adding folder items to this_folder after receiving added_items tell application \"Mac OS X:Users:USER:Library:Workflows:Applications:Folder Actions:FIRSTSTEP.app\" open added_items end tell end adding folder items to \n\nAs I understand it, this runs the previous Automator app every time something is added to the folder with the action. Finally, I added this script as a folder action to the folder which needs to exhibit the behavior in question. \nBut this didn't work for me. Any idea what's going wrong? \nI have also tried using Hazel to simply run the shell script on the folder. This works to hide the file when it is added to the folder the first time a file is added, but any later file added doesn't work. The error that is given is \"Shellscript exited with non-successful status code: 1.\"\n\nA: Here you go. It works just fine on Snow Leopard.\n\n", "Q: Mac issues: grey screen, cannot reinstall mac os from recover, unapproved caller Well, the past few days have been a near disaster. This whole problem started when I was using Chrome and I suddenly couldn't access pages. I checked Safari, and it wasn't working either. Since I was getting the \"Oh snap!\" page from Chrome, I X'd it out and tried to reopen it. Chrome's dock icon would just bounce once (usually it bounces until it opens) without opening. I tried to restart the computer, but the \"Restart\" and \"Shut Down\" buttons on the Apple Menu weren't working, so I held down the power button and did a force shutdown. When I tried to turn the MacBook back on, I was stuck in the grey screen forever. I have tried everything on the Apple troubleshooting pages. I tried Safe Mode and I was still stuck on the grey screen. I tried the Safe Mode showing progress, and for some reason I could get back in, but then the cycle began anew with Chrome not working.\nI tried the PRAM reset or whatever it's called. \nI finally tried to do a Mac OS X from the recovery. Sometimes it won't let me start the reinstall and other times it gets to like 6 minutes remaining and then it will suddenly stop. \nEdit: I forgot to mention that I did all the verify disk and permissions and repairs in the Disk Utility in the recovery. I also ran the Apple Hardware Test, and it said nothing was wrong. At times when the computer was able to boot but having troubles I was getting an \"unapproved caller\" message.\n\nA: In case anyone is interested, I took the Mac to the Apple Store and the issue was the Mac hard drive cable. They replaced it and it works fine now.\n\nA: Would help to know the specifics of your Mac. Operating system, Memory etc. \nAnyway this might be worth a stab: Open up your Mac and check if one of your memory sticks has gone bad (that happens-especially on third party memory). Remove all memory stick except one (one that your computer came with=original Apple memory)-restart...repeat this until you checked all of them. Make sure you disconnect ALL peripherals (printer, external hard-drives etc) before doing this.\nIf you are able to do a normal boot successfully, put them back in (one at a time) until the problem comes back-meaning the last memory stick was the problem.\nGood luck!\n\nA: This is probably caused by contents of /var/folders/ directory.\nSometimes the upgrade process fails to complete a specific task that is meant to remove cached files from that location.\nThere is a Launch Daemon at /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.bsd.dirhelper.plist that is meant to remove the files from the /var/folders location every 3 days, but it sometimes may fail.\nRemoving the contents of this folder should not affect the system as they are only cached files.  This will only need to be done once, then a restart of the system and the Unapproved Caller error should go away.\nThe most convenient way to do this is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Load the machine in single user mode:\nhttp://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201573\n\n*Execute the following command in the terminal (be exteremely careful):\nmkdir /Users/backup\ncp -r /var/folders/* /Users/backup/\nrm -rf /var/folders/*\n\n*Reboot the machine.\n", "Q: Yosemite: Disabling inertia scrolling using scroll wheel for the mouse Is there a way to disable inertia scrolling (scrolling speeds up the faster you scroll the mouse wheel) for Yosemite for only the mouse? I understand the reason for inertia scrolling for the trackpad, but makes no sense on the mouse. \nI've tried various fixes in regards to this issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloading Scroll Reverser based on this thread.\n\n*Tried this thread's fixes.\nBut none of them disable the inertia scrolling for mouse. I would still like the default Windows mouse-scrolling behavior where one scroll is the same distance no matter how fast you spin the scroll wheel.\nEDIT: Apparently you can disable inertia scrolling by enabling/disabling it in Mouse Options under Accessibility, but mine does not have the dropdown like other people seem to have: \n\nThis is the thread in question about mouse option inertia scrolling.\n\nA: Take a look at USB Overdrive. With it help I've finally removed scroll acceleration and setup custom buttons on my Logitech m570.\n \n\nA: This has been a problem and an aggravation for me since Mavericks. I'd like a linear input for the mouse wheel, but there isn't any option for this in Mavericks or Yosemite, and I never found a hack or a terminal command that worked.\nI posted this on the Apple forums a while ago and still, no fix is available:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/5506804\nBasically, I want one \"nudge\" of the mouse wheel to scroll down 4 lines. Currently, and unavoidably, one slow \"nudge\" moves the mouse wheel about .5 a line. If I scroll down faster, it speeds up, but the end result is that to scroll to an exact position on a large page, I will always scroll past it and have to go back up. It's supremely aggravating and there are no known fixes for it.\n\nA: Thanks to Tetsujin, I can confirm that SteerMouse does allow linear scrolls. And it allows setting the acceleration and sensitivity of the mouse movement separately too.\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Steermouse\n\n*Go to the Wheel tab\n\n*Pick Roll Up, then change Mode to \"Linear\".\n\n*Repeat for Roll Down.\n\n\nIf you don't want your cursor speed to change, disable settings in the Cursor tab.\nSo there is a solution if you're happy paying someone $20 to fix Apple's bugs.\n\nA: In Terminal, run the following command to disable mouse scaling.\ndefaults write -g com.apple.mouse.scaling -1\n\nSimilarly, the following disables scroll wheel scaling.\ndefaults write -g com.apple.scrollwheel.scaling -1\n\n\nA: I resolve it with this app https://smooze.co.

I am trying to enroll into iOS Developer Program as government organization.\nOne of the requirements is:\n\nThe legal authority to bind your company/organization to Apple Developer Program legal agreements.\n\nI am having some confusions with understanding that.\nIs it just requiring an ID for a responsible person on the organization, let say the IT manager?\n\nA: Apple's phrasing is deliberately wide because the terms need to cover a wide range of countries and legal systems.\nDepending on the jurisdiction you are in, the meaning of legal authority will differ. Typically, it means the individual agreeing has the power to make a binding agreement between the individual or organisation and Apple Inc.\nAs an example, a Limited Liability company registered in England and Wales would typically require a Director to make the agreement.

I recently purchased a used MacMini3,1 (Late 2009) with a 2.26 Intel Core 2 Duo processor, and 2 GB of memory. The seller shipped it to me with Snow Leopard installed, and it ran smooth and fast. I just upgraded it to Lion and it's very sluggish. Would adding more memory fix this, or possibly upgrading to Mountain Lion make the computer run better? I installed Yosemite and it was unusably slow. I realize the computer is old, but does anyone have a solution?\n\nA: Opening up a Mac Mini for the first time can be a daunting operation.  You're only going to want to do it once if you can help it, so plan ahead and upgrade everything at once.\nMaximum RAM for that model is 8 Gb.  Maximum hard drive space is a total of 2 Tb split between the two internal SATA buses (the one used by the stock hard drive, and the one used by the optical drive).\nI would recommend upgrading the RAM, replacing the hard drive with the largest SSD you can afford, and seriously considering replacing the optical drive with either another SSD or a second hard drive.  You can always attach an external optical drive via USB or FireWire when you need it, and optical drives are so slow compared to hard drives that the bottleneck of the USB or FireWire interface won't make much difference (whereas you'll see significantly faster data transfer speeds reading or writing large files to and from a hard disk connected to the second internal SATA bus).\nFor example, depending on your particular use case, you might put the operating system and applications on a small SSD, and large files you're working on frequently on a larger mechanical hard drive, both inside the case, and connect an external optical drive as needed.\nEdit: Other World Computing sells the brackets and cables needed to replace the internal optical drive with a second hard drive or SSD.\n\nA: The 2GB RAM is the biggest bottleneck here, no matter what you use the Mac Mini for. No recent Mac has been shipped with less than 4GB installed. Although memory management has gotten much better from Mountain Lion > Mavericks > Yosemite, you need to increase the RAM to at least 4GB.\nSecondarily, you may be able retrofit a SSD to replace the slow internal HD.\nI and my staff upgraded >200 Mac Minis of this vintage from 2GB to 4GB a number of years ago, in anticipation of upgrading from Snow Leopard to Lion & then eventually Mountain Lion. It enabled us to push the use of these computers another 2 years or so.\nWe've purchased all our RAM from DMS for more than a decade. RAM and HD/SSD retrofits can be found at a number of places, most notably Other World Computing.\n(Disclaimer: We are institutionally satisfied, (and I am personally satisfied,) with both of these company's products, and have no vested or financial interest in either company.)\n\nA: Two weeks ago I upgraded same machine albeit in a form of laptop — White Unibody Macbook with Nvidia 9400.\nWhat I did was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Added 8GB of memory. Buy two 4GB DDR3-1066 SODIMM sticks. System controller/firmware have problems with handling memory speed above that. You might look buying second hand or buying only one module of 1066MHz and another one can be 1333 since are they easier to find and usually cheaper. Having working 1066MHz stick present will command 1066Mhz for the second one. Many 1600MHz modules do not have predefined settings in its SPD chip for handling 1066MHz frequency but big names usually do. Look for Hynix, Samsung, Crucial and the likes. For 1066MHz module(s) recommendation going for big manufacturer still applies.\n\n*Replaced optical drive with so called Optibay. Here is how you do it for you Mac Mini. \nOptibay in this case is a name for a converter from miniSATA to SATA in form of optical drive) — eBay have plenty of them. Make sure it is 12.7mm SATA-SATA without handles i.e. not for Macbook.\nIt will look like this\n\n\n*Installed cheapest big brand 128GB SSD into Optibay for system & apps and designated HDD as storage area for music, video and other data. I haven't seen need for bigger SSD you might think otherwise. Also HDD can be replaced with one up to 2TB if you need it.\n\n*Installed Yosemite. It is free and fast. Nvidia 9400 chip helps with flash and h.264 video decoding so I think this machine will last another maybe five years for moderately heavy use. Like no video editing (it is hard to predict technology though)\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Enable \"Developer\" inside the \"Settings\" app on iOS Before Xcode 6 one could go to the Xcode Organizer window.

I'd like to use the Display Calibrator Assistant without going through the process of opening the system preferences.\nDoes anyone know where the program is located on my hard drive?\nI've done a search for various keywords without being able to find it.\n\nA: The app can be found at this path:\n/System/Library/ColorSync/Calibrators/Display Calibrator.app\n\nTo run directly from Terminal type:\nopen -a /System/Library/ColorSync/Calibrators/Display\\ Calibrator.app\n\nThis will pop-up a small window on every monitor you have connected. \n", "Q: Hostname changes all the time from capital to not capital and back my Macbook air is called Johannes-Air. But when I open the terminal sometimes it says Johannes-Air and sometimes johannes-air. Does anyone know why this happens and how to stop it?\n\nA: \nThe local hostname (is set in the Sharing pane of System Preferences) check it at first.\n\nThen if you go to the below path, you might find traces of both upper & lower case hostname     remove one of them and reboot your system.\n\n/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist.\n\n\nA: I've been dealing with this for a few weeks and just discovered that it seems to be related to my local DHCP / DNS server (pfsense + unbound in my case).\nbaseline (WiFi on, connected to my home network):\n$ hostname -s\nmyhostname\n\nWiFi off:\n$ hostname -s\nMyHostName\n\nWiFi back on again:\n$ hostname -s\nmyhostname\n\nWiFi on + VPN connected (with DNS leak protection):\n$ hostname -s\nMyHostName\n\nSo in my case, it looks like pfsense may be normalizing the hostname that it returns when I'm connected to my local network. This is causing some issues with my flake-based nix-darwin setup, so I think I'll configure my hostname to be lowercase to match: sudo scutil --set HostName myhostname.\nThere is also some helpful information including commands to manipulate your hostname at this related question.\n", "Q: Run a program/script when the screen is locked or unlocked Is there a way to run a specified script or program when the screen is locked or unlocked? Ideally a bash function or an AppleScript.\nIs there an event that I could subscribe to that would allow me to do that? Or an existing app that supports this?\n\nA: EventScript has a few options that might work for you.  It's a neat little utility that can trigger .sh/applescript/automator workflows and trigger them on a host of different options. \nHere's some screen locking/unlocking options: \nCheck it out here.\n\nA: After some searching, I found SleepWatcher, a free tool that allows to run a script when the screen goes to sleep or wakes up.\nAfter installing it, you can link a shell script that is run on one of the available events (which include dim screen, wake up screen, computer sleep, wake up computer and some more). From the shell script, I can run a command, or call an AppleScript that I want to run on these events.\nSince my screen goes to sleep when I lock my computer, this is exactly what I was looking for.\nYou can see it in action here: https://github.com/nwinkler/sleepwatcher-lync-status\n\nA: Info for future googlers landing here:\nI got this working using EventScripts.\nI wanted my desk lamp, which is connected to a TP-link smart plug to turn on when I unlock my Mac, and to turn off when it locks.\nI found this bash script which can turn the smart plug on and off. (I don't have nmap installed, so I had to figure out the IP address of the smart plug by looking at my router's config screens, then supply the IP address to the hs100.sh script via the -i option.)\nThen it was just a matter of writing two simple scripts for \"on\" and \"off\", to call hs100.sh on and hs100.sh off. Since EventScripts is on the Mac App Store, it can only run scripts in its own folder, so I put my two scripts there.\nAnd voilà! Works perfectly!\n\nA: You can set it up like this:\nsudo defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook /path/to/script\n\n", "Q: How to prevent text messages from my iPhone to my iPad?

However, I do not want to have Mail include that information in forwarded emails.\nMost solutions posted online suggest going to Preferences → Viewing → Show header detail but this prevents me from viewing header details in my Inbox. Is there a way for me to have my cake and eat it too?\n\nA: The detailed Header view is a Menu bar Icon (you can set it up) that allows you to view headers from Received emails. \nTo set it up right click on the mail menu bar and choose Customize.\nFrom the new screen drag the \"All Headers\" icon to your menu bar.\nWithout some serious hacking, any email you send will also include the extended header information, same way as you can see it.\n", "Q: Cannot Remove Configuration Profile On iPhone I worked at a company that used GOOD For Enterprise. I installed it on my iPhone 5s and now that I've left the company, would like to remove the profile. I've deleted the GOOD application, but I cannot remove the profile.

I just did a full wipe and restored the phone with my iCloud profile and sure enough, it's still my one and only configuration profile on my phone. How do I get this off of here? Here are some images...\n\n\n\n\n\nA: I believe you will have to wipe your phone and not restore from backup. Some configuration profiles allow the creator to prevent removal of the profile.\nApple's configuration reference lists the following key the creator of the profile probably used:\n\nPayloadRemovalDisallowed -\n  Optional.

A couple a days ago i placed a sensitive file on the desktop, and later deleted it by emptying the trashcan. I then read that was not the way to get rid of a sensitive file. I still have a copy on the file stored, on my other computer, and I was wondering if putting the same file in the same place (the desktop) would overwrite the old file I had deleted which now is allocated as \"free space\". I can use disk utility because I have an SSD. Then I can do a secure delete in order to erase it completely.\n\nA: There is no way to guarantee to put the data in the 'same place', no matter where in the filesystem you put it. \nHard drives just don't work that way. They will put specific data anywhere they like [or to an algorithm unfathomable to mere users]\nTo be reasonably certain of overwriting the data [with as much certainty as you can have without destroying the drive] you would use Erase Free Space - which you will have noticed you cannot do on an SSD - though the way SSDs use their storage is completely unlike a HD; they try to allocate writes all across their memory-space to even out the wear. This makes recovery of a deleted file a much more difficult task than with an HD, but not impossible.\nAs far as I'm aware [& nothing ever seems certain in these things] the best way to 'erase free space' on an SSD is to fill the drive with random data - anything, a movie file copied over & over til the disk is full, then delete it all again.\nThat will have written over the previous data at least.\nRepeat ad nauseum for multiple pass erase [if that even really has any meaning for an SSD.\n", "Q: Mail 7.3 with iMac running 10.9 I just upgraded from an iMac with 10.6 to a newer iMac with 10.9. When I use the Mail 7.3 program and go to print and email, it prints all previous emails from the same sender as well. I don't want all the other emails printed, just the current one. Is there a way to disable the other emails from printing, or to disable the grouping of emails?  Thank you...\n\nA: I assume you are talking about same email with multiple messages (emails) in it.\nIn order to print specific email embedded in that email chain:\nSelect the single message window: It will have a highlighted border. \nThe other emails will be separated with page separator.\nIt looks like this (sorry I had to black out my personal info), but you can see 3 emails in this chain and only the top one is selected for printing.\n\nIn top Right (circled) of that window you will find the Print Icon, that will print the selected message only.\n", "Q: I want to add a 5TB HD (NTFS) to my time capsule and have access to it from both my Mac and my PC's I want to add a 5TB HD (NTFS) to my time capsule. I have both Mac and PC's and will like to access the drive from both. I can see that the drive is attached in airport utility on my windows pc but I can't access it(probably because of the NTFS partition). I am not seeing anything at all in airport utility on my Mac (probably because it's not in HFS+ format).\nI think I can partition the drive into two drives, one NTFS and the other HFS+ but I will only do that if it's my only choice. I would rather have access to everything from both Mac and PC............\nHELP!!!\n\nA: Here is a link to Apple's instructions on how to mount the drives on both sides if they don't seem to show up. How to mount a Time Capsule HD\nThe only disk formats that the Time Capsules support are HFS (Macs default), FAT16, and FAT32. Supported HD for Time Capsule. Since you have a large HD you cannot use FAT16 as it is made for smaller HD's (<2GB).\nIf you would like to use Apple's Default (HFS) you will have to install software on the PC in order to write to the drive. Paragon-software has the tools needed to use HFS on windows computers\nIf you use FAT32 both your windows and Mac will be able to read/write from the HD.\n", "Q: Connect MacBook to projector without DisplayPort As it appears, my Thunderbolt/mini DisplayPort port on my MBP mid-2012 is nonfunctional, so I cannot use my DP-VGA adapter anymore to connect to external monitors/projectors.\nWhat alternatives are there and what are the limitations?\n\nA: You can use a USB Display Adapter.  One like this could work.  \nSome display adapters only support digital formats (HDMI, DVI-D...) so if your projector only supports analog signals (i.e. VGA) then make sure the adapter you get supports it.  \nOne limitation of USB display adapters is their limited bandwidth, and therefore limited resolution.  For a projector, there shouldn't be any issues, but if you wanted to power a 4k monitor, they may not work.  Again, check the specs on the display adapter you are looking for and make sure it supports your desired resolution.\n", "Q: Issues with the softwareupdated daemon after upgrading to Yosemite? Ever since the upgrade to Yosemite, the softwareupdated process always consumes around 100% CPU. \nI noticed this the other day when I closed my laptop at the end of the day and the area above the left side of the keyboard was very warm. Looking at Activity Monitor, the softwareupdated process was running at full blast. That also explains the horrible battery life that I have had since upgrading. \nI waited to upgrade to Yosemite until after the first xx.xx.1 point release and ever since then the softwareupdated runs constantly, no matter how many times that I kill it. \nIs there a solution for this?\nMacBook Pro, OS X Yosemite (10.10.1)\n\nA: Disconnect from the network and reboot the Mac.\nThen see if the process can clean itself up. Assuming it is under control, open system preferences and turn off all automatic checks under the app store pane.\nAt that point you can reconnect to the internet and see if things are solid before opening the App Store app again.\n\nA: Had the same problem after upgrading to Yosemite and then updating. A reboot fixed the (not responding), but it is still a memory hog at almost 500 MB, the biggest process ! This solved it for me :\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to App Store in Preferences and disable \"Automatically check for updates\".\n\n*In Activity Monitor, kill softwareupdated.\n\n*IMPORTANT: Go to App Store in Preferences weekly to check for updates manually.\n\n\nHopefully Apple will reduce the size of this daemon in the next update.\n", "Q: OS X install on SSD hangs every time I've got an early 2011 13\" MBP with a 120GB SSD, formerly part of a DIY Fusion Drive, that I'm trying to install Yosemite on. Every time I try to install from my bootable drive, it hangs at the exact same point: ETA 11 minutes, last log entry \"PackageKit: Extracting file:///System/Installation/Packages/BaseSystemResources.pkg (destination=/Volumes/SSD [that's my drive name]/.OSInstallSandboxPath/Root, uid=0)\". That's happened even after I erased the disk, and also after I reformatted the drive. I left Internet Recovery to run a download/install overnight, but I woke up to a gray screen that I couldn't escape from. I tried remaking the bootable drive, but still no change. My latest attempt featured an install initiated from the HDD (that's now plugged in where the optical drive used to go), and that hung for literally two hours. What do I have yet to try, or how can I find out if there's a legitimate hardware problem? (A recent Verify Disk claims the SSD's okay.)\n\nA: Install the OS on to each of the components of the \"DIY Fusion Drive\" if the system can install and boot from each, you have ruled out a hardware problem with either of the components.\n\nA: I would contact the vendor about the problem. It sounds like you have a bad block in the SSD that the SSD controller doesn't recognize.\nI read a thread (somewhere...forgot where) where some guys SSD would block at the exact same point every time he tried to do a clone on it. He tried reformatting it and the same problem occurred. He ran Scannerz on it and found a bad block there.  The problem was, the SSD controller wouldn't recognize it as a bad block, which is basically a bug in the controller. The guy ended up sending it back.\nPossibly the vendor may have some special initialization routines that may clear the problem up.\n\nA: The 2011 MacBook Pro models has/had some issues with SATA 3.0 6GB drives (which the SSD is most likely) in the 2nd (optical) bay.

For the curious, yes, I'm looking to do a simple dynamic DNS updater.\n\nA: You could write a launchd that monitors the file path of:\n/private/var/db/dhcpclient/leases/ \nIf you looking for DHCP changes to an interface.\nThat db holds all the different interfaces and dhcp changes on them.

I found numerous reviews on sites like newegg, amazon, bestbuy and so on and many people said they used the drive to upgrade their MBP's. I ended up buying a HD from newegg that said it was for a MBP and it ended up not working for me. I then looked at OWC's HDs and bought an identical one on newegg with the same results. \nThe one that I ordered from newegg was the following: WD Scorpio 750GB\nThe problems that I was having with the new HD's was that their connection would be intermittent.

When it booted back up the second drive (in the dvd drive bay) had a strange name like A[]\\tr/sj or something like that.  My desktop background was the stock Mavericks background.  Google Drive, Skydrive, and Dropbox all complained they couldn't find their respective folders since they were all on the drive that got re-named.\nI restarted again, same thing.  After the second reboot I just renamed the drive and restarted again.  Once it booted up everything was fine.\nAny idea what could have caused this or what it may be a harbinger of?\n\nA: I would run basic permissions & disk checks, just to be sure, but it wouldn't be the first time I'd ever heard of someone [or their cat] accidentally renaming a drive by leaning on Return & a few keys, without being aware that the HD was selected at the time.\nIf you find no disk corruption I'd work on that assumption for now - but I'd also make doubly sure of my backup strategy, on the chance it's a sign of an imminent failure.\n", "Q: How can I change the title of a Safari shortcut or app on iOS? I would like to be able to change the title of a shortcut (especially web shortcuts set as icons). Is this possible?\nFor example, I have a Safari shortcut for Facebook. As an icon, it's labeled \"Facebook\". Can I change that to \"m.facebook\" or something else?\nIf so, how?\n\nA: Names of apps cannot be changed on iOS unless you jailbreak and use some tweak. Although shortcuts made from Safari using \"Add to homescreen\" option can have custom titles. The title cannot be changed once it's been  added to the homescreen.\n\n", "Q: When Screen Sharing, why does the remote screen continually go black? As an ongoing issue (for at least the past three major OS X versions), I find that when trying to remote to another machine using Screen Sharing, the remote screen gets painted completely black. Moving the mouse will result in the area immediately under the pointer being redrawn correctly, and dragging a window (in the remote session) off screen then back on will redraw that window. Sometimes other areas of the screen will redraw themselves (usually when there is an actual change), but most the screen simply remains black, sometimes even repainting back to full black again.\nNetwork connectivity doesn't seem to be a factor; this happens both on a fast LAN and across the Internet with 400-500ms latency. Hardware doesn't seem a factor either; using a range of Mac Minis and Macbooks. Screen sharing sometimes initiated via Remote Desktop, sometimes just clicking on Share Screen in the Finder. While I can work around this glitch (I tend to just SSH in for maintenance), I thought I'd see if anyone out there has any suggestions!\n\nA: I'd second the idea that it may be a RAM issue -- I'm noticing that it happens particularly when:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've got huge uptime on the remote system (so... memory leaks, cruft, have accumulated)\n\n*I switch apps on the remote system (loading things in and out of RAM)\n\n\nFrom practical standpoint, I've found that greping for the the screen sharing daemon and killing it forces the remote machine to respawn a new one that isn't blacked out... but that doesn't last for long:\nps aux | grep screensharingd\nand then sudo kill XXXX once I know what what procid I'm targeting. But that's a really short term solution (buys another 15-90 seconds, usually).\nThe finger the I would also point is at mdutil, the spotlight indexer, which just gets out of control, especially on a system with a lot of large drives with a lot of small files. I've had best success clamping down on Spotlight (which, imho, isn't very useful) and restricting it by either marking most of my drives and directories \"private\".\nIf the remote system is tight on RAM, it may be because Spotlight is being a pig.\n\nA: I have had similar issues with screen sharing, ARD, and Windows RD. I have noticed this happening on all systems(Win, OSX, Linux) whenever the RAM on the Desktop you are accessing gets close to be full. The only solution I have found is to close the connection and reconnect. \n\nA: Does this happen when you have been some time without using the remote computer? I mean, could it be the remote system putting the monitor to sleep? \nIt surely happens to me all the time. I have a 15 minutes sleep interval setup and I tend to forget I have the connection active. After this period of time the shared screen goes black.\n", "Q: Turn off Lock Screen notifications completely, notifications keeps showing even when disabled How can i disable completely the notifications from appearing in the lock screen?\nI unchecked these options:\n\nBut i'm STILL getting an abstract of every notification in the lockscreen so people who don't have my password can still read my chats and emails.\n\nThis is very annoying, help please.\n\nA: What you're trying to do is actually quite simple, but you will have to do it individually for each app. First, make sure you have the latest release of iOS 8 (this is not completely necessary, but recommended). Next, go to the Settings app and scroll down until you find the application you want to disable notifications for on the lock screen. \n\nNow, click that cell and scroll down on the presented screen for \"Notifications\"\n\nNow, on this screen there is a slide that says \"Show in Lock Screen\".

Is there any way to turn on the built-in voice dictation in Yosemite with a voice command (just like we can do using the voice command \"wake up\" in Dragon NaturallySpeaking, or \"Hey Siri\" in Siri)?\n\nA: Apple says:\nEnable Dictation Commands\nBefore you can tell your Mac what you want it to do, you need to turn on Dictation Commands.\n\nWhen you enable advanced commands, you can also create your own\n  commands by clicking the Add Command (+) button. This lets you link a\n  spoken phrase to an app, a menu item, a keyboard shortcut, or an\n  Automator workflow.\n\n", "Q: Changing the dictionary used by OS X Dictation Is there any way to alter the dictionary used by OS X Dictation, i.e. add/edit/remove a word? I use OS X 10.10 a.k.a. Yosemite.\n\nA: OS X Dictation will let you dictate people in your Contacts. Make sure any words you wish to say are included in Contacts (you can place multiple words in the first name or last name fields) and providing you have enabled Enhanced Dictation the words should be available immediately. When dictating, if an alternative word is available, the word will be underlined in blue and selecting an alternate word will, over time, allow it to learn the word as a preferred dictation result. I have not tested deleting a contact and seeing whether the word would remain in the dictation repertoire.\n", "Q: How to use SquidMan and force apps to go through it?

I'm seeking an equivalent of a common Linux based process monitor, which shows a history graph for each CPU core.  This can help identify programs that are effectively using all the cores (here, Google Chrome).  Is there a way to get Apple system monitor to do this?\n\n\nA: Another application which may be helpful (depending on your needs) is Instruments.app included in Xcode.  \nIt doesn't allow a continuous easy monitoring like iStat Menus or Activity Monitor do, due to the fact that some user interaction is needed to set up a sample and start recording it. On the other hand you may monitor single applications – a feature the aforementioned apps don't accomplish.\nFrom a programmer's perspective this may be very useful.\n\nUsage: Instruments Help cmd? -> Viewing Collected Data -> Monitoring Multiple Core Usage\n\nA: You can use Activity Monitor's CPU History.\n\nApplications > Utilities > Activity Monitor.app\n\nWithin Activity Monitor, select the menu item Window > CPU History to reveal a per CPU load history.  The output is not as detailed as the Linux process monitor in your question but it is free.\n\nApple's OS X: Activity Monitor shows one CPU Usage graph on systems with more than four cores explains more about the behaviour of the CPU graph.\nThird party products, such as iStat Menus, are available that extend your options.\n\nA: I don't know of anything with that kind of detail, but Apple's own Activity Monitor [Applications/Utilities] can show a basic history graph per core.  Cmd ⌘    3  to initiate.\n\nSystem shows in red, user in green, btw.\n\nA: There is also iStatMenus, a commercial app, available which allows such stat to be monitored.\n\n\n\n", "Q: Unable to ssh root@localhost on jailbroken iPad with iOS 8.1 I jailbreaked (not for pirates) my iPad 4 (iOS 8.1) several weeks ago and found it unable to ssh root@127.0.0.1 via Prompt 1 or 2 on iPad. Even I cannot connect via LAN IP (e.g. 192.186.X.X). However, there's no problem if I ssh root@LAN IP on my iPhone or Mac in the same LAN.\nBy the way, I was able to ssh root@localhost on jailbreaked iPad when it was running iOS 6.1.

I installed the 32bit and 64bit version.\nI got a MacBook Pro (15\" End 2011) Processor 2,2 GHz Intel Core i7 Storage 16 GB 1333 Mhz DDR3, Intel HD Graphics 3000 512 MB & AMD Radeon HD 6750M, 128 GB SSD\nWhen I boot the Mac and press alt I can select the USB drive. Then it starts GRUB and I can select \"Install Ubuntu\".\nThen black screen appears and the Ubuntu sound appears and then nothing happens.\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: This may not be the answer you are looking for but I thought I'd boot it out there just in case. Assuming you have sufficient RAM (6 - 8GB) it might be easier to install Ubuntu (or any Linux dist.) in a virtual Machine. Parallels and VMWare Fusion are the two big commercial virtualization apps, but I have found that the free (and frequently updated) VirtualBox is easier than doing a dual boot system with the added benefits of it being quite easy to have both running at the same time.\nAs virtualbox is free you could try it and see if it suits your needs...\n\nA: I would start with the Mac App Store option Veertu\nIt's free at launch to run various linux OS and has a paid upgrade for ISO based install options.\nThe benefits of this over other virtualization options are that it runs within the OS X sandbox which makes it less likely to cause crashes and it lets OS X control the battery/power management.\nAlso, many pre-packaged linux installs are one click easy.\n", "Q: Stolen MacBook Pro, encrypted with FileVault. Can they still access it because of a poor password? My MacBook Pro was stolen recently. I had it encrypted using Filevault and it required my password for login after woken from sleep.\nMy password however is just a word of three letters, not abc, def or klm but more like tfj, ksa, ale, etc...\nMy question is this can they still access my files in any way? Via the guest access maybe or by breaking the password?\nGreatly appreciate your answers.\n\nA: yes brute force will get your password in no time.\n\nA: It is possible to brute force a password or recover the recovery key from memory if someone is determined enough.  The guest account by default is a Safari only account.  It would be to your advantage for them to log in to the Guest account as it activates \"Find my Mac\" if they jump on to an internet connection.  From the guest account they will have no access to the machines files.\nIn the future, best practice would be to set a firmware password.  Without a firmware password set they can still have access to the machine.  To be the most secure you should set both filevault 2 and a firmware password.\n", "Q: How to assign tilde to command-tab?

Assume I buy some sort of \"Mac in the cloud\" solution (they exist), can I download apps I'm developing onto my iOS devices from Xcode on this \"remote Mac\" via my iCloud/developer account or do I need physical access to a Mac (usb cable) to do that?\nThis answer seems to indicate that it's not possible to load apps onto local devices from a remote Mac, but he's not sure.\nEDIT: Actually, it seems to be possible to debug too, see my answer below.\n\nA: Yes, if you have a paid developer account you can create signed IPAs which can be installed on the device remotely, or you can use TestFlight. If you don't have a paid developer account but your device is jailbroken you can install unsigned IPAs. Note that this doesn't include debugging which can't be done remotely.\n\nA: Actually, it seems like this software lets you share a usb connection with an ios device between a local mac or non-mac pc and a mac you keep at home or a \"mac in the cloud\".

I drive two Thunderbolt displays with my 2012 Mac Mini with 16GB of RAM and an SSD.  The Mini uses a static amount of RAM for video, it does not adjust based on how much RAM is in the machine.  As an aside, this is a good reason to max out the RAM on a machine with shared video.\nYou have a machine with shared video RAM totaling 1 GB, and you're trying to drive two 1440p displays and one 1080p display, a total of 5.76 MP of video output.

This makes working on a website very efficient.\nThe code editor isn't all that great but I manage with it ok.\nHowever I now have a problem in that Dreamweaver does not support key authentication on any of it's versions.\nI am having to access a website that will only allow access using a key, passwords are off limits.\nI have had a look around and there doesn't seem to be a solution.\n\nA: You haven't really asked a direct question here; But I assume you're asking for a code editor which supports SFTP key auth?\nIn which case, Coda 2 has built in support for each type of connection (including key authentication).\nIf you're after a free alternative, I'd use Cyberduck and Sublime Text. If you open a file from Cyberduck (into Sublime Text), it automatically uploads each time you save.\nIf on the other hand you're looking for a way to use key authentication within Dreamweaver and the software simply doesn't support it, there's no way solve that.\n", "Q: Cisco AnyConnect prevents Continuity from allowing Mac to answer iPhone One of the nicest features of the new OS integration between iOS 8 and Yosemite is the ability to text and receive phone calls from my iPhone while on my Mac. \nHowever, when I work from home, I need to use Cisco AnyConnect to create a VPN network. When the VPN network is active, I can see phone calls from my iPhone on my Mac, but answering the call on my Mac will cause the call to disconnect. Trying to call from my Mac will show the dialog box that I am connecting, but the iPhone never responds. If I am on a call on my Mac, and start up the VPN, the call disconnects.\nI have a 2014 13\" MacBook Pro and an iPhone 5S both running the latest OS with all the patches.\nWhat is going on, and is there a way to fix the problem?\n\nA: Cisco's VPN software typically locks out all local LAN access.  In other words, your Mac is no longer on your network.  It is now tunneled into your VPN connection.\n\nA: It doesn't depend on the client software that you use (Shimo or AnyConnect) but rather on the AnyConnect Profile used to establish connection. In my case I've got two profiles available (one that routes all the traffic via the VPN server and another one that routes selected subnets only). In both cases iPhone calls continuity fails when VPN is on. With VPN off, everything works.\n\nA: Our company just deployed our first Cisco FTD and we had this issue. I spent a few hours with Wireshark to find out what was happening and found a fix relevant to our situation. We are not assigning any IPv6 addresses through the VPN via a pool, and therefore, by default, all IPv6 traffic is DROPPED by the client when Anyconnect is connected! The iPhone dialing works via mDNS (Bonjour), which uses IPv6 on your local home network via address ff02::fb UDP port 5353. Here's how you can configure it so IPv6 transmissions are not dropped when Anyconnect is connected.\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that your VPN is set up for split horizon, so that non-relevant VPN traffic goes through your home's network (i.e. youtube.com). If it is not you will need to contact your company's Cisco engineer and convince him to enable it.\n\n*Make sure that your home network does not overlap with the relevant IP addresses that go through the VPN. If it does, change your home's DHCP IP address range to something else.\n\n*Make sure that you can enable \"Allow local (LAN) access when using VPN (if configured)\" (see first exhibit below) in the Anyconnect client. If this is forcefully disabled, you will need to contact your company's Cisco engineer and convince him to enable it.\n\n*If the VPN profile doesn't have a VPN IPv6 pool, ask your company's Cisco engineer enable \"Client Bypass Protocol\" in the Anyconnect Group Policy settings (see second exhibit below), which will prevent all IPv6 traffic from your home system from being dropped.\n\nYou may have to buy your Cisco engineer a good bottle of scotch or bourbon in order to get this accomplished.\n\n\n", "Q: Map Control+Delete to Forward Delete I use a wireless Apple keyboard at home and a wired (full sized) one at work. Now I constantly get confused when I want to do a forward delete, since I'm used to the fn+delete combination.\nIs it possible to somehow map control+delete to do the same thing? (control is in the same location as fn on the full size keyboard)\n\nA: You can do this with Karabiner with a private.xml such as this:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n  <item>\n    <name>Forward Delete with ⌃⌫</name>\n    <identifier>private.ctrlbackspace</identifier>\n    <autogen>\n      __KeyToKey__\n      KeyCode::DELETE, VK_CONTROL | ModifierFlag::NONE,\n      KeyCode::FORWARD_DELETE\n    </autogen>\n  </item>\n</root>\n\n\nA: For newer versions of Karabiner-Elements you can import one of the predefined rules that are maintained by the community, or look at the JSON definition of those to see how it's done.\nFor example the \"Map Ctrl+Backspace-Delete to Fn+Backward-Delete (suppr current character)\" rule.\nSee https://ke-complex-modifications.pqrs.org/?q=Map%20Ctrl%2BBackspace-Delete\n", "Q: Why \"Settings\" needs Cellular in iOS? I'm getting a similar warning as this one:\n\nWhenever I get to Settings in iOS. I have deactivated Cellular connections for everything (including Settings) but Chrome Browser. \nI'm wondering if anyone know why Settings needs a Cellular connection?\nAs seen on this thread: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6567893\n\nA: Not to start a Greek chorus here but I checked on my iPhone 5 with the latest IOS (8.1.1) wth wifie and cellular data off and I do not get that message either.\nI am thinking that possibly ajkblue is correct and it may be trying to contact Apple's software update servers or your carriers servers for a carrier update. there is likely a timer that forces a check every week or so.\nThe job of settings app is to use all possible connections to check for updates and it’s letting you know you explicitly disable it from using cellular data. You will likely miss security updates and not save any data by stopping these brief checks from using cellular connections.\nIn my case, settings used 80 KB of data this billing period and 210 KB last billing period.\n", "Q: Time Machine files cannot be erased I put Mavericks on my iMac and Time Machine quit updating.  I just want to erase all the TM files on the external HD, but cannot.  Looks like reformating is the only answer. Any solutions? Using SuperDuper! now.\n\nA: Deleting Time Machine backups can take a very long time, since they can contain hundreds of thousands of files. Moving the files to the trash can take a long time, emptying the trash can take a long time, and using command line \"rm\" commands can take a long time. By long time I mean tens of hours.\nUsually the fasted way to remove such numbers of files is to use Disk Utility to erase and/or reformat and/or repartition the drive. Copy anything you don't want lost off of the drive, reformat it, and start the TM process again.\n", "Q: mount encrypted sparseimage as home directory before login There are several ways (loginhook, launchdaemon etc.) to automount a sparsebundle before logging in, but there's none without writing down the password in plaintext for automount an encrypted sparsebundle. \nReading out the password from the keychain requires to unlock it before, therefore it's not possible to automate the process without user action. \n#!/usr/bin/env bash -e\n# SOURCE: http://risponderetag.wpdev8.com/p/35966.html\n\nSPARSEBUNDLE_PATH=\"/Users/Shared/username.sparsebundle\"\nSPARSEBUNDLE_MOUNT_PATH=\"/Users/username/\"\nKEYCHAIN_PATH=\"/Users/username/Library/Keychains/login.keychain\"\n\n# Check existing states\nif [ -e \"$SPARSEBUNDLE_MOUNT_PATH\" ]; then\n    echo \"Already mounted.\"\n    exit 0    \nfi\n\n# The mount command uses security find-generic-password\n# to get the password from the keychain store\nMOUNT_PASSWORD=$(security find-generic-password -w -D \"disk image password\" -l username.sparsebundle $KEYCHAIN_PATH)\nprintf $MOUNT_PASSWORD | hdiutil attach -stdinpass -mountpoint \"$SPARSEBUNDLE_MOUNT_PATH\" \"$SPARSEBUNDLE_PATH\" \n\nFor further informations see:\nCan I mount an encrypted image BEFORE Finder loads?\nhttp://techanic.net/2012/10/14/programmatically_mounting_encrypted_disk_images_in_os_x.html\nQuestion (EDIT):\nAre there other ways to pass a keychain password without using plaintext or user interaction?\n\nA: So depending on the actual use case you are working with I may have an answer for your dilemma. If the location you are mounting to exists prior to actually mounting your disk, logging in before mounting the disk will create a default user filesystem with its very own login keychain. You can log in to a different account, mount the disk and save the password to the keychain, copy the password to the system keychain, and (after unmounting the disk) transfer the password to the unmounted user account login keychain. That item will exist prior to mounting so the disk can be automatically mounted on login. So you should be able to use that password with launch agents. Go into the password options and allow all applications to use it so you are not prompted for anything after it is in its final location.\nIf you cannot get launch agents to work, you can always write a short applescript app to refresh your finder to have the proper desktop to display and put it in the login items of the unmounted account so that it executes after the drive is mounted\ndelay 5\ndo shell script \"killall Finder\"\n\nPut that into the /Users/Shared folder or something so it can be accessed before mounting and the mounting process does not interfere. \nSo that \"kind of\" does not require user interaction at least beyond the process of logging on. I hope that helps!\n", "Q: App for Reading - iPad & PDF I am searching for a application with the following functionality, but cant find one:\nI want to read PDFs.

FOr example, in linux you can boot to a terminal, you don't have to load a desktop, window manager, etc. Is there something like this in Mac OS X? And like in Linux, is it possible to switch to one of these from in the desktop?\n\nA: What you are looking for is called Single-User mode.  Restart the computer, once you hear the start-up chime, hold down Command-S and OS X will load everything but the GUI.  \n\nA: See Apple's Mac OS X: How to start up in single-user or verbose mode.\nOn power up hold the 's' key down. You'll enter single-user mode where the interface is via a full screen terminal window (the console).\nThere are caveats, you are essentially root at that point, and yes you could switch user or execute login.\n\nA: I don't think Single User Mode is really what you want.\nA better idea is to use a console login.\nTo do this, first you have the login window set to show “Name and Password”:\n\nThen you can login as \">console\" as the username (no password) and get a terminal prompt.\nIt's not very pretty, but it's handy if you need it.\n\nA: In addition to what TJ Luoma said, you can also:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the normal login screen, with the list of users.\n\n*Select one (any, it doesn't matter) with the keyboard.\n\n*Press ⌥ Option+↩︎ Return.\n\n*Type >console in the username field, leaving the password blank.\n\n*Press ↩︎ Return and log in. \nUnfortunately I haven't had much luck with this—sometimes it just doesn't show up, with or without an external display.\n\nA: To switch to a console from the desktop just use Terminal.app and maximise it so when you switch to it is the full screen.\nNote that this is not the same as Single User Mode as you will be logged in as a user, so it is like xterm under Linux.\nJust note that Linux and OS X are different and will do things different ways e.g. from the Linux console boot you can start X11 (i.e. the desktop) but not in OS X.\n", "Q: Java issue with osx...installed latest but java apps not working I have an odd issue on my MAC.

A record company is offering free downloads of high-definition music. I downloaded several music files encoded at 24 bit, 192 kHz ALAC. To my surprise, iTunes 12.0.1.26 on  10.10.1 Yosemite imported the track and played it successfully! And it lists that high-resolution information in the file information.\nI had thought that iTunes could not play high definition files. I understood it to be limited to 16 bit, 44.1 kHz files. And so I had thought that special software is required to play anything higher than that.\nSo my question is: When iTunes is playing such files, is it actually playing them at full resolution, or is it down-converting them? (Or whatever the technical term would be for storing or playing the files at something less than full resolution.) I can't tell by ear because I don't have my computer hooked up to good speakers.\n\nA: iTunes uses the same technologies as QuickTime for playback. \nAccording to this document circa 2005, QuickTime is capable of playing 24-bit , 192kHz audio files. I think it's safe to say that iTunes is fully capable of playing these files.\nHowever, you're probably limited by the hardware in your Mac. If you open the \"Audio MIDI Setup\" app, you'll probably find that your Mac is limited to audio output at 96kHz.\n\nSo, if you want to listen to these files in full 192kHz, you'll need to use a dedicated external USB DAC, and bypass your Mac's internal audio hardware. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\nFurther reading: http://www.head-fi.org/t/671361/how-to-get-24-bit-192khz-files-from-my-macbook-pro-to-play-through-the-dac-of-the-fiio-e17\n\nA: I have imported 96/24 AIFF files (downloads from HD Tracks) into iTunes. I play them on my iMac and MBPro (digital optical out from headphone jack to my PreAmp which has a DAC, and recently I switched over to USB just to see if there was a difference). To my knowledge, as long as you have the correct setting in MIDI (change the sample rate and bit rate to the maximum settings of the DAC). iTunes will play HiRes files. However, recently I loaded Audirvana Plus and am playing my iTunes files through Audirvana and there is a difference in sound. That makes me wonder if iTunes was playing the HiRes files in full HiRes properly. Admittedly, Audirvana bypasses a lot of Apple audio circuitry to reduce noise and this may be the explanation. But nevertheless, I am left believing that iTunes doesn't do HiRes music properly. BTW if you are spending all that money on HiRes downloads, just spend the money on Audirvana Plus (or JRiver) and enjoy HiRes music with greater sound quality than iTunes. \n", "Q: How does one add a custom iCloud Drive folder to the Finder Favorites sidebar? Recently, I upgraded to iCloud Drive and began storing a number of files in it. I created a new folder in iCloud Drive (not one of the default \"Pages\" or \"TextEdit\" folders) and put my files in it. However, because I use it so frequently, I would like to put the folder in my Finder sidebar. When I tried to do so, it would not allow me — it simply gave me the option to drag it into an existing folder in the sidebar. It did not even display the circle with the cross through it (\"do not enter sign,\" if you will) that often appears when I attempt to drag a folder to the Favorites bar that cannot be added. However, I was able to add the default iCloud Drive folders (\"Keynote,\" \"Preview\") to the Favorites sidebar without any issues. I have also tried CMD-dragging to create an alias on the sidebar, but to no avail.\nI'm running a late 2013 iMac on OS X Yosemite 10.10.1. \n\nA: A solution is to create a temporary alias of your new folder.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a folder in iCloud Drive.\n\n*Right-click the folder and select Make Alias.\n\n*Drag-and-drop the alias folder (little black arrow on folder symbol) into your sidebar.\n\n*You can now delete the alias folder (NOT in the sidebar).\n\n\nHope this helps, if not leave a comment.\n\nA: Finder -> Preference -> Sidebar -> Check iCloud. All your iCloud folders can now be accessed from the favorites in side bar.\n\nA: It is even easier:\nany folder that you have (created), just drag it to the sidebar: it will stay where it is, and appears in the sidebar. When you right click it in the sidebar you can remove it (the folder stays where it is).\n", "Q: My laptop (Yosemite) is now 'PPPoE' connected over wifi, what is this and what does it mean? My laptop (Yosemite) is now 'PPPoE' connected over wifi, what is this and what does it mean?\n\n\n*\n\n*Previously I was just connected by wifi (there was no mention of wifi)\n\n*My AirPort base station connects to my cable-modem via PPPoE (using an ethernet cable)\n\n\nShould I be worried? It seems to have happened since Yosemite.\nEverything seems to be working fine, but I noticed this when I was recently tightening security on my AirPort.\nEdit: given comments that only the router needs PPPoE, I'm concerned PPPoE is being used to bypass the protections of my Router (AirPort).\nSome screenshots:\n\n\n\nA: It was probably there before Yosemite but you did not see it.\nUsually when your Internet service provider requires it it will be used.\n\nPPPoE stands for Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet. PPPoE has\n  become a favorite technology of broadband Internet service providers,\n  who use it to save time and money. DSL and cable modem subscribers, on\n  the other hand, have reason to be less enthusiastic about PPPoE.\n\nPPPoE Client Overview\n\nPPPoE combines two widely accepted standards, Ethernet and PPP, to\n  provide an authenticated method of assigning IP addresses to client\n  systems. PPPoE clients are typically personal computers connected to\n  an ISP over a remote broadband connection, such as DSL or cable\n  service. ISPs deploy PPPoE because it supports high-speed broadband\n  access using their existing remote access infrastructure and because\n  it is easier for customers to use.\nPPPoE provides a standard method of employing the authentication\n  methods of the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) over an Ethernet network.\n  When used by ISPs, PPPoE allows authenticated assignment of IP\n  addresses. In this type of implementation, the PPPoE client and server\n  are interconnected by Layer 2 bridging protocols running over a DSL or\n  other broadband connection.\n\nYou can set up a new PPPoE or check the current set up.\n\n\nA: Generally speaking, only the router should need any PPPoE login credentials, and all the devices on the local network would get their connection through the router (in your case the AirPort base station), with the router giving them local network information via DHCP. If other devices on the local network are working properly with \"standard\" wireless and wired settings, you should be safe in giving your laptop the same standard settings.\nI would create a new \"location\" in the \"Network\" System Preferences, and set up the laptop without any PPPoE settings and connect it to the router (in your case the AirPort base station). If that works, you can safely change the old \"location\" settings to remove the PPPoE setup, or just delete the old \"location\" setting. I do not recall if deleting the old \"location\" setting will also delete any saved wireless passwords that you might have - so if you delete the old \"location\" setting, you might have to re-enter Aunt Tilda's wireless password when you visit her over the holidays.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro4,1 upgrade OS X from Snow Leopard compatibility with iPhone 5S I've been meaning to upgrade the OS X on my Oct 2008 MacBook Pro4,1 (2.4 GHz, 2GB RAM) forever. I just purchased an iPhone 5S and don't want to get ahead of myself.\nThree (maybe four) inter-related questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the highest OS X upgrade to run smoothly on my MacBook Pro4,1? It is still running OS X 10.6.8. and I just loaded iTunes 11.1.1 and I'm still able to backup the new iPhone 5S running iOS 7.1.1 directly to computer.\n\n*What is the highest pairing of OS X AND iOS AND version of iTunes, that will run smoothly on my computer and still allow me to backup my iPhone to the computer?\n\n*If I upgrade phone to iOS 8.1.1, will I need to upgrade iTunes to ver. 12 and will it run on OS X 10.7.x or will I need to upgrade to 10.8? I thought I saw somewhere that 10.7 was highest OS X to run on my MacBook Pro4,1?\n\nA: According to EveryMac That machine can run any OS up to Yosemite.\nWhether it will run it smoothly or not is a different matter.\nWhatever the figures might say, I've never known a machine to run faster on a newer OS, with perhaps the exception of the jump from Leopard to Snow Leopard…. or the memory handling from Mountain Lion to Mavericks. I've yet to try Yosemite myself...\nAs far as I'm aware, you'll need the latest iTunes to get the latest iOS, so your phone at the moment is stuck in limbo. If you ever need to restore, you'll find Apple will no longer sign iOS 7 on any device that is capable of running iOS 8.\nI don't know whether iTunes 12 will run on Snow Leo; there's one way to find out, but all the steps you are about to take are going to be pushing you firmly in the direction of Yosemite.\nEdit: iTunes 12 needs 10.7.5 at minimum.\nAnother stumbling block is going to be actually getting hold of any OS other than Yosemite. Apple removes previous OSes from the App Store - though you'll find the listing for it, it won't download unless you have previously 'bought' it.\nTL:DR\nApple want you to move to Yosemite, iOS 8 & iTunes 12.\nTrying to avoid any part of that is going to involve finding some dodgy download of Mavericks etc, or finding a friend who already has the installer.\nYour phone will be in limbo on iOS 7, might work for now, but can't be restored without iOS 8.\niTunes 12 requires a higher OS than you have.\n\nA: iTunes 12 will not run on Snow Leopard; but, iTunes 11 is sufficient for a 5S running iOS8.

I can also put the computer to sleep and it will wake in the proper mode (headphone vs. speakers). Is there a way to reset whatever is causing this problem without restarting?\n\nA: Double check to make sure there is no dirt in the headphone port - there is at least one sensor there that might be dirty and making it hard for the system to tell what is or is not plugged into the port. Blow it out with compressed air and/or carefully remove whatever is in it with a toothpick.\nhttp://www.instructables.com/id/How-To-Clean-A-HeadPhone-Jack/\nIn many Macs, the headphone jack also has optical audio output in the same port, so if some dirt is in there, the system might think an optical cable in plugged in, so the headphone circuit will be turned off. If the system preferences says \"digital\", than probably this is what has happened.\n", "Q: Set Print Range in Numbers.app Is there any way to set a print range in Apple Numbers.app spreadsheets, to print just a subset of cells rather than entire document?\n\nA: Apple's Numbers is designed in a fundamentally different way than Microsoft's Excel or other spreadsheet solutions.  Numbers uses \"Canvases\" instead of large tables of thousands of columns and rows.  This allows for placing tables, even those made up of a single cell, anywhere on the canvas needed.  Instead of merging cells and hiding borders, (which of course can be done with Numbers) Numbers allows more freedom to create a document designed for printing.  For example, placing text, charts or even graphics anywhere on the canvas that seems logical.  Setting the print range in Excel only allows for a continuous subset of cells.  Also, the ability to have several tables on a single canvas allows for more creative use of the space.  (See this Apple Support article on printing with Numbers.)\nOne can still use a very large data set in a large table as well.  However, this concept of making spreadsheets on canvases can open up many opportunities for print layouts.  The OP does not state how their spreadsheet is laid out, but it appears from the brief description that is styled in a traditional manner, which is perfectly acceptable, but this limits how it can be presented for printing.\nOne method I use, particularly with printing off invoice or expense type sheets, is to keep the working data on a separate sheet from my print sheet.  Using formulas, such as one would use in Excel, data can be easily and automatically\ndisplayed in a printable format.\nBelow is a very simple example.  The Data sheet contains the data not for printing.  The [Print] sheet contains two simple tables with a colored rectangle object in the background.  Changing data in the Data sheet changes the totals in the Print sheet accordingly.  In the case of a traditional spreadsheet, a subset of the table could be displayed in the print sheet, each cell with a reference to the corresponding data sheet cells desired to be printed.  This table could then be formatted for printing by adjusting fonts, size and scaling as noted in the Apple Numbers Help link above.\n\nData Sheet [Non print]\n\n\nPrint Sheet\n\n\nPrint Sheet - Print view\n\n\nA: Select the menu item File > Print, then use the controls on the right to scale the content:\n\n\nA: Looking at the image in this answer, I got inspired to try something and what I discovered is that if you play with the \"content scale\", adjusting the percentage or sliding the scale's button, you can achieve the same effect as window's print range moving of the blue lines. I did have to delete a couple of rows (that were empty to begin with) to make 4 pages turn into 2), so its not as convenient as Window's blue lines, but one can still make it work :)\n\nA: Copy the selection to the clipboard, then choose \"New from Selection\" in the Preview app. Job done!\n", "Q: Is there any way to not boot Finder at startup? Is there a way in OS X to change the desktop from Finder to something else (for example KDE from Fink)?\nBasically, I want Finder to not boot up at startup, so no icons, no dock (but keep the menu bar)\n\nA: I don't know if this still works; but in 10.6 you could define a different application to run in place of Finder.  I did this for a iChat stand-alone \"kiosk\" once.\nFor example:\ndefaults write com.apple.loginwindow Finder /Applications/iChat.app\n\nWhen you logout and login, the application you designated (in my case, iChat) will start.  I suppose you could set this to XQuartz; but, again, I haven't tried it myself.\nTo back out the changes:\ndefaults delete com.apple.loginwindow Finder\n\n", "Q: Purchase a MagSafe 2 Cord Only? My dog decided it wanted to make my MacBook Air Charger (MagSafe 2) his new chew toy. Is it possible to buy just the cord that connects to the charger and the MacBook Air?\nI can only find the charger box (for lack of a better term) and not just the cord which is what I need.\n\nA: I'm assuming you're talking about the detachable AC Cord (http://support.apple.com/en-us/ht2346) \nAmazon has one for US outlets:  http://www.amazon.com/Power-Adapter-Extension-Apple-Macbook/dp/B009OA61UK\nBut, it is not an official Apple part, and (especially when it comes to power supplies) you might feel safer to stay with the sanctioned parts.\nYour best bet for a real cord is to find a friend with a MacBook who plugs their charger directly into the wall, and ask them for their spare cord.  \n", "Q: Invisible folder after usage of trash-cli Recently, I decided to install trash-cli on my MacBook Pro after using it successfully on my Ubuntu machine. To set it up I ran the following commands.\ngit clone https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli.git\nsudo python setup.py install\n\nAfter installation, I decided to delete a folder using trash-put. So I run trash-put ~/anaconda/. However, this folder has never arrived in my .Trash folder, yet it disappeared from my Finder (see below, sorry for the mess of files).\n\nSo far so good, the folder disappeared. However, when running locate anaconda in a Terminal window the folder Anaconda is still there (only the first couple of lines are shown in the screenshot below).\n\nNow, my question is whether any of you guys could have an idea on how I can delete this folder or at least make it re-appear in my Finder?\nSo far, I've tried restarting my MacBook without success.

What exactly are these \"domain\" and \"service targets\" and how do I associate them with plists for use by launchd?\nOS X 10.10 introduces a new launchctl API for managing LaunchDaemons and launching plists. Log messages and man pages suggest that keys like KeepAlive and RunAtLoad should no longer be used and that subcommands enable; bootstrap; and kickstart should be used in preference to load -w and unload -w\nHowever it is not clear from the man pages how to associate a plist with the \"domain\" and \"service target\" it talks about and without which these commands cannot be used with existing plists that seemingly were quite sufficient for OS X 10.9\nFor example [updated]:\nA basic plist we are trying to \"launch\"; seemingly bootstrapped into \"system\" domain but subsequently not recognised in \"system\"\n# pwd\n/Library/LaunchDaemons\n# cat com.iainhouston.django.plist\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC -//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\nhttp://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd >\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n     <key>Label</key>\n     <string>com.iainhouston.django</string>\n     <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n     <array>\n          <string>/usr/local/virtualenvs/django.iainhouston.com/bin/gunicorn</string>\n          <string>--bind=127.0.0.1:49202</string>\n          <string>--workers=2</string>\n          <string>superlists.wsgi:application</string>\n     </array>\n     <key>Disabled</key><false/>\n</dict>\n</plist> \n# launchctl bootstrap system com.iainhouston.django.plist\n/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.iainhouston.django.plist: Service is disabled \n# launchctl enable system/com.iainhouston.django.plist \n# launchctl kickstart system/com.iainhouston.django.plist\nCould not find service \"com.iainhouston.django.plist\" in domain for system  \n\nMotivation\nThe system log records that launchctl -w load ... complains when we use KeepAlive with RunAtLoad that This service is defined to be constantly running and is inherently inefficient. so we are motivated to use the new interface.\nNot only that, we have significant problems with excessive processor usage that we want to control by providing the appropriate on-demand keywords so, again, we are motivated to understand how to interact with the new launchd .... not easy with the docs as they stand!\n\nA: If you can, file a bug with Apple regarding incomplete or unclear documentation.\nlaunchd appears to have been rewritten for OS X 10.10 and is likely still in flux for a few minor versions yet.\nDomains and service targets appear to be an abstraction of the various folders available for launchd job tickets. They also allow a means for launchctl commands to target specific sessions; a feature that should allow a launchctl command to affect other user sessions.\nHowever, as of OS X 10.10.1, the launchd.plist man page makes no mention of deprecated KeepAlive or RunAtLoad keys.\nApple suggest avoiding KeepAlive and RunAtLoad because the intention is to avoid ever launching a process without a guarantee of work to be done. Both keys remain and are required for many tasks. \nThe best reference document remains Technical Note TN2083, Daemons and Agents. This document provides a great insight into launchd and Apple's intentions towards how background processes should be implemented.\n\nA: You are close, but you should not have the .plist part in the enable and kickstart commands.\nHere is some code we use to associate it to a domain and service target for a user. $UID is basically your userid.\nlaunchctl bootstrap gui/$UID /Library/LaunchAgents/com.yourcompany.yourapp.plist\nlaunchctl enable gui/$UID/com.yourcompany.yourapp\nlaunchctl kickstart -k gui/$UID/com.yourcompany.yourapp\n\n", "Q: What is this line on my dock? I recently upgraded to Yosemite and I seem to have some sort of line on my desktop near the dock that won't go away.  I've changed my background, moved the dock and even rebooted and it stays there.  It looks like something that I can click on and drag up but it doesn't do anything if I click on it.  Did I install something that is causing this? \n\nA: Moving the downloads folder to a new position on the Dock and then moving it back takes care of the problem without using Terminal. Great solution for non-technical people! :)\n\nA: This is a progress bar under Downloads folder. It sometimes doesn't go away after completing the downloads. One solution for this is to enter this command in Terminal: \nkillall Dock\n\nThis will reset the Dock.\n\nA: This problem persists since Mavericks. I really don't know why Apple hasn't fixed this yet. The only workaround that I know of is a restart or the killall Dock command in terminal.\n", "Q: Prevent auto-pairing for certain devices (Bluetooth) I have a Early 2011 Macbook Pro 13\" running OS X 10.10.1 (Yosemite). \nAt work, I have a Apple Magic Trackpad and an Apple Wireless Keyboard, both which use Bluetooth. When I get to work, my Mac automatically connects to both of them (if Bluetooth is on).\nAt home, I have a Belkin F8Z492-P Bluetooth Audio Adapter hooked up to my stereo (sorry, no product page available). If Bluetooth is on, my audio will automatically be routed to the Bluetooth adapter (which is something I rarely want). \nHow can I make OS X automatically connect to my trackpad and keyboard at work but not automatically connect to the bluetooth audio adapter at home? \nCurrently, I shut Bluetooth off when I get home, but I'd like to avoid toggling Bluetooth when I get home/when I get to work, since it is quite annoying to start typing on the wireless keyboard and have nothing happen, or not have audio when I get home.\nIf this is not possible, can I prevent OS X from switching my audio automatically when connecting to the Bluetooth audio adapter?\n\nA: I had the same problem and FINALLY found a workable solution. Run this in your terminal. After this you just need to manually connect to your bluetooth audio system.\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist DontPageAudioDevices 1\n\n\nA: This is a bit of a long shot, but at home go into System Preferences > Sound > Output and manually select the Default option (Usually Speakers).\nThis means that OS X will re-prioritise so that when the Belkin F8Z492-P Bluetooth Audio Adapter becomes available, you'd rather use the default option.\nThen, when you want to use it, select it via the AirPlay menu (if possible) because that doesn't affect OS X's priorities. If it is not available via the AirPlay menu then you will just have to manually switch forward and back with the System Preferences app, unless you feel like diving into some AppleScripting.\n\nA: I have Bluetooth headphones for which none of the previous solutions worked. By headphones were pretty cheap and I discovered that my Macbook Pro 2019's initial connection for auto-pairing was terrible (audio consistently skipped), but after disconnecting and reconnecting it was fine. I originally came to this post before Big Sur and back then adding my headphones’ MAC address to the list of IgnoredDevices (see answer from Kiyose) worked. But after Big Sur (currently on 11.4), neither DontPageAudioDevices nor adding to IgnoredDevices worked for me. This could be due to the shoddy implementation of Bluetooth on my cheap headphones, probably not uniquely due to Big Sur. In fact, connecting to my headphones totally messed up the Bluetooth module to the point where it couldn’t be turned on/off, and none of the traditional solutions (e.g. reset bluetooth module, Bluetooth → Debug, delete .plist files, etc.), other than reboot, could fix it. Obviously didn't want to have to reboot my Mac every time I wanted to connect headphones. So I came up with this solution for Bluetooth devices that are so problematic that you need to disconnect and unpair every time. This solution requires blueutil.\n\n*\n\n*Install blueutil:\n\nhomebrew install blueutil\n\n\n\n*Use Automator (or any similar application) → Quick Actions → Run Shell Script with workflow set to receive no input and work in any application. Create two scripts that contain blueutil commands to pair/connect and unpair/disconnect to your bluetooth device. Note I found I needed to include full path for Automator's shell to find blueutil, perhaps because it is not being run interactively. You can confirm your scripts are working by monitoring System Preferences → Bluetooth and using the Run button in Automator, before proceeding to the next step.\n\n# pair/connect\n/usr/local/bin/blueutil --pair <MAC_ADDRESS_OF_BT_DEVICE>\nsleep 5\n/usr/local/bin/blueutil --connect <MAC_ADDRESS_OF_BT_DEVICE>\n\n# unpair/disconnect\n/usr/local/bin/blueutil --disconnect <MAC_ADDRESS_OF_BT_DEVICE>\n/usr/local/bin/blueutil --unpair <MAC_ADDRESS_OF_BT_DEVICE>\n\n\n\n*Set up keyboard bindings to the Automator quick actions with System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Services. The new actions should be under General if you set to receive no input.\n\nNow when you turn your bluetooth device on, simply use your keyboard shortcut to pair/connect. And when you're done, turn it off and run the disconnect/unpair action.\n\nA: Adding MAC address of a device to IngoredDevices disables auto connect of Bluetooth. To do so follow these steps:\n\n*\n\n*disable Bluetooth.\n\n\n*find MAC address in DeviceCache with following command\nsudo defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist DeviceCache\n\n\n\n*add MAC address to IgnoredDevices\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist IgnoredDevices -array-add '<MAC ADDRESS>'\n\n\n\n*print contents of the file, you should see there MAC address which has been added in step 3\nsudo defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist IgnoredDevices\n\n\n\n*restart your Mac\n\n\n*enable Bluetooth\nThis should work on Mojave and Catalina.\n", "Q: How can I print a PDF/X Mavericks document? A few iterations ago, Mac OS X had a \"Save as PDF-X\" option available via the print dialogue, with an associated file at /Library/PDF Services/Save As PDF-X.workflow that handled the magic suff I assume.\nMy understanding is that the PDF/X format embeds fonts and does other \"preflight\" stuff to make a document good for printshops to use. Outputting in this format is possible with Illustrator and other Adobe products, but I would produce a printshop-ready PDF/X file using software I already have (LibreOffice, Word, etc.)\nIn Mac OS X 10.9, this \"Save as PDF-X\" option is nowhere I can find.\nIs there any simple way to create PDF/X format files?\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/?title=PDF/X\nBack in 2010, Philip Regan gave some info about doing it with the then present \"Save as PDF-X\" feature, but it is no longer part of the print dialogue.\nHow can I print a PDF X-1A from a iWork Pages document?\nAnyone have any ideas?\n\nA: Create an Automator print plugin that prints as a PDF-X.\nOpen Automator.app\nSelect \"Print Plugin\" at the Choose a type for your document screen\nSelect \"PDF\" from the Actions menu\nDrag \"Apple Quartz Filter to the PDF Documents\" to the workflow space on the right\nWhen prompted choose if you want to create a copy of the original, add or don't add\nIn the Apply Quartz Filter to PDF Documents workflow, in the Filter dropdown, choose \"Create Generic PDFX-3 Document\".\nChoose File-->Save\nName whatever you like (PDFX)\nThis will add a workflow back that allows for PDFX again. The workflow is saved in your user directory ~/Library/PDF Services/\n\nA: The problem with using Automator is that is doesn't easily allow you to bring up a file dialog, so you have to save it to a preset location.\nThe other problem (worse) is that Apple's \"Generic PDF/X-3 document\" Filter is pretty hopeless, and does not always produce a compliant document. It also has terrible transparency settings.\nA better PDF/X-3 Quartz Filter can be found here, and a PDF Service that applies the better filter to the outgoing PDF data, before bringing up a save dialog, can also be found here.\n", "Q: Switch to another app's active window only Command+Tab and Command+Shift+Tab - toggles between apps\nCommand+` and Command+Shift+` - toggles between windows of the currently active app\nIs there a way to switch to another app but only to the most recently active window (so that it doesn't dredge up the rest of the app's windows)?\nI have multiple windows open for some apps and having this would be very handy especially if I have one has limited screen space.\nIf not available, is there a way to create such a shortcut through System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts for all applications?\nThanks!\n\nA: There seem to be two proprietary programs that do solve this problem, but there isn't a way to set it up yourself using a keyboard shortcut.\nThe two apps are Witch (as suggested by Buscar웃) and Contexts, in case someone wanted to check them both out.

I set up the Gmail/Google Calendar/Google Contacts on my iPhone as an Exchange Account many years ago.  Google discontinued this in 2013 for all new users, though it still worked for me (until Nov 17th).  Google now uses CardDAV for Contacts and CaIDAV for Calendar (since 2013).

OS/X command line tools derive from BSD sources which process command line arguments differently. This all boils down to usage of the library calls like getopt() in the standard C-library. OS/X command line tools use the standard library functions whereas GNU command line tools use their own, similar, but slightly more \"advanced\" version of getopt() and companions.\nThat said, you could work around that by installing GNU coreutils. One way of doing that would be to use Homebrew.

I'm trying out Platypus, which seemed like the simplest option. The problem I'm running into is with the packages I'm including in the script. I installed them through pip into a virtualenv. Wondering what the best/most proper way to include those files in the Platypus bundle would be. I know I could just copy them over to the same directory and include them in the Platypus bundle, but would prefer to do something cleaner like including the virtualenv, although it seems like that would then have to be installed by the users of the app.\nI also ran into py2app which seems to be able to achieve something similar to Platypus, but their documentation is somewhat obscure.\n\nA: The way I've solved this is in the past is by bundling the contents of the virtualenv directory into Platypus and then activating the bundled Python interpreter with a script.\nHere's a screencap of the Platypus interface to show you what I mean:\n\nYou'll notice that I've bundled the entire venv directory (which was created with the virtualenv command), and my Python script, my_app.py.\nThe script that I'm actually telling Platypus to run, run.sh, is a shell script with the following contents:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n\"$PWD/venv/bin/python\" my_app.py \"$@\"\n\nAll this script does is use the python binary in the venv directory to run the bundled Python script.

Is it possible to import configurations that have been created elsewhere into Little Snitch? For example, a ready to go basic ruleset for someone who wants to block iCloud's more intrusive features. Is this possible? Do such communities exist that share these?\n\nA: Looking at your original question, it's 3 years old. As of Little Snitch 4, you can in fact subscribe to \"Rule Groups\". Same end result, for the most part. These two links provide enough information to create your own Rule Groups, or simply subscribe to theirs:\nSteven Black\nexample as Little Snitch Rule Groups (it's a translation of Steven Black's but there are scripts to make your own too)\n\nOne is from Steven Black on git (search for that if the link ever breaks). The other is a lesser known github user that has provided python script to convert hosts file from the former into Rule Group format. That format can be found in Little Snitch’s help pages. Here is an example.\n{\n  \"description\" : \"This rule group demonstrates the subscription of a blocklist. It’s for demo purposes only.\\n\\nIt lets you try out the subscription procedure and the available configuration options. You can rename the group, enable\\/disable either individual rules or the entire group, specify the update interval, and more.\",\n  \"name\" : \"Blocklist Example\",\n  \"rules\" : [\n    {\n      \"action\" : \"deny\",\n      \"process\" : \"any\",\n      \"remote-domains\" : \"tracking-server.example.com\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\" : \"deny\",\n      \"process\" : \"any\",\n      \"remote-domains\" : \"ads.example.com\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\" : \"deny\",\n      \"process\" : \"any\",\n      \"remote-domains\" : \"adserver.example.com\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\" : \"deny\",\n      \"process\" : \"\\/Applications\\/Safari.app\\/Contents\\/MacOS\\/Safari\",\n      \"remote-hosts\" : \"user-tracking.example.com\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\" : \"deny\",\n      \"process\" : \"\\/Applications\\/Safari.app\\/Contents\\/MacOS\\/Safari\",\n      \"remote-hosts\" : \"usage-analyzer.example.com\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nOnce you navigate to this particular file on GitHub, eg, you would want the link provided when you click \"download\". Paste that into Little Snitch where it requests a URL. \nYou can even copy them to your own repo and subscribe to that, as well. I recommend this, since relying on a 3rd party not to have their rule group compromised (which is web-based) is just one extra possible attack vector. In my case, I just forked this particular user's repo and I manage it on my own. \nHope this helps. \nP.S. - I think the other answer on here is outdated. Simply linking to a \"list\" of hostnames doesn't help the user much. Little Snitch has done away with this sort of busy work through the addition of Rule Groups. \n\nA: Yes, there are pre-built rule sets, and someone shares them.\nI just stumbled upon this:\nLittle Snitch rules for blocking ad servers\nHere they provide a list of pre-built rules for blocking ad-servers.\nIt is not related specifically to iCloud, but in general yes, there are shared sets of rules for Little Snitch.\nEdit: now I see what Dylan was referring to with \"are you going to manually...\". A little explanation is in order.\nAt the time, the only way (I thought) was to copy the list and paste it into Little Snitch ruleset. It was not a difficult process (literally, cmd+c, cmd+v on Mac) but the \"Rule Group Subscription\" on LS makes it even easier.\nThe website I posted earlier now provides a link to the subscription: click and be happy.\nI guess Dylan's answer and mine provide a couple of alternatives for subscriptions, but I wouldn't know the difference. I admit that I stumbled upon pgl.yoyo.org just by chance.\nFurther edit: It seems that Steven Black (linked in Dylan's answer) collects a few sources, including yoyo, so I'd say it is more comprehensive (more rules is better?).\n\nA: I've found these rules https://github.com/naveednajam/Little-Snitch---Rule-Groups also based on https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts to be the most effective for general ad and track blocking.\nAnd for writing your own rule group subscription list this is Little Snitch's official lsrules reference https://help.obdev.at/littlesnitch/ref-lsrules-file-format\n", "Q: Mail.app message selection gets reset when clearing the search box If I search for something in my mailbox, select the message I'm interested in, then clear the search box (because I want to see the other messages that came in around the same time), the selection resets and I lose my selected message.\nI thought there was once some option like \"View message in mailbox\" that could be used to select a given message without filtering out everything else, but I can't find it anywhere.  \nAm I imagining things?

Normally you can change this via the chsh command, but iOS7 doesn't have this command. so you need to edit /etc/passwd and /etc/master.passwd (as root) and change the shell for the user mobile to /bin/bash.\nSo it should look like:\nmobile:*:501:501:Mobile User:/var/mobile:/bin/bash\n\nafter changing from:\nmobile:*:501:501:Mobile User:/var/mobile:/bin/sh\n\nNote: in the master.passwd file the '*' will be your encrypted password.\n", "Q: MacBook Internet Recovery \"?\" Folder With my 2012 MacBook Pro, I'm trying to reinstall Mac OS X (any version that will work) onto a new Solid State Drive that replaced a broken one.

Backup encryption is enabled.\n\n*A PowerBook G4 running 10.5, which also backs up to the server. Backup encryption is not supported by 10.5.\n\n\nIn the case of the 10.10 MacBook, I understand that setting the MacBook to encrypt backups means that the backups stored on the server will be in an encrypted sparse image. However, the data being sent to the server is sent in the clear, unless the client handles encryption (unlikely).\nCould the data transfer be secured by SSH for both machines?\n\nA: The easiest way to be sure that all your clients' backups are encrypted is to create an encrypted sparse (bundle) image using Leopard (10.5) on the server using hdutil. The newer versions of OSX should be able to read/write to the older encrypted volume without a problem. \nHere is an example using a Linux AFP server...\nhttp://www.cognizo.com/2012/04/encrypted-network-backups-with-os-x-time-machine/\nAnd another\nhttp://bubba.org/wiki/Encrypted_Remote_Backups_with_Sparse_Bundles\nThis way all data encryption/decryption is done at the client end. Problem sovled.\n\nA: You could use a product like SSHFS that uses MacFUSE, which would mount a directory on the remote SSH server as a filesystem, and all transactions over the wire would be encrypted.  You can also use a utility like EncFS which is a file-based loopback encryption layer on top of an existing volume or filesystem like AFP.\nI would agree with the above poster -- I'd create and mount a sparse bundle or drive image over the network that is encrypted.  From there on out, if it is mounted, anyone watching the network traffic will only see encrypted data going across.\n", "Q: Jailbroken, supervised iPhone. Is it bricked? I received this iPhone 4 from work, and they don't have access to the Mac used to supervise it anymore. According to this Apple support article, device supervision can be removed by using \"Erase All Content and Settings\". Unfortunately, I just found out that the device was jailbroken so \"Erase All Content and Settings\" will put it on a bootloop. I can't seem to put the device on DFU mode; is this because it's supervised? Is there anything I can do to unsupervise this device?\nEDIT: I finally managed to put it to DFU mode! Took a few tries, and had to exit/relaunched my iTunes a few times before it showed up as a device there. As @grgarside mentioned below, recovery mode should have worked too, but somehow my iTunes kept either not recognizing the device when on recovery mode, or it says that the device is supervised by another computer so it can't be used with mine.\n\nA: You should be able to put the device in DFU mode even if it is supervised. Recovery mode should work too—both should let you restore the device in iTunes.\n", "Q: How can I change DPI on OS X? Simple question, can't find a single simple answer on the entire internet.

I want to run at a 1280 x 800 scaled resolution. \nI know you can change this in the display settings, but then you see a horrible blur because of the hardware upscaling.

My photos are spread across 17 seemingly randomly named folders in my iPhone 5's DCIM directory.\nI can't make any sense of this and it is quite painful looking through all of these directories to find the photo I'm looking for.\nWhy is my device doing this and can I make it stop?\n\n\nA: These \"randomly named folders\" are consistent with the Design rule for Camera File system (DCF) that Apple and all modern digital cameras use.\nFrom the Wikipedia article on DCF: (emphasis my own)\n\nDirectory and file structure\nThe filesystem in a digital camera contains a DCIM (Digital Camera Images) directory, which can contain multiple subdirectories with names such as \"123ABCDE\" that consist of a unique directory number (in the range 100…999) and five alphanumeric characters, which may be freely chosen and often refer to a camera maker. These directories contain files with names such as \"ABCD1234.JPG\" that consist of four alphanumeric characters (often \"DSC_\", \"DSC0\", \"DSCF\", \"IMG_\"/\"MOV_\", or \"P000\"), followed by a number.\n\nMy Sony digital camera creates a single 101MSDCF subdirectory by default, and I can manually create more if I wish, which it names 102MSDCF, 103MSDCF, etc. Whereas my iPad seems to create a folder for each 30-day period. (?)\nIf the iPad is mounted as a \"USB mass storage device\" then you should see this directory structure in Windows Explorer. However, if using another application or  \"protocol\" then you probably won't. For instance, I can use Paint.NET (Windows) to \"Acquire\" photos from my iPad using the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) - using this method hides the underlying directory structure.\n\nA: Your information is stored in files, but also in databases.  There's a database somewhere that holds the metadata describing some event and bridging that event with the file location.  To you it looks random: to the phone though, it doesn't care where the file is stored as long as it has an entry in the database.\nThink of the database as being a type of \"table of contents\" - a page of information can live anywhere in the book and the reader might not care where, as long as they can find it.\nIn short, what you're looking at makes sense to the phone, and was never meant to make sense to you, because you're not supposed to be looking at it from this view.  You're supposed to look at it through some other app (someone mentioned Photo Gallery - I don't know if that's true but it sounds likely).\n\nA: I too have been rather bemused, trying to make sense of the folder / directory naming of recent months.\nThe folders were always oddly named, but it wasn't random - from looking at my various iOS devices in the past (of which I currently have three), all of them seemed to be working on some kind of predefined sequence in terms of the folder names served up (in my case) under Win Explorer in Windows 8.1. Each one of these 'folders' was named with an 8 alphanumerical character name, and would contain up to 1000 images, before moving on to the next one.\nThen along came iOS 8. First of all, they seemed to be allowing predefined (by iOS) folders to get endlessly bigger than just 1000 pics. At one point I have 3500 in one of the folders. Then, either iOS 8.1 or 8.1.1 (I forget) changed things, so that pictures were contained in an individual folder for each month. On my iPhone 4s and iPad Mini 2, these are still running on a predefined title (i.e. they both use the same folder names compared side by side, so not random). On my iPhone 5c, every time I plug in my phone, the folders are labelled differently, so this is truly random it would seem. I concur with you that countless folders are being created; even if you only take one picture a month for 12 months, you'll see 12 folders for each of those calendar months (I believe).\nMy 4s, Mini 2 and 5c are all running iOS 8.1.2. I have no idea why the 5c is behaving differently; to summarise all are creating 8 digit named folders for each month of pictures, but only the 5c is doing this randomly every time I unplug and plug it back in to the USB port. As someone else said above, the iPhone uses some kind of light-SQL database to store and dictate all sorts of things, and I think the folders are generated 'virtually' from this, so there must be something weird going on in that DB on my 5c (and prob your device, from what you've described) that probably only Apple can answer.....\nI hope in some way that helps, if nothing else to agree you're not the only baffled here! :-)\n\nA: *\n\n*Just place yourself on the DCIM folder and choose to search.\n\n*Search for *.*\n\n*Choose some thumb nail view\n\n*Sort result by name\n\n\nYou will see all your pictures in order and it's easy to find the picture you are looking for.\n\nA: When I connect my iPhone 4s (running latest iOS 8) via USB to my WIN7 PC, I also see those random DCIM subfolders, which are changing their names (that's really weird!) every time reconnecting the iPhone to the PC.\nThe good news: I found out that every subfolder includes photos from a certain month only. However, the random subfolder file names (3 digits, 5 letters) do not correlate to any dates, which makes it hard to find the latest photos, e.g.\nThe bad news: Unfortunately I also don't know how to get rid of the given problem when using Windows explorer to directly access the iPhone photos via USB.\nInterestingly for the same iPhone WIN XP is showing ALL the photos in a single folder, where ALL photos can be viewed and sorted the usual way.\nOlder iPhone 4 (which does not support iOS 8) also is showing all photos (having very different dates, especially different months and years) in a single subfolder.\nUpdate 2015/10/06 (by Hardy): After updating to iOS 9.0.2, the DCIM folder is back to single and simple DCIM subdirectories, for example the Windows Explorer now is showing subdirectory 100APPLE for all photos up to IMG_0999.JPG, subdirectory 101APPLE for photos starting IMG_1000.JPG and so on.\n\nA: Apple appear to have gone for a more sane approach on iOS9 - the folders are generated at a far lesser frequency and they are sequentially named so you can easily navigate. Updating to iOS9 on this device restructured my folders shown in the original question to the below:\n\nIf you are on an earlier version of iOS the workaround suggested by others works well. Just do a wildcard search (*) and sort the results by file name. \n\nA: Those folders have never appeared on any of the dozens of iOS devices I've looked at the DCIM folder. Newer iOS seem to accumulate folders more readily so it's something you might need to adapt to. \nIf you want to see if this is the OS, make a full backup of the phone and then erase it using the settings app to erase all content and settings. At that point, don't restore the backup and just run the normal iOS apps and take a photo or two. \nYou should see the typical DCIM/ folder with just .MISC and 100APPLE sub folders. Then you can track whether a third party app or just an accumulation of various photos is causing the folder structure to grow. \n\nA: THIS IS NOT RANDOM - I have this same situation my iPhone 5C running i0S 7.1.2. \nAt first I thought it was random too, especially because of the folder names, but then I realized that every time you take a photo it names it the next sequenial number and each folder is a different set of 1000. One folder has 0001-0999, then 1000-1999, 2000-2999, etc. Because you've deleted photos you won't have all the numbers from 0001 to 0999, 1000 to 1999, but each time it starts a new set of thousands it's makes a new folder. Therefore you can sort by \"name\" and it will put them in numberical order and therefore in the order they were taken. Evidence: I just tested this by 1) checking each DCIM subfolder to see if each of them was from the same set of 1000, and 2) by taking a few photos and checking the folder and seeing if they were named in sequential order. There is one folder that seems to have images that I've saved from friends too. \nWhy is it like this? I'm not sure why the folders have weird names, but I believe the archiving could have something to do with iCloud backup. If you replace your phone and load from backup it helps the phone not start back from 0001, but carry forward from the last number taken by the previous phone. How do I know it carries forward from the previous phone? Well I had my iPhone 4 replaced twice and then I purchased my 5C and I've loaded all of them from a previous backup and my photos have never started back to 0001. Also grouping them in thousands might help with less corruption during uploading and/or if corruption occurs it's less photos then if they were all in one file. \n", "Q: How to stop two phones ringing when one is called? My husband's and my phones both ring when either one is called.  How do we unlink them?\n\nA: You shouldn't have to disable FaceTime entirely, just turn off the other slider labeled \"iPhone Cellular Calls\".\n\nA: You must be using the same Apple IDs.\n2 options:\n\n*\n\n*Remove Apple ID from one of the phones, create a different one, and add the new one to one of the phones. This means you will have 2 different accounts with Apple, different email associated to it and different content (messages, apps, etc)...but don't worry, you can still share your purchases made with your current Apple ID with the new Family Share settings.\n\n\n*If having 2 different Apple accounts is not an option, then remove FaceTime. Go to Settings > FaceTime > \"turn the green switch off\". This will turn of FaceTime calls coming into that phone only.\n", "Q: What Causes rMBP Fan Noise When Connected to Two External Monitors Connecting two external monitors to my Retina Macbook Pro 2012 has no problem except for more fan noise, which is a little bit annoying since with one external monitor one doesn't hear the noise at all. \nI'm wondering what's the cause of this? What is the bottleneck here? Is it because GPU Clock Speed or Memory of Graphics Card?\nrMBP 2012 has Nvidia GeForce GT 650M with 1 GB GDDR5. If I switch to rMBP 2013/2014 which has Nvidia GeForce GT 750M with 2 GB GDDR5 and say if the problem disappears (I'm just guessing), is it mainly because of higher GPU speed or more memory? \nBtw, 650M scores 1278 while 750M scores 1461.\nUpdate 01/25/15: iStat Menu: \niStat Menu monitors both CPU/GPU usage and temperature. Compared to only one external monitor, two external monitors causes CPU & GPU temperature up by 20F higher. However, CPU & GPU usage & GPU memory usage all remain the same. \nThe bottom line is that iStat Menu can't explain the increase in CPU/GPU temperature. \n\nA: I would recommend the iStat Monitor to find out what is going on.\nIn comparison the 750 vs 650:\n50/45 watt power consumption\nand 967 vs 900 MHz clock \nwould not explain the higher heat generation.\nHowever due to the RAM size difference it could explain that the 650 has to work harder (at max power) resulting in higher heat generation, while the 750 does not break the sweat with 2 monitors.\n", "Q: Can I keep my MBPR unplugged when not in use? If I shut down my MBPr and unplug the power cord every night then in the morning plug it back in and turn on the MacBook, will it have an effect on the battery charge cycles?\n\nA: Only if the battery discharged to about 20% overnight for some reason it will count as new charge cycle.\nFor example if unplug at 100% and plug back in at 80% it is not counted as new charge cycle.\n", "Q: Unresponsive Keyboard and Trackpad after sleep I have a brand new MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014). Shipped with Yosemitee pre-installed, the version I have is 10.10.1 . I don't have any software installed except Google Chrome, so it is clean/new OS. \nI noticed sometimes the keyboard and trackpad become completely unresponsive after waking up the laptop from sleep. Happened several times, the last time it happened I could not reset PRAM or SMC as keyboard was unresponsive even after restarting or shutting down so I had to Re-Install OS.\nToday I was able to reproduce the issue, first I tried to let it go into Sleep mode several times with no device plugged into the USBs, and Lid left opened. I could not reproduce, both were working when I wake the laptop.\nThen I plugged in a USB Mouse, left the lid opened, and let it go to sleep for 1 hr. When I waked it up, the keyboard/mouse were unresponsive. Then I unplugged the mouse usb, let it go into sleep mode, and closed the lid .. for few minutes. Then I opened the lid, waked it up .. this time both were responsive and working.\nI was able to reproduce the above scenarios, so it is not a random thing.\nSo, is there some kind of a log or test I can use to reproduce or while reproducing the unresponsive case above so I can understand if it is a hardware or software problem ? \n[edit]\nYou can get the system.log from here \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/3x320cieum3it4w/system.log?dl=0\nAlso, here is the result of 'pmset -g'\nActive Profiles:\nBattery Power       -1*\nAC Power        -1\nCurrently in use:\nstandbydelay         10800\nstandby              1\nhalfdim              1\nhibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage\ndarkwakes            0\ngpuswitch            2\ndisksleep            0\nsleep                1\nautopoweroffdelay    14400\nhibernatemode        3\nautopoweroff         1\nttyskeepawake        1\ndisplaysleep         2\nacwake               0\nlidwake              1\n\n[edit 2]\nSorry I undo the selected solution as it did not fix the issue, as I have new information, they are unresponsive again and this time I see this keeps showing in the system log, any idea ?\nDec 12 23:49:30 ahmads-mbp kernel[0]: AppleUSBMultitouchDriver::_getFeatureReportInfo - DeviceRequest returned error 0xe00002c0 (interface 1, reportID 0xd9)\nDec 12 23:49:30 ahmads-mbp kernel[0]: AppleUSBMultitouchDebug: _getFeatureReportInfo returned an error in AppleUSBMultitouchDriver::_deviceGetReportWithLookUp\nDec 12 23:49:31 ahmads-mbp kernel[0]: AppleUSBMultitouchDriver::_getFeatureReportInfo - DeviceRequest returned error 0xe00002c0 (interface 1, reportID 0xd1)\nDec 12 23:49:31 ahmads-mbp kernel[0]: AppleUSBMultitouchDebug: _getFeatureReportInfo returned an error in AppleUSBMultitouchDriver::_deviceGetReportWithLookUp\n\n[edit 3]\nI managed to downgrade it to Mavericks but problem still happening.

At first, I'd restart the device. \nA few days ago, out of sheer frustration, as I clicked on random keys and rubbed the trackpad, the keyboard and simultaneously, the trackpad, became responsive, quite to my surprise. After several more tries, it now seems to me the key 'Q' was the key- pressing it several times, along with the 'esc'.

I went to my local Apple Premium Reseller (iCentre Delft, the Netherlands), and they said I should restore the phone via iTunes. I did and it worked fine for approximately 5 days. But then, this morning, it crashed again. Same thing as before. But this time it DID NOT go back to usable, and I decided to try and hook it up to iTunes again. It wasn't recognized, however, and therefore I could not restore my phone. I called Apple Support, and they said I should put the phone into recovery (DFU) mode. I did, and it clearly shows the iTunes logo with the lightning cable. But now comes the problem:\nThe problem:\nWhen I connect to iTunes, I get the normal messages requesting me to reset the phone (2). It starts just fine, but when the first white appears on the bar on the iPhone, it gets stuck (while the bar in iTunes keeps moving). 10 seconds later, and the blue screen pops up again, after which it heads back to the basic recovery mode screen. On iTunes I get error 9, which shows USB connection issues. However, I doubt that this is the case and suspect that it gives this error because it has nothing else to give.\nDoes anybody have any suggestions?\n\nA: Got a new iPhone, after complaining to Apple.

They will report and provide a way to export that date each individual sale or in-app purchase. So you will be able to break it down by app, by country, by time etc. \n\nA: Not being part of the Mac development program or iOS development program, I have never used iTunes Connect, but just off the top of my head it wouldn't make any sense if Apple was not reporting sales by individual app. The short answer is yes, they do.\nThere is a guide available here that details the information provided in Sales Reports.

However, whenever I have it plugged into my Macbook pro (running OSX 10.9.5),\nthe default mappings don't seem to work.\nI've used other keyboards, and the windows key will always re-map to cmd on mac. However, on my new keyboard, this isn't the case. The windows key doesn't seem to do or change anything. The alt key also doesn't seem to get mapped to anything initially.\nMy ctrl key maps correctly to ctrl on mac, but this leaves me without a command, or an option key.\nI went into the \"Modifier Keys\" panel, and selected my keyboard on the list. Changing command to map to the ctrl key does remap cmd from mac to ctrl on my windows keyboard. Changing the mac ctrl to map to whatever the default \"cmd\" key is (in this case, should be the windows symbol key), does not work. \nThis means, when I'm trying to run a program and have to execute commands with the mac ctrl, I have to keep switching the modifier keys around.\nI've tried using karabiner to remap keys, but can't seem to figure it out. I looked on the XML key list, but can't figure out how to remap the windows key to the mac ctrl, and the command key to the windows ctrl. How would I go about fixing this?\n\nA: With my Durgod keyboard it was the Fn + Windows combination to lock/unlock the windows key to switch it to the command key.\n\nA: I fixed the issue!\nTurns out that on this keyboard, doing fn + f12 actually disables the windows key. This was turned on by default. This is why nothing was working when I would press the windows key. I pressed fn + f12 again and now everything works :| weeks of frustration all due to me not looking at my keyboard layout :(\n\nA: I had a slightly different experience than the others did here. My Windows key wasn't locked -- it simply wasn't assigned in the keyboard's memory. In order to get this to work correctly, I had to download the software for the CM Storm Trigger Z (which should function similar to your Quickfire) on a Windows machine, assign the correct key to act as the Windows key, and then it worked when returning the keyboard to my Mac.\nYou can find the company's instructions on downloading the software and getting this fixed here, by clicking \"Download\" and then \"Windows Key Setup\":\nhttp://www.coolermaster.com/peripheral/keyboards/triggerz/\nThere's one other thing that has to happen before your keyboard will work on OSX correctly: you have to select the keyboard's profile by pressing the storm button and the number 1 at the same time. This activates the profile for which you've programmed the storm key to function as the Super key (Windows key / CMD key).\n\nA: In my case with Logitech G413 the windows key also stopped working. Fn+F12 didn't help but plain old unplugging the USB cable and plugging back helped.\n\nA: This solution is completely non-intuitive, but it worked for my case.\nI have my gaming keyboard (made for Windows) attached to my work MacBook Pro. Previously, the Windows key was seamlessly mapped to the Apple command key without my having to do anything other than plug it in. After several Big Sur updates, suddenly my Windows key no longer worked.\nAfter some experimentation and research, the following was successful.\n\n*\n\n*Open system settings.\n\n*Select keyboard.\n\n*Select Modifier Keys... button.\n\n*Set Option Key to Command.\n\n*Set Command Key to Option.\n\n*OK\n\nAt this point, both my option keys behaved as command keys, and my command key behaved as an option key.\nOne detail that may or may not be relevant to this solution. On my gaming keyboard, the option keys are in the exact physical position as the command keys on my MacBook Pro, and the left Windows key is in the exact physical position as the left option key on my MacBook Pro.\n\nA: For some Logitech keyboards, Game Mode is controlled by a physical toggle with a joystick on it.\nPretty sure my kitten bumped it. The scamp.\nBut yeah, if none of the Fn combos work, look for a physical toggle.\n\nA: For Cooler Master Keyboard it's Fn F9 to enable and disable the lock.\nFor Steelseries Keyboard it's Steelseries Win to enable and disable the lock.\n", "Q: How to delete all the music from the iPad I'm planning to sell?

I have a nifty setup on my MacBook Pro, where, upon connecting my iPhone, I have AutoImporter.app (/System/Library/Image Capture/Support/Application/AutoImporter.app) automatically import whatever photos are on my camera roll, delete them off the iPhone, and simultaneously open a Finder window with the folder that I have set as import folder ('Pictures', for me), so I can look at the imported photos immediately and work on them in Photoshop or similarly work with them in the file system directly.\nIt's lightning quick, and extremely convenient.\nNow, on my MacBook Air, I am trying to emulate this setup and I have forgotten how I achieved the final step in this process, where a Finder window automatically opens (on top of whatever you're doing), once AutoImporter opens and starts importing the photos.\n(The first step of the process, can be described here.)\nI have narrowed it down to observing it being triggered simply by opening AutoImporter.app - whether it imports photos or not. Without the iPhone connected, simply by opening AutoImporter.app - every time - a new Finder window with Pictures folder, pops up.\nI have endlessly messed around in Automator and turned off all third party automator-type apps (Keyboard Maestro, FastScripts, Alfred), and I still cannot determine how it is working.\nIt seems I somehow did this using in-built OS X tools and software - whether a script (in .scpt or .app form), an automator workflow, or something using both, or something else. How on earth did I achieve this?\n\nA: EUREKA! I found it!\nThe way I achieved this marvelous setup, was with a combination of a tiny AppleScript saved as an .app file, and the brilliant, free third-party prefPane app, Do Something When.\nInstructions:\nSet up up the first part of the process as linked to in the question, which will give the following settings in AutoImporter (so that when you insert the iPhone, it will automatically import them to the Pictures folder):\n\nNow go to Script Editor.app (/Applications/Utilities/Script Editor.app), and insert the following code, which is what will open the Pictures folder in Finder (replace yourosxuserdirectory with your own user folder name):\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    open (\"/Users/yourosxuserdirectory/Pictures\" as POSIX file)\nend tell\n\nClick Save or Export and select 'Application' as 'File Format' near the bottom.

I am using a mid-2011 MacBook Air running Yosemite 10.10.2\n\nA: I have been having the exact same issue on my Mid-2014 MB Pro. I am almost positive the problem does not lie in Yosemite itself but rather in the new machines. Apparently new machines were formatted differently or something of the sort and no longer support Silverlight whereas older machines that simply upgraded to Yosemite from something even as recent as Mavericks do not have this issue. I work at an Apple Premium Service Provider and have spoken at length with Apple certified technicians on this topic and that's our conclusion. It sucks, really.\n\nA: Perchance, make sure to select Run in Unsafe Mode in Safari Preferences for this plugin.  Works for me on Fidelity Investments website for their Silverlight realtime trading tool.\n\nA: This worked for me in running Fidelity ATP with Firefox, not Safari:\nFind the Microsoft Silverlight alias in Applications, double click to open Microsoft Silverlight Preferences.\nIn the Application Storage tab, Delete All (lower right)\nEnable Application Storage should be checked.\nQuit Silverlight, restart Firefox.\n\nA: Make sure that the following is set:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Safari Preferences - Security\n\n*Tick Internet Plug-ins box and Click on associated 'Plug-in Settings'\n\n*Make sure all Plug-ins in the list are Ticked\n\nA: I just had the new operating system installed and was unable to install silverlight.  The technician told me to go to systems preferences and hit the general tab.  About 1/2 down, if you have already tried downloading silverlight, it should say apple store and identified developers.  Click that button and then click always.  It will step you through the process to download silverlight.\n\nA: In Safari's preferences, under the 'Websites' tab, I found these settings for the silverlight plugin. I changed both the dropdown settings to 'on', and now silverlight works for me.\n\n\nA: I had the same problem also but found that under Safari → Preferences → Advanced\n→ Internet plug-ins I had checked stop internet plug-ins to save power. Apparently applies even if you are off battery power.\n\nA: go to firefox plugins\nhttps://www.google.de/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=firefox+plugins+how+to+open\nthen check if silverlight is enabled. it worked for me on a new mac with 10.10.\n", "Q: Show the Dock with AppleScript? I would like to show the Dock when all windows are hidden/closed/minimized.  Is this something that can be done with AppleScript?  Where can I learn more about the specific capabilities of AppleScript?\n\nA: [edit after more research]\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use Applescript to turn on and off the dock's autohide.\n\n*You can't use Applescript to determine whether you have open/visible windows. This is because Applescript treats each application as an object, and some applications handle windows differently, meaning they can't all be manipulated or detected. I haven't even been able to find an applescript that can reliably count open windows, and there's absolutely no recent documentation on how to handle spaces with applescript.\n\n\nFrom within the Script Editor, select File > Open Dictionary, and you will be presented with a list of applications that have dictionaries of scriptable objects & behaviors that you can access. You want to select System Events and search for \"dock\". The dock preferences object has the property autohide, which looks like a good bet to do what you want: i.e. turn on autohide when there are open windows, and turn it off when there aren't. You can find more information about what's available by looking through different dictionaries and reading the documentation.\nApple's own introduction\n", "Q: Target Disk Mode & SMART This Question - Getting loads of Open error 5's when using Terminal to repair permissions - raises the question,\nDoes mounting a drive in Target Disk Mode bypass SMART, preventing any lockout if the disk is failing & you need to recover data?\nIn the past, I have always put suspected failing drives [often Windows NTFS drives] in a USB enclosure & attached to my Mac to scavenge/repair, as that way I am ignoring both SMART & any OS intervention from Windows etc.\nFor a Mac, would Target Disk Mode be just the same as an external USB for similar tasks, or could SMART potentially restrict operations?\nEdit: Google would seem to think that SMART reporting cannot be carried over USB or Firewire, but that doesn't exclude the possibility of Thunderbolt. I cannot find any canonical answer even to the first two, though.\n\nA: S.M.A.R.T is a monitoring system for HDD and SSD implemented in the firmware of a drive using two different standards: ATA and SCSI.\nSMART data is usually written to a special service part of the platter/flash storage unit.\nAll modern interface standards and the underlying protocols (SCSI, FireWire, USB – with USB-(S)ATA-Bridges, eSATA, Thunderbolt, SAS) are basically capable of transmitting SMART-data.  \nSMART data is not actively transmitted to hosts, but has to be queried by the host-OS, applications or drivers.\nDepending on the OS, the SMART application, the drivers and the build-in hardware the success of those queries may vary broadly. BTW to retrieve SMART data from external USB/FireWire-drives attached to Macs use this kext driver (compatibility list).\nAs a result Target Disk Mode doesn't 'bypass' SMART at all, because SMART is implemented in the hard disk. It's hard to say in general if operating systems (or application and drivers) are locking out failing disks based on SMART data.  \nI doubt that at all because   \n\n\n*\n\n*SMART isn't very reliable\n\n*the implemented attributes varies between manufacturers and hard drive models\n\n*the meanings and interpretations of the attributes and their values varies between manufacturers\n\n\nAt least i don't know of any such OS or application.\nIt's rather the OS in conjunction with the firmware and the (failing) hard disk itself which 'lockout' a device.\n", "Q: Remove Location circle from Maps Maps on OS X 10.10 has an annoying blue circle (around current location?) which obscures the detail you are trying to view. How can I turn it off\n\nA: You could do this by disabling access to your location for the Maps app.\nThis is done in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy.\nSelect Location Services in the left panel and make sure Maps is unchecked in the list of apps allowed to use your location. This should remove the Current Location marker from the app without disrupting your access to the internet or preventing other apps using your location.\n\n\nA: The blue circle is apparently where Maps thinks the WiFi I am using is located. Turning WiFi off removes the circle, allowing the image to be viewed.\nThis may require another (Ethernet) connection to view images.\n", "Q: I have deleted all photos from my iPhone 4s but phone usage and iTunes still show 16gb of photos I had 25GB of photos on my 4s. I have deleted all of them, some via the photos app, and some via windows explorer.\nUnfortunately, phone usage and iTunes is still showing 16GB of photos. I backed up the image and imported it to a new 5s and it is also showing 16GB (458 photos) on the new phone.\niCloud and all the sync settings are off.\nWhen I open the photos app, all the albums are completely empty. I have done countless soft and hard resets but I can't get rid of this phantom 16gb of used photo storage. I've also tried countless suggested fixes from web searches but nothing is working.\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: The best way to attack this is to make a good backup (perhaps two - one to iTunes and another iCloud) and then restore the device.\nWhen you activate the phone, don't sign in to iCloud at all (or the app store) - just set it up as a new device. From there you can look at storage and then slowly add your Apple Accounts.\nWhen you sign in to iCloud - look at the storage and see if it's downloading photos from the iCloud Drive, the Messages archives, the photo stream, etc...\nMy suspicion is you have iCloud and the \"photos\" are from the data that comes down from the server - even without having any photos in the photo app / camera roll.\n\nOnce you have a good feel for what item is causing the \"photos\" to arrive, you can then erase the phone and set it up from your backup if desired. You can also just reinstall the things you want on the device that was \"set up as new\" if that's easier than restoring a backup and deleting things you don't want.\n", "Q: Is there an app that bulk transfers camera photos to emails? Is there an app that allows us to bulk transfer full resolution camera photos to our emails?\nFor example, if I select 100 photos, the app will automatically email me all  the selected photos.\nCurrently, I'm using the default \"Photos\" app but it only allows up to 5 pictures per transfer, which means we would have to repeat the same manual action 20 times just to send a hundred photos.\n(Please do not say use the USB cable, because I need the transfer to be done via the internet.)\n\nA: If you go into the Photo app you can select and copy as many images as you want, can't you?\nHave you tried copying and pasting into the standard email app?\n", "Q: How to add a 2nd account to receive imessages My wife and I just bought an iPad and I set it up using my iCloud account info.

If you wish to upgrade any of your iTunes Store content to iTunes Plus, you'll need to do this before you change countries. The content you purchased while your account was set to the previous country will not be eligible for upgrade once you've changed countries.\n\n*after you change countries, you will no longer receive application update notifications in iTunes for the apps you purchased in your original country. However, you'll still receive update notifications on your iOS device for any applications installed on it. In addition, you'll be able to download previously purchased applications again for free if they are available on your new country's store. You will not be charged and the download will not appear on your Purchased page. If a previously purchased application is not available in your new country, you will not be able to download it again for free.\n\n*If you have an iTunes Match subscription, you can't change countries until the subscription has expired.\n\n*If you have purchased a Season Pass, you cannot change the country associated with your account until that season is done airing and the last episode of the season has been added to the iTunes Store.\nTaking the above into consideration, here's how to change your country:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes and click Sign In.\n\n*Enter your iTunes Store account name and password, then click Account Info.\n\n*On the Apple Account Information page, click Change Country or Region.\n\n*Enter the updated information and save your changes. \nOR: leave it as is and you would get a message like this, but your original account will still work regardless where you are.\n\n", "Q: Sharing iCloud storage between family members Is there a way to share iCloud storage between family members? \nI included my wife's iPhone into Family sharing, but I would like to have one storage bucket (20G) that would allow us both Apple ID accounts to backup more then default 5G per device. Is it possible?\n\nA: This feature is coming in iOS 11 (see iMore). From that page:\n\n.. yes, now you can share that data with your family, with up to six\n  people using one storage plan for backups, files, and photos.\n  Presumably, each family member's files are only available to that\n  person, unlike, say, Family Sharing of iTunes, iBooks, and App Store\n  content.\n\n\nA: Update 2017/2018: It appears Apple finally allows sharing iCloud storage between family members (see the newly accepted answer). Glad to hear it!\nOriginal:\nThe correct answer is No, there is not.  Apple does not let you share iCloud Storage with family members, unfortunately.\nHere's a forum link where this has been discussed:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/6543858\nYou can share your account and password, but then the storage is yours and not really sharing with a sub-account. Each individual Apple ID gets their own paid/gifted/free storage quota and any one account can bump up their storage only and it doesn't affect any other AppleID storage capacity - family membership regardless.\n", "Q: No Applications after Backup recovery I used to backup my data via Airport Time Capsule and configured my backup, so that no Applications are part of the backup. In case of a broken HDD etc. I would prefer to install only those applications I really need and not all the other legacy crap which comes with the time...\nNow the time has come and I've got a \"new\" (late 2012) Macbook Pro. I powered it on and set it up just as usual. After the first boot I opened the Migration Assistent in order to recover my backup from the time capsule. Somehow nothing happened after entering the APT credentials for my Account, so I tried it with the CMD+R mode during the boot process.\nThis worked just fine. I entered my credentials and the recovery process began. After completion the MBP restarted and I had a normal desktop with all my files. My backup recovered.\nUnfortunately now there is no \"Applications\" directory in my User dir. There are also no applications like \"Safari.app\" or even \"System Preferences.app\". When I try to change the Desktop Background (which I thought would open the System Preferences) nothing happens. All Dock-Items are represented by an \"?\" - except Finder which seems to be the only app which is still there.\nI booted the system via CMD+S in order to search for those applications. find . -name \"Safari.app\" had no results. As a proof that find works I searched for a file I know that exists in my backup: find . -name \"certain_file.jpg\" and I had a correct result. I don't even have a terminal (except the CMD+S shell).\nThe MBP was shipped with OS X Yosemite and apparently the system recovered without any Applications. \nEdit: it's Mavericks, not Yosemite.\n-> there is still a Recovery HD.\nWhat now? How can I get at least all my standard applications? \n\nA: Not everything makes perfect sense, but I believe this set of instructions will help you along.\nReview the entire articles below:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/PH18872 - for the erase and reinstall  \n\n*http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250 - for setting up backups once the restore is complete\n\n\nOutline of the process:\n\n\n*\n\n*make sure the backup is safe and doesn't get erased. Also, be sure to not back up to this volume until your new OS has all the data you need since a new backup could cause older backups to be erased.\n\n*boot to recovery mode and open disk utility\n\n*erase the hard drive on your Mac\n\n*install a clean copy of Yosemite\n\n*make a test account (user name test-admin or something that isn't the name you used on the backup Mac)\n\n*update all software on the Mac\n\n*then connect the backup and use the Migration Assistant to move users and data. (you could move apps here too if you have any backed up)\n\n*reboot and log in to your \"old account\" instead of the test-admin account\n\n*verify the apps and data are there\n\n*then, connect and make a back up of the fixed Mac\n\n*delete the test-admin account and remove the home folder\n\n*enjoy your success\n\n", "Q: Applescript to replace string using sed I need and Applescript to replace some text as follow:\nOriginal text:\n string  string  string  $  text1\n string  string  string  $  text2\n text3\n string  string  string  $  text4\n\nThe required output is:\n$ text1\n$ text2\ntext3\n$ text4\n\nI can do it in the terminal with this command:\n$ echo \"string  string  string  $  text1\nstring  string  string  $  text2\ntext3\nstring  string  string  $  text4\" | sed -r 's/^(.*)\\$ ?(.)

You can inspect the associated processes with this command: ps -ef|grep sec[iud]\nOn my Mac, I'm user 501 so you have this output for one user logged in:\nMac:~ bmike$ ps -ef|grep sec[iud]\n    0    58     1   0 Sat12PM ??         0:56.51 /usr/sbin/securityd -i\n    0   117     1   0 Sat12PM ??         0:00.15 /usr/libexec/secinitd\n    0   171     1   0 Sat12PM ??         0:02.24 /usr/libexec/securityd_service\n  501   205     1   0 Sat12PM ??         0:11.74 /usr/libexec/secinitd\n  501  2634     1   0 Tue08PM ??         0:08.26 /usr/libexec/secd\n\nYou can see that securityd is started as root (PID 58) and then as a user (PID 205) process when you log in. The actual secd carries out the \"work\" and can get respawned even when you do not log out and in. As to deciphering why yours is using extra resources, it will be quite hard without digging into fsusage and some other commands to peek at running processes as well as looking over your log files. Your best bet would be to file a bug with Apple and then document how you can get it to misbehave - especially if you can reproduce it after a reboot.\nThere isn't currently a \"man page\" for secd and the one for secinitd is meager at best. Filing documentation bugs against Apple is one way to ask that the lack of documentation be remedied.\n\nA: From what I know about that process (which really isn't a ton) is that it has something to do with the Mac's Keychain. What you can do is find in in the Activity Monitor and click Cmd+I to get the info about it.\nOne tip you can try to do is run the Keychain First Aid by going to Keychain Access in Spotlight, opening the \"Keychain Access\" menu, and selecting the \"Keychain First Aid\" option from there and follow the directions. \nHope that tip works!\n\nA: If it's not apparent, this is just a guess. But hopefully it gives you some leads.\nFirst, here's what you can figure out just from the program name. If you run the command /bin/ls /usr/libexec | sort -f | egrep '.*d$' (this print all files in /usr/libexec ending in d), you'll find ftpd, hidd, networkd, systemstatsd, and a lot of programs ending in d. The \"d\" stands for \"daemon\", which basically means a helper process that always runs in the background. The sec very likely stands for \"security\". So secd is the \"security daemon\". Which makes sense because you said it looks like it works with keychain stuff.\nWhat's the point of daemons? Some daemons stay running to either do some ongoing task. hidd (\"human interface device daemon\"), for example, is the process responsible for handling mouse/keyboard/trackpad input. Some other daemons do some common tasks that many other programs need. Apps can simply tell the daemon to do something instead of having code to do it themselves. So secd probably does something like this, but related to the keychain.\nBut what exactly? It looks like it doesn't actually handle normal use of the keychain, since I was still able to use the keychain after I disabled the secd LaunchAgent.\nInspecting the LaunchAgent gives us a clue:\n\nIt looks like secd is responsible for syncing the keychain with iCloud?\nSo what should you do? Try one or more of these:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't need iCloud keychain syncing, turn it off in iCloud preferences.\n\n*Use launchctl to disable secd if it doesn't seem to adversely affect anything.\n\n*If you need iCloud keychain syncing, see if you have a ton of keychain items, and remove the ones you don't need.\n\n*Perhaps rebuild your keychain (make a new keychain, move items you need into it, and move it over the older one), in case there are unnecessary artifacts left over in the old keychain.\n\n\nA: Start turning on the Keychain iCloud sync but cancel on another dialog window.\nsource: https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/54gpmo/process_secd_always_at_95100_cpu_usage_sierra/d88v542/\n", "Q: iPhone 5s - receiving sound notifications at random times with no alerts, emails, ims, etc Just recently when I take turn off vibrate om my iPhone, it has been playing alert sounds at random times without showing any notifications, no new emails, calls, texts, app updates, etc. It's really bizarre and makes me wonder if the phone is hacked. \nWhile sending a text I even got the sound of a message being sent while I was in the middle of typing, I wasn't waiting on any other message to go out, nor were any message rejected that could potentially have gone through at a later time. Again, while on vibrate mode there are no phantom vibrations, it's only when the ringer is on. \nIs there any way to tell if the phone has been hacked?\nI'd really like to avoid resetting my phone if at all possible, I have something like 6,000 photos on it and lots of stuff that I cannot afford to lose.\n\nA: One application you have, you set to not show any notifications, and just play sound.

I've got a brand new iMac running Yosemite and I do need to access an external HD formatted on (Gnu/Linux) ext4 (a journaling file system). I downloaded a library (FUSE for OSX), which is able to read that file system and a complementary app (ext4fuse), which works as a client interface to FUSE. I can mount the disk and navigate it on the finder or on a terminal but, when it comes to actually copying files (either on a terminal [see * below, pls] or on the finder), I get an error such as \"Cannot read the file\" or even \"File does not exist\". I suspect that it has something to do with permissions, so I thought that doing the copying as root might help. \nI'd appreciate any help. Thanks in advance!\nNacho\nP.S. I've tried any number of searches to no avail. [*] Trying to do the job from the terminal issuing a cp command didn't get my any closer to achieve it. Apparently, btw, the cp command in OSX is kinda restricted (regarding to its available options and functionality) wrt its Linux counterpart and, to add the insult to the injury, its options don't work the same (see -R, for instance).\n\nA: Don't go there!\nNeither Finder nor any other app with a GUI should be run as root. GUI applications are hard to debug and generally have ill-defined scope and purpose. They're china shops that you shouldn't let your 800-pound gorilla superuser enter.\nEspecially since you give as your reason: \"I suspect that it has something to do with permissions, so I thought that doing the copying as root might help.\"\nFind out what permissions problems you have. If you even have any.\nIf you must do something as root, use the sudo command to run a narrowly focused tool to do exactly what you need done, and no more.\nIndiscriminate use of root privileges is more likely to cause permissions problems than to solve them. Be sure you know what you're doing, and why before doing so.\n\nA: I fully accept the warnings other people have given here regarding running finder as root... but in a limited scenario it is very useful.\nThe OP had a problem using the: \n\nsudo /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/MacOS/Finder\n\nI suspect he/she may have also been using something like TotalFinder or XtraFinder\nIf so, then use the options in the custom menu for these add-ons to restart Finder.\nAlternatively: \n\n\n*\n\n*Run the command above (sudo Finder) in terminal\n\n*You will notice the hard drive icon overlayed on your desktop for root... but it is probably not clickable (hence the error message)\n\n*Then open a new tab in Terminal (so the sudo tab is still running) and kill the standard Finder (without using Sudo)   \"killall Finder\"\n\n*You should now be able to double click on the overlayed HardDrive desktop icon, or...\n\n*In the same non-Sudo tab of Terminal, just type \"open .\"\n\n\nOne other point to note... if you're wanting to browse as root, you probably also want to see hidden files. So before starting all this, type the command below into Terminal. This is a permanent setting, so you only need to do it once for the root user.\n\nsudo defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE\n\n", "Q: No cap after a period in Dragon Dictate 4 In Dragon Dictate 4, when I say \"Hello world period this is a test period\", it outputs:\n\nHello world. this is a test.\"\n\nThere is no cap after the first period.

They have HDMI and optical audio connections and connect to your home network via Ethernet or Wifi. When used in conjunction with Home Sharing and iTunes, it can also access the media and your home computers.  Apple TV cost $100 new but can be bought used for less.

I'm looking for a simple iOS 8 today view widget that I can point to this URL so that I always have the most recent web cam photo in the notifications panel. For the life of me, I can't find a widget that offers this simple functionality.\nDoes anyone know of an app I can use to achieve this goal? At this point, I don't even mind writing a script to produce and RSS feed, etc. to make this happen.\n\nA: I was also looking for such a webcam widget and also couldn't find one to suit my needs.\nBut as you mentioned RSS there is one that can do that (Photo of the Day Widget by Francis Bonnin) however you can't set a refresh rate for it in the app/widget settings. I also couldn't get it to work with a webcam url (JPG url or page where the webcam e.g. JPG is shown) or create an RSS feed via existing online tools for the image link or webcam page. If you know how it can be done for webcams at other websites let me know. I'm trying to run a script on my own webcam with one or more webcams from other website by looking into this W3School RSS image element code. \nI did receive a good response from the developers Lennart Reiher (PhotoBar widget) and Francis Bonnin (which created e.g. Photo of the Day widget) which were thinking about creating a new app/widget after my e-mail to them. They said that the new widget could have one or multiple webcam URLs (e.g. to a JPG) and hopefully also have a refresh rate option in it. \nAlso take a look at the huge iOS8 widget list (i'm also updating in the start topic almost daily at MacRumors forum at iOS8 sub category in the sticky widget megathread topic). I also created a Photo category there. \nIf you found a widget or build one yourself let me know here and maybe also there. \n\nA: I did manage to use the Photo of the Day widget to show webcam images in the notification center but but you need to manually add your favorite webcam link (to a JPG image) to this URL and choose a name of your choice. Then press 'Run Pipe' > Then press 'Get RSS' and copy the link to the widget and select custom RSS feed.\nPlease keep in mind that Yahoo Pipes could have a delay of approx 5 minutes. Also some webcams only refresh every 5/10 minutes or even once an hour. Also some webcams stop refreshing around 16.00CET (European Alps) and then are refreshing again the next morning.\nPlease keep in mind that the webcam you have found needs to have a permanent URL so e.g.: \n\nhttp://cms.zugspitze.de/static/webcams/k03.jpg\n\nSo should not include a date/time within the JPG file name otherwise you will keep seeing the same old webcam image from that timestamp. \nI already contacted the developer of this widget and also the developer of another widget Photo Bar and both responded to my e-mail and said they would probably try to build another widget with the webcam option without RSS feed so a direct link to a JPG for example and an auto refresh option.\nExample result:\n\nI already contacted the developer of this widget and also the developer of another widget Photo Bar and both responded to my e-mail and said they would probably try to build another widget with the webcam option without RSS feed so a direct link to a JPG for example and an auto refresh option. \n\nA: There is already one being made by the maker of LiveImageView.

You can update from 10.3.1 to 10.3.2 over LTE, but not from 10.2 to 10.3.\nThis is not a technical limitation of cell data or wifi, per se, but rather a policy limitation (though some carriers have limits of how big individual files transmitted over their networks can be). Major OS updates can run into the gigabyte range, and while many users have multi-gig or unlimited data plans, not all users do - so updates above a given size are disallowed, per manufacturer policy, from downloading over cellular.\nIf you hotspot your phone and download the update to your laptop, then run the install via iTunes, you can get around it. Or if you find a wifi connection elsewhere (that won't cut you off for excessive data use (as some free/public ones can/will)).\n\nSide note:\nIt's - generally - fastest to do OS updates via iTunes from your computer, because the update does not have to download to your phone, then extract, then install, then clean up after itself (especially important to consider if you only have 3G free on your device, but the update download size is 4GB: the update will likely still install if you do it via iTunes, because it will be overwriting existing files (along with removing some and adding some) on the phone, using your laptop/desktop as its workspace for extracting the update archive).\n\nA: All the above will not work. What you will need for this are two things: your iPhone, and a Mac or windows PC, with iTunes installed. After that, tether data from your iPhone to your Mac. Your Mac will believe it is a wireless connection. Then, launch the iTunes app from your laptop, and download and update your phone. Make sure, obviously, that your phone is connected via USB.\n\nA: I don't think that there is any feasible way around this. Apple being Apple is going to try to make software that mainly appeals to the tech layman, which isn't always bad thing, 9 times out of 10 it's a great thing. It means iPhones don't (for the most part) get viruses, do get a steady flow of software updates (unlike another mobile operating system...), and many other great features which can only be made possible when a company is a \"control freak\".\nSo even though you have adequate data, Apple makes your iPhone take the \"better safe than sorry\" approach in making sure that you don't use it up, or worse, go over, by using it here.\nI'd just ask one of my friends/family if I could use their Wi-Fi connection to download iOS 9. I'd advise against using a public connection, though, since one must enter his passcode, Apple ID, and password.\n\nA: Here are two ways to download iOS updates over the cellular network:\n\n*\n\n*Share iPhone's Internet connection and use iTunes on a computer to download the update. Warning: a backup Internet connection is required to verify the update after the device reboots. Otherwise the iPhone will get bricked, requiring a DFU restore erasing all data.\n\n*This method requires advanced technical skills. Enable Personal Hotspot, and connect USB to an OpenWRT router. Then navigate to Wi-Fi settings and connect to the same router. Now the iPhone thinks it is connected to a Wi-Fi and will prefer using it, but the OpenWRT router will forward all traffic back to the USB port, and the iPhone will route it to the Internet. I just upgraded to iOS 14.5 using this method.\n\nThe OpenWRT router should be configured to access the Internet over the USB Ethernet interface. Required OpenWRT packages:\nkmod-usb-net-ipheth\nlibimobiledevice\nlibusbmuxd\nlibplist\nlibimobiledevice-utils\nlibusbmuxd-utils\nplistutil\nusbmuxd\n\n\n*It might me possible to exploit method 2 using a computer: if the computer can access Internet over the USB and share it using the Wi-Fi adapter back to the iPhone.\n\n\nA: Go to Settings> iTunes & App Store> UPDATES(on)> Use Cellular Data\n\nA: There is a way around this:\nSimply go to Settings>iTunes and App Stores, and turn on \"Use Cellular Data\".\n\nA: Turning on cellular data for updates and iTunes only lets you download app updates under 100MB and iTunes purchases.  There is currently no way around this other than tethering to another phone's wifi connection.\n", "Q: Time machine deletes old backups when still >2 TB of 3 TB are free I get messages that my Time Machine backup volume is full and TM has deleted older backups. But my backup target disk is an external 3 TB HD and Finder reports that over 2 TB of it are free (only some 820 MB used)!\nI am backing up the internal 1 TB SSD (850 GB in use) of my Mac Book Pro Retina to that volume. I have also reformatted the backup volume and started all over with a new Time Machine backup to that fresh and empty target. But the effect reappears after 3 to 4 days.\nAll my trials to find similar reports on Google failed. It seems that other users have less than 25% free on their backup target when they run into this message. The only similar question I could find was this one but it was not answered.\nI am currently running OS X Yosemite 10.10.1 and the backup HD is connected through USB 3.\n\nA: Is it possible the snapshots being deleted are local snapshots (see http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202301) and not on the external? Local snapshots start getting deleted when free space your internal volume (not the backup volume) drops below 20%.\n", "Q: How to configure the status bar? Does anybody know how to configure the status bar (bar size, icons and font size, and so on)?\nI'd like to do it while keeping the screen resolution, of course.\nI've browsed and searched both Ask Different and the web to little or no avail.\n\nA: For the most part the menu bar has no configuration options in respect to font, size, etc.\nYou can however manage the icons in the menu bar by holding command while clicking & dragging them.  This allows you to re-arrange the icons or drag them off the menubar to hide them.\nAs others have suggested, I'd encourage you to submit feedback to Apple regarding any customization changes you'd like to see in future versions of the OS.\nApple Mac OS X Feedback\n\nA: The Finder status bar is currently unconfigurable. You can provide feedback to Apple here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html\n", "Q: How to get old Spotlight Search View back for Yosemite? I do not like Yosemite's default Spotlight search. \nIt is in the middle of screen and I can see very little outputs at once. \nIt is so much helpful when it is full screen. \nExample of the window which has limited height and central location:\n\nHow can you change the location be at the top right corner and height of the hits full height?\n\nA: As of today there is no way to move/resize the spotlight window or to rollback to the previous spotlight (as seen on older OSXs)\nI would suggest giving a feedback to Apple about this. \n\nA: Here my second bug report to Apple\n\n\nA: I was also annoyed by the obtrusive, centrally-located spotlight window. My only solution was to move the window into the upper-right hand corner. OSX remembers the window position so it always reopens in the upper-right hand corner for me now. Slightly more palatable then the original position. Hope this helps!\n\nA: You don't need \"old spotlight\" it still exists - just do a spotlight search and then scroll down to the bottom of the documents list on the left until you get to \"Show all in finder\" and (Fx: roll on the drums) magically old spotlight's results will appear! \n", "Q: Where are the installation directories for homebrew? Where does Homebrew install it's software?\nI've installed Maven with Homebrew and searching for the Maven installation directory, so that I can set MAVEN_HOME.\n\nA: brew installs binary in separate directories inside /usr/local dir. Then makes symlink inside /usr/local/bin. To get real path to binary type for example this (for tree command):\nls -l /usr/local/bin/ | grep tree\n\nOutput:\nlrwxr-xr-x  1 slozo  admin    29 23 lip 15:06 tree -> ../Cellar/tree/1.7.0/bin/tree\n\nSo my tree command is located in /usr/local/Cellar/tree/1.7.0/bin/tree\n\nA: Homebrew installs to brew --prefix (which is different for different CPU architectures).\nNot sure MAVEN_HOME is still relevant nowadays, but if you need to set it, use\nexport MAVEN_HOME=\"$(brew --prefix)/opt/maven/libexec\"\n\nThis will ensure that it will work both on Intel and ARM Macs, it also is independent of the installed Maven version (because Homebrew ensures that $(brew --prefix)/opt/maven always points to the latest version).\n\nA: Homebrew now installs to /opt/homebrew.  You can find the Maven 3.8.6 binary at /Cellar/maven/3.8.6/bin/mvn, with a symlink at /opt/homebrew/bin/mvn, for example.\nNote that you can always discover the location of an executable on the PATH with which <name>.  which mvn would show the symlink above, and ls -l $(which mvn) would show the actual location.\nFinally: For Maven specifically, you can get its home directory by running mvn -v.  It shows /opt/homebrew/Cellar/maven/3.8.6/libexec in this case.\n", "Q: Macbook wakes up immediately (OHC1) I have problems with my white unibody MacBook (13-inch, Late 2009, 10.10.1) - it can't go to sleep.

I believe there are apps that can help with that. \"Doctoring\" is the term used often\n\nA: Do the following and place your removed fonts back to the \"font\" folder of your library folder.\n\nRestore fonts that came with your Mac using Font Book\nYou can restore the fonts that were originally included with your Mac. This may be useful if you’re having issues with Font Book. Restoring the standard fonts moves any fonts you’ve installed into a separate folder, which makes them unavailable to use in apps.\nIn the Font Book app  on your Mac, choose File > Restore Standard Fonts.\nAny fonts you’ve installed are placed in /Library/Fonts (Removed) or in ~/Library/Fonts (Removed). To install those fonts again, just reinstall them.\n\n\nA: Simply you can do rm -f ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.FontRegistry.user.plist and 90 percent I sure that your problem will be resolved!\n", "Q: Change space with mouse wheel + modifiers I hate that I have to use both hands on my keyboard to change spaces (one for control, one for arrow keys). A much more practical shortcut would be, for example, control + mouse wheel. However I don't know if it's possible to do so. I'm using 10.10 Yosemite.\nI'm also open to third-party software.\n\nA: If you use the Apple Magic Mouse you can change between spaces by \"Swipe left or right with two fingers\".\nYou should check if you have active this option on System Preferences → Mouse → More Gestures.\nAdditionally, if you want to change it with only one hand, you could change the shortcut for \"Move left a space\" and \"Move right a space\" under System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Mission Control to something easily usable with a single hand like ⇧+ctrl+z and ⇧+ctrl+x\n", "Q: MacBook Pro \"clicking\" while muted when showing a message dialog in Windows on Parallels - what's happening? I am experiencing odd \"click\" noises from my MBP, while sound is muted, it's unplugged from the power source (ie running only on battery), and Windows in Parallels shows a message dialog.\nTo reproduce:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unplug the laptop (right now, 94% battery)\n\n*Ensure the volume is muted\n\n*In Windows on Parallels, do something that shows a message dialog\n\n*A loud \"click\" will be heard. It sounds plasticky or staticky, like the pop you get when plugging in a speaker to a powered amp, and I can't trace it to either speaker - it seems to come more from the back center or back right (maybe the right-side speaker) of the laptop. Two seconds later, a second, slightly quieter click will occur while the message dialog is still open.\n\n\nThe laptop is muted, absolutely.\nIs there another sound source in a MBP, apart from the speakers? Why would this happen when showing a dialog - could it be a mechanical change in the laptop itself, caused by something to do with the video card?\n\n\n*\n\n*Early 2011 model MBP\n\n*Yosemite, fully up to date\n\n*At the time, running Parallels 9 hosting Windows 7\n\n*Volume does not have to be muted for this to happen, but it does happen when the laptop volume is muted, making me think it may not be a sound from the speaker (?)\n\n\nEdit: The original question was that this happened for a low battery warning. Since it's now happening with a nearly full battery, and it seems to be related to message dialogs, the fact the messages were about a low battery is a coincidence.\n\nA: The pops you hear are due to the sound card turning on then turning off.  It is more obvious if you connect your laptop to an external sound system.  Unfortunately it isn't something you can control/change on your system.\nI'm guessing that Apple does this so that the sound card doesn't play interference sounds (hums, whines, etc) from power sources, cell phones, etc.\nAlthough it might be more obvious with the Windows dialog and alert sound, it is not just Parallels.  I have the same problem in Parallels, VMware Fusion, in every Mac application, and even the Finder.\nFor example, try pressing the volume up and down buttons on your keyboard and listen very carefully.  Just before the volume change sound plays, you will hear the pop as it turns on.  About 3 seconds later, you will hear another pop as it turns off.  (If the volume sound doesn't play when you press the volume buttons, hold down shift).\nAnother example is to play a movie in Quicktime Player where it is completely silent at the start.  When you press Play, you will get the pop.  The \"off\" pop will happen about 3 seconds after you close the movie window or quit Quicktime Player.\nIf it bothers you a lot, a total hack workaround I've found is to get Audio Hijack Pro.  Install and run it then from the Audio Hijack Pro menu, select Install Extras and install the Instant On option.  In the main window, select the System Audio entry and click the Hijack button.  You will hear the pop as AHP turns on the sound card.  Since the sound card is already on, other apps like Parallels won't cause the pops to happen. Simply hide or minimize the AHP application and it will keep the sound card active.\nAHP is free but any recordings over 10 minutes will have noise added.  Since we are just hijacking and not actually recording anything, you shouldn't have any problems with the free version.\n\nA: This is a bug that sometimes occures on Parallels desktop (PD) 9.\nSometimes reinstalling PD can solve this problem.\nYou can drag PD to the trash bin and install it again. After that you can import your existing virtual machine or just open it by clicking on it. I this it is located in Document/Parallels Desktop/\n\nA: This seems to be a six months old thread, however I just wanted to add a quick if not very elegant workaround to this problem. \nI'm using Parallels Desktop 10.2.1 on Yosemite 10.10.3 running on Mid-2010 15\" MacBook Pro and I seem to be affected by the weird clicking noise, even if the sound in my Mac is muted. \nThe workaround I found is to plug and then un-plug headphones into the headphones port. Whatever this does, it seems to fix the clicking sounds and most of the time I carry headphones with me anyways, so it's not a big deal. \n\nA: I had, and it seems, after I researched the topic, like many other people, a problem of hearing popping sounds when running Windows in Parallels. Everytime Windows was giving out an sound or audio signal, I just heard a popping noise, like plugging in speakers or an amp. The solution that worked for me is described on the following page. \nhttp://glimpseoftheobvious.blogspot.it/2014/02/how-to-fix-annoying-popping-audio-with.html\nBriefly, the approach described there involves the following:\nThe problem can be solved by adjusting the audio properties of that virtual machine and changing the audio format. To fix the problem, navigate to the Windows Control Panel and open the Sound properties interface. Once the dialog box opens you'll see four tabs at the top.  Select the \"playback\" tab, where you will see the audio device \"speakers\".  With \"speakers\" selected click the properties button to expose the \"speakers properties\" dialog box.  Go to the \"advanced\" tab.  You will now see the currently selected default format and the play button to test a format.  Clicking the test button will most likely generate more popping sounds.\nTry changing the default format to something other than the current selection. The default selection will most likely be 16 bit, 44,100 Hz CD quality.  Set your default selection back to the 16 bit, 44,100 Hz CD quality after trying a few other formats. This seems to reset somehow the drivers. \n\nA: I've been looking for a solution for months and finally developed an application by myself - NOT an Ads, a thing might really help people to solve @ www.github.com/d-velopment/macClick - it removes the clicking impulse sound and keeps the soundcard output busy.\n", "Q: Can i send an email from me.com with an email using a different domain? I have had a dummy email (with a non me.com domain name) address created for my website and this email is redirected to my me.com account. This works fine.\nBut how can i send email from my dummy address? \nThe dummy address is not gmail/hotmail or so on, it is using my website domain name. For far,i have only managed to reply using my me.com account.\nThank you,\nAurélie \n\nA: On a Mac, in the reply message, notice that the From: line has the down-pointing triangle that indicates that it's a menu. Clicking on it reveals a menu of all the email addresses you have configured. Select the one you want. The response will be sent through the SMTP server you have associated with the account corresponding to that email address.\nOn the iPhone, the reply message has a consolidated Cc/Bcc/From: field. (You have to swipe down to see it, because it's originally scrolled off the top.) Tap on that to expand it into separate CC, BCC, and From fields. Tap on the From: field, and note that a scrolling list appears at the bottom of the screen, with all your email addresses the iPhone knows about. Select the one you want to use.\n\nA: That depends on the web site you are on and they email services.\nIn most cases it is not possible to use it as regular email account.\nYou receive emails true they service and then you can replay, but not initiate new email since you do not own the email server.\n", "Q: Switch Windows in Pages So I'm using Pages on my Mac and I once was able to switch the windows (NOT the application, but the windows in Pages) with the shortcut command + < or command + >. Now, they apparently removed this function.\n\nIn other applications like Safari it does still work. Do you know how I can activate this function again?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: It looks like Pages overwrites the command + < shortcut to zoom out the view even though that's the default shortcut for moving focus between windows on a German keyboard.\n\nYou can go in to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortucts to redefine that shortcut in Pages. Click App Shortcuts, click the + button, select Pages from the Application list, enter your equivalent of \"Zoom Out\" for the menu title, and enter a new keyboard shortcut.\n\nIn my example, I assigned command + back tick to Zoom Out and now in Pages that shortcut zooms out the view instead of switching windows.\n\nA: ⌘` (command + backtick) definitely works, on both the old (’09) Pages and the new. ⌘< and ⌘> (remembering to hold down shift to get < and > on my keyboard) zooms in/out on both versions.\nIf ⌘<,⌘> used to switch windows for you, you must have redefined them, either in System Preferences→Keyboard→Shortcuts or in some third-party macro utility (Keyboard Maestro et al.). Re-check your shortcuts and see if they're still defined.\nIf ⌘` no longer works, look in System Preferences→Keyboard→Shortcuts→Keyboard and see if you've disabled or remapped \"Move focus to next window\", which by default is enabled and mapped to that key combination.\nBear in mind if you've using Spaces that ⌘` only switches to the next window of the same application in the same Space. It will not switch to a window in another space, nor a window that has been minimized (because minimized counts as a separate Space). Nor will it switch from a window that is using full screen (because such a window is the only window in its Space). Clicking on the app's Dock icon will switch to the next Space that has any open windows for that app (and you can then cycle between just those windows). Minimized windows can be found in the app's Dock menu, or using Mission Control.\n", "Q: App for collecting (and categorizing) stuff from the web I've looked high and low and I'm surprised I haven't found exactly what I'm looking for; it seems like such a common task.\nI just want an iPhone app to rapidly clip stuff from web pages. My first priority is just to clip images (with source url and/or caption). But being able to do the same with bits of text, links, videos, etc would be nice.\nThe way I imagine it working is: I navigate on the web. I hold down an image or selection. Some \"drop points\" appear on the side for me to drag and drop it into. I can have as many drop points as I want and they can have names.\nMore abstractly: I just want a very gestural/natural way (i.e. doesn't require thinking or tapping) to grab stuff from web pages and put them into folders.\n\nA: I have been looking for something similar for a while now, though I am more interested in saving bits of text. So far, I've not found anything ideal, but there are two that I've come across that work pretty well. \nPearltrees seems to be the best, particularly for pictures and entire websites. There is an ios app for it, and you can add a button for it on your share menu. Additionally, Pearltrees is online, and both Firefox and Chrome (and probably Safari) have an extension for it. Your Pearltrees account has folders, so you can sort what you have-- there is also a \"dropshelf\" where you can put things until you have time to sort them later. The downside is that all of your folders and items are public with the free account-- should you want to make any of them private, you need to upgrade to a paid version.\nDiigo seems to be a good way to save webpages and clips of text from a web browser. I have not explored it in detail, so I cannot speak as to its ability to save pictures. The filing system involves tags instead of files. I find this more difficult in some respects, but it may be to your liking. It also has a full version that requires payment, though you can do a lot with the free version.\nIf you've found anything else, I'd love to hear about it!\n\nA: I am going to add my comment as an answer: The app you are looking for is Evernote. \nSince the description you provide essentially matches Evernote’s purpose and capabilities, I see no reason to provide further detail. \n", "Q: How do I zip a .app file using terminal?

I have Yosemite.  I am considering installing OS X server 4.0.  According to developer.apple.com:\n\nYou can, however, install OS X Server and enable Xcode Server on your\n  development Mac.\n\nWhat exactly is OS X Server 4.0?  Does installing require me to have a freshly formatted machine?  In other words, does it overwrite Yosemite with a totally new OS (similar to Windows Server 2012 vs Windows 8)?  Or, does it simply extend my Mac with new capabilities like a powerful program suite?\n\nA: OS X Server 4 is an application. (.app) that is installed over the OS.  It won't require you to format the entire drive to install it.  It will just add the needed features to take advantage of the Server.app suite.\n\nA: OS X Server is primarily an interface. OS X contains (almost - mail and databases are the main exceptions) all the software you will need, so if you want to set things up from the command line it won't make any difference. However, balance your time to work out the command line setup against the $20 Server.app costs.\nServer.app is rather picky about configuration file layouts - if you want to do your own adjustments I recommend you make a separate file and use an include directive. Behaviour ranges from no problem to service won't start to Server.app crashing (so you can't reset it)\n", "Q: Force Mac OSX to restart instead of waking up Whenever I put my MacBook to sleep and then let it run out of battery, it takes a very long time (5-10 minutes) to wake up and let me log in, and then it runs slowly for 15-30 minutes after that. This is slow enough that in many cases, I would rather just restart my computer and pull up the work I was doing beforehand by myself.\nWhen I open my laptop's lid to wake it up from sleep, is there anything I can do to interrupt the wakeup process and immediately have my computer restart instead?\n\nA: You can hold down the power button for 10 seconds, wait a couple seconds, then press the power button again and it should boot.  However, if the computer battery is still dead, it may take a few minutes before the battery will charge up enough before the computer will boot.  \nSo, once the battery has had enough time to charge up from dead (~5-10%) it should allow you to restart it.\n", "Q: Is it possible to exclude bad memory? I have a MacBook Air 2012 (A1466) and it developed some memory errors.\nIt crashes every half hour and Apple Hardware Test says \n\n4MEM/9/40000000: 0x79eea590\n\nUnfortunately, RAM is soldered on the motherboard and it is not replaceable.\nI did some research and found that it is possible to tell the operating system to ignore wrong memory addresses if you use Linux: Ubuntu Forums: Exclude Bad Memory \nIs is possible to somehow exclude faulty RAM addresses in Mac OS X?\nI currently use Yosemite (10.10) but, I am willing to downgrade if necessary.\n\nA: Your only option is to replace the offending hardware.  Unfortunatley, if you were able to hack a solution together, it would be removed after subsequent updates.  With El Capitan and later, SIP would prevent you from doing this.\nYou have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace the logic board - very expensive  ($700 to $1000 USD)\n\n*Replace the RAM modules - less expensive ($300 to $500 USD)\n\n\nThere are shops that will do this type of repair like Rossman Group in NYC.  (Disclaimer:  I am not affiliated with this company in any way, I am just a satisfied client).  They can do board level repairs like this for half of what it would cost to replace the logic board.\nThat said, you may be able to find a functional (used) logic board on eBay as well.\n", "Q: Destroyed text in sudo dialog I used the application \"HDD Cleaner\" to clear up my ~/Library/Cache folder.

I already switched the languages and region, but without success.\nI'm using 10.10.1 on my MacBook Air Early 2014.\n\nA: It's possible it could have messed up the Font cache.  Restart into Safe mode, (hold down shift after the boot chime) and release Shift when the grey screen and Apple logo appear.  When asked to log in, type in your password, then HOLD SHIFT and hit enter.  Reboot into OS X as normal and try again.\nHopefully it didn't delete a system font on accident.  Next, open Font Book, select all the fonts and choose Validate Fonts from the File menu.  Resolve any conflicts that it finds.  If you don't have a lot of non-standard fonts installed, you can choose Restore Standard Fonts from the File menu and reboot.  Hopefully it's something simple.  \n", "Q: Apple Developer DNS Broken I'm trying to create a developer account at developer.apple.com, but every time I click \"Register\", it says the server at developercms.apple.com couldn't be found.

The steps and walking & running graphs are showing but without data. I've restarted, updated, and tried again and again but it is not functioning.\n\nA: See Edit note at bottom.  My answer does need work, but I don't know the correct answer yet.\nYou need additional accessories to collect that data. \nFrom the IOS8 for iPhone manual Page 122:\n\nData sources: Enter your own data, Collect data from a device, Collect data from an app.\n\nAlso on Apple's \"Health\" marketing page note it says:\n\nThe Health app in iOS 8 lets you see the data that your health and fitness apps collect in one place. You can also store your important health data in Medical ID for easy retrieval in an emergency.\n\nNowhere in any of the documentation does it indicate that Apple has figured out a way to collect this data with the phones sensors regardless of where the user is keeping/carrying the phone (i.e. shirt pocket, pants pocket, in an arm band carrier...etc).  \nApple also sells the accessories in the apple store.\nEDIT to add:  Now I'm confused too!! today My iPhone 6 has data collected, and I don't know how from the research I've done for this answer. The interface seems incredibly buggy, I am seeing both NO DATA and graphs populated with data and I can't see apparent methods to make either happen intentionally.  Drilling down to the \"All Data\" display and waiting a long time does seem to return data points that the phone has collected.   \nAdditional Info Edit: NO DATA seems to appear while data is being sorted, that's my feeling anyway, I can't seem to figure out what makes sorting short or long however.\nI've googled and searched apple additionally and can find no apparent documentation other than what I've already linked and quoted.\n\nA: The Walking and Running Distance comes from the motion co-processor that exists in iPhone 5s and iPhone 6. It seems like the Apple Watch will be able to inject that data as well into the iPhones, but we'll need to wait for final release to know how or if that is complete in the spring of 2015.\nSimilarly, the steps data comes from having the phone on your body when you are moving about.\nThere are some apps that can add data to this category - tap the Share Data to see what data sources are currently contributing to this graph. For me, you can see my iPhone as well as the Runmeter and Strava apps are sources. Since I record my runs in Runmeter and then push the data from there to Strava, I've disabled the Strava input so that one run doesn't get counted twice in the health app.\n\nYou can easily set up contrived data by manually adding a data point and then seeing the graph update to reflect your added data. Feel free to post a second photo with a screen shot of your particular graph and the data you have that makes it up if you aren't seeing the graphs update after a power off of the iPhone to reset things if the calculations are stuck.\n\nA: While in Heath App and with the orange steps app showing, swipe to your left and a screen will come up where you can turn Steps on.

At bootup, I only had to login once (with my username and password). \nI recently changed my OSX password but my filevault / disk encryption password was not changed. Now I have to login twice when I boot up (first with my old pass, then with the new one). \nIs there any way to change the disk encryption password so I can be in sync with my login password?\nI tried Disk Util > File > Change Password, but it is greyed out. \n\nA: I had similar problem. And didn't even know that was a problem. I thought it is standard to have one pass to unlock disk and another to login to the system. As to why during unlock there was unknown username and avatar I thought it was a bug which appeared after one of the osx major updates.\nIt turned out that my main admin user was not authorized to unlock the disk and some random/legacy user I created for test a year ago was authorized. So I went to System Preferences->Security&Privacy->FileVault and authorized my main user to unlock.\nStrange is that when I went to Users&Groups to delete that random user it was not not on the list like it haven't existed (this is one of reasons that I thought before that everything is ok). So I created a user with the same name and only then could delete it.\nNow I can unlock disk and login with just one user and enter password just once.\n\nA: Just bumped into this issue too, if you change password via \n\nSettings > Users & Groups > Change Password ...\n\nyou will be prompted twice, once for the File Vault original password and again for the new account password.

I used a toaster-style drive cloner (Dyconn Dubbler) to do a sector by sector duplication of the drive. Everything went smoothly but when I booted up from the new drive, I seem to only have around 500 GB of total space, almost all of it full. I fooled around with the partitions a little in disk utility, hoping I could maybe create and delete one, but haven't had any luck.

Delete the disk image created in step 5 if everything works as expected.\n\n\nA: The drive cloner did exactly what it was supposed to do – clone the drive, right down to the original volume's capacity. Try reformatting the SSD with one 1TB partition and then doing a standard Time Machine restore.\n\nA: If you use CarbonCopyCloner (after reformatting the SSD) it will give the option of moving across the Recovery Partition before moving your 500Gb of data to the new 1Tb partition.\n", "Q: Blaupunkt 4k LED TV as external monitor for MBP mid 2012 retina issue I initially connected the MBP 2012 retina 2.7 GHZ to the 4k display it showed me 3840x2160 correctly.

I'm copying a slab of plain text that contains URLs into an RTF file in TextEdit, which I am hoping to automatically, (as there are a lot of them in the text), 'linkify' into rich text hyperlinks - make them clickable, and underlined in blue or as per the default appearance.\nIn WordPad on Windows, if you paste plain text, WordPad will automatically linkify any links, but TextEdit, Word 2011, and Pages on the Mac all will not.\nI've also tried to export the text to PDF in TextEdit, Word 11 and Pages and fiddled around with Tools in Acrobat Pro itself - all to no avail.\nAn AppleScript would be fun, but (even if hooked into FastScripts), still not as quick or elegant as Windows' WordPad's instant and automatic linkification of URLs upon insertion into a document.\nIs there something this elegant in OS X?\n\nA: To convert multiple plain text URLs to hyperlinks in a rich text file in TextEdit, you must apply an action.\nAfter pasting the text, go to Edit > Substitutions > Show Substitutions, making sure 'Smart Links' is ticked, and either select the text and use 'Replace in Selection' or use 'Replace All' to apply to whole document itself:\n\nEXAMPLE:\nI pasted same text twice for demonstration.\nAfter pasting I selected the second paragraph (only for demonstration) and used the Smart Links - Replace in Selection:\n\n\nA: The plain-text format does not support rich-text formating like blue, underlining, or indeed linking. It only supports unformattedplain text. You can press Command+Shift +T in TextEdit to toggle between rich-text  and Plain text format.\nRich-text mode will allow you to use formatting and linking.\nNow, as for linking things you have copied into your clipboard. Any block of text containing formatting (bold, linking, etc.) from most web browsers (Safari, Opera, Chrome) will retain all of this information when you paste it into TextEdit.\nFor smart links, as mentioned by another user, to work, you have to actually type out the link in TextEdit.

(I am running Yosemite)\nThanks,\n\nA: You should be able to delete the partition, and you would be able to re-use the space to create a new partition (of the same size).\nFor some reason (not technical) OS X (lion or later) won't let you resize partitions on MBR disks. You could delete using gparted from a Linux live CD or many partitioning tools.\nYou don't say what you are proposing to use the partition for, or what is on the \"Files\" partition.

Without being able to delete a stock app, is there any way for me to remove this waste of storage space?\nWould prefer not to wipe the phone. iPhone 5, iOS 8.1.1\n\nA: A forum post on Apple Support Communities points out that on iOS 10 it is possible to reduce the Podcasts app’s “Documents & Data” by temporarily removing the app:\n\nGood news for everyone that has been dealing with this issue - iOS 10 has a new feature that help resolve the Podcasts storage problem.\nOne thing you can now do in iOS 10 is 'delete' stock apps from your device. It doesn't really delete the app, but it deletes the icon link from the apps and it also removes associated data and configuration files!  This means that deleting the Podcasts app will also delete the huge data file.\nOnce removed, the Podcasts app can just be readded from the App Store, and the settings are instantly restored from your iCloud account.\n  \n\n( I realize this is an old question, but I stumbled upon it while trying to find out why the Podcasts app is using a few hundred megabytes worth of “Documents & Data” on my iPhone in addition to the storage it uses for downloaded podcast episodes, and I thought it was still worth providing an updated answer pointing out that on iOS 10 this can be more easily fixed. I haven’t been able to try this myself yet, as I am still on iOS 9. )\nONE THING TO NOTE:\nAny podcasts you have downloaded, but are not subscribed to will be lost. \n\nA: Go to Settings > General > Usage > Manage Storage; tap on Podcasts, then you can swipe each podcast to delete it.

I imagine the steps to be roughly:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set a OSX flag that reboots into the recovery mode.\n\n*Execute a shell script that runs the asr (Maybe via LaunchDaemon?)\n\n*Reset the flag to boot from the normal boot volume\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nUnfortunately I did not find information how to manually reboot into recovery mode or launch an automatic script from the recovery partition.\nDo you have any idea how this could work?\nThanks for your help!\n\nA: To set the flag to boot in safe mode is the easiest:\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"-x\"\nThe I guess we have to do something with;\nrc.boot figures out the type of boot (Multi-User, Safe, CD-ROM, Network etc.). In case of a network boot (the sysctl variable kern.netboot will be set to 1 in which case), it runs /etc/rc.netboot with a start argument.\nand this;\n/etc/rc finally launches /sbin/SystemStarter to handle startup items from locations such as /System/Library/StartupItems and /Library/StartupItems. A StartupItem is a program, usually a shell script, whose name matches the folder name. The folder contains a property list file containing key-value pairs such as Description, Provides, Requires, OrderPreference, start/stop messages etc. You can run SystemStarter -n -D as root to have the program print debugging and dependency information (without actually running anything).\nref: Link\n", "Q: Why can't Finder be closed using command+q? command+q has no effect on Finder, which means there is no way of closing a whole Finder window using a keyboard shortcut. Instead, you have to use command+w to close all of its tabs one by one.\nI understand that Finder is treated differently and that it is a special application, but it just seems awkward and inconsistent, because to me as a user, Finder is a file manager and I expect it to respond to command+q like any other program would. Why does Finder even appear in OS X's Application Switcher (command+tab), if it cannot be closed? \nIt seems to me that Finder is somewhat special because OS X does not distinguish the file manager from the whole desktop environment. From OS X's perspective, closing Finder would be closing the Desktop, the Bars, and even the Application Switcher, which is why it is blocked.\nNow, my actual question:\nHow can I close a Finder window without closing each tab on its own?\n\nA: You can use cmd + alt + w  to close All windows.\n\nA: You can close all windows of an application (including Finder) with ⌘+⌥+w.\nYou can add a quit option to the Finder by running:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder QuitMenuItem -bool YES && killall Finder\nConsidering Finder is responsible for the desktop icons, quitting it rather pointless, but have it!\n\nA: Think of Finder as explorer.exe on Windows.  It is like the shell, it must always be running.\n\nA: The main purpose of the Application Switcher is switching between applications which includes Finder as well. As you can't quit the Finder directly you can't quit it from the Switcher either.\n\nA: Finder is a special application and must always be running. Even if you go to Force Quit menu - there is no 'Force Quit' for Finder process, only 'Relaunch'.\n", "Q: \"This is a startup partition.

However, the Disk partitions doesn't have a drive for me to drag and said that it was a startup partition so I can't decrease it's size.  \n\nA: In order to increase your Windows partition, you will need to first free up disk space on your Macintosh HD partition, as it appears to be full.  128GB isn't very much these days, I would recommend getting a larger hard drive, but transferring larger, less frequently used items such as movies or videos can often help free up large amount of space.  \n", "Q: Laptop drops wifi when moving from one WAP to another one, with same SSID I have two WAPs in my house with the same SSID, different channels, far apart from each other to offer coverage.\nWhen I physically move my laptop, while on, from one to the other it loses the wifi connection. I have to turn wifi off then back on to get it to work again.\nI have other devices, iphone and Android, which manage to work seamlessly across the house. The only problem is with the Mac laptop.

Can you do a Get Info on the original and verify the Name & Extension (and that the extension is not hidden, and that there are no spaces at the end of the name)?\n\nA: Just Change what you want to change on the duplicate, then replace the old hosts file.\n\nA: The best way I have found to change hosts settings is to:\n1) Make a duplicate (which you already have done)\n2) Move the duplicate to a new location, such as the desktop\n3) Make another duplicate on the desktop and rename it \"hosts ORIGINAL\" so you know it is the original hosts file, in case you need to revert back.\n4) Make the changes to \"hosts\" on the desktop and save it.\n5) Delete or rename the \"hosts\" file in /etc to \"hosts OLD\"\n6) Drag \"hosts\" from the desktop to /etc. (you may be asked for admin credentials)\n\nA: I encountered this problem in Yosemite 10.10.3. I couldn't find the solution until I started to think outside the box.\nMost people don’t know it, but as default the ”/private/etc” folder and ”/private/etc/hosts” file permissions are set to ”read only”. So if you only change the ”hosts” file permissions to ”read and write” you still won’t be able to edit it in TextEdit. The ”hosts” file is locked due to the ”/private/etc” folder.  The trick is that you need to change both the permissions of ”/private/etc” folder then ”/private/etc/hosts” file.\nsudo chmod 777 /private/etc;chmod 777 /private/etc/hosts;open -t /private/etc/hosts\nI don't care if it is a bug or not!\n", "Q: AppleScript executes itself again after a reboot it initiated. How to avoid that? I have a shell script that is run by an AppleScript app.\nThat shell script restarts the machine at some point with shutdown -r now. \nHow can I avoid having the AppleScript application automatically launch itself again after the reboot?\n\n\n*\n\n*The app is not included in the startup items\n\n*The app is launched again just like any other open app when the shell script restarts OS X\n\n\nThe sequence is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*I double click on the AppleScript app \n\n*AppleScript launches a shell script in Terminal \n\n*The shell script, at some point, reboots the system\n\n*The AppleScript app starts again after the reboot\n\n\nA: Have your AppleScript write an empty file to a predefined location and test for its existance when the script starts. If the file is already there, delete it and quit the script; otherwise proceed as normal and reboot.\n\nA: You can try to redirect the shell command with\ndo shell script \"insert_your_command &>/dev/null &\"\n\nand then tell you app to quit\nEDIT\nYou can add a delay before redirecting the command as well.\n do shell script \"(sleep 5 ; insert_your_command) &>/dev/null &\"\n\n\nA: My guess is OS X is restoring the Apple Script App state after it restarts.  You could possibly try and have the Apple Script delete it's own application state right before the restart command, though I haven't verified that this works, or is possible.  It should be located in, ~/Library/Saved Application State/.  \n\nA: Ok found it.\nThe shell script needed to have the following lines:\nosascript -e 'tell app \"System Events\" to restart'\nkillall \"Terminal\"\n\nThe shell commands above initiate the restart through an ad hoc Apple Script command, but kill the Terminal immediately after. This has the effect to quit the Apple Script app just before the OS X restart process does it. Therefore, OS X doesn't put the Apple Script app in the list of open apps that need to be re-opened after the restart.\nTwo side effects of using this method:\n\n\n*\n\n*rebooting through that Apple Script command leaves a chance to the user to save unsaved work from open apps, unlike the shutdown -r now shell command which forces an immediate reboot.\n\n*Terminal still gets abruptly killed, which may be an issue if processes are running in other Terminal windows/tabs\n\n", "Q: Viewing VGA to USB input on a MacBook Pro I want to use my MacBook as a monitor and keyboard and mouse for my Windows PC.

I do not want to use a slow Wi-Fi connection to do this.\nOne option would be to just display the GUI of the PC on my laptop via a VGA to USB adapter. Another option would be to use an Ethernet connection from my PC to my Mac laptop using VNC however I do not know about the speeds.\n\nA: Easy enough to do with Microsoft Remote Desktop, available for free on the app store.\nIf you plug an Ethernet cable between the two computers they should negotiate a network connection and you will get gigabit speeds.\nNote that this is different for what you can do with an iMac where you plug a Display Port video cable into the iMac and use the iMac as just a display. To the best of my knowledge Apple does not support this on its portables, only the iMacs so you are limited to whatever Microsoft Remote Desktop will support using RDP.\nIt is possible that there are other apps that might do a better job. VNC is a 3rd party open source remote control app, similar to Microsoft Remote Desktop except you will have to install it on both machines. There might be others that give you better performance but the MS app and a VLC app would be the place to start.\n", "Q: What can developers see in my address book?

Can I download anything that will allow this to work? \n\nA: You will need to use a computer with 10.6 (snow leopard) or earlier if you want to run that software on a Mac. Maybe a friend has an older computer you can borrow. Or maybe it will work on a computer lab machine. \nOther Options:\n1) Try running it on a Windows PC (I'm guessing backwards compatibility will be better)\n2) Virtual Machine. It looks like Snow Leopard on Virtual Box is very difficult (and I'm guessing illegal) but maybe you can get your hands on a copy of Windows that will work.\n\nA: If your Mac supports Snow Leopard, and you have or can get an install disc for it, you could install SL on an external hard disk and boot from that when you need to run this DVD - restart, wait for the startup sound then hold down the Option key to choose which volume to start up from. That way you don't need to mess about with your current Lion install. If your Mac came with Lion when it was new it probably won't run SL but you can check at everymac.com\nIf you have or can get an install disc for a version of Windows that the DVD supports then you could install that in a virtual machine e.g. Virtualbox.\nAs a last resort you can pick up an actual PowerPC Mac pretty cheap on eBay, and resell it for a similar price once you're done.

If you care to try that, the Terminal command is:\nkillall Dock\n(But first use killall -s Dock to make sure the command will only kill the one process.)\n", "Q: Yosemite does not like emptying the trash I am on Yosemite (10.10.1) and I noticed the annoying habit of not wanting to empty the trash -- it keeps whining that The operation can’t be completed because the item “whatever” is in use.  This is starting to piss me off - I can go to .Trash and remove stuff by hand, but is going on?   Once a file is not in use and has been binned, why can't the OS recognise it's not actually linked to any application?  This problem has come up whether the app used for that kind of file is still open or not btw.\n\nA: To find out what file(s) in your Trash are in use, and by whom:\nlsof +D ~/.Trash\n\nThe command name in the first column will be truncated. If it's truncated so much that you cannot identify the process, the second column contains the pid (Process ID), which you can cross-reference in Activity Monitor. Or get additional info using ps -p pid.\nNote:\nIt has been suggested that the command:\nsudo rm -rf ~/.Trash\n\nmay be useful here. This is not the case!\nIf a file is in use (which is the scenario the question is about), it cannot be removed! Not even by root.\nThe suggested command may be useful if:\n\n\n*\n\n*You are in an admin account (or in sudoers, which I discourage as a security weakness), and  \n\n*The only reason you cannot remove the file is that its permissions deny deletion.\n\n\nIn general there are three reasons why you might not be able to empty the trash, and each reason has its own cure.\n\n\n*\n\n*If the file (or folder) is locked, you can either unlock it or hold down the option key while emptying the trash.\n\n*If permissions do not allow you to remove the file, you can either change the permissions to allow it, or use sudo to override the file's permissions.\n\n*If the file is in use, your only recourse is to find the process that is using the file and make it stop using it. In the simplest case, trying again after a short wait is all it takes. It may be necessary to force quit the app, and the purpose of the lsof command is to determine which app needs to be quit. However, even root cannot remove a file that is in use.\nThe takeaway is that the problem \"I cannot empty the trash\" does not have a one-size-fits-all solution. When you are told that something is in use, do not waste time trying to apply a fix that doesn't fit that situation.\nI have also seen it suggested that Secure Empty Trash may be helpful. Again, this is not the case! Secure Empty Trash will overwrite the sectors on disk that the file's data was stored in, but only after the file is successfully deleted. If you can't delete the file, for whatever reason, it won't be deleted or overwritten. If the file is hard-linked, deleting it only deletes one of its links. As long as other links remain, the underlying inode is not deleted and the file's disk space is not overwritten.\n\nA: It does mean that file is in use, so removing it may affect the application which is using it. you can use lsof or fs_usage to monitor what process is using them e.g.\n$ lsof -T|grep Arial\nSkype       311 auniyal  txt      REG                1,4     774476  499182 /Library/Fonts/Microsoft/Arial.ttf\n\n", "Q: Root user able to access FileVault 2 encrypted drive If you use FV2 to encrypt a disk, can the root user of the computer access the unencrypted contents of the disk or is it truly only accessible by the user that initially setup FV2.\nWe are trying to deploy FV2 across our company and trying to see if we should set a Firmware Password to restrict access to boot commands or if FV2 will be sufficient.\n\nA: Once you've logged in using one of the users set up for FV2, the unencrypted data is available to all users on the computer.

I have a game installed from Steam on my Mac (Crusader Kings II).  The most recent patch from the developer has been having crashes and freezes on my Mac, and I'd like to help give the developer as much debugging information as possible (I'm an iOS developer myself).\nOne of the problems with the game involved the game completely freezing up.  To assist in debugging, I used the Time Profiler from Xcode Instruments and attached it to the game.  When it froze, I could see what exactly was using up processor time, and I've reported this to the developer.\nHowever, the other problem with the game is a hard crash to the desktop.  Normally, when applications (like Xcode) completely crash, OS X will give me an error report that will include useful information, like the stack trace.  However, when this game crashes, I get nothing.  It just completely disappears.  The process is no longer in the Force Quit list, but I also get no crash report.\nIs there any way, using Xcode Instruments, or any other means, to determine exactly what state the application is in in the instant just before it crashes?\nMy computer is a Mac Mini (late 2012 model) and I'm on OS X 10.10.1 if that matters.\n\nA: One possible way would be running:\nsudo dtruss -n <app_executable>\n\nwhere <app_executable> is the name of the executable file in the the app bundle in the Contents\\MacOS folder inside the app.\nFor example, if you wanted to debug iTunes, you would first find out the executable name:\nls -alh /Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/MacOS/\n\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 root wheel 170 Mar 30 21:01 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 11 root wheel 374 Mar 30 21:01 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root wheel 102 Mar 30 21:02 iTunesHelper.app\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root wheel 29M Mar 29 02:01 iTunes <<<<<<<< this one\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root wheel 18K Mar 29 02:00 iTunesASUHelper\n\nYou can also do it by right-clicking an app in Finder and selecting Show Package Contents.\nOnce you figured out it is iTunes you can use the following command:\nsudo dtruss -n iTunes\n\nThis will display a lot low-level info, but might contain something useful to identify the cause of a crash.\nOther potentially useful built-in utilities are: iosnoop, iotop, opensnoop, execsnoop, opensnoop which are all based on dtrace which is also usable on its own. They all have man pages so you can use e.g. man iosnoop in a terminal for details on usage. All of them require sudo.\nOn the other hand, if you want to see what files are accessed by an app you could grep the output of fs_usage:\n# display files accessed by google chrome\nsudo fs_usage | grep -i chrome\n\n", "Q: Accessing network created by Internet Sharing I would like to be able to access services on devices that are connected to my shared network.\nBasically I have set up network sharing such that when I connect via Thunderbolt-Ethernet I share the connection over wifi. In order to do this my mac (I guess) creates some virtual network for devices to be be issued an IP address on. So what I would like to be able to do is to bridge (??) this network so that I can access the devices on it.\nMore specifically I would like to be able to access a service on a specific port that a device on the share's network is hosting.\nIs this possible? And if so how?\n\nA: The issue was my proxy settings. I had proxy setting configured which were not valid for the network my host machine was connected to. For some reason this was not an issue over HTTP but HTTPS refused connections...\n", "Q: OS X Finder sorting by date shows some files in incorrect order Is there any logic behind OS X's file sorting patterns?\nHere is a screenshot of two file dialogs open side by side:\n\nWhy on the left it is labeled as \"no date\" and on the right it is \"today\"?\nWhat is the purpose of \"no date\" anyway? Isn't it kind of useless, especially appearing on the very bottom of the list?\nIs there any fix for this?\nI'm on Mavericks.\n\nA: Caching.\nNot all Finder dialogs use the latest information available for a file to improve performance. Information such as that is loaded asynchronously, but this sometimes fails and doesn't show the correct information.\nIf a directory is taking too long to load, Finder may sometimes prefer to load partial information rather than not listing the directory contents in a timely manner. If this data is never loaded, it is never cached and is consistently listed incorrectly in certain circumstances.\nThis can usually be fixed by remounting the partition (if applicable) or restarting.\n\nA: The dialog on the left seems to be a File Open dialog, not a Finder window. (Note the word Open in the title bar, and the Cancel/Open buttons at the bottom.)\nIf the app is opening photos, it may be more interested in the date the photo was taken, rather than any modify/creation/access date associated with the underlying file. Finder, of course, is only interested in dates associated with the underlying file, and has no interest in the date the photo was taken nor any other EXIF tags.\nThe dates associated with the underlying file always have a value. EXIF tags may be missing. EXIF dates and file dates need not match in any way.\n\nA: Force quit Finder. You can do this by pressing the option+command+esc keys and then selecting Finder from the list and clicking on the Relaunch button.\nThen, delete the Finder's preferences file by launching the Terminal app and entering the following command:\nrm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist\n\n", "Q: \"A graphics problem has been detected\" MacBookPro11,3\n2.5 GHz i7\nIntel Iris Pro and NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M (auto graphics switching on, it was on intel)\nOSX 10.10.1\nThe system appeared to freeze. iStat Menu's clock stopped, the cursor wouldn't move, etc. I tried (physically) closing and reopening, but it didn't go to sleep and the apple logo light on the back stayed on.

Far as I know it's limited to the 15 inch machines, at least from what I've been reading. Yosemite basically crashes on graphics switching. Check out the lengthy forum posts over on apple.com. Basically, all you can do for now is turn off graphics switching and prey they solve it in the next version. I posted a radar to them some weeks ago on the topic and engineering requested more information. So, they definitely know about it. Some people on Macrumours were posting that the latest beta solved the issue, but it's probably too soon to tell. The down side of turing off graphics switching is that it reduces battery life significantly, but at least you can still use your machine.\n\nA: I have installed a GPU driver from NVidia and I haven't had any freezes for a month. I have then switched back to the native driver and I got a freeze in less than a day. So I am fairly confident that a different driver fixes the issue.\nThe driver installation procedure is not straightforward, but is well documented on Daniel Kramnik's website.\n\n\n*\n\n*First, go to NVidia drivers download page and download a driver which works on OS X, for example Quadro K5000 for Mac - Quadro ODE Graphics Driver.\n\n*Then, download \"Auxilliary Tools for Xcode - Late July 2012\" on the Apple developer website. You don't have to have a paid Apple developer program membership.\n\n*Mount the downloaded Auxiliary Tools .dmg and drag PackageMaker to your /Applications/ folder.\n\n*Right click on the downloaded NVidia driver .pkg and select Open With -> Flat Package Editor.\n\n*Drag the Distribution file out from the Flat Package Editor and place it in a folder, for example alongside the downloaded driver.\n\n*Open the Distribution file in a text editor and remove the line\nif (!validateHardware()) return false;\n\n*Save the edited file, delete the original Distribution file in the Flat Package Editor and replace it with the edited one.\n\n*Save the modified driver .pkg and run it. You should be able to install the NVidia GPU driver.\n\n*Restart your computer to start using the NVidia GPU driver.\n\n\nCredit for the suggestion to try a different driver goes to Shmup Fiend in the original apple discussions thread.\nCredit for the driver installation procedure goes to Daniel Kramnik, as mentioned above.\n\nA: It's probably the Focusrite's Saffire Mix Control since that's a 3rd party app (I think).\nTry going to System Preferences > Energy Saver and make sure all of the setting are to your liking.\nIf this problem persists, try turning off Automatic Graphic Switching in both the Battery and Power Adapter menus.\nAnd make sure you click Report in case it's a bug in the operating system, which is possible since OSX 10.10 is fairly new.\n\nA: Sorry for delayed reply, due to the holidays.\nFirst of all I would recommend some basic maintenance based on number of errors your have in different sections, that might also need some repairs.\n1 - Use Disk utility and repair permissions.\n2 - Then use the cmd-r and repair the user ACL's (via terminal -password reset but without actual password reset).\n3 - Then I would recommend to temporary disable trouble makers like GitHub for Mac app.\nNow test again and if needed report here.\n\nA: This appears to have been solved. See: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6596475\n\nI also tried booting into Diagnostics and some other stuff.\n  Then I tried creating a new user, and found that the error was user specific.\n  So I logged back into my user and found all the files named\n    Kernel_<datestamp>_<computername>.gpuRestart\n  in /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports. And I just moved away those files, and the error popup disappeared ...\n\n", "Q: Full wifi signal but horrible download speeds I'm connecting my MacBook to the internet via a current generation Apple Airport Extreme (late 2013). When I'm standing next to the Airport, my Mac's wifi indicator shows full signal strength (duh!) and I get excellent download speeds (30-50mbps). When I'm on the other side of the house, my MacBook still shows full signal strength but I can barely load anything (.25mbps... if I'm lucky)! \nWhat gives? Why would the signal be strong but I can't download anything?\n\nA: WiFi signal strength only tells just that, the strength of the signal.\nIt is a prerequisite to have a good connection.\nHow ever that does not tell you about the Quality.\nIf you have high interference (from devices or Neighboring networks) then your RSSI will be high. It should be <70 or better (the lower the better).\nThen there is the Transmit Rate value that will tell you the actual data transmit rate.\nTo look up all those values hold the option (alt) key while clicking on the WiFi Icon.\n", "Q: Does Facebook have Ads now? Does Facebook have Ads now?\nOr does my Safari have a virus?\nHas anyone experienced a Twitter Ad on their Facebook?\n\n\nA: I've always had ads on Facebook. The content of your ads depends on what websites you recently visited on the Internet. For example, after I searched for some used motherboards, I started seeing ads of motherboard on Facebook.\nYou may be able to change this by going though your security and advertisement settings on Facebook.\nEdit: Here's a link to the Facebook Ads settings page.\n", "Q: How to delete Apple ID without password?

Any luck? If not...\n\nSecond:\nStart up in Safe Mode. Among other things, this purges certain system caches, which may be corrupted, and subsequently rebuilds them.\nShut down your machine, and then restart it while holding Shift at the chime (let go after two seconds).

Must be some setting which I mucked around with.\n\nA: After installing a Yosemite update, my desktop icons all disappeared. I had three desktops open and I noticed that when I paged back and forth between the desktops, the icons would appear momentarily and then disappear.

The machine is brand new, so there isn't a HUGE amount of data on it (nor are there any Time Machine backups), but I'd like to avoid having to wipe the drive.\nIf there's nothing I can do, does Apple have a history of issuing hotfixes for issues like this?\n\nA: I spoke with Apple and my case was escalated.  I sent in logs for the engineers to evaluate, and they determined that the FileVault encryption had failed.  As other users have reported, the only suggestion was to make a Time Machine backup, wipe the drive, reinstall Yosemite, and restore from the Time Machine backup.\nA few important notes (from forum posts I've read):\n\n\n*\n\n*When you wipe the drive, select Journaled.  It defaults to Journaled, Encrypted, but leaving encryption enabled will not solve the problem.\n\n*A Time Machine backup is not required to wipe the drive and reinstall OS X Yosemite, but it's the easiest way to retain your data.\n\n*You must un-check FileVault during the initial OS X setup, otherwise this problem might reoccur.  Of course, it might work the second time around... but why take the risk?  Wait for Apple to fix this bug before you enable FileVault again.\n\n*If you restore from the Time Machine backup during the OS X installation, you won't be prompted to enable FileVault and it should be off by default.\n\n\nIf this solution is not satisfactory, you might find some guidance from this guide on failed FileVault encryption.  I considered a similar approach (I found that guide by searching Google for \"killing corestoraged\"), but ultimately decided to go with the tried and true (and tedious) approach of a full reinstall.\nFor posterity, a partial excerpt of the aforementioned guide:\n\nSo scanning for the according process turned out that corestoraged was\n  causing the high load. Giving it a 50/50 chance to fix it or to\n  destroy my system completely I had an idea how to fix it. So first I\n  tried to simply kill the process. That worked but after a few seconds\n  the process reappeared – so it must have been started from another\n  daemon. It turned out that actually the launchd is kicking off this\n  process. So either to go through the whole tutorial [2] I decided to\n  do a quick fix/trial. So my idea was to move the daemon binary and\n  than to kill the process. So I did the following:\nfirebird:~ jvr$ mv /usr/libexec/corestoraged /usr/libexec/corestoraged.old\nfirebird:~ jvr$ killall corestoraged\n\nAnd suprisingly the load dropped, while my operating system was still working. Please note that\n  this is highly risky and I would not recommend to do it unless you\n  don’t see any other options.\nIt should be also noted that there is definitely a better solution in\n  place related to the launchd configuration. Neither the less Apple\n  should get their FileVault running stable, especially since it has to\n  be considered as a core service.\n[2014/09/09] Update: Already giving up my hope to fix the issue\n  permanently, I started to backup my MacBook and prepare for a\n  re-installation. Even if the above workaround resolved the CPU usage &\n  power consumption issue, I did not feel comfortable moving around core\n  processes, where I was not 100% sure what they are doing. So I backed\n  up everything and started cleaning my machine. Having everything done\n  so far I decided to start the Mac in Recovery mode and try one more\n  time the disk repair functionality (especially the fix permissions).\n  After doing this, I thought I give it one more last try. Booted up,\n  moved the corestoraged back and checked in the FileVault progress\n  screen within the Security Settings. And suddenly I saw that the\n  encryption process was working again. This time I did not touch the\n  machine anymore until the encryption was finished.\nAnd what I have learned from this lesson – do backups. And the second\n  lesson I’ve learned: never go the easy way and start reinstalling your\n  operating system.\n\n\nA: I want to share the solution that fixed the problem for me.\nFirst of all, my El Capitan install failed, resulting in that after boot the login screen was shown, but after a login, there was a kernel panic and the Mac restarted.\nSo I tried to reinstall via the Recovery Mode, but at the point of selected the HD, I got this message: FileVault conversion in progress.\nUse the \"Security and Privacy\" preference pane to check conversion status.\nThese steps solved my problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go the Recovery mode (hold cmd + R during boot)\n\n*Open a terminal, and type: diskuitl cs list result: Conversion Progress: Paused\n\n*I opened a second terminal window\n\n*Searched for the binary 'corestoraged': file / -name 'corestorage*'\n\n*Found it in the recovery folder: /usr/libexec/corestoraged\n\n*Started corestoraged in the found folder: ./corestoraged\n\n*Now check the HD via the first terminal, the Conversion progress now showed a percentage, and after an hour, the HD was converted.\n\n*Then I could reinstall El Capitan from the same recovery mode.\n\n*After the reinstall, everything was like it was.\n\n\nA: Get the latest update to Yosemite! After checking for various fixes, installed 10.10.3 and issue resolved itself.\n\nA: I asked after this while attending WWDC 2015 and was told that the \"Encryption Paused\" issue was addressed in 10.10.3. \nThe root cause was a problem with resizing the CoreStorage volume during the encryption process. When the CoreStorage volume was unable to grow, the encryption was paused and could not resume until the resize issue was addressed.\nTo fix this issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update your Mac to 10.10.3 or boot from an alternate drive which is running 10.10.3.\n\n*Unlock the encrypted drive if necessary\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Run the following command to get your Mac's disk identifier:\ndiskutil list\n\n\n*Once you have the disk identifier information, run the following command with root privileges:\nfsck_cs -y disk_identifier_goes_here\n\n\n*fsck_cs should repair the CoreStorage volume and address the resizing issue. As part of the output, it should show that encryption is resuming.\n\nA: Here's what worked for me based on this post from the Apple forum:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot and reset PRAM by holding Option+Command+P+R\n\n*It quickly rebooted again and I held Command+R to enter recovery mode.\n\n*Select Disk Utility\n\n*I saw my base \"Macintosh HD\" plus an encrypted \"Macintosh HD\" beneath it. Select the encrypted partition and then select File/Unlock and enter your password.\n\n*Select \"Repair Disk\" (took 1-2 minutes)\n\n*Select \"Repair Disk Permissions\" (took 1-2 minutes)\n\n*Select the base \"Macintosh HD\" partition and select \"Repair Disk\" (took 3-4 minutes)\n\n*Reboot (Apple menu I think)\n\n*Log in and open System Preferences/Security & Privacy/FireVault\n\n*Encryption was still \"Paused\" at this point, but I disconnected and reconnected my power and then encryption restarted and finished quickly (<1 minute).\n\n\nHope that helps.\n\nA: I second Peter's (Dec 18) comments.\nI had a brand new out of the box 11\" MBAir picked up this December 2014. FileVault paused during set up asking for the power adapter.\nA senior Apple advisor said Apple engineers say there is nothing wrong with the computer - you can use it. \nWhat you can't do is turn FileVault off. The engineers consider this a cosmetic issue. Their first suggestion is to leave the laptop on without sleep for 24 hours - they discovered that in \"many cases\" the error resolves itself.\nSince I had no data on the drive (see Peter's suggestions if you do), they had me wipe the drive in Terminal, initiate a netboot, select \"Reinstall Yosemite\" from the OS X Utilities windows that follows a netboot. Then, after download and install, DON'T activate FileVault during set up. (apparently wiping the drive in Terminal is important - reinstalling Yosemite alone won't solve the problem).\nSo far my laptop now appears good as new.\n\nA: I've been looking into this problem for about a year (my laptop has FileVault enabled since its initial installation but never completed. I ended up doing the following double copy to and from a USB drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use SuperDuper to create a full system backup on a USB drive.\n\n*Boot from it (SuperDuper does that automatically)\n\n*Use Disk Util to recreate the main partition. (*)\n\n*Use SuperDuper again to create a backup of the main partition on the\nUSB drive onto the now fresh partition.\n\n*Boot from the internal drive again.\n\n*Restart FileVault, and this time let it complete before anything else ...\n\n\n(*) If you accidentally deleted the Recovery Partition, you can recreate it by booting into Recovery Mode (Cmd-R) and 'Reinstall Yosemite', which will only reinstall the OS, but will leave your data alone.\nI hope this helps people recover nicely from this problem. Now onto installing the Captain.\n\nA: This issue can also be caused by the UPS (Uninterruptable Power Supply) bug in El Capitan (same thing that's keeping Time Machine from running automatically).\nI ran into this on a brand new machine. The Disk Utility repair did nothing, but I remembered reading about the UPS & Time Machine bug. When I disconnected the UPS and rebooted, both Time Machine and File Vault worked normally.\nIf you have a UPS and are running El Cap, disconnect the UPS and reboot. Try this first and you will probably save yourself some time.\n\nA: In macOS Big Sur I found a rather simply trick: Simply cause I/O to an APFS volume which is stuck in partial FileVault encryption. Simply copy a file to that volume and delete it again. That re-triggers the encryption process, where no other method re-triggerd it!\nWith diskutil ap list <YourDiskID>the status of Encryption Progress: changed from xx.x% (Paused) (Unlocked) to then xx.x% (Unlocked)\nWorked for an external USB 3.1 attached SSD with a bootable volume stuck in initial FileVault encryption while being booted into my internal SSD.\n\nA: Try smc reset and reboot the computer will be ok \n", "Q: Install and import site-packages for Python 2 and 3 on Mac I installed brew and then\nbrew install python\nbrew install python3\n\nInstall flask with pip\npip install flask\n\nTry\npython -c 'import flask'\n\nBut I got exception\nImportError: No module named flask\n\nSet and export PYTHONPATH\nexport PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages\n\nSo far so good.

Is it a good idea to upgrade to Yosemite?\nNow it has Mac OS 10.9.5. It has 1TB hard drive, 4GB Ram. \nWill the upgrade make it go slower? Is it safer to keep the old opeating system?\n\nA: Everyone gets a different experience, so apart from Googling what other iMac 2,8 users experienced, the best course of action is to see for yourself. Take a Time Machine backup of your computer, get Yosemite, and see how it goes. If anything goes wrong, you can always wipe your hard drive and restore it from the Mavericks backup. (Just remember to find another way to back up important files that you've modified post-upgrade, such as emailing them to yourself or putting them on a flash drive.)\n\nA: No do not do it. Wait for the next update. You will have at least blurry text in everywhere. Period. \n\nA: I'm using Yosemite with good results on a 2.66 GHz Early 2008 20\" iMac (8,1).

I also can't drag items from the download stack that I have beside my trash can in the dock. Dragging the item simply does nothing. If I drag it somewhere and release the mouse button, it just opens the app/file.\nAnd in Finder, I am only able to drag and move/copy 86 items.

But then things went right back to not working again. Going to test some things to see what might be causing it to revert.\nUpdate 2\nIt turns out that restarting does fix it temporarily and repair permissions has nothing to do with it. I am assuming I didn't notice this before because it is being caused by an application that was reopening (because I usually check off the \"Reopen applications\" option).\nUpdate 3\nFor clarity, here are videos showing what the issue is.  \nIn this video it is working as it should be (right after a restart):http://youtu.be/DO4KsLiLveo\nIn this video it is not working:http://youtu.be/V48UKWlG1sE\n\nA: I know it may seem totally unrelated, but if you have the Pushbullet extension installed for chrome, try disabling \"Universal copy & paste\".  You may need a restart afterwards.\n\nA: Repair Permissions cannot possibly fix this problem.\nRepair Permissions only sets permissions on files/folders back to the permissions they were installed with, and only if they were installed using Apple's Installer. (And it doesn't even do that well.)\nNOTHING in your home folder was installed that way.\nNOTHING in your home folder will even be looked at by Repair Permissions.  \nNot your Dock. Not anything on your Dock. Not Dock's preferences.  \nLet's look at things that might actually cause the symptoms described.\n\nFirst, there used to be a problem where people would accidentally drag things off their Finder sidebar and wonder where they'd gone. Apple fixed that by requiring you to hold down the command key while dragging items off the sidebar, which was consistent with the way toolbar items and menubar items work. That led to a rash of queries: why can't I drag anything off my sidebar any more? Yosemite went back to the old behavior: you no longer need to command-drag to get things off the sidebar. (Instead, it seems you now need to command-drag to put something on the sidebar! I wonder whose bright idea that was?)\nWhy am I talking about the sidebar when the question is about the Dock? Because we expect the UI to behave the same everywhere. You still need to command-drag to take something off the menubar or toolbar. You used to need command-drag to remove something from the sidebar. It feels intuitively obvious that you should need to command-drag to get something off the Dock.\nBut surprise! On Yosemite, command-drag to or from the Dock \"locks\" the Dock for the duration of the drag. The reason is to make it easier to drag something onto an app or into a folder that's on the Dock. By command-dragging, you stop the Dock icons from dancing away from your mouse. It even lets you drag a document that's on the Dock onto an app that's on the Dock. Normally, drag-and-drop from the Dock would remove the document from the Dock no matter where you tried to drop it. But now, command-drag from the Dock signals that you're trying to drag-and-drop the item, not remove it.\nSo, just as a wild guess, is it possible that you can't drag from the Dock because you're holding down the command key? Muscle memory is insidious. It makes you do things without even realizing you're doing them.\n\nAs another wild guess... I tried to use a friend's Mac, and kept running up against walls like this where things just weren't working as expected. It turns out my friend likes Sticky Keys, and has it turned on all the time. I'd carelessly press the control key to do something, then change my mind, blissfully unaware that the control key was now stuck down. Everywhere I clicked, a contextual menu would pop up surprisingly. I didn't realize what was going on because I rarely use a MacBook Pro and thought it was just my muscle memory not adapting to its tiny (by comparison) trackpad.\nSo, is it possible that you're accidentally turning on Sticky Keys? It's easy to do. Just tap the shift key five times without pressing an ordinary key. Then it's easy to start doing command drags without actually holding down the command key. Tap the shift key five more times to turn it off.\n\nA: I know that when dragging items off of the Dock to remove them, it has changed slightly.  Previously, as soon as you would drag a item off the Dock and release the mouse button, it would disappear.  Now, when I drag icons off the Dock, I need to hold the icon off the Dock for a second or two before it realizes I'm intending to remove it.  A little annoying, but not a game changer.\nIf you are still having issues with the Dock, you can try the terminal command\n\nkillall Dock\n\nThe next thing to try would be to Repair Permissions.  Open Disk Utility, select the drive from the list on the left, and click Repair Disk Permissions.  When it is finished, restart your computer.  According to Apple, repairing the permissions only applies to \"files installed by the Mac OS X Installer, Software Update, or an Apple software installer. It doesn’t repair permissions for your documents, your home folder, or third-party applications.\"\n\nA: I found the only correct answer to remove the unwanted items that are on the dock is to shutdown the computer and then go through a restart and the items that are not wanted will still be there, then arrow over the item in the dock not wanted and right click and hold down and you will see one of two things Quit or Force Quit, arrow over one of these let go and its gone.\nTry it it works, glad to help   \n\nA: I have in the past had occasional mishaps and accidentally removed items from the dock. In Yosemite, to my delight, I found that I have to drag the item farther away from the dock toward the center of the screen before they go poof. This prevents those accidental removals.\n", "Q: Are symlinks recognized by iCloud?

I thought of putting symlinks that point to the user folders in the iCloud folder in ~/Library/Mobile Documents. Does anyone have authoritative information to tell if these symlink targets will be synced with iCloud similar to the way symlinks can be used with Dropbox?\n\nA: Yes, symlinks work fine with iCloud.

I want to make sure I get all the facts out so that hopefully I can get some help.  There is s TL;DR version below if you don't want the blow-by-blow edition.\nMy wife has been complaining about the speed of her Late 2011 MacBook Pro for the last year.  I finally broke down and decided to give it a boost by upping the memory to 16gb (from the stock 4gb) and replacing the 500gb HDD with a 480gb Crucial M500 SSD.\nMy plan was to simply swap the drives, replace the memory, then boot to System Recovery Mode (Cmd - R at boot) and do a fresh install.  I started the Disk Utility and created a new partition on the SSD no problems.  I think picked the option for \"Fresh Install\".  The first thing I noted was that it wanted to install Lion instead of Mavericks, which was on it, but figured whatever...it would update as soon as I get things rebuilt.  I would then use a Roswell SATA-to-USB cable to mount the old drive and do a \"recovery\" of all her old date.  The system did the initial download as part of the System Recovery Mode, then said it was rebooting to complete the install.  At this point, I got the white Apple screen with the spinner...but it kept spinning, and spinning, and spinning.  No indication it was actually doing anything, just spinning.\nI let it run for another hour or so, then finally killed it by holding the power for 10sec.  I tried the install again, but again I get the white screen with the spinner.  This happens at least one more time.\nFinally I try a different approach.  Once again, I boot to System Recovery Mode.  I again erase the drive, but this time in Disk Utility I try to do a \"Recovery\" from the old drive to the new drive.  I hit the 'Go' button, it says \"Setting up...\" for about 10min (I believe it was trying to calculate the time), then pops up with an estimated time to restore the new SSD from the old as 7hrs.  I checked it a few times before bed to make sure the progress was moving, then went to bed at about 10% or so.\nThis morning, however, when I checked the status I find that it's still stuck at like 15%.  The system is not locked up: I can move the mouse, drag the window, etc.  I hit Cancel on the restoration, and it says it's cancelling, but nothing.\nAnother 20-30min later it still says \"Cancelling...\".  So, once again I force-cycle the power, and once again I hit Disk Utility.  This time, however, when I try to erase the disk, it gets to EXACTLY the same spot the restoration got stuck at, then pauses.  I left it there when I left for work, but I have a feeling something is fishy that is causing it to do this.\nTD;DR\nI am trying to replace my wife's HDD with an SSD.  I performed the following attempts using System Recovery to no avail:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fresh install of Lion...seemed to get stuck after reboot\n\n*Restore using Disk Utility from the old HDD to the new SSD...stuck at 15%-ish, and now the drive will not erase (gets stuck at 15%-ish)\n\n\nQuestion\nIs the drive just bad or is there some other technique/process I need to use in order to change the drive out other than what I have tried?\n\nA: I ran into somewhat similar troubles, and discovered that there were many bad blocks on the drive (also from Crucial). Using Disk Utility to do a 1-pass security wipe (choose \"Security Options\" from the Erase tab in Disk Utility while the drive is selected and ) solved the problem entirely. Do this while started up from another disk (or the Recovery partition if you don't have another disk, like a OS X Install Flash drive).\nAlso consider installing Trim after you get everything installed, though be aware that there are some issues with Yosemite.\n", "Q: Restore a lost partition from degraded software mirror RAID I used to store my valuable files on Apple software RAID (mirror). Recently one disk has failed and the mirror became degraded.\nI rebuilt the mirror using new drive, following this guide, but seems like there are no partitions on it.\nI believe the data on the healthy drive is not corrupted. What programs should I use at this point to retrieve if not the lost partition, but data?\n\nA: You can try the following programs to retrieve your data from lost/damaged partitions: FileSalvage, Data Rescue, Stellar Phoenix Mac Data Recovery, DiskWarrior. The good practice is to create an image of the actual partition and restore data from it.\n", "Q: Where does Yosemite store cache files for exchange accounts? My problem is, that the server of my exchange account crashed today and it is maybe not possible to restore the database of the server.\nAre there any files on my Mac or in my TimeMachine BackUp, where for example my notes, or calendar entries are stored for offline use?\nI only found the stored data from my iCloud account in the folder:\nuser / Library / Containers / com.apple.Notes / Data / Library / CoreData / ExternalRecords / B059E164-CC3A-44ED-AB92-C703BDD09455 / IMAPNote / _records /...\n\nA: You are pretty close for the Notes.

I tried to edit textfile via Pages, but it does not handle pure text file?! I can not believe it. Any idea how to edit / read it?\n\nA: I use Textastic for basic coding on my iPad but it is also available for iPhone. However, it is $8.99 so you will have to judge if it is worth it. Most coding apps will work with straight text files without altering them with formatting.

I'm also running OSX Yosemite if that helps.\n", "Q: Best way to delete \"SetupAssistantPlugins\" on Yosemite? I noticed that in the InternetAccounts folder in the System Library on my iMac's HD (late 2012) that there are a bunch of folders that contain \".iaplugins\" from such unwanted companies such as Facebook, 126, 123, AOL, Google, LinkedIn, Flicker, Yahoo, and Twitter. I have no idea what these are for and have no desire to have my Mac associated with any of these \"accounts\" (there are a few for Apple accounts, such as iCloud, Mail, Notes, AddressBook, etc.). I assume I should leave the Apple plugins, but is it safe to delete the third-party plugins, and, if so, what is the best way?\n\nA: These aren't third-party plugins, but actually first-party plugins (created by Apple) for third-party services. It is not recommended to delete these, as with anything in the /System directory, however you can if you wish, using Finder or Terminal (authentication will be required).\n", "Q: Device to extend bluetooth range? Is there device that will extend the range of Bluetooth? We currently have a Mac Mini setup to control a board room, but we have problems with a magic mouse when it is on the other side of the room from the mac mini.\n\nA: Yes. They're called \"Bluetooth Extenders.\" I have never used one so I can't offer specific advice, but I did look into them once for a similar problem.\nHere's the one I planned on buying.

But I also have a Debian machine on the same local network, and I would like to back it up (at least one of its hard disks) on the same Apple Time Capsule. Is this possible?\nTo prevent misunderstandings: I found zillions of places on the Web where people explain how to use a Debian machine as a cheaper version of Apple Time Capsule. This is not what I need. What I need is to back up the Debian machine on a (real) Apple Time Capsule. Thanks in advance for any advice!\n\nA: In AirPort Utility, turn off the backup feature, turn off disk encryption, and turn on disk sharing with a password. Now you can connect to the disk over the network using the AFP protocol.\nIn most graphical file explorers you can now connect to the disk using the address afp://<ip-address-of-airport>. To easily configure scheduled backups to the device, you can check out Déjà Dup (known as simply “Backup” in Ubuntu).\nYou cannot backuo your Macs using Time Machine and your Linux machine to the same device. The two setups are incompatible as Time Machine requires proprietary extension to AFP. I would recommend you get a cheap Raspberry Pi and a two-terabyte power-over-USB-external-disk to host your Linux backup needs. (Install openssh and ufw, and you’re basically done setting up a simplistic firewalled backup device on the cheap.)\n", "Q: Time Machine space I have a iMac with a hard drive of 1TB. Used 536 GB. It has an external hard drive of 1TB with Time Machine and the normal copies.

She downloaded the installer and ran it.  It said it completed, but Flash is not working in Chrome or Safari.  I downloaded the uninstaller from Adobe and ran it to uninstall Flash.  It said it was successful.  I then redownloaded the Flash installer and ran it successfully.  Still, Flash is not working in either browser.\nIdeas?\n\nA: One place to check is chrome://plugins/ in Google Chrome. Just type that into the address bar and hit ENTER. You should see a list of all the plugins that are available through Chrome. If you've downloaded and installed Flash, you should see two entries there. One for your own install and one for the version of Flash that comes bundled with Chrome. It will also tell you there if the plugin is disabled or enabled.\nAlso if you go into Settings in Chrome and search for \"Flash\" it will highlight the \"Content Settings...\" button under Privacy. Check Plug-Ins under there and see whether \"Block all\" has been chosen from the available \"Run automatically|Click to play|Block all\" options.\nAnother thing to check for are ClickToPlugin or ClickToFlash extensions that can be set to selectively block Flash plugins. You can find the installed Chrome extensions with \"Extensions\" from the Window menu and the installed Safari extensions with \"Safari Extensions...\" under the Safari application menu.\n\nA: There are 2 types of Adobe Flash.\nOne is already a part of the Browsers, called Plugin\nTo check in Chrome type chrome://plugins/ in the address bar, and see if it is enabled.\nThe other one is the Stand alone version of Flash player that will show up in your System Preferences.\n", "Q: How is it possible to remotely access photos on iPhone?

It was not jailbroken (at least, by me), and it did not appear such: no Cydia app or other oddities.\nPhoto Stream and iCloud backup for photos were also off, and I never used them.\n\nA: Dropbox, Google+ and other similar apps offer the ability to automatically upload new photos to your cloud storage. Do you have anything like that installed?\n", "Q: Copying iOS autocorrect custom dictionary among devices Is it possible to create a file of autocorrect entries for iOS devices and deploy it to all my company iPads (8 of them right now)? There are about 150 autocorrect entries that we'd like to setup on all the iPads.  Ideally, we would find a way to manage them centrally.  \nWe tried textexpander on the iPads (love it for the Mac - its indespensible), but on the iPads its actually slow. The keyboard lag led to riots among my staff.  \n\nA: Do you actually want an autocorrect for a misspelling or a keyboard shortcut for an abbreviation?\nIf you sync the iPads with the same computer they should have all the same keyboard shortcuts. i.e. \"omw\" becomes \"On my way!\" (without the quotes).\nThat shortcut I created on my iPhone but I am typing now on my Mac Pro and it expanded to the full phrase as I typed it.\nI use this one all the time \"mcx\" becomes \"Mac OSX\".\nLook at the \"System Preferences > Keyboard > Text\" tab for shortcuts on your computer. If you create them on the desktop computer they should sync to your iOS device(s) and vice versa.\nCheck this link here if you want to try to copy the actual file:\nWhere is the text expansion file located with OS X?\nHappy Wednesday!\n\nA: You need only login to the same iCloud Account on all your devices. Their custom dictionaries (this would be were your dictionary additions are added) will then sync through iCloud. The same applies to keyboard shortcuts/expansions.\nAvailable since iOS 6.

Thank you !\nP.D. By the way, I'm in Yosemite ... maybe it has something to do \n\nA: NEVER manipulate directly any of the files in ~/Library/Preferences. All preferences are managed by a background process named cfprefsd (short for Core Foundation PREFerences Daemon), which slurps up and caches in RAM the files in ~/Library/Preferences. It used to be that you could often get away with manipulating preference files behind cfprefsd's back, so to speak, but cfprefsd has recently gotten very aggressive about how much it caches.\nInstead of editing one of these files, ask cfprefsd for a copy, edit the copy, and then send the contents of the copy back to cfprefsd. Your interface to cfprefsd is the defaults shell command.\nFor example, to edit the preferences for the com.apple.sidebarlists domain:\ndefaults read com.apple.sidebarlists > ~/Desktop/sidebarlists.txt\n... edit sidebarlists.txt to your heart's content\ndefaults write com.apple.sidebarlist \"$(cat ~/Desktop/sidebarlist.txt)\"\n\nYou will need to make Finder aware of the changes, so throw in\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to quit'\nsleep 0.2 # not always necessary\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to activate'\n\nRemember to play nicely with other programs. Killing isn't nice, so don't kill anything (especially not cfprefsd) that you don't absolutely need to kill. Don't jerk around with another program's persistent store while it's running. In particular, since cfprefsd is always running, NEVER directly alter the contents of ~/Library/Preferences/*.\nIf you need to delete a preferences file, the right way is with:\ndefaults delete its.domain.name\n\nLet cfprefsd worry about getting rid of the file (or, as it is wont to do nowadays, rewriting an essentially empty file on top of it).\nThe filename ~/Desktop/sidbarlist.txt is, of course, only an example. Use a .plist extension instead of .txt if you prefer. The file will be in NextStep text plist format. \nIf you prefer some other property list format, use pllist -convert .... Or let the defaults command write it as a .plist file in a format of its choosing with\ndefaults write ~/Desktop/sidebarlists \"$(defaults read com.apple.sidebarlists)\"\n... edit the file ...\ndefaults write com.apple.sidebarlists \"$(defaults read ~/Desktop/sidebarlists)\"\n\nBut the important thing is that you keep your copy, the one you edit or otherwise manipulate, out of ~/Library/Preferences. Let defaults worry about communicating with cfprefsd, and let cfprefsd worry about manipulating ~/Library/Preferences.\n\nA: Thanks for posting this information - it was very useful in helping me come up with a solution for the sidebar issue within Yosemite.\nOur users take their sidebar folders seriously and so we needed to come up with a way of backing up and restoring the contents of the sidebarlists.plist, since Yosemite is so flaky.\nI originally tried this method:\nBackup:\nmkdir -p /Users/Shared/SidebarBackup/\n\ndefaults read com.apple.sidebarlists.plist > /Users/Shared/SidebarBackup/SBLbackup.plist\n\nRestore:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to quit'\n\nsleep 0.2\n\ndefaults delete com.applesidebarlists.plist\n\nsleep 0.2\n\ndefaults write com.apple.sidebarlist \"$(cat /Users/Shared/SidebarBackup/SBLbackup.plist)\"\n\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to activate'\n\nAnd found that after restarting the Mac the items were restored but as soon as you launched a Finder window, it would bomb out and you would need to kill finder, delete the plist and then restart before Finder was functional again.\nSo after much playing around this is the final outcome and it works like a charm:\nBackup:\nmkdir -p ~/Library/Preferences/Backups\n\ndefaults export com.apple.sidebarlists ~/Library/Preferences/Backups/Sidebarlists.plist\n\nRestore:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to quit'\n\nsleep 0.2\n\ndefaults delete com.apple.sidebarlists.plist\n\nsleep 0.2\n\ndefaults import com.apple.sidebarlists.plist ~/Library/Preferences/Backups/Sidebarlists.plist\n\nsleep 0.2\n\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to activate'\n\nPlan on making this a Casper self-service item (The self-service backup works fine but the restore script doesn't run properly.. If it's not one thing, it's another....)\n\nA: I don't think Finder plists update until after restart.  So if you're looking to restore sidebar shortcuts, or trash them altogether, you're not going to see the changes until you reboot.\n", "Q: restore notes iCloud IMAP I've deleted \"notes\" IMAP folder. Now I have no notes on Macbook, iPhone, iPad.\nPlease help me to restore my notes.

That's where my Notes seem to be stored. If that doesn't work, you can dig out the individual files representing your Notes within that folder.\nThe directory structure of the com.apple.Notes folder is very odd.

After switching from PCs I was astonished to find I could only write emails in black, unless I wanted to take extra steps to change the black to another color, wasting time.  Is it so difficult to provide default color?  It's done for email \"quote levels.\"\n\nA: Apple Mail, since at least 10.4, has never provided a way to set a default font or color that will be seen by recipients.  The preferences settings are for local viewing only. Many have asked for this to be changed, but they clearly do not care. You have to use another email client or one of the addons which have been created to compensate for this (whose names escape me at the moment).\n", "Q: My itunes songs won't appear at all on my mac book On my old computer I had a bunch of songs on itunes, and when I went on my mac there are no songs on that computer even though I am logged on my itunes account. Where are my songs?\n\nA: The only way that iTunes automatically syncs music between computers is if you have iTunes Match enabled. This costs $29/year.\nIf what you want is to have the music you have purchased from the iTunes Store available, you will have to download that music to your new device.\nIf you're using iTunes 12, click the iTunes Store tab in your Music view.

I am searching for an accurate way to start using storage tape drives for backing up my data. The only people I know of using tape drives on Macs are Mac Pro users. I'm an iMac user (2011, 27\") and the choices of cables are very limited.\nSome of the tape drives use SCSI (many different kinds) and some use SAS. Any ideas on how to connect something like that to the iMac?\nI know of drives that have Thunderbolt capabilities, but they're pretty expensive. I'd love to start with something affordable, if possible.\nThanks!\n\nA: And this is the answer, after careful research:\nThere is NO possible way to do this. SAS cannot be installed on an iMac. Apple likes to surprise its users by making an aluminum shell that cannot be altered. There are SCSI to USB converters, all discontinued, expensive and unreliable. There is the ATTO ThunderLink, which uses the Thunderbolt port, but this costs over a thousand. Likewise, SCSI cannot be installed on an iMac.\nThe simple solution is that serious computer users who like to perform surgery should purchase a Mac Pro, which can accept SCSI/SAS installations. These computers will work with storage tape. As for iMac, external hard drives (though I would prefer something that won't crash on me after a year of operation) are the only method of huge data storage. $60-$100 will get you a few TB.\nAny suggestions on a reliable brand?\n\nA: Your average drive is only warrantied for three years and then you are gambling with it as soon as you use it. Likewise, after several days of research, the conclusion was that the Hitachi Ultrastar drives are the best. Specifically the 3TB drives as they were the least likely to fail by a significant margin. These drives come with a five year warranty as well. The data was compiled from large data warehouses.\nBut still they are susceptible to failure and ones best option is to use a NAS/RAID with a two drive redundancy for extra safety. Something like the Drobo 5N. Also, it takes SAS drives as well, see link below.\nAs far as SATA to SAS drives go, a SAS connection will apparently take a SATA drive but not the other way around. Unfortunately, the Macs have a SATA connection. However,  it might be possible to by an adaptor but it just gets messy from here.\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/answers/id-1904656/connect-sas-hard-drive-sata-interface.html\n\n*http://www.drobo.com/drobo-drive-compatibility/\n\nA: There is no inexpensive solution to this problem.\nThe only way to put a SAS interface on a modern Mac (none of which have expansion slots) is via Thunderbolt.\nOne solution (and probably the most viable) is to get a Thunderbolt-attached SAS interfaces.  Expect to pay $700-1000 for such an interface.\nAlternatively, you might be able to roll your own with a Thunderbolt-attached expansion chassis that includes a PCIe slot.  Then install a SAS interface in that slot.  But this configuration may have little support from the manufacturers and could cost as much as a dedicated Thunderbolt-SAS interface.\n", "Q: Cannot install rabbitmq management tool I need to install the rabbitmq management tool, but enabling results in the error (please see below).

This basically means th  iPod runs in disk mode as an external hard drive and is connected to a windows pc. I’m unable to research these data points and don’t know what they mean:\nRetracts:   58\nReallocs: 16376\nPending Sectors: 0\nPowerOn Hours: 643\nStart/Stops: 8781\nTemp Current: 34C\nTemp: Min 14C\nTemp: Max 56C\n\nWhen I load more than 2GB of songs onto it, it loads up the software and then it sipmly says \"no songs\" on the screen, even when itunes shows that some memory is occupied\nCan any of this explain what’s wrong with my iPod?\n\nA: To help explain what the numbers mean here is an extract from the Wikipedia S.M.A.R.T. article:\nReallocated Sectors Count (Reallocs):\n\nCount of reallocated sectors. When the hard drive finds a read/write/verification error, it marks that sector as \"reallocated\" and transfers data to a special reserved area (spare area). This process is also known as remapping, and reallocated sectors are called \"remaps\". The raw value normally represents a count of the bad sectors that have been found and remapped. Thus, the higher the attribute value, the more sectors the drive has had to reallocate. This allows a drive with bad sectors to continue operation; however, a drive which has had any reallocations at all is significantly more likely to fail in the near future. While primarily used as a metric of the life expectancy of the drive, this number also affects performance. As the count of reallocated sectors increases, the read/write speed tends to become worse because the drive head is forced to seek to the reserved area whenever a remap is accessed. If sequential access speed is critical, the remapped sectors can be manually marked as bad blocks in the file system in order to prevent their use.\n\nPending Sector Count:\n\nCount of \"unstable\" sectors (waiting to be remapped, because of unrecoverable read errors). If an unstable sector is subsequently read successfully, the sector is remapped and this value is decreased. Read errors on a sector will not remap the sector immediately (since the correct value cannot be read and so the value to remap is not known, and also it might become readable later); instead, the drive firmware remembers that the sector needs to be remapped, and will remap it the next time it's written. However some drives will not immediately remap such sectors when written; instead the drive will first attempt to write to the problem sector and if the write operation is successful then the sector will be marked good (in this case, the \"Reallocation Event Count\" (0xC4) will not be increased). This is a serious shortcoming, for if such a drive contains marginal sectors that consistently fail only after some time has passed following a successful write operation, then the drive will never remap these problem sectors.\n\nLarge numbers of Reallocs or Pending Sectors would suggest your drive is failing and that you may need to repair or replace your iPod. \nYour Pending Sector Count is ok but your Reallocated Sectors Count is extremely high. Usually a sector holds 512 bytes. The 16376 reallocs mean that already 8 MB have been reallocated.\nMy 4 year old iPod Classic still has only 0 reallocs and 0 pending sectors.\nThough i haven't been able to find any information about the number of sparse sectors on HDDs, I doubt that your iPod Classic has any more left. Probably you have some more (irreplaceable) bad blocks which renders your iPod unusable.\n\nA: It's been a while since I've done this, so I don't recall the exact steps, but you can mount the drive of your iPod on your desktop, and then run diagnostics such as Disk Utility on it.\n\nA: Nothing may be wrong with the iPod based on how you “load up the songs”\nUnless you “jailbreak / modify” the iPod or write to the library format, simply copying files to it in disk mode won’t let the iPod play the songs.\nDisk mode lets you use it as a disk to store PC files on it - not that the iPod can scan for changes and then use the media.\nPerhaps a follow on question explaining what you want to do with the iPod and how this data is “wrong” will get you a step closer to using it the manner you choose / intend. It could be the drive has failed and needs to be reformatted and given another chance to have iTunes load 2.1 GB of songs or it could be a failure and you need to repair the device (perhaps swapping the drive due to excessive reallocations). \n", "Q: What characters might be used to substitute for colon in folder names using a time-of-day? It is often convenient to name files and folders with a date and time, such as standard ISO 8601 format: 2014-12-10T22:35:28.460Z.\nUnfortunately, the Mac’s HFS+ file system uses the COLON as a path separator just as Unix-like OSes use SOLIDUS / (slash) and Microsoft OSes use REVERSE SOLIDUS \\ (backslash). All three characters must be avoided when naming a file or folder for compatibility.\nWhat character might be commonly used as a replacement for the COLON? \n\n\n*\n\n*Using a HYPHEN - makes it tricky to programmatically reverse the conversion to standard format. \n\n*Similarly, using a FULL STOP . (period) makes reverse conversion difficult as they will be misinterpreted as fractional seconds.\n\n\nFor example, when programming in Java 8 on OS X Mountain Lion, calling File::mkdir() for string 2014-12-11T21:33:08 results in a folder named 2014-12-11T21/33/08.\n\nA: The raised colon, Unicode 0x02F8 ( raised colon ˸ vs colon : ) would not be interpreted as a separator by Finder or other scripts.  (More info about the raised colon here: http://www.charbase.com/02f8-unicode-modifier-letter-raised-colon )\nThe way to enter that character varies, depending on your OS X version.  More details can be found at Apple's support page: http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201586\n\nA: ISO 8601 “Basic” variation\nYou can avoid using the colon by employing ISO 8601 “basic” format strings (YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ) for naming files and folders. The standard allows for the separators to be omitted from the YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ format.\nSo both of these examples are valid under the standard:\n\n2016-03-27T07:01:02Z\n20160327T070102Z\n\nIf you need to process those strings with certain programming or scripting languages then maybe you have to convert them to the extended format that incorporates separators (hyphens, colons) and time zone info.\nInternational standard date and time notation - \"If a date and a time value are stored together in a single data field, then ISO 8601 suggests that they should be separated by a latin capital letter T, as in 19951231T235959\". So the T in the middle is optional (19951231235959) but suggested.\n\nA: I've investigated this too. Most of the alternative glyphs with the word 'colon' in the description are decidedly unattractive as a colon replacement (˸, ܄, ﹕, ᠄, ：, ︓, and ꞉).\nThere is another alternative that at least has a similar character width to the original colon - the mathematical symbol for a ratio:  ∶. It looks great in a number of monospaced fonts, but it is a little small in the default MacOS system font.\nHere it is being used in a file name:\n/Users/me/Books/Book Title: Book Subtitle.pdf  [restricted colon glyph]\n/Users/me/Books/Book Title∶ Book Subtitle.pdf  [permitted ratio glyph]\n\nA: The Hebrew punctuation ׃ works great for me ... unicode 05C3 ... \n", "Q: Why does memory appear near full even after upgrade? I've just upgraded my MacBook Pro from 4GB to 8GB. Before the upgrade, I looked in the Activity Monitor and it said that it was using almost 3.98GB of 4GB (I'm a web developer, so I usually have lots of apps open.) Then after the upgrade Activity Monitor shows that it is using about 7.50GB of 8GB (with the same apps opened.) The upgrade improved the performance of the Mac, it is surprisingly faster than before, but I was hoping to see more memory available after this upgrade.\nThanks for your help! \n\nA: The old days keeping as much RAM free as possible are gone.\nThe new RAM management from OS X, use all available memory, but also manages it so that you get maximum performances.\nIf you look in the Activity Monitor- memory, you will see things like Memory Pressure, Compressed among other information. \n\nA: You'd probably had a lot of compressed memory in your 4GB days. Now, with 8GB, you're not nearing your limit yet so your computer doesn't see a need to compress anything. If you ever hit 7.99GB, you'll start building up compressed memory again. (I recently went from 4GB to 10GB, and I'm currently using 9.97GB but only have 7.1MB of compressed memory.)\n\nA: There are potentially a few things happening here.\nWhen a computer runs out of available RAM it starts swapping or paging data out of RAM to files on your hard disk. When your Mac was previously saying that it was using 3.98GB of 4GB it could also potentially have had a lot more data loaded but part of it swapped out to your hard drive. You can find these swapfiles on your Mac in /var/vm called swapfile0 and swapfile1, etc. Similar to Windows where you'll find a file called pagefile.sys, typically in the root of the C drive. If your Mac is actively storing data in swapfiles you'll see the amount that is being used listed in Activity Monitor as \"Swap Used\".\nCompressed memory is a newer concept where the operating system tries to get the most out of physical memory by compressing the least-recently-used contents of RAM before resorting to paging out, but it can only go so far. Once it can't compress anything else it'll start paging out to swapfiles.\nAnother thing that could be happening that might explain why your upgraded machine is sitting at 7.5GB of 8GB used, is that once you close applications and files the operating system doesn't immediately release that space in RAM. It'll store that data in a file cache, until it needs to use that space for something else, so that if you decide to open the same files again it can open them almost instantly. You can see this in action where you start up your Mac and it takes maybe five-ten seconds to launch an application the first time, but if you close it and open it a second time it opens much much faster, because that data was never released from RAM. You can also see the size of the \"File Cache\" value listed in Activity Monitor. So it could be that 5GB of your RAM is the stuff you are actually using right now, and 2.5GB is stuff that you were using recently and your Mac is keeping handy just in case.\nThere is more going on with memory management than just these things, but these are the ones that I think most likely explain what you're seeing. Chances are before the upgrade you Macbook was using more than 4GB because some data was paged out to swapfiles, and now your Macbook could be actually using less than 8GB but using up the free space with a file cache that allows it to quickly reopen things you recently closed.\n", "Q: Is there any way to use Preview to view files on another server? I own a Mac and ssh into a Linux server.  How can I view a file on the Linux server using the Preview program on my Mac, without having to explicitly copy it to my Mac beforehand?\n\nA: You cannot as Preview runs on the Mac and loads all the data into itself before rendering it.\nIn general this is how all OS X programs work, the data has to be transferred into the app running in the Macs memeory\nWhat can be done is using X11 the normal Linux display mechanism, which was designed to work across a network. You can have X11 programs running on the server that display on another machine. Unfortunately Apple's GUI does not support this (an earlier version did but we suspect for the cost of licensing this was replaced)\n\nA: You could use the file transfer application CyberDuck to connect to the Linux server, using your ssh credentials, and then thanks to Quick Look you can  preview your images and many other file types without explicitly copying them, altough you are in effect downloading the data to have the preview.\n", "Q: Can I use dual 4k Dell P2815Q monitors on the Retina MacBook Pro (late 2013) with Yosemite at full resolution? \n*\n\n*Will this monitor plug-and-play with Yosemite on this MacBook model without having to install Xcode and mess around with creating custom settings?\n\n*Can I have two of these plugged into this MacBook and run them both at 4k (at either 30Hz or 60Hz)? - I don't care so much about refresh rates as I do about resolution.

Nothing is showing up in the disk utility or in disk warrior (and yes, the enclosure works OK, I checked the SATA cable, etc, etc).  I'm at a loss for what to do next.  \n\nA: This is more than likely a hardware problem with the SSD. Specifically, the SATA input/or SSD controller, based on the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*The problem occurred after swapping the drive out from one machine into another. \n\n*You have connected the SSD to three different SATA cables (two internal, one external). None have recognized it. This rules out a bad SATA cable.\n\n*The drive is not recognized in any form of recovery. This rules out a corrupted filesystem.\n\n*The drive does not even mount when connected externally. This rules out a corrupted partition scheme and is a common symptom of physical failure. \n\n\nAll of the above point to physical failure of the drive. \nFirst, I’d clean the SATA input on the drive using 99% isopropyl alcohol (not 91!%), then test again using the mentioned enclosure. \nIf it still isn’t mounting, at all, check the drive’s warranty and contact the manufacturer for a replacement, if applicable.

But the messages do not get marked as read, so they are shown/counted as unread in the Mail sidebar.\nHow can I mark mail that goes to Junk and Trash folders as read automatically?\n\n\nA: For Junk Mail, you can create a Rule. From the menu bar item “Mail”, select > Preferences > Rules > Add Rule. Make a rule with the following conditions:\n\nFor Trash, you can simply bypass Mail’s Trash and rely on the server settings of the email account. To do so, from the “Mail” menu bar item (again) > Preferences > Accounts > [select account] > Mailbox Behaviors > uncheck “Move Deleted Messages To the Trash Mailbox”\n\nA: Unfortunately the short answer here is likely to be; you can't.\nTo understand why, it's important to note that are two places where your junk mail will be filtered out.\nClient Side Filtering\nThe settings you are looking at in Mail are for client-side junk mail filtering, this means that as messages are downloaded from your e-mail provider, Mail will attempt to identify if any are spam, and move them to your Junk mailbox(es).\nMessages being filtered in this way should be marked as read if that's the behaviour you have configured under your Junk settings.\nClient side filtering often gives you the most flexible control, but the downside is that settings will be specific only to your mail client (Mail.app), so if you access your e-mail on another device, your junk mail may still arrive directly into your inbox.\nServer Side Filtering\nThe other place that junk mail filtering may occur is on your e-mail provider's own mail servers; these will attempt to identify junk and delete or filter it before it is downloaded into Mail. This can be great if properly configured, as it will be consistent across all devices, and usually requires no extra configuration.\nHowever the downside to this is that junk mail filtered by your mail server won't normally be processed by client-side rules, so if the messages aren't marked as read by your server, they won't be marked as read by Mail.app, and at time of writing there is still no way to define a rule that can override this (as Mail does not allow rules to trigger only for messages in a certain mailbox).\nSome e-mail providers don't mark junk mail as read by default, and provide no means of customising the behaviour. The most common example I'm aware of (and personally aggravated by) is Microsoft's Outlook 365 (previously Hotmail) service. Even though it offers server-side rules, these don't allow any control of automatically filtered junk mail, so they remain marked as read, despite many, many requests by many, many people to change this.\nConclusion\nUnless your mail provider offers you some way to customise server-side filtering behaviour (usually through a webmail interface), then you may be stuck.\nHowever, if the main annoyance for you is that Mail is counting unread junk on its icon, you can change this at least by creating a new Smart Mailbox (Mailbox -> New Smart Mailbox) then create a rule that looks like the following:\n\nBasically you want to match all unread messages, except those in certain mailboxes (in our case Junk), Trash and Sent should already be excluded by default.\nNow, under Mail -> Preferences in the General tab, change \"Dock Unread Count\" to your new smart mailbox, the Mail.app icon now will only show a count of unread messages excluding your junk folder. You can also use a smart mailbox to customise notification behaviour in much the same way.\n", "Q: Can my macbook HDD be used in a windows desktop? It seems there is a formatting issue / dead hdd in my macbook, as I have the infamous ? despite ensuring a good connection with the sata cable. Is it ok to plug the 2.5\" macbook hdd into the standard sata & sata power cables on my windows desktop and check it out from there? \nIf it is working, will it show on windows? \nI have no other mac to use or a sata-usb enclosure...\nThanks,\nnuggetbram\n\nA: Have you tried to boot to the recovery partition ..Boot with Cmd-R held down, and use disk utility to check/repair the filesystem\nIn the windows PC the disk should spin up but Windows will not be able to recognise the HFS+ filesystem on it, and will offer to format it for you. Don't let it!\nParagon Software produce a tool HFS+ for Windows which will allow it to mount the disk. \nThis will probably fail in strange and interesting ways if it is in fact corrupted. Another option might be some of the Mac Disk recovery programs e.g. Diskwarrior or TechToolPro\n", "Q: I keep deleting files but my Macbook Pro hard drive is still full I have a MacBook Pro (late 2011) with a 500Gb SSD hard drive.\nToday suddenly it said that my hard drive was full, so I started removing the files. Got rid of lots of Gigas, even the sleepimage file, emptied all the trashes, etc. \nStill, it shows like nothing was deleted, only has 500 Mb free and nothing is changing.\nDo you know what the problem could be?\n\nA: Probably TimeMachine local snapshots is enabled on your Mac. Local snapshots are basically backup files stored on your local hard-disk (as opposed to regular ones stored on the external TimeMachine volume). This is a useful feature for people who travel a lot, so they can revert files to recent versions even when they are not connected to their home TimeMachine.\nTo disable \"local snapshots\" open Terminal and enter sudo tmutil disablelocal and hit ↵.\nEnter your password at the prompt (the password  will not be visible) and hit ↵ again.\nEnter exit, hit ↵ and quit Terminal.\nNow check in Finder and Disk Utility if you regained valuable disk space.\nTo reenable local snapshots just enter sudo tmutil enablelocal.\n", "Q: Mac OS X Yosemite broke my iMac I recently tried to update my iMac OS to Yosemite as most people had already done it a while ago. \nit downloaded the package when rebooted to install it. It was stuck with error message. \nIt looks as if there was an issue with hard drive preventing installation.\nI was also unfortunate to revert the installation, hence end up loosing all my files as I decided to erase the disk and create new partition. \nEven after formatting the disk and using 'Reinstall OS X' from recovery mode; I am unable to complete. \nThe screen doesn't seem to do anything stuck at 'Downloading additional components, it will automatically restart' I tried leaving it for few hours but no result.\nWould someone please share your experience?\n\nA: Try using Internet Recovery Mode instead of the regular Recovery Mode, and make sure that you formatted the right hard drive (in other words if you have an external hard drive plugged in, make sure that you formatted your actual hard drive, not your external one).\nHere is some more info about different recovery modes from Apple's support site.\n\nA: Do not worry about this issue, seems your drive + recovery are corrupt. Here's a list of stuffs you'll need to fix this problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Find a mac nearby (ask a friend or go to apple store)\n\n*Download a fresh copy of Yosemite (Apple store people can give you)\n\n*Download Lion Disk maker - To make bootable USB of Yosemite - Link : http://liondiskmaker.com\n\n*Create a bootable USB Yosemite Installation.\n\n*Boot to installation and create NEW PARTITION ( Delete previous partition* Note I'm talking about partition and not logic drives)\n\n*Creating new partition will delete your previous mac recovery, but don't worry about it. \n\n\n*Try installing Yosemite, I'm sure this time you won't be prompted by that error.  \n\n\n\nIf this worked, come back to this post again and I'll let you know how to bring or create a new recovery. \n\nA: If you need to recover your old data, you can do so using PhotoRec. It's a free program that only needs the Terminal to run (in other words, you don't need to restore you full operating system to be able to use it).\nIf you are able to boot into the Internet Recovery Mode as I mentioned in my previous reply (or even the regular Recovery Mode for that matter), then you should be able to recover your data using PhotoRec.\nAll you need to do is download PhotoRec onto a flash drive, and once you're in your preferred recovery mode, go to Utilities > Terminal. In the Terminal, you can navigate to your flash drive by typing:\ncd /Volumes/NameOfYourFlashDrive\n\nNow, you can just run PhotoRec just as you would normally run any executable from the Terminal.\n\nA: Thank you all for the response.\nI end up calling apple support and they confirmed many people were having same issues with yosemite installation. I had to perform internet recovery to go back to previous version. I have been asked to use this version until apple releases newer OS.\n\nA: I thought I had this issue.  It was just stuck on the \"Downloading Additional Components\" Screen and the progress bar wasn't moving.  Then after maybe 10 or 15 minutes, it started moving along. After a blank screen now at the \"Installing on 'Untitled'\" screen.  \n", "Q: Yosemite won't empty trash Re: Yosemite does not like emptying the trash\nSo I'm not tech savvy but am having this very same problem with the trash after upgrading to Yosemite.

I've just been given a corporate iPad mini that previously was used by someone else in my team. It appears to have been factory reset - it is taking me through the welcome and setup process (language selection/wi-fi selection/etc.), but once I've connected it to the network, it says the iPad is currently linked to an existing Apple ID (it masks it with stars, but shows enough information that I can see who that is) and asks me to sign in with that Apple ID (which I don't have). The person in question is uncontactable. Is there any way I can forcibly reset it and remove its link to that Apple ID? If not, are there any options which make it more useful than a lightweight doorstop?\n\nA: In short, no. It's a security feature to prevent thieves from selling the device on, as it is rendered useless if you don't have the person in question's apple ID and password.\n\nA: Quickest way to discover if it's possible to reset is to try it…\n\nIf you can't get that far, it's a brick.\n", "Q: Creating symlinks in \"~/Library/Application Support/minecraft\" that point to Dropbox, but \"the original item for \"[file]\" can’t be found.\" The Background:\nI use Dropbox to back up my minecraft worlds, configuration files, and various other folders (bin, launcher_profiles.json, mods, resourcepacks, saves, servers.dat, versions).\nI put symbolic links in \"~/Library/Application Support/minecraft\" which point to the files and folders in Dropbox.\nThe Problem:\nEver since I upgraded to Yosemite, the symbolic links don't work anymore, giving the error \"The operation can’t be completed because the original item for “[file]” can’t be found.\"\nI can't think of any reason that the links wouldn't work anymore.

I was using a bash script to link all the files automatically, which for some reason ends up creating symlinks that point to where they are created ('source file' is ignored and substituted with 'target file').\n\nBasically what you end up with is a file that points to itself.\nThis problem doesn't happen when you type the command into the Terminal manually for each file. You also have to specify the full path to the file you are linking, which I didn't think I needed to. Not sure why, might be a bug with bash or OS X or whatever.\nSo, instead of:\nln -s saves ~/Library/Application\\ Support/minecraft/saves\n\ntype (manually in Terminal):\nln -s ~/Dropbox/path/to/saves ~/Library/Application\\ Support/minecraft/saves\n\nHope this helps anyone who is having the same problem.\n", "Q: Once I've signed in with a previous owner's Apple ID, then set up iCloud with my own Apple ID, is the activation lock transferred to me? An iPad I have was previously set up with a different Apple ID (see my question and its duplicate). I have since obtained the Apple ID and password for the previous owner, and used those to proceed through the welcome/setup process. It then asked for an another Apple ID for iCloud, and I gave it mine. Does that mean that it is now fully 'switched over' to my Apple ID, or might the activation lock still be associated with the previous owner, were the device ever to be reset? There doesn't appear to be anywhere in the settings screen explicitly associated with the activation lock, just the iCloud ID (which according to the setup process is a separate concept).\n\nA: Apple's procedure on how to tell if a device is free from activation lock is posted pubicly:\nhttp://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201365\nThere are steps you can take on the device, but I prefer the web interface:\nhttps://www.icloud.com/activationlock/\nThe steps to remove a device from the previous owner is here: http://support.apple.com/kb/TS4515\nIt doesn't look to me like you have completed the steps needed to know it's detached from the lock.

Pressing scroll lock twice on the KVM switches between the two computers. On the Macbook scroll lock is mapped to the decrease brightness button, and pause/break is mapped to increase brightness. I can switch between the two machines, but the screen changing brightness is a bit of an annoyance.\nIs there a way to map the scroll lock button to using scroll lock on just the USB keyboard?\n\nA: Take a look at Karabiner.  It isn't very user friendly for this level of customization but it has amazing power and flexibility.\nThe PrintScreen, Scroll Lock, and PauseBreak buttons are actually F13, F14, and F15.  You would have to configure the custom private.xml with something like this.  In this example, it will remap F14 (the Scroll Lock key) to nothing but only on a Microsoft Sculpt keyboard.

Put the contacts you are sending to in a Group in your Address Book, then enter then name of the Group in the To: field. It masquerades the email addresses to the recipients and may get it past the spam filters.\n", "Q: Name of a part inside 2012 MBP 15\", below RAM slots, little pins to keep bottom cover from hitting electronics I am trying to figure out the name of a tiny black doohicky part inside my 2012 15\" Macbook Pro (unibody, non-retina). It's right below the RAM slots, between the RAM and the battery when you open up the laptop. I have circled the part in this picture from the iFixit teardown of said laptop.\n\nThere are two springy pins coming out of the part. I think it is intended to keep the bottom cover from hitting the electronics when it is closed. In my laptop one of the pins is not springy anymore, so I want to try and replace it. I have no idea what the part would be called or what search term I would use though. I was hoping someone might have an idea.\n\nA: I would call it (bar)-spacer and the part number seems to be 6813-1946 (or 6818-1946). Usually apple part numbers have the form 000-0000.\nI searched for the part at powerbookmedic but it's not available there.\n", "Q: Ridiculous number of unnecessary empty birthday calendars that can't be deleted I have an iPhone 5 running iOS 8.1.1. My Calendar app is showing me a ridiculous number of birthday calendars (\"Friends' Birthdays\" under Gmail, \"Birthdays\" under Facebook, and 8 separate calendars named \"Birthdays\" under \"Other\"). This is what the list of calendars looks like:\n\nI have no idea how they got there. I am syncing the Calendar app with Google, Facebook, and Meetup, but I can't imagine how that would produce such a ridiculous number.\nWhat can I do about these? I would like to delete or merge some of them but the app is not giving me the option. Is it possible to delete most of them without losing anyone's birthday?\nIf I look at the Calendar app on my Mac (which is running Yosemite), I don't see all of these calendars. I only see one under Google that says \"Birthdays\", another under Google that says \"Friends' Birthdays\", and one under Other that says \"Birthdays\".\nEDIT: I did some looking around and it seems like the \"Birthdays\" calendar under Gmail has my contacts' birthdays and the \"Friends' Birthdays\" calendar has my Facebook Friends' birthdays. But all of those \"Other\" birthday calendars don't seem to have a single birthday in them. I think I can delete them safely without losing anything. I just need to know how, but I don't see any sort of option to delete them.\nI logged into iCloud using the iCloud website. I clicked on the calendar icon and all I saw was two empty calendars called \"Home\" and \"Work\". I did not see all the empty birthday calendars. I didn't see anything useful or meaningful, but I wouldn't expect to because I am syncing all of my calendar events with Google, not iCloud.\nI noticed that the \"Other\" birthday calendar I saw on my Mac didn't have any birthdays in it, so I deleted it. But I refreshed the calendars on my iPhone as described here and it didn't seem to do anything. I still see 8 \"Other\" birthday calendars.\n\nA: As Insomniac Software mentioned, the Birthday calendars come from the Contacts app.\nIn the Contacts app, it (confusingly) launches at a page that shows an aggregated view of contacts from different sources.  Tapping the \"Groups\" button at the top left of the screen takes you to the list of sources.\nYou mentioned that on your Groups screen, you have two sources of contacts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Facebook.  Birthdays in this group show up in the Calendars app in the \"Facebook\" section, not in Other, so that's not the cause of the issue\n\n*On My iPhone.  Birthdays in \"Other\" come from here.\n\n\nThe problem is that, from what you've said, it sounds like your contacts are stored on your iPhone, not in iCloud - otherwise they would show up in an \"ICLOUD\" group, not an \"On My iPhone\" group.\nTo solve your calendar issue and to prevent potentially losing your contacts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select a place to store your contacts.  I'll give an example for iCloud because I suspect your contacts were there and got dumped on your phone while changing settings.  If you think you have them stored in gmail, post a comment and I'll update my answer.\n\n*Move the contacts to your selected location.  To merge them to iCloud: go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > iCloud, turn on \"Contacts\".  It should tell you \"Your contacts will be merged with iCloud\".  Tap ok to allow it.\n\n*Go back to the Contacts app, tap \"Groups\".  You should see an \"ICLOUD\" group.  It may take several minutes to sync - go get coffee and come back if you don't see it.  You should not see an \"On My iPhone\" group.\n\n\nNow, you need to make sure your contacts are there.  In the Contacts app on the Groups page, to see what's in a particular source, tap the boxes under each group heading until the checkbox is only on the one you want to see.  So, to see what's in your iCloud contacts, there should only be a checkmark on the box under the \"ICLOUD\" group heading.  Then, tap \"Done\" in the upper right corner to see the contacts - it'll only show the contacts in the selected source (i.e. iCloud).\nThen, open your Calendar app, wait a minute for it to sync, and tap Calendars.  If your 8 Birthday calendars are still there:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close the app, wait 5 minutes, check again.\n\n*If they're still there, continue.  If they're gone, you're done!\n\n\nIf your Birthday calendars are still there:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > iCloud, turn off Contacts.  Tap \"Delete contacts from my iPhone\" (very important).\n\n*Wait a minute for it to sync, then go check your Calendar app.  The Birthday calendars should be gone.  If they're not, give it a couple more minutes.  If they're still not, turn your contacts back on anyway (next step) and comment.\n\n*Go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > iCloud, turn on Contacts to get your contacts back.\n\n*Wait a minute, then go check your Calendar app.  The Birthday calendars should still be gone.\n\n\nA: I managed to remove all birthdays event on my iPhone calendar.\nI went to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars,\nIn iCloud and all my email account, I turned off calendar.\nThen I switch my phone off and on it again.\nAll birthday events in the calendar are now gone.\n\nA: Just in case anyone keeps pulling this up on google, take a look at https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7671336?start=0&tstart=0\nIt seems since iOS 10 this issue (or at least a very similar one) has reemerged, duplicating 'Facebook' and 'Other' birthday calendars hundreds of time.\n\nA: The Other Birthday entries are collected from the Contacts, not from a Calendar.\nIn the Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars screen, how many accounts do you have with Contacts enabled?\nIt will create a Birthday calendar entry under Other for each account, even if there are no contacts with birthdays entered.\n\nA: It's a little strange, but I guess those birthday calendars are related to your iCloud account.\nGot to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > iCloud and turn off and on Calendars.\nHope it helps.\n\nA: This may be due to Google Calendar. The only reliable way I have found to control what calendars get sync'd to iDevices, is a fairly hidden control panel on Google Calendar:\nhttps://www.google.com/calendar/syncselect\nThis panel allows you to select which calendars will sync to your iDevice and iCal. Simply uncheck those you don't want in iCal or iPhone, and they will disappear from those devices, but remain in your Google Calendar list.\nIf you want to know more about these Calendars, you should visit the Google Calendar site. Then select 'Settings' from the Gear icon on the right, choose the \"Calendars\" tab, and then view the calendars listed. For example, if you have Google+, Google 'helpfully' creates a Birthdays calendar from your Circles. Some calendars you can delete by hitting the 'unsubscribe' link, but others, including the Google+ Birthdays calendar, you can not delete (thanks Google). However, the sync link above will prevent them from showing on your Apple Device.\n\nA: Try going to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars\nHere, select each email account you have and toggle the switches for things like notes, calendars, contacts .etc\nif you turn off calendars, the birthdays should disappear.\n\nA: I just looked at my Calendar app and the empty birthday calendars are not there. I recently updated to iOS 8.3, and I can't imagine what else could have fixed it, so I'm guessing it was that.\n\nA: Since this issue came up again for me (and others) in iOS 10, and this post ranks so high in google, just wanted to mention that updated to 10.3 fixed it for me.\n", "Q: iOS: Tapping Update in App Store just launches the app I am trying to update my apps but cannot.\nWhen I tap the update button in the App Store it simply launches the app, not triggering the update download.\nI have a 5c running iOS 7.0\nWould anyone know how to fix this?\n\nA: Tap on the app icon to launch the full product page, and click the \"+Update\" button there, rather than the \"Update\" button on the list of updates.\nThe former works for me, the latter behaved for me as you described.\n", "Q: When installing an application is there any way to avoid any drag and drop? When installing an application from a DMG file one needs to drag the new application into the application folder (or some other folders). \nIs there any way to avoid this drag and drop (any new installed application would be automatically placed into the application folder)?\n\n\n\nA: You could copy/paste it. Might be simpler if you can't see the Apps folder right at that moment.\nIt will stay in the paste buffer so long as the .dmg is still mounted, unless overwritten by another copy action.\nFrankly, it would be far more effort than it's worth to try automate that process, for any given .dmg with random content.\n", "Q: Mac OS won't install from CD, but Windows will I had to replace the hard drive in my 2010 21.5\" iMac.  When I went to install the OS, I rebooted into the OS selection screen (using option).  The Mac OS X install disc was there (but my external HD, where I back up wasn't), so I selected it.\nIt starts by showing the Apple logo, as expected, but after a while, the logo changed to a \"cannot proceed\" icon (circle with a slash).  Thinking I installed the drive incorrectly, I tried my old WinXP CD.\nLong story short, XP is installing right now.  I used my Mac CD trying to repair the install just before the HD failed, so I know it's readable.\nEdit 1: I would like to re-iterate that the Time Machine volume doesn't show up in the boot menu either.  Shouldn't it be?\nEdit 2: When I boot in verbose mode (from the CD) it works fine up until it attempts to find the \"root device.\"  Then it just keeps repeating that it can't find it.\nEdit 3: Windows successfully installed, and the BootCamp drivers installed fine, so the CD isn't the issue either.  I'm going to try Rilakkuma's suggestion and contact Apple to get an image of the last OS version I downloaded to put on a USB.\nFinal Edit: Never could get a USB image of the latest operating system that I purchased.  Disappointed with Apple support.  I'm just keeping Windows on here (with Bootcamp drivers).\n\nA: The best way to install Mac OS X on a new drive is to clone the old drive. If I remember correctly the disk coming with Mac will not allow you to make full installation.\nInstalling WinXP onto the drive without BootCamp will turn it into MBR and therefore unusable for Mac OS X, so you will need to reformat it.\n\nA: Since your machine only shows that icon if something is not compatible with someyhing, I would say two possible things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your CD that came with the computer is messed up. Try buying a generic Snow Leopard disk online.\n\n*Your new drive is not compatible. I hope not, but it could be a possibility.\n\n\nIf you can find any error messages by booting from the disk by holding command-v, please post them here, so we can help.\n", "Q: How to stop an app from running completely on OS X?

I didn't (and still don't) really understand what I did to get into the situation, nor what it did by deleting the files, but I got away with it.\nDisclaimer: I use mac mail as an IMAP client so blowing away files willy-nilly isn't overly dangerous for me.

In Mac OS X 10.9's System preferences > Energy saver, there is a warning that says:\n\nNever letting your display go to sleep may shorten its life\n\n\nWhy would not letting my display go to sleep shorten its life?\nWhat monitors are effected by this warning?\n\nA: Realistically most Mavericks-capable systems with built-in displays, other than the early aluminum iMacs and Santa Rosa Core 2 MacBooks, have LED back-lighting which isn't going to noticeably dim with age or be affected by on/off cycling.\nIf you're driving a CRT/plasma/CCFL-LCD monitor then you have option of increasing the lifespan of the display phosphor coatings (the back-light in the case of CCFL-LCD panels), but this comes at the cost of increased stress on the driving electronics of being regularly cycled on and off.\n\nA: I think of it as the \"lawyer's light bulb\", or the equivalent of \"objects in this mirror may be closer than they appear\" [which I actually thought was a joke when I saw it for the first time]\nLeaving a light bulb on 24/7 will shorten its life, as it won't last as many years compared to if you just used it an hour a day.\nThis is, however, a 'fake' analogy, as it will still last the same number of hours, minus 'damage/wear' caused by the switching process.\nSwitching it on & off every second 24/7 will shorten its life still further, as the power-cycling will eventually cause early burn-out.\nThe analogy applies to both CRT & LCD monitors. The more you use it, the shorter its lifespan.  \nThe lawyers would like you to be aware that you can contribute to the extension of that apparent span by using it less.\n", "Q: Does enabling Enhanced Dictation in Mac dictation improve the speech recognition accuracy? In Mac Dictation, I wonder whether enabling  Enhanced Dictation impacts the speech recognition accuracy.\n\n\nA: According to that link, it affects only speed, duration & offline ability, not accuracy.\nIt downloads the database locally to your machine, allowing the Mac itself to do the work, rather than having to send it to Apple.\nPresumably, though it's not mentioned, the learning accuracy will still improve over time, as it learns from its mistakes.\n", "Q: Application eating ~840,000,000% of my CPU I noticed that sometime some application are using some impossibly high amount of my CPU according to the Activity Monitor, as the screenshots below illustrate. How comes Activity Monitor displays such high percentages?\n\n\n\n\nIcons:\n\n\n\nA: The other suggestions are good, I just wanted to ad that percentages higher than 100 are, oddly enough, not counter intuitive.\nvery simply if you see more than 100% usage (as was explained to me) it is a combination of the number of cores in the processor (usually 2 to 8) and how busy all the cores are compared to some (unknown to me) baseline.\nSo getting high percentages are not uncommon but in the end a bit confusing as this question illustrates. And honestly what is going on here, specifically, is beyond me as well.\n", "Q: Is there a way to transfer an iPad 2 to a different user without losing the game scores? I just bought a new iPad and would like to give the older iPad 2 to my kid. He's used the iPad a lot to play a variety of games, all under my user account. Is there a way to create a new user account for my kid (I'll make it part of Family Sharing, etc) without losing the game scores?\n\nA: The saved games are usually stored locally on the device, even if they are synchronised by iCloud. If you sign out of your iTunes account and sign in with his new one, there shouldn't be any loss of save game data at all.\nIf, however, you want to wipe the iPad and set it up anew for him, you'll need to backup the save information and restore it to the iPad after the clean install. To do this, I would recommend iMazing (formerly Disk Aid). It's a great app, available for both OS X and Windows, that lets you drill down into your apps to retrieve data.\nI would recommend doing a full backup in iTunes first, then use iMazing and save the \"Documents\" and \"Library\" folders from each app with a save game, so you have two backups just in case anything goes wrong. Then, once you've restored the iPad to factory settings and reinstalled the games, just use iMazing again to copy the folders back in to their respective apps.\n", "Q: Photo Stream stopped working on my iPhone Photo streaming to and from my iPhone 4 (iOS 7) and iPad Mini (iOS 8) was working well, but suddenly photos taken on the iPhone will not stream. Furthermore, in iCloud the phone is no longer listed under \"my devices\" and the only photos in the iCloud album are those from the iPad.  Yet photos taken on the iPad DO stream to the iPhone, so something is connecting the two devices. I have already checked the relevant settings on the phone, and all iCloud functions are turned on (as they have always been). The only change I know of is that the iPad is now using the latest OS 8, but the new OS does not support iPhone 4. Why is the phone still able to receive streamed photos but not showing up on iCloud, and how can I get photos streaming again from the phone? \n\nA: Did you happen to switch iCloud Photo Library on for your iPad? That could prevent proper synching of your devices as it's an iOS 8 feature and therefore wouldn't be supported on your iPhone. \nAdditionally, have you tried logging out of iCloud on the iPhone, rebooting the phone, then logging back in? \n", "Q: How to get my user data back? A few months ago, I partitioned my hard drive to install OS X Yosemite Beta, everything was fine but now that I'm trying to access to some data on my old partition user account (running on Mavericks), it looks like there is nearly nothing that remains, just some data in my documents and download folder.\nI can't remember if the data was meant to be on this account, or if it was on another one that would have been accidentally deleted/hidden.\nThe only thing that makes me think that I could get quite easily this data back is that this partition has got lot of data, something like 80 GB, compared to the extremely small size of my user folder, which is only about 4 GB (and I don't think that the apps would take as much space as 80 GB)\nSo, have you got any idea to help me solve this mystery? :) \n\nA: The easiest way to find out where all this data is, would be to go to the root of the partition in Finder, then hit Cmd+Alt+i. That will bring up the Inspector that should tell you that, yes, your partition has 80GB of data on it.\nThat's not particularly helpful in itself, but if you then select the folders contained within \"/\" that are visible (\"Applications\", \"Library\", \"System\" and \"Users\") you can see the corresponding sizes of those folders.\nIf \"/Users\" is huge, then it's possible that your data is still there but hidden for some reason. If it is, I would suggest rebooting to your Recovery Partition and resetting your User folder permissions and ACLs.\nAs a good measure, I would also repair your Disk Permissions from Disk Utility in the Recovery Partition too, just in case there's extra fluff getting in the way.\n", "Q: How can I remove the eject button from my menubar when cmd-drag won't work?

The problem I am having is working out how to automatically populate and update a pop-over menu.\nIn Excel, I can choose to create a list based on a range of cells, which is pretty much exactly the function I require. However, in Numbers I can only seem to create plain text items in a pop-up menu and not reference any cells.\nFor a little bit more info, I have a separate sheet in my workbook that contains item codes, descriptions, and prices. I can reference them normally in the other sheets. I want to be able to select a cell in one sheet and have a list / pop-up menu come up with all the item codes from the other sheet, and have it automatically update if I add a new one.\nIs this possible or will I have to switch to that horrid beast Excel?\n\nA: I had the same sort of problem and with some help from people within the Apple Support community I came up with this solution. Hopefully it will work for you.\nThis is my list of players in sheet 1. In your case, the Players name would be the item codes.\n\nHere is sheet where I want to information copied to.\n\nThe P# corresponds to the number next to the Players name in Sheet 1.

That way I can still add more names or in your case, item codes, to it.\nThis may be more complicated than you require but hopefully it helps you.\n\nA: This is possible -- see https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6894760\nYou create a source column with each of your options in a cell, select them and format as a pop up.\nYou can then copy and paste a single cell from this region to get a cell which is a pop up containing these values.\nIf you edit a value in the source column you need to repeat the copy and paste.\n\nA: Yes you can do it, \nThanks to this post https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6894760 I found SGIII's answer which explains how to solve it:\nThe first step is to put the \"Copy Style\" and \"Paste Style\" buttons in the toolbar (right click over the toolbar and personalize it)\n\nNow you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the new value(s) to your source column\n\n*Select the values in the column and choose Data Format > Pop-Up Menu\n\n*Select one of the cells in the source column (which now includes the new values in its Pop-up Menu) and click Copy Style\n\n*Select cells in the target column, and click Paste Style.  The target column will then include the (expanded) Pop-up Menu preserving the previous values.\n\n\nVoila!\n\nA: While not dynamic, MacMost has a helpful workaround: \n\n\n*\n\n*Select one of the cells using the current pop-up menu, and add a new item in the \"Pop-Up Menu\" list in the Data Format section, in the Format sidebar, under the Cell tab.\n\n*Select all the cells using the earlier pop-up menu, as well as the cell with the pop-up menu you just edited\n\n*The Data Format section will now have a message warning you that \"The selected cells contain different pop-up menu items.\" and a button below to \"Merge Menu Items\"; click the button.\n\n\nNow all of the pop-up menu items have the new menu item added, and retain their earlier values.\n", "Q: External display occasionally shows just noise When I'm at work I have my Macbook Air mid-2013 hooked up to a Samsung SyncMaster 2443 display via a ThunderBolt-to-HDMI adapter and then to a HDMI-to-DVI adapter.\nAlmost every second time I switch the display on, the display is just noise.

The problem is purely cosmetic, because after that it functions perfectly.  It doesn't seem to happen if I simply sleep it though.\nThe machine has gone through two OS upgrades, I believe starting from Mountain Lion, which I don't think had the problem, so it may have started with Mavericks, and continues with Yosemite. I currently have everything updated to the latest version.\nIt's not really a huge issue, but I'd like to fix it if possible. Any ideas?\n\nA: I've had this issue many times over the years. It's kind of like the video ram gets clogged in a way. I've solved it with a PRAM reset. Restart and before the computer actually starts up hold down Option, Command (⌘), P, and R till you hear the second startup chime. Then release the keys. This should take care of that for a while. If you get it again you can look into a SMC Reset which is a bit more complicated\n", "Q: Why can't my MacBook Air (Late 2010) stay cool? I have a MacBook Air bought in early 2011. Lately it just can't seem to stay cool. With normal load, the CPU hovers between 80ºC and 100ºC, and if I use iStat / Fan Control to turn the fans up to full, completely idle my laptop will still only cool to 75ºC.\nI've opened it up and taken a look, and there isn't an obscene amount of dust in there, though I did give it a good vacuum and dusted it with compressed air. In particular, the part of the heat sink where the fan blows through seemed a little clogged, but I took to it with a vacuum cleaner. This hasn't had any noticeable improvement.\nI'm wondering if I need to look into the heatsink, since the fan seems to run correctly (there was some dust caked onto the fan blades, but nothing that stopped it spinning).\nHere's a screenshot I took of iStat:\n\n\nA: Obviously the cooling system on any computer needs to be free of dust and fluff for it to work effectively but you've checked that.\nThe next stage is to remove the radiator and heat-pipe assembly to check on the state of the thermal coupling between the CPU and heat-pipe. Clean off the old thermal paste and replace using a thin, even layer applied to the CPU. Apple have had a few issues over the years with hot-running CPUs caused by excessive thermal paste, so don't put too much on. The idea is simply to fill in imperfections between the CPU die and the heat-pipe that would otherwise be filled by air (air makes a better insulator than a conductor).\nA cleaned and re-pasted cooler assembly should bring your temps back down again.\n", "Q: How to auto-archive mails after sent? Is it possible to auto-archive mails, after sending - or adding a separate \"Send and archive\" button?\nI use the Inbox Zero approach, so now I need to manually archive conversations that have ended.\n\nA: This is one of the many functions that are available in the Mail.app plugin Mailhub.\n\nA: Here is a list of tools that help you archive your mails automatically.\nhttps://www.macupdate.com/apps/358562/mail-archiving\nI use Mail Backup X\n", "Q: Ethernet cannot see RTA1025W modem (wi-fi can) At home I have a Dynalink RTA1025W DSL modem.\n\n\n*\n\n*MBP can obtain IP via WiFI\n\n*MBP cannot see modem or get IP via ethernet.\n\n*Ubuntu/Win7/Win8 can get IP via the same ethernet cable & modem.\n\n\nAt work:\n\n\n*\n\n*MBP can see the LAN and obtain IP via ethernet using the same USB ethernet adapter.\n\n\nWhen I'm at home and I attempt to get an IP address via ethernet, I open the network preferences | USB Ethernet | Advanced | Renew DHCP Lease. It thinks about it for a second, then puts focus in the box titled \"DHCP Client ID\", as if it expects me to type something.\nThe status remains \"cable unplugged\". Either the cable for USB Ethernet is not plugged in or the device at the other end is not responding.\nIf I try to ping my router's address (192.168.1.1) no route is found.\nI have tried many different cables, all otherwise known to be working.\nOccasionally, the network config will decided to allocate a self-assigned IP, which is not helpful. It does this at random times without any prompting from me.\nWhen I touch the USB ethernet adapter dongle it is warm (this may be normal).\nI have tried the following without success:\n\n\n*\n\n*deleting and re-adding the USB Ethernet interface\n\n*creating a new network \"location\"\n\n*removing the file com.apple.plf.plist\n\n*assigning manually an IP from the valid range\n\n*safe boot (problem occurs in safe boot)\n\n*SMC reset & wait 10 mins\n\n*PRAM reset\n\n*removing NetworkInterfaces.plist and preferences.plist\n\n*removing SystemConfiguration/*\n\n*trying a different cable\n\n*trying a different ethernet port on same modem\n\n*trying a different USB port on MBP\n\n\nAny other advice?\n\nA: Do you get the same result when starting up in safe boot?\nThis could either be an Ethernet driver or a hardware issue. One of the first things to try is perform an SMC reset (shift-ctrl-alt-power). I usually go a stage further and disconnect the battery for 10 minutes, this can clear SMC-related issues that the official method doesn't always cure such as errant SD card readers disappearing etc.).\nAfter an SMC reset perform a PRAM reset (alt-option-p-r).\nYour problem should be cleared by this stage but if not you need to look at your preference files in /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration, particularly NetworkInterfaces.plist and preferences.plist. Move them to your desktop, reboot and see if connectivity is restored.\nAnother way to check if it's a software issue is to create a clean install of OS X on an external drive. If your Ethernet port is working under the new OS then you will know it's definitely an OS problem rather than hardware.\n", "Q: Yosemite updates and prompts I am very new to using Macbook Pro, and was recommmend finding on the new Yosemite system that there are far too many prompts and synched uppdates etc.\nDoes anyone know how I can do a general disabling of them?\nFor example, I would like to remove the prompt like auto refill, when I am filling in forms for payments or I get email and facebook uppdates when I am in other apps.\n\nA: Open System Preferences and choose Notifications. From there you can silence the ones you don’t want.\n", "Q: Apple Remote Desktop Admin blocked by OS X Yosemite Firewall I'm experiencing an issue where the Firewall in OS X Yosemite is repeatedly preventing me from launching ARD Admin. \nSymptoms: Launch ARD and no window appears. I am forced to force-quit the application.\nTroubleshooting: I open up System Preferences > Security > Firewall and ensured that both ARDAgent and ScreenSharing are in the allowed list. They are. Added Remote Desktop.app for good measure, though this shouldn't be necessary.\nUpon reboot and login of the computer, I am prompted to allow ARDAgent.app through the firewall. I accept. ARD Admin then launches correctly for the duration of my session. In this environment I am forced to log out at the end of the day (there's a 60 minute inactivity timer enforced to this effect as well). Upon my next login I cannot launch ARD Admin again (its still listed in the firewall as allowed) and I am forced to repeat this troubleshooting process every day.\nInconsistencies:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sometimes the reboot and login triggers the prompt to allow ARDAgent. Sometimes it does not. I cannot consistently reproduce the behavior that allows me to use ARD Admin. I just keep rebooting until it eventually prompts me and lets me in.\n\n*Today I got the prompt to allow ARDAgent and I STILL couldn't launch ARD Admin after accepting the prompt.\n\n\nEnvironment:\niMac15,1 (Retina 5K Late 2014) running OS X Yosemite 10.10.1\nOS X Firewall Enabled\nARDAgent 3.8\nRemote Desktop (ARD Admin) 3.7.2\n\nA: Quit ARD if running, and go to [your home]/Library/Containers. Move the folder com.apple.RemoteDesktop to your desktop and see if ARD Admin still has startup issues. If it starts working properly you can trash the com.apple.RemoteDesktop folder. Note this will reset ARD and lose any custom UNIX commands you may have set up, back those commands up first before trashing the folder permanently.\n\nA: I had a similar issue as well on Mavericks.  It is very very strange that it is so hard to make an app exception.\nOn Mavericks you have two firewalls on the system.  We used a 3rd party tool called icefloor to configure the pf firewall and avoid the application based firewall.  Be sure to check icefloor's compatibility with Yosemite.\nhttp://www.techrepublic.com/article/configure-apples-built-in-network-firewall-with-icefloor/\nhttp://www.hanynet.com/icefloor/\n\"IceFloor runs on OS X 10.10 Yosemite with limited functionalities. Bandwidth management is not supported. Please do not apply any bandwidth rule on OS X 10.10 Yosemite\"\nFor me it was not a launch issue but a connection to clients issue\n", "Q: Finder search does not work properly for Tibetan unicode after Yosemite upgrade I have seen Finder is giving some issues. For me, it is working fine as long as I use Latin characters. Since I work with Tibetan, I was used to search for text. When updating to Yosemite, it stopped working properly. I have checked with various friends and all have the same issue: Yosemite indexing has changed from Mavericks.\nSo here is a description: letters of the alphabet are still indexed (like ཀ་ཁ་ག་ང་), but when they are combined (like རྒ་), Spotlight is the blue, giving no answer. Again, this used to work very well before.\nI have tried reindexing, following Apple's suggestion, but no success. It seems to be related to the indexing method itself.\nAny advice? This is a big issue as we are used to search with Finder — a feature that is normally powerful in OSX.\n\n\n\nA: I discovered recently exactly the same problem for certain Cyrillic characters. After trouble-shooting it became obvious that the culprit is lack of unicode support in the Apple indexing. The workaround is to use the alternative search - such as Find Any File.\n", "Q: Yosemite freeze at boot - no safe boot + I/O error Yesterday everything was fine but today my macbook freeze/stuck during the boot.  \nI've done this:  \n\n\n*\n\n*check + repair permission (nothing changed)\n\n*check + repair disk (nothing changed)\n\n*tried safemode (doesn't boot)\n\n*resetting pram with cmd+opt+p+r (nothing changed)\n\n*boot in verbose mode, shift+cmd+v and after \"waiting for DSMOS\" appear disk0s2: I/O error. (now 6 times, but it will continue I think )\n\n*tried to use fsck in single user mode and it says that the disk is ok\n\n*tried to reinstall the OS (nothing changed )\n\n\n\nAny idea how to solve it?\n\nA: I/O problems are a good indicator that your drive is past its best. Replace the drive or do the following...\nBack up everything of value via Target Disk Mode (if possible) then boot your MacBook from a USB or DVD installer. Run Disk Utility, selecting the secure erase/zero fill option and wipe your drive.\nThis will issue an ATA secure erase command that will fill every allocation block with a zero, automatically mapping out any bad blocks/sectors that will be causing your I/O problem. This is the modern equivalent of the old low-level format, and while there is some debate on the subject I use this method regularly and it works well - assuming the drive isn't riddled with bad blocks.\nAll FSCK does is check the file structure, it doesn't scan the drive surface to determine if the drive has any damaged sectors. Even the drive's internal SMART diagnostics may indicate all is well when in actual fact the drive is on its way out.\n", "Q: Why does iOS need to refresh when I come back to a page? Is there any way to not have an app (browser, gmail, Facebook) refresh when coming back to it?\nI don't understand where this behavior comes from or why it would be desirable. \n\nA: This is caused by low amount of available RAM on iOS devices (iPad Air 2 might be better with this) . You may try to lower RAM usage somehow (for example cleaning Cookies/Data in Safari, killing apps running in background, closing unused Safari Tabs etc.). \n", "Q: Weird behaviour, During the night, Mac wakes every hour on it's own and does this - log attached, any idea why?

It seems that for me keeping Microsoft Excel open when the mac goes to sleep, causes these strange wakeups in my case. I had tried all the obvious options. I was looking through the system logs and saw some strange entries for MS. Having quit Excel over night the wakeups have seized so far.\nI had previously wiped my disk as last resort before hardware replacement. It looks like it was to blame Excel all along!\n", "Q: Downgrade from Yosemite OS to Mavericks OS: -2003F message error Please I wanna ask you if you can help me to resolve this issue.\nI have make a handling to downgrade from Yosemite OS to Mavericks OS.\nAfter this, my Mac cannot start up, it displays a folder with question mark\nI've tried to boot with (cmd + R) but I got this strange error \"-2003F\"\n\nA: Try to boot in Safe Mode (Cmd+x) to see if it boots.

I'm at a conference and the only plug is a \"Uni Pak II\" which is a dimming power source (here's the manual).\nAt first my charging indicator on the end of the MBA plug didn't light, but I slid up the analog slider and it lit up (I knew it had worked yesterday!).\nIs there any chance of it harming my MBA or power supply to use this?\n\nA: In general, it isn't a good idea to put a power adapter on a light dimmer as the circuitry could malfunction if the voltage is too low.\nThat being said, I believe the 45W adapter for the MacBook Air will survive- it just won't charge if the dimmer reduces the voltage below 100 volts. The AC is converted into DC and then applied to a voltage regulator circuit which typically shuts down when it isn't getting enough.\n\nA: I make no guarantees here.\nProbably no harm will come to the MBA.  The power is buffered through the transformer in the power adapter.  You might burn out your power adapter if you vary (dim) the voltage while it is in operation.  \nI would also strongly suggest not plugging in the power supply to the adapter until you have adjusted the adapter to full power.\n", "Q: Very suddenly, only purchased music is showing up on iPhone ( but everything is in iTunes) So, yesterday at a stoplight, I was scrolling through the music on my iPhone 5 (running OS 7.1) to play a song (one that I had uploaded to iTunes from my own CD and had recently downloaded to the phone from the cloud).  The light went green, so I stopped fiddling with it until I got to the next light.  At that point, when I looked at my phone, I suddenly didn't see the song I was about to play.  In fact, most of my music wasn't showing up (either on the phone itself or available for download from the cloud).\nWhen I got home, I realized that the common denominator was that all the music showing up as available on my iPhone was music I had purchased via iTunes. None that I had uploaded myself was showing up.\nI double-checked the \"show all music\" setting on the iPhone, and it was still set to do that (as I always have it).  If I turn it off, I don't see any music on my iPhone at all.\nI've syched and restored my iPhone, but without any results.  All the music is still there in iTunes on my home computer, but only the minority of songs purchased via iTunes is showing up on my phone.\nThe weirdest thing to me is simply the suddenness of it.  It had been working as it always had, and suddenly wasn't.  It's possible that in my scrolling to find that song, I somehow managed to accidentally switch a setting, but other than that, there doesn't seem to be any obvious cause for the change, unless it's that I haven't updated to the latest OS8 yet. \nAny thoughts greatly appreciated!\nPeace,\nted\n\nA: It sounds like you use iTunes Match? if so, did your annual subscription run out or expire?  if so, you may need to pay the ANNUAL fee and turn the service back on.\n", "Q: contents-immutable and locking the Dock I have the following:\ndefaults write com.apple.Dock contents-immutable -bool yes\ndefaults write com.apple.Dock size-immutable -bool yes\ndefaults write com.apple.Dock position-immutable -bool yes\n\nI can run them fine from the Admin account and it works, but is there a way to do this on a non-admin account?
