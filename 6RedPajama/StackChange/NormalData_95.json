["Q: Program to compare two files line by line Is there a GUI-based program on Ubuntu that compares two files line by line and indicates where two lines do not match? If not, any console app that does the same thing?\n\nA: *\n\n*meld\n\n*tkdiff\n\n*vim\n\n\nmeld is -my- favorite.\nConsole has a command for it:\ndiff {file1} {file2}\n", "Q: Monitor never goes to sleep Am running Natty with Unity 2D\n\nA: click the top left ubuntu icon, search for \"power\" and click on \"Power Management\" and check the settings at the bottom: \"Put display to sleep when inactive for: \" see this setting is checked to \"never\". If it is, then that's why your monitor won't sleep :) if not, then this is probably beyond me I'm afraid :(\n", "Q: 11.04 much slower than 10.10 I've tested Ubuntu 11.04 clean installs in two computers, an eeepc netbook and a hp pavilion t3010.es, which is an old desktop computer (6 or 7 years) with the specs of a netbook approximately. The issue is that 11.04 runs on these two much slower than 10.10 did, almost as Windows 7 in the desktop pc. By slower I consider a general decrease on the overall performance: longer boot time, longer log in, longer startup time on almost every application I use (chromium, nautilus, banshee,... common use ones), much longer update time... I tried both unity and classic desktop modes, with barely no difference in performance on both. Is this normal? \nThanks!\n\nA: 11.04 for me is a bit slower than 10.10 but 11.04 does lean on a lot of graphical stuff with Unity (not so much with classic though so I find it odd both seem slower).\nYou did not specify where you consider 11.04 to be slower than 10.10\n\n\n*\n\n*In boottime there is not that much\ndifference. I still need to tweak my\n11.04 boot but it is close to 10.10s boottime.\n\n*And then there is normal usage: 1st time starting chromium it is\nslower than it was in 10.10. Overall\nprograms I launch from the launcher\nseem to be a little bit slower than\nwith 10.10. That includes deluge,\nsmplayer, gedit but not terminal,\ndash, usc (yes there is a trend here:\ndefault vs. added launchers).\n\n\nSo in short my answer would be: yes, it is slower but not by alot. \nA few pointers: \n\n\n*\n\n*Check logfiles for messages;\n\n*If you used the upgrade path you\nmight consider a re-install to avoid 10.10 and 11.04 conflicting somewhere;\n\n*If your boot is slow use bootchart\nto analyse your boot;\n\n*If it is a specific program that is\nslow try and start it form\ncommandline to see if it shows any\nmessages that take up time.\n\n*'Toy' around with settings regarding display settings and compositing.\n\n\nI hope you can figure out if something is wrong with your install!\n\nA: Desktop compositing is enabled by default.  If it's doing a lot of compositing work in software, that could be one very probable reason(imo).\n", "Q: Disable Accessibility in login screen There's a funny joke going through my class:\nWait for a colleague to leave his laptop and restart the laptop / change user.

I can still move my mouse, but not do anything. I can also go into the terminal, but doing a gdm restart doesn't help either (makes the terminal running the GUI display some info about how it shut down the network manager).\nSo is there a way of solving this?\nThanks in advance.\nEDIT: As suggested, filed a bug report: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg/+bug/775060\n\nA: Ubuntu forum suggests a work around to disable screensavers and use the Power management to turn off the monitor instead.\nI confirm having the same issue. Intel GMA4500. Fresh install of 11.04 64 bits, release version.\n\nA: I found on a AMD64 Natty installation that the vanilla r8169 module is unstable and caused my machine to lock up, sometimes even to the extent to the only thing happening was a flashing CAPS lock light on the keyboard. Using the r8168 Realtek proprietary driver (which automatically uninstalls the vanilla r8169 driver) worked for me and gave me the stability I so desperately needed.\n\nA: I had this bug too, but it was related to nvidia drivers. I fixed it by installing nvidia-173 driver (I have a GeForce 7300)\n\nA: My experience is semi-related, but different in that after clean install of Natty on Acer AspireOne, mouse cursor would freezes from time to time under unity (and classic mode too)\nAt about the same time, the wifi connection would drop constantly and fails to re-establish afterward (unless I reboot ubuntu). I am new to ubuntu, so it is going to take some time to look into the cause.\n\nA: I am having the same issue nickguletskii, after reading a bug report it seems that it has been narrowed down to either a compiz or some form of driver issue though the details are a little hazy. For me, this mainly occurs when the screen is suspended via screen saver, locking screen or closing laptop lid. I wonder if preventing the screen from being suspended would provide a temporary solution to this problem or at least reduce the possibility of it occurring frequently.\n\nA: For me I'm running Kubuntu (64bit) my machine locks up only when I try to run any terminal application (Konsole Gterm) I can ssh into the PC & run ps aux & try to kill the process. The process wont die so i have to issue a reboot command. I too am running a Nvidia card with the latest propriety driver (270.41.06)\nCary\n", "Q: Classic desktop combines window title bar with panel making windows unmovable and unresizeable This problem occurs with Ubuntu Classic desktop not Ubuntu Classic (No Effects) desktop.\nThe windows bear some similarity to maximised windows under the new Unity desktop where the top border merges with the bar at the top of the screen. I can't stop this effect. Launching a new window causes it to appear at the top left of the screen with no top border so I can't move it to expose the window below.\nI have read the post of a similar problem with a netbook under 10.10 where the culprit is a program called maximus. I have tried to find it in the list of processes by ps augx | grep maximus but it is not there; neither does it appear in the list of start up programs nor the list of current processes in the system monitor. So I guess it is not maximus that is causing the problem.\n\nA: Ensure that compiz is running in your classic mode session and that your plugins (including window decoration) are correctly configured.\n", "Q: Would a Unity lens written for Unity 3D also work in Unity 2D?

However I cannot use the Ubuntu One name in a script as the resulting script when run reports 'no such file or directory', presumably due to the space in the name Ubuntu One. How can I successfully path this in a script please?\n\nA: If it is the space bugging you you need to escape it. You can use auto-complete for it.\nExample:\n$ls\nAR Tonelico   Cowon J3  Desktop  lost+found  user_guide_8455_dvb.pdf\n\n'Cowon J3' has a space in it. If I would want to cd into 'Cowon J3' I type 'cd C' and hit tab. Linux fills in the rest and you will see a \\ added in front of the space so it would look like this:\ncd Cowon\\ J3/\n\nSame goes for other special characters like the \\ itself (you use 2x \\ to escape it).\nSame principle works for starting a program with a directory or file as a parameter.\n\nA: Try: Ubuntu\\ One \nThat may help it escape the space.\n\nA: Yeah, either what wojox said, or put \"Ubuntu One\" in quotes, like that.\n", "Q: Shortcut to resize a window with my custom dimensions?

You don't need to rescan the music library with this plugin enabled, if you drag and drop a file to the window or add it to the Music source folder set up in banshee then it gets added automatically.\n\nA: I had the same problem and tried all banshee and exfalso suggestions posted so far without success. Later on I've found out that my problem was occuring for music files without write permissions (i.e., read-only files). I changed all my Banshee library file's permissions at once by running the following on Banshee's library location in bash:\nfind . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 chmod 660\n\nThis changes the permission (chmod) of all files of file type (-type f) in the current (.) directory granting read and write permission for the files's owner and group only (argument 660 of chmod). I used find -print0 associated with xargs -0 because music file names can have lots of shell unfriendly characters.\n\nA: What I did and it worked fine was to right-click on \"All Artists\" then select \"Edit Track Information\". This opens a track editor will my whole library selected. Then I added a comment to the first track then pressed the little folder-like button on the right side of the text field. Then click on save. This will add the comment to all your songs and force an update on all the songs including the copy to the right folder with the right file name.\nThe process can take a long time. And after all the files are moved you can do the same process to remove the unwanted comment. And be aware that this will erase the comments from all your songs but in my case I had none that were important nor useful.\n", "Q: How can you animate a gif that goes back-and-forth instead of repeating? I'm animating a gif with Imagemagick, I'm doing animate *.JPG, and that repeats the animation. But I would like it to go do \"pic1, pic2, pic3, pic2, pic1\" and repeat, so that it goes back and forth. How can that be done, preferably from a cli?\n\nA: You can just create a new GIF (here, animation.gif) from pic*.jpg.\nAnimating with a delay between frames of 0 and a back-and-forth that repeats for ever can be done with:\nconvert pic*.jpg -set delay 10 -reverse pic*.jpg -set delay 10 -loop 0 animation.gif\n\n(assuming your jpgs are arranged in alphanumeric order).\nobtained from here: http://www.noah.org/wiki/ImageMagick (not my site).\n\nA: How about this:\nJust correcting the code above.\n    cp pic2.jpg pic4.jpg && animate *.jpg\n\nOtherwise the 1st pic would show twice.\nI don't know if there is an easier way way to do this.\nEven on GIMP we have to add the duplicated images.\n\nA: can you try this ?\ncp pic1.jpg pic4.jpg\ncp pic2.jpg pic5.jpg\nanimate *.jpg\n\njust a guess\n\nA: You should simply do your animation and layer it in order \"pic1, pic2, pic3, pic2.\" In that order to start with. You will achieve the desired results when it repeats. In other words, you're thinking have (for example) 3 frames that go forwards and then backwards. That doesn't work. This will take up more space, but instead you must have four frames that repeat normally.\n", "Q: Missing Panel After Installing Unity 2D I upgraded my netbook from UNR 10.10 to Natty 11.04 and it was working fine till I decided to install Unity 2D.

It's exactly as OpenOffice was used to do in ubuntu 10.10\n\nA: This is normal behaviour, even if it seems a bit odd. LibreOffice/OpenOffice create separate windows for every document, and unity tracks each window as a separate window due to the way LibreOffice reports itself to the window manager. Hopefully this problem will go away in future versions of LibreOffice, but unfortunately there is nothing you can do at this point, other than maybe grouping the windows with the compiz plugin, (which may not actually group the icons on the launcher - I cannot be sure because I have not tested this as yet).\n\nA: Well I must say that this behaviour it's normal on LibreOffice 3.3.

Desktop makes searching your own email, files, music, photos, and more as easy as searching the web with Google.\n\nFrom \nWhat exactly is a \"lens\"?\n\nLenses are elements of the Unity Dash that provide a UI to search both the web and application data.\n\nIn particular, how are the privacy policies and exposure of any personal data to either Canonical or Google different? I have not used either one of these and my first step would be to find out more about what personal data is exposed.\n\nA: Regarding the privacy policy, Lenses in Unity do not send any personal information to Canonical. The dash displays your recently used files, folders and applications based on Zeitgeist which creates a database in your own home folder. In this way you have complete control over your personal files, folders and application usage.\nSome Lenses like the AskUbuntu, youtube (still in development) and Reddit lens performs a search query on this website. So it doesn't in anyway infringe security breach or any privacy issues.\nThis is the same case for Google Desktop. You can read their privacy policy here. They do not store the indexed data in their servers without your permission.\nHope this answers your question.\n", "Q: Why is scrolling in Chromium super-smooth with Openbox but not with Compiz? I have an extension for Chromium called Smooth-Scroll. While I use Openbox the scrolling is noticeably smooth with some thin ripples. Compiz is much more jerky. This is with Chromium 10; 11 hasn't dropped yet and is supposed to have accelerated layers.\n\nA: It appears that Chromium is still not using the smooth scrolling enabled by GTK3.4 yet.\nThe possibility is there, in fact, this simple Python examples shows a Webkit browser with smooth (not jump-by-a-few-lines) scrolling:\nfrom gi.repository import WebKit as webkit\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk as gtk\n\nview = webkit.WebView()\n\nsw = gtk.ScrolledWindow()\nsw.add(view)\n\nwin = gtk.Window()\nwin.add(sw)\nwin.show_all()\n\nview.open(\"http://w3.org/\")\ngtk.main()\n\nSo the technology is in place, Chromium 22 just doesn't seem to use it yet.\n\nA: It's just the way it us, hate to tell you but Ubuntu is getting heavy on resources. Just changed from 11.04/Unity on a brandnew netbook with Nvidias ION2 to Openbox & LXDE... it used to be like swimming with clothes on.

I've noticed a couple surprising blue icons in the new Unity panel.\nI think I noticed the envelope glowed blue when I had a new message, and I think the BFB glowed blue when I had a wiggling application, but I can't be sure. I even think the volume indicator glowed blue at some point, but I can't get it to do so again.\nI'm sensing there's some subtlety here that I'm missing. Is there a list/explanation? \n\nA: When an application alerts you or requires focus,a blue triangle would appear on the top-left of the Ubuntu button and an icon would also pop out and wiggle briefly.\n\nThe envelope will turn blue whenever you receive a new email or instant message.\n\nWhen the system volume is muted and audio starts playing , the sound icon would turn blue for a brief period.\n\n\nA: The blue indicates something probably needs your attention:\n\n\n*\n\n*Messaging Menu - blue is the new green. This means you have a new message/email/IM. Note that applications can mark notifications to not be as important - e.g. Gwibber's tweets (unless they're @you) will not cause the envelope to go blue.\n\n*Sound Menu - the only time I've seen this go blue. Is if your audio is muted, but there's some sort of sound notification trying to play. Not fully sure about that one.\n\n*The Ubuntu button (or bfb) - this goes blue (or gets the blue triangle) when an applications is requesting focus. This has some known bugs, for example starting GIMP always causes it to turn blue.\n\n", "Q: Can I use metacity's move_to_side keybindings from Unity?

However, it looks like some settings under metacity are used by compiz. (No point in requiring the user to maintain two sets of settings.)\nSo since I'm using compiz, I need to install compizconfig-settings-manager  \nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nand use that to set the shortcuts in Window Management > Grid.

After reboot, in system monitor there are still about 150 processes sleeping. What am I doing wrong, or maybe I do not understand something.\nIf it so, please explain me what is the need of these sleeping processes and why are not they running ?\nThank you!\n\nA: 1) Check System > Preferences > Startup Applications and make sure that applications only launch at start-up when you need them to. \n2) If you notice that the processes are named after applications you have installed, check the Options, Preferences, or Settings menu's in those applications, and look for an option to turn off \"start at log in\".\n3) Processes that are running that are not listed in the list above are usually system processes that are necessary to the normal function of your operating system. They are listed as \"sleeping\" because they are not currently active. They still need to be running though, in case they are needed. \n4) If you absolutely cannot handle the number of processes running, try backing up your files and reinstalling your operating system. I can't say I've ever had to do this with Linux (it's more of a windows thing to be honest) but if you install a lot of applications and leave them running all the time then this might be some \"spring cleaning\" for you to consider.\n", "Q: Foobar2000-like music player?

Otherwise, Foobar2000 in Wine is very light even with many addons.\nBut even in this case it looks lighter than very recommendable Ubuntu native players and it is not heavier than it used to be in Windows with the same addons installed.\nAnd what about it's version without manually added addons and naked interface ?\nIt looks extremely light! \n\nAlso, considering the looks of Foobar in Wine, a good method of improving this is:\n1. enable font smoothing - fire one after the other these lines in Terminal:\n\nwget http://files.polosatus.ru/winefontssmoothing_en.sh\nbash winefontssmoothing_en.sh\n\n(select third option in terminal)\n2. install a windows msstyle file in Wine/Configure Wine/Desktop Integration\n\n3. increase the screen resolution in Wine/Configure Wine/Graphics\n\nIt comes to smth like this (but colors and fonts are customizable):\n\n\nA: Don't forget Quod Libet (disclaimer: I'm one of the current devs)...\n\nIt's popular with a lot of ex-Foobar users possibly due to the advanced tag editing features (including multi-tag support) and also complex searching with with regular expressions, boolean algebra, numeric aggregation etc.\n\n\nA: DeadBeef is actively developed and in a way that brings it closer and closer to Foobar2000.\n(what it lacks in Foobar2000-features (numbers of addons) it compensates in being light and up-to-the-point - the most straightforward and non-bloated music player/handler I have seen until now in Ubuntu). \nWith File browser plugin:\n\nWith Infobar plugin:\n\nto install it:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:alex-p/deadbeef\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install deadbeef \n\nOr download as .deb and install (i686 or amd64)\nTo install plugins, wich are .so files, they should be put into a certain folder.\n~/.local/lib/deadbeef/\nor: /usr/local/lib/deadbeef/ \nFor the static portable version it is deadbeef-versionnumber/plugins\nConsidering problems of incompatibility and other issues in using  the plugins, see this related answer\nTo convert audio files, see this question+answer.\nConsidering memory use, Deadbeef is much lighter than other players that might be considered foobar-like.\nThe latest versions (now 0.6.2) bring it even closer to foobar by the 'Designer mode' feature (similar to the layout editing mode in foobar) by which built-in or plugin features (file browser, infobar etc) are integrated to the interface:\n\n\nFile conversion is now very close to Foobar2000's - see the link above on conversion.  \n\nAlready mentioned in answers, a great alternative is Clementine.\n\nA: Great news!

If you did, the tray requires the applications to be white-listed now.\nInstead of just denying it, it seems to just hide the program completely. Almost as if alltray was doing it's job, but being denied an icon spot in the tray.\n\nA: For me this worked:\npressing Cmd+W (or Win+W) pops up the running programs, including the minimized ones that I can't access with Alt+Tab.\n\nA: I fixed my 64-bit Ubuntu system by adding an applet for Avant Windows Navigator called Launcher/taskmanager.  Now every time I shrink a window it appears on the AWN bar.\n\nA: I found a solution...it only works in the Ubuntu Unity interface and NOT Classic...I used the first solution listed: http://www.webupd8.org/2011/04/how-to-re-enable-notification-area.html\n\nA: In Eclipse, I went to Windows --> Preferences. In the General tab I selected Always run background.

Ok, it could be easier...\n\nA: I used to have a similar problem in 12.04, with workspaces - windows would (seemingly randomly) disappear, and it would turn out that they were in a different workspace. The standard Alt+Tab combination is designed to only take windows from the currently active workspace.\nThere are a couple of ways you can see if this is the case:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up the workspace switcher, and see if the missing windows are there. From the switcher (in 12.04; I don't know whether the behaviour is the same in 11.04) you can drag any open windows into the desired workspace.\n\n*Use Ctrl+Alt+Tab instead of just Alt+Tab. This will switch between windows in all workspaces, not just the active one.\n\n\nIf you want a more permanent solution (indeed, if this is what's happening) and don't use multiple workspaces, you can disable the extras using e.g. Ubuntu Tweak (sudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak) - under Tweaks->Workspace, set the \"Horizontal workspace\" and \"Vertical workspace\" settings to 1 each.\n\nA: Just change the login screen to Ubuntu Classic, after you login there is a small icon in the left bottom (bottom panel), right click near the icon go to preferences, select  show windows from all work spaces.\nThat's it, you will be able to view the minimized windows :)\n\nA: Right click on panel - select add to panel - scroll down and chose windows list \nall file minimize - will show on panel.\n", "Q: No sound after installing Catalyst 11.4 I did a clean install of Ubuntu 11.04 and everything went fine.\nThe sound was working without a problem with the on-board device Azalia (Intel HDA) from the ASUS Crosshair IV Formula motherboard.\nThen, i installed the proprietary drivers for the AMD Radeon HD 6870 through this guide.\nNow the sound is gone.\nIf i go to Sound Preferences, on the Output options i see two devices for sound output:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Internal Audio Analog Stereo (selected)\n\n*Barts HDMI Audio [Radeon HD 6800 Series]\nIs there anything i can do?\nIf you need any more information, let me know.\nThanks!\n\nA: Fixed it by adding options snd-hda-intel model=generic to the end of /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf and rebooting.\nFrom: Fix HDA Intel (Realtek ALC887) No Sound Issue In Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat\n", "Q: How can I start a different X session on tty8?

Currently my NTFS partition (450GB) has about 130GB of free space. I tried using GParted to shrink the partition but encountered the following error. I booted into windows so I could run chkdsk but the countdown freezes at 1 upon reboot. I tried multiple methods to resolve that issue but nothing seems to work. Finally I gave up, and now I just want to know what is the best way for me to force GParted to shrink the partition regardless of the errors. I don't really have anything important and I don't mind risking the data.

Some sleep is necessary, so that wmctrl runs when Gnome top panel has already registered, so wmctrl can find it and set it to be always on top. Without this attribute checked, Gnome top panel might get under Unity top panel when you click on Unity top panel. The & symbol ensures that the rest of the command runs alongside gnome-panel, without it, the rest would run only after gnome-panel has finished running. However, the second delimiter of programs is ;, because we want wmctrl to run only after the sleep command has finished. Wrapping it all up inside sh -c makes it possible to run multiple commands in a startup script which is otherwise not permitted.\nIf you want to use a bottom panel, the wmctrl command looks like this:\nwmctrl -r 'Bottom Expanded Edge Panel' -b add,above\"\n\nIf you want to use several Gnome panels, you can write several wmctrl commands delimited by ;. If it does not work and the attribute Always On Top of your panel is not checked after a reboot, it might be because you wrote an incorrect name of the panel. To find out the name of your panel, use this command:\nwmctrl -l\n\nIt lists the names of all running windows. To find out the name of your panel, firstly run this command without the panel running and then with the panel running. The new name which has appeared is the name of your panel.\nThen, an additional step is good to do. Edit the file:\n~/.config/autostart/gnome-panel.desktop\n\nAdd there this line:\nX-GNOME-Autostart-Delay=5\n\nThe number might be lower. What this does it that it ensures that the mentioned startup script runs 5 seconds after the startup. Most probably, the desktop and theme have finished initializing until then, so the panel gets the same text color as is specified in your theme. Without this command, I had a problem with the app Character Palette - the symbols displayed at the top panel were too dark, because I set Gnome top panel's background to a dark color - the same as the color of my Unity panel - and the text of the Character Palette panel did not pick the text color of my theme.\nReboot and Gnome top panel should be displayed atop Unity top panel. However, it probably completely covers Unity top panel. To make it occupy only the center space, Hold Super + Alt and right-click on either the left or right edge of Gnome top panel. A menu should appear, click on Properties. Uncheck Expand. It should be a bit less wide now. Additionally, remove any applets which you do not want inside Gnome top panel by again holding Super + Alt and right-clicking on them and clicking on Remove from Panel. This will additionally shrink Gnome top panel until it does not cover the applets of Unity top panel. Add the applets you want in Gnome top panel by holding Super + Alt and right-clicking on the left or right edge of Gnome top panel and clicking on Add To Panel....\nAdditionally, to make it look like Gnome top panel is included in Unity top panel, make the background color of Gnome top panel the same as the color of Unity top panel. For this, I used my favorite color picker kcolorchooser which is able to provide you with the hex code of any color on your screen you pick. Run kcolorchooser, click on Pick Screen Color and click on Unity top panel. Copy the value of the field HTML: in kcolorchooser. Open the Properties of Gnome top panel, choose the tab Theme, check Background color, click on the color, under the headline Custom, click on the button + and paste the copied color to the text field.\n", "Q: ATI Radeon HD 4870: dead end I have an Radeon HD 4870 video card, and I have just update to Ubuntu 11.04. Before I was using radeon free video driver, and all hardware acceleration I used was to watch movies on my TV. My TV is permanently attached to the PC, alongside the monitor. I have configured X to have 2 screens, the main one is the monitor. The second one, the TV, is only used to play movies and such. Free driver sucks at gaming, so I missed (but not that much) being able to play some games in my old installation.\nNow that I have updated Ubuntu, free driver still sucks at games, but provided a fluid and awesome desktop performance, with all eye candy and special effects compiz is capable of. On the other hand, video playing performance is worse than before. V-sync no longer works, so there is a constant horizontal tear, and periodically video refresh freezes for half a second, making it extremely annoying to watch a movie with an interruption every few minutes.\nSo I have tried the proprietary driver. Good game performance, I was able to play Penumbra: Overtrue, Trine, Shadowgrounds, Enenemy Territory: Quake Wars, etc. All cool advanced shaders and special effects works. Including movie playback, no periodical freezes and no horizontal tear due screen refresh gives me perfect movie performance. But desktop sucks. I can not use compiz because it is slow, bumpy and fullscreen does not works. But if I do not use compiz, I can have at most one OpenGL application at a time -- and it mus be fullscreen. I can no longer watch a movie on TV while my mother uses the terminal to surf the net, because everything except the OpenGL application freezes. All worse if the OpenGL application is windowed, it won't display what it is supposed to unless it is bellow another X window, what makes the OpenGL to render over that window, a total mess.\nWhen I bought this card people said: buy Radeon because it will support free drivers. Well, radeon free drivers lacks manpower, OpenGL is incomplete and my card has always been underused. Proprietary drivers sucks. Now I want nVidia, at least they don't lie saying they will be well supported by free software.\nI am frustrated. I do not know what to do. Do you have Ubuntu 11.04 with Radeon? Does it work? Do you play? Do you use OpenGL applications? What driver do you use? For now I am using proprietary driver (fglrx), without desktop effects and refraining from using windowed OpenGL applications. Now I am happy applications are not taking advantage of hardware acceleration.\n\nA: Well, I have an HD3650, and got into similar problems. Open drivers worked slow (although they were usable), the proprietary were good at games, but desktop was useless - even moving windows was very laggy.\nThen I noticed ATI had JUST released new version of the proprietary drivers, which are said to have much better support for the latest X and Unity. However, ATI released them too late, and they failed to get into Ubuntu repositories.\nWhat I recommend you is to get the newest one from the ATI's site\nThis will, however, require manual installation. No worries though, although this is not a .deb package, installation is quite straightforward, just run the downloaded driver file, and it will install for you.\nOh, and be sure to uninstall the driver (fglrx) Ubuntu has installed to you, before you install the one from ATI site.\nIn my case this provided incredible improvement of overall performance, and my desktop is now working smooth as it have never before (and the games work perfect too)! :) I hope it will help you too!\n", "Q: How to install Gloobus Preview in Natty?

Here is screenshot\n\n\nA: I downloaded libpoppler7 from here - https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/maverick/amd64/libpoppler7/0.14.3-0ubuntu1.2, installed gloobus-preview via this ppa - https://launchpad.net/~am-monkeyd/+archive/nautilus-elementary-ppa, and didn't do any editing of files after and things worked as they should.\nEDIT: I think gloobus-preview was updated as I typed this.\n", "Q: Can I use the global application menu with AWN?

I have been using Ubuntu 10.04 since more than 6 months, mainly for development purposes (Android, LAMP).\nI got Ubuntu 11.04 last night and quite liked it.\nI was just wondering if I can directly upgrade my 10.04 to 11.04 using the CD that I have got.\nShould I go for a 10.10 upgrade first then move to 11.04?\nMy system is already 100% updated.\nI also read on some places that the Unity and the new unified bar requires some applications (such as Eclipse IDE) to be configured specifically to be used with it.\nIs it true?\n\nA: You can directly upgrade from 10.04 to 11.04 ( p.s. I upgraded from 10.04 to 11.04 yesterday) .\nYou have to Insert the cd and boot from it then click install ubuntu then you will get 3 options : remove  10.04 LTS and install 11.04 , Upgrade 10.04 LTS to 11.04, Install alongside.\nSelect the 2 one and you are good to go.\n\nA: You can, I guess, because on 10.10 it gave me the option to do so. Or you can download the alternate installation disc.\n", "Q: Navigate within folders in Unity I don't always know the name of a file I'd like to run. Often, I'll know the name of its parent folder, or its parent's parent's folder.\nThis was easy to work through in Gnome-Do. I simply search for the name of the parent folder, then navigate using the arrow keys to the file I want within that folder and hit enter to open the file.\nI can't figure out how to do this in Unity.

I'm getting out of the scope of my original question here:\nSuppose I remember his name starts with a \"j\" but I don't remember how to spell it. I type \"j\" and I quickly get a nice filtered list of all my music with \"j\".\nI can also do other things in just a few presses:\n\nA: Suggest this workaround - \nIf you click the Home Folder icon on the Launcher.\nChoose Edit Preferences - change the default view from Icon to List View.  Click OK.  This will set the default view for File Manager next time you open it.  Also make sure the \"sort folders before files\" is checked.\nClick the magnifying glass.  \nType part of the folder name in the search box displayed.  \nThis will display all matches.  \nDouble click on a folder with a matching name.\nSimilarly - you could right-click the Files & Folders lens (grey icon in the launcher) and choose either Audio or Folders.  \nYour cursor would automatically be on the search box, together with recently used Audio/Folders.  As soon as you type \"j\" for johnny cash, it will show that audio/folder name.  \nRemember - over time, the search engine will learn your search habits, so it will get better displaying the most recent audio/folders you use.\nKeep an eye on this PPA - looks like the author developing possibly something more like what you want.\n\nA: This is a limitation of Unity in 11.04. A sort of work around is to hit Alt-F2 and type ~/Music/Johnny and Unity will start to autocomplete the folder, but that doesn't work in the normal dash.\nThough ideally what you want is a Music lens that let's you just search Johnny Cash and just returns album covers (in proper order) of all the albums and hitting enter will just queue up that entire album right into your mp3 player. (Similar to the Banshee plugin for GNOME Do)\n\nA: Unity does not currently support that feature. The file lens is currently more of a shortcut holder at this point, but maybe in the future you will be able to do this (11.10 maybe).\n", "Q: Why is Unity Dash showing the Desktop under \"Downloads\"? In the Unity Dash, when I click \"Find Files\", it has two sections: \"Downloads\" and \"Favorite Folders\", but the \"Downloads\" section is showing files from the desktop instead of \"~/Downloads\", which is where Chrome downloads files by default.\nIs there any way to change what shows up there?

The problem is my net connection is very slow and I can not do a network upgrade from the \"Updates Manager\".\nSo, is there a way that I can download the Ubuntu upgrade as an bootable CD image and upgrade from it?\n\nA: Okay, so since cdromupgrade file is missing or not available, the next best thing is to create a LiveUSB and go on from there. Since you're upgrading from 13.04 the entire process should be rather flawless. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Dash and open the *Create Startup Disk * option.

I've just upgraded to Ubuntu 11.04 and I figured I'd give their new default music player a go.  I have my music in the $home/Music folder and I was using Rhythmbox.  The Banshee player has a handy item on import suggesting it can pull from Rhythmbox too.  When I do it however it comes up with errors for all bar a couple of albums I bought recently via Amazon (mp3).  \nAny idea what I'm doing wrong?  There are errors reported for all the tracks that didn't get pulled in, suggesting it read the file list correctly.  I also tried importing by directory with the same results.\nThe error reported for each track is 'Unable to import song'.\nI initially thought perhaps it was a codec issue because I'd just upgraded and presumably the codecs I'd need were no longer on the sources list.  I found those and installed them and found all the other ways of playing can deal with the music there.  \nI then connected to my daapd server and was able to play the music on Banshee from there.  This is actually the same music so I'm now guessing it's not a codec issue.\n\nA: Banshee currently uses a file extension whitelist to determine which files it can import. This is much faster because Banshee only has to look at the filename, rather than open each file and read the mime type information.  It's been generally agreed that files without an extension should probably be checked to see if they can be imported.  There's a bug report open for this issue, but unfortunately it wasn't fixed in time for Natty.\nIn your case I'd recommend writing a script to add a filename to the end of all of your files (as I understand it, it wouldn't even have to be accurate -- just something Banshee would accept, such as .mp3), or you'll need to wait until Banshee can open files without an extension.  Hopefully this will happen by Banshee's 2.2 release in September.\n\nA: Can only provide suggestions.\nIs you music English? If no, it may be tag encoding issue. I run into this every time I deal with Russian music. May be non-English characters in file path? Even UTF-8 apps can suffer from this.\nAnyway, install EasyTag or similar and try simply re-saving tags on the files. Update tags version to newest, ensure UTF-8 encoding. \n", "Q: How do I install the driver for a DLink DGE-528T? additionally if i try to install the latest driver from TP-Link i get this error

You need to install the package build-essential for making the package and checkinstall for putting it into your package manager. These can be found on the install CD or in the repositories, searching in Synaptic Package Manager or the command-line apt-get:\n\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n  checkinstall linux-headers-$(uname -a)\n\nStep 2 :\nDownload the driver from here and find the driver description like this :      \nDGE-528T B1 Driver v5.00 (for WW) -> this is the only driver that support linux 2.4 and 2.6.\nStep 2 :\nextract the zip file and find the linux folder in Driver.\nunzip DGE-528T_B1_Driver_v5.00.zip\nthen : \nIf you are running the target kernel, then you should be\nable to do :\nmake clean modules  (as root or with sudo)\n\nmake install\n\ndepmod -a\n\n\nThe media can be forced to one of the 5 modes as follows.\n    Cmd: \"insmod r1000 media=SET_MEDIA\"        \n\n\n\n    We need to key in \"insmod r1000.ko media=SET_MEDIA\" instead of \n\n    \"insmod r1000 media=SET_MEDIA\" in FEDORA 3        \n\n\n\n    For example:\n\n     \"insmod r1000 media=0x04\" will force PHY to operate in 100Mpbs Half-duplex.\n\n\n\n     SET_MEDIA can be:\n\n            _10_Half        = 0x01\n\n            _10_Full        = 0x02\n\n            _100_Half       = 0x04\n\n            _100_Full       = 0x08\n\n            _1000_Full      = 0x10\n\nForce media type for multiple cards could be performed as:\n     \"insmod r1000 media=0x04,0x10\"\n\nwhich force PHY to operate at 100Mbps half-duplex and 1000Mbps full-duplex.\n", "Q: Backlight on/off button doesn't work on an Asus EEE PC 1005HAB I've got an Asus EEE PC 1005HAB, and after upgrading to 11.04 I can no longer use Fn+F7 to turn on/off the screen backlight. The other Fn+FX keys I've tried so far all work. Is there some standard fix, or should I report this? A quick Google search didn't turn up anything.\n\nA: I used a Eee PC 1005HA to confirm this. Running dmesg I get:\n\nkeyboard: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 244\n\nThe keycode refers to XF86KbdLightOnOff, so I think this is a bug.\nWorkaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use xrandr -q to get the monitor's name, should be something like LVDS1.\n\n*Use compizconfig-settings-manager  commands plugin to set hotkeys to:\n\n\n*\n\n*xrandr --output LVDS1 --off  change LVDS1 with your monitors name.\n\n*xrandr --auto dont use output with this command, it seems to cause window glitches.\n\n\n\nA: There's an alternative to turn off the backlight of the LCD whenever you want. Just type\nxset dpms force off\n\nand press enter in a terminal, or make a desktop launcher of it and attach it in the unity panel.\nIf you're using gnome shell then there's a gnome shell extension to attach a desktop launcher to the top panel, then with a single click u can turnoff your lcd. \nIf it works you can also make a keyboard shortcut for xset dpms force off \n\nA: An upgrade from 10.10 to 11.04 removed several packages from me. One of them was smartdimmer. It's package description is:\n\nNvidia Geforce 6200Go, Geforce 8, Geforce 9, and other cards contain hardware LCD brightness control. Smartdimmer allows this to be controlled through software.\n\nTry installing it, I do not guarantee anything though.\nThe logs of the upgrade process can be found in /var/log/dist-upgrade, and the log for installed / removed packages in /var/log/dist-upgrade/history.log.\n\nA: I have made a Unity launcher to turnoff the LCD. You can also try this \nsudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends gnome-panel\ngnome-desktop-item-edit ~/Desktop/ --create-new\n\nit will open a small window\n\n\n*\n\n*in name type : turnofflcd\n\n*in command type : xset dpms force off\nI read about making a launcher here on Ubuntu Geek\n", "Q: What program currently handles the old notification area? With the removal of notification-area, what program now handles those few applications still using it?\nMy use case is the following: I have a legacy application in my start up applications that requires the notification area to be running before it can start up (otherwise I get an error about no system tray being around). Therefor I had written a little bash script that checked every few seconds whether notification-area was already in the running programs and if so, it would start up the program.\nWhat program would be the new one to check for?\nPS: I realize I could also add a sleep for x seconds and then just run the program regardless, but I see that as an ugly workaround.\nNote: This question isn't about allowing the icon to be shown, I have set that setting to all the first day I started using Unity. This is about my program starting up before the program that handles the notification area and thus failing because there is simply no systray yet.\n\nA: Unity actually is the program that runs the system tray. If you can read code, you may be able to see it for yourself here.\nSupposedly gnome-session 3 will automatically run startup in different phases so the panel & desktop would load before any applications which might fix your issue.\n\nA: I think gsettings handles it. \nTo enable the Notification Area (Systray) for all applications, run the following command:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist \"['all']\"\n\nfor gui: \nsudo apt-get install dconf-editor\n\nSource\n", "Q: How do I toggle the graphical desktop (GDM)? I am using Ubuntu 10.10 desktop, but i need to shut off graphic window (gdm) and and make it alive when a need it, how can i do that?\nThanks in advance\nRick\n\nA: To stop GDM:\nsudo stop gdm\n\nMake sure you're logged out from the graphical login or you might loose data.\nTo start it again, use:\nsudo start gdm\n\n\nA: If you only need a terminal, and not to close everything in the GUI, press Ctrl+Alt+ one of the F1 to F6 Keys. You will get a fullscreen login terminal. To switch back, press Ctrl+Alt+F7.\n\nA: if you don't want GDM to start automatically just edit \"/etc/default/grub\" and modify the line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nin\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash text\"\n\nthen type:\nsudo update-grub\n\nthen, you can start GDM at any time by typing:\nsudo service gdm start\n\nor just run the default DE by typing:\nstartx\n\n", "Q: pdf to mobi convertor Is there any application which can convert a .pdf file into a .mobi file?\n\nA: Once you have installed the calibre package, you can use the GUI, but if you want to script it, there is also a command line converter installed as part of the calibre package - ebook-convert (docs). The simplest way to call it would be:\nebook-convert document.pdf .mobi\n\nwhich will convert the pdf into MOBI format with the same name. That should \"just work\" but if you want to go deeper then see the detailed documentation on conversion.\nNote that Calibre supports lots of formats, not just MOBI, for both input and output.\n\nA: Try http://calibre-ebook.com/ I'm not sure how well it works for Linux but on Windows it is the perfect solution for managing your eBook library and obviously also converting from anything\n\nA: You can also do it online... Although it is not always recommendable to convert PDFs to Mobi since the formats are quite different.\nhttp://www.mobi-to-pdf.com/\n\nA: you can convert online pdf files to mobi / epub with the following conversion tool kit webpage:\nhttp://kitpdf.com/\n", "Q: How can I add gnome-shell to the regular Ubuntu Natty login screen along with \"Ubuntu\" \"Ubuntu Classic\", maybe as \"User defined\"?

So please think before you install from ppa.\nHowever, there are tutorials on this site on how to compile it from source, so that you can use both.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: WebDAV with Apache only working with Ubuntu client WebDAV (via SSL) is configured on a VirtualHost on my root-Server. SSL is working fine with all clients and other applications running below this virtual host are working. Unfortunately WebDAV does not. \nNautilus as Client works well, cadaver as client works only on some (php) files, not on all. An old Internet Explorer 6 is working as well, but recent clients on Mac OS X and Windows do not work.\nBoth dav-modules are enabled, files and  directories are owned by www-data:www-data and the following excerpt is part of my config (anonymized).\nNameVirtualHost 1.2.3.4:443\n<VirtualHost 1.2.3.4:443>\n    ServerName server.example.com\n\n[...]\n\n    # WebDAV\n    DavLockDB /srv/dav/lockdb\n\n[...]\n\n    Alias /serendipity \"/srv/www/webdav\"\n    <Directory \"/srv/www/webdav\">\n        DAV on\n        ForceType text/plain\n        Options +Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        AuthType Basic\n        AuthName \"Serendipity Testblog\"\n        AuthUserFile /srv/pwd/serendipity\n        Require valid-user\n    </Directory>\n\n[...]\n\n</VirtualHost>\n\nAny ideas?\n\nA: To add to this: DAV itself is working and shows directories and files, but file retrieval only results in the HTTP-parsed representation of a file. That means, PHP gets parsed and the downloaded file shows the file as if it were viewed inside a Browser.\n\nA: Add a line beneath the DAVLockDB directive, which says:\nForceType text/plain\n\nThis will tell Apache not to evaluate scripts but answer their file content instead.\nGood luck...\n", "Q: How to change console title? on windows I have command \n\ntitle new title name\n\nis it possible on Ubuntu?\n\nA: Use xtitle (not installed by default):\nxtitle new title name\n\n\nA: In 10.04 go to Edit > Profile Preferences and select the \"Title and Command\" tab and change:\nInitial title: any_title_you_like\nWhen title commands set their own titles: Keep initial title\n\n\nA: Just click Terminal > Set Title in your Terminal.\n\nA: *\n\n*Assuming that by title you mean the text shown in the Titlebar: If you use the gnome-terminal, you can goto Menu > Terminal > Title. It will ask you to set the title for the terminal. However, the name will be lost after you close the terminal. \n\n*Assuming you want to change the name@hosts:~$ bit because of a mis-spelling. Well, thats a wee lil' bit complicated. There are three parts to it, your username, your hostname, and the current directory.

How to search for files containing specific word?\n\nA: You can use grep to list the files containing word in the given directory:\ngrep -Ril word directory\n\nHere:\n* -R recursively search files in sub-directories.\n* -i ignore text case\n* -l show file names instead of file contents portions. (note: -L shows file names that do not contain the word).\nuse man grep to get all the options\n\nA: With command line you have several options. The 3 I use the most are...\n\n\n*\n\n*locate {part_of_word}\nThis assumes your locate-database is up to date but you can update this manually with: sudo updatedb\n\n*grep as explained by dr_willis.\nOne remark: -R after grep also searched within directories.\nExample: \ncd\\\ngrep -R {something_to_look_for} {where_to_look_in}\n\n\n*find . -name '*{part_of_word}*' -print\nWhere . is the directory where you are at the moment and * is a wildcard. \nOh and you can also combine these. Example: \nlocate {something}|grep {some_part_of_something}|more\nIf I recall correctly: locate is the fastest one (assuming your database is up to date) and find is the slowest one. And grep is the most complex but also the most versatile one of these since you can use regexes.\n\nA: The grep command is commonly used for this.\ngrep PATTERN filename\nand grep can do some very complex searching. \nwillis@Cow:~$ grep --help\nUsage: grep [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE]...\nSearch for PATTERN in each FILE or standard input.\nPATTERN is, by default, a basic regular expression (BRE).\nExample: grep -i 'hello world' menu.h main.c\n\n\nA: grep -R \"what\" \"where\"\nexample:\ngrep -R hello /home\n", "Q: Why can't gnome-do find my files? I use a handful of files fairly often but Gnome-do can never seem to find them. Documents/foo/Infrastructure/cheat-sheet.txt never comes up when I type \"cheat-sheet\" though it is right there if I do locate cheat-sheet and I have no trouble bringing up the directory it is in (\"Infra...\" and it is right there).\nWhat might be going on? Needless to say, this is kind of annoying. \n\nA: I'd suggest checking the config for your \"Files and Folders\" plugin. The \"Depth\" setting on your Documents folder may not be high enough to get down to that level.\n\nA: Start gnome-do from command line and see if you get any error messages.\nThere are comments on launchpad where gnome-do did not work due to a plugin going into an error. 2 examples I found: \"Could not locate Skype on D-Bus.

Changing it using gnome menu editor does not seem to have any effect.\n\nA: I suspect you can edit the file /usr/share/applications/skype.desktop Make a backup copy first. You probably need to edit the line that reads Exec=skype to include the changes you want.\n[Edit] Just tried this for myself and the syntax for .desktop files doesn't allow the = sign in the Exec command so you may need to create a shell script with your command in and point the Exec line at that.\nHere is some background about the .desktop files:\nhttp://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/ar01s06.html\n\nA: While I couldn't find the shortcuts, we can use the .local/share/applications folder.  \nYou can create a file this way:  \ngedit ~/.local/share/applications/myskype.desktop  \n\nThen paste something like this into it:  \n\n[Desktop Entry]  \nVersion=1.0\nName=My Skype\nExec=env LD_PRELOAD=\"/usr/lib32/libv4l/v4l1compat.so\" skype\nTerminal=false\nX-MultipleArgs=false\nType=Application\nIcon=skype\nCategories=GNOME;GTK;Network;\nStartupWMClass=Skype\nStartupNotify=true\nX-Ayatana-Desktop-Shortcuts=NewWindow;\n\n[NewWindow Shortcut Group]\nName=Open a New Window\nExec=env LD_PRELOAD=\"/usr/lib32/libv4l/v4l1compat.so\" skype\nTargetEnvironment=Unity  \n\nSave and exit.  \n", "Q: Is there any hope of recovering this installation? I have a laptop that gets very hot and when it overheats it shuts down abruptly. By Sod's law this happened while I was updating to 11.04 (during the install phase, somewhere in the lib* section, so probably the worst time).\nWhen I try to boot into Ubuntu now it cannot find the root filesystem, (I get the option to wait, skip mounting or enter a root terminal).  My laptop's keyboard has also decided not to work (this has happened before and it eventually came back, although I do think it's time for a new laptop) - luckily USB continues to work. I am able to boot into my Windows partition so I can assume the hard drive isn't smashed.\nMy question is how screwed is my Ubuntu install? I have quite a lot of data on the Ubuntu partition - is this lost or will I be able to access it via a live CD? How would I go about manually locating the filesystem in the root terminal? I don't mind reinstalling, but getting the data first is very important (yes, backup is quickly going to be sorted out, damned hindsight).\n\nA: Your data is safe as long as you do not format the disc and the hard disc is healthy.\nYou can use your LiveCD without touching your current install so you are always safe using the LiveCD (that is the whole concept of the LiveCD ;-) ). \nI have used the LiveCD before to save a couple of files to a USB drive (drag and drop from the desktop) and I did it with the tools we all use with normal gnome.\nYes, I can imagine you are panicking but rest assured: the LiveCD will come to your rescue. Your system will be fine! Except you do need to sort out that heating problem... it could bite you again when you (again) least expect it.\nGood luck!! \n\nA: You can backup your files booting into Windows or with a live CD. Please do it first.\nThen I think you can boot a live CD and try to update your installation from it.  \n", "Q: Selective screenshot using +Button1 is Overlayed with blue color The Screen shot plugin enabled from Compiz Config Settings Manager doesn't work properly. The screen shots of the selected areas get overshadowed with blue color..\nNot as clear of a screen shot as I would get in previous Ubuntu versions.\n\nA: This is a known bug in Compiz: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz/+bug/771875\n\nA: I'm sorry you are getting this problem, but as tshirtman points out, it is a known bug.\nWhat you should probably do is install shutter or lookit and use them for taking screenshots.\nIn both applications you can even use the same (or at least a similar) shortcut.\nP.S. I will add further instructions later. \n\nA: Alternatively you can use the Take Screenshot tool, which is installed by default. When you run this from the dash you can choose the option to capture a selected area.\n\nShortcuts are Print for the whole screen and Alt+Print for the active window.\nYou can select an area to capture directly with the command gnome-screenshot -a after pressing Alt+F2. You could create a shortcut for this (i. e. Ctrl+Print), but as I try this here it doesn't seem to work fluently - sometimes I have to press for a second or two. (Problem described here)\n\nIn Ubuntu 12.04 Precise the Screenshot section in System Settings → Keyboard → Shortcuts became enhanced. Press Shift+Print to take a screenshot of a selected area. This works without any problems.\n\nA: Unity is the reason for me. When I disable Unity Panel or when I switch to Ubuntu Classic, the screenshot by +Button1 works superb.\nThe Ubuntu Unity Plugin is a real problem that serves to make a blue overlay on screen shots. It has some kind of conflict with Screenshot feature.\nAlso I feel that Avant Window Navigator (AWN) is real good replacement for Unity. Now I can take screenshots with Inbuilt compiz feature.\n", "Q: Can 32 bit use HDMI? I want to buy a desktop, and use Ubuntu with it. My question is: Can I have a 32 bit computer with HDMI?

While my music seems to have moved along, the podcasts didn't. I have therefore two questions :\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I listen the podcasts I downloaded with Rhythmbox from Banshee ?\n\n*How can I ask Banshee to automatically download the podcasts Rhythmbox was downloading for me? \n\n\nEdited to add a clarification : I'm interested in a way to subscribe to all the podcasts I was subscribed to in Rhythmbox. I'm asking this question because I'd prefer not to subscribe to the podcasts one by one.\n\nA: I am not sure how to get the old podcasts out, but adding the podcasts and re-syncing can be done as shown below:\n\n\n\nA: This is more a workaround then an answer. You can get a list of podcast that you are subscribed in Rhythmbox with:\napt-get install xgrep\nxgrep -x '/rhythmdb/entry[@type=\"podcast-feed\"]/location/text()' ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/rhythmdb.xml | grep ^http | sort\n\nYou can get a list of podcasts you are subscribed to in Banshee with:\napt-get install sqlite3\necho \"select Url from PodcastSyndications;\" | sqlite3  -batch ~/.config/banshee-1/banshee.db | sort\n\nThis doesn't help you import them, as Banshee seems to have no way to add multiple Podcasts in one go, but at least it helps making sure that all Podcasts made it over when you manually added them.\nOne could probably write some SQL to insert the podcast list into Banshees config files, but I didn't try that.\n\nA: I looked into this but found no precise solution.\nHowever, given that there does not appear to be a way to do exactly what you desire, the following command-line script from commandlinefu.com may be the best thing available to you:\ngrep -A 5 -e podcast-feed rhythmdb.xml | grep -e \"<location>\" | sed 's: *</*[a-t]*>::g' > PodFeeds.txt\n\nThis outputs a new-line separated txt list of all the feed URLs that you are subscribed to in Rhythmbox.

Or maybe some other linux distros.\n\nA: 10.04 is probably your best bet - it's a long time support release and , as such, it is usually more stable than the latest ones.\n\nA: I answered the same question today with a 10 step how to here:\nCannot install xubuntu 11.04 because of \"signal out of range\"\nPlease report back if this works for you! \n\nA: You could also try to boot with some options like acpi=off, noalpic, vga.\n", "Q: How to run an application using sudo without a password? ... but still be required for applications that need admin privilegies?\nIn order to allow the following:\n$ apache2ctl restart\nhttpd not running, trying to start\n(13)Permission denied: make_sock: could not bind to address 0.0.0.0:80\nno listening sockets available, shutting down\nUnable to open logs\n\n$ sudo !!\nsudo apache2ctl restart             #no password asked\n$                                   #works!\n\nFor reference I've seen this setup on amazon's e3 instances\nAny idea?\n\nA: You need to edit the sudoers file. Be advised that success gives you a less secure system and failure can break sudo.\nALWAYS edit the sudoers file with sudo visudo , as visudo checks for errors and will not save the file if any are found.\nIt's a bad idea to give everything permission to run as root without a password, so to just let through the one executable you need(apache2ctl); append the following to the very bottom of the file:\nYOURNAME ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apache2ctl\n\nYou can replace the path to an executable with \"ALL\" if you choose, giving you complete passwordless sudo.\nReplace YOURNAME with your username and press Ctrl + X to save and exit. If an error occurred, it will offer to revert, edit, or save anyway.\nBe sure that you use the full path to an executable: ie. /usr/bin/apache2ctl instead of just apache2ctl. This is important because without explicitly stating the path sudo will allow any program named apachectl on the user's current path to run as root.\n\nA: You'll need to edit '/etc/sudoers' file (there is 'visudo' command for that.) to add NOPASSWD prior to list of allowed commands for Your user or group.\nIf Your user is in 'admin' group - You need following:\n%admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nCheck https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sudoers , btw.\n\nA: You COULD add the nopasswd flag to the user list but that does not eliminate all passwords asked questions. Only the first one will be asked.\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit sudoers: sudo visudo (You HAVE TO use sudo. This is an admin file.)\n\n*Add your user with the nopasswd flag after the Admin Line (at the end). \nFor example:\ncyrex ALL = NOPASSWD: ALL or cyrex ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nA: The real answer to this question can be complicated because sudo is very powerful, and can be configured to do cool things.  This is thoroughly explained in the documentation.\nThe short answer is run sudo visudo in a terminal. If this is the first time that you have run visudo, it will ask you which editor you prefer. nano is generally thought to be the easiest to use, but pick the editor you are most comfortable/familiar with. You will need to decide who you want to give access to; it could be ALL for everyone (a very bad idea), a user, or a system group. Groups are prefixed with a % sign. For example, if you wanted to give everyone in the steroid_users group root privileges without the need for a password for all commands you would add:\n%steroid_users ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nto the end of the file, exit, and save the file.  If all goes well, and you are a member of the steroid_users group, you will be able to issue sudo *some-command* without the bother of needing to enter your password.  \nKeep in mind that anyone who has access to your terminal while you are logged in -- or if you have ssh setup for key-based auth, or (even worse) have enabled password free session logins -- complete and unfettered access to your entire system.  If you have multiple users on your system, or if this is a file server, all users files could be at risk as root can do anything! \nAlso, if you make a mistake, visudo will output and error message and not save changes to the file.  This will help prevent breaking sudo completely.  You should really read the documentation. Sudo is designed to give users just enough access to do their job without the need to expose your entire system.  It may be advantageous to only give password free access for certain commands.\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: sudo visudo\n%<GROUP> ALL = NOPASSWD: apache2ctl\n\nor\nsudo visudo\n%<GROUP> ALL = NOPASSWD: /etc/init.d/apache2\n\nI guess this would do it.\nBut be careful with removing passwords for sudo.\n\nA: Now for the simple answer! No possible way to mess anything up or fudge your install up. \nJust enter your password a couple times and then you'll never have to enter it again! This will allow you to add a local admin account to the group \"root\" which is then un-commented from a template which will allow the entire group \"root\" superuser privileges. You can read my security concern/solution for this procedure at the later part of this post. \n%username& is the global variable for your username(replace it with desired username) \nStep 1: Open up a terminal window and then type \"sudo usermod -a -G root %username%\" \nStep 2: Then copy/paste this...   \nsudo sed -i 's/# auth       sufficient pam_wheel.so trust/auth       sufficient pam_wheel.so trust/g' /etc/pam.d/su`\n\nStep 2 OR type \nsudo nano /etc/pam.d/su`\n\nGoto line 19 and remove the \"#\" before # auth sufficient pam_wheel.so trust (may be a different line number for some)\n*The first command adds your %username% to the group \"root\"\nThe second/third commands allows all members of group \"root\" to be superuser without a password, versus only allowing the user \"root\" su privileges for authentications.\n\nEndnote:\nDon't mess around with /etc/sudoers... There are a lot of checks/balances that 'su' authentication must go through. Superuser authentication uses the same pam.d procedure as all other login authentications. \"/etc/security/access.conf\" has the layout for access control via tcp/ip(192.168.0.1) communication and through telnet services (tty1&tty2&tty3...etc) This allows more precise filtering per application via transport protocol. If safety is your concern, then your concern should be directed towards remote/code threats versus someone actually touching your computer when you leave the room!!! \nFood for paranoia(dont type this one in just review it):  \nsudo sed -i 's/#-:ALL EXCEPT (wheel) shutdown sync:LOCAL/-:ALL EXCEPT (wheel) shutdown sync:LOCAL/g' /etc/security/access.conf\n\n^ This blocks access to console for anyone who is not a member of system or root.

Look at the wubi guide for a link to the latest migration script. \n\nA: Possible reason\nLooks like it stopped after migrate_files ( function in that script ) and now it refuses to do it again because it checks if partition is formatted - you can see part of script that checks it here\n    if mount -t auto \"$dev\" $target 2> /dev/null; then\n    if [ $(ls -1 $target | wc -l) -gt 1 ] || \\\n    [ \"$(ls -1 $target)\" != \"lost+found\" ]; then    \n        echo \"Volume $dev is in use.

Then make new unformatted partition on same spot ( right click on unallocated, new, choose filesystem unformatted ). And run script again\npossible solution if script will stop again\nif it will stop again after copying files from /var/tmp, check what is there and you can exclude it from copying by adding --exclude /var/tmp/folder_that_dont_like_to_be_copied \nparameter to this part of script after --exclude=/sys/* \nmigrate_files(){\n    echo \"Migrating files...\"\n    rsync -av --exclude=/host --exclude=/mnt/* --exclude=/home/*/.gvfs --exclude=/media/*/* --exclude=/tmp/* --exclude=/proc/* --exclude=/sys/* / $target\n}\n\n", "Q: Resume from Suspend fails on Samsung X360 laptop I just upgraded to Natty and after the upgrade on the laptop suspend is no longer working as before.\nBefore 11.04 I closed the lid, the laptop powered down.

The edges are case sensitive.\nBottomRight, TopRight, etc.\n\nA: For a slightly more user-friendly option than cprofitt's gconf-editor solution, try compizconfig-settings-manager . It has a searchable interface, is specialized for customizing compiz, and restricts your input to valid options (to reduce mistakes).\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nInstall it and run it with ccsm from the Alt+F2 run window.\nYou can search for plugins by name. \"expo\" and \"scale\" will work for you.\n\nThe button next to each option in the Bindings tab shows the current binding. Most of them probably say Disabled.\nClick the Disabled text next to Expo Button, check Enabled, and select your button.

On a default install (ie - nothing with added or modified Gnome replacements or customizations), part of Unity (aside from the dock) includes a universal panel that runs along the top of any screen you have. That universal panel holds your window buttons (you'll see them appear when the window has focus).

Is it possible to prevent accidental mounting and/or reformatting of a disk or partition by the root user during normal operation of a system?\nFor example, this happened to me a while ago:\n\n\n*\n\n*Under normal operation I have /dev/sda1 mounted as / and /dev/sdb1 mounted as /var/disk2.\n\n*On one particular day I rewrote a thumbdrive (/dev/sdc) with different LiveCD images three or four times while trying to repair another computer.\n\n*One of those times I unmounted /dev/sdb1 instead of /dev/sdc1 and overwrote sdb1 with a new filesystem, by mistake.\n\n\nNormally you have to be root to do anything with low level filesystem access on any storage device.\nWhat I'd like is to be able to lock myself out of /dev/sda and /dev/sdb any time I'm running the live operating system from /dev/sda1 (as opposed to having booted from a LiveCD which I would never want to place any limits upon.)\nUpdate in response to loevborg (thanks): I think what I really need is complete unrestricted access to /dev/sdc (or any other device that might show up when I plug in a USB block device) as a non-root user. Is this possible -- erasing, creating a filesystem, mounting -- as non-root if I set permissions somewhere or add myself to the correct group?\n\nA: That is not possible. By definition, \"root\" is the user that is allowed to do everything. Think about it. If there was something root wasn't allowed to do, it wouldn't be at the root of the hierarchy of privileges.\nYou could probably introduce manual checks, but it would probably be no safer than just making sure you don't do anything stupid when using \"sudo\".\n\nA: Instead of doing everything as root, you can make use of file permissions. The /dev/sd* files can be seen as regular files which can be assigned file permissions.\n\n\n*\n\n*You're logged in as ubuntu, which is a member of the group ubuntu\n\n*You need to be able to write to /dev/sdc1\n\n*You need to be able to read from /dev/sdb1, but not write to it\n\n*By default, the permissions on the /dev/sd* files are set to 660 (rw-rw----), owned by root with group root\nSolution: give the group ubuntu write permissions to /dev/sdc1 and read to /dev/sdb1:\nsudo chmod 640 /dev/sdb1\nsudo chgrp ubuntu /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdb1\n\nFrom now on, you can safely overwrite your disks with an image as non-root user (ubuntu), with the system blocking you from accidentally writing to the wrong disk. Don't forget to change the permissions / group again when the disk is reinserted in the system.\nI found this behavior useful when recovering data from a disk (read-only operation) without having to worry that a command writes to it.\nAdditional information: /dev/sdc is a disk. /dev/sdc1, /dev/sdc2, ... are partitions on that disk. Permissions are not inherited, so even if you can read from /dev/sdc directly, it does not imply that you can read from /dev/sdc1. If your disks are labeled, you can avoid mistakes by verifying that /dev/sdc1 is really your USB disk by showing a list of label-devices:\nls -lA /dev/disk/by-label\n\n", "Q: After I install program with wine, I can't launch it due to missing dll's.

I connect to it with my laptop, and due to known bug, the system shuts down for ten minutes, instead for 20 seconds, when the NFS is mounted. I used to umount it in MAverick with K02umount script in /etc/rc0.d and rc6.d but after the upgrade, it does not seem to work anymore. So, I try to write an upstart job, which will do it for me i tried \n#start on stopping network\n\nstart on net-device-down IFACE!=lo  \ntask\n# I tried with start on runlevel [!2345], too\nscript\nexec /home/deckoff/Desktop/umount\nend script\n\numount is \numount /media/MyBookLive\n\nand will work OK, when executed manually\nIt seems this i sneer executed on shutdown or restart. I want to find a way to find event, that will be early enough, so the script has enough execute. I read that the problem is because the network is down before unmount, so unmount is killed by timeout.\nI look for even that will happen before the network disconnect. Manually disconnecting actually does the trick...\nCould this bug be actually responsible for my troubles?\n\nA: Since you need to communicate with the remote system, you actually are too late if you start on net-device-down.\nThe bug you mentioned, https://launchpad.net/bugs/672177 , which I fixed, has nothing to do with NFS, and is definitely not your issue.\nYou mentioned a \"known bug\" that makes your system take 10 minutes to shut down, were you referring to https://launchpad.net/bugs/211631 ?\nIf you can create and edit upstart jobs, you should be able to edit fstab. There is a specific script that is run during the shutdown just to unmount NFS filesystems at the best time. If it is taking 10 minutes thats a pretty big problem, and should be reported and escalated as a bug we should fix in Ubuntu. You can specify the 'noauto' flag and it will not be mounted at boot time, so you can still control it with 'mount' and only mount it when you want to.\nFinally, you may want to just do your unmount in a script in /etc/network/if-pre-down.d .. I have never tried this, but at least it will run before the network interface is deconfigured, so you have a chance to close the connections and sync data properly.

However two further posts below that note that it doesnt always work.\n\nA: I'm not using Unity, so I really don't know if it will work.\nYou problem could be beacause of the program launcher. I assume your .desktop file contains Exec=wine '/home/user/.wine/dosdevices/c:/Program...' and so on. Try making a bash binary wich contains something like this:\n#!/bin/bash\ncd '/home/aldomann/.wine/dosdevices/c:/Archivos de programa/Warcraft II BNE'\nwine 'Warcraft II BNE.exe'\n\nName it for instance warcraft2 and move it to /usr/bin (or any PATH variable, wich you can know by typing echo $PATH on the Terminal)\nThen in your .desktop file instead of Exec=wine '...' use Exec=warcraft2. \nI think Unity will assume this is not a wine program and will use your icon, but it is only conjecture.\nHope it works ;)\nBy default your Wine apps .desktops are placed on /home/user/.local/share/applications/wine\nInstead of modifying an existing .desktop file you can create a new one and place it on /home/user/.local/share/applications.\nIt should be something like this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Application\nComment=Comment\nExec=app-binary\nIcon=app-icon\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nStartupNotify=true\nCategories=GTK;Utility\n\nTip: If you place your icon on /home/user/.icons/ (i.e app-icon.png) you will only have to put Icon=app-icon.\n\nA: I've written a script to fix this and other problems with MSO in Unity.\nhttps://ubuntulogia.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/fix_mso_unity/\nIt works for me, but any suggestions are welcome.

After an update to 11.04 the fans of my Inspiron 9400 go in overdrive and never lower speed.  Is this normal?  It did not happen on any of the other Ubuntu releases.\n\nA: I'd suspect you have one process taking one of your two cores.  This raises the frequency to the maximum and this in turn raises the speed of the fans.\nSo you could can kick off the system monitor (you still have a good response time because the second core is not hogged up).\nThat's system => administration => system monitor => Processes tab.\nSee if one of your processes takes 50% CPU.

As a result, I look enviously at owners of a certain well-known tablet far too often.\nRelated bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtk/+bug/868510 \n\nA: According to http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/4849/, it is a pretty \"hot\" idea, and possibly on the roadmap, but it really depends on the upstream GTK developers, as in whether they will implement/accept (a) patch(es) for the feature.\nAccording to a mailing list I read, a patch was submitted (since 2003!!!) but as far as I can tell, not only was there no reply, but there was also no progress :)! I would have to look through GNOME's/GTK+'s bugzilla, but I'm not so sure if this is in progress as yet.\nHopefully though it will be implemented in the course of developing GTK+3.x, since the Linux Desktop in general is moving in this direction (tablets/touch/smooth responses etc).\nUpdate:\nThis has landed in 12.04 (GNOME/GTK 3.4), but you may only be able to use it with certain devices (afaik), such as trackpads.\n\nA: In June this year, Phoronix reported that smooth scrolling is an X.org target for version 1.12, due in early 2012.  A shame then, that Ubuntu will be moving away from x.org and onto Wayland shortly after that target (I think Wayland is being projected for late 2012, isn't it?  Might be wrong there).\n\nA: \nAccording to http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/4849/, it is a pretty \"hot\" idea, and\npossibly on the roadmap, but it really depends on the upstream GTK developers, as in\nwhether they will implement/accept (a) patch(es) for the feature.\nAccording to a mailing list I read, a patch was submitted (since 2003!!!) but as far as I\ncan tell, not only was there no reply, but there was also no progress :)!

They are setup as TwinView which may or may not be best but I would prefer to avoid running Xinerama because I fear I would no longer be able to use Unity. Long story short, no known issues with the 2 monitors that are on the same video card.\nThe 3rd monitor appears to have no window manager. I have no launch bar, no panels and when I right click -> new file gedit opens and there are no File / Edit / Tools ... options, nor is the title bar visible (with close, minimize, maximize). If I try to write anything in the text editor, it writes the text to one of the other, working, screens (Almost as if the window on the 3rd monitor never receives focus).

In CCSM/General Options/Desktop Size, there are three options: vertical virtual size, horizontal virtual size, and number of desktops.\nChanging the first two options changes the number of workspaces I can switch between.\nWhat does number of desktops do?  It doesn't seem to change anything when I move the slider.\n\nA: Official comment from the compiz wiki:\n\nHorizontal Virtual Size: The number of columns of viewports you want. For the Desktop Cube to look like a cube, this must be set to 4.\nVertical Virtual Size: The number of rows of viewports you want.\nNumber of Desktops: Each desktop contains a completely separate set of viewports, so this value \n  specifies how many complete sets of viewports you want.\nViewports and desktops are not the same concept. For technical reasons, changing the number of \"desktops\" or \"workspaces\" in environments such as GNOME, KDE, and Xfce is not the same as changing the number of viewports in Compiz. You can have multiple viewports on one desktop. \n\nIIRC Number of Desktops used to be fixed to 1 in older Ubuntu's. \nSo... number of desktops can let you can have more than 1 cube on 1 desktop where compiz uses some logic to let you scroll those cubes. \nedit: I tried to set Unity up with a cube but cube does not seem to work with Unity. On restart I lost everything except my desktop. Luckily I could start a terminal from a link I had on my desktop (everything else was gone :D) and manually start ccsm. \n", "Q: Why doesn't my Alt+F2 work?

This is a little different than the common Natty temperature applet question. I've given Unity a shot and have reverted back to Ubuntu Classic. The one thing that is still not working is the temperature panel indicator (on 2 different laptops). It reports 'No Thermal Monitor Support' and shows a big red 'X'. The temperature sensors are working as GKrellM can still report temperature properly. Does anyone have a solution?\nThe specific applet is the 'computertemp' applet. After Jorge asked for more details, I tried the other one, the 'sensors-applet', and it actually works correctly. \n\nA: Your first port of call should be the application help page\n", "Q: suspend to RAM stopped USB speakers I use a Teufel C 200 USB System on Natty, which worked fine with Mavarick and Natty so far.

I tried starting alsamixer again and it had different options now, \"speaker\" was turned down to zero.\nIt was the easiest of all possible problems after all …\nIs probably has a lot to do with this problem, this seems to be the solution for the wrong problem.\n", "Q: How do I reconfigure keyboard shortcuts for copy and paste? I've been looking all over the configuration menus and googling all over the web for how to configure keyboard shortcuts for Copy and Paste in the Unity window manager.\nIs there some hidden place somewhere to configure this?\nIn Gnome Desktop on Lucid, I had it configured so that using the Ubuntu system keyboard/mouse, I could use Win+C/Win+V to copy and paste everywhere on the Gnome desktop, including in Firefox and gnome terminal; then when I moved the mouse to my Mac desktop*, the same keystrokes would copy and paste.  I would really like to keep this consistency.\nCtrl+C is obviously inappropriate as the \"copy\" key in any sort of terminal program.  (Any Ctrl characters, actually.)\n* I am doing this by running Synergy server on Ubuntu, and the Synergy client on a Macbook. \n\nA: If you want to use the Win key for copy/paste in Firefox on Linux, you can set it in about:config as follows:\nui.key.accelKey 91\n\n\nA: Various config things needed changing to get the results I wanted:\n\n*\n\n*In Firefox, about:config\nui.key.accelKey 18\nui.key.menuAccessKey 17This makes the Alt+C,  Alt+V and Alt+W the keyboard shortcuts for Firefox rather than the corresponding Ctrl keys.\n\n*In gnome-terminal, edit->keyboard shortcuts, turn off \"Enable menu access keys\", change the copy, paste, etc., to Alt+C,  Alt+V, etc.  (This may have been the default that I changed some time in the past.)\n\n*In .synergy-conf, remove alt = super, super = alt.  Now, Alt on the Ubuntu keyboard is the Command key on the Mac.  Now, I just use Alt instead of Win; no big deal.  (The Unity window manager seems to \"own\" the Win key; it seemed the path of least resistance to just change my habit here... and the Alt key is more like the location of the Command key on the Mac.)\n\n*Disable \"New Terminal - Alt-T\" in system keyboard shortcuts so it can be used for \"New Tab\" in gnome-terminal and Firefox.\n\nThanks for the pointers... I'd forgotten about the Firefox about:config change I had made way back when, which was an essential piece to the puzzle.\n\nA: Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V by default do not copy and paste in the Terminal. This is because Ctrl+C is a special command used (for decades) to interrupt a currently running process. The default instead is Shift+Ctrl+C and Shift+Ctrl+V.\nIf you want to, you change this by clicking Edit>Keyboard Shortcuts in your Terminal.\n\nA: I also find annoying that the terminal shortcuts to copy and paste are different from what's used in the rest of the system. An alternative solution to the one you found is changing terminal shortcuts to Ctrl+c and Ctrl+v and changing the interrupt key by adding the following in ~/.bashrc:\nstty intr ^b\n\nNow to interrupt a program you've to type ctrl+b instead of ctrl+c, but you can go ahead and remap the terminal shortcuts. Once this is done, you can use consistently Ctrl+c, Ctrl+v to copy and paste text across the system.\nTo find what other control keys are already used to send terminal signals, check the output of stty -a.\n", "Q: How to set \"full graphics\" on 11.04 I could originally change the graphics to be really \"flashy\" on 10.10 but now there is no option to. The graphics driver IS working fine also. \n\nA: I take it you're referring to the Visual Effects tab in the Appearance applet in Ubuntu 10.10 and earlier versions, which had the options None, Normal, and Extra. I gather it isn't compatible with Unity, which is why it is missing.\nAn option that is still available is to install compizconfig-settings-manager, available in the Ubuntu repositories, which allows for a lot of optional special effects and tweaking, including some specific to Unity. There was a comment by Mark Shuttleworth that some of those special effects are buggy under Unity.\n", "Q: How do you stop GNOME Shell adding a second icon to the launcher even though the application is already favourited? \nPossible Duplicate:\nDuplicate icons in GNOME Shell \n\nI've been playing around with GNOME Shell for a while and every thing is smooth. So much so that my biggest gripe is to do with the way the launcher handles some of my applications. For most part, when an application is added to the launcher, i.e. added to favourites, and loaded,  there will be only one instance of it shown in the launcher, with a white light shown under its icon.\nBut that doesn't seem to be the case for every application. A few, even though pinned to the launcher, show an additional icon once loaded. Is there a solution for this?\n\nA: Well, if it is Java application you talking about - see http://locademiaz.wordpress.com/2011/08/30/turn-your-java-apps-gnome-shell-friendly/ for solution.\nBasically this is issue related to how Gnome Shell (well, Docky too) matches windows using WM_CLASS property. Mentioned above solution is based on two things:\n- binds arbitrary WM_CLASS string to the particular Java application,\n- ensures that *.desktop file (think - launcher) has the same string as filename.\n", "Q: How do you label a Launcher icon which has no icon label How do you label a Launcher icon which has no icon label\nFor example I added gtkpod but I have a black square where an icon should be. How do I add an icon?\n\nA: First you can try to reinstall it at the Software Center.\nIf it does not work, check /usr/share/applications/gtkpod.desktop it should look like this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=gtkpod iPod Manager\nGenericName=iPod Manager\nComment=Manage music and video on an Apple iPod\nExec=gtkpod\nIcon=gtkpod\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=GTK;AudioVideo;\n\nIf the file matches this one check if you have the gtkpod icon in your icon theme /usr/share/icons/ should be under apps or devices.\nAlso if you have a custom .desktop for gtkpod in ~/.local/share/applications/ you can rename the file foo-bar.old, so the original file should work properly.\nAfter you do everything above, just logout then back to restart unity.\n\nA: *\n\n*Right click desktop -> Create Launcher...\n\n*Write a name\n\n*Click browse next to the command and browse to the executable (most likely in /usr/bin).\n\n*Write comment (optional)\n\n*Click the little rocket icon to change the icon to whatever you like.\n\n*Click OK \n\n*Drag launcher to Unity bar.\n\n\nEasier than creating .desktop files in my book, and works just as well.\n", "Q: Why can't my Wifi connect or disconnect?

I have set up TwinView using the nVidia X Server Settings application. If I boot up without my secondary monitor plugged in, the desktop is stretched and out of resolution. Unity and the main panel work and look normal, but any applications I run are also stretched and the resolution is wrong, making them virtually unusable.

As rhythmbox and banshee are both integrated with sound menu, I think you could either choose one of the following. Or you could use Covergloobus which says it supports audacious but you wont have as much control as sound menu. As for alternative to panflute, I donot know of any such applications.\nOr you may just enable systray icon of audacious.

The first time a window appears there is a \"gap\" near the top of the screen, a space where you can see through to the background (or whatever window is underneath). It's really hard to explain, so here's a picture instead:\n\nAs you can see in the picture above, there's this... gap at the top of the window. (I'm using maximus to have windows always be maximized and to hide window decorations.)\nIf you switch to a different window and then back again, the gap goes away. \nIf you minimize and restore the window, the gap goes away.\nWhen the \"gap\" is there, clicking on anything in the window reveals that what you see isn't what you're clicking on. That is, the window behaves as if the gap wasn't there. The best way I can describe this is that it's almost like the window is vertically offset by the same amount as the height of the gap at the top.\nFor example: In the picture above, if I tried to click on the \"keith\" folder in the places column on the left, it would end up clicking on \"Desktop\" instead - as if the whole window is offset by a little bit. \nWhat could be causing this?\n\nA: This is a known bug.\n", "Q: STA driver support for b43xx wireless broken again Once again the STA driver doesn't work for b43xx cards in Ubuntu 11.04.

This will open a new/second terminal.\n\nA: The \"bar on the right\" is called the launcher.\nWhen you click on an icon of an application that is open on another workspace, it switches to that icon. If you want to be able create new terminal windows (remember, the launcher is not a dock), you can create a quicklist for the terminal.\nHere is an example of a Terminal quicklist: What Custom Launchers and Unity Quicklists are available?\n\nA: There is a utility called confity that can configure lots of \"hidden\" (nonobvious) settings in Unity. You can read more about it here.\nIf you install xdotool (via the usual method) it can even let you pop open new tabs from the Launcher.\n", "Q: How do I add a launcher to unity for \"gksudo \"gnome-open %u\"\"? How do I create a new launcher for Drag & Drop gksudo \"gnome-open %u\"?\n\nA: Have you tried something like this (I'm at mobile, I can't make it more specific until I get home but I think you will understand):\n1) Right click at the Desktop and choose \"Create a Launcher\".  \n\n2) Paste the name and the command you want, choose the icon you want and hit \"OK\".  \n \n3) Drag the launcher you just create to the Unity Launcher.  \n \n4) Congratulations, you have your launcher done!  \n \n", "Q: Poor Performance with Intel HD 3000 GPU I am running the 8,1 Macbook Pro. It has the integrated Intel HD 300 gpu. I've noticed the graphics performance is drastically worse in Ubuntu than in OS X. I tested this using the bullet physics library (http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress/) demos. In OS X, they all run flawlessly and smooth. In Ubuntu on the same laptop they're unusable. I can't properly interact with them because they hang so much and the framerate is so low.\nIs this a driver issue?

If so, which one should I install first after Win 7? Will there be problem with GRUB? and Is it fine to install those two linux in logical/extended partition?\n\nA: Yes it is definitely possible (I've done it before).\nWindows 7 first so it doesn't overwrite GRUB, and then Ubuntu or Debian can be installed in whatever order you please. They will both install their version of GRUB onto your master boot record, but Ubuntu's will likely be a more recent version.\nIt is fine to use logical partitions, although you might have to chainload GRUB. As long as you aren't making any other partitions, you should be fine to install them all on primary partitions though.\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes you can have n number of operating systems and boot any one using grub (it must be detectable by grub)\n\n*It does not matter which comes first. There is no Hard and Fast rule to partition the HD.\n\n*It is fine to install two linux in extended partitions. \n[I even have successfully installed Windows 7 on my last partition and Ubuntu on first, So I guess do not worry about the order]\n\n\nA: yes it's possible \nyou should install the windows 7 ,debian and in the last ubuntu . grub2 automatically detect the other os \n1 - make sure it will not go beyond the 4 primary parition if it so then your pc will not boot up\n2 - you can make extra partion by gparted tool but it will not more than 4 in case of primary partition while other extented parition is allowed\n3 - after having the sufficient space for third linux distro install it  grub2 automatically detect the other os .\n4 - if any problem occur then reinstall grub2 of ubuntu\nhere is the video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lod8sRb_6I\n5 - now you are able to use all the three os installed in your pc\nif the other distro is not show in grub2 menu then\nyou can updage ubuntu grub2 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJDcyAncmRY\n", "Q: How do I drop all elevated privileges through the terminal?

I'd like to store /var on a separate partition from /. What is the correct way to set this up?\n\nA: Configuring a new /var partition on a virtual server\nWhen I took over a new virtual server that had been provisioned by my employer’s hosting company, there wasn’t enough free space in the root filesystem. Luckily, they had used Logical Volume Manager (LVM) to sub-divide the virtual disk and there was sufficient free space available to create new volumes.  I created extra logical volumes for var and home which had been regular directories in the root filesystem. Since the virtual server provider didn’t provide a KVM-like interface by which I could access the server in single-user mode, I used a very similar method to the one outlined by Aleksander (this answer includes extra details for recovering disk space in addition to LVM-specific commands).\nCreate a new /var filesystem with LVM\nCreate a logical volume for the new var filesystem, mount it (using a temporary directory) and copy files from the current /var to the new filesystem:\n# Create a new 60GB logical volume in the `VolGroup00` group called `var`.\nsudo lvcreate -L 60GB -n var VolGroup00\n# Create an ext4 filesystem on this new `var` volume.\nsudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/VolGroup00/var\n# Mount this filesystem at a temporary mount-point.\nsudo mkdir /var.new\nsudo mount /dev/VolGroup00/var /var.new\n\nSince running processes will have files in /var kept open and in use, the directory tree can’t simply be moved to the new filesystem.  Recursively (-r) copy files from the current /var partition to the new filesystem while preserving file attributes and extended attributes (-a, --archive option). A cautious user might first create an LVM snapshot of the current volume before copying but that’s too much off-topic detail for this question.\nsudo cp -ra /var/ /var.new/\n\nAlternatively, the files can be copied with rsync, with its -a, --archive option to preserve time-stamps, ownership, modes, etc. and its -X, --xattrs option to preserve the extended attributes such as the security labels used by AppArmor and SELinux:\nsudo rsync -raX /var/ /var.new/\n\nUpdate the filesystem table\nConfigure the new filesystem to be used as a new mount-point for /var by adding the following line to /etc/fstab.  Note that 0 is used as the pass number (last field) so that the filesystem won’t be automatically checked (fsck) after a certain number of reboots.\n/dev/mapper/VolGroup00-var    /var    ext4  defaults  0 0\n\nSince changing into single-user mode is not possible, reboot the computer to use this new volume as /var.\nRemove temporary mount-point\nAfter the machine has restarted, the new filesystem will be mounted on /var so the temporary mount-point can be safely removed:\nsudo rmdir /var.new\n\nRecover disk space from the root filesystem\nThe old /var files will still be taking up space on the root partition but they are not easily accessible while another filesystem is mounted at /var (they are “masked” by the new filesystem using the /var directory as its mount-point). Use a temporary mount-point to mount the root filesystem so that contents of the original /var directory are available by an alternative path.\n    sudo mkdir /old-root\n    sudo mount /dev/mapper/VolGroup00-root /old-root/\n    sudo rm -rf /old-root/var/*\n    sudo umount /old-root/\n    sudo rmdir /old-root/\n\n\nA: First prepare a new partition (e.g. with parted and mkfs).\nSay the partition is /dev/sda5\nMount the new partition:\nmkdir /var2\nmount /dev/sda5 /var2\n\nSync your current var:\nrsync -a /var/ /var2\n\nAdd the entry to /etc/fstab\n/dev/sda5    /var    ext4    defaults      2 2\n\nReboot.\nIf you happen to need to go back you your old /var just comment out the entry in fstab.\n", "Q: Nautilus automount - controlling GID/UID/mode bits How do I set GID/UID and mode bits assigned to the directory in /media, to which my USB drive is auto-mounted when I plug it in (i.e. to the directory, which represents the drive itself, e.g. /media/MyUSBDriveLabel)?\nI'm trying to make an auto-mounted drive accessible by several users, belonging to the same group.

When I installed Natty from scratch, I decided to install it in my native language instead of English. It detected that I had folders like Pictures etc in my home folder, and prompted me if I wanted to use the Norwegian equivalent instead. However, it didn't rename the existing folders, it merely created new ones and ignored all my data.\nI know I can move the data myself, but I would rather continue to use the old directories so I don't have to update my backups etc. How do I change them back?\n\nA: Ubuntu Tweak has a simple interface for accomplishing this. You can download it here. \n", "Q: Remove recommended packages By mistake I forgot to add --no-install-recommends flag to my apt-get install command, is there a way to purge those recommended packages after they've been installed?\n\nA: In addition to enzotibs answer, if you wish to avoid adding --no-install-recommends each time, you can also disable automatic installation of recommended package by setting the APT::Install-Recommends setting to 0:\numask 0022;echo 'APT::Install-Recommends \"0\";' | \\\n    sudo tee /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/00DisableInstallRecommends\n\nThe umask 0022 causes the file to be created with permissions 644, restrictive permissions breaks operations like apt-get -s ...

Or will it be more trouble than it's worth and be better just to do manually?\nI'm running 64 bit on my desktop and will probably run the 32 bit netbook remix on the laptop if that will further complicate things.\n\nA: You can use Oneconf which uses Ubuntu One to sync your installed applications. Once installed (the package name is oneconf), it is used from Sowtware center's File menu.\n\nA: To sync settings just sync all those invisible folders in you /home/username directory. You may use rsync or Ubuntu One. \nSyncing packages is a bit tricky, because if you just take a list of packages and install all of them, you will loose info on which are manual and whick are automatic. If this is not a problem, do sudo dpkg --get-selections | grep '[[:space:]]install$='| awk '{print $1}' > installedpackages to get a list and cat installedpackages | xargs sudo apt-get --ignore-missing install to install packages from the list.\n\nA: If you were on the same architecture (64-bit) It would be easy. If your laptop Is fairly modern, It will probably run 64-bit.\nTo copy your applications (that have been recently installed), press alt-F2 on the desktop and type in \n  gksu nautilus\n\nNow browse to the file system (/) and copy everything in the /var/cache/apt/archives folder to a thumb drive.\nNow take that to the notebook (Only if it is the same architecture) Open synaptic PM (on the administration menu) and when it is done, Close the dialog, then go File -> Add downloaded packages. browse to your thumb drive and select the folder containing the cache. Once Synaptic has finished looking at the files, Click apply on the top menu. That will install all of the same applications as the desktop. As for installing them as you get them on your desktop, I believe there is a mod for software center that syncs the package list like Ubuntu One, and allows the other to mirror it. But right now I can't find it.\n", "Q: Is Gnash installed by default in 11.04?

Do I have to do something to enable it back or I have to live with this :( \n\nA: With ConpizConfig Settings Manager, turn on Shift Switcher. Its Next Window and Previous Window commands - <Super>Tab and <Shift><Super>Tab - are what do it. I had it enabled in 10.10 and it (along with a few others) was disabled after upgrading to 11.04.\n\nA: This happens because at Natty Mod4/Super is a shortcut to Unity panel.

Is there any way to disable icons from Gnome menu?\n\n\nA: From Here http://www.marksanborn.net/linux/speed-up-the-gnome-menu-and-fix-the-annoying-icon-delay/\nNote: This is for Feisty (7.04)\n\nThe first problem with the Gnome menu is that it loads the menu icons as needed causing a delay before you can see the icons. By default when you click the Gnome menu the icons are retrieved and loaded after the click (this is why there is a delay) and put in memory so they can be called later. Once the icons are in memory there will be no delay the next time you go to the same menu item. However, I think this is a bug since you should never see a delay in a menu system even if it is the first time you click on it. You can fix this problem by typing the following command as root.\ngtk-update-icon-cache -f /usr/share/icons/THEMENAME/\n\nRemember to replace the THEMENAME with the actual icon theme set you are using. The default is ‘gnome‘.\n\n\nA: Years ago we had a switch to do that with but that has been long gone.\nYou can do this with from the 'propeties' button in 'main menu' in system settings.\n\n\nIf you can not remove the image here you could delete the menu item you need to remove the image from and recreate it. \nOr find the *.menu associated and edit that file. \n", "Q: If I rename my computer, will it lead to problems with Ubuntu One? If I rename my computer by editing the /etc/hostname file as shown here, will I get some synchronization problems with Ubuntu One, which knows my machine as a different name ?\nCan I have any other problem I don't think of yet ?\n\nA: No, the only problem will be that it will be still listed with the old name. If that inconsistency bothers you you can delete the token and re-sign in to the service.\n\nA: Be carefull when changing the hostname, From the IRC #ubuntu channel factoid i quote:\nUse hostname  to set the hostname, \n or to do it permanently: edit /etc/hosts to include BOTH the old\n and new hostname and then change /etc/hostname to the new one. \nWARNING!

I'm trying to enable the user list for lxdm (which is Lubuntu's default login manager). The file /etc/xdg/lubuntu/lxdm/lxdm.conf includes the code shown below but how to configure it? Are white and black for white/blacklisting? Why doesn't disable=0 show the userlist? \n[userlist]\ndisable=0\nwhite=\nblack=\n\n\nA: As of Ubuntu 12.04, the disable=0 in /etc/lxdm/lxdm.conf is working. \nThe whitelist setting does not seem to work, but the blacklist one does, and the syntax seems to be user names separated by spaces.  LXDM appears to include in the user list the first three users it finds whose home directory (as specified in /etc/passwd) are under /home, which is why you will see users like syslog and usbmux listed.  \nThis also means that if you put a user's home directory in a non-standard location (other than /home) then the user name won't be listed.  I worked around that by putting in a softlink from /home/[username] to the real location, so I could leave /home/[username] in /etc/passwd and get lxdm to show it in the list.\n\nA: I found that this is actually supported in lxdm's config file but not in its default theme.

The procedure is the following:\n\n*\n\n*Unpack the DraftSight file in some directory (ex: DS).\n\n\n*Copy the contents of DS/opt/ and DS/var/ to /opt and /var/opt.\n\n\n*Go to DS/DEBIAN.\n\n\n*Run:\nsudo ./preinst\nsudo ./postinst\n\n\n\n*A menu should have been created in the graphical Ubuntu menu: you can launch it.\nIt is also mentioned that a problem with the screen may arise, but it didn't occur to my case. To avoid this, if you encounter this problem, run the following commands:\nsudo apt-get install libdirectfb-extra\nsudo apt-get install libxcb-render-util0\n\n\nA: Installing on Ubuntu 11.10 64 bit can by skipping the dpkg-installer:\nhttp://linuxaideddesign.blogspot.com/2011/10/draftsight-and-ubuntu-1110-64bit.html\n\nA: I found that it is possibly to run this software by running it as a root (sudo) but still not functional trough normal launcher.\nUbuntu 11.04\nstart command is:\nsudo /opt/dassault-systemes/draftsight/bin/DraftSight\n\nor you don't have even to do that\njust extract .deb file and run it as a root and it will work.\nThere is only a problem to run it as normal user\n\nA: I have succeeded in to install draftSight in Ubuntu 12.04 (beta2) 64 bit.\nI just have installed the required libraries and then extracted the .deb file content.\nI copied the extracted folder to /usr/local/ and then just change the owner:\nsudo chown -R  user:group draftSight/\n\nAfter that i just have created a launcher in the desktop..\nCheers....\n\nA: I have tried forcing the architecture to install DraftSight, even after installing the packages mentioned in the previous posts, but I always get this error:\ndpkg: warning: overriding problem because --force enabled:\n package architecture (i386) does not match system (amd64)\ndpkg: regarding DraftSight.deb containing dassault-systemes-draftsight:i386, pre-dependency problem:\n dassault-systemes-draftsight:i386 pre-depends on libexpat1 (>= 2.0.1-4)\n  libexpat1:i386 is unpacked, but has never been configured.\ndpkg: error processing DraftSight.deb (--install):\n pre-dependency problem - not installing dassault-systemes-draftsight:i386\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n DraftSight.deb\n\nI have tried installing this libexpat library through getlibs but nothing seems to let DraftSight install correctly.\nConsequently, I tried the method copying the files manually (suggested by Juan José Alca Machaca), and DraftSight appears in the menu and I can run it, but it crashes when I do common operations, or run commands like DimensionStyle\n\nA: I had the same problem but solved finally. Here is the solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the two missing dependencies: \nsudo apt-get install libxcb-render-util0\nsudo apt-get install libdirectfb-extra\n\n\n*Move your DraftSight.deb file to your home folder /home/yourusernamehere. \n\n*Then you have to force install the DraftSight package: \nsudo dpkg -i --force-architecture DraftSight.deb\n\nIt is working for me.\n\nA: Above solutions does not worked in fresh install of natty narwhale 11.04 64 bit.\nSystem crashed after attempts: dpkg with force & make deb file for all architectures & trying alien rpm to deb & (re)installation and configuration libraries for i386 (supposed it destroyed system).\n I rescue system with reinstallation and configuration libraries for amd64 & update and upgrade system. Ubuntu 11.04 Natty and DraftSight works.\nYou can try install libc6 for i386 (simultaneously to already installed libc6 for amd64) from synaptic. I guess it helps in my case.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 11.10 64 bit there is still a dependency problem:\ndassault-systemes-draftsight:i386 wymaga wstępnie libdirectfb-extra (>= 1.2.7-2)\n\nBUT it works if you\nextract DraftSight.deb and then run:\n./DraftSight/opt/dassault-systemes/draftsight/bin/DraftSight\n\n\nA: Don't forget to right click 'DraftSight.deb' then choose 'Properties'.

Whenever I tried to disconnect from the VPN (in my case it was PPTP) server, KDE Network Manager takes 100% CPU. I used to kill KDE4 from \"System Monitor\". But even getting there takes a lot of time because the whole system behaves slow to any activity.\nFound quite a few bugs reported for this issue. The one I mention here will give us more details about the issue : https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=268038\nTo solve the issue, about a few days back I had to check on the \"pre-release updates\" from software souces-->origin under Kpackagekit. Several updates were installed and the issue got fixed. \nFrom the above ticket it seems the updates are already there in Kubuntu updates and you probably don't need to install those pre-release updates. Just check whether there is any update available for you or not. \nIn case there is no available update from the regular channel, then you might want to try the above process as tried by me.

I have a Dell Mini 9 with a 8 GB SSD. I installed Lucid some years ago, and upgraded each time, and now my hard disk is almost full. I see that new default programs get installed but old ones do not get automatically removed (e.g. Banshee and Rhythmbox). Now I can install a new distro from scratch but if there is a way to avoid the hassle, it would be great. I don't mind if the programs I have installed over the years get removed, they are only a few and I can reinstall them in a snap.\n\nA: The solution to this question will probably solve your problem too.\nUbuntu pre-12.04\nFrom a gnome-terminal do:\ncat filesystem.manifest-desktop | awk '{print $1}' | sort > default.txt\n\nThis will get rid of the package versions and leave you with a sorted list default.txt containing all packages that are installed by default. As mentioned in the linked question, keep in mind that you might changed the default installation when installing updates and/or restricted packages during the installation of Ubuntu.\nUbuntu 12.04\nThe above step has changed a bit. To get a list of the packages that are initially installed, you need to unpack two files:\n\n*\n\n*filesystem.manifest\n\n*filesystem.manifest-remove\nTo get what you want, you need to remove the latter from the former:\ncomm -3 <(cat filesystem.manifest | awk '{print $1}' | sort) <(cat filesystem.manifest-remove | sort) > default.txt\n\nNow continue like pre-12.04:\ndpkg --get-selections | awk '{print $1}' | sort > current.txt\n\nThis will get you a sorted list current.txt of all currently installed packages.\ndiff -u default.txt current.txt | grep \"^+[^+]\" | cut -c 2- > installed.txt\ndiff -u default.txt current.txt | grep \"^-[^-]\" | cut -c 2- > uninstalled.txt\n\nThis will get you the differences between the two package lists, where installed.txt contains all packages not part of the default installation, and uninstalled.txt contains all packages you are missing compared to a default installation.\n\nA: If you insist on removing those packages manually you can fire up Ubuntu Software Center or even good old but slighly more risky Synaptic, browse the 'installed' section and start removing whatever you think you do not need. That can include all the old programs but even programs that are in your current install but you never will use. \nI bet it will be an odd 10 or so you want to remove and that might take you a 15 minutes,\n", "Q: Add unity quicklist launcher with a zenity command I try to add a quicklist launcher for gedit that allowed me to open a new doc in gedit directly from unity dash\nso I tried to add this command to my OpenDoc Shortcut Group\n[OpenDoc Shortcut Group]\nName=Open file...\nExec=gedit $(zenity --file-selection)\nTargetEnvironment=unity\n\nBut nothing happens when I click on the quicklist launcher...\nMaybe someone know who to do it ?\nBest Regards\n\nA: Ok, so finaly I find a great solution for this case.\nAs I said before in a comments, the better solution is to use a script called with the Ayatana shortcut. This is an exemple of Quicklist launcher for gedit. With it you can open a file in gedit or open a file as root in gedit\nThe part I add in the gedit.desktop file :\nX-Ayatana-Desktop-Shortcuts=OpenDoc;OpenDocRoot;\n\n[OpenDoc Shortcut Group]\nName=Open file...\nExec=/path/to/the/script normal-mode\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n[OpenDocRoot Shortcut Group]\nName=Open file as root...\nExec=/path/to/the/script root-mode\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\nUsing a script fine is more easier for testing what we want and do some complex things with the quicklist shortcut.\nNow this is the code for the script /path/to/the/script (personally I create a script folder in ~/.local/applications/ folder and create the script geditshortcut in it)\n#!/bash/bin\n\ncase $1 in\nnormal-mode) gedit $(zenity --title='Open file...' --file-selection);;\nroot-mode) gksudo -u root -m \"Running Gedit as user root allow you to modify some essential files of your system\" \"bash -c 'gedit \\$(zenity --title=\\'Open file as user root...\\' --file-selection)'\";;\nesac\n\nNow Drag & Drop the gedit.desktop file to the launcher bar or Unity and enjoy it ;)\nThat's all folks !!\n\nA: Based on your solution in the comments, you could write a more generic script:\n#!/bin/bash\n$1 $($2)\n\nIt would call the first argument with the output of the other, so you could Exec=path/to/my/script gedit \"zenity --file-selection\" Still a workaround, but easier to reuse in other cases.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.04 Is not Supporting My HP Pavilion Computer I have upgraded my Ubuntu 10.10 to 11.04 twice,But after Installing it's giving a message \"You system doesn't support 2D unity Login under Ubuntu Classic Desktop\" After logging in Ubuntu Classic desktop for booting OS it's taking about 5 mins to boot-up, and even after booting it's not working properly it's just when i press on any menu it's get flickering effect so it means my system doesn't support Ubuntu 11.04 \nMy system Configuration \nHP-Pavilion \nP-4 \n2GB RAM \n250GB H/D\nIntel Extreme Graphics Card\n\nA: You need to install your video card driver, after that Ubuntu shall show Unit interface.\n", "Q: How do I file feature request bugs on Launchpad? I've seen on Bugzilla bug request for enhancements, is there anything similar for Launchpad?\n\nA: You can file a bug for small issues but a member of the QA team will have to set the importance to 'wishlist'. \nFor bigger features, if you have the expertise and time to write a blueprint then you should enter it on https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ You should make sure that you can fill it out in enough detail for a developer to start work, and also the perseverance to bring it to the attention of someone to do the work if you can't do it yourself.\n\nA: http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/ is meant for feature requests.\nclosed as of today\n\nA: You can file a bug, but it's worth pausing before you do file to consider whether filing is going to help improve Ubuntu.  The goal is to get a great operating system, not to build a kind of encyclopedia of every idea that could possibly be implemented.  \nSo, an improvement is only actually useful if it is implemented and shipped.  There are basically two paths towards that: implement it yourself (or with a friend), or persuade the existing developers to implement it.\nImplementing it yourself is a much more sure way to get something done - anywhere in life, but especially in free software.  If it's a very large feature and you've never touched the code before it may be hard.  A good general way to start is to at least get your toe in the water by fixing some easy bugs in the project and then talk to the developers about the thing you really want to build.\nIf you want other people to implement your idea, you need to work whether this is really more important than other things they might be doing now, and how to convince them to do it.  Generally speaking just a bug suggesting an idea is not very persuasive: projects already have a lot of bugs, and they also have a lot of ideas about what to do next.  It depends a bit on what the particular feature is.  One thing you can do is make a blog post with mockups showing how it could work.\nSo, in short, if you want a particular feature, in any free software project:\n\n\n*\n\n*write it yourself, or\n\n*at least show a lot of willingness to write it if someone will help you get started, or\n\n*put up a blog post that's really persuasive about how incredibly cool and exciting the feature will be\n\n\nA: You can use launchpad for that.\nHere are a few samples of feature request: feature requests on launchpad\n", "Q: Does 64bit Chromium include the Flash plugin I tried to find this in Chromium's website but the don't mention it. I know that that Chromium 32bit comes with the Flash plugin included, but does the 64bit version include it too?\n\nA: No. Chromium doesn't include Flash, at least the upstream version doesn't. Chrome, the closed source version, does include flash, and this is the source for the confusion. You can check the main differences between Chrome and Chromium in this page.\nChromium supports NPAPI plugins, and it will use the system wide flash install if it's present, like Firefox does. So flash will work in Chromium if you have it already installed.\nThis applies to both 32 and 64 bit versions.\n", "Q: Can I \"speak IMAP\" and review my actual mail quota? I'm trying to troubleshoot a frustrating inbox quota issue. Thunderbird says my inbox is 80% full. My ISP says it isn't. We made some tweaks and I should have 2G available (it had been \"unlimited\"). Thunderbird, unfortunately, still reports that I'm using 206456 of my 256000 KB limit on Quota Root \"ROOT.\"\nIs there a command line method I can use to find out what my mail host is telling Thunderbird? Can Mutt tell me? \n\nA: Perhaps the Python imaplib library could help.  Launch a python console from the terminal with python. Then, create an IMAP connection with the following commands:\n>>> import imaplib\n>>> conn = imaplib.IMAP4('hostname')\n>>> conn.login('username', 'password')\n\nIf your IMAP server uses SSL, use the IMAP4_SSL constructor instead of IMAP4.  You can then use the getquotaroot or getquota methods on the connection.  For example:\n>>> conn.getquotaroot('INBOX')\n>>> conn.getquota('quota root') # using the root from the previous command\n\n\nA: Using openssl :\nopenssl s_client -connect example.org:imap -starttls imap\n\nthen log in when you get a prompt :\na LOGIN user@example.org password\n\nand finally :\na GETQUOTA \"\"\n\n", "Q: How can I  import my Gnome Sticky Note Applet notes into Tomboy? After moving to Unity, I found that I lacked access to my sticky notes I had created in Gnome using the Sticky Notes Applet.\nTomboy is the default option for sticky notes in Unity, and so moving the content into Tomboy was required. The best way I found to do this is to:\ncat ~/.gnome2/stickynotes_applet\n\nand manually port the content of the notes into new Tomboy notes.\nIs there a better way to do this?\n\nA: This should be done automatically. If you take a look at Preferences->Add-Ins there is the Sticky Notes Importer under Tools. This should be active.\n", "Q: How do I safely install an older/newer version of Python? When I eventually upgrade to 11.04 I will need to install Python 2.6 for development purposes. The 11.04 default is 2.7. Can I just install the python2.6 package alongside the default python package? I don't want anything else to depend on it, I need it for only one purpose. I will be using Distribute and virtualenv to install any further dependencies for Python 2.6.\n\nA: Run synaptic(through the application lens in unity or System -> Administration if you are using classic desktop )\nsearch for python 2.6 in the filter at the top and mark it for installation by right clicking it, and selecting \"Mark for Installation\".\nIt should run alongside 2.7 fine as far as I'm aware, now when you need to use 2.6 invoke it directly, i.e with the command \"python2.6 \"\nThis should work, let me know if it doesn't though. :)\n\nA: VirtualEnv is the definitely best way to have multiple python versions, even it it is the same interpreter but with different installed libraries. In each virtual environment you will run the selected python version. Every thing will be transparent. \nBTW: you can find a repository with very old python version here: https://launchpad.net/~fkrull/+archive/deadsnakes/+packages\nMaybe it will be useful for someone.\n\nA: Yes, you can without any problems. \nYou can even do system wide installs using easy_install. Just instead of invoking it directly, invoke it via python2.6 easy_install.\n\nA: You can use pyenv to do this too. I rather simple and also it allows you to switch versions and control your python enviroment. To install and use:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the dependencies of python, to prevent weird messages:\nsudo apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev git\n\n\n*Install pyenv. Sadly this application doesn't have package that you could just apt-get away, but still it's easy to install:\nmkdir $HOME/.pyenv\ncd $HOME\ngit clone git://github.com/yyuu/pyenv.git .pyenv\n\nthe following is bash exclusive. If you use another shell you must modify the .bashrc entries.\necho 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.bashrc\necho 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc\necho 'eval \"$(pyenv init -)\"' >> ~/.bashrc\n\n\n*Restart the shell:\nexec $SHELL\n\n\n*Check that the installation is ok:\n➜  ~  pyenv --version\npyenv 0.4.0-20140110.1-14-g46a01b1\n\n\n*Install python versions away:\n➜  ~  pyenv install 2.7.6                                    \nDownloading Python-2.7.6.tgz...\n-> http://yyuu.github.io/pythons/1d8728eb0dfcac72a0fd99c17ec7f386\nInstalling Python-2.7.6...\n\nInstalled Python-2.7.6 to /home/braiam/.pyenv/versions/2.7.6\n\nDownloading setuptools-2.1.tar.gz...\n-> https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/setuptools/setuptools-2.1.tar.gz\nInstalling setuptools-2.1...\nInstalled setuptools-2.1 to /home/braiam/.pyenv/versions/2.7.6\n\nDownloading pip-1.5.tar.gz...\n-> https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pip/pip-1.5.tar.gz\nInstalling pip-1.5...\nInstalled pip-1.5 to /home/braiam/.pyenv/versions/2.7.6\n\n\n*Done.

It's the standard IP for the localhost.\nInstead, the hostname of your machine resolves to 127.0.1.1.\nIt should be no problem to change it to anything in the range 127.0.0.0/8 which is reserved for loopbacks. \nAs long as nothing listens exclusively on 127.0.1.1 you should be safe.\nTo find if there's something listening on 127.0.1.1:\nsudo netstat -tunelp | grep 127.0.1.1\n\n", "Q: Getting set up with git-buildpackage, pbuilder, etc, for software packaging I'm packaging software at work and the scope has increased to have Lucid-based as well as Karmic-based versions. Right now I just build inside a Karmic VM using git-buildpackage calling debuild, but I've looked into pbuilder so I can do it more easily with chroots, since having one VM for Karmic and another for Lucid seems a little out of place. I've looked around for documentation but it's been very cryptic to me so far. The packages already have git repos set up, it's mostly just the use of pbuilder that's got me stuck.\nHow can I get this set up easily, preferably to the point where I can script it for other developers here?\n\nA: You might want to look as the pbuilder-dist script in the ubuntu-dev-tools \npackage. It greatly helps with managing multiple pbuilders for different target environments. As an example, to create a Karmic pbuilder run:\npbuilder-dist karmic create\n\nYou can use your newly created Karmic pbuilder with:\npbuilder-dist karmic build /path/to/package.dsc\n\nThe package.dsc can is generated when you build the source package with git-buildpackage -S\nThere is also a git-pbuilder wrapper around pbuilder for git-buildpackage I have no experience with it. My understanding is that, DIST=karmic git-pbuilder create should create you initial Karmic pbuilder. You should then be able to build the package in that pbuilder with:\ngit-buildpackage --git-dist=karmic --git-pbuilder\n\nSee man git-pbuilder and man git-buildpackage for more info.\n\nA: I wasn't able to configure changeroots that worked for this, so I've been using a lucid vm alongside my karmic vm, building on either as needed.\n", "Q: Restoring Unity after installing Gnome3 For going back from gnome3 to stock 11.04 are these commands enough ?

I want to install Ubuntu 11.04 instead but I'd like to know if the touchpad, the wireless card and everything else works fine.\nThank you\n\nA: Yes and no.  The CQ56 uses the brand new (Read:Six months old) RA5390 chipset from Ralink for the wireless adapter.   I'm working on a .deb package for the RA5390 kernel module from the source code I got from Ralink, but in the meantime you will have to download and compile it manually and enable it with modprobe.\nAside from that, all of the rest of the hardware works flawlessly with the exception of the trackpad's power switch.  I can't figure out how to enable it, but that's okay because it's nothing to just disable the trackpad completely when I have a mouse plugged in.  I'd prefer just double-tapping the little off switch, but you can't win 'em all.\nSince it will have SuSe pre-installed, though, you might consider using it to compile all of the kernel modules you're going to need there first before installing ubuntu.\n\nA: I bought it and no, there aren't any.\n", "Q: Unity doesn't handle Compiz Window Previews.

This seems to be the default for newer versions of Ubuntu. To do this, change this line:\nxterm-color) color_prompt=yes;;\n\nto:\nxterm-color|*-256color) color_prompt=yes;;\n\nThen run source .bashrc and your terminal will display in color.\n\nA: The colors have stopped working, most probably after you upgraded to Lion from Snow Leopard.\nIn Lion, for some reason, by default the terminal is declared as \"xterm-256color\" instead of \"xterm-color\" which is what Ubuntu understands.\nOne of the options is for you, as mentioned by previous responders, uncomment force_color_prompt=yes in ~/.bashrc\nThe other option is to redeclare in Terminal.app the terminal as xterm-color. Here's how to do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Terminal.app\n\n*Go to menu Terminal -> Preferences (or use Cmd + ,)\n\n*Go to the Settings tab and find the theme that is set as default\n\n*Go to the Advanced tab\n\n*Find the drop down next to Declare terminal as: and set it to xterm-color\nHere are my Settings\nUPDATE: It seems that Mountain Lion removed the xterm-color option completely from the drop down menu. If you're doing an upgrade you will most probably keep your old configuration, but if you are doing a fresh install, you'll have to manually edit Terminal's configuration file and for that you will need a plist editor (included in XCode that need to be installed via the App Store). The location of Terminal's file is in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist in order to add the xterm-color option do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Terminal.app if it's currently running\n\n*Install XCode from the App Store (skip this step if you have installed it already)\n\n*$ open ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist\n\n*Navigate the plist to Root > Window Settings\n\n*locate the name of your default theme (in my case that’s Pro) expand it and find the TerminalType key. \n\n*Now just change the TerminalType key to xterm-color manually\n\n*save the file and launch Terminal.\n\n\nA: One alternative you have is to crate a .bash_login file if one doesn't already exist in your home directory, and put .bashrc inside. \nClose the terminal and reopen it--your problem should be solved!\n\nA: I had the same issue, which I assume is because I tried to delete the default /home/pi user and create a new one (for security reasons), but I am not sure that I did it correctly. I ended up trying 2 things and now it works, although I am unsure which step fixed it. Here's what I did:\nFirst I copied the .bashrc file to both my new user dir AND the pi user dir that I recreated.\nSecondly, I did what some of the other people suggested above and tried . ~/.bashrc OR the longer version: source ~/.bashrc\nEither way, I hope you can figure it out! This is my first Pi and I have just started learning Linux, and let me tell you how relieving it is to finally have color restored to the terminal!\nGodspeed friend!\n\nA: According to This tutorial found on the internet.\nYou can remove comment in #force_color_prompt=yes replacing it with force_color_prompt=yes.\n", "Q: Is there a timer indicator? \nPossible Duplicate:\nA simple timer app, similar to timer-applet \n\nOn 10.10 I've used timer-applet and was pretty happy with it.

I've seen this behavior in MacOS's Activity Monitor as well.\nAn example: Playing Minecraft with OpenJDK. I frequently see over 100 CPU when the game's abusing the system. My girlfriend's MacOS has reported over 100 percent as well on her own programs (not just minecraft).\n\nA: There are 2 ways to show the CPU usage. In the preference dialog you can choose to between these modes.\nThe default is IRIX mode which can show a CPU usage of more than 100% on machines with more than 1 logical CPU[1]. More specifically, the maximum CPU usage can be ((# logical CPUs) * 100)%.\nIn Solaris mode the maximum CPU usage is 100%. Basically this takes the IRIX mode value and divides it by the number of logical CPUs.\nThis is all consistent with the the top command line tool so see the top man page for more info. http://linux.die.net/man/1/top\n[1] If a processor supports hyper-threading then each core can appear as 2 logical CPUs.\n\nA: 100% CPU usage represents full usage of one CPU core.\nAnything above 100% represents a multithreaded process utilizing more than one core.\n\nA: It means you are utilizing the full power of CPU. I personally feel monitor never give 100% accurate readings. It only shows approximate results.\nNormally this happens if you are doing things like - copying over 2 GB size files, Running apache, sql, xsp, etc servers side by side, editing or rendering videos, writing DVD disks etc.\nPlaying any graphics game means video editing on the way. You are continuously editing the images. Thats why it shows such high cpu usage. Its normal. Any graphics related application takes huge ram and lots of processor cycles to run. \nMay be different OSs calculates and shows CPU usage differently. May be mac shows processor usage by processes not as a whole.

As shintoist already wrote, you don't have to use Unity with Natty.\nIt's always a good idea to try it on a live system before you upgrade to ensure that your hardware supports the new system - for me a live system on an USB key worked without any problem, in contrast to the author of the article you linked.\n\nA: The person in the first article for some reason decided to upgrade from a live CD, you don't need to do anything quite so extreme. You just open update-manager and they're is a little button with the option to go up to 11.04, keeping all your setting etc.\nAs for unity, I like it personally but if you don't, not a problem, just change your session type to \"Ubuntu Classic\" once at log-in and you'll get a good ol' gnome desktop every time you log in :)\nSimples\n\nA: i have tried the upgrade to 11.04 twice.  it failed both times and i had to rebuild my system from a disc both times. all i got was a blank screen. i have since read that it is best to do a clean install from a disc as any and all existing bugs will corrupt your system. unfortunately, ubuntu no longer provides free discs.  i have since moved to zorin, where things actually work out of the box, i do not have to add required applications; flash, ubuntu extras etc.\n", "Q: Unable to locate /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/lib/javaws.jar in /usr/share/java Looks like 11.04 missing javaws.jar.\nNot sure if it is intentional.\n/usr/share/java$ java -version\njava version \"1.6.0_22\"\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea6 1.10.1) (6b22-1.10.1-0ubuntu1)\nOpenJDK Server VM (build 20.0-b11, mixed mode)\n\n\nA: You can try and install Sun (now Oracle) Java version. You can find in that repository ppa:ferramroberto/java. You can add these repositry using that command:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ferramroberto/java\n\nAnd install:\nsudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre\n\nI don't remeber if it is necessery but maybe you have to use update-java-alternatives command to change the default Java engine.\n", "Q: AppIndicator in root I am coding an gui to create a vpn.\nI am using now \"AppIndicator\" after using \"GtkStatusIcon\" but the icon works with the normal user but it's not displayed with sudo or gksudo.\nHow to fix it?\n\nA: The AppIndicator instance should be initiated from an unprivileged user, such as the current logged into desktop. This is is required so D-Bus communication used between the appindicator and the panel to work.\nYou should probably run your program as a normal user, and use gksudo only on the portions requiring root access.\n", "Q: Could not update ICEauthority file /home/me/.ICEauthority I am getting a message\nCould not update ICEauthority file /home/me/.ICEauthority\n\nWhen trying to log into Ubuntu graphically.

I got rid of it by using the following command: \nsudo chown user:user /home/user\n\nReplace user with your user name. \n\nA: I am going to re-install ubuntu. Cannot debug this. Probably gnome3 install borked it.\n\nA: I fixed a similar. ICEAuthority problem which due to the aes module can't be installed in booting, for padlock not detected, in a word, you should blacklist the padlock_aes module like:\ncat /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-ecryptfs.conf\nblacklist padlock-aes \n\nI also post the detailed steps, FYI.\n\nA: I had the same problem and here is how i fixed it:\n\n\n*\n\n*I logged into the system as root\n\n*deleted the user account that had the ICEauthority error (userdel user)\n\n*I then recreated the same account only this time i used a -m switch that \ncreated a home directory for the user(useradd -m user)\n\n*I set the password to the account using this command (passwd user)\n\n*I logged out of my root account.\n\n*Logged in using the new account and VOILA, the no more ICEauthority problems.\n\n*Login was Successful.\n\n*I think the problem might have been when you created the user account, u didn't\ntell the system to create the home directory for that particular user.\n\nA: I was having the same problem, in my case my home directory owner got changed to root somehow.\nchanged it to my user and it worked:\ncd /home\nsudo chown user:user <homedir>\n\nI did not use -R flag option because only the top level directory was affected.\n\nA: I had the same issue, After reading posts about using chown on .ICEauthority, I decided to try changing the Read/Write permission on the file .ICEauthority with chmod.\nIt was originally: -rw-------\nSo I changed it to: -rw-rw-rw-\nAnd it worked!

Only the arrow keys, Enter, and Esc do anything.\n\nA: Scale Window Title Filter is part of the compiz-plugins-extra package.\nInstall this package:\nsudo apt-get install compiz-plugins-extra\n\nAnd then Scale Window Title Filter will show up as a plugin in CompizConfig Settings Manager.\n\nA: I had the same problem and found it was because I had been running ccsm from a shell instead of from the dash.

It looks like the only time that you can choose where an icon goes on the unity launcher, is when you add it. Is there a way to rearrange the order of an icon after it has been added?  \n\nA: You will need to drag the icons out of the launcher (right direction) and then place them wherever you want them to be positioned.\n\nA: You do not need to ctrl-click in Unity 2D; just click the item and hold it for a second without moving the mouse, and then the icon will detach and now it can be dragged to a new position and left there by releasing the mouse button. Note that the icon will automatically push down some other icons when detached in the desired position.\n\nA: How to rearrange icons in Unity Launcher?\nJust drag the icon out of the Launcher.\n\nAnd then just drop it back in the Launcher anywhere you want.\n\n\nA: You can also control-drag the icons in the launcher straight up or down instead of dragging out and then back in.\n\nA: Click and hold the application's launcher icon, and then drag it up or down.\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu 11.10, dragging to the right didn't work for me. When I click an icon and hold the mouse button down for one second without moving the mouse, the icon drops down a few pixels. After that, I can drag it up or down the list to change its position.\n\nA: Yes. Click and hold a launcher. Pull it out to the right so it detaches.\nDrag it up and down and watch the little marker in between the other launchers. When you let go it will insert where that marker is.\nLaunchers have to stay within their 'group': the workspaces, files and folders and applications are one group (they have letters when you hold super) and the other icons are also 1 group (those have a digit when you hold super).\n\nA: Click and hold a launcher icon for a couple seconds then drag it just up or down. Don't pull it out from line. It works in my Ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: When you have a lot of icons on your launcher, it might be a good idea to not only rearrange these, but also use the Unity Launcher Folders Application. It is third party software, but very easy to use and install. That way you can not only rearrange your icons on the launcher, but also create folders in which you keep different kinds of sofware categories such as browsers, office related programs, games, paint and draw and video for instance. \nThis application helped me a lot.

My system was virtually unusable due to memory (or lack thereof) while it was installed. Left running long enough, the indicator will consume massive amounts of memory.  When it was uninstalled, it was like a new computer.  \n\nA: I was having the exact same problem and was just about to report it when I saw your message.  In my case, leaving the computer up and running overnight, the processes list in the system monitor said that Compiz was using about 2GB of memory (I have 4GB in my system).\nSeeing the comment by Greg, I closed the multiload indicator and nothing has changed.  (Yet.  Perhaps it needs some time.)  Processes still shows Compiz as using 2GB of memory.  For all I know, though, it's actually now available for other processes to take as needed.  I guess I'm saying that maybe you're right, Greg, but I haven't seen anything happen yet, but I'll keep the multiload indicator closed so I can see if the memory gets released.\nAs for Compiz itself, it's installed but I've never changed any settings at all.\nAnd Oleg, your English seems just fine!\n\nA: The work around is to use open source driver for nvidea.

The manual for aufs makes several references to something called a \"whiteout\", but it's not clear to me what this is.\nWhat is a whiteout and why would one exist?\n\nA: It is how the union file system supports deleting from a union where the underlying file to be deleted resides on a read-only file system.\nSay you have\n\n\n*\n\n*/bin (read-only)\n\n*/usr/bin (read-only)\n\n*/home/USERNAME/bin (read-write)\n\n\nall union mounted together in /bin (read-write).\nAnd you do rm /bin/ls.\nIt would place a whiteout for ls in /home/USERNAME/bin, which makes it look like /bin/ls has been deleted.\nSee State of the unionfs for a good read and a full explanation.\n", "Q: How do I only use the icons for applications in the Faenza icon set?

More details below.\nDownload the Faenza icon set from gnome-look.org or another site to a local folder. Inside you will see several themes: Faenza, Faenza Dark etc. Basically, the first one is the whole theme that includes all apps icons etc. and it does not depend on other themes, and the others depend on the first (so, if you use, for example, Faenza Dark then you must install Faenza as well).\nSo, unzip Faenza. You may want to rename the folder to something like Faenza Modified. Inside there is a file index.theme. It has extremely clear structure that tells the system where it can find icons for apps, system tray etc.:\n[Icon Theme]\n\n\n*\n\n*Name=Faenza: you may rename it to Faenza Modified, for example (the name will appear in the Appearance>Customize>Icons list).\n\n*Inherits=...: tells the system which icons to use if not found in the current system (this is how, for example, Faenza Dark is made dependent on Faenza).\n\n*Directories=...: the list of all subfolders.\n\n\n[actions/16] [animations/16] etc.\nContains the description for all icon subsets.\nSo, basically, what you can do is look into subfolders, decide which ones you want to exclude, and delete them from Directories=... line.\nNow, Compress the new folder, and Drag'n'Drop it onto the Appearance window (make sure that the icon set with the same name is not installed, otherwise delete it).

Best regards.\n\nA: Bug reference: #518056\nAnswer from Hélio José:  \nFor 64-bit systems:\nsudo -H gedit /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gtk-3.0/3.0.0/immodules.cache\nsudo -H gedit /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gtk-2.0/2.10.0/immodules.cache\n\nFor 32-bit systems:\nsudo -H gedit /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/gtk-2.0/2.10.0/immodules.cache\n\nChange the line\n\"cedilla\" \"Cedilla\" \"gtk20\" \"/usr/share/locale\" \"az:ca:co:fr:gv:oc:pt:sq:tr:wa\"\n\nto\n\"cedilla\" \"Cedilla\" \"gtk20\" \"/usr/share/locale\" \"az:ca:co:fr:gv:oc:pt:sq:tr:wa:en\"\n\nReplace \"ć\" with \"ç\" and \"Ć\" with \"Ç\" in /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose\nsudo cp /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose.bak\nsed 's/ć/ç/g' < /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose | sed 's/Ć/Ç/g' > Compose\nsudo mv Compose /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose\n\nAdd two lines in /etc/environment\nGTK_IM_MODULE=cedilla\nQT_IM_MODULE=cedilla\n\nRestart your computer. \n\nA: Choose keyboard = USA international with dead keys\nTry Keyboard>layout>options>Key to choose 3rd level> right ctrl\nthen try right ctrl +  <, press first the right ctrl and keep it pressed, then\nwith another finger press <\n\nA: If you're in a hurry, do this and you'll get \"ç\" instead of \"ć\":\nPress \"AltGr + ,\" then \"c\".\nIf you want to know a bit more, keep on reading.\nThis may be solved already by using one of the answers above, but I realized the best thing to do is use the keyboard layout, instead of changing things you'll have to eventually change again in the future (after updates, for example).\nBefore I start, keep in mind I'm using Ubuntu 14.04.2, which is not the same distro as the original question mentions (11.04). Anyway, I believe most users migrated to newwer versions by now. So:\n$ cat /etc/issue\nUbuntu 14.04.2 LTS \\n \\l\n\nOkay, the first thing I did was looking at the immodules files:\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gtk-2.0/2.10.0/immodules.cache\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gtk-3.0/3.0.0/immodules.cache\nAt the header, those files clearly mention they should not be changed, since they're generated automatically:\n# GTK+ Input Method Modules file\n# Automatically generated file, do not edit\n# Created by /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgtk-3-0/gtk-query-immodules-3.0 from gtk+-3.10.8\n\nSo changing them, although it may solve the problem temporarily, is not ideal.\nLooking around, I found the best answer ever about why we get a \"ć\" instead of a \"ç\" when typing ' + c: because we're really putting an acute accent on the top of letter \"c\". So the layout is right. With that in mind, how would one put a \"kind of a\" comma at the bottom of the \"c\" letter? Using a comma, of course!\nSo, the solution was the key combination AltGR + , and then \"c\".\nNo need for changing any configuration on your computer.\n\nA: Using the Character Map you can copy and paste the character.\n\n\nA: Use ibus to provide you with these special characters. You will need to install the compose extension to ibus from the software centre or synaptic.\n", "Q: Application Indicator for Shutter Looking through the list of application indicators, I see screenshots that appear to have a Shutter indicator. Where can I find & install this?\n\nA: Shutter doesn't have an indicator because there are no indicator bindings for Perl.\nInstead I keep shutter on my launcher and just use the quicklists to do take fast screenshots:\n\n\nA: Andrei from WebUpd8 has written an application indicator for Shutter. It isn't perfect, but you should find it satisfactory. It works in 11.04 and 11.10.\nTo install it:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install indicator-shutter\n\nOr:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8 to your software sources.\n\n*Refresh the sources.\n\n*Install indicator-shutter <--- by clicking on this icon or running\nsudo apt-get install indicator-shutter\n\nInstructions taken from here.\n\nA: There is - at least - an official solution with Shutter 0.89, available in Shutter PPA.\nTo get the official Shutter indicator, you will need to add and upgrade/install from the official stable Shutter PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:shutter/ppa\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install shutter\n\nCheck this article for details: Shutter Screenshot App Finally Adds an App Indicator\n\nA: Until they get perl bindings for app indicator, you can whitelist Shutter systray as per the one-line command posted in this question, \n\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist \"$(gsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist | sed -e \"s/]$/, 'shutter']/\")\"\n\n\nGUI Editor method\n\n\n*\n\n*Install dconf-tools\n\n*Open dconf-editor\nRun Command Alt+F2 and type dconf-editor\n\n*Navigate to desktop => unity => panel \n\n\n*Add the text ,'shutter' to the end of the list (inside the square bracket).\n\n*Close dconf-editor and restart Unity (Run Command Alt+F2 and type unity)\n\nA: I had to install the following additional packages before shutter would appear in the launcher. Even then, it disappears without warning, so you must lock it to the launcher as soon as the app is up:\nsudo apt-get install libnet-dropbox-api-perl    # Dropbox support\nsudo apt-get install libnet-dbus-glib-perl      # UbuntuOne required?\n\n", "Q: Intel DH57JG vs. Ubuntu 11.04 I've installed 11.04 on my pc (processor i5 660) and what I get on start-up is in sequence a violet screen a black one and after system crash.\nThe unique way to log in Ubuntu is in recovery mode.

I just updated to 11.04, now if I drag a window to the side of the workspace, the window is maximized to half of the screen. is there a way to move it to another workspace with the mouse?\nI know you can right-click on the title and choose \"move to Another Workspace\", but I would like something quicker.\n\nA: You have a few options:\nUse keyboard shortcuts\nUse Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Left/Right/Up/Down to move the current window as you change workspaces.\nUse the Workspace Switcher\nOpen the Workspace Switcher (Click the \"Workspace Switcher\" icon in the launcher or press Super+S) and then drag-and-drop windows between workspaces.\nDisable edge resize actions\nInstall the CompizConfig Settings Manager, set the options in Grid ▸ Edges ▸ Resize Actions to None, and check Desktop Wall ▸ Edge Flipping ▸ Edge Flip Move.\n\nA: Simple way: Use workspace switcher and drag the window to your desired workspace.\n\nIdeal way: install compizconfig-settings-manager (click HERE to install) and enable edge flipping.\nAfter installing, invoke compizconfig-settings-manager with ccsm or by searching in Dash. Select Desktop Wall and in the Edge Flipping tab check \"Edge Flip Move.\"\n\nNow you can drag windows between workspaces. (Note your pointer needs to press against the side of the workspace around the middle.) It takes a second before the viewport changes.\n\nCompizconfig-settings-manager can also set keyboard shortcuts to move windows between workspaces:\n\n\nA: The older way of dragging a window outside the screen was sending it partly to another workspace because the \"window snapping\" feature was absent (the one that you experienced: \"if I drag a window to the side of the workspace, the window is maximized to half of the screen\"). Now, it is enabled by default. Do disable it, install Unity Tweaks Tool: Window snapping: OFF. \n\nBut there is another more elegant way which keeps the window snapping enabled by using  Unity Tweaks Tool.\nThis may vary, but imagine that we have two horizontal workspaces and the lower hotcorners set for showing workspaces and spreading windows:\n\nSo, we can just go with the pointer to lower right corner to expose all windows and select the one we want to move\n\nAnd when that is selected, we put the mouse to the lower left corner to see all workspaces and drag the window where we want:\n \n\nA: You can do this with gnome-panel.\nFirst type gnome-panel on terminal. Then you will see the list of open programs on bottom left panel(just like taskbar of window). And on bottom right there will be four workspace. Just you need to drag the bottom left program to the workspace of your choice. \nUnlike unity-2d-shell, the program will only be visible if you go to the workspace containing that program.\n", "Q: Which union filesystem is best supported?

That's what I'd use, but you're right - there's not really an upstream union filesystem solution that I'm aware of.\n\nA: I can't help you pick the best solution, but for information on the vfs solution and a well written series of articles on linux union mounts, have a look at A brief history of union mounts by Valerie Aurora. According to a post on her blog in January, it is not quite done yet. \n\nA: Added also here: Cannot mount second drive at \"/\"\nUpdate: the overlayfs file-system has been promoted to standard kernel for version 3.18.

I was running Maverick very fluently, before I upgraded to Natty. However, the display performance seems fall down. For example, zoom desktop is very well in Maverick, but very slow in Natty. \nI think it's caused by Unity. So I installed Gnome 3, using the source deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/gnome3-team/gnome3/ubuntu natty main.\nAfter installed Gnome 3, unfortunately it runs in fallback mode, and said maybe my graphics hardware is not supported.\n$ lspci |grep -i vga\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 82G33/G31 Express Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 10)\n\nShould I have to upgrade my graphics card? The card is bought 2 years ago, though.\n\nA: Unity is implemented as a Compiz plugin, therefore it is just like a standard Compiz effect. Compared to standard Compiz effects, Unity uses quite a few hardware features of the graphics card. \nIn addition, Compiz has been available on Linux for many years, therefore it is quite mature.\nOn the other hand, GNOME Shell has Mutter, a new window manager that does not use Compiz. Therefore, there will be differences. Mutter might have some bugs, or it might be even speedier than with Compiz. GNOME Shell cannot do all these Compiz 3D effects such as Cube, because it does not use Compiz.\nWhat you should do is try out both, and look for any debugging messages that may explain performance issues.\n\nA: for smooth desktop effect with intel graphic cards, you can disable \"Sync To VBlank\" option\nfirst, install ccsm then go to Opengl -> untick Sync To VBlank option\n", "Q: How can I hide the decoration of maximized windows?

I think I know how to fix it but I've just upgraded to Natty, having patiently waited for the final release date and for Ubuntu to nag me about it every minute.

This happens AFTER THE LOGIN, on ALL desktops, except for safe mode, including Unity, Classic and, my standard desktop, KDE.\nI can't find any error in any log. All seems to work fine. Sometimes the system starts for a couple of seconds and then freezes, sometimes it freezes while the desktop is still loading.

I'd like to upgrade to the latest and greatest Ubuntu release, but not at the risk of affecting the backup, or worse, having to start from scratch again and upload the entire library! \n\nA: Crashplan support recommends uninstalling the program first then reinstalling once you have upgraded you OS.\nThis can be done by running the uninstall script located in the Crashplan-install folder.\nOnce you have reinstalled you can adopt your previous backup for your upgraded system.\nReference\n\nA: We're seeing that, with 11.04 and Crashplan V3, we always get the message \"No files selected for backup\", no matter what files are actually selected. Not a problem with prior version of Ubuntu.\n\nA: I'm am successfully using CrashPlan on Ubuntu 11.04 (natty). You should have no problems with CrashPlan on 11.04 of itself. I had also used it on Ubuntu 10.10, but I performed a fresh install of 11.04. \nIf your primary concern is having to re-upload all of your data, CrashPlan allows you to 'adopt' a previous computer. This means that e.g. a fresh install of 11.04 would be considered a new computer. When you start CrashPlan for the first time and log in, you can select a previous 'computer' (the one you had from 10.10) and effectively take it over, making the newly installed 11.04 replace it, saving yourself a lot of backup time.\nhttp://support.crashplan.com/doku.php/recipe/adopting_another_computer?redirect=1\n", "Q: How do I use the lock-keys-applet in Unity?

To discover the IP address for mydomain.net a computer will work in a similar way that to find a file on /net/mydomain. First it must read the root dir to find where id the net dir, in dns land it will have to ask the root servers for .net. Then it will read the net dir to search for mydomain, in dns land it will ask the.net server for mydomain.\nNote that this was not a technically correct answer. Filesystems don't work that way, DNS caching and multiple DNS makes name resolving more complicated. But I feel that it is a simple model.\nBack to your problem: the .net root dns are saying that the authoritative dns for your domain are dns1.stabletransit.com. and dns2.stabletransit.com.. So when a computer is triying to resolve test.mydomain.net it will ask dns1.stabletransit.com for the test.mydoin.net IP, not your server, and stabletransit doesn't know anything about test.\nYou have two options:\n1) The sensible and easy one. Forget about running your dns server and just add test.mydomain.net to dns1.stabletransit.com. There is likely some option to do it where you bougth the domain.\n2) The geek way, great for learning. Delegate your dns to your own server, learn all about dns, find some secondaries (your ISP will likely do it) and have fun. You will have to read quite a lot of documentation and experiment a little. Be sure that you are able to access your domain by IP, you will need it when (not if) something goes wrong.\n", "Q: How do I change the chat and mail clients in the indicator area?

Is there a way to make the titles of the windows appear under them, or inside the Alt-Tab window, like in Windows?\n\nA: There is a bugreport on launchpad for that.\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/757814\nI guess you can keep your eye on that post to see what is going on.\n\nA: There is another bug report, but about the Scale part of your question (the double clicking on the icon in the launcher): https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/734253\nAnd there is given a solution for better recognizing the different documents in the zoomed out view by adding the window titles:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable the Text plugin in Compiz Config Settings Manager\n\n*In the Scale addons plugin of CCSM: set Appearance -> Window title -> Window title display to All windows\n\n\nNow, if you double click on the icon in the launcher, you also see the titles of all the windows and it is much easier to pick the right one.\n\nA: One solution that works for me is to have the currently selected window in the alt-tab switcher come to the front of the workspace each time I hit it. To enable this:\n\n\n*\n\n*In CompizConfig Settings Manager, click Static Application Switcher in the Window Management section\n\n*Switch to the Appearance tab and twirl out the section Select Window Highlight at the bottom\n\n*Change Highlight Mode to Bring Selected to Front\n\n*Adjust the top three sliders on the Appearance page to taste for deemphasis of non-selected windows (I just do Brightness and Saturation at 70 each.)\n\n\nAlt-tab to give it a test run! Sometimes the actual alt-tab menu gets in the way of things needed to identify the chosen window, but this still makes a world of difference for me when I'm switching between many open windows.\n\nA: There are a few useful options in Compiz Config Settings Manager for the Scale plugin (which presents the windows side by side when clicking twice on the launcher icon). First, install the app 'Advanced Desktop Effects Settings (CCSM)' from the Software Centre, then:\n\n\n*\n\n*try reducing the space between windows, so they appear larger (in ccsm, scale plugin > appearance > spacing)\n\n*enable the 'scale addons' plugin, and in the options for that plugin, under appearance, you can set the option 'window title display' to 'all windows'. You also have to make sure that the compiz 'text' plugin is enabled. Enabling this will probably mess up Unity, but things should be working fine after a restart. \n\n*another useful option in 'scale addons' (I think set by default) is to right click on a window whilst in 'scale' mode to zoom into that window. Left click to select, or right-click again to zoom out. You can even close one of the windows with middle-click\n\n", "Q: How do I change the Super key dash shortcut menu \nPossible Duplicate:\nCan I edit which icons appear in the Unity dash? \n\nIn 11.04 when I press the \"Super\" key it brings up a handy \"Shortcuts\" menu.  Unfortunately, the things that have been placed in that menu are of no use to me.  How can I change the \"Shortcut\" menu items to the things I really want?\n\nA: I think you can change the key mapping via Compizconfig-Settings-Manager (ccsm). If you don't find it under Menu -> Preference, then please install it from software center. \nThen from CCSM please locate the Ubuntu Unity Plugin, which you can find under Desktop section in Compizconfig-Settings-Manager. Click on it and there you can find an option as \"key to show the launcher \". Click on it and select some other key combination as per your choice. \nI hope it works for you.\n\nA: The 2nd row in dash are programs that are the default programs (*) or have been used by you. I did not get this in the beginning either but dash is not a search tool but it is a 'you used this alot before so I show it to you now too'-tool: Dash automatically changes content based on what you use. \nIf you have firefox as a browser in dash and remove firefox, then add chromium dash will not show chromium (you did not use it...) but after using chromium it does. \n(*) to change the default have a look at preferred applications for some options:\n\nSidenote: you can add activity journal to add some insight in zeitgeist/dash-usage:\n\n", "Q: How do I install this mysql workbench package?

Instead, pressing Fn+F2 opens Dash. \nIs there any other way to toggle between LCD/CRT or reenable Fn+F2 key?\n\nA: It is possible that your computer's BIOS is converting the Fn+F2 key press into Win+P or similar.  Many of the Unity shortcuts make use of this key, which might explain what you are seeing.\nThat is the key sequence used to bring up the screen configuration dialog on modern versions of Windows, and Microsoft has suggested that manufacturers make the BIOS map their old Fn based shortcuts to the new key sequence.  A more technical description of this can be found here.\nIf this is what you are seeing, then there isn't much that can be done: the key sequence remapping is being done at such a low level that Linux can't distinguish the key press from you actually typing Win+P.  It will probably require Unity to catch this key sequence and do the display toggle itself.\nI've filed a bug report about this here:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/778277\n", "Q: Drawer or other organisation for hundreds of scripts in Unity Launcher I have a large number of .sh scripts for opening ssh connections to various remote machines.

So I must apt-get install perl python by hand.\nHow to make dpkg -i install these dependencies for me automatically?\n\nA: After using dpkg, running the following command helped me to install the required dependencies:\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nIn all, your terminal should look like this:\n$ sudo dpkg -i package_with_unsatisfied_dependencies.deb\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent ... \n[additional messages]\n\n$ sudo apt-get -f install\n[apt messages]\nSetting up [dependency]...\nSetting up package_with_unsatisfied_dependencies...\n\nNotice the line about Setting up package_with_unsatisfied_dependencies. This fixes (and completes) the installation of package_with_unsatisfied_dependencies.deb.\n\nA: Gdebi\ngdebi installs a deb package and its dependencies. To use it run:\nsudo gdebi package.deb\n\nIn newer versions of Ubuntu, this is not installed by default, so you will need to install it from the repositories.\nSee man gdebi for a full list of options.\ngdebi is the command line equivalent to the graphical tool of the same name that used to be included by default in Ubuntu. The command for the graphical tool is gdebi-gtk and has similar functionality:\n\n\nA: As an alternative to gdebi-gtk you can use Ubuntu Software Center.\nDouble click on the package and an install button should be available.\n\nA: You could create a file dpkg-dep-inst with the following content.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nDEBIAN_FILE1=$1\ndpkg -i $DEBIAN_FILE1 || apt-get --fix-broken install\n\nI assume you created the file in your home folder. Make it executable with chmod +x dpkg-dep-inst and move it to /usr/local/bin with sudo cp dpkg-dep-inst /usr/local/bin.\nNow you can install the debian package with dependencies automatically with:\nsudo dpkg-dep-inst foo-1.2.3.deb\n\n\nA: starting with apt 1.1 (available in Xenial (16.04), stretch) apt install also allows local files:\nsudo apt install ./foo-1.2.3.deb\n\nSo much simpler and cleaner.\nSee the release announcment\n\nA: running \nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nafter installing package with dpkg may solve broken depencies (at least man apt-get  say so...). Ill update when i will check it.\n\nA: I just ran into this problem. Calling apt-get install -f will not install recommended dependencies, though!

Then open the terminal, change directories using cd to the directory containing package-name.deb, and type:\napt install --simulate ./package-name.deb # This command does not require sudo.\nwhere package-name.deb should be replaced by the name of a .deb file located in the current directory that you are trying to install.\nThe above command will not install anything, but it will print a message listing any dependencies of package-name.deb that do not exist in the default Ubuntu repositories. You will need to manually download and install the .deb files of these missing dependency packages in order to install package-name.deb. Run apt install --simulate ./manually-downloaded-package.deb before installing any of these manually downloaded dependency packages in order to check if these packages have any unmet dependencies themselves.\nIf the simulated command completes successfully, run the following command to install package-name.deb.\nsudo apt install ./package-name.deb\nThere can be multiple .deb files in the same command if the .deb files are all located in the current directory.\nsudo apt install ./package-name-1.deb ./package-name-2.deb\n\n\nA: You can install gdebi-core, which is the command line version of the GDebi package installer from 10.04 and earlier. In the newer versions of Ubuntu, the Software Center is used to install debs, which doesn't have a command line equivalent.\nTo install a deb package using gdebi, just run:\nsudo gdebi my_package_1.0.deb\n\n\nA: dpkg doesn't have dependency support. There is a way around it but that would require you to make a local database (and thus you would already know the dependencies) and it is considered obsolete (...).\nDoes it have to be command line? (server install?) If so also have a look at apt-get -f but be careful: solving dependencies after install could have you end up with a broken system.\ngdebi (gui frontend) used to be able to do this but got replaced with USC.\nHow did you download the .deb. Some of the new 11.04 features is the handling of .deb downloaded from a website: it gets opend in USC so dependencies will be solved by the installer. \nEDIT based on comment by andrew:\nsudo gdebi foo-1.2.3.deb \nwould do the trick!!\n\nA: Actually the answer is that dpkg package manager cannot install dependencies out of the box. You cam man dpkg and found that out. So you need to use tools like apt, apt-get, aptitude, ..., based on dpkg.\nI would say just the same case is for the rpm package manager on the other Linux hemisphere. rmp is not meant to do dependency based installs. It can install single packages, and for installing the dependencies you use yum, urpmi, up2date these are all based on RPM.\nAs noted there is a slight danger installing packages with dpkg directly, because later dependency resolution resolving may end up with a broken system as @Rinzwind outlined.\n\nA: The below command will attempt to correct any dependency issues\nsudo apt-get install -f\nSo it's good practice to run that after installing a package\nsudo dpkg -i YOUR-PACKAGE.deb && sudo apt-get install -f\n", "Q: No Firefox (internet) icon in dash Why I have no Firefox icon in Dash (like in clean install of Natty)? My system was updated from 10.10 (and from 10.04 in turn). Preferred app for internet is set to Firefox. It's my most often used application, how to fix this?\n\n\nSorry my Russian locale.\n\nA: Since another users dont have that issue, problem was in home dir. I think it was caused by upgrades from 3.0 -> 3.5 -> 4.0 firefox from PPA in the past.\nSolved by deletion of some duplicated firefox,*firefox.desktop* files from home dir. \n\nA: The dash should keep track of your frequently used applications. Firefox should place itself in there if you use it a few times. \n\nA: If you right mouse click on an icon in the Unity dock (I'm confused is this the dash?), you can make it's placement there fixed (see image below).  So the next time you want to run the application, all you do is click on the associated icon.  The reverse can be done for applications you do not want to show up all of the time.\n\n\nA: I think that this question covers yours.\nSo, press Super, type preferred applications, and change the settings there. Do a restart and it should be fixed, I think.\n", "Q: How to restore the global application menu for Chromium Browser?

When opening programs like GIMP, I find having background windows open distracting because GIMP has three separate windows associated with it.\nIt's a burden to have to go to every other non-Gimp window manually to minimize it. What I need is a keyboard shortcut in Ubuntu that matches Windows' Super + Home shortcut. One that minimizes all windows except the active one.\nIs it possible to achieve this behavior in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Here's a pretty simple approach using wmctrl\nwmctrl -k on;  wmctrl -R :ACTIVE:\nThe first command shows the desktop (i.e. minimizes all windows) and the second command raises the \"active\" window which is whatever was active before the minimizing.  I put this in a one-line bash script and then set a keyboard shortcut to that script.  \nedit: restore all windows using:\nwmctrl -l | cut -d' ' -f 1 | xargs -n1 wmctrl -i -a\n\nA: It is possible to achieve this with a python script. The script requires python-wnck and python-gtk to be installed in order to work, although I think these are installed by default anyway.\nCopy and paste this into a text editor and save in a sensible place (eg. as minimise.py in your home folder):\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport wnck\nimport gtk\n\nscreen = wnck.screen_get_default()\n\nwhile gtk.events_pending():\n    gtk.main_iteration()\n\nwindows = screen.get_windows()\nactive = screen.get_active_window()\n\nfor w in windows:\n    if not w == active:\n        w.minimize()\n\nYou can then set up the keyboard shortcut by opening Keyboard Shortcuts.\n\nClick on Add to create a new shortcut.\n\nUse the command bash -c 'python ~/minimise.py' (this is assuming you saved it as minimise.py in your home folder).\n\nYou can then assign your preferred keyboard combination to this action.\nThe script will minimise all non-active windows. I don't think this is very useful for your use case because you will want to have all of the Gimp windows open. You can use a slightly different script to minimise all windows that aren't from the current application instead:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport wnck\nimport gtk\n\nscreen = wnck.screen_get_default()\n\nwhile gtk.events_pending():\n    gtk.main_iteration()\n\nwindows = screen.get_windows()\nactive_app = screen.get_active_window().get_application()\n\nfor w in windows:\n    if not w.get_application() == active_app:\n        w.minimize()\n\n\nA: bash script using xdotool:\ncurrentwindowid=$(xdotool getactivewindow)\ncurrentdesktopid=$(xdotool get_desktop)\n\nfor w in $(xdotool search --all --maxdepth 3 --desktop $currentdesktopid --name \".*\"); do\n  if [ $w -ne $currentwindowid ] ; then\n    xdotool windowminimize \"$w\"\n  fi\ndone\n\nit minimizes only windows on the current desktop.\nTo minimize windows on all desktops:\ncurrentwindowid=$(xdotool getactivewindow)\n\nfor w in $(xdotool search --all --maxdepth 3 --name \".*\"); do\n  if [ $w -ne $currentwindowid ] ; then\n    xdotool windowminimize \"$w\"\n  fi\ndone\n\n\nA: Since python-wnck is no longer in the apt repository (Kubuntu 18.04 Bionic), below is the modified python code (from the answer above by @Aditya and @dv3500ea).\nFrom python3 onwards wnck is part of the GObject Introspection API (source). So, syntax for importing wnck (and Gtk objects) has changed.\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\n# import necessary objects\nimport gi\ngi.require_version('Wnck', '3.0') # specify Wnck version\nfrom gi.repository import Wnck\n\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk\n\n\n# the script itself\nscreen = Wnck.Screen.get_default()\n\nwhile Gtk.events_pending():\n    Gtk.main_iteration()\n\nwindows = screen.get_windows()\nactive = screen.get_active_window()\n\nfor w in windows:\n    if not w == active:\n        w.minimize()\n\nthen assign the shortcut to the python script:\n(in Kubuntu) kmenueditor -> create a new item -> script bash -c 'python path_to_the_python_script.py' -> assign a desired shortcut\nUPDATE (May'19):\nAt Kubuntu 19.04 I needed to install gir1.2-wnck-3.0 module to make the script above work.\n$ python -V\nPython 2.7.16\n$ sudo apt-get install python3-gi gir1.2-wnck-3.0\n\n\nA: Ubuntu 21.10 is running Wayland and I want this functionality on my new monitor.

I'm trying to connect an external monitor to my laptop via a DisplayLink USB adapter. When I plug in the USB cable, the screen turns bright green. This apparently indicates that the udflib displaylink driver is installed, and has detected the USB driver (according to http://libdlo.freedesktop.org/wiki/displaylink-mod).\nAll of the instructions I've read on how to configure displaylink with ubuntu involve manually editing the xorg.conf file, but it seems like Ubuntu 11.04 with Unity handles xorg.conf differently. From what I can tell, it either does not use it or places it in a different location.\nHas anyone been able to get a displaylink-powered monitor working on 11.04?\n\nA: This answer pertains to Ubuntu 11.04 with an ATI radeon graphics card, and the Diamond DisplayLink BVU-195 USB display adapter.\nI finally got it working for three monitors. I have an ATI radeon card with 1 DVI and 2 DisplayPort outputs (but you can only use two at once) and 1 Diamond DisplayLink BVU 195 USB adaptor.\nYou have to install the displaylink driver. Then you have to write your own xorg.conf file.\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-displaylink\n\nHere are three crucial points. \n\n\n*\n\n*I want to be able to move windows between displays. That means that I cannot use xrandr. Instead, i have to enable something called Xinerama. If you use the default \"xrandr\" option, then only the mouse cursor can move between displays, and programs cannot. Not very usuable! So Xinerama is a necessity.\n\n*When configuring the ATI radeon driver, the display is stuck as cloned across the two monitors that it uses, unless you specify the \"ZaphodHeads\" option. Valid options on my card are \"DVI-0\" and \"DisplayPort-0\" or \"DisplayPort-1\".\n\n*You have to configure all monitors as 16 bit. If you stick with the default 24 bit, the X server crashes.\n\n*I only get blank screens if the USB monitor is plugged in when I boot. I have to boot with it unplugged, plug it in, then log in only when the USB screen turns green.\nHere is my xorg.conf, which I placed in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.

For each title, create a launcher or a shell script which will execute something like gnome-terminal -t \"My awesome title here\". Other option would be to create a separate profile for each title and execute terminal with e.g. --window-with-profile=PROFILENAME option - see man gnome-terminal.\nIf this won't work, I'll need more info on your configuration, especially what version of Ubuntu and what desktop environment/session (e.g. Gnome Classic) you use - screenshot showing the non-changed title in taskbar would be handy too.\n", "Q: Remove drivers intalled from Additional Drivers section Ubuntu 11.04 was working fine with my Nvidia GT550M graphic card.

Then when restoring, you would boot the virtual guest with the restore tool and reimage into the virtual guest.  Most of the time, the virtual guest will boot without any changes.  You can also use the \"hardware changes\" part of the toolset to force Windows XP to find drivers during the first reboot.  Once install, install the VirtualBox Guest Additions to complete the virtual hardware device driver install.\nTo V2P you would do something similar - its often easier since the virtual guest has less \"exotic\" hardware to deal with.  Once done, go through the device manager and install all the missing device drivers.\nMore hit-and-miss V2P solution if you dont want to buy the tool, is to go through the virtual windows XP device manager and deinstall every device you can find.  Shutdown the guest and reboot it with an ISO of Clonezilla.  Image off the virtual windows XP onto an external drive.\nOn the physical machine, boot with a CD of clonezilla and restore the image of windows XP.  If you are lucky, Windows will boot with low graphics available.  Sometimes you need to boot into safe mode and install a few drivers such as VGA and networking.  Sometimes you need to boot the restore physical computer with the Windows XP installation disc and do a repair install.\nSimilarly to P2V, remove as many device drivers as possible using device manager and do a similar Clonezilla backup before restoring into a virtual guest.\n", "Q: Why is my harddrive louder, when I use Windows, compared to linux? This is something I noticed: When I use Windows, my hard drive is louder and running almost all the time. \nIn Ubuntu on the other hand, it runs quieter and more seldom. This even applies, when I start a windows-virtual machine on ubuntu host system and the noise goes up. \nI observed this on several computers and set-ups. Any ideas? Can someone confirm this?\n\nA: If this is a Windows 7 (or Vista) installation, it's likely the prefetch and superfetch processes that have your hard drive moving.  However, be cautioned that this could indicate a hard disk problem (such as a bad sector) within the Windows partition.  \nI just replaced a bad hard drive on an Acer Aspire laptop due to numerous bad sectors.  The Windows partition repeatedly crashed (I reloaded the OS a few times, though getting a solid installation was futile).  My Ubuntu partition ran well, even though it displayed numerous hard drive errors during boot. \n\nA: To answer your first question, the hard drive will simply be more active due to the much more frequent disk I/O activity from Windows. I'm not really sure what the root cause of the increased disk activity is, but consider that the memory requirements of Windows 7 are much higher than that of Ubuntu. Therefore Windows will be using the swapfile more often, and that will result in increased disk activity.\nA second cause might be the numerous 'scans' that Windows runs. This includes the file indexer (unless you've turned it off), spyware / virus scans, etc. Those sometimes run without any prompting and can really put some stress on the disk.\nThe third reason could simply be the filesystem itself - Windows uses the NTFS filesystem by default and Ubuntu uses Ext4 by default. My own experience has demonstrated that Ext4 is much faster at bulk file operations than NTFS. (Nothing official, but certainly reproducible.)\n", "Q: How do I run QEMU with a 64-bit processor on a 64-bit machine? I'm running Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal) 64-bit and recently installed qemu-kvm. Now I want to start a 64-bit live CD using:\nqemu -m 512 -boot d -cdrom archlinux-2010.05-netinstall-x86_64.iso\n\nThis loads the image, and I can select to boot Arch Linux the normal way, but it will give me an error that I have to use a 64-bit machine to run this live CD.

Is there a tool (command-line is fine) that can convert accented characters to HTML entities in Ubuntu? Preferably recursively and without also converting html/php tags.\ne.g.\nfrom: é\nto: &#233;\nor: &eacute;\n\n\nA: Recode can convert to HTML entities:\n$ echo \"é\" | recode ..html\n&eacute;\n\nThere are a few slightly different HTML transformations available in recode; see info recode HTML.\nIf you want to recode a file or some files, you can use\n$ recode ..html one_file another_file and so on\n\nFor recursive action, use the find command, e.g.\n$ find your_directory -type f -name \"*.html\"\n\nThe above find command will only show the files. Please make sure that you have found only the right files, not any binaries and not any files in unwanted directories. It is also a good idea to make a backup or use a copy of your files, not the real files. If you have found the correct find command, append -exec your_command {} +, where your_command is the recode ..html from above and the {} denotes the file(s) which are given by find to recode:\n$ find your_directory -type f -name \"*.html\" -exec recode ..html {} +\n\nBut wait a moment, there's one big caveat: recode ..html assumes that your input files are in the same character set (encoding) that you are using on the command line. If all of your files use the \"modern\" UTF-8, it will work fine, because Ubuntu used UTF-8 from the standard. But if some of your files use the older ISO-8859-1 or other charsets, it will be a lot more complicated.\n\nA: probably sed.

Can anyone help me to change that directory either from php side or netbens. (step by step thnks guys.....)\n\nA: I'm not so sure about netbeans, but for normal websites, I prefer to symlink to actual folders that I need to be hosted inside the www directory.\nFor eg :\n/var/www/project_name -> /home/usr/netbeansproject/project_name/\nI do this for all my websites on my laptop.\n\nA: When saving a file or creating a project, you'll have to specify the \"Sources folder\" in th dialog that appears.\nFor instance when you create a new PHP project: File > New Project - Then you select PHP and PHP Application and click \"Next >\". The next part is where you specify the project name and the folder you want it to be saved in.\nNetBeans is built to handle projects, and it works best that way.\nAnother option would be to change the settings of your web server.

My os is 11.04.\nI have apache2 & mysql installed.\nHow to stop apache2, mysql from starting automatically as computer starts?\n\nA: MySQL is handled by upstart. In 11.04 you can use the new override feature to modify the starting behaviour:\necho \"manual\" >> /etc/init/mysql.override\n\nSee the section \"Disabling a Job from Automatically Starting\" in the Upstart Cookbook\nApache still uses traditional SysV init scripts so you use\n update-rc.d -f apache2 remove\n\nto remove the links from /etc/rcX.d or, alternatively, use\n update-rc.d apache2 disable\n\nwhich \"disables\" the script by changing it from a start script S91apache2 to a stop script K09apache2. This is reversible by update-rc.d apache2 enable.\n\nA: This thread will help you: https://superuser.com/questions/35151/how-do-i-stop-services-from-starting-on-boot-on-ubuntu\n\nA: Interestingly, it's a different answer for each package in 11.04.\n\n\n*\n\n*apache2 uses System V style init scripts.  To disable it from boot: sudo update-rc.d -f apache2 remove\n\n*However, mysql uses an Upstart job, to disable it, create an \"override\" file: echo \"manual\" | sudo tee /etc/init/mysql.override\nTo learn more about override files, see: The Upstart Cookbook\n\nA: update-rc.d is a good CLI tool to do this. The linked page has an example involving apache2\n\nA: It was't working for me. When trying to disable mysql in ubuntu I was receiving the message:\nSystem start/stop links for /etc/init.d/mysql do not exist.\nSo I found a work around in this link: http://forum.linode.com/viewtopic.php?t=5594\n\nsudo mkdir /etc/init.disabled\nsudo mv /etc/init/mysql.conf /etc/init.disabled/\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nA: use rcconf to enable/disable a service to auto run on boot.\nsudo apt-get install rcconf\nNow, type sudo rcconf\nAnd you will see list of services that are installed on your Ubuntu machine. Those marked with star are auto run during boot process. To disable Apache, MySql just navigate to it using arrows and press space bar. Then navigate to OK button using Tab key and again press Space to save configuration.\n\nA: With heavy adoption of systemd as system manager and init system for debian based distributions like ubuntu , we can now use systemctl commands to prevent a service from automatically starting at boot.\nfor example :\n\nsudo systemctl disable apache2\n\nTo start using it when required , you can use:\n\nsudo systemctl start apache2\n\nTo stop using it, you can use:\n\nsudo systemctl stop apache2\n\nAnd to see if it's running or not , you can use :\n\nsudo systemctl status apache2\n\n", "Q: Screen is blank after installing unless I boot with the monitor unplugged I've spent most of today installing Server 11.04.

If I pay for a program can I install it on the three computers I use on a daily basis?    \nHow is licensing decided or are there any restrictions on licenses used?    \nWhere are these kinds of questions documented?\n\nA: This really depends on the publisher of the application.\nThere is a page with information on how licenses work for paid applications in the Ubuntu Software Center:\n\nOnce you’ve enabled licence keys, Ubuntu Software Centre will fetch a licence key when it completes a purchase, and copy that into the right file for your app to check. It is up to you, the developer, to provide keys that are hard to guess, check if the key is there when your application starts and behave accordingly.\nYou will receive a notification by email when the number of available licence keys goes below a certain configurable threshold, and you will see notices when you visit the website telling you about this also. If we run out of license keys we will necessarily stop selling copies of your app.\n\n\nA: All paid applications in the Software Center are user based. The Software Center will allow you to install on all three of your computers. If the application is licensed via a license key, this same license will be used on all three - note that you may be violating the terms of use of the application, however it is not enforced by the Software Center.\nThe new website has a FAQ page at http://developer.ubuntu.com/publish/commercial-software-faqs/ that answers these questions.\n\nA: Currently there's no DRM-like application security system. Developers have to rely on the good will of the users to appreciate the fact that there's no DRM and show that they're responsible enough to not need any DRM.\nIf you want to install your previous purchages after reinstalling Ubuntu, just click on the File -> Reinstall Previous Purchases menu item in Software Center. You'll be prompted for your login details when you click it. And from here it all depends on what happens then: I expect you can download and install the app (not tested ;) ) but technically the website you download from could block you and make you pay again. Save the .deb if you want to be sure.\nPartly taken from: Do I need to re-purchase software in the Ubuntu Software Centre if I reinstall?\n\nA: I would imagine this would depend on the program.

I'm asking my question here because I can't find an answer anywhere else and the Ubuntu forums have not helped at all.\nI am running Firefox and Ubuntu 11.04 on a Dell Dimension 9200. Everything was working fine up to the point where I opened a file in Firefox...\nI downloaded several file using Firefox 4.01. While downloading the files Firefox opened the small Downloads browser window as is normal. I then right-clicked on a PDF file and chose Open with Okular. The file did not open. I did a right-click on the same file and chose Open Containing Folder. This failed as well.\nThe problem I now have is every time I try to open anything from the Firefox Downloads browser window it tries to open it with Okular. I also cannot right-click the file and use Open Containing Folder because it also tries to open in Okular. Everything now tries to open in Okular. What is stranger still is that now if I try to open any of my folders fro the Ubuntu Places menu (such as Home Folder, Videos, Pictures, etc.)  they all try to open in Okular. None of them actually open and all I get is the following error message:\n\nFailed to execute  default file manager. Failed to execute child process \" /user/bin/okular\"\n\nI have uninstalled and reinstalled both Okular and Firefox. I even deleted all of the Firefox preference files and I still get this error message.\nI am also wondering if it may be that my Kensington Exper Mouse trackball driver/software has associated all of these actions with the right-click on the mouse (that is, everything that happens with the right-click tries to open in Okular).\nAny suggestions on how to correct this problem?\n\nA: Looks like your mimetypes are messed up.\nHave a look at my answer here: Chromium \"Show in Folder\" opens in text editor If this is not what is wrong with your setup please leave a comment!\n", "Q: Is there a way to control VLC from the Sound Menu?

Currently, Shotwell limits the crop ratio to a series of pre-defined sizes for printing.  \nHowever, in the upcoming Shotwell 0.10 we've decided to remove that limitation.  In the meantime, you can always right click on the photo and select Open With External Editor to perform the crop in another program.\n\nA: For some reason then this is standard for photo print sizes. I guess Shotwell tries to maintain consistency with this.\n", "Q: How to make all windows appear in center of the screen when you start them up?

How do I delete totem's history displayed in it's main menu in Natty? For example if I don't want anyone to know I'm watching... ehem Simpsons a lot?\nI've tried How can I keep recent files from appearing in Unity? but this doesnt work for Totem.\n\nA: In Unity: go to \"Dash Home\", search for \"System Settings\" and then choose \"Privacy\" -> \"Recent Items\". Change the time interval and press \"Delete history\". With the button on the bottom you can turn off recording of your activity at all, however many programs will ignore it.\n\nA: Recent Document history for many Gnome 2 based applications are held in a file in your home folder called .local/share/recently-used.xbel\nEither use the Launcher \"Home Folder\" - select the menu option \"View - Show Hidden Files\" and navigate to the .local/share folder and delete the file \"recently-used.xbel\"\nAlternatively from the command line\nrm ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel\n\nIf you really want to stop recent document history from showing up for your login account then create a file with your favourite Text Editor called .gtkrc-2.0 and save this file in your home folder.\nAlternatively from the command line\ngedit ~/.gtkrc-2.0\n\nIn that file, include on a separate line\ngtk-recent-files-max-age = 0 \n\n\nA: If you want to permanently remove the recent file list from totem, edit /usr/share/totem/totem.ui as root and change to following line:\n<separator name=\"recent-separator\"/>\n<placeholder name=\"recent-placeholder\"/>\n\ninto\n<!--<separator name=\"recent-separator\"/>\n<placeholder name=\"recent-placeholder\"/>-->\n\nIf you want to reactive history later, all you have to do is remove the part that you added.\n\nA: Well, that will delete the Zeitgeist history (including Dash) but oddly not the history in Totems main menu. Seems like Totem is saving some kind of own history.\nSo this is not a duplicate of \"How can I keep recent files from appearing in Unity?\".\n\nA: Just to 'clear' all history, (but not to 'disable' history from being listed)\nrm -rf ~/.local/share/zeitgeist/ \nrm ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel\nrm ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel~\n\nThe first one destroys everything zeitigeist has in your home folder\nsecond and third just delete the recentest version of the \"recently-used.xbel\"\n\nA: You can clear the Zeitgeist history (this is the history of recent files that's display in Dash) by using the following commands:\nrm ~/.local/share/zeitgeist/activity.sqlite\n\nzeitgeist-daemon --replace\n\nnote: it will clear all the other recent files as well.\n\nA: Heres my workaround:\nLog off, log in again with \"classic ubuntu\" (http://www.robotsystematic.com/2011/linux/ubuntu-natty-gnome-2-interface)\nand clear recent documents as you did in Maverick. When you log in next time to unity-ubuntu, the history of totem is cleared there, too.\n\nA: If you install Bleachbit from http://bleachbit.sourceforge.net/\nOnce installed, you select what you want cleaned from the system, this inclused Totem cache & history.\n\nA: Go to Places -> Recent Documents and clear the list.\n\nA: Nowadays Totem now uses Gnome Tracker to pick what videos to display in the Recent tab. According to https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Tracker/Documentation/First5Minutes, Tracker's db can be cleared by running tracker-control -r\nYou can also run tracker-preferences, System tab and click the \"Yes, remove all of my indexed data\" button.\n\nA: I had some old files stuck in totem history caused by Grilo (part of Ubuntu packages).\nDeleting the below file sorted it. I had to grep -rn . -e 'some history entry title' to find this file. It is not documented.\nrm ./.local/share/grilo-plugins/grl-bookmarks.db-wal\n\n\nA: Vulgar solution:\nRename in home directory the directories: .local, .cache , .config and logout.

When I key in ctl-alt-f[1..12], I am taken to VT1[ ..12] (Virtual Terminal 1..12).  This works wherever I am.\nFrom a Virtual Terminal that is not running a graphical environment, shift-alt-f[1..12] takes me to Virtual Terminal [13..24].  However, if I use the same key-combination from any Virtual Termial that is running a graphical environment - Gnome, KDE, XFCE or LXDE, these key combinations are simply ignored.  It doesn't matter which VT the graphical environment is running in, the keystrokes are still sent to that great bit-bucket in the sky.\nWhat is happening here - is the X-server somehow eating these keystrokes?  Is there any way I can get X-server not to eat them?\n\nA: Yes, the X server wants the ctrl added to switch VTs.  Hold down ctrl if you are on a VT running X.\n\nA: Not completely sure I understand.

And thus also repeat this whole process over and over again. But the NVIDIA driver is still \"not currently in use\".\nAnyone knowing a next hint to help me further?\n\nA: I found out that the problem is my laptop having a NVIDIA Optimus card, making it impossible to use it and be able to get Unity..\nThough I also found this thread that says that this guy solved it and now has an automatic process called prime-ng bumblebee. But I haven't tried it out yet.\nUpdate: by now there are two (competing) projects: ironhide (from the original author of bumblebee) and Bumblebee-Project (spin-off/continuation of the original bumblebee).\n\nA: It perhaps is a bug but to write an xorg.config file you need to be root i.e. use sudo the nvidia script dosn't always prompt for root password and therefore can't write the file.\nOne way to do this is boot to recovery mode from grub and update nvidia configuration from there.\n", "Q: Free Ubuntu One Mobile?

I also created a table in LibreOffice Writer using the Table tool in Writer an tried to paste the data from the Calc Table into the Writer Table. It created yet the same thing, another Calc Table copy.\nSo how can I grab the content of a 4 column table in Calc and paste it in a 4 column table from Writer.\n\nA: Copy the sample data in Calc.\n\nIf you try to directly paste into your original table all infos will be pasted into the first cell instead of several columns or rows, respectively.\n\nInstead put the cursor in an empty space in the document, e.g. a normal paragraph not a cell in a table.\nIn the Writer menu select Edit -> Paste Special (Ctrl + Shift + V) and then select \"Formatted Text\".\n\nNow you will see your table from Calc pasted into Writer. \n\nIn the next step you can now select this table and copy and paste it into your original table.\n\n\nVoila!\n\nThe advantage of this method is that you don't have to fix the bad formatting of paste special.\n\nA: Can I suggest, in Writer, choose Edit - Paste Special.  Then select \"Formatted Text\".  This will paste the text in a table which you can then format/add borders etc.\n\nA: if you fail to update the table contents by pasting, try pasting the data to somewhere empty on the page first, and the copy it back into the table, which works for me\n\nA: My preferred way to paste (formatted) tables from Calc to Writer is via the HTML editor of LibreOffice. Do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the table from Calc,\n\n*Paste it in the HTML editor,\n\n*Copy again,\n\n*Paste it in writer.\n\n\nYou will have your table pasted as a table (with the right number of columns and rows) and with a good part of formatting conserved.\n\nA: This didn't work for me as it created dozens of tiny separate tables.\nI then found a simple way around it as follows. (I was working with a large spreadsheet table about 50 rows and 10 columns.)\n\n\n*\n\n*In calc select the area reqired and copy it [ctrl - C]\n\n*in writer on a plain bit of the page paste the clipboard as UNformatted text. It  will paste with tabs between the cell data and carrige returns at the ends of the rows\n\n*Select the whole text and use [table] [convert] [text to table] using the default settings\n\n\nWorks like magic\n\nA: I tried all the different options offered by Edit -> Paste Special (Ctrl + Shift + V) and the one that worked best for me was the option of pasting it as HTML.\nThis way it kept all the formatting and colors. It was a complex table with 11 columns and more than 200 rows with cells of different sizes. \nAll formating kept.\nIf it makes any difference I'm using Libreoffice 4.2.6.2. It might work different on earlier versions.\nHope it helps.\n\nA: In LibreOffice version 7 you can do Paste Special > More Options > [and select the image format you need]\n\n\nA: When pasting from Calc into an existing table in Writer, then what worked for me best and quickest was to:\n\n*\n\n*Click somewhere inside your existing table in Writer, in the first column\n\n*Select Edit -> Paste Special -> Paste as rows above\n", "Q: How do I find running programs that are not visible?

If it doesn't, you'll need to edit your GRUB configuration to point to the right partition.\nFirst we want to figure out what partition your Windows installation is on. Do sudo fdisk -l (don't worry, this is a safe operation; it just lists your disks and partitions) and you should see a list of partition entries formatted a bit like this:\n/dev/sda3 * 1 6374 51199123+ 7 HPFS/NTFS\n\nNote the device path of any partitions that are of type \"HPFS/NTFS\" or \"MS-DOS\" or something to that effect. What you'll probably see is a small NTFS partition at the start of the disk and a bigger NTFS partition elsewhere. The smaller one is your recovery partition and the bigger one is your Windows instance proper. Make a note of the device path of the larger one.\nNow we need to know the UUID of that filesystem, which we will give to GRUB to help it find it. Say sudo blkid and find the entry corresponding to the partition you noted above. Note the value in quotes after UUID=.\nNow use the editor of your choice to open /etc/grub.d/40_custom. sudo nano -w /etc/grub.d/40_custom will do nicely. At the end of this file add something like the following:\n   menuentry \"Windows 7\" {\n     insmod part_msdos\n     insmod ntfs\n     set root='(hd0,msdos1)'\n     search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set UUID-GOES-HERE\n     chainloader +1\n  }\n\nTwo things need to be substituted here. Where I've written UUID-GOES-HERE substitute the UUID you noted above (no quotation marks). Where I've written msdos1 substitute 1 with the number of the partition you noted before (sda6 would be msdos6 etc.).\nSave this file and do sudo update-grub, then reboot. Try your new menu entry. Should work.\n\nA: I had the very same problem. I had Windows 7 on my laptop and decided to give Ubuntu a try too. So I made a new partition, allocated 15 gigabyte of my hard disk to it and installed Ubuntu on the new partition. Every thing went smoothly, the installation wizard rebooted the system and GRUB loaded with Ubuntu and Windows 7 on its menu. \nI could load into Windows 7 but when I chose Ubuntu, all I could get was a black screen. I searched the web and tried almost everything I could get but the problem remained. So I decided to format the Ubuntu partition and reinstall Ubuntu. During my search for a solution, I noticed that it is important where to install GRUB. \nOriginally I had chosen to install GRUB on the same partition that Ubuntu was going to be installed (sda8 in my case) and that was the problem. When installing GRUB, it is important to specify a hard disk (and not a partition) for GRUB to be installed on. Specifying a partition instead could lead to trouble. \nSo this time I chose 'sda' for GRUB to be installed on and installed Ubuntu on 'sda8' and that was it. The problem was solved and now I have both Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 on my laptop working smoothly. \n", "Q: Stop an insolent narwhal from \"correcting\" monitor brightness? I want total absolute control over the brightness of my laptop's screen. I want Natty to fear my wrath should it dare to presume my desire. Natty's light adjusting minions should quake in terror before my sword, apt-get purge!\nBut alas, this sword cuts an arm where I'd prefer lobotomy. I need a scalpel, some precise tool to cut into Natty's brain and enforce my will. Does such a tool exist? Is there known to the citizens of Ubuntu a method to restore my sovereign power?\nFurther investigation reveals Natty only auto-dims the screen when running loose on battery power. Chain the beast to an electrical outlet and it is tamed.\nI see these two screens in Natty's Power Management, neither appear relevant:\n\n\n\nA: You write much, and well, but say little :-p\nWhat is your problem you wish to solve, exactly? As far as I know, the gnome power\nmanager is the place that controls the brightness depending on things like are you\nconnected to AC or not. There are also knobs in there for how long to wait before dimming\nthe display, or not at all.\nPress Super and type in \"power\", only one app will show up, there's the extent of the\nbrightness control.\n\nA: @ppetraki's answer, while not fully sufficient, is a boon. If it is Gnome Power Manager that controls such things, then it is Gnome Power Manager that is defective. Revised search terms tell tale of similar woes in Maverick Meerkat. The solution then, as I find now, is hacking Unity with gconftool-2:\ngconftool-2 --set --type boolean  \"/apps/gnome-power-manager/backlight/enable\" false\n\nI'm not fully satisfied with this. Surely I'm not the only one confounded by this behaviour, and surely it would make sense to include such an option in the Power Manager gui. But at least the option exists somewhere, and Natty Narwhal's obnoxious behaviour is restrained.\n\nA: You can also use a utility such as Caffiene to inhibit such behavior (yes,  I know,  not ideal):\nYou can find more info here, or on launchpad.\n", "Q: Weird looking Google Earth I just installed 64-bit Google Earth from .deb file downloaded from the official site.

Thanks. \n\nA: MAybe it is usefull for you to see this previous post:\nWiFi too slow with an Atheros AR928X  \n(I don't know if it is your case (it's usefull if you can post here your wich drivers do you use... or which type of internet conection u use, ethernet or Wlan?)\nfor that you should run on terminal this command:\niwconfig\n\nA: I think I finally found the solution to my problem, only just done it and so far my browser is back to normal, if it changes or deteriorates i will let you know though. \nI identified my driver to be an RT3090 and then found this post: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1749179 I followed it and blacklisted the suggested rt drivers and FINALLY i think it has worked! Browser is back to normal speed instead of taking forever to load!\nThanks very much for everyones help, i hope this works for someone else! Maybe now i can enjoy 11.04! :) \n\nA: I had the same problem too and I'm new to Ubuntu. On Windows I noticed that the IPv6 settings was on automatic but in Ubuntu the IPv6 settings was on ignored.\nI simply changed it to automatic and now the Internet works great on every browser. Hope this helps.\n\nA: There are many factors that can impact your Internet performance. Your ISP's performance can vary. Comcast in Fresno can run slower and slower for a few weeks and then become fast again. I suggest you run http://speedtest.net or another performance site to establish the actual network performance. In my personal experience with Comcast all of my network slowdowns have been ISP related with one exception when my cable modem started to die. Your ISP should be able to test your modem from the network. This isn't to say that your problem can't be perhaps driver related but you can easily verify network operation to get a complete picture of what's going on.\n\nA: It sounds like Remix was using a different and a better driver for your wifi card. See if you can find out which driver and which version the 2 OS's are loading respectively. \nYou can try using lshw -C NETWORK and lsusb to find out this information. This should be at least enough to help you track this down.

I've never tried to recover from such a situation. However, if you've got valuable data on that disk, I strongly recommend making a complete image of the disk before doing anything else. That means you'll need a device with at least as much free space as your disk has. Then do\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/path/to/image.img\n\nThat way, if something goes wrong, you won't lose anything.\n\nIf you don't have enough space on a single partition, you might be able to work around that issue by doing something like this (WARNING: This is untested):\nmkfifo /tmp/dd\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/tmp/dd\n\nThen, in another terminal, try this\nsplit --bytes=4G /tmp/dd /path/to/staging/area # adjust size as appropriate\n\nFinally, in a third terminal, you can quickly move the chunks to their permanent home, optionally compressing them first. Do this while dd runs. But whatever you do, make sure it's fast enough so that you don't run out of space in the staging area.\nTo restore the split files, you can do something like this:\nTerminal 1:\nmkfifo /tmp/dd\ncat /path/to/chunks/dir/1/* /path/to/chunks/dir/2/* > /tmp/dd # List all chunks here\n\nUse zcat instead of cat if you also need to uncompress the chunks.\nTerminal 2:\ndd if=/tmp/dd of=/dev/sda\n\n", "Q: Is Thunderbird still being updated?

First of all this is the proceed that I followed to install it:\n\n\n*\n\n*I deleted system partition (that uses 100Mb and store the boot files) from my HD and I write the boot on my C: where Windows is installed.\n\n*Then I inserted the CD with Ubuntu and I loaded it, then I selected the option that allows you to install with Windows 7, I resized C: partition, and the installation started. \n\n*After all the installation finished, Ubuntu ran well, then I restarted, grub loaded, and I selected Windows 7 Loader or something like that, Windows started to load, it shows the progress bar, and then bam! A BSoD appeared, I restarted and I tried to load Windows again, BSoD again, but another problem appeared, my PC restarts again, but grub doesn't load anymore and my PC starts to reboot and reboot, so I had to force it tu turn off. \n\n*Then I had to repair MBR with Windows DVD, and magically Windows 7 loaded.\nMy question is, how can I fix this because I really want to use Ubuntu 11.04?\n\nA: The System Reserved partition is necessary for windows to boot. The BSOD occured because you deleted the partition ;P\nWhen you ran the windows repair disc, the GRUB bootloader was overwritten. Assuming the System Reserved partition has been restored you should be able to set GRUB back up by following these steps:\nsteps taken from raheals solution to this question.\n1.boot from Ubuntu live cd (same one you used to install ubuntu with). Select \"Try Ubuntu\".\n2.In a terminal (Accessories > Terminal) run fdisk -l and see which is your linux partition say /dev/sda2\n3.mount the partition to say /mnt using mount /dev/sda2 /mnt\n4.now the magic command run the following from anywhere\n5.grub-install --root-partition=/mnt /dev/sda you will get the message \"no error reported\"\n6.reboot\n7.enjoy!\n", "Q: How can I specify the order in which filesystems are automatically mounted?

How can I specify the necessary order?\n\nA: Systemd has now included a dependency option that enforces mount ordering. In your case add the fstab arguments:\nx-systemd.requires-mounts-for=/,x-systemd.requires-mounts-for=/home/.hdd\n\nThe noauto option will not work if you need to mount over other mounted file systems. In my case the above worked see commit https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/3519d230c8bafe834b2dac26ace49fcfba139823 for more details.\n\nA: Ubuntu uses mountall at boot time, not mount -a.  Mountall waits for the underlying devices to appear and then mounts the fs on them immediately, unless the fs it is being mounted under has not yet been mounted, then it waits for that fs.\nYou should be able to get the order you want by setting the mount points of the 3 filesystems so they are stacked one under the other.  Instead of mounting all three in /home/.something, put the first one in /home/.x, and the second one in /home/.x/.y, and the third in /home/.x/.y/.z.\n\nA: I might consider setting up a script that mounts the second disks after the mount script has been called. In Ubuntu initd is the service that starts up all the componets of you operating system, and it is called upstart. \nIt is event based, meaning it looks / waits and emits events during the boot up process. As this post pointed out the initd service try to do things in parallel, which is probably what is causing your problems. So you could set your script to run straight after mount has finished and completed it processes.\nThe mount scripts are kept in the /etc/init/ directory. I would add your additional mount script there as well. Look at this description of the start up process. That site will probably help you get stared with your own script the fastest.\nYou need to have a start on section in your own script. See this section for starting a job after an other has finished.\nI am still looking at how to create my own start up scripts my self, so I cant be any more helpful. If you do find a working solution please post it back here.\n\nA: One option is to postpone mounting until after /etc/fstab has completed, this gives you full control over the mount order.\nJust add noauto to the mount options in fstab, and mount in rc.local.\nAccording to the man page, mount -a mounts the entries in fstab sequentially, while adding the -F ('fork') option will mount them in parallell. It appears that the standard boot is using 'fork', presumably to reduce boot time, so I guess mounting (semi-)manually afterwards is the simplest way to regain control of the mount order.\n\nA: According to man fstab, the showthrough option might be what you're looking for. Try setting it on /home/ak and seeing if it works.\nIt's possible that mount forks when mounting filesystems during boot; if so, the order in which your partitions are mounted would be undefined.\n", "Q: Can't drag maximized windows from the panel like i could in the beta While in beta i could just drag the panel (in unity) and the maximized windows would be restored to normal size.

I suggest backing up your ~/.gnome2/keyrings directory and then try removing it to see if that helps. Of course, when you reenter your passwords for Evolution or a wireless network, it will ask you to create a password for your newly created keyring (picture shown below). Make sure that password is the same as your login password.\n\nAlso, if you connect to a wireless network and you log in automatically, make sure you select \"Available to all users\" in your wireless settings.\n\n\nA: Probably whatever agent is supposed to be handling storing that is not running in your session and it can't remember from one minute to the next, so each time a program needs authentication it prompts you again.

Interesting problem you have, if you're telling us everything then Ubuntu somehow\ndestroyed your filesystem during the course of mounting this disk. I find that hard to  believe. It may be that the kernel has failed to discover the disk correctly and determined that the drive has less LBAs than in reality. It's tough to know exactly how much space should be there because you didn't create a partition. TIP in the future, even if you plan to span the entire disk, create a partition. At least then someone can examine the partition table and verify the boundaries.\nEXTFS replicates the superblock several times over, we just need one to reconcile your\npartition.\nhttp://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/Advanced_Find_ext2_ext3_Backup_SuperBlock\nSeems like it should point you in the right direction. I haven't recovered a filesystem\nin a while so I don't have any quick commands for you to run.\nSo your homework is to figure out how to get to your remaining superblocks and use them to reconcile the state of your filesystem.

I'd like to move them to the top of the bar instead of their default at the bottom of it.\nThanks\n\nA: Yes but they need to be within their group and files&folders and applications are 1 group. So you can put files&folders above or below applications. There are a few other launchers that are added to this group like the askubuntu (askububtu.place), google books (books.place) etc.\nBasically we currently have 2 groups (hold the 'super' key while reading this and look at the launchers): digits and letters.

I'm trying to customize an old python script I like a lot, specifically gmail-notifier.  It uses the default mail icon in the messaging menu instead of the gmail icon a lot of similar programs use.  I was wondering how to go about using my own icon.  I've been looking through the code and nothing stands out to me as to what to change for the small icon in the menu, I've only been able to change the pop-up notification icon.  I tried changing the shortcut's icon, but that only gave an error icon in the messaging menu.\nAnyway, I'm stumped... any advice?\n\nA: I've built a small gmail notifier app myself. There should be a piece of code in the python script which goes:\nserver = indicate.indicate_server_ref_default()\nserver.set_desktop_file(\"/usr/share/applications/gmail_notifier.desktop\")\n\nThe .desktop file specified above is the one that determines the icon to be used in the messaging menu. The corresponding \"Icon\" key in my .desktop file looks like this:\nIcon=mail-unread\n\nThe description for the \"Icon\" key, as given in the Desktop Entry Specification, is:\n\nIcon to display in file manager, menus, etc. If the name is an absolute path, the given file will be used. If the name is not an absolute path, the algorithm described in the Icon Theme Specification will be used to locate the icon.\n\nIn my case, the second part of the above description applies (i.e., the algorithm described in the Icon Theme Specification is used to locate the icon corresponding to \"mail-unread\"). You can instead give the absolute path to your icon, as in:\nIcon=/usr/share/icons/...\n\nor you can try the following (it will work only if your icon theme has the icon, which is rare. That is why I'm using the generic icon \"mail-unread\".):\nIcon=gmail\n\nI'm not on my machine right now, but when I do get on it I'll tell you where exactly you can find your desired icon and what its name is. I also have links to (the very few) good resources which describe how to integrate apps with the messaging menu, but again I need to be on my machine for that.\nIf you're interested in the entire code for my app, I've got it on GitHub.\n\nA: There is no easy and clean answer to this question. I looked at the source code of gmail-notifier. There is no way to set an own icon using some configuration file. So you'll either have to change the source code, recompile and reinstall or change the existing icon file. If you choose the 2nd way, you'll find the icon in /usr/share/pixmaps/gnome-gmail-notifier.svg. When you replace this file by some other SVG the icon will change.\n", "Q: How to take daily backup of database?

Backups are made from the whole database, including privileges, and placed in /var/lib/automysqlbackup/. This can be changed in /etc/default/automysqlbackup.\nAbout the versioning part, the repository only grows in size. A better solution might be diffing two backups.

Is there any interactive or more user-friendly version (or substitution) of GDB for debugging?\nSome people suggested CGDB, but after a few tests I found it buggy and unstable.\n\nA: GDB Dashboard\nhttps://github.com/cyrus-and/gdb-dashboard\nGDB dashboard uses the official GDB Python API and prints the information that you want when GDB stops e.g. after a next, like the native display command.\nVs TUI:\n\n\n*\n\n*more robust, as it just prints to stdout instead of putting the shell on a more magic curses state, e.g.:\n\n\n*\n\n*vi mode in .inputrc causes problems: https://superuser.com/questions/180512/how-to-turn-off-gdb-tui/927728#927728\n\n*program stdout / stderr breaks your interface: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26291629/gdb-in-tui-mode-how-to-deal-with-stderrs-interaction-with-the-ui\n\n\n*highly configurable from Python: you can select what you want to output and how big each section is depending on what you are debugging.\nThe most useful views are already implemented: source, assembly, registers, stack, memory, threads, expressions... but it should be easy to extend it with any information that is exposed on the GDB Python API.\nTUI only allows showing two of source, assembly and registers and that is it. Unless you want to modify it's C source code of course ;-)\n\nI believe that GDB should ship with a setup like that out of the box and turned on by default, it would attract much more users that way.\nOh, and the main developer, Andrea Cardaci, has been very responsive and awesome.

For 11.04, I did a fresh install of my system. Part of that install was to install rvm, which sticks a rvm.sh in /etc/profile.d/. This doesn't work as /etc/profile (which loads each +r in /etc/profile.d/*.sh) is not being loaded. According to the documentation, the profile is only sourced if bash is run in login. To verify this, I invoked bash --login, after which rvm was available.\nThis has worked for me in previous versions of Ubuntu without any configuration. That is, a fresh install of 10.10 will correctly source profile/.d.\nMy question is: is there anything I'm doing wrong, or are there some new assumptions being made in Natty that have broken this? My current workaround is to source /etc/profile in ~/.bashrc (which is awful as profile is meant to load before bashrc's, but does the trick).\n\nA: There is, however, a file /etc/bash.bashrc  that is read by gnome-terminal and is the \"system-wide .bashrc file for interactive bash(1) shells.\"  \nMy call to the rvm function, [[ -s \"$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm\" ]] && . \"$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm\" , went in there, and works just fine for the couple of users on that system.\n\nA: Per default, gnome-terminal does not start bash as a login shell (I assume you mean bash started inside a gnome-terminal). That means bash will not read /etc/profile or ~/.profile. As you have correctly observed, bash will read those files if started as a login shell.\nThe quick fix to your problem is to configure gnome-terminal to start bash as a login shell so it will read /etc/profile. To do so click on the Edit menu of gnome terminal, then \"Profile Preferences\", then enable \"Run Command as a login shell\".\nI do not recommend doing this because it messes up the distinction between ~/.profile and ~/.bashrc.\nIdeally ~/.bashrc should do setup for bash, typically required everytime bash is started. While ~/.profile should do stuff which is not bash and required only once, during login.\nFor more information read this question and answer at superuser talking about the difference between bashrc and profile.\nFrom your problem description it seems that the rvm script needs to be loaded only once, during login. As far as I know Ubuntu has configured the graphical login to read /etc/profile/ and ~/.profile. That means, after logging out and a logging in once, the rvm script should be active.\nIf it still doesn't work, then perhaps the rvm script needs to be loaded for every bash session. If that is the case then bashrc is the more appropriate place for the script.\n\nA: Installing RVM as multiuser requires the user to run this command:\n(because Ubuntu does not source /etc/profile.d at the login)\necho '[[ -s \"/etc/profile.d/rvm.sh\" ]] && . \"/etc/profile.d/rvm.sh\" # Load RVM function' >> ~/.bashrc\n\n\nA: if you have ZSH or OH-MY-ZSH, your profile is /etc/zprofile\n\nA: I have actually found for those who do not like to fully restart their boxes unless it is absolutely required the following...\nYou do not need to restart the whole machine to have changes to /etc/profile take effect.  All you need is to have your XWindows Desktop GUI restart so it re-reads configs (as it would if it were to be started as part of a system-wide restart).\nFor me I use xUbuntu which uses LightDM but you can sub in whatever executable calls your current desktop.\nFirst, you can not use a terminal emulator from inside the desktop GUI itself to do this (at least not with LightDM) you need to either use SSH or a secondary console (if you hold Ctrl + Alt and hit an F Key or number key you should drop away from your graphical desktop login or screen to a plain terminal window).  I also suggest you close out any remote desktop stuff like VNC if you are using SSH (obviously SSH can be connected you just do not want an open VNC window to be polling display 0 while it is trying to restart as this may hang the restart while it waits for you to terminate the VNC session).\nI do this all the time with SSH and it is a big lifesaver especially when you are not physically by your machine and do not feel like waiting for a full restart and reconnecting :-D\nNow the easy part once in a \"secondary\" terminal or SSH issue:\n(Yes, this will kill your current session, be sure you do not mind, save any open documents or work)\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\nwait a minute as it kills the desktop and then starts it again (this can take a few good seconds as things are stopped and then executed again on start)\nThat's it, now when you head back to either console 0  or you go to to use VNC to connect again you will be greeted by the login prompt and login as normal and if you open a terminal emulator and go to issue your command you should now have no problems as everything was re-sourced just as if you did a full machine restart.\nJust remember, if you issue sudo service lightdm restart [or stop, start, whatever] from within the desktop environment itself using a terminal emulator the command will just hang there and nothing will seem to be happening.  This is because you are currently using that console (aka display) 0 and so it can not fully go down and come back up as it is waiting for the desktop to not be in use before it runs the command.\nLast Note: I have not tried to issue restart on the environment from within the desktop in a terminal emulator and then switch to another console that may then restart it, but if you are already going to switch the console then why not just run the command from there as it should be anyways?\n\nA: echo \". .profile\" >> ~/.bashrc \nAnd then open another window.

But is the kernel bugs reported on Launchpad receive attention from the developers? It is important since, in this case, it was reported not to be distro-specific.\nThe bug in question is Kernel 2.6.38-7 completely dims screen on Intel GMA 4500M. Please note that this is the very first bug I've reported, and as such I don't know any of the usual values and convention/format of the data that I can conform to.\n\nA: So, in the example you've supplied, the bug is filed against the kernel package for the Ubuntu operating system. You can tell this by looking at the package listed under the 'Affects' block. In this case, it is linux(ubuntu) so it is distro specific.\nDepending on how it is filed, a bug may not get the attention it needs. If it was filed against the 'Linux' project, then it is important to note that this is used as an upstream bug tracker for bugs against related distributions.\nIf this bug was something that you wanted to be addressed by upstream Linux maintainers, then really the only thing you can do is file it on bugzilla.kernel.org. The site being the bugtracker that Linus and the maintainers use to address kernel issues. \nIn this case, the Kernel Defect Analyst(me :-) ) would triage your bug and bring it to the attention of the Kernel Release Manager. S/He would then determine whether it needed an Engineer's involvement (this is somewhat ambiguous as the KRM is an Engineer in his/her own right so it may be worked by them as well). At that time it will be acted upon. \nIt is important to note that not all bugs get actively worked. In the vast majority of cases bugs are left alone if there is work ongoing upstream. If you are aware of the bug upstream, then filing a bug against Ubuntu in launchpad is an important way for us to track the issues as they progress in the upstream kernel. This would be accomplished by adding that upstream watch I mentioned earlier.\nHope that helps you a bit.

I did that years ago when a theme I otherwise liked didn't have enough contrast.\nThemes installed system-wide live in /usr/share/themes, while your own themes live in ~/.themes.

Primary\n2. Extended\n3. Logical\nThere can only be 4 primary partitions on a hard drive. When one wants to create more than 4 partitions, an extended partition is created and then more logical partitions are created inside the extended partition. So extended partition is like a container which contains logical partitions in it. For more on partitions go to http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/file/structPartitions-c.html\nIn your HDs configuration sda1 is a primary partition, sda2 is just an extended partition and sda5 is a logical partition which is inside sda2 and occupies all the space of sda2. You can see that sda2 and sda5 have exactly the same space. So basically there are just 2 useable partitions i.e sda1 and sda5.\nSda5 is linux swap space. In linux, a partition is reserved as swap space. Swap space is used to extend your ram using some space on your hard disk. So if you have just 64 MB ram and you are able to run binaries or programs larger than 64 MB, it is because your some space on your HD is being used to extend your ram. When some part of program is not being use at the moment it is swapped out of ram in to the swap space. When program needs that part, it is swaped back in to the ram. If you want to know more you can google for virtual memory and you will find a lot of info about it.\nDO NOT delete these partitions as Linux needs swap space to run. \n\nA: sda1 is usually where your files and linux operating system files are kept. (dev/sda1)\nI'm not entirely sure what the Extended is for, I think this mounts as a separate drive... which on Ubuntu will say 11.72GB File system.\nYour sda5 (dev/sda5) is your linux swap. The swap is used when sda1 is full and the system needs to write something temporary to disk. A Linux swap isn't really needed, it just helps when your HDD is full.\n", "Q: The chrome around my windows appears to have disappeared. Any ideas why?

For example, an ATI X1200 is an R400 series graphics card, which is supported with the open-source (ATI) driver.\nTo find what series is your AMD/ATI card, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_AMD_graphics_processing_units\nThere is intensive work on X.Org, such as modesetting, TV-Out, HDMI Audio. So, things may not work well due to a bug. So, an Ubuntu user should be able to know with Radeon Series their card is, and which driver they are currently using, when reporting problems.\n\nA: I think the best place to check the compatibility of a component with ubuntu is...\nThe Ubuntu Website ;) in fact there's a part of this site where you can find the detail of compatibility per component : http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/catalog\nIn your case check here :\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/certification/catalog/category/VIDEO\nYou'll find all the video card compatible with Ubuntu.\nElse you can check on Linux Hardware Compatibility List Website\nI hope It could help\n", "Q: Logitech USB Headset not working When I plug my USB headset in, it does not appear as hardware device within the sound preferences.

I didn't need to install anything to get the wireless connection going. The only important part is to setup the connection from the Networking icon on the panel at the top (11.04). When you click it the Edit connection appears. Under Wireless settings you might have to create a new connection, save it and then connect to it. \nYou might also want to try and connect via wire. That will ensure that all the updates get installed and the net is connected. Then you can try connecting in wireless mode.\nAbout 2 : All the codecs that is needed for playing music, video can be installed when 11.04 is installed for the first time. We just need to select and choose the option to install them. Otherwise later also from the repositories (Ubuntu software center) one can install them.\n", "Q: How do I show blueproximity's icon in the panel? I just upgraded to Natty and am getting used to the new interface.  I depend on blue proximity for locking my desktop when I leave my office.  After upgrade I no longer see the icon in the panel area.  I tested and It is working but I have no idea how to configure it now.  How do I get the icon back and configure it?\n\nA: The accepted answer will not work for version 13.04 and newer, because that whitelist was removed from Ubuntu.\nHowever there is a patch for blueproximity to make it work with unity's app indicator.\nYou can apply the patch as follows:\nwget http://sourceforge.net/p/blueproximity/patches/_discuss/thread/3d5eb592/7e50/attachment/proximity.patch\nsudo patch /usr/share/blueproximity/proximity.py < proximity.patch\nsudo apt-get install python-appindicator\n\nThat works in 13.10 and 14.04. Haven't tested other versions. I see no reason why wouldn't work in other versions though. I would also recommend this over the whitelist solution. \nHopefully that patch will be integrated into newer version of blue proximity.\n\nA: Your problem is that the program doesn't show up in the notification area. \nUbuntu natty has a whitelist for only some programs to show up.\nBut there's an easy way to either re-enable the Systray for all applications or to whitelist a few applications you can't live without.\nTo enable the Notification Area (Systray) for all applications, run the following command in a terminal:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist \"['all']\"\n\nYou can only whitelist a certain application if you want, by using the following command:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist \"['JavaEmbeddedFrame', 'Mumble', 'Wine', 'Skype', 'hp-systray', 'YOUR_APPLICATION']\"\n\nThe above command includes the already whitelisted (by default) applications so you should replace \"YOUR_APPLICATION\" with the application you want to whitelist.\nFor blueproximity:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist \"['JavaEmbeddedFrame', 'Mumble', 'Wine', 'Skype', 'hp-systray', 'proximity']\"\n\nIn Ubuntu 13.04 the systray-whitelist hard-coded so the above configuration change no longer works.

Surprise: a small window pops up stating that it's writing to the disk and warning me not to unplug the drive until it's done.   What the heck is there to be written?   I did not create any files, or change any file names, etc. \n\nA: Every time you look at files or directories - access-times are written to the filesystem.\nIt a pretty big deal if you are doing forensics. In those cases you surly want to mount as read-only.\nAlso if access to the fs was previously cut in the middle of an operation (unmounted improperly) then the next time you mount it - a recovery will make modification to the fs to bring it to a consistent state by consulting the journal.\n", "Q: Why does /bin/sh point to /bin/dash and not /bin/bash? As far as I understand bash is the default shell in Ubuntu, so why does /bin/sh point to /bin/dash?\n\nA: The default login shell is still /bin/bash. What was changed was the default system shell /bin/sh.\nThe change of the default system shell started from Ubuntu 6.10, and the main reason to switch was efficiency.\nHere you can find complete information about this change: Dash as /bin/sh \n", "Q: System bar not showing when using the macbuntu theme i think i really need your assistance in this.I've installed ubuntu 10.10 and this mac theme and so far it works fine.

To do this, try typing \"ccsm\" into the launcher.\nThere, you can turn off the cube again. Hope this works for you.\nedit: If you can open the settings manager, you may want to turn off the Unity-Plugin, and then on again.\nIf you can't use Alt+F2, maybe you can log into a different session (Ubuntu Classic (no effects)) at login and correct it like this.\n", "Q: Why is /lib/libc.so.6 missing? find | grep libc.so.6\n\nreveals that it's in /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6, but a script I was running expected it to be directly under /lib, so why isn't there at least a symlink?\nWould I risk breaking anything if I put a symlink there?\n\nA: Just add symlink to the libc.so.6 file as following:\nsudo ln -s /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 /lib/libc.so.6\n\nThe same goes for other missing files still on the system, in my case Matlab was missing the file, the problem is gone now.\n\nA: libc.so was moved as part of the multiarch work in Ubuntu 11.04.  The reason that there can't be a symlink there is that the purpose of multiarch is to make it possible to install both the i386 and amd64 versions of libc at the same time so that you can run 32-bit binaries more easily on 64-bit systems and vice versa (and other similar situations).  If the libc6 package contained a symlink to the new location, then the versions of that package for different architectures wouldn't both be installable at the same time (which version of the symlink would dpkg pick?), defeating the entire point of the exercise.\nAnything that hardcodes the path to libc.so must be updated to work properly from Ubuntu 11.04 onwards.  If the script you're talking about is part of Ubuntu, please report a bug on it and add the multiarch tag.\n\nA: Dynamic libraries are loaded by the kernel, the paths are not hardcoded in a program. A program just says \"I need libc.so.6\". The system then searches in library paths as defined in /etc/ld.so.conf, including /usr/lib and /lib by default. This file includes additional configuration files in /etc/ld.so.conf.d.\nOn my 64 bits system, libc.so.6 can be found in /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 because of the path defined in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/x86_64-linux-gnu.conf:\n# Multiarch support\n/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu\n\nTo find out what library is loaded by a program, use ldd as in ldd /bin/bash:\n    linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffff1dff000)\n    libncurses.so.5 => /lib/libncurses.so.5 (0x00007f9d8b3b8000)\n    libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f9d8b1b4000)\n    libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f9d8ae1f000)\n    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f9d8b61c000)\n\nPutting the symlink would not break anything.\nTo get a list of directories that are searched, run:\nldconfig -v -N | grep '^/'\n\n-v causes a list of file + directories to be shown, -N prevents the cache (/etc/ld.so.cache) from being recreated.\n", "Q: How do I show IBus indicator? How to show IBus indicator in Ubuntu 11.04? It disappears.\n\nA: If you are using Ubuntu 10.10 or 11.04, the notification area has been disabled by default. This was made to favor Ubuntu indicators. There is a tutorial showing how to enable the notification area back on WebUpd8.org.\nNonetheless, if you use Ubuntu 11.10 or upper, then there is a new feature that is able to convert many of the notification icons into neat indicators. This is automatic. So iBus in Ubuntu 11.10 appears normally in the upper bar of your desktop.\n\n\nA: I had the same problem, and this might help you. On my pc the ibus icon (little keyboard) is at the bottom right corner of my screen ant not in the tray anymore. It's very hard to see because it's transparent.

I'm using a combination of aufs and a read only root to ensure that my root fs doesn't get corrupt. However, I want to be able to store logs, so I'm making a special rw partition for /var/log. The device is going to undergo hundreds of power failure events.\nIn the event that the partition gets corrupted due to power failure, I want the system to work properly anyway. I'd like the partition to automatically get reformatted in case of corruption. Is there an easy way to configure this?\n\nA: Run fsck with a set of options that specify no user interaction. Test its return value to see whether it could repair the filesystem: the return value will be 0 if there were no errors, 1 if there were correctable errors, and a larger value if something bad happened. For example, with ext[234], run e2fsck -p.\ne2fsck -p /dev/disk/by-label/logs\nif [ $? -ge 1 ]; then\n  mke2fs -L logs /dev/disk/by-label/logs\nfi\n\nIf your running environment permits it, consider logging through the network instead (you need IP connectivity). Even Busybox can do it:\nsyslogd -R logserver\nklogd\n\nOn the log server, listen on UDP port 514.

This morning I upgraded VBox to the latest 4.0.6; 10.10 still worked just fine. The I did an online upgrade to 11.04 and now the Ubuntu VM will not come up. It just sticks at the Ubuntu screen with a row of dots and that is it.\nHow can I troubleshoot this so I can get it to boot. I really don't want to have to do a clean install if I can avoid it.\nThanks.\n\nA: Much simpler/less time-consuming solution:\nI solved the problem by getting into the console mode (Ctrl-Alt-F1) and logging into Ubuntu from that console, then I manually created a mount point for the cdrom and mounted the Guest Additions cdrom, and finally did run the Guest additions script. That solved the problem.\nsudo mkdir /media/cdrom\nsudo mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom/\nsudo /media/cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\nSo, it might be advisable to uninstall Guest Additions before the upgrade from 10.10 to 11.04, as the old version might prevent the upgraded system to boot properly into desktop.\n\nA: First you should try to start Ubuntu in recovery mode or with a previous kernel by selecting from the Grub menu (appears when holding down Shift while booting). We can also run a maintenance shell where we could remove unwanted applications or update Guest Additions to the current version (in case this was not done already).\nIt may also help booting to disable 3D acceleration in the display properties from Virtual Box Manager.\nIn case you are still unable to start your virtual machine after an upgrade you may consider to go back to the snapshot before you upgraded or to restore your backup from the virtual machine before having performed the upgrade to 11.04. \nIn addition to an online upgrade we now have the additional option to upgrade an existing system by using the installation CD-ROM image. After choosing Install Ubuntu you will have the option to upgrade your system by keeping your personal data and system settings:\n\nA similar option will also be available when booting your upgraded Ubuntu 11.04 from the installation CD-ROM image of 11.04.

It is a great idea that is really useful and help many to simplify their workflow.\nMy question is: will these quick-lists be included (and of course improved) by default in Ubuntu Oneiric? By improved I mean adding a dynamic quick-list for the home folder icon in the launcher, for example (the one that changes  every time you change your bookmarks in nautilus).\n\nA: One way to help with this is to file a wishlist bug on the component that you want a static quicklist for and include the .desktop file. Then tag the bug with quicklist so we can keep track of the bugs.\nWe're tracking the status of these bugs on this page.\nFor programs that might not live in Launchpad a friendly wishlist request in their bug tracker with the snippet from the .desktop file could work.\nHowever I only recommend doing that for the \"long tail\" of little programs that people are using. Large programs that we ship by default, like Nautilus and Firefox, will need support for dynamic playlists instead.\nSo for example we can't just ship a .desktop for Nautilus with the handy shortcuts. We need Nautilus to support any shortcut the user defines in the program so that it's always showing the user's favorites, even if the change them. For browsers they'll need to do like \"the last X websites\" or \"last X tabs you closed\" or whatever their design criteria is.\nHowever for most little tools a static quicklist can be a nice little bit of Unity integration so contacting app authors and showing them the work you've done would be quite useful.\n", "Q: Installed gmate but themes and plugins now showing up in gedit I am installing gmate on Ubuntu 11.04 (Gnome 3):\nsudo apt-get install gedit-gmate\n\nBut gedit is untouched (there should appear new themes and plugins).\n\nA: Those plugins don't work with GNOME 3.

By not formatting the partition /home and just mounting it during installation you are basically saving all your settings: bookmarks, passwords for websites, local changes, launcher you changed and stored in your home, high scores of games etc etc.\nAny settings used for the old version that conflicts with the new version should(!) be dealt with by the installer and the new installation.  \nThe only cave-at is that programs that are removed from the default install (like rhythmbox got changed for Banshee) also keeps their settings.

You can do it like this:\ncat test |while read line; do \n  echo \"${line}\"\ndone\n\nInstead of echo \"${line}\" you can, for example, do ./test1.sh ${line}.tif ${line}.tiw\n\nA: I suggest you have a look at\nsed # to manipulate text output from, for instance, ls\n\nand \nxargs # to use some std input to generate (many) new command lines\n\nin combination with piping the output of one command into the input of the next (like from ls to sed to xargs)\nTo wit, say, you have a directory with *tif and *tfw file. You want to do something to the tif files using the corresponding tfw file. Let's also assume for every tif file there is a tfw file of the exact same name\n# list all those tif files in one long column\nls -1 *.tif \n\n# chop of the end .*tif leaving you with the base name\nls *.tif | sed -s 's/\\.tif$//'\n\n# feed the previous into xargs to tag a tif with the info in a tfw and\n# create new geo_*.tif file\nls *.tif | sed -s 's/\\.tif$//' | xargs -i -t geotifcp -e {}.tfw {}.tif geo_{}.tif\n\nThe latter line might pretty much do what you need in one long (difficult to read) commandline without scripting.\nTo aid understanding you can also first create the file list as you did:\nls *tif> output.list\n\nThen clean it up with sed to make sure it behaves well.\nsed -s 's/\\.tif$//' output.list > clean_output.list\n\nend then use xargs with option -p instead of -t to get a prompt before the issuance of each command:\ncat clean_output.list | xargs -i -p geotifcp -e {}.tfw {}.tif geo_{}.tif\n\nEDIT:\nA variation on the former is to use more sed less xargs. This is also a bit more 'debuggable'. It does require you to learn a bit about regular expressions (which is well worth the effort).\nEssentially, one can generate the text of your desired command entirely with sed\nsed -s 's/\\(.*\\)\\.tif$/geotifcp -e \\1.tfw \\1.tif geo_\\1.tif/'  output.list > process.sh\n\nI know, regex looks horrible but here is the rough explanation of the content in the single quotes:\n's/A/B/' substitutes A with B\nA in our case is (something).tif (note that we have to escape the brackets)\nThe something is stored in \\1 and gets used to build the geotifcp command (which is B).\n\nA: I tend to do stuff like this using sed or awk to build command lines, then pipe them to a shell.  As a possible example, if you have a file of just the xxxxx_a.tif filenames,\nsed -e 's/\\(.*\\)_.*/geotifcp \\1_a.tif \\1_a.tfw \\1_b.tif/' < list-file.txt\n\nto see if it's generating the commands you're after, then\nsed -e 's/\\(.*\\)_.*/geotifcp \\1_a.tif \\1_a.tfw \\1_b.tif/' < list-file.txt | sh\n\nto run them all.\nAn input line of asdfasdfsadf_a.tif results in geotifcp asdfasdfsadf_a.tif asdfasdfsadf_a.tfw asdfasdfsadf_b.tif, assuming that the input filenames are [filename]_a.tif and [filename]_a.tiw and the output name [filename]_b.tif.\n", "Q: Wubi.exe won’t start I'm currently using Win7 64bit.

I have \"ubuntu-10.04.2-desktop-i386.iso\" and \"wubi.exe\" in the same folder.\nThanks. \n\nA: The instructions to run Wubi are here.\nSpecifically relating to your question:\nYou are attempting to install a 32bit version of ubuntu into your 64bit O/S.  If this was intentional then\n\nTo modify arguments, right-click Wubi.exe and select \"Create\n  Shortcut\". Then right-click the shortcut, select Properties, and\n  modify the Target line, for example: \"C:\\Documents and\n  Settings\\\\Desktop\\wubi.exe\" --32bit\n\nOtherwise, download the 64bit ubuntu ISO and install via wubi by double clicking the exe.\n\nA: Just Copy wubi.exe\nand the iso file to\nc:\\\nand it will work fine\n\nA: Make sure you have the right version of wubi.exe. For 10.04.2 you get it from http://release.ubuntu.com/lucid\nBut that doesn't explain why 'nothing happened'. Wubi will ignore the wrong iso and download the right version. \nSometimes you can have problems if you have a different version of python installed. You could go to the %temp% directory and remove all py* files and directories. See if that makes a difference.\nWhile you're in the %temp% directory, check for a log file wubi-10.04.2-rev191.log and post that if it exists.\n\nA: I had same problem, fixed it by removing all python instances from PATH and PYTHONPATH.\nTo do that, just press start, write PATH, and you should have entry saying Edit Environment variables or similar, open it, you can delete PATH and PYTHONPATH there (or just modify them temporarily like i did)\nIn my situation i used mint4win, but it happens with all(?) wubi based installers.\n\nA: If I were you I would download the wubi executable from ubuntu website and then try that. For a good internet speed, you are looking at max 60secs. and you're ready to roll. The reason for this - is because if you manage to fire the wubi.exe you currently have, it would still connect and pull the download files from the web.

I have reinstalled ccsm, but they are still not there.  \nI have tried unity --reset which I thought would help but it says that unity is not there.  I an ccsm in unity and I couldn't even turn on and off unity.  Why is it doing this and how can I stop it?  I know the shortcut keys for terminal and ccsm in ubuntu so I can adapt from there and in the GNOME classic side.  I have had lots of trouble with Natty and kind of don't like it.  I tried to uninstall ccsm for some more hard drive space not knowing that it was so closely attached to the OS.  I reinstalled it I think I deleted some crucial part of unity that control the panels.  I now need to install unity.  I tried install unity which didn't work and I need some command.\n\nA: Unity Panel depends on having Compiz. The following options for Unity are needed:\n\n\n*\n\n*OpenGL\n\n*Composite\n\n*Desktop Wall\n\n\nYou could logout and login again but remember to have compiz and those options activated for Unity Panel.\nSince Unity Panel NEEDS Desktop Wall to do the hide/show effect, you can not activate the Cube, that is, the Rotating Cube Effect and the Desktop Cube since they disable the Desktop Wall, hence disabling Unity Panel, hence destroying the world (Of Unity) as we know it.

Likely it has to be some lower level thing, but what (if at all possible)?\nPS: I'm using Ubuntu 11.04 64 bit\n\nA: When the computer suspends, Ubuntu is no longer running until you resume, so there is no way for Ubuntu to set a keyboard shortcut that will work while the computer is suspended. \nMany PC's have an option in the BIOS to trigger a resume from suspend if any key is pressed. That may be your best bet, combined with setting a specific shortcut inside Ubuntu for suspending.\n", "Q: How does GDM configuration work? There are at least two ways to configure GDM I know of:\n\n\n*\n\n*is the /etc/gdm/custom.conf file that can be either hand edited or edited throu GUI gdmsetup.

GDM refuses to let me autologin (on a fresh Natty install) (it does not ask for password, it merely wants that I select myself as a user at the login screen even though I am the only user on this computer).\nOther interesting thing is that even if I purge GDM, its settings (including the custom.conf) do not change.

I can't give you an exact answer since apparently cclive is broken on Maverick. At any rate, I only get errors when I try to use it.\nThe first thing you need to do is to get cclive to print a percentage somewhere. I'm assuming the logfile will print such a percentage, but I can't test it. Then, you need to parse that output and send it to zenity. Here's an example (untested, or course) script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nurl=\"$1\"\ntmp=\"/tmp/cclive.log\"\n\nmkfifo \"$tmp\"\ncclive --background --logfile=\"$tmp\" \"$url\"\negrep '[0-9]+%$' < \"$tmp\" | zenity --progress\nrm \"$tmp\"\n\nIf cclive's output is in a different format, just adjust the script as appropriate. If cclive doesn't dump percentages to the logfile, try changing the cclive command to:\ncclive \"$url\" > \"$tmp\" &\n\nOne final thing: You probably shouldn't send stderr out stdout (2>&1). Zenity will consume stdout, but you probably don't want it to eat all error messages.\nEdit 2\nYou might have to throw awk in somewhere in the pipeline so you can isolate the percentage. The basic syntax is:\nawk '{print $1}' # change $1 to the correct space-separated field\n\nIn testing, I couldn't make it work correctly, but since I can't make cclive work, I can't really troubleshoot it.\n", "Q: Dansguardian Out of Date?

MinD web filter http://code.google.com/p/mindwebfilter/ seems promising, but a little on the unstable side. I am looking for a web filter that can handle at least 300 or so users in a school.

There have been no commits for years.\nThe current DansGuardian fork is called \"e2guardian\".  It's maintained by a different development team, and is still being actively maintained.

Now that unity has the bar on the left side of the screen, I find that it ends up obscuring desktop icons since desktop icons auto align top-bottom/left-right.

Please run in a terminal:\n/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p\n\nand post the output to get a better diagnosis. I assume your video card is relatively new, so the problem is most likely driver-related.\nAlternatively, you could force Unity 3D by adding\nUNITY_FORCE_START=1\n\nto your /etc/environment file, which will bypass support check and start Unity anyways.

For example, to render:\nwhile (head == tail) { head++; a[head] = 0 }\n\ninto\nwhile (head == tail)\n{\n    head++;\n    a[head] = 0\n}\n\n\nA: (Firstly, you need a semicolon before the last } in order for this to be valid C; the semicolon should be thought of as terminating statements in C, rather than as separating statements.  Smart automatic indentation may not work properly unless you add that semicolon.)\nVim's = command (:help =) can be used to run code through an automatic indentation program, though it requires some configuration.  The basic idea is that you set the equalprg option (:help 'equalprg') to a program that applies the indentation you want, and then use = in command mode to run it.  = works like other Vim motion-based commands such as d and y; for example, == indents the current line, =ap indents a paragraph, or you can use a visual range: ggVG= indents the whole file.\nNow, by default, equalprg is set to the empty string, which only does basic per-line indentation built into Vim.  To do the kind of thing you're asking for, the best tool for the job is indent:\nindent \nindent has a vast array of options for various indentation styles; by default it uses the GNU coding style, but you'll probably want to customise it to suit your project's preferences.  See\nman indent for details.  To include spaces in the value of equalprg, you need to quote them with a backslash, so for example if you wanted to use K&R indentation style you would use :set equalprg=indent\\ -kr.\nYou can also have the '=' command choose the appropriate indentation based on the file type, by using :filetype indent on - type :help filetype within vim for more info.\n:set autoindent will tell vim to indent as you type. Adding either of these commands (minus the leading ':') to your ~/.vimrc file will make them permanent.\n\nA: This vim plugin uses external formatters to format code within vim. It's therefore stronger than vim's indentation machinery.\nvim-autoformat on GitHub\n\nA: Like any other text editor, VIM doesn't do that automatically.\nOpen a file with vim, press i for insert, and now you can edit freely, when done press Esc to exit insert mode and then to close and save the document write :wq for write, quit.\n", "Q: Higher resolutions unavailable with 2.6.38-8 kernel After upgrading to Natty and the 2.6.38-8 kernel I could no longer obtain the 1920x1080 resolution available in Maverick with 2.6.35-22. In fact the boot occasionally hung. However, after selecting the remaining 2.6.35-22 kernel, the high resolution was available. \nI then made the mistake of completely reinstalling, but could never get the higher resolutions with 2.6.38-8, no matter what I did. e.g. trying the nvidia proprietary driver, creating an xorg.conf. Even from the command line using\nxrandr --newmode \"1920x1080_60.00\"  173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync\n\nxrandr --addmode DVI-I-1 1920x1080_60.00\n\nxrandr --output DVI-I-1 --mode 1920x1080_60.00\n\nall I would get would be a blank screen and the monitor reporting no input. (Low resolutions displayed fine with xrandr.) I could actually add the 1920x1080 to the already existing probe-reported resolutions in the pool of available resolutions, but choosing it would give the blank screen.  In the end I installed the 2.6.35-22 kernel again. The high resolution is back.\nFor a while there, staying up all night and trying many things, I thought that a new video board or monitor might be needed, but deep down, I knew that they were both OK.\nMy question is - \"Is this some bug involving the latest kernel, that will go away, or if this persists in future kernels, is there a way to make sure that I can keep my native resolution?\"\n\nA: No guarantees, but you might try installing the latest kernel from the Kernel PPA; I have an Intel video system, but that fixed several problems I had.

Every time I launch a program, say firefox, it starts maximized, how can I keep this from happening. Its so ridiculous that they have this as the default.\n\nA: To fix this with Unity 2d, do this on the command line:\ngconftool -s /apps/metacity/general/auto_maximize_windows -t bool false\n\nOr, launch gconf-editor and change that key to false.\nThis annoyed the heck out of me, too. :( The fix is different for unity 2d than for 3d unity, \n\nA: Unity was designed to auto-maximize windows if they take up a certain amount of screen space.

This will disable snapping to the edges of the screen and maximize when you reach the corners.\nFurther you can decide whether to start windows centered, smart-positioned or if they should always be maximized etc. in \"Place Windows\" which is also under \"Window Management\"\n\nA: Just to flag up that the auto-maximize percentage is now configurable in 11.10 in ccsm (the CompizConfig Settings Manager). Idiotically, it's hard-coded in 11.04 despite there having been issues with what the percentage should be early on (originally it was 60%, people complained, and the answer was to change the value rather than do the obvious thing of making it configurable as this is clearly going to be user- and system-specific).

The hardest thing I face now is tweaking it so that it works as nicely as possible.  On the face of it, customisation is very limited.\nsuper+f -> filter to show documents.  Hmmm.  The most common document format I use after .txt files is .lyx files.  They really are documents.  They look a bit unhappy down in the 'other' category.  Is there any way to change this?\nWhat I would really like is to make documents the default, because 'recent' gets completely filled up with photos.  \n\nA: In 11.10 you can filter your results to suit the file type you are looking for.\nOpen the Dash and select the Find Files tab.\n\nYou can then select the filter results drop down arrow and then highlight the Documents tab, in the search field you can type the file extension for the type of document you are looking for.\n\nYou can further filter by last modified.\nThis also works for Audio, Images, Video's etc.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu One on *ubuntu What packages do I require to install Ubuntu One on Ubuntu with other DEs?

Restarting Compiz or Unity fixes this; I usually do Alt+F2 unity Enter.\nVGA hotplug detection works for me in 11.04 (it didn't in 10.10 or earlier versions), so it's enough for me to plug in a monitor and wait about a second for it to be autoconfigured.

Some people tell me that something is loose inside and\nit may crash my commputer at any moment.\nI need help!\nThanks.\nLauren\n\nA: That's most likely a broken fan, they have the tendency to break the most, cause a lot of noise and are among the only components that can break, but still have your computer working.\nSo open up your computer, switch it on and listen where the noise comes from. Also just look at all the fans, most likely you can tell already visually that they aren't running smoothly.\nHow to replace the fan depends on what type of CPU socket you have and which of the fans is broken, i.e. a case fan would be easier to replace then a CPU fan, while a powersupply fan requires a completely new powersupply, if its a HDD fan, you could probably just unplug it without any issue.\nCost shouldn't be that much of an issue, somewhere in the $5-$30.\n", "Q: Make a Launcher for a Privileged Terminal Command I want to make a Launcher that will do privileged (requires root) commands, but I don't want to see the terminal or have to type my password into the terminal.

But that did not work for me.\n\nA: You can tune your screensavers via xscreensaver but still use gnome-screensaver daemon to run them. gnome-screensaver has no way to tune screensavers due to its author's religious inclinations. I have never seen much trouble replacing it with xscreensaver, except for screen locking.

Chroot command may help to use dpkg or apt-get, though I don't think many people did it.\nIf you want to make a machine, where you don't need root passwd at all, you should use sudo extensively. Sudo can be tuned to allow only given commands with given parameters passwordless. \n\nA: I would not advise doing it but you can do it by installing from source code I have found. ie you have to download the source code and build it yourself. However you would have to have all the build essential tools installed first. \nThen when you download the source code you could create an apps dir in your home directory and build from source in there.\nIn general:\n./configure --prefix=/home/user/apps\nmake\nmake install\nThen add /home/user/apps/bin to your path in your bashrc.\nAgain I cannot advise this.

Saves messing your pc up.\n\nA: Use a virtual machine. That will solve all of your problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Each user can have their own VM which they have root access to.\n\n*Since the VM is completely isolated from the host, you don't have to worry about anything getting messed up on host.\n\n*Most virtualization programs do not require root privileges to launch a VM.\n\n", "Q: Small issues after installing Gnome 3 (via PPA) After considering all the risks of using GNOME 3 in Ubuntu 11.04, I installed GNOME 3 via PPA.

You have 2 options:\n1) Live with those minor issues for a few more months, then move to Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric where you'll have stock GNOME3 + Shell as an option.\n2) Change to another distro such as Fedora until Oneiric is ready with its thing.\nBTW, why is notify-osd coming up? In my case the GNOME shell notifications come with Evolutions. Are you sure the notifications are notify-osd ones? Do they come at the top right or bottom right?\n\nA: You can install Evolution 3.0 by two methods\n\n\n*\n\n*By converting fedora 15 evolution3.0 rpm packages using alien.\n\n*By adding the debian experimental repository \ndeb http://ftp.debian.org/debian experimental main\nAs for the other two, its difficult to get as Ubuntu 11.04 is built on top of 2.32.\nI have not compiled Gnome3 from source. Perhaps you could try that and see if it gives better result.\n", "Q: GRUB menu missing after installation I am running windows 7 64 bit on my comp and just installed ubuntu 11.04 64 bit after partitioning the hard drive to give ubuntu 50gb of space. \nI used a usb drive to try it out first and then i installed  it and it worked perfectly and the asked me if i wanted to restart. I allowed it then it asked me to remove any 'installation media' AKA my usb drive and press enter. I did so but next a black screen came up with no text. \nI thought it was part of the installation so i left my comp and came back 15 mins later but it still was at the black screen! I tried typing something, pressing 'esc' and even pressing the power button but nothing happened. Then I pressed the restart button and it restarted  and booted into windows 7 with no trace of grub!!!!what am i supposed to do? I'm only a novice.\n\nA: Are you sure Ubuntu was installed ? If so, then you can recover your grub . \nFollow the procedure as explained on this post.\n\nA: I installed 11.04 over the top of a Win7 installation and upon booting never saw a GRUB menu.  In my case I just had to reinstall GRUB 2 using instructions from here\nBooting into the Ubuntu CD:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nGiving:\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdc1   *           1          13      102400    7  HPFS/NTFS\nPartition 1 does not end on cylinder boundary.\n/dev/sdc2              13       12195    97851877+   7  HPFS/NTFS\n/dev/sdc3           12195       15567    27078657    5  Extended\n/dev/sdc5           12195       14784    20796416   83  Linux\n/dev/sdc6           14785       15567     6281216   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nSo I am working with /dev/sdc5.  If yours is different, substitute throughout the following commands.\nMount it:\nsudo mount /dev/sdc5 /mnt\n\nReinstall GRUB 2.  Note that this command doesn't have a number on the end of the volume's path:\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sdc\n\nUnmount:\nsudo umount /dev/sdc5\n\nReboot:\nsudo reboot\n\nThat was all it took for me.  Read the full instructions to be sure your case is not different.\n\nA: In order to view the GRUB menu in 11.04 do the following in terminal\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nComment the following lines\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=10\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\n\nUncomment this line\nGRUB_GFXMODE=640x480\n\nEnter the default time for grub menu to display\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=10\n\nsave the file and run \nupdate-grub\n\nreboot, you will see the grub menu\n\nA: Use windows7 \"computer administration\", \"local drives\" (I am not familiar with the exact names in w7) to check your partitions - are there partitions for \"/\" and \"swap\" (w7 will not label them - they come as \"undefined\" or \"unknown\").\nIf they are there, restart from your USB Device to run ubuntu and check if you can find files in the ubuntu partitions. If they are there, you might have installed the grub menu on the wrong disk. You might find it useful to check this grub2 help page\n\nA: Do you see a pause when the system is booting, or does it jump straight into Windows?\nI have the same problem by the sounds of it.  If you're seeing a pause during boot though, it may be that Grub just simply can't display properly.  Boot into Ubuntu via the CD ROM that was bundled with it:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nAnd uncomment this line by removing the leading # character:\nGRUB_GFXMODE=640x480\n\nSave the file, exit and reboot.  Does that help?\nIdea taken from here.\n", "Q: Graphics effects not available in 11.04 like in 10.10? I used to like the graphic effects in Maverick. but I cannot find a way to apply graphic effects in Natty unlike Maverick. Were the effects dropped?\n\nA: You are probably referring to the lack of a Desktop Effects tab in gnome-appearance-properties.\nYou still can configure desktop effects using\n compizconfig-settings-manager  in the same way, the only difference will be the fact that enabling Desktop Cube would require some extra steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*What are some of the issues with CCSM and why would I want to avoid it?\nAnother tip: In case something goes wrong with the Compiz settings, you can reset them by running this command:\nunity --replace\n\n\nA: Use in Terminal\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\nccsm\n\nNow configure the settings\n", "Q: Phpunit stop working after upgrade to 11.04 \nI've just upgraded to 11.04 and now phpunit isn't working anymore :( (it was working fine on 10.10).

At the moment I am running Kubuntu Lucid LTS on my desktop and have some relatively free time and was considering upgrading to Natty.\nMy biggest concern (as usual) is whether I will be able to use my video card in the way its configured now, preferably without hours of configuration pain. The pain mainly comes from me having two monitors and a single continuous desktop. One monitor is used in landscape and another in picture mode (rotated 90 degrees clockwise), both having different resolutions.\nI remember spending hours of getting it configured when installing Lucid originally as I had to tweak xorg.conf settings manually dozens of times, randr didn't work, etc. etc. I finally ended up using closed source driver as it was the only one being able to achieve the setup. I also remember my colleague installing Maverick on the next week after the release; he couldn't get it working with closed source nvidia drivers because newer Xorg libs weren't supported (so he had to use Xorg libs from Lucid) and the open source drivers couldn't get the job done. Royal pain stories like this have left me with a very low expectations for Linux on desktop in general and new Ubuntu releases in particular.\nI personally don't care which drivers to use as long as I can get the monitor setup working (no need for any 3D acceleration, it's my working machine). I have spent some time looking at forums/help/AskUbuntu, but I cannot find any decent page confirming whether Natty can achieve my desired setup as the noise/information rate is too high.\nMy video card is (quote from lspci -vvv):\n02:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation G86 [Quadro NVS 290] (rev a1)\n    Subsystem: nVidia Corporation Device 0492\n    Control: I/O+ Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop- ParErr- Stepping- SERR- FastB2B- DisINTx-\n    Status: Cap+ 66MHz- UDF- FastB2B- ParErr- DEVSEL=fast >TAbort- <TAbort- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR- INTx-\n    Latency: 0\n    Interrupt: pin A routed to IRQ 52\n    Region 0: Memory at fa000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16M]\n    Region 1: Memory at d0000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=256M]\n    Region 3: Memory at f8000000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=32M]\n    Region 5: I/O ports at dc80 [size=128]\n    [virtual] Expansion ROM at fbd00000 [disabled] [size=128K]\n    Capabilities: <access denied>\n    Kernel driver in use: nvidia\n    Kernel modules: nvidia-current, nvidiafb, nouveau\n\nSo can anyone advice whether nVidia dual-monitor, rotated-screen, continuous-desktop can be achieved in Natty/Kubuntu?\n\nA: Yes, I'm using 11.04 with nVidia open drivers.

It is a plain text file (and not javascript). More info about pref.js on the mozilla site\n\nA: As Rinzwind already pointed out, the prefs.js file is what changes when you use about:config.  It actually is a javascript file though, but it mostly just calls the user_pref() function many times (for me it’s over 100).\nIf you’re looking to make changes to Firefox configuration though it generally works better to create a user.js file in the same location as prefs.js.  On startup, Firefox first runs prefs.js to load those settings, then runs user.js.  Once you exit, the settings from user.js are also saved in prefs.js.  Firefox doesn’t write to user.js so you won’t lose your settings, and it’ll be easy to manage just a few lines of settings there instead of being mixed in with everything else in prefs.js.\n", "Q: Libraries used by C# executables I am having a problem when I try to run C# executables (compiled with mono C# compiler at 10.10 server) inside a chroot jail.

Is this an bug in the dbus package? If intended, what it the purpose?\nIs it a proper fix to add a symlink myself?  \n(Changing the source is not practical - there are many files, and they need to match what other people have.)\nUpdate:\nOk, I totally misunderstood the situation, though it still comes down to a problem I think should be solved by a symlink.  The dbus directory referred to in the #include statement is a deeper level directory under /usr/include/dbus-1.0/.  The real problem is that the file dbus-arch-deps.h appears to be missing, but is actually stored in the weird location /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dbus-1.0/include/dbus/ . So now, why doesn't Ubuntu provide a symlink to this in /usr/include/dbus-1.0/dbus, or actually store it there?\n\nA: dbus include paths are meant to be retrieved by a call to\npkg-config dbus-1 --cflags\n\nyou can compile a program using dbus by\ncc dbus-example.c -o dbus-example $(pkg-config dbus-1 --cflags)\n\nor\nmake dbus-example CFLAGS+=\"$(pkg-config dbus-1 --cflags)\"\n\ndbus headers are included by the line\n#include <dbus/dbus.h>\n\nthis \"weird include paths\" increase the flexibility towards future versions of dbus or other architectures.\n\nA: don_jones' answer seems to cover how the basic setup that will work. But it's not how it should be, there is a long development history for this.\nWhy? I don't have much background on this, but these what I could think of:\n\n\n*\n\n*About default location or symlink /usr/include/dbus\nThe system is prepared to have multiple versions of the same library which are not compatible. It will be too difficult to debug, if can't know which version is /usr/include/dbus. I'm not talking about single lib, but if all lib used this method. Even with symlinks, then you have find and check all link in the usr/include tree, it is not practical.\nSo the compilation time flags are best approach for this. However, you shouldn't set this flags yourself manually, make a look on the GNU autotools. This is A brief introduction to the GNU Autotools.\n\n*About dbus-arch-deps.h\nYes, it should be stored there in x86_64-linux-gnu path. As the name states, it is an architecture dependent header and you will multiple files with same name for each architecture. Starting from 12.04, Ubuntu became multiarch. (Even before 12.04, you can cross compile, different arch).\nIn precise: libdbus-1-dev:i386 /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/dbus-1.0/include/dbus/dbus-arch-deps.h\nYou don't have to include that header manually but autoconf will take care of that.\nThere is other alternatives, example: cmake. This question is old, but it may open the door for anyone looking for the same thing.\n", "Q: How do I install a .deb file via the command line? How do I install a .deb file via the command line?\n\nA: Are you looking for all dpkg commands? click this link to have a read.\n15 dpkg commands to Manage Debian based Linux Servers\nDPKG commands\nThere are two actions, they are dpkg-query and dpkg-deb. \nInstall a package\n# sudo dpkg -i {package_name}    \n# sudo dpkg -i skype-ubuntu-precise_4.2.0.11-1_i386.deb\n\nRemove a package\n# sudo dpkg -r {package_name}\n# sudo dpkg -r vlc\n\nRemove a package and its configuration files\n# sudo dpkg -P {package_name}\n# sudo dpkg -P vlc\n\nList all installed packages.\nYou can pipe the command to less (a pager) so you can more easily scroll the content:\n# dpkg -l | less\n\nCheck if the package is installed or not\n# dpkg -l {package_name}\n# dpkg -l vlc\n\nCheck if the package is installed or not, and if it is, launch it:\n# dpkg -l | vlc\n\nSee whether a package is installed or not\nAnd this will show the location where the package will be installed.\nHere -S (capital S) to search whether the package was installed or not.\n# sudo dpkg -S {package_name}\n# sudo dpkg -S skype\n\nInstall a *.deb package from a specified location\nHere -R is recursive. (Recursively handle all regular files matching the pattern  *.deb found at specified directories and all of its subdirectories).\n# sudo dpkg -R --install {package_location}\n# sudo dpkg -R --install /home/sysadmin/soft\n\nShow package details\nHere -p (lowercase p) will show the package info:\n# dpkg -p {package_name}\n# dpkg -p apache2\n\nView the content of a package\nUse -c (lowercase c) to show the content:\n# sudo dpkg -c {package_name}\n# sudo dpkg -c skype-ubuntu-precise_4.2.0.11-1_i386.deb\n\nExtract the *.deb package file\nUse -x (lowercase x) to extract:\n# dpkg -x {package_name} {location_were_to_extract}\n# dpkg -x libqt4-phonon_4.6.3-4+squeeze1_i386.deb /home/sysadmin/\n\nExtract and display the filenames contained in a package\nUse -X (uppercase X) to display the content with extraction.\n# dpkg -X {package_name} {location_were_to_extract}\n# dpkg -X libqt4-phonon_4.6.3-4+squeeze1_i386.deb /home/sysadmin/\n\nDisplay information about a package\nHere -I stands for information:\n# dpkg -I {package_name}\n# dpkg -I libqt4-phonon_4.6.3-4+squeeze1_i386.deb\n\nReconfigure an already installed package\ndpkg-reconfigure reconfigures packages after they already have been installed. Pass it the name(s) of a package or packages to reconfigure. It will ask configuration questions, much like when the package was first installed.\n# dpkg-reconfigure postfix\n\nThis will reconfigure postfix the same way as when you installed it for the first time.\nNeed to know more about dpkg commands? Have a look at the manual page:\n# man dpkg\n\n\nA: While dpkg -i indeed installs the package, it doesn't do any automatic dependency resolution. Meanwhile there are two other alternatives, using gdebi or the apt-get tool. To use the latter just use:\nsudo apt-get install /path/to/package.deb\n\nEven if you are on the directory with the package, you need to give a path using ./ at the start:\nsudo apt-get install ./package.deb\n\n\nA: A handy tip when installing a program like Libreoffice which has multiple .deb files in a folder is to use. \nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\n\nA: Debian (.deb) packages are the packages that are used in Ubuntu. You can install any .deb package in your system. .deb files can generally be installed from your file manager (Nautilus) merely by clicking on them, since file associations with the default installer is already set in Ubuntu. These instructions are for those who wish to install packages from the command-line terminal (Terminal).\nTo install a downloaded Debian (Ubuntu) package (.deb): Open Terminal and type\nsudo dpkg -i packagename.deb\n\nTo remove a Debian (Ubuntu) package (.deb): \nsudo dpkg -r packagename\n\nTo Reconfigure/Repair an installed Debian (Ubuntu) package (.deb): \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure packagename\n\n\nA: The gdebi command-line solution\nHere's the best way to install a .deb file on Ubuntu on the command-line:\nsudo gdebi skype.deb\n\nIf you don't have gdebi installed already, install it using sudo apt install gdebi-core.\nWhy gdebi?\ngdebi will look for all the dependencies of the .deb file, and will install them before attempting to install the .deb file. I find this much preferable than sudo dpkg -i skype.deb && sudo apt install -f. The latter is much too eager to remove dependencies in certain situations. For instance, when I tried to install Skype, it attempted to remove 96 (!) packages, including packages like compiz and unity! gdebi gave a much clearer error message:\n$ sudo gdebi skype.deb\nCannot install 'libqtgui:i386'\n\n(Here is the solution to that particular issue, by the way.)\n\nA: Packages are manually installed via the dpkg command (Debian Package Management System). dpkg is the backend to commands like apt-get and aptitude, which in turn are the backend for GUI install apps like the Software Center and Synaptic.\nSomething along the lines of:\ndpkg --> apt-get, aptitude --> Synaptic, Software Center\nBut of course the easiest ways to install a package would be, first, the GUI apps (Synaptic, Software Center, etc..), followed by the terminal commands apt-get and aptitude that add a very nice user friendly approach to the backend dpkg, including but not limited to packaged dependencies, control over what is installed, needs update, not installed, broken packages, etc.. Lastly the dpkg command which is the base for all of them.\nSince dpkg is the base, you can use it to install packaged directly from the command line.\nInstall a package\nsudo dpkg -i DEB_PACKAGE\n\nFor example if the package file is called askubuntu_2.0.deb then you should do sudo dpkg -i askubuntu_2.0.deb. If dpkg reports an error due to dependency problems, you can run sudo apt-get install -f to download the missing dependencies and configure everything. If that reports an error, you'll have to sort out the dependencies yourself by following for example How do I resolve unmet dependencies after adding a PPA?.\nRemove a package\nsudo dpkg -r PACKAGE_NAME\n\nFor example if the package is called askubuntu then you should do sudo dpkg -r askubuntu.\nReconfigure an existing package\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure PACKAGE_NAME\n\nThis is useful when you need to reconfigure something related to said package. Some useful examples it the keyboard-configuration when you want to enable the Ctrl+Alt+Backspace in order to reset the X server, so you would the following:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration\n\nAnother great one is when you need to set the Timezone for a server or your local testing computer, so you use use the tzdata package:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata\n\n\nA: I have literally been waiting for this for years:\nsudo apt install ./happy-at-long-last.deb\n\nYay! :)  This works from APT 1.1 which should be available on most systems by now.\nUsing dpkg has regularly caused problems for me, whereas apt is very good at automatically resolving dependencies and avoiding problems.  And it's still low-level enough to allow scripting and fine-tuning...\n\nA: Create your own script installer debInstaller as the following:\n#!/bin/bash\ndpkg -i \"$@\"\napt-get --yes --fix-broken install\n\nMake the script executable with \nchmod +x debInstaller\n\nThen move it to some dirs in your PATH or add the current directory to your PATH.\nI'm going to move it to /usr/bin\nsudo cp debInstaller /usr/bin\n\nNow you can install any .deb package using the command:\nsudo debInstaller some-package.deb\n\nThe added value of this method is the solving the dependencies problem, since mostly you'll face some problems when you install a .deb  with dpkg -i due to dependencies error, so you have to use apt-get install -f to solve it, this script will do the job for you, but here I used apt-get --yes --fix-broken install to automatically solve these errors without user intervention. \n\nA: My favourite is GDebi, available from both terminal/shell or graphical desktop.\n\nI usually associate .deb files with GDebi as it is fast and efficient - especially compared to Ubuntu Software Center. One of the main feature of GDebi is it resolves dependencies and installs them. \nFor command-line run sudo gdebi <package.deb> to install a single deb file.\n\nA: Installing .deb files can be accomplished using:\nsudo apt install ./<file>.deb\n\nIf you're on an older distribution, you will need to run this instead:\nsudo dpkg -i ./<file>.deb\nsudo apt-get install -f        # Installing missing dependencies\n\n\nAnother approach is by using the gdebi tool to install deb files.\n\nA: There are many tools to install a deb package.\nI personally use a built-in package installer dpkg:\n\n*\n\n*If you are logged as root:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the directory to location of deb package\ndpkg -i package_name.deb\n\n\n\n*If you are not logged as a root:\nsudo dpkg -i package_name.deb\n\nTo make sure that package was installed correctly and didn't have any broken dependencies:\nsudo apt-get check\n\nIf there are any broken dependencies:\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\n\nA: If file is only one, then afaik dpkg -i /path/file.deb is ok and simple (make sure apt user has access to the path, for user home folder it usually does not).\nIn case of several deb files (e.g. one package) sometimes dpkg tries to process them in order where dependencies are not satisfied along the way. In such case clean and simplest way is by copying several deb files together to /var/cache/apt/archives and running sudo apt-get install --assume-yes --no-install-recommends /var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb, that way as I've noticed apt is not trying to download from internet repos as it does if apt-get install /some_other_path/*.deb.\n", "Q: How to remove/ignore most recent kernel?

I'm looking for a good program to show me the differences between two similar pdf files.  In particular, I'm looking for something that doesn't just run diff on an ascii version (with \"pdftotext\") of the files.  This is what pdfdiff.py does.\n\nA: You can use DiffPDF for this. From the description:\n\nDiffPDF is used to compare two PDF\n  files.  By default the comparison is\n  of the text on each pair of pages, but\n  comparing the appearance of pages is\n  also supported (for example, if  a\n  diagram is changed or a paragraph\n  reformatted). It is also possible  to\n  c> ompare particular pages or page\n  ranges. For example, if there are  two\n  versions of a PDF file, one with pages\n  1-12 and the other with  pages 1-13\n  because of an extra page having been\n  added as page 4, they  can be compared\n  by specifying two page ranges, 1-12\n  for the first and 1-3,  5-13 for the\n  second. This will make DiffPDF compare\n  pages in the pairs  (1, 1), (2, 2),\n  (3, 3), (4, 5), (5, 6), and so on, to\n  (12, 13).\n\n\nA: If you have 2-3 huge pdf (or epub or other formats, read below) files to compare , then it is possible to combine the power of:\n\n\n*\n\n*calibre (to convert your source to text)\n\n*meld (to visually search for the differences between the text files)\n\n*parallel (to use all your system cores to speed up)\nBelow script accept as input any of the following file formats:\nMOBI, LIT, PRC, EPUB, ODT, HTML, CBR, CBZ, RTF, TXT, PDF and LRS.\nIf not installed, then install meld, calibre and parallel:\n#install packages\nsudo apt-get -y install meld calibre parallel\n\nTo be able to execute the code from anywhere in your computer, save following code in a file named \"diffepub\" (with no extensions) inside directory \"/usr/local/bin\". \nusage=\"\n*** usage:\n\ndiffepub - compare text in two files.

Feedback greatly appreciated!\n\n\nA: Even though this doesn't solve the issue directly, here is a nice way to do it all from the commandline with few dependencies:\ndiff <(pdftotext -layout old.pdf /dev/stdout) <(pdftotext -layout new.pdf /dev/stdout)\n\nhttps://linux.die.net/man/1/pdftotext\nIt works really well for basic pdf comparisons.  If you have a newer version of pdftotext you can try -bbox instead of -layout.\nAs far as diffing programs go, I like using diffuse, so the command changes ever so slightly:\ndiffuse <(pdftotext -layout old.pdf /dev/stdout) <(pdftotext -layout new.pdf /dev/stdout)\n\nhttp://diffuse.sourceforge.net/\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: How do I switch between desktops in Compiz? After asking about the number of desktops, I was pointed to the compiz wiki which says:\n\nViewports and desktops are not the same concept.

I understand, based on a number of other sources, that files will not appear in a dash search until they have been opened, due to the search drawing from zeitgeist. \nAs an example, this is frustrating if I am watching a season of a tv series, and I'd like to be able to get to the next episode via dash searching the show title. The obvious, clunky workaround is to open each file once by hand to force them into the index.

Is this process the same, at least essentially, as with ordinary Ubuntu?\n\nA: Ubuntu is intended to be identical for each architecture (currently amd64, armel, i386, powerpc), although there may be some slight differences in behaviour due to incomplete porting to a given architecture (there currently exists no architecture in the archive with no outstanding porting issues, although most are difficult to notice for most users).\nUbuntu Desktop images produced for ARM have included unity-2d as the primary session rather than unity, mostly because there are very few graphics cards available for common armel platforms that support OpenGL in Ubuntu (and none are bundled with common reference devices).  I understand that work is in progress to port Unity to OpenGL ES, which is more commonly supported by default on reference devices, which should result in a return to shipping identical images for Ubuntu Desktop.\nAll Ubuntu documentation, guides, processes, etc. should be the same, regardless of architecture (assuming compatibility of underlying hardware), with the result that if you can achieve some network solution with one architecture (e.g. powerpc), you should be able to do so with another (e.g. armel).\nWhen constructing a network solution with multiple architectures, take care that you have parallel installations of packages, rather than sharing binaries directly between machines: while the same package should behave the same regardless of architecture, in the common case, one is unable to execute e.g. amd64 binaries on an armel host.  Packages in the archive have been separately compiled for each architecture to avoid this confusion, so running apt-get install (or otherwise invoking your favourite package manager) will install the correct build of the package.\n\nA: Probably Unity 2D comes as default because, ARM Netbooks are usually low on graphics.\nAs for network I don't see a reason why it would not run. Does you hardware support network?\nYou can try this, i think it might help you:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM/NattyReleaseNotes\n", "Q: How do I prevent Duplicity from looking at every file in parent folders? When running the next command, I get errors about accessing certain files or directories (like /root) for which Duplicity does not have sufficient permissions:\nduplicity --dry-run --include=\"/home/user\" --include=\"/other/dir\" \\\n    --exclude='/' / file:///tmp/backup-test/\n\nI started wondering why this happens and ran a strace to see which files are accessed:\nstrace -o /tmp/duplicity-traced -e trace=file !!\n\nTo my surprise, every file in the directory / and /home are accessed through stat(). This does not look good, performance-wise. Is duplicity just not optimized for this query or am I missing something?\n\nA: After digging in the source code as retrieved by apt-get source duplicity, I conclude that it's not possible without modifying the source code and its algorithm.\nThe way duplicity works:\n\n\n*\n\n*Scan the *source_directory* for entry\n\n*For each entry found, do a lstat() call. This is used to determine the inode type (e.g. regular file or directory). The result will be cached for this entry\n\n*If the entry exists...\n\n\n*\n\n*and is a symlink, the destination will be read using readlink\n\n*and is a regular file or directory, access() will be called to detect whether the entry is readable or not\n\n*if the entry is readable, it will be tested by each selection function (set by options like --include and --exclude)\n\n\n\nThis looks very reasonable and unless disk access is very slow (NFS?), there is no need to change this algorithm to do the path check before the stat calls.\n", "Q: Google services launcher icon I have added a custom launcher for common services like Gmail etc in Unity.\nGoogle Services Launcher\nWhere can I get the Google services icon?

So I can make Empathy log me in on boot, but how do I make my initial status Busy?\n\nA: There is a bug about the inability to use something other than 'available' as the default status in Empathy. However, if you're willing to consider a different program, Pidgin does let you set a different initial status.\n\nA: After some searching, I found an app that communicates with Empathy via dbus. I pulled some code from that and created a script that will set your status.\n\nSetting it up is pretty easy:\nDownload the script here (github page).\nIt requires some python libraries that are in the repos (and might be installed by default):\nsudo apt-get install python-dbus python-notify\n\nThen to set it to start on login, run Startup Applications, click Add, and fill in the fields like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Name:  Custom -- Start Empathy Busy\n\n*Command:  /usr/bin/python /path/to/empathy_set_status.py dnd\n\n*Comment:  Start empathy and set status to busy (do no disturb).\n\n\nThe command field includes what status to set. If you don't want busy (dnd), then you can use one of these values: available, dnd, away, xa, hidden, offline.\nNow when you log in, the script it should run empathy, wait a bit, and then set your status. You should see a notification when it tries to set your status.\nI don't check that the status is set correctly, so I just have a wait time to hope that empathy will be ready to let us change the status. Adjust your time if it's not working. Increase the value of EMPATHY_STARTUP_SECONDS until it works when you login. If you need to enter a password to unlock your keychain for your IM login, the delay will have to be long enough for Empathy to start up, for you to enter your password, and for Empathy to log into your accounts.\n\nA: Empathy does not allow this directly. However, you could try the following.\nIn summary, you can record the mouse motion events where you would normally click the Me Menu and choose the \"Busy\" status.  Alternatively you can navigate to the same Me Menu entry via the Keyboard shortcut F10 and the arrow keys.  You could then replay these events on logon through a Start Up Application entry.\nThis can be down through an application called \"cnee\".  However, the version in Maverick & Natty does not work.

I don't like rolling release as I heavilly remaster Ubuntu 12.04.2 with unity removed and gnome 3 fallback included plus lots of other tweaks.\"\nMy up-to-date Mint-KDE & Netrunner can emulate all of the above, and more:\nUnity, Docky, Awn, Windows7, IOS, Cairo, Gnome, Mate, Cinnamon, etc - but not E17, which is too confusingly complex for a novice to modify atm.\nYour survey neglect XFCE-based distros, that have seemingly unlimited taskbars on the 4 sides, intellihide, resizable, etc.\nAll the smaller taskbars (Docky, etc) can emulate the power-hungry bigger brothers by adding more apps; Compiz, etc. Not sure why you seem ignorant of this.\nThe so-mentioned deficits of Docky come from your unfair exploration of Docky, versus your biased explorations favoring Unity. Docky allows easy removal, adding, ordering, re-sizing of its icons better than almost any other taskbars, including Unity. If you need cubic or wallpapers of your desktops, just add the apps that allow this, such as Compiz or Cairo.\nPersonally I favor XFCE for fast, light distros on slow or simple setups, plus add-on apps (Compiz, etc) if needed.

For some reason I have a bunch of left-over start menu entries from applications (e.g, Gnome Do, Synapse, Leafpad.) and was wondering if  there's a way to remove all orphaned entries for applications that are no longer installed?\n\nA: You can use the following command to list application icons that link to nonexistent programs:\nfor i in {/usr,~/.local}/share/applications/*.desktop; do which $(grep -Poh '(?<=Exec=).*?( |$)' $i) > /dev/null || echo $i; done\n\nI suspect you'll find that most of yours are customized icons in your home folder, since these are not automatically cleaned up by the package manager. If this is the case and you'd like to trash  them all at once, you can use a modification of the previous command:\nfor i in ~/.local/share/applications/*.desktop; do which $(grep -Poh '(?<=Exec=).*?( |$)' $i) > /dev/null || trash $i; done\n\nOr, of course, browse to ~/.local/share/applications/ in Nautilus and trash them via the graphical interface.\n\nA: If by start menu you mean the 'Applications' menu, you can edit it by going to:\nSystem -> Preferences -> Main Menu.\nYou can add, rearrange, edit and delete entries at will.\n\nA: When an application is uninstalled it should remove menu items it installed. And it work this way on my machine. \nIf it works differently, it is a bug of a particular package or a problem on your system. I cannot believe that you have more than 40 entry orphaned. It would be the symptom of a problem. \n\nA: Alternative:\nFollowing @ændrük answer, here is a similar solution that support spaces in path and subfolders, this can be used on a specific folder or the the entire disk to look for broken .desktop files (shortcut)\nfind {/usr,~/.local,/usr/local,}/share/applications/ -name '*.desktop' | while read -r line; do which $(grep -Poh '(?<=Exec=).*?( |$)' $line) > /dev/null || echo $line;  done\n\nFor the entire disk \nfind / -name '*.desktop' | while read -r line; do which $(grep -Poh '(?<=Exec=).*?( |$)' $line) > /dev/null || echo $line;  done\n\nNote: that any method can show false positive check twice found files before deleting them\n\nA: Well, this one is hard but i want, at least, to tell you what's the problem.\nGnome stores the installed applications in /usr/share/applications with files ended in .desktop (so vlc program is launchad by vlc.desktop)\nInside each one, there's a \"Category\" section in which you can set in what part of the Applications menu that program you want it to be. The thing is: the only way i think it can be done what you are asking for is using a bash script that ask if the package related to that .desktop is installed or not. if it's not, delete that .desktop file. When you delete the file, it will be out of the menu, and when you app is in a category, that one isn't shown.\nThat one is a bit out of my scope because every command (dpkg, apt-get, etc..) always return a good exit when they say the package isn't installed, so we have to read the exit from that app searching for a String (f.i. \"not installed\"), check it, and if the String exists, it means the application isn't installed and the .desktop can be deleted.\nSo, if you want, you could just enter the folder (/usr/share/applications) and click on files that correspond to the programs. They'll dissappear from the Applications menu. To do it automatically, i guess we need a good bash script on the track i said.\nI hope this helps in some way.\n\nA: I found on the internet a very smart person who knew of a program called Alacarte (easy GNOME menu editing) program.

What do I put in this field?\n\n\nA: More accurately:  It's a list of domains that the DNS resolver will append to a hostname when attempting to resolve it to an IP address.\nFor example, let's say you manager a bunch of servers at mycompany.com (web1.mycompany.com, web2.mycompany.com, db.mycompany.com, etc), and you're tired of typing the fully-qualified domain name every time you need to ping them or SSH to them.\nYou can add \"mycompany.com\" to the list of search domains to avoid that.  Now when you ping or SSH to web1, it will try to resolve web1, fail, then try web1.mycompany.com, which will succeed.\n\nA: If you connect to a domain server at work with a number of other servers connected to it you would put the names of the other servers you wish to search in this field.\nThe average user connecting to their ISP would leave this field blank.\nThe following Ubuntu Forums post explains it in more detail \n", "Q: My gnome-panel is misssing In Ubuntu classic, Ubuntu classic (no effects) and safe mode the interface Panel is  missing in Natty 11.04, but it is normal in Unity 3D.

I've only been booting into classic gnome desktop since 11.04 and since upgrading to 11.04 I'm having horrible window flickering and what seems to almost be gdm restarting. Maybe it's not gdm restarting but what happens is the desktop will flicker, all windows from all workspaces will come to the current workspace, often all window decoration will be gone, artifacts, and super choppy window dragging.\nAnyway, does unity-window-decorator have something to do with it? Is this compiz? Can I replace it with something else? \nEDIT: I'm pretty sure it has something to do with the buggy nvidia drivers. I know that the switch to unity-window-decorator is new between 10.10 and 11.04 so thought it may be an issue too. \nEDIT:For reference if it does have something to do with the drivers, I'm using nvidia-current on - \nproduct: G92 [GeForce 9800 GTX+]\nvendor: nVidia Corporation\n\nI run $compiz --replace & but that doesn't fix it.\n\n\nA: Unity-window-decorator is definitely not your problem, as it is almost identical to the gnome-window-decorator. The most likely cause of the problem is that you (probably) have buggy drivers (probably because of your hardware, which you should add to your question by the way), causing compiz to crash or restart. (By the way this is not gdm restarting, that would take your entire Xsession with it).\nIf you are pretty convinced (though I am not) that unity-window-decorator is the problem, you can change the compiz window decorator to gnome-window-decorator in ccsm.\nAlso, you can try using metacity (you will lose your effects, but at least it will work) instead of compiz.\nSee this answer:\nHow to Get nvidia driver working properly ( running experimental 3d support)\n", "Q: Teach a novice how to import a photo and upload it to eBay Is there an easier way to upload files in Web browser (HTML) file upload forms other than noting/cutting a file location and typing/pasting that location into a Browse... dialog? I've heard drag and drop upload is on the way, but looks like eBay isn't using it yet.\nMy Dad was frustrated trying to import a photo off his digital camera and upload it to eBay. He had the import part figured out (GNOME/F-Spot does a pretty good job with that), but was stuck because he didn't know how to browse to the photo.\nIn my older F-Spot (on Ubuntu 10.04), when you right click on a photo there's a \"Copy Photo Location\" option. This copies the full path of the file into the clipboard, and I can easily use this for browser file upload forms. Apparently this was changed in his newer F-Spot (on Ubuntu 10.10)... now it's just \"Copy Photo\". I don't know what \"Copy Photo\" does, but it doesn't put the full photo file path in the clipboard.\nI came up with a many-step process so he could do this on his own. Anyone know a better way? This is just crazy:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Import photo to F-Spot.\n  \n*Double-click on photo.\n  \n*Copy/remember photo filename (something like DSCN0471.JPG).\n  \n*Click \"Places\" in the panel on the top of the desktop.\n  \n*Choose \"Search for Files...\".\n  \n*Paste or type in the filename next to \"Name contains:\".\n  \n*Click \"Find\".\n  \n*If the file is found, note the Folder listed (if not, try searching again). You may leave the \"Search for Files\" window open.\n  \n*When visiting the site where you will upload the photo, you'll be prompted to upload a file. The file upload \"form\" will include buttons such as \"Browse...\" and \"Upload\".\n  \n*First click \"Browse...\".\n  \n*Browse to the photo in the Folder listed in step 8. Click \"Open\" to choose that file. The window will close and you will return to the file upload form.\n  \n*Click Upload.\n  \n*Done!\n  \n\n\nA: Well, perhaps a slightly less annoying way is right-clicking the photo in f-spot, going to Open With and selecting e.g. firefox. Then you can copy+paste the path to the file.\nIf the photos get imported to a particular folder, you could also add that folder as a \"bookmark\" on the left of the file chooser dialog.\nStill, let's hope a newer version of f-spot comes with a less annoying method :)\n", "Q: gnome-themes-standard tries to overwrite a file from gnome-accessability-themes I was trying to install gnome3 on my ubuntu but because of some reason, apt-get went into an invalid state after the installation (which was incomplete i think).

That's not possible. In natty, this file is in gnome-themes-standard 2.91.93-1 and not in gnome-accessibility-themes 2.32.1-0ubuntu1. You have third-party versions of both these packages, so you should report your problem as a bug to that third party. If the packages come from different third parties, then these are two incompatible packages sources, which may or may not be a bug they consider worth fixing. Do make sure that you have their latest version of gnome-accessibility-themes first: run\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gnome-accessibility-themes\n\nThe easiest solution to your problem is to wait for the package provider to fix the packages. Or, if nothing depends on gnome-accessibility-themes, you could try removing it.\nThe packaging tools actually offer a way to make two packages cohabit even when they provide a file in common. You can rename one of the packages' version of the file with dpkg-divert:\nsudo dpkg-divert --rename --package gnome-accessibility-themes \\\n                 --divert /usr/share/themes/HighContrastInverse/index.theme.gnome-accessibility-themes \\\n                /usr/share/themes/HighContrastInverse/index.theme\n\nI don't necessarily recommend this: there may be other incompatibilities between the packages that you'll only find out later, and it can get messy if there are a lot of conflicting files. If you try the diversion, dpkg-divert --remove --rename --package gnome-accessibility-themes /usr/share/themes/HighContrastInverse/index.theme will cancel its effects.\n", "Q: How to set a folder inside an apache document to the correct permission?

For completeness, since Snaps are now a thing, there are at least 4 locations:\nGlobally:\n/usr/share/applications\n\n/usr/local/share/applications/ (less common)\nLocally:\n~/.local/share/applications\n\nSnaps:\n/var/lib/snapd/desktop/applications\n\n\nA: cd ~/.local/share/applications is the 1st place that is look in.\nExamples from my directory that I used to add quicklists:\n\n~/.local/share/applications$ ls\nbanshee.desktop           gnome-terminal.desktop\nchromium-browser.desktop  mimeapps.list\nfirefox.desktop           nautilus-home.desktop\ngedit.desktop             ubuntu-software-center.desktop\n\n\nA: Besides globally in /usr/share/applications, locally in ~/.local/share/applications, it also has in /usr/local/share/applications/.

I am trying to collect all the files under the current directory and all the subdirectories to one directory. I am trying something like the following \nfind -type f -exec mv {} collection/{} \\; \n\nthe above command won't work because the second {} gives the full path, how can I collect all the files? \n\nA: Instead of using find (which does the job well), you could also use the shell to this end.\nSay you want to all files from $PWD to $DEST. The natural attempt would be:\nmv $PWD/* $DEST\n\nHow does this work? The expression \"$PWD/*\" expands to the names of all files in that directory. This shell feature is called \"globbing\". The last argument of mv is the destination directory. If you have very many files, this won't work because the length of the command line is limited.\nBut the solution has the problem that it omits dot files - or \"hidden\" files, files and directories whose name start with a \".\". To solve this, you have to tell your shell to include dotfiles when globbing. To do this, use\nshopt -s dotglob\n\nwhen using bash (and you probably use bash unless you've changed the default). In this shell, the above command will work for dotfiles as well.\nAs an aside, in zsh, you have the option to choose this on a case-by-case basis. To do this, put\nsetopt extendedglob\n\nin your .zshrc. Then you can use\nmv $PWD/*(D) $DEST\n\nto move all the files, including dotfiles. (The \"D\" has the effect of temporarily enabling the \"GLOB_DOTS\" option). \nNow the original question was to move all regular files (not directories) from all subdirectories and their subdirectories to a single directory. This can be accomplished with zsh:\nmv $PWD/**/*(D.)\n\nHere the expression **/* makes the globber descend recursively into subdirectories. The D means \"also select dotfiles'; the . means \"only select regular files, not directories\".\n\nA: Remove the {} from mv, mv will take it as target directory ignoring any parent directories:\nfind -type f -exec mv {} collection/ \\;\n\n", "Q: LastFM no longer free?

If I restore their folders into the new 'home' folder on the fresh install, will this recreate their accounts and settings? Or is there a better way to accomplish this?\n\nA: Ideally, /home should be on a separate partition. Then, when you install, specify your partitions manually. Set up your home partition to live at /home and make sure you don't format it. Then, you should have everything set up fine.\n\nIf you don't have a separate partition, you can use GParted to resize your partition and create a /home partition (which should usually be the largest partition) as ext4 or ext3.

It does not support 3D, so using things like Compiz, Gnome-shell or Unity does not work, but most other stuff works. I've used it to run OpenOffice.org in a browser, for instance (which is really quite nice). \nX2Go is another alternative that uses Nomachines libraries, but is better integrated with Ubuntu, with PulseAudio support, etc. If your clients are primarily Windows based, then Nomachine might be a better choice, but if you use Ubuntu on your clients, then X2go is better. X2go is completely free software, whereas Nomachine NX is closed source, but provides a gratis server that allows two different users to access the server, limited to two connections at any one time. \nYou can find X2go here: http://www.x2go.org/index.php?id=1&L=5\nNomachine: http://www.nomachine.com/\nThere is also a third alternative: Xrdp. It wasn't very mature the last time I used it, and it seems to be poorly documented, but it is supposed to work very well. The advantage of using it, is that many systems come preinstalled with an RDP client, so you don't have to install anything on the client side. \nIf you plan on using this extensively, then I would suggest you give all of them a try and see which fits best. \n", "Q: How do I connect to TTY/COM (/dev/ttyUSB0)? I am running Ubuntu for the first time by booting from a USB drive. Now I have plugged in a USB-to-serial converter which has been recognized and automatically added as /dev/ttyUSB0.\nHow do I access /dev/ttyUSB0?\n\nA: Use one of screen's lesser known features:\nscreen /dev/ttyUSB0\n\n\nA: you can use ckermit also. It should be in the repository. After installing it create a file in your home directory called .mykermrc then add the 5 following lines:\nset line /dev/ttyUSB0   \nset flow-control none  \nset carrier-watch off  \nset speed 115200  \nconnect \n\nparameters can be adjusted as necessary.\nsave the file.\nto start it  \nsudo kermit \n\n\nA: You can use putty. Its an ssh/serial/telnet client for Windows and Linux. You can download it from http://linux.softpedia.com/get/System/Networking/PuTTY-347.shtml\n\nA: You can use picocom, it is a minimal dumb-terminal emulation program. Basic usage is something like this (change 11520 to the desired baud rate):\n$ picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0\n\nYou have all the options you may want from a dumb-terminal program, like stop bits, parity, local echo, carriage return / line feed / backspace / delete / tab translation, X/Y/Z-modem and ASCII transfer integration, etc.\nSee man picocom and  picocom --help for further information.\n\nA: I was using puTTY to connect to the serial ports. But don't forget to add your user to dialout: sudo adduser <username> dialout then reboot the system.\nAfter that, you can use puTTY for serial connections such as /dev/ttyUSB0.\n\nA: Needed Mint 17.1 to talk to my Arduino, after a little chasing around, it turns out that your user must be part of the dialout group to use the tty. This should apply to Ubuntu as well. You can do so either by running the command:\nsudo usermod -a -G dialout username\nOr graphically, by using:\nAdministration → Users & Groups → Manage Groups\nIn which case you would go to the line for dialout, check the properties to ensure that username is ticked, if not username must be added.\nThis worked for me and by the look of lots of posts others have had the same problem.\n\nA: You could use tio - a simple tty terminal I/O application:\ntio /dev/ttyUSB0\n\nSee http://tio.github.io\n\nA: busybox microcom -t 5000 /dev/ttyUSB0\n\nSource: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1471241\n\nA: Or\nminicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0\n\nIf you need to configure it first, then\nminicom -s\n\nIf you're wondering where's the meta key in MacOS, you will need to plan an escape.

After upgrading to Ubuntu 11.04 (from 10.10) with Unity, and after I've been messing around with the (gtk, I guess?) theme a little, I've encountered a little problem.\nIn my panel (the one with the systray) all text are gray, the same goes on for all my right click menus and so on. After googleing I've found out that I need to change the text[normal] (or something like) variable in my GTK theme. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\nI've also found out that I need to edit a file in my theme /usr/share/themes/<theme-name>\nBut which file, and where in the file?\nNeeds to be changed to black. (Can I use hex codes, ex.: #000000 ?)\nActually I see that the text in my right click menu is black when an option is disabled. I actually need to switch those two colors - in order to get everything right. Correct?\nThanks alot!\n\nA: If the theme is a system theme (installed by default), you can find it in the  /usr/share/themes/ directory. So for example if it is Ambiance, you will find it in /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc file.\nIf you have installed it on user mode you can probably find the theme in ~/.themes/ directory. Then go to the relevant themes gtk-2/0 and open the gtkrc file. \nAt the top you might find a line as gtk-color-scheme =. There you can find the text colors.\nBut one can also change the color from right-click on desktop, them change background. Then under Theme tab select Customize and then after selecting the relevant theme, go to colors tab. Here you can change the text colors. \n", "Q: Which options on Adobe Flash Player do I choose so that I could watch videos on YouTube?

When the monitor is connected while booting, it works side-by-side\n\n*Unity: when I close the laptop, everything becomes black and doesn't react anymore, even though in the system power settings I set the behaviour to \"blank screen\". Opening the laptop again, results in a black picture on both monitors, only the mouse arrow is visible. But still nothing reacts and I have to reboot the laptop manually.\n\n*Ubuntu classic: Here, when I close the laptop, the external monitor shows the desktop, but in bad resolution. In the monitor settings, I recognize that the system thinks it is the laptop monitor.

I installed the VMware bundle on my Ubuntu 11.04 successfully but when I open it it gives me this window \n\nand I don't know the path to this C headers.\n\nA: My first guess is that you haven't installed the headers. You need to install the appropriate linux-headers package. Most likely, you need to install linux-headers-generic. However, if if you're running some kernel other than linux-generic, install the linux-headers package for that kernel.\nIf you've already installed the headers, they should be in /usr/src.\n\nA: Problem can be solved in two steps, after installing vmware workstation 9.X.X (in terminal):\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install gcc\n\n*sudo vmware-modconfig --console --install-all --appname=\"VMware Player\" --icon=\"vmware-player\"\n\nA: CTRL+ALT+t\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic\n\nA: Below commands are very helpful for you:\nStep 1 :  Ctrl + Alt + T\nStep 2 : sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)\nStep 3 : The path to the kernel headers is then \n/usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/include\n\nA: Had the same issue, I was running  kernel 3.2.0-29 but only had linux-headers-3.2.0-35 in /usr/src/\nuser@ubuntu:/usr/src$ ls -l\ndrwxr-xr-x 24 root root 4096 Jan  5 11:17 linux-headers-3.2.0-35\ndrwxr-xr-x  7 root root 4096 Jan  5 11:17 linux-headers-3.2.0-35-generic\n\nuser@ubuntu:/usr/src/linux-headers-3.2.0-35/include$ uname -a\n\nLinux ubuntu 3.2.0-29-generic #46-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jul 27 17:03:23 UTC 2012 x86_6                                                                                4 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nuser@ubuntu:/usr/src$ sudo apt-get install linux-headers-3.2.0-29-generic\n\nuser@ubuntu:/usr/src/$ cd /tmp/vmware-tools-distrib\nuser@ubuntu:/tmp/vmware-tools-distrib$ sudo ./vmware-install.pl\n<kept hitting enter>\n\nEnjoy, --the VMware team\n\ndone and done\n\n\nA: Before installing Vmware Workstation you need to install build-essential and linux headers \n   sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)\n\nand then \n sudo ln -s /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/include/generated/uapi/linux/version.h /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/include/linux/version.h\n\nDone thats it, install Vmware Workstation now\n path to vm# sh Vm***.bundle\n\n\nA: There are a few files in locations that the installer doesn't expect, I run this and it works:\nifrantz@ifrantz:~$ cat ~/update_version.sh \n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/include/linux\nsudo ln -s ../generated/utsrelease.h\nsudo ln -s ../generated/autoconf.h\nsudo ln -s ../generated/uapi/linux/version.h \n\n\nA: cd /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/include/linux\nsudo ln -s ../generated/utsrelease.h\nsudo ln -s ../generated/autoconf.h\nsudo ln -s ../generated/uapi/linux/version.h \n\nAfter adding the symlink, the path is /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/include (Thanks @Kariem!)\n", "Q: Disable gnome-panel launcher (Alt+F2) I'm running Unity and a gnome-panel panel at the bottom at the same time.

The relevant file for opening the URL is:\n/usr/share/launchpad-integration/launchpadintegration/urls.py\n\nBy analyzing that file, I conclude that a new Firefox window is forced if the application to be run is firefox %s (determined by gconftool-2).

Regular users can only numerically increase process priorities (that is, make tasks less important) using this command, but the root operator can use the full nice range of scheduling (-20 to 19). Lower number is higher priority. Most processes seem to run at nice of 0. If you run CLI top you'll see your running processes. The column labeled NI is the nice number. If you run CLI nice with no parameters you'll see:\nUsage:\n renice [-n] priority [-p|--pid] pid  [... pid]\n\n renice [-n] priority  -g|--pgrp pgrp [... pgrp]\n\n renice [-n] priority  -u|--user user [... user]\n\n renice -h | --help\n\n renice -v | --version\n\nI suggest you experiment as I have no infinite wisdom as to the right nice value for your purposes.\n\nA: Raise the niceness.

I want to use mouse bindings in the Compiz Desktop Wall to go to different Workspaces by clicking the mouse in the corners. Does anyone know how to make this work?\nI've already tried to do it so in CCSM and in gconf-editor (apps -> compiz -> plugins-> wall-> options) but I can't enable it. The configuration is there but it's not working. \n\nA: It looks like I found a way around to deal with the problem for binding the mouse corner over Unity. To do this I installed a program called xdotool to be able to execute commands to be sent till X. I found this answer over the OMG Ubuntu when they talk about binding the upper-left corner to auto open the Desktop Wall utility and for my surprise it worked like a charm. So here go the steps to do for making this way around.\nInstall xdotool:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool \nOpen ccsm and go to your settings in Desktop Wall (Or whatever you want to bind, Ring Swichter for example) \n\nLook at the commands that you have for binding the edge that you want. For me for example I have to command to switch till the left workspace is ctrl+alt+Left. This is the keystrokes that you have to know to create your binding edge. The others bindings, in my case are ctrl+alt+Rigt, ctrl+alt+Up and ctrl+alt+Down.\n\nIn ccsm go to the Commands option\n\nHere we have to enter the xdotoll commands. At command line 1 I already entered the command to open the Unity Desktop Wall Utility so at command line 2 I put the command:\nxdotool key ctrl+alt+Rigth\nNow go to Edge Bindings tab to create the edge bind.\n\nNow click over the Run command 2 to create the bind.\n\nChoose the right corner and click OK\n\nAt this point the ccsm might pop-up that if you want to create this bind you have to disable the Flip Edge effect. I dont even knew that I had this on, it might be enable by default from the Unity. Thats no problem in disable it and enable this bind, so just disable the Flip Edge and enable this new bind (This one is for the Flip Edge effect is from rotate cube binding, and at this example we are using the Desktop Wall, so if you dont had the rotating cube enable it might dont pop up this message).\nFor creating the new binds for the other corners you just have to follow the same steps as you did for creating the right edge. But please read about the left-edge. The code for the other edges are:\nxdotool key ctrl+alt+Up\nxdotool key ctrl+alt+Down\nThe Left edge\nxdotool key ctrl+alt+Left\nFor the left-edge dont use the left corner, instead use the lower-left corner or the upper-left corner. Because the left edge is used by the Unity to hide/access the Unity launcher (dock) and if you disable the default Unity effect IT WILL BROKE your Compiz/Unity. So be careful about disabling the unity effect if it pop it. \nSo once again, if pop up a compiz message asking for disable the Unity dont disable it, just change the corner to lower-left or upper-left corners.\nI hope that it could help you out.\n\nA: That appears to be a bug and it's not only you but there are others. For example, I face similar issues when I try enabling mouse bindings for Ring Switcher. See Ring Switcher in Unity - Mouse combinations don't work.

I would suggest you to do the same.\n", "Q: Why is Banshee not showing in sound menu in 11.04? There is no entry for Banshee in the sound menu. Why is this?

I can grab normal scroll bars by moving my pointer far to the right. I'm usually able to do this without looking because the pointer stops at the edge, and the scrollbar is on the edge. I'm familiar with this to the point that I'm usually not aware of the act of scrolling.\nIn Unity, the visual indicator is on the edge, but the control is not.

I want to change from Ubuntu 11.04 to another distro and I have /home on a different partition than the other folders. I want to ask if it's possible to keep the same /home partion with another distro like OpenSuse or Mint?\nThe reason why I want to make the change is that Ubuntu is using a lot of RAM; even my WindowsXP with 512 RAM is working better than 1GB of RAM on Ubuntu. But maybe I'm the only one which thinks that an operating system should not respond to clicks after some seconds or to use all the RAM and Swap although only one program is running...\n\n\nA: Of cause it is generally possible. Just be sure not to format it during installation. But I advise you against doing this: later, many problems will surely arise.\nThings to beware of:\n\n*\n\n*File access rights are stored not for user name, but for user id. Be sure your user has the same id on all OSes.\n\n*Some apps will go crazy. Especially if they are of different versions or do some sort of file indexing.\n\n*Some apps that use inotify are not ready for the fact they can miss some change in protected file.\n\n*Dosens of other.\n\nWhat you should do is to keep all your files on a separate partition, but not to mount it as /home. Let every system have it's own /home on the root partition. Mount your files partition somewhere like /home/storage, as I do, or mount it into /mnt and symlink folders into every /home you have.\n\nA: Copy home to Portable USB drive\n\n*\n\n*Format flash drive to ext4.\n\n\n*As root use Grsync (install with sudo apt install grsync) to copy /home/{username} from the internal drive to the flash drive. Preserving owner, permissions and group by checking the relevant checkboxes works for me.\n\n\n\n*Copy or write down UUID of the new partition.\n\n\n*Edit /etc/fstab on the internal drive to add the /home UUID:\nUUID={UUID from above} /home   ext4    defaults        0       0\n\nIt might be a good idea to use an encrypted home when traveling.\nThanks to @ubfan1 for the hint.\n", "Q: Unity/gnome mess I've recently upgraded from 10.10 to 11.04, and immediately switched to unity-2d (running on a netbook).

When I logout/login it doesn't let me choose between settings (ubuntu classic, etc.).\nThanks!\n\nA: While not necessarily a solution to your dilemma, ATL-F2 should let you run anything.

When searching for laser printers from the desired manufacturer and targeted price range using Openprinting.org site, the best I can get for compatibility with Ubuntu is 'mostly' (explained here and looks like this- ). I am uncertain what exactly 'mostly' means. Where or how can I search for laser printers that are perfectly compatible with Ubuntu? Any recommendations for any printers?\n\nA: About searching for perfectly working printers: the openprinting website lets you sort by manufacturer. Here is a list for HP. You will get the printers marked with  first and below that the printers marked  \nI used HP as an example for a reason: I have yet to purchase a HP printer that did not work in Ubuntu. Currently I have a HP PSC 2175 all-in-one and printer, scanner and card reader work out of the box.\nAnd to finish it off: 'mostly' seems to be adressing printers that do work but have some minor issues (mostly not about printing). But to support Linux and you having the best experience... pick one from the once that do work flawlessly. \n\nA: I have a Konica Minolta PagePro 1400W black and white laser. Konica Minolta tell you there is not any Linux support for it, and they don't have any. It is not listed in the openprinting.org site on their printer list, however, if you do some searching, there is a PPD on their site for this printer. It is rated with 2 Penguins.

I have an SD card in it giving another 4gig. How can I use that space?\n\nA: \nWould I have enough space to upgrade to 11.04 from 10.10\n\nThat depends on how much space you've used. This page on Ubuntu wiki (last update 2009) says bare minimum is 1.8 GB. However, most of that is not new, so an upgrade will probably not require a lot of additional space.\n\nHow can I use that space?\n\nIf you mount your SD as a system file directory, you can have system files on your SD. However if you remove your SD card, your system may stop working!\nTo move a system directory to your SD card, see this question. You can follow a similar process to move your home directory to your SD card.\nTo move your whole Ubuntu install to your SD card, see this question.\nIf you're not using Update Manager, see this question on setting mount points in the live-cd installer.\n\nKeep in mind that your SSD drive and your SD card will have different performance characteristics. I'd suggest you ask a new question about how to layout your Ubuntu install with a small SSD and SD card.\n\nA: Well, you will not have any problem with disk space during the install. Depends on how you will be using ubuntu whether for experimental purposes, etc. But if you look forward to handling all your day-to-day activities in ubuntu, then you should reconsider assigning the partition a larger disk size.\nI started off with ubuntu with fairly a low-disk space but that has changed now because I need to install applications, store files etc.\njust know that the 2GB can handle the installation but you might not enjoy it.\n", "Q: Is there a command to go a specific workspace? I'm trying to make a quicklist on the Workspace Switcher launcher that allows for quick switching to a certain workspace. (My friend sometimes uses my computer and just doesn't enjoy keyboard shortcuts, so I want to help him out.)\nSo is there a command one could type in a terminal that would force a certain workspace to be focused on? \n\nA: You can use wmctrl.  \nBasics commands:\nwmctrl -d to show all of your workspaces.\nwmctrl -s <workspace_name> to change to a specific workspace.    \nIf you are using Compiz, you will have to do a trick because Compiz \"workspaces\" are actually Viewports of a single Workspace.    \nTrick Instructions\nCheck the output of wmctrl -d For example, mine is: \n0  * DG: 4098x2304  VP: 1366,0  WA: 0,23 1366x745  N/A  \n\nThis means that actually I have one Workspace of 4098 x 2304 instead of what I \"think\" I have (nine \"workspaces\", 3 x 3).\nI was at what was supposed to be \"workspace\" 2, but actually I was at viewport (VP) 1366,0 (4098 / 3 = 1366) as showed by the output above.  \nSo this is how it works: we take the whole Workspace and divide for the numbers of \"workspaces\" we \"think\" we have. In my case: 4098 / 3 = 1366 and 2304 / 3 = 768.  \nIf I want to go to my \"workspace\" 1, the command is:  \nwmctrl -o 0,0\n\nThen, if I want to go to my \"workspace\" 4, the command is:  \nwmctrl -o 0,768\n\nIf I want to go to my \"workspace\" 8, the command is:  \nwmctrl -o 1366,1536\n\nIf I want to go to my \"workspace\" 9, the command is:  \nwmctrl -o 2732,1536\n\nGot it? ;-)\nThe -o flag \"truncates\" their values.\nIn other words it changes the \"workspace\" where the actual pixel is belonging to.\nThe following are equivalent:\nwmctrl -o 0,0\nwmctrl -o 1365,767\n\n\nA: It is beautifully simple to achieve what you want with xdotool, which has multiple options for managing different workspaces (also known as 'desktops' within the program documentation). I find it can be very interesting and creative to string together commands from man xdotool; the commands I have formulated below might be useful in scripts. \nNote: With some window managers, or if you are using compiz, you may need to use xdotool commands such as set_desktop_viewport and get_desktop_viewport. You may have to specify the commands in a different way like desgua suggests above, but for me the set_desktop and set_desktop_for_window commands proved most useful on a non-compiz system.)\n(The solution is most useful for Xubuntu/Lubuntu users, or those who are not running compiz,etc.)\nTo list the number of current workspaces, enter \nxdotool get_num_desktops\n\nThe following commands will only work if you have at least 1 other workspace.\nTo change focus to your workspace 1, just enter\nxdotool set_desktop 1 \n\nThen to return to the default workspace, enter \nxdotool set_desktop 0\n\nThe workspace just needs to be specified as the last value in the command (1 or 2 or 3, etc).\nTo find the number of the workspace you are currently on, you could use \nxdotool get_desktop\n\nThese commands could be used in scripts and they should be very useful for achieving what you what.\nFor how to switch applications to a particular desktop, see my answer here:\n\n\n*\n\n*how to shift applications from workspace 1 to 2 using command\nFor more useful options available for workspace switching, consult man xdotool.\n\nA: I have implemented a script that does what you want.\nHere it is: https://github.com/norswap/wmov/blob/master/wmov.sh\nIt works indeed as described in desgua's post. It also the capabilities to send windows to other workspaces.\n\nA: There is a script called compiz-send.py on the compiz wiki that partly adresses your question: it is not a specific workspace but you can get to the one next to it.\nWith this you can issue a command\n./compiz-dbus-send.py put put_viewport_left_key \n./compiz-dbus-send.py put put_viewport_right_key \nand have the viewport go 1 to the left or to right.\n\nA: Going to a specific workspace and performing actions there can be implemented with Python and the library pyautogui, that enables Python scripts to perform mouse clicks, keystrokes, etc.\nI wrote a short tutorial in the forum for Peppermint OS about starting an app on a specific workplace.\n\nA: Update for desgua's answer - seems wmctrl -d outputs differently for Ubuntu 18.04. \nThis provides shortcuts for first, last and new workspaces too, or as a function you can call __ws_switch N where N is the workspace number.\n0  * DG: 1920x1080  VP: 0,0  WA: 0,28 1920x1052  Workspace 1\n1  - DG: 1920x1080  VP: N/A  WA: 0,28 1920x1052  Workspace 2\n2  - DG: 1920x1080  VP: N/A  WA: 0,28 1920x1052  Workspace 3\n3  - DG: 1920x1080  VP: N/A  WA: 0,28 1920x1052  Workspace 4\n4  - DG: 1920x1080  VP: N/A  WA: 0,28 1920x1052  Workspace 5\n5  - DG: 1920x1080  VP: N/A  WA: 0,28 1920x1052  Workspace 6\n6  - DG: 1920x1080  VP: N/A  WA: 0,28 1920x1052  Workspace 7\n7  - DG: 1920x1080  VP: N/A  WA: 0,28 1920x1052\n\nNote the final blank workspace that isn't currently used.

Two are giving me problems with the UDB optical mouse being frozen upon boot, to either a login prompt, or to the desktop.\nBoth computers are running AMD processors. Both are 32 bit systems. One has nVidia graphics and one has ATI graphics, which seems to rule out graphics. I tried changing the drivers on the nVidia system and that didn't make any difference. Doing a complete power down of the system was the only way I found try to get it working until I discovered that if I unplug the mouse mouse and plug it back in, it will work fine from then on. Doing a restart when it is frozen never results in a functioning mouse. Other than unplugging the mouse, a complete power down is required.\nBoth systems were using the same make/model of mouse, Logitech. To rule out it being the mouse, I've been using one of them on my laptop with 32 bit Ubuntu 11.04, and it has worked perfectly, so it most likely isn't a mouse issue, although using an Acer mouse on the one system seemed to alleviate the problem. \nIf I plug the Logitech mouse into the front mouse USB ports instead of using the rear USB ports on each computer, the number of times the mouse is frozen on boot has significantly been reduced. It still happens occasionally, but not nearly as frequently. Both computers are using PS2 keyboards, so I don't know the situation would be if they were USB.\nThe computer with the ATI graphics card is my wifes. I have the exact same computer at home with nVidia graphics at home. Mine has worked perfectly. But the other computer with problems has nVidia graphics, so, as I said before, I doubt it is a graphics problem.\nI'm guessing it is a kernel issue.\nOne suggestion I found on line was modifying the grub file line \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" \n\nto \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash pcie_aspm=off\" \n\nbut that didn't make any difference.

This package keeps track of Linux kernel changes and\n  recompiles the vboxdrv kernel module if necessary.\n\n\n\nA: Re-install virtualbox-dkms package first\nsudo apt-get autoremove virtualbox-dkms\nsudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-`uname -r` dkms virtualbox-dkms\n\nAfter that You can enable it manually\nsudo modprobe vboxdrv\nsudo modprobe vboxnetflt\n\n\nA: Another reason why this can happen is that you have an older GCC version (like I had GCC 4.8 installed on Ubuntu 16.04) set as default (by, for example, using update-alternatives) when you try to update or reinstall VirtualBox.\nJust go back to default GCC version that came with your distro for VirtualBox installation, and it'll work fine.\nYou can then switch back to an older GCC version after VirtualBox is installed.\n\nA: I have the same issue and solved by these two steps:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`\n\nthen\n/etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup\n\n\nA: I have deb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian precise contrib in my /etc/apt/sources.list, to be able to use Virtualbox 5.x.\nFaced with the same error, I tried all of the methods here and none work but this (bandwith-wasting) one:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get purge virtualbox virtualbox-4* virtualbox-5*\n\n*Reboot\n\n*sudo apt-get install virtualbox-5.0\n\n*Install the latest extension pack from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads\n\nA: Most probably all you have to do is run \nsudo apt-get install dkms\n\n(or install dkms from the software center)\nand then run \nsudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup\n\nand write your password.\nif you have any error with this commands use this one\nsudo modprobe vboxdrv\n\n\nA: sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic build-essential dkms\nsudo apt-get remove --purge virtualbox-dkms\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-dkms\n\nJust use three command for ubuntu users.\n\nA: Took me a long time to solve this issue. Had this problem with vBox across 2 distros (Ubuntu and Arch). \nI had dkms and all the modules already installed and compiled into my kernel, yet I still got a module related error message when I tried to run a vBox virtual machine.\nIf your vBox GUI starts without a hitch but get an error telling to install the VBoxDrv kernel module when you try to run a virtual machine, your problems are not related to installing the modules into your kernel but ACTIVATING THEM in modprobe which the module installation script fails to do.\nTo load a module manually (such as vboxdrv in your case), open a terminal prompt and put in :\nsudo modprobe vboxdrv\n\nIf you Virtual Machine runs after that without giving you an error message, then you can activate the vboxdrv module permanently by going to /etc/modules-load.d/ and making a .conf file (such as vbox.conf). In the .conf file the names of the vbox kernel modules you want to add, such as: vboxdrv.\nSave and reboot\nYou can also ad these optional modules: vboxnetadp, vboxnetflt and vboxpci\nFrom Vbox's wiki:\nvboxnetadp and vboxnetflt are both needed when you intend to use the \"Host-only networking\" feature. More precisely, vboxnetadp is needed to create the host interface in the VirtualBox global preferences, and vboxnetflt is needed to launch a virtual machine using that network interface.\nvboxpci is needed when your virtual machine needs to pass through a PCI device on your host.\nNote: If the VirtualBox kernel modules were loaded in the kernel while you updated the modules, you need to reload them manually to use the new updated version. To do it, run vboxreload as root.\n\nA: Did you install Virtualbox by downloading it from some web site?\nIf so, I'd recommend you to install it using the Ubuntu Software Center instead (type Virtualbox and click on install and you're set).\nIf you have some terminal skills, type this into the console:\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-ose\n\nIf you still want to do weird stuff to you computer/OS, then install the dependencies by hand: virtualbox-ose-dkms, libgl1-mesa-glx\n\nA: I found this works for me (quoted from virtualbox.org forum):\nsudo apt-get install dkms build-essential linux-headers-generic\n\nIf you want further granularity you can install the headers as such:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)\n\nAfter this step reinstall the virtualbox related packages.\nSome people in the forum said that only the second version worked for them.\n\nA: here is solution which works for me on 12.10:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the latest version of virtualbox according your architecture and distribution version from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads\n\n*run sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-`uname -r`\n\n*run sudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup\nLast two steps quoted from one of the comments to the bug on the same theme - https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/virtualbox/+bug/1016165\n\nA: In Ubuntu 14.04, 64 bit, what worked for me is\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure virtualbox-dkms\n\n\nA: On 12.10, these solutions all failed for me.  However the following worked:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run command:\nsudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vbox.list\n\nand paste in this line, then save:\ndeb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian quantal contrib\n\n(replace quantal with your release's codename)\n\n*Run:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade\n\nto update your machine to the latest\n\n*Run:\nsudo apt-get remove virtualbox\n\nThen install Oracle's version:\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-4.3\n\n(replacing 4.3 with the version you are targeting)\nShould work now. Don't forget to download the extension pack from\nhttp://www.virtualbox.org as well.\n\nA: I had the same error on the VirtualBox start after the kernel upgrade. virtualbox-dkms could not be resinstalled because I used the latest (non-default) Ubuntu kernel and virtualbox-dkms has not been patched yet for that kernel:\n$ sudo apt-get install --reinstall virtualbox-dkms\n...\nERROR (dkms apport): kernel package linux-headers-4.12.14-041214-generic is not supported\nError!

My solution was to totally reinstall VirtualBox, with the following commands:\n1) Delete (backup) the hidden VirutalBox directory in your home directory\nmv ~/.VirtualBox ~/.VirtualBox-backup\n\n2) Reinstall VirtualBox\nsudo apt-get purge virtualbox\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox\n\n3) Run VirtualBox and set it (Virtual Images) up again.\n\nA: This worked for me:\nwget -O /tmp/virtualbox.patch 'http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?msg=99;filename=vbox-wheezy.patch;att=1;bug=696011'\ncd /usr/src/virtualbox-4.1.12/\npatch -p4 < /tmp/virtualbox.patch\ndkms autoinstall\n\n\nA: I had this problem in Kubuntu Vivid. I was struggling for a long time with the error \"Your kernel headers for kernel 3.13.0-36-generic cannot be found.\", and apt-get was unable to find it in the repositories. \nThe solution was to add a repository from trusty \ndeb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty-security main \n\nto /etc/apt/sources.list, and install with \nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r \n\nand then run \nsudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup\n\n\nA: I am using Ubuntu 14.04, I was having similar problem.My problem is solved  by using below command for virtualbox installation: \nsudo sh -c \"echo 'deb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian '$(lsb_release -cs)' contrib non-free' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/virtualbox.list\" && wget -q http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian/oracle_vbox.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add - && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install virtualbox-5.0\n\nActually it will remove your current version of Virtualbox and will install virtualbox-5.0 from the  oracle maintained repository.\nThe above command is available at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VirtualBox/Installation\n\nA: i had this problem with Kubuntu 14.04.3 + virtualbox 4.3.10 from standard ubuntu trusty repository and none of previous solutions worked.\nthe only solution was to add virtualbox.org repository and upgrade to latest virtualbox (4.3.32). you can do that with this command: \nsudo sh -c \"echo 'deb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian '$(lsb_release -cs)' contrib non-free' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/virtualbox.list\" && wget -q http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian/oracle_vbox.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add - && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install virtualbox-4.3\n\n\nA: Not sure where else to drop this but for purposes of completeness: I had the same problem after an upgrade to 15.10.  I tried everything mentioned in this post and others to no avail.  My problem was that I kept missing hints that the root problem was with the kernel itself.  It wasn't properly updated during the upgrade from 15.04 to 15.10.  Mine was solved by Ubuntu kernel not updating with 15.10 which I then followed up with both of the \"sudo dpkg-reconfigure\" mentioned in answers here.\n\nA: If I remember correctly I installed virtual-box using the .deb downloaded from the virtual box site, on 15.10. I fixed this problem by simply installing this package:\n$ sudo apt-get install virtualbox-dkms\n\n\nA: None of the answers mention simple solution which works for me.\nsudo /usr/lib/virtualbox/vboxdrv.sh setup\n\nI have Ubuntu 15.10 and Oracle VM 5.0.20. I've found the solution in vbox ticket.\n\nA: I am on Linux Mint Rafaela 17.2, but with kernel update to v4.4 (xenial, 4.4.0-57).\nSince it is based on Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty), I added this PPA:\nhttps://www.ubuntuupdates.org/ppa/virtualbox.org_contrib?dist=trusty\npurged old v5.0 and installed latest VirtualBox:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-5.1\n\nVoila!\n\nA: Having upgraded my kernel recently I was unable to boot any images.\nI ran\nsudo apt-get purge virtualbox\n\nThen I added the 5.1v of virtualbox. I am using Mint, so I ran lsb_release -c to see which version I was using, which was sarah for me, so I added\ndeb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian sarah contrib\n\nBut for Ubuntu users, edit /etc/apt/sources.list file and add one of the following lines according to your distribution to your system:\n\n\n*\n\n*For Ubuntu 17.04 (\"Zesty\")\ndeb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian zesty contrib\n\n\n*For Ubuntu 16.04 (\"Xenial\")\ndeb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian xenial contrib\n\n\n*For Ubuntu 14.04 (\"Trusty\")\ndeb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian trusty contrib\n\nNow get the cert for these\nwget -q https://www.virtualbox.org/download/oracle_vbox_2016.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -\nwget -q https://www.virtualbox.org/download/oracle_vbox.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -\n\nThen update and install\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-5.1\n\nNow you can freely open VB... or at least I could.\n", "Q: Gnome-font-manager missing on GNOME3?

Here is how I would have done it when I used to use Kubunty\nIn konsole in kubuntu type \nsudo kate /etc/apt/sources.list\nThen insert a # in front of all but the security releases\nHit save\nClose \nThen run:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nHope that helps.\nLet us know if you get stuck\n\nA: You don't have to apply every update KPackageKit comes up with.  You can check off the ones you require selectively.\nYou can also use Synaptic, which will list packages and you can pick them off as required.\n\nA: The \"important\" updates in the Ubuntu update manager are security updates, I believe. They won't necessarily improve your systems stability. If you don't know what program is crashing, then you cannot easily decide which updates should be installed. Of course, kernel updates are always a good bet. You'll need to select your updates manually, though, if you don't want to just install all of them.\nNote that if your network connection is severed during the download process, when you restart the updates, the download will resume from where it left off. So you don't need to download everything at once for it to work.\n\nA: For packages that are already installed, you can use sudo apt-get install $packagename to force upgrade of just that package.\n", "Q: Slowdowns while using Firefox I have Windows 7 and Natty installed on my computer.

When I use my bluetooth mouse, however, I would like the buttons to have a left-handed layout.  In 11.04 (Natty) I can configure this manually using xinput, but I would like to have it applied automatically when the mouse is connected.  I have followed the xorg documentation by creating /etc/X11/xorg.conf/99-ms500mouse.conf and placing the following into it:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"Microsoft Bluetooth Mouse 5000 button remap\"\n    MatchProduct \"Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000\"\n    MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n    Option \"ButtonMapping\"      \"3 2 1 4 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\nEndSection\n\nThis seems to work initially (GDM seems to be using it correctly), but when I log in and start my X session, the buttons are mysteriously reverted:\n\n$ xinput get-button-map \"Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000\"\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n\nThe following is my /var/log/Xorg.0.log:\n[   276.648] (II) config/udev: Adding input device Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000 (/dev/input/mouse1)\n[   276.648] (II) No input driver/identifier specified (ignoring)\n[   276.649] (II) config/udev: Adding input device Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000 (/dev/input/event14)\n[   276.649] (**) Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000: Applying InputClass \"evdev pointer catchall\"\n[   276.649] (**) Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000: Applying InputClass \"Microsoft Bluetooth Mouse 5000 button remap\"\n[   276.649] (II) Using input driver 'evdev' for 'Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000'\n[   276.649] (II) Loading /usr/lib/xorg/modules/input/evdev_drv.so\n[   276.649] (**) Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000: always reports core events\n[   276.649] (**) Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000: Device: \"/dev/input/event14\"\n[   276.670] (**) Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000: ButtonMapping '3 2 1 4 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0'\n[   276.670] (--) Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000: Found 8 mouse buttons\n[   276.670] (--) Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000: Found scroll wheel(s)\n[   276.670] (--) Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000: Found relative axes\n[   276.670] (--) Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000: Found x and y relative axes\n[   276.670] (--) Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000: Found absolute axes\n[   276.670] (II) evdev-grail: failed to open grail, no gesture support\n[   276.670] (II) Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000: Configuring as mouse\n[   276.670] (II) Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000: Adding scrollwheel support\n[   276.670] (**) Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000: YAxisMapping: buttons 4 and 5\n[   276.670] (**) Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000: EmulateWheelButton: 4, EmulateWheelInertia: 10, EmulateWheelTimeout: 200\n[   276.670] (**) Option \"config_info\" \"udev:/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1a.1/usb4/4-2/4-2:1.0/bluetooth/hci0/hci0:11/input14/event14\"\n[   276.670] (II) XINPUT: Adding extended input device \"Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000\" (type: MOUSE)\n[   276.670] (II) Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000: initialized for relative axes.\n[   276.670] (WW) Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000: ignoring absolute axes.\n[   276.670] (**) Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000: (accel) keeping acceleration scheme 1\n[   276.670] (**) Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000: (accel) acceleration profile 0\n[   276.671] (**) Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000: (accel) acceleration factor: 2.000\n[   276.671] (**) Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000: (accel) acceleration threshold: 4\n\nAs you can see, it appears to apply the button mapping I want (that is, swap buttons 3 and 1 and disable all others), but once the session starts this is gone.

While it's possible to install 32-bit Java on 64-bit Linux, usually there's no reason to (and you need to install extra dependencies to do it).\nSecond, clean up the old extracted files if the first installation attempt fails. Yo shouldn't have to \"sudo\" to install.\nThird, don't try to \"sh\" the installer; instead, just make it executable (therefore you aren't relying on finding the right \"sh\" in your PATH):\n$ chmod a+x ./jdk-6u25-linux-i586.bin\n$ ./jdk-6u25-linux-i586.bin\n\nLastly, although you want to manually install the jdk.bin, you can first try to install the packaged JDK, to make sure you have all the dependencies.

The GUI is herky-jerky and before it was fine. \nI want to go back to what I had before.\nIs there a way of rolling back/uninstalling the 11.04 upgrade or do I have to clean install 10.x?\n\nA: Since you are new here: Could you do us favor before your do? See if you are running the recommended videocard driver.There have been issues with running the latest one. \nUbuntu 11.04 should not be alot slower than 10.10. Booting is a bit slower, ok but not alot to make a difference. The desktop itself should not be slower.\nIf you do want to go back to 10.10: reinstall is indeed the best option. It is the best option to make sure nothing from 11.04 stays on your system what could possible disturn your 10.04 setup.\nBesides the link Takkat posted also have a look at the other questions on the right hand side under 'related' with almost the same titles since Duplicate questions do get closed on askubuntu.\n", "Q: Switching between Kubuntu and Ubuntu without re-installation I have Kubuntu 11.04 installed on my laptop, and I want to try, and probably switch to, Gnome-based Ubuntu.

I tried it before, but every time I had unwanted leftovers - The welcome or shutdown screen didn't change, dangling packages remained, etc.\nFor generality, the question goes also the other way around: How can one replace the KDE-based distro with Gnome, without any leftovers?\nIs there a systematic way to completely replace Kubuntu <-> Ubuntu, and make sure that the only remaining things are the home partition?\n\nA: To have both installed, you can install ubuntu-dekstop for Gnome-based ubuntu, and kubuntu-desktop for Kubuntu.\nIf you have both installed, you can configure the default display manager with\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm    (or kdm)\n\nEither way you can choose whether to use Gnome or KDE at the login screen.\nTo remove one, you can uninstall ubuntu-desktop or kubuntu-desktop, then run\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nDepending on any additional packages you installed, some dangling packages may remain.\nIf you have a separate home partition, you can just reinstall Ubuntu/Kubuntu, formatting your root partition, without touching anything in your home partition. This will give you a clean installation, except for some config files remaining in your home partition.

Is there any editor/IDE(or a plugin for an existing editor like Vim or GEdit) that does auto-completion of many languages (not just C++)? Aptana does only HTML/CSS/JS and Code::Blocks does only C++ (I might be wrong on this one. If so, please correct me). \nIn Windows, Notepad++ does a pretty neat job.\n\nA: Vim has a couple different forms of completion built-in for many programming languages.  Good places to start might be \":help 'complete'\" and looking up omni-completion.\n\nA: Personally, I like NetBeans. It is multi-lingual, C++, Java, PHP to name a few, and what I like most about it, is that NetBeans unlike any other IDE looks inside the header files you have included and auto-completes not only the keywords and local variable names, but also more sophisticated names (for example, I use GTKmm library and NetBeans not only list me all possible completions, but also provides me with a documentation of any function I choose).\nFrom my own research NetBeans is (unfortunately) the only IDE capable of that, so you may want to give it a try.\n\nA: Editors in Unix can tend to set of language flame wars if one isn't careful. This is not my intention here at all. I started out using vim for code development and at some point shifted to emacs where I've stayed ever since, and that was over a decade ago. I have it configured to do autocompletion of all the languages I use (C/C++, Lisp, Python, Perl). But like any powerful editor it has a learning curve. \nBut vi/m is no different - I know hard core hackers who have it configured to do the same kinds of things I do. I think what it comes down to on some level is how you are wired - they're both extremely capable, very powerful code editors with more features than most people will ever be able to learn to use. \nThe problem I've noticed over the years with the IDE environments is that they may have a much shallower learning curve, but there's a reason for it. You have to gain elevation sometime if you want to get somewhere. A really good editor will force you to learn a lot of stuff early on and then get out of your way. The other ones don't force you to learn much (worth knowing) but are forever in your way after that. \nJust my two cents. \njkcunningham\n\nA: Gedit provides a word completion plugin although I've not actually used it. Install gedit-plugins and you'll have it.\n\nA: Using an IDE is highly personal but do also have a look at Geany. Do not let the rather basic website fool you: Geany supports a lot of languages out of the box and is very small (just 9Mb). \n\nA: Komodo Edit is a personal favourite and supports auto-completion, along with great other features ; look here for more details : http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit\n\nA: I would vote for sublime_text http://www.sublimetext.com/\n\nA: Emacs has autocompletion for most programming languages that it can handle.

There is an option to specify a key to be used to access 5th level on the keyboard in gnome-keyboard-properties (\"Keyboard\" under Hardware in System settings):\n\nBut if I set the 5th level to AltGr and the third level to Right Ctrl and if I set key 54 as follows:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 54 = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\"\n\nI get following results from pressing different variations: \nkeycode 54 = 1\nkeycode 54 + right ctrl = 5\nkeycode 54 + right ctrl + shift = 6\nkeycode 54 + shift = 2\nkeycode 54 + AltGr = 1\nkeycode 54 + AltGr + shift = 2\n\n\n\n*\n\n*So what does the 5th level modifier do?\n\n*How do I set it up so that I can get 5 or six different characters out of a single key (modified by Shift, Alt Gr and Right Ctrl for example)?\n\nA: Well, after a bit of digging:\n(1) Key to choose 5th level does some weird stuff (regarding some French layouts) that is not relevant to what I wanted to do. Basically it sets which key is going to act as ISO_Level5_Shift. ISO_Level5_Shift is used in some obscure layouts. This answer is based on the number of results google gives when searching for \"ISO_Level5_Shift\" and on these links.\n(2) It cannot be used to get 6 symbols out of one physical key. One way to achieve this is with the use of file .xmodmap placed in $HOME directory.\nFirst, command \nxmodmap -pm\n\ngives what keysymbols act as various modifiers. On my system it was like follows:\nxmodmap:  up to 4 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):\n\nshift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)\nlock        Caps_Lock (0x9)\ncontrol     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x69)\nmod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Meta_L (0xcd)\nmod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)\nmod3        \nmod4        Super_L (0x85),  Super_R (0x86),  Super_L (0xce),  Hyper_L (0xcf)\nmod5        ISO_Level3_Shift (0x5c)\n\nmod3 needs to set up in order to use 6 symbols with one key. This needs to be placed into .xmodmap file:\nclear mod3\nclear mod5\nkeycode 94 = Mode_switch\nadd mod3 = Mode_switch\nadd mod5 = ISO_Level3_Shift\n\nThen xmodmap -pm gave me:\nshift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)\nlock        Caps_Lock (0x9)\ncontrol     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x69)\nmod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Meta_L (0xcd)\nmod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)\nmod3        Mode_switch (0x5e),  Mode_switch (0xcb)\nmod4        Super_L (0x85),  Super_R (0x86),  Super_L (0xce),  Hyper_L (0xcf)\nmod5        ISO_Level3_Shift (0x5c),  ISO_Level3_Shift (0x6c)\n\nWhere keycode 94 is the key I chose to act as mod3. Keycodes of various physical keys can be found with the command line tool xev (just run it and press various keys, keycodes will show up).\nThen, if I place into .xmodmap file \nkeycode 54 = 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nor run \nxmodmap -e \"keycode 54 = 1 2 3 4 5 6\"\n\nI get six different symbols out of one key with using altgr, shift and keycode 94 (it is a useless key next to left shift on my physical layout).\nUPDATE: if you need just five symbols, it is handy to set it up like this:\nkeycode 54 = 1 2 3 3 5 6\n\nIt occasionaly happens to me that I get 4 instead of 3 otherwise.\n\nA: “1. So what does the 5th level modifier do?”\nIt chooses the fifth level.  The 2nd level modifier (just regular shift)\nchooses the second level, and the 3rd level chooses the third level.\nThe reason that the 5th level modifier chooses the fifth level instead\nof the fourth level (right after the 3rd level modifier) is that these\nthree modifiers can be combined in different ways to choose eight\ndifferent level (this includes not using any of the modifiers, which is\njust pressing a key without any such modifiers).  There are eight\ncombinations since 2↑3 = 8.  For the first two modifiers there are four\ncombinations:\n\n\n*\n\n*No modifiers (level 1)\n\n*2nd level modifier, a.k.a. shift (level 2)\n\n*3rd level modifier (level 3)\n\n*2nd + 3rd modifier (level 4)\n\n\nAdding the third modifier (5th level) adds four more levels.\n“2.  How do I set it up so that I can get 5 or six different characters\nout of a single key (modified by Shift, Alt Gr and Right\nCtrl for example)?”\nFirst of all you need a layout which uses five or more characters per\nkey.  You can choose an existing layout, but if you simply want to add\nmore levels to the layout you are currently using, that might not be\noptimal.  For example, there is the Neo keyboard layout (†1), but that\nis “optimized for the German Language” so not that great for most\nEnglish speakers.\nStill, it might be instructive to have a look at what keys Neo has\nchosen for the level 5 modifier.\n\nNeo apparently calls the level 5 modifier for “Mod4”.  So as you can see\nit uses the key to the right of the left shift key (LSGT) and the\nright alt key/AltGr key.  This is on a European keyboard (105 keys)\nwhich compared to the US keyboard (104 keys) has a narrow left shift and\ntall and thin return key.  For a keyboard layout which is based on the\nUS keyboard one might have to—or prefer to—choose other keys.\nChoosing a level 5 modifier key\nIn sup’s answer he chooses to use Xmodmap.  Nowadays tools like\nSetxkbmap is recommended over Xmodmap.  Xkb comes with many predefined\noptions for things like choosing the level 5 modifier.  If you consult\nman xkeyboard-config and search for lv5 you’ll find these options:\n┌──────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│ Option               │ Description                                       │\n├──────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│ lv5:lsgt_switch_lock │ <Less/Greater> chooses 5th level; acts as onetime │\n│                      │ lock when pressed together with another 5th level │\n│                      │ chooser                                           │\n├──────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│ lv5:ralt_switch_lock │ Right Alt chooses 5th level; acts as onetime lock │\n│                      │ when pressed together with another 5th level      │\n│                      │ chooser                                           │\n├──────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│ lv5:lwin_switch_lock │ Left Win chooses 5th level; acts as onetime lock  │\n│                      │ when pressed together with another 5th level      │\n│                      │ chooser                                           │\n├──────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│ lv5:rwin_switch_lock │ Right Win chooses 5th level; acts as onetime lock │\n│                      │ when pressed together with another 5th level      │\n│                      │ chooser                                           │\n└──────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\nSo the options that are documented are the LSGT key, the right alt\nkey, the right Windows key, and the left Windows key.  As we’ve seen,\nNeo uses the first two options.\nSay you want to use the lv5:ralt_switch_lock option with some layout.\nThis command sets up the us layout with this level 5 modifier key:\nsetxkbmap -option \"lv5:ralt_switch_lock\" us\n\nSo for any of the options which are documented in man xkeyboard-config,\nuse that as an argument to -option when using Setxkbmap.\nIn case these options are not enough and you want to define another key\nto be the level 5 modifier, it is instructive to look at the\ndeclarations for these options.  They seem to be in\n/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/level5.  The declaration for\nlv5:ralt_switch_lock looks like this:\npartial modifier_keys\nxkb_symbols \"ralt_switch_lock\" {\n  include \"level5(lock)\"\n  key <RALT> {\n    type[Group1] = \"EIGHT_LEVEL\",\n    symbols[Group1] = [ ISO_Level5_Shift, ISO_Level5_Shift, ISO_Level5_Shift, ISO_Level5_Shift,\n                        ISO_Level5_Lock, ISO_Level5_Lock, ISO_Level5_Lock, ISO_Level5_Lock ]\n  };\n};\n\nThe right side of symbols[Group1] declares what key or character each\nlevel of the key should produce.  This uses all the eight possible\nlevels since it is supposed to lock the level 5 modifier when pressed\ntogether with another level 5 shift key.  So levels 5–8 emits\nISO_Level5_Lock since all of these levels are accessed by holding down\nthe level 5 shift and some combination of the other shift keys (none to\nall of them).  If you only want the shift behavior and not also the\nlock-if-two-pressed behavior, you can make a simpler declaration (from\nthe same file):\n// The right Alt key (while pressed) chooses the fifth shift level.\npartial modifier_keys\nxkb_symbols \"ralt_switch\" {\n  key <RALT> {\n    type[Group1]=\"ONE_LEVEL\",\n    symbols[Group1] = [ ISO_Level5_Shift ]\n  };\n  include \"level5(modifier_mapping)\"\n};\n\nAdding extra levels to a layout\nXkb layouts are pretty modular.  You can include existing layouts and\nalter them.  So we can choose an existing layout with less than 5 levels\nand add some levels to it.\nYou can make new layouts by copying the file with your layouts to\n/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/, or wherever it is that your Xkb tools look\nfor layouts.  But this requires sudo privilege so it is not the best\nsolution.  Alternatively you can copy the directory structure of xkb/\nand put your layouts in the appropriate directory under xkb/, namely\nsymbols/.  So say you have made a file xkb-tree/symbols/my-layouts.\nIn order to use layouts defined in this file, you can use the -print\noption of setxkbmap and then pipe the output to xkbcomp.  This\nwrapper script take the layouts as input:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# `-option \"\"` resets all options.\nsetxkbmap -option \"\" -layout \"$1\" \\\n    -print |\n    xkbcomp -I\"<path-to-project>/xkb-tree\" - \"$DISPLAY\"\n\nAs far as the file with the layout is concerned, let’s say that we want\nto expand the “US international” layout, which uses four levels.  First\nof all we set up the level 3 and level 5 shift keys in the same way that\nNeo does:\npartial alphanumeric_keys\nxkb_symbols \"mine\" {\n    // US international\n    include \"us(intl)\"\n    // Set up level 3 modifiers.\n    include \"level3(modifier_mapping)\"\n    include \"level3(bksl_switch)\"\n    include \"level3(caps_switch)\"\n    // Set up level 5 modifiers.\n    include \"level5(modifier_mapping)\"\n    include \"level5(lsgt_switch)\"\n    include \"level5(ralt_switch)\"\n};\n\nNow we want to add some extra characters.  Let’s just use the first four\nkeys of Qwerty layouts as an example.  These keys are Q to R, which\ncorrespond to <AD01> to <AD04>.  First we need to make the keys\ncapable of using up to eight levels:\nkey.type[Group1] = \"EIGHT_LEVEL\";\n\nFor the first four levels, in order to not redefine them,\nwe map them to NoSymbol.  Then we add two levels.  On level 5 we add\nthe arrows ←↓↑→ (†2).  On level 6 we add the direction keys.  Our\nlayout ends up looking like this:\npartial alphanumeric_keys\nxkb_symbols \"mine\" {\n    // US international\n    include \"us(intl)\"\n    // Set up level 3 modifiers.\n    include \"level3(modifier_mapping)\"\n    include \"level3(bksl_switch)\"\n    include \"level3(caps_switch)\"\n    // Set up level 5 modifiers.\n    include \"level5(modifier_mapping)\"\n    include \"level5(lsgt_switch)\"\n    include \"level5(ralt_switch)\"\n\n    // Make the following keys capable of using eight levels.\n    key.type[Group1] = \"EIGHT_LEVEL\";\n\n    key <AD01> { [\n        NoSymbol, NoSymbol, NoSymbol, NoSymbol,\n        leftarrow, Left\n    ] };\n    key <AD02> { [\n        NoSymbol, NoSymbol, NoSymbol, NoSymbol,\n        downarrow, Down\n    ] };\n    key <AD03> { [\n        NoSymbol, NoSymbol, NoSymbol, NoSymbol,\n        uparrow, Up\n    ] };\n    key <AD04> { [\n        NoSymbol, NoSymbol, NoSymbol, NoSymbol,\n        rightarrow, Right\n    ] };\n\n};\n\nIn order to use it we can use the wrapper script that we made:\n./setxkbmap-wrapper \"my-layouts(mine)\"\n\n†1: Neo is de(neo) in Xkb; setxkbmap \"de(neo)\".\n†2: In order to find the symbolic names that Xkb uses, search for a file\nnamed keysymdef.h.  It should be under a directory named X11/.  You\ncan also use Unicode names, for example U2192 for U+2192.\n", "Q: How to make Unity permanent and not temporary?

It is booting like normal but getting hung showing the wallpaper, without any panels loaded. The cursor turns to waiting circle (hourglass equivalent) and nothing happens.

Still not logging in. Panels are not getting loaded and Alt+F2 doesn't work\n\nA: I suggest, you boot your computer and wait, until your login hangs. Then you press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to get to the console and login there. After the login, move your entire home directory to a backup location and create an empty directory (sudo mv /home/ijeeves /home/old.ijeeves && sudo mkdir /home/ijeeves && sudo chown ijeeves:ijeeves /home/ijeeves). \nThis way, all application settings are removed from the normal place and you start with a blank account. You can move some of the directories containing the settings (starting with a dot) back to your new home directory, once you can login again.\nIf your home directory is encrypted (enter mount into the console and look for something like /home/ijeeves/.Private on /home/ijeeves type ecryptfs), you cannot use the solution above. Create an old directory inside your home directory (without sudo) and move all files and directories starting with a dot into that old dir.\nmkdir old\nls -a # lists all files & dirs\nmv a* b* c* d* e* f* g* h* i* j* k* l* m* n* o* p* q* r* s* t* u* v* w* x* y* z* old\nls -a\nmv (remaining dot files & dirs) old\n\n\nA: If you let it try to boot normally and run until it hangs, are you able to press Ctrl-Alt-F1 and bring up a console log-in prompt? If so, can you log in to that console?\nIf you can log on. Try creating a new user from that terminal and then logging in the normal way as the new user with a clean account:\nsudo useradd -m temp\nsudo passwd temp\nsudo restart gdm\n\nIf you can pick the temp user, log in as temp and it comes up fine, then your settings are at fault in your home directory and you need to figure out what to delete to get back to a default state of settings. \n", "Q: Install XBMC on Natty?

Thanks.\n\nA: I've had exactly the same problem using linux mint 11 (Ubuntu based) on a D510MO board and scratched my head for a while over it.\nThis is because the D510MO has an internal connector for a laptop display panel and it thinks that that is the display that is the primary and mirroring it to the vga output.\nUnfortunately because nothing is connected to the internal connector it defaults the resolution to a basic svga.\nWhat you need to do is go to your monitor settings if you have an applet for it and turn off mirror screens or same image on both monitors. Disable the laptop display and make the monitor the primary. Then all works fine.\nI now have a 22\" monitor and 1680x1024 resolution. Lovely...\n\nA: This works in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

I know I can go back to OpenOffice if I want to but Oracle seem to be more interested in lawyers than FOSS and I'm sure LO will be a lot better in a short period of time.\nThe only problem I have found switching is a strange (irritating) difference which doesn't seem to have a config setting that I can change. In OO When I select an image and insert a new one it will \"replace\" the original using the same dimensions in LO this is not the case the image is simply added to the page whether you select an image on the page or not.\nI did find an OO extension which provides the same functionality\nChange picture extension - http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/en/project/ChangePicture \nThe main issue is the extension doesn't use the \"working directory\" of LO so you have to navigate to the correct directory each time (censored). As I will be doing this for 4 pictures per document and over 1000 documents and possibly many more in the future my sanity is at stake.\nSo if any one has any insights on the easiest way to solve this one thanks in advance.\n\nA: LibreOffice is the same office suite that has been shipped in previous Ubuntu releases. Many of LibreOffice's first improvements were patches from the go-ooo project which were already being used in major Linux distributions. If expected and optimal behavior changed from one release to the next that is a regression and you should file a bug about it.\nThe OpenDocument Format is actually a zipped XML format.

At home I have a router which is A/B/G and here at home the wireless connection works just fine, using a WEP key.\nBut in work I have a B/G/N wireless router and it doesn't work, my guess is that this adapter works with N modes but somehow this is buggy in the bundled driver in natty.

I'm looking for a simple way to determine the rough amount of time per day I spend on a computer. This can be a difficult task if you try to monitor processes, key presses, mouse clicks and the like, because one can be doing anything from thinking about a coding problem, reading a web article, talking on the phone, or gone off walking the dog. The computer cannot read my mind. Since I leave computers on 24/7 monitoring log-ins won't work. \nI hit on the idea of logging how much time the computer spends in screensaver mode.

I used to access a remote system via VNC viewer, but when I copy some text from the remote system and paste it in my text editor(local system), nothing happens. Do I need to install any additional packages to achieve this task?\nUpdates:\nThere is no such option found in the Real VNC properties.  \n\nI just get the following output:          \nkarthick@karthick:~$ vncconfig         \nNo VNC extension on display :0.0\n\nUpdated: \nkarthick@karthick:~$ vncserver\n\nWarning: karthick:1 is taken because of /tmp/.X1-lock\nRemove this file if there is no X server karthick:1\n\nWarning: karthick:2 is taken because of /tmp/.X2-lock\nRemove this file if there is no X server karthick:2\n\nNew 'X' desktop is karthick:4\n\nStarting applications specified in /home/karthick/.vnc/xstartup\nLog file is /home/karthick/.vnc/karthick:4.log\n\nkarthick@karthick:~$ vncconfig -display :1 \nvncconfig: unable to open display \":1\"\n\n\n\nA: It depends on the VNC client that you are using.

Connect using vncviewer and run vncconfig within the remote window, check the options regarding the clipboard and then try.\n\n\nA: I use Remote login with vnc-ltsp-config with GNOME Desktop Environment on CentOS 5.9. From experimenting today, I managed to get cut and paste working for the session and the login prompt (because I'm lazy and would rather cut and paste difficult passwords).\n\n\n*\n\n*Created a file vncconfig.desktop in the /etc/xdg/autostart directory which enabled cut and paste during the session after login.

The VNC menu has entries for \"Clipboard: local -> remote\" and \"Clipboard: local <- remote\".  I have to copy some text, use either of those entries, and then paste on the other system.  I don't know if this is related to your particular problem, but it does behave like the symptoms you described if I don't use the menu.\n\nA: In a new terminal window, I used the command vncconfig, the command keeps running and you can use the copy and paste functions in other windows or terminals.\n\nA: The VNC viewer you are using has to support this feature otherwise you're just copying it localy on the remote system.\n\nA: Some commentary on your problem:\nRealVNC's is proprietary and it's clipboard support may be entirely incompatible with tightvncserver. I've used both, together, in the past but I don't remember 100% if clipboard sharing worked bettween them. \nI do know for sure that RealVNC-server paired with RealVNC-viewer did accommodate clipboard sharing; but RealVNC-server is not free (as in $$s)\nYou might try:\n\n\n*\n\n*tightvnc viewer from http://www.tightvnc.com/download.php It might be more compatible with whatever method tightvncserver used to share the clipboard.\n\n*or, perhaps you could go with an alternate protocol, ie NX (nxserver/nxclient ... some info at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NomachineNX). Clipboard sharing worked for me on that without any custom settings.\n\nA: One more cause for this is multiple instances of vncconfig instances running conflicting with each other. In my case i had custom vncserver setup, but the vncconfig started as part of the system boot conflicted with the custom vncconfig setting.\nTo resolve this kill unwanted vncconfig instances running.\nTo get the list of vncconfig instances currently running:\nps -ef | grep vncconfig\nTo kill :\nkill -9 <process_id>\n\nA: enter code hereThis below config works perfectly fine for Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.\n\nPlease freshly copy-paste/replace the below config to ~/.vnc/xstartup and restart your vnc.

The real solution for me is to kill the process klipper. Not sure why but this process is the root cause of preventing me from copy and paste from windows to VNC.\nps aux|grep klipper\nkill -9 <klipper_pid>\n\n\nA: Different vncservers locate their configurations in different directories. In case you can't change your configuration despite adding autocutsel -fork in ~/.vnc/xstartup, you could also probably run find if /etc/X11/Xsession exist, if so, you can simply add autocutsel -fork and restart your vnc session.

My external 1TB hard drive is connected to the front USB2.0 socket on my 11.04 box. When copying files I have a very slow data transfer rate rate of approx. 12 MB/sec maximum even though from the hard disk utility it says it is connected at high-speed USB (480 MB/s):\n\nThis the output of lsusb:\nBus 005 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 004 Device 002: ID 046a:010a Cherry GmbH \nBus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 001 Device 008: ID 1058:1001 Western Digital Technologies, Inc.

This it  makes it almost unusuable, even more so because I know it could perform much better.\nChanging the USB port to another one on the back of the computer and changing the cable to a brand new one did not make any change.\nIs there any setting I need to make in addition to defaults of my still quite vanilla but update 11.04 here?\n\nA: OK - font of all knowledge (!) wikipedia \n says that for a USB 2.0 interface, the theoretical maximum transfer rate is 480 Mbps (mega bits per second).  Hence I think the Disk Utility is incorrectly overstating your USB drive - this should probably be filed as a bug.\nI know there is an issue with NTFS, but from the screen-shot it looks like you are using EXT4, so this is not the issue.\nThe theoretical speed is max 60MB/s.  However, I've read various reports such as this (also look at the transfer rate article in the wikipedia link) that state that you could expect half-of this rate.  Thus, your drive is probably running as fast as it can.\nFor better speeds, use either a SATA II external disk or try a USB3.0 interface card + USB 3.0 External Hard-drive.\nSuggest also confirm your drive rate using some command line tools as described here.  It would be interesting to see how accurate Nautilus is reporting the transfer rate compared to the command line tools as per this link.\n\nIt is also worth booting with pci=routeirq in your kernel grub option - sometimes IRQ issues slow down hard-drive read/writes.\n\nA: Correct me if I'm wrong but Megabytes are not the same as Megabits...\nThe USB 2.0 standard states speeds up to 480Mbps... that is a lower \"b\" which means bits...\nNautilus says you are moving data 12MBps, that is a capital B, which are bytes.\n1 byte = 8 bits\n12MB (megabytes) = 96Mb (megabits)\nBesides, those speeds are \"lab speeds\" which means that they happened at the perfect circumstances but they always vary from hardware to hardware, much like the 56kbps modems never actually connected above 48kbps.\n\nA: I have similar problems after upgrading to Lubuntu 12.04 and had similar problems with Maverick.\nAfter updating Maverick last summer the problem solved itself.\nNow I cleaned my external hard drive with Gparted and reformatted it to ext4.\nAfter that the first thing that happened is that I got no write access to the hard drive. Only after binding it into the system as owner I got access.\nI find this really funny because it is an external hard drive and yes, I am the physical owner of them and they are just storage.\nYou do not have a problem with ownership on FAT32 partitions.\nTransferring files from my computers hard drive to the external made me sad because I had no trouble with it before and now I got some invalid file name errors. Since I have the bad habit to play a simple game when I need to wait for tasks to finish I opened Majong and thought first this might be the reason for the trouble. Then I realized that the error might be related to a few files named in another language and changed the system language to repeat the procedure.\nGuess what, it worked just fine.\nNow the thing I would need help with is how to alter the USB problem that was fixed with Ubuntu 10.10 and Lubuntu 11.10.\nThe second would be just a simple answer to why I need to have ownership established for an ext4 formatted disk and might use any FAT32 or NTFS without such a need.\n\nA: I expect it is a performance issues with NTFS.  Is the USB disk partition you're working off NTFS formatted?  What does your CPU look like while your copying these files?  \nIf it is I would recommend not using NTFS on the USB disk unless you have to.  \nIf you have to there is a known bug with NTFS-3G, though it doesn't list 11.04 as impacted.  There is a comment that someone has confirmed it on 11.04, but anyway some people have had luck with an unofficial PPA though they have on packages for 11.04 yet.  \nAnother fix may exist, if indeed this bug applies.  \n", "Q: How do I make the 'beep' command work?

Or you can just do sudo modprobe pcspkr for a temporary solution.\nas described in the accepted answer a more pleasant audible notification could be achieved through playing some notification sounds present by default on most systems such as (for gnome based systems) e.g. paplay /usr/share/sounds/gnome/default/alerts/glass.ogg \nnote that paplay (using pulse audio) might nowadays be the way to go instead of the alsa-based (but still working) aplay.\n", "Q: How to make update manager stop nagging about a new release?

I have a Mimo monitor and it runs USB. I tried and failed and I don't know what to do......All i get from the USB screen is just a green screen. Anyone could help me?\n\nA: You will need to install the xserver-xorg-video-displaylink package to get support for this class of devices (identifiable by connecting via USB and presenting a green screen on successful initialisation).  The X server does not currently support hotplug events on the USB bus, so you will need to create an xorg.conf file to use such a device.  An example xorg.conf file is included in the package (under /usr/share/doc/xserver-xorg-video-displaylink/examples).\nIf the above is not working for you, please file a bug against xserver-xorg-video-displaylink: there may be some variation between displaylink devices, which may not be handled completely by the existing driver (but any such lack of support is a bug to be fixed, rather than a result of user error).\n", "Q: System boots to a black screen after upgrade to 11.04 I was a similar situation to this user: Dual Boot 10.10 and 11.04 can't boot into 10.10 after an update\nOnly many more GRUB entres. \nNatty still worked - and I could still access the natty partition, until I ran sudo apt-get dist-upgrade to install a kernel update.

These drivers (especially nvidia) create a file called /etc/X11/xorg.conf.  This file gives details about resolutions and describes the actual driver in use.\nHowever, during the upgrade to Natty, the file remains in place - but the proprietary driver from NVIDIA is replaced by an open-source driver called nouveau.  Since the file is still in place, the underlying graphics system called \"X\" still tries to invoke the old NVIDIA driver because its relying on the instructions in the xorg.conf file - the NVIDIA driver is not there resulting in black-screens etc.\nFor these users, the suggested route is to remove this file BEFORE upgrading.\nHowever, this can be overcome by booting from a Live CD - the desktop CD.\nStart a terminal and type\ngksudo nautilus\n\nthen navigate to the folder /etc/X11/xorg.conf on your local hard-drive and either rename it or remove it.\n", "Q: How do I use the old clock applet?

It will give you more than text during boot, at least.\n\nA: try opening up your synaptic package manager and reinstall \"plymouth-theme-ubuntu-logo\" this worked for me back when i was using 10.04\n\nA: If you want to revert what that script did, do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a gnome-terminal (press Alt + F2 and type gnome-terminal).\n\n*Open the GRUB default configuration file (you will get asked for your password):\ngksu gedit /etc/default/grub\n\n\n*Replace the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=... line with\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\n\n*Replace the line starting with GRUB_GFXMODE=... with\n#GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480\n\nSave and close.\n\n*Open the initramfs modules file:\ngksu gedit /etc/initramfs-tools/modules\n\n\n*Delete the line starting with uvesafb mode_option=. save and exit.\n\n*Remove the splash configuration file:\nsudo rm /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/splash\n\n\n*Run sudo update-grub\n\n*Run sudo update-initramfs -c -k all\n\n*Reboot.\nThis should restore the old state.\n", "Q: How can I stop LibreOffice from randomly crashing? Libreoffice keeps on crashing randomly.  It will do this when I am typing and when I am switching desktops or anything.  There is no patter to it.  I need some help here.  Anyone had this problem or problem similar to it?   Anyone have found a fix.  Also it seems to happen especially prominently after my screensaver has started.  I would say it happens about 97% of the time after that.  This is an annoying bug and is keeping my productivity low.\n\nA: According to this thread http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1813246 and http://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=77851&p=456737 this problem is linked with the graphics card in use is Intel HD Graphics and on an Intel Sandy Bridge CPU like the (Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2540M).\nThe suggested fix is to disable anti-aliasing on LibreOffice. To do so go to the Tools menu, select options. Then on the next screen select \"view\" from the \"LibreOffice\" menu and then deselect \"Use Anti-Aliasing\"\nI confirm it worked for me. So far Libre office has not misbehaved after I disabled the Graphics Output options from the LibreOffice View preferences. Thank's to the mint and Ubuntu forums. That saved my day. I've been searching for so long...\n\nA: Since it is a Java error try to switch the JRE. Use OpenJDK. If you dont have OpenJDK install it.\nIn Libre Office go to Tools → Options ... →  LibreOffice → Java ( wait a little bit until the list of JREs appears) and then switch to version 1.6.0_20. When you highlight it, the location  should be something like /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre.\nHit the OK-Button and close all open documents or windows of LibreOffice. Then start Libre Office again.\n\nA: I would suggest that you delete the LibreOffice profile, I think this may remove the problem you are having with random crashing.\n1 - Go to your home folder\n2 - Press CTRL & H to show the hidden folders\n3 - Locate the folder .libreoffice\n4 - Right click on it and delete it\nThis won't delete any documents you have made, basically what you're doing is starting from a clean slate.\n\nA: Every time libreoffice crashes, it leaves a log file either at your home folder and at the working directory. Read that log to find out the actual source of problem. \nEven I do suffer the same problem. Most of the times, the log says the JRE has something to do with it's crash. As a non-developer, I do not understand :-(\nI find removing the option to use unstable-experimental features (its in tools>options) helped a little.\n\nA: I had the same problem, but it was solved after an Ubuntu reinstall. However, most people would use this as a last option.\nSome things that you could to to replicate the results would be to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the .libreoffice folder as scouser73 said\n\n*Remove and reinstall Java or OpenJDK\n\n*Reinstall LibreOffice (try using the latest version from the website)\n\n\nHopefully one of those will help. If you do decide to reinstall, remember to backup all files you may need.\n\nA: I solved this faster and I did not want to start with the long run first :D\nJust open LO. Go to settings and change which dialogues LO uses to save documents.\nSo change this setting to: \"use LibreOffice dialogues to save documents\"\n(Option under \"General\")\nClose and reopen LO and this worked for me. \n(I found out that my LO even crashed while saving docs even without any JAVA version activated in LO.)\n\nA: Edit: I've missed that Geoffrey is already using Sun JRE and so far it seems that OpenJDK may fix this problem. However the same crash was reported for OpenJDK.\nIt seems that the same problem was already reported for 10.10 without gaining any attention.\nAssuming that Java is the source of the problem and you use the default JRE (OpenJDK), you could try Sun JRE instead of OpenJDK.\nSun JRE is in Partner Repository, make sure you have this repo enabled.\nNow:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre\n\nYou'll have two JREs. You can either remove OpenJDK:\nsudo apt-get remove default-jre default-jre-headless openjdk-6-jre openjdk-6-jre-headless icedtea6-plugin\n\n(I am not sure what the default packages are, it's possible that you may not have some of these installed - apt-get will just ignore them)\nor reconfigure default JRE:\nsudo update-alternatives --config java\n\n(select /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/bin/java )\nIn second case, to be sure that LibreOffice uses Sun JRE, follow Alex's answer, just select the one by Sun Microsystems.\n\nA: I fixed my LibreOffice by reinstalling it.  Ubuntu was using an unstable version of Libre and that was what probably caused it.\n", "Q: Let Xorg listen on TCP, but only to localhost? I have some X client program which needs access to an X server. It is only able to access the X server by TCP, not by other methods like unix domain sockets. It will run on the same host as the server, to make things easy.\nSo, how can I make my Xorg server to listen on TCP port 6000, but only for connections from localhost?\nI found How to make X.org listen to remote connections on port 6000?, which explains how to enable access for remote hosts, but I don't really want remote access (for security reasons, mainly).\nI thought about somehow forwarding the default transport to TCP, but I didn't really find information about what the default transport is.\n(I'm using kdm as my display manager here, but I think I can transfer solutions for either display manager, or even switch the display manager.)\nAny ideas?\nThis is on 11.04 on a mixed Kubuntu-Ubuntu-XUbuntu installation (originally Kubuntu, but I added ubuntu-desktop and xubuntu-desktop. On boot it is now saying Xubuntu 11.04). I'm now using the gnome-classic desktop, I think, from KDM.\n\nA: The Xorg code currently doesn't have any option for controlling which interfaces to listen on.   It shouldn't be hard to add, but it should be even easier to simply configure your firewall to block incoming connections to port 6000 from other machines.\n\nA: Just some other thoughts ...\n\n\n*\n\n*Allow it but block with xhost (and/or network filtering)\n\n\nThe traditional way to do this is for the X server to listen on the TCP socket and use xhost to determine which hosts are allowed to connect.  See man page for xhost(1).  (Additionally, of course, IP address and port filtering would help here too, as previous suggestions have noted.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Only listen on local interface\n\n\nPer alanc's comment above, there's no code there now , but nearly!\nRemember that (almost) all hosts have at least two interfaces, the loopback interface lo0 (always 127.0.0.1) and the normal ethernet eth0 (or wlan0 or whatever, which let's say is 192.168.0.128) and many have more.  Usually TCP/IP servers (ie, X server) will allow incoming connections to any of their IP addresses on any of their interfaces, but most software will let you specify an IP address if you want.  The actual work is done by bind(2), which takes either INADDR_ANY (0.0.0.0) or a real IP address.\nThe Xorg server implements -name local-address but unfortunately this is only for XDMCP (see file os/xdmcp.c which implements it correctly as far as I know.)  The actual connection for the X protocol, I believe, is done by SocketINETCreateListener in the file /usr/include/X11/Xtrans/Xtranssock.c, which sets the address to INADDR_ANY and then binds to it without further processing.  What would be needed is the -from flag (which is dealt with by os/xdmcp.c as FromAddress) to somehow connect through to variable 'sockname' just before SocketCreateListener() in Xtranssock.c.  The problem, of course, is that all the transport things are really done in a transport-neutral way so it's a bit tricky to get the information into Xtranssock.c.\nFile paths and so on might vary, was looked at with Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, and note that the function names in Xtranssock.c changed by a macro TRANS.\nhttp://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/tree/os/xdmcp.c\nHope that's of some use.\nKind regards\nJonathan.\n\nA: Looks like a workaround would be the use of socat. Here is a command line which seems to work, if the X server does not already run on TCP:\nsocat -d -d TCP-LISTEN:6000,fork,bind=localhost UNIX-CONNECT:/tmp/.X11-unix/X0\n\nThen I can do\nxlogo -display localhost:0\n\nStrangely, it does not seem to work if I let it listen on 6001 and then specify the display localhost:1 instead of localhost:0 - I get No protocol specified.\nSeems I'll have to read the X protocol again. (And over JSch it then quits with Invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 key, but this is another problem.)\n", "Q: How do I check if I have a 32-bit or a 64-bit OS?

If its output is x86_64 then it's 64 bit. If it says i686, i386, etc. then it's 32 bit. \nHowever, the best way to determine the architecture is to run the arch command and google the output.\n\nA: Open the Ubuntu Software Center and search for lib32.

As a few wrote here, you should look what libraries you have/what packages you have installed on your system. So the safest way to see is to check if you have /lib64 and if it is a symlink to /lib.\nAnother possible way is to check what packages you have downloaded in /var/cache/apt/archive. If they contain _amd64.deb, it is a 64-bit system, that is, if you have installed packages and have not cleared your cache.\nAll of that can be done from Konqueror/Dolphin by just pointing and clicking or:\nls -la / |grep lib\n\n\nA: Have a look at your Software Sources in Synaptic or Software Centre. If you haven't deleted your original source eg cdrom, it will (?) indicate the architecture. It's a GUI but it won't say '32bit' nor '64bit'.\n\nA: For debian derived systems.\nOn 64bits systems :\n$ dpkg-architecture -q DEB_BUILD_ARCH\namd64\n\nOn 32bits systems :\n$ dpkg-architecture -q DEB_BUILD_ARCH\ni386\n\n\nA: To get reliable information about the OS, i.e. if the software installed and running on the OS is 32-bit or 64-bit, only two ways are recommended (using the command line). These are:\ndpkg --print-architecture\n\nand especially\ngetconf LONG_BIT\n\n\nA: I am not sure what you call an OS being 32 bits.\nTo be specific, my kernel and desktop distribution is a 64 bits Debian/Sid, but I routinely use schroot to run a deboostrap-ed 32 bits Debian inside a chroot-ed environment (for testing purposes).\nDo you feel that my 32 bits environment should be called 32 bits (I believe so) or 64 bits (after all, it does run inside a 64 bits kernel). In that environment uname -m says i686 and all libraries and executables and processes are 32 bits.\nFor practical purposes uname -m should be enough. The file command can tell you if an ELF executable is a 32 bits or a 64 bits one.\nSee the Linux specific personality(2) syscall (and also the uname(2) one).\nAnd the hardware information about your processor is visible with e.g.\n cat /proc/cpuinfo\n\nits output is the same in my desktop 64 bits system and in my 32 bits schroot-ed environment.\n", "Q: How do I remove icons from the Unity launcher using a script?

When ever I switch focus from SMplayer to a different application on the other screen the Unity panel shows up above the video. \nIs there anyway I can stop the panel from showing up when I switch focus to a different application?\n\nA: You could try upgrading to 12.04, there have been many improvements to the way dual screens are handled, and you can control better how the launcher works with dual screen (on System Settings > Displays, and System Settings > Appearance > Behaviour).  If it still doesn't work for you can you add more detail to the question please?  I am not sure exactly what you are seeing.  But try it in 12.04 first.\n\nA: Unfortunately there doesn't appear to be a way to stop this from happening. I've spent hours searching for a solution.\nI run into the same issue using vmware workstation on a second screen in full screen mode. In the end I had to install gnome 3 as this has the option to disable the panel on the second screen. I believe there is a feature request to remove the panel on the second screen in Unity.\n\nA: I also use a dual-monitor setup and have had the same issue.\nYou can fix it by setting the video to \"Always On Top\" while it is playing. If you're using Gnome Classic, as I am, just right click on it's panel entry and select the keep on top option. Then the panel won't appear over your video.\n\nA: I believe, using ccsm if you use the workarounds plugin and enable \"legacy full screen support\", you may get the desired result.\nYou can also use a tool like ubuntu tweak to stop unity from monitoring the second monitor, though this is probably not advisable.\n", "Q: Can I use Thunderbird to access Microsoft Exchange server? Can I use Thunderbird to access Microsoft Exchange server?\nEvolution works ok, I am just looking for an alternative.\n\nA: Your question is very similar to this AU answer.  \nIn summary - if your MS Exchange server supports IMAP or POP3 then thunderbird can be used as your Email client.  \nHowever, if you want to directly support MS Outlook .pst files and other MS Exchange capabilities, then Evolution is a better client to use.\n\nA: You should look into this piece of software which acts as a gateway between Exchange and mail clients. http://davmail.sourceforge.net/\n\nA: You need to use the ExQuilla addon. This is very easy to use, and allows you to set up your exchange account, even using auto-discovery if it is configured correctly. However, After a 60 day trial, it's not free to use.\nYou don't need to have IMAP enabled on the server for this.\n\n*\n\n*Go to addons, install a plugin called exquilla\n(If you want calender also install \"lightening\")\n\n\n*Go to http://www.1st-setup.nl/wordpress/?page_id=551 and download (you may have to right click and \"download as\")\n\n\n*Back in thunderbird, click \"Tools → addons\"\nThere is like an options button beside the search box on the top left, click this and select \"Install add-on from file\"\n\n\n*Select the file you just downloaded.\n\n\n*Restart thunderbird.\nTo configure\n\n*\n\n*Click \"Tools → ExQilla for microsoft exchange → Add microsoft exchange account\n\n\n*Leave everything as default, auto discovery worked a charm.\nCalender →\n\n*\n\n*Right click on left menu and pick \"New Calender\"\n\n\n*Choose \"on the Network\"\n\n\n*Choose Microsoft Exchange 2007/2010/2013\n\n\n*Auto discovery didn't work here for me, so fill out your email, username and fill the domain with \"your domain\"\n\n\n*I think there is then a discover button which you can click, and it populates the folder field.\n\n\n*I left everything else and clicked next.\nSo far everything seems good.\nI believe there is also an addon to read the exchange *.dat files called \"lookOut\" But I have seen benefits from this yet\"\nSet up your signature\n(If you need to copy thunderbird filters from an old account just quit thunderbird, and copy msgFilterRules.dat from your old profiles folder in ~/.thunderbird/blah/ImapMail/blah/ to ~/.thunderbird/blah/ExQuilla/email.vmware.com) All your filters copy... beat that zimbra migration!\n\nA: From my experience, its a 'yes' to Thunderbird reading and managing mail from Exchange, and a 'maybe' to sending email. I just started using Thunderbird with Exchange via IMAP.\nUnder Tools > Account Settings... I added an account. After entering my email address and clicking Create Account, it found my organisation's details, but they were incorrect.\nI needed to manually configure it to IMAP as the type; the server name was the same as the Exchange server (use your organisation's Outlook setup to find it); the SSL configuration was SSL/TLS; and I needed to change Authorization to Normal (Thunderbird incorrectly detected it as Kerberos/GSSApi).\nI had no luck sending email to users outside my organisation using the Exchange server, so I switched to another SMTP server that I could access.\nI didn't have any Exchange folders other than Inbox in my setup, but I've read that they may not automatically appear in Thunderbird. To show them, in Thunderbird right click the Inbox folder (in the list of folders) and click Subscribe... to check what folders are shown from Exchange.\n\nA: Yes, you can do it\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Thunderbird and click the Tools menu option. Click Account Settings. Click Account Settings again to start the process for the Exchange connection.\n\n*Enter the full name at the first window. This name is what email recipients see in their inbox. In the following text box, enter your email address. Click the Next button.\n\n*Select IMAP Mail Server from the drop-down window. Enter the Exchange server name in the IMAP Server Name text box. In the Outgoing Server text box, enter the Exchange server name again.

Click Finish. The Thunderbird application is ready to send and receive email from the Exchange server.\nSource\n\nA: When I was forced to pay for exquilla I deleted the add on and tried to set up my exchange account manually. To my surprise, thunderbird suggested an add-on called \"Owl\". Clicking \"install\" found all settings automatically. Later on I read that was also a paid add-on. But It gives the feel of native thunderbird account unlike exquilla.\n\n", "Q: switch temporarily to headless mode or runlevel 3?

Also very important is how do i re enable desktop mode again?\n\nA: AFAIK Ubuntu doesn't use the runlevel, in fact the /etc/rc*.d directory are the same. If your goal is to not run Xorg automatically just edit /etc/default/grub and modify the line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nin\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash text\"\n\nthen type:\nsudo update-grub\n\nto switch back delete \"text\" and re-run sudo update-grub\n\nA: If for headless or server mode you mean without graphical interface, it is sufficient to stop gdm:\nsudo stop gdm\n\nso that you remain only with virtual consoles.\nTo enable again the graphical login, start gdm:\nsudo start gdm\n\nBe aware that this can make your network stop working.\nTo avoid this it is probably enough to set the connection as a System connection in network manager\n\nA: Try running this command:\nsudo telinit 2\n\nThat'll make the system go to runlevel 3, if you want to get back to \"normal\" re-run the command like this:\nsudo telinit 5\n\n", "Q: Inconsistent wlan conection I have Ubuntu 11.04 installed.

Does anybody have an idea why the behavior is not consistent? My wireless card is a broadcomcard\n\nA: So it's 10 seconds most of the time. How long does it take in the worse cases?\nI think Ubuntu tries to establish a wireless connection every N second. Say it's every 20 seconds, then it can actually begin connecting anywhere from 0 to 20 seconds depending on when the system went to sleep and when it work up.

Why is this and what is the point? What I do know is that audio can distort past the normal 100% level in most instances but it's fine for when I'm playing DVDs.\n\n\nA: Overamplifying a volume is a good feature, especially for laptops where internal speakers are not loud. I was using this feature since Ubuntu (9.10) on my FujitsuSiemens SI1520. It helped me very much to listen to music. You can even more amplify a sound by using the VLC player where you can gain up 200% of normal sound level :)   \n\nA: I use it when i listen to speeches that were recorded at rather low volume. It might distort music/sound effects etc but it is rather useful in those cases when you just can't listen because of bad recording.\n100% is the actual maximum volume - 125 (if i recall correctly) is the volume they thought that would give you loud enough sound without too much distortion.\nMost players provide the same feature - smplayer's \"max amplification\" (with 110 as default) for example\n\nA: Starting from 9.10 Pulse Audio merges the sound mixing from ALSA. This has the side effect that you are able to increase the sound level to >100% if you need to. This of course goes on the cost of sound quality as pcm sound will get distorted when overamplified. You can disable this behaviour in PulseAudio if you want.\nOr, on Ubuntu > 16.04, whether the Sound Settings control panel volume slider allows setting the volume above 100% is controlled by the following dconf key. Run the following command to disallow setting the volume above 100%. Change takes effect immediately.\ndconf write com/ubuntu/sound/allow-amplified-volume false\n\nThis setting can also be done from the dconf-editor:\n\n", "Q: Screen brightness fading options I am using Ubuntu Natty on my laptop. While unplugged screen fades out, gets a little bit darker. It is great for the battery. \nThe question is how I can adjust the time before the fades out. Now it is something like 5 seconds.\nWhen I read I must hold my finger on the touchpad in order to be not annoying of the brightness shifts every time. \n1 or 5 minutes should be better.\nI looked for it in Compiz configuration with no success....\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: This should be configurable using the gconf-editor:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Alt + F2, type gconf-editor and press Enter.\n\n*In the gconf-editor find the key \n/apps/gnome-power-manager/backlight/idle_dim_time\nand set it to the desired value (in seconds):\n\n\nA: [Update for Oneiric - 11.10]\nI couldn't find the setting mentioned by htorque in Oneiric.\nInstead, in the \"Screen\" settings (open the dashboard, type \"Screen\", select the \"Screen\" application), there is a \"Dim screen to save power\" checkbox.\n\nUncheck it, and the screen won't fade out anymore.\n\nA: In Oneiric you need to use dconf-editor: \norg.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power idle-dim-time [set to whatever you want]\nIt seems like it would be easy to create an interface that enables users to set all this stuff. I don't like how Oneiric has all the config UIs spread out in little pieces now. It makes more sense to have a unified UI for power management with all the settings that most users are going to want to change. Definitely a step backwards.\nWithout a good set of default config UIs you get what we've always had on Linux: a bunch of overlapping config tools that help unwitting users fubar their systems.\n", "Q: I'm stuck on User Defined Session destop environment I just installed Ubuntu for the first time dual boot so I get to choose Ubuntu or windows. I then changed the setting where is doesn't ask for my password when booting up. I then installed Edubuntu desktop package. I then hit system and logged out that way i could be at the loggin screen that also lets you select the desktop environment. Edubuntu was not there but User defined session was so i clicked that thinking that might be Edubuntu and logged in. Now im totally stuck. Only walpaper on the screen as i realize now that is normal for user defined session but there is no log out button to change desktop environments now and since I set it to not ask for password at boot up there is no option to change it at start up. If i hit ctrl+alt+del it only lets you shutdown, restart, suspend, or hybernate.... no logg out. I have hit every key on the keybourd hoping something will pop up. I thought this must be a simple noob mistake that there must be endless artiles about this so did searches on google and forums and was shocked to find nothing about this. My next step unless someone can help is to uninstall and reinstall.\n\nA: Very similar thing happened to me, I am also new to Ubuntu (11.04) and was just experimenting and poking around and got stuck in User-Defined mode. Not knowing anything about Linux at all really, it's almost impossible to get out of there by just guessing.\nTry this, it worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right Click anywhere on the desktop.\n\n*Click \"Create Launcher\". The Create Launcher window should pop up.\n\n*In the Create Laucher Window, put \"Login\" for NAME (or whatever you want, it's not important) and put \"gdmsetup\" for COMMAND. Click OK.\n\n*You should have an icon on your desktop now called Login, or whatever you called it. Click that.\n\n*The \"Login Screen Settings\" window should open. You will have to click unlock and enter your password. \n\n*Now make sure the \"Show the Screen for Choosing Who Will Login\" button is selected. Close this window. \n\n*Use CTRL + ALT + DELETE to restart your computer.\n\n*The login screen should now appear instead of taking you directly into the user-defined session. Select the Ubuntu Classic (or whichever session you want) on one of the bottom tabs. \nHope that helps!\n\nA: Right-click on the desktop. Choose Change Desktop Background. Select All Settings tab. Then, double-click User Accounts. Unlock the administrator's account and turn off Automatic Login, then lock it again. Done!\nI realize this post may somewhat late, but this little desktop recovery tip may be good for all Ubuntu versions since Unity, I think. I am using 12.04 alpha and it did work for me. I am pretty sure it works for 11.04 and 11.10.\n\nA: I'm using Ubuntu 11.10 and I replicated what you had in user defined screen. All I did Ctrl+Alt+Del and a logout screen came one and I logged out successfully. \n\nA: You can go at \"keyboard preferences\" , then Options (bottom left) , then \"key sequence to kill the x server\" and set check that. \nAfter that , when you press control-alt-backspace it will force a log-out.\nFrom there you can choose to login wherever you want.\n(that is, of course, if you can get the menus somehow. alt-f1 bring the classic gnome menus - i'll go find the command that opens keyboard prefences in case alt-f2 works on your system too. edit : that would be \"gnome-keyboard-properties\")\n\nA: Adding in the Launcher with \"gdmsetup\" in the command works, but in my case, I had to turn off automatic login because it didn't allow me to ONLY change the session. I had to go back to selecting the user and change the session there.\n", "Q: Seeing Windows files from Ubuntu 11.04 \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I access my Windows partition using the command line? \n\nI have Ubuntu 11.04 on Windows 7, both sit on Macbook Pro 13, 5,5. Is it possible to 'see' Windows files?\n\nA: Yes, nothing is needed in your end in order to see them. You can also make windows partitions automount at login using ntfs-config (it can be found in software center)\n\nA: I don't think I clearly understood your question... nevertheless if you want to \"see\" your windows files from within ubuntu you can do it either by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clicking the disk device which should show in nautilus like this or...\n\n*Adding the device to \"fstab\" which is the Unix configuration file for filesystems/partitions/disks\n\n*Using ntfs-config\n\n\nIf you'd like to go with the second option than execute this command either from the terminal or pressing \"Alt + F2\":\ngksu gedit /etc/fstab\n\nThen you'll see several lines, add one at the end of the file like this:\n/dev/sda2   /media/Windows7_OS  ntfs-3g defaults,user,locale=en_US.utf8 0 0\n\nYou'll need only to change the first and second options, the first (/dev/sda2) is the partition that contains your windows files, the second is the \"mount point\" which is the folder that will show you those files. So change accordingly, if your disk is an S-ATA disk then it will be a \"sd\", the letter represents the order of the disk and the number the partition like so:\n/dev/sda -> primary master\n/dev/sdb -> primary slave\n/dev/sdc -> secondary master\n/dev/sdd -> secondary slave\n\nAnd if you have a laptop you will have only one disk for sure, so most probable you will have something like this:\n/dev/sda1 -> Primary partition on first hard disk\n/dev/sda2 -> Secondary partition on first hard disk\n/dev/sda3 -> Third partition on first hard disk\netc...\n\nSo if you have windows installed on your second partition (first partition should be the OSX probably) you may need to use /dev/sda3 since windows installs a hidden partition for boot since vista which would be /dev/sda2\nSave the file and close it. Then you need to make the folder where the filesystem will be mounted if it doesnt exist already, I like to have mine under /media which is the default folder that ubuntu uses (and so other several linux distros) to mount removable media for example, open up a terminal from the dash or press \"Alt + Ctrl + T\" and type this:\nsudo mkdir /media/Windows7_OS\n\nChange Windows7_OS to whatever you like, just make sure that this path is the same you added in your fstab.\nIf you find the above too hard you can always just install \"ntfs-config\" either from the command line:\nsudo apt-get install ntfs-config\n\nOr from the software center, search for that package.\nOnce you install the tool is pretty self explanatory how to use it. I'd post an image but since my reputation is so low it is marked as spam :P\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Why is Unity (Compiz) consuming more and more RAM? About 3 to 4 hours after turning on my PC, compiz 'memory usage' rose from 300MB up to 1.5GB!\nWhat is happening? What is wrong?\nHere is the screen-shot from system monitor:\n\n\nA: I was running into this, and just running \"unity --replace &\" was enough to drop it from 1.5GB down to about 110MB. I'm guessing Unity is telling compiz to create buffers that Unity is failing to tell compiz to clean up.\nAt least I have a reasonable workaround.\n\nA: It is a memory leak, probably in multiple places. It should be fixed by Compiz developers. It has been filed as a bug. Please mark yourself as being affected\n\nA: Report this as a bug to https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz\n", "Q: How to disable visual effects and compiz 100% UPDATE 1:\nThe problem is not a monitor refresh rate flickering problem, as then the whole screen would be flickering.  For me, only the application windows flicker in and out of view, then most of the time, when there do decide to show themselves, they only partly show themselves, like just top half, bottom half, left half, corner missing, window disappears when you try moving it or mouse over it even etc etc.\nI know it is a visual effect problem as I know my computer cannot handle visual effects and for some reason when the windows do appear partly, I can see the shadows behind the windows.  Those shadows are part of the visual effects which are turned on by default for some reason.\nI get the same problem with 10.04, but can quickly turn off the visual effects by right clicking the desktop, selecting change background image, and in the visual effects tab, I can click on none, which stops all the visual problems.\nORIGINAL QUESTION:\nI am having problems with 11.04 on my computer.  For some reason it is enabling visual effects by default in the live cd when it should not be as my computer cannot support such effects.  My computer cannot support Unity either, but it defaults to standard gnome with visual effects for some reason.  It should be defaulting to standard gnome with no visual effects.  THerefore, all I get is a very flickery live cd which makes it very difficult to see anything.\nSo my question is, how do I disable the visual effects from the live cd?\nTo put it simply, the live cd flickering is so bad, that I had to log back into my standard 10.04 install just to write this question, as I just couldn't see enough of the screen because of the flickering in 11.04 to even get to askubuntu.com...\n\nA: Try pressing F4 on the main boot menu screen and selecting \"safe graphics mode\" as detailed here, although I think this may no longer be offered in 11.04 as it is not included here. Are you sure this is a Compiz-related problem, as Compiz will typically not be activated if it cannot be supported by the hardware.\n\nA: If you can start 11.04 you could try following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start terminal by pressing super-key\nand then type \"terminal\" (without\nquotes) and hit enter.\n\n*Wait a few seconds, then type: \"metacity --replace &\" and hit enter.\n\n*If this works you can quit the terminal by typing \"exit\" and enter.\n\n\nIf that worked you can create a autostart entry in system settings with the command \"metacity --replace\".\n\nA: just go to your appearances tool and turn off visual effects.  worked for me.  Then, when you are ready to re-enable go back to the appearances box and turn on effects.  compiz will begin working again.\n\nA: A post here suggests pressing F6 and adding i915.modeset=0 xforcevesa to the end of the line.\n", "Q: Backing up /home/user I was thinking whether it is a good idea to backup of all directories starting with dot in my home folder, so that all settings can be restored if anything goes wrong. I just had an instance when I had to clear the home folder as Ubuntu was not logging in.\nAs my home folder is huge, I don't want to backup the entire thing. \n\n\n*\n\n*How can I backup just the .folders. \n\n*Will there be any permission issue when I restore.\n\n\nIs this a good backup option.\n\nA: Usually, I do backup to external HDD just several .folders simply by copying them in Krusader (I like this manager, because it recalls me old-time Norton Commander :) ).\nI personally copy the following folders:\n\n\n*\n\n*.mozilla (there are Firefox settings and other Mozilla stuff)\n\n*.thunderbird (copy of offline backup of my emails)\n\n*.skype (it's so easy to restore Skype setting and especially History by restoring this folder back)\n\n*.dropbox\n\n\nOf course, you can copy other folders (like gnome-related directories). But I like to configure it 'from scratch'.\nGood luck. \n\nA: It's not too trivial, becuase if you try to specify hidden files as .*, you automatically include involuntary . and .. - the current and above directory. \ntar -cjf configs.tar.bz2 $(find ./ -mindepth 1 -type d -name \".*\")\n\nI started the command from a testdir with ./ for find, because the browser-cache, which is quiete big, would take some minutes to be stored on my system. \n\nA: My trick for \"just the dot files\" is to use a path of .??* that is, dot followed by at least two characters. This avoids implicitly including the parent directory.\n\nA: You can backup skype history to the cloud storages via skyhistory tool  \n", "Q: Checklist for upgrading a very out of date install Background:\nMy last upgrade was from 9.04 to 9.10, and it did not go well.  I lost a lot of my settings and spent way too much time reinstalling packages that I though I already had.  Last April, I was very busy and didn't feel like spending all my time restoring the settings on my system again.  By this time I'd installed by hand some newer versions of software that where not on 9.10 (Ruby 1.9.2, MongoDB, Haskell 7.03 for example).  By the time life settled down it was September and I though I'll just wait for 10.10... You see where this is going.\nQuestion:\nI have a Lenovo Core 2 Duo happily running Ubuntu 9.10 32-bit.  I would like to upgrade to 11.04 (64-bit if it is possible).  What do I need to do to make this as smooth a transition as possible?\nAn ideal answer would be a checklist with links to askubuntu question that describe how to do that step.\n\nA: OK I have had to do this recently and often enough to have a plot! \nI would strongly recommend backing up your data and reinstalling from scratch. It has proven for me to be much easier and quicker in the long term and makes this easier next time\nWhen I have done it I also have to plan in advance (usual back of envelope stuff!)\n1 I tend to back up my home personal folders on an external hard drive (things like music/pictures etc). I usually wipe the whole drive but you may prefer if you have no external usb to create a new partition.I am not skilled in this.\n2 I check the backups work...check a few files and folders etc to prevent tears\n3 I then also back up the following \nfirefox bookmarks (as a .json file)\nevolution settings (export settings)\ndesktop backgrounds (depends where you save them but usually in usr/share) \nI then note all the applications I have installed and or need to reinstall. For me it is not many - Skype/Dropbox/Wifi Drivers/Samba/vlc etc and check the work in 11.04\n4 I then (like you have) check the live usb/cd rom works!\n5 If it does I install and wipe the whole drive following the prompts on the install procedure. \nWhen installation is complete I reboot and do the following:\n6 Make sure all the repos are ticked and enabled in synaptic package manager eg third party backports etc\n7 I then install all the updates and applications I need with one big terminal command which I can leave running which will update the pc since the release of Ubuntu 11.04.\nFor instance in the terminal last time I ran this:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nI then reboot and run this\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras && sudo apt-get install skype && sudo apt-get install samba && sudo apt-get install vlc && sudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source && sudo apt-get autoclean && sudo apt-get autoremove\nFeel free to remove any of the above that you do not want as it was just what I needed.\nThis has set me up several times now and except for clicking ok for some of the restricted extras there is nothing much to do. \n8 Install dropbox from their website .deb and that backs up work stuff for me\n9 Import both the firefox bookmarks .json and evolution back up and save them locally in my Downloads folder.\n10 I set up evolution from the menu at the top indicator using the back up file which saved me alot of messing around and imports my mail too.\n11 I then set up broadcast and chat accounts\n12 Import back the backup folders - music pictures etc and get some music back on\n13 Enjoy what you will find is a red hot new Ubuntu :)\n14 Have a look at other what to do now you have set up 11.04 guides like the excellent omgubuntu site here\nOMG UBUNTU \n", "Q: Dual Monitor results in 'greyed' windows This occurs in Maverick and Natty.

I want Nautilus to sort consistent with ls. In this example, I want it sorted:\nphoto 1.jpg\nphoto 10.jpg\nphoto 2.jpg\n\nCan I do this in Nautilus?

(known since 2006), but to many (myself included), it is more of a bug; but it isn't a bug, because it works as intended, ie. it sorts numbers as integers, not as text strings...  To be kind to this issue, it is technically not a bug, but just a case of: \"limited sorting options\".\nHere is bugzilla page on this point: Bug 355152 - Sorting by name doesn't work with digits.. \nA quote from that page: \"This is just wrong.

So, I do know that it is fairly easy to customize application shortcuts (launchers) by editing the respective .desktop file. But, is it possible to create custom quicklists to the removable drives' launchers? E.g. a \"Format\" option or \"Properties\" would be really useful.\n\nA: This is currently not possible because the menu items are hardcoded.\nHowever, if you think that feature should be discussed, you can write a mail to the Ayatana mailing list and elaborate on why it should be included. :)\n\nA: No, it is not possible. The pinning of the drives icon in the launcher isn't controlled by a .desktop file. It is added as UUID of the drive/partition. You can check this by using the command\n $ gsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Devices favorites \n ['A80C1BD70C1B9F7E']\n\nAnd for your information, In Unity version 5.14.0 (Ubuntu 12.04) there is an option named Format too. but no option with Properties though.\n", "Q: Windows XP can't access NTFS partitions created with gparted First, I know this may be just an issue with Windows, but I guess people on the Ubuntu/Linux side may know this kind of issue better.\nI just did a full system reinstall with new partitioning. I first wiped the disk during Windows XP install and gave 20GB to XP, the remaining space unpartitioned. Later I installed Ubuntu 11.04 and did some more partitioning: 145 GB unpartitioned (it had no NTFS support during installation), 15GB for root, 64GB for /home and 5GB for swap (all of these are an extended partition.\nUnder Ubuntu, used Disk Utility to format the 145GB as two NTFS partitions. Everything is nice on the Linux side, and I keep both NTFS partitions as shared data location.\nI just went back to Windows to try some stuff, and found out that it does not see the two NTFS partitions at all. I found a post of people with the similar issue, but they have no \"solution\".\nWhat can I do to make XP \"see\" my partitions? Is it some compatibility issue?\nThanks!\n\nEdit: ok, I guess I found the reason. The NTFS partitions on Disk Utility say \"Type: NTFS\", but Partition Type: Linux (0x83). Edit Partition button let me change the type, which I suppose should be HPFS/NTFS (0x07). I tried to change it, but then I get a spinning progress bar indicator that never disappears. I tried it also with unmounted partition and with sudo, but it never finishes the job. Every time I tried something I had to restart the system, but at least my partition is ok and usable (or so it seems).\nSo, if this is the culprit, how can I fix this partition type? Thanks again!\n\nA: Yes, the partition type needs to be 0x07.  Run sudo fdisk /dev/sda and use the t command to tag the partition with the correct code, then w to save and exit.\n", "Q: External USB hard drives - what speeds should be expected? Given the number of questions ive seen about slow usb transfer speeds I have to wonder what speeds should one be expecting for  a 'typical' usb2  and usb3 hard drives?\nA side question would be what would be considered a proper way to test these speeds.\n\nA: Ubuntu's Disk Utility program has the ability to benchmark a drive, with nice graphs and data. You can test the read speed on a drive in use, but I think the drive needs to be unpartitioned and unformatted for it to run a read + write benchmark test.\nI normally see about 20-25MB/s when using external USB drives, it usually won't go much higher, but it can drop quite a bit, and sometimes hang. \n\nA: I have several external hard drives and speaking from experience I have attained speeds of up to 20Mbp/s, all of which are connected via USB 2.0.\nThis has been the same speeds attained when I was using Windows also, and as there's been no increase or decrease since I changed to Ubuntu, I'd guess that the drives were running at their optimal.\nAs for the question of testing the transfer rate of a USB hard drive, I'm unsure what benchmarking software is available on Ubuntu.\n\nA: Typical hi-speed USB hard drives can be written to at rates around 25–30 MB/s, and read from at rates of 30–42 MB/s, according to routine testing done by CNet.[62] This is 70% of the total bandwidth available.\nAccording to a USB-IF chairman, \"at least 10 to 15 percent of the stated peak 60 MB/s (480 Mbit/s) of Hi-Speed USB goes to overhead — the communication protocol between the card and the peripheral. Overhead is a component of all connectivity standards.\"\nFor isochronous devices like audio streams, the bandwidth is constant, and reserved exclusively for a given device. The bus bandwidth therefore only has an effect on the number of channels that can be sent at a time, not the \"speed\" or latency of the transmission.\nUSB supports the following signaling rates: The terms speed and bandwidth are used interchangeably. \"high-\" is alternatively written as \"hi-\".\nA low-speed rate of 1.5 Mbit/s (~183kB/s) is defined by USB 1.0. It is very similar to full-bandwidth operation except each bit takes 8 times as long to transmit. It is  intended primarily to save cost in low-bandwidth human interface devices (HID) such as keyboards, mice, and joysticks. The full-speed rate of 12 Mbit/s (~1.43 MB/s) is the basic USB data rate defined by USB 1.1. All USB hubs support full-bandwidth. \nA high-speed (USB 2.0) rate of 480 Mbit/s (~57 MB/s) was introduced in 2001. All hi-speed devices are capable of falling back to full-bandwidth operation if necessary; i.e. they are backward compatible with USB 1.1. Connectors are identical for USB 2.0 and USB 1.x. \nA SuperSpeed (USB 3.0) rate of 4800 Mbit/s (~572 MB/s). \nThe written USB 3.0 specification was released by Intel and partners in August 2008. The first USB 3 controller chips were sampled by NEC May 2009[55] and products using the 3.0 specification arrived beginning in January 2010.[56] USB 3.0 connectors are generally backwards compatible, but include new wiring and full duplex operation.\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus\n\nA: I plugged my Toshiba external USB3 drive into a USB2 port \n- it copies files at 22Megabytes per second.\nIn a USB3 port, it manages nearly four times the speed - 82Megabytes per second.\n\nA: I have a 2 year old external Western Digital 500GB (WDBAAR500ABK-00) wich is USB2.0, USB powered, and HDDTune on windows reports an average transfer rate of 32.5Mps\nAlso I have a new Seagate e-desktop 2TB (STBV2000200) connected via USB2 (PC has no USB3, although the disk does) and it reports 33MBps. It is powered from an external source. \nInternal SATA2 7200rpm disk is 3-4 times faster\nWith my limited data, it looks like USB2.0 limits speed to about 33Mbps, and usb power is not an issue ay these speeds.\n\nA: I don't notice any difference when writing to the hard drive, only when retrieving data from it i do see a difference when it comes to usb 2.0 and usb 3.0.\nThe writing to the drive is as someone said above between 20 - 30mb/s and it can drop to like 1mb/s\nThe retreiving data however goes up to 70mb/s sometimes. (Copying FROM the drive)\n\nA: It also depends on what size files you are reading or writing.\nIf it's a bunch of small files then the speed will be slower than if it is one or a few large files.\nAlso the way the drive is formatted makes a difference.\nIf the drive is formatted NTFS it's usually faster than if it's FAT32, at least that's what have experienced after formatting my drive to NTFS.\nAlso FAT32 has a 4GB file size limit, NTFS is 16TB or more.\nThe only possible problem with NTFS is that some programs might not support it.\n\nA: @Seth: The hard drive and USB interface will fail / corrupt data if not enough power is available.  If you grow bad sectors, that's a good sign of insufficient power.  Most of the drive power is consumed by head movement and drive spinup.  Another sign of poor power is drive stalling during startup.\nAs far as the cluster size, you only reduce the number of times the OS has to allocate more clusters, which hopefully is a small percentage of the disk traffic, and other related CPU overhead.\nAccording to http://www.beyondlogic.org/usbnutshell/usb4.shtml the maximum USB packet size is 512 bytes, which explains why we seem to be topping out near 22 MB/sec on USB2.0 (my own measurements with 1TB transfers).  And yes, I also see dropouts where the speed isn't maximum, probably some low-level implementation/performance issues in Win7 or the chipsets.  During that time, I see a dual-core i5 getting about 27% interrupt overhead, which is about the maximum an OS can take.\nSATA and GigE are designed for streaming with larger packet sizes and packet management hardware offloading to avoid killing the OS and CPU.  Since I don't have a USB 3.0 host available, I can't comment on how well those chips/drivers perform.  I do hope that they bump the packet size - they do have 2-byte data length fields.  I use 4K and 8K jumbo packets, and it helps drop the workload measurably.\n\nA: I haven't done any study on the data transfer speeds of external hard drives, but I can tell you from my experience, that a USB 2.0 drive supplying a speed of around 20 MBPS can termed as good.\nWith USB 3.0 you can expect more at around 40 MBPS. \n\nA: This is good for those of us with old hard drives that we'd like to use in a caddy.\nDedicated externals might be smaller and lighter but their speed is restricted by the usb interface, so a really fast drive is somewhat wasted.\nOld IDE drives, even ATA33 models, should attain typical USB2 speeds and be just as usable as newer SATA drives.\nOkay, so I've just carried out a test using an external USB enclosure fitted with a Maxtor 250GB IDE ATA100 hard drive (7200rpm) NTFS format.\nUsing HD Tune I got the following results:\nUSB 1.1 port\nMin, Max and Average transfer speeds all 0.9 MB/s\nAccess time 19.2 ms\nBurst Rate 0.8 MB/s\nUSB 2.0 port\nMin 32.6 MB/s\nMax 34.8 MB/s\nAve 33.2 MB/s\nAccess 15.5 ms\nBurst 27.8 MB/s\nMy internal SATA II drive gave the following result:\nMin 54.1 MB/s\nMax 129.6 MB/s\nAve 101.9 MB/s\nAccess 16.9 ms\nBurst 191.4 MB/s\n\nA: Primarily I believe the power being supplied to the drive is external drive bottlenecking performance.  Say a usb port supplies say it's optimal of up to 1 Amp or 1,000 Milli Amps of electricity.  Now you look at a western digital 7200rpm 2.5\" sata drive requires say 2,500 Milli Amps to attain maximum revolutions which may spit out 100MB/s write over sata 2.  We then convert the interface to usb with it's limited power output of 1000ma.  It can only feed the drive 1000ma out of it's required 2500ma.  It reduces the power which in turn reduces the revolutions by 60%.  That 60% reduction in power leaves only 40% of the drive being powered over the 1A max output and that 1A is only of certified systems which state that they charge at 1A max or 500ma max or it could be that if your using only the hard drive over usb you attain that full 1A of energy.  If you use any other USB ports on the system your reducing the milli amp draw on each usb port since the usb interface would fry if it could power all usb ports at full 1a power unless specifically stated by the manufacturer.  So try unplugging all usb devices and only plug in the drive for a test, try using ps/2 keyboard/ mouse.  One more thing is the format is important for usb drives as well since sometimes you have to find the ideal cluster size for the interface/ drive limit.  So typically NTFS 64KB Clusters is ideal for any drive for optimal big end performance.  However some drives don't run solid at 64KB so I'd start at 8KB clusters, then try 4KB Clusters, and finally 2KB Clusters.  Format and copy a file to the drive and show details of how many MB/s it's getting.  Make a mental note of the speeds to it's corresponding cluster size.  Then use which one one runs best.  I would test 2KB, 4KB, 8KB, and 64KB and see which one gets the best maximum or best average.  Typically 64KB is always ideal but smaller sometimes results in a tiny gain on small file transfer performance, since 64KB clusters is ideal for large files.\nIf we could figure out how to feed our external drives extra power from say a 2.5A 5.0V charger which would feed it through a usb power splitter like say a high end AC External powered usb hub which charged each port up to 2.5A each.  Then you would be golden and will achieve optimal usb 2.0/ 3.0 speeds so we're talking up to say 64MB/s write on usb 2.0 and beyond 100MB/s on usb 3.0 ports if the drive will allow it.\n", "Q: Can my laptop run Unity, and if so, how?

I'm trying to get started with the Point Grey Firefly-MV USB camera in Ubuntu. I have followed the instructions from Point Grey, and got completely black images (Yes, the lens cap is off).

Any demonstration code would be helpful as well (display the image feed from the camera in a gui).\nThanks!\n\nA: May 16, 2011: Problem solved, see update below!\nAlright, after much poking and prodding (and a new computer build) I've gotten ROS, OpenCV, and libdc1394 installed and (apparently) functioning correctly.  I wrote a ROS launch file which should start the camera and display the output in a window on my computer.  However, when I run this launch file, I get the following errors from libusb and libdc1394:\nlibusb couldn't open USB device /dev/bus/usb/002/007: Permission denied.\nlibusb requires write access to USB device nodes.\nlibdc1394 warning: usb: Failed to open device for config ROM\nlibdc1394 warning: Failed to get config ROM from usb device\nlibusb couldn't open USB device /dev/bus/usb/002/007: Permission denied.\nlibusb requires write access to USB device nodes.\nlibdc1394 warning: usb: Failed to open device for config ROM\nlibdc1394 warning: Failed to get config ROM from usb device\nlibusb couldn't open USB device /dev/bus/usb/002/007: Permission denied.\nlibusb requires write access to USB device nodes.\nlibdc1394 warning: usb: Failed to open device for config ROM\nlibdc1394 warning: Failed to get config ROM from usb device\n\nFollowed by an (expected) error from ROS: \n[ERROR] [1305210297.868750292]: [camera] device open failed: [Camera1394::open]: No cameras found\n\nI'm assuming that this has to do with udev rules, but I'm not sure how to fix it (I'm unfamiliar with messing with udev rules in general).  \nIf it helps, here's the permissions for the particular device:\nbradpowers@bp-rosdev:~/ros/launch$ ls -la /dev/bus/usb/002/007\ncrw-rw-r-- 1 root root 189, 134 2011-05-12 08:16 /dev/bus/usb/002/007\n\n================================================================\nOk, problem solved!

I've used only VMWare on my Windows 7 machine, but I'd like to use something on Ubuntu.\nWhat software would you recommend to create other Linux and Windows virtual machines?\n\nA: The other option is virt-manager which is a gui for kvm. \n\n\nA: I previously used VMware on Ubuntu/Fedora (and shared VM's across Linux & Windows), for several years, but about a year ago I totally gave up on VMware.  It just became too much of a hassle to get it to work after kernel upgrades.   Now I just use VirtualBox everywhere (Winows, Ubuntu, MacOS X).   (Note: this is assuming you want to use a free virtualization solution, and that you're not using one of the various paid versions of VMware.)  I especially liked the (paid) version of VMware Fusion for MacOSX... but now I also just use VirtualBox there, too... and it works just fine.\nBut, back to Linux:  Let's say you can actually manage to get VMware running on Linux -- after downloading custom 3rd party VMware source patches, uploaded to various internet forums, then recompiling odd bits of VMware to get it to properly install... Well, you still will have a slim to none chance of getting the VMware viewer (browser plugin) to properly work on Linux. The issue seems to be that it requires an older version of Firefox to run.  You can use IE or possibly Firefox on Windows to \"view\" your running VM's on Linux, but, you know, what's the point.\nLong story short, the free versions of VMware no longer seem to be supported or maintained, and this is especially evident & painful on Linux.\nHowever, all is not lost... You can take your existing VMware images and actually open them in VirtualBox without converting the images to VDI (..or, you can convert them to VDI if you want, too.)  (Frankly, for non-Windows VM's, it is probably just as simple to create a new image, since installing Linux from scratch is so simple.  It's all the other software (databases, etc) that can be a pain to re-install, though.)\nThe one issue that I ran into when opening my VMware images in VirtualBox was that I originally split my VMware images into 2GB files; this won't work when opening them in VirtualBox. But you can use the VMware tools to convert them back to a single disk, e.g.:\nc:/> vmware-vdiskmanager -r multipart.vmdk -t 0 single.vmdk\n\nThen this \"single.vmdk\" can be designated as your disk for your VirtualBox VM.  Odds are that any Windows image will have to be re-verified as \"genuine\"; it's easiest to do this online when setting up the VM, assuming networking is working.  I think I first removed VMware tools from my image, and then installed the VirtualBox add-ons on the VM, and I think that was basically it.\n\nA: You also may use VirtualBox, which is named virtualbox-ose in the repositories.\nFrom the package description:\n\nVirtualBox is a free x86 virtualization solution allowing a wide range of x86 operating systems such as Windows, DOS, BSD or Linux to run on a Linux system.\n\nIn case you like to install an OS that uses XServer 1.10 (e.g. Ubuntu 11.04) you need Virtual Box version >= 4.0.6 available under GPL v2 licence for download or in a repository maintained by Oracle. For full support of features we also need to install Guest Additions. For USB 2.0 or RDP support we can download and install the Extension Pack. This will make Virtual Box closed source (PUEL-version).\n\nA: Im case you are used to VMWare from your Windows machine you can run the VMWare Player on your Ubuntu box. Although I do agree with previous answers that Virtual Box is a very good Open Source alternative there is no need to switch systems. This is even more so as you can use your preexistent virtual machines by also running VMWare Player in Ubuntu. However if you want to create new machines you would need to run VMWare Workstation.\n\nA: Despite Michael's problems with VMWARE I would absolutely recommend it for a number of reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*You are used to the interface\n\n*It works beautifully under Ubuntu out of the box, and even VM tools updates are simple.\n\n*Your existing VM's will just work\n\n\nI use virtualbox as well, and I would say for most purposes it is as good, but you'll need to learn it.\n\nA: To add to the list of solutions there also is a Linux version of the commercial Parallels Desktop.\n\nA: Update 2020/08/07 to add alternatives (on Ubuntu and its flavours) not referenced in the previous answers\nAn alternative solution is GNOME Boxes. It is a system virtualization application (based on the QEMU machine emulator) that is a core part of the GNOME desktop environment. It is a virtualization app that allows you to quickly create a virtual system without fiddling with too many options and choices. It is not a highly sophisticated solution like Virtualbox, or VMWare, but it may fits your needs if your requirements are not so complicated.\nInstallation: sudo apt install gnome-boxes\nFor details: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Boxes\nAnother alternative is Virtual Machine Manager app, that is a desktop user interface for managing virtual machines through libvirt (that primarily targets KVM VMs, but it is able to open the Gnome Boxes VM as well).\nVirtual Manager allows you to define the hardware properties of the VM through a graphical interface: the result of these settings is a description of the hardware in an XML format.\nInstallation: sudo apt install virt-manager\nFor details: https://virt-manager.org/\n", "Q: Is there an easy way to copy the music from my computer to my mp3 player?

In the meantime, you have a couple options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-Download Everything \nIf your podcast collection is fairly small and all of the podcasts are still available online, the preferred method of importing them would simply be to subscribe to the feeds in Banshee and re-download the episodes you want.  There are plenty of reasons that this might not be a realistic solution, but I thought I'd mention it for completeness.\n\n*Create your own feed\nIf you're familiar with xml (m3u or pls playlists might work too) and you have access to a webserver -- a local, private one would probably be best if you're dealing with copyrighted material -- you could create a custom feed with only the podcasts you want to import.  Simply import that feed into Banshee, and you should be able to get all of the episodes correctly grouped with the rest of your podcasts.  This came up on the mailing list recently, so that would be a good place to turn if you have questions.\n\n*Dig around in the database\nBanshee's database is stored in ~/.config/banshee-1/banshee.db.  If all else fails, you could try to open it with a database viewer and manually insert your podcasts.  There are 5 tables related to Podcasts, but without being familiar with the database structure for podcasts, I can't tell you with any certainty how the tables are related and how much of the information is critical.  That's definitely \"make a backup copy first\" and \"do this at your own risk\" territory. :)\nBased on the mailing list discussion, #2 should be a pretty promising option.  Hopefully you'll get something working.\n\nA: If Rhythmbox knows about your podcasts (i.e. they show up on your Music list, being in your Music directory, with the Podcast genre, but not necessarily in your Podcasts tab), you can do the following:\nFrom Banshee, go to Media -> Import Media.  From the menu, choose \"Rythmbox Music Player\".  This will import all of the tracks that Rhythmbox knows about, including your podcasts.  They won't show up in your Podcasts tab, but they will show up in your Music list under the \"Podcast\" genre.\nIf these don't show up as normal tracks in Rhythmbox, you can do the following to get them to show up:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move your podcasts directory inside your Music folder.\n\n*Wait for it to be scanned or close it, delete .local/share/rhythmbox/rhythmdb.xml and then restart it.  (Warning: This will wipe out your radio stations & possibly other things, so save a backup first!)\n\n*Podcasts should now show up in your Music with the Podcast genre (assuming that they were tagged correctly).\n\n*Give Rhythmbox and Banshee the new location of your podcasts directory (inside your Music folder).\n\n", "Q: How do I get the notification icons I want in Unity? I now have Unity 2D running on my laptop, and the jury is still out as to whether or not I keep it or go back to Gnome.\nOne thing that is throwing me off is that I don't have the same notification icons in the top panel that I like to have.\nOne is a CPU monitor.

I use both the built in keyboard and an external keyboard. I want to remap capslock on both keyboards to super, and I want to swap left-alt (mac option) and left-super (mac cmd) on the built in (apple) keyboard only.\nXmodmap can't configure multiple keyboards differently, so thats out. \nI am able to do this from the cli via setkbmap. Here is the script I'm using:\n#!/bin/sh\n#set caps to super\nsetxkbmap -option caps:super\n\n#swap command and option for apple keyboard\nsetxkbmap -device `xinput list | grep -o -P 'Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad\\s+id=\\d+' | grep -o -P '\\d+'` -option altwin:swap_lalt_lwin\n\nIf I have to, I can run this as a startup application, but I would really like to know if there is a configuration file I can add these settings to instead. \nIt looks like I should be able to add an option (XkbOptions) to the inputdevice section of my xorg.conf, but when I tried this, the settings had no affect (perhaps gnome overrides the X settings?). I also tried adding a new inputclass to xorg.conf but that didn't work either. \nWhat is the correct place to configure multiple keyboards with different key bindings?\n\nA: It is possible to do this in the xorg config:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n  Identifier     \"Keyboard Catch All\"\n  MatchUSBID     \"058f:9410\"\n  Option         \"XkbOptions\" \"caps:super,terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputClass\"\n  Identifier \"Apple Keyboards\"\n  MatchUSBID     \"05ac:0236\"\n  Option         \"XkbOptions\" \"altwin:swap_lalt_lwin,caps:super\"\nEndSection\n\nHowever, GDM has its own way of managing you keyboard settings that will overwrite these xorg settings.

There is no highlighting of the current window thumbnail. When pressing the Alt + Tab there is a border that appears to clearly show the active one.\nIs it possible to some how have a highlight of some kind on the spread mode screen?\n\nA: This effect is implemented using Compiz's Scale functionality.

I've tried going to Region and Language and adding a layout, even making it the default layout, but for some reason I'm stuck with my original layout and I can't seem to change it. In GNOME 2 and in Unity, there's a panel applet that allows you to quickly change between keyboard layouts, but there doesn't seem to be one in Gnome Shell. Does anyone know a way to get that applet in the panel (loading it manually?) or at the very least change the keyboard layout via the terminal? \n\nA: You'll find the keyboard layout settings in the region and languages setting panel. Go to the user menu, choose System Settings, then Region and Language, then switch to the Layouts tab.\nThe layout chooser and keyboard shortcuts (under options) should be pretty familier from the Gnome 2 days. Once there is more than one layout you should get a little switcher applet too.\n\nA: This worked for me... got to:\nSystem Settings --> Keyboard layout, tab Layouts --> Options...\nKey(s) to change layout\nPick any one you like, even multi options work for me...\n\nA: In the new Gnome3 Shell I needed to use the gnome-tweak-tool*. There I went to Typing -> Switching to another layout and selected my keystroke (\"Alt+Shift\"). Afterwards I needed to delete the keystroke in the Region and Language setting (Activities Menu -> Type Region -> Select Region and Language -> Input Sources -> Shortcut Settings). After restarting gnome, it worked as expected.\n*the old keystroke from the Region and Languages menu worked kind of, but no longer cycled through the list. Obviously there was some form of \"direction\" introduced and my keystroke was assigned to \"Switch to next source\". This means in a list of languages, in my case \"en\", \"de\", \"ru\", you are at the end of the list (for me \"ru\"), you need to press the keystroke twice (not only once) to jump from the last element to the first (im my case from \"ru\" to \"de\"). I of course could have assigned another keystroke to go back in the list (I did not like that) or press the key twice (though it was again another behaviour based on the language, this I wanted to avoid). As I often switch mid-document back and force, this was in indeed a big deal for me. I hope it is clear what the problem was.\n\nA: From https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/keyboard-layouts.html.en:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Open the Activities overview and start typing Region & Language.\n  \n*Click on Region & Language to open the panel.\n  \n*Click the + button in the Input Sources section, select the language which is associated with the layout, then select a layout and press Add.\n  \n\n\nA: In Gnome Shell 3.18.5, there is no way to change the keyboard layout through the settings panel at all that I could find. Instead, the settings are located in the Gnome Tweak Tool under \"Typing\".\nIf you don't have it, you can install Gnome Tweak Tool with\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\nand access it from the Activities menu.\n\nA: Here is some more updated information: as of Nov. '14.  I input Japanese and English regularly and got stuck on this after an upgrade -using ubuntu gnome 14.04\nI type Japanese and English, so here is how I did it.\nIn the Region/Language settings, you choose your input method, which implies the keyboard type.  So for Japanese, there is a simple \"Japanese\" setting, which has nothing to do with typing \"Japanese\", instead it is the \"Japanese keyboard layout\".  In order to type \"Japanese\", you have to install the ibus-anthy\" or \"mozc\" packages. After reboot, click the little \"+\" button and scroll down to japanese, notice the added japanese options for \"Japanese-Anthy\" and \"Japanese-Mozc\".  Add these, then you will get SDK input ability as well as simple typing with correct layout.\n\nA: Super + Space\n(The Super key is another name for the Windows key.)\nSince Gnome 3.8 it is the default keyboard shortcut for switching between keyboard layouts, see https://help.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/3.8/shortcuts.html\n", "Q: Connecting to other LAN computers using their names I have a LAN at home with my desktop and my laptop. IP addresses are allocated dynamically to both, so the IP number keep changing.\nI try to connect from one to the other using places->Server, and in there if I put the correct IP address I connect without any issues. But if I put the hostname, it doesn't recognize. Same thing if I try to ping the hostname v/s the IP address.\nThe funny thing is that I can see the hostnames if I go to places->network. So basically ubuntu has got a way of telling what are the machines connected to the network and what are their names, I wonder how can I exploit this to keep an up-to-date routing table that map the hostname to the correct IP address.\nPS, both desktop and laptop are running Ubuntu. I'm using version 10.04 and 10.10\nThanks \n\nA: Ubuntu comes with the Avahi implementation of mDNS service discovery (also known under Apple's trademarked name Bonjour), which advertises your hostname over the local network under the .local domain.  The standard hostname resolver will also do mDNS lookups.\nSo if you set the hostname of one of your computers to foo, you should be able to ping it from another machine on the local network with:\nping foo.local\n\nYou should be able to use these .local names with most software on Ubuntu.\n\nA: Depending on your LAN setup, many routers have the ability to rember and reserve ip addresses for specific machines, this would keep their names and ips the same.\nAlternatively you could set up static ip's for each machine. The network manager tool can do this,\nI tend to go both routes, my router gives dynamic ip's in the 192.168.1.200+ range and i set up static ips on most of my machines in the 192.168.1.100-199 range. \n", "Q: Using e-acute but not s-acute (on Keyboard USA International w/ dead keys) I want to be able to use ' + e to get the letter é but being able to type ' + s to get the sequence 's.\nDefault my Ubuntu 11.04 came with the keyboard layout \"USA International (with dead keys)\".

I know the AppArmor profiles resides in /etc/apparmor.d/, but I do not know how to interpret it.

Regarding your question about @{PROC} there are variables which can be set within include files.  From the apparmor.d(5) man page...\n\nSome of the abstractions rely on variables that are set in files in\n  the /etc/apparmor.d/tunables/ directory. These variables are currently\n  @{HOME} and @{HOMEDIRS}. Variables cannot be set in profile scope;\n  they can only be set before the profile. Therefore, any profiles that\n  use abstractions should either #include <tunables/global> or otherwise\n  ensure that @{HOME} and @{HOMEDIRS} are set before starting the\n  profile definition. The aa-autodep(8) and aa-genprof(8) utilities will\n  automatically emit #include <tunables/global> in generated profiles.\n\nIf you look in /etc/apparmor.d/tunables/global you'll see there's another #include <tunables/proc>.

You can create a profile for let us say, when working at night by adding some different colors on terminals output, you can use different fonts if you want so etc.\n\nA: To add a little bit to @Salih Emin answer, if you don't have yet created at least a second profile, there is nothing to switch to, so \"Change profile\" is disabled.\n", "Q: /usr/lib/ Symbolic Link Gets Over Written during boot To get the tri-monitor setup I want, I am using the libXinerama hack that allows me fake my layout.\nIn order to use this, I use a patched version of libXinerama and put it in /usr/lib and then change the libXinerama.so symbolic link to point to it:\n[kbrandt@alpine: /usr/lib] ls -l libXinerama.*\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  7286 2010-05-18 07:57 libXinerama.a\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    20 2011-02-27 19:59 libXinerama.so -> libXinerama.so.1.0.0\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    20 2011-05-06 11:31 libXinerama.so.1 -> libXinerama.so.1.0.0\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  8659 2011-04-11 09:40 libXinerama.so.1.0.0\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 10432 2011-02-27 20:01 libXinerama.so.1.0.0.back\n\nThis work fine, except on reboot it rewrites the link and points it to libXinerama.so.1.0.0.back which breaks my setup. What process is doing this, and how can I stop it from doing it?\n\nA: Presumably ldconfig is being called somewhere, and libXinerama.so.1.0.0.back sorts after libXinerama.so.1.0.0 so it is being selected as the newest version of the library.  \nWhy exactly do you need to patch the Xinerama extension's client library in the first place?\n", "Q: Where can I watch Mark Shuttleworth's Keynote at UDS-O?

You could do similar under Windows.\nFor security, no matter what OS you are running, do not allow incoming connections unless you know how to secure them, and then only allowing unprivileged usage limited to only those functions you need remote users to have.\nsvchost.exe is associated with a number of threats so your intruder may have been looking at popping it onto your machine. Of course it is a Windows executable so that wouldn't have impacted you on this Ubuntu box.\n\nA: As you can see from your screenshot, you have explicitly allowed unconfirmed, passwordless login. All desktop sharing is disabled by default, and if you enable it, you must confirm each connection.

It always launches a new window; it doesn't recognize that existing Emacsclient windows exist to jump to them.  How can I make it behave?\nAs background, this is a very useful usage mode for Emacs, where you run it as a daemon:  emacs --daemon, and then you summon an emacs window with emacsclient.  A good way to do this for habitual emacs users is to put emacs --daemon into your Startup Applications.\n\nA: Solution by james.ferguson works well.  What I wanted was to link emacsclient to so some file types as the \"preferred application\". For this, I found james's script with a new \"Exec\" line\nExec=/usr/bin/emacsclient --alternate-editor emacs24 --no-wait %F\n\nworks better for me: it runs a new emacs if none is running, does not open a new window and does not make emacs complain about clients still waiting for stuff to happen.\nNow I can click on files and they are opened in a running emacs, if one exists, otherwise emacs starts.\n\nA: The solution is to create an emacsclient.desktop file including a directive to it the class of the window using the StartupWMClass settings.  Without it, Unity can't tell that that window came from Emacsclient.  This will create one based on the contents of the Emacs one (/usr/share/applications/emacs23.desktop):\nmkdir -p ~/.local/share/applications\ncat > !$/emacsclient.desktop <<EOF\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nName=Emacsclient\nGenericName=Text Editor\nComment=View and edit files\nMimeType=text/english;text/plain;text/x-makefile;text/x-c++hdr;text/x-c++src;text/x-chdr;text/x-csrc;text/x-java;text/x-moc;text/x-pascal;text/x-tcl;text/x-tex;application/x-shellscript;text/x-c;text/x-c++;\nExec=/usr/bin/emacsclient -c %F\nIcon=/usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/emacs23.svg\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nCategories=Utility;Development;TextEditor;\nStartupWMClass=Emacs\nEOF\n\nPlace the emacsclient in the launcher (e.g. tap Super, type \"emacsclient\", drag it on), and log out/in.\n\nA: Another way is to use a script:\nif [ \"$(pidof emacs)\" ] ; then\n    emacsclient \"$@\" &\nelse\n    emacs -mm \"$@\" &\nfi\n\nSo you always invoke the same command.\n", "Q: How to dynamically enable and disable ipv6 on an interface How to dynamically enable and disable IPv6 on an interface so that it gets link local address when enabled? \nI have tried:\nsysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1 to disable IPv6\nand \nsysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0 to enable IPv6. \nAre there any other ways? \n\nA: I think your approach is valid as it is.\nYou could use the per-interface settings if you don't want to change settings for every interface, e.g. net.ipv6.conf.eth0.disable_ipv6\nI wouldn't recommend touching anything else.\n\nA: To turn off IPv6 in Ubuntu 11.04\nFirstly, On or off, check it out\n$ ifconfig -a\n\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr \n          inet addr:  Bcast:  Mask:\n          **inet6** addr: fe80::210:f3ff:fe21:722a/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:982 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:943 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:800461 (800.4 KB)  TX bytes:144524 (144.5 KB)\n          Interrupt:20 Memory:f7d00000-f7d20000 \n\neth1      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr  \n          UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\n          Interrupt:16 Memory:f7c00000-f7c20000 \n\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback  \n          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n          **inet6** addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric:1\n          RX packets:20 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:20 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n          RX bytes:1200 (1.2 KB)  TX bytes:1200 (1.2 KB)\n\nSecondly, Turn off, i modified the line as following and patched the grub\n$ grep ipv6 /etc/default/grub\n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"ipv6.disable=1 quiet splash\"\n\n$ update-grub\nGenerating grub.cfg ...\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.38-11-generic-pae\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-2.6.38-11-generic-pae\nFound memtest86+ image: /boot/memtest86+.bin\ndone\n\n\nA: To disable IPv6\n$ su -\n# nano /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nand add these lines to sysctl.conf file\n#disable ipv6\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.eth0.disable_ipv6 = 1\n\nSave sysctl.conf file with new config and run the following command to enable the new settings:\n# sysctl -p \n\nCheck your system again\n$ cat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6\n\nNow you should see “1″ means IPv6 has been disabled on your system.\nFrom http://namhuy.net/1419/disable-ipv6-ubuntu-linux-mint.html\n", "Q: System using a lot of memory and I cant find why My Ubuntu is using an insane amount of ram memory.\nWhen I boot the machine it is using around 1,5 to 2 gig ram without me launching any applications. \nWhen I start firefox and vlc it maxes out.

At least that is what the docs say, look at the text in the big red square ;).\nIt doesn't look enabled in your .vbox file: \n<IOAPIC enabled=\"false\"/>\n\n\nA: In order to be able to run a 64-Bit system in a VirtualBox, you need a cpu which supports virtualization. AMD calls this function AMD-V, Intel uses VT-x. The Wikipedia explains this quite good. There are a couple of Pentium-4 CPUs which are able to run a 64-Bit OS, but don't offer this VT-x technologie. You can check your system by...\n$ egrep '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo\nflags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov pat pse36 clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr sse sse2 ss ht tm syscall nx lm constant_tsc pni monitor ds_cpl vmx cid cx16 xtpr lahf_lm\nflags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov pat pse36 clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr sse sse2 ss ht tm syscall nx lm constant_tsc pni monitor ds_cpl vmx cid cx16 xtpr lahf_lm\n\nIf you don't get any output, you're not able to run a 64-Bit OS as guest inside your VirtualBox. But don't forget to check your BIOS settings. You might be able to activate these AMD-V/VT-x features inside the BIOS of your computer.\nAnd finally there's a checkbox inside the VirtualBox-Settings. Start VirtualBox, select the virtual machine where you want to run your 64-Bit OS and go into the settings of this VM. Look for \"Settings -> System -> Acceleration\" and make sure that \"Enable VT-x/AMD-V\" is activated.\n\nA: According to VirtualBox you should:\n\n\n*\n\n*upgrade your BIOS if possible\n\n*remove the KVM modules (Linux host) \n\n\n3.1.4 will contain a workaround for people with a broken BIOS and no option to update it. Set the VBOX_HWVIRTEX_IGNORE_SVM_IN_USE environment variable to true:\nset VBOX_HWVIRTEX_IGNORE_SVM_IN_USE=true on Windows\nexport VBOX_HWVIRTEX_IGNORE_SVM_IN_USE=true on Linux \n\nThis will tell VirtualBox to ignore VERR_SVM_IN_USE and continue to use AMD-V.\nNote that this is a hack and dangerous if you run more than one hypervisor at the same time.\n\nA: This is an issue only with VirtualBox, to me it is stil a bug. If you install the same OS let's say using the VMWare Player on the same machine it works just fine. Without updatin the BIOS.\nPretty annoying.\n\nA: Make sure you've selected the 64-bit version of your Linux distribution in the wizard while creating the guest. I had the same issue, but it was solved by setting correct option at \"version\" of the distribution.\nEven when you boot off a 64bit ISO image, it won't run until I set that option (General -> Basic -> Version).\nThen you should have the ability to enable VT-x and I/O Apic.\n\nA: For an Asus M5A88-M mobo with an AMD FX6100 CPU, the correct BIOS selection is in the 'CPU Configuration' (under the Advanced tab), ENABLE \"Secure Virtual Machine Mode\" and as already mentioned, make sure VBox \"Settings -> System -> Acceleration\" and make sure that \"Enable VT-x/AMD-V\" is activated. \nFor allowing more than one core with this config you have to unlock the cores in the BIOS (or by pressing 4 at the Asus splash screen), but I haven't tried core unlocker yet.\n\nA: I got Virtual Box 4.1.12 with the corresponding extension pack installed on Linux Mint 13 Maya Xfce OS and installed Windows XP Home edition in it. \nWith a little help from my son I now have the USB's activated. To activate the USB's, press the right Ctrl+Home keys and select Device →  Install Guest Additions, run it, it installs a number of things in Windows, leave the 3d box unchecked. \nWhen it restarts Windows make sure it boots up in Safe Mode, log in as Administrator (Windows) then rerun the Install Guest Additions, this time check the 3D box and when it is all done, reboot the session. Shut down the Windows XP session, close VirtualBox, shut down the computer. Restart the computer, restart virtual box, restart Windows XP session, now press right Ctrl+Home, Device → USB should work, you should see any USB devices connected in the drop down. \nI was able to connect my TI calculator (which has very limited functionality in Linux (probably more than my knowledge)). Windows XP in VirtualBox on Linux host PC is the way to go with Windows.\n\nA: if you have the capacity then enabling on your BIOS should be really easy, just boot up into BIOS and look for \"Virtualization\" it should be under \"Security\". Then just enable. :)\n\nA: Please ensure that you have enabled VT-x/AMD-V properly in the BIOS of your host computer.The Virtualiation setting in the BIOS is set to Enabled.\nI had this same problem.  I changed the BIOS settings to enable VT-x virtualization on my lenovo.  After this the virtual machine said that even though it was enabled, I couldn't use it in my virtual machine.  So I ended up deleting my virtual machine and starting a new one in the oracle vm virtualbox GUI.  This one had the VT-x enabled in settings/system/acceleration tab under hardware virtualization. \n", "Q: How can I open two half-screen windows in a row without overlapping? I use a monitor that is exactly 2×1024 pixels wide as a substitute for a dual-screen configuration.\nIn Ubuntu 10.10, I could open two windows in a row and each would be automatically placed on a different half of the screen, like this:\n\nIn Ubuntu 11.04, the launcher introduces a displacement in the default location for new windows that causes them to encroach upon the other half of the screen. The resulting default behavior is now to create an overlap of the two windows:\n\nThis is senseless. How can I restore the normal behavior?\n\nAlso, I would like to preempt the suggestion that I simply shorten the default width of windows to accommodate the for the launcher. Firstly, this defeats the purpose of having purchased a monitor this wide in the first place; 1024 pixels is an important minimum width to meet because many popular websites are designed for this size and will display horizontal scroll bars if the windows are smaller:\n\nMore importantly, though, is that I frequently use the default Grid plugin in Compiz to move windows from one half of the screen to the other. This action automatically resizes windows to half of the screen width, so my narrower widths would quickly be overridden.\n\nA: Since I don't use Unity, I don't know for sure, but if you set the Unity launcher be always hidden, then maybe your windows won't shift to the right to accommodate it.\n\n\nA: Unity won't position windows overlapping its Launcher, but you can move them there yourself.  Unity also won't let you move the Launcher to the bottom, but you can choose not to use Unity and instead use classic mode . . . or set Unity to Autohide the Launcher.  I tried that out (install CompizConfig Settings Manager, then find Ubuntu Unity Plugin under Desktop and set Hide Launcher to Autohide) and when I launched terminal it hid Launcher first and then placed the terminal window against the left edge.\nYou can also look at the Place Windows plugin under Window Management in CompizConfig Settings Manager.  I use that to automatically place my Firefox and Thunderbird windows where I like them.  I'm not sure how that would interact with the Grid plugin, but maybe placement of Firefox windows at 0,0 would do what you want.  If not, I think you'll need to autohide the Launcher or use classic mode so there's nothing on the sides of your screen.\n", "Q: Which laptop tools does Ubuntu come with?

And then like many users, I also encountered the ugly fonts on starting the app. I've tried installing lsb-core and ttf-mscorefonts-installer, but I found that both are already installed. Could someone help me fix this?\n\nA: I've just installed Xubuntu 11.10 on my 64-bit machine, and downloaded and installed the 64-bit .deb package for Google earth 6.2, and had the same problem with the awful font.\nI followed the instructions on page http://omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/01/how-to-make-google-earth-look-native-in-ubuntu, and they solved the problem. To paraphrase:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, close Google Earth if it's running.\n\n*In a terminal emulator, give the following commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd /opt/google/earth/\n\n*sudo rm libcurl.so.4 libGLU.so.1 libnss_mdns4_minimal.so.2 libQtCore.so.4 libQtGui.so.4 libQtNetwork.so.4 libQtWebKit.so.4\n\n\n*Use any editor to edit file /opt/google/earth/googleearth -- but you have to do it as a root, so for instance, the following command from a terminal emulator would work:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo nano /opt/google/earth/googleearth\n\n\n*Now add the line export LD_PRELOAD=libfreeimage.so.3 as the second last line of file googleearth -- that is, just before the line LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./googleearth-bin \"$@\" -- and save the file.\n\n*Obtain the file libfreeimage.so.3 (removed broken link)\nEdit: Since the link is broken you can obtain the file in this package\n\n*If your machine is 64-bit, download the file libphonon.so.4 (removed broken link)\nEdit: Since the link is broken you can obtain the file in this package\n\n*In a terminal emulator, give the following commands (the ones concerning libphonon.so.4 only if your machine is 64-bit):\n\n\n*\n\n*cd /opt/google/earth/\n\n*sudo cp ~/Downloads/libfreeimage.so.3 .\n\n*sudo cp ~/Downloads/libphonon.so.4 .\n\n*sudo chmod a+x libfreeimage.so.3\n\n*sudo chmod a+x libphonon.so.4\n\n*sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libqtwebkit4\n\n\n*Restart Google Earth.

However, I can't remember how to use window edges for this.\n\nA: You can also use wmctrl for Aero snap, which has the following benefits:\n\n\n*\n\n*You don't have to mess about with Compiz.\n\n*You can run it from within Gnome (Unity2D) without having to install another window manager.\n\n\nI wrote a Python script to set up the commands.

It will work if a) you are using a PPA or local mirrors or b) have just a single mismatch to resolve.\n\nNote: if you have the specific error message given in the log in the question above, the accepted answer should always work. But there are several other questions that have been closed as duplicates of this one where the accepted answer is insufficient.\n\nIt doesn't hurt to try, though, so start with:\nsudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThis might be sufficient to proceed with sudo apt-get upgrade or other follow-up commands.\nBut if it doesn't work...\nYou may get \"Hash sum mismatch\" errors from that command, too. If this happens, run:\nsudo apt-get update --fix-missing\n\nIt is possible that even this command will throw \"Hash sum mismatch\" errors, because the issue can come from transient network content errors. If so, continue to re-run the above --fix-missing command until it completes successfully. For example, like:\nuntil sudo apt-get update --fix-missing; do echo trying again; done\n\n(It should make progress with each run of apt-get update --fix-missing; if successive runs are not reducing the errors towards zero, press Ctrl-c to interrupt the loop. Then go back to the beginning of this answer with removing the contents of /var/lib/apt/lists and try again.)\nAfter this, the update may work, but to be sure, first run apt-get clean, as so:\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get update\n\nNote that if you're doing this in preparation for an apt-get upgrade, it is possible (even likely, if you had enough mismatches to require updating several times) the upgrade will fail with \"Hash sum mismatch\" errors of its own. If so, add --fix-missing to your upgrade command:\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get upgrade --fix-missing\n\nand try again. (apt-get upgrade with --fix-missing will also try holding back failing packages and continuing others, so you should see some additional progress from running this at least once.)\nBut if it still doesn't work...\nLike the earlier until sudo... command, you may get some further progress by repeating this command (always preceded by the clean command above), which you can even automate with\nuntil (sudo apt-get clean; sudo apt-get upgrade --fix-missing --yes); do echo trying again; done\n\nbut, usually, it will upgrade most of the upgradable packages the first time you run it with --fix-missing and after that get stuck on the same packages, making no further progress. At that point, you'll need to go back up to the beginning with the sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* and try again. It is worth trying this whole process two or three times, especially if you have dozens or hundreds of upgradable packages.\n\nA: Just remove all the content of /var/lib/apt/lists directory:\nsudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\nthen run:\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\nA: I still had the problem after removing the directories and doing sudo apt-get update.\nOnly the following step solved my problem:\nsudo sed -i -re 's/\\w+\\.archive\\.ubuntu\\.com/archive.ubuntu.com/g' /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nI don't know if this is the right way of fixing it...\nI've found the solution here.\n\nA: The following commands may solve your issue.\nsudo rm -R /var/lib/apt/lists/partial/*\n\nand then\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nit will solve your problem. I also faced the same problem but the above commands solved the problem for me. So give them a try.\nSolution reference\n\nA: I had the exact same problem and all solutions provided using the terminal did not help.\nFor me, it was by going into:\nSettings → Software & Updates → Ubuntu Software: Download from: Change Local to Main Server.\nIt starts reloading the repos and updating. When I enter:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nAfter that, there was no problem at all. I'm using Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS.\n\nA: This can happen when your mirror is not up to date or serving errors from being overloaded. You can either wait a while and try again, or switch to another mirror:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I get apt to use a mirror close to me, or choose a faster mirror?\n\nA: I don't know that it's proper solution or not, but I did the following and the error message's gone:\nAfter typing sudo apt-get update in terminal, it gives me the names of some packages which cause the error then I did the following:\nUpdate manager(software update) → Setting → Configure Software Sources → Other software[tab] → Uncheck the packages\nAfter pressing the \"close\" bottom, update manager started to check for update automatically again and I saw this message:\"the software on this computer is up to date. Last checked 2 seconds ago.\"\nKubuntu 12.04\n\nA: I had a similar problem and solved it by opening theh application \"Software & Updates\" and, in \"Ubuntu Software\" tab, changing the value of \"Download from\" (in that drop-down list, try to select, for example, Main Server if it was not like that). \n\nA: If you're running Linux inside VirtualBox on Windows and have Hyper-V (or WSL 2, which uses Hyper-V) enabled at the same time, you're in for a world of pain. This being one symptom. VirtualBox 6.1 says on the tin that it supports Hyper-V but it just isn't true (as of 2020-08-25 windows v2040 at least). Disable Hyper-V and you're golden.

Some large organisations and ISPs (especially in remote parts of the world) have transparent caches of which you may not be aware.\nThe fundamental issue is that the apt repository format is subject to race conditions when a mirror is updated. This problem particularly affects repositories that change rapidly, such as the development release.\nYou can track progress on the fix for this in this bug (please mark yourself as \"affects me too\" in the bug) and this blueprint. But be aware that it is a complex issue and may take more than one release to resolve.\n\nA: If you're behind a proxy, then create a file named 99fixbadproxy in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/:   \nsudo gedit /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99fixbadproxy\n\nPaste this into 99fixbadproxy and save it:\nAcquire::http::Pipeline-Depth 0;\nAcquire::http::No-Cache true;\nAcquire::BrokenProxy    true;\n\nNow run the update command:\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\nA: The easiest way to fix this is:\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\nA: I had the exact same problem and all solutions provided using the terminal did not help.\nFor me, it was by going into:\nSettings → Software & Updates → Other software: Uncheck all the boxes and press close.\nIt starts reloading the repos and updating. When I enter:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nAfter that, there was no problem at all. I'm using Ubuntu 13.10.\n\nA: As follow @robie-basak, I used apt-cacher-ng as mirror caching. So I Remove the proxy and the problem solved.\nI remove the proxy in file /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01proxy:\n#Acquire::http::Proxy \"http://xxx.xx.xx.xx:4321\";\n\nThen need to:\nsudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\nsudo aptitude update\nsudo aptitude upgrade\n\n\nA: I had just recently install Ubuntu 17.10 and was getting the same error of Hash Sum Mismatch for a some repository.I went to Software and Checked Source as shown below and there were no problems further for downloading repository from the terminal.\n\n\nA: I have resolved all the packages not being installed by running this command:\nsudo apt-get install PACKAGENAME\n\nFor each of the packages. They are now installed and the \"Hash Sum mismatch\" error has gone.\n\nA: This can happen if you're running a router with parental controls, and havent put your raspberry pi into an \"unmanaged\" list. For me, I could see the url was redirecting to a circle domain, managed by the router.\nSo I just added my pi to the unmanaged list, and it worked fine.\n\nA: Nothing worked for me. After trying and the suggested solutions, finally, I had downloaded the broken packages manually, copied them into /var/cache/apt/archives and removed the broken packages from /var/cache/apt/archives/partial.\n\nA: I faced the same problem in my Ubuntu 18.04, below is my practical experience:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the proxy in /etc/apt/apt.conf\n\n*Change to official apt sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list\n\n*Run sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\n*Clean packages sudo apt autoremove -y && sudo apt autoclean -y\n\n*Update and Upgrade.\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y && sudo apt autoclean -y\nDone!\n\nA: This happened for me on Ubuntu 16.04, and none of the top voted solutions worked. The solution was upgrading packages:\nsudo apt-get update    # this will fail\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get update    # this will succeed\n\nNot sure if cleaning old lists (sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* and/or sudo apt-get clean) helped or not!

How to install all plugins compiz in ubuntu natty 11.04? i can't install unsupported plugins\nI want to install experimental plugins, not the ones in compiz-plugins-extra. These plugins were installed by git in previous versions of compiz with a script (0.8.x):  \natlantis \ncubemodel \nfakeargb \ntile \nsnow \n\n\nA: Ubuntu no longer supplies all of the experimental plugins. Up through Maverick you can use the Compiz Packages PPA and install the compiz-fusion-plugins-unsupported package.\nWhat will work with Natty and Oneiric is the procedure that can be found at UbuntuGuide. Which is to download all of the compiz plugins and rebuild them all from source. This will overwrite the plugins that are already installed via the normal Ubuntu packaging system, as well as adding the unsupported plugins. \ncd ~/Downloads\nsudo apt-get install compiz-fusion-bcop compiz-dev \\build-essential libtool \\libglu1-mesa-dev libxss-dev \\libcairo2-dev git-core\ngit clone git://anongit.compiz.org/users/soreau/scripts\ncd scripts\n./compiz-addons install all\nnohup compiz --replace &\n\n\nA: You can install a set of additional plugins with the package compiz-plugins-extra. Either install via Synaptic or sudo apt-get install compiz-plugins-extra. (Make sure you have the Universe repository enabled.)\nIf you're talking about plugins that aren't even in the Ubuntu repositories, it probably depends on the plugin.

You can then bring up the debugger simply by pressing ^C.

Hence why you can use gdb to attach via sudo still.\nYou can temporarily disable this restriction (and revert to the old behaviour allowing your user to ptrace (gdb) any of their other processes) by doing:\necho 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope\n\nTo permanently allow it edit /etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf and change the line:\nkernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 1\n\nTo read:\nkernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 0\n\nFor some background on why this change was made, see the Ubuntu wiki.\n", "Q: How to enable notification area (systray) for Pidgin The Pidgin icon won't appear in the notification area.

They stay the same. I wish to be able to convert and not see the output.\n\nA: iconv defaults to sending its output to stdout, which explains the behaviour of what you saw.  You can direct the output to a file using the -o option, but that will only generate a single output file, and probably won't help you update the files in place.  Perhaps try something like this:\nfor file in *.sql; do\n    iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 -o \"$file\".utf \"$file\" && mv \"$file\".utf \"$file\"\ndone\n\nThat will convert each file and store the result in a temporary file, moving it to the original file name if the conversion was successful.\n\nA: It is also possible to use rsync to this task, with one advantage, you will keep a backup. If one of the converted files is already in the target codification you will mess it up. \nrsync -va --iconv=iso88591,utf8 /source/latin1/ /destination/utf8/\n\n", "Q: Why is Compiz crashing whenever I try to load saved settings? I recently installed a fresh version of 11.04 to replace a previous installation of 10.10.\nI had a .profile file saved that had all my preferences for Compiz.

I'm not interested in Unity for my desktop computer.)\nWhat's going on? Can't I get my saved preferences back?\n\nA: You probably cannot recover your saved settings because of the fact that the profile would have been saved with an older version of compiz that what is found in Natty, and quite likely cannot be loaded.\nIf the profile is a text file (I believe they are but I don't remember off hand), then you could manually recover the settings, but remember that some settings will have changed in this new version of compiz, and you might be better off starting from scratch (unfortunately). I had to do the same on my system, because the settings are not transferred from the older version (different gconf root keys).\n", "Q: How does Ubuntu handle file-system fragmentation? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhy is defragmentation unnecessary? \n\nThis could be for any file system but EXT4 works.\nDoes Ubuntu need to be defragged like windows. Does it do this on its own.\n\nA: Most Linux file systems avoid fragmentation to begin with*, so you don't need to defrag Ubuntu under normal circumstances.\n*This is accomplished in the way files are written to the disk. Mostly files are written in such a manner that they remain contiguous, with some filesystems arranging the inodes to avoid fragmentation, and when it occurs, to keep it to a minimum. Even when files are modified a lot, moved around etc, the filesystem uses the same principles to avoid fragmentation.\nSee here: https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/File_system_fragmentation#Preventing_fragmentation\n", "Q: Application keyboard shortcuts can't modify in gnome I have gconftool set to /desktop/gnome/interface/can_change_accels true, but can't assign or modify any application accelerators in Ubuntu 11.04.\n\nA: This configuration item has been moved to the gsettings system.

I seem to have broken some critical library bindings on my Ubuntu Studio set up by \"upgrading\" (and the quotes here do indicate a note of sarcasm) from Meerkat to Natty beta.

As it turned out, I decided to fully upgrade to a 64 bit (rather than continue with the 32 bit) configuration. Since I was being fairly aggressive, I grabbed what I couldn't simply replace and off-loaded the data onto every piece of gear I had in the house and took the plunge.\nIn a way, this turns out to be a much better configuration since I now have a separate /home, 64bit Ubuntu Studio and 64 bit Vista - which gets me to where I wanted to be when I tried dual booting the first time :/\nAll the apps are back up and I still have a few more things to work out, but that's where the fun is, right?\n", "Q: Bash auto-completion with added spaces – why, and how to fix?

So give it a try.\n\nA: A while ago evaluated the various OCR packages in Ubuntu, found that Tesseract was the least bad of them (but bad enough), and wrote a wrapper script for the OCRing (since Tesseract wants obscure input formats like TIFF).  Here's my ~/bin/ocr:\n#!/bin/sh\n# usage: ocr filename.jpg\nif test -z \"$1\"; then\n    echo \"usage: ocr filename.jpg [...]\"\n    echo \"needs imagemagick and tesseract-ocr\"\n    echo \"if tesseract fails, check if you've got tesseract-ocr-eng installed\"\nfi\ntmpdir=\"$(mktemp -d)\"\nfor fn in \"$@\"; do\n  convert \"$fn\" \"$tmpdir/page.tif\"\n  tesseract \"$tmpdir/page.tif\" \"$tmpdir/page\" 2>&1 | grep -v '^Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine$'\n  cat \"$tmpdir/page.txt\"\n  cp -i \"$tmpdir/page.txt\" \"${fn%.jpg}.txt\"\n  rm \"$tmpdir/page.tif\" \"$tmpdir/page.txt\"\ndone\nrm -r \"$tmpdir\"\n\nPreprocessing the images with GIMP (converting to B&W using the Threshold tool) seemed to helped a lot.\nI hope things have improved since then.  I've seen the name OCR Feeder in blog posts recently, I'd give it a try.\n\nA: The Tesseract-ocr package is command line. If you want a program with a GUI, I use \"gscan2pdf\" and you can find it in the Ubuntu Software Center.\nIn gscan2pdf all you need to do is click the little scan icon near the top. I think it gives you two or three options, GOCR which isnt very good, and Tesseract which works admirably. Pick Tesseract and from this point you need to click the appropriate tab so you can find the resolution settings. Your best bet is 300 or even 600 and Tesseract will do well.\nPoorly scanned, crooked, or old documents dont convert well. Good luck!\nPS.. I keep reading that Tesseract can only read TIFF images. This isnt the case for me. I can import JPG or PNG too.\nPPS... sorry for the edits! You might try OCRFeeder in the software center too. I have yet to try it though.\n\nA: I'f found this, it's called Tesseract OCR, hopefully it may be of use to you.\nhttp://linuxappfinder.com/package/tesseract-ocr\n\nA: I have Linux Mint 17.2 x32 Cinnamon. Probably these steps would work in Ubuntu 14.04 x32 too.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Tesseract OCR\nsudo apt-get install -y tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-eng\nYou can add other languages by installing additional packages. This screenshot is from synaptic:\nTesseract language packages in Synaptic\nUsing Tesseract\nOPTION 1 - by commandline\nopen terminal, then go to folder where You keep image files (jpg, png) and run command:\na) to convert all image files to text\nfor i in *png; do b=`basename \"$i\" .png`; tesseract -l eng \"$i\" \"$b\" text; done\n\nTo merge all text files into one, run a command cat *.txt >> all.txt\nb) to convert all image files to hocr files (open with Firefox)\nfor i in *png; do b=`basename \"$i\" .png`; tesseract -l eng \"$i\" \"$b\" hocr; done\n\nOPTION 2 - by GUI\na) Install gImageReader, and use it\nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:sandromani/gimagereader\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y gimagereader\n\nb) Second application is VietOCR.

What software are related to the Keyboard? or the Keyboard configuration?\nProblem\nIt's local, only at my account.\nIt doesn't help If I try the reassign the keys they still won't work.\nInfo\nMy laptop.\nIf I type xev in a terminal I notice that the key codes are gone.

But when I was finished and stopped the program I noticed that F10-F12 had stopped working.\nProblem\nI don't know what the software is called or how it works.\nThe keycodes For:\nF10 is 76\nF11 is 95\nF12 is 96\nSolution\nThe only solution I found was to reinstall Ubuntu, sad, just hope the problem is a one time thing...\n\nA: You need to start lower than keycodes. You need to find the scancodes for these keys, and associate keycodes to them. The subsystem that deals with these is udev, and the relevant files are found in /lib/udev/.\nStep 1 \nCheck in /var/log/dmesg if the keys F10, F11 and F12 produce any output when you press them. To do so, start the Log File Viewer (gnome-system-log), and notice for any additions to dmesg when you press those keys.\n\n\n*\n\n*If they produce output, then there are no associated keycodes to the scancodes that the keys emit, therefore the problem you are facing is much low level. You need to assign keycodes to these scancodes. Use setkeycodes to assign the correct scancode.\n\n*If they produce no output, then something is wrong in the X Org configuration and possibly with udev. See next step.\nStep 2 \nRun\n/lib/udev/findkeyboards\n\nto find the correct device for your keyboard. Sample output is\nUSB keyboard: input/event6\nAT keyboard: input/event5\n\nIn this case, our keyboard is input/event5.\nThen, run\nsudo /lib/udev/keymap -i input/event5\n\nand press the problematic keys. You can exit this program by pressing Esc.\nSample (correct) output for me is\nscan code: 0x44   key code: f10\nscan code: 0x57   key code: f11\nscan code: 0x58   key code: f12\n\nStep 3\nIf you notice that the keys work in a new user account, then what went wrong are configuration settings in your current account. There are a few ways where you can re-assign keys. For example, check to see whether you accidentally created new shortcuts for F10, F11 and F12 at \n\nSystem » Preferences » Keyboard\n  Shortcuts\n\n.\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to keyboard preferences --> layouts and add a new layout (UK or any other you currently don't have).\n\n*Remove your current layout and then logout and back in. \n\n*Go to keyboard preferences --> layouts and add your old layout again, and remove the one you added earlier.\n\n*Log out and back in. Check the functionality now..\n\n\nA: Imho your problem is not at all related to the keyboard configuration! \n\n\n*\n\n*I would check the gnome-shortcuts (maybe reassign keys), ...\n\n*...or check if some software you use has some mediakey-plugin or something in the preferences that might cause problems with the gnome-shortcut system. Probably that software is not gtk+. Could be something like audacious or amarok.\nI see no possibility that a pulseaudio crash could (directly) cause your problem. \n\nA: Here is a pretty good description intended for multimedia keys but it really helped me a lot. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MultimediaKeys\n", "Q: MacBook Pro (5,3) Keyboard Weirdness My MacBook Pro (5,3) works almost completely OOTB (with restricted video and WiFi drivers), but I am experiencing some keyboard weirdness.\nSpecifically to get either (` and ~) or (´ and ¨) I have to press the key twice.

It gets stuck in the ubuntu splash screen, an if I choose the recovery mode in grub, it sort of halts in the session selection menu.\nI have already run a memtest and it passes without errors. \nHow to proceed to further debug this issue?\n\nA: I had similar issues. In order to get the recovery console working (I had the same issue - recovery menu would come up, but would not react to keyboard input), I had to unplug all my usb devices and add nohz=off acpi=off to my boot line in grub for the recovery mode. These boot parameters might differ for your system. I certainly would give acpi=off a try. That seems to be an issue for many system. \nOnce I was successfully in recovery mode, I was able to fix my xserver by renaming the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file. \nMy issue was that I had the proprietary driver from ati installed, but then I used jockey to install the Ubuntu version of the fglrx driver over that. That left my system in an unstable state.

Sometimes if I act quickly I can manage to slowly open console and kill some of ram eating applications like browser, and the system unfreezes almost instantly.\nBecause of this problem I almost never see anything in the swap, only sometimes there are some few MB there, and then soon after this problem appears.\nMy not so educated guess would be that it is connected somehow to the disk cache being too greedy, or memory management too lenient, so when the memory is needed it is not freed quickly enough and starves the system.\nProblem can be achieved really fast if working with large files (500MB+) which are loaded in disk cache and apparently afterwards system is unable to unload them fast enough.\nAny help or Ideas will be greatly appreciated.\nFor now I have to live in constant fear, when doing something computer can just freeze and I usually have to restart It, if it is really running out of ram I would much more like it to just kill some of userspace applications, like browser (preferably if I could somehow mark which to kill first)\nAlthough the mystery is why doesn't swap save me in this situation.\nUPDATE:\nIt didn't hang for some time, but now I got several occurrences again. I am now keeping ram monitor on my screen at all times and when the hang happened it still showed ~30% free (Used by disk cache probably).\nAdditional symptoms: If at the time I am watching video (VLC player) the sound stops first, after a few seconds the image stops. While the sound has stopped I still have some control over PC, but when the image stops I cannot even move the mouse anymore, so I restarted it after some waiting. Btw, this didn't happen when I started to watch the video but some time in (20min) and I didn't actively do anything else at the time, even though browser and oowrite were open on the second screen the whole time. Basically something just decides to happen at one point and hangs the system.\nAs per request in the comments I ran dmesg right after the hang. I didn't notice anything weird, but didn't know for what to look, so here it is:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1iQih0Ee2DwsGd3VuQZu0bPbg0JGjSOCRZhu0B05CMYs/edit?hl=en_US&authkey=CPzF7bcC\n\nA: Nothing worked for me!!\nSo I wrote a script to monitor memory usage. It will first try to clear RAM cache if the memory consumption increases a threshold. You can configure this threshold on the script. If memory consumption doesn't come below the threshold even then, it will start killing processes on by one in decreasing order of memory consumption until the memory consumption is below the threshold. I have set it to 96% by default. You can configure it by changing the value of variable RAM_USAGE_THRESHOLD in the script.\nI agree that killing processes which consume high memory is not the perfect solution, but it's better to kill ONE application instead of losing ALL the work!! the script will send you desktop notification if RAM usage increases the threshold. It will also notify you if it kills any process.\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport psutil, time\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom subprocess import Popen, PIPE\nimport tkinter\nfrom tkinter import messagebox\nroot = tkinter.Tk()\nroot.withdraw()\n\nRAM_USAGE_THRESHOLD = 96\nMAX_NUM_PROCESS_KILL = 100\n\ndef main():\n    if psutil.virtual_memory().percent >= RAM_USAGE_THRESHOLD:\n        # Clear RAM cache\n        mem_warn = \"Memory usage critical: {}%\\nClearing RAM Cache\".\\\n            format(psutil.virtual_memory().percent)\n        print(mem_warn)\n        Popen(\"notify-send \\\"{}\\\"\".format(mem_warn), shell=True)\n        print(\"Clearing RAM Cache\")\n        print(Popen('echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches',\n                    stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE,\n                    shell=True).communicate())\n        post_cache_mssg = \"Memory usage after clearing RAM cache: {}%\".format(\n                            psutil.virtual_memory().percent)\n        Popen(\"notify-send \\\"{}\\\"\".format(post_cache_mssg), shell=True)\n        print(post_cache_mssg)\n\n        if psutil.virtual_memory().percent < RAM_USAGE_THRESHOLD:\n            print(\"Clearing RAM cache saved the day\")\n            return\n        # Kill top C{MAX_NUM_PROCESS_KILL} highest memory consuming processes.\n        ps_killed_notify = \"\"\n        for i, ps in enumerate(sorted(psutil.process_iter(),\n                                      key=lambda x: x.memory_percent(),\n                                      reverse=True)):\n            # Do not kill root\n            if ps.pid == 1:\n                continue\n            elif (i > MAX_NUM_PROCESS_KILL) or \\\n                    (psutil.virtual_memory().percent < RAM_USAGE_THRESHOLD):\n                messagebox.showwarning('Killed proccess - save_hang',\n                                       ps_killed_notify)\n                Popen(\"notify-send \\\"{}\\\"\".format(ps_killed_notify), shell=True)\n                return\n            else:\n                try:\n                    ps_killed_mssg = \"Killed {} {} ({}) which was consuming {\" \\\n                                     \"} % memory (memory usage={})\". \\\n                        format(i, ps.name(), ps.pid, ps.memory_percent(),\n                               psutil.virtual_memory().percent)\n                    ps.kill()\n                    time.sleep(1)\n                    ps_killed_mssg += \"Current memory usage={}\".\\\n                        format(psutil.virtual_memory().percent)\n                    print(ps_killed_mssg)\n                    ps_killed_notify += ps_killed_mssg + \"\\n\"\n                except Exception as err:\n                    print(\"Error while killing {}: {}\".format(ps.pid, err))\n    else:\n        print(\"Memory usage = \" + str(psutil.virtual_memory().percent))\n    root.update()\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    while True:\n        try:\n            main()\n        except Exception as err:\n            print(err)\n        time.sleep(1)\n\nSave the code in a file say save_hang.py.

Of course it still tries to cache them and immediately swap them out, so you should probably limit your swapping as well:\nsysctl -w vm.swappiness=5\n\n(100 = swap as often as possible, 0= swap only on total necessity)\nThe result is that linux no longer randomly decides to load a whole movie file of approx 1GB in ram while watching it, and killing the machine in doing so.\nNow there is enough reserved space to avoid memory starvation, which aparrently was the problem (seeing as there are no more freezes like before).\nAfter testing for a day - lockups are gone, sometimes there are minor slowdowns, because stuff gets cached more often, but I can live with that if I dont have to restart computer every few hours.\nThe lesson here is - default memory management is just one of use cases and is not allways the best, even though some people try to suggest otherwise - home entertainment ubuntu should be configured differently than server.\n\nYou probably want to make these settings permanent by adding them to your /etc/sysctl.conf like this:\nvm.swappiness=5\nvm.min_free_kbytes=65536\n\n\nA: I know this question is old, but I had this problem in Ubuntu (Chrubuntu) 14.04 on an Acer C720 Chromebook. I tried Krišjānis Nesenbergs solution, and it worked somewhat, but still crashed sometimes. \nI finally found a solution that worked by installing zram instead of using physical swap on the SSD. To install it I just followed the instructions here, like this: \nsudo apt-get install zram-config\n\nAfterwards I was able to configure the size of the zram swap by modifying /etc/init/zram-config.conf on line 21.\n20: # Calculate the memory to user for zram (1/2 of ram)\n21: mem=$(((totalmem / 2 / ${NRDEVICES}) * 1024))\n\nI replaced the 2 with a 1 in order to make the zram size the same size as the amount of ram I have. Since doing so, I have had no more freezes or system unresponsiveness. \n\nA: My guess is that you've set your vm.swappiness to a very low value, which causes the kernel to swap too late, leaving too low RAM for the system to work with.\nYou can show your current swappiness setting by executing:\nsysctl vm.swappiness\n\nBy default, this is set to 60. The Ubuntu Wiki recommends to set it to 10, but feel free to set it to a higher value. You can change it by running:\nsudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10\n\nThis will change it for the current session only, to make it persistent, you need to add vm.swappiness = 10 to the /etc/sysctl.conf file.\nIf your disk is slow, consider buying a new one.\n\nA: I've been struggling with this issue for a long time, but now it seems to be solved on my Laptop.\nIf none of the other answers works for you (I tried most of them), play with min_free_kbytes, to have more space in RAM when your computer starts swapping (just before hitting this minimum value on your free RAM).\nI have 16GB RAM, but more sooner than later the memory became full and then stopped responding for 10 to 30 minutes, until some things get swapped.\nAt least for me, setting min_free_kbytes value above what is recommended makes that swapping process considerably faster.\nFor 16GB RAM, try this:\nvm.min_free_kbytes=500000\n\nTo set this value see other answers, or just google it :)\n\nA: This happened for me in a new install of Ubuntu 14.04.\nIn my case, it had nothing to do with sysctl issues mentioned. \nInstead, the problem was that the swap partition's UUID was different during installation than it was after installation. So my swap was never enabled, and my machine would lock up after a few hours use.\nThe solution was to check the current UUID of the swap partition with \nsudo blkid\n\nand then sudo nano /etc/fstab to replace the incorrect swap's UUID value with the one reported by blkid.\nA simple reboot to affect the changes, and voila.\n\nA: I run one of my laptops from a live Ubuntu SD card constantly, with a small ext4 storage partition and a swap file on the hard drive. When almost all of the RAM is used and the swappiness value is too low (sometimes I prefer to keep the hard drive completely off if possible, because it's noisy), Linux performance tends to fall off a cliff for me, such that just getting to TTY1 to kill Firefox takes 15 minutes.\nRaising /proc/sys/vm/vfs_cache_pressure from the default of 100 to a value of 6000 seems to help prevent this. However, the kernel documentation warns against doing so, saying\nIncreasing vfs_cache_pressure significantly beyond 100 may have negative\nperformance impact. Reclaim code needs to take various locks to find freeable\ndirectory and inode objects. With vfs_cache_pressure=1000, it will look for\nten times more freeable objects than there are.\n\nI am not entirely sure of the side effects of doing this so I'd be careful doing this.\n\nA: Instead of tunning kernel parameters yourself. try linux-zen or linux-ck which are specially designed (patched and tunned) for Desktop and Laptop usages. Default Linux is more tunned towards more throughput and Servers without GUI\nzen will give you less throughout but better responsiveness. In my experience tunning parameters of default kernel give less throughout than linux-zen ( or liquorix ) and linux-ck.\nFor ubuntu, I think you have to manually compile and patch kernel for linux-ck with Con Kolivas' ck patchset\nYou can use liquorix kernel which usage Linux-zen source. take a look at \nhttps://liquorix.net/\nhere's how to install \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:damentz/liquorix\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-liquorix-amd64 linux-headers-liquorix-amd64\n\nif you insist using default kernel, then disabling swap might be a better option too\n", "Q: I need documentation on how to create quicklists Can someone please tell me the language used for quicklists, and where I can find its documentation? I know you can copy a similar quicklist and modify it, but that approach has serious limitations.\n\nA: Static quicklists don't require a specific programming languages But if you are looking for syntax it is as follows  \nX-Ayatana-Desktop-Shortcuts=Quicklist1;Quicklist2;Quicklist3\n\n[Qucklist1 Shortcut Group]\nName=Quicklist1 \nExec=Executable command\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n[Qucklist2 Shortcut Group]\nName=Quicklist2\nExec=Executable command\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n[Qucklist3 Shortcut Group]\nName=Quicklist3 \nExec=Executable command\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\nThere is more on that here. That page also has information (with example code) for how to create dynamic quicklists, which let the program dynamically create quicklists on the fly.\n\nA: I think the easyest way is by installing Ubuntu-tweak which has a Unity quicklist editor: http://ubuntu-tweak.com/\n", "Q: How do I enable a clipboard manager? I've manually installed clipboard managers in Ubuntu before (both Klipper and Glipper, IIRC), and found them useful.\nDoes 11.04 ship with a standard clipboard manager? If so, how do I enable it?

It contains instructions on Glipper and Glippy and a few others that you might find interesting too.  \nTo start these indicators: indicators will have an entry in the 'startup applications'. It might be set to 'off' or to 'on' depending on the indicator.

I just realized I can't unrar .rar files on my Ubuntu machine!\nWhat's the easiest way to accomplish this fundamental task? If possible I'd love something like 7Zip that I can just right Click, and extract and have the program worry about how to do it regardless if it's a .zip, a .rar or a .foo compressed file.\n\nA: First, run:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unrar\n\n\nYou could read man unrar.  \nFrom terminal you can use next command:\nunrar e -r /home/work/software/myfile.rar\n\nOr, the following command if you want to preserve the directory structure too:\nunrar x -r /home/work/software/myfile.rar\n\n\nA: If you like then you can also use p7zip-full package. You can install it as:\nsudo apt-get install p7zip-full p7zip-rar\n\nThe main purpose of this package is to provide 7z and 7za file archivers with high compression ratio.\n\nA: $ sudo apt-get install unrar\nReading package lists...

To install:\nsudo apt-get install libarchive-tools\n\nExtract RAR files using:\nbsdtar -xf myfile.rar\n\n\n\n*The unar package provides the unar command for extracting a variety of file formats, including RAR files. To install:\nsudo apt-get install unar\n\nExtract RAR files using:\nunar myfile.rar\n\nAnother free alternative is the unrar-free package. However, unrar-free is only able to extract RAR files, unlike bsdtar and unar which are able to extract many file formats. Furthermore, starting in Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish), unrar-free is just a wrapper around libarchive (just like bsdtar), which makes unrar-free redundant.\n", "Q: How to monitor & log server hardware temperatures & load I am looking for a way to log & monitor my server hardware temperatures and load (like for CPU or RAM). How might I do that? \nObjective is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*ensure hardware is not heating up\n\n*identify what should be upgraded & what is in excess (like perhaps to learn maybe not to get such a good CPU for example)\n\n\nOk I can use one of the applets that live in the task bar but what about logging?\n\nA: If programs like Cacti are too much then you could use a script which just logs to text file by day - run it with crontab. You need to have lm-sensors installed.\n#!/bin/bash\n_now=$(date +\"%Y_%m_%d\")\n_file=\"temp_log_$_now.txt\"\n(date; sensors; echo '-----------') | cat >> \"/var/log/temperatures/$_file\"\n\nThis only works if there is a directory /var/log/temperatures which may need to be created first (sudo mkdir /var/log/temperatures) and which only root can write to (so you would need to use the root crontab. If you want to use the per user crontab you could instead create /home/user/temperatures (mkdir ~/temperatures) and use that path in the script (use the full path in the script).\n\nA: For logging of cpu/ram/temperatures/traffic on a server, I recommended Cacti. It is advertised as a 'complete frontend for RRDtool', and can have multipled data sources such as lm-sensors, SNMP or even custom scripts. Data is stored in RRD, and used to create daily, weekly, monthly and yearly graphs.\n  \nSee the Cacti website for more details, screenshots and links to live example sites. It can be tricky to set up the very first time, but is worth it in the end.\n\nA: I use zenoss to monitor about 70 unix and windows servers at my office. We also monitor all networking equipment, and even a thermostat in the Server room.  Most of it is via SNMP.  (however, we use some custom written scripts to monitor some application performance)\nMost servers (such as dell and hp) have internal temperature sensors, that you can query using SNMP.  You can also monitor processes, CPU utilization, network throughput, etc.  I get alerts if servers go offline, or start using too much CPU, or if critical processes go down. \nSeriously, I can't urge enough to look at things like zenoss, hyperic, and nagios!  the free versions can monitor multiple systems, but they can also just monitor one.  They help with troubleshooting, and finding out what a server was doing at 2am when a problem happened.\n\nA: If you want something that does not depend on a desktop:\nHave a look at lm-sensors . From the description:\nLm-sensors is a hardware health monitoring package for Linux. It allows \nyou to access information from temperature, voltage, and fan speed \nsensors. It works with most newer systems.\n\nThis package contains programs to help you set up and read data from\nlm-sensors.\nFrom their project page (2016 edit: project is dead. Our own wiki has some info):\n\n\n*\n\n*Unattended high-end server, router or other mission-critical machine automated monitoring. Easily create a cron job to query the status of your hardware and email you in the event of a problem before it becomes critical. That way, you can be alerted within seconds of a failing critical component such as a power supply, fan, other cooling mechanism, or even detect if the case has been opened.\n\n*Embedded systems running Linux. These can use this package to monitor voltages, temperatures, fan speeds, etc. using off-the-shelf components and utilizing a range of bus interfaces (e.g. ISA, SMBus, I2C or SPI).\n\n*More generally, data acquisition. Easily measure various types of data (rotational speeds, voltages, temperatures, etc.) using cheap off-the-shelf parts. Very useful for systems automation (in the home, workshop, weather station, you name it).\n\n\nlm-sensors has a daemon, called sensord, that uses RRDtool for 'data logging and graphing system for time series data'. So it includes graphics like this  that can be shown through a webserver:\n\n(taken from lm-sensors project page).\nTo install the sensord daemon you will likely have to install the sensord package.\nExample from my notebook:\n\nThe config file for this is located at /etc/sensors3.conf\nlm-sensors is sort of the basic of any temperature measuring.

I just learned that Microsoft has taken over Skype.\nWill this affect the availability of Skype in the Canonical Partner repository?\n\nA: According what I read, MS will still support Skype for non-Microsoft platforms. Skype not only runs on desktop OSes, but also on mobile OSes such as Android. So it would really be short-sighted of MS to stop supporting it on non-Microsoft platforms.\n\nA: Depends how partner'ish will it be with Canonical.

I installed Natty over my 10.10 that started in text mode. Before Natty, after booting, I run the graphical environment with startx and all was fine. Now, with Natty, if I run startx, the graphical environment starts without any gnome or unity menu!. \n\n\n*\n\n*How do I start X and Unity, without a graphical login manager?\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Unity needs gdm to be able to start, so you need to start it:\nservice start gdm\n\nor the good old:\n/etc/init.d/gdm start\n\nIf you don't want to have to enter your credentials again you can either activate autologin in Gdm  or switch the default session to classic in gdm. After login off and stopping gdm, startx should work again.\n\nA: startx gets its configuration from the systemwide /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc if you don't have a ~/.xinitrc of your own.  I'm on a KDE system so I can't test this, but I think making a ~/.xinitrc for your user with:\nexec $HOME/.gnome2/session\n\nmight help.   If you don't have a gnome session file there, then use /usr/share/gnome/default.session\n\nA: Try to create a .xsession file in your home directory like this:\ngnome-session --session=classic-gnome\n\n\nA: What you're asking for is impossible, Unity depends on Gdm service dbus (display, user etc) and expects you to log in via that method.\nIt sounds like you wish to log in using an alternative method of authentication. You should look at pam and the different pam.d modules and configurations if the login automatically option is not what you need.\nFor instance you can log in if there is an ssh key present in the session, or if you have a usb dongle plugged in. etc.\n", "Q: Periodic Keyboard Lag/Delay On two of my computers running Natty with Gnome 3, I'm having periodic keyboard lag.  It happens at a random interval after starting the computer.  Basically, the keyboard will stop functioning normally and only register input if you hold a key down for two or more seconds.  When you release the key, it stops right away like it should.\nThe only fix I've found so far is to restart the computer.  One computer only experiences this about once a day, and it's not a big deal to restart it.  The other computer does it quite frequently, sometimes even within the first few minutes after booting.  Last night I had to restart that computer probably five or six times over the course of a few hours.\nThis started happening about a week ago, and I haven't been able to pinpoint a cause.\nDoes someone know how to permanently fix this problem?\n\nA: I had the same problem with my Lenovo x61 laptop running xubuntu 11.04. After some experimentation I found that this only occurs when using xterm. Try using a different terminal like gnome-terminal or xfce4-terminal.\nA good way to test for this problem is to hold down a key in the the terminal (e.g. \"aaaaa\" ...). After a short while it was evident that xterm was locking up where other terminals were not.\nThanks to Oil for unlocking this question so that I could post my answer for you.\nAnother user: I had the same problem and finally figured out the root cause.

My best advice is to use Lucid or Oneiric Beta.\n\nA: Unity won't work well on hardware that is even 3 years old, that is what I have experiece recently, my solution was to \"downgrade\" to 10.10 Maverick Meerkat, You may, instead of downgrading, have to change which windows/file manager you are using, or you may have to go from the unity-3D to the Unity-2D, but i don't know what your uses for Ubuntu are, and if you want a bunch of flashy eye-candy, than the unity-2D WILL NOT be what you want!\n", "Q: How to set up a network for a business I want to set up a network for a small business, of around a dozen desktop computers, to look after software and allow them to store files centrally*.\nHow do I go about doing this, and what equipment do I need?\nI expect the answer to this is too long to answer in full here, if this is the case, are there any recommended texts (where this process is taken step-by-step)?\n*presumably I need a server for this bit?\n\nA: A router & maybe a switch or two (depending on how many ports are on the router) and lots of ethernet cables will be needed to get packets moving.  A print server (I use a Trendnet TE100 to link my non-network-capable printer into my home network) or a network-capable printer would also be easier than \"everybody email Bob because he's the only one with a printer.\"\nYes, you'll want a server to store files centrally.  Probably the easiest way to force employees to store everything on the server instead of hoping they remember to drop copies on the server (which you will want to backup daily, so have a spare hard disk or two, in which case they can alternate being local/remote nightly) is to make their home folders be mounted over NFS, which would mean configuring /etc/fstab on each and setting their UID/GID in /etc/passwd & /etc/group to match their NFS UID.\nIf you want centralised login (which would let you have 1 user/pass for each employee -- handy if you want to be able to login to any computer, a VPN, email, or whatever other network services you'll be running internally), look at LDAP\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutofsLDAP\nIf you want to be able to force update installation and go around adding software to them all, you'll want to install openssh-server on each system to let you ssh in.  There are a few ways to send the same command to lots of systems, particularly in the clustering arena.  I use Terminator for my terminal emulator, so I'd find it easy to just open ssh connections to all of them and use the \"broadcast command\" feature.\n", "Q: How can I search for files in Unity? I'm trying to use the dash instead of gnome-do, but I can't find files. \"Find files\" only returns \"Top Results\".\nIn gnome-do, I was able to set some often-used directories to index. For example, I have a folder called \"ToRead\" that's full of pdf files. I could search for pdf. Then I can browse the pdf files in ToRead and open files without using my mouse. Ideally, I want to replicate this functionality within the Dash/Places interface. Is this possible?\nIf not, what's the shortest way to do it?\n\nClarifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Files & Folders\" does not do what I want. It only shows files I've used recently.\n\n*I'd like to be able to do this without using the mouse and without having to hit Tab hundreds of times.\n\n*I don't need my search to be indexed. A file system crawl (but only in the directories I set) is fine.\n\n\nA: I found the unity-place-python sample code and used that to create a lens to search your filesystem. It's currently kinda unstable, but you can search for files and you usually get results. \nUnity FileSearch Lens\nYou can access the lens in the Unity Launcher. You can see it here where I'm searching for \"lecture\".\n\nThe magnifying glass in the bottom left corner is the FileSearch Lens. (The icon changes based on your icon theme.) The lens shows files and folders in two separate sections.\nYou can add it to your main dash (Ubuntu button) by setting ShowGlobal=true in /usr/share/unity/places/filesearch.place. Unfortunately, Unity doesn't currently have a way to customize what lenses are in the Dash.\nThe files and folders sections are combined in the dash under the heading \"File Search\".\n\nConfig\nWhen filesearch-lens first runs, it will create a config file ~/.filesearch.cfg. You can customize the directories to search, how deep to search, and what folders to ignore.\nFor example, here's my config:\n[search]\n#dirs = a comma separated list of folders to search\ndirs = ~/data\n#depth = how deep from / to search\ndepth = 5\n\n[ignore]\n#pattern = python-style regex for directories to ignore\npattern = ^\\.|^bin$|^lib$|^apps$|^settings$|^eclipse$\n\nI want it to search ~/data and two directories below it and to ignore all dotfiles and some other specific folders. (Note: No, it's not smart enough to not search the same folders if you give it nested folders like ~/,~/code, so don't do that.)\nIf you change the config file, you need to restart the daemon to reload it:\nkillall unity-filesearch-daemon\n\nInstall\nI packaged it so you can download it from my ppa.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:pydave/unity-lenses\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unity-place-filesearch\n\nThen you need to reset unity before the lens will be noticed:\nsetsid unity\n\nExperimental Features\nIf you give it a path, it usually shows the path as one of the results (so you can open folders like you could in gnome-do).\nOne of the features I'm still trying to get working properly is the ability to type a path, a space, and then a search word to search in the path. Most of the time it works, but sometimes it fails to find anything (probably because the search is taking forever).\n\nA: So far the best (but unsatisfactory) method I've found is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Invoke dash. Type search and Enter to launch \"Search for files...\"\n\n*\n\n*I can simplify this step by adding a command keybinding for gnome-search-tool in CompizConfig.\n\n\n*Type my query.\n\n*Select the folder I want to search in.\n\n*Hit Find.\n\n\nBut navigating this interface requires many Tabs and selecting a folder is tedious since generally the folder I want is not in my bookmarks.\n", "Q: \"Showroom\" Installation of Ubuntu?

The freezing still exists, without Unity or even Gnome running, whenever I do anything mildly resource-hungry in Firefox.\nThanks for any guidance.\n\nA: I have had my T420 for just over a week and am experiencing multiple problems with it. I initially installed Ubuntu 11.04 32bit which installed fine, but would crash several times each day. So I switched to the classic interface, but still was experiencing the type of anomaly that you describe; the mouse pointer moves, but the interface is completely unresponsive to mouse clicks.\nI then decided to install 11.04 64bit since I will be upgrading the RAM soon. This install also went fine and soon had my system up and running. Unity still crashed frequently, so I switched to classic mode. However, this time I chose classic mode without effects. I have not experienced any crashing or locking up in the three days since I made this change.\nI would recommend that you try installing Natty again, but try running it in classic mode without effects until some of these bugs get worked out. I also recommend adding information to the bugs that have been already filed on Launchpad and also open new bug reports for problems that have not already been reported.\n\nA: I had the same or at least a similar issue with natty 64bit installed on a thinkpad L520 (sandy bridge, too). It didn't boot and showed only flickering green lines.\nWell, I found a solution by looking at the Grub2 documentation on a German Ubuntu site. There I stumbled over the following sentence: \"if there are boot problems with the default grub2 settings (black or distorted screen), then you should choose the following setting. With this setting a list of problematic graphic cards (\"blacklist\") is processed during boot.\" (rough translation)\nSo I added the following line in /etc/default/grub (open the file with sudo or gksudo):\nGRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=text\n\nsaved it and ran:\nsudo update-grub\n\nNow booting just runs fine.\nBest wishes, absurd\n", "Q: LibreOffice 3.3.2 \"Export to PDF\" option doesn't work After installing Natty 11.04 (Kubuntu), I noticed that the \"Export to PDF\" menu item doesn't work.

I have now upgraded to Ubuntu 11.04 and I found none of my profiles run under  Classic Ubuntu or Unity. They still run perfectly if I use the 'straight' Firefox 4 firefox-mozilla-build from the Ubuntuzilla PPA.\nThe error message is:\nFirefox  cannot use the profile \"??????\" because it is in use. To continue, close the running instance of Firefox or choose a different profile.\nThis message is apparently given if the profile is locked or if the profile can not be found. It is clearly not a stale lock file as it occurs when you try to create a new profile so it would seem firefox cannot find or has access blocked to the Profile.\nI have narrowed the problem down even further and my existing profiles will run in the default location ~/.mozilla/firefox or in a sub-folder below that location. I can also create new profiles in the same locations but not elsewhere.\nI have edited profiles.ini to see if it is related to the IsRelative addressing and that is not the cause as one can change a relative to absolute location without problems.\nI am baffled. Is this a bug in the modifications for Unity compatibility or a security feature which can be enabled/disabled? Any advice would be much appreciated.\n\nA: Create a symlink for the profile.\nln -s /Data/.mozilla/firefox ~/.mozilla/firefox\n\n\nA: The answer from comments below ended up being to change Firefox's AppArmor settings.\nBelow maintained for history\n\nFirst I would remove the firefox-mozilla-build, since Ubuntuzilla is no longer an active project. Also make sure your browser is actually using ~/.mozilla/firefox and not ~/.mozilla/firefox-4.0. Depending on the ppa you are using, the profiles will be cloned to different folders.\nI suppose you have already tried to delete the lock file under your profile.\nAs \"maco\" already pointed out, you can create a symlink for the entire profile folder. If that doesn't work (it should work), then verify the profile paths by opening the profiles.ini file with a text editor.\nI also recommend using the new standalone Profile Manager.\n", "Q: Authentication failure won't resolve in Ubuntu One today U1 started to throw an error when trying to connect.\nAt first I got a rather cryptic message (something with AUTH_FAILURE maybe?) upon which I found the following instructions:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOne/FAQ/WhatToDoWhenAuthenticationFails\nBecause none of the 3 possible causes described there turned out to be the case, I decided to remove my computer from the list of authenticated computers.

At the login screen, double-click on your name.  At that point, the bottom of the screen will have several options you can set before you log in.  Where it says \"Ubuntu\", click there and choose \"Ubuntu Classic\" instead.

Steps to reproduce are:\n1) Open Firefox\n2) Start a vertical scroll event on Touchpad (two-finger scroll, in my case)\n3) Quickly hit ctrl\nThe results are that Firefox will start zooming in or zooming out the page. I also experience this if I start a scroll event and quickly switch to a different workspace -- where my Terminal will start scrolling up or down. I would expect that the scroll event would die as soon a meta key is hit.\nI'm on a Thinkpad W510 on Ubuntu 11.04 using Unity. Here's all the info I can find on my Touchpad:\n[   10.808053] Synaptics Touchpad, model: 1, fw: 7.2, id: 0x1c0b1, caps: 0xd047b3/0xb40000/0xa0000\n[   10.863551] input: SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad as /devices/platform/i8042/serio1/input/input7\n\nA: Mouse events and keyboard events are independent.  In addition, the mouse wheel triggers multiple events, not a single event with a range.  You can think of this like a physical mousewheel that has click stops.  Each stop is a single event.  This is why a keyboard key does not cancel a mouse event and why continuing to scroll on your trackpad fires multiple events.\n", "Q: Bash auto complete for environment variables The bash autocomplete feature does not seem to work with environment variables in 11.04. \nThe current behavior is indicated below\nexport SCRIPT=/home/user/script\ncd $SCRIPT/<tab>\n\nresults in a backslash (\\) being added before $SCRIPT i.e. the prompt becomes\ncd \\$SCRIPT/\n\nSame thing happens if cd is substituted with ls or any other command\nAlso, if there is an executable file in the path contained in $SCRIPT and I want to run that \n$SCRIPT/<tab>\n\nBash does not show the options inside the folder (regardless of whether there is a single file or multiple files/directories inside the path contained in the environment variables). \nIn other words, autocomplete does not work with environment variables.\n\nA: The workaround suggested in http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2011-02/msg00274.html is:\n\n\n*\n\n*use <Tab>to auto-complete your environment variable s.t. you command line says cd $MYVAR\n\n*hit <Esc>+<Ctrl>-E to expand the current command line i.e. substitute $MYVAR by its value, the path\n\n*add a / and then enjoy <Tab> auto-completion as usual\n\n\nThis assumes you are in emacs mode (set -o emacs) and have bash_completion set up sensibly for cd (e.g. complete -o nospace -F _cd cd).\nUnfortunately this doesn't work in vi mode (set -o vi) because command line expansion is not available then.\n\nA: After typing the shell variable \ncd $SCRIPT/\n\ntype Cntrl-Alt-E.

How can I set this up?\n\nA: There is a plugin called \"ghost\" which allows you do to this in compiz (if you are using compiz). I haven't tested it for a while though.\nThis plugin is supposed to allow you to make a window unclickable (a \"ghost\" of sorts).\n", "Q: How do you zoom in and out while on a Skype call? I am using a Logitech Webcam Pro 9000 and Skype 2.2.0.25 and Ubuntu 11.04. I can not figure out how to zoom in and out during a video chat, although it is possible under windows using Logitech's software. Is this function supported under Skype and Ubuntu 11.04?\n\nA: I didn't find how to do this directly in Skype, but I could do this with a third-party GUI software: v4l2ucp (which you can install with this link). It is a control panel for v4l which normally handles Logitech webcams (my HD Pro C920 was supported out of the box).\nHere is what it looks like:\n\nAt the very bottom you have a Zoom, Absolute cursor that will allow you to zoom in and out, and adjust other settings too. The changes are reflected in real time in Skype.\nAs a small bonus, I wrote the following script to zoom in 150%, and set the video format to 1080p@30fps:\n#!/bin/sh\nv4l2-ctl --set-ctrl=zoom_absolute=150\nv4l2-ctl --set-fmt-video=width=1920,height=1080,pixelformat=1\nv4l2-ctl --set-parm=30\n\nsaved it to a file and set it to run automatically when my session starts. 150% is what worked best for me, and I can still change it dynamically with v4l2ucp whenever I want.\n\nA: The old keyboard shortcut works for many programs; give it a try while you have Skype open:\n\nCtrl +\n\nFrom terminal you can try the video adjustment package that's listed as supported for your model:\n\nguvcview -o\n\nRead more about it here.

I've been noticing lately that the chat bubble icon next to my username gets stuck with a bubble with three dots in it when I log into Ubuntu. The only way for me to resolve it is to set my status to \"away\" or \"busy\" and then go back to available. Does anyone have an idea why this happens or a way to resolve it?\n\nA: Do you have Skype chat enabled in Empathy? I am getting this behaviour, and have narrowed it down to the Empathy skype plugin, by enabling and disabling my different chat accounts, and then waiting for my computer to become 'idle'. The problem seems to disappear when I disable skype chat. Htorque mentions that this means that the system cannot determine one's status. So presumably, there is a bug with the Empathy skype plugin that prevents Empathy from guessing the status of Skype? (just guessing here)\nSteps to reproduce the bug: \n\n\n*\n\n*install pidgin-skype from the software centre and restart Empathy\n\n*enable skype chat in Empathy: first, launch the Skype app and log in, then back in Empathy choose Accounts> Add...> protocol=bigbrownchunx, enter your skype user name, play around with the options in case of errors.\n\n*Then to test, search for Screensaver in the Dash, select, remove the option to activate the screensaver, and set 'idle time' to 1 minute. Wait for one minute: does the icon with three dots pictured above appear?\n\n\nI have reported this as bug in pidgin-skype at Launchpad: bug #794191.\n\nA: It is where you can update your twitter, identi.ca etc. If you click on it you can update from there in the little box at the top without having to leave your desktop:\n        \n\nA: Not sure what caused this but I've got rid of it by doing the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go offline\n\n*Remove the Twitter account from the broadcast accounts\n\n*Add the Twitter account again and re-authorize it\n\n*Go online\n\n\nIt is probably because the Twitter account in Ubuntu has lost all/portion of its authorization to access Twitter.\nWorked for me and I hope it will work for you too.\n", "Q: Other Linux Distros deleting Ubuntu from GRUB Ok, so I installed Fedora on a dual boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu machine to see which distro I liked better, and now Ubuntu doesn't appear in the GRUB menu.  In fact, Windows doesn't either.  There are only two items, Fedora and Other (which boots Windows)  How do I get GRUB to recognize all installed operating systems?\n\nA: If you want to keep the Linux distributions as separate as possible, I would suggest only installing one distro's boot loader to the MBR (e.g. /dev/sda), and install the other distros' boot loaders into their respective partitions (e.g. /dev/sda1).  For whichever boot loader you've installed to the MBR, add entries that chain load to the partitions holding the other boot loaders.\nIf you use Ubuntu's grub as the main boot loader, you can add extra entries by editing /etc/grub.d/40_custom and adding entries like:\nmenuentry \"Other Linux\" {\n    # The partition holding the boot loader in Grub's syntax.\n    set root=(hd0,2)\n    chainloader +1\n}\n\nAfter saving the file, run sudo update-grub to assemble the Grub configuration file.\nThis should give each Linux distro its own boot loader configuration to play with and reduce the chance of them stepping on each others feet.  It will even handle the case of different distros expecting different boot loaders.\n", "Q: Cannot make Google Chrome Default browser \nPossible Duplicate:\nFirefox becomes default browser after upgrade. Cannot revert to Google Chrome \n\nI installed Chromium. It worked well. But I could not set it as default. It was there in my Dash, but every time I opened it, it asked me whether I want to set it as default. I even tried changing it in the Preferences. I could click on Make it my default browser but it didn't make a change. \nSo I installed Chrome Beta. It worked well initially. Following a last update (12.0.742.30 beta) this problem has started again. \nIs this is a bug? or is it just me? and how can I make Chrome remember my preference?\n(P.S. I don't want to switch to the stable channel.)\n[Update: I found a workaround that I select 'do not ask me again' when it asks me  for my preference. This stops the annoying messages, and since Chrome is the only browser on my Natty currently it is default in any case. But this restricts me from installing any other browser.]\n\nA: You can change \"Preferred Applications\" under System \\ Preferences \\ Preferred Applications\n(Classic Gnome) in Unity push the on\\off button and go through the settings to Preferred Applications.\n", "Q: How to make Vidalia work with Tor and Privoxy?

My settings in proxy are set to local host 8118.\nThis used to work, but now the IP address wont change.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: In order to use tor you need to have configuration set for privoxy. Tor itself recommends polipo to privoxy. Yet configuration for both polipo and privoxy is attached in official tor documentation.\nhttps://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-unix.html.en#polipo\nI havenot used vidalia but basically you need to restart tor with sudo /etc/init.d/tor restart after you setup configuration and setup your applications.\n", "Q: how to run a function as root in shell script I want to make a script and add this to a shortcut launcher...\nWhen i double click the icon, it will popup a terminal window (done)\nIn the terminal, it will ask for root password at first and then do some stuff with root privilege (I want to make it as a function).\nAfter that, at the end of the script, it will close the window like \"press any key to close window\" (I can do it)\n#!/bin/sh\ntouchpad(){\n    whoami\n}\nsudo -S touchpad # but it return error \"command not found\"\n\nHow to run a function as root user or is there another way to accomplish this?\nEDIT :\nI have tried this\n    #!/bin/bash\nsudo ./main2.sh #this did not work when I made it as a launcher\nexit \n\nThis is my current code (after googling):  \n#!/bin/bash\n\ngksudo -m \"Input Password\" clear\nsudo whoami\n#sudo bla bla bla\nread -n 1 -p \"Press any key to close window\"\n\nThis is what I want, but got an error when I type the wrong password for 3 times.\nHow to force quit the main window if gksudo fail??\n\nA: Test the return value of gksudo:\nif ! gksudo -m \"Input Password\" clear ; then\n    echo Bad password\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n\nA: IMHO ... Simplest way to run the entire script as root \nwithout having to remember that it needs to be run as root\nIt seems like it should work for what you are trying to accomplish\n#!/bin/bash\ndScript=$0\nif [[ ${UID} -gt 0 ]] ; then\n    sudo ${dScript}\n    exit\nfi\n### the rest of your script\n\n\nA: You can't. To do it, you need to put the function in another script, and run that script with sudo.\nSudo only runs commands, it cannot access functions inside your script, as it runs in a separate process. If you insist on running a function in your script, you could run the script again with sudo, but pass it an argument with $1 that runs the function directly.\n\nA: what about using gksudo instead? It will prompt user for entering password. Then it should work with just sudo.\n\nA: You actually can do that:\nAssuming that you are logged in as a root user and you want to run a function for a different user other than root, you can use export -f option in your script for that function. For example:\n#!/usr/local/bin/bash\n\nuser=\"${SUDO_USER:-$USER}\"\nwhomomlikes(){\n   echo \"Hello!! $(whoami)\";\n}\nmain()\n{\n  export -f whomomlikes;\n  su $user -c \"bash -c whomomlikes\";\n}\nmain;\n\nNot that it would only work for the exported function, if you have variables declared in other functions then you have to export them similarly and then run them accordingly.\n", "Q: What to do when Unity's Launcher gets stuck open? My Unity Launcher is currently stuck open. Short of logging out and back in, does anyone have ideas for getting it to auto-hide as usual?\n\nA: It turns out that the Launcher is supposed to stay open on workspaces containing no windows. Two of my workspaces had maximised windows which Unity didn't seem to be noticing, and when I closed those and then re-opened them, the Launcher reverted to its correct auto-hide behaviour.\nPerhaps one could also simply move the window to another workspace and back to get the Launcher unstuck--I did not think to try that.\n\nA: None of the methods above like Super S/Super-W, drag drops, min/max/move windows worked for me.\nOnly running ccsm, disabling Ubuntu Unity Plugin, and re-enabling it.\nUbuntu 11.10\n\nA: If you wish to have the launcher always autohide, you can use the Unity plugin in the CompizConfig Settings Manager. See this question for complete instructions. \n\n\n*\n\n*How can I configure Unity's launcher auto-hide behavior?\n\nA: I've had the same problems. SO annoying.  It seems to happen when I select and drag in certain programs.  So far in Menedely Desktop and QtiPlot.  The trick I've found is to go to a web page select text then begin to drag and the sidebar will go back to auto-hide.\n\nA: Yes, it's a bug. What i do is start the expo plugin using the shortcut key and the launcher hides after that.\n\nA: timmay143's workaround helped me. The bug seems to be fixed now: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/769703. Fix not released for Natty yet.\n\nA: I've had this issue for years. It looks like on Ubuntu v16.10, if I gesture on my trackpad with four fingers to the right, it opens the launcher permanently (disables autohide). If I gesture back left, it closes (reenables autohide). I don't see any other indication that I've changed workspaces.\n\nA: None of the suggested solutions work for me (16.10) - not even going into autosettings and disabling then enabling autohide.\nThe ubuntu \"start button\" is highlighted like it has focus.\nI could restart unity - but it's a pain when you have many docs open.\nThis is so annoying and I must admit that even though I like unity - the launcher is subpar - even if it wasn't buggy. \n", "Q: How to help improve Banshee?

One of them is pre-installed, and two of them you have to install yourself using Synaptic, for example.\nThese are: Configuration Editor (type gconf), dconf Editor (dconf-tools) and CompizConfig (compizconfig-settings-manager). Not all options in each of them are supported in Natty. Also, when you use CompizConfig, do not use things like Cube, and even for those parameters you can still use, changing them may make your Natty panel disappear -- just log off, and log in back.\nAs I know, the auto-save feature is not supported. The only thing you may still use the gconf editor is to choose the icons on the desktop: apps>nautilus>desktop. It is very useful as you may actually UNcheck volumes_visible, if you do not want the connected HDDs and stuff to appear on your desktop: in Natty they appear on the left panel anyway (you can change this -- see below). You may also define the opacity for your window captions: apps>gwd (make sure that Blur is on in CompizConfig).\ndconf Editor: here you have your Unity desktop options. Go to desktop>unity. form-factor defines whether the launcher (when you press Win) will be full-screen or not (it is not for laptops/desktops by default, and it is full-screen by default for smaller netbook screens). Now, in desktop>unity>devices you set if you want to see you hdds, usbs and other connected stuff on the left panel. You can check out other options as well.\nCompizConfig: you should be very familiar with this thing, but now not all features are supported.\n\nA: I forgot to say why you may not see Configuration Editor when you press Win and type 'config'. Though Configuration Editor is pre-installed in Natty, by default it is hidden. So, when you type 'config' in the launcher it does not show up. Instead, first, type and start Main Menu, go to System Tools and check Configuration Editor. You can also check many other programs you want quick access through the launcher.\nNow, when you press Win-key and type 'config' in the launcher, it should show Configuration Editor, so, you can easily start it without using the terminal.\nP.S. You may have to log off/in to force the launcher update its list of applications.\n", "Q: Chrome set system wide proxy when I set up a socket proxy in chrome and click the \"apply system wide\" button. does that mean that every software that connects to the internet is going to use that proxy, including chats and others?\nKind Regards\n\nA: yes it is.

Given Skype's slow development speed for the GNU/Linux version and its recent acquisition by Microsoft, I am looking for alternative softwares.\nWhat FLOSS (free/libre/open-source software) Skype alternatives are available?\n\nA: TOX is an open source project to build a code library establishing a messaging and video calling protocol, started with user privacy in mind. It provides and API, or core, around which user front-ends, or clients, can be built.\nThere are three Tox clients in development for Linux:\n. Venom - a cross-platform graphical user interface for Tox written in Vala using GTK+. Install instructions.\n. Blight - a cross-platform graphical user interface for Tox written in Racket that utilizes libtoxcore-racket. In very early pre-alpha stage.\n. Qt GUI for Tox - a cross-platform front end for Tox Core written in Qt5 and C++. Development is in very early stages and usage beyond testing is not advised.\n\nA: SIP Clients\nThese all are SIP clients which means they all can be used to call each other and they just need a SIP address (like your mobile number).

If you need it from one of these sources: google ;)).\nPacket Tracer is a powerful network simulator that can be utilized in \ntraining for CCNATM and CCNPTM certification exam by allowing students \nto create networks with an almost unlimited number of devices and to\n experience troubleshooting without having to buy real CiscoTM routers\n or switches.\n\nHow to install it in Ubuntu (should work in 11.04 too)\n\nA: You can install the Network Simulator (ns2) in Ubuntu by running:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ns2\n\nOr click here:\n\n", "Q: How to disable Mod4+S? I've installed a fresh 11.04. Then I've configured it to use Xmonad. In Xmonad I'm using Mod4+S to move through workspaces, but in new Ubuntu gnome-panel catches this shortcut earlier and shows me up with menu (same you see when pressing power button in the most right position in gnome panel).\nSo the subj is: How to disable Mod4+S in fresh Ubuntu 11.04?\nI've tried to scan with gconf for Mod4 and Super keys but found only compiz bindings (removing doesn't help). If I will configure Mod4+S for something in 'Keyboard shortcuts' it works, but after disabling it again shows me menu.\n\nA: As my problem is caused by a hardcoded key bindings to the indicator-applet I removed that code and pushed a clean indicator-applet to my PPA. The patch is the same as this one.\nPPA\n\nA: Go to CompizConfig Settings Manager , then click Desktop on the right side. Click Expo (Doesn't mean to uncheck, just go inside Expo). finally, at the top there will be Expo key. You can enable or disable that as you require. There it will be like s key.\nBy the way, if you don't have CompizConfig Settings Manager , the you can install from Software center. It's quite handy.\n", "Q: One IP address, Two Websites, on Two Machines I want to setup multiple (currently two) websites hosted on two different machines, using one external IP address. Each of these websites will be on different sub-domains or domains.\nIs there a way I could leverage Ubuntu server to ask as my entry point into my network (after my firewall) to direct traffic the the appropriate machine based on host header of some of means? I've done this in the past with Microsoft Proxy Server/ISA. Microsoft called this feature \"reverse-proxy\".\nThanks so much for your help\nMatt\n\nA: You can instlall Apache and set it up as a reverse proxy:\nsudo apt-get install apache2\nsudo a2enmod proxy proxy_http\n\nCreate an /etc/apache2/sites-available/site1 with the following contents:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n  ServerAdmin webmaster@site1.net\n  ServerName www.site1.net\n  ProxyPass / http://local_site1_server/\n  ProxyPreserveHost on\n</VirtualHost>\n\nThen\nsudo a2ensite site1\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\n\n\nA: You can setup a reverse-proxy using different tools such as Apache. You have to remember that in order to have multiple servers behind a single IP address, you need a couple of things:\n- a unique, local, IP address for each server behind that unique IP address\n- a way to uniquely distinguish the incoming traffic and redirect it appropriately\nThe traffic can be redirected based on different things that a reverse-proxy can handle:\n- The source IP address\n- The actual port used on the destination IP address (you)\n- for HTTP/HTTPS, you can also redirect based on the hostname part of the HTTP[S] header.\nThe third is probably the one you want to use, unless you are ready to advertise some web services running on a non-standard port. \nAnd of course, Security is always the priority and your setup should be either verified by an expert, or go through a deep scan to ensure it is not vulnerable to attacks. Keep your reverse-proxy or firewall software up-to-date at all time.\n\nA: Yes, there are a number of Linux web servers and proxy servers that can act as reverse proxies, sending page requests to different servers based on the host name in the http request. I'd recommend taking a look at nginx.\n", "Q: How do I select one window without opening others? Unity comes with so much changes.

A couple of days back I have registered a server with Hetzner with Ubuntu 11.04. \nI intend to work with PostgreSQL, for which I have installed from source after failing to install using apt-get. The installation as such doesn't fail, but the PostgreSQl service doesn't start automatically or when I try to start it manually. It fails with the following error message when I try to do anything with it:\nmanager@Ubuntu-1104-natty-32-minimal:~$ sudo su postgres -c psql template1\npsql: could not connect to server: No such file or directory\n    Is the server running locally and accepting\n    connections on Unix domain socket \"/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432\"?\n\nThis was the error I was getting when I had installed PostgreSQL using apt-get and I re-installed it from source.

Here is how I solved it\nTip: Looked at some pg package scripts\nsudo apt-get purge postgresql* # ending * is important\nsudo apt-get install postgresql\nI suspect either Hetzner's 11.04 image is buggy or it's Ubuntu's .deb (unlikely though).\n\nA: Answering my own question. This is kinda annoying, the first question on any StackExchange site doesn't go well for me. \nI had already done this, but somehow worked this time. Did this:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade \n\n*sudo apt-get purge postgresql*\n\n*sudo apt-get -f install \n\n*sudo apt-get install postgresql\n\n\nWorks like a charm. \nNote: adding the * in the purge command will purge all packages that begin with postgresql\n\nA: I have not seen this error on launchpad in associtiation with Natty. The same issue has been raised as a bug on launchpad for Hardy and got a fix. So following that logic I would expect it to be a bug and it is probably best practice to file a bug on launchpad.\nLooking further into it I found 2 interesting (yet old) topics showing the exact same error that seem worth looking into: \nThis topic from 2006 is talking about the exact same problem and claims that \nsudo /etc/init.d/postgresql-8.1 stop\nsudo /etc/init.d/postgresql-8.1 start\npsql template1\nworks.\nOn ubuntuforums there is a topic from 2008 about the same error and has a status 'solved'. Please have a look at the many suggestions in that topic.\n\nA: psql is the cli client, it does not start the PostgreSQL server. To start the server, you should use:\n\n  /etc/init.d/postgresql start\n\nthen you can connect to it using psql.\nTo have PostgreSQL start on boot, you should do the following:\n\n  update-rc.d postgresql enable\n\nYou might also take a look at this:\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/how-to-controlling-access-to-linux-services.html\n\nA: Running Ubuntu 14.04, I was having similar problems and couldn't get it working using the above solutions.

I thought it'd be a perfect opportunity to learn how to Linux.  I've got to admit that so far I'm really loving it (can't believe I've waited so long!)\nAnyways,  I've tried doing a bit of programming on it locally but VI in a terminal window can only get me so far (sorry to the old pros, but there's just some stuff I like GUI for).\nI've been looking through the options for a good text editor and have seen that GEDIT and GEANIE both have screenshots that look like the kind of thing I'd like to try (and Eclipse, but that means installing Java.. one step at a time).\nLast night I tried to install GEDIT and got as far as running ./configure on trying to compile it gave me a laundry list of missing libraries (including but possibly not limited to)\n gtk+3.0\n libgio\n .. (a bunch of others)\n\nI don't have all the requirements on hand as I am posting from a different computer (the ubuntu is at home).  If it's useful, I'll run the configure and copy-paste the list.  So far I've been able to find a few of the commands I need like apt-get install and searching for package names via apt-cache search \nThe problem that I'm having is that none of these CLI options seem to really match up well with the package names that GEDIT is looking for.\nFor example, I can type apt-get install gtk+3.0 which gives no package found or try apt-cache search gtk and get a list of some 100 packages with GTK in the title. Similarly - searching for libgio returns an option of libgio-2.0-fam but this is apparently not the package required by GEDIT.\nSo down to the bottom line of my actual question (I guess).\nWhat are some reliable strategies I can use to find the package name (the one I type in to install) that is associated with the package name that the application is expecting?\n\nA: Gedit is available by default in Applications > Accessories > Text Editor However, in the future to install software on Ubuntu you won't need to compile from source as ost of the software you'll come across is available in the software center.\nTo do so launch the Software Center from the top Applications Menu, search for the software via the search box then select install.\napt-get is, for all intents and purposes, the command line version of the Software Center. So apt-get install gedit would be the equivalent of installing GEdit from the Software Center interface.\n\nA: gedit is installed be default, but has been renamed to \"Text Editor\" in the Applications menu. Run it via Applications ▸ Accessories ▸ Text Editor.\nFor your question about finding which package to install, see: If I need a specific library how do I find out which packages can install that library?\n\nA: Gedit comes as default on Ubuntu. You can run it from Applications->Accessories->Gedit.\nIf you want to search for a package you can use aptitude commands search option, for example:\naptitude search gedit\n\n\nA: Firstly, I'd like to third the idea that compiling Gedit is a bit silly. That said, you should be able to solve most if not all its dependencies by running: sudo apt-get build-dep gedit\nWhen I'm solving deps manually, I use a combination of apt-cache search PKGNAME and grep \"-dev\" to narrow down the results.\n\nA: if you still want to compile Gedit. try this code below.\nit downloads the latest stable version of gedit which is not available.\nvia ubuntu-software-center this will take a couple of minutes.\nsudo apt-get build-dep gedit\n\ncd /tmp\nwget http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gedit/3.2/gedit-3.2.6.tar.xz\ntar Jxf gedit-3.2.6.tar.xz\ncd gedit-3.2.6\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nSource:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to compile and install gedit(-dash) in Ubuntu 11.10 - EuroBytes\n\nA: If you want to install from source bear in mind that the source version will mean you are going to need to have the latest development libraries and, this is not going to be easy to pull off if you are running 10.4 and I suspect you will be wasting your time to be honest.\nIf you want to install gedit to develop on it then you are best off using ubuntu 13.10 at least and then using jhbuild build tool to work on the source code after installing it with its dependencies and the required development libraries.\n", "Q: After using Ubuntu installer for Windows, the monitor button enters a p I ran the Ubuntu installer for Windows (Wubi) and now my fn+f4 button does not work in Windows anymore.

This is hardcoded in your hardware.\nhttp://mjg59.livejournal.com/121851.html\n\nA: The reason why it is displaying a p is because the monitor switching function is still activated, if you're using Windows 7, just hit fn+F4 again and it will display the several display options, choose the one you need and hit Enter, this will deactivate the function and the F4 will become normal again.\n", "Q: I am looking for an easy to use graphical data recovery program I am looking for a easy to use, easy to install, data recovery application (like recuva)\nI have tried test disk and haven't figured out how to it.\nSo my question is. does anyone know of a easy to use (including easy to install) data recovery application for ubuntu.\n\nA: The Autopsy Forensic Browser (Available in the software center) is a graphical interface to SleuthKit.\n\n", "Q: cannot insert backslash with bash, python, works fine with csh, idle I have a strange problem with inserting backslashes (Ubuntu 10.10 and 11.04,\nthe upgrade changed nothing).\nThe key combination on my keyboard (Swedish Thinkpad T400) is AltGr + ?.\nHowever, this seems not to be the problem, as it only appears with some\nprograms.\nWith for instance bash 4.2, python 2.7, python 3.2, swipl 5.10\nI cannot type nor copy-paste backslash into the terminal. \nWith ash, csh, ghci, nano, vi, idle, idle3 everything behaves as \nexpected, I can both type and copy-paste.

It also does not work with gnome-terminal and xterm, but these two indicate error (by flashing). Ideas about what to check?\nUPDATE: Problem is solved, thanks to Gilles! It was a misconfiguration of the readline library (.inputrc)\nMarcus\n\nA: I think the programs you're using all use the readline library to read input. So I guess you've misconfigured the readline library. The system configuration file is /etc/inputrc and the per-user file is ~/.inputrc. You probably put one backslash too much in a binding, so that instead of binding a command to an escape sequence you've bound it to a sequence beginning with a backslash.\nRight:  \"\\e[1;5C\": forward-word  (escape sequence sent by Ctrl+Left)\nWrong:  \"\\\\e[1;5C\": forward-word  (\\ e [ 1 ; 5 C)\nIf the problem was only in bash, the problematic binding would be in ~/.bashrc. Note that in .bashrc, that binding above would be written bind \"\\\\e[1;5C: forward-word\", with two backslashes because bash does a round of backslash expansion before passing the definition down to readline. (bind '\\e[1;5C: forward-word' would also work, since backslashes lose their special meaning within single quotes.)\n", "Q: Shutdown logs out instead of shutting down Many times (not all the time) when I want to shutdown or restart, the computer does not shutdown but goes to the  screen for changing the user.

This happens if the user installed Ubuntu One with one account and then sets up the computer again with a different account (but all the old Ubuntu One files in ~/.local/share/ubuntuone are still there under the old account). Working around this:\nOpen Applications->Accessories->Terminal and run:\nu1sdtool -q; killall ubuntuone-login ubuntuone-preferences;\nsudo rm -rf ~/.local/share/ubuntuone\nrm -rf ~/.cache/ubuntuone\nrm -rf ~/.config/ubuntuone\nmv ~/Ubuntu\\ One/ ~/Ubuntu\\ One_old/ \n\nOpen Applications->Accessories->Passwords and Encryption Keys, go to the Passwords tab, delete the Ubuntu One and Desktopcouch tokens by right-clicking on them and selecting \"Delete\".\nBack in a terminal session, run:\nu1sdtool -q; killall ubuntuone-login; u1sdtool -c \n\n\nTo get things functioning again, all I had to do was delete my ~/.local/share/ubuntuone directory as indicated above.

The problem is that when I have a window on my right monitor it does not show up in the panel.\n\nNotice that vim is on the left, it shows up in the task area, so does the help, which spans.  Chrome which is entirely on the right does not show up.\nIs this a bug and how can I fix it?\n\nA: Left of your workspace switcher in the bottom panel there is a little handle - that does belong to a second window list applet. Right-click on the handle and remove it (Remove From Panel), then log out and back in and the other one should work again.\nIf it's still acting up, you can try to show windows from all workspaces in the remaining window list.

Toggling the touch pad using the function keys does not help, suspending and resuming it does, tough.\nIs there an easier way to reset the synaptics driver than going to standby mode and waking the notebook up again?\n\nA: Try pressing Fn+F7 or Fn+F8.

If you have journaling turned on for the ext4 filesystem though, that might slow things down.\nHowever, the main benefit of tmpfs is that it only uses as much RAM (or swap) as is needed to store the files.  In contrast, a 500MB ramdisk will use that much RAM whether it is 10% full or 100% full.\n\nA: tmpfs of course.  It also avoids having to preallocate a fixed size of ram.  One common disk benchmark is bonnie++.\n", "Q: Can't play stunt rally everytime I try to start stunt rally via the command prompt I get following error..\n./stuntrally: error while loading shared libraries: libOgreMain.so.1.7.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nany ideas???\nI am running Natty 32bit\n\nA: The default download of the game from PlayDeb has an error.

I cannot copy/paste from Ubuntu to Java in either direction. However, IcedTea can copy to itself - that is, I can cut text from a Java applet and paste it into another part of that same applet. Other than this, clipboard support is fine across the rest of Ubuntu. Is there anything I can do to fix this?\n\nA: gksudo gedit /etc/java-6-sun/security/java.policy\n\nand/or\ngksudo gedit /etc/java-6-openjdk/security/java.policy\n\nor (for example)\ngksudo gedit /opt/java/64/jre1.7.0_04/lib/security/java.policy\n\nAdd the following line down the bottom before the last closing bracket.\npermission java.awt.AWTPermission \"accessClipboard\";\n\nIf you are having trouble finding the correct java.policy file to edit, you can try to locate the file using\n$ sudo find / -name \"*java.policy\"\n\n\nA: Similar to brendan's answer, but the silly reputation system means I have to spam with a totally new answer...\nOn my system (Ubuntu 12.04 running Oracle Java 1.7.0_04), I had to modify a different file, with\ngksu gedit /opt/java/64/jre1.7.0_04/lib/security/java.policy\n\nThen, as per brendan's answer, add the following line down the bottom before the last closing bracket.\npermission java.awt.AWTPermission \"accessClipboard\";\n\nIf you are having trouble finding the correct java.policy file to edit, you can try to locate the file using\n$ sudo find / -name \"*java.policy\"\n\nI experienced this problem on an embedded applet in Firefox, and had to restart Firefox after editing the file.\n[Feel free to delete this if my edits to brendan's posts get accepted, but I also wanted to comment in his answer with my version of Ubuntu and Java.]\n\nA: I have this problem when copying text from Opera and trying to paste it in firefox and vice versa.  I solve this by opening the Text Editor and pasting in it.  Then I cut the text from the Text Editor and paste it in where ever I want.\n\nA: The solution provided by brendan works, but it requires root access. To fix this issue with user rights, copy the file /etc/java-7-openjdk/security/java.policy to $HOME/.java/ and change the following line before the last closing brace:\npermission java.awt.AWTPermission \"accessClipboard\";\n\nIf you use a different java version than java-7-openjdk change the path occordingly. You find the correct path with locate java.policy.\n\nA: For Opera --> Firefox. You use any clipboard manager eg Parcelite.\n", "Q: How do I right click with a Magic Trackpad? I can't seem to right click with my Magic Trackpad on Ubuntu 11.04. On maverick, a two-finger tap would do, but in natty it seems to be assigned to middle click, and three-finger tap is assigned to dragging a window.\nMy Magic Trackpad is basically unusable because of this, with many programs requiring right click and very few even using the middle click (still, I'd like to have both. maybe have three-finger tap as middle click and four-finger drag window?)\n\nA: Right Click with Two Fingers does work with the Magic trackpad by default in Ubuntu 11.04. Under Mouse Preferences in the Control Panel you will also find a \"Touchpad\" tab with more configuration options. \nTry removing all trackpad entries from your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file. Some  settings that were needed for earlier versions of ubuntu are not needed to get the Magic Trackpad to work and some legacy settings cause unexpected problems like yours - left and right click not working as expected.\n", "Q: How do I get classic (not unity) desktop from run from the Live CD?

This is accomplished with the command\ngnome-session-save --logout\n\nrun from a terminal or from the dash after you use Alt-F2 shortcut.\nNext, to login again, select other from the list of users, type in ubuntu as username and press enter.\nAt this point it appears the session chooser in the bottom panel.

I keep accidentally clicking while typing (disable while typing seems to have little use).\nOther possible solutions to my issue: Hold a key to enable click of the touchpad. This way I can do work while holding key, otherwise it becomes inactive (ideal).\nI cannot disable tough-to-click since the buttons on the touchpad are touch-enabled and very hard to press. You can imagine how painful/inaccurate that setup becomes.\n\nA: Go to Mouse settings. Under the General tab, there should be a slider for adjusting sensitivity under the Pointer Speed category.\nI don't know if there's a way to hold a key down to toggle the touchpad on and off, but you can set a keyboard shortcut to do so. Open up Keyboard Shortcuts, then press the 'Add' button and, under command, enter gconftool-2 /desktop/gnome/peripherals/touchpad/touchpad_enabled --toggle. Enter a name for the action, e.g. 'Toggle touchpad'.

Something I also liked & found quite useful was the Mac Expose-like feature when clicking on open application icons.\nIf there was an Ubuntu release convincing enough to ditch Windows, I'd say Natty was it.\nCongratulations!\n\nA: Hopefully this problem with file dialogues will be fixed in 11.10, but for now, you can drag the window by holding alt and dragging with the mouse.\n", "Q: Getting only a flashing cursor on boot after a forced shutdown, how do I repair the system? A program started misbehaving, and quickly ate up all 4GB of my RAM and 2GB of my swap. This meant the system came to a crawl. So I forced a shutdown. \nNow, when I reboot, where I would normally get a GRUB screen, or an Ubuntu screen, but I only get a flashing cursor, after the POST screen. \nPreferably without reinstalling, what can I do to fix this?

This first stage is a tiny program that is stored at the start of your hard disk, at the MBR (Master Boot Record). It has the purpose of loading up the second stage of GRUB, which is located in your Ubuntu partition.\nSo, if GRUB cannot do something meaningful, then most probably the partition is in a mess, cannot be accessed by this cut-down version of GRUB. So you need to use the LiveUSB (or LiveCD) to perform a filesystem check.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from an Ubuntu LiveUSB (or LiveCD)\n\n*Start System » Administation » Disk Utility\n\n*Perform a filesystem check on your Ubuntu partition.\n\n*Shutdown the computer.\n\n*Start your again in order to check whether the issue has been resolved!\n\n\nA: Answered by OP in comments:\n\nHmm, I solved my problem - an SD card was stopping the system from booting!\n\n", "Q: How can I get an indicator icon for new updates? I don’t want Update Manager popping up on its own, but I do want to be notified that there are new updates.  In older Ubuntu releases (I don’t remember how old), an icon would display in the notification area if there were updates available, with a different look if there were security updates.  I could either bring up a terminal and do sudo apt-get upgrade or just click the icon to bring up Update Manager.  In 10.10 I ran this command to get that behavior back:\ngconftool -s --type bool /apps/update-notifier/auto_launch false\nThat was working great, but now that I’m running 11.04 with Unity, nothing shows up at all.  If I do sudo apt-get upgrade in terminal it installs updates if there are any, but there aren’t always updates and I’d like the nice non-invasive reminder icon back if at all possible.  I’ve read about Unity hiding some indicator icons so maybe that’s what’s happening here?\n\nA: I logged in this morning and had my updates icon, just as I wanted!  Here’s what worked to get this working using commands in the terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check what’s already allowed using gsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist since you probably don’t want to turn anything off.  My default value was ['JavaEmbeddedFrame', 'Mumble', 'Wine', 'Skype', 'hp-systray', 'scp-dbus-service'].\n\n*If you suspect you have other missing icons (for example, Pidgin), you can find the correct values to add to the list with grep TrayChild ~/.xsession-errors ― if something tried to add itself to the tray it will show up with the name the system knows it by.\n\n*Add update-notifier (and anything else you found in step 2) to the list.  If you had the same default values as I did, use this command:  gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist \"['JavaEmbeddedFrame', 'Mumble', 'Wine', 'Skype', 'hp-systray', 'scp-dbus-service', 'update-notifier']\"\n\n*Now set update notifier not to auto-launch (this is from the question):  gconftool -s --type bool /apps/update-notifier/auto_launch false\nNext time there are updates, you get the icon notifying you ― hooray!\n\nA: \nI’ve read about Unity hiding some indicator icons so maybe that’s what’s happening here?\n\nIf you do not have dconf-tools installed, install it. Run it (from the terminal or from the launcher: if you do not see it when you type dconf in the launcher, check Main Menu settings), go to desktop>unity>panel. Here you have the list of all classes that Unity allows in the systray.\nAdd your class there, or change the whole string to ['all'] to allow everything.\n\nA: Maybe this helps:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist \"['JavaEmbeddedFrame', 'Mumble', 'Wine', 'Skype', 'hp-systray','update-manager']\"\n\n", "Q: When I select and deselect some file on my desktop, an orange line appears near the file name When I select and deselect some file on my desktop, an orange line appears near the file name. Why does this happen?\n\nA: As part of the way that an entry is highlighted, the name is surrounded by an orange bar as an additional visual indication of which item has been selected, and to draw attention to the name of the selected item, which may help differentiate from other similar items.\nYou may notice this same behaviour for files shown anywhere in nautilus: the name is surrounded by a rounded rectangle (this is more clearly defined as the shape for items with very long names, preferably containing spaces, which wrap).\nThis behaviour may be changed by selecting an alternate theme in the Appearance control panel.  Note that alternate themes may well also highlight the name of the icon, but perhaps in a different way, or in a different colour.\nOn the other hand, if I've misinterpreted your question, and you have a thin orange line appearing near anything you select, and staying there for a while when you select something else, you've probably found a display update bug of some sort: please report it as a bug against nautilus (nautilus may not ultimately be at fault, but it is essential to replication, and will help to find the actual bug).\n", "Q: Set up a Serial-to-Ethernet Converter With a Virtual Serial Port I have a '3one data' brand serial-to ethernet converter, that plugs into a serial device at one end, and allows bidirectional communications with the device over an ethernet connection, like this: \n\nThere is supposedly a way to set up a virtual serial port in Ubuntu, which maps to the IP and port of this device and allows transparent communication with the real serial device on the other end. Unfortunately there was no linux documentation accompanying this device, despite the fact that linux support was prominently advertised.\nI am struggling with setting up this virtual serial port in Ubuntu, which I believe should be achieved through the ttyd command. However, with the device connected (I can telnet into it directly), if I run:\nsudo ttyd -d /dev/ttyp1 192.168.1.25 50000 -b 115200 -p 8NC0\n\nmy understanding is that a new virtual serial device should be created, /dev/ttyp1, but this doesn't happen. The ttyd command above does not throw any errors.\n\nA: OP has brought another device:\n\nThat was a typo. Fixed now. I came to the conclusion that this device requires a kernel driver (that doesn't exist), so I ended up getting another device - a Moxa Nport 5250A Serial Device Server, which has drivers for 2.4-2.6 kernels. It seems to be working well. I'm sure the original 3one data device would have worked if they actually wrote a driver for it. \n\n\nA: I have not worked with that brand before, but most such devices use the telnet protocol for network communications.  Depending on what you are wanting to do, the simplest solution is often to just have your program connect over telnet.  Less simply, I recall there being a few programs in the repository for redirecting serial ports over the network, but I can not remember their names.\nIf the protocol the device uses for network communication is proprietary, you may well be out of luck.\n\nA: Did you try just telneting into the device? Looking at the datasheet it looks like it's pretty basic. Presuming the ip address is 192.168.1.25 and port 50000:\ntelnet 192.168.1.25 50000\n\n", "Q: How to create a bootable install on USB with the minimal CD?

Here is a problem I met: I would like find the corresponding CentOS /etc/syslog.conf file in Ubuntu? Basically, the file is used to control where those syslog files go? \n\nA: Ubuntu uses rsyslog, config files are rsyslog.conf and /etc/rsyslog.d/*\n\nA: Minor addition:\nUbuntu uses rsyslog.conf (5) configuration file and the daemon is rsyslogd (8) is a rocket-fast system for log processing. \nRsyslog.conf is backward-compatible  with syslogd's syslog.conf file.

Ideally, I'd like to be able to plug it in, be prompted for apt to get the necessary driver package, and just have to logoff/login or restart to get the monitor connected to the DisplayLink (or any USB display device, e.g. Lilliput) to be a part of my normal desktop, including my other two monitors acting as a single desktop.\nWhat needs to happen in order for this process to be as simple as this?\n\nA: The simple answer is that with the current state of X hotplug, you can't.  If you're sufficiently motivated, my (extremely limited) understanding of the stack of work to do is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*1) Test/verify XRandR support in xserver-xorg-video-displaylink\n\n*2) Add a udev rule that calls a hotplug activation script\n\n*3) Have the activation script initialise the device, and send RROutputChangeNotifyEvent to X\n\n*4) Troubleshoot the known issues with receipt of RROutputChangeNotifyEvent that makes it currently only work with certain types of hardware device (something about polling)\n\n\nOnce you get this far, you should be able to attach a displaylink device after X is running, and have it initialised.  Precisely how your session deals with the device as a secondary display will be an amusing source of bugs: there's lots of corner cases dealing with very small displays (some common displaylink devices are 800x480 or smaller), or with difficulties allocating sufficient VRAM (displaylink has interesting handling routines for very high-resolution displays).\nBUT this isn't really complete, because you'll need to reattach it and reinitialise it each and every time you want to use it.  For a richer solution, one needs to enable hotplugging at a deeper level, which can also be used for coldplugging:\n\n\n*\n\n*a) Implement DDC/EDID polling/handling for displaylink\n\n*b) Implement USB bus polling during X initialisation\n\n*c) Test/verify XRandR support in xorg-xserver-video-displaylink\n\n*d) Add udev hints for displaylink devices to tell X how to detect them\n\n\nDepending on precisely how b) is implemented, this should also cover the hotplug case also, by sending attributes to X in the udev rules (compare to how X input hotplugging support in udev is enabled).  An added advantage of this implementation is that it likely also ends up adding support for USB display adaptors that use the sisusb driver (although that would need separate testing).\nIf you're actually interested in this level of implementation, I strongly advise you to carefully review wiki.x.org, and discuss this with the X developers.  Several people have looked at the problem before, but all seem to have become distracted by something else at some time in the process.\nIf the above is all complete, the user experience should be: Attach a device.  Install the driver.  Watch it work (no logout/login, no reboot, etc.).  Note that the user will not be prompted to install the driver on hardware detect, which is an entirely separate problem, and I think I've gone on long enough in this answer to leave that for another time.\n", "Q: Is there a way to change the icon of a running application on the Gnome panel? I would like to change the icon of running applications like Opera. When running both Opera Next and Opera, the two versions both appear at the top panel, but both are in red. I want to change the Opera Next icon so it is easier to identify when the windows are minimized.\nIs there a way to change the icons that show for running applications in the panel?\n\nA: The solution is the same as for this Question:\nHow do I add a name to a launcher?\ncreate a *.desktop file like I describe there and set the Icon to the path were you put the icon you want to use.\nThis will change the launcher icon system wide changing it just for the unity panel at runtime is not possible as far as I know\n", "Q: Why isn't LMRoman17 font available in libreoffice? LMRoman17 is installed by default in Ubuntu.  The font file is lmr17.pfb.\nI can use this font in the gimp, but not libreoffice writer.  The strange thing is that LMRoman10 (lmr10.pfb) IS available in libreoffice.  What's going on?\n\nA: Have you tried rebuilding your font cache? It helps in a lot of cases.\nrm ~/.fontconfig\nsudo fc-cache -f -v\n\n\nA: I have had the same problem with other sizes of the LModern family, e.g. lmroman8. I wanted to use this font for the footnote-style.\nThe LModern fonts are available to LibreOffice and OpenOffice through /usr/share/fonts/X11/type1.\nThis directory consists of symbolic links to the font files in /usr/share/texmf, but only for size (in german \"entwurfsgröße\") 10.\nI solved that problem by simply creating a directory /usr/share/fonts/Type1/lm and copying the content of /usr/share/texmf/fonts/type1/public/lm and /usr/share/texmf/fonts/afm/public/lm to that directory. Maybe one could use the opentype fonts in /usr/share/texmf/fonts/opentype/public/lm respectively. This directories contain all faces of the lmodern family.\nYou need an fc-cache afterwards.\n", "Q: How to make the lock screen look like the login screen? Is there any way to make the login screen from a locked session (either by using Ctrl+Alt+L or from a screen timeout) look like the login screen when you're starting a new session? I hate that everything on the lock screen aside from the password input is black. \n\nA: GDM\nThe answer may be a little bit late, but aside from setting the theme of the actual unlock dialog you can also set the background (i.e. the black space around the dialog) to whatever image you like. Just run the following command in the terminal:\nsudo gconftool-2 --direct --config-source xml:readwrite:/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.defaults --set /desktop/gnome/background/picture_filename --type string /usr/share/backgrounds/Holes_by_FireCobold.jpg\n\nReplace the last path in the command with the path to the image you desire to use. Do not forget to restart your desktop session (or try to restart gconfd-2 by killing it, at least).\nEDIT: unless you configured the background of the login screen (e.g. via Ubuntu Tweak), the above command will also change it.\n\nA: LightDM\nThis was planned 12.04 -here is the bug report.  However, it did not make the final release.\n\n*\n\n*How do I subscribe to a bug?\n\nA: If you are somewhat proficient at C and a little bit of GTK, it's possible to have the lock screen look like (but not be!) the login screen -- since your main concern seems to be the ugliness of the lock box?\nYou'd do this by modifying the sources of the gnome-screensaver package, which provides the lock screen. \nFor tips, please see the How did you figure this out? section at the end of this answer. The original question was about repositioning the lock-box to the bottom-left instead of the center. For what you want, you'd move it to the left, make the grey background transparent, and change the sizes of the username and \"Password:\" text appropriately.\nFrom my experience, the code you need to change is most probably only in two files: gs-lock-plug.c and gs-windows-x11.c.\nIf you try this and have any questions, please ask in a comment and I'll try my best to point you in the right direction.\n\nA: GDM\nYou can't make the lock screen look like the login screen.\nHowever, you can use a theme for the lock screen. There are quite a few available at gnome-look.org. Here's an example.\n\nA: Light DM\nThis tweak works by replacing call to OnScreen Virtual Keyboard with that of LightDM. A better tweak would be to replace the call to Gnome ScreenSaver Lockscreen(Ubuntu's default LockScreen till Ubuntu 13.10) with one to Unity Greeter(Ubuntu's default Login Screen), but I couldn't find any way to do that.\n\nMethod:\nOpen Dconf Editor,select the schema org.gnome.desktop.screensaver,edit the variable embedded-keyboard-command and replace it's contents with\ndbus-launch gdmflexiserver -xnest\n\n, and then check embedded-keyboard-enabled for the same schema.\nShortcut Commands:\nFor the Terminal lovers and lazy ones out there,you can do the above settings with just 2 commands:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver embedded-keyboard-command \"dbus-launch gdmflexiserver -xnest\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver embedded-keyboard-enabled true\n\nFrom now onwards, Ubuntu Login Screen (Unity Greeter) appears every time the system wake from either Screensaver (Lock Screen) or Suspend.\n\nThis method was provided by alina on the Ubuntu Discourse thread Wake from screensaver directly to the login screen. I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and this method works fine. May work on 12.10,13.04 and 13.10 too.\nA limitation with this method is that you'll see the Gnome Screensaver LockScreen for a second before seeing Unity Greeter. Also, as Unity Greeter isn't designed for locking screen, it's not as fast and fluid as the default Lock Screen. Ubuntu 14.04 LTS will find a solution to these problems by using Light Locker instead of Gnome Screensaver LockScreen.\n", "Q: Computer restarts instead of shutting down My Ubuntu 11.04 will not shutdown when I tell it to; it will instead restart the computer.\n\nA: maybe try \nsudo shutdown -P now \n\nIf that works, then the problem is related to the desktop environment that you're using.\n\nA: As this problem can come from bad interactions between hardware, if you're technically skilled, you might want to try to rule out that possibility by booting your PC with as many components as possible disconnected.\nMy mother had this exact same problem and, when I upgraded her to a new PC a few months ago, the problem followed along. I ended up tracking it down to her PCI FaxModem card. When I removed that, the system started shutting down properly.\n(And I'm pretty sure, back when we first built the machine, we assumed it was a BIOS bug because even Windows suffered from it)\n\nA: I used to have that issue with an old PC. If I recall correctly, it would reboot if I told it to shut down, but if I told it to reboot, then it would halt, but not power off. It was a weird hardware issue and I can't remember if I attempted to fix it or if I just learned to live with it. \nYou should file a bug on http://www.launchpad.net, probably using linux--generic as the package. Provide as much details as you possibly can, and maybe it'll get fixed.\n", "Q: Assign run command for all media files Currently Totem/Movie Player opens and plays any type of media files, be it audio or video - is there a way to change that run command?\nEDIT\nI am already aware of properties option from right-click's context menu, but as I said, I want to change the run command for all items considered to be media files.\n\nA: *\n\n*First Install Ubuntu Tweak from this site.\n\n*Launch it by searching for it from the dash .\n\n*Go to the  System -> File Type Manager .\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Select all formats of the category you want by pressing Ctrl + A .\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Now click on the edit button and select the application you want to open the formats .\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Done .\n\n\nA: A command to change file associations command style is mimeopen. This is an interaction though since it prompts for an answer while showing a list of possible options. Also this requires you to do this for every file association. There is not 1 command to change all media files to 1 application but you can work around this.\nThe users preferences are stored inside ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list. The system wide file associations are stored in /usr/share/applications/defaults.list. \nYou can display all relations to video with this:\ncat /usr/share/applications/defaults.list | grep video\nYou could use this to add all video references to the local version like so:\ncat /usr/share/applications/defaults.list | grep video >> ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list.  (~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list probably has not got the right permission to change it so you will need to change it first).\nAfter that you need to change all references in ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list to =totem.desktop to ={yourprefferedapp}.dekstop. {yourprefferedapp} could be vlc or any other reference to a video playing utility.\n(do not to forget to rest the permissions for ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list (needs to be 755).\nSame can be applied to 'audio' or any other file association. \nEven so this still requires your system to have ALL media types present and I do not believe that is the case. \n\nA: Right click on a file -> Properties -> Open With. There you can choose another default application for each media type.\n", "Q: Can't Right-Click Top Menu Bar I wanted to move the top menu bar to the bottom of my desktop, rather than the top.

No menu or anything.\nRight-clicking works fine everywhere else.  Is there some hidden setting that's preventing me from messing with it?\n\nA: It sounds like you are using the new Unity user interface.  The panel at the top is not provided by gnome-panel, so tutorials about gnome-panel won't necessarily be correct.\nThere is no way to move Unity's panel to another edge of the screen.\n\nA: You are probably using Ubuntu 11.04 with Unity.\nIf you want to configure your Desktop in that way, you need to switch to Ubuntu Classic at the bottom of the login-screen.\nThere you can use the configurable Gnome-Panel the classic way.\nIf you don't want to miss the Unity Launcher Bar on the left, you could try to install docky and put it on the left of the Desktop.

I have this problem on my laptop at home AND on my laptop at work.\nI both cases, I installed Apache in Ubuntu 10.10 some months ago, used it for several weeks without a glitch, but then one day I stopped it and now it no longer starts automatically. I tried running the update rc for it manually, but was told the init script is already in use.\nHowever, starting/restarting it manually with \nsudo service apache2 start/restart\n\nworks fine. In both cases, I let it be until after the upgrade to 11.04, because I hoped it would be solved by the new version. But it's not! I'd be grateful if someone can tell me how to have Apache start automatically once more.\n\nA: In this case, I found out why Apache wouldn't start. I could not find a trace of this in the startup logs, only in the output printed to the screen on bootup.\nBut here you go: The last line in the script /etc/apache2/apache2.conf failed.\nWhy?\nIt says:\nInclude sites-enabled/\nHowever, two of the sites I've set up are located in my own home directory - which is encrypted!\nSo, on bootup (during startup of Apache) these sites don't exist, and Apache fails and refuses to run.\nSolution?\nI've created a small script called \"disable_sites\" and symlinked it into /etc/rc0.d and /etc/rc6.d (shutdown and reboot):\n#!/bin/bash\n\n/usr/sbin/a2dissite vvsshop\n/usr/sbin/a2dissite neoflex\n/etc/init.d/apache2 reload\n\nexit 0\n\nI also made a script to re-enable the sites whenever I log in and added it as a startup program in my System Settings. So now it works!\nSo, I suppose the lesson here is that when Apache inexplicably fails to load during bootup and  you can't find any errors in the logs or when starting the server manually, check if all the directories it needs are available. This could probably also be solved in some other way.\n\nA: Try to run\nupdate-rc.d apache2 enable [list of run levels]\n\nas root.\nYou may interested to read \nman update-rc.d\n\n\nA: I'm adding this answer based on recent issues I encountered with the same symptoms.\nFirst some background data:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu uses scripts in the /etc/init.d/ folder to start/stop services.\n\n*Ubuntu uses symlinks to those /etc/init.d/ scripts, stored in the /etc/rc#.d/ folders, to start/stop services based on the \"runlevel\".\n\n*Symlinks that start with an \"S\" indicate that the service should be started.\n\n*Symlinks that start with a \"K\" indicate that the service should be stopped (killed).\n\n*Runlevel 1 executes the scripts symlinked in /etc/rc1.d/, runlevel 2 uses /etc/rc2.d/, and so on.\n\n*The default runlevel for Ubuntu is 2.\n\n*Installation of Apache essentially runs sudo update-rc.d apache2 defaults which creates the appropriate symlinks in the /etc/rc#.d/ folders.\n\n\nSo it seems that on my server something, or someone, at some point ran sudo update-rc.d apache2 disable which removed all the \"S\" symlinks and replaced them with \"K\" symlinks. Thus killing, or just not starting, Apache when initializing any of the runlevels.\nMy solution was just to re-enable Apache: \nsudo update-rc.d apache2 enable\n\nNow Apache starts/stops as expected when starting up or switching runlevels.\nNB:\nIt's worth noting that just running sudo update-rc.d apache2 defaults again is insufficient because it sees that symlinks exist and considers that they are what is wanted. It just responds with:\nSystem start/stop links for /etc/init.d/apache2 already exist.\n\n\nA: For others looking (googling) for this issue check that if you run:\nchkconfig |grep httpd\n\nyou get \n\nhttpd             0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off\n\nelse do: \nchkconfig httpd on\n\n(sorry on ubuntu chkconfig equivalent is update-rc.d  see Chkconfig alternative for Ubuntu Server?)\n\nA: I had the same problem, and I am running Ubuntu 14 on a local Vagrant setup. I removed the /etc/apache2/sites-enabled directory and added a link to my home directory, which of course is mounted to my local drive according to the Vagrant configs.\nTurns out apache was not seeing the directory because the resource was not mounted yet. I rewrote my provision on Vagrant to just copy sites-enabled directory instead of adding a symlink.\nI also did sudo update-rc.d apache2 enable as suggested by Karl Wilbur to be sure apache init was enabled.\n", "Q: Natty crashes randomly and jumps to login Sometimes when I work on Natty 32bit the screen goes black and jumps to the login-screen.\ni don't know how to reproduce this bug, but it seems it occurs when starting Applications.\nAnyone has a solution to this?\nThanks!\n\nA: Since installing xserver-xorg-video-intel package from the natty-proposed repository, i have never again experienced this bug.\nGood Luck!\n\nA: This happens to me as well in 11.04.

I have read that you can only install on the default partition.  This is because installing on other partitions can cause viruses or unwanted things on your computer.  What I have done to get around this is to install the package on the default partition then add a script to the beggining of it that will move the files where you want the first time the program is started.\n\nA: Depending on the software, you may be able to find it as a portable application, which you could install wherever you want.\n\nA: It's not clear why you want this. If it's for space reasons, one viable approach would be to mount large directories (probably /bin or /usr, where many programs reside) in an extra partition. See e.g. this question: How can I store /var on a separate partition? for how to do that.\n\nA: Another option beside the defunct link for another answer's \"portable application\" which seems to now correlate to the link below, which is a collection of single file AppImages, is to use the other portable package apps like Flatpak or Snap.

Unless you can find somewhere a comprehensive list of the correct permissions, you probably won't get it right; furthermore, some things will fail, perhaps in surprising ways.\nSo, you're best off reinstalling in this situation.

This is an \"indicator only\" version (no window) of the example provided at Ubuntu Wiki:\n#include <libappindicator/app-indicator.h>\n\nstatic void activate_action (GtkAction *action);\n\nstatic GtkActionEntry entries[] = {\n    {\"New\",  \"document-new\",     \"_New\",  \"<control>N\",\n        \"Create a new file\",    G_CALLBACK(activate_action)},\n    {\"Open\", \"document-open\",    \"_Open\", \"<control>O\",\n        \"Open a file\",          G_CALLBACK(activate_action)},\n    {\"Save\", \"document-save\",    \"_Save\", \"<control>S\",\n        \"Save file\",            G_CALLBACK(activate_action)},\n    {\"Quit\", \"application-exit\", \"_Quit\", \"<control>Q\",\n        \"Exit the application\", G_CALLBACK(gtk_main_quit)},\n};\nstatic guint n_entries = G_N_ELEMENTS(entries);\n\nstatic const gchar *ui_info =\n\"<ui>\"\n\"  <popup name='IndicatorPopup'>\"\n\"    <menuitem action='New' />\"\n\"    <menuitem action='Open' />\"\n\"    <menuitem action='Save' />\"\n\"    <menuitem action='Quit' />\"\n\"  </popup>\"\n\"</ui>\";\n\nstatic void activate_action(GtkAction *action)\n{\n    const gchar *name = gtk_action_get_name (action);\n    GtkWidget *dialog;\n\n    dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new(NULL,\n                                    GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT,\n                                    GTK_MESSAGE_INFO,\n                                    GTK_BUTTONS_CLOSE,\n                                    \"You activated action: \\\"%s\\\"\",\n                                    name);\n\n    g_signal_connect(dialog, \"response\", \n                     G_CALLBACK(gtk_widget_destroy), NULL);\n\n    gtk_widget_show(dialog);\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char **argv)\n{\n    GtkWidget*      indicator_menu;\n    GtkActionGroup* action_group;\n    GtkUIManager*   uim;\n    AppIndicator* indicator;\n    GError* error = NULL;\n\n    gtk_init(&argc, &argv);\n\n    /* Menus */\n    action_group = gtk_action_group_new(\"AppActions\");\n    gtk_action_group_add_actions(action_group, entries, n_entries,\n                                 NULL);\n\n    uim = gtk_ui_manager_new();\n    gtk_ui_manager_insert_action_group(uim, action_group, 0);\n\n    if (!gtk_ui_manager_add_ui_from_string(uim, ui_info, -1, &error)) {\n        g_message(\"Failed to build menus: %s\\n\", error->message);\n        g_error_free(error);\n        error = NULL;\n    }\n\n    /* Indicator */\n    indicator = app_indicator_new(\"example-simple-client\",\n                                  \"go-jump\",\n                                  APP_INDICATOR_CATEGORY_APPLICATION_STATUS);\n\n    indicator_menu = gtk_ui_manager_get_widget(uim, \"/ui/IndicatorPopup\");\n\n    app_indicator_set_status(indicator, APP_INDICATOR_STATUS_ACTIVE);\n    app_indicator_set_attention_icon(indicator, \"indicator-messages-new\");\n\n    app_indicator_set_menu(indicator, GTK_MENU(indicator_menu));\n\n    gtk_main();\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nA: Application Indicator documentation with examples and API docs are available here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopExperienceTeam/ApplicationIndicators, it's API reference is HTML in the libappindicator-doc package.

I realised today when signing in, that everytime i use my computer I send some data back and forth to the Ubuntu One service, for obvious reasons, and that would actually mean Canonical could save us users data, like when we use our computers and how, and (if the Ubuntu One-folder on the server ain't encrypted in a good manner) what content we want to save in the cloud, and since Ubuntu One is not open source, we, the community, can't check if Canonical logs more than we are comfortable with.\nDon't get me wrong, I'm no conspiracy nut, just courious :). \n\nA: We don't generally track user behaviour.\nWe do have some statistical metrics to understand how people use our software, like how many shares do people create a day, how many public files, how much space do people use on average, etc. This is to help us understand how people use our product and how to improve it.\nWe don't track individual users at all, we don't track what they do with their computers or even what they do with their files.\nDevelopers also don't have access to production, only a small number of sysadmins deal with production servers and databases.\nKeeping people's information safe is key for Ubuntu One to succeed.\n\nA: UbuntuOne's client is licensed under GPLv3. That means the client (ubuntuone-client) shouldn't be sending any usage information to Canonical. However, the server side code is closed, so there could be some statistical tracking.\nThe website is using Google Analytics both when you're logged in and when logged out. \nThe privacy policy states that your personal information won't be shared \"except to provide you with services, comply with the law, or protect our rights\" and isn't even stored \"unless required for the on-going operation of our services\".\n\nA: From the Ubuntu One privacy policy:\n\nLike most website operators, Canonical collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor's request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Ubuntu One's visitors use the website.\nWhen you register for Ubuntu One, we ask for information such as your email address, billing address, and credit card information.

I have posted this same question in ubuntuforums, but still no solutions have helped me.\n\nA: This is more a workaround than a solution, since a solution isn't possible until we know what the problem is (hence the troubleshooting questions I've asked above).\nClearly, some of your settings are corrupted. Try doing this from a console (Ctrl+Alt+F1):\nmkdir configuration_backup\n\n# Get rid of any possible dotfiles that might cause trouble. You\n# might not have all of these, and you might need to modify this\n# list a bit. The files/directories will go to the newly-created\n# configuration_backup directory so you can restore them if\n# appropriate.\nmv .config .dbus .gconf* .gnome* .gtk* .local .metacity configuration_backup\n\nAfter this, you should be able to log in graphically. However, these steps will destroy many of your settings (unless you restore everything from configuration_backup. You'll have to redo them. If you can provide more details about your situation, there might be a solution that won't destroy your settings. Or, it might be easier to just accept this workaround and simply redo your settings.\nIf you later decide you want to restore your settings, look in the backup directory (~/configuration_backup) and find the name of the file or directory you want to restore. If you can't see what you want, use ls -A (command line) or Ctrl+H (Nautilus) to see the hidden files. I recommend that you first backup and delete the file/folder of the same name in your home directory. Then, copy one file/folder at a time to your home directory (e.g., cp -a ~/configuration_backup/.config ~), logging out and back in each time to make sure your old config files don't break your system.\n", "Q: err: file '/lib/libgcc_s.so.1' not found I'm running 32bit ubuntu in a virtual machine inside vmplayer.

Yesterday, I had a hot discussion with one of my friend (Windows user). He said Wine is just an emulator. I said no Wine is read as \"Wine is not an emulator\". Then he gave me many links including WineHQ's wiki page. \"Wine's not that kind of emulator\" is written there.\nSo I want to ask if Wine is an emulator why does it calls itself \"Wine is not an emulator\"?\n\nA: From the same link as the one you pointed at \"Wine does not do any CPU emulation\"\nThat is what emulators usually do (wii , psx, n64, etc)\nFor a more complete answer you can read the first paragraph of the link you provided - i don't think that anyone can explain it in a better way.\n\nA: A program in Windows makes extensive use of standard libraries that belong to Microsoft Windows. These libraries are rewritten and implemented in Wine so that they do much the same. The more a program is well written and the standard libraries, the greater the chance that the program will work in Wine.\nThe code of a program is first examined for calling the Windows libraries. These calls are translated so that the Wine's libraries called. Then the code of the program executed at full speed. There is no emulated code, but only the calls to the libraries are translated.\nTherefore, in theory. a program should work about as fast as Microsoft Windows. In practice, the program may be slower, because the translation is made​​. But there is a possibility of a program working faster because the libraries of Wine are simpler, and because disk access is often faster in Linux.\nBecause Linux uses OpenGL, Windows programs that use OpenGL often work well in Wine. Linux does not use DirectX - however, DirectX games work in Wine because the DirectX calls can be translated by Wine to OpenGL calls.\n", "Q: Find and bash problems in recent Ubuntu versions I've been having a problem the last six months or so when combining searches in bash. The exact example is related to Python programming but would apply to any kind of detection/manipulation.\nSuppose I want a list of all Python files in the directory where I am. This is easy:\nfind . -name '*.py'\n\nNow, suppose I'm only interested in those Python files which contain the string \"psycopg\", e.g. because I want to transition from the old PostgreSQL access library psycopg to psycopg2. Still easy enough:\ngrep -l  psycopg `find . -name '*.py'`\n\nNow, suppose I want to do a full list of these files to inspect their date stamps to see when I last touched them. I could also wish to open them in gedit, but let's stick to the list:\nls -l `!!`\n\nwhich expands to\nls -l `grep -l  psycopg `find . -name '*.py'``\n\nNow, what happens? Answer: Nothing. The bash prompt just hangs. Why is that? This may be a wrong way of doing things, but it used to work. I'm pretty sure it worked pre- Ubuntu 10.10 or 10.04.\n\nA: The problem is the nested command substitution with backticks. bash first tries to execute grep -l  psycopg (which is between the first two backticks). But there's no filename - therefore it expects input on stdin (you can try this by entering psycopg).\nYou can avoid this problem by using the $(command) syntax for command substitutions:\ngrep -l  psycopg $(find . -name '*.py')\nls -l $(!!)\n\nIn this case it can be nested.\n\nA: Backticks do not nest. The first embedded command is grep -l psycopg which is going to listen on stdin for data because there are no filenames.\nI'd say get used to using $(this syntax) instead of backticks because they do nest properly.\nls -l $(grep -l psycopg $(find . -name \\*py))\n\n\nA: Do it in general the other way round, find the files, grep in them, and use finds ls:\nfind . -name '*.py' -exec grep -q psycopg {} \";\" -ls\n\nspecial forms of output are possible (printf) and listed in the manpage of find.\n\nA: It is always wrong to have commands that output more than one filename inside $() or `` (command substitution).

I am using rubymine, but this applies to any editor. There are key bindings in the editor which make perfect sense and are useful. HOWEVER compiz in it's infinite wisdom decides that IT wants to take the key bindings if it sees them. Example is Alt + Ctrl + Left/Right as prev/next location. Compiz instead wants to switch workspaces.\nHow do I tell compiz to not execute commands on keybindings if another program handles them? Sort of a \"low priority\"\n\nA: Compiz doesn't know which keybindings are handled by other programs so you can't set Compiz to some kind of low priority.\nI've changed all Compiz keybindings to use the Super key as this key usually isn't used by normal programs.\n", "Q: How can I stop the panel from showing on an external projector/monitor?

I've just received my new SSD since the old one died. This Intel 320 SSD supports TRIM. For testing purposes, my dealer put Windows on it, but I want to get rid of this and install Kubuntu on it.\nIt does not have to be a \"secure wipe\", I just need the empty the disk in the most healthy way. I believe that dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda just fills the blocks with zeroes and thereby taking another write (correct me if I'm wrong).\nI've seen the answer How to enable TRIM, but it looks like it's suited for clearing empty blocks, not wiping the disk.\nhdparm seems to be the program to do it, but I'm not sure if it clears the disk OR cleans empty blocks. From its manual page:\n\n  --trim-sector-ranges\n          For  Solid State Drives (SSDs).  EXCEPTIONALLY DANGEROUS. DO NOT\n          USE THIS OPTION!!  Tells the drive firmware to discard  unneeded\n          data  sectors,  destroying  any  data that may have been present\n          within them.  This makes those sectors available  for  immediate\n          use  by  the firmware's garbage collection mechanism, to improve\n          scheduling for wear-leveling of the flash  media.   This  option\n          expects  one  or  more  sector range pairs immediately after the\n          option: an LBA starting address, a colon, and  a  sector  count,\n          with no intervening spaces.  EXCEPTIONALLY DANGEROUS. DO NOT USE\n          THIS OPTION!!\n\n\n          E.g.  hdparm --trim-sector-ranges 1000:4 7894:16 /dev/sdz\n\nHow can I make all blocks appear as empty using TRIM?\n\nA: If you don't need a secure wipe, why don't you just install kubuntu using the options to 'use entire disk' and the equivalent of 'quick format' (can't remember the exact terminology right now)\nThat way you ditch the file allocation table and the drive is effectively emptied for overwriting. You don't actually need to empty it.\n\nA: ATA Secure Erase\nYou should use the drive's security erase feature.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the drive Security is not frozen. If it is, it may help to suspend and resume the computer.\n$ sudo hdparm -I /dev/sdX | grep frozen\n       not     frozen \n\nThe (filtered) command output means that this drive is ”not frozen” and you can continue.\n\n*Set a User Password (this password is cleared too, the exact choice does not matter).\nsudo hdparm --user-master u --security-set-pass Eins /dev/sdX\n\n\n*Issue the ATA Secure Erase command\nsudo hdparm --user-master u --security-erase Eins /dev/sdX\n\nNote:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sdX is the SSD as a block device that you want to erase.\n\n*Eins is the password chosen in this example.\n\n\nSee the ATA Secure Erase article in the Linux kernel wiki for complete instructions including troubleshooting.\n\nA: util-linux 2.23 offers blkdiscard which discards data without secure-wiping them. I tested: works over SATA and mmcblk but not USB.\nAn excerpt from the manual page of blkdiscard(8):\n\nNAME\nblkdiscard - discard sectors on a device\nSYNOPSIS\nblkdiscard [-o offset] [-l length] [-s] [-v] device\n\nDESCRIPTION\nblkdiscard is used to discard device sectors.  This is useful for\n  solid-state drivers (SSDs) and thinly-provisioned storage.  Unlike\n  fstrim(8) this command is used directly on the block device.\nBy default, blkdiscard will discard all blocks on the device.  Options may be used to modify this behavior based on range or size, as explained below.\nThe device argument is the pathname of the block device.\nWARNING: All data in the discarded region on the device will be lost!\n\nThe command is there since Ubuntu 15.04 and OpenSUSE 13.1 (yes OpenSUSE has it 2 years ahead of Ubuntu).\n\nA: If the drive has a Linux filestem on it, you can use fstrim.\nBy default recent Ubuntu runs fstrim on drives from the following vendors: \n    if [ -z \"$NO_MODEL_CHECK\" ]; then\n        if ! contains \"$HDPARM\" \"Intel\" && \\\n           ! contains \"$HDPARM\" \"INTEL\" && \\\n           ! contains \"$HDPARM\" \"Samsung\" && \\\n           ! contains \"$HDPARM\" \"SAMSUNG\" && \\\n           ! contains \"$HDPARM\" \"OCZ\" && \\\n           ! contains \"$HDPARM\" \"SanDisk\" && \\\n           ! contains \"$HDPARM\" \"Patriot\"; then\n            #echo \"device $DEV is not a drive that is known-safe for trimming\"\n            continue\n\nOnce a week. \nSo one answer to your question is boot up the system and wait a week!\n\nA: Check to see if the BIOS on the computer supports this.  On a laptop I just checked, there's an option to do a secure erase of all attached media on the next boot.  This is probably a widely used option in corporate environments, so many vendors probably include it now.  (I was checking on a Dell Precision 5510 laptop from 2017.)\nThough if you just want to wipe the drive to install Linux (as per the question), you don't need to do a full wipe.  The only concern is that the drive should know that the space used previously by Windows is now free, to optimize SSD use.\nThere are many options for this, including those mentioned already.  I note that mke2fs has the -E discard option that should trim the partition when creating the file system, which is enabled by default.  (Note that this is the best effort option, so it will silently ignore it if the hardware doesn't support it.)  So in most cases you can simply ignore the problem, install Linux, and the installation process will do all the cleanup you need.\n\nA: Just remove the partition, you do not have to clear the whole disk, old data will be overwritten when the storage is needed for something else.\nTo enable TRIM:\ngksudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nChange \"ext4    errors=remount-ro 0\" into \"ext4    discard,errors=remount-ro 0\". (Add discard)\nSave and reboot, TRIM should now be enabled.\nCheck if TRIM is enabled:\nsudo -i\ndd if=/dev/urandom of=tempfile count=100 bs=512k oflag=direct\nhdparm --fibmap tempfile\n\nUse the first begin_LBA address.\nhdparm --read-sector [begin_LBA] /dev/sda\n\nNow it should return numbers and characters. Remove the file and sync.\nrm tempfile\nsync\n\nNow, run the following command again. If it returns zeros TRIM is enabled.\nhdparm --read-sector [begin_LBA] /dev/sda\n\n", "Q: When and where I can find the UDS-O group photos?

I'm not willing to redesign GUI because of Unity, hope there's a better way. Thanx in advance for any hint.\n\nA: PyGTK was very recently discussed at the recent Ubuntu Apps Developer Week.\nIn summary, PyGTK has been effectively obsoleted in favour of pyGI.  This is because of Unity, Gnome3 and the upcoming GTK3.\nTherefore, it seems, if you want your application supported on newer platforms (not just Ubuntu), then you'll need to slightly rework your code, compiling against pyGI libraries not pyGTK.\n\nA: Ok, i have possible workaround. It's obvious that global menu goes after gtk.MenuBar, so i've removed my menu from gtk.MenuBar and built my own simple menubar based on gtk.EventBox, gtk.Label and gtk.Menu.popup. Now i have my menu in my app window and everything works as expected.

At ubuntu.com there is this \"only in ubuntu\" that says \"Built in virus protection\":\nWhat is the Ubuntu built it protection? What is the program in charge of this and how does it work?\n\nA: I have had discussions with some people who claim that the Linux population makes it a less favorable target for viruses.\nThere are a number of things about Linux and other Unix based platforms that make them not pleasant environments for viruses.\n\n\n*\n\n*Access to logs and log scanners make it simple to watch for thing indicating a problem.  \n\n*Limited privileges for most users make it difficult to get a strong toehold on a system.  Well managed systems make it extremely difficult to gain root access.\n\n*Ease of restricting access to services like cron which can be used to relaunch services.\n\n*A lot of tools have been scanned for race conditions which make it possible to change configuration files.  (I was discouraged to see Linux security bug counts being considered equal to Windows when many of the bugs were of the type \"race condition may allow high scores to be changed\".)\n\n*Ease in providing read-only access to resources used by services.  (Failure to do so is one vector enabling code injection into sites. \n\n*Ease of running and comparing checksums on files.\n\n*Heavy use of human readable configuration files.\n\n*Use of executable bit to enable file execution.\n\n*Ability to flag partitions to prevent automatic execution on the partion.  Additional mount options exist to increase security.\n\n\nIn whole and in part these factors, make introducing viruses more difficult, easier to detect, and easier to disable.\n\nA: \"Built-in virus protection\" is a simplification of the security features of Ubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu requires applications to be run as super-user to cause any damage. It also includes AppArmor to supplement that.\n\n*There is also the safe and secure repository model which gives you access to thousands of applications through the Software Center which are tested by package maintainers.\n\n*Since it is free software more people have access to the source code and according to Linus's law: \"Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow\", which means that \n\nGiven a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix will be obvious to someone.\n\n\n*The security exploits are quickly patched up and delivered to you through the Update Manager. \n\nA: I think what they mean by that is a) necessary privilege elevation (i.e. sudo) is necessary for doing potentially dangerous things and maybe b) (tongue-in-cheek) Linux is too obscure (and secure, see a) to draw much fire from virus writers..\n\nA: The simplest answer is that it's very rare to find any virus designed to target an Ubuntu system.\n\nA: My 2 cents are that it is possible to get a virus for Ubuntu, but:\n\n\n*\n\n*The way most Linux distributions are built make it very hard for virus/trojans/backdoors to take advantage of vulnerabilities in binary packages. Ubuntu changes every six months (and updates --sometimes annoying-- land at least every week). It makes it very difficult for a virus author to track all these changes. In contrast, windows takes several years to change. That gives some time to the virus author to try to be as destructive/invasive as it can.\n\n*AFAIK, there is a substantial difficulty to \"leak\" binary code or suspicious source code to Ubuntu's Official or Debian's official packaging systems.\n\n*There might be 3 ways to infect a Linux box:\n\n\n*\n\n*You 've been running Linux for years without updating any of your internet-facing services/apps.\n\n*You installed a virus/trojan by yourself.\n\n*You downloaded the virus in source code, compiled it and ran it with administrator privileges ;)\n\n\n\nA: \"Built-in virus protection\" is probably just marketing speech for the fact that Linux uses a different binary format for executables than Windows, so a Windows-virus cannot run on Linux. (It might run under Wine, but who would try that?)\n\nA: Excerpt from Psychocats Tutorial Website:\nhttp://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/security#firewallantivirus\n\nConventional wisdom in the Linux\n  community says that there are either\n  no or very few Linux viruses out in\n  \"the wild,\" and that most are just\n  proof-of-concept theoretical viruses.\n  Some people recommend installing a\n  virus scanner like ClamAV in order to\n  protect your Windows-using friends\n  from Windows viruses you might\n  accidentally send them. I don't really\n  see how that's an issue, though. If\n  you have an attachment you created in\n  Linux, why would it have a Windows\n  virus in it?

A standard feature of most of the document editors like TexMaker or Kile is auto-saving as you type.  Of course this is generally considered a good thing, but if I'm editing a document that's already synced with Ubuntu One, Ubuntu One syncs the file every time the editor auto-saves.  In addition to eating resources, this also usually results in u1conflict files, and at some point I have to log into Ubuntu One via a web browser to remove the file (there are problems building the pdf from the tex source otherwise).\nI know I can temporarily disable Ubuntu One, or temporarily move the document being edited to a folder that's not synced, but it's a bit of a pain to have to take these extra steps every time I want to work on a paper.

From my experience and what I've found googling, the regressions were introduced with 11.04 and not significantly improved with 11.10.\nI haven't successfully found a solution for 11.10 but I have found documentation indicating that someone at canonical is aware of the existing regressions and have plans to improve behavior for 12.04 (which also implies there is no solution for 11.10):\n\n\n*\n\n*http://design.canonical.com/2011/12/improving-the-multi-monitor-experience-in-ubuntu/\n\n*http://design.canonical.com/the-toolkit/unity-multi-monitor-interactions/\n\n*https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aHvJ-iIw-59bXTYBmIhQqEx0za2h9jpFE_RhZ2VOvJc/edit?authkey=CJO5wPkH&hl=en_GB&pli=1\nIn particular, see section 2.5 of the google doc (sorry there are no page numbers) which has a nice graphic of what should happen on disconnecting and reconnecting an external display and also section 3.11 which details a use case which perfectly matches mine (and sounds pretty close to yours, although you didn't explicitly mention a laptop).\nOf course, a spec doesn't mean it will actually happen but it is promising that the spec has a working solution for every situation that I have encountered mostly targeted for 12.04 (with some more complete aspects targeted for 12.10).\n\nA: Those are probably regressions introduced in the latest Compiz.\nFor the Expo plugin, \"One big wall\" option is globally ignored, it's a known bug.\nI am not aware of any bug related to your problem with window placement, however, you can report it as this is clearly an odd behaviour. Also try switching to Classic Desktop (at login screen) to see, whether this is Unity or Compiz related problem.\nYou can try different settings in CompizConfig>Window management>Window Placement>Multi Output Mode.\nIf you don't need Unity, you can downgrade to an older version of Compiz which was present in Ubuntu 10.10.\n", "Q: create OS back up hello\nI have ubuntu 9 that I take with my Dell laptop! this CD contain a program that I can create a copy of all ubuntu files & programs into a CD and Run it from CD(live) or Intslall it(with all programs)\nnew I installed ubuntu 10 that I downloaded from ubuntu website, I installed dozens of programs from apache to games,from browser to code editor), Now I want to create back up of my ubuntu that I able to run it from CD or installed it (and installed ubuntu include my prgrams)\n\nNow I want to now Is there any program for my purpose?\nNote: I could not find any dell related program,If there is any,it will be better to use it:)\n\nA: Remastersys is the solution.

After updating to Ubuntu 11.04 my computer started to turn off and reboot.

The alternative is to acquire a new memory module.\n\n*CPU temperature, if it gets over the fail-safe limit, then the motherboard sends the kill signal to shutdown the computer immediately. This is done to prevent hardware meltdown.\nA side effect for a defected cooling system is the overheating of you CPU, what in turn leads to other hardware problems. (very unlikely, but under certain circumstances, may justify your memory issues).\nHere, the solution is as simple as to clean up your fans and place some new thermal paste on your CPU.\n", "Q: \"CRON: Module is unknown\" after upgrading to 10.04 I just upgraded our server to Ubuntu 10.04 and cron just stopped working.

I am still figuring it out but it will definitely do what you described. I don't think auto-switching is a realistic option yet, but Disper with a keyboard shortcut is worth trying out.\n\nA: If you're using xorg.conf for your setup, this inelegant, but simple solution has worked for me:\nCreate a separate configuration file for each setup, which you will put in /etc/X11.  Name them something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*xxorg.conf.work\n\n*xxorg.conf.home\n\n*xxorg.conf.single\n\n\n(The double exes will prevent the server from spontaneously deleting the files)\nThen create three simple shell scripts and put them in /usr/local/bin.  Name them something like:\n\n\n*\n\n*display.work\n\n*display.home\n\n*display.single\n\n\nAn example of the contents of one of the files looks like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"#!/bin/sh\"\n\n*cp -f /etc/X11/xxorg.conf.work /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\n*echo \"Display is set for WORK\"\n\n*echo \"You must restart the display manager for settings to take effect.\"\n\n\nTo use these scripts, assuming you've booted up and are looking at the wrong display--\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl-Alt-F2 to bring up a non-graphical shell.\n\n*log in\n\n*as root, (su or sudo, depending on your system) run the desired script.\n\n*restart your X server\n\n\nYes, it's not as nice as plug and play would be, but it's pretty quick and painless nonetheless.\n\nA: As @JE2Tom suggested, Disper was able to do the job.\nFor those interesed, this is what I did.\n\n\n*\n\n*I installed Disper for Ubuntu\n\n*I then used CompizConfig - General - Commands to create shortcut keys for the two commands that i wanted:\n\n\n*\n\n*disper -s activates just the primary monitor\n\n*disper -S activates just the secondary monitor\n\n\n", "Q: How can I do a full image backup of my system? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to make a disk image and restore from it later? \n\nI'm looking for a solution to create an exact copy of my system that I can restore in case of hard disk failure by simply putting a new hard drive and restoring from the backup. Something like Acronis TrueImage.\nI'm not interested in file based backups, although it'd be a plus.\n\nA: Get yourself a copy of Parted Magic. It is fantastic.\n\nA: A bit of overkill, but you can use the 'dd' command for this. 'dd' stands for Disk Dump, and will dump an exact duplicate, bit by bit, of a hard drive into a file. I've only used this to create CD and DVD iso files myself, so I don't know if there's anything specific when using a hard drive... But it's worth looking into.\nFor creating an ISO for a CD, the command is:\ndd if=/dev/cdrom of=/path/to/file.iso\nYou can read more about dd in it's man page (man dd), and probably there's a tutorial somewhere for exactly what you want online. Here's one I found with a quick google search: http://www.linuxweblog.com/dd-image\nEdit: I don't know if this is relevant or not, but CDs are generally read-only, whereas your hard drive probably is not... And probably is having data written to it even when you don't realize it. So, it's probably a good idea to run these commands from the LiveCD, and not from the hard drive you're trying to back up.\n\nA: The most primitive way I've used in the past: cp\nsudo cp /dev/sda /media/backup/my-backup-file\nRestore can be done:\nsudo cp /media/backup/my-backup-file /dev/sda\nNot sure if this works with any hard drive but had no problems so far.\nYou may as well add compression easily:\nsudo sh -c \"cat /dev/sda |gzip -c > /media/backup/my-backup-file.gz\"\nsudo sh -c \"gzip -dc /media/backup/my-backup-file.gz > /dev/sda\"\n", "Q: Shortcut key to simple textbox to perform Google search Question\n\n\n*\n\n*What would be a good tool to enable me to press a shortcut key that brings up a simple textbox where I can type some search terms and then press enter to perform a Google search?\n\n\nAdditional points\n\n\n*\n\n*I know that I can press a shortcut key to start a browser and have Google as my default search engine.

(@Jorge: Thank you for the formatting assist.)\nUPDATE: In searching for Compiz alternatives, I figured that I could set up Metacity to handle the window management. In so doing, I realized that Metacity had already become the default window manager, which explains why none of my Compiz settings are having any effect. The real problem, then, is that I can't run Compiz. Using \"Compiz --replace\" freezes the screen. Now that I have the equivalent of the grid functionality, I might stop while I'm ahead.

Unfortunately support for 9.10 has also ended by the end of April 2011.\nTherefore it would be best practise to reinstall your Ubuntu with 10.04 LTS server.

As a Guest OS I have another Ubuntu in the VirtualBox. \nI am starting Guest Ubuntu automatically using following command once my Host Ubuntu boots:\nVBoxHeadless -startvm Ubuntu --vrdp on\n\nThen I can access to it with ssh or tsclient. \nNow I need to shutdown automatically Guest Ubuntu once I shutdown my Host Ubuntu. Does anybody know any safe method to automatically shutdown Guest Ubuntu with a command line? I have found out two ways one can shutdown Guest OS but I am not sure whether they are safe or not. Here are they:\nVBoxManage controlvm Ubuntu acpipowerbutton\n\nor \nVBoxManage controlvm Ubuntu poweroff\n\n\nA: If you open up Gnome Power management preferences, you can set what actions to take when the power button. If you set it to shut down, it will shut down gracefully when you press the virtual power button with the VBoxManage controlvm Ubuntu acpipowerbutton\n command.\n\nA: You should poweroff your virtual Ubuntu just like you do poweroff your real hardware. From a commanline on a ssh session remotely issue:\nsudo poweroff\n\nIf you want to save the machine state (similar to suspend/hibernate) use the second point in @htorque's answer.\n\nA: Don't do this:\nVBoxManage controlvm Ubuntu poweroff\n\nIt is equivalent to pulling the power plug on a real computer. You don't want to do this!\nUse the ACPI shutdown method (check the power management setting like Egil suggests) or maybe give the save state method (savestate) a try.\n\nA: If you are shutting down the vm when the server does, yo have to wait for the vm(s)\n(In this shellscript 'root' is the invoker, and 'theuser' is the owner of 'thevm')\nI know the vms have finished when the output of the command VBoxManage list runningvms returns an empty string.\nI use this in my shell script\n...\nstop(){\n    su -c \"VBoxManage controlvm thevm acpipowerbutton\" -s /bin/bash theuser\n    while [ \"`su -c 'VBoxManage list runningvms' -s /bin/bash theuser`\" != \"\" ]\n    do\n        echo waiting for VMs to shutdown\n        sleep 3\n    done\n}\n...\n\n\nA: One problem with shutting down a vm with the savestate option is if you have to move that vm to another computer.  You may run into a problem if the new computer uses a different processor and perhaps other differences in hardware.  When a vm restarts from a saved state, it needs its environment back, which won't happen if the processor is different.  A vm that has been properly shut-down, looks at the current hardware when it is restarted and normally will bring in some or all of the new drivers it needs.\n\nA: I usually shutdown the VM (Linux) by\n\n$ sudo shutdown -h now\n\nI guess it is the most gracefull way of terminating the VM because it is shutdown (not poweroff) and provides grace time and (possiblly) the message to the login users.\n", "Q: How to list Compiz keybindings in use? Other than looking though each active plugin and  manually searching for keybindings / keyboard-shortcuts  in use by compiz, is there a 'simple' way to gather this information?\ni.e. Some panel that displays all currently active keybindings in use (by compiz), or some terminal command to do same.\nKeyboard-shortcuts does not appear to list certain specific compiz shortcuts.\nThanks\n\nA: Here's a (very long) one-liner that returns all shortcuts from all active plugins:\nfor i in $(gconftool-2 --get /apps/compiz-1/general/screen0/options/active_plugins|sed \"s/\\[\\|\\]//g\"|sed \"s/,/ /g\"); do echo \"# $i:\"; gconftool-2 -a /apps/compiz-1/plugins/\"$i\"/screen0/options | grep \"_key\\|_button\\|trigger_\\|initiate\\ \\|panel_first_menu\\|keyboard_focus\\|execute_command\\|show_launcher\" | grep -v \"Disabled\\|=[[:space:]]*$\" | sort; done; echo -e \"\\n# metacity overrides:\"; gconftool-2 -a /apps/metacity/global_keybindings | grep -v \"disabled\\|cycle\\|switch_panels\" | sort; gconftool-2 -a /apps/metacity/window_keybindings | grep -v \"disabled\" | sort\n\nUpdate: Above version now gets all non-empty/disabled keybindings (key, mouse, key+mouse) from all active plugins.\nHowever, the value of the key X-GNOME-WMSettingsModule in /usr/share/applications/compiz.desktop makes Metacity override several Compiz keys. You will notice the italic labels in ccsm - that's when the value comes from Metacity and not Compiz.\nAs I found no easy way to fix this, I simply added all Metacity shortcuts to the end of the output.\n\nA: You don't need to chain 2 sed scripts, they could be one, separated by ';'.  But even simpler would be piping to tr.  For 12.04 without metacity this should be:\nfor i in $(gconftool-2 --get /apps/compiz-1/general/screen0/options/active_plugins|tr '[],' ' '); do echo \"# $i:\"; gconftool-2 -a /apps/compiz-1/plugins/\"$i\"/screen0/options | grep \"_key\\|_button\\|trigger_\\|initiate\\ \\|panel_first_menu\\|keyboard_focus\\|execute_command\\|show_launcher\" | grep -v \"Disabled\\|=[[:space:]]*$\" | sort; done\n\nHowever, as Jay_11 already noted, the whole construct seems to show part of what goes into compiz, not the result.  E.g. I get close_window_key = <Alt>F4, but I turned that off.  As an avid Emacs user I don't let a window manager get near anything except <Super>, but this doesn't show!\nSo the question remains: What is compiz really doing?\n\nA: i got a nice webpage for this ;)\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20110430205154/http://ranjith.zfs.in/ubuntu-10-04-compiz-fusion-keyboard-shortcuts/\n", "Q: How can I change the nvidia GPU fan speed? So im trying ubuntu again after being off it for awhile in win7 i can set gpu fan to 10-30% and its barly reaching 52c , however with ubuntu nvidia set it to 55% wich is really loud on my msi 460gtx.\nThis is the only thing that keeps me from using ubuntu is there really no program or way to set manually like msi afterburner / evga precision , temperature curve & fan speed?.\nDefault fan is way to loud and its barly 3 c diffrence from 25% gpu fan speed to 55% but the noise is alot more.\n\nA: Be careful about the highest voted answer. I have two 2080ti GPUs and running that command made my computer unable to boot.\nFinally, I found an answer from here. Following that:\n\n*\n\n*Create a file named /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/11-nvidia-coolbits.conf and write the following in it:\nSection \"OutputClass\"\n    Identifier \"nvidia\"\n    MatchDriver \"nvidia-drm\"\n    Driver \"nvidia\"\n    Option \"Coolbits\" \"4\"\nEndSection\n\n\n\n*Log out and log back in.\n\n\n*Run nvidia-settings. In the windows that opens you can now find the fan speed control options. Only the fan speed of one GPU can be controlled though.\n\nA: To control Nvidia GPU fan speed via Terminal on Linux Mint 20 with a 1070 Ti:\nsudo nvidia-xconfig --cool-bits=4\n\nto tell nvidia-xconfig to allow the fan to be controlled in the command line. You may need to reboot here.\nnvidia-smi\n\nGives information about the GPU(s) and their numbers. Importantly I note that my 1070 Ti is GPU 0.\nnvidia-settings -a \"[gpu:0]/GPUFanControlState=1\" -a \"[fan:0]/GPUTargetFanSpeed=55\"\n\nFor a much more detailed overview of this feature including multiple GPU fans, check out this thorough documentation Nvidia Overclocking and Cooling\nFor a somewhat rambling and wayward thread which lead me to the above link, check out Set Fanspeed in Linux from Terminal\n==================END OF ANSWER==================\nAnd as an extra tidbit not asked for in this question, you can also adjust the power output of your Nvidia GPU with:\nsudo nvidia-smi -i 0 -pl 90\n\nWhere the 0 is my GPU number, and the 90 is the maximum power in watts. If you set this too low, you will get an error. In my limited experience, setting it too high had no effect.\nI found I can get 95%+ performance for ~75% energy cost by setting the power level to 100 in the above command in my mining rig, but I imagine other power conscious users would appreciate this too.\n\nA: In the terminal run:\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\nsudo nvidia-xconfig --cool-bits=4\n\nrestart your computer and search for NVIDIA X Server Settings in the Dash. There should be an option to change fan speed under Thermal Settings.\n\nA: Try sudo apt-get install nvclock\n\nA: *\n\n*Install nvclock as someone above pointed out\n\n*Open terminal\n\n*nvclock -f -F 80 (in this case, fan would run @ 80%)\n\n\nA: None of the above answers worked for me using the nvidia-settings GUI.

(Note: I have SDDM (Simple Desktop Display Manager) rather than GDM (Gnome Desktop Manager) installed).\nGet the Xauthority for the current Xserver.\n(Note: you may need to plug in the monitor first and turn it on, otherwise, there's a super interesting workaround option to run a new X server (e.g., X :0 && export DISPLAY=:0 avialable on the nvidia forums).\nI didn't need that since I can just plug a monitor (powered off) into the HDMI outlet. Here's the simpler version:\nps -ax | grep Xorg\n\nFind the path to the Authorization File string that looks like\n-auth /var/run/sddm/{31a6ce92-51d1-4cef-b30e-61d63b0221bb} and copy the path (i.e., /var/run/sddm/{Authorization File}). (Don't use the dummy example here, it won't work - you need to find your Auth File path with the command above).\nAdjust your Nvidia GPU fanspeed\nNow we're ready to put the full command together - to set GPU 0 with a speed of 95% it'll look like this (remember to replace the Auth File with the path you copied above):\nsudo DISPLAY=:0 XAUTHORITY=/var/run/sddm/{31a6ce92-22d1-4cef-b29e-91d63b0221bb} nvidia-settings -a [gpu:0]/GPUFanControlState=1 -a [fan:0]/GPUTargetFanSpeed=95\n\nChange the values to what you need.

I am running Ubuntu 10.04 on VMPlayer within Windows 7. Our corporation has just enforced an internet proxy, let's call it internet.largecompany.com:8443 for the sake of argument, and we can no longer get access to outside sites.\nWe can get access to the internet without any issues on Windows but no access at all from Ubuntu. I've tried changing the proxy settings in System>Preferences>Network Proxy along with providing my username and password but to no avail.\nAny ideas? Anything I should try?\n\nA: Answering my own question here.\nI also should have added to my original question that we require authentication on the internet.largecompany.com:8443 proxy i.e. we get prompted for username and password.\nTherefore, the way we resolved was to use the open source network tool Cntlm Authentication Proxy. This worked perfectly for our requirements.\n\nA: In order to get Internet access in the web browser, change the network settings in the browser. It works for me through proxy server.\nI have also not been able to make system wide Internet access work.\n\nA: Your problem is more than likely due to the fact you have the Virtual Machine set up to use a NAT. As far as the Virtual Machine is concerned it is directly connected to the internet, the host machine (Windows 7) is supposed to forward any network traffic onto the \"real\" internet. \nLike a lot of Virtual Machine software packages I would assume VMWare defaults to giving the guest operating system its own private network (NAT). This means that setting your proxy settings on the Ubuntu Guest won't work because it won't be able to communicate with the proxy server. \nYou will need to check in the VMWare settings if it can be configured to use a proxy. If not then the only solution would be to use Bridged Networking for your Virtual Machine. This passes all network traffic from the Virtual Machine directly onto the host's network. Be warned! this will look to your network admin as if you have plugged a new computer into an Ethernet port. Don't do this without checking with your network admin first! \n", "Q: Move entire OS from NTFS drive to bigger ext4 drive According to SMART data, the hard drive I curently use is about to fail. I bought a new, bigger drive to copy the system to a safer place.\nThe old drive is 160GB. Ubuntu was installed with Wubi, and the partition is NTFS. There are a few other partitions around (recovery partition, swap...) that I don't care about.\nThe new drive is 320GB. I would like the new system to run on ext4, not on NTFS.\nI looked at solutions that use dd, or clonezilla, but it seems that moving to a different filesystem prevents me from using them.\nI considered installing a brand new ubuntu on the new hard drive and then copy /home from the old drive to the new drive, but I heard that there would be file permission problems. I would also have to reinstall all my software.\nOne last thing: the NTFS drive has dead sectors. I don't know how this can influence the copy process, but I mention it just in case.\nedit: I do not care about the windows partition. I just want Ubuntu to make the transition.\n\nA: I have no experience with Wubi; anyway, googling a bit:\nWubi creates a virtual file-system in a single file (you should find it in C:\\wubi\\disks\\root.disk). You should check booting your Ubuntu if it is an ext2, ext3 or ext4 fylesystem.\nNow:\n\n\n*\n\n*you should start Ubuntu in live mode (using your Ubuntu CD or creating a boot USB);\n\n*Mount or access the partition where Ubuntu is installed in;\n\n*Once there, you can clone your file-system (if it is ext4 as you desire) with dd (see examples here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_%28Unix%29);\n\n*Unmount the partition where the original Ubuntu is installed;\n\n*Install grub in the new disk (try typing in a terminal sudo update-grub);\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: What you are asking to do is impossible(at least as far as I know), Wubi Lives inside of your Windows install. The besides NTFS and Ext4 are competly 2 different file systems, and windows can not live on Ext4, just like Linux can't live on NTFS, (Technically the Wubi install is a Ext4 file system). If you have no use for Windows anymore, your best bet would probably be to just install Linux and leave windows out of the equation, and copy your data as individual files.\nOf course you will want to make sure you make backups before you do anything and possibly muck up your system. Hopefully this helps and good luck.\n\nA: I don't have any experiencing with wubi, but I assume that from your wubi install you should be able to rsync the system contents (excluding /dev, /proc and /sys) to the new hard driver (after manually creating the ext4 partitions on it). \nDetails on how to do it with rsync can be found at http://users.telenet.be/mydotcom/howto/linux/clone.htm (on your case source and target would be local mount points).\nAfter cloning the system contents you will need to:\na) Adjust /etc/fstab on the new disk\nb) Install grub on the new disk\n\n", "Q: Can I open visual basic .vbp files using gambas?

It also has the ability to switch between the engines, and an engine auto select mode which automatically selects the best engine for playing a particular type of file.\nIt's in the Ubuntu 10.10 official repositories so you can search for it in the Ubuntu Software Center.\nFor Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx, install it using these commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome-media-player-development/development\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gnome-media-player\n\n\nA: Boxee - http://www.boxee.tv\nIt's a media center (in my opinion the best there is) for Linux, Windows and  Mac.\nIt supports lots of video / music portals as well as DVD, CD and local media in general.\nIt's currently not available in the Software center but I listed an idea on getsatisfaction: http://getsatisfaction.com/boxee/topics/add_boxee_to_the_ubuntu_software_center\nAvailable for 32 bit and 64 bit as a *.deb file.\n\n\nA: Beatbox is the music player under active development for the ElementaryOS project.\nIt offers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Automatic and manually arranged playlists\n\n*Last.fm support (scrobbler + similar tracks)\n\n*A play queue\n\n*An Equalizer with presets and custom settings support\n\n*A slick interface with 3 views\n\n\n\n\nA: There is GNOME MPlayer, a GTK+ frontend to MPlayer. Among its features are support for hardware acceleration and subtitles.\n\n\n\nA: Clementine Music Player - http://www.clementine-player.org/\nClementine is a multiplatform music player. It is inspired by Amarok 1.4, focusing on a fast and easy-to-use interface for searching and playing  music.\n\n\nA: I recommend installing SMplayer instead of VLC. SMPlayer supports VDPAU. (I heard that VLC also supports VDPAU, but I have not been able to find any PPAs with a VLC package that supports VDPAU / VAAPI without errors.)\nGlossary:\nVDPAU: The VDPAU API allows video programs to offload portions of the video decoding process and video post-processing to the GPU video hardware.\nVAAPI: VAAPI is an open source software library (\"libVA\") and the API specification which provides access to graphics hardware (GPU) acceleration for video processing on Linux and Unix-based operating systems. Accelerated processing includes video decoding, video encoding, subpicture blending and rendering.\n\nA: SMPlayer is recommended as it has a really good interface and uses the superb MPlayer as its backend.\nIt supports a great variety of codecs, and plays practically any major format you throw at it. It uses Qt, and integrates reasonably well with an Ubuntu desktop.\nYou can install SMPlayer by either searching via Software Center or by running Terminal and passing the command:\n sudo apt-get install smplayer \n\nA: Listen Music Player - http://www.listen-project.org/\n\n\nA: XMMS - http://www.xmms.org/\nThis looks similar to Audacious judging by the screenshots, another player I have not used.\n\nA: Bangarang Media Player - http://gitorious.org/bangarang\nOffers a media—audio and video—player with a lightweight interface\n\n\nA: Miro: http://www.getmiro.com/\nIt may be more of a podcatcher (or at least started off as one) that even supports bittorrent but it does play media as well.\n\n\nA: MPlayer is also a good one, which makes a good choice for scripting, since it provides feedback when exiting (e.g. Exiting... (End of file)), and allows you to react upon this, e.g. mark the file as played.\nIt's available in Ubuntu, in different flavors (e.g. mplayer-gui or just mplayer).\nYou can use VLC for scripting, too:\nif vlc -f --play-and-exit $FILE | grep 'main playlist: end of playlist, exiting$' ; then\n    echo \"File played completely.\"\nfi\n\n\nA: Totem Movie Player (the default movie player in Ubuntu) is pretty good.

Since some file formats play well only on a certain engine, this media player was made with 3 engines, so that the user can select the required engine required for playing a particular file type. It also has an engine auto select mode, in which the player automatically selects the best engine for the particular type of file being played.\n\n\nA: Exaile Player - http://www.exaile.org/\nExaile is a music manager and player for GTK+ written in Python\n\n\nA: Although it is a freeware (non open source) windows application, and so require wine to be run, I think that foobar2000 is yet one of the best audio playes out there.\nIt supports a wide number of formats (MP3, MP4, AAC, CD Audio, WMA, Vorbis, FLAC, WavPack, WAV, AIFF, Musepack, Speex, AU, SND and more with additional components). \nIt has advanced tagging capabilities.\nAnd most important to me, it supports the playing of single-wav-file CDs through CUE sheets to switch between tracks.\n\n\nA: In my experience, for the sole purpose to play something fast and easy with a \"right-click/open with...\" or by relating certain files to a player, there is also the Dragon Player Which does an awesome and lightweight thus fast work, it can play both video/audio files (mp3/wav/avi/mpg, etc.) and/or discs (CD/VCD/DVD, etc.)\nIt uses KDE so you may need to install certain dependencies if you are not using KDE and not already installed, afterwards you'll find it fast running on Unity, Gnome and other environments.\nIt has not a lot of features, which makes of this the cleanest click-to-play media player.\nFrom the site:\n\nA video player with a different philosophy: Simple, uncluttered\n  interface.\nFeatures:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Plays all video formats supported by Phonon.\n  \n*Bundled with a simple web-page KPart.\n  \n*Starts quickly.

In the launcher there are two types of launcher items. The default ones in the bottom part of the launcher, such as the Workspace Switcher, Applications lens, Files & Folders lens and Trash, and the other normal launcher items in the upper part of the launcher, such as the browser that I've added.\nIt seems I can't mix the two types of launchers and change the position of the two groups.\nIs there any way to change that behavior?\n\nA: There is no way you can change that behavior.\nThe upper part is for custom user launcher items, basically shortcuts, the bottom part is for lenses, like the Applications and Files & Folders lenses which are installed by default and there is the Trash launcher items which is fixed at the very bottom of the launcher.\nYou can customize the position of every item in its group however.\n", "Q: Can I use the same home folder on different Linux systems (multiboot)? When installing more than one Linux version on the same computer (for testing purposes e.g. Ubuntu 10.10 and 11.04), is it possible to have the same home folder (e.g. on a separate partition) on all Operating system versions?\n\nA: Although it is possible to have the same partition as a home partition on both installations, I would not recommend this: \nApart from user files, the home folder includes also the settings for programs in hidden folders, and if the both operating system (OS) versions use the same programs in different versions, this can lead to conflicts.\nTherefore it is better to only share only the user files. This can be done as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the first OS installation, just\nuse a normal separate home partition\n\n*On the second OS installation, don't use a separate home partition, but bind all folders inside the home folder you want to share on both operating systems via /etc/fstab:\n\n*first, be sure to mount your home partition from the other OS somewhere. E.g., when your home partition is a ext3 partition on /dev/sda5, this fstab line does this: \n/dev/sda5  /mnt/sda5       ext3    defaults        0       2\n\n\n*now, bind all folders from that home partition to your own home folder on the second OS. This could also be done with a /etc/fstab line: \n/mnt/sda5/username/Downloads    /home/username/Downloads      none  bind  0  0\n\ndoes this for your Downloads folder. (adjust path to your own needs and repeat that with all other folders you want to.)\n\n*when you have finished /etc/fstab editing, remount all /etc/fstab entries by\nsudo mount -a\n\n\nA: I am currently running Fedora 15 and Ubuntu 11.10 on the first 2 partitions, but they both share the third partition as a home partition.  It seemed the real conflict was trying to share the same directory, not the same partition.  If you want to point out why what I did was so terrible I would love to hear it, but I have had no issues so far.\n\nA: I have 2 dual booting machines - both sharing the same /home which is an entire drive. \nOne is currently running Ubuntu 14.04 32-bit and Ubuntu 14.04 Studio 64-bit and this one I'm on now is running Ubuntu 14.04 32 bit and Pinguy 14.04 32 bit. \nAlthough I use Ubuntu 32 bit most often on both systems, I haven't had any problems with this approach thus far. This is by no means a guarantee that you won't have trouble and I'll admit I was a bit concerned that I might have issues with having a 64 bit and a 32 bit share the same home. \nNote: I haven't tried this with non-Debian based systems thus far. The nice thing about having a good backup/restore plan is that even  if you do something incredibly stupid, overcoming the problem is pretty straightforward.\nSource: Experience\n", "Q: Why are the hidden settings-folders not deleted when purging an application? I did \nsudo apt-get remove --purge\nfor several packages, but apparently the personal settings are kept. Is there a command or tool to delete them automatically?\n\nA: If you mean the folders in your home folder: No, the package manager never touches anything in a users's home folder. \nI don't know of any tool that assists you in cleaning your home folder from config files you don't need any more - but that sounds like a nice idea.\n", "Q: Will GNOME3 installation break Lubuntu? I installed Lubuntu on my netbook and I'm wondering whether it is safe to install GNOME3 via PPA or if it will break the system just like in Ubuntu.

Okay so I'm not exactly sure how it happened, but recently Ubuntu has been trying to mount an external hard drive that I usually have plugged in during boot. A message comes up during boot asking me to either wait, or press S to skip if the drive isn't plugged in when I start up my laptop.\nMy question is, how do I disable this drive from mounting at startup so I don't have to prompt Ubuntu to skip it at boot? I've looked up a couple other solutions to this, but all of them only seem to completely disable automounting, which would require me to manually mount the device when it's plugged in, which is not what I want. I just want to disable it from mounting at startup. \n\nA: If there is a line in /etc/fstab related to that drive, remove it.\nThe file is read only for all users other that root. \nTo edit it use the command gksu gedit /etc/fstab, but make a copy of the file before editing, and do not touch nothing other than removing that line.\n\nA: To disable USB automount in Ubuntu 11.10 (with Gnome 3), launch dconf-editor (package dconf-tools) and uncheck the following entries:\n\n\n*\n\n*org.gnome.desktop.media-handling automount\n\n*org.gnome.desktop.media-handling automount-open\n\n\nA: It is not possible to prevent Ubuntu 11.10 from automounting media when it is plugged in or on booting.

I want to get rid of all the settings eg. of wine which aren't deleted when purging it, but don't want to delete them all by hand. Is there any tool, that lets me do this? If not that might be a coding-idea for some one?\n\nA: There is no such tool I am aware of, but some programs do store the path to the users configuration files in their manual page under the Files section. The next text is retrieved from man chromium-browser:\n\nFILES  \n   ~/.config/chromium\n          Default directory for configuration data.\n   ~/.cache/chromium\n          Default directory for cache data.  (Why?  See \n          <http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/> .\n\n\nIf you've just installed an application and want to purge it including any settings, you might want to look for these files based on their modification time. That can be done using find with the -mtime (modification time in days) or -mmin (in minutes) options. For example, if you've started the program within an hour (=60 minutes), you should run:\nfind ~ -mmin -60 -ls | less\n\nThe output will contain the modification date, owner/group (usually your user/group), size and name and will be piped into less so you can use your arrow keys, page up and down keys for navigating.\nFinally, you can look at the source (you're using FOSS software, right :) ) if you understand the language. If the program is small, this is doable. But if the program is large, it gets more difficult.\n\nA: If you want to reset all of your personal settings, you should delete all hidden files in your home directory, with the excpetion of .bash_logout, .bashrc, .profile (these three files are copied from /etc/skel on user creation).\nIt is not always simple to delete settings for a particular application, because the hidden file or directory it create, usually on first run, can have sometimes a name very cryptic (for example the hidden directory for pidgin used to be .purple).\nApart from pathological cases, a search like\nfind ~ -iname '*appname*'\n\nshould give a good hint of what to delete to reset the application.\nEDIT:\nAs @htorque pointed out in a comment below, in hidden files and dirs there could be also data, as emails under .evolution, browser bookmarks under .mozilla/firefox, and the like. \nSo, as always, have a backup of your sensible data somewhere.\n\nA: It is also possible with Ubuntu Tweak\n", "Q: How to easily open the Launcher with a secondary monitor to the left I have two monitors (24\" as main and a 19\" to the left). \nEach time I want to swap to a different application or launch a new one, the launcher seems a little problematic to come up. Even though moving my mouse across the top Ubuntu logo gets it up, it still seems quite spasmodic.\nAnybody else found a problem and is there a solution?\n\nA: Create a Mouse Void\nThis is quite a long answer that I felt is better kept separate from my other one. \nSo that you understand where this solution came from, my monitor layout is as follows:\n\nThe two black area 1280x88 are off the screen but my mouse can still enter this due to an X bug. The workaround is a small program that prevents the mouse entering this void called XCreateMouseVoid. \nHome Button Mouse Stopper\nYou can also use XCreateMouseVoid to create a small box that the mouse will stop against when pushed into the top left corner of the primary screen. This is what I have shown in green area of this image:\n\nInstalling\n\n\n*\n\n*Download XCreateMouseVoid and extract the files to your home folder\n\n*Open the folder in Terminal and run this command:\ncd ~/XCreateMouseVoid && make\n\n\n*Test the program with values:\n~/XCreateMouseVoid/XCreateMouseVoid 0 0 1280 88\n\n\n*Add to Startup Applications so its always runs upon bootup.\nCalculate Values\nThe values required for XCreateMouseVoid are: x, y , w, h\n\n\n*\n\n*x & y refer to the start co-ordinates of the rectangle. These co-ordinates are based upon the whole desktop area and not individual monitors.\n\n*w & h refer to the width and height of the rectangle\n\n\nFor my setup to stop the mouse entering the top and bottom black 1280 x 88 areas along with stopping it travel past the Home Button, I run two instances of the program with these values: \nXCreateMouseVoid 0 0 1280 88\nXCreateMouseVoid 0 1112 1280 88\n\nSmall Rectangle\nIf you have a different setup you can create the small rectangle as I mentioned earlier. The rectangle measures 60 x 25, which is the minimum width needed to properly stop the mouse. \nThe only value you need to change is x which is calculated by subtracting 60 from your secondary monitor's width. e.g. 1280 x 1024 monitor I subtract 60 from 1280 to get the value 1220 for XCreateMouseVoid:\nXCreateMouseVoid 1220 0 60 25\n\nTrapped Mouse Cursor\nOccasionally the mouse cursor can jump into the created mouse void and become trapped. The solution is to press either the Super or Menu key so that a menu opens and frees the mouse cursor.\n\nA: I have the same setup and it is quite annoying. The reason it doesn't work well with secondary monitor to the left is there is no barrier to stop the cursor from moving further to the left off from the home button which normally occurs in a single monitor scenario.\nMouse Precision\nYou need to be very precise and put the mouse cursor only in the top left corner pixels of the main screen. \n\nShortcuts can be used as an alternative:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold down the Super key and use either mouse or keypad \n\n*Press Alt+F1 and use arrow keys\n\n\n\nDisable the Launcher from hiding:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Compiz Config Settings Manager\n from the Ubuntu Software Center\n\n*Open Compiz Config Settings Manager from Dash\n\n*Find Unity plugin and change Hide Launcher to Never\n\nOpen with left edge of screen:\nYou can actually open the Launcher by moving the mouse to the far left of the secondary monitor if you have enabled Pushes left edge of screen in Launchers and Menus.  It's not intuitive nor ergonomic but it works.  \n\n", "Q: is there any app or workaround to blacklist or whitelist apps and websites?

I have installed preload but it did not achieve the effect I want. \nI have a MacBook 4.1 Core2Duo with 4GB of RAM.\nThanks in advance and greetings.\n\nA: Nautilus is already running, as it controls your desktop.\nSince you have 4GB RAM, you should prefer to have the programs running in memory (RAM) rather than having them stored on the swap partition. I doubt that your swap is used at all.\nYou can verify with the free command.\n             total       used       free\nMem:       3052684    2227020     825664\n-/+ buffers/cache:     982204    2070480\nSwap:      2200988          0    2200988\n\nThe value 0 above means that for this example, 0 bytes are used on the swap partition, and this is good. Instead, all of the files are loaded into the RAM so they can run much faster. buffers/cache is memory used to cache file structures, and is primed with the files that have been read with readahead.\nIf your computer feels somewhat slowish, look into the graphics driver that is being used.\n\nA: The linux kernel is very efficient at managing memory and typically, if we assume that you have plenty of RAM, a process will reside in physical memory in its entirety. However the linux kernel is smart and will still swap out parts of a process if it knows with relative certainty that the page is unlikely to ever be accessed again in the lifetime of the process. \nThat being said, you can encourage the kernel to keep things in memory and avoid swapping by setting the swappiness\n", "Q: How to switch language spellingcheck on the fly when changing keyboard with alt-shift? i just recently installed ubuntu 11.04, english version that comes with libreoffice.\nI also installed Greek language.\nIs there some way to make Writer recognize my input language (English - Greek) and apply spelling check on the fly, according to my input language?\nFor example, i type a sentence in English, then switch keyboard input (Alt-Shift) and type a sentence in Greek.

My issue was that Ubuntu would start booting, but the dots would stop at some point, and there would not be any disk activity on the USB key. The system was hung.\nI remembered that there were some power management issues under some other version of ubuntu, so I added the options:\n\n\n*\n\n*acpi=off\n\n*noapic\n\n\nThe first one is the one which seems to make the difference. The second one is harmless but is not required, as far as I can see.\nTo add this option do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*When booting from the USB, if you made your USB key with unetbootin, Press TAB to edit the options.\n\n*insert acpi=off on the command line. This is the line where you also see word like quiet or splash\n\n*Boot your machine.\n\n\nProceed with the installation. When you will reboot, you will have a similar manual change to do the first time. You will need to add the same option on the boot line. This time, you select the first line, but instead of pressing Enter, press letter e to edit it. \nOnce the installed Ubuntu is started, you need to edit the file:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo vi /etc/defaults/grub\ninsert the acpi=off on the line that starts with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT. Then enter the command:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo update-grub\nYour computer startup should be updated. My only issue on my HP Mini 110 is that when I do a shutdown, it does not completely shutdown. The disk is still properly flushed, and there is no apparent data loss. But this is better than no linux at all.\n\nA: Which program did you use to create the usb stick?

So, you should have /tmp/vmware-tools-distrib.  Inside that you have a bin directory and there is the vmware-uninstall-tools.pl file.\ncp /tmp/vmware-tools-distrib/bin/vmware-uninstall-tools.pl /usr/bin/\n\nThen run the installer once more:\n/tmp/vmware-tools-distrib/vmware-install.pl\n\nIt will come back with an error that might look like this:\n\"Can't exec \"/etc/vmware-caf/pme/install/preupgrade.sh\": No such file or directory at /usr/bin/vmware-uninstall-tools.pl line 4115.\"\n\nHowever, the installer will keep working and eventually proceed to the installation phase.\n\nA: This also happened to me when I interrupted vmware tools upgrade.\nit seems, the first thing the upgrade does is delete all files in the system. the uninstall script being the first one and that's why you can't find it.\nI don't understand why the installation gets interrupted+ if the uninstall script is not found (for me, that's just a bad decision), but the mounted device comes with its own script which you can use to delete everything.\na simple \nlocate vmware-uninstall\n\noutputed its location and for me it was in\n/home/my_username/Desktop/vmware-tools-distrib/bin/vmware-uninstall-tools.pl\n\nFor you, the only difference should be ronald instead of *my_username*.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: I solved this same problem doing fixes below. I would summarize issue as aborting a vmware-install when kernel headers not found. Pressing Ctrl-C during vmware-install can cause the \"Error: Unable to execute \"/usr/bin/vmware-uninstall-tools.pl.\" in several cases in general.\nTo install the kernel headers needed by vmware tools run uname -r (to get kernel name) and apt-get below. Might end up needing to do this even after a 'sudo apt-get install build-essentials' when you update to a leading edge kernel via 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade' or manually. I added build-essential to apt-get because you always need it for vmware tools. \n$ uname -r\n3.5.0-46-generic\n$sudo apt-get install linux-headers-3.5.0-46-generic build-essential\n\nTo correct \"Error: Unable to execute \"/usr/bin/vmware-uninstall-tools.pl.\" do a sudo copy of the vmware-uninstall-tools.pl from the new vmware tools you want to install to the location it is looking for it (typically /usr/bin)\nAs an example, I usually open a terminal and change directory to /tmp then click on VMware menu Manage then option \"Reinstall VMware Tools...\" then (once VMware mounts its CDROM of latest tools) copy tar from read-only CDROM to /tmp as below (based on a version 9.6.1-1378637)\n$ cd /tmp\n$ cp /media/my_username/VMware\\ Tools/VMwareTools-9.6.1-1378637.tar.gz .\n$ tar -xzf VMwareTools-9.6.1-1378637.tar.gz\n$ cd vmware-tools-distrib\n$ cp bin/vmware-uninstall-tools.pl /usr/bin/\n$ sudo ./vmware-install.pl\n\n\nA: The vmware install script checks if the package is present on your installation. The solution is to purge the package:\nsudo dpkg --purge open-vm-tools\n\n\nA: copy uninstall script from vmware-tools-distrib/bin/ to /usr/bin as following command:\ncp path_to_extracted_vmware-tools_dir/bin/vmware-uninstall-tools.pl /usr/bin/.\n\nthen run install script again.\n\nA: This was caused by me killing the install (CNTRL C) because I forgot to add -d to automate the install with defaults. The initial run of the script creates the /etc/vmware-tools folder, because that exists the script thinks vmware-tools is already installed.\nSimple answer is:\nsudo rm -R /etc/vmware-tools\nthen re-run the installation script.\n\nA: I ran into this when I upgrade the version of VMWare on my host, and followed its instructions for updating the client.\nAfter I'd mounted the virtual CD image, untarred and ran the installed, I saw the message:\n\nThe installer has detected an existing installation of open-vm-tools packages  on this system and will not attempt to remove and replace these user-space  applications. It is recommended to use the open-vm-tools packages provided by  the operating system. If you do not want to use the existing installation of  open-vm-tools packages and use VMware Tools, you must uninstall the  open-vm-tools packages and re-run this installer. The packages that need to be removed are:\n  open-vm-tools \n  Packages must be removed with the --purge option.\n\nFrom this it is clear what muast be done to remove them:\n\nsudo apt-get remove --purge open-vm-tools\n\nI did that, and re-ran the installer. And this time I got:\n\nopen-vm-tools packages are available from the OS vendor and VMware recommends using open-vm-tools packages. See http://kb.vmware.com/kb/2073803 for more \n  information.\n  Do you still want to proceed with this installation? [no] no\n\nSo I gave up on installing the client software from the virtual ISO in the host, and just ran\n\nsudo apt-get install open-vm-tools\n\nIOW, the right answer for this issue isn't to find a way to work around installing the vm tools from the host ISO, but to not install the vm tools from the host ISO, but to update the open-vm-tools package, instead.\n", "Q: How can I make an AverTv tuner work?

Does anybody have a personal recommendation for a USB wifi network adapter that:\n\n\n*\n\n*has decent Linux drivers\n\n*supports 802.11n speeds\n\n*will connect to a wifi signal in the 5GHz band?\n\n\nI've spent some time in google, the Ubuntu hardware compatibility pages and reading through various launchpad bug trails about support for the ralink chipset variations being a bit spotty. \nI'm really finding it difficult to see any clear choice for me to purchase, so could do with a nudge in the right direction. \nIt would be ideal if it worked out of the box with kernel drivers, but I'll mess around with ndiswrapper etc if required.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: There are many solutions for wireless adapters to work most (if not all) on the 802.11g or 802.11n specification in the 2.4 GHz band. I had no succces finding any adapters we know for sure that they work in a dual band setting on 5 GHz. \nThis may be just bad luck or insufficient search capability on my side but just in case nobody else leaves a positive message her I recommend you run your wireless network using an external adapter that transforms the wireless 5GHz signal into a Ethernet network signal. By this you will be able to enjoy OS and driver independent wireless networking.\nHere I have only experience with a Buffalo AirStation WLI-TX4-AG300N that works like a charm but there are a few other good products available.\n\nA: Generally speaking the ath9k driver is pretty good and I haven't had many problems with the intel-pro 5100agn chipsets(I see a lot of people get a little upset with them, but it's never gone so horribly wrong that a reboot didn't fix it.  Most of the Intel driver issues are related to power mgmt/resume from suspend).  I no longer have the N capability disabled(it didn't used to work.  now it does.)\n", "Q: How to allow Upstart task to block system boot? I'm writing an Upstart task which runs at runlevel 1.\nThis is for an ecrypted system, and the task's job is to verify the integrity of the MBR & /boot. As such, it is important that this task runs as early as possible during system boot (so I've chosen runlevel 1).\n99% of the time this task will just exit silently, but if it detects any problem, it needs a way of letting the user know, and ideally pausing the system boot until the user confirms.\nI've tried the following as a test, but I cannot interrupt the system boot. Any suggestions?\nstart on runlevel [1]\nexec echo -n \"Warning: MBR and/or /boot changed. Press any key to continue.\"\nexec read\nconsole output\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: vonbraun, runlevels mean something very different than they used to, so I don't believe runlevel 1 is actually where you want to be.\nSine you want to run ASAP, there are two options.\nIf you can work without writing to the root filesystem, and your data is guaranteed to be on the root filesystem, you can use the mounting event.\nstart on mounting MOUNTPOINT=/\n\nThe mounting event is a \"hook\", so mountall will wait for anything that uses it to unblock. You definitely must use the 'task' keyword so that your checks can run fully before mountall is unblocked.\nAt this point in the boot, the root filesystem is still readonly, but should be available. Other filesystems may not be available, so be aware (/var/run, in particular, can be tricky in this way). Do not use \"AND\" with another mounting event as that will lock up boot.\nIf you need to write to the root FS, you can use\nstart on mounted MOUNTPOINT=/\n\nThis will block mountall again, but after / is remounted read-write. This should prevent the resulting signals that kick off other parts of the boot from happening.\nThere are no guarantees here though, some other things will be going on in parallel. However, most of the boot will be delayed waiting for access to the filesystem, and in the stated scenario, that seems like the desired result.\nNote that there are a lot of good related ideas in the Upstart cookbook\nhttp://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Does powering off the PC without shutting down harm the system? I accidentally killed Compiz in my Unity session and couldn't restart it. So I powered the PC off with the hardware button. I am wondering if that could cause damage to my system?  I didn't have any applications running.\n\nA: *\n\n*Ctrl+Alt+F1  \n\n*Login\n\n*sudo init 0\nIs it possible to damage something that way?  Yes.  Does it happen a lot?  Not a whole lot in my experience.  If you are trying to get Compiz to restart Ctrl+Alt+T usually pops open a terminal window and compiz &  usually gets it restarted.\n\nA: That button is there just for the reason of shutting your system down when it is stalled! So in the case of shutdown using the button, no hardware damage is possible (noting that a corrupt file system or stored content is not a hardware problem).\n\nA: the kernel has a few keyboard combo's in there that allows you to shutdown or logout safely:\nalt gr + print screen + k   (returns to login screen)\nalt gr + print screen + o   (safely forces a shutdown)\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu as the single OS on a MacBook?

Why is the maximum size of a WUBI-Installation limited to 30GB? If someone has 1TB hdd drive but can't format or create new partitions it would be great to have a bigger wubi.\n\nA: It is a design decision: Wubi is intented to be used for first time users of Ubuntu and should help answering questions like \"Is Ubuntu something I can use?\" without having to do any formatting, creating partitions or any other instruction that could potentially destroy their previously used OS.\nIf you want a full fledged install with lots of free space and any feature you might desire you will have to install it with as a multi-boot (or as a single OS removing any other OS).\n\nA: I would like not to be forced to use Wubi, but my Dell XPS 630i with a hardware RAID 1 does not allow me to use anything else.  I have tried many times to have an Ubuntu - Windows Vista dual boot, but the only Linux CD/DVD that I can boot from is OpenSuse (and it's not a Live one).\nI really wish to overcome such constraint, but I could only switch to a Wubi solution :-(\n", "Q: Install to SD Card I've been wondering about improving the performance and battery life of my netbook by installing my root partition to an SD card. Will there be any performance benefits (or drawbacks)? Are there any special changes that should be done to make this work better.\n\nA: Your performance will actually drop, if you put Ubuntu on an SD card. Mostly this will be due to the read/write speed/bottleneck of the media, and essentially it will be like installing your system on a USB drive with persistence enabled (it will be usable, but not nearly faster/more stable than a proper installation).\nYou could run it as a Live installation though.\n", "Q: Receiving unwanted emails from launchpad I had clicked something in Launchpad, under impression i will receive answers by email, relevant to my question. \nBut now I am getting  a flood of completely irrelevant emails, hundreds a day, which i diverted to trash.

I have a GeForce FX 5200, and my driver is blacklisted, but I forced Unity and it works. Not the best performance, though.\nHowever, the best solution would be to use Unity 2D, which is basically the same, but designed for non-accelerated graphics.\n\nA: Did you try installing the newest (11.4) FGLRX from ATI Driver Download site?

I switched to ATI 11.04 fglrx and it works fine except for Plymouth as usual.\n\nA: Not sure if this has been answered, but I believe the T500 has switchable Intel/ATI graphics.  You need to force you system to use the discrete graphics in the BIOS.  Right now, it sounds like you're trying to boot using the Intel graphics, which is the default under the \"switchable\" setting.\n\nA: In 12.04, fglrx new version quite good for my ati 5770. Unity works smoothly. Opensource radeon driver works well too, but it can't control power management(temperature) well.\nTry 12.04 daily live image or 11.10 with usb stick.

The tutorial is for an older version of Ubuntu but works fine for 10.10 and 11.04.\nThe reason why a separate partition must be created  is because the USB creator only makes one partition by default (FAT32 filesystem).

In addition to this direction, a decision was made at UDS to drop all of the cloud components, and in fact, most of the \"extra\" server packages, from the Ubuntu Server CD ISO (the DVD image will still have everything). They will still be fully supported, but not shipped on the CD or available in the installer. Given that, the only thing that the OpenStack change means, is that anything we develop around private IaaS solutions, will focus on OpenStack.\nEucalyptus is still available, and will remain available as long as it meets the requirements for Ubuntu to keep supporting it. Eucalyptus, the company, has committed to bring 3.0 into Oneiric, which will bring with it the open sourcing of some features that were previously only available in their enterprise edition.\nIf you're going to be deploying something that you expect to live for more than 18 months (the supported lifetime of 11.04 and 11.10), I'd suggest using 10.04 as your platform, as it will receive security fixes until April of 2015.

I removed PulseAudio as it seemed to be in conflict with Skype and VLC but now the volume indicator applet is gone and the action keys won't turn up nor down the volume. \nIs there a solution? or Is PulseAudio required for the application indicator? \n\nA: A significant majority of the sound software in Ubuntu now expects the presence of pulseaudio.  There are some historical issues with skype, which may be fixed for some newer skype clients (I've seen many reports that this is the case, but others indicating it isn't, and suspect a continual process of bugfixing by skype).  The issue with VLC is known, and expected to have been fixed in the upcoming release of Ubuntu 11.10.\nKeeping pulseaudio installed is strongly recommended, for integration with the various audio management applications installed in all flavours of Ubuntu (including indicator-sound), which are configured to use pulseaudio as a backend.  If you are affected by issues with integration between pulseaudio and other applications, the easiest workaround is to use pasuspender, for example pasuspender -- skype to temporarily suspect pulseaudio whilst running skype, restoring normal behaviour when skype exits.\nUnfortunately, there is no currently safe way to have both working desktop sounds and running skype: if pulseaudio is removed, then skype will bind to ALSA, blocking the binding from other applications (including alerts, etc.).  ALSA's dmix plugin is sometimes recommended as a way to work around this, but this then limits hardware support to a subset of that described as \"supported\" by Ubuntu and runs into other issues with multiple audio interfaces (such as for users who have a separate USB headset for telephony).\n", "Q: Do kernel downgrades to fix power regressions in newer kernels?

I was wondering if it were possible to downgrade from kernel 2.6.38-8 to something earlier that doesn't have the power and battery life regression problems that have been keeping me from using Ubuntu abroad. Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: Instructions for installing different kernels are described here\nI would suggest that you deactivate any ATI driver you may have activated/installed first.  \nThen install the kernels appropriate to your ubuntu architecture - 32 bit or 64bit.\nWhen booting, you'll need to press SHIFT to display your Grub.  You can then select the older kernel to boot with.\nPhoronix are reporting that the start of the power regression started with the Maverick kernel (2.6.35) and got considerably worse from there.  However, others have found no regression - some even better battery life.  So its not a consistent picture for everyone.\nAssuming you find a kernel stack that works (e.g. Lucid - 2.6.32) then try activating/installing your ATI driver.\nLet us know what you find.\n", "Q: How long does Wubi take to download and/or save place?

Can I download a ISO myself and place it somewhere that Wubi will grab from so it just installs it, not downloads the ISO? (this way I can watch the % too)\nIm at a conference and my internet is fluctuating between 3-7MBs...if that helps\n\nA: Wubi, just as any other download will only download as fast as your internet connection allows.\n\nA: I used to download the ISO (via torrent, http), mount it using ImageDisk, and then run Wubi from the mounted disk. \n", "Q: How do I report a missing package dependency during an upgrade? A friend of mine (somewhat new to linux) recently upgraded from 10.10 to 11.04 and his OS broke from the upgrade. A few minutes of troubleshooting showed that the culprit was the PAE kernel that the upgrade decided to install since it determined he had 4GB of phyisical RAM. More specifically the upgrade forgot to install the linux-headers-generic-pae required by the closed source nvidia drivers. \nI'm not entirely sure how to report this bug to the devs. Its an easy fix (after booting into the non-pae kernel and installing the package everything worked), but they are encouraging users to use the built-in bug reporting system and I'm not entirely certain how to report update bugs. \n\nA: You should open a bug against the linux kernel package. The easiest way to do this is from a shell prompt, by typing the following:\nubuntu-bug linux\n\n\n\n*\n\n*This will collect information and error logs commonly needed for kernel troubleshooting, and include them in the bug report.\n\n\nA: If the problem is tied to a particular package, such as a missing dependency, even if it's relevant only during an upgrade, then it should be reported to that particular package.\n", "Q: Is there a way to add a main menu button to the unity panel? I like many of the features of unity (ubuntu 11.04). I use a netbook and so enjoy having less wasted space. The side menu is fine too. However where is the main menu? Using the dash to get there is not easy as the icon is already off the bottom of the screen (I tried to move it to the top) and besides dash is slow, slow, slow. The main menu is one click and move the mouse to the application you have but are not sure of the name and click and go. Dash means a row of most used, then a row of others which needs a click to see the rest... then you click that and still have to search some more. I see something about \"white listing\" stuff for the unity panel. Is there some way to use this to add a main menu. I can live with and even enjoy everything else.\n\nA: Actually, there is a main menu button on the dock called applications (dark grey lower half) if you right click you will get the typical main menu entries and then the dash format opens. I would be also happy if I could move this \"icon\" to the top in case I dont remember (happens I am over 50) the name of the app and want to use my graphical memory by switching to classic view (like in windows).

The hard-drive is pretty knackered and started giving warnings about impending failure, so I would rather not boot from it.\nIt has three partitions, one of which does not mount automatically, but I can mount it and see the files in the terminal. The other two mount automatically on /media/ACER and /media/5E93-A93D when I plug the hardrive in, but I can't see any files on them - they appear empty in Nautilus/Thunar and the terminal. I know there are two FAT32 filesystems there, one with Windows XP on, and another that I used for My Documents. As far as I remember they were both nearly full.\nThey show up on system monitor as being completely empty. When I open GParted I get this confusing table:\nGParted screenshot showing weird partition usage amounts (can't post images sorry)\nThe 'Sized', 'Used' and 'Unused' columns don't add up.  This was after I mounted 'PQSERVICE' partition on '/media/sdc1', which mounts without any issues (albeit not automatically).\nI have tried using ddrescue to get the files off, but I could only get it to output a single file (I was after a directory structure), and the file that it did output was completely empty, so I guess ddrescue can't see anything there either.\nWhat's going on?\nAdditional Details\nThe hardrive is 60GB Seagate Momentus 4200.2.  Caddy is a £20 unbranded thing that my girlfriend bought at Maplins.\nThis harddrive comes from an old Acer Aspire 1682WLMi.  It came with Windows on the 'ACER' partition, nothing on the '5E93-A93D' partition (I used it for data), and the 'PQSERVICE' was not visible under Windows.  It is my understanding that FAT32 partition cannot be bigger than 32GB, and I suspect it was cheaper for Acer to simply partition the drive in this way rather than use NTFS.  It has at one time been a dual-boot system, but I took that off.\n\nA: If you suspect that the drive is failing and you want to recover as much data as possible and have 60GB free, then ddrescue is your best bet.  The instructions here should help:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery\nWhile I would suggest reading through that entire page, the basic steps you'll want to do are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unmount the partitions.\n\n*Use ddrescue to take a copy of each partition (/dev/sdc1 to /dev/sdc3) to somewhere on another disk.  See the above link for suggested parameters.\n\n*Mount the images via loopback with a command like mount -o loop,ro -t vfat sdc1.img /mnt and then copy files from there.\n\n\nBy recovering the files out of an image of the file system, you won't receive read errors.  However, your image may be missing some data depending on how successful ddrescue was.\nYou can run ddrescue repeatedly to attempt to recover more data, but I'd suggest trying to get an initial image of all three partitions before doing so.\n", "Q: How do I show a list of applications in Unity?

Both these options also allow filtering the results by a category. \n\n\nA: There is a MUCH better way than the answer provided here: \nOpen the terminal and type the following:\nsudo apt-get install classicmenu-indicator\n\nThat will give you exactly what you're looking for.\n", "Q: Is it possible to import/export radio station as a list into/from Banshee I have a list of radio stations that I am interested in importing to Banshee.

Any hints to where and how Banshee handles this list internally would be appreciated. Thanks!\n\nA: I think this is not a quite useful answer for you, I'll rather show you or some nice person with time and ambition a way to go.  \nBecause I didn't find an existing possibilty to get what you want (and I think there really is none), I believe the easiest way would be to write a tiny tiny extension. And this really doesn't seem very hard because the code exists already in other extensions.\nFor example Radio Station Fetcher: it just searches for radio stations on some websites and adds them to your radio \"playlist\". Therefore it uses a single dialog with two buttons (one for genre search and one for free text search) and that's all (you can try it yourself by installing banshee-extension-radiostationfetcher; you can find it then in the \"Tools\" menu).\nI looked at the code and all one have to do is replace the code for searching stations on those website with code that reads your list of stations. All the other code can almost stay the same. I would do it, but I don't have time.\nYou can find the code of all extensions here. Live Radio has the same functionality of adding a list of stations to your radio \"playlist\" but I think it has a bigger codebase to look through.  \nI hope that will help you or some kind person who will do the work for you :P\n", "Q: Putty-like copy/paste For ages I've been using Putty when working with *nix servers, and I really got used to it's copy&paste method: select, left-click - for copy, just right-click - for paste.\nHow can I set Ubuntu terminal the same way? I see there is a shortcuts configuration, but it does not allow me to set keys I need.

Since using Linux Mint distro, I had not this middle button simulation activated.\n(The latest version of evdev, version 2.5, changed the default for the middle mouse button emulation code. This change has disabled emulation of the middle mouse button by clicking the left and right mouse buttons) I needed to enable it manually: \nEnabling the middle mouse button emulation adding this to xorg.conf snippet:\n    Section \"InputClass\"\n       Identifier \"middle button emulation class\"\n       MatchIsPointer \"on\"\n       Option \"Emulate3Buttons\" \"on\"\n    EndSection\n\n\n*Using PuTTY Windows version:\n(I prefer this method since I do not need to change distro setting like Xorg, only Wine settings in order to connect to console serial ports):\nSince Wine handles com ports by having a link to the device (ie /dev/ttyUSB0), in the ~/.wine/dosdevices folder, this link would be created as follows, in order to update your wine profile configs:\nln -s /dev/ttyUSB0 ~/.wine/dosdevices/com1\n\nI prefer this second method, since the copy paste works always, do not need the middle button simulation and, the sherry in the top of the cake, it NEVER hangs (occasionally PuTTY for Windows hangs on some winXP installations).\nOtherwise, in case you do not need/want to install wine, the first method is preferable.\n\nA: I'm used to that feature too, that's why I use Ubuntu. All you need to do is open the terminal and type ssh myserver.gov.\nFor mega-fast copy-and-paste:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select text to Copy\n\n*Middle-click to Paste\n\n*\n\n*Middle-click is the mouse wheel click (or both mouse buttons)\n\n\n\nIt works with any selectable text in the OS: in the terminal, browser, ...\n\nA: Ubuntu terminal (gnome-terminal) has this feature. It just uses Middle-click to paste instead of Right-click.\nIn summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the text to copy\n\n*Middle-click where you want to paste it\n\n\nA: I've liked the plain old xterm for this behaviour, so you may want to use that. It works just like that on my machine. Ubuntu has XTerm installed by default, and you can run it using the xterm command.\nIn fact, the way copying and pasting work in PuTTY was modelled after xterm. As the Configuring PuTTY page mentions:\n\nPuTTY's copy and paste mechanism is modelled on the Unix xterm\n  application. The X Window System uses a three-button mouse, and the\n  convention is that the left button selects, the right button extends\n  an existing selection, and the middle button pastes.\nWindows typically only has two mouse buttons, so in PuTTY's default\n  configuration, the right button pastes, and the middle button (if\n  you have one) extends a selection.\nIf you have a three-button mouse...\n\n\nA: I use Ubuntu 16.04, gnome-shell and https://github.com/jrnewell/ubuntu-gnome-terminal-patch\nIt works like Putty, as I see.\nOrigin is http://www.taika.org/~tomba/gnome-terminal/index.html\n\nA: Can't help with setting it up like Putty, but an easier mouse way than Ctrl+Shift+C, Ctrl+Shift+V or menu is select Alt+Middle-button = copy and Middle-button = paste\n\nA: Even the LeftClick+RightClick can be used to paste the selected text anywhere in Ubuntu. Though, the \"Copy\" by simple selection is possible in the terminal only, the LeftClick+RightClick \"Paste\" works just fine everywhere in the OS, eg:text-editors.\nThis makes it useful while working with touch-pads on laptop when a mouse is not around.\nSo in the end the gnome terminal works almost like putty, just with the exception of a simultaneous Left+Right Click for \"Paste\" rather than a Right Click.\n\nA: I had the same issues using Ubuntu 14.10 and earlier:\nUnix style copy paste in the terminal not working.\nDisappointing default settings.\nHowever, here is a solution (partly resembling a wrap up of my predecessors):\n\n\n*To fix the terminal issue I successfully put the following lines into my xorg.conf:\n(see if  /etc/X11/xorg.conf is suitable for you. May be different for Lubuntu etc.)\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"middle button emulation class\"\n    MatchIsPointer \"on\"\n    Option \"Emulate3Buttons\" \"on\"\nEndSection\n\n\n\n*The very annoying malfunction of a missing 3rd mouse button (touch pad, Marble Mouse) can actually be fixed with the\n\"gpointing-device-settings\".\nJust install using CLI with\nsudo apt-get install gpointing-device-settings\n\nThen invoke\ngpointing-device-settings \n\nto get the GUI window.\nHowever, now I can use the unixish copy paste with mark and middle mouse button. At least in terminal.\nAnd for the Marble Mouse Trackball there is a separate article with a lot of config details.\nHope it helps.\nPS:\nDo not miss this Ask Ubuntu answer\non:\nEnable middle mouse for all users by changing the default value in /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.gschema.xml\nor just look for the term in duckduckgo.\nFF!!\naddendum: Here is a rare and interesting text about how resolution of mice is handled:\nBuilding a DPI Database for Mice\nAother excellent wrap up for the Marble Mouse / Logitech Marble Mouse Trackball is found here on the Ubuntu help wiki\n\nA: Only solution that worked on my Dell under Ubuntu 16.04 is: SHIFT+INSERT.

Examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*Login to work via ssh, start a multiplexer with a few tabs. Open a file with emacs, start a huge download, etc. Detach the multiplexer, logout of ssh, go to work. Reattach your session and resume work right where you left it: emacs stayed open, your download continued while you drove to work.\n\n*Start writing your research paper (in LaTeX of course ;) on your desktop. Realise it's far too nice a day to be sitting indoors. Reattach the multiplexer session on your lappy outside and continue working.\n\nA: right click on mouse and select open tab.\n\n\nA: Check out Terminator as well. It's in the repo's\n\n\nA: There a Terminal Quicklist that has the option to open new tab. \nAlthough it's not a new tab you can use the middle mouse on the launcher to open a new terminal.\nI would also recommend you look into Tmux as this is a great tool for working in a single terminal screen. For example it will keep your session running after you logout from remote servers.\n\nA: mssh - simple and effective, allows one to issue the same commands to all windows, i.e. to each ssh session.\n", "Q: What resolution works best? I want to buy a laptop and install Ubuntu 11 on it. Is there a particular screen resolution or dimension that is ideal?\nFor example, if I'm choosing between 1600 x 900 or 1680 x 1050, these have different ratios of height to width, and the second is (as far as I know) a less common resolution.\nWill any of these things matter, or are all resolutions that a major retailer sells be supported seamlessly?\nPart of the reason for my question is that I had a little trouble with Ubuntu 9 on a monitor with a 4:3 ratio.\n\nA: I think it depends more on the graphics card and the drivers.\nYou are able to use 11.04 without problems as long as the resolution is higher than 1024x768.(I prefer 1280x800 or higher)\n", "Q: Modifying mouse/touchpad sensitivity I would like to increase my mouse sensitivity. Going to system settings->mouse and adjusting the sensitivity doesn't seem to affect anything. In the previous version I modified it in the advanced system settings by manually inputting the threshold and acceleration but I can no longer find that menu. \nIdeally I want to have a constant acceleration with high sensitivity, is this possible in Ubuntu? \nI have searched for hours and was unable to find any relevant answers. Almost everything I have come across mentions the xorg.conf which no longer exists.\nHelp would be much appreciated, thanks!\n\nA: Try Pointing Devices\nsudo apt-get install gpointing-device-settings\n\nIt contains a nice GUI for changing touchpad settings like sensitivity, min/max speeds and palm detection.\n\nA: I was having the same problem until I found this nifty program called configure-trackpoint. Download the file from sourceforge.  Open a terminal and type in:\nsudo apt-get install sysfsutils\n\nThen go back to the file you downloaded and install it.  After installing it, go to your terminal and type in:\nsudo configure-trackpoint\n\na GUI should open up and you can use it to adjust your trackpoint settings.  \nHope this helps!\n\nA: Copy and paste this into Terminal, then hit Enter:\nxset m 50 1\n\n", "Q: Firefox global menu bookmarks no middle/right click? I wanted to ask if this was a feature or bug before I submitted a bug report. Before Unity/global menu, you could open bookmarks in a new tab by middle clicking or right click \"open in new tab\". In Natty, this opens the bookmark in the current tab only. Can anyone confirm this?\n\nA: This is a known (wishlist) bug. You may want to subscribe to it to get updated on its status.\n", "Q: Should I use the Nouveau Gallium 3D driver? Does the Nouveau 3D driver works with Ubuntu Natty Narwhal? \nWhat are the drawbacks of using this driver, i.e. is there any chance of breaking the desktop using this driver? \nThe Nvidia driver will not install and I can only use Unity 2D.\nThank you.\n\nA: It's easy to test, just install the package\nlibgl1-mesa-dri-experimental\n\nIf for whatever reason it doesn't work, boot into recovery mode (press and hold the Shift key when powering on the system to get the GRUB menu, then choose the recovery entry), select Drop to a root shell prompt and run:\napt-get purge libgl1-mesa-dri-experimental\n\nThe drawback: its performance isn't on par with Nvidia's binary driver, but even with old cards it should be enough to run Compiz/Unity (given that there are no compatibility issues).\n\nA: Did it work in ubuntu, Fedora 16 uses the Gallium 0.4 on NV46 for my Nvidia 7400 card in gnome 3 and it works perfekt here! \n", "Q: Accidentally deleted \"linux-image-generic\" - how do I recover? Well I tell you that my problem started when upgrading to Ubuntu 11.04. As it happened to me when I updated Ubuntu 10.04 to 10.10, every time I installed something, I got an error when reading \"linux-image-generic\". That time I solved it by installing a software, called Ubuntu Tweak, with which  I deleted all temporary files and old installation packages, and I don't know very well why, but it worked and the problem stopped.\nThis time I tried to do otherwise, and follow the steps that they said in this thread:\ninitramfs problem when out of disk space\nWell, I purged those files and  after restarting it tells me:\nERROR 15: FILE NOT FOUND\nPress any key to continue ...\n\nAnd that gives me to choose between:\n10.04.1 Ubuntu LTS, Karel-24-generic 06/02/1932\n\n10.04.1 Ubuntu LTS, Karel 06.02.1932-24-generic (Recovered)\n\nAny of which leads me back to the Error 15 again.\nI started from my old Windows partition and using Ext2fsd to read the Linux partition, I could retrieve the file where I had copied the error log that I had when updating.

When I upgrade from one version of Ubuntu to the next, the upgrade tool rightly disables all my PPAs, so that software compiled for or otherwise tied to the old version of Ubuntu does not interfere with the new version that I just upgraded to.\nIs there any way to automatically re-enable and update any PPAs that provide packages for the new version of Ubuntu? For example, suppose I'm currently running Maverick, and I have two PPAs enabled, \"foo\" and \"bar\". Suppose that \"foo\" provides packages for both Maverick and Natty, while \"bar\" provides packages for Natty only. Is there a tool I could run after updating to Natty that would re-enable my \"foo\" PPA and update it to point to the Natty packages, while leaving the \"bar\" PPA disabled?\n\nA: There is a tool called Y-PPA-Manager that lets you do exactly that.\nTo try Y-PPA-Manager, you need to run the following commands in a terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/y-ppa-manager\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install y-ppa-manager\n\nAfter installing, run the software and click on 'Advanced' button. \n\nAfter clicking on that button, you would come up with a window similar to the one below. Click on 'Re-enable working PPAs after Ubuntu upgrade'. \n\nYou would then be prompted for your password. Enter your password and click OK. After that, you would get a dialog box like this:\n\nClick OK and wait till all the working PPAs are re-enabled. When the entire process is successfully completed, you would be notified.\n\nA: There is an intriguing simple command as you can now keep PPAs and Third Party Repositories enabled when upgrading to a newer Ubuntu version:\nRELEASE_UPGRADER_ALLOW_THIRD_PARTY=1 do-release-upgrade -d\n\nThe RELEASE_UPGRADER_ALLOW_THIRD_PARTY environment variable can be used with both the command line and the GUI upgrade tools. So when you want to upgrade your Ubuntu system and keep PPA and third party repositories enabled, run the upgrade from a terminal, like mentioned above for the command version. I guess BEFORE the actual system upgrading. For the GUI version:\nRELEASE_UPGRADER_ALLOW_THIRD_PARTY=1 update-manager -d\n\n(-d is used to allow upgrading to development releases - for example to upgrade from Ubuntu 18.10 to 19.04 right now, while Ubuntu 19.04 Disco Dingo is still in development)\nIt's worth noting that you may still see a warning about third party sources being disabled on upgrade, but those that support the Ubuntu version to which you're upgrading will not be disabled.\nA regular Ubuntu release upgrade (to a newer Ubuntu version) disables any PPA or third party repository that may be enabled.\nSome recent changes to ubuntu-release-upgrader allow keeping PPA and third party repositories enabled when upgrading to a newer Ubuntu release, while also providing better support for cases in which the users have their own mirror of the archive. This is done by using an environment variable, RELEASE_UPGRADER_ALLOW_THIRD_PARTY.\nSource: Linux Uprising Blog and Brian’s Blog\nI only found this solution after the upgrade and ran the command anyway, it added a new entry for each PPA with the new Ubuntu version's name in it. I just had to delete the old ones then.\n", "Q: How do I  remap command key to be the control key on a Macbook 4,1? How I can switch the left command key on the keyboard of my macbook, with the left ctrl key?\nand if it is possible that the command right, continue acting like the super key / windows\n\nA: A quick way to do this would be to goto System -> Preferences -> Keyboard -> Layouts tab -> Options -> Alt/Win key behavior -> select Win key as control\nViola!\nBut of course there is no Win key on a Mac.\n\nA: For anyone using KDE, check under System Settings > Input Devices > Keyboard > Advanced.  You'll need to enable \"Configure keyboard options\", open up \"Alt/Win key behavior\", then check \"Ctrl is mapped to Win keys (and the usual Ctrl keys)\". There is an identical setting for Alt mapping to the Win keys if you'd prefer the Control key be Alt.\n\nA: Try this:\ncat > ~/.xmodmaprc\n! Erase existing bindings\nclear Control\nclear Mod4\n! Map key 37 (left ctrl) to Super_L (i.e. 'cmd')\nkeycode  37 = Super_L\n! Map key 133 (left cmd) to Control_L (i.e. 'ctrl)\nkeycode 133 = Control_L\n! And update modifier settings\nadd control = Control_L\nadd mod4    = Super_L\n\nTo end the input, press Ctrl+D.\nTo test you can run:\nxmodmap ~/.xmodmaprc\n\nFinally, you should add this command to startup applications.\nThis should get you started. If this does not quite work for you, checkout this for more info:\nman xmodmap\n\nTo watch which key press corresponds to which internal keycode, run\nxev\n\nand press some keys when the little white window has the focus. The keycodes won't change (133 will always be 133, but you should see the name of 133 before as Control_L and after this procedure, after you log in again, it should be Super_L.\n", "Q: How do I get my windows controls back?

I guess BURG will require more time to start, because it displays some eye-candy graphics. If I replaced GRUB with BURG, would the time required to boot into Ubuntu be significantly longer?\n\nA: I use burg since 1 year. It works well and I have never noticed a difference in boot time between grub and burg. \n\nA: Disclaimer: I havent tried out BURG.\nGoogling for Burg tells me that it is only a decorator for GRUB. That said, it will not do anything to change how your computer boots. So, coming back to your question, IMO, the time required for booting will not increase. Since burg only decorates GRUB, you might face a tiny lag before viewing BURG, but I reckon it wont me something you will notice.\n", "Q: How do I boot a minimal CD ISO from a USB stick and use a wireless driver I am trying to install Ubuntu 11 x64 minimal but I found that I dont have a wired ethernet connection (its broken) but I can possibly connect wirelessly.\nIs it possible to use the minimal CD image and add the wireless driver?\nIn addition, I dont have an external CD Drive - will I be able to boot the minimal CD ISO from a USB drive?\nWireless is Intel Wireless WiFi Link 4965AGN\n\nA: The minimal CD ISO cannot be installed via the StartUp Disk Creator that comes as standard with Ubuntu.\nHowever, you can download and install unetbootin from the software centre and install the minimal CD as per this picture\n\nIf the installation doesnt work because the wireless is not recognised, my recommendation would be to buy a USB-to-RJ45 adapter to fix - hopefully the limited kernel that comes with the minimal CD will recognise this adapter.

After installation I run update manager and usually if there is something new on my system it downloads language pack and everything is OK but in that case it didn't. It's not a problem to use english version but it would be just nicer to have everything in the same language. Any suggestions?\n\nA: It may be that this application has simply not yet been translated into your language. As you see in the global Ubuntu 'Translations overview', there is still some work to be done for Natty. ;) https://translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu\nNormally all software you install will change its language and 'follow' the users choice.

Then I think ubuntu-desktop will not just include the desktop but other bloat too? How can I just get the GUI, plus all the required stuff like apt-get, perhaps software center etc?\n\nA: Well, a lot of the potential bloat in the ubuntu-desktop meta package are listed as Recommends. Hence you could try installing the page with only its hard dependencies using the following apt-get command:\nsudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends ubuntu-desktop\n\nYou can see the list of Dependencies vs. Recommends at https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/ubuntu-desktop\nYou can also get that information from this apt-cache command:\napt-cache show ubuntu-desktop\n\n\nA: Now you can install it with ubuntu-desktop-minimal package:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop-minimal\n\n\nA: I have detailed the steps for both a GNOME3 & Standard Gnome2 minimal install - skip to the bottom for these details\nIt quite unusual to have a Server with the desktop installation.  If you want a light administrator only installation then you can install WebMin - a web-base administration tool.\nIf you want a clean minimal desktop installation, use the Minimal Ubuntu install CD and follow a good recommended guide such as this.\n\nRemember, the minimal CD is a CD + Internet solution.  You will not be able to use a USB stick to install it using StartUp Disk Creator - however you could use UNetBootin as per this AU answer.\nGuideline for using a virtual guest to customise your minimal install\nMy recommendation to you is to use the power of a VirtualBox virtual image installation using the minimal CD ISO.\nThe big advantage of using this virtual solution, is that you can use the Snapshot technology of VirtualBox to test various installs and customisations - if you dont like what you may have done, you can rollback quickly and easily without having to do a complete reinstall.\nI believe that your Intel wireless is recognised without any additional drivers - correct?  If so, you dont need to download any extra driver files at this point.\nIf you know that you need extra drivers to get your physical computer to work, download the correct .deb files into your virtual guest - you can install these later when the virtual guest is transferred onto your physical computer.\nWhen creating the virtual machine, make sure that the \"dynamic sizing\" virtual hard-disk size is smaller that of the physical machine hard-disk you will be transferring it to.\nWhen selecting the packages to install, use \"gdm\" and ubuntu-desktop together with the suggested --no-install-recommends option as per the psycocats web-page example above.\nGuidelines on how to transfer a virtual image to physical computer\nWhen you have finished the customisation you will be ready to transfer to the physical computer.\nOne of my favourite solutions is to use Clonezilla.  \nDownload the Clonezilla ISO and connect it to your VirtualBox guest.  Restart and boot the guest machine into Clonezilla.  See this link for screenshots how to use Clonezilla. \nHave a USB external drive/USB stick so that you can save the image.  Note - use the disk imaging solution, not disk partition.  If you use disk partitioning, you will need to separately install Grub2 using a live CD.\nChoose the Clonezilla option \"local-dev\" i.e. to save the image to the local drive or USB stick.  At this point, plugin your external USB drive/USB stick and use the VirtualBox Devices option to connect to the USB device.  You will then see Clonezilla recognise the USB drive by sum output appearing on the virtual guest screen.\nThe usb drive is recognised as /dev/sdb1.  Choose this as the Clonezilla repository.\nFollow the prompts, your virtual disk image will be saved as a .img file onto your USB drive.  Shutdown the virtual guest.\nGet another usb stick and use the Startup Disk Creator] or UNetbootin to create a bootable version of Clonezilla.\nOn the computer you will be transferring the image to, connect the Clonezilla USB stick and boot from it.\nWhen you've chosen the option to restore from an image, plugin your second USB stick containing the saved Clonezilla image of the virtual guest. Restore from that usb hard-drive.\nDetailed Steps to create a minimal install\nCreate a virtual guest and attached the mini.iso downloaded.\nEdit Settings - change display to Enable 3D Acceleration and 128Mb Video RAM\nUse the psycocats method to install from the minimal CD\nSHIFT and boot using recovery mode - use option \"resume\"\nlog in\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install xorg xterm gdm ubuntu-desktop menu firefox gksu synaptic --no-install-recommends\n\nif you want a truly minimal install try the following lines instead of the above\nsudo apt-get install xorg xterm gdm menu gksu synaptic --no-install-recommends\nsudo apt-get install gnome-session gnome-panel metacity gnome-terminal --no-install-recommends\n\nThen start the graphical interface\nsudo service gdm start\n\nChoose Session \"Ubuntu Classic\" and log in\nNow - if you want to install Gnome3 continue\nChoose Accessories - terminal\nsudo apt-get install python-software-properties\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell --no-install-recommends\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nSince I wasnt going to transfer at this stage to my physical PC, you need to install the VBoxGuestAdditions so that Gnome3 could display correctly.\nTherefore use VirtualBox to \"Edit - Install Guest Additions\", then\nsudo mkdir /media/cdrom\nsudo mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom\ncd /media/cdrom\nsudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\n\nsudo reboot --\n\nChoose the gnome3 desktop session before you log in.\n\nA: Download and extract the ubuntu-desktop deb and remove package dependencies you don't want.  Then rebuild it as a new package.  Make sure all dependencies are >= not =.  \nMake your own deb sounds a little snarky, but so does \"bloat\".  Which is a completely innocuous and inconsistent term.  Your definition of bloat will be different than mine.  \nIf you really want a minimalist desktop you could try out flux or something along those lines and synaptic instead of software manager.\n", "Q: Syncing much faster on 11.04 than in 10.10 I am using two computers, one with Ubuntu 10.10 and one with 11.04. The computer with Ubuntu 11.04 is syncing files very fast with Ubuntu One. The computer with 10.10 installed takes forever. Is there any way I can speed up syncing with Ubuntu One on my 10.10 computer?\n\nA: We've made a lot of improvements to file sync speed that landed in 11.04; we'll be making those changes available to everything back to 10.04 in a few months' time.\n", "Q: How to add dockbarx (gnome) panel applet to unity panel? just would like to know if that would be possible because i get used to it in gnome, but would like to use unity, not gnome because unity is more stable on my thinkpad x220.\nThanks!\n\nA: The latest version of DocBarX supports both gnome-panel and AWN (see this article).\nThus if you install AWN together with the latest DocBarX from the PPA then this should work very nicely with the Unity Interface.\nAn alternative would be to add the Gnome Panel to the Unity Interface and add DocBarX as usual to the Gnome Panel.\n\nA: You cannot use Dockbarx in Unity itself, because Dockbarx is neither a notification area application nor an application indicator. It is essentially a dock or taskbar, and is to be used either alone, in the GNOME-Panel (GNOME2 only currently) or AWN.\n\nA: It is not possible to add those types of applets to the Unity panel. However, as others have pointed out, you can install Gnome Panel and run it at the bottom of your screen, which will give you a similar layout as we've had before, except you also get the new niceties from Unity. You will get a conflict with Alt+f2 since Gnome Panel provides its own dialog for that, but I think it should be easy to get used to. \nHowever, there is a large problem with Gnome Panel; it's been deprecated. From 11.10 and onwards, it will no longer be available. Luckily, the XFCE project provides another Panel which works similarly to Gnome Panel. (It's much better in my opinion) and it's actively developed, so it'll be available in the future. Xfce4-panel also supports Gnome Panel applets if you also install xfce4-xfapplet-plugin. (You'll add the XFApplet plugin to the panel).\nI think I would recommend that you at least investigate this if you're going to use Gnome panel applets with Unity. \n", "Q: Removing dual boot with 11.04 upgrade I am using a dual boot set up with ubuntu 10.10 and windows xp. \nI would like to bin windows completely and use only ubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I remove the windows xp partition while upgrading from 10.10 \nor\n\n*Do I have to upgrade using a cd and lose all my files. (I have got them backed up) \n\nA: If you dont want any files in xp you can just format the Windows XP partition and run sudo update-grub and upgrade Ubuntu using update manager\n\nA: Update Manager will offer you the chance to upgrade from 10.10 to 11.04.  This will upgrade your existing ubuntu installation and will not affect your existing windows installation.\nYou can remove your windows xp installation by booting from any Live CD and running the Disk Administrator utility or GParted.  You can see the NTFS windows XP partition and choose to delete the NTFS partition.  When you have done that, you can then resize the existing ext4 partition holding your Ubuntu installation to utilise the extra disk space.\n\nA: It sounds like you have some data files on your current Windows' partition.  Why not copy them to a separate data partition (e.g. drive d:) and leave this partition in place when you install Ubuntu?  That way, the data files will always be available, even if you replace Ubuntu 10.10 with 11.04, or a different future version of Ubuntu.  I would suggest that it makes sense to separate the operating system and data file partitions specifically for this purpose.  It also makes it much easier to back up the data. \n", "Q: Freeze when moving mouse to bottom right corner of screen since Ati Catalyst 11.5 Today i upgraded from ATI Catalyst 11.4 beta to 11.5.

I have seen people claim using w32codecs is piracy. \n\nA: Installing IE6 on Ubuntu is legal - as long as you have a valid Windows Licence.

I had this problem with Unity, as well. No problem with earlier version and than upgraded to Unity.\nPlease advise.\n\nA: After months of attempts to fix this, I've finally found one that works for Kubuntu 11.04 (Natty). The problem is that Kubuntu (and I believe KDE more generally) starts the shutdown process in a way different than Gnome/Ubuntu, so even the dbus / netbase fixes and using autofs that I've seen proposed in different forums all didn't work. I think KDE begins shutting down userspace functions like network manager first before the /etc/init scripts or /home/user/.kde/shutdown scripts are called upon. Just speculation on my part, but that'd be my guess.\nBut I apparently found the place where Kubuntu actually starts the shutdown process, or close to it - it's in the /usr/bin/starkde script. Immediately after the line saying \"echo 'startkde: Shutting down...' 1>&2\", I inserted a line saying \"sudo umount -t cifs -a -f -l\". Then, using visudo as root (\"sudo visudo\"), I edited the sudoers file to allow the sudo command to execute umount without a password by adding the line (at the bottom of the file) \"username ALL=(root) NOPASSWD:/bin/umount\". Worked like a charm.\n\nA: I have a similar problem, but I've noticed it only happens when I'm at the office. Some digging has produced a 4 year old bug in CIFS that causes a 5 minute hang at shutdown when the network is disabled before CIFS mounts can be unmounted.\nI'll do some more checking but if you are mounting SAMBA or other shares over a network using CIFS or SMBFS this might be why you can't shutdown properly.\nTry running the following command before shutdown to see if it has any effect.\nsudo umount -a\n\nOnce I find a reliable way to automate this command I'll post it here\nEDIT:\nOops forgot to add links\nNew detailed bug report\nAncient undead bug report with more posts than you can shake a bone at\nAlso note that I had issues with shutdown earlier this year due to Plymouth not being update correctly (my fault, I copied files as root where I shouldn't have) so if this doesn't solve your problem, give some more detail so we can try and help you out.\n", "Q: Windows Boot Manager: Make Ubuntu the default instead of Windows When I boot my computer, I get the Windows Boot Manager with Vista selected and Ubuntu as the other item in the list.\nIf I choose Ubuntu, I get the GRUB menu. I have updated GRUB menus before so I know how that works, but since Windows Boot Manager comes first, I don't know how to change the default.\nI looked at this question: How do I make Windows 7 the default OS instead of ubuntu?\nBut it seems that that uses GRUB, but the default I want to change is before GRUB even comes up.

Is this possible?\nIf I cannot do that, is it possible to \"pin\" windows so they are visible on all workspaces?\n\nA: Some advanced window managers (eg. xmonad) make it possible to assign workspaces to individual screens independently. But if you prefer to stick to Unity and Compiz, just right-click on the top bar of a window and select \"Always on Visible Workspace\". (You have to unmaximize the window first.) \n", "Q: Decrease GRUB timeout The GRUB timeout is 8 seconds. Can this be turned down to 2 or 3 seconds? What is the best way to do this?\n\nA: Not sure if I have a complete answer as I have a few more questions.\nFirst - Permissions: you would normally need sudo to edit grub.cfg. If I'm editing from the commandline, I like nano, which is installed by default, so I would use\n$ sudo nano /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nIf you haven't used nano before, once you're done editing use Ctl-O (the letter) to save and then Ctl-X to exit (the Ctl-O is optional, Ctl-X will prompt if there were changes)\nSecond - Grub: Editing /boot/grub/grub.cfg is probably not the way to go. Grub2 uses the file /etc/default/grub to get all its options and then generates grub.cfg for you. This is important, because grub.cfg gets updated when there's a kernel update or other things that might affect grub. So if you want your changes to stick you need to edit /etc/default/grub.\n$ sudo nano /etc/default/grub\n$ sudo update-grub2\n\nMore on grub here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/\nREMEMBER TO MAKE A BACKUP BEFORE YOU CHANGE SYSTEM FILES :D\nThird - 10s wait: I'm not actually sure that grub is your villain here, but hopefully the above will help you figure out if it is. Alternatively, can you elaborate a little more. Are you in the grub menu when you \"select Ubuntu to boot?\" what happens once you've selected it?

But you can find it here at Launchpad:\nGrub Customizer\nOnce installed, boot into Ubuntu, start Grub Customizer and configure it for 0 countdown. Then when you boot there should be no wait.\n\nA: for this you have to change the value of GRUB_TIMEOUT value to 2 or 3 .\n1 - go to super mode \n\nsu - \n\nfollowed by typing your root password\n2- now open the GRUB.cfg file either in vi editor or Gedit (Gedit is easy (GUI))\n\nvi /boot/grub2/grub.cfg\n\nor \n\ngedit /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\n3 - then find GRUB_TIMEOUT and change it's value 2 or 3 \n4 - save the changes \n5 - if find any difficulty then watch my video on youtube . \nclick here to watch the video\n\nA: The timeout behaviour is different on systems with EFI and BIOS.

But since the separate partition has't been opened yet, Dropbox complains that my Dropbox folder is missing. So Ihave to close Dropbox, make sure my separate partition is mounted, then load Dropbox again. \nIs there a way to auto-mount my drive before Dropbox loads on startup?\n\nA: Yeah.\nYou would need to mount your partition when your system starts.\nFor detailed guide refer Automatically Mount Partitions in Ubuntu.\nIf your have external NTFS partition then ntfs-config will ease your task and let you mount all ntfs partitions easily. To install ntfs-config, open terminal and type;\nsudo apt-get install ntfs-config\n\n\nA: I edited the /etc/fstab file.\nStep 1. List your partitions by UUID:\nsudo blkid\n\nStep 2. Edit /etc/fstab file.\nTo edit the file directly in terminal, run:\nsudo nano -Bw /etc/fstab\n\nStep 3. Insert an extra line in fstab; the line should look like:\nUUID=\"01CE8D75DCC82F80\"    /media/G-Drive    ntfs  rw,auto,user,fmask=0111,dmask=0000   0     0\n\nYou will have to replace 01CE8D75DCC82F80 with your UUID.\nYou will have to replace /media/G-Drive with the location where you want to mount.\nYou might want to change ntfs if your partition is a different type.\nIf you change ntfs than you might have to change options as well (rw,auto,user,fmask=0111,dmask=0000 gives anybody access to this NTFS partition).\nStep 4. Restart and keep fingers crossed, if \"Drobox Unlink-ed message\" not shown than you have been successful.\n\nA: You can edit your /etc/fstab file to add whichever partition you need.\nYou can find the wiki here.\n\nA: Got this idea from @Thomas Kainrad's comment\nYou can delay the startup of Dropbox so the drive has time to mount.  First you need to disable Dropbox's option to load at startup:\n\nThen add your own startup entry for Dropbox but add the X-GNOME-Autostart-Delay parameter and set it to the number of seconds you'd like to delay.\nSave this under ~/.config/autostart/sleepy-dropbox.desktop\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=dropbox start -i\nHidden=false\nNoDisplay=false\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\nX-GNOME-Autostart-Delay=2\nName[en_US]=My Sleepy Dropbox\nName=My Sleepy Dropbox\nComment[en_US]=Custom command for starting dropbox due to drive not being mounted yet\nComment=Custom command for starting dropbox due to drive not being mounted yet\n\n\nA: Another way of doing this would be using a startup script. This way you could avoid mounting a partition globally if for some reason that's not what you wanna do.\nThis would be a very simple way of doing it:\n#!/bin/bash\nudisks --mount /dev/<your partition> && dropbox start -i\n\nYou will need to make sure to uncheck the \"Start Dropbox on system startup\" checkbox in your Dropbox prefernces and of course add the startup script as startup application.\n\nA: For some reason I had to tweak @elemer82 answear to make it work with my ext4 partition. I put it here for the record.\nYou may not need the UUID: in my case I just used /dev/sda in my /etc/fstab.\nSo I just did:\nsudo nano -Bw /etc/fstab\n\nAnd entered the following line (I added the header here for clarity): \n# <file system>  <mount point>          <type>  <options>   <dump>  <pass> \n/dev/sda         /media/edelans/data1    ext4    defaults     0       2\n\nYou can check the doc of fstap for more details about the options. The defaults options were all I needed for a data partition where I put my dropbox folder. (Note that it's an ext4 partition, only accessed by ubuntu, no windows dualboot here). \n\nA: I just did what @edelans said but it crashed my GUI. I actually had to mix it with @elemer82's solution.\nUsing sudo blkid allowed be me realize that my HDD was not on /dev/sda but on /dev/sdb1 instead.\nI just had to change that in @edelans's solution and everything works. Dropbox and Copy now start normally without error.\n\nA: For a GUI solution: install Disks (aka Gmome Disks):\nsudo apt-get install gnome-disk-utility\n\nEven in KDE it brings no supplementary dependencies.\nStart Disks, select the partition, then select \"Additional partition options\" - \"Edit mount options\".\n\nOn the next window uncheck User Session Defaults, check \"Mount at system startup\" and set the mount point.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu On Windows Without Internet I tried to use Wubi, but there is no option to choose the ISO image or anything like that.

I'm trying to setup and install Ubuntu on a RAID 1 setup. I have two disks, sdb and sdc. I've been following this guide\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SoftwareRAID\nwhich more or less works for getting everything set up and Ubuntu installed. The problem is at the end of the installation, it tries to install GRUB. By default it tries my \"first disk\", which gives a \"fatal error\". I've tried installing it on a specific partion, e.g. sdb1 as well as RAID devices, e.g. md0, md1, etc.. Nothing seems to work.\nThe actual error is\n\nUnable to install GRUB in /dev/sdb\nExecuting 'grub-install '/dev/sdb' failed.\nThis is a fatal error.\n\nThen I'm taken back to the main install menu. If I choose \"Install the GRUB boot loader on a hard disk\" option, I can pick the partition, but entering sdb2 or md1 gives the same error.\nSo I went ahead an just didn't install GRUB, which means now I presumably have a working Ubuntu installation, but I can't boot it. I've tried booting from the LiveCD to install GRUB, but I can't chroot into my system because it doesn't seem to recognize that my disk is a Linux disk. There's an error about it being a RAID partition.\nSo basically I would really like to know how you know to which device to install GRUB at installation, or at the very least, how to install it on to my system now.\nI suppose I should also mention that sda is a Windows 7 installation that I would like to keep around and be able to access at boot.\nThanks for any help.\n\nA: A slight variation on @root45's recipe got me going (on an Ubuntu-only system). I didn't make the bootable partition part of the Raid array.\nI created a small bootable GRUB partition (I chose the partition editor's option: \"use is 'bootgrub'\" or something similar) and did not make it part of the Raid device along with the  swap and data (/) partitions. \nYou can rewrite the Grub2 data to the 'bootgrub' partition at any time .... as indeed the installation process will, on your behalf, when given the choice after all your selected packages have been installed;  or at any time later if corrupted with grub-install /dev/sda changing the 'sda' to the device of the partition you used in 'step one' above to be 'used as \"bootgrub\"'.\nIf you choose to cause the installing  of the many packages in a LAMP server, for example, it can be quite a while after partitioning before you get asked about writing the Grub2 data to the hard disk ... and the defaults it offered at that time caused an error until I supplied my \"bootgrub\" partition's device ... and all went OK and I have a viable system now.\n\nA: My problem turned out to be that I had GUID partition table since my drives were 2TB each. The method I originally tried to follow didn't assume this, and so installing GRUB didn't work.\nInstead, you should make a small (1MB) partition on each disk and RAID them together and set it as a GRUB boot partition (I'm not sure of the actual name). Set up your other RAID partitions (e.g. swap and /) and then the GRUB installer should find the boot area just fine.\n(On Debian this is called a reserved BIOS boot area.)\n\nA: Many of the answers here are just plain incorrect, telling you to disable BIOS RAID! The correct solution is at this blog entry. I'll summarize it below.\nAt the stage of the install where it is attempting to install GRUB it will detect as\n/dev/mapper\n\nThis is incomplete! That's why the GRUB install fails.\nYou need the actual name of the RAID array to install to. So during that step, press ctrl+alt+F2 to drop to a busybox terminal, then enter\nls -l /dev/mapper\n\nPick out the name of your array from the list shown, then press ctrl+alt+F1 to switch back to the install (you can switch back and forth as much as you like with no problems) and enter it in the field as\n/dev/mapper/{your array name}  \n\nthen GRUB installs perfectly and you're ready to go, with a proper BIOS RAID array intact. \n\nA: I can't help with installing grub now but what i did to get my RAID running is i followed this instruction: \nHow To Install Ubuntu 8.04 With Software RAID1 | HowtoForge - Linux Howtos and Tutorials and install grub on every raid partition (not swap). \nThis will be helpful when one HDD fails there's still a working grub.\n", "Q: position of window control buttons can we have unity move the max/min/close buttons to the right?\nWhen the window is not maximized, Metacity takes control of the window, therefore we can use gconf-editor to force the traditional min/max/close right style buttons.\nHowever, when Compiz takes control (maximized), it's back to Ubuntu style.\nAny way to make Compiz obey gconf-editor or an option in the Unity plugin?\n\nA: No, unity doesn't follow these gconf rules, and in fact there is a different decorator being used (it doesn't draw the window controls in the unity panel).\nThis is an often requested feature though.\nSee these questions for more details:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I make the window buttons in the panel match the window buttons in the window decorations?\n\n*Can the Close / Minimize / Maximize buttons be pulled out of the Global App Menu when a window is maximized?\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/775346\n", "Q: How can I specify a more appropriate font substitution?

I use the arrows a lot, and I also use the home and end buttons, but why jump to a whole new button? My left hand is already near the fn (function) key - ready to press control or shift.\nHow do I set this?\nThanks.\n\nA: I definitely understand why you want to do this! Here's my bet what I have done:\nLaunch a terminal and run 'xev'. Place your mouse cursor over the Event Tester window and press fn+right/left.

Close all your terminals, open one, and you should be ready to go!\nNow, there is one draw-back: you have to activate this on every boot. You do that by opening a terminal, and that's it. You can close it again immediately. Or you can try fixing it to do it automatically, as described here. I just run the terminal using a shortcut and then kill it...\n\nA: If you have Ubuntu+Gnome and xev does not show anything when you type Fn+Left or Fn+Right - than you might have an interceptor in Gnome session like I did. Also my hardware laptop keyboard shows \"backward\" and \"forward\" player/music icons for left and right buttons - it means my hardware keyboard sends keycode 173 for Fn+Left and keycode 171 for Fn+Right.\nDisable gnome session listeners\nYou can disable listeners with UI dconf-editor.\nInstall and run dconf-editor.\nGo to the following paths and disable Use default value and put empty array [] in Custom value.\nFor Fn+Left:\n/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/previous-static.\nFor Fn+Right:\n/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/next-static\nApply changes for both paths and close dconf-editor.\nApply software buttons mapping with xmodmap\nNow apply custom handler for Fn+Left:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 171 = End\"\n\nBefore this setting it was for me xmodmap -pk | grep -i '171':\n171     0x1008ff17 (XF86AudioNext)  0x0000 (NoSymbol)   0x1008ff17 (XF86AudioNext)  0x0000 (NoSymbol)   0x1008ff17 (XF86AudioNext)\n\nAfter this setting:\n171     0xff57 (End)    0x0000 (NoSymbol)   0xff57 (End)    0x0000 (NoSymbol)   0xff57 (End)\n\nApply custom handler for Fn+Right:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 173 = Home\"\n\nBefore xmodmap -pk | grep -i '173':\n173     0x1008ff16 (XF86AudioPrev)  0x0000 (NoSymbol)   0x1008ff16 (XF86AudioPrev)  0x0000 (NoSymbol)   0x1008ff16 (XF86AudioPrev)\n\nAfter:\n173     0xff50 (Home)   0x0000 (NoSymbol)   0xff50 (Home)   0x0000 (NoSymbol)   0xff50 (Home)\n\nNow it works for me. However the result is not permanent, after reboot you have to do this again. Some startups scripts to do this do not work nice, because xmodmap must be initialized only after some time (when it is ready).\nApply software buttons mapping with xkb\nTurns out that xmodmap is outdated and not used anymore in Gnome.\nPermanent solution is to use xkb.\nCreate symbol file fn_mod at /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/ (sudo requires) with following content:\n// /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/inet\n// key <I171>   {      [ XF86AudioNext         ]       };\n// key <I173>   {      [ XF86AudioPrev         ]       };\n//\n// /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc\n// key <HOME> { [  Home         ]   };\n// key  <END> { [  End          ]   };\n//\n// make Fn+Left (keycode 171) act as Home\npartial modifier_keys\nxkb_symbols \"left_as_home\" {\n    key <I171> { [ End ] };\n};\n\n// make Fn+Right (keycode 173) act as End\npartial modifier_keys\nxkb_symbols \"right_as_end\" {\n    key <I173> { [ Home ] };\n};\n\nMake backup for following files in case you will brake them:\n/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml\n/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev\n/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.lst\n\nAdd following content into evdev.xml (<xkbConfigRegistry> -> <optionList> ->):\n    <group allowMultipleSelection=\"true\">\n      <configItem>\n        <name>fn_mod</name>\n        <description>Fn key behavior</description>\n      </configItem>\n      <option>\n        <configItem>\n          <name>fn_mod:left_as_home</name>\n          <description>Fn+Left (aka XF86AudioPrev) act as Home</description>\n        </configItem>\n      </option>\n      <option>\n        <configItem>\n          <name>fn_mod:right_as_end</name>\n          <description>Fn+Right (aka XF86AudioNext) act as End</description>\n        </configItem>\n      </option>\n    </group>\n\nAdd following content into evdev (Find line ! option =   symbols and append on the next line):\n  fn_mod:left_as_home  = +fn_mod(left_as_home)\n  fn_mod:right_as_end  = +fn_mod(right_as_end)\n\nAdd following content into evdev.lst (Find line ! option and append on the next line):\n  fn_mod               Fn key behavior\n  fn_mod:left_as_home  Fn+Left (aka XF86AudioPrev) act as Home\n  fn_mod:right_as_end  Fn+Right (aka XF86AudioNext) act as End\n\nevdev.xml changes will create UI tweak in gnome-tweaks.

I have a local network of 80 machines, all with Ubuntu 10.04 installed on them. All the machines are connected to a central switch.\nI have some contractors that are located overseas. I would like to dedicate each of them a single machine, so that all the work they do will be performed on one of my 'local' machines (through remote access).\nIdeally, I'd prefer a secure solution (VPN?) that will allow each of the users to securely connect to a remote machine, view 'X' (meaning, be able to open programs like Evolution, send emails, write documents using Open Office etc) and also open a terminal, run scripts etc. Ideally, the solution should be fast (meaning, I don't want a long delay between every punch on their keyboard to when their screen gets updated) and secure.\nI should also have the ability to access the machine they're working on and block their access, in case they're doing something they're not supposed to do.\nIs it easy to handle / setup? any idea what the costs are?\n\nA: The simplest thing to do (requires almost no set-up) is just using SSH to tunnel X connections.  SSH can forward your local computer's x-server connection to the remote computer.  That way you can run a program on a remote computer but display it's windows locally.  The performance isn't too great though.  If your contractors are using Windows then they'll need to download Putty and Xming. You can also tunnel VNC over SSH if they have a VNC client, but VNC's performance is even worse.\nIf you want to minimize the time you are paying your contractors to look a loading screens then you'll probably want to use NX.  While X works remotely it's not optimized for non LAN networks.  NX fixes this by using compression and getting rid of redundant Xlib calls.\nWhile the NX client is free, NoMachine's NX-server isn't.  Luckily, if you don't mind a little work, you can use Google's NX-server NeatX. NX uses SSH tunneling behind the scenes so it is as secure as ssh -X.  And doesn't require setting up a VPN.\nIf your desktop machines are behind a NAT or a proxy though, you'll need to use a VPN.\nSetting-up a VPN is a little bit of work though.  Luckily I find the community documentation of OpenVPN to be pretty easy to follow.\n\nA: What you are searching for is a VNC (Virtual Network Computing) Solution.\nUbuntu already has a Programm preinstalle it's called Vino\nOther popular Programms are:\n\n\n*\n\n*UltraVNC\n\n*TightVNC\n\n*RealVNC\n\n\nTo make this more secure you can use it via SSH ( https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNC?action=show&redirect=VNCOverSSH )\nAnother nice and easy Solution is TeamViewer although this might not be the best solution when managing 80 computers. ( http://www.teamviewer.com )\nEdit:\nTeamViewer even has an android client. On a phone it might be a little small but a tablet should be nice.\n\nA: Take a look at the AccessIT (http://www.minicom.com/kvm-enterprise.htm), it just the solution you are looking for... you can incorporate it with VNC, SSH, Telnet, ILO, Drack or just about anything your have setup in your servers.. and with it you can manage who will have access to your servers (through what protocol they will connect), and block their access if required.\nndary\n", "Q: how to use kernel headers appropriately?

of the sanitised headers from /usr/include with some from the source in your home directory.\nIf you are writing a user space program, you may as well just use the sanitised headers that come with the distro: the only information they are missing are the parts necessary to compile code that is intended to run inside the kernel.\nTo recover the files you deleted, remove the two symlinks you created and then run apt-get install --reinstall linux-libc-dev.\nAlternatively, if you need to use unsanitised kernel headers for that particular kernel version, just pass -I/home/linux-2.6.21/include to the compiler so it will pick those headers in preference to the system installed ones.\n", "Q: How can I install the OpenGL libraries in Ubuntu 11.04?

If you go for it I'd like to hear your results.\n\nA: In my opinion its not advisable to try out LightDM. I have tried it and I have run into issues with my GUI.

During its installation run (sh hplip-3.11.3a.run), it cuts off with the following error message: \nerror: Configure failed with error: General / Unknown error.\n\nWhy?\nLucid Repositories combed for HP and CUPS programs, , 'hp-setup', and hplip-3.11.3a.run but to no avail.

Your help will greatly be appreciated.\n\nA: If it is not a newly produced printer (that may require an updated hplip driver), I think that you can install hp-lip from the Softare Center..if you search for Hp, it should show you the hplip driver and you can install it from there without any problem..tha version is\n3.10.2-2ubuntu2.2.. \nIf it is a newly produced printer or if it doesn't work with the previous step, maybe you should try adding this ppa ppa:hplip-isv/ppa that installs the hplip version 3.11.1-0ubuntu2~ppa1..to make this write from the terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:hplip-isv/ppa\n\nand then open the update manager and install the updates shown..\n", "Q: Resume interrupted copy I'm backing up an old hard drive and copying about 300GB of files.

I'm curious about this, i haven't seen something similar, the Unity Dash is something pretty close to that but it requires all of Unity which i don't like at all.\nThen there's Slingshot from the elementaryOS guys, but it's not even released yet, so that it's not currently an option.\nIs there anything else, that does the same as the Android Appdrawer ?\n\nA: I've written a little app that is very similar to folders on a Mac dock called Drawers: http://launchpad.net/drawers\nYou can put just about anything in a drawer by drag and drop. You can even nest drawers inside one another. See below for a screenshot.\nTo install, run the following in a terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ian-berke/ppa-drawers\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install drawers\n\nThen create your first drawer by opening the dash and typing Drawers (or executing /opt/extras.ubuntu.com/drawers/bin/drawers if you're not using Unity). The drawer is just a .desktop launcher file in ~/.local/share/applications. Just drag it to the launcher or put the .desktop file where you want.  Applications can be added by dragging from the dash or nautilus to an open drawer. All other files/links can be added by dropping on open drawer or the launcher. This was designed for Unity, but I've tested in gnome-shell too.\n\n\nA: Probably not.\nIf you're looking for an 'app drawer' there is nothing that I know of that provides that graphical functionality alone.\nFor the ability to type in things to launch you have: gnome-do, kupfer, and synapse.\nFor an alternative to Unity, you can use Gnome-Shell from the gnome3 team that also supplies a similar 'app drawer' functionality. Of course gnome-shell is like unity in that it changes how you interact with your desktop.\nBut if you want to give it a try, I suggest building it from source, because it will allow you to fall back to your default desktop configuration if necessary without the hassles of needing ppa-purge. Note that building it from source may take a long time (over an hour)\nInstructions here: http://www.webupd8.org/2010/10/install-gnome-shell-from-git-in-ubuntu.html\n", "Q: Unity Lenses Missing (files/folders, applications) The File & Folders lens and default Applications lens is missing from my dock.

How do I add it back?\n\nA: The package responsible for the buttons in the right upper corner is indicator-session. In order to get the buttons displayed, you also need indicator-applet-complete. Install these packages it with:\nsudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install indicator-applet-complete indicator-session\n\nAfter the installation, you need to re-login in the graphical session.\nI've verified this by removing all packages related to the Ubuntu desktop on an Ubuntu 11.04 Live CD and by installing the server using tasksel.

It's not nearly as scary as its screenshots suggest. It's great for having multiple terminals nested in one physical window. You can have tabs, broadcast (where your input goes to all the terminals) and you can move things around (although, not window-to-window).\nI guess the idea with this is, after you get used to it, you never need more than one window.\nsudo apt-get install terminator\n\n", "Q: Can I make Unity Autoscale according to monitor size, resolution and dot pitch?

Upgrades have mostly worked well and the dual screen setup is almost working. There are however a couple of annoying bugs which I tried to report but the bug reporting tool told me to ask about the bugs here. Here's what I have found:\n\n\n*\n\n*Auto-hide stops working. It doesn't seem to matter which application is maximised/covering the dock, it just stays on top. I have tested changing the autohide settings with no result.\n\n*Scenario: One maximised window on each screen. If I now try to drag the window that doesn't have focus by dragging the top of the window nothing happens. I can also not give the window focus by clicking the top bar, I have to click inside the window and then I can drag the window. If I unmaximise the window with focus it does work and I can both change focus and drag the window directly by clicking the top of the maximised window.\n\n\nAny bug fixes coming for these issues?\nAny work-arounds?\n\nA: I'm sure all this will eventually be smoothed out and fixed. I run a dual monitor setup and have noticed and been annoyed by the exact same things. Just keep in mind that this is a MAJOR revision to an age old window manager and will take some time to iron out all the kinks. I think the race to market between Gnome 3 and Unity may have pushed both development groups to churn out a product that wasn't maybe 100% ready. 11.10 should address most of these issues if not in a patch sooner.\nAs for the dysfunctional unity launcher, I have reverted to disabling auto-hide at this point but with 2 large LCD's I have room to spare.\nAs for the focus issue I think it has something to do with the fact that they integrate the title bar into the top panel when a window is maximized. Be patient, my friend. \nSorry for not having a better solution for you. As a last resort I would just default back to the classic gnome desktop if you can't deal with the above stated issues until they are addressed.\n\nA: *\n\n*Your question is a little unclear.  By \"it just stays on top,\" do you mean the toolbar or dock will not auto-hide?  If you are talking about when the toolbar stops auto-hiding then I can help.  For me, it seems to do this, only on some programs. It happens when I click and drag an object.  For example, moving a file to a folder, then the toolbar will not auto-hide.  I have noticed it with Mendeley Desktop and QtiPlot so far.  To get the bar to return to auto-hide, simply go to a web page, click and drag so text to highlight, then click the highlighted text, hold and drag.  This has worked for me, and others have said it works too.  I hope this helps!  It's weird, I know.  I hope it is addressed too!\n\n*I am pretty sure that is how the windows are just working in 11.04, and it is just highlighted when using two or more monitors.  I have noticed this effect on my dual setup for my office and home.  Hopefully, it will be addressed, but I have kind of gotten used to it.  Now only if I could get my quad monitors to work!!\n", "Q: What are the most compatible mini PCI express wireless cards I have got an Acer Aspire One netbook and I am after a wireless card that actually works well with ubuntu.  The original card was flaky and disconnecting intermittently and so I replaced it with an Intel Wireless WiFi 5100AGN.  Again I have had driver problems with this card, I am stuck running WEP with me providing the IP address etc..  It will not work with WPA at all.  It's a strange one as the card works fine on other wireless networks and other devices work fine on my wireless network (Buffalo WHR-G54S running tomato firmware).  In both cases the wireless cards are reported to be supported by Ubuntu.\nAnyway, can anyone recommend the any wireless cards or chipsets that are most compatible with Ubuntu and a range of wireless access points?\n\nA: You can find most of the compatible ones here: http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Devices/PCI it includes PCI ones, USB ones and the Mini PCI-E you want to look for.\nRemember that about 99% of the compatibility comes from the Kernel and not the Distro. Most distro will include some wireless cards and maybe the 3rd party drivers but if you want to look to be sure I recommend you check first what Kernel version the distro you want is using. Since you are here i will assume we are talking about Ubuntu 11.04 which has the 2.6.38 Kernel version. The amount of network drivers can be found here: http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux26Changes for each kernel version. since networking is one of the key features of Linux and is one of the most worked one you have a very high chance that buying a known wireless card will work out of the box (When i say known i mean something like RaLink, Broadcom, etc.. instead of some weird company card like \"Chicken Little Wireless Card French Fries Edition\"\nAlso I already installed 3 Acer Aspire One and they work 100%.

It should be b/g/n card.\nWell but the max link speed reported is 72Mbit and real transfer (iperf) is under 50Mbit mostly.. I think it just could be better if I buy better (better supported, with better driver?) card, and they go for few $.. \nIntention is to get some of 802.11n speeds in real, just to have more comfortable use of file sharing than 10 or even 6 MB/s or so.. My home server can push 100MB/s via NFS (over gigabit lan), and my wifi gives around 130Mbit to other clients, e.g. my old weak eepc wifi (but it is miniPCI).\nSo it seems to be easy..

That went fine after some tweaks, I copied the entire disk using \"cp -a\" without any major problems.\nAfter running for a while now in the internal HDD I need to temporarily move back my system to the external HDD since I am swapping Laptops. What I did initially was to simply transfer the internal HDD to the external using rsync on a running system, just to test. I will make the real transfer later on after booting from USB flash so both HDD's is not in use.\nI tried to setup the external HDD for boot using grub-install after I chrooted to the external hdd but everytime I bootup the Laptop and select external HDD as boot device it always boots from the internal HDD.

I've just installed Self Control for Ubuntu.\nIt looks like it just tweaks /etc/hosts and defines some rules in iptables.\nSome sites aren't getting blocked, and I think it's because they're distributing hosting across a couple of servers. There's a system administrator way to say that, I'm sure, but I suspect I need to define wildcard rules.\nSo my first question is: can I write wild card rules for /etc/hosts and iptables (which?) to prevent access to anything at, hypothetically, *.facebook.com? I don't need to do this inside of SelfControl.\nI'd also like to fail more elegantly -- now the page just tries to load and doesn't. I'd like to redirect to a local page where I can offer myself little reminders about how this isn't actually where I want to spend my down time. Can I do that w/in the framework above? Redirect to a page on localhost? \n(I am running a local web server, as I think anyone on Ubuntu is)\n\nA: No, you can't have wildcards in /etc/hosts.\nOne easy way to set this up where you can have wildcards is to install a local Squid proxy, and then use squid ACLs to ban access to *.facebook.com, askubuntu.com, etc.  You can make these ACLs active only for particular times of the week.  Then you just need enough selfcontrol not to turn off your browser's proxy settings.\n\nA: Some home based routers also offer fairly robust access restrictions as well which would not be tied to your OS but your MAC or IP address instead. I use the features in my router to block my child's access to specific sites as well as completely block access if there is a reason to, i.e., grades, restriction for other reasons. It uses rules which can be applied in several different manners including times of the day and days of the week.\njust wanted to provide another alternative. :)\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on external hard disk I have an external Hard disk with 500 GB capacity.

The same care must be taken, in that you need to ensure you have selected the correct drive partitions to install Ubuntu to.  If you have not already done so, I would strongly recommend using the Windows 7 partitioning tools to resize the existing partition on the external drive to make space for Ubuntu.  You can do this using the LiveCD, but NTFS support is not 100% foolproof in Linux so you may suffer data loss if you do it this way.  \nAs for Grub, you really should install that to the external hard drive as well. When the computer boots, Grub will look for its files on the external hard drive. Without these files the system cannot boot.  If you leave the external hard drive connected every time you boot then that won't be a problem.  But having Grub on your external hard drive is preferred.  Just ensure that your computer looks to boot from USB before any internal hard drives.  Then, when you have your external drive connected Grub will be loaded first and will actually have a menu entry for Windows 7 if you want to boot from that.  In addition, you can use the Ubuntu on this hard drive when connected to any computer which boots from USB first.  \n\nA: You just have to select the right device during the installation of Ubuntu. An external Hard Disk Drive works like a 'normal' internal HDD.\n", "Q: Can Banshee play internet radio from .pls files? I've recently become interested in Internet Radio, and have found a few stations that I would like to add in Banshee.\nExamples are the stations shown at http://www.chronixradio.com/ - but the only one I can add in Banshee is the 'Metal Masters' one. I tried getting the URLs for all of them from 'Listen Now' -> one of the radios -> 'MP3 Streams' -> '128k Cable/DSL', but for some reason the only one that Banshee can figure out is the Metal Masters one.\nI suspect that it may be because the other stations have 'mirrors' in the .pls files.

When I boot from an USB stick into my laptop I am able to mount and connect through chroot to the my hard drive and browse my files without a problem, while this has been something very very useful in times, I figure it would also be way to easy to access my files and installation for someone else.\nWhat alternatives do I have to secure my hard drive?\n\nA: I am aware of two solutions: LUKS and Truecrypt (discontinued).\nTruecrypt is generally used for encrypting part of your hard disk or an external disk. It is possible to encrypt entire hard disks with Truecrypt, with a small unencrypted partition for pre-boot authentication and decryption. However, this only works with Windows systems. I would only use Truecrypt for non-bootable disks. Truecrypt's source code is publicly available, it's free of charge and it's reliably cross-platform. It's not included in Ubuntu's repositories because it's not strictly open source.\nUpdate: The TrueCrypt developers have mysteriously discontinued it and now recommend other solutions.\nLUKS/cryptsetup is better integrated with Ubuntu, specifically Nautilus and Disk Utility. If you're installing a fresh system, it's very easy to encrypt the entire hard drive using the alternate CD. There's an option in the install process that does it all for you automatically. I would definitely recommend using LUKS unless you have to use Truecrypt.\nI'm currently multi-booting an unencrypted Windows system, an unencrypted Debian system and a LUKS encrypted Ubuntu system (which includes both the root partition and swap). Getting this set up was complicated, but there are guides online. One thing to be aware of is that LUKS LVMs cannot be resized to the left, and resizing to the right is complicated.\n\nA: One word: LUKS\nLUKS is a full-disk encryption method. At boot-time, you have to enter a passphrase. With the given passphrase, a key slot is unlocked and the actual key for encrypting the data is retrieved. LUKS can be seen as a encrypted partition which holds another partition.\nBecause most users have multiple partitions (the / partition and swap), it's often used with LVM to avoid having to enter a password for each LUKS encrypted partition. LVM can be seen as a special partition holding multiple partitions (simplified). The structure would look like this:\nDisk\n+-LUKS partition\n  +-LVM partition\n    +-/\n    +-/home\n    +-swap\n\nUsing the alternate CD, you can create a new installation using LVM + LUKS. Within the disk partitioning step, an option is visible for copying data from another partition. If you do not mind reinstalling the whole system, backup your files and settings and do a new installation using the alternate CD.\nFor a more correct documentation of LUKS (cryptsetup), see Cryptsetup FAQ.\n", "Q: Folder browser: Copy to restricted locations?

Any suggestions/ideas are very welcome.\n\nA: Under Open/Save → Modes & Filetypes you'll find that the Markup/CSS filetype has an indentation profile assigned. \nAll filetypes that don't follow the system default will use their indentation mode no matter what you set in the preferences.

I recently installed tomcat6 with apt-get and have got it up and running. Ubuntu doesnt set the $CATALINA_BASE and $CATALINA_HOME environment variables during the install. How can I locate these directories, so I can manually set them?\n\nA: Both are stored and can be set in /etc/default/tomcat6. By default, CATALINA_HOME is /usr/share/tomcat6, and CATALINA_BASE is /var/lib/tomcat6.\n\nA: In either Tomcat6 or Tomcat7 installed with Apt-Get, find the declarations of \nCATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE, in /etc/init.d/tomcat6 or tomcat7, and EXPORT them to the OS variables.

I've just finished setting up a RAID 1 on my system. Everything seems to be okay, but I have a very slow boot time. It takes about three minutes between the time I select Ubuntu from GRUB and the time I get to the login screen.\nI found this really neat program called bootchart which graphically displays your boot process.\nThis is my first boot (after installing bootchart). I'm not an expert at reading these, but it appears there are two things holding up the boot, cdrom_id and md_0_resync. I tried unplugging my CD drive SATA cable, and this is the new boot image.\nIt's faster, but it still takes about a minute, which seems pretty slow on this system. The md0 RAID device is my main filesystem. Is it true that it needs to get resynced on each boot?\nI'm not sure how to diagnose my CD drive issue. The model is a NEC ND-3550A DVD RW drive. I should also note that there's a quick error message at startup about the CD rom. It's too quick for me to read it, just one line on a black screen saying \"error: cdrom something something\".\nI'm not sure what other information to include. Thanks for any help.\n\nA: This turned out to be me being impatient. The software RAID controller needs to sync the drives after you install. I wasn't giving it enough time to do that. For large drives (e.g. 1GB or larger) this can take a few hours. Rebooting can actually stop this process and make it restart once the boot is finished.\nTo see the progress of the drive sync you can run\ncat /proc/mdstat\n", "Q: How can I upgrade a netbook with low system memory? I have a mini laptop with 100MB remaining (on a 4GB drive). The computer has an SD slot and I have a 2GB SD card available. Xubuntu says that only 2GB are required, I could also have it set up with ssh keys to plenty of memory on my desktop and server.\nCurrently when I try to upgrade from Xubuntu 10.10 to 11.04, I get the following error:\n\nNot enough free disk space\nThe upgrade has aborted. The upgrade\n  needs a total of 1,717M free space on\n  disk '/'. Please free at least an\n  additional 1,610M of disk space on\n  '/'. Empty your trash and remove\n  temporary packages of former\n  installations using 'sudo apt-get\n  clean'.\n\nIs there a way that I can use my SD card for the extra free space that is required? \n\nA: A solution could be to put your home folders on the SD card and deleting them from your flash card thus freeing valuable space. To use the SD card as an extension for your flash card is in my opinion not possible as they are two separate partitions.\n\nA: There is some confusion here. A fresh installation of Xubuntu requires a minimum of 2GB of hard drive space. The fact that you are currently using 3.7GB means this is not a fresh installation, thus that 2GB no longer applies. To upgrade an existing installation requires enough space on the hard drive for the actual installation plus temporary file space required during the upgrade. The suggestion to move /home to the SD card would seem valid. This frees space the upgrade will require, since it must have both new and old copies of applications and files at the same time. You could also attempt to free space by removing files in /tmp.\n\nA: For the SD card to be used for extra space i do not know if it can be done but for several reasons i think it is not recommended. Specially if the SD slot gets damaged/old, the SD card gets damaged (Since it is a portable media device) and the most likely is that the booting part would not recognise the SD in some cases so it would not boot from there. you also can not divide the system in one small part in the internal hard drive and the rest in the SD.\nNow for the recommendations. I would highly suggest to start removing stuff from the 4GB hard drive. With 100MB you will not be able to install almost nothing (Maybe Damn Small Linux) but not Ubuntu/Lubuntu/?buntu. Anyway the upgrade fails saying that message because you have 100MB and it needs 1.7 Free. If you check the sizes you will noticed that the additional size it mentions is 100MB less than the one it needs. So it is saying that you need to free AT LEAST 1.6GB from the 4GB hard drive to be able to install it.\n\nA: You can reformat the whole 4GB drive so that you can use all disk space to store the OS on. This can be done when installing ubuntu or any other distributions. Another option is to actually buy a external Hard drive to store everything on and just use your 4GB as Boot record. For me personally I would do this, memory cost hardly anything today.\nOther than what is said before I would suggest installing another operating system such as Lubuntu or Cloud OS and so on...\n", "Q: Looking for a Frontpage alternative (web design IDE) \nPossible Duplicate:\nBasic Web Development IDE/Editor like Dreamweaver? \n\nIs there any Frontpage alternatives out there I can use?\nPlease list any and all alternatives available with a recommendation per answer.\n\nA: KompoZer ( Click To Install )\n\n\nKompoZer is a complete web authoring system that combines web file management and easy-to-use WYSIWYG web page editing.\nKompoZer is designed to be extremely easy to use, making it ideal for non-technical computer users who want to create an attractive, professional-looking web site without needing to know HTML or web coding.\n\n\nA: There is BlueGriffon\n\n\nIs an open source, cross-platform WYSIWYG editor has reached version 1.0.
