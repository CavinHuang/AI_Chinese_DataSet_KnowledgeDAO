["Q: New MacBook Pro screen goes black when opened past a certain angle My MacBook PRM went black suddenly as it was being used. no reasons. PRAM reset didnt help. When connected to external monitors there is no issue. \nThe display is good as the lid is opened up to around 80degrees or so. Then it becomes black.  It definitely is a hardware issues\nSearching yielded the below & the issue appears to be the same.  Any idea with 15\" ? Apple wants to charge 700$ for the same - this laptop was purchase Jan 2017.  Any suggestions?  No extended warranty\nNew MacBook Pro 13” screen goes black when opened past vertical \n\nA: There is little doubt this is indeed the same issue as with the 13\". Apple changed the screen hinge signal cable design starting from the 2015 MacBook Retina and subsequent MacBook Pros, both 13\" and 15\", to a design that is more complex and prone to failure from material fatigue. These signal cables often start failing in precicely the way you have experienced after the screen has been opened and closed some hundreds of times. I have replaced many of these screens for this reason, both 13\" and 15\", they are all susceptible to it, at least up to and including the 2018 models.\nFor the time being, you are however out of luck with Apple replacing it for free, as they inexplicably only have a repair program for this issue for the 13\" 2016 model.\n\n'Old', robust screen signal cable to the left, exiting at a right angle from the screen and thus twisting with screen openings.

I found a template in the Script Editor for a script intended to be run by Mail as the result of matching a rule (File -> New From Template -> Mail -> Mail Rule Action) and it starts out with:\nusing terms from application \"Mail\"\n    on perform mail action with messages these_messages for rule this_rule\n\nMy question is how can I (for example) pick a message and then cause this script to execute as that message being part of these_messages so I can debug it?  I'm new to AppleScript and so I mostly want to poke around, display intermediate results, and slowly build up the script.\n\nA: I created a mailbox on the same imap server and moved some junk mail into it (5 or 6 messages).  I then created my rule that called the script.  I disabled the other rules just to make sure that they were not doing anything weird.\nThen select one or more messages in the sample mailbox and do Mail => Message => Apply Rules which will send the selected messages through the rules which ends up calling the script.  This is tied to CMD-OPT-L so its possible to cycle from compile and save in the script editor, switch to Mail to run the rules and back to the Script Editor all from the keyboard.\n", "Q: Setting older Wacom table preferences using MacOS 10.14 or later This is an update to an older question:Is it possible to use old Wacom tablet on 10.11?\nI am not allowed to comment on some of the great answers there, so asking as a new question.\nI followed the suggestions (answer by @RemBem) and was able to have the Wacom preference pane open using a combination of the most recent supported driver for my Intuos2 tablet and an updated info.plist. \nHowever, most of the preference pane is grey and it is not useful.

I have a Macbook Air that has 2 partitions on the hard drive. One is for Yosemite (450GB) named \"Macintosh HD\" and the other already has Mojave (50GB) on it named \"Macintosh HD 2\".\nWhen upgrading the Mojave to Catalina, I wanted to back up the Mojave partition (\"Macintosh HD 2\") and upgrade it.\nBut when I plugged in an external hard drive named \"Seagate2TB\", Time Machine started to back up hard drive 1 first (450GB) \"Macintosh HD\".  Since I already set and boot up using Mojave, I restarted the machine, and ejected the 450GB partition \"Macintosh HD\", but when Time Machine started again, it still was backing up some 410GB of data, which means \"Macintosh HD\" is included.\nSo I went to Time Machine's Preferences, and clicked on Options, \"+\", and chose what to exclude: \"Macintosh HD\".\nNext I rebooted the Macbook Air and wait for the back up to start, and it again, reported backing up 410GB of data.\nHow can \"Macintosh HD\" be excluded?\n\nA: Your problem is a consequence of an over simplified vision of users from Apple:\na user has one uniq computer with one uniq partition then name it with a simple and uniq name \"Macintosh HD\".\nOnce you start to have external disks, different versions of OS on the same disk, you should carefully avoid all the failures this over simplistic naming scheme will led you to.\nChange all your partitions names with a very clear and really unambiguous name\nfor you and forever.\nMy personnal use is as follows: every disk partition is named from the computer name it is used on ex.: coriolis, the partition number ex.: 1, its actual capacity, ex.: 250 Gb and the version of the OS it is used on, ex.: High Sierra for a production OS or 10.14.1 for a test one.\nEx.:\ncoriolis 1 250 Gb High Sierra\ncoriolis 2 250 Gb 10.14.1\n\nAll my computers, all my external disks have a different and uniq name registered at time of their 1st formatting.\n", "Q: iPod nano Bluetooth problems with AirPods My iPod nano 7th generation gets connected to my AirPods 2nd generation.

This still works at iOS 15, just that your have to delete and create a new shortcut using the url link.run once and DO NOT back track to Location again else it won’t work. Save it as it is and run again.\n\nA: Another thing you can do as of now is open the Location Services settings menu from Shortcuts by using an \"Open URL\" action.\n\nOn iOS 16.2 the URL needs to be adjusted to: \"prefs:root=Privacy&Security&path=LOCATION\"\nThis might change in the future if the name of the menu under which you find the Location settings is changed. (Search \"Location\" in your settings and make sure to use the name of the parent menu.)\n\nA: What Louis said is the simplest way to do it, but if for some reason you require turning it on as part of a shortcut, the closest you are going to get with the Shortcuts app is by enabling voice control and having your device say “Open Siri”. Unfortunately in this case, Apple has made the Shortcuts app to where it will stop running when Siri is activated, and continue after Siri is closed.\n\nYou also could have your device say “open settings” and have it tap privacy (assuming the privacy tab is visible when the shortcut runs) and manually navigate to the setting yourself, but that pretty much defeats the main purpose of having a Shortcut. Either way, some type of action is required by the user to toggle Location Services.\nIf you really really want to automate this, there is one workaround, although it takes a bit more effort than it may be worth. You need to have 2 iOS devices; the first device needs to have Voice Control enabled. The second device will need to be close to the first device with the audio at about 50% at least. The second will run the shortcut that plays audio to the other device to tell it what to do. It will say:\n“Open settings”,\n“Swipe up Airplane Mode” (in case you are in landscape view),\n“Tap Privacy”,\n“Tap Location Services”,\n“Tap Location Services”,\n“Tap Turn Off” (in case you are turning it off, it will tell the prompt to disable the setting).\nThis is a link to the shortcut:\nhttps://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/86929b1cd7074d7e81898284135ee4ad\nAgain, a bit of an odd way to do it, but there aren’t many other ways. Also note that this only works some of the time; annoyingly, sometimes Voice Control doesn’t understand what it is being told to do. But it should hopefully work most of the time.\n\nA: Building upon user 6209's answer that recommends using Siri to turn off location services, here is my answer as per iOS 12. \nKeep doing it as long as Siri doesn't add a shortcut itself in iOS spotlight suggestions(drag down on home screen). When it does, go to Shortcuts app and assign that suggestion to a shortcut. You might also want to put it on your home page as an app, in case you cannot speak at the moment. \n\n", "Q: Why won't icloud account accept my password from my Mac Mini? Attempted to sign in to my iCloud account on my Mac Mini and it failed.\nI use a password manager so the pwd hasn't changed.\nI went ahead and changed the password (and used the old password) and the iCloud account said that it reset it.\nThen I tried signing in again and it still failed:\n\nSo, since I still can't sign into iCloud account (supposedly incorrect pwd) I decided to change it again.\nBut this time it complains that I cannot change pwd to same thing  -- \n\nThis means that it knows what my password is, since it just let me change it and now it won't let me change it to the same thing.

I know the password to my appleId, because I just signed in on the web site (to confirm) while using it.  \nIs this thing trying to get me to sign in with my appleId or iCloud id?  This is a really terrible system.\n\n\nA: I had to take the following steps to get it to work again:\n\n\n*\n\n*reboot Mac Mini\n\n*sign in using local account.\nWhen I signed in, it said that FaceTime needed a password -- that was my original icloud account.\n\n*I then went to Settings and signed into the iCloud account (using my original icloud password).\n\n*it requested I set up the sync items (find my mac, etc).\n\n\nThe sign on worked but my appleId sign on now seems to have the same password as my icloud id which I thought was not possible in the past.\nSo, I guess the point is that if you encounter this error where you can't sign into iCloud you should reboot the device and work through it to see if you can get signed in again.\n", "Q: How to tell macOS to move things to the cloud and free space on my laptop? I use iCloud Drive and I see sometimes macOS keep files on the cloud and locally on the laptop there is only a link to the file. Whenever I need the file just click the link and it downloads. So far so good.\nI have a lot of files, so no possible to keep everything locally. And I would like to keep adding files and take advantage of macOS functionality. I added many files (cd/dvd iso images) and disk is almost full. I guess at some point macOS will decide to keep files only on the cloud and free some space locally. Can I force this? How?\nI have a lot of free space on iCloud Drive, like 5 times size of laptop ssd.\n\nA: iCloud is a syncing solution and not a backup in the same sense as Dropbox or OneDrive.  It's not possible to keep something on iCloud and not on a device at the same time. \nThe setting Optimise Mac Storage setting creates a reference to the documents when your Mac is low on storage but still keeps the file in sync.  The file is not really removed from your device because if you delete the referenced file on the Mac it will delete it in iCloud, too, which is not what you wanted. It runs on its own schedule and constraints. \nWhat iCloud offers is the ability to access files from all devices that are signed-in using that same Apple ID.  It was never meant to be, or designed, to act as an offsite storage.\nIf you need to do that you'll have to look at using other providers, like the one's I've already mentioned, for those file.\n", "Q: Where can I find raw data for Apple photo's face recognition I've been using Mac's photos to recognize faces in my pictures. I'm interested in seeing some basic stats such as the occurrences and co-occurrences of people and how they change over time. Is there a place where the raw data are stored so that I can write codes to perform analysis?\n\nA: In Mojave and earlier: Photos library (right click) > Show package contents > Resources > Media > Face. The sub-folders within the Face folder contains thumbnails of all faces. Additional data about them can be found in Database > photos.db but you'll need DB Browser for sqlite or similar program. Face related data is in a table named RKFace, several other tables named RKFace..., and elsewhere.\nIn Catalina and later, use the same approach as above but the folder names are different. You'll be querying Database > photos.sqlite, and looking at tables such as ZDETECTEDFACE, ZFACECROP, and basically any other with \"face\" in it.\nBe very careful not to modify, delete or move anything when you open Photos library.photoslibrary.\n\nA: ~/Pictures/Photos\\ Library.photoslibrary \nUse show package contents in right click menu. They will be separated using dates. In some folders, there are thumbnails of faces cropped out. You can write some simple scripts to traverse the folders and arrange them separately. Making a backup of the library is a good idea before running scripts. \n", "Q: File in Photos app and Files app shows different size when transferring files In iPhone, I copied a file from Photos app to Files app as mentioned below.\n  Open the default Photos app on iPhone -> \n  select a single file \n  (or multiple files by clicking the Select button at the top right corner) -> \n  click the Share/Upload upward-pointing arrow icon -> save to Files\n\nNow, the size of the file(some name like IMG_0567.MOV) shown in the Files app on iPhone is different from the file size shown in Windows OS File Explorer when I connect my iPhone to a PC using USB cable.

Apple Pay increased the transaction limits recently.\nIn the UK it used to be £30, but is now 'higher' - without a limit being mentioned in Apple's Cashless made effortless page [UK link].\nThough it's not usable everywhere - stores must update their equipment to use it apparently - I've paid for the weekly shopping at Sainsbury's for a bill of over £100, which I was slightly wary it may have rejected - but it didn't.\nIs there a published limit anywhere, or is it up to your bank/card supplier to enforce their own transaction limit?\n\nA: There's no limitation on Apple Pay itself. The limitation comes from the terminal that the store uses. \nIf you have a terminal that supports contactless cards and nothing else the limit is £30 per purchase, £100 per day, just as for a contactless card. The limit is low to avoid someone stealing your card and going on a shopping spree. And the stupid terminal doesn't realise that you have an iPhone that is much better protected than your card. \nIf you have a terminal that recognises Apple Pay, that terminal would know that you are really there with your phone in your hand, with the user of the phone pressing a button, so the transaction is much safer and the limit is much higher. What the actual limit is will depend on your bank. \nNote: The difference isn't that one is unsafe and one is safe, the difference is that in the first case the terminal doesn't know it's safe, and in the second case it knows. \n\nA: There are published limits here which vary by country. \nFor the United Kingdom the limits varies by issuer as follows:\n\nUnited Kingdom\nYou might not be able to use Apple Pay for purchases over 30 GBP.\n\n", "Q: Notes app Catalina and iOS 13 will not synch Notes.app in Catalina and iOS 13 will not synch reliably across devices.

From my experience with Photos.app and Lightroom this is probably the best way to approach it if the desired album (i.e. unnamed people) and features don't exist natively.\n\nOne option is to create a Smart Album via File > New Smart Album and apply the necessary criteria to filter out existing people.\nSpecific exclusions\nIf you have a small number of people you can choose [Person] | [does not include] and add full or partial names to exclude from the Album.\nNote that you may need multiple \"conditions\" (i.e. lines of criteria) to filter out everyone as you can't use wildcards, comma separated names, etc. This also may not be practical if you have large numbers of people in Photos.\nBulk exclusions (this is what you want)\nAs a catch all approach you can exclude a set of letters that would cover most names such as a,e,i,o,u as at least one of those letters is present in most names. Make sure to select \"All\" in the \"Match [___] of the following conditions\" line. This works because it will do partial matches to including the letter o will match (and exclude) names like John, Bob, Thomas, etc.\nIf / when you find photos containing people that were not caught by this catch all you can determine which letter(s) are missing and add them to the rule.\n\n\nA: For Catalina, this method works (at least from what I can tell):\n\n*\n\n*Person is not %\n\n*Person is blank (i.e., the field is literally blank)\n\nIt's possible that just the second condition is all that is needed.\nHere is what it looks like:\n\n", "Q: Reset External HDD password without losing data I set a password on my external HDD using disk utility.

Being able to reset the password and still get at the data defeats the purpose.\nIf you used that drive on a different system, and you allowed that system to save the password so it could automatically access the drive, then there is a slim chance that it could be sitting that other machine's Keychain Access secret store. (Whereby you'd open the Keychain Access app, authenticate, scan all the list of entries for the one that looked like your drive, click it, likely re-authenticate again, and it'd [in theory] show you the password to use on the first machine.)\nOther than that, set the drive aside and see if the password comes to memory at some point in the future. Reformatting the drive will lose the data. Trying to get at it without the password ought to look like jumbled bits -- and you certainly don't want to alter them for fear of corrupting the underlying information.\nFor the future, always-always-always squirrel device access and/or recovery passwords somewhere away secure, whether on paper or in a password vault (like 1Password, LastPass, or some other similar secrets manager).\nSorry this wasn't the answer you hoped for.\n", "Q: iPhone sending texts to Apple Message, not phones My wife has an iPhone. I have an Android phone. I also have a MacBook running Mojave. We've texted with no problem for years. Suddenly, however, we're encountering these periods where my wife will text my phone number and the message will go to my MacBook's Messages app instead of my phone.\nI tried disabling my account in Messages but then I didn't receive texts in either place.\nWhat could be causing this? Is it a setting on her phone or my laptop?\n\nA: I've run into this problem before, and it's usually that the phone number has some how become dissociated with iCloud but the email has not.\nIf, in iOS, you go to Settings / FaceTime, you'll see a \"You can be reached by Facetime at\" and this will often show if your phone number is even associated or activated.\nLikewise, go to Settings / Messages / Send & Receive / > and see if appears there.\nSee https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201349 for details about adding numbers.\n\nA: Your wife needs to go to the messages app on her phone, go into the conversation with you, tap your name on top, then \"Info\", then your name again (why Apple) and on this screen it should say \"Last contacts\" next to your phone number. If \"Last contacts\" is next to your email address, your wife sends iMessages via email, which is possible but obviously doesn’t work with your Android phone.\nIn the latter case she needs to create a new conversation with you, and this time specifically choose your phone number.\n", "Q: Why is /Application/Utilies \"empty\" in macOS Catalina from Terminal but not Finder? Intent: I'm just curious as to what's going on under the hood that explains the behavior I'm seeing. (Detailed technical answers upvoted.)\nI noticed that if I use Finder and open /Applications, I see a folder called Utilities (as we have for all pre-Catalina operating systems); opening that shows the usual cadre of utility applications.\nHowever, if I open Terminal and try to list those same files, they do not appear:\n$ ls -la@  /Applications/Utilities\n\nMy question: What's really going on, and how is this possible?\nmacOS Catalina v10.15 (build 19A602)\n\nMy own experiments before asking publicly:\nMy first thought was to double check the path -- and right clicking the open Utilities window's icon in Finder showed the machine's name, the hard disk's name, then Applications, and Utilities.\nTyping $ ls -la@ into the command line and dragging the window's icon to Terminal injected the very same path; running the command (obviously) gave the same results.\nSo then I started looking to see if there was any new super-extended attributes or something? xattr showed nothing sneaky tucked away.\nNow suspecting this something new with APFS, I started researching and found three surprises:\n\n\n*\n\n*There's now a thing called a \"firm\" link, that is neither hard nor soft, that end users can't create, and it seems to be some magic about user-level mount points. Currently, I haven't found much detail on what they really are, what problem they solve, and whether or not I should actually care. Although the engineer in me would love to know what's going on.\n\n*Doing a man synthetic.conf brings up a very interesting man page, and make me want to go look at /etc/synthetic.conf, which doesn't exist.\n\n*The discovery of a /Systems/Applications directory.  That looks new.\n\n\nCuriosity caused me to try the following, which got me the filename results I expected:\n$ ls /System/Applications/Utilities\n\nSo, I'm left wondering:\n\n\n*\n\n*What was the driving need to move things under /System?\n\n*What is this witchcraft, if not hard links, making /Application exist?\n\n*Why is Finder showing content (apparently) from one place that's really under another?\n\n*Is my ~/Application directory subject to such wizardy? (Is there something else I ought to be wary of?)\n\n\nI'm not used to the case where a graphical shell shows files in a directory that the raw command-line talking to the file system doesn't ...the reverse, sure.\n\nWhy would I be doing this?\nI was trying to automate making a list of applications I have installed, just as I used to do for prior versions of OS X (here's the old way):\n$ ls ~/Applications /Applications /Applications/Utilities | fgrep .app | sed -e 's/.app//' | sort -if\n\nAnd the new (ignoring special cases of certain subdirectories):\n$ ls ~/Applications  /System/Applications /System/Applications/Utilities | fgrep .app | sed -e 's/.app//' | sort -if\n\n\nA: I don't know that anyone who knows the technical details of them can share them, because they are not known outside of Apple. But here's my attempt at some replies.\n\nWhat was the driving need to move things under /System?\n\nPresumably it was part of Apple's desire to put some of the core system in the \"read only\" partition which is also new in Catalina.\n\nWhat is this witchcraft, if not hard links, making /Application exist?\n\nI believe what you are seeing are \"firm links\" but you are correct that Apple has not released much information about firm links.\n\nWhy is Finder showing content (apparently) from one place that's really under another?\n\nPresumably because Apple knows people are used to finding them there, and thought it would be better to make them appear where people are used to finding them rather than putting them somewhere else.\n\nIs my ~/Application directory subject to such wizardy? (Is there something else I ought to be wary of?)\n\nNo. The only reason Apple is doing this is because of the read-only partition, which doesn't apply to your ~/Applications/ folder.\n", "Q: Catalina Music loses equalizer setting I have Catalina 10.15, Music 1.0.0.426 (the Catalina music player), on a MacBook Air 13\".\nWhen the song changes, the equalizer settings change.  I don't mean that the sliders move; they are where I left them.  But the sound changes.  (I set the bass high, and the difference is very noticeable.)  \nThen if I make any change to the equalizer--choose a different preset, or move one of the sliders a little bit--the sound changes back to what I intended.  (i.e. it changes to the setting that I have newly chosen--which is usually pretty similar to what I had before the song changed.)  The updated sound setting lasts until the end of the song, it seems, and then I have to fix it again.\nI don't know what sound configuration it's going back to when the song changes, but it's not the Flat setting.\nThis is pretty clearly a bug, and hopefully it will be fixed soon.  (I submitted a comment on the Apple feedback page, but who knows whether that has any effect.)\nIn the mean time, does anybody know of a workaround?  Is there is some setting that will stop this behavior from occurring?\n\nA: I eventually found a workaround.  I believe that the problem is that each new song reverts to whatever is the default equalizer setting.  \nThe workaround is to set an equalizer preset individually for each song.  You can do this for several songs at once--all of them, if you want--by highlighting the songs, choosing Get Info, going to the Options tab, selecting an equalizer preset from a dropdown towards the bottom of the window, and then saving.  That is what I am doing now.  Catalina Music is a lot less annoying now (but still annoying in some ways!). \n", "Q: Smart Mailbox -- Google Folder Doesn't Work I have a folder on 3 different email servers that contains notifications of forum replies.  I want to use a Smart Mailbox to view them all in one place.  However, when I go to set this up the Smart Mailbox won't save a folder within my GMail account, only that ONE GMail account.  I have 2 other GMail accounts that work just fine.\nSo I select the mailbox.\n\nSee, it is selected, and now I save it.\n\nOnce saved, I go back in, and now no mailbox is selected.\n\nI really don't know what else to try, this isn't a deal breaker but ALL of my other accounts work.  I've tried deleting my Google accounts from the computer (and iCloud) then loading them back but that doesn't work.\n\nA: The solution was in the fact that my Apple ID has been around for a long time and was the same email address as my GMail account.  I had to go into Apple's site, manage my ID, and then change my Apple ID to its associated iCloud email address.  Then I had to sign out of my Apple ID and back in on my Mac.  The confusion within Mail seemed to be rooted in the fact that it couldn't tell the two accounts apart in the filters since they had the same email address even though I could get mail on my iCloud account without issue.\n", "Q: About MIME: is it possible to always \"Open With“ text file with a a command line script? I want to always \"Open With\" text file, such .cpp/.h files with a command line script. I can use \"cmd+shift+G\" to open the folder of the command line script. However, Mac OS does not allow me to choose the script. Mac OS only allows me to use Applications.\nSo is there any workaround?\nThanks\n\nA: You would not only have to create an app, but you’d have to be able to assign it to open files of that type. That seems like it would outside the ability of most users, so I’m going to disqualify it as a “solution”.\nThe only option that I can think of would be to use Keyboard Maestro to assign a keyboard shortcut to open a selected file in Finder with the shell script.\nThe precise way to do this can be found by asking at http://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/.\n", "Q: Forgot to remove sim card and possibly sign out of icloud before selling! A couple of weeks ago, I sold an old iPhone 5. It hasn't been used for 3 years, and I can't remember what version of iOS it was running.\nIt just occurred to me that I did not remove the sim card.\nI looked into it and apparently iPhone sim cards don't store any data, everything is stored on the cloud. That's fine. Then I realized that I don't remember actually signing out of iCloud!\nI selected the erase all content and reset option. It asked for my password (I think twice) and maybe my 4 digit pin?\nThe phone erased within a minute and I saw the \"welcome\" page. \nI honestly don't know if I signed out of the cloud or logged out of find my iPhone!\nI tried to gain access to iCloud online (I'm using android now) and while I have my apple ID and password, I had set up a 2 factor authentication to my phone number that no longer exists, as I cancelled the number when I changed provider and did not need the cloud as I'm using android! I also have no other trusted devices.\nAs far as I understand I can now no longer access my cloud.\nI checked the find my phone section as it wasn't locked and it shows nothing? Maybe I did sign out of it, or maybe the phone is off?\nAs I said the phone definitely did reset, would it have automatically signed me out of cloud? And is the inactive sim card in the phone ok?\nFeeling stressed out, what are the chances the person I sold to can access the content on the phone?\n\nA: If you did a \"Erase All Content and Settings\" - then you have definitely logged the device out of your iCloud account. This function deletes everything stored on the phone, including accounts, app settings, app data, the apps themselves, documents, photos, etc.\nIf you had \"Find My iPhone\" enabled, the buyer of your phone would not be able to setup the phone without entering your username and password. I.e. they would have complained to you by now that the phone is essentially bricked. As weeks have gone by, it is far to assume that you either logged out of \"Find My iPhone\" or never had it enabled on this phone.\n", "Q: Catalina: HTTP downloads in Terminal stall without sudo I am experiencing a weird behavior only affecting running apps in the Terminal (BASH).\nWhen running wget someurl, it will timeout.

He would like to give his grandsons his old iPad 3 which he hasn't used for over a year. Wanting to wipe it, I came up across the Activation Lock.\nTry as we might we can't work out the username nor the password to be used. The fact that my father in law tends to create new accounts at Gmail with each new device (!) doesn't help, because we can't even work ouy which email address was used to lock the iPad.

I got a used Airport Express (2nd gen, the one that looks like a white Apple TV) to extend the wifi range of my Airport Extreme (the tall white monolith looking thing).*\nExpress rear view for reference:\n\nI ran ethernet from the Extreme to the Express (which is the Apple-recommended method) and when I plug it in to the WAN port, it brings the entire network down… both Extreme and Express are inaccessible.\nWhen I disconnect the ethernet cable, and the Express is connecting to the Extreme via wifi, the Express works to successfully extend wifi coverage. BUT I'd rather have it hardwired together (again, Apple-recommended, and a bunch of other reasons).\nWhat's going on here? How do I get this work?\nHere's what I know:\n\n*\n\n*I actually have two Expresses (only connecting one though) and both behave exactly the same way.\n\n*I know the ethernet cable and its connection to the Extreme is working, because I had another device that used that cable/port and it was working fine (Netgear Arlo Pro Hub).\n\n*From the image above, it actually looks like the WAN and LAN ports are interchangeable(?). So I've tried on both ports. No difference.\n\n*All devices have been upgraded to the latest firmware.\n\n\n*Yeah, I know: this is ancient tech. But up until this point my home wifi network has been rock solid. I got the pair of used Expresses for $30 total… so why not give this a shot?\n\nA: You might be having a situation in which you have a conflict because both devices are trying to act as DHCP servers, and perhaps serving addresses in the same range. \nMake sure your new Airport Express is configured in \"Bridge\" mode before connecting it to your network. I don't have an Airport here, and don't remember exactly what Apple calls the WiFi Router modes.  You want a mode in which the new Airport Express does NOT do DHCP or NAT routing, and just passes packets to and from your main Airport router. \nGet it configured in Airport Utility before trying to connect it to your network. You can temporarily connect it to your computer with an Ethernet cable. (Use the Airport's LAN port for this.) \nThen, you should connect an Ethernet cable from a LAN port of your main Airport to the WAN port of your new Airport Express. \n\nA: In this situation, where you're connecting your Express to your Extreme via ethernet (and not wifi) you actually want to choose Create a wireless network for the Network Mode, and not Extend a wireless network:\n\nTo me, this is completely counter intuitive. I am extending my wireless network and not creating one... a network already exists?! But, well, there you have it.\nAnyway, after discovering this solution via trial and error, I Googled for the difference between these two modes and found this:\n\nCreate a wireless network is used only when the Airports have an Ethernet connection. If you are using the setup wizard.....the setting will read Extend using Ethernet during the setup. If you go back in using AirPort Utility to check the Network Mode setting.....you will see that it is really Create a wireless network.\nExtend a wireless network is used only if an AirPort is connecting to another AirPort using wireless.......not Ethernet.\nEvery one of the Airports on your network must be configured to Create a wireless network.\nIf you do connect an Ethernet cable to an AirPort that is already set up to Extend a wireless network......that will create a massive feedback loop that will crash the network until you remove the Ethernet connection to the device.\n\nSo apparently, the combination of extending the wifi network and using an ethernet cable will create a feedback loop that crashes the network... which is exactly what I was experiencing.\nAnd now I know.\n", "Q: Can I use multiple partition external HDD connected to Apple Airport Extreme for Backups from both Mac and Windows PC I have a 6TB external drive partitioned into two equal partitions.  One is NTFS and the other is compatible with Time Machine backups.  The drive is then connected to the Airport Extreme via USB.  The Mac can see the Time Machine formatted drive.

Yet the problem persists. \nWhen I open said applications, they work for about 2-3 minutes and then suddenly freeze before the screen goes black and a small loading icon appears and then it takes me to the login screen.\nDoes anyone have any idea what could be going on?\nWhenever it crashes, files such as this pop up in /Library/Logs/DiagnosticsReports\nKernel_2019-10-29-124911_Username-iMac-7.gpuRestart\n\nAnd the content: \n\nThat's what I get when it crashes with blender, but I'm also getting some WindowServer logs too.\n\n\nA: The cause for your issue is most likely related to the graphics processing unit (GPU) of your iMac. This is what's commonly referred to as a graphics card.\nSome games and applications will place the GPU under a much heavier load compared to others. \nFor example, using a word processor will not tax the GPU much at all, but using applications such as Photoshop, Maya, Render, Final Cut Pro, Motion, etc will place a much heavier burden on the GPU. I'm not familiar with Roblox, but it's likely that it's also taxing the GPU heavily.\nNormally this would not be a problem, but if your Mac has a GPU that has developed a problem, it'll be enough to effectively cause it to crash in such a way that your Mac has to reboot. In this scenario it's a hardware fault that may mean repairing or replacing the GPU.\nSome Mac models were more prone than others to these types of problems. For example, the 27\" iMac model from mid-2011 was the subject of a graphics card replacement program for exactly this type of issue.\nHowever, it doesn't necessarily have to be a hardware fault. Software can often cause problems. For example, it could be a conflict between software, drivers, etc or a lack of graphics memory (especially if running multiple apps simultaneously). You could try troubleshooting this further by only running one application and seeing what happens. Perhaps testing in Safe Mode may be an option as well.\n\nRemove any CUDA and NVIDIA drivers\nSince you're running macOS Mojave (or above), you should be aware that any CUDA and NVIDIA drivers you have installed aren't supported.\nTo remove these:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Terminal (found within your Utilities folder)\n\n*Copy and paste the following commands, one by one, into Terminal followed by pressing enter on your keyboard.

How can I recover it?\n\nThe SATA cable in my MacBookPro9,2, which was running Mojave, failed recently. Whilst waiting for a replacement cable, I used a SATA-to-USB adapter to attempt to diagnose whether the drive (a Kingston A400 480GB) was at fault, using Ubuntu on another laptop. It seems that some of the data on the drive became corrupted due to the failing cable, as gdisk reported that the main GPT table was corrupted. I restored it from the backup GPT table, as that was apparently intact.\nI then used apfs-fuse to attempt to mount the APFS volumes on the drive (it just has an ESP and an unencrypted APFS container with the installation of Mojave that I was using). This showed that all the data on the main APFS volume was intact, aside from my user folder, /Users/jivan. Whilst jivan is shown by ls /mnt/apfs-volume/Users, trying cd or ls on jivan reports an I/O error.\n\nI booted into macOS Catalina Internet Recovery on my MacBook to inspect the drive further there using the SATA-to-USB cable, but diskutil apfs list reported that the APFS container had no volumes along with some errors, as follows:\nAPFS Containers (2 found)\n|\n+-- Container ERROR -69808\n    ======================\n    APFS Container Reference:     disk23\n    Size (Capacity Ceiling):      ERROR -69620\n    Capacity In Use By Volumes:   ERROR -69620\n    Capacity Not Allocated:       ERROR -69620\n    |\n    +-< Physical Store disk22s2 60A9A81B-E7B9-4471-A76B-B98A419B5928\n    |   -----------------------------------------------------------\n    |   APFS Physical Store Disk:   disk22s2\n    |   Size:                       479894224896 B (479.9 GB)\n    |\n    +-> No Volumes\n\nAlso, fsck_apfs -n /dev/disk22 gives the following (and likewise for disk22s2 and disk23):\n** Checking the container superblock.\n** Checking the EFI jumpstart record.\n** Checking the space manager.\n** Checking the space manager free queue trees.\n** Checking the object map.\n** Checking volume.\n** Checking the APFS volume superblock.\n** The volume macOS was formatted by diskmanagementd (945.241.4) and last modified by apfs_kext (1412.11.7).\n** Checking the object map.\nerror: (oid 0xd31c1) om: btn: found zeroed-out block\n   Object map is invalid.\n** The volume /dev/disk22 could not be verified completely.\n\n\nAfter my replacement SATA cable arrived, I fitted the Kingston drive back into my MacBook using the new cable, and interestingly, diskutil apfs list in Internet Recovery revealed the APFS volumes. I decided to install Catalina onto another drive (a Samsung spinning HDD), and booted from that using my SATA-to-USB cable to inspect further. Catalina mounted the Kingston drive's main APFS volume automatically on login, and shows the same directory tree and contents as apfs-fuse did on my Ubuntu laptop, but the /Users/jivan directory is apparently missing altogether from the volume; ls -al /Volumes/apfs-volume/Users just shows the file .localized and the directory Shared.\nIn this environment, here is the output of some commands. Here, disk0 is the affected Kingston drive, and disk2 is the Samsung drive which I am booting from over USB:\ndiskutil apfs list —\nAPFS Containers (2 found)\n|\n+-- Container disk1 37FD550D-60EE-4499-8C8F-DA1B831D5307\n|   ====================================================\n|   APFS Container Reference:     disk1\n|   Size (Capacity Ceiling):      479894224896 B (479.9 GB)\n|   Capacity In Use By Volumes:   393049374720 B (393.0 GB) (81.9% used)\n|   Capacity Not Allocated:       86844850176 B (86.8 GB) (18.1% free)\n|   |\n|   +-< Physical Store disk0s2 60A9A81B-E7B9-4471-A76B-B98A419B5928\n|   |   -----------------------------------------------------------\n|   |   APFS Physical Store Disk:   disk0s2\n|   |   Size:                       479894224896 B (479.9 GB)\n|   |\n|   +-> Volume disk1s1 6E2363BF-6CE3-4C87-9F02-BFFE741B8C6E\n|   |   ---------------------------------------------------\n|   |   APFS Volume Disk (Role):   disk1s1 (No specific role)\n|   |   Name:                      macOS (Case-insensitive)\n|   |   Mount Point:               Not Mounted\n|   |   Capacity Consumed:         389137477632 B (389.1 GB)\n|   |   FileVault:                 No\n|   |\n|   +-> Volume disk1s2 1190A062-F647-4365-A53F-2D0F18786F4C\n|   |   ---------------------------------------------------\n|   |   APFS Volume Disk (Role):   disk1s2 (Preboot)\n|   |   Name:                      Preboot (Case-insensitive)\n|   |   Mount Point:               Not Mounted\n|   |   Capacity Consumed:         23650304 B (23.7 MB)\n|   |   FileVault:                 No\n|   |\n|   +-> Volume disk1s3 FD9795DB-502A-4234-AD25-CAC5DC529D4C\n|   |   ---------------------------------------------------\n|   |   APFS Volume Disk (Role):   disk1s3 (Recovery)\n|   |   Name:                      Recovery (Case-insensitive)\n|   |   Mount Point:               Not Mounted\n|   |   Capacity Consumed:         507379712 B (507.4 MB)\n|   |   FileVault:                 No\n|   |\n|   +-> Volume disk1s4 24A3A499-3198-4C08-8566-4F1CBBCCC463\n|       ---------------------------------------------------\n|       APFS Volume Disk (Role):   disk1s4 (VM)\n|       Name:                      VM (Case-insensitive)\n|       Mount Point:               Not Mounted\n|       Capacity Consumed:         3221250048 B (3.2 GB)\n|       FileVault:                 No\n|\n+-- Container disk3 DE001FA1-3FF2-4F81-B9DF-14D7625570CF\n    ====================================================\n    APFS Container Reference:     disk3\n    Size (Capacity Ceiling):      499898105856 B (499.9 GB)\n    Capacity In Use By Volumes:   27490463744 B (27.5 GB) (5.5% used)\n    Capacity Not Allocated:       472407642112 B (472.4 GB) (94.5% free)\n    |\n    +-< Physical Store disk2s2 C586BA38-5AC2-4FA5-B915-6A5AB52530FF\n    |   -----------------------------------------------------------\n    |   APFS Physical Store Disk:   disk2s2\n    |   Size:                       499898105856 B (499.9 GB)\n    |\n    +-> Volume disk3s1 3278C2B2-F51A-42BB-91D5-D451BC6A9DF6\n    |   ---------------------------------------------------\n    |   APFS Volume Disk (Role):   disk3s1 (Data)\n    |   Name:                      macOS -

Evidently, part of the node has been zeroed-out, leading to some or all of the dentries for /Users/jivan being inaccessible.\nI developed some tools to inspect the APFS container, in the hopes that older versions of the object map and other file-system structures were intact (as referenced by an older APFS transaction), thereby allowing me to access my files. Using these tools, I indeed found that a few nodes in the file-system root B-tree for my main APFS volume had been zeroed out. Thanks to APFS's copy-on-write/transaction-based behaviour, I was able to search the entire disk for older versions of these missing nodes, and successfully found recent instances of them — except for the particular leaf node that contains the file-system records for /Users/jivan, so its contents cannot be directly determined. Just my luck(!) However, I was able to see that /Users/jivan had an ID of 0xb54a8, and thus search for nodes which contained dentries for items whose parent ID was also 0xb54a8; these nodes were then the ones which listed the contents of /Users/jivan.\nIn order to more easily do an automated recovery, I reconstructed the missing internal node of the file-system B-tree, and then used my apfs-recover tool to actually get each file. For example, to recover /Users/jivan/Documents/my file.pdf, I can do:\napfs-recover /dev/disk2s2 0 \"/Users/jivan/Documents/my file.pdf\" > \"~/Desktop/my file.pdf\"\n\nRather than run such a command for each file, I wrote a Bash script, pull.sh, which, when given a target recovery directory and a file which lists paths to files to attempt to recover, runs apfs-recover for each such filepath and outputs the result to a corresponding path in the recovery directory. For example, if the contents of filepaths.txt are\n/Users/jivan/Documents/my doc.pdf\n/Users/jivan/Pictures/my pic.jpg\n\nthen running pull.sh ~/Desktop/RECOVERY filepaths.txt recovers the files to the following paths:\n~/Desktop/RECOVERY/Users/jivan/Documents/my doc.pdf\n~/Desktop/RECOVERY/Users/jivan/Pictures/my pic.jpg\n\nI added the desired entries in filepaths.txt with some programmatic assistance, and was then able to successfully recover the vast majority of my files. For any particularly important files which this script fails to recover (due to bugs in the software I've written or additional malformed/missing APFS structures on the affected disk) I'll have to dig deeper, but this is effectively solved now.\nAll tools mentioned are available in the Git repo.\n", "Q: What pointing devices can be used with iPadOS 13?

It's slower than 3D Touch, pops up and distracts me when my finger rests on the screen and provides no functionality I didn't already have.\nIs the only way to get rid of Haptic Touch to restore from backup to iOS12?\nAm I missing something about Haptic Touch?  It seemed like a UI hack to allow 3D Touch features on budget iPhones, but for some reason was forced on everything?\nFor those searching on this:\n\"3D Touch\" is used by pressing hard on the screen, e.g., in text areas, you can press hard on the keyboard and move a cursor around, pressing hard again to select words, sentences or dragging out a precise selection with only your thumb.\n\"Haptic Touch\" is used by resting your finger on the screen and waiting until there's a vibration.  E.g., the keyboard cursor can be activated by resting your thumb on the space bar then dragged around the text.  You select by touching the screen with a second finger (without removing your first finger from the screen... you'll need two hands) then dragging one of your fingers to expand the selection.\n\nUpdate: Tried 13.2, it's still not possible to disable only Haptic Touch in the settings menu.\nI've submitted a feature request here, if you're in the same boat, please do the same: https://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html\n\nA: Apple discontinued 3D Touch in iOS devices starting with iOS 13.  3D Touch relied on special screen hardware to determine the amount of pressure being applied.  Newer iPhones (anything after the iPhone XS and its variants)  do not have that type of screen.\nThe only way to return to 3D Touch on older devices with pressure-sensitive screens is to revert back to an older iOS version.\nThere's no way turn off Haptic Touch on iOS 13 (the latest iOS version as of now).  You can adjust the sensitivity and duration by going to Settings -> Accessibility -> Touch -> 3D & Haptic Touch.  You can turn 3D Touch on and off here.\n\nFrom here you can adjust the \"Touch Duration\" to see if that helps you.\n", "Q: Can Safari (iPad iOS 12.4.2) be configured to utilize SSH-Tunnel / Port Forwarding? Goal: from WAN, SSH-tunnel to home router (outfitted with SSH) and access remote LAN devices with iPad's web browser.\nAs I understand it, a SSH-tunnel (connection) must be established first, which I imagine would require an App?  The Ubuntu equivalent being:\nssh -f -N admin@server1.example.com -L 8080: server1.example.com:3000\n\nUnless the app routes all web browser (port 80?) traffic through its tunnel, then there would need to be a setting in the browser that enable a tunnel proxy?\nWhat are today's options? Solution preference is for simplicity & low-cost.  Simplicity comprises avoiding jail-break.\n\nA: I don’t recommend using software for ssh tunnels since it’s less efficient than a VPN connection, but here are a list of software and options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Which options exist for SSH tunneling clients on iOS?\nApple doesn't enable an sshd process on iOS so you'll need to alter or add software to accomplish this if you can't just set up a web proxy in the cloud or on a more traditional server and point your iOS device to that web proxy or ssh tunnel on an OS that presumes wall power.\n", "Q: Where can I find a printable keyboard layout when the option key is pressed?

I have noticed that you can see the layout from Sys preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources > press the option key, but the image is too small and to be honest I do not know how to take a screenshot while pressing the option key.\nDo you have any suggestion or good image?\n\nA: Use Keyboard Viewer to see the keyboard instead of sys preferences.\nUse the Grab app or the Screenshot app in Applications/Utilities to take a picture of it.\n", "Q: Apple Music streaming subscription - add own CDs? I have one question concerning the Apple Music subscription. I have a largish collection of ripped CDs which I would like to add to my Album section in Music.

I only want them as streaming and not as the music matching service from apple (if it still exists).\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I found an answer. If I add the albums on y Mac running Catalena to the Music library, they will be synced to the other devices for streaming.\n", "Q: How to crop 4:5 using the Photos app After the latest updates (iOS 13), I can't find a native to crop a vertical image to 4:5 — I need that to upload photos on Instagram.\nWhat's the alternative?\n\nA: If you choose the crop tool in the Photos app, and then tap the crop presets button at the top right (looks like solid rectangle in another rectangle), you get some presets: Original, Freeform, Square, 9:16, 8:10, 5:7, etc.\nBut you want 4:5?\nJust use 8:10. 4:5 = 8:10, right?\n", "Q: Mac mini hangs on Apple logo after Mojave 10.14.6 Update 2 My mac mini (model Late 2012) worked fine until I installed the \"Mojave 10.14.6 Update 2\" security fix today.  After the automatic reboot (required for the update), the boot process hangs after displaying the Apple logo.  (There is no progress bar showing up below the logo.)\nI already tried resetting the SMC, but that didn't change anything.  Booting into \"Internet recovery mode\" worked and I could run \"First aid\" over the harddisk, but that didn't fix the problem.\nWhen I boot in verbose mode (Cmd-V), I see the message\nAttempting system restart...MACH Reboot\nAttempting system restart...MACH Reboot\nAttempting system restart...MACH Reboot\nAttempting system restart...MACH Reboot\nAttempting system restart...MACH Reboot\nAttempting system restart...MACH Reboot\n\nrepeated endlessly, after a few kernel traces WRT corekrypto.kext.\nUnfortunately, I don't have a time machine backup of this Mac.  \nHow can I recover my system?  Is there a way to boot of an installation medium and recovery the system without having to reinstall everything?\nThanks a lot for your help!\n[EDIT:] I managed to take a video of the boot log.  The first error reported is a kernel panic with message \"FIPS Kernel POST Failed [...] corekrypto_kext.  \nWhy did the security upgrade leave the system in this state and how can I fix this without having to reinstall everything?\n[EDIT 2:] I just found this issue on the net: https://eclecticlight.co/2019/10/18/beware-apple-security-certificates-after-24-october-they-may-have-expired/  Could this be the problem I'm facing?  How can I fix the certificate?\n\nA: Newer hardware can boot to internet recovery and attach an external drive to copy files off.\nIf you can boot to a recovery partition on that HDD - that would be the fastest method. Otherwise, you’d need to boot your Mini in target disk mode or bring an external bootable OS to it to copy files off before erasing it.\n\nA: The problem was caused by third party kexts.  To fix it, I booted the system in safety mode and removed all third party kexts from /Library/Extensions.  \nAfter that, the system bootet normally and finished the upgrade process.  Now everything is working perfectly.\n", "Q: Delete key inserts a space on Python interpreter after upgrading to Catalina I recently upgraded to Catalina  on my Macbook Pro (2015) and have this bizarre issue:\nIf I open up the Python interpreter in Terminal, I am able to type normally except for when I press the delete key. When I do that, it inserts a space.  This persists across all my Conda environments, as well as native Python installation.\nI tried restarting, and plugging in an external keyboard, and the issue persists.\nThe delete key seems to work normally on everything else I've tried. It also works on my shell (zsh) and on interpreters for other languages. \nHas anyone else run into this issue?\n\nA: So after some further testing, it looked like it was an issue with only certain virtual environments that I was using that I had reconfigured by following the guide on anaconda:\nhttps://www.anaconda.com/how-to-restore-anaconda-after-macos-catalina-update/\nMy system python had also been set to the conda one by default by this, which was why I was getting the issue. \nI just ended up creating a new environment and reinstalling all my packages.\n", "Q: Is this prompt for iCloud credentials legit? So recently I bought Ethernet Status and activated the full version for an added €2.29 ($1.99 I guess...) and activated the full features.

Just click \"Restore Purchase\", right?\n\nAnd then it hits me... \n\nThis is no native Apple UI, is it? How can I be sure it's not just the app trying to trick me into entering my AppStore password? Who's to say it won't send my entered credentials to the maker (or anyone, for that matter)?\nI entered an incorrect(!) password while I let WireShark watch over my shoulder; hoping I could see something fishy. But I couldn't find anything proving either way; no direct link to Apple and no direct link elsewhere. A bunch of IP's, a lot of traffic (tried to close as much applications as I could) and most, if not all, of it encrypted with SSL. Nothing of interest to see actually and the amount of data is a bit too overwhelming for me to make sense of it.\nCould anyone confirm or disprove my suspicions? Any advise (besides not entering my actual password in that UI)? I may have even entered my AppStore password when I initially installed and immediately upgraded; thank god I also use 2FA and I have changed my password moments ago just to err on the safe side. So now I'm left with an app that I suddenly don't trust (which may be unjust!) and not sure if I should go ahead...\n\nA: Apparently, starting and logging into iTunes and going to the Account -> View my account -> All purchases , as ankii mentioned:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't see your in-app purchases\n\n*See your purchase history on your computer\nWhen you go back to Ethernet Status and then click \"Restore Purchase\" you're already logged in to iTunes and it doesn't prompt for credentials. Problem solved!\nAlso: Enable 2FA. That's not only a good idea for Apple/iCloud but it always is, everywhere. Whenever 2FA is supported, enable it!. It may be a pain in the behind at times, but the alternative, a hacked account, will be much, much worse.\n", "Q: Unable to Boot into Mac OS X after installing Ubuntu First thing first, my MacBook Air partitioned into Ubuntu (30Gb) and OS X(91.2 Gb) was working fine until it started draining huge battery, lagging intensely and heating up. I figured out that this is probably due to some background process going on so tried restarting it multiple times by closing 'running applications' and finally forced shutdown it and after that it again started working fine.\nThough now i can't boot into Ubuntu for some reason. Earlier, to boot into Ubuntu i had to do nothing after pressing power button, but, to boot into OS X needed to press (option key) which would only show Macintosh HD but not Ubuntu at Startup Boot menu where available options are shown.\nSince now i cant use Ubuntu and there wasn't any important data in it, I decided to re-install it. Before doing that I tried if I can consume that partition memory back into Mac by clicking on (-) sign in Disk utility but end result was 91Gb in whole partition map instead of 125Gb.\nThen i installed Ubuntu using live bootable pen-drive (pressing option key while booting), but saw no Apple logo or Macintosh HD as a startup booting option after pressing Option Key.Installation was done in the same 30Gb partition further divided into 20+5+5 for main storage, swap and root. Then I installed rEFind on Ubuntu, changed the boot order using efibootmgr. While doing this I could see that Mac OS X is there somewhere but laptop is unable to boot into it.\n\n\nBut still its not working. I did this earlier also but after booting into Ubuntu order again changed to original itself.\nWhen I keep pressing option key, blank window asking about available wireless connection comes with no option to boot into. On pressing Cmd+R, Internet recovery opens but it is unable to detect 91Gb separately, and 'First Aid' on whole 125 Gb hard drive gave no issues. Tried to use rEFIT but couldn't implement it properly.\nI tried to see available partition and result are as follows:\n\n\nWhat should I do now in order to retrieve my OS X back specially the data because its really important.

Please boot from Ubuntu live USB and add the output of the following commands to your question:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo efibootmgr -v\n\n*sudo gdisk -l /dev/sda\nIf possible, please copy–paste the output into your question rather than using screenshots.\nWhen you have done this, please add a comment to this answer so that I'm notified, then hopefully I will be able to assist further.\nUpdate on 2019-10-30\nOkay, so your boot entry Boot0001 is for rEFInd, which I suggest that you use. Do sudo efibootmgr -o 1, which will set your boot order, and then do sudo efibootmgr -n 1, which will set the desired entry to use on next boot, just in case your boot order gets magically reset to 0080,0002,0001,0000 again. Reboot, and hopefully you should be greeted with rEFInd (as seen in the screenshot here). At that point, you should hopefully be able to boot into whatever OS you want; rEFInd doesn't check your EFI boot entries, but instead scans your disk partitions to find installed OS's, so if there's a working macOS installation, it should display it. If you don't see it at first, press ESC to try re-scanning.\n\nIf you don't see the rEFInd screen, I would suggest that you re-install rEFInd, as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure that SIP (System Integrity Protection) is disabled.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into macOS recovery. Hold CMD+ALT+R on boot, and you will be greeted with a spinning globe. Connect to the Internet via a Wi-Fi network from the list you see, or plug in an Ethernet cable before you boot with CMD+ALT+R.\n\n*Once Recovery loads, choose your language if prompted, then go to Utilities in the top menu bar, then Terminal.\n\n*Enter csrutil disable, then csrutil status to check that SIP is disabled. \n\n\n*Install rEFInd from Ubuntu, since you can't boot into macOS.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from your Ubuntu live USB again.\n\n*Mount your ESP (EFI System Partition), which is /dev/sda1, to /mnt/boot, as follows. You must use /mnt/boot as the mountpoint, else the refind-install script will not function as intended.\nsudo mkdir -p /mnt/boot\nsudo mount -t msdos /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot\n\n\n\n*Download the rEFInd binary zip file from this page. You will probably need to do so over Ethernet, since the Ubuntu live OS likely won't have the necessary drivers for Wi-Fi. Alternatively, download this file to another USB beforehand, and insert that USB now.\n\n*Unzip the rEFInd file to somewhere of your choosing, and cd there in the terminal. Then run the refind-install script, specifying the parent directory of the boot directory that you mounted your ESP to, which is /mnt. For example, if you downloaded the ZIP file to the ~/Downloads folder:\ncd ~/Downloads\nunzip refind-bin-0.11.4.zip\ncd refind-bin-0.11.4\nsudo ./refind-install --root=/mnt\n\nIt may be valuable for you to save or take a photo of the refind-install output in case things don't go according to plan.\n\n\n*Hopefully, the installation went smoothly. Now unmount your ESP and reboot, and rEFInd should be working properly:\n\n\ncd /\nsudo umount /dev/sda1\nsudo reboot now\n\n\nIf none of this works as expected, you may still be able to boot into macOS by creating a rEFInd bootable USB using the \"USB flash drive image file\" from this page.\nGood luck :-)\n", "Q: iOS 13 (and web interface): Cannot share an iCloud folder I read about folder sharing feature recently added to iCloud (Can I share iCloud Drive folder with other iCloud user? and here).\nAlthough I have iOS 13+ on my phone, I still cannot share folders.

That is, please share the output of fsck_apfs -n /dev/disk2s2. This will run fsck on your APFS container, answering \"no\" to all questions (rather than -y, which answers \"yes\" to all).\nDoing so will probably provide the same output as you have already provided, but should at least get you past the progress bar you're seeing, in case there are any further issues that fsck might report.\n", "Q: pip install mysql-python throws error I am on MacOS Mojave 10.14.6 (18G103).\nWhen I try to install mysql-python it throws an error :\n$ pip install --upgrade setuptools\nRequirement already up-to-date: setuptools in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages (41.5.1)\n$ pip install mysql-python\nCollecting mysql-python\n  Using cached https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/a5/e9/51b544da85a36a68debe7a7091f068d802fc515a3a202652828c73453cad/MySQL-python-1.2.5.zip\n    Complete output from command python setup.py egg_info:\n    sh: mysql_config: command not found\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n      File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\n      File \"/private/var/folders/90/6l6jqf191f74hg282swdz5080000gn/T/pip-install-RetBjz/mysql-python/setup.py\", line 17, in <module>\n        metadata, options = get_config()\n      File \"setup_posix.py\", line 43, in get_config\n        libs = mysql_config(\"libs_r\")\n      File \"setup_posix.py\", line 25, in mysql_config\n        raise EnvironmentError(\"%s not found\" % (mysql_config.path,))\n    EnvironmentError: mysql_config not found\n\n    ----------------------------------------\nCommand \"python setup.py egg_info\" failed with error code 1 in /private/var/folders/90/6l6jqf191f74hg282swdz5080000gn/T/pip-install-RetBjz/mysql-python/\n\n\nA: You can install mysqlclient or pymysql,I prefer the latter:\n\npip install pymysql\n", "Q: Can Apple Remote Desktop control the current session without turning on the screen? Sometimes I leave work open on my iMac and need to use Screen Sharing from my Macbook to make a few changes. This works great except when my wife and baby are sleeping in that bedroom.\nI understand that using Apple Remote Desktop it's possible to open a session as a different user with a 'virtual display', showing nothing on the hardware display and (I assume) not waking it if asleep.\nThat's almost what I want, except that I want to control the existing logged-in session. If it weren't an iMac I could just physically turn the monitor off when I leave.\nCan Apple Remote Desktop control the existing session without turning the screen on? If not, is there another tool that can?\n\nA: It does in fact wake the screen, even in Curtain [privacy] mode.\nIt initially shows the regular login screen, then hides that & leaves it mainly black but with a large lock symbol & a tag as to who locked it.\nAfter you log off it briefly shows the login screen again then switches off.\n \n", "Q: Custom iOS folder icons? Is it possible to create (or copy) custom icons to replace the composite folder icon made up of microscopic versions of the icons within said folder? Iconical does this nicely for apps but it doesn’t appear to have the means to customize folders’ icons. Is there an OS way or third party tool that allows for this?\nI was thinking maybe a long way would be to make a shortcut which functioned like a folder but that seems clunky to set up and use. I’m hoping some smarty-pants has come up with a more elegant solution.\n\nA: No, there isn't a way to do this with the stock iOS (any version).\nThe only way you can do this, and I've never tried it but I've read about it, is by jailbreaking the device first.  \nYou've already discovered the workaround which is to create a shortcut to an app that's within a folder. \nUntil Apple allows this level of customization, you will not be able to change the looks of folders.\n", "Q: Message effects no longer work on my iPhone So I’m not sure if this is due to iOS 13.2 or not because I’ve only just realized that I’m not getting message effects, those bubble messages or the balloons, pew pew lasers people can send you and which you can send.\n\n\n*\n\n*I did update my iPhone today from iOS 12.4.2 to iOS 13.2\n\n*I’ve already tried rebooting my phone.\n\n\nIs there a way to fix this?\n\nA: There are settings that can enable or disable these. Even if you don't recall selecting this - checking that you're enabled would be a good first step.\n\nMy guess is at some point you enabled (intentionally or otherwise) the Reduce Motion option in your settings.\nTo check this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > Accessibility\n\n*At the top, if Reduce Motion is enabled then the following effects won’t work at all:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bubble effects\n\n*Full-screen effects\n\n\n*The other setting you can check on this screen is the Auto-Play Message Effects option.

I visited apps.apple.com while logged in and I see the ratings but I can't review. Is this possible to review an iPhone app from browser? It's very annoying (at the limit of mental breakdown) to write a proper review form a mobile device.\n\nA: No, it's not something Apple puts up a web interface to allow reviews off device.\nHowever, you can connect any USB keyboard to your iOS device using a USB adapter and most bluetooth keyboards work very well if you have one handy to try pairing.\nI too find myself longing for a proper keyboard when writing due to years of habit forming. Bringing your preferred tool to iOS makes it much easier to compose even with the small screen in my experience.\nWorst case, pen your review in iCloud version of notes / pages / wherever and save the text to the device so it can sync over or just be there on the storage and copy/paste if you can't find a better workaround.\n", "Q: Catalina: Instruments with Full Disk Access I am trying to use Instruments on my laptop, but it seems that after updating to Catalina, it cannot access my Documents folder:\n\nI have given access to the application, Full Disk Access, but it does not work (I even shut down the laptop and restarted it, and also checked for errors with Disk Utility).\n\nAm I missing something?\n\nA: In Xcode you may start using Instruments with Xcode -> Services -> Toggle Instruments Recording. \nThis will trigger a chain of settings events inside OSX.

I'm seeing 5 processes with network activity ( sending/receiving bytes ). I'm not sure whether these are normal occurrences?\nList of processes\n\n\n*\n\n*apsd\n\n*ntpd\n\n*mDNSResponder\n\n*trustd\n\n*netbiosd\n\n\nI researched a few of those and some were associated to file sharing via windows or bonjour, however I don't have any other PCs on my network to even begin sharing files with. \n\nA: apsd - Used for FaceTime push notifications\nntpd - Used to synchronize clock\nmDNSResponder - Part of the Bonjour protocol, used to scan your network for other Bonjour-enabled devices (printers, computers, etc...)\ntrustd - Used for validating SSL certificates\nnetbiosd - Used when interacting with Microsoft shared drives\nThis is all normal activity. However, if you are worried about security, you can disable the services you don't plan on using.\nEdit: You might not want to disable ntpd and trustd as they are necessary for basic functionality such as browsing websites.\n\nA: Originally, in Mac OS X 10.2 in 2002, the central purpose of mDNSResponder was to respond to Multicast DNS requests. Nowadays mDNSResponder is responsible for Unicast DNS as well as Multicast DNS, for both hostname lookups and service discovery. It also manages other networking functions, like “Wake for network access”. Disabling mDNSResponder would break a number of networking functions, not least the ability to use DNS hostnames in URLs when using a web browser, and would most likely render the device unbootable.\n", "Q: How to view download progress while Finder downloads new iOS version? In macOS Catalina, the iOS devices are synced and updated using the Finder instead of iTunes.\nIs there a way to see the progress of the iOS-download in Finder?\n\nA: Unfortunately there's no immediate way.\nBut see this article: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250790312\n\nWhile there is no progress bar available, one potential way to estimate the progress is through Terminal, with the following command:\nls -lhrt ~/Library/iTunes/iPhone\\ Software\\ Updates\n\nIt will show the size of the current (.ipsw.download) and all previous (.ipsw) update files, which can be used to estimate progress. For example, for a 2.9G update file (can be estimated using previous update files), if we see that the current update file size is 2.3G, then the progress would be approximately 2.3G / 2.9G = 79%. By running the above command periodically, we can somewhat know how long it may still take (or at least the downloading is still in progress and not stopped because of network or other issue).\n\n\nA: In addition to Joe Farina's answer, you can also get a rough idea of how quickly things are progressing from Activity Monitor's Network tab.\nLook for AMPDecivesAgent, which should show you how much that process has downloaded. This is probably ** (but not guaranteed) how much of the latest update you're downloading has downloaded. \n\nIf you're not downloading lots of other things, you can also see the speed of your download at the bottom of the activity monitor (in blue in the image below).\n\n** Note that this is actually the total downloaded by that process, so if you're downloading multiple updates or have recently downloaded an update, that will be included in this number. \n", "Q: \"About this Mac\" and \"System Information\" no longer working I am trying to find out my OS version. \nThe problem I however encounter is that the usual means of finding this out no longer work.\nSelecting \"About this Mac\" from the top left does not display anything.\nCMD+Space, then \"System Information\" results in the System Information App being found, but it does not display anything either. It fails silently. \nAre there any other things I can do? \n\nA: When system information is unable to render the macOS version, I would connect a drive and back everything up as soon as you can or power off the mac and get troubleshooting help if you have files that are not backed up.\nThat out of the way, it’s probably something that can be worked, but why risk photos and other data that are not backed up when you know things are failing that should be rock solid.\nOpen terminal app (Applications / Utilities) and type:\nsw_vers\n\nThat will report the last installation of your system software so you can take next steps. I would not install any updates or every restart if you have valuable data that might be able to be copied out of caution and not out of likelihood that you’re about to have more serious problems. Good luck and once you have those details - feel free to ask some follow on questions as you need more help.\nOnce you have a backup, you can boot to internet recovery and reinstall the version of MacOS you please. That will drop a new build of macos, all the tools and give you a start on what else might be broken or need looking in to with an install log that will have specific failure messages or your system will be healed.\n", "Q: More than 120 GB Hidden space in Mojave My mac is eating up all free space and I have no clue where it's coming from.  I have used tools like DaisyDisk or OmniDiskSweeper to find any folder/files which might be taking this space, but there are none. Only DaisyDisk is able to see there is 120GB of Hidden space but since I'm using the free trail I'm unable to see what that is. \nHere is what I've done so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable TimeMachine\n\n*Delete local snapshots\n\n*Checked for mobile backups\n\n*Checked for hibernate file\n\n*Re-index spotlight\n\n*Find big files/folder with tools like DaisyDisk\n\n*Check for errors with first aid in disk utility\n\n\nAll without luck. I've read similar topics on this and tried all what I could find.

Download the stand-alone version (https://daisydiskapp.com/downloads/DaisyDisk.zip), it has more features. Then use the \"Scan as Administrator\" command to reveal the hidden space. Also before scanning make sure you grant DaisyDisk \"full disk access\", if you're on Mojave or Catalina. To do this, go to DaisyDisk Preferences > Full Disk Access tab and proceed with drag-and-dropping as instructed there.\n\nA: Didn't find a solution for this, and since my macbook basically was useless because no space was available anymore I did a clean install \n", "Q: External microphone audio recording on MacBook Pro Mid-2015 I'm trying to use a RØDE smartLav+ Lavalier microphone with my MacBook Pro.\nThe MBP is a Retina Mid-2015 (running macOS 10.14.6) and has a single port for both audio output (headphones) and input (microphone).\nThe microphone has a TRRS connector (audio jack) identical to the iPhone's headphones with microphone.\nIf I plug the iPhone's headphones into the mac it recognizes a microphone is present; I can see that in System Preferences > Sound: sound input is \"External Microphone\".\nIf I plug the RØDE microphone it is not detected: sound input remains \"Integrated Microphone\"\nInteresting enought if plug the RØDE microphone into an iPhone it  does record audio.\nFinally this microphone is detected by Mid-2012 MacBook Pro (by plugging it in the headphones port, not the microphone port; the 2012 has both)\n\nIs there anything I can do to let my Mid-2015 MPB recognize the RØDE microphone and let me record from it?\n\nA: I got in touch with RØDE support that replied\n\nSmartLav+ is not compatible with the newer (2015 - onwards) models of\n  the Macbook as it has a different threshold for it's input recognition\n  compared to a smartphone or tablet device\n\nActually compatibility with MacBook Pro (or laptops) is not mentioned in their product's specification sheet, it's designed for smarphones and tablets.\nIt turns out that the MacBook Pro 2015 audio port is not compatible with many microphones despite the TRRS audio jack.\n\nFor anyone that experience this issue I suggest doing the recording with a iPhone (put it in Airplane Mode during the session) then sending the audio file to the mac via iCloud drive. \n", "Q: How to connect MacPro 2013 Thunderbolt 2 to USB C I see several posts about USB-C and TB-3 to TB-2 but are they reversible? As I cannot find a TB-2 to USB-3 device I thought maybe I could connect my MacPro (Late 2013) to a USB-C hub which has USB-3 ports. My primary purpose is to access storage devices not displays. \nHow can one go from TB-2 to USB-C or USB-3?\n\nA: You need a thunderbolt dock to convert the embedded USB signal when carried over thunderbolt 2. \nThey are not reversible either in a meaningful way. \nOnce TB2 is present you can use the TB3 to TB2 adapter bidirectionally. \nWhy not use the USB A ports to connect USB C?\n", "Q: Why does \"diskutil eraseVolume ...\" add an extra \"Apple_Free\" partition My question is about why \"diskutil eraseVolume\" adds an extra partition to an APM partition table.\nA little history will help understand the situation better I think -- had a 240GB APM style disk on an old PowerBook system that I wanted to upgrade to a larger disk. The PowerBook has some heat related problems and the video goes bad after about 1-2 hours, so wanted to do all this work on another Mac that runs High Sierra, in case the video went bad during the reconstruction on the old PowerBook. \nSo, basically used \"dd\" command to clone the entire old 240GB disk to the new 500GB disk, then modified the partition table to correct the total size of disk and size of last partition to compensate for the larger disk, knowing that would need to erase that last HFS+ partition as it's no longer valid. But first, wanted to use \"diskutil verifyVolume ...\" command to check all the various filesystems and discovered that besides the last MacOS volume the xxxxx volume was also no longer correct.\nSo, no problem I think -- will erase the last two volumes and restore from a backup image and all should be fine. Here is what the partition table started out as on the 500GB disk:\n==================================pdisk \"p\" command output============\nPartition map (with 512 byte blocks) on '/dev/rdisk6'\n #:                type name               length   base      ( size )\n 1: Apple_partition_map Apple                  63 @ 1        \n 2:      Apple_Driver43*Macintosh              56 @ 64       \n 3:      Apple_Driver43*Macintosh              56 @ 120      \n 4:    Apple_Driver_ATA*Macintosh              56 @ 176      \n 5:    Apple_Driver_ATA*Macintosh              56 @ 232      \n 6:      Apple_FWDriver Macintosh             512 @ 288      \n 7:  Apple_Driver_IOKit Macintosh             512 @ 800      \n 8:       Apple_Patches Patch Partition       512 @ 1312     \n 9:           Apple_HFS MacOS 10.0       64039712 @ 1824      ( 30.5G)\n10:           Apple_HFS MacOS 10.1       64039712 @ 64041536  ( 30.5G)\n11:           Apple_HFS MacOS 10.2       64039712 @ 128081248 ( 30.5G)\n12:           Apple_HFS MacOS 10.3       64039712 @ 192120960 ( 30.5G)\n13:           Apple_HFS MacOS 10.4       64039712 @ 256160672 ( 30.5G)\n14:           Apple_HFS xxxxx            64039712 @ 320200384 ( 30.5G)\n15:           Apple_HFS MacOS           592532992 @ 384240096 (282.5G)\n16:          Apple_Free Extra                  80 @ 976773088\n\nDevice block size=512, Number of Blocks=976773168 (465.8G)\nDeviceType=0x0, DeviceId=0x0\nDrivers-\n1:  23 @ 64, type=0x1\n2:  36 @ 120, type=0xffff\n3:  21 @ 176, type=0x701\n4:  34 @ 232, type=0xf8ff\n======================================================================\n\nI used the command \"diskutil eraseVolume HFS+ xxxxx /dev/rdisk6s14\" (can't use the GUI Disk Utility program to erase an HFS+, non-journaled, filesystem as that is apparently no longer supported on High Sierra version of Disk Utility.app GUI application) and the partition table had been modified to include a new \"Apple_Free\" partition right before the \"xxxxx\" partition:\n==================================pdisk \"p\" command output===========================\nPartition map (with 512 byte blocks) on '/dev/disk6'\n #:                type name               length   base      ( size )\n 1: Apple_partition_map Apple                  63 @ 1        \n 2:      Apple_Driver43*Macintosh              56 @ 64       \n 3:      Apple_Driver43*Macintosh              56 @ 120      \n 4:    Apple_Driver_ATA*Macintosh              56 @ 176      \n 5:    Apple_Driver_ATA*Macintosh              56 @ 232      \n 6:      Apple_FWDriver Macintosh             512 @ 288      \n 7:  Apple_Driver_IOKit Macintosh             512 @ 800      \n 8:       Apple_Patches Patch Partition       512 @ 1312     \n 9:           Apple_HFS MacOS 10.0       64039712 @ 1824      ( 30.5G)\n10:           Apple_HFS MacOS 10.1       64039712 @ 64041536  ( 30.5G)\n11:           Apple_HFS MacOS 10.2       64039712 @ 128081248 ( 30.5G)\n12:           Apple_HFS MacOS 10.3       64039712 @ 192120960 ( 30.5G)\n13:           Apple_HFS MacOS 10.4       64039712 @ 256160672 ( 30.5G)\n14:          Apple_Free                    262144 @ 320200384 (128.0M)\n15:           Apple_HFS xxxxx            63777568 @ 320462528 ( 30.4G)\n16:           Apple_HFS MacOS           592532992 @ 384240096 (282.5G)\n17:          Apple_Free                        80 @ 976773088\n\nDevice block size=512, Number of Blocks=976773168 (465.8G)\nDeviceType=0x0, DeviceId=0x0\nDrivers-\n1:  23 @ 64, type=0x1\n2:  36 @ 120, type=0xffff\n3:  21 @ 176, type=0x701\n4:  34 @ 232, type=0xf8ff\n===============================================================================\n\nSo, why the new \"Apple_Free\" partition right before the real \"xxxxx\" HFS+ partition?

Thanks...\n\nA: Instead of diskutil, try using newfs_hfs to create the filesystems.  I don't know what happens in Mac OS, but in my experience, the newfs_* commands in BSD create a filesystem in a partition without changing the partition map.\nI don't know why Apple likes to reserve 128 megabytes of free space before an HFS partition.  I saw this in my PowerBook G4, when I used the Disk Utility from Mac OS X 10.4 to format my internal hard disk, and it put 128M of Apple_Free (partition 2) between the Apple_partition_map (partition 1) and my Apple_HFS (partition 3).  I guess that one can use part of the 128M to add Mac OS 9 drivers for the disk.\nYour disk already has Mac OS 9 drivers (Apple_*Driver* and Apple_Patches), so I don't know why it would need 128M of Apple_Free.  I speculate that your disk might have IDE drivers but not FireWire drivers.  If you would boot your PowerBook in FireWire disk mode, and connect it to some Mac OS 9 machine, then you might need some Apple_Free space to add more drivers; but I never had FireWire hard disks, so I don't know.\n", "Q: How Can I control my Office Mac with my Home Mac? How Can I control my Office Mac with my Home Mac?\nBoth Macs are in different networks. So with the default setting they don't see each other.\n\nA: There are a number of alternatives, but they depend somewhat upon how your networks are configured. Generally I would assume that a work network would be fairly “locked down”.\nThe Ideal Case (which seldom works)\nAssuming two “open” networks, you’d need to make sure that, on the Office Mac, you have gone to System Preferences » Sharing » and enable either Screen Sharing (at least) or Remote Management (at most).\nRemote Management includes a number of options in addition to screen sharing.\nIf possible, I would also recommend enabling “Remote Login” on the work Mac. That will allow you to connect via SSH, which you can sometimes do while screen sharing for increased security.\nBut then you need to know how to connect to the Office Mac, which would require \"port forwarding on the office network.\nWhich you are unlikely to have or be able to get in most places.\nWhich brings me to my other suggestions.\nThe Common Alternatives\nRather than deal with all of that, there are various programs out there which will try to make the process simpler by installing a \"helper\" application on the Office Mac, and then using a related app on your Home Mac.\nI will mention two that I have used and can recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*Screens and Screens Connect\n\n*Jump Desktop and Jump Desktop Connect\nBoth of these apps are very good. Screens is more well-known, I believe, but I have started using Jump Desktop and found it to be every bit as good if not somewhat better. If you have a\nSetapp subscription, both apps are included. If you don't, both apps have trial versions available.\nThe idea is the same with both: install the \"Connect\" app on your Office Mac. Run it, walk through the configuration process, etc. Then make sure that it is still running when you head home. If you run into errors here, it's probably because your work network is locked down to the point that won't allow it to work. That would not surprise me at all. In fact, I'd be more surprised if it works.\nBut, assuming that it does work, install the other app on your Home Mac, and use the same login/configuration information that you used when setting up your Office Mac.\nIf your Office Mac network is allowing the connection, you ought to be able to see, connect, and log in to your Office Mac from your home Mac.\n", "Q: Manually start Time Machine backup without menu bar icon The only way I know how to manually start a Time Machine backup is by showing the Time Machine menu bar icon (by enabling that option in System Preferences), and then choosing \"Start Backup\" from the menu bar icon's menu.\nHow can I manually start a backup without having to use the menu bar icon?\n\nA: If you'd prefer not to have or use Time Machine from its icon on the menu bar, it can be started/stopped, and more, via Terminal, e.g.:\ntmutil startbackup\n\nOr:\ntmutil stopbackup\n\nThe startbackup verb also can take options, i.e:\ntmutil startbackup [-a | --auto] [-b | --block] [-r | --rotation] [-d | --destination dest_id]\n\nHave a look at its manual page: man tmutil\n", "Q: Turning on FileVault with a symlinked directory Running Mojave (10.14.6). There's not enough room on my SSD for my Music, Pictures, and Movies. I have those on an external drive. I have not yet turned on FileVault. If I create symlinks for those folders in my home directory on the SSD pointing to the external drive, will there be any issue when I turn on FileVault? Will only the SSD folders get encrypted, or also the symlinked folders? And related question: will Time Machine automatically include those symlinked folders?\nI've seen elsewhere the advice to just move the entire home folder to the external drive, but I want to keep it on the SSD to speed app launching (among other things).\n\nA: FileVault only encrypts one volume so hard links and firm links are encrypted (but firm links are portals to another volume which isn’t necessarily encrypted). Symbolic links exist on the volume and are encrypted, but their destination files are not encrypted - just the link to the other file is encrypted.\nYour plan to move some folders off is just fine, solid technically and you can encrypt both volumes using FileVault and keep everything encrypted at rest - just that there are two different volumes with different keys and you choose if you use the same or different pass phrases for both.\n", "Q: How do I start the docker daemon on macOS?

I have a weird trackpad issue on my 15\" 2018 Macbook Pro since a few days now. I suspect it's caused by a swollen battery, but I'm not totally sure. \nHere is the issue,:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Force Click almost never works, if it does it's only for a few minutes after booting in the morning  \n\n*right click (two fingers click) works fine for a little while after start up then stops working on part or the trackpad after a while\n\n*the longer I use the computer the larger the area where I can't right click gets, starting from the upper middle and extending downwards\n\n*after a few hours I can only right-click  on the sides and bottom third of the trackpad and sometimes even a single click (one finger click) doesn't work on the upper middle of the trackpad\n\n\nGiven that the issue worsens depending on how long I use the computer I think it's a hardware and not software issue.\nSMC and NVRAM + PRAM reset didn't help. \nI have then noticed that my battery might be swollen, at least the bottom of the device is as pressing lightly on the lower right side makes the upper left rubber side lift by a few millimeters, same for the other side.\nTo be clear, the trackpad itself seems perfectly flat, but the underside of the computer seems swollen. \nHowever I'm not totally convinced it is the battery as System Report seems to consider it healthy.\nFurthermore, I'm not sure a swollen battery could affect the trackpad, as if I understand it correctly, on newer trackpads the clicks aren't mechanical but generated by pressure sensors. \nI can't get my computer to an Apple Authorized Service Provider (no official Apple Store in my area) before a few days/a week and also went out of warranty about 2 month ago.\nSo I'm turning to stack exchange to have an opinion on the issue and see if the device is still safe to use for a little while, as apparently swollen batteries are potentially dangerous. \n\nA: We can only speculate wether the issue is caused by the swollen battery.\nHOWEVER\nA swollen battery can be a hazard and should be swapped either way.\nApple offers extra warranty for batteries that are swollen (2-3 years from purchase depending on the device). An AASP (Apple Authorized Service Provider) should be able to swap the Top Case (which will include the battery as well as the trackpad) under the extended warranty free of charge.\n", "Q: How to remove annoying iCloud nagging in Catalina?

These kinds of obscure requirements generally go away when APFS is used. \nHere is how I determined the correct value was 15887144s. The sector size is 512 bytes. So 134,217,728 bytes is 262,144 sectors and 8,000,000,000 bytes is 15,625,000 sectors. Add these two values together and you will get 15,887,144 sectors. \nThe amount of free space, between each partition, can be determined from the output of the command given below. This is how I came up with the value of 262,144 sectors.\ngpt -r show /dev/disk2\n\nThe sector size can be found by entering the command given below.\ndiskutil info disk2 | grep \"Block Size\"\n\nAlso, if the output from the gpt -r show /dev/disk2 command shows a Pri GPT table size of 32 sectors, then the sector size is 512 bytes. Otherwise, you can assume a sector size of 4096 bytes.\n", "Q: \"cron\" processes spawning and piling up, but no crontab EDIT: I solved this, so see below for my own answer. While the bounty asks for a fix to the problem, I'd like to award it to someone who can explain why a cron process that ran for 6 years over multiple MacOS versions suddenly became a problem in Catalina.\nFirst note, this is not a duplicate of \"cron\" processes piling up because I don't have active crontabs on my computer. Cron processes spawn, but they never finish, so they just keep piling up. I'm running MacOS Catalina 10.15.1\nCron jobs are spawning every couple of minutes and never dying. The oldest cron process always has a parent process \"launchd\", and I've searched for populated crontabs and can't find any. If I let this go on long enough, eventually I run into a scenario where I have hundreds of running cron processes and everything on my computer grinds to a halt, and I can't even open new apps (I get cryptic messages like \".app cannot be opened\" when I try to open an app). My only solution at this point has been to keep activity monitor open and periodically killing off all active cron processes.\nI've been able to create a new user account that seems to be immune from this issue. However, as soon as I logged into my apple ID on that account to set up iCloud drive, the problem started with that account, too. I logged out of my Apple ID and attempted uninstall iCloud drive, but the problem persisted. Clean installs of Catalina don't clear up the problem, I've reset SMC and PRAM multiple times, and repairing permissions (via this https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203538). I've also ensured that cron has full disk access (via this https://blog.bejarano.io/fixing-cron-jobs-in-mojave/). I'm at a dead end with trying to troubleshoot this problem.\nI'm not sure it's related, but my \"system.log\" file seems to get spammed the following few lines:\n<redacted> AMPDeviceDiscoveryAgent[2132]: Entered:_AMMuxedDeviceDisconnected, mux-device:63\n<redacted> AMPDeviceDiscoveryAgent[2132]: Entered:__thr_AMMuxedDeviceDisconnected, mux-device:63\n<redacted> AMPDeviceDiscoveryAgent[2132]: tid:9a27 - Mux ID not found in mapping dictionary\n\nANY help is appreciated.\n\nA: So I found a relevant answer here:\nCron job keeps running, not in any crontabs\nI don't think this question should be removed because this seems to be relevant to Catalina, even though it seems to be user error.\nExplanation:\nThe root crontab had been edited at some point, with cron jobs that I created 6 years ago on my computer (I may have done this before learning that was a bad idea). This crontab had two lines that each referenced a script that was supposed to run every minute. Neither one of these referenced existing locations on my drive, and for whatever reason cron wouldn't exit after attempting to run them.\nThis problem never manifested before upgrading to Catalina, but I don't know why that is - either cron was running every minute for the last 6 years and the Catalina update semi-broke cron, or something got copied to the root cron file. Probably the former problem, which would be a PIBCAK scenario combined with typical Catalina issues.\nThe solution was to edit the root-owned crontab to remove the two offending lines, and boom, the problem is gone!\nI created a new user crontab for testing, and this leaves one persistent cron job (with parent = launchd), but the rest of the cron jobs that I run will exit predictably and not suck up resources. Cron itself doesn't seem to be broken, but root-run cron jobs may be problematic. (EDIT: I deleted the root crontab and now activity monitor doesn't show any cron processes running - I'm mystified as to why this happened with only certain user accounts, since none of this happened at the user level)\n\nA: This happened to me as well right after after upgrading to macOS Catalina. It took me a while to figure out why this was happening, and I am still not completely sure. I had three cronjobs in the root crontab that would wget some scripts. While they did exist, this still lead too an excessive amount of unterminated cron processes. I am now using LaunchDaemons along with curl to call the same HTTP urls, and this works without any issue.\nBut, and that we have in common, those cron jobs did work on Mojave and all previous versions without driving my Macbook to the process limit.\n\nA: On Catalina it created so much cron processes it did hit the limit. I deleted root crontab, but it did not solved the problem. Than I realised I had crontab under my normal user. So I deleted that one too (crontab -r) and it did solve the problem. Now I have only one cron process runing...\nNotice this problem started only after Catalina ugrade.\n", "Q: Is there a way to configure the behaviour of cmd + tab to not wait until they get released? To best demonstrate the behaviour I'm looking for, just see how Chrome behaves if you have multiple tabs open in the window, and press control + tab.\nSo it doesn't wait until you release control, it immediately switches the window. Is there a way to get the same in mac while switching between applications with command + tab?\n\nA: Pressing CMD` cycles through windows of the current App immediately.\nNo need to release the keys to select the window.\nSome of the 3rd party apps listed here might get you the same solution for App switching:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/193922/is-there-any-program-or-way-to-make-mac-os-xs-tab-behave-like-windows-alt-ta \n", "Q: Can you install NPM and Git under a standard user account? Currently all users in my environment run as standard users.  We now have developers starting that will need access to tools such as NPM and Git.\nIs it possible to install these tools and limit to the user account?\nThe installers/packages appear to install globally which would imply they would also need sudo access.\n\nA: I have never had to invoke sudo when using git, besides during the install process.\nFor npm, you can configure it to install global packages in a directory your standard user has full access to using this guide.\n", "Q: Inserting Equations in Pages - Keyboard Shortcut?

I'm having problems setting Terminal.app's default shell.  It appears to work using a command line utility which sets the shell for the account, however not in Terminal.app's dialog which is for each session.  I find that if I set the shell system with with 'chsh', the $SHELL variable in Terminal.app correctly reflects the shell.  If I change the shell in Terminal.app only, $SHELL does not correctly reflect the shell, however the shell appears to be the correct shell running.  I tried this on a temp account to rule out other interactions and it has the same behavior.\nHere is a use case:\nWhen I run in Terminal.app:\n$ chsh -s /bin/ksh\n\nand invoke Terminal.app, the shell is correctly changed:\n$ echo $SHELL\n/bin/ksh\n\nThe problem is if try similar through Terminal.app->Preferences->General->Shells open with->Command->/bin/ksh\n$ echo $SHELL\n/bin/bash\n\nYet when I try command completions with TAB, it reflects ksh behavior.\nTherefore, my suspicion is there is something overriding the SHELL environment variable where it is always SHELL=/bin/bash, despite the shell being different than that.\nDoes anyone know if Apple has a bug here?\n\nA: The following information is taken from\n\n\n*\n\n*SHELL environment variable still points to zsh after using bash and\n\n*What sets the $SHELL environment variable?\non Unix & Linux, which applies to macOS as well.\nYou are running the Korn shell if the Terminal preference is set to /bin/ksh. The output \n$ echo $SHELL\n/bin/bash\n\nis misleading because the SHELL variable is set by the login process to\n\nThe user's shell, as specified by the password database.\n\n(On macOS it is a user database and not the /etc/passwd file as on Linux, where that information is stored, but that does not matter.)\nYou can type\n$ echo $0\n-ksh\n\nor\n$ echo $KSH_VERSION\nVersion AJM 93u+ 2012-08-01\n\nto verify that you are running the Korn shell.\nSetting the shell via  \n$ chsh -s /bin/ksh\n\nsets the login shell in the user database, and then SHELL is set accordingly:\n$ echo $SHELL\n/bin/ksh\n\n", "Q: Numbers uninstall reinstall Lately Numbers has been quitting unexpectedly on my MacBook Air and all the pre-installed templates are gone.

Also, once a disk have been un-mounted, it will not cause a flag to be raise as if pulling out a USB flash drive while still mounted, when disconnecting the un-mounted disk.\n\nA: Yes, diskutil list is the similar command of fdisk -l on linux (mac also have fdisk command, but it is different thing), which shows all connected (or virtual) disks including not mounted.\nWhen you buy new HDD, it may not have the partitions yet, but you can check the total size of disk, identifiers, or status by using commands like diskutil list. And also you can check partition tables and how it is mounted. These commands are very useful when you manually create partitions or format drives.\n", "Q: How can I solve \"Cannot Start Family Sharing\" error, when trying to set up family sharing? On my iPhone I go to Settings -> Apple ID, and click \"Set Up Family Sharing\", and this error appears:\n\nBut... I am Jon, and I'm not familiar with any family sharing setup.\nAnd my Mac says basically the same thing, when going to System Preferences -> Family Sharing (via Catalina 10.15.1):\n\nI've called Apple Support about this but they say I need to log in with the iCloud account my primary account is associated with, but I've no idea what account that could be. As far as I'm concerned I have one and only one iCloud account, and I haven't made any account changes in years. Apple Support insists they can't look up more information.\nSo how do I use Family Sharing in this situation? Or even just debug this? Apple Support insists there's nothing they can do so I'm not sure what to do next, anyone got any ideas??\n\nA: Oh.\nOkay, I found a hint in an email from 2012 (!) when MobileMe transitioned into iCloud (remember that!?), and I guess I had another account back then which for reasons unknown I apparently family shared to my new account ‍♂️\nMy strange past behaviour aside this looks to resolve my issue (waiting for account deletion to go through before I can know for sure).\nIf anyone else comes across this: https://appleid.apple.com guided me towards my long-lost account, and https://privacy.apple.com is where I put it up for deletion.\n", "Q: Apple MacOS appears to ignore default route assigned from DHCP My team has run into the following problem. We’ve discovered an operationally acceptable workaround which I will submit as an answer to this question, but we are hoping for a better solution, or at least a better explanation of what is going on.\nWe're trying to bring some Apple products into our test lab in order to define configurations for our customer. Examples and tests were performed on a MacBook Air, but confirmed the problem exists on some older model iPhone and iPads. We've put it on one of the lab’s Wireless Ethernet networks, where it receives DHCP settings from a Cisco 5921 ESR (software router) as expected, including IP, netmask, and default route. The MacBook is in the 192.168.1.0/24 network, and in the following test cases, the remote network is 192.168.2.0/24.\nFull output of the MacBook’s ifconfig and netstat -nr are at the end of this question.\nThe problem is that while it can communicate to other devices on its local subnet, any non-local communication that should go to the gateway is failing. All types of network traffic to non-local destinations fail (ping, web, ssh). And wireshark running on the MacBook shows the expected ARP and IP traffic occurs when communicating with local nodes, even to the router itself. But absolutely no traffic is generated when trying to connect to non-local traffic, not even an ARP request. Yet the routing table seems to specify the correct interface and gateway address for the default entry. \nExecuting route get yields the following, first for local (which works) and non-local (which does not):\nMacBook-Air:~ user1$ route get 192.168.1.1\n   route to: 192.168.1.1\ndestination: 192.168.1.1\n  interface: en0\n      flags: <UP,HOST,DONE,LLINFO,WASCLONED,IFSCOPE,IFREF,ROUTER>\n recvpipe  sendpipe  ssthresh  rtt,msec    rttvar  hopcount      mtu     expire\n       0         0         0         0         0         0      1500      1175 \n\n\nMacBook-Air:~ user1$ route get 192.168.2.80\nroute: writing to routing socket: not in table\n\nAnd ping, first for local then non-local\nMacBook-Air:~ user1$ ping  192.168.1.1\nPING 192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1): 56 data bytes\n64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=255 time=2.904 ms\n64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=255 time=3.963 ms\n^C\n--- 192.168.1.1 ping statistics ---\n2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0.0% packet loss\nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 2.904/3.433/3.963/0.529 ms\n\n\nMacBook-Air:~ user1$ ping  192.168.2.80\nPING 192.168.2.80 (192.168.2.80): 56 data bytes\nping: sendto: No route to host\nping: sendto: No route to host\nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 0\nping: sendto: No route to host\nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 1\nping: sendto: No route to host\nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 2\n^C\n--- 192.168.2.80 ping statistics ---\n4 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100.0% packet loss\n\nAfter checking the basics (netmask, default routes, firewalls), we did some deeper digging that led us to this question \nIn it, the problem was that the default route is tagged with the letter I.

But in my case, the default route is set up by DHCP, so it’s not clear how or why this came to be, nor how to change it to the default scope (or, alternatively, make all applications utilize the special scope).\nAs a test, I manually added a second default route:\nsudo route -r add default 192.168.1.1\n\nThe resulting route does not get an I flag associated with it:\nRouting tables\n\nInternet:\nDestination        Gateway            Flags        Refs      Use   Netif Expire\ndefault            192.168.1.1        UGSc           4        0     en0\ndefault            192.168.1.1        UGScI           4        0     en0\n\nThis does fix the problem, now allowing all non-local network communication to work. We don’t consider this an operationally acceptable workaround, especially for iPhone and iPads, since as far as we can tell it would require adding apps to the devices in order to add manual routes.\nWe suspect that something about our network environment is causing this behavior.

If you have an Internet connection over both Ethernet and WiFi, it will use the cabled connection rather than the wireless connection.\nThe way this prioritisation is done technically is via the RTF_IFSCOPE flag, you've experienced. Essentially the system will mark the lower prioritized route with the RTF_IFSCOPE flag to ensure that it is only used if is specifically requested (i.e. for example if you have a VPN program that uses a specific connection, it will be able to do so).\nYou can observe the same thing if you connect to a WiFi without an Internet connection or a WiFi with a captive portal where you haven't signed in yet. On an iOS device for example, you'll see that the WiFi symbol at the top changes to a the waves overlaid with an exclamation mark (!). You can still use the interface and communicate with devices on that specific subnet, but it will not be used as a default gateway - unless specifically requested.\nSo in your case it seems that you have already got a default gateway on the Mac before you connect it to the WiFi. As the DHCP server on the WiFi does not give out an option 6 (i.e. list of DNS servers), the system will give this connection a lower priority.\nIt seems that you should be able to solve the problem by not having an existing default route before you connect to the WiFi.\nA more common solution would be to simply specify the priorisation you want instead of relying on automatic defaults. This is done on the Mac in System Preferences > Network. Click the Gear icon below the list on the left, and choose \"Set Service Order\". Now drag the Wi-Fi interface above the other default route interface you have (for example Ethernet). This removes the REF_IFSCOPE flag from your WiFi. You can also do this via command line, or from a central management server, ofcourse - but the GUI route is the easiest way to quickly test this.\nApart from that, I would say that your setup sounds relatively uncommon. I don't agree with your choice in specifically foregoing DNS servers simply to avoid reconfiguring web servers from doing reverse lookups on IP addresses. The reverse lookups will still be done, but they'll just be handled locally instead.\nIt seems it would be a better choice to have DNS servers and configure web servers reasonably instead. You can configure a DNS server to statically reply to all reverse lookups instead of looking anything up on the Internet or otherwise spending time providing names.\n\nA: We discovered this reference when searching for more information on what causes the Apple products to behave this way. \nFor reasons that are not clear to me, when an Apple device using Wireless Ethernet does not receive a DNS server setting via DHCP, it places the routing information it receives into a network scope that is different from the default scope, thus preventing any non-local communication. When the DHCP offer contains a DNS Server option, this problem does not occur, and when the network is wired Ethernet, the problem does not occur regardless of whether there is a DNS Server setting in the DHCP offer.\nOur network environment is standalone, and DNS name resolution is not used. So our DHCP servers do not provide DHCP option 6, aka “dns-server”. We were able to solve our problem by providing a bogus DNS server IP address via DHCP, and all the effected Apple devices are now communicating with non-local addresses as expected, and the “I” flag is now absent from the default route entry.\n(We chose not to have DNS in this environment because its not required for our application (all configurations are autogenerated from a common planning tool, so there’s no inherent benefit to using Hostnames), and we have had experience with some software such as web servers that, in the course of logging client requests, would try to reverse-resolve IPs back to hostnames. They would become bogged down due to high rates of DNS queries to non-existant DNS servers, each of which would take a second or two to time out. Since there was no negative response, the log records would cause at least one query that would have to time out. We think it’s safer to remove DNS settings than to identify every possible piece of software that might act this way.)\nSo right now we have reconfigured the DHCP pool are to provide as the DNS Server the IP address for a system that is on the network but not running a DNS service. It is providing ICMP port unreachable messages, which so far seems to be avoiding lag due to time out, but we remain concerned that our testing doesn’t uncover every possible error case that this configuration change may cause. So if we do not find a better solution to this Apple problem, we may have to actually run a DNS service that contains no data, just to give negative responses and avoid the possibility of DNS timeouts.\nWe may also attempt to segregate the Apple products so they receive DHCP settings from a different pool, so only they receive DNS server options. I'm believe there's a way to identify Apple products based on OUI, although I've never tried that before.\nI’m hoping someone has a better solution that doesn’t require any kind of change to the network infrastructure.\n", "Q: MySQL service doesn't start in Catalina OSX Installed MySQL 8.0.18 from a dmg file downloaded from the official site.

After plugging charger in and out for a couple of minutes it would finally start to work and when screen comes up it says it is fully charged.  The chargers are same as we are using to charge our iPhones so the chargers are still working fine. When the iPad 2 mini booted it is fully charged and would work fine off charger for hours.  Now we can't get it to boot at all and just get the screen that says the battery is dead.  It also says its charging when not plugged it but not when it is plugged in.  Very confused and need some ideas how to fix this thing.\n\nA: The battery is failing/dead, the circuitry inside may be damaged, or both. You need to have this iPad serviced and needs to be opened and checked out by an Apple Tech. If it is out of warranty, any reputable 3rd party Apple Tech fixit shop should be able to help.\nThere's nothing anybody can do remotely - the device has obvious hardware issues. I've handled enough iPad minis in similar shape to be certain of it.\nYour best bet is to get a new (or newer) iPad.

When running /usr/libexec/oah/translate, either as when installed by the Snow Leopard Rosetta installer, and installed by Pacifist, I get Killed: 9. But, when running ~/Downloads/Rosetta/usr/libexec/oah/, which was extracted by Pacifist, I get the following:\n$ ~/Downloads/Rosetta/usr/libexec/oah/translate\nobjc[21035]: Objective-C garbage collection is no longer supported.\nAbort trap: 6\n\nAfter looking more into Rosetta.pkg (which isn't actually located in Optional Installs.mpkg somehow), I noticed that aside from postinstall and preinstall scripts, there was a folder named postinstall_actions which contained a script named registerRosetta. Here are the contents of that script:\n#!/bin/sh\nif [ \"$3\" == \"/\" ]; then\n    logger -p install.info Registering Rosetta\n    /usr/sbin/sysctl -w kern.exec.archhandler.powerpc=/usr/libexec/oah/translate\nfi\n\nSo, I decided to backup /usr/sbin/sysctl and then try running part of the script.

I'm going to look into modifying macOS more, to make this work. I have no idea how much is going to need to be done, but I can hopefully get an idea by continuing where the discussion on InsanelyMac forums left off.\n\nA: You can try installing Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6.8) in VirtualBox.

Alternately, use Recovery Partition Creator (MacWorld has instructions).\n2.3. Lifewire has another method. I've discovered that you can run Disk Utility 13 (that has the option of the Debug menu mentioned in the Lifewire article) in El Capitan if you hack it first.\n\n*If one of these options results in a working recovery partition, great! Boot into it and use that (in my experience option 2.1 will boot, but will not allow you to restore from Time Machine—at least in El Capitan). If not, continue to the next step.\n\n*Open the recovery partition. You can use the Debug menu in Disk Utility 13 or earlier (instructions in the Lifewire article above) to select and then mount it, or mount a disk image of the partition.\n\n*Use Tinkertool or some other method to show hidden files in the Finder.\n\n*On the Recovery HD (that you should have mounted on your desktop in Step 4) there is a folder called \"com.apple.recovery.boot.\" In it is a hidden disk image named \"BaseSystem.dmg.\" Mount that (I had to hit Command-O for some reason; double-clicking did not do the job). \n\n*A disk image called \"OS X Base System\" will appear on your desktop.\n\n*Launch Terminal. \n\n*Paste the following command, hit Return, then input your password when prompted: sudo -b /Volumes/OS\\ X\\ Base\\ System/System/Installation/CDIS/Time\\ Machine\\ System\\ Restore.app/Contents/MacOS/Time\\ Machine\\ System\\ Restore (The reason for this is that Time Machine System Restore must be launched as root in order for it to properly restore your permissions.)\n\n*Follow the instructions to restore your system from your Time Machine backup!\n\n\nA: Unless I'm missing something, I would just install El Capitan (if that's what you're trying to do) and then use the Migration Assistant app within El Capitan to restore from your Time Machine backup.\nFor more information on this, refer to How to move your content to a new Mac on Apple's website.\nIn summary though, you can use Migration Assistant to transfer data, user accounts, settings and apps from your backup drive, and you can do this manually after installing El Capitan. \nMigration Assistant can also be used multiple times so you can choose a combination of what you need to transfer across (e.g. applications, user account(s), settings). \nNote that while it can transfer applications and utilities, those bundled by Apple with Mac OS X/macOS (e.g. Safari, Mail, etc) are not migrated across (although some user data such as your Safari bookmarks will transfer across).\nAdditional info\nYou can run Migration Assistant from whatever version of macOS you have installed. By doing this you can restore your entire system from your Time Machine backup (well, as much as is possible from a Time Machine backup). Doing this is effectively the same as using the Restore From Time Machine Backup option available in the macOS Utilities window you refer to in your question.\nIf you want to install El Capitan first, then download it here. You can refer to How to upgrade to OS X El Capitan on Apple's website for more info. \n", "Q: MacOS Catalina how to change windows size without buttons?

But when I do, and I cmd+tab from the editor to the terminal, the focus is suddenly on the terminal on screen one (and thereby accidentally typing all kind of stuff in the server output)\nSo, is there a way to make a window of an app the 'main' window? (the terminal on screen two in this case) So that when you cmd+tab to the application the focus will be on this 'main' window?\nIn System Preferences > Displays > Arrangement, I already moved the white taskbar to screen two. This does not solve the problem\nI cant recall I had this problem before.

I am running Catalina on a macbook pro 2018. For the past few days I have experienced connection issues: \n\n\n*\n\n*The first problem was when I returned to work after vacation and could not connect to any of our internal services.\n\n*A quick check showed that I was getting an external IP from Denmark. Alright that is unexpected. Then I used some ip checker tools to get some more informations, and I saw that the IP was one of NordVPNs servers.\n\n*Alright - so I don't seem to have a malware proxy (what I first thought) but rather a misconfigured VPN connection. The VPN client app was not active at this point and every manual vpn connection in the network app was inactive or disabled.\n\n*So now I knew the problem seems to be NordVPN, so I deleted the app, deleted every network adapter vpn setting, deleted all places where I could find nordvpn files\n\n\nPlaces where I deleted nordVPN related stuff:\n- ~/Library/Application\\ Support/  \n- ~/Library/Caches\n- ~/Library/Logs\n- ~/Library/Preferences\n- ~/Library/Containers\n\nI also tried restarting the mDNSResponder several times with sudo killall mDNSresponder and I tried deleting the network configs in ~/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration:\ncom.apple.airport.preferences.plist\ncom.apple.network.identification.plist\nNetworkInterfaces.plist\npreferences.plist\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Afterwards I restarted the machine and it seemed to work, but only for some time (minutes to hours) before my IP changes again and a VPN connection is active.\n\n*So it seems like somewhere in the system there are still credentials/certificates stored. So I opened the mac keychain and deleted every nordVPN credential and root certificates. Another restart later the problem has changed a little bit:\nNow I could not get ANY connection (I could use ping and would get the expected output but could not use curl or any browser). So somehow the approach with deleting all credentials seemed to have some effect.\n\n\n*\n\n*For the next step I wanted to find out which process was starting up the VPN connection. So I consulted the system.log and the macOS console. I've seen many many entries from the IKEv2Provider service (the mac vpn service process) with a status like \"Tunnel:NordVPN:\"some hex code here\" with the Description: \"Received a start command from \"programXY[pid]\"\" Unfortunately I don't have the exact wording as I restored the complete machine in the meantime to factory settings and did not save the logs. There was another logfile where it also mentioned the IKEv2Provider process quite often with something like: process remained dirty for too long. Killing which showed up many times too. \n\n\nSo the problem seems to be this process, but it seems to get the start command from random apps, I was seeing processes like calendar.agent, spotify, firefox etc. starting it up.\n\n\n*\n\n*So that was the last step before I said screw it and restored the machine to factory settings. Another problem is that the issue persists when I restore from my timemachine backup, either I need to find an older backup which is not compromised or I need to restore only files and apps but not system settings? I will try that out later today.  \n\n\nI've already somehow settled with a factory reset and a partial-recovery of my important things like dotfiles, IDE settings and stuff, but my system settings will be lost, so some kind of solution would be preferred. \nI can always go back to the \"corrupted\" backup, so if anyone here has a idea what else to do or has every heard of something similar I would love to hear your tips, and if it's promising I can restore the machine to the faulty state and try out some more things. \nAdditional Info:\n\n\n*\n\n*At some point deleting and re-adding all wifi connections seemed to work, but only for some time until the VPN kicked in again.\n\n*I have contacted NordVPNs support, but so far I only received the usual tips, maybe they will escalate the ticket to a dev.\n\n*When I had the NordVPN client still installed and clicked on Quick Connect it connected to the server I was already on! So my IP did not change at all but the Client reported that it is connected. Connecting to different countries still worked, I would get a UK-IP when I connected to the UK, but when I disconnected I still was on the NordVPN IP from Denmark. What I would expect from Quick Connect (And experienced in the past) is that it connects to a German or Switzerland server (I am located in southern Germany) but never to a server in Denmark.\n\n*All of this stuff happened after I was vacationing in the Netherlands. I heavily used my VPN there (Lots of open wifis) and it feels like that is part of the reason it won't disappear afterwards. (When located in the Netherlands getting a quick-connect server in Denmark would make a little bit more sense)\n\n*What bugs me out the most is that the logs showed Tunnel:NordVPN AFTER I deleted every file/keychain entry/certificate mentioning NordVPN, so there has to be some kind of hidden entry somewhere which I can't find. \n\n\nI am sorry for the long text, but I tried collecting all the steps I already tried out, I think it is not an common problem but I hope that we somehow find a solution, I would love to avoid restoring only part of my files, and use my complete backup.\n\nA: I found the problem myself:\nThe culprit was /Library/Preferences/com.apple.networkextension.plist - there were entries for the IP I was always conecting too, my vpn login email and strings like \"nordvpn.osx\". (Not to be confused with the path ~/Library/Preferences!) I deleted everything related to vpn and after a restart it worked again. I needed to download XCode to edit the .plist, and you have to copy it to a directory with r+w permission, and copy it back to the protected Preferences directory after editing. \n", "Q: How can I check the build number of the current available macOS / OS X installers? I operate a small-medium fleet of macOS and OS X computers. For various legacy software and licensing reasons, the fleet operates on each release from 10.9 (Mavericks) to 10.15 (Catalina, current). All of these releases are free to download via the App Store and from Apple directly via their website.\nI am not a member of any Apple program that provides access to early and/or special macOS / OS X builds. I am reliant on common sense and trial-and-error to maintain a set of OS installers from official sources. Sometimes the App Store installers are silently updated, especially when minor updates are applied outside of a combo updates release.\nRight now, I check every couple of weeks and spend time downloading ~5-8GB, check the build number and invariably see it hasn't changed, then ditch the download. This seems wasteful.\nI would like to be able to check a location online that can tell me the current build number of the active release, for example the one that's downloadable from the App Store.\nIs there a location I can check that will tell me the build number of the freely-available macOS & OS X releases?\nThank you.\nEdit #1: addressing @Jay-Way's post below with a screenshot. It looks like Mactracker doesn't have 10.15 (Catalina) details at all, so I'm guessing it's a manually-maintained list by the author or a third party.\n\n\nA: There is an app for that :) https://apps.apple.com/app/mactracker/id430255202?mt=12\nIt seems like there is no web service or similar providing this info, but I just took a quick look at the app and it seems to provide infos on every mac- and iOS, with build informations for every version.\nScreenshot:\n\n", "Q: How to add space between cells' borders in Mac Pages (without removing the borders)?

I have an Apple Music subscription.\nIf it is relevant: I am in Switzerland.\n\nA: My guess is that it has something to do with your location. I'm in the USA and when I searched for \"hr3\" in the Music app it immediately showed that station you are looking for as a result. Maybe TuneIn only works with the Apple Music app in some countries?\n\nA: I don't know if it's still possible, but at the time, I was retrieving the streaming URL, I going to  iTunes > file menu and opening a link (or something of that style). Once the link played on iTunes, I had a playlist named radio, I added it to the playlist and synchronized the playlist with the iPhone. If iTunes could read the streaming format the iPhone too. I don't remember the formats he didn't support, but there are very few for me. To be sure that your url contains only the streaming URL you test it on a browser, because I already had url that looked like the stream, but it was not the case. If you just have a player it's good, it's the stream URL. If you have a web page, you must continue your research.  I would get the url in the source code of the pages ...\n\nA: Tell Siri to play it.

To do so I need to sync it to my laptop to transfer over the music I need for the event. But it's only the music that I want to sync; I don't want to interfere with any other content on the iPhone 5 — photos, apps (and their data), etc etc I want to leave untouched. Is this possible? \nOh, and of course she's a teenager so this phone has almost certainly never been synced to a computer (or if it has then not for two years or more) so the idea of 'simply resync it from your daughter's computer afterward to put everything back as it was' is unlikely to be a workable option. And it's not her current phone anyway.\n\nA: You can't just sync an iPhone to any random computer - even if you are \"dad\".\nApple's security will just not let you do that.\nYou would need to release the phone from Find My iPhone, re-set it as your phone, set up as a new device, then you could sync your own iTunes to it.\nThis would, of course, delete any existing data on it & reassign it as your own device.\nYou would have to revert that afterwards, using a previously saved backup of your daughter's phone as it was before you 'borrowed it'.\nSimpler might be to set up her iTunes on her computer to hold your playlist.\nThat at least wouldn't require the double transfer of ownership.\n", "Q: Create firmware partition for macOS to be installed Here is what I did.

While doing so, I got the error below:\nYou may not install to this partition because the computer is missing a firmware partition.\nHow can I fix this issue so I can use my external SSD?\n\nA: possible that I'm wrong, but even if it works, Apple does not provide this mode of operation and when it makes a major update.

My situation may be an edge case but I think its worth noting this situation for others.\nShort Answers:\n\n*\n\n*Use USB-C to DVI adapters to connect external monitors if you have older monitors and can live with 1920x1080 resolution (1080p)\n\n*Purchase newer monitors that were released around the time of your Mac that have either HDMI 1.2, 1.4 or 2.0 [not 1.3] ports or DP 1.2+ ports.\n\nLong Answer:\nI have 2 external ViewSonic 2770 monitors (that support HDMI 1.3) connected via passive Anker USB-C to HDMI adapters. I get the kernel panic/gpu restart almost daily on my iMac Pro. These same monitors connected via the same Anker adapters to my 2018 MacBook Pro cause no kernel panics nor GPU restarts. Both machines are running Big Sur 11.6.1.\nI've tried all the usual stuff: disconnect other USB devices, changed cabling, checked on kernel extensions, safe mode and I have 3 of these monitors in total that I swapped out and each one causes a crash when connected.\nObviously the GPUs are different in these machines but according to the Thunderbolt wiki I think the 2017 iMac Pro is using the Alpine Ridge thunderbolt 3 controller which supports DP 1.2 whereas the 2018 MacBook Pro is using Titan Ridge which supports DP 1.4 (the MacBookPro tech specs just says \"Native DisplayPort output over USB‑C\" which I think implies the latest DP 1.4).\nThe iMac Pro tech specs says it sends DP 1.2 over the thunderbolt 3/USB C ports but according to this HDMI wiki, DP 1.2 seems to only support HDMI 1.2 OR 1.4 although my monitors are HDMI 1.3:\n\nDisplayPort 1.2 supports multiple audio/video streams, variable\nrefresh rate (FreeSync), Display Stream Compression (DSC), and\nDual-mode LVDS/TMDS transmitters compatible with HDMI 1.2 or 1.4.\n\nI would think a monitor with HDMI 1.3 is backwards compatible with HDMI 1.2 which would make it work with DP 1.2 and everything would play nice but that does not seem to be the case.\nUltimately I ended up using USB-C to DVI adapters for the 2 monitors and I no longer get the kernel panics/gpu restarts.\n", "Q: How to screen record using AppleScript on Catalina? So I've been using a script before I updated to Catalina that worked fine for screen recording. It's based on another user's SE question, but ever since the update, it looks like there is a new step. \nBasically, you tell \"QuickTime Player\" to start (new screen recording). \nBut instead of a screen recording starting, it just opens a new menu which lets you select some settings, or click the screen to record using the last used settings. \nI've tried using System Events to click to screen, even after a 1s delay, but it's not working. \nAnyone know how to either: \n1) Bypass the new menu and just start recording right away\n2) Start recording once the menu has popped up (System Events doesn't detect window 1, so I'm not even sure how to navigate the UI)\n3) Click the screen/UI using System Events\n* Update to question *\nI've edited my AppleScript code since user3439894 wrote a response. It seems to work for what I've asked. The only problem now is that I'm not sure how to save to file to a specific path. Below, I've added some code snippets of what I currently have since making edits (it just saves the screen recording to the Desktop based on the date for the time. Below that, I have my original code which saves it on the Desktop as test.mov.\nMy code now, after edits\n1) Starting recording\ntell application \"QuickTime Player\" to activate\ntell application \"QuickTime Player\" to start (new screen recording)\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Screen Shot\"\n  repeat until exists its front window\n    delay 0.1\n  end repeat\n  if not (exists button \"Record\" of its front window) then\n    click checkbox \"Record Entire Screen\" of its front window\n  end if\n  click button \"Record\" of its front window\nend tell\n\n2) end recording\ntell application \"System Events\" to click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1 of application process \"screencaptureui\"\n\nMy Code Before Edits\n3) Old way I used to start my recording before Catalina for screen recording (still works for webcam (aka Movie) recording)\ntell application \"QuickTime Player\" to activate\ntell application \"QuickTime Player\" to start (new screen recording)\n\n4) Old way I used to stop and save my screen recording that doesn't work in Catalina\nset filePath to \"Users:mini:Desktop:test.mov\"\nset f to a reference to file filePath\ntell application \"QuickTime Player\"\n  pause document \"screen recording\"\n  save document \"screen recording\" in f using settings preset \"1080p\"\n  stop document \"screen recording\"\n  close document \"screen recording\"\nend tell\n\n\nA: Without seeing your AppleScript code, all I can say is that for me, as an example, on macOS High Sierra doing a screen recording requires different coding then on macOS Catalina, as the latter no longer actually uses QuickTime Player to do the actual screen recording.\nThis may also hold true for macOS Mojave, however, the following example AppleScript code was only tested under macOS Catalina:\n--  # Setup to do a screen recording.\n\ntell application \"QuickTime Player\" to new screen recording\n\n--  # Start the screen recording.\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Screen Shot\"\n    repeat until exists button \"Record\" of its front window\n        delay 0.1\n    end repeat\n    click button \"Record\" of its front window\nend tell\n\n--  # Set the time in seconds you want the recording to be.\n\ndelay 2\n\n--  # Stop the recording.\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n    click menu bar item 1 ¬\n        of menu bar 1 ¬\n        of application process \"screencaptureui\"\n\nAt this point, by default, when the screen recording is stopped, it is saved to the Desktop as e.g. Screen Recording 2019-11-01 at 3.38.00 PM.mov on my system and opened in QuickTime Player.\nAdditional coding can be included to do whatever else one would like to do with the screen recording (within the limits of the target app and AppleScript).\nThat all said, since macOS Catalina is actually using a different application to do the actual screen recording and not QuickTime Player, one could skip the use of QuickTime Player and create the screen recording using the following example AppleScript code, which uses the system default keyboard shortcut ⇧⌘5:\n--  # Setup to do a screen recording.\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"%\" using {shift down, command down}\n\n--  # Start the screen recording.\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Screen Shot\"\n    repeat until exists its front window\n        delay 0.1\n    end repeat\n    if not (exists button \"Record\" of its front window) then\n        click checkbox \"Record Entire Screen\" of its front window\n    end if\n    click button \"Record\" of its front window\nend tell\n\n--  # Set the time in seconds you want the recording to be.\n\ndelay 2\n\n--  # Stop the recording.\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n    click menu bar item 1 ¬\n        of menu bar 1 ¬\n        of application process \"screencaptureui\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note the use of % instead of 5 in keystroke \"%\" as the shift key is pressed and I'm on a US English keyboard.\n\n*The usual caveats, regarding System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy, apply.\n\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any additionally error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors.\n", "Q: What kind of NFC-Tag is only readable in Shortcuts App? I just got my iPhone 11 pro max and wanted to see, if it can read the nfc enabled wrist band of my local gym. There are several nfc-apps[1] on the app store and additionally the shortcuts app is capable of reading nfc-tags.\nWhen scanning the wrist band with the shortcuts app, it is recognized. But every other app does not recognize it.\nAre there different flavors of nfc? Is this just a iOS quirk? Is there a reason why only the shortcuts app can see this tag?\nBackground:\nThe local gym has some kind of nfc-based member-card. In fact its not a card, but a wrist-band with a tiny nfc-chip in it as it seems. The wrist band reader on the door is made by a company named \"Gantner\".\nIn the long run I want to get rid of this silly red wrist band and just use my apple watch. But I think this is not (yet) possible. Nevertheless I am curious to understand what is stored in this band and how nfc works in this case.\n\nUpdate: Added Apps\n[1] NFC for iPhone, NFC-Tools, NFC21 Reader, Simply NFC, NFC TagInfo and a few others.\n\nA: NFC is a standardized set of protocols - so in that sense \"NFC is NFC\". However the standard allows for multiple types of tags (i.e. your wrist band has an NFC tag embedded in it).\nCurrently the standard allows for 5 different types of tags, which vary in speed, capacity, mode settings, etc. For example you can set tags to be read-only or rewritable, and some types allows you to change from read-only to rewritable and vice versa, and others do not.\nOn top of that, NFC tags are produced by many different companies, allowing you to pick from a huge variety of form factors (dimensions, weights, etc) in various materials.\nHowever the reason your tag is not readable by other apps is not because of these differences, nor that iOS has quirks.\nIt is simply so that apps tend to limit the tags that they scan to the ones associated with that app. I.e. no need to scan any random tags, if you're only interested in very specific ones. The phone actually scans every tag, but the app filters those out it is not interested in.\nThe Shortcuts app allows you to use more or less any tag - so it will do just that.\nUpdate: You have updated your question indicating the specific apps you have used. You have tried to use generic apps that should read \"any\" tags - and thus app specific filtering is not your problem.\nHowever your problem is instead that on iOS 12 and prior, the system allowed apps to read only tags encoded in the NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF). Your tag must likely is not encoded in NDEF, and thus cannot be read by those apps.\nOn iOS 13 that limitation has been lifted. However, app developer must change their apps to expand the types of data encodings they can read. Those app you have tried aren't updated to read the specific type of tag you have.\n", "Q: Undo refusal of app’s access to mic I am using Scratch which is based on Adobe Air, I believe.\nAt some point I mistakenly denied access to my microphone on that program (it asked me \"May Scratch access your microphone\" or something along the lines through the OS, and I said \"no\" by mistake).\nNow I can't seem to find a place where I can recover the access and allow Scratch to access my microphone.\nAny ideas where that toggle would be?\n\nA: Security & Privacy\nYou can control which applications have access to the computer's microphone using the Security & Privacy panel:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences.app > Security & Privacy > Privacy (tab)\n\n\nTo modify the list, select Click the lock to make changes.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to choose which macOS version to use when reinstalling? I have Mountain Lion on my Mac, but I would like to erase all the data and reinstall OS from Mac Utility (Command + R when restart), but as far as I know there is no option to chose which macOS you would like to get...\nIt is kind of random choice of Mac Utility system...\nSo, question is there any way to choose OS (for example Catalina)?\n\nA: When you boot to the Recovery mode option using Command-R, the Mac will restore the version of macOS which is currently installed on the Mac. Mountain Lion will be reinstalled if you use this key combination.\nIf you use Option-Command-R it will install the version of macOS that was originally installed on your Mac, or the closest version still available.

I've trying zapping the PRAM and SMC, many many reboots and of course installed 10.15.1 as soon as it was released.\nThe only thing I really see in the logs is:\nNov  1 13:08:14 MBP xpcproxy[39290]: libcoreservices: _dirhelper_userdir: 557: bootstrap_look_up returned (ipc/send) invalid destination port\n\nThis is repeated over and over during sleep.\nWeird af.\nI have dug a fair bit on this, and I'm a developer, I can't figure it out.\nThis is what I see when I close the lid...\ndefault    13:53:02.324671+0000    kernel    PMRD: clamshell closed 1, disabled 0, desktopMode 0, ac 0 sleepDisabled 0\ndefault    13:53:02.324675+0000    kernel    PMRD: clamshell closed 1, disabled 0, desktopMode 0, ac 0 sleepDisabled 0\ndefault    13:53:02.325038+0000    kernel    PMRD: clamshell closed 1, disabled 0, desktopMode 0, ac 0 sleepDisabled 0\ndefault    13:53:02.325215+0000    kernel    PMRD: user inactive 0 min, time to idle sleep 30 min\ndefault    13:53:02.326066+0000    kernel    PMRD: SleepWake UUID cleared\ndefault    13:53:02.326221+0000    kernel    PMRD: sleep reason Clamshell Sleep\ndefault    13:53:02.326755+0000    kernel    PMRD: prevent idle sleep list: IODisplayWrangler- (0)\ndefault    13:53:02.325859+0000    sharingd    Clamshell change detected (clamshell closed: YES, clamshell sleep on close: YES)\ndefault    13:53:02.325103+0000    loginwindow    clamshellStateChanged | Clamshell state changed: closed=1, shouldSleepWhenClosed=2\ndefault    13:53:02.325808+0000    powerd    vm.darkwake_mode: 0 -> 0\ndefault    13:53:02.325563+0000    loginwindow    RegisterSleepWakeCallback_block_invoke | IOPMScheduleUserActiveChangedNotification received:0\ndefault    13:53:02.340475+0000    kernel    PMRD: SleepWake UUID queued: FE56E0B3-79A0-4149-B16C-2757978A6E68\ndefault    13:53:02.340594+0000    kernel    PMRD: SleepWake UUID queued: 0E8E3E06-B13D-4B6D-83AF-E2B5980995FF\ndefault    13:53:02.340878+0000    hidd    system will go to sleep\ndefault    13:53:02.340678+0000    kernel    PMRD: tellChangeDown::userActivityAtSleep 2\ndefault    13:53:02.341804+0000    hidd    system sleep - device turned off\ndefault    13:53:02.340975+0000    nfcd    00007f9a 9ef025e0 -[_NFHardwareManager powerObserverSystemWillSleep:]:4721\ndefault    13:53:02.341661+0000    coreaudiod    <private> received power notification kIOMessageSystemWillSleep\ndefault    13:53:02.340871+0000    securityd    system will sleep\ndefault    13:53:02.342602+0000    CommCenter    [power]: system will sleep\ndefault    13:53:02.342106+0000    hidd    system will go to sleep\ndefault    13:53:02.341183+0000    securityd    0x7ffee19d59d0 will sleep\ndefault    13:53:02.344408+0000    rapportd    CLink: State changed: FullWake -> DarkWake, 0x1 < DarkWake >\ndefault    13:53:02.346837+0000    CalNCService    System will sleep: kIOMessageSystemWillSleep\ndefault    13:53:02.342482+0000    powerd    Process (null).0 Released Idle Sleep Preventer \"IODisplayWrangler\" age: id:0 [System: DeclUser kDisp]\ndefault    13:53:02.346960+0000    CalNCService    Suspended timer for imminent system sleep\ndefault    13:53:02.342663+0000    powerd    Received kIOMessageSystemWillSleep.

I now have 3 user accounts, 2 with different variations on my name! None of them access the same applications and information. I have no idea how I accomplished this: computers are not my strong suit. How do I blend them all together? Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: Each time do you a migration, it will make a new account on the new machine.\nI can only assume to get 3 separate accounts you started with a brand new user on the new Mac, then did two separate, possibly partial, migrations.\nIt is possible to manually merge them, [I also learned the hard way how to do this] but in all honesty, & especially as you claim to not be a power-user, it will be simpler to wipe the Mac & start over. It may not actually take any longer than trying to merge what you have currently & is likely to be less 'hazardous'.\nDo a full single migration as part of the initial setup. When the machine first asks you who you are, there is a point at which you migrate instead of making a new user. \nApple have a step by step procedure to \"sell\" your Mac & set up fresh for the \"new owner\". I would follow that. What to do before you sell, give away, or trade in your Mac As it reboots once more as a \"new Mac\" then follow the Migration guide - How to move your content to a new Mac which should then Migrate to one single new account, matching the one you had on your previous machine.\n", "Q: Where does Safari store the open tabs? I'd like to know where does Safari store all the open tabs.

I then suppose they are stored in a file somewhere on the HD. As I do have TimeMachine active, I hope that by restoring an older version of this file, I would be able to retrieve my open tabs. The problem being of course that I don't know where it stores them...\nI'm on Safari 13.0.2 on macOS 10.13.6 (High Sierra - can't upgrade my early 2011 MBP, but I don't think it would have changed something)\n\nA: LastSession.plist is no longer used since Safari v15 for the purpose of storing the tabs.\nTo get back your tabs:\n\n*\n\n*Close Safari and make sure it's not running anymore\n\n*In Finder Go to Folder... (from the Go menu)\nPaste in ~/Library/Containers/Safari/Data/Library/Safari\n\n*Attach your TimeMachine disk\n\n*Enter Time Machine from TimeMachine menu. It shows that Safari folder.\n\n*Go back in history to the time from which you'd like to restore the tabs. Ue the TimeMachine's arrow keys to navigate in history.\n\n*Select the following files holding CMD:\n\n\n*\n\n*SafariTabs.db\n\n*SafariTabs.db-shm\n\n*SafariTabs.db-wal\n\n\n\n*Click Restore below the window and confirm to replace for each file\n\nDone: Start Safari and enjoy using your old tabs.\nIf the Safari window does not show your tabs, check the Window menu. Sometimes it re-opens in another window. You may switch back to the redundant window and close it before closing Safari, so you should be fine next time.\nOne more hint: In Finder's Go to Folder... enter the path containing ...Containers/Safari... rather than containing ...Containers/com.apple.Safari.... The latter is wrongly recalled as ...Containers/Safari.Safari... and will bring you to the wrong path when choose it from the history next time.\nSee https://www.reddit.com/r/Safari/comments/pvcz1v/comment/heb0yre/\n\nA: OK, just found it!\nI closed Safari, restored the file ~/Library/Safari/LastSession.plist from my TimeMachine backup. I then restarted Safari and hit the \"Restore from Last Session\"\nWhat a bliss to see my 71 tabs back to life!\n", "Q: Mojave: Unable to resize APFS container On my macbook I had wanted to install Ubuntu so a while ago I had created a partition and installed it to half of my drive. I ended up not using the distro and wanted to reclaim the space. I tried following a few guides that suggested I run diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 0 after deleting the other partition. But upon running the command i get this error.\nError: -69519: The target disk is too small for this operation, or a gap is required in your partition map which is missing or too small, which is often caused by an attempt to grow a partition beyond the beginning of another partition or beyond the end of partition map usable space\nHow would I get arround this error to resize my container. \n \n\nA: Disk Utility and diskutil (which Disk Utility uses behind the scenes) are refusing to increase the size of your APFS container because your recovery partition, \"Recovery HD\", appears to be in the way (though, for whatever reason, Disk Utility is not making this apparent in its diagrams). This probably became the case due to a direct upgrade from a pre-APFS version of macOS (i.e. Sierra or earlier) to Mojave; if you do a fresh install of Mojave, an APFS volume called \"Recovery\" is created inside the same APFS container used for your macOS installation, rather than a distinct HFS partition called \"Recovery HD\".\nFrom the info you've provided, your 250 GB disk appears to be partitioned as follows:\n+------------+---------------------------+-------------+-------------------------+\n| EFI System | APFS container            | Recovery HD | Free Space              |\n| Partition  |                           |             |                         |\n| (210 MB)   | (125 GB)                  | (650 MB)    | (125 GB)                |\n+------------+---------------------------+-------------+-------------------------+\n\nBut let's confirm this is the case: please share the output of sudo gpt -r show disk0 to see the GUID partition table proper.\nIf this is the case, you'll need to move the \"Recovery HD\" partition to the end of the disk, and then you should be able to increase the size of the APFS container which contains the \"mint\" APFS volume where macOS is installed. I am unsure if this could render your recovery partition unbootable, but it seems highly unlikely.\n", "Q: How do I install Minecraft mods on macOS There are so many mods for Minecraft and reading online everybody talks about a mods folder that I can't find. What's wrong with macOS and how do I get it working? \nI found the answer to this question and I'm posting these info as Q/A on this website in the hope that it can help someone. \n\nA: After searching on Internet I discovered that MODS are not supported by the Minecraft authors, so you have to download external libraries and HACK your Minecraft installation.\nYou must download the Java edition, mods are available for this version, so the lack of macOS port is not a problem. You can download it from the Minecraft website\nOnce you downloaded it, click on the icon, this will open the Minecraft launcher, which is a frontend program to your game.\n\nAfter the launcher ends loading, you will see a select button that allows you to choose the version you want to play.\n\nWell, we need to create a patched version of Minecraft and after this, we can choose which one like to start using this selector. So now the question is: how do we create a patched version of Minecraft? We need to install the Minecraft forge that is an API that allows MODS to work with few or no issues. \nCLOSE YOUR MINECRAFT.\nYou can download it from: Minecraft forge\nWhich version to download depends on your Minecraft version! You can see that my Minecraft version is 1.14.4, so I need to download this version. The file you have to download is the INSTALLER:\n\nAfter the installer download completes, start it and wait it ends its work. Now you can start again the Minecraft launcher and you notice that there is something new: the patched version is ready!!\n\nStart again Minecraft, it will take longer to get ready and will download any missing library. Once it starts there is another important surprise for you: you got the mods folder!\nWhere is it?! Open a terminal and copy and paste this: \nopen ~/Library/Application\\ Support/minecraft  \n\na new finder window opens and there you can see the mods folder\n\nThere you have to insert all the mods you want. Remember: with Minecraft version x.x.x works only the mod build for this version! When you search for mods, be sure to download the correct ones.\nHave fun!\n", "Q: Keyboard backlight is not working in Macbook Pro MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018) with MAC OS Catalina 10.15.

I’m using iOS 13.2 on an iPhone X, and would like to drastically reduce the amount of cellular data my phone is using. In less than a month, my phone has used 10.7 GB of cellular data. 8.5 GB of that is from “System Services,” with 7.9 GB coming from “Documents & Sync.”\nIs there any way to see what is using all of that data, or to control what happens over cellular vs waiting for Wi-Fi? My battery also dies quickly, and assume that is related to how much cellular data is being used in background. \nWhat I tried: \n\n\n*\n\n*I turned off iCloud Drive syncing over cellular network yesterday morning and then reset cellular data usage statistics. Since then, Documents & Sync has used used 1.0 GB of cellular data .\n\n*I’ve had “Low Data Mode” turned on under Cellular Data Options for the entire month, which doesn’t seem to be helping at all.\n\n*I tried erasing all content and settings and restoring from backup. This may have helped slightly, but it still seems to be using large amounts of cellular data\n\nA: Take a look at \"Wi-Fi Assist\", which is found at Settings --> Cellular --> right near the bottom of the list.  This setting uses your cellular data when Wi-Fi connectivity is poor.  \nThis may account for cell usage even when you have iCloud Drive turned off.\n\nA: Running into this exact same problem, disabled every single option vaguely related to \"data\" and \"iCloud\" in the settings, and in my specific case tracked it down to WhatsApp leaching huge amounts of mobile-data (each time 1-2 megabytes within 1-2 minutes - and increasing - after disabling WiFi and enabling 4G).\nIf you run into this problem and have WhatsApp installed, try the following:\nOpen the settings, click on your name/cloud-account at the top, select iCloud and in the list with apps disable WhatsApp (at the very bottom).\nNote: There might of course be more reasons or other apps causing \"documents & sync\" leeching data. Interesting is that even if an App is disallowed access to mobile data, via writing to iCloud it can apparently indirectly cause usage of mobile data. \n\nA: I have the exact same issue. It started on Nov 9th and has continued since then pretty consistently. I had cellular data turned off for iCloud Drive, and I have background app refresh set to WiFi only. Also no iCloud photos turned on. I use Photo stream but have also set it to wifi only. I thought I'd started to troubleshoot the issue yesterday. I turned off my MacBook Pro (using the same iCloud account) before I left for work in the morning, and the documents and sync number didn't go up much all day. But today, I turned off its wifi before I left for work and it went up by about 400mb.\nThis is very frustrating not to be able to see what 'document is syncing' just a black box that's using insane amounts of data and forcing me to turn off cellular data unless I need it. Any troubleshooting suggestions welcome!\n\nA: Figured out my issue. Was an iCloud shared video (sent to me via iMessage) that was on my phone but somehow was still constantly syncing. \nMaybe check there?\n", "Q: How to change the location of user's download folder?

Please don't judge, I accidentally deleted a big part, if not all, of the /usr/bin folder. \nHow can I confirm I did not do an irreversible damage to the MacBook?\n\nA: You cannot permanently damage your computer just by deleting files. At worst, you will render the OS non-functional.\nJust run the macos installer of your choice that is the same version (or newer) as your current os. This will fix everything needed to boot your Mac and not overwrite any user settings or programs or files. \nIf you have deleted only /usr/bin, (NB: not /user, which does not exist) then you should be able to restore this from your backup. It's normally hidden in the Finder, so press Command Shift dot to show hidden files in the Time Machine window. \nIf you think you may have deleted other files and folders, you would be well advised to re-install the OS. You should be able to download it from the Mac App Store (depending on what version you're on), and then just launch the app. Your user files and preferences will be maintained.\nDeleting system files is never a good idea: normally, you would have had to have bypassed a number of safety features and warnings to do this. If you want to ask another question about what you were trying to do, you may get an answer that provides a safer method.\n", "Q: Command+Tab switches windows in Mac OS rather than the ones inside Amazon WorkSpaces I  have latest Amazon WorkSpaces installed which I use to connect to my client desktop.\nI previously had Windows machine.

However, I often run XQuartz and use several xterms.  These are run from TWM.  Before Catalina I would be able to run ls, cd, vi, and other shell commands from within an xterm, even on the Desktop and Documents folder.  I have added XQuartz to the list of apps for Full Disk Access in the Preferences.  That doesn't fix the problem.  I have also given /opt/X11/bin/xterm Full Disk Access, but that doesn't fix it either.  Can anyone suggest what I might do to give the xterm commands permission to access these folders?  Thank you.\n\nA: The solution (at least for me) was to add the binary xquartz to the list of app with \"Full Disk Access\" (in the \"Privacy\" tab of the \"Security and Privacy\" setting of the \"System Preferences\"). The path to the binary is:\n/opt/X11/bin/Xquartz\nI also added \n/opt/X11/bin/xinit \nsince it's a running process, although I don't think it is needed...\nHowever, I am still having problems accessing iClouds folders (Document, Desktop, etc.)\n\nA: The problem is Catalina's new enhanced security that prevents apps from accessing Documents, Desktop, Downloads, external & network volumes, etc, etc, without granting permission.\nFor some reason, X11 apps (or XQuartz itself) don't ask for permission to be granted when you try to access those folders. And it doesn't seem possible to add an application to the Privacy panel in System Preferences (the + - icons are greyed out, even with padlock unlocked).\n\nA: A fix for me to let the XQuartz xterm run \"ls\" inside the Documents folder was to give my current shell \"/bin/bash\" full disk access permission in the \"Security and Privacy\" tab of System Preferences.  I tried all other X11-related startup processes with no luck. \nNOTE - as reported elsewhere you can use \"Command-Shift-.\" to show hidden folders like /bin in the Finder window that is opened when adding an app. \n\nA: For those who switched to the new zsh, please add /bin/zsh to the full disk access. It finally worked out for me...\n\nA: I found it necessary and sufficient to add /bin/bash (using Command+Shift+G to get to /bin) to the \"Full Disk Access\" list even though I'm running /usr/local/bin/bash.

All other messages around it open when touched and respond to long-press, but this message is completely unresponsive. Pressing \"Edit\" in the upper right corner of the inbox produces radio buttons to the left of all messages which respond as usual, but the radio button for this message is unresponsive.\nIn addition to the above, here are the things I've tried to remove this problematic message:\n\n\n*\n\n*Swipe up to quit the Mail app (multiple times)\n\n*Restarted the phone\n\n*Deleted this message using the iOS Gmail app and even used \"delete forever\" after it was in the trash\n\n*Restarted the phone again\n\n\nI also tried some different things within the Settings area for this account, but I was hoping not to have to go so far as to delete the account.\nI'm running iOS 13.1.3\n\nA: I found a way to solve the problem without deleting the email account in Settings. As mentioned in a comment to my original post, deleting the email account was undesirable in this case because it is an account accessed entirely via another account (which required significant time to figure out how to set that up).\nI was able to solve the problem by using the Safari browser on the iPhone to log into the gmail account where the problematic message was and deleting it via that browser gmail interface. Just to be sure, I also went to the trash there and deleted it forever.\nI then quit the iOS Mail app by swiping upward and then upon reopening found the message was finally gone.\nIt's surprising to me that message was still there in the Safari interface. After all, I had had already deleted (\"forever\") the same message using the gMail iOS app.\nI conclude that both the iOS Mail app and the iOS gMail app, though very convenient, do not provide the transparent control that the browser interface does.\n", "Q: Why does the same colour appear different in different apps? I've configured VSCode and iTerm2 to use the Solarized Dark colour scheme.\nAs far as I can tell, they are both using the same RGB colour specification for the background colour, but to my eye they appear slightly different.\nI used Digital Colour Meter to inspect both windows, and found that in sRGB they both report (0,44,55), while in \"native values\" VSCode reports (0,43,54), while iTerm2 reports (13,43,54). See pictures below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Why does this discrepancy exist?\n\n*What are \"native values\"?\n\n*Can I get these apps to look the same?\n\n\n\n\n\nA: The discrepancy exists because something/someone messed up handling of color spaces and/or color profiles.\nA very short and crude explanation: \nColors on computers are expressed as numbers - for example here as RGB with each color ranging from 0 to 255 (i.e. 24 bit color). \nComputer displays are not all alike - they can display different ranges of colors. This doesn't mean that some displays do not display anything when asked to show certain combinations of R, G and B. Instead a different color will be displayed. These are called \"native values\".\nIf you choose a certain color on your computer display and send that color code to your neighbour - you would ideally want him to be able to see the same exact color on his computer. If he has a different type of display, chances are that he would see a completely different color (here we're not even taking into account calibrating individual displays of the same type).\nIn order to solve this problem, you have the concept of color spaces and mappings between them:\nWhen you create the original color codes, you have to specify in which colour space you have defined them. I.e. for example define that the background color of this theme needs to be RGB (0,43,54) in sRGB. This is exactly what the Solarized Dark theme does.\nWhen you create a program to load in color codes, you'll need to take into account the color space of the color codes you read from an external source. I.e. the program needs to convert or map the color code from the colour space of the original file into an internal representation.\nFurthermore when that program wants to display the color on screen, it needs to map it to the color space of the connected monitor. \nTo show an example: Imagine you're using a MacBook Pro with a color space of Display P3 and load in the color RGB (0,43,54) in the sRGB color space. \nIf you look at an illustration of color spaces, you'll see that Display P3 is \"larger than\" (i.e. fully includes) sRGB. Therefore if something is defined as having a red value of 255 (max) in sRGB, it needs to have a lower value when mapped to Display P3 in order to leave room for those extra colors that Display P3 can display that aren't included in sRGB.\nThis means that (0,43,54) will need to be sent out to the display as a \"darker\" color code in order to achieve the same physical color when viewed by a human.\nIn addition to this color space management, there is the variation between individual displays of the same type. It is simply not possible to produce displays at the costs consumers are used to that are exactly alike in color reproduction.\nTherefore the displays are \"calibrated\" - meaning that their actual displayed colours are measured and compared against what they were supposed to be displaying - and a mapping to compensate for that discrepancy is made. That is stored as a \"color profile\" on your computer.\nIf a program doesn't support color spaces when reading in colours or when displaying them, or it doesn't support color profiles correctly - then you can end up with situations like this where the same color is displayed differently in different applications.\n", "Q: Hide the brightness and volume bezels in Catalina?

An unfortunate side-effect of pressing these buttons will be that a screenshot will be taken if you also turned on the feature to take a screenshot when these buttons are pressed.\nAfter your fingers are dry, you can end the workout in the normal manner by swiping to the right and tapping End.\n\nA: As long as you are connected to the Internet via iPhone or cellular watch, you can also use Siri to stop the workout - just say \"Stop Workout\".  Note that you can ask Siri other things like \"Start Swim\" or \"Add run\" to start a run after a swim for example.

I recently got a Mac upgrade to a new MacBook Air (10.14.6), which only has two new small USB-C connections. I therefore bought a USB-C to old USB adaptor to be able to connect my harddrives, USB sticks and the wireless mouse (working with a USB receiver). \nBut now it turns out that the mouse input is lagging a LOT compared to the old Mac (where I could use the USB receiver directly in a USB post). Also the mousepad itself works perfectly normal. \nThe lag is not only very disturbing when playing games (such as minecraft), but also with normal operations (finding and clicking on an app, dragging files etc). The lag is clearly a result of the USB C adaptor. \nSo how to avoid this problem best?

A USB-C to USB-A adapter cannot introduce lag on your mouse. It’s only a mechanical adapter from one type of plug to another - there’s nothing changed in the actual electric signal.\nI would look at:\n1) ensuring your have the correct driver\n2) ensure that there are no sources of noise near the wireless adapter (try disabling WiFi, Bluetooth etc on the Mac to see if it is disturbed by those)\n3) that the actual wireless antenna for the mouse is placed near the mouse\n", "Q: How to watch Apple TV+ shows on a TV without the Apple TV device?

So this could possibly be an option.\n\n\nAnything else I can do (short of buying Apple TV device)?\n\nA: You can watch Apple TV+ on the web at tv.apple.com.  From there, you can cast it to your Chromecast to watch on the LG tv.\nLG has a few tv's that currently support Apple TV+ but there's only 4 of them right now and you need to use AirPlay 2 to send the content to the tv:\n\n\n*\n\n*LG OLED (2019)\n\n*LG NanoCell SM8X series (2019)\n\n*LG NanoCell SM9X series (2019)\n\n*LG UHD UM7X series (2019)\n\n\nAs more manufacturers see if this is a success or not, you can expect to see changes in support.  \nI would recommend signing-up for the 7-day free trial and use a web browser to cast it to your tv.  You can then decide if it's worth buying an inexpensive/used Apple TV 3rd gen to continue (or not if you don't mind using the Chromecast).\nFor more info on devices and shows you can visit Apple's overview page.\n\nA: If you don't mind spending (slightly) on a new hardware, Roku Streaming Players or Amazon Fire TV Stick are both a fantastic option.\nBoth of them are economically priced, easy to setup, and support official Apple TV app.\n", "Q: How to locate 32 bit apps in iOS 13 I know that 32-bit applications do not run on iOS since iOS 11.

The USB drive flashing is a good sign that something is working.\nYou say the sound doesn't work, so you can't test whether it's working by making a sound.\nI would test plugging it into an external display.

The external drive has Sierra and this is what I always boot from. The internal is a clone of the external just for backup, cloned via SuperDuper.\nAccording to https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210190 I can update directly to Mojave on this Mac Mini. I downloaded the installer from the App Store and ran it to install on the external drive. It took about 25 minutes and gave a \"success\" message, prompting me to restart to finish. When I restarted, it booted from the internal drive instead. I went to the Startup Disk pref pane and made sure the external was selected and tried again. It booted again from the internal drive. Good thing I had it as a backup :)\nIn the Startup Disk pref pane, the external drive is selectable but it still shows as a Sierra boot. I can tell the install did write to the external drive but I suppose it didn't finish. I ran the installer again -- it only took a few minutes and again showed \"success\" and a restart prompt. Same result.\nI cloned the working internal boot drive back to the previously-working external SSD. So in theory I would be back where I started, with the SSD running Sierra and being my boot drive. But it still won't boot into it and it still shows as a valid choice in the Startup Disk pref pane. I tried resetting the NVRAM but no luck. And holding option at boot does nothing -- yes, it's a wired keyboard ;)\nThoughts?\n\nA: Just to close the loop --\nOption at boot worked when I switched the keyboard to a different USB port. I can now boot into my external drive(s) but only via the boot menu, not by setting it Startup Disk pref pane. Not perfect but good enough and thankfully a simple solution.\n\nA: When upgrading from Sierra to High Sierra, the firmware on older Mac logic boards is also updated. This allows a Mac to boot the newer macOS versions (starting with High Sierra) from APFS container partitions. Sierra can not be installed to boot from a APFS container, but Sierra can recognize APFS and therefore allows the selection an APFS volume with Mojave as the startup disk. However, the firmware may not agree with the selection. Possible reasons for failure are given below.\n\n\n*\n\n*The upgrade from Sierra to Mojave do not also update the firmware.\n\n*The firmware update did not occur because you used an external drive to upgrade macOS.\n\n\nYou could backup your important data to an external drive, then do a clean install of High Sierra to the internal drive. If High Sierra is not available, then select a newer version of macOS. Afterwards, you can do a clean install of Mojave to the external drive.\nUpdate:\nBack when High Sierra was first released, I remember many questions similar to your question were posted here a Ask Different. I believe the consensus was that the firmware can  only be upgraded from the internal drive. The update is written to the EFI partition on the drive before the firmware is instructed to update itself. The firmware is not capable of reading the update file from a USB drive. The firmware is capable of reading the update file from the first internal drive (disk0).\n\nA: I have a similarish issue. 2013 Mac, running Catalina upgraded from High Sierra.  I could actually boot to a external SSD then a install broke that (still not sure what happened). Through recovery i reinstalled to my old internal drive (which i thought was broken), all good.\nThen attempt to recreate my external drive. I tried everything to create a bootable external SSD with no luck.  Everytime i tried, i could start a install but it wouldn't complete, on reboot it just went back to the login page.\nI could only reach Recovery if i disconnected the external drive.  I've now tried partitioning the old drive to see if that works which it does!  So i can create two bootables just on the same drive. Still can't create externally though.\nWhat was the issue with the USB ports?\n\nA: I had a similar experience with a Late 2013 iMac 27\" with intel Core i5.\nEdit: I was made aware that this sounds like I have this problem too. But I created this post because I was able to fix this issue. TLDR is \"boot into safe mode\" but I followed a long list of troubleshooting Steps before I got it to work, if you’d like you can go through what I did.\nBackground: I have a mechanical HDD built in. I had also upgraded to Catalina, but because of some bugs, I downgraded to Mojave. Along with that, for some improved performance, I created a bootable install of Mojave on a Crucial 500GB ssd inside of a USB-C enclosure, (and a USB-A to USB-C adapter from Monoprice)\nI started booting from that external drive and things were manageable for a while. I say manageable and not perfect because occasionally, after leaving my iMac unattended, I would come back to find my iMac rebooted into the internal HDD OS. I then simply rebooted to the external SSD.\nHowever, since yesterday, I stopped being able to boot into the ssd install. It would always come back to the install on the internal HDD.\nI tried the following steps:\n\n*\n\n*Plug external SSD into a different USB-A port on the iMac.\n\n*Run First Aid on SSD from Disk Utility multiple times between attempts to boot from it.\n\n*Plug the external SSD into my Belkin Thunderbolt 2 dock's USB-A port.\n\n*Try a fresh, unused USB-C to USB-A adapter to connect SSD to iMac directly and via Belkin's Thunderbolt 2 dock.\n\n*Test the ssd on MacBook-Pro with thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports. (MacBook Pro booted up from the external SSD just fine.)\n\n*Tried to boot on iMac from SSD now(In case a successful boot changed some settings)\n\n*Tried to hold down option while booting into iMac to get to the startup disc choice screen. But iMac refused to boot into that mode.\n\n*Reset PRAM and NVRAM on iMac. Still no luck getting SSD to work.\n\n*Used ⌘+R to boot into recovery mode. Got into recovery mode from the internal HDD and restored from previous time machine backup onto SSD. SSD was erased and Mojave was re-installed and/or restored. Still unable to boot from SSD.\n\n*Rebooted in safe mode, still from the HDD.\n\n*Tried to restart from ssd but rebooted into HDD in normal mode.\n\n*Plugged the Apple bluetooth keyboard into the iMac via USB-A to lightning cable.\n\n*Restarted and held down option. This time it finally worked and I see options to boot from: HDD or time machine. SSD was still not showing up. At that time, it was still plugged into the Belkin Thunderbolt dock.\n\n*Unplug SSD and plugged it into the iMac USB-A port. The SSD finally showed up as an option to boot from!\n\n*booted into SSD in safe mode first. Then restarted in normal mode. SUCCESS!\n\n*I was asked for my iCloud password to start restoring all settings I suppose.\n\n\nA: I had a similar issue with a Late 2012 iMac 27\" with a (partially) broken fusion drive. So i wanted to install Catalina on external SSD because an internal hd replacement seemed quite complicated for this iMac model...\nI then ran into the same issues that the installation on the external ssd was initiated successfully, but upon first reboot, the external ssd was not detected and the system bootet to the internal drive.\nI finally got this fixed by using a newer enclosure for my SSD drive. I first used a quite old USB3.0 enclosure and had already ordered a newer one for better performance and after switching the enclosure, the installation went through fine.\n", "Q: Force quit on a MacBook that uses a touchbar I have a 2018 MacBook Pro with a Touchbar. Sometimes it will freeze up and I cannot access the Apple menu to run Force quit. Normally, you would be able to use Command+Option+Esc. \nHowever, the Command+Option+Esc method is not working for me. I'm thinking it may be because the Esc key is not a real key. I have no idea whether it is being registered. \nIs there any other way to issue a Force Quit without rebooting my system?\nPS. Making the Esc key a software-based key is not the smartest thing Apple could have done.\nUpdate\nIn response to questions, one application that I am noticing this with the most is Audacity. I am processing a few hundred audio files using a macro. The macro is very simple: trim areas of silence, normalize, save as mp3. The script works perfectly on a Windows machine.\nSymptoms: Things just slow to a halt. I can move the mouse easily. But if I try to interact with anything on the Mac Desktop (through keyboard or mouse) things are very slow to respond. For example, just to open up Spotlight (Command-space) and type \"terminal\" takes about 10-15 minutes. Trying to open the Apple Menu it does not seem to respond (or maybe I'm just not waiting long enough). \n\nA: You can use Karabiner to customize shortcut on your keyboard as you please, give it a try ! \nYou can remap the Esc key to another key or combination or just add another force quit rule than Command+Option+Esc (like Command+Option+Q).\nFrom Karabiner Manual :\nChange a key to another key\nYou can change a key to another key in Simple Modifications tab. \n\n\n*\n\n*Step 1 : Choose target device, then press Add item button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Step 2 : Select From key and To key.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Step 3 : Confirm the result in Karabiner-EventViewer.\n\n\nUse more complex rules\n\n\n*\n\n*Step 1 : Open Complex Modifications tab and press Add rule button, then press Import more rules from the internet button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Step 2 : A web browser is opened.

You go to the Mission Control and switch to another apps, I think it'll be OK. My apps usually freezes in their own space only.\n\nA: Use the Force Quit... option under the  menu.\n\nA: If the OS has managed to keep running though slowly, if you can CMD-TAB to Finder, or use the mouse to navigate to a different application of Finder, then you can get the Apple menu open.\nWhatever macro you're using, you should find a way to have it work in batches, or accept that your laptop will not be usable during that process.\nGiven that you are able to access spotlight, but it takes so long, it's possible CMD-OPT-ESC is registering but the OS is taking a long time to catch up.  Is the touchbar responsive at all?\nAlso are you sure you're running the latest version of Audacity?  I believe they made some major updates to better utilize newer CPUs as well as run better in newer Mac OS versions.\nI would be curious if the Windows version is handling them one by one while on Mac it's attempting to run all or many in parallel.\n", "Q: BKAgentServiceErrorDomain error 8 This error is shown in a dialog when you're trying to open a book.

I have been dealing with this problem for few months, I was using bootcamp on my iMac late 2013, and after a while its driver corrupted using too much disk space and slowing down. So I deleted it and created a new bootcamp partition but my problems didn't end there. Every time I shut down my computer its windows files would corrupt again making me redownload windows. And few days ago this corruption affected my main iMac drive too. I can repair the disk through disk utility because its giving me exit code 8, my internet recovery mode is giving me code -2002f and its startup is extremely slow ( only the part where you enter your password and log in) everything else is fine. Startup problem is the same problem i had with the bootcamp. I was getting black screens during startups. I wasn't able to delete my bootcamp partition until today because the disk utility didn't let me to do it. I deleted it through terminal and now I am dealing with my main drive corruption. I plan to sell this iMac very soon due to educational fees and I want to fix this before I sell it. I am currently trying to log into single user mode but its keep failing to mount disk0s2 and there is a small white circle with a cross on the screen. How can I fix this? Would formatting my iMac solve all my driver problems? \n\nA: The 2013 iMac was offered with 1TB hard drive, Fusion drive, or SSD. The first two of these use mechanical spinning platter hard drives, which are expected to have a limited life before failing.\nAfter six years, it's likely that the drive is failing, and so Erasing or repartitioning it won't help. Replacing the drive is possible, but \"moderately difficult\". \n", "Q: Is it possible to whitelist contacts using the iOS iMessage app or iOS parental controls? I would like to use the iOS parental controls (aka Screen Time) to allow a family member to only call or text specifically whitelisted contacts or numbers.  \nAs far as I can tell this is not possible with Screen Time, only full access or full denial of use of the app is possible.  The same seems to be true with the most commonly recommended third party app, OurPact.\nIs this possible with iOS?  Is there a third party app that can accomplish this?\n\nA: There is not a way to whitelist contacts as the default in Screen Time.  However, you can choose specific contacts to whitelist during downtime.  This only gets you part of what you're asking for but, as per the comments, you wanted more info on how to do this.  The answer assumes you're using iOS 13 (wasn't mentioned in your question).

I have an early 2014 MacBook Air running Catalina (10.15 - 19A602). Updating Xcode always takes an inordinate amount of time, and it's usually the \"installing\" phase (looking at Launchpad) that takes most of it.\nCurrently, I see \"Installing, 7.78 GB of 7.78 GB\" displaying in Launchpad.\nGiven that Xcode is the worst offender of all apps that update from the store in terms of update time, is there a better approach for updating it to make it more predictable/interactive? Is a delete-and-clean-install a better alternative?\n\nA: Yes, it is perfectly safe to close the lid during updating of Xcode. The update process will of course pause, but resumes automatically when you open the lid again later.\nI don't think a method exists to make the update timing of Xcode more predictable or interactive. The progress indication they share is all we get, and it may sometimes be off by a lot.\nDelete-and-clean-install seems to work quicker for me in some cases at least. However, I haven't experienced any negatives coming from updating Xcode in place (except the wait while updating).\n\nA: I run a caching server locally so that the first time I download a large installer - it's local. That saves me so much time and grants me great patience for the first download.\nSecond, I have a Mac mini that's headless and I do the first install / cache warming there so I know things are primed for when it matters. You could do that to a VM if you didn't want to hold up your main machine and had space and CPU to spare.\nI delete Xcode before installing it and also have Time Machine exclude it so I don't waste time backing it up. Not sure if they make any difference. Lastly, Daisy Disk is my weapon of choice for finding all the large directories once I remove Xcode to purge them. I suppose a script would be nice, but I haven't really lost that much time to running Daisy Disk and it shows me the rest of the c̶r̶a̶p̶ valuable content I might need to clean up.\n", "Q: Where do I update Google account details in iOS13?

They use web interfaces as overlays, at the time of login.\nAs in macOS Mojave's mail too, there is no password field, Google is now using Safari. \nSo if you have changed the password of your Google account, it should automatically notify you and ask for password. But if you want to trigger it manually, try toggling off and on the mail  switch from the list. \nFor a drastic approach(if it's a big mailbox), Deleting it and adding it back will allow you to change the password. \n\n\n\n", "Q: Developer not identified error when logging in Oracle Instantclient on Catalina I have the Oracle Instantclient installed (PHP needs it for the oci extension to work), the install directory is /opt/instantclient_19_3 and every time I log in after a reboot I get the following error messages which read translate to\n\nlibclntsh.dylib.18.1 cannot be opened because the developer can't be verified. \n  libclntshcore.dylib.19.1 cannot be opened because the developer can't be verified\n\nI had the same errors popup when using Terminal and Hyper but since I've allowed those apps full disk access everything works fine.

(It shows just one in Finder) After a time machine migration from an old iMac (non-fusion drive) to my new iMac (Fusion Drive), I noticed that in Disk Utility, my Fusion drive lists two volumes: \"Macintosh HD\" and \"Macintosh HD - Data\". In Finder, I just see \"Macintosh HD\". Is my drive split or is this normal behavior in Disk Utility? \n\n\n\nA: This is normal for all Catalina system/boot volume layouts independent of the number of physical disks involved.\nThe various main partitions (here disk0s2 & disk1s2) of the single physical disks of a Fusion Drive are combined as physical stores to one container: disk2. The predecessor (CoreStorage) did the same.\nThe whole container (here disk2) is divided into various APFS volumes with different roles: Preboot, Recovery, VM, Data and System. Each volume can be enlarged or shrunk dynamically.\nThe last two are combined in one APFS volume group.\nYou get all available APFS volume groups by entering diskutil ap listVolumeGroups.\nThe system volume (role: System, name: Macintosh HD, device: disk2s5) is mounted read-only. The necessary read-write data volume (role: Data, name: Macintosh HD – Data, device: disk2s1) is mounted to /System/Volumes/Data.\nBy default various folders of the Data volume are firmlinked to various folders of the System volume. They are needed to add user installed apps/binaries/frameworks etc. and user content (which requires a r/w volume) in a transparent way. The list of a all current firmlinks is available at /usr/share/firmlinks.\nThe two devices in the APFS volume group (disk2s1 & disk2s5) mustn't be confused with the two physical devices (disk0 & disk1). Both APFS volumes may partially reside on both physical disks.\nAt least the APFS volumes with the roles Data and System are shown as separate devices in Disk Utiliy. I expect the volumes with the roles USER, Undefined and Installer (which don't exist in the standard partition scheme) to be also shown in Disk Utility – I haven't tested this though.\nFurther reading and pics of the various stages of Catalina APFS volume schemes:\n\n\n*\n\n*macOS Catalina Boot Volume Layout   \n\n*Working with APFS Volume Groups\n", "Q: sysmond using 100% CPU usage, but only while on the Memory tab I used to have no issues with this, but all of a sudden sysmond is using 100% CPU while I have Activity Monitor set to the Memory tab. sysmond runs normally while in any other tab (CPU, Energy, Disk, Network).

It still uses 100% while I'm on the memory page. I am using macOS 10.14.6, on a MacBook Pro.\n\nA: I've fixed it. I had shared memory and private memory both checked.

In Everymac.com for example, Unibody macbook pros are 2008 to 2012 (up to Retinas).  But then it's also used in Macbooks (not Pros).\nIs there a definition of this term that’s somewhat authoritative?\n\nA: The tag here is pretty authoritative to explain how unibody came about on the MacBook line where a united piece of aluminum was machined to house all the internal parts. This differs from the previous construction where discrete parts were assembled / welded / screwed and placed together.\nThis process is also used on non portable computers, but the difference in stiffness and reduction of size was most dramatic on the MacBook and MacBook Pro lines which then enabled the entire iPhone / iPad / Watch lines to evolve and refine what the unibody manufacturing changed on portables.\nApple doesn’t flat out define the term in the February 2019 Apple Style Guide, but the transition was when the original black keyboards arrived on the scene for the intel line MacBook Pro (initially) and later to the Air and MacBook lines.

They were grouped by year/month/day of import and all files had their original file names eg. IMG_123456.jpeg\nRecently I've noticed that Masters directory is missing (probably after update to Catalina). Imported photos seem to be located in ~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/originals/ directory, however directories structure is illogical and file names are some hash values eg. 33487C0A-C816-4EE1-9F8D-49E20E1A06A4.jpeg.\nDoes anyone know why is that? Can the \"previous\" approach with \"Masters\" directory be restored? How to retrieve files with their original names from Photos Library?\n\nA: Is there a reason you want/need to do this via the Finder, exploring the Photos Library.photoslibrary package database?\nIf you are going to do that, why not just \"import\" the files from your SD Card using Finder? Skip importing via Photos entirely.\nIf you are importing into Photos, I'd suggest you also export via Photos.app rather than exploring its folder structure. Select the photos you want, then select File > Export. This will export the photos using their original metadata and filenames.\n\nA: Although it looks tempting (guilty as charged here), you should never directly edit the Photos Library.photoslibrary bundle in which Photos.app manages photos, screenshots and movie clips.\nI suppose that the fundamental changes in the bundle structure and file naming (GUID based) in Catalina were in part motivated due to people directly interacting in the bundle, potentially breaking the Photos.app library, as Photos.app never assumed someone would interfere.\nIf you want to manage your photos with Photos.app, then the only official way is to import the photos from within Photos.app.\nKeep in mind that Photos.app will \"stack\" originals and modified photos where only the most recently modification will show (hiding the master and the older modifications). For some this works, for some not.\n", "Q: How did my photos get transferred to my new iPhone even though they weren't in iCloud? I bought a new iPhone to replace my old one.\nMy iCloud had been full for a while because of photos. So I took care of that first before doing a device backup to iCloud.\nBefore powering on the new one:\n\n\n*\n\n*I disabled photos sync to iCloud and deleted all photos from iCloud.\n\n*I performed a device backup to iCloud.\n\n*I confirmed that iCloud showed no data was being used by photos, and that the backup had finished uploading.\n\n\nThen I powered up the new phone. During setup, I did the \"hold phone near each other\" sync process, and part of that process prompted me to download the backup that I had just made (I did so). I finished setting up the new phone, and then powered down the old phone. I completely powered it down (holding down the button). I have not powered up the old phone since.\nAfter that point, I checked my photos -- they were empty. No photos.\nMany hours later (at least four), before bed, I checked photos again. Still empty, no photos.\nThe next morning, I checked my photos. Suddenly, they were all there. And I mean all of them, not just the recently-deleted ones that used to be in iCloud. I know this because my iCloud has been full for at least 6 months and has long since stopped syncing, but there were photos from last week.\nI'm certainly not complaining, because I planned on finding a way to transfer them over anyway, but I am surprised, confused, and a little bit weirded out.\nHow did my old phone's photos end up on my new phone, even though they weren't in iCloud and my old phone has been completely powered off the entire time?\n\nA: iCloud keeps your photos, and other documents, in the trash and ready for recovery for 30 days after they're deleted.  \nDepending on how many photos & files you have in iCloud, it can take hours or days for a sync to complete.  You didn't indicate if you deleted the photos from iCloud.com or from a device.  You also didn't mention if you had other devices signed-in to the same iCloud account.  It's important to note that iCloud doesn't do real-time syncing of files.  It does it on its own schedule.\nWhen you deleted the photos in iCloud, they went into the Trash.  They were deleted but not technically deleted because iCloud allows you to recover items in the Trash for 30 days.\nI'm guessing (and I can only guess here, based on the info provided) that the iCloud deletion of the photos was registered after it did the restore of your new device.  If you have other devices signed-in to the same iCloud account, they might not have received the 'delete' message before you connected your new device.  Therefore, the new device got the \"sync all photos\" message before getting the \"delete all photos\" message.  \nConfusing, I know.\nGo to iCloud.com and verify your photos are in the trash.  If not, you can delete them (again).  Also, you can do a permanent delete from the trash on that site.  \nThen allow your new device, and all other devices, to sync again.  This could take several hours or a day.  When that's all done, your photos should be deleted from iCloud as well as deleted from all other signed-in devices.\n", "Q: Disable Wi-Fi and LAN if user is not logged in How can I disable internet ( Wi-Fi/ LAN ) on Mac Pro while user is not logged in or when the Mac is locked?\n\nA: There isn't a great way to script this, but I would consider implementing this on the network side if you really had a great reason to not allow this. It will break many things that run, but let's assume you have some compelling reasons.\n\n\n*\n\n*Simplest is firewall rules on your router to isolate that machine. Only allow outbound connections to a VPN and log in to that VPN when you log in to an account that should be able to connect out.\n\n\nThe reason to do this on the network side is that the system is designed to take the WiFi credentials and expose them even before the OS boots in case of FileVault and T2 security chip. Same with Ethernet - the system wants to enable all of the interfaces so that a net boot or internet recovery is possible so rather than fighting the design, I would implement this entirely on the network end.\nIf you can't do DMZ / FireWall / VPN, the first thing I would try is making the network settings intentionally wrong. Choose a non-existent gateway on a non-routable address. For example if your actual router is 192.168.1.1 - set your Mac to be on the 172.16.0.1 or 10.3.2.1 networks. Yes they are connected, but the default route will be wrong and you can make sure the network drops those packets. Any software that has hard coded network addresses or can discover DNS / mDNS will still work, so that's why I recommended a proper network setup to disable the network for your Mac instead of scripting or hobbling things in the settings.\n", "Q: Does \"Full Disk Access” include access to \"Files and Folders\" Privacy settings? In MacOS 10.15 new settings have been introduced in Security & Privacy that allow the user to determine access to files and folders for specific applications. \nFor example access to the 'Desktop' or 'Downloads' folder can now be controlled but also 'Network Volumes' and 'Removable Volumes'.\nIs granting 'Full Disk Access' to a process / application sufficient and includes the newer more specific permissions in Catalina for \"Files and Folders\"?\n\n\nA: The System Preferences screen is a bit vague (it says \"Allows specified apps access to data like Mail, Messages, Safari, Home, Time Machine backups, and certain administrative settings for all users on this Mac.\")\nHowever the Apple developer documentation is more explicit - it says Full Disk Access (SystemPolicyAllFiles) covers all protected file locations including the new ones you mention.  From PrivacyPreferencesPolicyControl.Services :\n\nSystemPolicyAllFiles Allows the application access to all protected files, including system administration files.\n\nMore fine-grained file locations are listed in the link, including those you asked about.  Specifically :\n\nSystemPolicyDesktopFolder Allows the application to access files in the user's Documents folder.\nSystemPolicyDocumentsFolder Allows the application to access files in the user's Downloads folder.\nSystemPolicyNetworkVolumes Allows the application to access files on network volumes.\nSystemPolicyRemovableVolumes Allows the application to access files on removable volumes.\n\nNote that PrivacyPreferencesPolicyControl says \"In the case of conflicting specifications, the most restrictive setting (deny) is used\" but it doesn't seem to be possible to grant Full Disk Access and revoke another permission in Files and Folders through System Preferences.\n\nA: Quoting the expert on the matter, Quinn “The Eskimo!” from Apple Developer Relations / Developer Technical Support:\nhttps://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/124895\n\nThere are two further levels of protection in play here:\n\n*\n\n*On 10.15 and later, certain common locations, like the Desktop, require Files and Folders access (see System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Files and Folders).\n\n\n*On 10.14 and later, certain obscure locations, like the mail database, require Full Disk Access (see System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Full Disk Access).\nThe latter subsumes the former.\nThese privileges can only be granted by the user.\n\nSo 'Full Disk Access' does give access to the 'Files and Folders' locations as well.\n", "Q: Permission denied for ls -l in a folder with symlinks I have a folder hierarchy \nparent_folder -> inner_folder -> innermost_folder \nThe steps I followed are (as a sudo user): \n\n\n*\n\n*created a symlink pointing to parent_folder\n\n*set the permissions of the symlink to 0400 => chmod -h 0400\n\n*set the owner (of symlink) to root => chown -h root\nNow I switch to normal user, \nran ls -l in the folder which has the symlink, it throws error : \n\nPermission denied \n\nIs this the expected behaviour?\n\nA: A symlink basically is a special file containing the path to the symlink target. So if you restrict access to the symlink itself to root you prevent all other users from reading the content of the symlink, which results in a \"permission denied\" error when ls tries to read the symlink to identify the target.\nTo prevent ls from following the symlink (reading its content), use ls -P.\n\nYou can still remove the symlink (or actually any file not owned/accessible by yourself) as long as you have write access to the directory the symlink is in. A directory is basically an index, you can add/remove entries from it even without having access to the content of these entries.\n", "Q: How do I print a single page document to multiple copies, double sided? I have a single page document, say \"A\".\nI'd like to print it multiple copies with double-sided, like below:\nsheet 1 front: A, back: A\nsheet 2 front: A, back: A\n...\n\nHowever, when printing with Preview, even with \"double-sided\" selected, I got:\nsheet 1 front: A, back: empty\nsheet 2 front: A, back: empty\n...\n\nAny methods?\n\nA: You can’t print a single-sided document double-sided. There is no second side.\nHere’s what you can do.\nUse the “Print” function in your app and choose “Save as PDF”.\n\nName the file something like “TwoSided.pdf”\nThen open “TwoSided.pdf” in Preview.app.\nIn Preview.app, choose View » Thumbnails.\nThe top of the document will say “TwoSided.pdf (1 page)”\nThen go back to Finder.app and drag “TwoSided.pdf” from finder to the Thumbnail column on the left hand side. Drop it when you are over the “Thumbnails” sidebar column.\n\nNow it should say “TwoSided.pdf (page 1 of 2)”. (or “page 2 of 2”… it’s the “of 2” that is important.)\n\nGo to File » Save\nNow go to File » Print and choose “Two-sided”.\n\nA: Easiest would probably be to make it a two-page document, then print two copies, double-sided. How you do this would depend on the application you're using.\n", "Q: How to clear all notifications with 1 click in Catalina? This question offers an AppleScript to clear all notifications within the Notification Center, but all of the answers seem to be pre-Catalina:\nHow do I clear All OS X notifications with 1 click?\nPost-Catalina, with the same script I get an error (reported via Keyboard Maestro) that the Notification Centre cannot access the \"close\" property of its windows. Looking through some of the AppleScript dictionaries it seems like Notification Center has no windows at all (anymore?).\nWhat would be the way to accomplish this in Catalina?\n\nA: When scripting the user interface, for things like windows and menus the object hierarchy usually doesn't exist until it is shown, so the object needs to be shown before trying to get its properties.  Once the window or menu is shown, you can use the Accessibility Inspector tool (included in the Xcode bundle) or manually spelunk the various UI elements to find the ones you are looking for.  Interestingly, the Automator \"Watch Me Do\" action is also very handy for identifying specific UI elements (probably its best use), as the events it records can be copy/pasted into the Script Editor.\nFor the Notification Center window, the layout can vary, as individual notifications each have close/dismiss buttons, and there can also be an overall close/dismiss button for notifications grouped by application, although they aren't labeled as such.  Since the topmost button is conveniently located in the same place, to just close/dismiss everything a script can be used to click on that element until there are no more (tested in Mojave and Catalina):\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    # show notification window\n    tell application process \"SystemUIServer\" to click menu bar item \"Notification Center\" of menu bar 1\n\n    # loop through the app close buttons\n    tell process \"Notification Center\" to try\n        repeat -- forever (at least until there are no more)\n            delay 0.25\n            click UI element 2 of UI element 1 of row 2 of table 1 of scroll area 1 of window \"Notification Center\" -- the topmost close button\n        end repeat\n    on error errmess -- no more\n        log errmess\n    end try\n\n    # close the window\n    # tell application process \"SystemUIServer\" to click menu bar item \"Notification Center\" of menu bar 1\nend tell\n\n\nA: Building on top of @red_menace's answer, which only works if you happen to be on the \"Notifications\" Tab already. Here's the code for automatically switching to the \"Notifications\" tab (and switching back to the \"Today\" view if desired)\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    \n    # Show \"Notifications\" Tab\n    tell application process \"SystemUIServer\" to click menu bar item \"Notification Center\" of menu bar 1\n    \n    tell process \"Notification Center\" to click radio button 2 of radio group 1 of window 1\n    \n    # loop through the app close buttons\n    tell process \"Notification Center\" to try\n        repeat -- forever (at least until there are no more)\n            delay 0.25\n            click UI element 2 of UI element 1 of row 2 of table 1 of scroll area 1 of window \"Notification Center\" -- the topmost close button\n        end repeat\n    on error errmess -- no more\n        log errmess\n    end try\n    \n    # close the window\n    tell application process \"SystemUIServer\" to click menu bar item \"Notification Center\" of menu bar 1\n    \n    # Return to \"Today\" Tab\n    tell process \"Notification Center\" to click radio button 1 of radio group 1 of window 1\n    \nend tell\n\n\nA: @red_menace has provided an excellent answer and explanation.  I would choose to script the closing of all notifications by targeting all of them at once in order to perform a single action.  It would be more efficient than a repeat loop, and should therefore produce a swifter clearance with little or no stalling.\nuse application id \"com.apple.SystemEvents\"\n\nproperty SystemUIServer : a reference to process \"SystemUIServer\"\nproperty menu bar : a reference to menu bar 1 of SystemUIServer\nproperty icon : a reference to menu bar item \"Notification Center\" of my menu bar\n\n\n-- If the notification centre icon isn't there,\n-- terminate execution (result: -1)\nif not (the icon exists) then return -1\nclick the icon -- Open notification centre\n\n-- Clear all notifications\nclick button 1 of UI element 1 of (rows ¬\n    of table 1 of scroll area 1 of ¬\n    window \"Notification Center\" of ¬\n    process \"NotificationCenter\" whose ¬\n    class of button 1 of UI element 1 = button)\n\nif not (the icon exists) return 0.5\nclick the icon -- Close notification centre\nreturn 1\n\nNote: Tested on High Sierra and Catalina with appropriate security privileges granted\n", "Q: Where is Android SDK manager download files? Actually, I installed Android Studio on my MacBook Pro and then requested the SDKs from the SDK manager of Android Studio. I set downloads and then abandoned the MacBook Pro in the office and now I see all downloads failed.\nSo I wanna find all downloaded packages or corrupted downloaded files or partially downloaded files and delete them.\nWhere does the Android Studio SDK manager download its files?\n\nA: \nIn Android Studio, open the Settings dialog (Preferences on macOS), then navigate to Appearance & Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK.\n  Change the value of Android SDK Location to C:\\WorkFolder\\AndroidSDK.\nTo avoid downloading the SDK again, make sure to copy the existing SDK directory, located at %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\SDK by default, to the new location.\n\nFrom https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/studio-config#antivirus-impact \n", "Q: How to change touch bar icons for iTunes / Music app? Several Apps have the option in [View -> Customise Touch Bar] to change the available icons on the specific App section of the Touch bar. \nUnfortunately I can't find the option on all apps, including Itunes / music app. Is the option a bit more hidden here or is it simply not there?\n\nA: There doesn’t seem to be a way to customize the Touch Bar for iTunes/Music. Not all apps support customization.\nApple:\n\nIn many apps, like Finder, Mail, and Safari, you can customize the Touch Bar.\n  Choose View > Customize Touch Bar. The customization window appears on your display, allowing you to choose your favorite items\n\nNote how they say “many” instead of “all” and don’t mention iTunes.

I have a brand-new iPhone 11 Pro and have used Halide to take some photos in RAW format. My standard method for processing is to plug the phone into my iMac (currently running 10.14.6) and import them into Lightroom then edit from there. However, anything I shoot in RAW will not show up in Image Capture or Lightroom. I've tested under Catalina and Mojave, and my wife used Obscura to take some RAW photos on a recent trip with her iPhone 7 also running iOS 13.2, and is having the exact same problem.\nHas anyone else a) run into this, and b) managed to fix it? It's supremely irritating. :(\n\nA: Looks like this was a bug that's since been resolved between either the macOS and/or iOS updates in recent months, I just checked now and can't replicate this behaviour anymore.\n", "Q: My MBP won’t start up and I can’t recover it using Time Machine This morning I wanted to restart my MacBook, and while it was loading, all of a sudden it got shut down. I think that it was downloading updates and couldn't install those because there was not enough space. I tried reinstalling macOS but due to a memory shortage, this also didn’t work. When I try to use Time Machine it also didn't help. I have searched my issues on the internet multiple times already, but I don’t know what to do. I have tried CTRL + S option also but it also didn’t work.\n\nA: Is the Time Machine backup on an external drive, a Time Capsule or NAS? Is it possible to inspect the state of the Time Machine backup at Finder level connected to another Mac? You should be able to see the date of the last successful backup and possibly an 'in progress' file which would signify the last backup failed to complete. Try delete this file, it might be the cause. Assuming the TC backups are accessible through the Finder, I would choose the 'Reinstall MacOS' option and install via Apple's servers, then do a restore via the Migration Assistant.   \n", "Q: Internal MacBook Wi-Fi only working after Safe Boot I am having very strange issues with my MacBooks Airport functionality.\nSometimes I cannot get any networks to show up at all. I tried a restart but even after that the issues persists. \nI already purged the usual files  also mentioned here\n\n\n*\n\n*New MBP suddenly can't find any more Wi-Fi networks\nSince I even booted the computer from a MacOS 10.14 Boot device with the Wi-Fi still not seeing networks, I am suspecting a sort of hardware issue. \nHowever. Booting into Diagnostic Mode and running the tests does not show any issues. \nOnly booting the Mac in Safe Mode once and then booting back into normal mode solves the issue for some time. \nWhat does Safe boot do with the Airport hardware or any other software to make it work again? \n\nA: I had the exact same problem. Are you by any chance running BBEdit? I found that the preference files were being stored as BBEdit text files rather than as ‘property list’. Trashed BBEdit and restarted...

I have an iMac (late 2009) with a broken graphics card. Fortunately, I have a new iMac (2019) which works fine.\nI want to boot the old machine to Target Disk Mode to retrieve the data on the computer. I've read online you can connect them using a FireWire cable. Now the new mac doesn't have an FireWire connection but I think I can use a Thunderbolt to FireWire cable. So I thought I'll just order an FireWire cable, but there are a lot of different types. So my question is:\nWhich FireWire cable do I need to connect an iMac (late 2009) to a Thunderbolt to FireWire connection to retrieve the data using Target Disk Mode?\n\nA: The iMac 2009 has a FireWire 800 port and the new iMac 2019 a Thunderbolt 3 port.\nThis requires three cables daisy-chained:\n\n\n*\n\n*FireWire 800 - FireWire 800\n\n*FireWire 800 - Thunderbolt 1/2: Apple Thunderbolt-naar-FireWire-adapter\n\n*Thunderbolt 1/2 - Thunderbolt 3: Adapter voor Thunderbolt 3 (USB‑C) naar Thunderbolt 2\nI found one source stating it's working: Le Target Disk Mode marche en USB-C, en Thunderbolt et en FireWire (en français, with pics) and another one stating more or less the opposite: Target mode between Macbook pro 2017 and Mac Pro 1.1.\n", "Q: Cant delete Time Machine .inProgress file After over a month of not running Time Machine, I tried to run it again, and it was stuck on \"Preparing Backup\" for ages (more than 10 hours). \nA Google search has led me to try trashing the .inProgress file. \nNow that file is in the trash, and I cannot empty the trash. It is stuck on \"Preparing to empty the Trash...\" for ages (again, we're talking hours).\nThe .inProgress file in question is 290GB, and is the only file in the trash.\nIs there a way to force empty the trash in this situation?\nI'm running MacOS Sierra (10.12.6) on a mid-2015 MBP. The hard disk I'm backing up is 1TB, of which 746GB are in use.\n\nA: I've been through this one and as I recall patience is a virtue, the length of time is linked to the size of the file.

If I close Firefox (Cmd + Q), I would expect that the values return to 500MB and 2.0GB respectively. Well it does not happen how is expected, for example: the Kernel Task returns to 650MB (and not to 500MB) and the Memory Ram returns to 2.2GB (and not 2.0GB).\nI have this behavior with other programs apart of Firefox. \nIs there a command where I can free in general all the kernel task and memory ram? At least to the best acceptable minimum values according to the OS itself after to execute the command.\nThe goal is after to execute some \"heavy\" software development tools and servers (therefore when they have just been closed), release the best amount of resources of these two components.\n\nA: There's no ordinary system command for that purpose - simply because it is not what you would normally want.\nThe memory used here will help the performance of your system by caching data that might be needed later. If it is not needed later, because you need to load something different in RAM, the caches will be released automatically.\nHowever, you can simulate such a command by simply making a small program that allocates progressively larger amounts of memory until you have cleared up all caches. There's no real point in doing so however as it won't help your system run faster, or be able to run more programs or anything like that.\n", "Q: Mac mini not autobooting after \"dirty\" shutdown This Mac mini is intended to run as a kiosk, but a daily sleep/wake cycle is proving problematic with some USB devices.\nMy plan was to use the \"dirty\" shutdown from the commands line to simulate a UPS shutdown: sudo shutdown -hu now.\nThe process is to enable the \"Start automatically after a power failure\" option in Energy Saver prefs, then to execute the dirty shutdown from the command line, and finally, remove power once the power light goes out, but before the 5 minute timeout.\nTests on other minis have been successful, but this 2018 3.6 i3 Mac Mini is not consistently starting up once you supply power. This morning it started automatically when I plugged it into the mains. But later in the day, additional tests did not result in power being enabled without physically pressing the power button.\nRunning Mojave 10.14.6. Reset PRAM/NVRAM. pmset -g shows autorestart set to 1. The Mac WILL restart when I forcibly cut power to it.\nPlease note I do NOT have a UPS connected to the system.\nWhat could be causing the inconsistent behaviour?\n\nA: The first thing I would try is resetting the System Management Controller (SMC), as it's responsible for power management, sleep/wake/hibernation, restarts/shutdowns, and so on.\nResetting the SMC on a 2018 model Mac mini\nFor your particular Mac mini you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac mini\n\n*Press and hold the power button for at least 10 seconds\n\n*Let go of the power button and wait five seconds\n\n*Switch your Mac mini on again\n\n\nNow test to see if this has resolved the issue. If not, then try resetting the SMC with the following steps instead:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac mini\n\n*Unplug the Mac mini from its AC power source\n\n*Wait at least 15 seconds\n\n*Plug the Mac mini back into its AC power source\n\n*Wait at least another five seconds\n\n*Switch your Mac mini on again\n\n\nNow test again to see if this has resolved the issue.\n\nA: Perhaps when you simulate a UPS shutdown with : sudo shutdown -hu now it uses the pmset settings for UPS (set with pmset -u or pmset -a).\nTry running pmset -g custom to see if there are additional settings for UPS that have different values, or see if you can set the required parameters for pmset -u even though you don't have UPS.\n", "Q: \"dscacheutil -q group -a name admin\" returns a user that I can't find I ran a script that was checking for any other admin users on my mac.\ndscacheutil -q group -a name admin\n\nIt returned: root administrator Temp10\nI can't find the Temp10 user account anywhere. I tried listing all the users using dscl . list users but I couldn't find the user account there either.\nMaybe it's just a remnant of an old user somewhere? If so how can I remove it from that dscacheutil list?\n\nA: After trying a bunch of different things I had the idea to create a new admin user account called Temp10 manually. And then delete that account. That seems to have resolved the problem. There must have been some remnant of the account left over from something that didn't clean up after it got deleted.\n", "Q: How to properly downgrade from Catalina to Mojave with no internal free space left? Today I upgraded my Macbook Pro to Catalina, but after realising that I can't get files from my Samsung SSD and can't to few other features, I try to downgrade to Mojave again.\nThe downgrade method I read was through a Time Machine, but after an hour of recovering my stuff, there was an error window that says \"An Error Occurred Restoring from Backup\".\nAfter that I tried to reinstall my macOS, but I can't do it anymore, because I have no space left on my Macintosh HD (only 300 MB free space, before all of this there were a 50 GB of free space).\nWhat should I do? What is the best way to get back to my files? To delete everything on Macintosh HD via Disk Utility and then try to get back all of the stuff from Migration Assistant, or is there any better ways to do this?\n\nA: Assuming your backup is good, use Disk Utility to wipe the disk from within Recovery mode, install Catalina clean (again from within Recovery) then use the Migration Assistant to restore everything. This should warn you if you're going to end up with a space problem and allow you to exclude certain items from the restore. \n", "Q: accountsd eating up all CPU resources when wireless has no internet connectivity it's a shame that the OS have degraded to this levels of breakage and bugs.\nThere's a way to stop accountsd from eating up all my CPU when I'm without internet access in a wireless connection for LAN only?\n\nSo there's any workaround for this?

I need to do a few little scripts on my Mac but I don't really want to install Xcode or Python for a full environment, just a quick command line deal.\nDoes macOS come with anything suitable out of the box?\nAs an example I want to process files in a directory and do some custom logic.\n\nA: I'm on Mojave and Python, Ruby, and Perl are installed by default. But I understand that there is a Deprecation notice with Catalina that says future versions of macOS won't include scripting languages by default.\nAs suggested, as a clarification there are Unix shells in macOS, although in Catalina the default shell is zsh.\nTesting on a 10.5.8, El Capitan and a Mojave computer - perl, ruby and python responded on the command line without providing any paths. Perl and ruby are  in /usr/bin/ on each machine.\n\nA: In addition to the languages already mentioned in other answers, macOS Mojave also comes with the general purpose programming language PHP, which is well suited to processing a number of files in a directory and performing custom logic.\nIn addition, macOS Mojave also comes with the programming languages awk and m4 that are specifically suited for processing text files in this manner.\nIf you're also looking at compiled languages, it is possible to use C, C++ and Objective-C from the command line without installing the whole XCode. You only need to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. In that same package you'll find the \"swift\" command that allows you to run scripts in the Swift programming language without having to compile them first.\n\nA: You have good old bash (or csh, or whatever). You can use it to write shell scripts.\n\nA: Terminal runs the Unix shell, (bash, zsh, and others) which is obviously a command line scripting environment, which can execute complex scripts, particularly file processing.\nPython 2.7 comes bundled with MacOS, and always has done.

Ok, I’m in a bit of a pickle here. I wanted to install the latest macOS 10.15.1 update today and was initially told that I needed to “free up more space”, since the upgrade expects about 19 GB of free space. Ok, I did that and the upgrade installer launched (after a restart). Unfortunately, it told me (again) that I do not have enough free disk space and I was supposed to restart the machine to free up more space. Ok, I tried that but I am now stuck on the login screen. Every time I login the loading bar progresses to about 50% and the screen just turns black.\nI went to the Apple store today and they mentioned I should just try to re-install macOS.\nI can see the answers suggested here on how to accomplish that: Mac stuck in restart cycle after failed macOS Catalina update\nHowever, when trying to recover / reinstall macOS - the installer also tells me - you don’t have enough free space to reinstall macOS.\nSo I am left wondering - why is there no option (e.g. in Disk Utility) to selectively free up some space.

It's not uncommon for batteries to exceed or fall short of this number; as every user is different in terms of what they use their computers for and how/when they're using AC power etc. So the 1,000 cycles is just an estimation of how long it can last. At 658 cycles it's more than likely that your battery is still okay, but it's also not unheard of that it could be on its way out.\nIf I was you I'd try resetting the SMC.\nReset the SMC\nTo reset the System management Controller on your particular MBP, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the power cable plugged in\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button and hold all these down for at least 10 seconds\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nNow use your computer to determine if the issue still persists.

However, I suggest you select the \"Perform extended testing\" checkbox before you click the Test button.\n\n*Your test results will appear in the window in the bottom-right of the console.\n\n\nNote 1: that the extended test will take some time. Take a note of the results and report back. \nNote 2: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete. Be aware that if you connect to the internet via an ethernet cable instead of Wi-Fi, then keep this cable plugged in during the process.\n1 If you need to use an external keyboard, mouse or display you can keep these connected. However, if you don't need to, then test your MBP without these being connected.\n\nA: You should download and run the app Coconut Battery and report back what this tells you. This app checks the health of your battery and will give you some details about the charging of battery as well.\n\nA: The battery is actually a collection of cells and it's possible that one of the cells has failed in a way that doesn't accurately reflect in the meter of charge remaining. I have the same issue, also a 2013 MBP, and it will shut down sometime between 20-30%. I don't stress it with tasks like video editing at the moment, but if I did it would not surprise me to see that 30% figure rise even higher.\nSo I think a failed cell is the most probable cause.\nThe easiest way to confirm is to see if it still happens when the laptop is connected to the power supply. If it behaves well on the power supply, I would take that as the best evidence.\nTo double check, you could open the console and search for all occurrences of when it unexpectedly shut down and confirm it only happening on battery, but that may be a bit time consuming. If you know scripting that would make it quicker.\nFurther explanation:\nBatteries are actually very complex; with chemistry, engineering, electricity, electronics, pressure and general physics all playing a role.\nYou can read here the many reasons why batteries fail  \nAs an example of how this could play out to produce what we are experiencing, consider the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*A failing battery causes pressure build up\n\n*Pressure causes heat\n\n*The heat causes higher discharge (depleting the battery more quickly) \n\n*The higher discharge rate fools the meter into thinking it has\nhigher remaining capacity than it does (hence the false capacity reading)\n\n*Stressing the computer with more demanding work produces additional\nheat, accelerating the cycle.\n\n*And possibly, if the battery interprets this as a risk of thermal\nrunaway the safety circuits may then shut the battery power down\nimmediately.\n\n\nA: Although Apple says calibration on newer devices is not necessary, because the batteries are supposed to be pre-calibrated / calibrate themselves, in my experience calibrating the battery helps against random shutdowns on Macs and iPhones with degrading batteries.\nAs described this awesome iFixit guide, the steps are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Charge it to 100%, and keep charging it for at least two more hours.\n\n*Unplug your laptop and use it normally to drain the battery.\n\n*Save your work when you see the low battery warning.\n\n*Keep your laptop on until it goes to sleep due to low battery.\n\n*Wait at least five hours, then charge your laptop uninterrupted to 100%.\n\nIt is recommended to perform this process periodically to ensure that the battery remains properly calibrated throughout its lifespan.\n\nAdding to these suggestions, i would sometimes restart the computer after step 4. and press alt to get a low-level boot menu to drain the battery completely.\nAlso, make sure to have a look at the tips on Apple's official support document on batteries.\n\nA: the app indicates your battery has already 658 cycles. batteries of that macbooks lives only 500 cycles. you have to replace the battery\n", "Q: AirPods Pro on Mojave I am thinking of buying the new AirPods Pro but according to the support page, you “need” at least macOS Catalina 10.15.1 in order to use them. However this is surely misleadingly worded since AirPods work with any modern Bluetooth audio host (Windows, Android, etc.). My question is, since I rely on 32-bit apps on Mojave, what exactly does it mean to not have one of the new OSes?\nAFAIK no definitive explanation exists, here are the possible differences I’ve gathered (I don’t know which are true):\n\n\n*\n\n*You’ll have to (gasp) manually pair the AirPods to each device\n\n*You’ll need to set up button behavior, size test, etc. on one of the newer OSes but your settings should carry over to all devices\n\n*You’ll need to control noise canceling via the button on the AirPods themselves instead of... a nested menu of the volume button on the menu bar (does this include the Touch Bar?)\n\n*No audio sharing\n\n*Switching between devices might be affected somehow (how?)\n\n\nIs this correct and is there anything else?\n\nA: I'm have been using the AirPods Pro with Mojave, so it is definitely possible to use them together.\nI didn't need to manually pair the AirPods Pro to the MacBook Pro running Mojave. It paired them with my iPhone, and it automatically synced to the MacBook Pro.\nSqueezing the stem of the AirPods to enable/disable ANC, play/pause, forwards/backwards in tracks all works without problems.\nThere's no setting for ANC in Mojave, but I can control volume up/down like with the regular AirPods.\nSwitching between devices seem to work the same as with the AirPods. I.e. I can be listening to Spotify on my iPhone, and then on my Mojave Mac click the speaker icon in the status bar and select the AirPods - and I will be hearing sound from the Mac instead of the iPhone.\nMojave also supports displaying charge status of the AirPods Pro in that menu - similar to the AirPods.\nAs far as I know, Audio Sharing is an iOS-only feature - so that wouldn't be available with either Mojave or Catalina.\n\nA: \n  \n*\n  \n*You’ll have to (gasp) manually pair the AirPods to each device\n  \n*You’ll need to set up button behavior, size test, etc. on one of the newer OSes but your settings should carry over to all devices\n  \n*You’ll need to control noise canceling via the button on the AirPods themselves instead of... a nested menu of the volume button on\n  the menu bar (does this include the Touch Bar?)\n  \n*No audio sharing\n  \n*Switching between devices might be affected somehow (how?)\n  \n\n\n\n*\n\n*I think this has always been the case. MacOS doesn't have the fancy pairing menu that iOS does. Theres an App called Airbuddy that adds this functionality\n\n*This is very likely one of the reasons\n\n*also this is another likely reason\n\n*I dont think macOS supports audio sharing for bluetooth devices at all. I may be mistaken.\n\n*I am not sure about this.\n\n", "Q: How to sync Downloads folder to iCloud?

So I’m downgrading the OS from Mojave to back to Lion..backed up hd with TimeMachine. I will erase the drive and install the older OS. My question is will I be able to restore my applications from my TM backup? \n\nA: You will be able to restore everything from the backup which was done on the same or an older version of macOS Lion (10.7.5 was the latest, so if you just downloaded it from the App Store, you will probably have this one).\nFrom later backups you have to copy/paste everything manually.\nAlso for Apple apps like Safari, iTunes, etc. only the latest version that was provided for the OS version your are about to install will be available, eventhough you haven't updated it to that version at the time of the backup. \n\nA: I am afraid it may depend on if you use an external hard drive for Time Machine backup or not. \nSince most methods to downgrade macOS are related to erase the internal hard drive which contains your original macOS. So it would be great if you have backed up files with an external hard drive because you can Restore your Mac from a backup.\nAnother suggestion is that, if your Mac was installed with Lion when you bought it, you can reinstall to Lion by rebooting and holding Shift-Option-⌘-R As this support post said Reinstall the macOS that came with your Mac,without easing the disk, unless you want to to. Like it said: You probably don't need to erase, unless you're selling, trading in, or giving away your Mac, or you have an issue that requires you to erase. \n", "Q: Gofortran installation for mac I need a C compiler and gofrortran to install a package.

Its part of the GCC package from gnu. It's a nice Fortran compiler and the best part is it is free. If you've searched the web you know most Fortran compilers are pricey. The link above will let you access precompiled binaries for gfortran. The binaries are packaged as simple to install Mac .dmg files.\nThe version for Sierra is 6.3 while the latest version for Mojave is 8.2.\n\nA: Install homebrew from brew.sh and then install gcc using brew. The gcc package contains gfortran. This is a documented and verified process. Brew will also let you know if you have mangled permissions, missing path variables or are using sudo where you shouldn’t.\n", "Q: Extensive diacritics input in iOS/iPadOS MacOS has an input method known as \"ABC - Extended\", which allows inputting most diacritics with any Latin letters. With it, \"Alt\" + various keys give a diacritic waiting to be composed, and pressing a letter produces the letter with the specified diacritic. For example:\nAlt + E gives acute (´), which can be used to produce é or ń\nAlt + U gives diaeresis (¨), which can be used to produce ü or ÿ\nAlt + C gives cedilla (¸), which can be used to produce ş or ķ\nAlt + B  and Alt + V give breve (˘) and caron/háček (ˇ) respectively, which can be used to produce Romanian ă and Pinyin ǎ.\nMy question: is there a similar way to input various diacritics on iOS/iPadOS? All of the system keyboards seem just to offer a limited set of accented letters.\n.\n\nA: The best way to have full coverage of diacritics is to get a hardware keyboard to go with the iOS device.  Then you can just choose ABC Extended as your mapping.\nOtherwise you have to search for a 3rd party keyboard (check the Keyman app) or use an app like Unicode Pad.\n\nA: In iOS holding the letter down will present a choice of diacritics.\nFrom https://www.igeeksblog.com/how-to-type-diacritical-marks-on-iphone-ipad/\n\n", "Q: Messages app is popping up an emoji options when I try to copy the message I have tried a number of times to highlight a Messages App message on Macos to be able to copy it into the clipboard.

I'm struggling with Secure Input Mode, since it (quite often) gets left on, because of 1password. I've asked their support and they brushed it off them by saying that 'they didn't experience that'. \nThe most annoying part is that I can't see if Secure Input Mode is enabled or not. \nDoes anyone know of a way (or an application) that makes it visible if Secure Input Mode is enabled or not? \n\nA: I ended up going into this rabbit hole myself.\nMy gut-feeling told me that it was a possible race-condition between 1password and something else (maybe Alfred). But I couldn't prove it.\nThe problem was, that as soon as I CMD + Tab'ed, then it usually fixed the issue, so I couldn't debug it. I needed something being visible at all times, so if this annoying thing happened, that I could see straight away, what enabled SecureInput (without touching the keys).\nI ended up installing TextBar, and running two scripts every 10 seconds:\nScript 1: Process ID\n#!/bin/bash\n\nSID=`ioreg -l -w 0 | grep SecureInput`\nif [[ \"$SID\" != '' ]]; then\n    echo ' Secure Input is Active '\nelse\n    echo ' Not active '\nfi\n\nScript 2: Application name\n#!/bin/bash\n\nculprit=`ioreg -l -w 0 | grep SecureInput | sed 's/ //g'`\nif [ -z \"$culprit\" ]\nthen\n    echo ' No culprit '\nelse\n    echo ' ' >> ./secure_input_log.log\n    echo $(date) >> ./secure_input_log.log\n    echo $culprit >> ./secure_input_log.log\n    echo \" ${culprit:0:20} \"\nfi\n\nBut as I installed this setup, then problem disappeared: ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nA: I am going to be annoying and answer a different question from what you originally asked, but I hope the answer may help you anyway.

Only the desktop and its icons show, the spinning wheel shows forever, I cannot do anything (no Cmd+Option+Esc, no way to go back to the login screen and switch user) and the only way to (gently) unlock it is to ssh to the machine from my smartphone and issue kill -9 -1 (ie, kill all the processes belonging to the user I'm trying to log in.\n\n*This happens only upon the first login after shutdown or reboot. Once I've unlocked the user with the killing, subsequent logins go well until the next reboot.\n\n*This happens only if, after reboot, I do the first login with a given account (the one I usually work with and which has many customisations), it doesn't happen if I first login with another (cleaner) account and then I login with the troubled one.\n\n*I've already tried the most trivial things: remove login items, stop a few launchd services, SMC reset, check the logs, use the ssh session and top to keep an eye on started processes. But no luck, I can't find what it is.\n\n*Somewhere I was suggested to login by clicking on the right arrow next to the password field and keeping the Option key pressed. Magically, this worked, but I suppose that key combination is to disable startup things I might need later.\n\n*Restarting in recovery mode doesn't make sense here: very likely it would work, but I wouldn't gain any particular info on the guilty process and it will keep hanging until I discover it.\n\n\nSo, my question is: as an advanced user how could I troubleshoot all the things that happen after login? Quite clearly, the graphical interface is waiting for some other program to finish (or some other signal), but how is it possible to know? Is there some tool (in addition to inspecting the logs, using top, ps, pstree)? Is there some technical documentation on how the whole thing works?\nEDIT: since I'm receiving comments like \"try this and that\", note that I'm asking the highlighted question, not one of the many things I could try, many of which can already be found with Google, I already know (and tried) a number of them.\n\nA: \nMagically, this worked, but I suppose that key combination is to disable startup things I might need later.\n\nWell, if it works w/o apps startup when login, you can use bisection to find out what app causes trouble: disable all the startups then enable just a half of them, check if issue'd arise again or not, disable them again and enable those that weren't tried. If you found which half is causing troubles, repeat same procedure with its \"suspects\" — also splitting it in halves. That could allow you to narrow it down to a single app that being run on startup botches the login.\n\nA: Upon your first login the system connects to various Apple servers (push, icloud, etc). If your network connection is slow or your DNS is slow or there is a failing/non-reachable DNS server, it will cause slow logins. Troubleshoot it by disabling network connections and rebooting. If it starts fast, you know where the issue is. Next you can try to use one of public DNS servers (like 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8) to see if they are any faster then yours.\n\nA: I've been having a similar issue with an account off and on for a while; I would at least get to the desktop in my case, but every app would immediately hang, and this would only happen sometimes (not consistently), and only for one particular user.\nTo be honest trying to debug it never got me anywhere, and the time I spent doing it would have been better spent just fixing it, which I eventually did.\nWith that in mind my recommendation is to just create a new user account and move everything over to that. Focus on moving data files, rather than settings, i.e- you probably don't want to transfer much from ~/Library/ except for a few key items, in my case I just restored ~/Library/Mail/ and ~/Library/Safari/, everything else I just recreated and configured back the way I like. It was a huge pain in the ass, but the time it took was about what I had already wasted trying to fix the old account, so I could have halved the time I was stuck for by just creating a new, fresh user account in the first place.\nAlso, my experience has always tended to be that you should do a clean install of your system periodically (maybe every three or four years), usually when you're ready to upgrade to a new OS version. Focusing on restoring data and only minimal content from your ~/Library/ folder(s) from backups, this way you leave behind any cruft that may have accumulated which may have lead to problems.\nThese aren't pretty or simple fixes, but sometimes you just need to get things back to normal.\n", "Q: How does zsh find commands? Unless I switch back to bash, I now have to spell out the full path for scripts I have written.  How does zsh find commands?\nThings in /bin, /use/bin, etc. still work, but things in ~/bin are “not found” even when that path is at the beginning of both $PATH and $path.\nAfter putting\nPATH=\"~/bin:$PATH\npath=\"$PATH\"\n\nin ~/.zshrc, \necho $PATH; echo $path\n\nshows it at the beginning of the path, but it still doesn't find the commands.  (And it's not permissions: the scripts work when I type their full paths.)\n\nA: zsh doesn't expand ~ within quotes. You need to use\nPATH=~/bin:$PATH\n\ninstead.\nPS: And path=$PATH is not required, zsh does this automatically\n\nA: You do not list how exactly you checked that the path is actually at the beginning of $PATH - but generally you should be aware that macOS Catalina changed the default shell from bash to zsh - and as such you'll need to move over any modifications you've made to PATH in .bashrc (for example) to the corresponding file for zsh (for example .zshrc, .zshenv or .zprofile).\nThe \"standard\" way of adding paths to macOS is to create a file at /etc/paths.d/ containing the path to the directory you want to add to the path. Then when you launch any shell, it should automatically be added to your PATH environment variable. For example create a file called:\n/etc/paths.d/wgroleau\n\nAnd make it contain just the following line of text:\n/Users/wgroleau/bin\n\nThis would system wide change default paths to include that directory.\nUPDATE: Following your comments I'm starting to think that your problem might not be PATH-related at all. You state that the problems you experience revolve around scripts that you have written yourself. If those scripts happens to be bash-scripts that start of with a shebang for bash, then those scripts needs to be converted to zsh to work if you haven’t got bash installed - or alternatively you could install bash again from HomeBrew or from Apple.\n", "Q: Proof (data access) of a confirmation pop-up online On Safari 11.0.3, I placed bids on an auction website a few days ago and after making each bid, I saw a confirmation pop-up that told me \"Thank you for the offer\". I thus have concluded the organization selling the items received my bids. \nHowever, I have learnt today that my bids were never received. Is there a way to prove that my bid was sent or that I indeed received a confirmation?\nIs the information exchange (the form I filled online in a pop-up window and the confirmation I have received) stored somewhere in macOS?\n\nA: Safari on macOS has caching functionality that could potentially save copies of web sites on your hard drive - however, pages with dynamic content such as a order notifications, bidding confirmations, form content, etc. are generally not saved at all. I.e. the web sites forbids the browser from saving them to cache.\nTherefore I doubt there's any chance to restore those pages for documentation. You would have needed to take screenshots, save PDFs or similar at the time the information was available to you.\n", "Q: Can I use any USB charger with my iPhone? I'm not sure its the right place to ask but, I just wondered whether I can charge my iPhone Xr with my Samsung adapter. I understand it works and no harm is done to the iphone.\nI know that the iPhone transmitting info about voltage and current between the phone and adapter so that the current and voltage wont exceed iPhone limits?\n\nA: If I am understanding you correctly...\nA power adapter with a USB port on it will charge anything that that can be charged via USB. So, probably...\nThat said it is important to note that some USB chargers don't provide enough wattage to charge a device or charge it quickly enough. Also if the usb charger has just a mini/micro USB cable on it then no, as iPhones have *Lightning\" connectors not USB connectors.\nThere is also the issue with cheap, knock-off chargers that are constructed poorly and will damage anything that are plugged into them.\nThat said a USB charger that is designed to charge a Samsung phone should work as long as it has a standard USB port on it that you can plug a lightning cable into.\n\nA: USB Charging is a universal standard.\nThe quality of your cable is more important than the charging brick when it comes to whether your phone will be fine when charging.\nAs long as you have a MFI certified lightning cable you should be fine. The samsung charger should actually charge you faster than the 5w charger that comes with the XR.\nAlso FYI in your original question you asked about java for transferring information.

These cannot be shared.\nYou must use the dedicated \"Shared Albums\" feature of iCloud Photos. This is different than the \"Albums\" feature, which you cannot share.\nShared Albums are not available via the web interface.\n\nA: There is no way to create a shared photo album from iCloud.com.  \nThe only way, as of this writing, to create as shared photo album is from the Photos app on an iOS device or the Photos application on a macOS device.\n", "Q: How can I get back to my Mac side?

But when using a home device (with an amplifier connected by jack to the MBP) or a headphone (bluetooth or jack) I prefer to disconnect Boom.\nSo far I have made an automator script that connect/disconnect bluetooth and quit/launch Boom.\nIs there a way to upgrade my current script to be triggered with plugging/unplugging of jack or connecting/disconnecting with bluetooth device (not only when activating/disactivating bluetooth)? \nNote : I'm aware of Breakaway that Automatically disable speakers when headphones are removed (but only by manually connect/disconnect the jack), but something that quit/launch a specific app will suit me better. \nFor the curious, here my current script using Blueutil :\nset BT to do shell script \"/usr/local/bin/blueutil -p\"\n\nif BT is equal to \"0\" then\n    do shell script \"/usr/local/bin/blueutil -p 1\"\n    tell application \"Boom 2\" to quit\nelse\n    do shell script \"/usr/local/bin/blueutil -p 0\"\n    tell application \"Boom 2\" to activate\nend if\n\n\nA: Well, many thanks to CJK for the explanations! \nAfter some struggle with Keyboard Maestro (because of how Boom is made, a Boom2device appears in the sound output devices and never really changes, so the trigger from Keyboard Maestro doesn't work...)

This problem has been around for months, it was not fixed by a restart or an uninstall / reinstall of Notion.\nToday, this same identical problem spread to the Sublime app. Any ideas on how to proceed, troubleshoot, or resolve would be greatly appreciated. This is on Mojave 10.14.6 on a macbook pro.\n\n\nA: [This answer not final until this sentence removed]\nAs I'm sure you know, troubleshooting is a process of elimination and often requires patience.\nI would start with testing your MBP in Safe Mode to see how it behaves both during Safe Mode and afterwards.\nBoot into Safe Mode\nFollow these steps to boot your MBP into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBP\n\n*Restart your MBP\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. use your MBP long enough to establish if the problem reappears.)\n\n*Exit Safe Mode by restarting your MBP as normal\n\n*Test again to see if the problem reappears\n\n\nLet me know how you went and we'll go from there.\n\nA: I had a similar bug happen to me. A fix I found was to make the window fullscreen and then not fullscreen. Being that you likely can't see the fullscreen button, another option if you already know the window is maximized (not fullscreen), it to put open another window of the same size, layer the invisible window on top of it, and then move the mouse over to the green fullscreen button of the new window. Because they are the same size, pressing should trigger the fullscreen of the invisible window. Then it's just a matter of un-fullscreening it.\nIf you don't know the window size, you can always open mission control and drag the invisible window to somewhere there isn't an existing Space, and that will also fullscreen it.\n\nA: I had the same issue just now. I found that selecting the app does show the Notion toolbar right at the top of the screen though (where the Apple icon is), and using the Window menu there I could dock it to one side of the display/full screen it.\nWhen I un-full-screened it with the arrow button it'd shrink down to a nigh-invisible tiny border on the bottom LHS, but having found where it was hiding I could now drag the window back onto the screen.\n", "Q: How to completely remove a service from launchd added by mistake? By mistake I added an invalid (non-existing) service to launchd:\nsudo launchctl enable system/homebew.mxcl.cntlm\n\nThe above should be system/homebrew.mxcl.cntlm instead.\nHowever, after removing the service:\nsudo launchctl remove system/homebew.mxcl.cntlm\n\nit still shows in the list of disabled services:\nnlykkei-mbp:~ nlykkei$ launchctl print-disabled system\ndisabled services = {\n    \"org.apache.http\" => false\n    \"homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq\" => false\n    \"com.apple.CSCSupportd\" => true\n    \"com.apple.ftpd\" => true\n    \"com.apple.mdmclient.daemon.runatboot\" => true\n    \"com.openssh.sshd\" => false\n    \"org.apache.httpd\" => true\n    \"com.apple.bootpd\" => true\n    \"homebrew.mxcl.cntlm\" => false\n    \"org.macosforge.xquartz.privileged_startx\" => false\n    \"com.launchd.maxfiles\" => false\n    \"com.apple.ftp-proxy\" => true\n    \"homebew.mxcl.cntlm\" => false     <-- doesn't exist\n}\n\nHow can I remove all traces of homebew.mxcl.cntlm from my system, so that it doesn't show up using launchctl?\n\nA: Immediately after removing the service you won't be able to find the service name in a distinctive and editable file. It's probably hidden in some cache.\nAfter a reboot you should be able to remove its traces by performing these steps though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Search for the name of the non-existent service to remove in the files of this directory: /var/db/com.apple.xpc.launchd\nsudo grep -rnw '/var/db/com.apple.xpc.launchd/' -e \"homebew\"\n\n\n*Edit the file found by grep with nano (the string is probably found in disabled.plist)\nsudo nano /var/db/com.apple.xpc.launchd/disabled.plist\n\nMove the cursor to the two incriminating lines (service name e.g. <key>homebew.mxcl.cntlm</key> followed by its status e.g. <false/>) and remove each with ctrlK. Hit ctrlO, ⏎ and ctrlX, ⏎ to save the changes to disk and leave nano.\n\n*Reboot again and launchctl print-disabled system won't show the service anymore.\n\n\n\nDue to an agressive caching mechanism or other opaque system procedures, removing the lines doesn't work reliably with vim or nano (on the OP's system it didn't work at all, in my Catalina VM 5 out of 6 attempts have been successful).\nThen the file has to be cleaned in Recovery Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Recovery Mode\n\n*In the menubar open Terminal\n\n*Edit the file with nano. The paths depend on your main volume name (e.g. Macintosh HD):\n/Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/usr/bin/nano /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD//var/db/com.apple.xpc.launchd/disabled.plist\n\n\n*Enter reboot to boot normally.\n\n", "Q: Add shared Google Calendar to iCloud Calendar Somebody shared a public Google Calendar with me.

Running an iMac Pro 10 core, 64GB Ram and 16GB Vega, MacOS 10.14.6. iStat menu (v6.40) is showing a consistent GPU Memory usage between 90% and 100% after I have been using the computer for awhile. \nI close out of all programs and the memory does not seem to be released. The only thing that does it is to restart the system. \n1) Why is the system not releasing the GPU memory?\nand\n2) Can I do a manual release to free it up somehow?\n\nA: There has often been problems with AMD based GPUs and their reporting of video memory usage in iStat Menu. This has in the past been for example always reporting 100% usage, always reporting a climbing usage, etc.\nIf you haven't got any performance degradation, and your computer usage really isn't affected by this - I would just ignore the readout. \nThere's no tool to do a manual release - it doesn't really make sense. If the VRAM is actually in use, \"manually releasing\" it would make programs crash or behave unpredictable - nobody wants that.\nIf you really want you could probably lower the VRAM usage by logging out, or by killing WindowServer in its entirety. There's just no real reason to do so - unless you're experiencing a performance degradation, and then it would be better to analyze that specifically.\n\nA: I have found the answer to actually be 'yes' you can release (flush) the VRAM. Here's what worked for me:\nI have a hot corner (MacOS) set to turn the display off, and when I activate it, even just for a few moments, my GPU usage goes down to near zero once it comes back on -> not surprising since it’s off, BUT it continues to stay low as I go back to browsing around Chrome that stayed open, and other programs.\nAnd keep in mind I’m pushing the VRAM with about 100 tabs open in Chrome that have many videos ready to play in the tabs.\nSo it seems the VRAM is released or flushed as the display is off but still remains low when using programs again. It’s almost as if it simply keeps things buffered as long as it thinks it needs it, which makes sense.\nI often use large comps with big textures in Adobe After Effects, and that eats up all 16GB of VRAM no problem, so I know it’s there to be used, but the problem comes when I need AFX to use the GPU but it’s locked up in other apps where I can’t easily distinguish which one is using it.\n\nA: Changing Display settings seems to reset the GPU memory in iStat. The computer starts to show mouse and keyboard delays for about 10 seconds folled by a kernel panic. Checking activity monitor for this process:\nwindowserver > _windowserver will show high GPU time.\nIm still looking for a long term solution. It may be that I am scaling the image in display settings to look like 1920x1080 when I have a 4k monitor.\nChanging the Scaling to a different resolution resets the memory in istat monitor.\nRunning: iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, 2019) Mac OS BigSur, RadeonVII, z390 Designare, 64GB 2666 MHz Ram | iStat Menu 6.51\n\nA: Adjusting the display settings seems to work.\n", "Q: com.apple.xyz.plist - replace value - not set key - possbile?

This has happened to me a few times since upgrading to macOS Catalina (10.15.1) and the root cause is unclear.\nI am downloading something using Firefox, in push Firefox away to do something else, I go to use Safari — or a text editor — and then… Like magic… The screen goes dark… Not sleep… Just dark… And I can’t see the desktop or anything.\nI know the underlying system is still up and running because if I SSH into it from another device/system I can see the OS is still alive and not hung. And in the case of the download, I can still see data being downloaded using the command line tool nload (which I installed via Homebrew). And past that the brightness controls on the keyboard still work… But obviously the screen is dark — and not turned off because of sleep mode — and I can’t see anything.\nNow, under most circumstances, I would just say a few “choice” words, hold down the power button and wait for the machine to come back up via reboot. But this download is in progress so I don’t want to do that.\nSo what can I do to get the screen on my MacBook Air active and viewable again?\n\nA: The solution is to login from another device via the command line, put the display to sleep and then wake up the machine.\nThis solution hinges on whether or not you have SSH remote login capability to the machine. But if you do, you are in luck!\nWhat I did is SSH in from iPhone using a Terminal app and then run this command to put the display to sleep:\npmset displaysleepnow\n\nWhen I entered that command, the display on the MacBook Air went truly dark. Then by simply tapping any key on the keyboard, the screen came back to life.

I'm new to this site, so pardon me if I do or say something wrong.\nI have an old MacBook late 2008 unibody that has Linux installed on it (3 different linuxes, don't ask why). I bought this MacBook second hand a while ago. I wanted to install Linux on my Mac but didn't know what I was doing back then, and accidentally deleted the whole MacOS and everything. Currently, I'm tripple booting my \"Linuxes\" via \"rEFInd\". I want to install the latest MacOS available for my model but I don't know how to do it. Where would I find a DMG and how would I install it. Could anyone guide me or help me? I don't have any warranty nor do I have an Apple store where I live.\nThanks,\n\nA: You can obtain the latest Build of El Capitan (10.11.x) directly from Apple via this link.\n\nAs for creating a bootable USB installer, I would recommend converting the dmg to an iso via AcetoneISO.\nIt'll convert the DMG to an ISO for you. After that, create the bootable USB  with your new yourmacos.iso using DD.\ndd if=/path/to/yourmacos.iso of=/dev/sdX && sync\n\nI don't know if you are familiar with this but dd does byte by byte copying and \nsync ensures that all data has been written to your USB (so you can savely unplug/eject it afterwards).\n\nA: The latest version of macOS (OS X) for your Mac is El Capitan (10.11.x). Tetsujin 's answer covers how to get El Captan. However, you will probably first need to get Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6.8) installed. I can no longer find a link where you can purchase a Snow Leopard DVD from Apple. The Snow Leopard license agreement states you can purchase a used copy of the DVD, but you can not legally download an ISO to burn to a DVD. However, once Snow Leopard is installed you probably are going to upgrade to El Capitan. This upgrade can be downloaded and installed at no cost. Apple assumes, if upgrading from Snow Leopard, that Snow Leopard was legally obtained.\nSo, if you still want to download a Snow Leopard ISO, there is a link to one possible way to do so. After installing Snow Leopard, you will need to download and install the Mac OS X 10.6.8 Update Combo v1.1 before installing El Capitan. (Actually, I would download the update to a flash drive before installing Snow Leopard.)\n", "Q: How do I restore the \"Quick Start\" migration from my iPhone X to a newly bought iPhone 11 Pro Max?

I work in a firm that is an all Mac environment and we are constantly snapping a pic on our iphone and then airdropping to my Mac desktop or ipad to send/upload to something. \nI found a tutorial online using the Automator application that came out in the last OS update. (I kind of forgot about this feature, and was initially excited about it when they made the announcement.)\nHere is a link to the tutorial. \nhttps://www.howtogeek.com/398927/how-to-convert-heic-images-to-jpg-on-a-mac-the-easy-way/\nI did not use to function to \"copy finder item\" as I did not want to keep a copy, but this is awesome. Now when I Airdrop a photo in the finder I have a widget shortcut that will convert this image in the finder and replace the HEIC version with a JPG. Hope this helps some of you, as it has been awesome for me!\nHere is a screenshot of the end result for the shortcut:\n\nThere is a lot of really cool things you can do with the Automator tool so check it out! \n\nA: There's only one way to do this without first converting the photo or using a Shortcut.  Your question assumes you're trying to Airdrop from an iOS device to a PC or Mac and not from a Mac to another device.\nFirst, you need to change how the Camera app stores pictures.  Go to Settings -> Camera -> Formats.  Under \"Camera Capture\" make sure \"Most Compatible\" is selected.  \n\nNext, go to Settings -> Photos and scroll down to \"Transfer to Mac or PC\".  Change the setting to \"Keep Originals\".\n\nAfter you do both of these, take another picture and then try to Airdrop it to your Mac.  The Mac should receive the jpg version of the picture.  I'm not sure if this will work with pictures taken prior to changing the Camera settings.\n\nA: If you’d like to shoot and store HEIF images with iPhone camera and have them automatically convert to JPEG only upon copying to a computer, here are the settings to enable:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the “Settings” app on the iPhone and go to “Camera”\n\n*Choose “Formats” and select “High Efficiency” to capture iPhone photos in HEIF / HEVC format\n\n*Recommended, next to go “Photos” and under the ‘Transfer to Mac or PC’ section choose “Automatic” to automatically convert the HEIF images to JPEG upon file transfer\n\n\nIf you’re going to leave HEIF format enabled on iPhone camera, then being sure the automatic image conversion setting is enabled is a good idea, because it will automatically convert the HEIF format images into JPEG format if the pictures are being copied from the iPhone to a Mac or transferred from an iPhone to a Windows PC.\n\nA: I like using HEIC for file storage, so I just set up a simple iOS shortcut that allows me to airdrop JPG’s.  You can add the shortcut to the share sheet, so it’s only a small scroll from the standard Airdrop icon.\n\n", "Q: I have been facing a strange problem with my MACBOOK Pro SSD When booting my Macbook Pro, a question mark inside of a folder is displayed.\nI try to go to recovery mode (which happens to be online) and I don't see my Machintosh HD in disk utility. \nAfter certain force restarting and shutdown, my mac boots up properly. \nPS: If I do an heavy task and then shutdown, this problem reoccurs. \n\nA: This definitely sounds like a hardware problem.\nYou'll want to take the MacBook Pro back to the place you bought it, or contact Apple, to arrange for repairs. \nRemember to check your original invoice to see if it might still be under warranty.\n", "Q: spotlight finds \"anaconda-navigator\" but `conda` has been uninstalled CLARIFICATION. \nI am not trying to use conda, much less reinstall it.

I know that I could just get a 2.5 inch drive in the optical drive bay, but I would rather keep the optical drive.\nIs there a way to use a nvme ssd in a mid 2012 macbook pro model? I know an adapter is needed, so what adapter works? Also, I've heard that certain brands of nvme ssds work, so some confirmation on that would be helpful.\nI dont know if OS version matters, but it is is el captian version :10.11.3.\n\nA: There are M.2 PCIe to SATA adaptors that you could use, but there are two problems: Firstly, you're not going to see the faster speed of the NVM RAM, because the SATA interface is the bottleneck, and won't go any faster than 6 Gbps.\nSecondly, ensuring that the adaptor card and the new SSD module will all fit together inside your laptop: neither being too big, nor rattling around loose.\nThe simplest thing is to replace the existing mechanical hard drive with a 2.5\" SATA SSD. This will slot in exactly in place of your old drive, and will cost less than an NVM RAM module.\n(Links to UK stores.)\n", "Q: Notifications causing screen waking I recently got a new MacBook Pro (2019 model). With this computer, if the displays are sleeping (I often have an external monitor attached via USB-C dock), they will wake up for a few seconds when a notification comes in, and then they go back into power-saving mode.

Looking for a quick and dirty way to automate this mundane activity. I presume this could be done with an automation to press the mouse button from two separate pixel coordinates, with delay, so long as the browser window doesn't move -- unless there's a better way.\nI tried building a Watch Me Do workflow, in Automator, but can't seem to get it to work.  I get the error \"application Chrome is not running when it is expected to.\" It also never lists mouse clicks for some reason.\nI do have accessibility set up, in system preferences > security & privacy > privacy > accessibility.  Automator, Chrome and System Events are all checked within there (among other stuff of course).\nI tried the markashworth workaround as detailed here -- which also doesn't seem to work. Using his method, I get this error:\n\nUPDATE: I just downloaded \"cliclick\" and figured out how do both clicks as a terminal command, with the proper delays.  BUT -- I don't know code and need a way for this terminal command to repeat \"x\" amount of times.  Anyone know how I could do that in Script Editor?  The command line is:\ncliclick c:132,286 w:100 c:132,286 w:5000 c:1100,238\n\nI would need a few seconds of delay before the loop repeats, which I presume I could do with a final \"w:\" in that line.  Thanks for the help!!\n\nA: The following steps are a solution for automating the repeat clicking of a mouse, back and forth, at two different fixed positions within a web page -- i.e. clicking two buttons or links within in a web-page, with a user-defined delay between each click.\nAll this is, is a slight modification of what was described over in this thread -- this one being for two website \"buttons\" rather than one. \nIMPORTANT -- this automation does NOT work in the background.  In other words, you can't be doing something else on your computer at the same time this automation is running.  In addition, your browser can't move its physical position on your screen after the automation begins, because you're literally telling the computer to press two buttons at fixed X,Y pixel coordinates.  The \"buttons\" on the web-page, therefore need to stay at the same spots on your screen for this to work.\nSteps as follow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the Apple icon (upper left), select \"System Preferences.\"  Type \"security\" in the upper-right search window.  This should highlight Security & Privacy.  Open that.\n\n*Click lock icon, enter your password, click Unlock.\n\n*Click Accessibility from the scrollable list (blue icon).  Now click the plus sign below the box on the right.  Then navigate to Applications and scroll down to Utilities.  From within there, put check marks on Terminal AND Script Editor. Then finally select whichever web browser you use under the Applications list.  You can then close out of this window.\n\n*Launch Terminal.  (I do this by typing \"Terminal\" as a Spotlight search (the magnifying glass icon, upper right of screen)).  \n\n*Remember (generally speaking) what that bottom-most line appears like when Terminal opens up.  You'll want Terminal to revert back to whatever that is after each of two short downloads occur within terminal -- both are idiot-proof. `\n\n*First Download -- Home Brew.  As strange as this sounds, all you do to download this \"program\" is copy the single line of text you see below \"Install Home Brew\" on its website.  Paste that text into Terminal, hit Enter and wait for the process to complete.  When the bottom line in Terminal appears as it was when you first launched it, you're done.\n\n*Second Download -- CliClick (second download).  Simply type these three words in Terminal, then hit by Enter: brew install cliclick \n(note: CliClick took about 90 seconds to install as I recall)\n\n*When the download is complete, you can minimize Terminal -- as you're done with it now.  Close it entirely if you're certain cliclick has been downloaded. \n\n*Next, simply determine the X,Y pixel coordinates for both website \"buttons\" you want the robot to click on.  Before doing this, I recommend placing the browser window on your screen in such a way that its upper-left corner abuts the upper-left corner of your display. To determine the coordinates, simply press COMMAND+SHIFT+4 and jot down both sets of numbers atop each \"button\" you over over.  The top digits are X coordinates and the bottom are therefore Y.  You'll end up with two pairs of numbers for each button, obviously.  Write these down somewhere, then press Escape to turn off the crosshairs.\n\n*Launch Script Editor.  Like Terminal, I did this by typing \"script editor\" as a Spotlight search\n\n*Now, copy and paste ALL of the following text into Script Editor.  It must show up there exactly ias it does below, including indents etc:\n\n\ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    activate\n    repeat 208 times\n        do shell script \"/usr/local/bin/cliclick c:\" & \"132,286\"\n        delay 3.5\n        do shell script \"/usr/local/bin/cliclick c:\" & \"1100,230\"\n        delay 4.5\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nNow you're pretty much home free! All you do is replace the first set of comma-separated digits with the coordinates you of your first website button in X,Y format.  Leave the quote marks as they are.  Repeat this for your second button and change the delays as you wish, which are in seconds.  \nFinally, set repeat value to the amount of loops you want to run and save the script.  Voila!  Pressing \"play\" in Script Editor will roll the press.  You can stop it by simply stealing your pointer back and clicking on the \"stop\" button, which I did multiple times to change the delays based on internet speed and server speed.\n\nA: There is a much easier way to do this on the Mac: Keyboard Maestro.\nDespite the name, it automates the mouse as well as the keyboard.\nIt let you use GUI tools to setup the clicks (all you have to go is tell it to watch where you click, then click, and it will do the calculation for you).\nIt will let you set a specific delay between the clicks.\nIt also has built-in tools for clicking links in Safari and Chrome, which may also help.\nIt will also let you use AppleScript or JavaScript (or anything else) as part of the macro.\nAll of the actions are drag-and-drop.\nThere is a very active forum where lots of helpful users hang out (and also the developer of the program).\nThere are about 1,000 other things you can do with Keyboard Maestro too. Once you start using it, you'll realize all the ways it can help.\n(To be clear, I have absolutely no connection to the app except being an extremely grateful user for a number of years. I pay for my own upgrades as soon as a new version comes out because it's the most useful utility on the Mac.)\n\nA: So glad you figured out your script!\nJust wanted to include that you also may be able to use Selenium to do this for you. \nhttps://www.seleniumhq.org/\nSelenium is used by Quality Assurance professionals to automate the testing of websites, and is made to do everything a user would do and more.

In the past when we wanted to offload the /Users folder from the internal disk we simply created a symbolic link for /Users that pointed to /Volumes/External_Drive_Name/Users. The Mac in question is a server for two computer labs, hosting 60 Macs with a few terabytes of data spread out across 200~ user accounts. Hosting the Users folder on the internal drive is simply not a good option for us.\nSymbolic links are no longer supported (for the root directory folders) in Catalina / 10.15, so this no longer works using the tried and true method. During the upgrade the symbolic link was simply removed and replaced with the standard Users folder.\nI've read up on firm links by way of creating a synthetic.conf file via man synthetic.conf, but this method isn't working for the Users folder. I AM able to build a synthetic.conf file that creates a link for foo in the root directory that points to another volume, but attempting to redirect Users in the same manner breaks nearly all functionality.\nI'm using the following syntax and placing synthetic.conf in /etc/synthetic.conf:\n\nUsers  (tab character)  /Volumes/External_Drive_Name/Users\n\nWith that I'm able to fully boot (albeit slowly) and log in but Finder and Spotlight repeatedly crash, signaling to me that the system is unable to find/create a user folder for the current logged in user.\nHas anyone found a way to do this yet?\nAnyone know of any other tricks for redirecting MacOS to look for the Users folder on a different volume?\n\nA: You can also use dscl to move current users user folder by specifying the NFSHomeDirectory entry.  \nAs explained in this Apple support doc Hide a user account in macOS you could use this command to move the home directory of \"yourUser\" :\nsudo mv /Users/yourUser /new/path/yourUser\nIf the new location is on a separate volume and you want to copy the existing user data it will be necessary to use cp to copy the existing home folder rather than mv to move it.\nsudo cp -pR /Users/yourUser /Volumes/new/path\nIt is necessary to grant full disk access to terminal.app before doing so to avoid \"Operation not permitted\" errors.  \nIf the current user folder contains no required data then this step is not required as a new folder hierarchy will be automatically created at the new location when the user next logs on after updating NFSHomeDirectory.\nNext use this command to update the user record of \"yourUser\" with the new home directory path :\nsudo dscl . create /Users/yourUser NFSHomeDirectory /new/path/yourUser\nFor new users you could create the user via terminal as described in this question How can I create a new user through terminal macOS 10.14 and specify the NFSHomeDirectory entry you want at creation time.\n\nA: When working with mobile accounts on macOS Catalina, you can use the createmobileaccount tool to specify a different home folder location for accounts created using this tool. \nFor example: If you have an AD account named jsmith and you want the jsmith account to have its home folder stored in a directory called Users on a local drive named Homes, you could run the following command to create the jsmith mobile account with the jsmith account's home folder stored at /Volumes/Homes/Users/jsmith:\nsudo /System/Library/CoreServices/ManagedClient.app/Contents/Resources/createmobileaccount -n jsmith -h /Volumes/Homes/Users\nFor more information, please see the createmobileaccount help.

I tried it with the Catalina recovery, and kept getting \"Operation not permitted\" errors. Seems like when they released Catalina, Apple might have baked in some hard-coded rules in the kernel against deleting the builtin Users folder.\nYou need to obtain the \"Install macOS Mojave.app\" from the App Store if you don't already have it, and run the \"createinstallmedia\" utility inside it with the necessary parameters to create a Mojave recovery USB stick...\nAnyways, you can try booting from the Mojave recovery media, opening Terminal, and typing \"ln -s -F /Volumes/giant_disk/Users /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Users\".

I have a Totu USB C Hub, TOTU 12-in-1 Type C Hub with dual HDMI inputs. It's supposed to allow me to use two external monitors with my MBP in clamshell mode but after exhausting SO and YouTube, I've found no good workaround. My machine only has two USB-C inputs (Thunderbolt 3). Anyone out here doing this?\nThe other posts similar to this were quite old and I'm looking for a solution specifically for newer MBP's with the two USB-C ports. Thanks,\n\nA: Your problem is that you have chosen a USB-C hub - this means that MST is a requirement for supporting dual displays in a non-mirrored configuration. MST is not supported on macOS, but will work if you run Windows.\nIn order to get dual displays working, you'll need to either: (a) connect each monitor seperately to the two Thunderbolt ports on the Mac - directly or through your hub, or (b) get a Thunderbolt 3 hub/dock with dual display capability.\nSuch a Thunderbolt 3 dock could be for example the OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock. With that dock you would need to connect your two monitors to the dock like this:\nMonitor A: Connected to mini-DisplayPort port\n  Monitor B: Connected to daisy-chain Thunderbolt 3 port\nNote that you'll need cables that match the inputs your monitors support.

I have recently got rid of my Apple Music subscription (and moved to Spotify), as part of my sub I used to use iCloud Music Library. Now with Apple Music gone I want to just sync my library the old way using iTunes however I am shown this screen:\n\nThere is no option in Settings > Music to turn off my iCloud Music library on my phone. How can I resolve this?\n\nA: On your phone, navigate to Settings > Music.  There you will see \"Show Apple Music\" and \"Sync Library\".  Make sure both of those are off.  I believe that you will not see iCloud Music Library any longer.\n\nA: The solution was solved by Apple Support.

I find this app 'Cycle Tracking' on my apple watch:\n\nI don't recall installing this app at all.\nBut I don't need this app.\nI looked into the 'Installed App' in my Watch app on my iPhone, but I can find it there.\n\nSo how can I remove this App from my Apple watch?\n\nA: Removing some built-in Apple Watch apps, like Cycle Tracking, must be done from the Watch itself.  You can't do this from the iPhone's Watch app.\n\n\n*\n\n*On the Watch, open the App Grid by pressing the Digital Crown (if you're in the List view, press firmly to change to the Grid view first).\n\n*Lightly tap and hold on any app to start the familiar 'wiggle' mode.  If you press too firmly you'll trigger the List/Grid view.  \n\n*Icons with an 'X' on the top can be deleted.  After tapping the 'X' you'll be asked to verify you want to delete the app.  Select 'Delete'.\n\n*Release the pressure and tap on this button to delete the app.\n\n\n\nFrom the List view you also slide the app name to the left and select the red delete (trash can) button.\nApps like Mail, Maps, Music, and Photos are still permanently installed and you can't delete them.\n", "Q: Upgrade iPhone to current iOS minor release versus going to the new major release version? When updating my iPhone from settings the only option is iOS 13.X, however I am currently on 12.4.1 and want to simply go to the still current patch version 12.4.3 which came out just a few days ago.\nIs there a way to make the phone go to the minor build update instead of forcing to 13.X? I want to avoid iOS 13 until a couple of fixes come out that address the major issues plaguing that update, but don't want to have current security holes in my current version.\nThere was a similar question here: Upgrade iPad to newer (but not latest) iOS but it had to do with a middle jump to an already revoked older version i.e going from 6 to 7, when 8 was the current version, so my question is different in that both versions are currently signed by apple. \n\nA: Good question. My guess is that you can do it if:\n\n\n*\n\n*you use iTunes \n\n*Apple is signing an '.ipsw' file for your iPhone model.\nIf I was trying to do this, I would look at https://ipsw.me/product/iPhone.\nThey seem to have a good / easy system for figuring out what is available for which iPhone.\nUpdate:\nIf you have a 6s, it does not look like that model is supported. At least that is what I gather from looking at https://ipsw.me/12.4.3.\nUpdate 2:\nhttps://iosindex.com/iphone also reminded me that there are at least two versions of the iPhone 6s, the \"GSM\" version and the \"everyone else\" version. Their pages for each are linked below:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 6s (GSM)\n\n*iPhone 6s (Global)\n", "Q: Why is my iOS Reminders app slow and unstable when invoked by Siri? I am a longtime user of the iOs \"Reminders\" app. And I most commonly create new reminders through Siri, for example by saying \"Remind me to pay the rent at 6pm.\" \nThese Siri requests started taking a slow, long time to actually create the reminder. \n\n\n*\n\n*I would make the Siri request, and then Siri would say things like \"I'm on it,\" \"Wait a moment,\" etc.  \n\n*A very long delay would pass. It would take up to 15 seconds before it would act.\n\n*Then, it would actually even fail about 15 percent of the time, saying \"Sorry, there was a problem with the app.\" \n\n*A side issue that is truly a bug but not the point of this post is that, after the Reminders app was approved in iOS13, my default reminder list appeared totally blank when viewed in the web-based iCloud reminders app. (It was OK (after an initial delay of several days) in actual mobile devices and in the macOS app.) \n\n\nWhat caused this slowness problem, and how to fix?\n\nA: The fix to this problem is due to the fact that the reminders list that it was attempting to add to (... which is the one that was configured in iOS as the \"Default reminders list\") was a very old and very full list.   It was not super full of un-completed reminders, but the number of past COMPLETED reminders was over 8,000.\nSo, to fix the slowness, I simply created a new reminders list in my iPhone. Then I configured this new reminders list to be the \"Default reminders list.\" \nAfter that point in time, Siri commands to create new reminders work smoothly and quickly.  (AND, related to that final bullet, this new reminders list was fully visible, not empty, in the iCloud web app.)\n\nA: Following @jon worek’s answer, deleting old completed reminders is easy on iPhone as well.\nOn iPhone with iOS 15\n\n*\n\n*Go to the list of all reminders: All\n\n*Tap the three dots menu at the upper right and Show completed reminders\n\n*Next to the count of completed reminders is the option to 'clear' them. Tap Clear and it will give the option to clear all of them or reminders older than a month and so on.\n\n\nA: The accepted answer of creating a brand new list is a great suggestion.\nI was also able to get the same effect by deleting all of the old, completed reminders from my list (I had about 4k+).\nI did this on my Mac, which was simplified by being able to multi-select and delete a bunch of reminders at a time. It probably wouldn't work as well on an iOS device though :)\n", "Q: Can the AirPods info be shown on the iPhone bottom more reliably?

The only way I can get it to display again is to press that reset button on the AirPods case for 5 seconds or so and place it near the bottom of the iPhone again and press \"Connect\".  Is there a way to show the info without resetting the AirPods?\n\nA: Open your case lid with your AirPods inside and hold your case close to your device.

Option with disabling brightness doesn't fit my requirements because I don't want every time to search my cursor in the black screen. I need the lid to be opened because I'm ofently using touch id sensor.\n\nA: Yes, it's possible.\nWell, I can do it.

This will rename the user folder by adding '(Deleted)' at the end of the folder. Click 'Delete User'. \n\n*Log out of the computer.\n\n*At login screen, select Other and log into computer with AD account and if prompted, select the option for 'Create Mobile Account'. Skip any configuration prompts upon login.\n\n*Log Out of AD account and log back in as root.\n\n*Navigate to Users folder/new AD user folder and delete new AD user folder. Restart computer, log back in as root, and empty trash.\n\n*Rename the old user folder. Go to the user folder and delete the '(Deleted)' and any spaces from the folder name. The name of the user folder needs to match the AD username.\n\n*Select the User folder and choose Get info.\n\n*Unlock Permissions\n\n*Click + and add Network User and type in and select the correct AD user and click ok.\n\n*Set the user with Read, Write permissions. Select user, click gear and choose 'Make user owner'\n\n*Click + and add Network Groups and add 'Domain Users'\n\n*Set 'Domain Users' group permissions to be Read Only.\n\n*Delete 'Staff' group\n\n*Under the 'Name' column in the 'Sharing Permissions:' section, you will see an owner account listed and under the 'Name' column, it may read 'Fetching'. Select it and delete this entry.\nGo to gear and select 'Apply to Enclosed Items'\n\n\nStep 2: Steps 25-27 - Reset User folder Permissions and ACLs\n\n\n*Download Batchmod.\n\n*Open Batchmod and browse to the user's user folder.\n\n*Apply permissions EXACTLY as follows and make sure ALL options are checked (above image):\n\n\n\nNow, in Batchmod, browse to the user's Public folder and select the Drop Box folder and apply the following permissions:\n\nAfter all steps are complete and the user can log into their domain account successfully and see all their data, then log back into the local admin account you have been using and do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable root (within directory utility)\n\n*Remove the user profile you used to test and confirm you could log into a domain account.\n\n*Open a terminal window and run dsconfigad -passinterval 0 (this supposedly helps the Mac to pick up password changes more accurately when mandatory password intervals hit.)\n\n*Make the newly migrated user a local admin if appropriate. (Hint: usually not appropriate.)\n\n\nI recommend leaving the local admin account in place so you can get into the machine in the future if anything ever goes awry with the connection to the domain.

Until two days ago, this worked pretty well. Unfortunately, while testing the Catalina update on one of these machines, I missed to check the network logon. Only after updating all machines, students started to complain that login wasn't possible anymore.\nThe problem: User tries to login with his network account name and password.

Catalina system file system is now read only. Mount points are now restricted.  I suspect the issue may be related to mount point problems.   I have network users as well and I am having no issues with that.  I did however have mount problems.  All mounts must now be in \n/System/Volumes/Data\nSo your mount point should probably be \n/System/Volumes/Data/home/gk784\nAt this point most likely you will need to change user home folder locations.

Then if I type and send a message, it does not arrive.\nInteresting detail: when I do the above (new message), when selecting the contact, by default the wrong phone number is selected. Apparently this number is used, no matter what I do.\nOne more detail: if I try to see which number of a contact was used, using his \"simple\" procedure: open thread, tap contact name on the top, tap \"info\", tap the \">\" sign at the far right, then the \"RECENT\" mark is on the phone number that I last selected for sending SMS. But this seems just to be a GUI thing, as the message never arrives.\nI don't have problems sending SMS message to other contacts (most of them have a single phone number).\nI also have no problems receiving messages from this contact. They appear in the mentioned existing thread. I just can not answer.\n\nA: Apparently this was fixed with one of the recent iOS updates.\nCurrently I have iOS 13.3 and this problem is gone.\nEdit: \"fixed\" is an overstatement. I can now send a message that arrives by manually selecting the correct phone number. If I write another message in the same thread, it is again sent to the wrong number. The RECENT label, if inspected, is again on the same wrong number, as before the \"fix\".\n\nA: \nThe contact has multiple phone numbers and I suspect the SMS is sent to a wrong one (not currently in use).\n\nChange the phone number label to anything but “mobile.”\nYou stated that the phone number is not currently used.  If this is the case, delete it.  If not, change the label to something else like “company main” or “home” or whatever.  Messages won’t send an SMS message to a non mobile number.\n\n", "Q: Opening application binary crashes I want to run an application with commandline arguments without having to open the terminal every time. I'm trying to do something like this, which requires finding the binary and making a dummy application that runs the binary with arguments.  \nWhen I use open on the application and when I click on it, it runs fine.  However, when I cd into the application and then run the binary from the terminal (which I found by opening the Info.plist) it crashes (more specifically, \nprints out \n<unknown>(0x1133fedc0):  ERROR| Assertion failed!\n\n\nExpression: ALE-CA900FE5\n\nand then segfaults. \nIs there something else that runs when I run open?  The manpages for open doesn't provide information on how open works. How would I debug this?\n\nA: To open an app from the command line you have to know where the application is located. The app in the Applications folder is just a package containing your app and icons and some other files. For example, go to your application folder and select the calculator app. Right-click on this app and you'll see an option to \"Show package contents\". That opens the app folder and you see another folder named Contents. That's a folder you can double click on to open. When you open this folder there are several folders with one named MacOS. Open that folder and you'll see the actual app named calculator.  To run this from the command line you need the complete pathname in your open statement.  Again for the calculator app this path is\n/Applications/Calculator.app/Contents/MacOS \n", "Q: Exporting podcasts from iOS app as OPML I have finally decided to switch from the Apple Podcast app to Overcast, but I cannot find a way to move my subscriptions. A (similar question) was asked a while ago, but iTunes has changed since then, and the new MacOS app doesn't have those menus. So, I was wondering if anyone knows another way to get an OPML file.\n\nA: The Podcasts app appears to store its data inside a sqlite database. Using the information inside we can create an OPML file that Overcast (or any good podcast app) will accept.\nHere's a script that I made that will create the OPML file:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsql() {\n    sqlite3 \"${HOME}/Library/Group Containers/\"*.groups.com.apple.podcasts/Documents/MTLibrary.sqlite \"select ${1} from ZMTPODCAST ${2:+\"where ${2} = '${3}'\"};\" |\\\n        sed -e 's/&/\\&amp;/g' \\\n            -e 's/</\\&lt;/g' \\\n            -e 's/>/\\&lgt;/g' \\\n            -e \"s/'/\\&apos;/g\"\n}\n\nopml_export=${HOME}/Desktop/podcasts.opml\ncat > ${opml_export} << HEAD\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<opml version=\"1.0\">\n  <head><title>Podcast Subscriptions</title></head>\n  <body>\n    <outline text=\"feeds\">\nHEAD\n\nsql ZUUID | while read -r uuid ; do\n    feed_url=$(sql ZFEEDURL ZUUID \"${uuid}\")\n    home_url=$(sql ZWEBPAGEURL ZUUID \"${uuid}\")\n    title=$(sql ZTITLE ZUUID \"${uuid}\")\n    cat <<EOT\n<outline type=\"rss\" text=\"${title}\" title=\"${title}\" xmlUrl=\"${feed_url}\" htmlUrl=\"${home_url}\" />\nEOT\ndone >> ${opml_export}\n\ncat >> ${opml_export} << TAIL\n    </outline>\n  </body>\n</opml>\nTAIL\n\nFor people unfamiliar with how to run scripts on the command line, it's easy:\n\n*\n\n*copy the entire text from the gray box above\n\n*open the Terminal app\n\n*at your Terminal prompt, type:\n\n*\n\n*pbpaste > export_podcasts.sh, pasting the text into an appropriately named file\n\n*hit return, then type:\n\n*chmod u+x export_podcasts.sh, making your file executable\n\n*hit return, then type:\n\n*./export_podcasts.sh, executing your script\n\n\n\nThis will create podcasts.opml on your desktop.\nTo get this file to your iPhone, you can use AirDrop or iCloud Drive:\nAirDrop - Make sure your Mac and iPhone have AirDrop enabled, you can right click on the file, then Share > AirDrop, and tap the icon showing your iPhone's avatar and phone name. This should automatically open the file on your iPhone and allow you to start the import in Overcast.\niCloud Drive - If iCloud Drive is set up on your Mac and iPhone, you can move podcasts.opml into an iCloud Drive folder on your Mac, and then open the file from your Files app on iPhone. It should then prompt you to \"Open with Overcast\", which should then import the podcasts in the file.\n", "Q: How to install Git Extension on MacOS?

Any ideas? Filed in Feedback Assistant (FB7434412).\nExternal drive is connected through USB-C.\n\n\n\nA: The 2018 MacBook Air includes the T2 security chip which can make it so you can't install macOS on an external disk. According the Other World Computing's blog:\n\nUnable to Install Catalina on an External Drive\nThis issue can occur because of the T2 Security Chip found in recent\nvintage [sic] Macs. The T2 chip protects your Mac by default from being\nbooted from an external device. This prevents someone from walking up\nto your Mac with a USB flash drive, booting your Mac, and accessing\nyour files.\nThe default settings will also prevent you from installing Catalina on\nan external drive.\n\nThey go on to explain that you need to tweak some of the Startup Security Utility settings, explained on another blog post.\n\nTo open the Startup Security Utility, you must boot your Mac in\nRecovery Mode. To do this:\n\n*\n\n*Turn on your Mac, and immediately press and hold Command (⌘)+R\nafter you see the Apple logo.\n\n*Booting in Recovery Mode, the next thing you’ll see is the macOS\nUtilities window. Select Utilities > Startup Security Utility from\nthe menu bar.\n\n*You’ll be asked to authenticate; click Enter macOS Password, then\nenter the name and password for an administrator account.\n\n\nYou would then need to set Secure Boot to No Security and set External Boot to Allow booting from external media.\nReboot your Mac and try to install the macOS on your external drive. According to everything I've read, the install should progress as expected.\nBe sure to set your Startup Security Utility settings back to Full Security and Disallow booting from external media when you are done.\nSee also https://support.apple.com/HT208198\n", "Q: How do you move ALL the data from an old drive to a new drive So, I'm going to replace the drive in a mid-2012 macbook pro with an ssd. What would be the easiest way to transfer all the data (files) from the drive to the ssd? Is it possible to have all the programs transfer over also? Do I have to reinstall the OS?\n\nA: Provided you have an enclosure for the HDD or SSD that you can connect via USB, you could use a tool like Carbon Copy Cloner. (CCC has a 30-day trial and is $39.99 to purchase after that. I've had good experience with CCC, but other free or paid utilities may work better for you.)\nThe convenient part of using CCC or another utility is that it can make the disk bootable, which is required for swapping the disks like you are asking. If you don't make the disk bootable, it won't boot.\nIf you don't have an enclosure, you can use an empty external hard drive as a middleman. Use your utility to make a bootable copy of your HDD on your external drive, physically swap out the HDD and SSD, boot to macOS from the external drive, then make a bootable copy from the external drive to the new SSD.\nIf you don't have an external drive or an enclosure, you may have to reinstall macOS and all your other applications and replace your data.\n\nA: Macs come with an app named \"Migration Assistant\" that will help you copy all files from an old computer to a new one. There are directions for Migration Assitant located on the internet and a good set of directions is given here.  This link will also describe the app. This is the Apple Supported method to transfer files from one computer to another. The app is in the Utilities folder which is in the Applications folder. Using the method described by @drivec to connect your drives this should enable you to use this app.\n\nA: The simplest way is to 'clone' the disk, making an exact duplicate, so that everything is exactly as you left it, but just on a new physical device.\nFirst of all, you need a way of connecting either the SSD as an external device, so that the SSD is connected. You can either get a SATA to USB cable, or you can get an 'enclosure', which is a box to put the drive in.\nNext, you have to copy the data. As said, you can use either SuperDuper! or  CCC (Carbon Copy Cloner), which are purpose-built tools to do the job. I recommend SuperDuper!, just for east of use.\nYou can also use Apple's Disk Utility, though it's a bit more complicated, and I wouldn't recommend it in the face of alternatives.\nThen you just have to physically swap the drives around. You'll have the original HDD as a spare copy, which you can access using the cable.\n", "Q: This copy of the Install macOS Mojave application is damaged: Even After Correcting Time I was trying to do a fresh install of a macOS Mojave.

The reason why I do this is because of this error in Preview while editing: \n\nThe original File can't be changed, so a duplicate with your changes has been created.\n\nThis error is annoying, keep in mind that my Minecraft/resourcepacks directory is under my ~/library/Application Support/ folder, which can probably explain why macOS wants to save the items as a dupe. But I want to create an override for my Minecraft resourcepacks folder instead of having to take the folder out to edit it.

I.e., Bluetooth audio stops behaving correctly whenever Memory Pressure in Activity Monitor is high; the only way to get it working again afterwards is to disable and re-enable Bluetooth.\nWhen I connect an audio device and use it to play music, audio stops working after a few minutes and switches to internal speakers instead (but the device continues to be shown as \"Connected\" in Bluetooth). This happens with all my Bluetooth audio devices (3 in total). I don't experience any of these issues when using the same devices with my smartphone. The issue started around a month ago, roughly at the time when I upgraded to macOS Catalina. I'm using a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015).\nI have tried the following steps already:\n\n\n*\n\n*Moving my bluetooth device right next to my laptop\n\n*Updating to macOS Catalina 10.15.1\n\n*Disabling and enabling Bluetooth\n\n*Restarting the laptop\n\n*Removing and re-adding all Bluetooth devices\n\n*Deleting the file \"com.apple.Bluetooth.plist\" in /Library/Preferences/\n\n*Resetting PRAM\n\n*Searching StackExchange and the internet for more advice\n\n\nNone of these have helped, not even temporarily.\nThis is what it looks like when the issue is present:\n\nWhen hovering over the audio device, its name disappears; when clicking it, the audio menu bar icon becomes animated and looks like it's searching/loading in a way I haven't seen before.\nAt the same time, the device looks normal in Bluetooth:\n\n\nI'd greatly appreciate any help!\n\nA: I tried a whole bunch of additional things that are related to sound rather than bluetooth.

($f is the filename and $f_converted is the converted name)\n\nA: Why AppleScript or Automator when this can be done in just Terminal? Are all the files in the same folder? What type of file is been converted, its extension, e.g .mp4?\nIf all the files are in the same folder and only the target files, then in Terminal, use to following commands:\ncd /path/to/target_files\nfor f in *.*; do echo ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -ac 2 -codec:a libmp3lame -b:a 48k -ar 24000 -write_xing 0 \"${f%.*}\"_converted\"${f##*.}\"; done\n\nNote: The for in do command has an intentional echo command so as to run one time to see what the output of the formed command line will look like in order to see if it looks proper. Run it a second time without the echo command to do the actual processing. If the target file type is e.g. .mp4, you can change *.* to *.mp4 or *.[mM][pP]4, where the latter handles both .mp4 and .MP4.\nIf you are using e.g. Automator with some Finder actions to get the target files to then run this in a Run Shell Script action, then set Pass input: to as arguments and use the following for the command:\nfor f in \"$@\"\ndo\n    ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -ac 2 -codec:a libmp3lame -b:a 48k -ar 24000 -write_xing 0 \"${f%.*}\"_converted\"${f##*.}\"\ndone\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*\"${f%.*}\" expands to just the filename portion, without the file extension.\n\n*\"${f##*.}\" expands to just the extension portion, without the filename portion.\n\n", "Q: Extend Catalina's privacy protection to other folders In MacOS Catalina apps need to ask for explicit permission to access certain user folders (such as ~/Documents and ~/Downloads).\nIs it possible to extend this protection to other folders (e.g. a custom user-created folder ~/foo) without moving it inside the Documents folder?\n\nA: No.\nThe restricted file locations are detailed here PrivacyPreferencesPolicyControl.Services and you can't change them.\nYou would have to move ~/foo to Documents, Downloads, an external drive, or another restricted location.\n", "Q: Macbook Air (2013) trackpad not responding The trackpad fails to respond after the computer got hung on a website video last night and then went into sleep mode.

On Android it works like it should.\nMy setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Provider: Rostelecom\n\n*Captive Portal Service Provider: WiFly\n\n*Router: Mikrotik\n\n*Transport: UniFi\n\n\nThe instructions from these vendors did not help in solving the problem.\n\nA: The automatic handling of captive portals on works by iOS automatically downloading various Apple URLs when connecting to a new network, such as these URLs:\nhttp://captive.apple.com/hotspot-detect.html\nhttps://www.apple.com/library/test/success.html\n  (and others)\nIf the download contains the word \"Success\", iOS is satisfied that the user has direct access to the Internet.\nIf the download contains something else, it is most probably a captive portal page, which requires the user to authenticate in some manner. This triggers the Apple Captive Network Assistant to display the downloaded page on screen.\nThe user then authenticates in some manner with this page. Afterwards iOS periodically checks those URLs mentioned before to see if it now contains the word \"Success\". As soon as it does, the CNA window is closed.\nThis method of detectiing captive portals and authenticating conforms to the WISPr 2.0 specification and allows the so called \"Universal Access Method\" for authentication. This specification is followed by iOS and Android devices alike.\nAs this doesn't happen for you, it means that your setup somehow prevents the iOS device from downloading the correct page. This could be due to incorrect cache settings on your proxy server (if you have one), incorrect DNS settings, incorrect authentication checks, etc. Especially it's important that you never block any of the apple.com pages used for captive portal detection.\nIn some cases you can also have problems, if your captive portal page presents an outdated or otherwise invalid TLS certificate.\nAnother source of errors is when your system redirects the user to another page when successfully authenticated. This could be to an internal page or an external page. Depending on how your system is setup, one of the two might be failing - so you could switch to the other type, or fix the configuration errors (such as firewall or authentication checks) that prevent the user from accesssing the redirect page.\nA good way to check is to use Wireshark to make a packet capture of the WiFi interface when trying to connect. You'll be able to see exactly what you're redirected to, and which request fails.\n", "Q: Early 2008 MacBook pro upgrades I have an early 2008 17 inch MacBook Pro, and I'm trying to upgrade it to run more like a modern laptop.

I've made sure that the sample rate of the audio file and the project is the same but it still doesn't make a difference. All the previously saved projects that had audio imported into them don't have a problem but if I try to upload a new audio file into those projects, I am encountering the same problem\n\nI have noticed that this doesn't affect only mp3 files (downloaded from the internet), but also m4a files recorded in my iPhone (with the factory voice recorder app) and sent to my MacBook.\nThe sample rate of Logic (in Project Settings > Audio) is 44.1kHz, as is the sample rate of all the files I try to import (except potentially the m4a files, soxi doesn't work on m4a though so I don't know their sample rates).\nHere is an example of an audio file which I may attempt to import:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/george-bakewell/originalrecording\nhere it is after dragging and dropping from Finder into Logic: \nhttps://soundcloud.com/george-bakewell/logicmangling\nIt sounds like some parts are just ... skipped. It sounds the same in Logic playback and after exporting (bouncing).\n\nI'm temporarily using the 'fix' that the reddit OP noted:\n\nI managed to bypass the issue by just converting all of my mp3 files to wav files.\n\nI just ran a few quick\nffmpeg -i originalrecording.m4a originalrecording.wav\nffmpeg -i originalrecording2.mp3 originalrecording2.wav\n\netc.\nDrag and drop the WAV files instead of the original files, and logic no longer chops them up weirdly.\n\nHow come this happens though?\nWhat's the root of this problem, and how can it be resolved?\n\nA: Ok so this is a known issue when upgrading to Catalina. I found a solution and I can't explain how/why it works, but it did work.\nI put the mp3 I was trying to use into Garageband, then selected Share>Export Song To Disk & saved the file as an mp3. I then went into Logic, File>Import>Audio File, selected the saved file from GarageBand and it somehow imported without issue! Can't explain why it worked but it did.\n\nA: You don't have to go thru all of that. Just do the file>import>audiofile and you should be good. For some reason the glitch occurs when you drag and drop when having the newest mac OS.\nCheers!\n\nA: I HAVE FOUND A WORKAROUND! After incredible frustration with issue I have discovered a temporary but effective way around this problem.\n\n*\n\n*Simply convert your audio files to MP4 format using an online converter (I use Zamzar)\n\n*Drop the MP4 file into your project and select 'Extract Audio'\n\n", "Q: Can I use my iMac late 2015 non-retina display in Target Mode?

After a short moment I am presented with „The installer information on the recovery server is damaged”. How can I fix that?\nThank you for your help in advance.\n\nA: This is a pretty rare failure since the installers are signed. You would want to review a couple things:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have a backup - consider using Disk Utility to erase the internal drive - then the installer would have less work to do. - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208496\n\n*Consider your network - are you behind a proxy / firewall / or located a distance away from the main servers in US? Taking your mac to a new network might fix everything without needing to erase things.\n\n*Shut down any caching servers that are local to your network. This might be hard to figure out if you aren’t the network admin or don’t have a mac. If you have another Mac running - run the command AssetCacheLocatorUtil\nIn the end - your computer couldn’t get a good image to start the install.

I have Mac Os Catalina installed. \n\nA: Apart from Enabling QOS on your network, I think you’ve shown that your internet egress/ingress can’t accommodate the amount of traffic your Mac asks for. One large source of traffic could be iCloud data being cached locally:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to know what nsurlsessiond is downloading\nYou can dig into everything the Mac is doing by opening Activity Monitor - select network and look at the received and sent packet counts and volume. Over 30 to 300 seconds, you should have a good idea if you can or care to quit programs that are asking for more data than the router can accommodate.\nAlso - check with your ISP / router support team. There are quality of service and other items that can prevent buffer bloat and allow ping/ICMP traffic to not be impacted by large downloads. You don’t have to change anything on the Mac to keep ping times exactly where you wish - just most people and routers will let any one device take all the network - first come, first serve. You could change that on the network side.\n", "Q: \"1 alert\" is on the next to \"About This Mac\" I am using MacBook Air 11' Early 2015 and macOS Mojave 10.14.6. \nI have recently noticed the message \"1 alert\" appeared next to \"About This Mac\" in Apple menu.\n\nThere seems to be nothing strange in \"About This Mac\" dialog.\nI guess that this happpened after running some executable(s) in /System/Library/CoreServices. \nI tried logging as root (saw Silencing the Memory slot utility), but it persists.\nAny idea to get rid of this alert?

It will print a live result from each AppleScript command executed during the run of a script, whereas the Results pane only returns the overall result of the script's execution (which equates to the result of only the final command).\nThe final command in your script will be set cityName to city of json, and so the result of your script will be the value of cityName after it has been set to the value from the JSON record that pertains specifically to the last IP address in your list, i.e. \"146.201.166.248\".\nSo for a more comprehensive solution, you can edit your script slightly so that the last command will be one that returns what you actually want.  You can do this by first declaring a variable as an empty list, into which you would add an item of data in each iteration of your repeat loop.  After the repeat loop is complete, your final command would simply be a reference to that list so as to have AppleScript evaluate its contents and return the result:\nset APIKey to \"<your secret key>\"\nset URLRelativePath to \"http://api.ipstack.com/\"\nset URLQueryString to \"?access_key=\" & the APIKey & \"&fields=city\"\n\nset IPaddresses to {\"104.137.108.23\", \"107.140.9.50\", \"146.201.166.248\"}\n\nset cityNames to {}\n\ntell application \"JSON Helper\" to repeat with IPaddress in the IPaddresses\n        fetch JSON from the URLRelativePath & the IPaddress & the URLQueryString\n        set the end of cityNames to the contents of the result's city\n        --OR: set the end of cityNames to the contents of {the IPaddress, the result's city}\nend repeat\n\nreturn the cityNames\n\nThis returns a list of all the city names (or a list of lists of IP address-city name pairs if you elect to use the line I commented out as an alternative).  To make this list into a single piece of text with one city per line, use the list that contains city names only; set the text item delimiters to linefeed; then coerce the list to text.  So, instead of return the cityNames, you would have:\nset my text item delimiters to linefeed\nreturn the cityNames as text\n\n\nA: Try using the log() function, it will log the results to the messages pane.\nExample:\nset i to 1\n\nrepeat 10 times\n\n    log (i)\n\n    set i to i + 1\nend repeat\n\nMake sure that you open up the messages pane:\n\nEdit:\nIf it's important that it's only the returned value, than you could simply keep track of all the strings and add them together and return the composite.

I have a Macbook Air with 121gb of storage on a SSD.  I use iCloud and have approx 1.5TB of data in the cloud.  I have clicked optimise storage and I now only have 8GB lefton my SSD, so not enough space to complete the latest iOS update.\nI have read that optimise storage leaves a percentage of disk space free, however, it doesn't appear to have allowed enough!\nIf I un click optimise storage, it tries to download everything.\nIs there anyway that I can keep all my files in the cloud and just use them there and not download any of them onto my HD?\n\nA: Yes - when you untick the check mark for Photos or Documents (likely the two largest items of iCloud space) you are asked if you want to keep a local copy (which you _don’t want to do) or just let the items live in the cloud (which you want - at least temporarily).\nChoose to delete the local copy and then you will have the files only in iCloud.\nKeep in mind, that after you delete files, macOS will keep space allocated / file content around for a short time as local snapshots or local time machine backups, so you will want to either thin the local snapshots or wait a day for them to age out.\n\n\n*\n\n*Why does my mac not have free space even after I delete files?\nWorst case - you can get an application like Daisy Disk (paid on the App Store, but a free trial from their web site - which has the bonus feature of letting you run a scan as administrator) and it makes it very simple to purge these temporary files sooner if you need. The app also does an amazing job showing you other large uses of space if my guess is wrong about documents and photos being your major space allocations.\n", "Q: Why does the Magic Mouse prevent me from clicking with my trackpad? It often happens to me that I open my MacBook Pro to use it while traveling, only to find out that I can't use it because the effin' Magic is locked away in some luggage, and the trackpad is not clicking. Of course I cannot turn the Bluetooth off, since the trackpad doesn't click. But the weirdest thing is that I always turn the Magic Mouse off before putting it away (I move the slide on the bottom so that the green color is not showing), yet it still prevents me from using the trackpad!\nWhy does that happen? What's with this brilliant design choice that one couldn't use the trackpad if one also has a Magic Mouse?\n\nA: This is a feature, not a bug. The idea is that you might want to disable the trackpad if you are using a mouse because, for example, you accidentally hit the trackpad with the palm of your hand.\nI thought it was turned off by default, but in any case, here’s how to turn it on or off:\n\nSystem Preferences » Accessibility » Mouse & Trackpad \n[ ] Ignore built-in trackpad when mouse or wireless trackpad is present \nFor more details: OSX Daily: Ignoring Built-in Trackpad Input When Using External Mouse with MacBook\nTurning Bluetooth On / Off Without the Mouse\n1) If you have brew installed, you can easily install blueutil via brew install blueutil.

I chose Apple Pay while paying on a website using an iPad (iOS 13) and then a Mac OS (Mojave), and got a pop-up asking for my phone number and an email.

The pop-up was legit from Apple Pay.\nI was under impression Apple Pay won't ask for (and especially share) any information unless it's absolutely necessary. Apple Pay on my Mac never asked for any of this before. \nIs there any official source explaining why is that information required, and what information would be shared with the merchant?

Should one change the login password afterwards to be sure?\n\nA: It's not really meaningful to provide a blanket \"yes\" or \"no\" answer. Instead, let's look at some scenarios.\n\n\n*\n\n*Unsophisticated attacker -- probably no.\n\n\n*\n\n*If there is a recent high-risk security problem and you have not yet installed the latest OS update, mmmmaybe.\n\n\n*Limited physical access -- probably no.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you let the attacker out of your sight even briefly, be a little bit concerned.

If so, get professional security advice instead of googling random security-related questions. Chances are there's a team of security researchers who is eager to take you on as a research topic if you have reasons to believe you are under attack from a nation-state security agency or similar.\n\n*Could you be a \"useful idiot\" for someone trying to reach a high-profile target? Like, are you personal friends with Lois Lane and Clark Kent? Or are many of your friends the president of Lugunda, or guerrillas from the People's Liberation Front of Elbonia?\n\n\n\nThere are indications that cybersecurity ops from several countries are equipped to break into systems using \"zero-day exploits\". This means that there is a security problem which has not yet been communicated to the vendor, let alone fixed with a security update.  We can't rule out the possibility that there is an attacker right here right now who has access to your system using secret back doors. But they are unlikely to risk spending such valuable assets on a low-priority target -- every exposure increases the risk that they could get caught.\nOf course, if any of this sounds even remotely plausible, you would not loan your device to strangers in the first place, let alone reveal your password to them.\nThough really, there should never ever be a scenario where you reveal your password to anyone.

I got the message: \n\nAn error occurred while restoring from the backup. Try restoring from a different backup or reinstall macOS and then transfer your information from a Time Machine backup using Migration assistant.\n\nI then restarted the Mac, and tried to enter macOS Recovery (⌘+R on boot). I saw the \"spinning globe\" icon for about 4 minutes, but then it gave the error:\n\napple.com/support\n  -1008F\n\nI have since reset the NVRAM (⌥+⌘+P+R) but I continually get the \"-1008F\" error when trying to access macOS Recovery. However, in this Reddit thread regarding this nominal issue for the macOS Catalina Beta, they suggest to try another Recovery key combination (⌘+⌥+R on boot), and this indeed gets me into some sort of Recovery mode where I'm first asked to enter my Apple ID, and I can afterwards see the usual Recovery options like Disk Utility, Reinstall MacOS, Restore from Time Machine backup, etc.\nHowever, I am unsure on how to proceed from this point. As mentioned, my previous Time Machine restoration failed from macOS Recovery (the backup is located on a Synology NAS on my network; I have an additional concurrent backup on another Synology NAS which I haven't tried yet).\nFurthermore, according to some sources I found on the net when searching for the \"-1008F\" error, it can be indicative of hardware failure and some people seem to have had hardware parts replaced. I did notice that when I entered macOS Recovery the first time, it was lingering a very long time on the state: \"Examining available disks...\".\nWhen checking Disk Utility, I have two Mac HD Partitions apparently since installing macOS Catalina: Macintosh HD for the OS partition and Macintosh HD - Data for user data. Since macOS Mojave doesn't use this setup, do I need to \"merge\" these partitions to successfully restore from the Time Machine backup or reinstall macOS Mojave from scratch? I wonder this because when I navigate to the Time Machine backup process, it asks me which partition to restore into – and I can select both the Macintosh HD and Macintosh HD - Data partitions. This doesn't feel right, as macOS Mojave uses one partition for both OS and user data.\nIf I indeed need to \"merge\" the two partitions (e.g. by reformatting them into one \"Macintosh HD\" partition), how do I do that? A user in this Reddit thread regarding the MacOS Catalina beta suggests to \"Erase the APFS container and format it again as APFS\", but I don't understand what the user means by the \"AFPS container\". I don't see a single container encapsulating both partitions, rather they appear like two separate things seen in the images below:\n\n\nTo make a long story short: how do I best resolve this problem and restore my Time Machine backup to my macOS Mojave system from the now broken macOS Catalina system? \nDo I need to reformat the drive first, and can I then restore from my Time Machine backup – or should I install a fresh copy of macOS Mojave and then attempt restoration via the Migration Assistant?\n\nA: I was in contact with Apple's support for this issue, and it was ultimately resolved although a bit tortuous.\nThere are several modes of MacOS Recovery, accessible by holding different key combinations as described here.\nTrying to access MacOS Recovery failed and gave the \"-1008F\" error every time I tried the MacOS Recovery modes \"Reinstall the latest macOS that was installed on your Mac (recommended)\" (⌘+R) and \"Upgrade to the latest macOS that is compatible with your Mac.\" (⌥+⌘+R).\nHowever, the mode \"Reinstall the macOS that came with your Mac, or the closest version still available.\" (⇧+⌥+⌘+R) did work for me. From this mode, I was instructed by Apple Support to wipe/format the disk entirely clean using MacOS Recovery mode's Disk Utility and create a new volume (I'm not sure if this step is absolutely necessary). From there on, I could successfully install MacOS Mojave (the OS that originally shipped with the Mac).\nNext arose the issue of restoring my system. My intention was to stay on MacOS Mojave instead of MacOS Catalina, but unfortunately it appears that when I installed MacOS Catalina the first time (before all this happened and I decided to go back to MacOS Mojave) – MacOS Catalina actually converted format of my Time Machine backups stored on my NAS from the traditional .sparsebundle format to the newly introduced .backupbundle format. I think this was disingenuous by Apple, because I had not been asked for this conversion to occur, nor did any Time Machine backup process once MacOS Catalina was installed ever move past the backup preparation stage since I had manually disabled Time Machine backup. In other words, MacOS Catalina converts your Time Machine backups to a new format without asking you!\nThe problem is of course that the new .backupbundle format of Time Machine backups cannot be identified by MacOS Mojave. According to Apple Support, Apple does for the time being provide a \"secret\" method to convert .backupbundle files back to .sparsebundle, but this is not something that they are announcing publicly because apparently they want all users to shift to MacOS Catalina. Rather than hassle with this however, I opted to upgrade to MacOS Catalina and try to restore my Time Machine backups from there instead.\nOnce MacOS had been upgraded to a clean install of Catalina, a had a new problem because the Time Machine backups were now identifiable but not restorable by Migration Assistant.app, the recommended Time Machine restoration application in MacOS.  I believe the error message said something like \"Could not open backup, file in use...\" (paraphrasing). It turns out that there was an issue with MacOS/Migration Assistant not being able to open Time Machine backups stored on my Synology NAS devices over the network, even when trying different modes of SMB/AFP. The solution was to copy the .backupbundle files from the NAS onto an external USB/Thunderbolt drive, then mount the .backupbundle file by double-clicking it in Finder, and finally running Migration Assistant again. From thereon, I could successfully restore my files and system configuration onto MacOS Catalina.\nThe first lesson here is not to keep Time Machine backups only on NAS devices, because they are unsupported Time Machine destinations in Apple's view. Apple primarily supports Time Machine backups on external USB/Thunderbolt drives, and were not inclined to help me resolve the problem of reading the Time Machine backup on the NAS. I had to buy an entire new external drive in order to relocate the .backupbundle file and restore it, and I now intend to back up both to the external drive and NAS continually. The second lesson is to make copies of your Time Machine backups before upgrading to a new OS – I did not foresee that MacOS Catalina would convert or otherwise do things to my backup files upon OS upgrade without my permission!\nHope this is of use to anyone else running into this chain of issues after upgrading to MacOS Catalina.\n", "Q: Watch Me Do or other method for exact pixel coordinate of mouse click (Automator) Is it possible to specify how a mouse click point is recorded or processed in Watch Me Do? \nhad thought it was exact pixel position recorded but it seems that in a safari browser it is relative to the page scroll... \nIs there another way to simulate actions clicking in exact locations (irrespectivec of browser scrollbar)? \nSpecifically, I would prefer a non-third party tool solution - using Automator if possible. \n\nA: Automator can ‘Run AppleScript’, and you can click at a coordinate using AppleScript:\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n  click at {123,456}\nend tell\n\n\nHow do I make the mouse click at current location using AppleScript?\n", "Q: App Store can't update an app It just keeps giving the Update option, even after \"updating\" the app. Take a look at this video.

I have a MacBook Pro running macOS 10.14.6 that is frequently connected to a privacy-focused VPN that tunnels all non-local traffic and handles all DNS requests. However there is one hostname that I would like my local network's DNS server to handle (as specified by the local DHCP server). The reason is that depending on which local network my MacBook Pro is connected to this hostname may resolve to a local IP address, and in that case I don't want traffic to it to be tunneled through the VPN.\nI've learned that I can override what DNS server is used to resolve a domain name by creating a file at /etc/resolver/hostname.domain and with the contents nameserver [ip address] where hostname.domain is the fully qualified domain name. However that only works if the IP address of the DNS server I want to use remains consistent. What I want it to do is use whatever DNS server is served by my local network's DHCP server.\nIs there any way I can accomplish this using existing features of macOS or third party software?\nIn case it's relevant, the VPN's DNS server is provided and setup at connection time, and is not guaranteed to be the same IP address every time.\n(I could write a script to do this by having it run whenever the network connection changes, checking the system's current local IP address, and then changing the /etc/resolver/hostname.domain file to point to the correct server but I'm trying to avoid having to do that work if possible!)\n\nA: You could configure dnsmasq to \n\n\n*\n\n*use your local DNS as an upstream server for the domain in question\n\n*use the VPN's DNS as the upstream for all other requests\n\n\nThis can be achieved by configuring a domain dependent upstream server in /etc/dnsmasq.conf, for example:\nserver=/hostname.domain/dns.server.local\n\nThen change the VPN configuration to use your dnsmasq setup as its DNS server. \ndnsmasq can be easily installed with Homebrew as follows:\nbrew install dnsmasq\n\nNote that, in such a setup, the configuration file is located in $(brew --prefix)/etc/dnsmasq.conf.

I usually set the Finder to display my files in the list view option, which allows us to set the icon size to either small or large (which I assume corresponds to 16px and 32px, respectively). But regardless of choosing the list view or any other option in the Finder, any item that uses a custom icon that is set to 32px or below is displayed in a lower quality. By “lower quality” I’m referring to the icon’s definition in the sense that it is displayed blurrier and less crisp, with white pixels around the edges. The edges seem less crisp and in a few icons there is an overall drop in definition. When inspecting the icons in Preview.app, icon sizes below 32px are indeed of worse quality in the custom icon folder.\nThis issue occurs regardless of using the “copy-paste” or the “drag .icns” methods through “get info” to assign custom icons (see https://www.lifewire.com/personalize-mac-by-changing-desktop-icons-2260911). This issue occurs regardless of using “macOS’ default system icons” (see http://osxdaily.com/2014/07/27/mac-os-x-system-icons-location/) or any other icons to assign custom icons.

I am importing thousands of photos from SD cards into albums on my Mac. Import is not super-quick but OK, but when I select \"delete items after import\" then it seems to delete about one image per second. Further, it claims import is complete but blocks more updates until complete, which gives the impression of hanging.\nIs this a known issue and is there any explanation or workaround?\n\nA: Use image capture to get the photos to your Mac. Then import from a fast storage location. The delay is cleanup data to the SD cards. \nGet all the data off fast so you can let photos import rapidly and decouple the delete of the card till later. \n\nA: SD cards can’t be slow in this setup.

I've seen this is somewhat common with batteries that are under 80%.\nShould I replace mine? I've contacted apple and they told me to schedule sometime in a store.\n\nA: Yes - there are three reasons I’ve seen the service battery be issued:\n\n\n*\n\n*The voltage will drop too soon even though there is full charge capacity enough to be above 80% “beginning to lose capacity” line.\n\n*The Full Charge Capacity isn’t enough to get normal life out of the battery.\n\n*Charging anomalies - the battery needs to behave when charging as well as when discharging.\n\n\nIt’s most common to have the first two, but all three can spark a “check engine” light on the battery sensors and Apple’s diagnostic tools will have much more detailed telemetry and analysis once you get that service done. That runs without opening the device so you may or may not need a battery or other parts repaired.\n\nOnce you’ve had a scan and gotten a quote, I recommend you delay the replacement as long as you can if it’s safe to charge. Better to get all the life you can out of the existing chemicals and battery if you can still make a convenient appointment later. Be sure to get it serviced before any long trip or if you can’t get the use you require of course, but arbitrarily replacing at 80% would take a couple years off my batteries since the original iPhone.

(All further UI interaction appears to be ignored, but in actuality it is getting queued and will continue to run at a fraction of real-time speed.)\n\n*I need to stop and wait for all of those input actions to complete. This can take several minutes, sometimes over 15 if I try to do things like click on an icon in the dock, move a window within a specific Space, or other do what a frustrated user might do while his machine seems unresponsive.\n\n\nSide Effects\nMassive Load Spike\nThe immediate reason for this would appear because the system load which already was running between 3-4 (computer has 4 effective CPUs, so just under nominal efficiency when it is effectively idle from human input, it will shoot up to a very high number (well over 100 or 200 while going through these antics) and it will take several minutes for the load \"settle down\" after the slow-mo effects stop, and that's just for it to get from 200 down to about 25 where it will plateau for easily another another 10 minutes.\nQueuing of System Processes\nAs I am still in the process of building my computer from scratch based on a build template document that I made to manually install my software tools setup on a fresh machine, I find this enormously disconcerting.\nBuild Details\n\n\n*\n\n*Use updated to be Catalina compliant with things like DeviceKit\n\n*Some open source tools require explicit security authorization to even install, but the seem like innocuous exceptions which don't require additional kernel drivers and I hope they will be compliant by January.\n\n*I don't use \"junk ware\" that could easily border on Malware (such as \"virus protection).\n\n*I do use brew cask install or any software that I can.\n\n*For anything else, I use App Store.\n\n\nInitial Conclusions\nI don't have any idea if these apps have any correlation to this behavior or not. When this does happen, I will often system processes come up and take more than 50% of the CPU, but I attribute this to the fact that they are queuing because of the absurdly high load and more a symptom than a cause of my problems. I have even given up Chrome for Safari in an attempt to better make use of shared resources and minimize deviating from the Apple nest. I have already turned on \"Reduce Motion\" and \"Reduce Transparency\" for Accessibility -> Display but it had no impact.\nPossible Heat Problem?\nOne theory I had was that my fans are dirty and not cooling my CPU well. I did have performance problems when this machine was running Mojave with 30-90 second lock-ups, but since I had upgraded it through at least 3 OS versions, I attributed it to KEXT cruft or other junk software I used when I was less careful. The fans do spin up just fine as the CPUs heat up, but the CPU core temp wavers between 70°C and 80°C even when load is under 4. Therefore, I am wondering if all of this is simply CPU clipping from heat but I don't know where the temp will induce this fail-safe. If I simply cannot rule out blocked airflow I will crack this baby open and give it the canned air blast, but seeing as I replaced the fans and battery just 14 months ago that would be surprising as I don't work in a lint factory.\nWhat I am Hoping to Achieve by Posting This\nIn any event, while I don't expect anyone to identify why Expose is behaving this way (though I would be grateful for some troubleshooting tips as I am only a few days into using Catalina.) What I was hoping for was if anyone was aware of how I might turn off any of the gratuitous animation features introduced by Catalina that might be exacerbating this problem. \nUpdate 11/11/19 17:20\nAfter running in Safe Mode and loading nearly every app I couldn't replicate the problem, even though things like scrolling were definitely affected. There didn't seem to be any temp problems and spikes to over 90° quickly subsided so unless this is a slow buildup heat issue, I don't think that is it.\nOne thing I failed to mention was that when this problem occurred, there was 3.7 GB in the 5 GB swap space. Starting up the machine normally and running the apps like I did in Safe Mode also didn't recreate those problems, but swap is still unused. I should have noted this, but in the past, I have correlated the sluggishness of the Expose animation with how much is in swap.\nMy new theory is that there is some memory leaking going on that uses up virtual memory and the slowness and load is a result of relentless paging. I think I will only be able to substantiate this after letting my machine have an uptime of more than a day or two with lots of apps open so I can see. Then I can identify which apps have the highest page rates.\nUpdate 11/12/19 01:54\nAfter opening it up and not seeing much dust at all I lifted the cooling plate to check the thermal paste which was dried and barely present. I added some fresh paste after cleaning both surfaces but I am not sure if I used too much or the surfaces weren't both clean enough but I am finding temps seeming to spike over 100°C occasionally and it overall running hotter, though the hot peaks are only instantaneous.\nI ran GeekBench both before and after, both in Safe and regular mode and performance results were effectively the same. Results are actually slightly higher than the benchmarks established for my model. It seems awfully hot but it is not affecting performance any. Having read articles stating that the i7 can safely operate at 100°C (though some authorities say it is too hot for any duration).\nI installed the Intel Power Gadget and it shows my overage clocking is about 2.45 GHz but that it does peak out at the stated 3.1 GHz so I don't think it is being clipped. Still, the performance mystery abounds, but one thing is for sure- it takes days if not weeks for all of the Catalina housekeeping on media and pictures to complete!\n\nA: It sounds very likely that you have an hardware error such as fans not working, thermal paste not properly applied, vents blocked or similar.\nA load average of 3-4 when the machine is idle is definitely not normal. Your machine is a dual-core machine - HyperThreading doesn’t really make it sensible to count that as 4 cores (it’s not nearly as good as separate cores). A load avg. of 3-4 means the computer is highly loaded.\nThe high load average could come from thermal throttling (either via kernel_task forcing the CPU to sleep, or simply frequency throttling). It could also come from other sources such as a malfunctioning disk - although then you would most likely be experiencing other problems as well.\nI will recommend booting in Internet Recovery mode to check if you still have high load average and slow performance there. If you do, then it’s not a software problem.\n\nA: Actions Taken\nMy solution involved the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cleaning the fans and airways\n\n*Replacing the thermal paste\n\n*Adding monitoring for temp and fan speed\n\n*Increasing the overall fan speeds using custom rules over the system defaults\n\n\nCleaning the Hardware\nI took my MacBookPro apart and found that there was a bit of dust accumulated in the fan itself and about 10% of the heat sink's fins were blocked with linty dust. There were also some dust-bunnies and random spots on the board and in pockets of the chassis. It didn't seem like a lot of dust, but I blasted it with canned air nonetheless.\nSimilarly, I was delighted that I still had a new tube of thermal paste in my computer toolkit. After unscrewing the heat-sink plate cinch from from the CPU core, I saw the old paste was all but dried up and very anemic. I used a dry cloth to wipe both surfaces clean and applied fresh pasted and cinched it back down. However, I may have used too much paste since there was some excess squeezed out the sides. The cinch was as tight as it would go without over-tightening and risking either stripping the heads, shearing the screws or ripping out the threading. The goal was to ensure there was no way for air bubbles trapped in the paste that could heat up and reduce the surface area where paste contacted both surfaces.\nSoftware\nBefore I addressed the cooling, I added and configured three utilities:\nFan/Temp Readings and Controls: iStat Menus / Macs Fan Control\nBoth of these utilities have the ability to measure the fan speed and CPU temperature, both have a trial version, but iStat Menus reads about two dozen other temperature sensors throughout the system while MFC only reads the CPU core temp. While I first used MFS, I later found iSM to be the better overall choice as it has utility far beyond temp and fan management so I paid the $10 to use it as an overall metrics display.\nMFC has limited fan control in trial mode while iStat Menus is fully functional where you can create custom fan speed rules so you can try it before you buy it to see if it is for you. Also, to be fair, iSM and MFC are not really comparable in scope since iSM allows you to make extensive customizable graphs for nearly every system metric imaginable.\nFurthermore, iSM appears to measure stats which are already being reported much like /proc is in Linux. To test, running with and without iSM I saw little variance in performance (using Activity Monitor, which I don't recommend running indefinitely as it uses a lot of resources relatively speaking). Even the memory footprint of the UI elements of iSM is only 35 MB - less than 1/4 of Activity Monitor which can also spike CPU load making it inappropriate as a full-time monitor like iSM is.\nWhile I still have MFS installed, I don't really use it in favor of iSM. I keep it in case I need to have a potentially more lightweight fan controller/speedometer than iSM, but I have not had the need for it yet.\nCPU Clock Measurement: Intel Power Gadget\nIn addition to iSM, Intel Power Gadget provides visibility of the variable CPU speed which actually is constantly fluctuating depending on system demand. I am not certain that this tool would register \"clipping\" as the result of overheating, but I can't imagine why it wouldn't. Like iSM it also provides extensive graphing features. Furthermore, it provides a new metric of CPU speed as a datapoint that iSM now puts in the CPU metrics and it's listed right next to the CPU Core temp for easy tracking! The tool need not even be running to read this- it is added to the rest of the system metrics that iStat can read! This was a great find and added a crucial metrics that I lacked before.\nResults\nIn order to establish a speed benchmark, I used Geekbench 5 to get a baseline before and after the cooling cleanup and tuning. I also ran it in Safe Mode as well as normal mode (with as little running as possible, though this was not a pure test since things like photoanalysisd were often chugging along in the background regardless). Still, what I found was very surprising: while performance was drastically improved when heat was tamed, measurements after cleaning actually showed the CPU hitting hotter temps at spikes. I have a hypothesis for why, however.\nPerformance Improvements\nBefore I cleaned the cooling system and added fresh paste, bench tests showed single/multi CPU ratings at around 700/1775 at start both before and after the cleaning. Running the fans at max at all times vs cleaning the cooling didn't change performance measurably. Also, that measure is actually just above the Geekbench stated average for my machine. (Safe Mode tests actually were about 5-10% slower.)\nWhile I waited for my machine to grow sluggish from either heat or the bloating of swap usage and grinding from page ins and outs, the fact that I had imposed more aggressive fan speed rules with iSM seemed to keep heat spikes in check all its own. Furthermore, after cleaning - even if I return fan speed rules to system defaults as before - I couldn't recreate the lockup problems even though the CPU temp was reporting at being 10O°C for sustained high load. It would seem that the CPU can get hotter that previous thought in order for the CPU to get clipped because I could see that my CPU speed was in \"turbo\" mode at zesty 3.4 GHz when running a GB CPU test. Even under extreme duress with fan settings that let the CPU reach temps over 100°C for more than 30 seconds, the overall performance improvements were profound and the machine just in anecdotal usability. The nasty problems with Expose/Mission Control did not recur.\nApparent High Temperature Spikes\nAdmittedly there is one anomaly that initially made no sense. Before I cleaned it and just ran the fan at max speed, CPU temps had a high floor even at rest 65°-75°C but the maximum measured temp never seemed to get hotter than 90°C. After cleaning, measurement behavior was very different. While the floor temperature at rest was lower with fan defaults when idle (sometimes as low as 40°C), I noticed that both the CPU core temperature would fluctuate wildly with load (and CPU speeds) where before the measurements showed a much more gradual change even though the measurement polling and refresh was the same. Also, aside from faster heating and cooling of sensors, the max readings occasionally peaked over 100° when it never reported as being that hot before. With the fan rules set to more aggressive settings that respond to higher temps with faster speeds, the CPU floor temp was about 15°-20°C lower with a load between 3-4, often down in the 40's when load was around 1. (More on system load and temp volatility in a bit.)\nConclusions\n\n\n*\n\n*It is clear that poor cooling was the primary factor in my machine's poor performance, though saying just that is a gross oversimplification of the results I saw. For one, I believe the measurements I took before the cleaning and pasting were not accurate nor precise because of dust buildup. It is possible that the wildly spiking temps that are commensurate with the changing CPU speeds that vary with the machines workload, the performance improvements don't track with this possibility. Since the temp sensors are what the machine uses to regulate CPU, it is possible that the disparity was causing some problems. Once the sensors could report accurately and precisely, all-around performance was closer to intended design.\n\n*In addition to the physical cleaning, running with faster fan speeds did wonders for improving cooling just as one might expect before cleaning, however with a cleaned cooling channel the effects were that much more evident. While it appears to keep heat-related problems at bay running at full speed nearly constantly before cleaning, after cleaning I could relax the rules substantially and taming the heat was accomplished much more easily knowing that actual vs measured temps were not in disparity.\n\n*Therefore, my running hypothesis for the temp volatility is that the CPU temp sensors' readings are outside the CPU code and had been muddied by dust accumulation. After being cleaned this may have allowed them to be more precise and accurate. It may be that higher temp spikes simply were not sustained long enough to to be read beforehand since the dust insulated the probes. Not knowing where the sensor probes that measure CPU temps physically are, I cannot say if this holds water or not.\n\n*Finally, after cleaning and tuning the fan rules, system load - while still often spiking as high as 30 or 40, was not so terrible that it ground the machine to a halt. High load spikes are just a fact of life on older Macs, but I now know they don't have to be crippling. Before I cleaned and cooled, it looked like Expose/Mission control animation problems kicked in when load was over 100. Now, loads can get as high as 40 if I rally push it and it's paging like crazy, but even when the machine is at 3.4 GHz and fans are maxed out under large CPU and I/O loads and where it is paging at a rate of 8 MB/second, performance impacts leave my machine still useable if but a little sluggish on the UI.\n\n\nTL;DR: Dusting the cooling system and upping the fan speeds as specific temp thresholds is what it took to get my machine back to its healthy self. Also, the i7 CPU has a variable clock rate that is a power saving feature, not just a throttle for when the heat spikes - at least not under normal operating conditions. Adding some good metrics that don't tax the system are crucial in seeing something other than an anecdotally notable improvement and iState Menus seems like a great choice if you're data hungry. There are more lightweight open source and command line tools out there for purists.\nI hope these lengthy breakdown was helpful. I found it was worth going into all of the details, even if there was some redundancy.\n", "Q: Does macOS come with (the ruby framework) rails?

Connecting power cable solved it.\n\nA: There is two solutions that I can recommend for you. \nFirst, a very generic one where you need to close the screen lid. \n\n\n*\n\n*Hook the LCD display to the Mac with the appropriate adapter\n\n*Hook up the external keyboard and mouse (optional but recommended)\n\n*Boot the MacBook with the broken screen, then close the screen during boot\n\n\nThis will automatically boot your Mac to use the attached external screen\nIn brief: Restart your system and then close the lid so the lid sensor acknowledges the lid is closed your external display should automatically become the primary display.\nAnd, Second, if you have another Macbook with you, you can try this crazy idea too\nIf you have easy access to a second Mac and the right cable to connect the two (e.g., Thunderbolt to Thunderbolt, USB-C to Thunderbolt, USB-C to USB-C, etc.), you could:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the two Macs with said cable\n\n*Put your damaged MacBook Pro into Target Disk Mode by holding down its \"T\" key while you turn it on\n\n*Turn on the second Mac while holding down its Option key so you get to choose which partition to boot from\n\n*Choose the system volume of the broken MacBook Pro\n\n\nThis basically lets you use the intact second Mac to boot into the system that is installed on the MacBook Pro with the damaged screen. If there are indeed any software or hard drive issues with that first Mac that prevented you from logging in, you are now able to see and potentially address them.\nFor more details on Target Disk Mode, see this guide.\n", "Q: Macbook not turning on My MacBook air 2015 was lid turned down for more than a month\nWhen I opened the lid, it had 12% battery and I put it on charging and send an email to myself\nAfter I came back it is blank and not turning on, it shows charging and nothing else\nOnly for the fact that on pressing control, shift, option then power button, charging indicator shows fully charged green then back to orange charging state\nMy question: Is my mac fine and how to make it working again?\n\nA: Actually it went away and came back again\nWe sent it to apple care in another state and found it to be corrupted logic board, they repaired and its as good as it can be\n", "Q: How do I get my monitor to run at the correct resolution reliably? I just started a new remote job. They shipped me a 2018 15\" Macbook Pro, a 32\" Asus PB328Q monitor (QHD, aka 2560x1440), and a Satechi USB-C adapter, with an HDMI cable for connecting the monitor. All of the above were used previously by a former employee. I am running macOS Mojave 10.14.6; upgrading to Catalina is not an option at the moment for IT policy reasons. \nAbout 90% of the time (including right now), when I connect the monitor, the system runs it at 1080p resolution. As expected when running at non-native resolution, everything is blurry onscreen and I don't get the real estate I want.\nIf I unplug and replug the adapter from the laptop, or the HDMI cable from the adapter, there's a small chance it will come back at the right resolution. I have only had this work when plugging into the left-side ports on the laptop.\nThe Displays prefpane's extra window for the monitor shows that it is being recognized correctly as a PB328. Option-clicking on Scaled to reveal more resolutions does not help. (By default, only four resolutions are shown; option-clicking reveals several more, but none larger than 1080p.)\n\nIf I unplug and replug repeatedly, eventually the native resolution shows up. At the same time, the Refresh Rate dropdown is disabled and the Underscan option disappears. Perhaps these are useful indicators?\n\nI found this related question, which has no accepted answer. ColorSync Utility reports \"No problems found.\" The monitor does not support HDMI 2.0, so that can't be the problem. I am on the latest version of Mojave and this monitor is not new, so I don't think graphics drivers could be it.\nCould this be related to switching between integrated and discrete graphics? If yes, how can I confirm and/or control that?\n\nA: I have the same monitor and running MacOS Catalina 10.15.4. I believe a DVI cable (DVI-to-TB3: https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HLR62ZM/A/moshi-usb-c-to-displayport-cable) would get you higher res options + 75Hz refresh rate. Failing that, try using SwitchResX (https://www.madrau.com/) to expose some other display options.\n\n\nA: I ended up trying SwitchResX and gfxCardStatus to see if I could control the situation. Setting the desired resolution in SwitchResX caused the OS to render at that resolution, and then downsample the result to the actual resolution being sent to the display, which was unchanged. This was untenable.\ngfxCardStatus would tell me when the system switched from integrated to discrete graphics, and having that information led me to believe that it was not related to my problem.\nThe Satechi USB-C hub began to glitch out on me -- sometimes, it would just not work. Other times, it would work except for the HDMI port. I was always annoyed by the fact that it required both ports on one side of the machine, and as such was fidgety to plug and unplug. I also didn't like that it hung off the side of the machine like a wart. I always worried that I would break it off.\nI ended up spending $250 on a CalDigit TS3+ hub. Since Thunderbolt 3 is capable of 40Gbps per port (USB-C is only capable of 10Gbps), I get double the bandwidth available to my connected accessories and only one port utilized. I only have to plug and unplug one regular connector with a wire, and the TS3+ sits behind the laptop, out of sight.\nA thing I learned while researching: pretty much all USB-C hubs use the same chipset. It's cheap, and it's not great. I don't know why another manufacturer hasn't swooped in with a better one. But there's no such problem with Thunderbolt. The devices cost more, but they work so much better. \nWith the TS3+, I have had zero issues. To anyone wanting a dock-like arrangement for their Macbook Pro, where you sit down at a desk and connect multiple things, I wholeheartedly recommend the TS3+. You plug everything into that, and when you sit down at your desk you just plug in the one cable. Power, ethernet, numerous USB-A and USB-C devices, audio, a 4k-capable DisplayPort, and an additional Thunderbolt 3 port for daisy-chaining (with the right adapter, you can do another 4k monitor here). I couldn't ask for more!\n", "Q: Keyboard backlight not working for some keys Many similar questions I've read here have to do with backlights not working at all or when dimmed.\nMy problem is that the number 6 key is not illuminating.

Additionally, no suggestions are shown above/under the word as I am typing it so I cannot escape/cancel the autocorrection before it happens.\nThis question was actually frustrating to write, I found that the only way i could type 'grg' was by typing 'gtg'  first (notice the space), then left-arrowing to the 't', replacing it with an 'r', and then right-arrowing to the end (after the space) and typing the next word.\nCan I stop autocorrect from repeatedly correcting the same word even after I've re-typed it?\nLooks like this doesn't happen with dictionary words, for example I can type \"automatoc\", gets auto-corrected to \"automatic\", and then I can backspace \"ic\" and type \"oc\" and it will leave it as-is.\nMaybe this is a problem that only happens with learned spellings or so (I think I made macOS \"Learn spelling\" of gtg)\nI don't want to learn the spelling of words like 'grg', because ordinarily these kinds of autocorrections are helpful. However, in the rare situation I am trying to purposefully write such a word, I feel like me re-writing the word should be enough of a hint for the OS to realise what I am after.\n\nA: Right click to bring this menu and select Learn Spelling. \nAlternatively, you could set up a text replacement in Keyboard Preferences. \n\n\nA: Short of Learn Spelling or Ignore Spelling, neither of which you seem to want in this case, the oS is not smart enough to recognize what you are trying to do\n", "Q: Terminal does not change directory I am not being able to change directory in terminal and I don't understand why.\nThis is what I get:\nAnnes-MBP:~ anne$ /Applications \n-bash: /Applications: is a directory\nAnnes-MBP:~ anne$ cd/Applications \n-bash: cd/Applications: No such file or directory\nAnness-MBP:~ anne$ \n\n\nA: cd is the command, /Applications its parameter, and you need so separate commands and parameters by a space character.

Collected errors: Cannot find package openssh-server.\n  Check the spelling or perhaps run 'ipkg update'\n\n\nA: The reason your attempt fails is because the remote host (i.e. the router at mydomain.fqdn.com) doesn't allow you to forward the traffic through the SOCKS proxy. This is the meaning of the \"open failed: administratively prohibited\" message.\nIn order to fix this, you'll need to change the SSH configuration on the remote router at mydomain.fqdn.com. In case that system uses OpenSSH, you need to check that your sshd_config adheres to the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*AllowTCPForwarding must not be set to \"no\" (i.e. don't set it or set it to \"yes\")\n\n*PermitOpen must either not be set, set to \"any\" or set to allow the IP address of the \"www.whatismyip.com\" web site you're testing with.\nIf you're using SSH keys to authenticate, check that your authorized_keys file on the router does not have a \"no-port-forwarding\" limitation on your key, or that you have \"permitopen\" limitations that doesn't explicitly allow the IP address of the \"www.whatismyip.com\" web site. \nIf the remote router uses something else than OpenSSH to offer its SSH service, it might not support the TCP forwarding / SOCKS proxy feature at all. You'll want to check the documentation for the device to see if it does support the feature, and if so, how to enable it.\nUPDATE: You have updated your question to include information that indicates that you're using a \"homespun\" router using a variant of OpenWrt. In addition you specify that you have just the openssh-sftp-server package installed.\nThe solution is then to install the full OpenSSH, namely from the openssh-server package. You can do that with the following command on the router command line:\nipkg install openssh-server\n\n", "Q: Buying used Macbook Pro, checking if it's linked to previous owner If I buy a used Macbook Pro from 2015, how do I check if it is registered to the seller, i.e. linked to his AppleID?

First, you can use the chrome dev tools to simulate a non HiDPI (Retina Display) screen in the browser. Or you can use the EasyRes app to quickly switch the resolution of your entire display.\nSolution 1\nSteps to view websites as different devices on Google Chrome:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up desired page in Google Chrome and enable Developer Tools for the page ⌥+⌘+I \n\n*Click the device toolbar located in the upper left of the dev tools window ⌘+⇧+M \n\n*Click the type of device at the top toolbar and click on edit to add a new device to emulate \n\n*Now in your case you want to be able to emulate a non-retina display so would you add \"Laptop with MDPI screen\" to your list of emulated devices. If you wanted to emulate any other device add it from this list. Or for instance if you wanted to emulate a retina display you would choose \"Laptop with HiDPI screen.\" Note: If you want to switch quickly between both resolutions to compare add \"Laptop with HiDPI screen\" as well. \n\n*Close the emulated devices window and click on the current device chrome is emulating (on the left side of the toolbar above the webpage) and switch it to \"Laptop with MDPI screen\" \n\n*To get a better view of the webpage, undock the dev tools window into a separate window by clicking the menu options (the three vertical dots on the right side of the dev tools window) and the selecting the leftmost option for the \"Dock side.\" Or use this shortcut ⌘+⇧+D. This will pop out the dev tools into a separate window so you can view the whole page as if you were browsing normally  \n\n*Then your browser should look like this. You can also change the zoom options of the emulated webpage in the toolbar to better suit your needs. \nSolution 2\nhttp://easyresapp.com/\nLink to download EasyRes from Mac App Store.\nAlso, here is a link to a video demo of EasyRes\n\nA: You could use Affinity Designer, which has modes for working with regular resolutions and HiDPI screens. You can switch between them seamlessly. It even shows the aliasing occurring on regular resolutions, which is probably what you want to check for.\nOther than that, you’d have to attach a non-retina display to your Mac and just move everything there. It’s what some interaction designers do to check icons on different screens. However, if you have specific devices as targets, it’s better to use them, as screen resolutions and pixel density are very different from one screen to the other and different operating systems also apply different anti-aliasing algorithms.

I am only now switching to using Apple's Ecosystem for my music, and don't completely seem to understand some concepts. \nI have played around with using iTunes to bringing an existing CD collection onto iOS devices -- classical ripping to AAC seems to work fine. It is my understanding that I can also just import MP3 and AAC collections into my iTunes library and sync those to my iOS devices (essentially a one-way copying process).\nNow, iTunes Match offers three main features: \n\n\n*\n\n*Matching my local collection with Apple's, thus giving me (potentially) better encoding quality. \n\n*Making music available through the cloud, making it shareable with my family (which would otherwise be trivially replicated by putting music files into other peoples' iTunes collection).\n\n*Making storage management on iOS devices easier by pulling songs from the cloud only when needed.\n\n\nSo, do I understand this right? If so, is it fair to say that for a competent user (who knows how to create good-quality CD rips and how to copy files to another user's account), the only remaining selling point of iTunes Match is that an iOS device can automatically manage its music storage and save some space?\n\nA: To simplify when using iTunes Match, your phone or other device, connected to the internet, can play \"your\" music from Apple's Servers. Apple scans your physical music Library and then \"Matches\" the songs to songs they already have.\nThis means that if Apple has a song on their server that \"Matches\" a song in your physical Hard Drive music library then it can stream if from the Apple server to your other devices instead of streaming it from your actual computer cuz that would be rot with issues unless setup properly.\nThe caveat is... that if you have songs not on Apple's servers i.e., mixtapes, live recordings, rare CD's etc. Then Apple will upload those songs to it's Servers to stream to your other devices but there is a limitation. (read the fine print)\n\nNow, iTunes Match offers three main features:\nMatching my local collection with Apple's, thus giving me (potentially) better encoding quality.\n\nNo. (or yes) The quality of streaming from Apple Server is 256kb. That's not good quality and has nothing to do with your physical song library. (or yes) if you have really bad quality rips that are below 256kb (yuck)\n\nMaking music available through the cloud, making it shareable with my family (which would otherwise be trivially replicated by putting music files into other peoples' iTunes collection).\n\nCorrect! (kinda) Your family will have to use your Account either in iTunes or \"iTunes & App Stores\" (read the update at end of post) If you have a song in your library and it \"Matches\" a song Apple has on it's server or Apple Music library then your family can listen to that song streamed from Apple's Servers. Be careful though because music on the other devices is not actually \"yours\" it's Apple's and when you cancel your subscription that music will be deleted from any device that was not the original database (your mac with the real physical files)\n\nMaking storage management on iOS devices easier by pulling songs from the cloud only when needed.\n\nCorrect (in a sense) You are streaming the song not downloading it unless you choose to download the song.\nWith an iTunes Match subscription, iTunes matches your library, uploads any unmatched tracks (limited upload) and makes your music available on multiple devices through the iCloud Music Library. If you have low-quality tracks, iTunes Match “upgrades” them, allowing you to download 256 kbps AAC files without DRM. You can also download your files to any computer linked to your iTunes Match account, and listen to your music on any linked iOS device. iTunes Match has a limit of 25,000 tracks, not including iTunes Store purchases.\nHowever, there is one essential difference between iTunes Match and Apple Music. While iTunes Match lets you download your music files and then play them anywhere, Apple Music adds DRM to your files. This means that if you rip a CD, and it’s matched or uploaded to iCloud Music Library via Apple Music, and you download the files, say, on another Mac, you will only be able to play those files as long as your Apple Music subscription is active. If you delete your originals, or lose them, then you won’t be able to access files without DRM. As such, it is essential that you keep backups of your original files if you use Apple Music.\nIf you have both an iTunes Match subscription ($25 per year) and an Apple Music membership ($10 per month), then you get files without DRM.\nThe problem is that Apple is not making a distinction between Apple Music files that you download for offline listening—this is a key feature of Apple Music—and files that belong to you, which are matched or uploaded. In addition, there seem to be bugs right now, causing many previous matched files to show as Apple Music files, and to contain DRM when downloaded, even for users with iTunes Match subscriptions.\nUPDATE: As mentioned in the comments below I wanted to add that iTunes Match cannot be shared to other Apple/iTunes/iCloud ID's.  Unlike a \"Family\" Apple music subscription iTunes Match can only be associated with one Account. This does not mean that your \"family\" or other devices you and your family own cannot take advantage of your iTunes Match.  Those devices would just need to put in your Account info into iTunes or in \"iTunes and App Store\" (iOS).  On a computer this is not so bad as you can have iCloud syncing/backup/App Store separate from iTunes (not sure about the new iTunes in Catilina though)\nOn a mobile device your App Store would be linked to the iTunes Match account unfortunately.  So purchases on those mobile devices done by your family would be on just one account. Maybe not so bad but it kinda negates the family sharing aspect of iCloud only in the sense that you won't have separate App store accounts so everything everyone purchases will show up on the other devices unless you deselect \"Apps\" in \"iTunes & App Stores\" which would turn off syncing across all devices.  That's not so bad but if you have multiple iOS devices (iPhone,iPad,iPad mini) then you'd need to go into the App store on the device that did not literally download the App and then go into purchases or search for the App to manually download it to that device.  How you set this up is up to your and your family.\nThe draw back being that if your \"wife\" made a playlist on her iPhone then you would see that on your device and visa versa. If you wanted to get tricky you could create separate itunes libraries (Computer only) by holding down the shift key when opening iTunes. Then if you wanted, your family members could have their own iTunes minus your iTunes Match songs and just need to hold down the \"shift key\" when opening iTunes to select the Library they want to use.  Not a perfect solution but I just wanted to give you some real world examples that I hope you can use. ;)\n", "Q: Understanding Files on iOS / iPadOS: Accessing stored files iOS 13 and the new iPadOS offer the Files app as a Finder replacement. I do not quite understand the integration with the rest of the system, however.\nI have copied a set of image files into the \"On my iPad\" section in Files. They show up in Google Fotos (!) but not in other iOS apps where I would like to use them, eBay Classifieds in my case. \n\n\n*\n\n*How do I access files stored in the Files app from another app? \n\n*I understand that Files is no real file manager, like Finder, but rather an interface to several cloud services that also happens to provide app-internal storage (what is visible as \"on my iPad\"). Is that a correct view?\n\n*If so, how can I access arbitrary user files somewhere on my iPad? I'm fine with restrictions on system files, but content I have created should reside somewhere on the iPad's file system... is there a proper Finder replacement for mobile devices?\n\n\nA: \nHow do I access files stored in the Files app from another app?\n\nSome apps integrate with the Files app; these are called \"Document-Based Apps\" (according to Xcode). Apple's iWork apps and GarageBand are document-based apps, which means that you can open those apps and see your file system just like if you where in the Files app. It’s basically an exact replica of the Files app with some slight functionality changes.\n\nThere are also third-party apps, such as File Browser, that can access the same thing the Files app does, as well as other computers on your network.\n\nI understand that Files is no real file manager, like Finder, but rather an interface to several cloud services that also happens to provide app-internal storage (what is visible as \"on my iPad\"). Is that a correct view?\n\nSome apps aren't document-based apps, like the ones I mentioned above, but have folders in iCloud or on the device to store files. A few examples of these are iMovie, Swift Playgrounds, Reality Composer, etc. These apps will usually let you save files to the Files app via a share sheet or export button.\n\nThe Files app lets you view files on your device, in iCloud, on removable media, or a third-party server. If you have both a Mac and an iOS/iPadOS device with iCloud Drive enabled for Desktop and Documents folders, you can transfer files to and from your Mac via the cloud.\nOne cool thing I will mention is the Minecraft's use of the Files app. It has a folder on the device and is one of the only apps I have seen so far where you can modify parts of the game by changing some of the files inside it. For example, you can replace a world's icon by replacing the file it's using in the Files app.\n\n[H]ow can I access arbitrary user files somewhere on my iPad? I'm fine with restrictions on system files, but content I have created should reside somewhere on the iPad's file system... is there a proper Finder replacement for mobile devices?\n\nIf you save something to your device in the Files app, it should be there. I have a Pages document and an image on my device. I can go to Files and view the image, or open the Pages document, just like you can in Finder.\nI will say this; there seems to be a bug (I think) in iPadOS that won't show some on-device folders. Hopefully, they will fix it soon. Right now, you can save files in the root of \"on your device,\" and you shouldn't have any issues viewing them.\n", "Q: Can the new 2019 16-inch Macbook Pro support 8K resolution? The Tech Specs site says the laptop simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and:\nUp to two displays with 6016‑by‑3384 resolution at 60Hz at over a billion colors\nUp to four displays with 4096‑by‑2304 resolution at 60Hz at over a billion colors\nSince four 4K displays can be supported, I am assuming one 8K display can be supported. But I'm wondering if this can be done using one cable. The laptop supports two 6K displays, but this requires two cables, one for each display. Does this mean 8K resolution through one cable is impossible?\n\nA: You cannot just assume that an 8K display can be supported just because it supports 4 x 4k displays - it doesn't work that way, I'm afraid.\nAs far as I know, no 8k monitors with a single cable solution exists today. That would require DisplayPort 2.0, which is coming with monitors next year. \nSo yes, at the moment 8k resolution through one cable is impossible.\n", "Q: Catalina: /usr/sbin/accept command not found I have an applescript with code below that had been working until Catalina 10.15 update, gives command not found error:\ndo shell script \"sudo /usr/sbin/accept '2nd-flr-Library-rm228'\" with administrator privileges\n\nLooked at /usr/sbin/ and accept is not in the directory.

Apple just announced their much expected 16\" MBP, which still features DDR4 memory in order to be able to support more than 16GB RAM. I find that a bit disappointing, and am a bit puzzled as to why we still haven't seen a shift to low-power memory on macbooks. \nIf my understanding is correct, Intel's newer CPUs should in theory support LPDDR4x memory, and that these should provide significant improvements in terms of power usage. \nCould someone explain what is the bottleneck in the wider adoption of this technology?\n\nA: The actual \"bottleneck\" here is the fact that your \"theory\" is incorrect. \nThe Intel CPUs used do not support LPDDR4 memory at all. It won't work no matter what you do. They support only DDR4 and LPDDR3 RAM. Only the 10th gen Intel mobile processors support LPDDR4 - and the new MacBook Pro has a 9th gen CPU.\nThe 10th gen Intel mobile processors have been announced and some models have just recently launched - they support the new LPDDR4 RAM, which is almost the only new feature.

I noticed today that Finder has some strange logic of sorting files by name and I cannot figure out why is that.\nScreenshot 1 - folder in \"column\" view with folder's options opened:\n\nScreenshot 2 - same folder in \"list\" view, sorted by \"Name\" column:\n\nScreenshot 3 - output of ls -al command in terminal, correct and expected file sorting:\n\nEDIT:\nI created a testing folder with integer file names only and the behaviour is the same.\nFinder:\n\nTerminal:\n\nHow can I change Finder to use the same logic like ls command?\nUnfortunately, linked duplicate question doesn't answer my question above, only explains Finder's logic and behaviour in sorting files. What I would like to achieve, as stated in title and the question above, is to force Finder to sort files in alphabetical, not \"natural\" order.\n\nA: Apple's Finder has been using \"natural\" sort order (where strings of digits are ordered as single characters) for file names for nearly 20 years, since OS X 10.0  There's no way to change it as far as I know.  If you want the other kind of sort order, you have to use Terminal or a 3rd party app.\n\nA: Essentially, Finder is treating the numbers up to the first letter as its sort criterion.\nSo, as far as Finder is concerned, the order is 'correct' for  \n\n\n*\n\n*0\n\n*2\n\n*6\n\n*298\n\n*2655522\n\n\nIt is not considering the entirety of the name as a hexadecimal figure.\nBased on your edit - terminal is 'wrong' - 6 is smaller than 2655522  \nIt's still down to \"if you want a computer to sort 'properly' give it leading zeroes\".\nI also made a test folder - the logic is perhaps awkward, but it is actually logical, for a given definition.\n\nI think what Terminal is doing is sorting numbers like they were letters, so like e would sort after aabbaccd so 6 sorts after 2655522\n\nA: Maybe you might not know this but there is another button in your toolbar that also sorts your files and sometimes overrides or conflicts with the \"Finder\" preference setting you have.

TL;DR: My late 2012 Mac mini died (corrupt EFI) upgrading from Mojave to Catalina, I want to use a mid 2011 Mac mini with the hard drives and RAM out of my dead mini.  Is this possible?\nDrawing on this SO question.  It appears that it can.  I've also compared the two on EveryMac and it appears possible, except for the OS difference.  EDIT: I just read through the specs again, and it appears the memory may be a problem, the 2012 is 1600 MHz minimum, and the 2011 is 1333 MHz, I'll need to look into that further.\nMy plan is to find a used 2011 Mac Mini server and use it as a host for the two drives (1tb Crucial boot, 1tb Seagate SSHD backup) I have in my dead 2012 plus the 16gb of RAM I have in it.  I have multiple backups on the drives, both Carbon Copy Cloner & Time Machine, so I should be able to get to a bootable state.  I also have a Win10 VM on Parallels that I'd really like to be able to use again.\nFor some reason the 2011 servers are about half the price of a used 2012 mini and since I really only need the logic board I don't see why I should pay more than necessary for an older machine, plus with the 2011 mini, I get a faster processor, and an extra monitor.\nIf this isn't possible, I'm willing to purchase another used late 2012 Mini as a host for the drives & RAM, just don't want to spend more money than I have to to recover the machine.\n\nA: Your Mac mini 2012 supports OS X 10.8.1 up to the current macOS (10.15.1 at the time of writing). The Mac mini 2011 officially supports OS X 10.7 up to macOS 10.13.6 (High Sierra).\nAfter upgrading your Mac mini 2012 to 10.14 (Mojave) and further trying to upgrade to 10.15 (Catalina), the Mac mini 2011 won't boot with this system disk.\n\nThe Catalina installer can be patched to run on some officially unsupported Macs and install the latest system.\nThe Mac mini 2011 (Macmini5,2) is on this list of (patch-)compatible Macs (with the restriction: ...systems with AMD Radeon HD 6xxx series GPUs will be almost unusable when running Catalina.).

To be on the safe side, I know I will be doing a Windows Bootcamp because there are some programs in my field that don't have a Mac-specific version out yet.\nBut for, say developers, are there any reasons behind having Linux Bootcamp on your Mac? \nOr are the Terminal apps identical in all respects? For command-line users. In that case it might be completely superfluous. Right?\n\nA: \"Terminal\"-apps on macOS (I put that in quotes because technically they haven't got anything to do with Terminal.app, but merely being command line programs) are not in general identical to macOS apps. However most are very similar. \nThis stems from the fact that macOS can trace many of its standard command line tools to FreeBSD whereas Linux inherits them from GNU. In practical terms, you'll quickly learn the minor differences between the two. It is also possible to install the actual GNU command line tools on macOS using HomeBrew, and then they are identical.\nDoes this mean that there are no reasons at all for running Linux in BootCamp? - No, not really. There's still advantages to BootCamp when you for example want to run some performance demanding games, when you want to use Linux specific device drivers for built-in hardware, and other things. BootCamp essentially takes over the whole computer - leaving none of macOS running. \nHowever just the fact that you want to run a program that doesn't have a Mac-specific version doesn't mean that you have to run BootCamp - no matter if it is Windows or Linux. In those cases, many use virtualization to keep running the macOS desktop while running some apps in Windows or Linux at the same time in seperate windows. For example you can use VMware Fusion, Parallels Desktop or the free VirtualBox to run Windows/Linux on top of macOS.\n", "Q: Disable F3 and F4 shortcuts I'd like to use my F3 and F4 keys for a different purpose, but I can't seem to disable the hotkeys on my Mac.

We do this to minimize traffic to our users' devices when new updates are released, (we prefer they use their own home networks,) and more importantly, to keep our carted iPad fleet from updating until we have tested updates against installed apps, etc.\nAt one point, our AppleTVs were also blocked from tvOS updates through the same method, but with tvOS 13 and Apple TV4s, it seems as if new servers are in use which are not blocked and the ATV4s are being updated. We use our ATVs for AirPlay Conference Room display mode with PIN only. I realize now that I can turn off automatic updating, but it doesn't help at the moment.\nThis is a roadblock for us because after the update is done, the ATV requires clicking a Continue button on a What's New screen with a remote. Until this button is pressed, AirPlay Conference Room mode is unavailable: the ATV does not appear in the list of AirPlay devices on a macOS or iOS device. From early experiences with missing (stolen) ATV  remotes, we do not provide a remote in any ATV location. This means I must go around to every ATV4 (and we have many of them) just to click a button to make it useful.\nCan anybody please either let me know what the new tvOS Update server addresses might be, or point me in the right direction? I've done a fair amount of searching, but have found nothing definitive.\nAdditional information 12/11/2019:\nEven though I manually disabled auto-update on the ATV4s, with the release of 13.3 yesterday, the ATV4 pops up a notice that an update is available, necessitating yet another remote button click to make the device useable. \nThe need to find the tvOS update server is now even more crucial than ever.\n\nA: I would recommend three steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up two caching servers per 1,000 devices you have on your network.

If not, which it appears you can't, you may have to contact Apple Support.\nEdit:\n\nApple told me that if the author has made any edits to the book, they change the serial number and they won't allow you to re-download-even though I purchased the book!\n\nThe only thing I could come up with that made any sense is that you can't update content in iTunes. Music, Books, TV Shows, etc. are usually never changed when they are published. If the author of these audiobooks made some changes to it, they would probably have to submit a new book. This happened to me once when a music artist added a few songs to their album.

Is it possible to create an AFPS volume as an ordinary file in other filesystem?

This can be done via the command line with a command such as:\ndiskutil apfs create disk5 MyNewVolumeName\n\nwhere disk5 needs to be replaced with the device name, you've received from the attach command earlier.\n\nA: You can use the Disk Utility application or a combination of the hdiutil and diskutil commands. The files can be either full images (.dmg) or sparse images (.sparseimage). You can also create a sparse bundle which is actually a folder (.sparsebundle) containing files.

Here's my workflow for getting photos into those libraries:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take photos and videos with my iPhone XS Max.\n\n*Wait for them to appear in my system library through iCloud sync.\n\n*Export them to a folder using File > Export > Export Unmodified\nOriginal... with Export IPTC as XMP checked.\n\n*Open the destination Photos library.\n\n*Drag the exported folder onto \"Photos\" under \"Library\" in the sidebar to import its contents.\n\n\nThis worked fine up until Catalina. Export still seems to work fine, and import works fine for images, but it no longer works for videos. Now when I drag my exported folder into Photos it imports the images, but gives the following error message for each video:\n\n** Invalid: Unsupported resource set: video,xmp **\n\n\nThis only appears for videos that are pure video. Live Photos with a video component import fine.\nThe videos are all HEVC in a .mov container, recorded on an iPhone with iOS 13, synced with iCloud, and exported from Photos in Catalina, so they are definitely not an incompatible or older codec.\nI can import the videos by themselves, without the .xmp files. They appear to have all their metadata intact, so maybe the .xmp files are no longer necessary.\nAnybody know why this is no longer working?\n\nA: macOS 10.15 (Catalina) has removed support for a number of things, the old Quicktime Pro no longer works (unfortunate as it is a nice, simple, movie editor) and (among other things) support for older codec movie files.\nIt is likely that those files that won't import are in a (now) unsupported format.\nI would recommend just re-encoding them into a modern format like H264. Handbrake is what I use for such tasks. it is free and open source, updated regularly and highly recommended.\n\nA: Today I was moving photos and videos between photo libraries in macOS 10.15 (Catalina) too! I encountered the exact same issue: I exported the original with ITPC extracted as XMP, and when I import them into another library the exact same error messages were given.\nSolution:\nDON'T export ITPC when you move media between macOS Photos Libraries\nWait why? I care about the metadata!\nThe ITPC info is part of the photo/video themselves! You only need to export them as standalone XMP files if you want to feed them into another application.\n", "Q: Screen wake - go to home screen The apple watch has \"On screen wake show last app\" with a time limit that means if the watch is unused for a period of time, go back to watch mode.  \nI've found this so useful in avoiding distractions that I'd like to find out if iOS has something similar.\nI want it to go to the first page of the home screen if it's been inactive (asleep) for more than a few minutes.\nIs there a way to do that?\nI recognize that a quick swipe from the bottom will do this, but my problem is getting distracted with what I was working on awhile ago when my desire is to check my calendar, email, or something else.  I'd prefer the phone to handle it for me.\n\nA: Unfortunately, this is not currently possible as a setting on iPhone.

It's running iOS 13.0 (17A577), so presumably it hasn't ever had a software update.\nWhen my friend tries to update iOS to the current version (13.2.2), the \"Verifying update...\" dialog appears for a while, then the \nA dialog then appears, saying:\n\nUnable to Install Update\nAn error occurred installing iOS 13.2.2\nRetry\nRemind me later\n\nRetrying ends up with the same result.\niOS 13 has various fairly serious bugs, including super-slow tap responsiveness (several seconds passing before taps on the screen register).\nIs there any way to get past this error and get my friend's iOS updated?\n\nA: In my experience, when unable to update on the device itself due to an error, I use Apple Configurator 2 on macOS to install the update.\nWhen Apple Configurator 2 is installed, the process is pretty simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Apple Configurator 2.\n\n*Plug your iPhone in via USB.\n\n*Unlock your iPhone. You may need to trust the computer if this is the first time you've connected to it.\n\n*Your iPhone will now show up in Apple Configurator 2.\n\n*Right-click your device and select Update...\n\n*Your computer will now check your iPhone to see if there are any app updates and iOS updates.\n\n*If there is a new version of iOS available, follow the prompts to install.\n\n\nIf this fails, there could be an issue with the update itself or your iPhone, which may warrant resetting the device.\n", "Q: How can I set up a system-wide key combination to toggle a specific System Preferences setting (\"Tap to Click\")? I want to be able to toggle the \"Tap to Click\" setting under \"Trackpad\" > \"Point & Click\" in the System Settings app with a key combination from within any application. \nI looked at \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\", but the options here look pretty limited. \"App Shortcuts\" seem to be the closest thing -- it appears you can bind a key to an option in pull-down menus on the top menu bar, but if there's a way to bind a key to a toggle in the System Settings app pane, it's not clear to me. \nPerhaps this is something that's better done by AppleScript (or system-hooked JavaScript)? Or triggering a command-line option? \n\nA: Since you didn't say what version of macOS you are running, here is the AppleScript code I'd use to toggle the target checkbox under macOS High Sierra. It may need to be modified for macOS Mojave and later.\nAlso note that when assigning a global keyboard shortcut, it can not be one already assigned to any app that has focus when the keyboard shortcut is pressed.\nYou can use this code in a Run AppleScript action in an Automator Service.1\n\n\n*\n\n*1 In macOS Mojave, and later, an Automator Service is called a Quick Action. There are also other minor nomenclature differences but they should be more obvious when comparing them to pre-macOS Mojave Automator workflows.\nThe keyboard shortcut can be assigned in: System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services\nExample AppleScript code: \nif running of application \"System Preferences\" then\n    try\n        tell application \"System Preferences\" to quit\n    on error\n        do shell script \"killall 'System Preferences'\"\n    end try\nend if\n\nrepeat while running of application \"System Preferences\" is true\n    delay 0.1\nend repeat\n\ntell application \"System Preferences\" to ¬\n    reveal pane id \"com.apple.preference.trackpad\"\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell application process \"System Preferences\"\n    repeat while not (exists window \"Trackpad\")\n        delay 0.1\n    end repeat\n    tell tab group 1 of window \"Trackpad\"\n        click radio button \"Point & Click\"\n        repeat while value of radio button \"Point & Click\" is equal to 0\n            delay 0.01\n        end repeat\n        click checkbox 3\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nquit application \"System Preferences\"\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate.

I.e. I get these can't be changed because they are in use errors, when trying to access any file, but non-finder apps access them fine, although say cp preserves attributes while copying, so attribute hell spreads like virus by copying.\nHow do I just delete all attributes at once? Instead of doing xattr -d com.apple.FinderInfo file.ext for each file? Is there some hidden folder where OSX stores metadata? Because Neither FAT or NTFS support the OSX's metadata streams.\n\nA: rm ._* does the trick for FAT, which has attributes are stored in these ._ prefixed files, but doesn't work for NTFS, which embeds them into filesystem.\n\nA: The xattr way is probably the only way that works. To bulk change, you can use the find command along with it:\nfind . -iname \"*\" -exec xattr -d com.apple.FinderInfo {} \\;\n\nThis calls the command for every file recursively from the current folder upwards. To use another folder, just exchange . for the path you want. Also, this does not change hidden files. You’d need to use -iname \".*\" instead of -iname \"*\" for that.\n", "Q: Archival style backup software or online service I have some folders that I need constantly backed up.\nI need to have the backup in archival mode where nothing is ever deleted. That is, new files are backed up, backed up files are never deleted, and updated files don't replace backed up files.\nThe folders contain financial records which need to always be kept.\nI've tried Google Drive with the backup app, however, this keeps it in sync.\nI've tried Time Machine, however, old files are deleted once the drive is full.\nI need something like Google Vault. Where once files are added, they are retained forever. I don't use Google Vault as it requires a Google Suite account and i'm just on a personal Google account.\nCan you recommend a software that can do this? Or a online service is fine as well.\n\nA: I believe you can do this with Time Machine. You could set Time Machine to do a backup hourly or daily. Then tell time machine to only backup the specific folders with the data you want to backup. Time machine saves all backups until the drive you are saving to is full. The backups should be very small so a disk will hold a lot of daily backups. You can monitor the remaining free space on your destination drive and get a new disk when the one you are using is almost full. \nThe real trick could be restoring a backup. I think restoring may replace current data. You could test this out using hourly backups to see how it works. After a couple of hours, try to restore and see what happens.\nThere is a 3rd party free app called TimeMachineEditor that will enable you to change the backup interval from every hour to different intervals in hours, days or weeks. \n", "Q: Rule that applies to mails containing Outlook invitations I am using the Mail app for my work Exchange account.

The data on your device is, as you know, permanently encrypted. And is decrypted, when in use, partially by using your lock code. As far as I know, and I am fairly certain of this, there is no known mechanism for decrypting the data off-device, and you cannot move the data off device either because there is no way to move the data off while in DFU mode. And they do not provide any way to decrypt the data using the lock code in any other cicumstances than what happens in a full normal boot.\nSo, in DFU mode, there is no way to decrypt the data on-device, and no mechanism for moving the data off-device.\n", "Q: Little Snitch uninstalled properly but Little Snitch Helper still here Long time ago, I uninstalled Little Snitch with the built-in uninstaller. \nI also ran CleanMyMac and checked all possible leftovers on Hard Disk: /Library and inside Home Folder: /Library such as :\n\n\n*\n\n*/Library/Caches\n\n*/Library/Preferences\n\n*/Library/Application Support\n\n*/Library/LaunchAgents\n\n*/Library/LaunchDaemons\n\n*/Library/PreferencePanes\n\n*/Library/StartupItems\n\n\nBut today I spotted a remaining of Little Snitch in setting > Privacy > Location : Little Snitch Helper.\nIf I right-click on it and do open in finder nothing appear and I'm not able to find it !\nHow can I get ride of it ?\n\nA: Little Snitch Helper is installed in /Library/Little Snitch/Little Snitch Helper.app. But I assume that it properly deinstalled, the only thing remaining is the entry you are looking at which was required to give the application access to location data. \nI just tried with some other \"old\" entries, you should be able to remove it by just unticking the entry (if it already is unticked, tick it first and then untick it again).\n\nA: I would recommend using third party software named Funter, which is an absolutely free.

I am planning to use my new 16\" MacBook Pro with an external display which is equipped with a USB-C output. I use the setup generally in extended display mode, and sometimes in clamshell mode.\nI am planning to use a single, USB-C 3.1 cable to both drive the display and keep the MacBook connected to power. I'll be actively using the machine while it's connected.\nMy questions is, since the new 16\" MacBook is equipped with a larger battery (100-Wh), and comes with a denser power brick (96 Watt), will the output from the monitor be adequate to charge the MacBook? If it depends on the monitor type, how do I determine if the output would be adequate?\n\nA: It depends entirely on the monitor type. Some monitors support power delivery, some do not. You'll obviously want one that does support power delivery.\nNext comes the rated power - it differs from monitor to monitor how many watts of power they can delivery over the cable. The size of the battery in the laptop doesn't matter here - the only thing that matters is that the monitor can deliver more watts than the laptop uses on average while connected. If it can deliver more, those watts are used to keep the battery charged. Ofcourse - the larger the difference (up to a point), the faster the charging will happen.\nHow many watts your laptop is using on average depend on your usage. I.e. if you run it almost idle, only checking mail a few times per day - it won't use much. If you're running complex 3D renders all the time - you'll use a lot.\nIf your monitor supports power delivery with a wattage around the 96W that the included power brick gives - then you should be OK. Note that the standard currently has a limit of 100W, so you can never go above that. For most people 85W is plenty, and for many less can also be good enough.\n", "Q: How to prevent displaying the total sum of A + B if columns A + B are empty I have inserted a running total formula in my numbers sheet.\nIt sums the total of Column H, which works fine.\nHowever when cells in columns H are empty it will display the last sum, which I do not want.\nHow can I prevent displaying the last sum when Column A and B are empty?\n\n\n\nA: You can extend the formula to check whether the value in the column to the left is empty or not:\n=if(j3>0;sum(h$2:h3);\"\")\n\n", "Q: How many 1080p Monitors i can connect to MacBook pro 13 inch 2019 model with 4 thunderbolt port?

As with any instance of an AppleScript element that has already been created, it'll typically be referenced either by index, e.g.\nreceipt 1 of ...\n\nor by name, e.g.\nreceipt \"MyNamedReceipt\" of ...\n\nor by id, e.g.\nreceipt id \"61405882-ee27-4c94-86bb-bcdecc8792ba\" of ...\n\nMy feeling is that the add command will act on an instance of a library item (including receipt) that already exists.  If so, then\nadd receipt ...\n\nwould most likely generate the error you're seeing, because receipt is a class name, where add would be expecting an identifiable element, e.g.\nadd receipt \"MyNamedReceipt\" ...\n\nGoing by typical nomenclature in the AppleScript world, add commands typically get invoked when one wishes to take a pre-existing object from one location and insert/add it to another.  In Paperless, this might be taking a receipt from, say, a folder (or album) of receipts, and adding either a copy of or a reference to (most likely the latter) that receipt to a different folder/album.\nThe most common way to create new instances of an element in the majority of AppleScriptable applications is by way of the make command (which is part of the standard suite that an application's scripting dictionary is recommended to contain):\n\nmake v : Make a new object.\n      make\n          new type : The class of the new object.\n          [at location specifier] : The location at which to insert the object.\n          [with data any] : The initial data for the object.\n          [with properties record] : The initial values for properties of the object.\n      → specifier\n\nIf Paperless includes the make command, try using that.  It would take a form similar to:\nmake new receipt with properties {name:\"My Receipt\", merchant:\"Apple\", amount:\"$249.99\", tax:\"$0.00\"}\n\nYou will need to consider which element owns the collection of receipts in which you're attempting to create a new one.  If library item is a top-level application object, i.e. owned by application, then the make command should not require the at parameter (if it does, it can be a generic at end of receipts).  However, if library item is owned by, say, a library class object, then the make command either needs to occur within tell block targeting that library element (e.g. library 1, or library \"MyLibrary\"); or it needs the at parameter to describe where to create the new receipt, e.g.\ntell application \"Paperless\"\n        .\n        .\n        .\n    make new receipt at library 1 of document 1\n        .\n        .\n        .\nend tell\n\nwhere, for illustrative purposes, I've pre-supposed that library items are contained by libraries are contained by documents are contained by the application.\n", "Q: Is AFP of any value to non-ancient devices? From one person’s tests, SMBv3 is just a hair faster than AFP.\nAll of the Macs, iPads, and iPhones in our house capable of reading disks are Apple devices that support SMBv3.  We have no devices capable of AFP.\nFile sharing allows SMB or “SMB and AFP.”  Is there any benefit to enabling AFP?\nI am more accustomed to NFS, but speed of disk access is worth switching over.\n\nA: I personally use SFTP on my home network rather than SMB or NFS, as that allows you to access POSIX file permissions, whereas the others do not. This is a feature offered by AFP, too.\nmacOS requires POSIX file permissions on users' home directories, so if you plan on having those accessed via the network, SMB is not an option.\nHaving said that, Apple appears to be phasing out AFP, with no support for APFS volumes (at least not yet). I'd personally stick to just using SMB unless your needs dictate otherwise, in which case, SFTP may be a better choice than AFP simply for its cross-platform support and not being proprietary (though Netatalk provides an AFP solution for Linux).\n", "Q: How to listen to iMac G3 audio files with no extension on a recent device?

They can also have no extension.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_audio_format\nSo you can rename one of the files to add the extensions like \n\n\n*\n\n*\n.raw files can really contain anything, the extension really provides no clue.\n\n\n*\n.sam files are by far the most common raw file one can encounter, these are 8-bit signed PCM. They were employed extensively along with EA IFF 8SVX files as samples in Amiga tracker software.\n\n\n*\n.pcm files might provide a clue that the file contains linear PCM, as opposed to encodings such as the various types of delta and companding encodings and compressed streams, this could still be any bit depth and ordering.\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20160525083851/http://www.fmtz.com/misc/raw-audio-file-formats\nOther than that, use some audio software like Audacity which  supports importing raw formats.\n\nThe two most common uncompressed file types you will encounter are WAV and AIFF.\n\nhttps://manual.audacityteam.org/man/importing_audio.html\n", "Q: Moving an SSD from a MBP 2014 to a 2015 If I want to transfer a 256 SSD with everything on it (OS Catalina) from a mid 2014 Macbook Pro 13\" to an early 2015 Macbook Pro 13\", will it work?\nOr should I reinstall it?\n\nA: In short, yes, but there is a caveat. The SSD sticks are transferrable between those two models, no problem.\nWhat you have to be aware of is that as part of any major, and sometimes minor, macOS update, the firmware is also updated. This update, which can be important to have a specific OS version work well on any Mac, obviously does not get applied to the Mac you are transferring the SSD to, just by transferring the SSD.\nYou must therefore be sure that the Mac you are putting the SSD into either already has the latest firmware, or you must apply it first by running the installation for the version of macOS that is on the SSD you are transferring, on that Mac. You do not have to actually install it on the main internal drive, it is sufficient to in some way do the installation on the Mac in question, for instance by attaching an exteranl hard drive or big enough USB stick, and installing Catalina on that.\nOnce you have made sure about the firmware, you should be able to transfer the SSD and it will boot. On first boot after the transfer, you might want to hold down the CMD-ALT-P-R key combo so that the NVRAM is flushed and it defaults to boot from the new internal SSD, instead of first looking for the old one.\n", "Q: How to resolve messed up GPT (FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF) from Ubuntu without data loss I was having Ubuntu installed along with MacOS Catalina.

Your local Apple Store can help diagnose this (they have a more thorough in-house hardware test OS that isn't publicly available), but I'd place my bets on cable failure, given your symptoms and how failure-prone they are known to be.\nIf it's just the cable, they can replace it for you (typically £100 for parts and labour), or you can get the part and tools for around £15 and replace it yourself if you have the time and patience. If it's the hard drive itself, you'll obviously need to replace it, and your data is likely lost — in this situation, don't attempt to recover the data yourself; you'll do more harm than good. Instead, consult a data recovery specialist if you desperately need the data and don't have a backup.\nTo attempt some better diagnostics at home, make a bootable Ubuntu USB and see if that detects your drive. I've had some luck in the past with that, in situations where a SATA cable has failed sufficiently that the Mac EFI and macOS (including Recovery) refuse to show it, but Linux will do its best to provide info. When in Ubuntu, open the Disks app to see if your drive is detected. If it is, check the SMART report (select the disk in the left sidebar, click the three-line icon in the upper-right, click \"SMART Data & Self-Tests...\") If all is reported good, the cable is almost certainly the issue.\nP.S. \"obviously I can’t repair a disk that doesn’t appear in [Disk Utility]\" — Likewise, you cannot use fsck to check a filesystem that the OS cannot see, hence why it says everything is fine.\n", "Q: How to show presentations on a standalone billboard using Apple TV?

Before updating to Catalina, the screen time tracked the total time a user was logged in with his/her credentials, regardless of what apps they used or games were played. After the update, it tracks some individual apps.\nThe problem is that screen time is not tracking for example the time used for java apps. E.g with Minecraft, only the Minecraft launcher is tracked but not the game itself which runs java.\nIs there any way to enable the screen time to track the usage of the java apps and/or total login time? Total logged-in time matches with Finder usage time, but open can not add Finder to the list of tracked apps.\nThe question is, is it possible to add java or Finder to the list of the apps tracked by screen time?\nAn alternative solution may be third-party software, but those I haven't yet looked for.\n\nA: You can refer to this StackOverflow thread where they instruct on how to package the jars into an .app for Mac, that might do the trick:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/11037693/convert-java-application-to-mac-os-x-app\n", "Q: How to launch the onscreen Accessibility Keyboard with a keyboard shortcut too?

Right now I download the app separately on each device using the same Apple Id, so when I update something in the app from one device, the update is present in the instance of the app on the other devices. Is there a better way to do this?\n\nA: Enabling automatic App Store downloads on all devices solves this issue for devices that use the same AppleID for App Store. \n\n\n*\n\n*macOS this is in the preferences for the App Store App\n\n*iOS this is in the settings app under Apple ID > iTunes & App Store\n\n\nThe general case is solved only when you package and script app installs with an MDM framework like JAMF Now. It’s a lot of work to start packaging your apps or manage installers, so most groups don’t fully manage all apps until they have 50 to 100 Macs, but the technology is there to do this on macOS and iOS.

I literally have 0 tabs open, and yet Chrome is consuming a very significant amount of CPU resources, and quickly draining my battery...\nWhy?\n\n\n\nA: Why - because it's got a bug or loop and can't tell you it's stuck in human terms.\nSo, you'll need to look at the guts of the program or get someone to help get to why in your case the software wants to eat all your battery.\nIn activity monitor, first select chrome and run System Diagnostics.... Then go make a cup of tea. When you get back, click Sample Process while you highlighted the selected chrome item and look over the sample results. \n\nBased on where it spends time, you’ll need to triage things. I recommend people start by filtering the sample as Percent of Thread so you can see where the busy parts of the code are and hide the fames the drop from a high percentage of time to a low percentage of time.\n\nThe alternative, is just triage and remove things chrome could do.

If an iMac has both cat-5 and WiFi connections to the world, will MacOS use them both to optimize the overall speed?  Or pick only the fastest for everything (since the ISP side of the modem is slower than Cat-5 anyway).\nIf yes, in what older version (if any) was this not true?\nThis is NOT a duplicate of any question that has two ISPs.\nAll devices are connected WiFi to an AirPort Extreme.  One of them is also connected by Cat-5.  I am not currently using USB or Thunderbolt or FireWire.  The Cat-5 obviously has a different IP address than the WiFi.  The Airport goes through a Motorola DOCSIS to the world.  Ookla says the wired connection downloads at 79+ MBps and the WiFi at 50+ MBps.\nAlso, I wasn't thinking so much of link aggregation, but like letting one app use the wire and another WiFi, giving each app more bandwidth than if they had to shared the same interface hardware.\n\nA: No, macOS assigns one route to a network. You’ll need to set up link aggregation which does extremely effective splitting if you can’t have a router that selects egress efficiently and you route all your traffic to that router. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_aggregation\n", "Q: iPhone 6 - Dictation mispelled When using dictation, I can't make it spell my wife's first and our last names correctly.

Then open up an email message and start dictating, saying things like:\n\"Rindy is my wife period.\"\n\"Rindy is a person period.\"\n\"I am meeting with Rindy today.\"\n\"Where is Rindy questionmark\"\nEach time the computer misspells Rindy's name, go back and correct it. Eventually you will show the computer whose boss, and it will start to spell Rindy's name properly. (Really: there appears to be an algorithm that looks at spelling corrections and uses this as feedback on dictation.)\n", "Q: Why am I getting Universal Clipboard popups when I'm not typing anything? I was just in the Weather Underground iOS app on my iPhone.  I was not inputting text, I had just opened the app so it was showing me weather conditions for my current location.  After the app finished loading all the weather info, I got the \"Pasting from [my MacBook's name]\" dialog that I usually see when I'm trying to paste something I copied on my MacBook.  I believe this dialog is part of Handoff/Universal Clipboard.\nTo reiterate, I wasn't inputting text in the Weather Underground app.  I was not pasting.\nDoes this dialog mean that the Weather Underground app read my clipboard?  Or is there some other explanation for why I would get this dialog when I'm not obviously trying to paste?\nPerhaps I'm a bit late to the party here, but I am suddenly concerned about the privacy of my clipboard in iOS apps, particularly when that clipboard might actually be coming from my MacBook.  And weather apps are no stranger to privacy problems.\n\nA: You are likely correct. If you get a UI that says that the system is \"Pasting from [my MacBook's Name]\", then this likely means that the application in the foreground of your iPhone is reading from the universal clipboard.  It is unlikely that it is being read by another program in the background. So it is likely that Weather Underground is attempting to read from the Clipboard.\nSee:\n* https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/copy-and-paste-between-devices-mchl70368996/mac\nMy suggestion is that you test by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Repeatedly copy something on your macbook, kill the Weather app, then exercise the weather app. \n\n*Take your Macbook off the network and repeatedly run and kill the Weather app.\n\n", "Q: Incredibly slow user interface and incredibly high disk writes My late-2013 Macbook Pro 13\" has been increasingly laggy and slow for the last several months. Replacing the SSD helped a little, but now it is beach-balling even opening a single new tab. Overall CPU usage is low (mostly WindowServer) but I was alarmed to see the amount of disk writes that kernel_task is doing (about 20GB per day).\nChecking with smartctl then showed that over the 4 months since I replaced the SSD, it has done over 70TB of writes! I have no idea what it could be writing. My usual apps are Google Chrome, Terminal, Preview (for pdfs) and TeXshop and background apps (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc). How can I figure out what is lagging everything/causing kernel_task to do so many writes?\n\nA: It's probably Dropbox or Google Drive. I've seen similar problems. Typically it's caused by Dropbox or Google Drive repeatedly downloading the same files over-and-over. They are both somewhat buggy programs.\nDo you have any symbolic links in either your Dropbox or Google Drive? Neither deal well with symlinks; Dropbox specifically does not support them. (See https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Files-folders/Symbolic-link-on-Mac/td-p/27496 and https://help.dropbox.com/installs-integrations/sync-uploads/symlinks).\nYou can find symbolic links from the Terminal with this command:\nfind $HOME -type -l -print\n\nor to see where it points:\nfind $HOME -type -l -ls\n\nYou can also run a program that monitors all writes to your hard drive by file, to diagnose the problem youself.

I've found plenty of posts of people complaining about the lack of support and drivers from Apple.\nPersonally I have not observed any of these issues, but now I wonder. I know for sure that I've been using the discrete GPU often (I track my energy usage), but maybe I've just not noticed the slowdowns.\nI've inspected the version of the Nvidia drivers (system report > software > extensions), and it says:\nGeForce:\n\n  Version:          12.0.24\n  Last Modified:    12/10/2018, 05:10\n  Bundle ID:        com.apple.GeForce\n  Notarised:        Yes\n  Loaded:           Yes\n  Get Info String:  GeForce 12.0.24 355.11.10.50.10.103\n  Obtained from:    Apple\n  Kind:             Intel\n  Architectures:    x86_64\n  64-Bit (Intel):   Yes\n  Location:         /System/Library/Extensions/GeForce.kext\n  Kext Version:     12.0.0\n  Load Address:     18446743521870100000\n  Loadable:         Yes\n  Dependencies:     Satisfied\n  Signed by:        Software Signing, Apple Code Signing Certification Authority, Apple Root CA\n\nThey seem to have been updated one year ago (with Mojave?), but that doesn't fit with what I've been reading about the total lack of support.\nDoes anyone know what's the current state of the game for my MacBook Pro model?\n\nA: What you've been reading about are the third party nVidia Web Drivers, which nVidia created (primarily) for Mac Pro users installing new graphics cards in their towers. The nVidia Web Drivers do not work in Mojave or newer, leaving users of those GPUs stuck on High Sierra.\nYour nVidia GPU is natively supported by Mac OS, and will continue to work in Mojave / Catalina.\n", "Q: Can't log in to Music/iTunes store on MacBook When Apple TV+ came out, I wasn't getting the one-year offer as I should have and got the advice from Apple's online chat to try just completely logging out and back into my Apple account. \nI logged out of the apps and iCloud in Settings, restarted, and logged back in, in Settings. Now I can't log back into Music, TV, or Podcasts (although Books and the App Store are just fine). I go to the Account menu → Sign In..., put in my username and password, and the login window disappears as if it's going to log in, but nothing happens in Music or TV. Podcasts actually says \"something went wrong during authentication (0)\". I don't get a two-factor authentication notice, and if I go back to the Account menu, it still says \"Sign In...\" instead of showing my account name and balance. Given the affected apps, it seems to be an issue with the iTunes store. Indeed, in Music I also (usually) can't get into the store - if I click on it, it may rarely work, but mostly it will just spin forever, or give me error 11556.\nInterestingly, making a test user, I can log in. I figure it has to be a plist or another setting that's been corrupted, but would be fresh on a new user. Going to the Library preferences, I deleted the iTunes store plist, and now I can see the Store, but still can't log in. \nWhat plist should control iTunes login? Or have an idea where other Apple Media Services files live? \nI would exhaust other options before a reinstall. \n\nA: I just got an email from the engineer I had spoken to on my last call to Apple Support and it turns out there were some server issues on their side. They asked me to try logging in again and lo, and behold, now it worked perfectly.\n", "Q: Part of Apple SSD not accessible after failed bootcamp attempt A couple of months back I tried installing windows through bootcamp on my system.

Or is this completely false?\nSorry I am a windows user.\n\nA: You should consider using an MDM solution for managing the enterprise devices.\nIf you simply hand out devices to users to set them up themselves, and they log in with their Apple ID, the devices remains associated with their Apple ID unless the user explicitly removes it or log out of it.\nThis may be cumbersome and difficult to manage. Using an MDM solution to centrally manage and pre-configure the devices for employees would be the recommended approach. The MDM solution also makes it possible and easy to manage usage policies.

I am using Windows on Bootcamp.\nThe hub works fine with a DisplayPort to VGA adaptor, but it doesn't work with a DisplayPort to HDMI adaptor or cable. I have tried the hub on both MacOS and Windows 10 but the external HDMI display detects power (an icon appears showing there is something connected) but does not detect any signal.\nI have updated the graphics drivers, reinstalled the USB C drivers and reinstalled Windows but nothing worked. The hub and HDMI display work with a HP laptop with similar Intel integrated graphics.\nDoes it not work because the DisplayPort to HDMI is passive?\n\nA: Yes, you'll need an active DisplayPort to HDMI adapter for this to work. A passive adapter does not work.\nThe reason this doesn't seem intuitive is that many DisplayPorts ports are of the \"DisplayPort++\" type (also called dual-mode). Those are able to automatically detect when used with HDMI, and then the port outputs a signal specifically for HDMI. The non-++ DisplayPort ports on your hub does not do that - and thus need an active adapter for converting the signal.\nYou can use an adapter such as this:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EDT0072\nIt sounds like you've left out some part of the explanation on how you got it working with a HP laptop - as the same limitation should apply there.\nNote: If you intend to connect two displays for extended desktop, this hub won't work. Connecting two seperate displays requires support of MST, which macOS does not offer. You'll need to use a Thunderbolt 3 adapter or dock instead.\n", "Q: How can I forward web traffic from Mac to iPad? I am trying to setup the iPad as a development station. Managed to ssh from it to my Mac, but the thing is, on the Mac I need to connect to a VPN to be able to access some websites. Those websites would be accessible from the Mac, and I would like to use the Mac as a proxy somehow, so that also the iPad would be able to have access to the same kind of resources. \nDoes anyone have any tips as to how I could get them to work on the iPad?\n\nA: I have a similar situation and resolved it by setting up a VPN client on the iPad so that it connects directly to those addresses.\n\n\n*\n\n*The built in VPN client in IPSec mode works great with Cisco.\n\n*The L2TP works great with most standard commercial VPN solutions (like Meraki)\n\n*OpenVPN works with many consumer grade VPNs (like NetGear Orbi)\n\n\nDoing this allows me to use the iPad directly with remote resources behind my company or home firewall.\n\nA: If your VPN is a \"tunnel-all (traffic)\" VPN, and runs as software on your Mac, which most are, it's not going to be possible to get your iPad to connect to it / the tunnel.\nMost VPNs establish a routing rule that renders local WiFi devices (other hosts, WiFi printers, etc.) unavailable. I live this life nearly 24/7 which makes my work machine unsuitable for anything with personal use, even things that involve communication between my work phone and work laptop (eg. Handoff) which is particularly obnoxious.\nIn the (low) chance that your VPN is via an external ethernet-wired hardware device, you should be able to accomplish this via MacOS' built in \"Internet Sharing\" (System Preferences -> Sharing, Internet Sharing checkbox.) Your iPad would then connect to the WiFi provided by your Mac, rather than the wireless router that everything else connects to.\n\nA: \nI would like to use the mac as a proxy somehow\n\nYou've said \"proxy\" — it means you're half-way there:\n\n\n*\n\n*Proxy has to be run on Mac1;\n\n*iPad should be configured to use it.\n\n\nAs often happens similar things are already done by someone and are on Internet, check it out: \"How to connect an iOS device to your computer via a SOCKS proxy\".\nI'll add a small adjustment though.\nOn your Mac you can run this SHELL-command: ssh -N -gv -D 1080 127.0.0.1 — it simply connects over SSH to Mac itself but it has a side effect: it opens up TCP/IP ports2 1080 which would become gates to SSH's own Socks-proxy3.\nConfiguring iPad to use Socks proxy shouldn't cause any troubles and is described by the link I've given as well.\n__\n\n\n*\n\n*If your SSH software on iPad supports Socks proxying you can avoid running proxy on server itself. But beware that Socks proxy endpoint would be iPad, so when you configure a browser you should be using iPad's local IP 127.0.0.1.\n\n*Port would be bound to all network interfaces of Mac thus meaning you can connect to it from your LAN — unless there's a firewall, of course.\n\n*It's not only possible way to get Socks proxy on your Mac, but likely the most fast and simple one.\n", "Q: Navigating between the different areas in Xcode with a keyboard \nI’m looking to use VoiceOver with Xcode. \nUsing just the keyboard (and with VoiceOver running) how do I switch focus between Xcode's main editing area, the project navigator, the issues navigator, and the scroll bar overview?\n\nA: The shortcuts you are looking for are the following\n\n\n*\n\n*The project navigator is: ⌘+1 (Cmd-1)  \n\n*The issues navigator is: ⌘+5 (Cmd-5)  \n\n*Main Editing area is (once you have selected a file in the\nissues or project navigator):\n\n\n*\n\n*⌘+J (Cmd-J) and, after release, ↵ (Return) or  \n\n*⌥+⌘+` (Opt-Cmd-`)  \n\n\n*The Mini Map: ⌃+⌘+⇧+M (Ctrl-Cmd-Shft-M)\n\n\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: rsync in cron on Catalina no longer working I have various rsync entries in crontab that worked reliably right up until the moment I upgraded to Catalina.\n00 04 * * * /usr/local/bin/rsync --archive /Volumes/FOO me@remote.example:BAR\n\nHere rsync is installed via brew install rsync (and it is still the correct version post-upgrade).

The jobs simply do not work.\nCopying/pasting the exact command out of crontab and running it directly does work, though.\nAdding -vv to the cron job, I see that the list of files being evaluated simply isn't complete.

They've been backing up the MBA with Time Machine more or less regularly, with the last backup completed 7 days before the upgrade. (I know, I know: they should have backed up right before upgrading, but now it's too late for that) The Time Machine drive is an external hard drive connected via thunderbolt (v1) cable and thunderbolt to USB-C adapter.\nNow the upgrade to Catalina has completed successfully, but they can't backup to Time Machine anymore because \"there isn't enough space\".\n\nThe Time Machine drive is a 1TB hard drive with 505GB available. That should be plenty to perform a new incremental backup of the MBA. I know that  backups following a major macOS update take more space, but it should still fit comfortably in 505GB, and even if it didn't it should automatically clean old backups.\nIs it a genuine issue (it actually needs more than 500GB), or an error? How do I fix it without losing the old backups?\n\nA: I had a similar issue where TimeMachine was complaining about not being able to backup to a USB attached external disk. (Even though there was plenty of space for the backup).\nApparently the connection was in an unexpected error state, so I did the following and all was working afterwards:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown the Mac\n\n*Unplugged the External HD\n\n*Unplugged the USB cable\n\n*Waited 60 seconds\n\n\nThen plugged them back in and restarted the Mac.\nAll was good again.  (Hope this works for you too.)\n\nA: The first thing to try on Catalina is to tell it not to backup the system files and apps. Since the read only system is split, you will have a larger than normal new backup interval. You shouldn’t have to do this by my math either, but it’s low hanging fruit to try.\nOpen Time Machine preferences, select options and tick the box labeled Exclude system files and applications as shown below.\n\nIf that gets you past the conservitave estimate, you’re set.\n\nNext, I would just add a new drive - get whatever is less than $95 from a local store and set it up as a second destination. Leave both connected and the system will back up even/odd to each destination in turn.\nOnce you know you have a good backup, you can decide if it’s worth finessing the old backup or just let it be the history before Catalina and a place for manual backups of things like installers you download, second copies of photos and videos or just leave it on the shelf.\nI use a tool BackupLoupe to analyze each drive in detail so you can see what needs cleaning up, but the time you spend trying to finesse this might be better spent unless you really want to get into the details of what changed on Catalina.\nIn that case - https://eclecticlight.co/2019/11/14/time-machine-has-changed-again-in-catalina/\n", "Q: How can I fix things when Catalina will not connect to smb shares?

I noticed my Mac is logging 10hr+ daily usage of Mail, Safari and stuff. But they are just running in the background - since I don't want to always quit and launch these frequently used apps. But I am not sure how exactly the Screen Time is calculated. \nDoes it still accumulate when these apps running in the background, and even if I set my Mac to screensaver?\n\nA: I have noticed that the Catalina version of the app simply displays how long apps are open, rather than how long they’re being used.\nSo if I keep Safari open on my Mac all the time, it reports that duration – even if Safari is in the background while I’m doing other things. \nIf I put my Mac to sleep with Safari frontmost, when I wake it up, it will be counted as a pickup. On iOS, this makes sense because when you wake up your iOS device, you are on the home screen, so you have to actively choose which app you are going to use. Also, it doesn’t seem to be reliably updated on the Mac; right now, I’ve put my Mac to sleep a couple of times yet when I awaken it, it doesn’t add to the number of pickups. And it’s not counting the System Preferences app, which I’ve used several times after waking up my Mac to view Screen Time.\nSo, in my opinion, the Screen Time report doesn't make proper sense in macOS. \n", "Q: Where does Microsoft Word store autorecovered documents in Catalina?

Obviously the padding of the sequential numbering can be a different number of digits and the image type extension can vary as well.\nThen to that end, the following example bash code works for me:\nMethod 1:\nThe following assumes the sequential numbered files are four digits, starting at 0001, add all files have the same extension.\nIt will process all four digit sequential numbered files in the same directory while overwriting the output.mov file, if it already exists.\nChange Service receives selected files or folders inFinder to:\nService receives selected folders in Finder\nRemove the Get Selected Finder Items action,\nSet Pass input: to as arguments in the Run Shell Script action.\nReplace the default code with the following example bash code:\ncd \"$1\" || exit\next=\"$(file=\"$(ls 0001.*)\"; echo \"${file##*.}\")\"\n/opt/local/bin/ffmpeg -y -i %04d.${ext} -r 24 -codec prores output.mov\n\nThe example bash code above assumes you are selecting only one folder in Finder.  For multiple folder selections, use the following example bash code:\nfor f in \"$@\"; do\n    cd \"$f\" || exit\n    ext=\"$(file=\"$(ls 0001.*)\"; echo \"${file##*.}\")\"\n    /opt/local/bin/ffmpeg -y -i %04d.${ext} -r 24 -codec prores output.mov\ndone\n\nNote: The example bash code contains limited error handling. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted.  \n\nMethod 2:\nService receives selected files or folders in Finder\nRemove the Get Selected Finder Items action,\nSet Pass input: to as arguments in the Run Shell Script action.\nAssuming the selected image files in Finder are all the same type, in the same folder and the e.g. output.mov file will be created in the same folder of the selected image files...\nThen to that end, the following example bash code works for me:\no=\"output\"\ne=\"mov\"\n\nd=\"$(dirname \"$1\")\"\ncd \"$d\" || exit\n\nif [[ ! -e \"${o}.${e}\" ]]; then\n    o=\"${o}.${e}\"\nelse\n    n=2\n    for f in ${o} *.${e}; do\n        if [[ \"${o} ${n}.${e}\" == \"$f\" ]]; then\n            n=\"$(( n + 1 ))\"\n        fi\n    done\n    o=\"${o} ${n}.${e}\"\nfi\n\nfoo=\"$(date +%s)\"\nmkdir \"/tmp/${foo}\" || exit\ncd \"/tmp/${foo}\" || exit\n\ni=1\nfor f in \"$@\"; do\n    ln -s \"$f\" \"$(printf \"%05d\" $i).${f##*.}\"\n    (( i++ ))\ndone\n\n/opt/local/bin/ffmpeg -i %05d.\"${f##*.}\" -r 24 -codec prores \"${d}/${o}\"\n\nrm -r \"/tmp/${foo}\"\n\nNote: The example bash code contains limited error handling. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. \nMethod 2 Notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the e.g. output.mov file already exists, an incremented filename is used, starting at, e.g. output 2.mov and continuing to increment as needed so the Automator Service doesn't fail because the output file already exists. This is primarily handled in the if...else...then block; however, the lines of code prior to it are a part of it as well.\n\n*In order to accomplish the goal, a temporary directory is created in /tmp, named for the number of seconds since the Unix epoch, e.g. /tmp/1574058046 and is handle by foo=\"$(date +%s)\" and mkdir \"/tmp/${foo}\".\n\n*Within this temporary directory a sequential numbered symlink is created for each of the selected image files, and is handled primarily by the for f in \"$@\"; do ... done loop.\n\n*ffmpeg then creates the e.g. output.mov file.\n\n*The temporary directory, e.g, /tmp/1574058046 is removed.\n\n*Note that the selected image files must all be of the same type per run, however, each run can use a different supported image file type as long as all are the same type per run. As currently coded you can not mix different image file types per each run of the service.\n\n\n\nNote: The Get Specified Finder Items action is just for testing purposes and would be deleted before saving the Automator Service.\n\n", "Q: Can I access iCloud/device data of the hacker who logged into my account? I noticed someone else has been using my iCloud but it doesn’t show up under “my devices”\nSince they are logged into my iCloud and can receive my Messages/FaceTime etc, is there anyway I can access there information since there connected to my iCloud?\n\nA: The answer is no in the sense that you cannot get access to data only stored on their device, or data stored in their iCloud account.\nAny data they choose to store in your own iCloud account, you can ofcourse see.

In Settings I found a Setting to disable the Control Panel in Apps, but I couldn’t find a similar Setting for the Notification Center. \nHow can I disable Notification Center in Apps in iOS?\nI have iPhone 6s with iOS 13.1.3. \n\nA: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3419084 has a person saying \n\nFor apps which are running in full-screen (includes games, but also built in apps such as YouTube and Photos when they are in full-screen mode), the gesture which normally brings down the full notification center just brings down a little gray tab at the top middle of the screen. You can then slide that tab down, if you really want the notification center.\n\niOS 7 Make Control Center hard to open like fullscreen mode while still showing status bar\nshows an example of control centre pullup gesture where a small arrow appears which forces us to swipe twice to get control centre in full screen apps. An answer says that\n\nThe system will only show this tab when the status bar is hidden.\n\nSo most likely it is upto the developer to make appropriate changes to use this feature, instead of covering the screen in one go. \n", "Q: Does macOS keep iSight Camera usage logs?

With each project, iMovie imports videos, images, and audio into an iMovie Library.imovielibrary. I want my originals in a separate folder, along with other originals that I didn't import into iMovie and others for which I use other tools such as ffmpeg, but I still want to keep the ability to edit and export projects. At the moment I have videos in two places and the iMovie library is a bloated 300 GB in a 1 TB drive.\nHow can I avoid duplicating video or other files in an iMovie library and save disk space?\n\nA: This page suggests replacing the video files with links to the original, which saves space. It has this gist in ruby, and I coded this gist in Python, which is also below. The iMovie library went from 300 GB to 5 GB because I skipped two projects I was still working on.\nLike the ruby version:\n\n\n*\n\n*it goes through an iMovie 10 library and replaces the files in Original Media for which it can find a correspondence with links\n\n*it requires you to import into the library, quit iMovie, and then run the script.\n\n\nUnlike the ruby version:\n\n\n*\n\n*it uses symlinks to the original media instead of hard links (I confirmed that it works just as well)\n\n*you can define the filetypes to replace (movie, audio, image)\n\n*you can adapt the global variable PROJECTS_TO_SKIP to avoid replacing media\non some projects that you may be working on.\n\n*you can skip projects that you're still working on\n\n*it assumes that your iMovie library and originals folder are organized by the same event name, because in my case I had multiple DSC001.MOV and I use the event name to distinguish them\n\n*if the event names are different, e.g. if you create two events titled \"movie\" then iMovie renames\nthe second to \"movie 1\", you can adapt the global variable\nSHOW_NAME_CORRESPONDENCE to map the name of the iMovie event to the name of\nthe folder with the original content.\n\n\nimport doctest\nimport glob\nimport os\nimport pathlib\nimport shutil\nimport sys\n\nFILE_SUFFIXES_LOWERCASE = [\".mp4\", \".mts\", \".mov\", \".jpg\", \".jpeg\", \".png\"]\n\nPROJECTS_TO_SKIP = []  # e.g., [\"project 1\", \"project 2\"]\n\nSHOW_NAME_CORRESPONDENCE = {}  # e.g. {\"movie\": \"movie 1\"}\n\ndef skip(f):\n    \"\"\"Returns a boolean for whether to skip a file depending on suffix.\n    >>> skip(\"abc.mp4\")\n    False\n    >>> skip(\"ABC.JPEG\")\n    False\n    >>> skip(\"abc.plist\")\n    True\n    >>> skip(\"00114.MTS\")\n    False\n    \"\"\"\n    suffix = pathlib.Path(f).suffix.lower()\n    return suffix not in FILE_SUFFIXES_LOWERCASE\n\ndef get_show_and_name(f):\n    \"\"\"\n    >>> show, name = get_show_and_name(\"/Volumes/video/iMovie Library.imovielibrary/my great show/Original Media/00117.mts\")\n    >>> \"my great show\" == show\n    True\n    >>> \"00117.mts\" == name\n    True\n    >>> show, name = get_show_and_name(\"/Volumes/video/path/to/originals/my great show/00117.mts\")\n    >>> \"my great show\" == show\n    True\n    >>> \"00117.mts\" == name\n    True\n    \"\"\"\n    path = pathlib.Path(f)\n    name = path.name.lower()\n\n    dirname = str(path.parents[0])\n\n    imovie = \"iMovie Library.imovielibrary\" in dirname\n    parent_dir = str(path.parents[2 if imovie else 1])\n    show = dirname.replace(parent_dir, \"\")\n\n    if imovie:\n        assert show.endswith(\"/Original Media\"), f\n        show = show.replace(\"/Original Media\", \"\")\n\n    assert show.startswith(\"/\")\n    show = show[1:].lower()\n\n    if show in SHOW_NAME_CORRESPONDENCE:\n        show = SHOW_NAME_CORRESPONDENCE[show]\n\n    return show, name\n\ndef build_originals_dict(originals):\n    \"\"\"Go through the original directory to build a dictionary of filenames to paths.\"\"\"\n    originals_dic = dict()\n\n    for f in glob.glob(os.path.join(originals, \"**\", \"*.*\"), recursive=True):\n        if skip(f):\n            continue\n\n        show, name = get_show_and_name(f)\n\n        originals_dic[(show, name)] = f\n\n    return originals_dic\n\ndef replace_files_with_symlinks(library, originals):\n    \"\"\"Go through the iMovie library and find the replacements.\"\"\"\n    originals_dic = build_originals_dict(originals)\n\n    # List files recursively\n    for f in glob.glob(os.path.join(library, \"**\", \"*.*\"), recursive=True):\n        if skip(f) or os.path.islink(f):\n            continue\n\n        show, name = get_show_and_name(f)\n\n        if (show, name) in originals_dic:\n            target = originals_dic[(show, name)]\n\n            print(\"Replacing %s with %s\" % (f, target))\n            os.unlink(f)\n            os.symlink(target, f)\n        else:\n            print(\"No original found for %s\" % f)\n\ndef main():\n    args = sys.argv\n    assert 3 == len(args), \"You need to pass 3 arguments\"\n    library = args[1]\n    originals = args[2]\n\n    replace_files_with_symlinks(library = library, originals = originals)\n\nif \"__main__\" == __name__:\n    r = doctest.testmod()\n    assert 0 == r.failed, \"Problem: doc-tests do not pass!\"\n\n    main()        \n\n\nA: First a disclaimer: As you can see from miguelmorin's answer, some people have created various scripts to replace the duplicate images and videos in the iMovies library with hard links or symlinks. Before going any further, I would avoid hard links. Symlinks seem to work fine with iMovie, and hard links can have weird side effects, for instance Time Machine may back them up as separate files.\nIn my case, I used rdfind, which is an existing utility for cleaning up duplicate files and isn't specific to iMovie or even macOS.\n\n*\n\n*Install rdfind\nbrew install rdfind\n\n\n\n*Do a dry run\ne.g.\nrdfind -dryrun true -minsize 1048576 -makesymlinks true ~/Pictures/ ~/Movies/\n\n\n*\n\n*-minsize is used to avoid touching any files that aren't image or video files. Adjust it as needed.\n\n*Replace ~/Pictures/ with the location(s) of the original image/video files. You can list as many directories as you want, but ~/Movies/ should be last because rdfind expects the locations of the original files to be listed first.\n\nUpdate: YMMV but it looks like iMovie 10 puts all of the original images and videos in Original Media directories under ~/Movies/iMovie Librarie.imovielibrary. This will go through those directories only and run rdfind on them, in which case -minsize shouldn't be needed (as above, replace ~/Pictures/ as needed):\nfind ~/Movies/ -type d -name \"Original Media\" -exec rdfind -dryrun true -makesymlinks true ~/Pictures/ {} \\;\n\n\n\n*Create the symlinks\nOnce you're happy with the output of the command from the dry run, remove -dryrun true to replace the duplicate files with symlinks, e.g.\nrdfind -minsize 1048576 -makesymlinks true ~/Pictures/ ~/Movies/\n\nOr:\nfind ~/Movies/ -type d -name \"Original Media\" -exec rdfind -makesymlinks true ~/Pictures/ {} \\;\n\nPros:\n\n*\n\n*Dry run option to show you what it's going to do first\n\n*Will actually check the files to see if they're the same rather than just compare file names\n\n*Will find duplicates even if the filenames are different\n\nCons:\n\n*\n\n*There's no way to restrict it to only image and video files (worked around above either by using -minsize or by only running rdfind on the Original Media directories)\n\n", "Q: Installing more than one battery pack in Macbook? I am interested in installing two standards aftermarket batteries (wired in parallel) in Macbook 11 inch 2017. \nPlease ignore the issues with the physical housing constraints - I am purely interested in the electrical details about the power supply and charging.\nIs this possible? If so, has anyone done it? \n\nA: From a battery controller logic standpoint, I am fairly confident that is not possible, in the sense that the result will not be a stable configuration. The reason is simply that there is no mechanism to handle such a scenario on a logic level. \nMy understanding is that a MacBook battery has some simple logic and communicates the charge level and other battery internal states to the charging controller on the mac logic board. If you parallel-wire two batteries together, the logic on those two batteries will generate cross-talk when the logic board controller tries to talk to the battery.\nThe logic board sends an enquiry, which will go to both batteries, and the two batteries will answer back at the same time, possibly with different answers. That will not go down well in the logic board controller.\nSo I think the only way this would be possible is if you could connect the two batteries to a hypothetical 3rd party battery controller board, which in turn would be connected to the MacBook logic board, mediating the communication between the logic board and the batteries.\n", "Q: Can't sign in to Apple Music, TV or Podcast on Mac I recently did a clean install of macOS Catalina on my MacBook Air and since I can't sign in my Apple Music account in Music App. Neither I can connect to TV although I don't have a subscription contrary to Apple Music.

You cannot swap a color with transparency in Preview.\nWhat you are looking to do could be accomplished in paid apps like Adobe Photoshop or free and open-source apps like GIMP.\nDepending on a number of different factors, like image type and compression, making white transparent in image editing software can be as simple as selecting all pixels of a single color and setting them to transparent, or as complex as manually selecting and setting pixels to transparent outside of an object's boundary.\n", "Q: Mail.app and accountsd are taking op all CPU Mac OS 10.15 I have suddenly (did not see when it is happening and when it is stopping) CPU peaks, which is coming from Mail.app and accountsd all together\ni did a screenshot of the activity monitor as well as the console, where, when this spike is happening, it is creating +/- 3500 messages a second, all the same as the one on the Screenshot shows some of it.\nScreenshot Activity Monitor : https://bazinga.lu/mail1.png\nScreenshot Console : https://bazinga.lu/mail2.png\nMost of the messages are like this one:\nConnection error changed for account:   \n\nthis for all mail accounts.

Just look for it under Acrobat in the file sharing program.\n", "Q: Is there a way to see if a macbook had a time machine backup done? I was wondering if there's any way to see if someone did a Time Machine backup on a macbook. \n\nA: From what I'm gathering you want to see if anyone accessed your computer to make a backup of it. I found this thread which might answer your question for how to retrieve the time machine backup logs from your Mac. Run the following command in Terminal\nlog show --style syslog --predicate 'senderImagePath contains[cd] \"TimeMachine\"' --info\n\nwhich will show the most recent backups made. There is one change needed since log files can show activity of another account, if your Mac doesn't have your log in trusted as an administrator, you need that permission to do the search. Just add sudo to the above command as shown below:\nsudo log show --style syslog --predicate 'senderImagePath contains[cd] \"TimeMachine\"' --info\n\n\nA: I think this might help:\nThe Time Machine Mechanic (T2M2) – a quick but thorough check of Time Machine backing up\nIt’s a free tool from Howard Oakley, who describes it this way:\n\nT2M2 analyses your logs to discover whether Time Machine backups have been running normally, reporting any worrying signs or errors. You do not need to be able to read or understand logs to be able to check for problems now. Reports deep event traversals, compaction of volumes, regularity of backups, and more. Detailed Help book explains results and advises. New version enhances reporting of free space on backup volumes.\n\nThat’s where I’d start!\n\nA: You can use this command:\ndefaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine Destinations\n\nto read the configured backup destinations. Each entry will include a list of \"SnapshotDates\", showing when the Mac was backed up to that destination. Note: it won't list snapshots that have been deleted/expired, or destinations that have been removed from the configuration.\n\nA: Time Machine preferences will show you all disks used to back up the machine, and date ranges for the backup. Unless someone was particularly malicious and deleted that backup location from the MacBook prefs after completing it, you should be able to determine the date of last backup to a given drive.\n", "Q: Where does Homebrew store its installed packages list? I found myself with this problem:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/46459152/cant-chown-usr-local-for-homebrew-in-mac-os-x-10-13-high-sierra\nThe recommended solution was to uninstall and then reinstall Homebrew, so that's what I did... but I didn't do a \"brew list\" before to check which packages I had installed. Oops.\nI do have a Time Machine backup of my Mac, so I thought I'd plug in the drive and then, using the Terminal, navigate to the backup volume and then to whatever directory/file Homebrew uses to keep its database of installed packages.\nWhich directory should it be?\n\nA: If I understood correctly, here is the list of the folder HomeBrew creates while installing it on your machine. \n\nHomebrew installs packages to their own directory and then symlinks their files into /usr/local.\nAnd when you do brew list, it shows the tool that you get from it under Cellar Folder. So you can check all this folder to get rid of it properly. \nFor example, if I install wget as \"brew install wget\" then when I run brew list, it shows me as\n\n", "Q: How to disable auto load of applications on restart/turn on over OS X Catalina?

I have a couple of apps which I have set to Always On location usage. I'm sure that's what I want, and it's not going to change any time soon. iOS 13 prompts me about each of them every day or two. I would like to disable these prompts. Is there any way to do that currently?\n\nA: No, this is currently not possible as of iOS 13.\nYou should expect to get 1 permission request the first time you run the app.\nYou'll get one more if the app needs background permission.\nYou might get one more after several days of using the app.  This is so iOS can validate you still want it to have background, always allow permission.  After that, if you allow it location permission, you shouldn't receive any more notifications.\nThat means, in total, you could receive up to 3 notifications per app.  After that, the same app shouldn't notify you or ask permission again unless the developer changed the permission request in code.\n", "Q: Why does the Terminal app need access to Contacts? In Security and Privacy, Terminal has access to Contacts.  It also has access to Calendars, Reminders, and Photos.\nWhy does Terminal have access to them? I do not know of any Terminal feature which requires them.\n\n\nA: It doesn’t need access - say no to the request. \nUnless you want some program that runs inside terminal to look at your user data, just decline these requests. \nThis is covered in the security part Data protections - https://www.apple.com/macos/catalina/features/ - you are seeing the ask to allow looking into that data store / folder. \n", "Q: Are you allowed to promote a Patreon page on your iOS app? Under section 3.2.2 (iv) of the App Store Review Guidelines, it says that the following is unacceptable:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unless you are an approved nonprofit or otherwise permitted under Section 3.2.1 (vi) above, collecting funds within the app for charities and fundraisers. Apps that seek to raise money for such causes must be free on the App Store and may only collect funds outside of the app, such as via Safari or SMS.\n\n\nBased on the above, what would be the implications of displaying a message such as \"Support us on Patreon!\"?\n\nA: Let’s assume you’re not a charity or fundraising for one.\n\n\n*\n\n*Technically, no since in 3.2.1 (vii) it says you’re allowed to promote voluntary giving, provided 100% of the funds go to the recipient — but Patreon takes a cut of the funds pledged / gifted. \n\n*Realistically, probably yes. If your app is otherwise fine, Apple might not reject you solely for having to pay processing fees. \nAs long as you’re not just trying to dodge in-app purchase, I would say make your app and submit it for review. Also, look at IAP for a tip jar I addition to the patreon option. People can and will tip you if they love the app. Also, worst case is you have to find a payment processor where you pay all transaction fees up front or separately so Apple can see 100% of the linked gift goes to you.\nAlso, if this is all your app does, don’t bother. You’ll need a compelling app that provides obvious value for free or paid and can’t just be a “here’s my patreon, fund me” shell. \n\nA: I think you will have far more trouble with the \"no external links to purchasing mechanisms\" clause:\n\n3.1.1 In-App Purchase:\nIf you want to unlock features or functionality within your app, (by way of example: subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use in-app purchase. Apps may not use their own mechanisms to unlock content or functionality, such as license keys, augmented reality markers, QR codes, etc. Apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.\n\nYou may get through App Store review now, but they could decide to delay some future update due to the Patreon link. This happens often for various external links.\nIn my opinion you should instead offer a \"Premium\" subscription in your app. Add a few small features for dedicated users and charge a nominal yearly subscription fee.\n", "Q: Mysterious behavior: keyboard input is repeating some whole words!

Something weird is going on with the Icons for a few of the built-in System Preference prefPanes in macOS 10.15.x Catalina. For example, \"Bluetooth\" and \"Internet Accounts\". When I search Spotlight for these, the proper icon is displayed:\n\nBut, in Finder or Alfred only a generic icon is shown:\n\nanother example is Internet Accounts:\n\nvs\n\nI notice even in Finder, the generic icons are shown:\n\nOnly Spotlight and the System Preferences.app itself seem capable of showing the proper icon. I opened the Contents folder of the prefPane bundle to investigate. It seems like Info.plist contained within specifies icons via keys such as NSPrefPaneIconFile and CFBundleIconFile but even in that case, the file referenced doesn't seem to exist on the filesystem anywhere that I can find.\nE.g. for Bluetooth, NSPrefPaneIconFile = \"BluetoothAqua.png\" — but that file doesn't exist. Similarly, Internet Accounts specifies InternetAccountsIcons.icns and InternetAccountsIcon40.png as icons, but these are nowhere to be found:\n\nDoes anyone know what's going on here, or where the icon resources are being loaded from?\nedit: Found some additional info about this.

(including it's warnings!)\nThen from Recovery you may rm -f *.heic /Volumes/<your hard drive name>/System/Library/Desktop Pictures\nI really wish I had that space back, but I need FileVault more so I gave up.\n\nA: As a general rule I do not recommend deleting system files, however, if you really want to remove the default wallpapers you can do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to macOS Recovery by pressing ⌘R when booting the Mac.\n\n*Using Terminal, from the Utilities menu, use the following commands:\ncd /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/System/Library/Desktop\\ Pictures\nrm *.heic\nreboot\n\n", "Q: Behavior of macOS After Toggling Secure Boot on T2 Chip: Does It Remember the ECID? I am reading up on the T2 chip as I look at plans to avoid multiple machines by consolidating various OS requirements onto a single computer.\nIt sounds like I can use Full Security for Secure Boot in the Startup Security Utility for macOS and Windows 10.\n\nFor Linux, I plan to disable it and enable Allow booting from external media.\nWhen booting back into macOS after re-enabling Full Security, would there be any issue here, or would it boot just as if it had never been disabled?\nI ask because of this paragraph:\n\nWhen an operating system is being installed, the system communicates\n  to an Apple Signing Server and requests a personalized signature that\n  includes the ECID—unique ID specific to the chip—as part of the signing\n  request. The signature s unique and usable only by the operating system\n  with that T2 chip installed. Therefore, when Full Security is configured, > the T2 chip ensures the operating system is uniquely signed for each\n  computer.\n\nTo rephrase the question again, does the T2 chip remember this unique ID (ECID) after turning Full Security back on? Or rather, does it discard it when choosing No Security?\n\nA: Yes, the T2 always \"remembers\" its unique ID (ECID) even if you turn Full Security off and on again. It is never discarded.\nHowever, this is really not the question you would like to be asking:\nThe ECID is burned into the T2 chip and cannot change. The actual signature file created when the operating system is installed is stored on your disk drive as an im4m file. A valid signature can only be signed by Apple, and it contains the ECID from your T2 chip, limiting its validity to your specific computer.\nThe real question you want to ask is if those signature files are retained when turning off Full Security - and the answer is yes, they definitely are.\nEvery time you have a new signature created (for example when installing a new OS), the system creates a new, uniquely named im4m file on your drive. The old ones are not deleted.\nWhen you disable \"Full Security\" and set it to \"No Security\", then the T2 chip stops checking the validity of the signatures in those im4m files. It doesn't discard them, delete them or anything of the sort.\n", "Q: What exactly does \"Disconnect from iPhone\" do? Today I saw an option to Disconnect from iPhone (hotspot) in my list of available Wi-Fi access points, under the status bar icon on my Mac.\nI don't remember ever seeing it there before.\n\n\n*\n\n*What exactly does this command do?\n\n*Can't I just turn off Wi-Fi on my Mac, or select a different Wi-Fi access point to disconnect? What problem does this new feature solve?\n\n\nA: \n  \n*\n  \n*What exactly does this command do?\n  \n\nThis command disconnects your MacBook's Wi-Fi connection from your iPhone's hotspot. Clicking on disconnect will not turn off the Wi-Fi on your MacBook.\n\n\n  \n*Can't I just turn off Wi-Fi on my Mac, or select a different Wi-Fi access point to disconnect? What problem does this new feature solve?\n  \n\nIf you turn off the Wi-Fi on your MacBook, it will certainly be disconnected from the iPhone's hotspot (or any hotspot/access point for that matter). If you select a different Wi-Fi hotspot/access point, MacBook would still first disconnect from the iPhone's hotspot.\nWith the recent versions of iOS and macOS, Apple has streamlined the process of accessing Internet on your Mac, via the mobile data of your iPhone. If your iPhone (logged in with the same Apple ID as your Mac) has an active data plan, your Mac automatically shows the option to connect to mobile hotspot, even without you turning it on on your iPhone.\nYour Mac also offers to connect to the mobile hotspot on your iPhone if you are not connected to any Wi-Fi access point, and do not have Internet connectivity.\nDisconnecting from the iPhone's hotspot will stop the Mac from consuming data via your mobile data plan, and can save you from consuming data unnecessarily and unknowingly (which is generally paid for as consumed) by some apps/processes running on your Mac.\n\nA: It lets your leave WiFi on without being connected to an AP (assuming it doesn't reconnect to a known network) allowing support for the likes of AirDrop, AirPrint, etc. Seems to be making shortcut to keep you out of System Preferences.\n\nA: Disconnect from iPhone does exactly what it states: your Mac Wifi card becomes available and can connect to a known wifi if there is one or just stay disconnected but not turned off.\nChoosing a different Wifi in the list has the same effect has disconnecting from your hotspot and connecting your Mac to the other Wifi.\nTurning off the wifi is not the same has disconnecting, in that case you can't connect to any wifi service (wifi connection, AirDrop...).\nThis shortcut is only available when connected to iPhone hotspots to remind you that you are on cellular data and that it may be slow or expensive thus its an easy way to stop this process. This feature has been here for quite a long time for what I remember.\nOther related features are:\n\n\n*\n\n*a different wifi icon to remind you that your are on cellular data when using iPhone hotspot: \n\n*iCloud Photo Library does not update when on iPhone hotspot to save data\n\n", "Q: Where are back up restore app data guidelines? I am amazed how apple smoothly handles backup & restore application data. Does apple have any guidelines for backup / restore principles? How does applications handle version compatibility of restored data in between different versions of the same app.\n\nA: iOS Data Storage Guidelines\nSee Apple's iOS Data Storage Guidelines as a starting point. This documentation is written for developers of iOS applications:\n\nOverview\niCloud includes Backup, which automatically backs up a user’s iOS device daily over Wi-Fi. Everything in your app’s home directory is backed up, with the exception of the application bundle itself, the caches directory, and temp directory. Purchased music, apps, books, the Camera Roll, device settings, home screen and app organization, messages, and ringtones are backed up as well. Because backups are done wirelessly and stored in iCloud for each user, it’s best to minimize the amount of data that’s stored for your app. Large files will lengthen the time it takes to perform a backup and consume more of a user’s available iCloud storage.\n\nSee also the Core Data in iCloud documentation.\n", "Q: CPU usage is too high with Catalina when macbook-pro connected to an external monitor The same problem was occurring on the High Sierra. I was hoping it will be fixed on Catalina but unfortunately, I didn't.\nI use Catalina 10.15.1 on my MacBook Pro and work with an external monitor that is connected with HDMI.\nThe issue is that, according to Activity Monitor, the kernel_task process consumes more than 600% of CPU even when no tasks are running. The computer becomes totally unusable. I cannot switch between screens and everything freezes.\nAs a solution, I disconnect the external monitor.\nWhy didn't Apple fix this issue in the latest Catalina update?\n=> Is there an alternative solution for this?\nI have followed for the rMBP kernel_task spikes when connecting more than one external monitor [duplicate]\nI managed to disable system file protection using csrutil disable, but on Catalina now I am having the following error:\nmv: rename X86PlatformShim.kext to X86PlatformShim.kext.disabled: Read-only file system\n\n\nA: From your observations it sounds like you have a temperature problem with your MacBook Pro. The system makes the CPU sleep when it detects a temperature problem - this what makes it appear as if kernel_task consumes all the CPU time (it actually doesn't). Usually this is due to either: (a) fan problems, (b) blocked vents or (c) lack of cooling paste. \nI would check these to make sure that fans are working properly, the machine is not full of dust, the vents are free and cooling paste has been applied properly to the CPU.\n\nA: Enter sudo mount -a before sudo mv X86PlatformShim.kext X86PlatformShim.kext.disabled\n", "Q: Is my battery in my iPhone faulty, or something more? I have an iPhone 7. I had the battery replaced approx 6 months ago.\nI've noticed the battery life hasn't been overly great considering it's a new battery.\nYesterday, my phone started turning off at random. Today, it turned off and never turned back on.\nWhen the phone is plugged into the AC charger, it gets stuck in a boot loop on the Apple logo. But, when it isn't plugged in, I get no power.\nI've taken the battery out, and the exact same thing happens. It boots to a boot loop on AC power, and no power when unplugged, as expected. It's as if it won't run off its own battery source.\nDoes this sound like a faulty battery or something more significant like the IC board?\nI cannot boot into restore mode or off a USB port.\n\nA: My experience is you can triage it with these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have you tried to do the force restart command while it is plugged into ACC even if your phone has no power?\n\n*Have you tried using a different charger or socket? \n\n*Have you noticed any pattern in what the charge remaining is when the shut downs happen? (If they are spread equally - less likely the battery, if they cluster around certain voltage levels - likely the battery)\n\n\nAlso, my tactics would be to wait about half an hour after plugging your phone in just to see if anything happens.  My old iPhone 5 was useless for half an hour after I plugged it in when it was completely flat since it took a very long time to get past the weak area with lower voltage but worked OK at the top end.\nYour symptoms could be logic board, but are much more likely a battery causing it instead of a short or electrical failure.\n", "Q: Deleted symlink to /etc and now missing sudoers I messed up bad, real bad.\nI accidentally deleted the symbolic link to my /etc directory.

Since macOS (originally Mac OS X) is a variant of UNIX, and has been POSIX-certified for a while, I assume it’s always had the vi text editor available. In recent versions, it has come with Vim. Has the system always shipped with Vim specifically, or was there a time when macOS shipped with a different variant of vi?\nThis capture by the Wayback Machine shows that Vim has been included at least as far back as Mac OS X 10.6.6. Unfortunately, Apple seems to have deleted a lot of old documentation (or at least broken all of the links) so I’m not sure whether you can get older OS versions’ man pages online in this same way.\n\nA: vim has been included with OS X since version 10.3.0 (Panther); vi has been included from the very first version, 10.0 (Cheetah).\nApple has an excellent Open Source repository - http://opensource.apple.com - where they keep an archive of all the software that they've used in the development of their operating systems.  Looking at details of the 10.3 Project, you will see that vim made its first appearance.\n", "Q: Are iPhone Wireless Chargers Good for Batteries? I heard that the external wireless iPhone chargers for the XS MAX are not good for for the battery. Anyone know anything about this?\n\nA: Wireless charging is neither good nor bad for batteries; it's just an alternate way of getting the magic pixies (electrons) back into their cage (battery).  This is analogous to asking whether the interstate or the turnpike is better for your car. Both will get you to the same destination, but there are trade-offs from one to the other (i.e. the turnpike may be more direct, but they charge a toll where as the interstate is free, but it meanders around)\n\nSource:  Mouser Electronics\nAbove is a generic block schematic of a wireless charging circuit with an external charger.  Even though the charger is \"outside\" the device, it's still connected into the charging circuit to the Line Drop Out circuit/chip and the battery.  What that does is regulate where the device gets it's charge from - if it's \"high\", it will get the power from the charger.  If \"low,\" it will get it from the wireless coil.  But in the end, there's only one destination - the battery charging circuit.\nA better question is....What works for you?\n\n\n*\n\n*Wireless charging is slower but more convenient.\n\n*USB/Power Adapter charging is faster, but you're tethered to something.\n\n*Wireless charging has an inherent cool factor\n\n*Wired charging is tried and true\n\n*There's no connectors to wear out with wireless chargers\n\n*Wired chargers securely connect (you don't have to put it in just the right spot) connect\n\n\nBasically, it boils down to what is a better solution for your personal requirements.\n\nA: I wouldn't say that charging in itself is \"good\" for batteries, but it's definitely not bad for the batteries.\nApple hasn't rated the batteries for a different life time when using wireless chargers compared to wired charger. \nFor all practical purposes, wireless charging is not \"bad\" for your batteries.\n\nA: Wireless charging has the same effect on battery health as wired charging. Apple doesn't make a distinction on wireless and wired charging for their 80% battery capacity at 500 cycles claim.\nHowever, wireless charging may change your charging habits, which can have an effect on battery health.\nWireless charging can make it easier to charge your device by allowing you to simply set your device down, which can lead to your phone keeping a full charge for longer, which can be bad for your device. The sweet spot for battery health is keeping the charge between 20% to 80%. Keeping your phone fully charged has the generally same effect on battery health regardless of charging method, wireless or wired.\n(Anecdotally, my charging habits have changed due to wireless charging. I have placed wireless chargers by places that I tend to sit down for long periods of time, like my desk at work, on my night table, coffee table, in a car dock, and others. In the past, I wouldn't plug in my phone in these locations, except at night or in the car. My phone now stays on a charger and at 100% for much of the day.)\n", "Q: Repeated errors of “there was a problem connecting to the server” I have been having the following message pop up every few minutes on my Mac for around a year.\n\nThere was a problem connecting to the server \"***.***.*.*\". The server may not exist or it is unavailable at this time. Check the sever name or IP address, check your network connection, and then try again.\n\nThe IP address is for an old fileshare that I no longer have access to. So far I have tried every online link I could find but have not been able to get rid of it. Worst case I can just reinstall the OS but would prefer not to do that.\nI have checked both my login items as well as my Time Machine disks. I have also checked that I don't have any mapped drives from that share. The drive was only used for files and no programs should be connecting to that drive. The issue persists even when all programs are closed although it doesn't happen for other user accounts on the machine.\nDoes anyone have any ideas for getting rid of this?\n\n\nA: Try checking your Time Machine settings under System Preferences -> Time Machine. Look for a network disk that you are not using or is not reachable, and delete it. This solved this issue for me.\n\nA: The solution turned out to be that there had been a 1 password vault on that drive that I had accessed at some point. Deleting the inactive vault from 1 password solved the issue.\n", "Q: Cannot Serial/Screen into things error \"Cannot open line '/dev/ttyUSBtoSerial for r/w: resource busy\" \"Sorry, could not find a PTY\" Brand new MBP running latest MacOS Catalina 10.15.1, using USB-C to serial device found here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074WPTY6H/\nGet following errors in quick succession when attempting to use the screen command:\nCannot open line '/dev/ttyUSBtoSerial for r/w: resource busy\nSorry, could not find a PTY\n\nThings I have tried:\nAdding my user to dialer, tty, and wheel group (Some googling suggested adding user to dialout group but could not find said group on my mac).\nManually installing D2XX drivers found from amazon page.\nVerified no screen sessions were still opened with Activity Monitor.\nVerified proper permissions were set on the tty device itself.\nCoworker was able to use same cable on a MBP successfully.\nThoughts?\n\nA: Job #1 - is to determine if the USB device is being recognized in any form, you can do that by looking for the USB VID and PID (described below).  When you plug the cable in, you should see the device appear in the list, and go away when you unplug.\nThe VID number will tell you the ACTUAL chip type, ie: FTDI, SiLAB, Prolific, or Microchip there are many chips in these cables. Your comments imply you believe this is an FTDI cable, this will confirm. Otherwise you are going after the WRONG driver.\nJob #2 - Using the VENDOR ID - determine if the driver is loaded or not, or is present. For example once you confirm it is an FTDI cable, then the existing Apple provided driver should be present, same with SiLABs (apple provides this driver).\nTo do the above:\nFirst verify that this is an FTDI cable, there are many other chips (Microchip, SiLab, and Prolific) - some vendors (example: Adafruit, and others) have been known to change the chip inside with different cable builds.\nThe GUI method on macOS is: \n -> About this Mac -> System Report, under hardware click on USB.\nThere are multiple \"root hubs\" - my MacPro has a total of 5 (some hubs are built in and hidden inside your Mac and not exposed externally)\nPlug & Unplug your device, in the menubar of System Information -> File -> Refresh (CMD-R) to update the list displayed.\nLook for the \"Vendor ID (VID)\" (who makes the USB device) and \"Product ID (PID)\".\nfor example FTDI = VID: 0403, PID = 6010 (for the FTD2232H, the PID might vary depending on the chip).\nAs an alternative you can open Terminal and type: ioreg -p IOUSB -l -w 0 and get a lot of of details.\nYou can do the same thing with Windows in the Device Manager.\nOn Linux, you can use lsusb to print the USB devices.\nThis will verify that your device is even \"half recognized\".\nPart 1 - is that the OS can find the VID and PID\nPart 2 - is the driver for that USB device\nNote that FTDI has a built in driver in Catalina, no external driver required.\n", "Q: ssh VerifyHostKeyDNS not working I'm stuck figuring out why ssh is unable to verify my SSHFP entries.\nVerifyHostKeyDNS=yes is set in my ~/.ssh/config \n\n\n*\n\n*The Zone is properly signed as verified with\nhttps://dnssec-analyzer.verisignlabs.com.\n\n*SSHFP entries have been generated with ssh-keygen -r myhostname\n\n*dig +dnssec myhostname.myzone.tld answers with the proper RSIG entries and the do flag set (tested with internal resolver (pfsense) and external (quad1, quad8, quad9))\n\n\nI have tested everything with my Ubuntu 18.04 machine and can verify that it works (DNSSEC and SSH key verification), but my MacBook \"thinks different\"…\ndebug1: Server host key: ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 SHA256:tV75nOBtVSASQEc4Ruf3iwBDAokvusd8BnLsfIWrzPQ\ndebug1: found 6 insecure fingerprints in DNS\ndebug1: matching host key fingerprint found in DNS\nThe authenticity of host 'myhostname.myzone.tld (192.0.2.1)' can't be established.\nECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:tV75nOBtVSASQEc4Ruf3iwBDAokvusd8BnLsfIWrzPQ.\nMatching host key fingerprint found in DNS.\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?\n\nI had the same issue on my Ubuntu Machine as systemd-resolved had DNSSEC not enabled. \nBut macOS's mDNSResponder has no options at all.\nCould it be that macOS Catalina has no DNSSEC support (yet?/enabled by default?)\n\n\n*\n\n*System: macOS Catalina 10.15.1\n\n*Local Resolver: pfsense (unbound)\n\n\n$ uname -a\nDarwin MacBook.home 19.0.0 Darwin Kernel Version 19.0.0: Thu Oct 17 16:17:18 CET 2019; root:xnu-6153.41.3~29/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64\n$ ssh -V\nOpenSSH_7.9p1, LibreSSL 2.7.3\n\n\nA: As it appears you know, you have to get your DNS entries and resolver to support DNSSEC before VerifyHostKeyDNS can possibly work. \nThis line in your output\ndebug1: found 6 insecure fingerprints in DNS\n\ntells us that ssh found the the DNSSEC entries but did not trust them. This is most likely because it correctly asked for Authenticated Data (otherwise it would not find fingerprints at all) but the DNS resolver did not indicate the results were authenticated (otherwise the fingerprints would be labeled \"secure\" not \"insecure\").\nFirst thing to do is verify that dig can validate your DNS by looking for the ad flag in the results of dig, like this (parts of the reply omitted for brevity):\n$ dig +dnssec @1.1.1.1 icann.org\n\n; <<>> DiG 9.8.3-P1 <<>> +dnssec @1.1.1.1 icann.org\n; (1 server found)\n;; global options: +cmd\n;; Got answer:\n;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 17489\n;; flags: qr rd ra ad; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 2, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1\n\n;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:\n; EDNS: version: 0, flags: do; udp: 1452\n;; QUESTION SECTION:\n;icann.org.

This tells you that dig was able to validate the integrity of the data via DNSSEC. From the comments on the question, it appears that you are not seeing the ad flag, and so you need to address that by verifying that your DNSSEC keys are all correctly set up and that your DNS server supports DNSSEC. This includes making sure that your local DNS server has the correct root keys for validating the DNSSEC chain of trust.\nSome other notes\nOnce you get the ad flag from dig, you still need to be mindful of the fact that, as noted in the dig man page on the Mac, dig uses its own query system, not the system-wide one, so all dig can really verify is that you have your DNS entries correctly set up on your name server and that the DNS server you are contacting support DNSSEC. For that matter, ssh does not necessarily use the system DNS either, although in your case it appears to be.\nAlso, from a security perspective, you still have the issue of trusting the DNS server you are talking to. Unless you also set up some kind of authentication between your host and the DNS server, you remain vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack. \n", "Q: Can I use a formula as a Table Name? I would like to have a table name automatically generate when a root value is \nupdated.

Is there a way to have a formula be the name of a table? Or should I just have an extra header row instead of displaying the table name?\n\nA: There's no way to make a table name the result of a calculation. You will need to use a table cell and hide the table name.

As watchOS is being updated, more and more features are added. And for users using previous generations of Apple Watches, the slow down is affecting essential daily tasks more severely. I am not using many apps or advanced features on the watch. Basically, I read most notifications on my iPhone, allowing only selected apps to ping my watch.\nI wonder what are some of the functionalities that I can turn off, to make the watch more responsive. For example, I can unload some apps, and switch to a simpler, less computational expensive watch face. Are there more?\n\nA: The older watches are constrained with RAM and CPU.\nTo help with RAM - be brutal and remove every app you can. Only install things you need. I still have my original Apple Watch and it is a bit painful when I swap it in instead of my Series 4 - but it’s still sentimental in a way my original iPhone is.\nYou can’t really change the CPU time it takes for apps and complications to run, but by removing things and not running them, the RAM can get used for the things you need.\n", "Q: How can I restore an Application state from a cloned system?

Check in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy tab and see if Microsoft Word is listed in the Files and Folders section with any unchecked items. You can also try adding it to the Full Disk Access area.\nIf that doesn't work, you might be looking at a more general permissions problem with your Home folder.

So, no question arises regarding any conflict with system integrity protection.\nI have also tried to force change the permissions on the system files I want to edit using certain brute force commands, which I can't recall the name of, right now. But, I have tried.\nAs of now, I am still unable to change read and write permissions on system protected files and resources.\n\nA: Try on normal desktop with sudo mount -uw / it works until restart.\n\nA: Catalina introduced a new feature that overlaps and reinforces the filesystem protections that SIP provides. What it does is split the files between two volumes: a system volume containing Apple-provided system files, and a \"data\" volume containing all non-Apple and modifiable files. The system volume is mounted read-only as / (the root filesystem), and the data volume is mounted with read-write access as /System/Volumes/Data. There are also \"firmlinks\" that merge the content from the data volume in where it \"belongs\" (e.g. /System/Volumes/Data/Users shows up in /Users). If you change something in a firmlinked directory, the changes are stored on the data volume. If you try to change something in a non-firmlinked directory, it'll fail because it's on a read-only volume (even if SIP is completely disabled).\nFor more details, see the Ars Technica review of Catalina, the WWDC2019 sesson \"What's New in Apple File Systems\", and a filesystem map from the Eclectic Light Company.\nIf you really need to make changes in the content on the read-only system volume, it is possible, but I'd recommend against it if there's an alternative. Most of the things you normally want to change/add/etc can be done from modifiable parts of the filesystem (e.g. using /usr/local instead of /usr). So the rest of this comes with a warning.\nWarning: I have not tested this much, and make no promises at all about what the consequences will be (including both immediate consequences, and what happens the next time an OS update changes things). Do you have any important files on this Mac? Do you have a good backup? Do you feel lucky?\n[Update: In Big Sur, the system volume is not just read-only, but also signed, so changing it is even more difficult. See \"Mount root as writable in Big Sur\" for more info.]\nTo make changes to the normally-read-only volume, you need to both disable SIP's filesystem protection and also re-mount the volume with read access:\n\n*\n\n*Restart in Recovery mode (Command-R at startup), open Terminal (from the Utilities menu), and disable SIP filesystem protection with:\ncsrutil enable --without fs\n\n\n\n*Restart normally, open Terminal, and remount the root volume for read access:\nsudo mount -uw /\n\nAt this point, you should be able to make changes everywhere (subject to normal filesystem protections) up until the next restart. Disabling SIP's filesystem protection survives restarts, but remounting with write access does not. If you want everything to be writable after restarting, you'll have to repeat the sudo mount command after each restart. What I'd recommend, though, is locking everything back down as soon as you've made the necessary changes. To do this, restart in Recovery mode, run csrutil enable, then restart again normally.\n\nA: Before Catalina I used to have an alias in the root for my /opt. This was a cloud synced folder I could share across my machines to get some command line tools available everyone.\nWhen I got my Mac Pro, Catalina was installed and I started struggling with its file system proteciton. Disabling SIP didn't cut it any longer.\nAlso a great surprise showed up: the /opt folder is now part of the OS, which didn't even allow me to use the synthesized file to create faux aliases.\nI have since renamed that folder to /opts and keep using it like before, and thanks to synthesized I'm able to make it work properly, but WHAT A DRAG...\n", "Q: How to remove metadata from image files using AppleScript?

When a song was playing, I could pause it by clicking this button. However, since a recent reboot, this doesn't work anymore. The prev, next and pause buttons on the keyboard (f7, f8, and f9) also don't work anymore although they used to work. It is not because of the update to Catalina, because it has worked in Catalina before. Playing and pausing music on Youtube using this button still works.\nIs this an update of the Music app (that replaced iTunes)? Is it some setting? Is there any way I can get it to work again? I really like being able to start the music without having to open the Music app and start a track.\nTo clarify:\n\n\n*\n\n*Even if the Music app is active, it does not work\n\n*Both headphone button and keyboard buttons don't work anymore, although they used to work\n\n\nA: Here's an imperfect potential solution (depends on how you want to use the feature) – see problem 3 below.\nI created an applescript that uses keystrokes to tell apple music to play/pause. This way, you can just use automator to trigger it based on shortcuts (you can similarly bind fast forward and rewind).\nScript is below:\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell application \"Music\" to activate\n        key code 49\n        key code 48 using {command down}\n    end tell\n\n    return input\nend run\n\nPop this into an automator workflow using the \"Run AppleScript\" action and you can create a shortcut. I'm having issues doing this now, but it's something you can probably research. I use keyboard maestro, which makes setting up shortcuts significantly easier.\nTo change to rewind and fast forward, just change the line key code 49 to key code 123 and key code 124 respectively (this is left and right arrow keys)\nThere are a few problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*you may want to hide music instead of tabbing back to your original program. In that case, just replace key code 48 using {command down} with set visible of process \"Music\" to false and it'll hide the progam\n\n*you can't actually use the f8 key as a shortcut, but you could maybe bind it to something like command 8. You could also probably use Karabiner to rebind the f8 key to something else\n\n*This doesn't really fix the \"why\" of what's going on. I still don't know what's happening for sure, but it is a way for you to get it up and running (I still think you should try messing around with Karabiner to change the f8 key to like the keycode for play/pause. It may add clarity to what's happening).\n\n\nA: I have no idea what caused this issue, but some reboots later it works again. \n", "Q: How do you skip forward/back while watching a movie in iTunes for Windows?

I noticed the downloading of app updates is really fast on my iPhone X (iOS 13). Like for example the facebook app shows about 250MB in size on the update screen of the appstore but it's finished downloading in about 10 sec over WLAN in flight mode. Despite I have 40Mbit/s (5MByte/s) internet speed. So it should take about 50 seconds for this download. I am sure the update file(s) is/are compressed but this would mean like 250MB/5 = 50MB, which sounds like too much of possible compression for an app file. I mean it's not a text file with many redundancies. \nSo I wonder if updates contain only changes to the app but then the programming logic would have to allow that which I doubt that many developers do this because I saw this behavior not only in the facebook app but in most app updates.\nA more plausible reason would be that the size shown next to the update on the appstore is the uncompressed/installed size of the app. Does anyone know?\n\nA: Starting with iOS 6, the app store will automatically produce an update package for all new versions of apps submitted to the store. This package is optimized for updating an app from one version to another and contains files that have changed between the prior version of an app and the new version of the app, excluding files that have not changed.\nWhen used optimally, an update package is significantly smaller to download than the full package of the app and the update will install more quickly. Also, in many cases, this mechanism allows updates to large apps to be downloadable over cellular networks where app downloads are subject to a size limit.\nIn addition to new content, the update package contains instructions on how to transform the prior version of the app into the new version of the app. New files will be added, modified files will be replaced with their updated counterpart, and deleted files will be removed as part of this transformation. As far as the developer and user are concerned, this process is entirely transparent and the resulting updated app will be indistinguishable from a full download of the corresponding updated version of their app.\nSo, Delta updates are possible to set up in iPhone apps which totally depend upon the developer.

It ships with Catalina but my corporate requires Mojave to connect to the corporate network.\nI followed the instructions here but once I select booting from the Mojave external drive I get a “forbidden” icon and the system shuts down.\n\nA: I just spent a chunk of time with Apple support; they said it's impossible to install Mojave on the 16\". Sigh.\nAlso this: \"No macOS Mojave on MacBook Pro 16\" from gottabemobile.com\n\nA: No. This won’t work since the drivers to run this hardware only ship with Catalina. \nIf your support team isn’t ready for Catalina have them get you VMware fusion so you can run the older OS virtually while they contemplate supporting the new os. \n\nA: Likely Possible. I partitioned the drive got the Mojave install on and it booted in Mojave but then wanted to confirm startup disk I selected Mojave and eventually also gave the forbidden icon. So it boots but Apple mark it as incorrect at the final part of the load. These chipsets were used in previous MacBook. So maybe using Hackintosh tools we can get past this part.\nPeople saying use VM ignore that there are many high end apps like Soundgrid in Music that will take too much performance hit running in a virtual machine. Apple are mad forcing use to use a new OS until the software is ready.\n\nA: I have tried without success. I believe Mojave doesn't have the necessary drivers. \nYou can indeed downgrade if you have an older MAC. First, you will need to revert the File System changes though.

Then that user password will basically automatically be able to read the decryption key it seems which is really NON ACCEPTABLE in a non-infiltrated Apple. \nThe original key should be the only key capable of decrypting the disk and that key should not be stored anywhere on the system. \nNonetheless, I proceeded to create a secondary user which will be able to decrypt as well and I revoked the first users ability to unlock FileVault because I wish to minimize the original exposure of the password I type 5000 times a day. \nThe disk decryption password should really only be entered once. When the system starts. \n\nHow do I prevent a full login from the FileVault enabled user? Is\n  there way to have the account password be entered once and then never\n  fully logged in?\n\nSide questions: \n\n\n*\n\n*How did the disk password (in diskutil) become accessible from any user added to the system? For system to be able to do that, the original decryption key which is in my memory only, has to be encrypted with a user password, and then when the user provides a password it is decrypted and used to open the disk. Meaning the password is on disk in one way or the other once the disk is unlocked. \n\n*When I add a new user, that original password which might be in memory or disk is encrypted again with user password and then decrypted to reveal real password which is used to disk unlock. \n\n*Would it not be better if Apple just allowed DISK access? Why introduce this vulnerability which allows you to access main disk just by introducing a new user to the system? When creating a new user, apple is accessing the clear text disk password and encrypting it again. That's a problem since it must be that Apple is able to read the decryption key while system is running, and really allows anyone the ability to who gains access to any user on the system capable of adding users to grant disk access. \n\n*Is Apple here actually storing the original disk password in clear text in memory/disk or in some encrypted form with decryption key readily available when a new user is to be added? \nAnyway. Main question is how to prevent full login. \n\nA: I can answer this question myself out of accident which I somehow was able to even retrace what I did. \nTo prevent a login you do this: \n\n\n*\n\n*Add a new user, preferably a non admin user, and enter that password for that user which you wish to use as a filevault password. \n\n*Revoke all other users right to use filevault using: sudo fdesetup remove -user \"username\" from terminal. Note, do keep the user you just created. In fact you can not remove that user. One user must be on the filevault user list. \n\n*Go into the user settings again. And reset the password for the user just created. That will through I guess a bug, in my case feature, only change the password and not the filevault user. \nNow, restart computer. When you are prompted for the fielvault password it is the old and not the resetted password. This will unlock disk, but since the password is wrong for login, system won't be able to login user. Press esc and login your user. \nYou are welcome. \n", "Q: Can't boot from USB or CD/DVD I have an iMac 4,1 running OS X 10.5.8 that I want to install Lubuntu on. I have a USB drive and a DVD, both with the ISO burned to them, but I can't boot from either. They don't show up in Startup Manager at all. Both show up in the rEFInd menu, but when I try to boot either of them it tells me to make sure I have the latest firmware installed. How can I get one of them to boot? Alternatively, is there a way to burn the ISO directly to a partition on my hard drive and boot that way?\n\nA: I happen to have a 17\" iMac 4,1. I burned the lubuntu-16.04.5-desktop-i386.iso image to a RW DVD using a 2011 iMac. I booted from the DVD using the 2011 iMac and ran the software on the DVD to verify the DVD was burned correctly. \n\nTo boot from the DVD, you need start the Mac and immediately hold down the option key until the Startup Manager icons appear. Select the DVD icon labelled Windows.\n\nBooting from the DVD using the iMac 4,1 was problematic. Basically, at some point the boot would fail. At least once the boot succeeded. After some research I learned I needed to hit the F6, then include the nomodeset option before selecting Try Lubuntu without installing. Once booted to Lubuntu, I could select the install icon on the desktop to start the installation process.\nMy iMac 4,1 has the latest firmware updates which are listed below.\nBoot ROM Version: IM41.0055.B08\nSMC Version (system): 1.1f5\n\nThe firmware information can be found under \"Hardware Overview\" in the System Information application display.

Apple now requires two-factor authentication on all Apple Developer Program accounts:\n\nIn an effort to keep your account more secure, two-factor authentication will be required to sign in to your Apple Developer account and Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles starting February 27, 2019.

If you haven't already enabled two-factor authentication for your Apple ID, please learn more and update your security settings.\n\ndiscussion about that change is aggregated here:\nhttps://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/02/14/developer-apple-ids-to-require-two-factor-authentication/\n\nThis requirement presents a problem for people who are signed in to a personal Apple ID on their devices, but who use a separate company Apple ID for their Organization Apple Developer Account.\nIdeally you could use a generic 2FA code generator, but that is not currently possible for Apple ID:\nAbility to add non-SMS non-Apple 2FA to an Apple ID?\n\nCan a single device generate 2FA verification codes for multiple Apple IDs?\n\nA: Both iOS and Mac devices can sign in to multiple Apple ID accounts:\n\n\n*\n\n*One main \"iCloud\" Apple ID account for the device. This is the account used for iCloud Photos and other system features. It is very disruptive to change this Apple ID.\n\n*Multiple other lesser Apple ID accounts. These can be used to sync Mail, Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, and Notes. They can also generate 2FA codes.\n\n\nYour single device is able to generate 2FA codes for all of the signed-in Apple ID accounts, not just the main iCloud account.\n\nThe key is:\nYou must first enable 2FA for an Apple ID by using it to sign in as the main iCloud account on a device.\n\nIf you have access to a Mac, you do NOT need to sign out of your iCloud account on your iOS device or personal Mac user account (a disruptive change that should be avoided if possible).\nInstead, use the workflow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a temporary new local user account on a Mac.\n\n*On that user account, sign in to iCloud with your secondary Apple ID.\n\n*Signing in as the iCloud Apple ID allows you to enable 2FA for that Apple ID.\n\n*On your iOS device, add the secondary Apple ID:\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings > Passwords & Accounts > Add Account\n\n\n*Or on the main user account on your Mac, add the secondary Apple ID:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences > Internet Accounts > +\n\n\n*Because 2FA is now enabled, signing in will require a 2FA code. Use your new local Mac user account to Allow this sign-in and see the code.\n\n\nOnce permission has been granted, the secondary Apple ID will be signed in on your iOS or Mac device as a lesser Apple ID used for syncing Mail, Calendars, etc. You can turn off all of those syncing services, in which case the Apple ID will be labeled inactive.\nYour iOS device and/or main Mac user account is now a Trusted Device, and can be used to generate 2FA codes for both your personal Apple ID as well as the newly added secondary/company Apple ID.\nOnce this device is Trusted, you can delete the temporary Mac user account.\n\nA: Apple's has added a support document that clarifies this matter:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/support/authentication/\n\n\nWill I need a trusted device dedicated to my Apple Developer account if I enable two-factor authentication?\nNo. You’ll need to use a trusted device to enable two-factor authentication for the first time. However, you can use the same trusted device for multiple Apple IDs that are enabled for two-factor authentication. Additionally, if you do not have access to your trusted device, you can get your verification code via SMS or phone call. When possible, you should use a trusted device to increase security and streamline the process.\n\n\n\nHow can I use different Apple IDs for iCloud and my Apple Developer account?\nIf your personal Apple ID is different from the Apple ID associated with your Apple Developer account, you can configure your device to allow verification codes to be received for both Apple IDs.\n[...]\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Create a new system account on your Mac for your developer Apple ID at System Preferences > Users & Groups.\n  \n*Sign in to your new developer system account and enable two-factor authentication for your developer Apple ID at System Preferences > iCloud > Account Details > Security.\n  \n*[Mac] Sign in to your primary system account and add your developer Apple ID to your Mac at System Preferences > Internet Accounts > iCloud.\n  \n*[iOS] Add your developer Apple ID to your device at Settings > Passwords & Accounts > Add Account > iCloud.\n  \n*Your device is now set up to receive verification codes for both your personal and developer Apple IDs.\n\n", "Q: How to stop itunes from asking permission to allow computer to access info on my iPhone everytime i connect my phone?

When (what year & Model) was the butterfly keyboard introduced to the MacBook Air?  I would like to help a relative avoid purchasing such a keyboard.  Any references to support an answer are appreciated \n\nA: I assume you're trying to avoid purchasing a model with a keyboard that is prone to errors. Apple's \"Keyboard Service Program\" for the MacBook Air lists the MacBook Air Late 2018 and Mid 2019 models as eligible.\nThe Mid 2017 MacBook Air and older have the old scissor-style keyboard.\nThe Late 2018 MacBook Air has the new butterfly style keyboard. It has the newer version of the butterfly style keyboard that has a membrane to keep dust from jamming the keys (as compared to older MacBook Pros that featured a butterfly style keyboard without that membrane). So does the Mid 2019 model.\n\nA: The butterfly keyboard was introduced to the MacBook Air with the 2018 models.\nModels before that had keyboards that were referred to as 'chiclet' type keyboards.\nOne of the best resources for giving the differences between model generations is everymac.com\nThis is the entry for the 2018 model that first refers to the \"butterfly\" keyboard.\nhttps://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook-air/macbook-air-retina-faq/differences-between-macbook-air-late-2018-models.html\nThis is the entry for the 2017 model that still refers to the 'chiclet' style keyboard.\nhttps://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook-air/macbook-air-faq/differences-between-macbook-air-early-2015-models.html\nNote: The references to the 2015 model are because they are essentially the same model with a new processor.\nTo construct a definitive list you should check every model for references to the keyboard, although from memory I don't recall them switching from 'chiclet' to 'butterfly' then back to 'chiclet' and then back to 'butterfly' so if you don't want to read every model then it's probably safe to assume the 2018 'butterfly' was the first MacBook Air to use the new keyboard, although obviously they did appear on the now abandoned lightweight MacBooks earlier than that.\n", "Q: iCloud and AppleID 'married' to Macintosh When purchasing a used Macintosh, what does one need to know (i.e. what will adverse outcome) regarding the Hardware (serial #?) being tie to an ID?\nApple Products: Due to Apple removing the old website they had to check for iCloud or Apple ID accounts tied to devices we cannot be certain whether or not a device was tied to an account in the past. There is a possibility that a device may bring down a lock from a previous owner after we have already processed it. If a device does bring down a lock past our standard 30 day return policy it will not be accepted for return.  \nWhat can be done and what resources are available to mitigate this risk before buying the used hardware?\n\nA: The tie of an AppleID to a device is associated with the \"Find My\" capability. On an iPad or iPhone, this tie to the given AppleID makes it so that new users of the device cannot wipe it or change the AppleID without providing the previous user's AppleID login credentials.\nThe good news is that the tie to an account is not as \"strong\" on an iMac.

Is there a clear indicator that an app does not access the internet via Wi-Fi or cellular? \nFor instance in the Settings App there is an entry for every app installed on iOS 13. There you find an app specific toggle for „cellular data“. But some apps (eg KeePassium) do not have this toggle.\nWould an app connect to the internet if its “cellular data” setting is missing?   Because every other app that can use Wi-Fi and cellular has that toggle. I am not worried about bluetooth tethering as I can turn off Bluetooth on individual app basis and cable tethering is not an issue. \n\nA: iOS 12. \nThere's Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and USB-Tethering that you cannot directly toggle if you're using any of those interfaces for any purpose. Only way to stop them is to turn off the connection path itself. For Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, they should be turned off globally in Settings. For USB, detaching the cable is the way to go. \n\nA: If you go to settings and cellular you can see all applications that use internet over 4G, how many data they used and stop them to use cellular data\n\nA: First of all, the first comment to the question reveals the easiest way. That applies though if your device is jailbroken.

At first, everything generally seems to go fine: \n\n\n*\n\n*(as it should be) a list of thumbnails appears in the sidebar, indicating all of the pages that contain the search term.\n\n*Generally, though not always, the term I search for will be highlighted on the first page that it occurs on.\n\n\nBut, after this, things quickly start malfunctioning:\n\n\n*\n\n*Generally speaking, if I click on thumbnails lower on the list, Preview will take me to that page in the PDF (like it used to).  But, it will no longer highlight the searched for terms.\n\n*Instead, Preview will make a low-pitched beeping noise of the sort that occurs when one tries to perform some un-permitted action in a variety of mac situations.\n\n*Furthermore, once this occurs, I cease being able to make any highlights at all in the document I am viewing with Preview.  In fact, I can't even select any text any more.\n\n\nBelow is a list of unsuccessful efforts to resolve this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Closing the side bar does not work to resolve this.\n\n*x-ing out the search box in the upper right does not resolve this.\n\n*Selecting the \"Tools\" menu and then \"Text Selection\" does not work either, nor does clicking on the text selection icon in the edit panel.\n\n*If I quit preview and then re-open the PDF, I am able to highlight again.  But, the problem will re-surface as soon as I try performing another search.\n\n*Working with the same files in other PDF programs (e.g. Skim, Acrobat, etc.) poses no problems.  I'm quite certain it isn't a problem with the underlying PDFs.\n\n*None of the responses to this question resolve this.  (indeed, I supplied one such response myself a while ago, but that trick and the others no longer work).\n\n\nI've used Preview for many years without problem.

What is the difference between FileVault 2 and Disk Utility Encryption?\nAlso, what is the better/safer option encrypt disk when reformatting then install mac OS or install mac OS without encryption and setup encryption with FileVault 2? \n\nA: Both, do the same thing, that is to encrypt your hard drive. However, the difference is in the approach and can be disastrous if you’re not careful with it.\nPoint 1: \nWhen you use the Disc Utility to create an HD with Mac OS Extended (journaled, encrypted) - it will “Format” the drive (any data that you have on it will be lost, forever), it will then ask you set up a password. Once you’ve provided the info, and click Ok. It will format the hard drive within minutes (depending on the disk size of course). This is faster, but a destructive process.\nWhen you use FileVault - it encrypts the hard drive while maintaining the data within it. This is a slow and reversible (i.e. You can turn FileVault ON/OFF as you choose) process, often takes a few hours. But, if you need to preserve the data on the HD, then this is the way to go.\nPoint 2:\nFileVault can be enabled in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > FileVault to encrypt the existing data on the internal HDD on a Mac.\nDisk Utility > Erase can be used to format an existing or new partition and encrypt the volume as Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted).\nConclusion:\nIf you’re concerned about the privacy of your files and user data, and your computer contains information that shouldn’t be seen without authorized access, you should absolutely use FileVault disk encryption.\n", "Q: Intermittent detection of USB 2.0 keyboard thru Anker hub on macOS Catalina I am encountering a very frustrating issue since purchasing a MBP 2018.\nI have a USB 2.0 Apple Keyboard.\nAs new MacBook models only have USB-C ports, I had to purchase a USB hub (Anker 7-in-1).\nHowever it is it and miss whether or not my keyboard is detected. I haven't yet been able to isolate a fix-sequence (e.g. connect keyboard to hub, connect power to hub, connect hub to MacBook).\nHub, but no keyboard plugged in:\n\nKeyboard plugged in but not sending keystrokes:\n\nAfter reboot, keyboard is detected and sends keystrokes:\n\nI notice strange USB device enumeration also -- Those screenshots display 3x USB 3.1 bus, but MBP has 4 USB-C ports. And Anker appears underneath two of these, but There is only one Anker hub.\nIs there some known issue with USB on these new machines?\n\nA: I have the same issue. My USBC hub is Deltaco USBC 1266.\nYou probably don't need to reboot, just move the keyboard from one slot to another or move the whole dongle from one port to another. This usually resolves it for me.\nI had this problem when the computer was new in 2016. Whatever the OS was then. And I got it again after upgrading to Catalina.\n\nA: I am using a 2019 Macbook Pro 13\" with Mac OS 10.15.3 (Catalina).  I have a Dell D6000 USB-C dock and a Dell P2419HC USB-C monitor that can act as a USB-C hub.  With both of these docks/hubs, I have the issue where I will plug in the USB-C cable to the Macbook Pro 13\" and sometimes the USB devices or monitors will be recognized and sometimes they won't.  Additionally, sometimes the Dell D6000 will provide power to the laptop and other times it won't.\nEssentially, each time I plug the USB-C cable in to the laptop, it is completely random as to whether things will work or not, and this behavior occurs with both the monitor hub and the dock.  If I unplug and replug the cable in multiple times, it will eventually work... sometimes on the first try, second try, or third try.  Sometimes I will reconnect the cable 5-6 times before I get all external devices to be recognized PLUS power to the laptop.\nI have reset the SMC and the NVRAM with no luck.  I almost returned the D6000 dock until I realized the monitor was behaving the same way.  I have a CalDigit Thunderbolt 2 Dock that I can plugin to the same laptop using a Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter, and when using this approach, the USB devices show up every single time I disconnect and reconnect, leading me to believe that this could be a Dell hardware problem, or something about how the Dell devices work with Apple's hardware or OS.  However the original post references an Anker device, and another post Deltaco, so it's tricky to know if this has something to do with Thunderbolt 3, or just with 3rd party vendors using USB-C.\nSo, my long-winded answer would be try disconnecting and reconnecting until everything works fine.  Or try some other hardware or device to see what happens, I just don't have the disposable income to throw around testing this out.\n", "Q: How to read and manipulate ~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.finder.savedState/data.data Due to a bug in MacOS i've identified that this is the file that is being edited when I make a certain change in MacOS finder. \n\"~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.finder.savedState/data.data\"\n\nRight now it is kind of garbeled when opened with TextEditor. \nI would like to be able to read this file, and possibly later write back to it. \nThis file is modified for instance when CMD + I in a finder window and make changes to sort by kind. \nThat info is not stored in .DS_Store but Finder is saving it in this data.data file. \nI would like to write my own stuff into that file.\nIs that possible?

Not from the headphones! \nIn Sound Setting I can see that the output Device is set as External Headphones, but the sound is coming from the Mac speakers!\n\nI am so confused! Any idea how to get sound back to the headphones?\n\nA: In my experiments so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*It happens frequently in YouTube in Chrome but apparently not in YouTube in Safari or in iTunes.\n\n*I've seen it happen repeatedly on two Mac laptops and with multiple headphones. (Both Macs are on Mojave since they need to run 32-bit apps.)\n\n*Plugging in headphones does switch the Sound preference and the Sound menu bar menu to \"External Headphones\" even though it doesn't route the audio to the headphones.\n\n*When in this unfortunate state, the keyboard's Mute and Volume buttons don't work, that is, they don't alter the sound coming out the speakers.\n\n*Between all the above points, we can rule out hardware problems including flakey headphone jacks.\n\n*Resetting parameter RAM doesn't help.\n\n*Adjusting settings in Audio Devices in the Audio MIDI Setup utility app hasn't helped.\n\n*To get Audacity to switch to headphones, you have to ask it to rescan audio devices, then go into preferences to select the headphones. That usually works.\n\n\nFunky workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pause YouTube in Chrome.\n\n*Start playback in iTunes (it will play through the headphones), then pause it.\n\n*Resume YouTube playback in Chrome.\n\n*If that didn't work, pause YouTube, wait a few seconds, then try again.\n\n\nHypothesis: Some apps don't respond as well as Apple's apps to macOS's complicated sound output switching.\nIn Zoom: It turns out the Zoom app has its own menu to pick the output device. If it's not doing what you want, open this menu (next to the microphone button) and pick the desired device or pick Same as System (which seems to me ought to be the default if not the only choice).\n\n", "Q: How to put file into clipboard without losing control characters?

It also worth mentioning that web browsers like Safari, Chrome and Firefox can open and read the content, but I'd guess that's because web browsers are specially coded to tolerate read error and partial contents.\nFileVault is not enabled; and this is an old model so it's not T2 and file system encryption related issue. Permission is irrelevant to this issue because Visual Studio Code can access these affected files normally.

I have a 27\" iMac that originally had a Fusion Drive and I had previously installed Windows 10 on it using the Boot Camp Assistant.  I recently upgraded the storage in it and in the process of reinstalling everything, I opted to go with two large independent drives rather than the Fusion Drive setup.  Now I'm trying to reinstall Windows on it and it looks like I've painted myself into a corner.\nWhen I run the Boot Camp Assistant, it complains that Boot Camp cannot be installed to a split Fusion Drive.  OK fine, I'm comfortable doing it manually, so I partitioned the drive and made myself a bootable Windows USB stick with the Boot Camp Support files on it.  It works splendidly, except for one tiny problem:\nMy Apple Bluetooth keyboard and mouse don't work.  All I can do is stare at the Windows Setup screen with no ability to click or tab over to the install button.  And unfortunately, I don't have a wired keyboard or mouse to plug into it either.\nWhen the Boot Camp Assistant creates the Windows partition, it copies the Boot Camp Support files over for you and does something to make sure Bluetooth drivers load during the WinPE portion of Windows Setup so that wireless keyboards and mice work properly.  I assume it's doing this with an Unattend.xml or Autounattend.xml file.  But since I can't run the Boot Camp Assistant anymore, I can't examine the temporary environment it creates to see exactly how it's doing that.\nDoes anyone know how the Boot Camp Assistant loads drivers into the Windows preboot environment?  If it's just an Unattend.xml file like I suspect, you can just copy/paste the contents into your answer.\n\nA: This is not an answer to the question, but I resolved the issue by borrowing a wired keyboard and mouse.\n", "Q: SSH connection using public/private key authentication fails only for port 22 I have been struggling for hours to make sense of a specific failure from connecting to an SSH server from one recent macOS system.\nssh user@machine -p 22\n\nI have added all keys to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the target machine.

It is possible to specify that a specific key can only be used for authentication when connecting from a specific host - or that it must not be used when connecting from a specific host. If you had set that up to allow the Ubuntu host and not the Mac host - that could explain parts of what you're seeing. However, this method does not include matching again the port number - so it cannot explain that.\nThis is all assuming that you're running the exact same configuration for port 22 and port 2222 (which you stated you are), and that you're running standard OpenSSH software on the server. If you're not, that software might include configuration to discriminate based on ports - but I don't think it is likely.\n", "Q: Chrome on MacOS started rejecting self-signed certificates Starting 4 days ago (the date might be relevant if some updates came along),\nChrome on MacOS started rejecting self-signed certificates.

Instead, loud, ear-damaging noise blasts through my AirPods when the call starts or the music plays, and I often have to quickly take them out.\nI tried to resolve this by using the new Automation feature in Shortcuts. I created an automation that uses the Bluetooth trigger to run whenever my phone connects to my AirPods.

I'm a programmer diagnosing a customer's issue with our software. We're having some problems writing into the user's Documents folder in macOS Mojave 10.14.6.*\nIt turns out that the customer's ~/Documents folder is a symlink to itself, causing ELOOP errors when calling file APIs, and a Too many levels of symbolic links error when attempting to view its contents in the Terminal with the ls command.\n\nHowever, in the Finder, the folder displays normally, and appears to contain 15GB of contents.\n\nThe first time we saw this issue I wrote it off as an unsolved mystery, but this is the second customer we have seen in the past few years with a Documents folder that is a symbolic link to itself.\nSo my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*How is this possible?\n\n*What can cause this configuration? Is there any legitimate reason it might be configured this way?\n\n*Is it safe to tell the user just to move all the contents somewhere safe, delete the folder, and then recreate it in the Finder?\n\n\n* The path is obtained by passing NSDocumentDirectory into NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomain.\n\nA: \nHow is this possible?\n\nIt's easy to mess up when using ln on the command line. A symlink to self is legal (though nonsensical) so you wouldn't get an error when creating it.\n\nWhat can cause this configuration? Is there any legitimate reason it might be configured this way?\n\nIt's useless and should be removed. Once removed, they can create a new ~/Documents/ folder. If you're concerned about safety, keep in mind you can always drag things back from the trash.\n\nIs it safe to tell the user just to move all the contents somewhere safe, delete the folder, and then recreate it in the Finder?\n\nIf it's a symlink to self then it has no contents, because it's just a self-referential symlink. It's not a folder, it's just a recursive symlink. Finder is showing some folder that's named Documents but that doesn't mean it's showing ~/Documents/. You could create a folder with that name anywhere and add it to the Finder sidebar.\nIt would probably help to ask the user to cmd-click on the folder name at the top of the Finder window.

In a terminal session I can run launchctl getenv SSH_AUTH_SOCK and it prints the value of that variable. However if I ssh into the same user from another computer, then run the same command, there is no output. I'd like to know how to make this work.\nThis is important to me because:\n\n\n*\n\n*my ssh keys have passphrases\n\n*my terminal prompt includes bash-git-prompt\n\n*this leads to the message Enter passphrase for key [~/.ssh/...]: being printed every time my prompt is written to the screen when I don't have access to the ssh agent socket.\n\n*launchd sets the ssh agent socket path so that it can use the fancy \"only runs when needed\" functionality of launchd, so I don't know the path ahead of time and it changes on reboot.\n\n\nA: What you're describing is how things are supposed to work. The reason that commands leaves no output is not that some bug or error happened that prevents it from displaying the value of SSH_AUTH_SOCK - it is simply because that variable is not supposed to be set by launchd in your environment.\nWhen you're using key based authentication with SSH, and you want an agent to make it easier to handle the private keys - you'll want to run that agent locally. I.e. when you're ssh'ing into a remote computer, the agent is supposed to run on your local computer that you're ssh'ing from.\nImagine that you're ssh'ing in to a remote computer, and then want to use ssh from there and you need to enter a passphrase - the prompt pops up in the GUI shown on the monitor connected to that remote computer. You can't see it, you can't act with it. This is not how it's supposed to work.\nInstead run ssh agent on your local computer, load in the keys, and then ssh into your remote computers using the -A parameter for ssh to enable agent forwarding (or set it permanently for that remote computer in the configuration). \nIf you really want to run ssh-agent on the remote computer, you can ofcourse do so. When you have ssh'ed to the remote computer, simply run ssh-agent and add your keys. If you want to automatize running ssh-agent, you can do that.\n", "Q: Antivirus software for iOS and an iPad I just started at a new job.

I am trying to rename all the files in a folder with a prefix of \"temp_\" and in doing so have the alias to that file still be addressable from AppleScript after the prefix has been added to the file. The following code works on SOME machines but not others. I have tried it on a 2018 MBP running 10.13, a 2012 Mac Mini running 10.13, and a 2015 iMac running 10.13 and 10.14. The iMac is the only machine that has problem with this code:\ntell application \"Finder\"\nset theSelection to the selection -- so you must have a folder with files selected in Finder before running this code.\nset theFiles to the files of (item 1 of theSelection) --get the files\nend tell\nrepeat with f from 1 to (count theFiles)\n    set aItem to item f of theFiles -- set a variable as an individual file\n    set pdfName to name of aItem --get the name of that file\n    set aliasItem to aItem as alias -- get the alias of the file\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set the name of aliasItem to ((\"temp_\" & (name of aliasItem)) as string) --rename the file\n    end tell\n    display dialog (aliasItem as string) buttons {\"Cancel\", \"OK\"} default button \"OK\" --this is just here for testing the script, to see what the system still thinks the file is named\n    set posixPath to (POSIX path of aliasItem) --THIS is where the code fails on some machines. \nend repeat\n\nThe code fails on SOME machines when I try to convert the alias into a posix path. On the machines that this script works on, the test display dialog lists the file alias with the new name. So foo.txt becomes temp_foo.txt. On the machines that the script fails the display dialog comes back with just foo.txt as the file name. \nOn the machine on which this is failing, the file will be renamed temp_foo.txt like it should be, but the alias never updates, so it still thinks the file is just foo.txt. On the failing machines, the last command to set the variable to the posix path of the alias fails because the alias is incorrect since it is still pointing to the old file name.\nIf need be I will just rename all the files in one loop, then come back around and get the posix paths in another loop, since doing a new\nset theTempFiles to files of (item 1 of theSelection)\n\nShould get a new list of the files, now with their \"temp_\" prefix. But it pains me to put in a repeat loop that I don't think is really necessary since the code works FINE on some machines.\nWho can help me to get my code to run fine, and who can get it to fail? I just would like to see how big of an issue this is. Also it would be nice if someone could tell me that I am doing something horribly wrong in my code, and that is why I am getting unpredictable results.\n\nA: I think that got broken somewhere, as an alias is supposed to be a reference to a file item that remains valid even if it gets renamed or moved.  If you are going to be using POSIX paths anyway, you might take a look at using Cocoa's NSURL class (via some AppleScriptObjC) to keep track of the file references, since that is ultimately what is getting used (or is supposed to be used).\nuse AppleScript version \"2.4\" -- Yosemite (10.10) or later\nuse framework \"Foundation\"\nuse scripting additions\n\ntell application \"Finder\" -- get the selection\n    set theSelection to selection\n    set theFiles to the files of (first item of theSelection) as alias list\nend tell\n\nrepeat with anItem in theFiles\n    set anItem to POSIX path of anItem\n    set fileRefURL to (current application's NSURL's fileURLWithPath:anItem)'s fileReferenceURL() -- get file reference from path\n    tell application \"System Events\" to set the name of disk item anItem to \"temp_\" & (name of disk item anItem)\n    set posixPath to (fileRefURL's |path|()) as text -- get path from file reference\n    display dialog \"Before:\" & return & anItem & return & return & \"After:\" & return & posixPath buttons {\"Cancel\", \"OK\"} default button \"OK\"\nend repeat\n\n", "Q: Unexpected behavior of bash script used to sync dotfiles I'm using essentially this script for keeping my dotfiles under version control. I recently added a snippets folder inside my emacs.d directory and listed it as one of the things that should be symlinked to from my home directory. However, when I run the script now it creates a symlink to snippets inside snippets itself. \nHere's the relevant bit of the script: \n#!/bin/bash\n############################\n# .make.sh\n# This script creates symlinks from the home directory to any desired dotfiles in ~/dotfiles\n############################\n\n########## Variables\n\ndir=~/.dotfiles                    # dotfiles directory\nolddir=~/.dotfiles_old             # old dotfiles backup directory\nfiles=\"bash_profile gitignore gitconfig zshrc jrnl_config emacs.d/init.el emacs.d/custom.el emacs.d/snippets scripts/makeadate.js config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications config/karabiner/karabiner.json\"    # list of files/folders to symlink in homedir\n##########\n\n# create dotfiles_old in homedir\necho -n \"Creating $olddir for backup of any existing dotfiles in ~ ...\"\nmkdir -p $olddir\necho \"done\"\n\n# change to the dotfiles directory\necho -n \"Changing to the $dir directory ...\"\ncd $dir\necho \"done\"\n\n# move any existing dotfiles in homedir to dotfiles_old directory, then create symlinks from the homedir to any files in the ~/dotfiles directory specified in $files\nfor file in $files; do\n    echo \"Moving any existing dotfiles from ~ to $olddir\"\n    mv ~/.$file $olddir\n    echo \"Creating symlink to $file in home directory.\"\n    ln -s $dir/$file ~/.$file\ndone\n\nSo, before running the script, ~/.dotfiles/emacs.d/snippets contains only two subdirectories, latex-mode and mhtml-mode. After running the script, it contains a new symlink to ~/.dotfiles/emacs.d/snippets. I suspect the problem has something to do with the fact that one of the values that the variable $file is taking is a directory. But I don't know exactly what the problem is. \n\nA: If target is an already existing directory, then the command ln -s source target will create a link target/source in that directory, pointing to the original source. That's what's going on here: the directory .emacs.d/snippets/ exists at the start, and you're running the command\nln ~/.dotfiles/.emacs.d/snippets ~/.emacs.d/snippets\n\nwhich creates a link in the existing snippets to the other snippets.\nYou could do ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.emacs.d/snippets/* ~/.emacs.d/snippets instead. Or delete everything in .emacs.d and do ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.emacs.d/* ~/.emacs.d. (Obviously make copies first in case something goes wrong.) Or perhaps even delete .emacs.d and create a new version which is just a symlink.\n", "Q: Would a Pokémon-based app be rejected from the App Store? I’m curious about if an app that would use the name of Pokémon, and using images and sprites from this universe would be rejected or not. My first guess would be yes, even more now that Niantic and The Pokémon Company have released many official Pokémon games.

I have text file with 250,000 lines - and I need to append the same single character at the start of each line. I have tried to use various multiline /column edit plugins in Atom and Sublime but they just hang - I guess due to size of file.\nIs this something I could do with with a bash/zsh script - or AppleScript/Automator maybe ?\n\nA: To prepend X to the start of every line of file, writing to newfile, in Terminal:\nsed 's/^/X/' file > newfile\n\nHere I'm using sed, the Unix stream editor, to use a very simple regular expression to substitute the beginning of every line (the ^ symbol) with an X.\n\nA: The stream editor sed is likely the fastest and sharpest tool built for exactly this task. \nUse the insert command (the newline after \\ is part of the syntax):\nsed 'i\\\nX' file > newfile\n\n\n$ time sed 'i\\                     \nX' line250000 >/dev/null\n\nreal    0m0.118s\nuser    0m0.102s\nsys     0m0.012s\n\nThe delay or overhead for this operation is extremely low making it very efficient for huge files. \n\nA: Prepend each line of a file with a capital A and write a new file-\nawk '{print \"A\"$0}' < FILE > NEWFILE\n\n\nA: This bash snippet will prepend each line of a file with a hash (#) and save it to a new file:\nIFS=$'\\r\\n'; printf '#%s\\n' $(</path/to/file.txt) > /path/to/newfile.txt\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*IFS=$'\\r\\n': This sets the field separator so that only the characters \\r (carriage return) and \\n (newline) are used to delimit a string. The default setting can be restored using: IFS=$' \\t\\n'\n\n*printf: This is a builtin command in bash that is used to format text according to the pattern supplied as the first argument.  In this case, #%s\\n tells it to format every subsequent argument as a regular string (%s), before which it will print a hash character and after which it will print a newline.\n\n*$(</path/to/file.txt): This is a command substitution that uses an input redirection to supply it the contents of a file path.  It's equivalent to $(cat /path/to/file.txt), without having to call out to cat.\n\n*>:  This redirects the output of the previous command, i.e. printf, so that it is written to the file at the specified file path.  If your file paths contain spaces, either escape each space using a preceding backslash (\\), or surround the file path with double quotes, making sure anything you want the shell to expand sits outside of the quotes, e.g. ~/Documents/My\\ Massive\\ File.txt or ~/\"My Massive File.txt\"\n", "Q: Viewing Text Message Histories on Windows PC I have an iPhone 6s, and there are some very, very, long text message conversations on there that I'd like to be able to read through on my PC for the sake of convenience. \nI've already backed up my iPhone to the PC, but the files are stored without a file extension, so I'm not exactly sure how to view them.

This is probably an embarrassingly noobish question.\nI sent a standard SMS text message from my iPhone 6 to a colleague's iPhone, who mentioned that my message was green and not blue, and that meant I hadn't activated something or wasn't using the right app to take advantage of iMessaging.\nCurrently I don't use apps beyond what came with my phone. To send SMS text messages I use the green callout balloon button that's near the phone button.\n\nMy colleague said I could save money by using iMessage instead of paying for each SMS text message. I countered by saying that if it's not SMS then that means I'd have to keep my phone connected to the internet 24/7 to receive messages and I don't do that. \nMy colleague then said something like it does but doesn't use SMS, so I wouldn't have to maintain an internet connection 24/7 to receive prompt iMessages and yet would not have to pay for SMS messages when I did.\nA quick search turns up plenty of tutorials about how to use iMessages but so far I have not found a clear and concise explanation.\nIs it possible to explain in a few clear sentences how the messaging functionality works on my iPhone 6 and when internet is used and when traditional SMS messages are used? For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does it check first for an active internet connection on the sender's phone?\n\n*Does it also check if the recipient is also connected to the internet?\n\n*Could a message go out as an iMessage and then not be delivered even though the recipient could have received an SMS text message?\n\n\nA: \nTo send SMS text messages I use the green callout balloon button that's near the phone button.\n\nYou are using the correct app.\n\nMy colleague said I could save money by using iMessage instead of paying for each SMS text message.\n\nYour colleague is absolutely right. At least in this context. iMessage is Apple's Internet messaging service. You can send an iMessage to anyone who has an Apple device (such as iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac desktop or laptop computer etc.). The requirements is that the recipient must have registered their Apple ID with iMessage service and enabled iMessage. Either of email address (Apple ID) or mobile number (associated with your iPhone) can be registered with iMessage and can be used as sending destination.\nThe same Messages app is used for sending both an iMessage and SMS to contacts and recipients. An SMS is identified with a green bubble while an iMessage is identified with a blue bubble.\nAdditionally, you need not remain online all the time for iMessage to work, if either the sender of receiver is offline (not connected to the Internet), the sent message gets stored on device or Apple's servers respectively, and dispatched as soon as the Internet connectivity is restored (either via Mobile Data or Wi-Fi). It in a way works for how email works. Unlike some other messaging app, there's no concept of user being \"online\" or \"offline\" in iMessage.\nWhen the recipient is either using a non iPhone phone or they don't have their number registered with iMessage service, your text message gets sent as a plain SMS, and all the same restrictions apply (character count, carrier charges). However, iMessage allows you to send text messages, media such as photos and videos and with iMessage apps stickers etc.\nIt's important to note that iMessage is a service available free of cost and is exclusive to Apple ecosystem of devices.\nYou can force an iMessage to be sent as a plain SMS if you suspect the recipient may have their Internet connection (Mobile Data or Wi-Fi) turned off, and you want the message to get across as quickly as possible (as an SMS is sent over cellular network).\n\nIs it possible to explain in a few clear sentences how the messaging functionality works on my iPhone6 and when internet is used and when traditional SMS messages are used?\n\nAnswers below inline:\n\nDoes it check first for an active internet connection on the sender's phone?\n\nNo. Sending iMessage has nothing to do with active connection on recipients end.\n\nDoes it also check if the recipient is also connected to the internet?\n\nNo. The recipient gets the message whenever they turn on Internet on their device. The messages you sent are held on Apple's computers in the meanwhile.\n\nCould a message go out as an iMessage and then not be delivered even though the recipient could have received an SMS text message?\n\nIf a message is sent out as iMessage, it will indeed get delivered (as long as their number is registered with the iMessage service) when the recipient turns on Internet on their device.\nP.S.: I can direct you to this excellent document online officially maintained by Apple, which explains iMessage service and it's features in an easy to understand way.\nMessages for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac\n\nForce Messages app to send a text message as SMS instead of an iMessage\nHere's a workaround that you can use to force the Messages app to send a test message as SMS instead of iMessage to a contact's phone number. It is slight clumsy, but gets the job done in the scenarios like you described:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have Internet access available on your iPhone via either Mobile data or Wi-Fi (indicated by the presence of appropriate icon in the iPhone's status bar), and the receivers contact number is registered with iMessage, you'll only be able to send an iMessage, irrespective of the online/offline status of the recipient. You can check if a message would be sent as an iMessage by the presence of a blue colored upward facing arrow besides your typed text message.\n\n\n*To force the message to be sent as SMS instead, temporarily turn off Mobile Data/Wi-Fi on your iPhone to disable Internet access. You'll still only be able to send an iMessage (Blue arrow icon) as your iPhone knows that the receiver is registered with iMessage. Send the message normally.\nThe message won't get sent from your iPhone due to the absence of an Internet connection. Now tap an hold on the message bubble, and you'll see an alert at the bottom of the screen with an option that says Send as Text Message. This option is not shown when you have Internet connectivity on your iPhone, or the message is already delivered to the Apple's servers.\n\n\n*This will cause your iPhone to re-send the message as SMS. The receiver will be able to get the message even in absence of the Internet connection on their device (as long as they have cellular connectivity on their device).\n\n*Don't forget to turn Mobile Data/Wi-Fi back on on your device to regain access to Internet.\n\nA: I know this is an old thread, but I agree with pkamb's answer. SMS uses the cellular control channels to carry messages. iMessage uses IP (internet protocol=mobile data). That means that SMS is available as long as you have cellular service, and iMessage protocol is available as long as you have internet service. The majority of users have unlimited data plans, and are always connected to the internet, which means if they have a signal, they have both SMS and iMessage services. The exception would be people who have really small data packages and turn off their mobile data to save money. In that case iMessage would automatically fall back to SMS without you needing to do anything on either end. So the automatic fallback to SMS means that there is no disadvantage to using iMessage protocol, as your message will get through, unless the receiving phone has no signal, or is off. And in that case, I find iMessage is better at buffering messages than SMS.\n\nA: uhoh stated, \"what I don't understand is how Apple mixes access to the two totally different services SMS and iMessage in the same window, and how to know ahead of time if, for a given contact, a message is going to go out as SMS or iMessage\"\niMessage requires both the sender and receiver's iPhones to be logged into iCloud with appleid's. This allows apple to see them both and know when the iMessage protocol can be used. If either account gets logged out, or otherwise disabled, maybe due to mobile data being turned off, the conversation is switched to SMS, on the fly. I have had some of my conversations switch from blue to green, and eventually back to blue, because of service issues on the other end. I believe this automatic functionality, along with delivery and read receipts, makes iMessage the superior choice over standard SMS only apps.\nP.S. I have searched, and cannot find a way to determine which protocol is going to be used, when you hit the send button. I do know that if it thinks that it can use iMessage protocol, the send button is blue. But I have had messages turn green after I hit send, apparently because the lack of an iCloud connection at the other end had only registered after message transmission.\n\nA: iMessages are sent via the internet (cellular data or Wi-Fi).\nSMS messages are sent only via cellular service.\niPhones should generally have cellular data service any time they have \"phone\" service. So when you can send an SMS, you should also generally be able to send an iMessage. And same for your recipient immediately receiving them.\n(This of course depends on your phone plans and specific coverage/network issues.)\n\nThis is a perfect use-case for SMS; if their phone is turned on, they'll almost certainly get it within a few minutes. But if we've started to use iMessage then they won't get it until they go home and connect to the internet because I've essentially e-mailed it to them. Have I got the basic idea correct?\n\nYou do not need to be connected to your home Wi-Fi network in order to send iMessages. They are also sent and received via a cellular data plan, on the go, just as conveniently and reliably as SMS.\niMessage is also especially good when you do not have cellular service. If you're ever able to connect to Wi-Fi, you can send and receive iMessages. But not SMS messages, until you get back to cell coverage. This makes iMessage far more reliable for contacting people who live in spotty cell coverage areas.\niMessage offers huge benefits over SMS: cost, encrypted security, messaging features, reception without cellular service, significantly better group messaging, etc.\nUnless there is a specific reason you or your recipient will not have data service on the go, you should use iMessage. The app will fall back to SMS if needed.\n", "Q: Manage iOS automatic connection to public Wi-Fi I use Skype to make some international calls.

Or to force app calling features to use cellular only?\n\nA: Rather than manually managing when you are connected to untrusted WiFi access points, you should consider setting up a VPN connection that is automatically enabled when you connect to WiFi.

I don't know if this is correlated or not. (See screenshot below)\n\n\nA: It could be several things.\n\n\n*\n\n*Runtime corruption - one program (or several) gets things off course or the macOS code has bugs that will get fixed in an update\n\n*Data corruption if this persists across log out / log in and restarts.\n\n*Good code and faulty hardware - less likely but could be the cause if it’s intermittent and never able to resolve with updates over weeks or months.\n\n\nI would triage this by setting up a brand new user account on the Mac, logging out from the one where the bar settings are suspect and then into the newly created empty account.\nShould the bar be missing the default icons, you can conclude that the operating system and the bar software need to be reloaded / reset.\nIf the bar behaves, then it's going to be the settings in your user account that need resetting or fixing.\nSo to answer the main question - it's a corruption in the settings or the controller and the above steps will help you narrow down which path to remediating it you choose.\n\nA: This is a bug and it's not a new issue. There are several remedies for macOS Catalina:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal application and run command killall ControlStrip.\n\n*Open Terminal application and run command sudo pkill TouchBarServer.\n\n\nNot comfortable running commands in Terminal? Use Activity Monitor to quit TouchBarServer.\nBonus: When you're finished open System Preferences > Extensions > Touch Bar > Customize Control Strip... and use it to replace the right-most button (Siri) with Show Desktop for improved privacy. You'll still be able to access Siri from the expanded strip set but will be less likely to activate Siri on accident while you're trying deleting stuff.\n\nA: Rebooting a few times and killing the TouchBarServer process fixed the problem for me. \nI hope this is not a temporary solution and that this condition doesn't happen again.\n", "Q: Can't use zsh shell in Catalina When I opened Terminal after installing Catalina, this appeared:\nThe default interactive shell is now zsh.\nTo update your account to use zsh, please run `chsh -s /bin/zsh`.\nFor more details, please visit https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208050.\n\nSo I copy-pasted the code, it made me enter my password, but nothing happened.\nbash-3.2$ chsh -s /bin/zsh\nChanging shell for HomoErektus.\nPassword for HomoErektus: \nchsh: no changes made\nbash-3.2$ echo $0\nbash\n\nI can't seem to find any answers.

I have an old Panasonic camcorder (model PV-GS35) that uses miniDV. It has a USB port for connecting to a computer. However, I cannot for the life of me get it to connect to my MacBook Pro running Mojave. iMovie does not see the camcorder. I have tried LifeFlix DV Importer and iSkySoft Video Converter. Nothing sees the camcorder. \nI've Googled this to death and cannot find anything that will work. I've also looked here, on StackExchange with no luck. Does anyone have any ideas how I can get video off of the miniDV and into a digital file? Besides a miniDV conversion service? :)\nThanks for any suggestions.\n\nA: It's most likely that the support that was built into macOS (OS X 10.1 through 10.3) is no longer available in current versions of macOS.  From the PV-GS35 User Manual (page 45): \n\n  \n*\n  \n*For Macintosh  OS:  Mac OS X v 10.1 – X v 10.3  CPU: iMac, iBook or Power Book G4, Power Mac G4 or Power Mac G5  RAM:\n   64 MB or more\n  \n*The USB equipment operates with the driver installed as standard in OS.\n\nThe driver is obviously obsolete given that the only listed support is for PPC based Macs. It's a very good bet you're not going to find driver support for Intel based machines.\nUnfortunately, this device doesn't show up as a camera and you will need software to not only extract the images/movies, but to control the camera as well.  I ran into this very same problem with a Sony camcorder and the only way I was able pull the videos off the camcorder via USB (to ensure the highest quality) was to light up a Windows computer, install the software and extract my videos.    The other option is to use a video capture device and get it via the analog input/outputs.\n\nA: As per your reply to my comment:\nYour camcorder has a DV connector, which is nothing else than a 4-pin FireWire port.\nTo connect this to your Mac you need a FireWire 400 4-pin to FireWire 800 cable, something like this: https://www.amazon.com/Bizlander-Firewire-Premium-800-400-MacBook/dp/B01KPZTZNM/ref=sr_1_1\nI haven't ingested tape-based media in years, but according to the built-in help in iMovie, this is supported even in the most recent version. (LifeFlix DV should work as well.)\nFor ingesting, please refer to the manual of the camcorder. It probably has to be set to VTR/VCR mode.\n", "Q: Horizontal scrolling on nedit with trackpad under XQuartz - MacOS Catalina I use sometimes the nedit editor with XQuartz on my MacBook pro.

The active iTunes library\nwould normally have been called iTunes Library.itl though in some\nlegacy systems the .itl extension might be omitted. You can hold down\noption while starting Music (or TV) and then use the Choose Library\noption to access an existing .itl file.

One like those advertised on this link?\nhttps://www.sonnettech.com/product/egpu-breakaway-puck/overview.html\nThere's likely other eGPUs and PCIe breakout boxes that could suffice and offer what you desire with a single Thunderbolt connection.  It would appear that if two Thunderbolt docks is being considered that the cost of an eGPU isn't a deal breaker.  The \"pucks\" offered by Sonnet Tech offer only 60 watts of power to the host computer.  This may be sufficient to keep the MBP charged since they take up the GPU load.  If not there's the option to still keep the number of occupied Thunderbolt ports to two by using the other port for the power supply that came with the computer.\nThe \"puck\" supports four displays with one on the DisplayPort port, one on HDMI, and two on the downstream Thunderbolt port.  There's no Ethernet on the puck but that can be rectified with a USB or Thunderbolt adapter.  A Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter can be plugged directly into the MBP, assuming the puck supplies sufficient power to not need that port for a power supply.  An adapter can be plugged into the downstream Thunderbolt port if only two displays are required.  An Ethernet adapter can potentially use a downstream Thunderbolt port on a display if it has one.  A USB-A Ethernet adapter can be used, but that leaves only one port open for other devices.\nIf this one \"puck\" is leaving someone still searching for ports then a far less expensive USB-C dock can be used on the other MBP port to provide power pass through, additional USB-A ports, and Ethernet.  Many such mini-docks are available to choose from.  One example is Apple's USB-C AV adapter that can provide power pass through, a USB-A port for an Ethernet adapter or other device, and HDMI if the Sonnet puck isn't giving enough video ports.\nhttps://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUF82AM/A/usb-c-digital-av-multiport-adapter\nAnother option, this one with more USB-A ports, Ethernet, and video.\nhttps://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/TCDK10PMHSGD/\nBe aware that having two power supplies to your MBP will not harm it.  The MBP will simply take power from the more powerful power supply, it cannot take power from two at the same time.  Two 60 watt power supplies gives your MBP 60 watts, not 120 watts.\nI mention the eGPU option as it sounds like you are pushing the MBP pretty hard and with an eGPU this takes off some of the load as well as providing all your requirements, or perhaps 80% to 90%, with a single Thunderbolt port.  Any place the eGPU might be lacking is easily rectified by use of the other Thunderbolt port, possibly without needing another dock.\n", "Q: Can \"ld\" add the rpaths automatically to an executable if it can find the needed dylibs at link time? The question is in the title, but anyway, let me explain it a bit more:\nThe most accepted way for correctly defining the install name for a dylib in MacOS is by making it relative to the rpath. For example:\notool -L ./LLVM/7.0.0/lib/libomp.dylib \n./LLVM/7.0.0/lib/libomp.dylib:   \n   @rpath/libomp.dylib (compatibility version 5.0.0, current version 5.0.0)\n   /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1238.50.2)\n\nHere, libomp.dylib has @rpath/libomp.dylib as its install name. So far so good.\nThe problem is when you create an executable linked to such a dylib. Even if you pass the correct -L/path/to/libomp.dylib flag at link time, so that ld can successfully link the executable, then you try to execute it, and obviously you get the following:\ndyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libomp.dylib\n  Referenced from: mydumbexecutable\n  Reason: image not found\nAbort trap: 6\n\nThis of course can be fixed by using install_name_tool on either the dylib (changing its install name so that it doesn't depend on the rpath, and linking the executable again, but this is not considered good practice), or, the recommended way, to use install_name_tool on the executable, adding to it the proper rpath so that the dylib can be found.\nBut... just wondering... isn't there a flag in ld that automatically adds the rpath for you? I mean, if ld is able to link the executable because it did find the dylibs, why cannot automatically store the proper rpath in the executable?\nI understand this should be optional behaviour, as sometimes you prefer to define the rpaths yourself, but... a flag for doing it automatically would make my life a lot easier.\n\nA: The answer to your question is: no, it cannot.\nYour question sounds a lot like an XY problem, so first I would recommend going back and reexamine if this really is your main problem, or there's some higher level problem that is actually the problem, you're trying to solve.\nFirst off, I would note that you do not have to use install_name_tool to set these values after the fact. You can set these while compiling the library and the program. If you're using clang/gcc, you can use the -install_name option. Similar exists for other compilers.\nThe reason that ld doesn't automatically add rpaths according to where it found the dylibs is that this would in general produce a binary that runs on your machine, and your machine only. I.e. it is tailored for your specific installation. This is normally not what you want. You want to produce a binary that others can take and run on their computers.\nIf you're making a \"standard project\" (i.e. like from an Xcode template) with shared libraries, you won't have to fiddle with rpaths or install names. I.e. usually you have the shared libraries placed at standard locations that are search by the dynamic linker by standard, so that you won't have to define anything special.\nHowever, it seems you're wanting to create something very customized for your usage. If you really want to specify that the dylib is at a specific place (because you only want to run it on your own computer, or computers set up like yours) - you can do so by simply specifying an absolute path for it.\nIf you want to create something that can easily be copied to other computers without needing seperate installation of dylibs, you often want to bundle your dylib with the application itself. Then you can use a path relative to the executable by using @executable_path instead of @rpath. \nIn my view @rpath is most helpful when you have multiple applications that are \"loosely connected\" that you would like to share a library that you do not want to place in a system-wide standard location.\n\nA: Sure, just pass -rpath path_to_add in the linker flags to clang. If you're building something for your box only, this is makes your executable work, if that's what's important to you.\n", "Q: Unknown Binary in Application Samples I recently started sampling applications that freeze on my machine.  I have an iMac with 8 cores and 32GB of RAM running Catalina 10.15.1 fully patched.  It's far from resource constrained yet certain applications freeze regularly. I see threads marked as unknown often in the traces.  Are these normal threads?  If so what would make a thread show up as completely unknown in a sample.  It seems strange that the library a thread is linked to could be known in some cases but unknown in others.\n\n\nA: I think you're confused about what parts of the output actually represents threads:\nYes, the threads you see in the output from \"Sample Process\" in Activity Monitor are definitely \"normal threads\".\nHowever, each of the lines in your screenshot do not represent a thread each. \nActivity Monitor clearly labels each seperate thread with the word \"Thread\" - the whole line is in lightly blue color (compared to the rest that is black).\nThe screenshot you have does not indicate that a thread is \"unknown\", nor does it indicate that \"the library a thread is linked to\" is unknown.\nI'll explain how to read the output from \"Sample Process\":\nEach blue line indicates a thread. \nEach black line below the blue line is a function that has been executed by that thread. \nThe percentage indicates how much time was spent inside the function. You can choose when viewing if you want it displayed as a percent of the thread or the parent.\nThe number in the brackets (such as [0x1100007ffd]) is the memory address of the function.\nThe field right next to the percentage is the name of the function, and in parentheses, the binary file from which the original contents on the memory address was loaded.\nHere's why unknowns can appear:\nNote that the name of the function is only available if the function was loaded in from a binary that contained what's known as a \"symbol map\". This makes it possible for the sample program to known that the code at a given memory address was generated from a function with that specific name in the original source code. If you haven't got that information, it is listed as ???.\nTypically you'll see that Objective-C programs will show you these names, while C programs typically won't. The developer of a C program chooses whether or not to expose the names, but for performance/size reasons, these are typically left out in programs meant for \"the public\" (as opposed to internal testing).\nSimilarly the name of the binary file is known only if code in question was loaded in via the actual program binary itself, or by the dynamic linker from a .dylib or similar shared library. If the code at the memory address came to be there for any other reason, the sample program cannot know the name and it is displayed as unknown. \nIn addition you'll often see that programs that internally employ dynamic languages, JIT compilers, interpreters, etc. will show up as \"??? (in unknown binary)\" in these listings. This is because the code at that specific location wasn't there from the start - it was generated dynamically by the program as it executed.\nWord explanation:\nIf you do not know the meaning of the word thread, an rough, high-level explanation is as follows:  \nThink of a CPU as a machine that executes instructions in a sequence. The current state of the CPU itself is the contents of the registers (internal memory locations inside the CPU that are seperate from RAM) as well as the program counter (the address of the instruction currently being executed). Each time an instruction is executed, the registers can be changed by the computation, and the PC is set to a new address. Typically the PC is set to address of the next instruction in memory, but it can change arbitrarily.  In this view, the CPU executes a single program.\nIn order to (seemingly) run multiple programs at the same time, the system is setup so that CPU executes a single program as described above, but at various times \"switches program\" by saving its state (registers and PC) to RAM, and loading in another state. Thereafter it is now executing at a different place in memory. By \"switching\" back and forth between these programs, you get the illusion of running multiple programs at the same time.\nEach of these \"programs\" are actually what is known as a thread. So a thread is essentially just a saved state consisting of the values of registers and the program counter, which the operating system continually saves and restores.\nIn comparison, a \"process\" is what you observe as a running instance of an application - i.e. the whole thing you're sampling in Activity Monitor). The concept is very similar to a thread in that the operating system allows for running multiple processes at a time by continually saving/restoring state, whereby switching between processen. A process can have one or more threads, so part of switching between process is actually switching between threads as describe above. However more state is being saved/restored, as for example memory mapping are also saved/restored. This is the reason that threads within the same process can (in general) access the same memory, whereas different processes (in generally) cannot access each other's memory. \nNote that in real life things are much more complicated. A system can contain multiple cores and multiple CPUs, meaning that you have multiple sets of registers and program counters at the same time. Threads will also have various attributes that are not described here.\n", "Q: Double Erased my 64GB flash drive, but failed both. How to fully erase it again and make it work? TL;DR I formatted an USB drive on my AndroidTV which failed, and am now trying to fix it from my Mac. Right now I can see the drive in diskutil list but it neither shows up in Finder nor in Disk Util. How can I reformat the drive so I can access it again?\n\nSo I've had this Samsung Bar 64GB flash drive, bought online. I'm a design guy, and I've seen the packaging, it looks pretty neat and legit to me. But can't confirm if this is really manufactured by Samsung. \nFollow me along and please bear with me with this quite long story of how we got here. The flash drive is once working tonight, and now it can't be both detected and shown on Finder and Disk Utility app, but when listed on Terminal on diskutil list, it still does shows. Please follow along if I did anything stupid on any of these actions, and is there any way I could recover/re-erase my flash drive again. This is quite expensive and I don't want to buy another again any time soon. I want this to be an educational and lesson to me again on Pros and Cons of formatting disks on Mac, and what I should and shouldn't do, I'm mostly a Windows guy all my life, and I'm new to Mac and I am still unfamiliar on some things so maybe that's also part of it.\nSo my intention is, to watch movies on that flash drive, but for some reasons, the format I choose when I formatted it on my Mac, first time plugging in is exFAT, the thing is our Android TV box doesn't support that so I tried formatting it there: \n\n\n*\n\n*But since it's just a low level computer, for some reasons when I\nswitched inputs on HDMI, it looks like while formatting that 64GB\nflash drive (for that big, I thought it'll be longer than usual) it\nforced stopped, so I ended up with unreadable flash drive on Android.\n\n*Plugged it in on Mac, it still can be shown and read on Disk Utility\nand Finder, I formatted it into MS-DOS (FAT), I assume it actually\nformat it as FAT32, as it says that's the most universal file system,\nAndroid, Mac and Windows supports. It finished, but when moving back\nfiles to it, it is incredibly noticeably slow, that at some point it\ngot stuck copying just a 200MB file, I figured maybe it's because of\nthe buffer files from the previous exFAT format, so figured out that\nI should do deep format, so on Erase on Disk Utility > Advanced\nOptions > I amped the settings to the 7 pass.\n\n*The problem is suddenly, the power went out, but this Mac is already\nold. This is 2011 MacBook Air running Catalina, and got very fragile\nbattery. While the electricity is out, I figured it'll never finish\non this pace, and I'll run out of battery on this very fragile Mac\nbattery, also this Mac always throttles performance because of the\nfragile battery so I figured, it'll not finish anyways without being\nplugged in, so rather than ran out of battery, I'll just force quit\nthe 7 pass Erase on Disk Utility. I did it.\n\n*For some reasons, I can still access the drive on the Finder, and I\ntried copying back that 200MB file again, it got stucked again so forced quit the copying again\n\n*and power went back, checked and replug it again, this time it can't be shown on the Finder and the GUI Disk Utility app, but when you run diskutil list on Terminal, it still shows\nLast login: Sun Nov 24 21:13:24 on console\n\nThe default interactive shell is now zsh.\nTo update your account to use zsh, please run `chsh -s /bin/zsh`.\nFor more details, please visit https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208050.\nSteves-MacBook-Air:~ steven$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         250.8 GB   disk0s2\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +250.8 GB   disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume Mac - Data              70.5 GB    disk1s1\n   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 24.7 MB    disk1s2\n   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                711.9 MB   disk1s3\n   4:                APFS Volume VM                      1.1 GB     disk1s4\n   5:                APFS Volume Mac                     10.9 GB    disk1s5\n\n/dev/disk2 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *63.5 GB    disk2\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1\n   2:       Microsoft Basic Data SMSNG 64GB              63.2 GB    disk2s2\n\nSee the last part, I think I messed it up that I did two failed erase, that Mac tried to reformat, make new volume of 63 GB when the total capacity of the flash drive, is basically just 64GB.

After you have formatted the drive there is nothing left over - i.e. you do not have to worry about \"buffer files from exfat\" - cannot happen. \nSimilarly the diskutil listing is in no way any indication of \"earlier attempts\" or parts of a \"7-pass format\" - doesn't exist, cannot happen. There's absolutely no need for doing a 7-pass wipe either - it won't help anything at all compared to a single wipe. The big part you seem to be missing is that the drive is both partioned and formatted: \nTo explain: those two are not the same thing. It is very common for USB pen-drives to be just \"formatted\" - i.e. there's no partition table on it. This makes it easy to handle for low-level software like for example something you might use on an Android TV. In addition, your partition table is a relatively new kind of partitioning table - namely a GUID partition table (GPT). Some older or low-level stuff might only support an older type of table, knows as an MBR (Master Boot Record). Lastly, such a device might not support multiple partitions on the same USB pen drive, as you have.\nMy advise to you is to either (a) not have a partition table at all, and format the whole drive as FAT32 - or (b) create an MBR partition table with a single partition formatted as FAT32. Note that FAT32 has a limitation on file size, which means that you cannot store files larger than approx. 4 GB. If you want to store larger files, you'll have to divide them up. ExFAT doesn't have this limitation, but you indication that your box doesn't support it. \nThe first option (a) can be accomplished by first erasing the disk (as you indicate you have already done), and then running the following command in the Terminal:\nsudo newfs_msdos -F 32 -v MYDISK /dev/disk2\n\nYou can do the latter option (b) by running the following command in the Terminal:\nsudo diskutil eraseDisk FAT32 MYDISK MBRFormat /dev/disk2\n\nBEWARE: It is very important to check that your USB pen drive is in fact disk2 before you run any of these commands!\n\nA: I consider all flash storage like USB/SD to be suspect and slower speeds, so you might need to let the zero run for hours. That being said, You don’t need anything more fancy than Disk Utility to erase an SD card on macos. Your diskutil commands also are fine to erase things when the hardware is working. You also did nothing wrong with your commands to use the product - I would have tested the same as you.\nI would try one last time using Disk Utility - perhaps looking over the log for any errors while you erase it.\nI use a tool to check SD cards as they tend to fail at a high rate for me and occasionally I’ll buy some that should be good and are not. The counterfeits are quite excellent from time to time and even the best of the best can fail.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://twocanoes.com/products/mac/sd-clone/\nThe logical conclusion when you fail to verify the full size of the disk is it’s either counterfeit (only has 8 GB of space but was sold as 64) or has failed and you can seek warranty replacement / exchange from the vendor if you are covered by consumer protections.\n", "Q: What is a good replacement for the 'df' command that is broken on macOS Mojave? The 'df' has been my tool of choice to investigate how much free space I have on my disk. But with APFS, TimeMachine local snapshots and all that, it has become unreliable.\nI.e. after removing a lot of files and folders, thus freeing up 100GB, it is of course not yet freed up as it is still part of TimeMachine's local snapshots (I really wish Apple would return to us the possibility to turn local snapshots off, it plays havoc with your control over storage use and it comes with risks). Commands like tmutil deletelocalsnapshots 2019-11-23-180038 seem not to delete anything, as the local snapshot keeps being listed.\nOnly Storage of System Information now says there is 100GB extra free space. df still reports the space is not free, so Storage of System Information apparently has access to underlying info that makes it report 'virtual free space'.\nDeleting local snapshots doesn't do a thing, it seems:\nbash-3.2# tmutil listlocalsnapshotdates\nSnapshot dates for all disks:\n2019-11-23-180038\n2019-11-23-192007\n2019-11-23-210050\n2019-11-23-220637\n2019-11-24-100307\n2019-11-24-110637\n2019-11-24-122648\n2019-11-24-165006\nbash-3.2# tmutil deletelocalsnapshots 2019-11-23-180038\nDeleted local snapshot '2019-11-23-180038'\nbash-3.2# tmutil listlocalsnapshotdates\nSnapshot dates for all disks:\n2019-11-23-180038\n2019-11-23-192007\n2019-11-23-210050\n2019-11-23-220637\n2019-11-24-100307\n2019-11-24-110637\n2019-11-24-122648\n2019-11-24-165006\n\nTo be honest, I just want to be able to simply free up space and really have it freed up, not linger around in local snapshots. Is that at all possible? Why does Apple makes this simple task so incredibly hard?\n\nA: The new command to purge snapshots is seriously faster and more well engineered than the previous local store. \nIt does require a new syntax, so you’re correct, Apple has forced us to learn more and change. \nJoshua was in your situation as well and has a very detailed explanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to thin your local Time Machine Snapshots on macOS High Sierra\nApple tools take a while to classify what’s purgeable, but that is getting better. \n\n\n*\n\n*macOS not showing the actual free space\n\n*Why do system information and du show drastically different numbers\nIf you don’t see immediate clearing of space, it’s a sign your disk has accounting issues and you need to boot to internet recovery or plain recovery on an external drive and repair the wrapper and container. \n\n\n*\n\n*APFS/High Sierra - `tmutil deletelocalsnapshots` not deleting snapshots\n\nA: The other answer was mostly correct (see my comment), but I'm going to give my own simple answer here, for one because my answer comes from Mojave, not High Sierra, experience.\nWhile I was unable to delete local snapshots by using the specific tmutil 'delete' command, they were mostly deleted by the tmutil 'thinning command.\nI started with df reporting 63GB free and System Information reporting 160GB free. A 100GB difference.\nI executed tmutil thinlocalsnapshots / 9999999999 1. That removed all but one of my local snapshots and made df report 30GB more free. It might be necessary in some circumstances to thin more.\nThen I was able to remove the last local snapshot with tmutil deletelocalsnapshots and after that df reported 167GB free, while System Information reported 186GB free, a 19GB difference. That is within tolerable differences for me.\nIn other words, what seems not to be the case so far is that the unability to remove localsnapshots means you have a corruption. After thinning, the localsnapshot could be removed. Of course, that still can mean there is a corruption and that thinning is more robust than deleting.\n", "Q: How to upgrade SSD from HDD for my mac book pro My mac book pro(13 inch mid 2012) has become very slow and I approached apple service centre they found out my HDD has become faulty and that's the reason , my laptop is very slow. \nUnfortunately HDD is expensive than SSD and SSD is much faster.But apple won't do HDD to SSD replacement while they're ready to do HDD to HDD replacement.\nI bought a brand new SSD for my macbook pro and I bought a screw driver set.\nCan anyone suggest me things I should be aware of while doing the following things ?\n\n\n*\n\n*While unpacking my laptop ( I read some static electricity will be there and can cause short circuit or do I have to drain my battery before unpacking or just switched off mac book pro is fine )\n\n*While replacing HDD with SSD( Do I have to buy any SATA cable or SATA to IDE converter or something )\n\n*While installing the new OS on the new SSD.( Not sure how to do this though).\n\n\nAny help is appreciated\nFYI:\nI have backed up all my data in external Hard drive and I don't want to keep the HDD anymore.

This will let you connect the new SSD to the Mac, so that you can copy the contents from the hard drive to the SSD. You need to use cloning apps: either SuperDuper! or Carbon Copy Cloner to do this. \nIf you have a Time Machine backup, you may be able to restore this to the new drive by booting to Recovery (command R) and then restoring the backup.\nThen swap the drives, and you can still use the HDD as a temporary external drive with the SATA cable.\n\nA: Always install the OS and test your SSD externally before you take out a working HDD / SSD.\n\n\n*\n\n*Can Recovery Mode install OS X onto a blank SSD?\nThen you know you have a working system before you install it internally.

However, when I manually delete the folder it comes back after some time.\nIs there any way to stop the automatical creation of the ~/Movies/TV folder?\n\nA: Short answer? Yes and no.\nYou can tell TV.app to change where it will store its library by opening the app, going into preferences and then under Advanced choosing a new location. This may not move the current folder, but will create a new one in a location that you prefer, so you can freely get rid of the one under ~/Movies/TV.\nHowever, if you don't have a TV.app library, and never open the app, then once you delete the folder it should stay gone. Of course if you do open the app, it will be recreated, this may also occur if you enable home-sharing for that account, even if you're only sharing music.\n\nA: Open Finder, right click on Movies on the sidebar, and then go to \"Get Info\". Lock the folder from there. Unlocking is the simply unchecking that box.

Most parts of the file system are mounted read-only.\nRemoval of files - if possible at all - is more or less alphabetical. In my test it started in /Applications, continued in /Library, /System, /System/Volumes/Data (and all subdirs like the \"Users\" folder) and finally finished in /usr/local.\n\nIf you have a normal Time Machine backup simply restore the last snapshot.\nIf you don't have Time Machine backup but localsnapshots enabled you will be able to restore the previous state of your Mac.\nLocal snapshots will be listed with the command:\ntmutil listlocalsnapshots /\n\nYou can restore your Mac either by doing everything manually (i.e. get snapshot name, make a temporary folder, mount the snapshot with mount_apfs there and restore everything with a lengthy and error-prone tmutil restore ... command.\nThe alternative way is the Time Machine GUI in Recovery Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot to Recovery Mode (cmd-R while booting)\n\n*Choose \"Restore from Time Machine Backup\" in macOS Utilities and hit continue\n \n\n*Restore from Time Machine chit-chat and continue\n\n\n*Choose the name of your main system volume (here System, usually Macintosh HD) and continue\n\n\n*Choose the last snapshot before issueing the fatal rm command and continue.

It's a workaround, for a broken experience and promise. Lots of people post this as a fix. It's not. Imagine Apple advertising their headphones like this - \"Enjoy bluetooth music and talking with your iPhone, iPad, and MacBook*(quality will be significantly degraded when using bluetooth microphone). That would be a joke, but it's actually what is happening. When people buy bluetooth headphones, they want to listen AND talk with them, not switch to a MacBook internal microphone. To be fair, all of my bluetooth headphones have this issue. You can see in the Audio MIDI app that bluetooth input is set in stone to use a lower quality. I even tried a tutorial I found online where the person said that changing the bluetooth plist file would fix it, but I tried it and no fix. For whatever reason, Apple choose to set the bluetooth input to the lowest possible quality on a MacBook.. but that's not the case for iPad and iPhone. So why is it like this on a MacBook? Apple?

I have an iPhone XS (bought brand-new, About section says limited warranty until 14 april 2020, the date I bought it) running iOS 13.2.3 When I took it out of the box it was running iOS 12 and I enrolled to iOS 13 on beta 6 and I kept updating betas when they came out. My battery is now on 90% of health which seems an excessive wear-off for 7 months. My charging habits are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*One hour in the morning via CarPlay (after being left overnight a bit over 20%)\n\n*One hour in the afternoon via CarPlay (usually being between 30% and 70% due to the daily use)\n\n*Almost never left charging overnight (except one or two times but definitely not something repetitive)\n\n*Almost never left battery completely empty (as above, except one or two times)\n\n*For two or three months I used a wireless charger during the morning and I ocassionally do if I use the phone a bit more\n\n*I scarcely play games in the phone (say one or two times a month, while charging. The phone heats more than usual but it seems normal to me)\n\n*I use my phone for navigation, calls, social media, photography and messaging apps, with some apps doing background work to upload photos. iOS backup to iCloud is disabled (although I back up via iTunes weekly or more frequent)\n\n*I do not expose my phone to extreme temperature changes\n\n*The phone averages 30 hours of screen on per week\n\n*I use the original cable and two other ones that I bought from Amazon which claim to be \"made for iPhone\": one is Amazon basics and the other one is third party, the price made me think it is legit. However, I charge the phone the most while on CarPlay which is done with the original, shipped within the box. Those two cables are used almost exclusively on weekends.\n\n\nI should mention that during a span of two weeks or so I updated to iOS 13.2.2 that shipped a bug which depleted the battery faster than normal (in adittion to the two charges, I had to add a third one in between because the phone dropped 30% overnight in airplane mode, which was fixed in iOS 13.2.3)\nI do not believe this wear-off pattern is normal. Is there something in the listed above (which seems normal to me) killing my battery? \nEDIT: adding battery info as reported by iBackupBot\n\n\nA: No, there's nothing in that list which is \"killing\" your battery. The battery degrades during normal use - that's not preventable and to be expected. \nBatteries are not all alike. Some degrade faster than others - you cannot say that the battery capacity shrinks x.xx% per year in general and expect that exact number on every phone.\nApple states that the battery is designed to retain up to 80% of its original capacity at 500 complete charge cycles under normal conditions. You're still well above 80%.\nHaving 90% capacity after 222 charge cycles seems to be quite alright - i.e. it is likely that you’ll be at approx. 80% percent after 500 charge cycles. \n", "Q: How to debug kernel panic on macOS Catalina, as Catalina is on Read-only File system Facing kernel panic on accessing \"Offline\" attribute of SMB protocol in our custom kext.

If I am looking at the only the 13\" MacBook Pros of the 2019 lineup, I see that Apple offers different (non-overlapping) CPU choices depending on whether I start out with the 2-port or 4-port base model.\nFor example, the 2-port model has these choices:\n\n1.4GHz quad‑core 8th‑generation Intel Core i5 processor, Turbo Boost up to 3.9GHz\n1.7GHz quad‑core 8th‑generation Intel Core i7 processor, Turbo Boost up to 4.5GHz\n\nWhile the 4-port model has these:\n\n2.4GHz quad‑core 8th‑generation Intel Core i5 processor, Turbo Boost up to 4.1GHz\n2.8GHz quad‑core 8th‑generation Intel Core i7 processor, Turbo Boost up to 4.7GHz\n\nPicking the better CPU in the 2-port model turns out to cost the same as getting the lesse CPU in the 4-port model (if RAM and SSD are chosen at equal size respectively).\nIs there a particular reason why the i7 as a much larger range of GHz (both at the low and high end of the scale)?\nAre the number of virtual or actual cores the same in all these cases?\nIs there a way to decide which one of these CPUs is better suited for a workload (in my case, software development, compiling, running VMs etc.), and also for general \"snappiness\"? Are there, for example, major architectural differences between the 2-port and 4-port MacBooks-pro's which are the reason for the non-overlapping CPU choice?\n\nA: The reason why the i7 has a larger range in GHz is essentially that this is what you're paying for when you buying the i7 model. I.e. these CPUs can go faster than the i5 at certain workloads in certain scenarios. \nAll the CPUs are quad-core, and all support Hyper-Threading. So the number of virtual cores are the same, and the number of actual cores are the same in all the cases.\nThere are no major architectural differences between the CPUs. \nThe main difference between the CPUs for the 2-port version and the 4-port version is that the 2-port versions has 15W CPUs and the 4-port version has 28W CPUs. As these CPUs are all 8th gen Intel Core CPUs within the same family, this usually means that the CPUs in the 4-port version can sustain high performance for a longer duration of time before running a thermal problem (given that the thermals are designed for the TDP of the CPU). \nA smaller difference between them is that the integrated GPU is slightly better with each step.\nIn terms of i5 versus i7 a difference is that the i5 models have 6 MB cache whereas the i7 models have 8 MB cache.\nIn terms of which one is better suited for a specific workload or general snappiness, you'll probably be safe to assume that the more expensive option is better than the cheaper option.

It might delete all of your files. Make sure you have a backup.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [[ $# -lt 2 ]] ; then\n    echo \"Scipt requires two arguments:\"\n    echo \"Argument 1.

I would do this :\n$ sudo rm -Rf ~/Desktop\n$ sudo ln -s ~/Dropbox/Desktop ~/Desktop\n\nAnd the symlink was replaced by a new folder at the next reboot.\n\nAs other users experimented (here and here), it turns out we can not lock a symlink anymore in macOS, the option is greyed out.\nI found 2 solutions to this issue : \n\n\n*\n\n*Lock the parent folder (your home folder, /Users/you/) but this will prevent you from adding/deleting files there (source)\n\n*Disable completely iCloud Drive in System Preferences > Apple ID (Keeping it enabled with \"Desktop & Documents Folders\" uncheck does not do the trick) \n\nA: I have another solution to overcome the problem of greyed locked checkbox:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo rm -Rf ~/Desktop\n\n*sudo ln -s ~/Dropbox/Desktop ~/Downloads/Desktop\n\n*Using the Finder, select ~/Downloads/Desktop icon, select Get info from File menu, and click the Locked checkbox (it is not greyed out!).\n\n*Using the Finder, copy ~/Downloads/Desktop icon to ~/ (home) folder.\n\n*Delete ~/Downloads/Desktop symlink.\n\n\nYou can use another folder instead of ~/Downloads. And you can do the same to have a Documents symlink pointing to ~/Dropbox/Documents.\n", "Q: Creating Automatic Period local backup of folder So I want to create automatic backups of my home folder without connecting an external disk. This definitely seems like a feature that the mac should have. I understand that if you have Time Machine set up, then it will make local backups as space permits. Well thats exactly what I want. But you need an external disk in order to activate time machine at all. \nI don't have an external disk right now. What I can't understand is why I can't just have it make local backups as space permits without connecting an external drive? Since I don't own an external drive there is no way for me to \"turn on\" time machine. Does anyone know a way I can?\nThe best case scenario is that I could select one or a few folders to backup, not the entire file system.\nThe reason for this is that I am programmer, and I move around a lot, and I'm always working on the command line. Working on code in specific work folders. Code files are generally not huge, and I am not wanting to backup every file on my computer, but only my important files that I've worked on many hours. While I try to be as careful as possible and use version control, sometimes I make a mistake and it would be great to just have a local backup of, say, yesterday's file system, or any recent backup.\nThanks.\nMacbook Pro 2018 Mojave\n\nA: If you want a local backup you can run a bash script that creates an archive of your home directory.\nzip -r pathToBackup.zip /Users/username\n\nThis can be expanded upon with bash to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add password protection and encryption with the --encrypt option\n\n*Run automatically at certain times with cron\n\n*Append timestamps to name of backup file\n\n*Keep only a certain number of backups\n\n*etc...\n\n\nA: Even without having configured Time Machine, you can manually create a localsnapshot with the command tmutil snapshot. So setting up a scheduled task to run this command should be straightforward.\nThere's no point or need to specify which folders to backup: like TM, snapshots only record the changes made to the disk. So if you work on a handful of files, only those files will take up space. (Even the first snapshot doesn't duplicate all your files, it's just an archive of the file catalog.)\nOf course, it's worth pointing out that saved versions on the same disk are NOT a backup. Because if your storage volume fails, or the data somehow gets over-written, or your laptop gets stolen, catches fire, etc: you've got nothing.\n\nA: You could use rsync and append a suffix with the date and time as described in this SO answer Use rsync for backup without overwrite\nFor example (you would change the source and destination directories)\nrsync -aE --backup --suffix=`date +'.%F_%H-%M'` ~/Documents/WantedFiles/ ~/Documents/Backup/\n\nThis will copy everything (including extended attributes which is the Eswitch) from \n~/Documents/WantedFiles/ to ~/Documents/Backups/\nThe first time files are copied they do not have suffixes.\nA1398% mkdir ~/Documents/WantedFiles\nA1398% touch ~/Documents/WantedFiles/File1\nA1398% touch ~/Documents/WantedFiles/File2\nA1398% rsync -aE --backup --suffix=`date +'.%F_%H-%M'` ~/Documents/WantedFiles/ ~/Documents/Backup/\nA1398% ls -la ~/Documents/Backup/\ntotal 0\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 hali  staff  128 Nov 25 19:09 .\ndrwx------+ 27 hali  staff  864 Nov 25 19:09 ..\n-rw-r--r--   1 hali  staff    0 Nov 25 19:09 File1\n-rw-r--r--   1 hali  staff    0 Nov 25 19:09 File2\n\nIf you change a file and rerun rsync the existing file will be renamed with date and time appended and the new file copied.

Thank you for your help. \nI've been trying to achieve this by Ukulele app, but I don't understand this app or I'm doing something wrong. \n\nA: I've not heard of Ukulele and it wasn't in the top ten search results on DuckDuckGo.  So, allow me to recommend another third-party piece of software, which is open-source, well-established, powerful, reasonably intuitive, and widely known and popular in its use with developers and \"power users\".\nKarabiner Elements is stable in and updated for macOS Catalina. \nMost keyboard mappings will be achieved using the GUI in a pretty straight-forward interface.  For complex mappings, there's a configuration file you can edit which uses JSON (Karabiner .json Reference Manual).\nYours are classified as simple modifications, e.g. ⇧ᴿ ⥱ ↑, so can be created straight in the GUI.

server in Catalina does not work.\nThere are two enabler apps that I know about:\niVPN says that the server in Catalina does not reliably accept connections and the solution is to wait for Apple to fix it (or use Mojave).\nVPN Enabler also says that it does not work in Catalina and the author is trying to develop an easy to use OpenVPN server.  In the meantime, use Mojave.\nA different approach is to use a firewall product like pfSense running on another device or in a virtual machine and enable its VPN server capability.  This is not an easy solution!\n\nA: Someone above mentioned the author of VPN Enabler creating a solution for Catalina, and it's out in beta now. Free for now. Haven't had a chance to test it, but might be worth your time:\nhttps://cutedgesystems.com/software/openvpnenablerforcatalina/\n", "Q: Files in Desktop cannot be edited in macOS Catalina I cannot open, change, edit, write, or read any of the files in my desktop. \nI have pictures on my desktop but when I attempt to open them, this error appears: \"The file “FileName” couldn’t be opened.\"\nSame with documents and other text files.\nThis includes files in subdirectories underneath Desktop as well.\nAll the permissions of Desktop and read and write, in terminal I can move and edit text files, but I cannot do it within the UI itself.\nModel Name: MacBook Pro.\nModel Identifier:   MacBookPro14,1.\nProcessor Name: Dual-Core Intel Core i5. \nProcessor Speed: 2.3 GHz.\nmacOS Catalina 10.15.1\n\nA: Go to your home folder and highlight the desktop folder, then press Cmd-I. Untick the \"lock\" box if it is ticked.\n", "Q: Remote access forbidden but localhost works with Apache I followed this tutorial and the Apache server works locally. http://localhost/~user/ works but remotely http://my-ip/~user I get:\nForbidden.\nYou don't have permission to access this resource.\n\nNote that I am using the same computer. It used to work with Mojave. How can I fix this?\n\nA: By following the tutorial, you have created the file /etc/apache2/users/username.conf which contains the following:\n<Directory \"/Users/username/Sites/\">\nAllowOverride All\nOptions Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks\nRequire host localhost\n</Directory>\n\n(note that you've replaced \"username\" with your actual username)\nIf you want to allow the public access to the folder, change it to look as follows:\n<Directory \"/Users/username/Sites/\">\nAllowOverride All\nOptions Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks\nRequire all granted\n</Directory>\n\nNote that the \"Require\" line was changed to \"Require all granted\".\n", "Q: Credentials format to login into Windows Domain? How do I login into a Windows based server from a Mac ? domain\\username or domain/username or just username ? Nothing seems to be working so far, is there any other way ? Thank you.\n\nA: Generally speaking logging onto a windows domain from a Mac takes the form of:\n[DOMAIN]\\[USERNAME]\n[PASSWORD]\n\nso if I were a user in the Microsoft Active Directory domain with the username of johnny.appleseed and my password was 1234qWer, that would look like\nmicrosoft\\johnny.appleseed\n1234qWer\n\nNote that the username and the password are not case sensitive I generally use all lowercase for simplicity's sake.\nNote that you must have a username assigned to you in the domain with the necessary permissions on the target server for that particular login/username. Without that it will never work.\nIf the target (Windows) server is not domain-joined then you would use the name of the computer (sometimes called the NETBIOS name) on the network in place of the domain.

Can then the PD socket be used to supply more power to the dock? Can a new USB C dock like this for example:\nUSB C dock with Power Delivery\nbe connected and work with an old Macbook (or other USB A gen 2.0 or 3.0 computer) using an adapter like in the picture for example?\n\nIf so:\nCan I then connect a power adapter, e.g. \"Apple 61w usb-c power adapter\" or a regular smartphone USB C power adapter to the PD port on the USB C dock to deliver power to the dock so as the dock now becomes a powered usb hub? (I know it'll not charge the old Mac though. A powered dock/hub is required for more power-hungry devices like several external HDD.)\n[I'm concerned that the new dock may damage the old USB A port, especially when the power adapter is connected to the PD port so as the dock tries to send power to the old USB A. For new USB C it detects when the port \"wants\" to get power and it'll also power the devices connected to the dock along with the computer. The intention with the old Macbook is to power only the dock and the connected peripherals]\nThanks!\n\nA: The new dock will not damage your old USB A port. USB is backwards compatible, so connecting an USB 3 dock to a USB 2 (or older) system is not going to damage anything.\nThe old USB A plug does not support what is known as \"Alternate Mode\" in USB Type-C. Therefore you'll not be able to get the HDMI port on the dock working.\nIn theory, the USB related functionality such as the built-in 2 port USB hub, and the SD/TF-card reader will be able to function with your converter plug. However, if you connect it to a USB 2.0 computer, you will ofcourse not get USB 3.0 ports or speed on the dock. \nThe type-C PD connector on the dock will not enable you to power the old MacBook Pro via the USB A plug, as it does not support the same type of power delivery as USB type-C.\nWhether or not the hub in the dock gets powered by the way of the type-C PD plugin depends on how exactly that Novoo hub is designed. I don't think it is likely to work, as a 61W USB-C power adapter is working at 20V (~3A) - while the USB hub inside the dock is usually powered at 5V. \n\nA: Please do not use the adapters pictured for anything, they violate the USB specification and run the risk of shorting out your power supply.  This could be quite dangerous and expensive.\nSince your computer has a USB-A port then find a dock with an attached USB-A cable.  If you need HDMI output from your dock then there's still options, but they will likely cost more than the USB-C docks because they have more electronics in them to make it work.  This is because USB-C supports passing through video natively and USB-A does not.  Even if you were successful in connecting the dock with the adapters you've shown, and not start a fire, the HDMI port will not work.\nThere is a reason the dock has a USB-C connector and not a USB-A connector.  This being that the USB-C connector has more wires in it, those wires are needed to support the HDMI output.  There are USB-A docks with HDMI output but they will cost at least twice as much because they have a graphics chip in them and this dock does not.\nDon't do it.\n", "Q: cannot see log items for connected ipad in console I have attached an iPad to my MacBook and I made the iPad trust the MacBook.\nI've opened up the Console application where I can see both my MacBook and the iPad, but I am only seeing messages come through for my MacBook - the iPad has a little triangle containing an exclamation mark next to it and an empty message log.

In the APFS container it is installed within, an APFS volume for the OS is created alongside an APFS volume for your data. The former is mounted read-only at the root of the filesystem, and the latter is mounted within /System/Volumes.\nDirectories containing writable data are linked from the read-only volume to the data volume, to form one apparent disk.

This client is using Apple Business Manager and wants us to publish to it.\nI have built the app and deployed it for review to the Apple Connect.  It passed and I see it is now in the client's Apple Business Manager account.\nHere is where I am confused.  Our client DOES NOT have a MDM. How can I use Apple Business Manager in this case?  \nFrom the apple site (https://developer.apple.com/business/custom-apps/), it says \"Alternatively, organizations can choose to provide redemption codes to authorized users to download the app on the App Store.\".\nHow do redemption codes work?\nHow does our client use redemption codes to download our app from the app store?\nOur client simply wants its employees (1000+ employees) to download the app that we built (whitelabelled to the client obviously). \nDoes the client have to add each of its users device UIDD's to its ABM? (which would be ridiculous)!  \nHow do these VPP codes work then? \nHow do they redeem these codes on the Apple App Store, and therefore install the app on their device?\n\nA: I am also using Apple Business Manager for my company but we have an MDM also with it. However, on your question, I think you have to go through the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in to your Apple Developer Account connect your App to the client’s Apple Business Manager account by adding their Organization ID and Company Name for distribution. See the highlighted blue area below.\n\n\n\n\n\n*This connection is immediate. Once your App is connected to the client’s Apple Business Manager Account, it will be visible under the Custom App section of the ABM account.\n\n*By selecting that custom app, you can generate 1-time use redemption codes and links for employees to download your app.\n\nOnce the codes are created, you can download the list.\n\nYou can use these codes and proprietary processes to enable your client’s employees to access your application. \n\nA: Your customer logs into Apple Business Manager, find the app - and then choose \"Redemption Codes\" from the \"License Type\" drop-down. Then they can input that they want 1000 codes and click buy. They'll get a spreadsheet with all the codes and direct links for installation.\nThe process is also described by Apple here: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/apple-business-manager/asmc21817890/web\nThe end user either opens the link on the device, or uses the redemption code in the App Store using the \"Redeem Gift Card or Code\" button.\nYour customer does not need to enter UIDDs. It's not ridiculous.\nVPP codes are codes generated through the Volume Purchase Program for bulk purchases of an app. You do not need to concern yourself with VPP here.\nJust so you're aware: It sounds a bit odd to have 1000 employees with phones wanting to use internal apps, and then not be running a MDM.

I keep cleaning it once any file goes to it even though I have it set to clean automatically. I just deleted an important file thanks to this habit. I’d like to modify things so I can save myself from the practice of quickly emptying trash.\nIs there a way to hide the trash can from the dock? \n\nA: I apologize since I didn't test this solution (not certain if it works on macOS Catalina), but I really think Arturo deserves an answer whether people agree with the goal or not\nI find the attitude that \"the Designer is always right\" - that seems so pervasive in the Apple community - unconstructive. In my opinion sometimes - arguably rarely - users know what they are doing, and they definitely always have the right to experiment and mess things up if they want to. E.g. to find solutions to the numerous edge cases that were intentionally neglected (as a trade-off) or not conceived of by the Designers. There are additional reasons (like non-aligned goals for the users and Designers) but this is not a TED talk.\n\nCopy-pasted (with light editing) from original answer by Minimal Mac:\n\nHOW TO HIDE THE SEPARATOR LINE IN THE DOCK\nTo hide the separator line in the dock, I downloaded an app called cDock and changed the theme to Transparent.\nHOW TO ADD THE TRASH FOLDER TO THE FINDER SIDEBAR\nTo add the trash folder to the Finder sidebar, go to this website and follow the instructions: http://www.macworld.com/article/1138661/trashinsidebar.html. (I wouldn't try to change the folder icon, as he says to in the article.) You might want to do this before removing Trash from the dock.\nHOW TO REMOVE THE SPACE AND TRASH THE FROM DOCK\n\n*\n\n*Go to \"Macintosh HD/System/Library/CoreServices.\" Find \"Dock.\" Right-click, and select \"Show Package Contents.\" Go to \"Contents/Resources.\" Find the \"DockMenus.plist\" file and copy it to your desktop (or somewhere else on your Mac). We do this so that we can backup our DockMenus.plist file before editing it.\n\n\n*Download and install PlistEdit Pro (http://download.cnet.com/PlistEdit-Pro/3000-2247_4-47890.html—try to avoid downloading the extra stuff the process tries to get you to accept).\n\n\n*Download the DockMenus.plist file from this website: http://www.mediafire.com/download/ze7d0wci9j014ys/DockMenus.plist+2.zip. (It's from the guy who made this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Miwmapcrig.)\n\n\n*Open this downloaded file in PlistEdit Pro. Go to \"dock\" and display the children underneath it. After clicking on \"7,\" add a \"New Sibling.\" This new sibling will have two children underneath it. Edit to match what you see in the picture below. Save this file.\n\n\n\n*Copy this file to the \"Resources\" folder, replacing the original \"DockMenus.plist\" file (which you should have already backed up in step 1).\n\n\n*You can now right-click on the Trash icon and select \"Remove from Dock.\" You can right-click on the empty space and do the same. (You can even remove the Finder icon, but I don't recommend that).\nThis process is reversible. In fact, every time you log out of your Mac account and log back in, the space and the trash icon will reappear. Just right-click both of them and select \"Remove from Dock.\"\n\nA: No.\nNeither the Trash nor the Finder can be removed from the dock.\n\nA: I have a folder called zzTrash in my home directory (the filename puts it at the end of the directory listing). I stick it on the Finder sidebar.  Inside that folder I have folders like zzTrash2019-08-09 which contain, guess what, all the stuff from the time I emptied trash on that date.  \nI drag unwanted files either into zzTrash or into actual Trash.   At intervals ( monthly; realistically when name collisions start to be annoying), I create a date folder inside zzTrash, and drag stuff from a) the actual trash and b) the stuff that is cluttering up zzTrash (which isn't a dated folder) into that dated folder.  \nThings which I positively know I will never need, get left or put in actual Trash, and emptied.  This would never be content I created! This would be stuff I downloaded or generated from other data.  \nAt rare intervals, date files from zzTrash get moved to an external drive.\nIf I am short disk space, first thing I do is hit \"show all sizes\" and root through zTrash looking for any biggies I can trash for real.  \nSo if your itch is to empty out the Trash, move it to zzTrash immediately.  \nRegardless, you have to master your habits.  Obviously, you've carved a rut in your road / created reflexive autopilot about deletion, and you've stopped  putting enough thought into your actions.  Solving that problem is why I do zzTrash. \nTurn off auto-empty, obviously.  That setting is not appropriate for content creators, it is for content consumers.\n\nA: The trash can is working as intended - it's a \"pre-deletion folder\" that allows you to recover something before it gets permanently deleted.  Going in and arbitrarily emptying it because \"any file goes into it\" defeats that purpose.  \nAllow it to do it's job and delete files periodically, automatically.\n\nA: You can start treating mac's trash the way Photos' trash works. It auto-deletes stuff after 30 days. This preference is can be set in Finder Preferences → Advanced tab as \"Remove items from Trash after 30 days\". And then convince yourself that you're not under a space crunch. \nAlso, tick \"Show warning before emptying the Trash\"  which can be a bit of a deterrent if you keep your finger away from keyboard, specially \"Enter\" key.\nYou can also set the sort order to \"Name\" & lock the last file. Refraining from \"Empty Trash\", you should use select all → delete immediately. This would ask for password, in the end won't let you delete a single file. \n\nA: I also want MacOS to gave us this setting! Idially it would be in system preferences, perhaps it's accesable at an unknown-to-me OS level.\nWhat is possile is a 'Dock replacement' -- a third party program that will hide your doc and relace it with it's own 'better' vesion of what that third party developer thinks is a better Dock. One such advantage is hiding the trash can ️→=.

Found an article but it was very long and confusing, if you know a solution to this please let me know thanks <3\nI used a flash drive instead of a DVD to install Windows.\n\nA: In 2012, Apple starting switching over from DVD installs of Windows to flash drives. In 2015, Apple again switched to installs of Windows where only the Windows ISO file was required. Your have a 2011 Mac and therefore were only suppose to install up to 64 bit Windows 8.1 by using a DVD. While by 2011 the industry had converted from legacy BIOS booting of Windows to the modern EFI boot method, Apple did start converting until 2012. When a High Sierra was installed on your Mac, the firmware was upgraded to allow EFI booting of a Windows 10 installer from FAT32 and ExFAT formatted flash drives.\nUnfortunately, the Boot Camp Support Software for your model Mac contains drivers for the legacy BIOS booting of Windows. Therefore, if you attempt to install an EFI booting Windows you may encounter problems such as the audio not working properly. The same should also be true when installing Windows 8.1\n\nNo Mac, regardless of model year, can BIOS boot from a flash drive.\n\nIn my opinion, Windows 8 and 8.1 were terrible versions of Windows. Therefore, you should consider installing Windows 10. Since the Window Support Software drivers are designed for a BIOS booting Windows, you should only install Windows to BIOS boot.\nIf you use a DVD to install Windows, then you should choose to BIOS boot from the DVD. This will automatically select Windows to be installed to BIOS boot. If installing the current version of Windows 10, then you will need a double layer DVD (DL).\nIf you choose to use a flash drive, then you can only EFI boot from the flash drive. The Windows installer will by default require you to install Windows to EFI boot. Instructions on how to install Window 10 to BIOS boot are given in the accepted answer to the question How to install Windows 10 into a 2011 iMac without using the Boot Camp Assistant, an optical (DVD) drive or third party tools? \n", "Q: Using tkinter with Catalina, how to avoid deprecation warning?

I'm a longtime Windows user, and I was given a Macbook Pro at work. I was recently given a new one, and I need to use Migration Assistant to move all my data from the old one to the new one. \nI've got a lot of settings that I don't want to spend time on again, and I've got a Parallels VM on it. I want the new Mac to behave exactly the same as the old one, so nothing would be changed. I'm used to the Windows world where I would image a computer and then deploy that image on another computer.\nWould Migration Assistant truly copy everything from the old Mac to the new? If there are things that Migration Assistant wouldn't copy, can you please tell me what they are?\n\nA: Migration Assistant does truly copy all your user data from the old computer to the new - that includes Parallels virtual machines and your settings.\nMigration Assistant does not copy over the actual operating system, as you already have that on the new computer (i.e. there would be no point in copying it over). Similarly Apple supplied standard programs (such as Safari) are not copied over - but you would already have those on the new computer. Settings, bookmarks, passwords, etc. for Safari are copied over.\nIn essence if you just want to copy over all your data and settings and continue working your new computer - Migration Assistant will work for you. However, if you want to downgrade your new computer to an old operating system and old versions of Safari or similar - then Migration Assistant alone cannot do that for you.\nI have personally used Migration Assistant for 15+ years when moving from old to new computers, etc. - never had any problem with anything missing.\nYou can read Apple's guide on using Migration Assistant here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204350\n", "Q: How do I create an apple script that changes the destination folder of airdropped files?

I've downloaded Avast Security to try to find it but no luck.\n\nA: When you have already been infected with the malware, the best solution is to wipe the machine clean, reinstall macOS and restore your own documents and data from backup.\nEnsure that you update macOS and your programs to the latest versions immediately after setting up the system to ensure that you do not get malware again.\nIf you have programs on cloud services such as Dropbox or iCloud, make sure to validate that they do not contain malware before running them on your newly installed computer.\n\nA: You can download “little snitch” an app that records and monitors all of your system, user and network connections. The process responsible will be shown connecting to your local network.  You then can use little snitch to prevent that app from using the network. \nWithout having more information and details it’s hard to provide a quick solution to remove the malware and prevent reinfection. Finding out when it runs can help a lot. Ask your IT department for a time stamp that you can use to compare with your logs.  Built in utility apps like Activity Monitor & Console can help list running programs, list processes and show logs.  \nYou can also turn on your firewall located in your settings.

I would like to create an executable file that opens an application if it is not currently open, and quits the application if it is already open.\nI would also like the window of the application to be hidden after it opens.\nI already figured out that the terminal command osascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\"' -e 'set visible of process \"KeyboardCleanTool\" to false' -e 'end tell'\nwill hide an application after it is open, so this command would also need to be integrated into the executable file.\nThe application is called KeyboardCleanTool and is stored at /Applications/KeyboardCleanTool.app\n(macOS Catalina)\n\nA: You would be best advised to either create the application from within Script Editor as an actual AppleScript app written in AppleScript; or to create an executable shell script program that is written in shell script without calling out to osascript.  There's nothing wrong per se about mixing it up, and indeed there's lots of situations where it's needed or useful, but this isn't one as both scripting languages have their own dedicated mechanisms for doing what you need.  I'll show you both example scripts:\nAppleScript\nFirst, I'd recommend running a quick line of AppleScript to obtain the bundle identifier of KeyboardCleanTool, which is one way to allow AppleScript to reference an application without having that application launch as a result without an explicit request for it to do so (some applications do this because their AppleScript dictionary only avails itself to be read by AppleScript if the application is running).\nSo, run this line, then you can dispose of it after taking a note of the result:\nreturn the id of the application named \"KeyboardCleanTool\"\n\nIt'll probably be something like \"com.hegenberg.KeyboardCleanTool\".  That's what I'll use in the script below, which you can replace with the correct bundle identifier:\nproperty id : \"com.hegenberg.KeyboardCleanTool\"\nproperty A : a reference to application id id\n\nif A is running then return quit A\nrun A\n\nThere are three ways to open applications using AppleScript, each with different results:\n\n*\n\n*activate opens the application, brings it to the foreground, and gives it focus;\n\n*launch opens the application and reveals the windows but doesn't bring them into the foreground, nor gives it focus.  The windows will be obscured behind whatever application currently has focus, and possibly others (I don't recall fully, but the newly launched app might sit at the back of the application z-ordering);\n\n*run opens the application but neither shows its windows nor gives it focus.  For applications that have neither a dock nor menu bar icon, you won't be given any signal that it has been opened.  This is the command it sounds like you want.\n\nUsing tell application \"Finder\" to set visible of process \"KeyboardCleanTool\" to false is not a great method.  Firstly, you shouldn't use Finder for controlling the GUI, which is what this is doing; use System Events, which was created specifically to take the job away from Finder because Finder can't even do its own job properly without having a melt down, let alone trying to prioritise calls to manipulate the UI.\nIt also requires additional permissions that I'm sure you've already granted, but is worth mentioning for other users who don't wish to do this.\nLastly, if you don't need call in outside help to do something, it's much more advantageous (quicker, more efficient, less demanding on resources) to use a means already availed to you by the core scripting commands.\nTo create an Application using the above script: Save the script in Script Editor, selecting the type from the drop down list in the Save dialog that is called something like \"Application bundle\" or \"AppleScript Applet\".  You'll know it when you see the four options.  It can be saved anywhere you like, but a sub-directory in your user applications folder would be a sensible choice, i.e. ~/Applications, or the root applications folder, /Applications if you prefer.\nShell Script, e.g. bash\nLet me know if you use a shell other than bash, and I'm aware Catalina is packaged with zsh and I, myself, preferentially use Fish and recommend you check it out.\nThe bash script for the task at hand can be this:\npkill -i 'KeyboardCleanTool' || lsappinfo launch nofront=true async=true /Applications/KeyboardCleanTool.app\n\nThis can be saved as anything you like, and ideally in a directory that is listed in your $PATH environment variable, such as _/usr/local/bin.  It will also need to be made executable.  Taking the above script, here's the entire bash code that will do all this:\necho '#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nA=\"${1-KeyboardCleanTool}\" # Default app name if none given\n[[ -e \"${fp=\"/Applications/$A.app\"}\" ]] || fp=\"$( locate -l 1 -i \"*/$A.app\" )\"\npkill -i \"$A\" || lsappinfo launch nofront=true async=true \"$fp\"' > /usr/local/bin/rd; chmod +x /usr/local/bin/rd\n\nOnce that's done, you can invoke the program like this:\nrd textedit           # Will run or quit TextEdit\nrd keyboardcleantool  # Will run or quit KeyboardCleanTool\nrd                    # (Default) Will run or quit KeyboardCleanTool\n\nAnd, of course, you don't need to save the program in /usr/local/bin.  Saving it in your main /Applications folder is perfectly fine.  It will have an icon representing a Terminal shell, but you can treat it like any other application: double-click to run from within Finder and it will exit when it's done.\n\nA: This is a fairly simple if (running) quit, else launch structure.\nYou'd have to leave the Script.app somewhere you can find it with the mouse, as KeyboardCleanTool will, of course, deactivate the keyboard input entirely if it is set to start cleaning mode automatically at launch.\nset appName to \"KeyboardCleanTool\"\n\nif application appName is running then  \n    tell application id (id of application appName) to quit\n    return \"Quit\"\nelse\n    tell application appName  to activate\n    tell application \"Finder\" to set visible of process appName to false\n    return \"Launch & hide\"\nend if\n\nThe returns are just for debug. You can leave them out.\n", "Q: Can I replace the logic board in a 17\" 2009 MacBook Pro with one from a 15\" 2009 MacBook Pro? I've got a working 15\" Mid 2009 MacBook Pro. I've found the same model MacBook Pro, but with a 17\" LCD.\nCan I replace from the 17\" MacBook Pro with the logic board from my 15\" MacBook Pro in order to get a larger screen size?\n\nA: As far as I understand your question, you say that you have found a 17\" 2009 MacBook Pro that has a working LCD panel, but not a working system. You already have a working 15\" 2009 MacBook Pro, and you want to know if you can transfer the system board from the 15\" MacBook Pro and connect it to the 17\" LCD in order to get a working system with a larger screen size.\nThe answer is unfortunately no, that won't work. The 15\" and 17\" logic boards are vastly different, and will not support each other's displays.\n", "Q: How to see library search paths MacOS? There are two Macs and one of them finds a certain dylib when I dlopen it and another one doesn't. Seems like the library search paths are different, but DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH and DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH are empty on both machines.\nHow can I see what paths dlopen searches?\n\nA: You'll find the list of paths (i.e. list of variables containing the paths) in the man page for dyld. You can view the man page by running the following command in the Terminal:\nman dyld\n\nFor example you might have a difference in LC_RPATH or similar. I suggest printing out the environment on both machines and comparing notes.\nIf you come from a Linux background and expect a file like /etc/ld.so.conf on Linux, then no such file exists on macOS.\nAnother reason for difference between the code could be one not having an update dyld cache. You can run the following command to update the cache:\nupdate_dyld_shared_cache\n\nRemember to reboot afterwards to actually use the cache.\nIn general it sounds like the program you have that does dlopen is programmed a bit odd. Typically programs do not dlopen() various dylib at paths not relative to the executable, the loader or the program's built-in rpath in rare cases.\n", "Q: Can I use Siri to remember a parking spot? Can I use Siri to remember a particular GPS location, then later navigate back to it? It seems like it should be possible but I don't know what the voice directive would be.\nI occasionally use a car-share program that only offers two-way rentals. In other words, I have to return the car to the exact spot I picked it up at. It would be helpful if I could use Siri to mark the location where I picked up the car, so that later I could get turn-by-turn navigation directions back to that parking spot.\n\nA: I don't think there's a way to save a location with Siri, but you could take a photo of the car when you park, as long as the Camera app has location permission.\nThen use an app like Photo Find to make use of that location to do whatever is convenient for you:\n\n\n*\n\n*navigate back to it later on foot\n\n*open the location from that app in your favorite navigation app to get turn-by-turn directions\n\n*copy the coordinates from the photo to give to someone else\n\n\nA: Source:\nYes, you can use Siri for this.\nSimply say \"Siri, remember where I parked my car.\"\nSiri will drop a pin at the GPS location you're at.  You can use Maps to go back to this location.\n\nAs long as the parking location is marked, you can launch the stock Maps app on your iPhone and easily get walking directions to your parked car. This way, you’ll never have that lost look on your face ever again.\n\nWhen you want to delete this parking spot, say \"Siri, forget where I parked my car.\"  This will make Siri delete the pin.\n\nA: This doesn't help your car share situation, but is useful for an owned car: If you link your phone using Bluetooth to your car, whenever you park and it disconnects, the iPhone remembers that location and you can see it on Maps as \"parked car\".\n\nA: I don't believe Siri can do that, but Maps (and several third-party apps) will let you mark a location and later plot a route to or from that spot.  \nOr if you note the address of the spot, you can ask Siri to show directions to the address.  \n\nA: Starting with iOS 12, you can use Siri Shortcuts to define custom voice cues that will capture the current location into a Note, and navigate to the location stored in a Note. Examples:\n\nHey Siri, save this parking spot.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get Current Location\n\n*Save into a Note\n\n\n\nHey Siri, return to parking spot.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get location from Note\n\n*Get directions to location\n\n", "Q: What can I do to regulate iPhone charging rate (make it charge slower)? My iPhone is charging from my MacBook. I believe that it charges too fast and even heats quite sensibly. Also, I'm afraid the battery could degrade at a greater rate with such a fast charge.\nSo, I don't need that fast charging, because it has plenty of time to charge.\n\nAs you can see, the battery temperature rises quite a bit.\nBy the end of the charge, the temperature drops to 30 degrees.\nI'm well aware that there's a new thing that analyses how much time you let the phone be on charge and slows down the charging rate accordingly, but only after the battery reaches 80% (more details here - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210512)\nWhat can I do apart from just buying a cheap charger? (I don't think it's a great idea)\n\nA: Fast charging your phone via a MacBook is not going to \"damage\" your battery anymore than other kinds of charging. Yes, high temperature can affect the battery, but a temperature of 38 degrees C is not a problem in charging your phone.\nThere's no need to limit the charging rate beyond what the iPhone does automatically by itself.\nAlso there's no setting in macOS that will allow you to limit the power supplied to the phone charging through a USB port (besides limiting it to 0 by turning the port off completely).\n", "Q: Double clicking the trackpad is suddenly hard My trackpad became tough to double click, i.e., I had to apply extra force to double click, while the force needed to single click remained the same.

As there's no need for you to actual own the device you're adding the UDID for, you can get an UDID from a friend's phone or similar.\nNote that you can create a distribution provisioning profile in the developer portal without having any physical devices registered.

OpenDNS is a free content-filtering service that prevents access to adult/malicious sites and is not a spying/sniffing tool (in reference to your second question). Basically, when your computer tells OpenDNS \"Hey, look up this website for me,\" OpenDNS compares the website against a list of adult/malicious sites and if it is on the list, it tells your computer \"no, you can't access that website.\"\nTo no longer use OpenDNS:\nIf you have access to your router's configuration page, you can change the DNS settings to point to other DNS servers (e.g. 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 are Google's free DNS servers you can use.) \nIf you don't have access to your router's configuration page, and as long as there are no rules on the router to prevent it, you should be able to enter a different DNS server address in your Mac DNS settings (which you have pulled up in your last screenshot). Click on the \"+\" button and put in the two Google DNS servers mentioned above.\n\nA: Your assumption that the mac is blocking this could be incorrect. It also could be a VPN software like Cisco AnyConnect which uses OpenDNS servers to ignore the local DNS servers and settings.\nBy the screen shot, Your mac is trusting the router 192.168.1.1 to filter all your traffic, and that router is the item that’s configured to filter some sites.\nIf you can’t find some network software that installs a kernel extension or uses VPN hooks / network filtering in Catalina, the next step is to look at the group that runs your network setup? You will need to discuss with them how they’re configured the filters that direct traffic. \nLucky for you, they left a calling cart there in the block page - it-security@flixbus.com\nPerhaps they have a log in process to ensure you’re not a minor. Think of this like mailing a package. If your mail service goes through a company that checks each address and blocks delivery to some, you would need to either get them to change their rules for your packages or choose another company.\nIn net-neutrality terms - you need a VPN or different agreement or a different DNS provider.\nIf this filtering is likely legally mandated in your country, check with your lawyer before you try to get around a content filter block for minors. We are not lawyers and can’t be your lawyer, but this is a very topical subject about freedom, censorship and the internet. Good on you for learning about how your privacy works. If you’re not a minor - vote for net neutrality and better transparency from your IT setup team. If you are a minor, get ready to vote and this is what algorithms and surveillance looks like in the 21st century.\n", "Q: Export Photos in Catalina Is there a way to export photos from an album in Photos.app on my MacBook then to a folder in that order? \nSince Catalina, I've not been able to do that even with titles and and the number box checked in export, but I have always been able to do that in previous OS X systems. \n\nA: Do you mean how to export an album to a folder on your Mac, while preserving the order in which you had arranged them in the album? The steps below are for Monterey but will also work for Catalina, Big Sur etc.\nOpen the album in Photos on Mac and select all the photos. Click File > Export > Export N photos > in 'File Naming' section, change 'File Name' to Sequential > Click Export > click the 'New Folder' button at bottom left and input your album's name > click Export.\nTo export multiple (or all) albums and folders while maintaining the folder and album hierarchy, ordering, nesting structure etc., you could use the third-party app Photos Takeout.\n", "Q: Changing Mac Book Pro 2012 admin Password I purchased a fairly used Mac Book Pro 15\" mid 2012 which works well, however, I noticed that the past user is still logged to the system which I don't have the password.\nIs there anyway I can change the admin password without the access to the current password?\nThanks. \n\nA: You need to wipe the machine & start afresh.\nCurrently, everything on the machine belongs to the previous owner - including the OS itself. Eventually you will need their Apple ID & password before you can update things.\nAdditionally - you have no idea what spyware, keyloggers etc they may have put on it. The chances may be low but they are not impossible.\nSee Apple KB - What to do before you sell, give away, or trade in your Mac The previous owner should have done the first 5 steps; you'll have to start from step 6.\n\nA: Can you establish if there is anyone logged into the iCloud system? Otherwise you could use the recovery partition and reset the password that way. Don't exactly remember how to do that but I've done it before and im sure you can do it too now\n", "Q: What Macs do when verifying applications I am asking this out of curiosity. When I download an app by an unidentified developer:\n1) What does it mean that the app is by an \"unidentified developer\"? How is a developer identified?\n2) What is the Mac doing when I am opening that app for the first time and I see \"Verifying..\" (or something similar)? \n\nA: Apple provides digital 'certificates' to registered developers, who pay $99 per year to register. Any applications signed with those certificates will be 'verified'. \nIt's nothing to do with the App Store as such. Registered developers can make certified apps available on their own websites.\nApple can remove the certificate from developers who are found to be shipping malware or being naughty in some other way.\nWhen you first open an application, MacOS checks that the certificate is valid. If the app was made by a developer who is not registered with Apple, then you will get the message that the app is unknown to Apple, and therefore potentially risky. Of course, lots of very good software is written by developers who don't register with Apple.\n\nA: AppStore is curated, which means Apple has a lot of guidelines to what can and cannot be posted in its AppStore and it is basically Apple's way of telling you it is safe to install the app. \nThey certify apps and guarantee they know the developer by making them enroll in a developer program and issue a certificate, which is a file used to 'sign' the app and ensures whoever signed it is the developer who requested it - certificates can be stolen and misused, and there's nothing to be done about it though.\nAlthough they'd prefer to have all apps installed through the AppStore, macOS still allows you to install apps which are not certified by Apple, but it will tell you by saying the app is from an unidentified developer.\nhttps://developer.apple.com/support/certificates/\nhttps://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/\n", "Q: How to get rid of the \"Flash Player Auto Update Daemon” popup?

You can just do this:\ncd () { command cd \"$( eval echo \"${*-$HOME}\" )\" ; }\n\nThis re-defines cd so that doesn't need to quote the path they pass to it.

I have to manually right click those apps and select Quit in order to remove the dots on the dock.\n\nA: The presence of a dot below an app icon in Dock indicates that the app is still running.\nClicking on the red  traffic light button in the app window title bar, doesn't quit every macOS app. The default behavior of a macOS is to not quit upon clicking the button.\nSome apps are programmed to quit upon clicking the red  traffic light button, but most keep running unless you explicitly quit them by running the App Name → Quit App Name command in the menu bar, or using the keyboard shortcut Command + Q, or right clicking on the app icon in the Dock and selecting Quit.\n\nA: This can happen by design - even if you have a document based app and quit the app or the system quits the app for you. Yes, sometimes people close an app window thinking it quits the app, but there’s no harm in letting the app run with no windows on modern macOS like Catalina.\nIt’s possible to have an app running without threads (the dot you report) and the opposite - app not running (no dot) but threads running.\nThis is due to sudden app termination, launchd and the changes from iOS around energy savings.\nI would ignore the dots and just focus on system performance when you find you have an issue.\nIf you want to learn more about modern application life cycle and why the view controller exists separate from the app delegate and how sudden termination and automatic termination and saved application state all bring about this decoupling of the app from the dock from the windows being visible, start here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/MOSXAppProgrammingGuide/CoreAppDesign/CoreAppDesign.html\nStart towards the middle where it says “ The App Life Cycle “ where it lists the times the app can save data and pause/resume without you quitting the app officially.\n", "Q: macOS Won't Show WiFi Login Page When connecting to hotel WiFi, the WiFi login page doesn't appear on macOS.

But I don't want to stay in recovery mode forever, I want this to work in my normal system.\n\nA: On macOS Catalina (10.15.1), the solution for me was to manually open the /System/Library/CoreServices/Captive Network Assistant.app application in the Finder, which will trigger the standard application for displaying the WiFi login portal.\nYou might still need to follow the suggestions listed above in order for this to be successful (since I had completed them prior to attempting this solution).\nI found this solution from a blog post that has a more in depth solution for automatically triggering this process automatically until Apple releases a fix. But since it's not that difficult to manually open the /System/Library/CoreServices/Captive Network Assistant.app application I decided not to go through the entire workaround process.\n\nEdit: it's important to note that not all networks will require this solution. In some cases just navigating to a non SSL site (examples provided in original question), will work just fine and show the login page.

Can an original Apple AirPod have wrong spelling on the charging case and airpod labels?\nA friend just bought new, never opened airpods on a P2P marketplace. Upon receiving them and checking for whether they were fake everything looked fine except that there is misspelling on the labels on the charging case and airpods.\n\n\nYou can see on the charging case that almost all words are misspelled, notably Apple spelled Apoie, and then the airpod seems to say the same.\nI thought this would immediately mean they are fake, however I looked up the serial number on the inside of the charger and tested it on checkcoverage.apple.com and it shows as valid. \nI also connected it to an iphone and it connected with no issues just as an original AirPod would.\n\nSo I am at a loss. Find it hard to believe that original Apple products could have these errors, but I also expected a fake product to not have a valid serial number and for the iphone to recognize it as a non airpod.\n\nA: Of course these are fake. Or perhaps, more accurate, counterfeit. I think it’s safe to say, a genuine Apple product will not have a spelling typo. \n\nA: They cribbed the serial number off an actual pair of AirPods which the counterfeiter probably saw at an Apple store.  If you had bought two, you would notice the same serial number on both.   \nThe counterfeiters easily could have done a better job. It's their version of open disclosure: they're not even trying to hide that these are knockoffs.  In the same way that many scammers claim to be from Nigeria because they find it profitable to warn off the savvy, leaving only the gullible.

Or to put it in a simpler manner, when factory resetting an iPhone (or an iOS device), it is not reset to the version of OS with which it shipped, but the latest installed version of OS is retained.\nOn the other hand, with the Apple's signing process, it's technically not possible to roll back to older supported version(s) of iOS after update (and after Apple stops signing the older version(s)).\nFor an iPhone 4, iOS 7.1.2, is the current latest support version, and you have it installed, you can't go past it to an older supported version (iPhone 4 originally shipped with iOS 4.0).\n", "Q: configtest error AH00526: Syntax error in httpd-autoindex.conf I've been using the tutorials here as well as here in order to host a web page using Apache on macOS Catalina Version 10.15.1.

It reads Alias /icons/ \"/usr/share/httpd/icons/\".\nThen I found this tutorial by just searching the erroring line in the file on Google.

My iMac’s internal HDD has died. No big thing, as it was not used anyways. The iMac came with an SSD and HDD from the factory and I’m fine with using the SSD only. (note: this was the pre “Fusion Drive” era)\nUnfortunately, the broken HDD now makes clicking noises and so I want to remove it  and leave its slot empty.\nI read that with the Mid 2011 models, Apple did some proprietary temperature monitoring which makes it difficult to replace the stock HDD with an aftermarket one. Without a special adapter, the HDD’s fan would simply turn at maximum speed. (see e.g. here)\nWhat’s however unclear to me and what I’d like to check before opening the iMac: Will I also run into these issues when I just remove the HDD?\n\nA: \nWill I also run into these issues when I just remove the HDD?\n\nYes.  \nThe reason being is because that vintage iMac used a quasi-proprietary drive that had a temp sensor built in.   Remove the drive, you remove the sensor and the fans spin up full speed.\nInstead of just removing the drive, add an SSD and use an inline temperature sensor to regain the functionality.   \n\nA: A simpler yet still pretty effective approach is to install macs Fan Control\nhttps://www.crystalidea.com/macs-fan-control \nin there you can easily set you fan speed to be controlled by any other sensor (just pick one that is close enough to the main source of heat)\nvoila, fan speed down, no additional hardware tinkering and works very nice with SSD as well\n\nA: As noted by Allan, just removing the HDD effectively means removing the integrated temperature sensor. In case one wants to replace a defective HDD, his solution is definitely the way to go.\nHowever, I didn’t want to replace the HDD but simply remove it (the HDD was never used, the internal SSD has enough capacity as a system/working drive for me, and I prefer a computer with as little spinning parts as possible).\nSome more in-depth research brought me to this article (on archive.org). Towards the end, it shows what Apple did on iMacs which were delivered with just an SSD and no HDD:\n\nThe article says:\n\nIt’s just a plug that goes into the HDD power connector that shorts pins 2 and 7. Apparently tying the temperature-sense pin in the connector to ground signals to the BMC to just leave the fan at its base speed. Careful modification of the existing hard drive power cable should allow one to perform this hack while installing any drive of his or her choice — albeit while running the risk of having the drive overheat.\n\nOne can even find some online shops which list the mentioned jumper plug (however, either out of stock or for ridiculous prices). The Apple part no. is 922-9877.\nWhat I did in the end:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the iMac and remove the HDD following iFixit’s instructions\n\n*Plug a 15-Pin-SATA-to-4-Pin power connector on the free SATA power cable. The other end is not connected, its only purpose is to connect pin 11 to ground which is effectively the same what Apple’s jumper plug would do when directly connected on the logic board.\n\n*Keep the spare screws in a plastic bag which I hooked in the HDD mount -- just in case.\n\n*HDD fan now spins at 2,500 rpm in idle mode.\n\nWarning: Again, this only makes sense when removing the HDD. Do not trick the temperature control when you add an HDD or SSD into the slot!\n\nA: I followed the instructions in this article and the instructions work perfectly. In my case, I added an additional SSD drive and placed it under the optical drive leaving my HDD in place. After a year, I stopped using the old HDD and got annoyed by the noise of it constantly starting / stopping, so decided to remove it. When I removed the HDD the fan came on full - software solutions do not work. I plugged in a £3 adapter from Amazon (similar, but smaller, to the post above) onto the disused HDD power cable. The fan noise stopped completely. Here is the adapter I used from Amazon UK that worked:\nStarTech.com SATA 15 Pin Power Adapter to LP4 M/F\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000NPKGGU/\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Override iPhone's automatic brightness adjust? Apple seems to have completely removed the automatic brightness switch in recent iOS versions - the only 'automatic' settings now are for light/dark mode & Night Shift.\nI don't mind Night Shift changing my screen's white point as night comes on, but in regular daylight I heartily object to it constantly deciding for me how bright the backlight should be.\nI'm reading my book, it feels a bit dim for the ambient light I'm in, so I quickly dial the brightness up a bit…. then as I'm reading I can see the system just overruling me & turning it back down again.\nSo I turn it up… the system turns it down.

I am trying to automate the setup of a Mac running macOS Catalina (10.15.1).\nI found this question: How can I set the display settings using command line\n. But none of the answers really explain how I can set this \"slightly larger text\" setting. I would like to know how to automatically set the configuration in the below screenshot:\n\nIs there a way to do this using the defaults command?\n\nA: I’m not aware of any way to do this via defaults write (although it seems like it should be possible). I even checked MacPilot which is usually my go-to for hidden defaults.\nMy suggestion would be to use display_manager.py which is the best command-line tool that I know of which is being actively developed. It is free, but will require you to figure out the proper settings for your computer.\nThere’s also SwitchResX which is a commercial app ($16, I think) but if all you want it for is the initial setup, that might be overkill.\nLast but not least, there’s ‎Display Menu which is free, but with a $2 in-app purchase will add AppleScript support, which means you can use it from the command line.\n\nA: I came across this and tried TJ's suggestion display_manager.py\nThe script worked beautifully and even gave me an option to increase the resolution over what System Prefs/Displays was offering.\nI downloaded the whole git to my application directory. Then ran:\n/Applications/display_manager-stable/display_manager.py show highest\n\nI took the results and I ran this:\n/Applications/display_manager-stable/display_manager.py res 1920 1080\n\nI set up a LaunchAgent (using Lingon) with the command above and now when my headless mini restarts I am able to remote in and don't get the default unworkable resolution.\nThanks for this TJ.

I bought a 32GB MacBook Pro because I teach a software boot camp and need to run several memory intensive apps (video conferencing, ide, chat, browser w/ many tabs, etc...) and my 8GB MBA couldn't keep up.\nI soon found that certain apps will use all available space which doesn't solve my problem. I still run into memory issues because certain apps are memory hogs.\nIs there some way to specify memory limits on specific apps in MacOS?\n\nA: Even though you can limit memory for specific apps on macOS, you will not achieve the result you're looking for:\nThe problem is that when you limit the amount of memory an application can have, this means in practical sense that programs are going to crash when they reach that limit. \nSo you essentially have the option of having crashing programs or pausing them when they reach the limit. Pausing them is something you have to implement a program to do yourself (not very complex, but you would need some scripting experience or programming experience).\nIn simple terms, memory limits are not going to help you any more than simply quitting one or two of those hogs when you need to do something else.\nUPDATE: In the comments you wrote that you wouldn't mind crashing applications, and that you are an accomplished software engineer, so you would be able to do scripting/programming yourself.\nIn that case you can implement a memory limit in a variety of ways:\nSimplest version\nThe simplest would be to create a small script that periodically runs ps x -o rss -p $PID | tail -n1 to observe the memory usage of the indicated process ID. This grabs the resident set size, but you might for some odd reason want to use vsz instead of rss to get the vsize instead.\nIf the observed memory usage is above a threshold you specify, you can then terminate the process. The best way to do this would be to run a command like kill -15 $PID and then after a time run kill -9 $PID. The first is SIGTERM, which tells the process to start closing down by itself. The latter is SIGKILL, which kills the process if it refuses to close down by itself.\nAdvanced version\nA slightly more advanced version is to create a small wrapper program that calls setrlimit() to set a limit on the process, such as for example RLIMIT_DATA (maximum data segment size) or RLIMIT_RSS (maximum resident set size). Afterwards it needs to call execl() or similar to start the application for which you want to limit memory usage.\nNote that there's also a possibility of using ulimit instead of rlimit, however my experience is that these limits are not observed on current macOS.\n", "Q: Tethering an iPad / iPhone to a Raspberry Pi Questions\nMy concerns are focused on enabling USB tethering in an iDevice (iOS 12 iPhone X and iPad Air): \n\n\n*\n\n*What are the steps for tethering IOS 12 devices? Is it just one switch on the  Android or iDevice's?  \n\n*Does the iDevice require configuring any other USB tethering settings?\n\n*Is there a simple litmus test to confirm that tethering setting is working? (ping?) \n\n\nGoal\nI am interested in using an iOS12 device, instead of an Android device, to display VNC output from a Raspberry Pi (rPi) as described in the blog: Raspberry Pi Display over USB.  \nThe goal is to be able to  view / control rPi from iDevice (VNC or SSH) through USB-IP networking:\n\n\n*\n\n*power up your rPi, \n\n*plug in your iDevice into the rPi via USB, \n\n*turn on USB tethering \n\n*connect iDevice to USB0 via VNC or SSH client app\n\n\nPlease indicate in replies if you have successful USB-IP networking experience (SSH VNC).\niDevice (phone \\ tablet) configuration instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*VNC Viewer app to connect iDevice to tightvncserver over USB-IP connection\n\n*JuiceSSH app to SSH from iDevice to rPi over USB-IP connection\n\n*Turn on iDevice's USB tethering\nrPI configuration instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install tightvncserver\n\n*assigning a static IP, 192.168.42.42 to the rPi's USB0 interface: \nsudo nano /etc/network/interfaces\nPaste the following onto the bottom of the file, then save and exit (ctrl-X, Y):\niface usb0 inet static\naddress 192.168.42.42\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nnetwork 192.168.42.0\nbroadcast 192.168.42.255\n\nIt is also possible to append or echo the settings to the target file:\necho \"iface usb0 inet static\" | sudo tee -a /etc/network/interfaces\necho \"address 192.168.42.42\" | sudo tee -a /etc/network/interfaces\necho \"netmask 255.255.255.0\" | sudo tee -a /etc/network/interfaces\necho \"network 192.168.42.0\" | sudo tee -a /etc/network/interfaces\necho \"broadcast 192.168.42.255\" | sudo tee -a /etc/network/interfaces\n\nIt would be nice if there was a command to test static IP assignment?\nDetails how to temporarily route rPi traffic through a WAN- connected Android Device:\n\n\n*\n\n*use arp -a command to identify phone's IP address\n\n*use route add default gw 192.168.42.129 usb0\n\nA: It's actual a very simple setup that is needed that doesn't involve \"tethering\" at all.\nBasically what you need to do is to set up the Raspberry Pi for USB \"gadget\" - meaning that it makes an ethernet device available over USB. For the most easy setup, setup a DHCP server on the Raspberry Pi to automatically give out IPs.\nOn the iOS device - all you need to do to get it working is to plug it in, and then open a VNC app and enter the IP address and port number of the Raspberry Pi to open the connection.\nIf you do not install a DHCP server on the Raspberry Pi, but instead follow the instructions you've linked, then you need to set the IP address manually on the iOS device. You do that from Settings => Ethernet, and then set it manually to a not used address within the same subnet. If you follow the linked instructions the RPi will be available at 192.168.42.42, so set the IP address of the iOS device to 192.168.42.43 for example.\nThe tricky part in the above is not to do with the iOS device itself, but rather the configuration of the Raspberry Pi. There exists several types of USB \"gadget\" ethernet devices, and various variations of them. iOS does not support all of them (at all) - Android does not either. In addition there seem to be a difference between iOS devices, which I cannot comment on in your general case because you haven't said anything about which device you have. But for example the iPad Pro seems to be more forgiving than an iPhone in this respect.\nYou can get the exact same setup with having to configure the USB \"gadget\" interface by using a USB-ethernet dongle with the iOS device. If you plug that in to the iOS device and connect an ethernet cable from that to the ethernet port on the Raspberry Pi - you can achieve the same thing.\nUpdate: I see in your update that you emphasized on the requirement to list experience with \"USB-IP\". I do have succesful experience with \"USB-IP\" as you call it (it's not really called that). However be wary that the hard part of the configuration is on the Linux side - not on the iOS side. Also note that even though your linked instructions detail a single method of enabling a usb0 interface - in reality it is quite complicated with two majorly different modes of configuration, and within each mode several different protocols, and for each protocol various setup options.\n", "Q: macOS How do I install and use this program?

Interestingly, the correct picture is first shown for a second (or so) and then it is replaced by a completely different on. Moreover, the new picture is often cropped and not shown in full size, even if the aspect ratio is the same. I noticed that this only happens if faces have been detected in the pictures, but turning \"Show Face Names\" off does not help.\nA second version of the bug appears in the key photos for people's albums. When I select a key photo from an album, sometimes a completely different one is shown in the People overview page, typically showing a face of a different person.\nIt seems as if the App messed up the index of the photos, but repairing the Library didn't help.

My wife has a 2019 15\" MacBook Pro. They're both running 10.15.1 (Software Update says both Macs are \"up to date\").\nEver since I got the 16\" MBP both MBPs are constantly trying to connect to each other via Bluetooth:\n\nIf I ignore the prompt it goes away after two seconds. If I click check \"Ignore this device\" and click \"Cancel\" the prompt comes back after two seconds. If I click \"Connect\" nothing happens on either MBP and the prompt keeps appearing every few seconds.\nOn my wife's 15\" MBP System Preferences > Bluetooth list I clicked the \"X\" icon next to my 16\" MBP's name. After doing this a different Bluetooth device name appears in her Bluetooth list after each prompt on my MBP.\nThe only way I've discovered to prevent this is to turn off Bluetooth on my 16\" MBP.\nAny ideas on how to stop these constant Bluetooth Connection Request prompts?\n\nA: I had a chat with Apple Support. They suggested deleting this file and rebooting the affected machines: \n/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist\nThis seems to have worked. Deleting the file does not cause any problems - it gets regenerated on startup, and all my Bluetooth devices still connect fine.\n\nA: If you hold the option and click the Bluetooth icon in the menubar, you can see whether your computer is discoverable by other Bluetooth devices. \nSince Mavericks, Bluetooth discoverability is determined by whether you have the Bluetooth preference panel open. Other things like continuity and Bluetooth sharing might also have an effect on discoverability.  \nIn my case, removing the Bluetooth preferences .plist file and rebooting seemed to work, but only because I didn't have the Bluetooth preference panel open after I rebooted.\nJust FYI, holding shift+option and clicking the Bluetooth menubar reveals a \"Debug\" menu that allows you to reset some aspects of the Bluetooth system.\n\nA: Continuity and iCloud are the obvious paring agents, so I would disable handoff first on both devices and see if that quells things.\nIf so, you might need to engage Apple Support to see if there’s a precise way to rejigger that, but for most people you would need to sign out of iCloud on one or both Macs to then sign in again and see if the pairing identity crypto can heal itself.\n", "Q: How can I initialize an SSD?

They periodically require passcodes and Apple ID passwords and this has become a serious inconvenience.\nThe iPads are set up throughout the building and control things like lighting, access doors, and the security system. Individual applications have their own authentication procedure and everyone in the building is authorized to use the system. The Apple ID is owned by management and has a very secure password.\nHere's the problem:\nThe iPads constantly prompt for the Apple ID password, which only management knows. This has resulted in someone from management having to go to every room in the building and enter the very secure (takes long to enter) on every iPad. And I've watched them do this -- it prompts for it over and over. First it asks for it for no particular reason. Then it asks for it to update software. Then it asks for it again for no particular reason. I should make a video of this, it's ridiculous.\nThis means application additions and updates have to wait for management to make rounds to every iPad and enter every password two or three times. The prompts for the Apple ID password also seem to appear randomly and are system modal -- you can't just ignore them or hit the home key, you must answer them.\nThere has to be a better way.\nHow can I deal with users trying to access emergency functions having to find the \"Cancel\" button on an Apple ID prompt that has appeared for no particular reason?\nHow can I allow users to install and update applications without having to go to a manager to get the Apple ID password?\nAre we doing everything wrong? Is there some simple, sane way for a very small entity to manage a small number of iPads that solves these issues?\n\nA: I’d say - superficially you’re doing it wrong. I’m sure there were good intentions to start, but a little professional management would go a long way in your situation. You'll need automation and someone to learn and/or explain how these iPads will be managed securely:\n\n\n*\n\n*There’s no fighting the inherent design of iOS to be tied closely to an AppleID.\n\n*You need MDM supervision to lock these devices to your business in supervised mode.\n\n*MDM allows easy purchasing and provisioning of iOS apps centrally and securely (no password required on the devices)\n\n\n*\n\n*Here is the documentation on forcing updates which means people don't need to enter the password.\n\n\n*You don’t need to be so draconian on pass codes or local accounts now that you've decoupled management and automated setup / wiping.\n\n\nMDM frees you to hand the devices to people that could break things by not being trained how to operate the iPad settings and updates. Don’t blame the vendor or the people, just make it free / inexpensive / reliable to get things back where they need to be. iOS devices can be managed, secured and ready to work like a refrigerator or espresso machine and not like a Mac or PC needing paid help desk and a lot of end user training.\nIf you’re budget constrained. I would dip your toes in with a free - hosted MDM like Jamf Now - You get three enrollments for free forever and can read up on how to assign devices and apps systematically.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-now/\nThe reason I recommended that one is they specialize in MDM for teams without dedicated IT support and have extremely helpful user support and paid support for customers.\nAnother option would be Ground Control - they have a more “image” focused, so if you wanted to treat these iPads like a cart of devices all set up the same, explore their offering:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.groundctl.com/\nOnce you’ve gotten one or two devices enrolled and played around a bit, you can decide if it’s time for you to manage the AppleID for this company using Apple Business Manager:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://business.apple.com/\nThere is a cost you need to invest in terms of time you’ll spend learning to manage this, so I would make an estimate how much opportunity cost you’re losing by managing things and learning and making mistakes vs paying a team that knows how to run things to come in for a fixed period / fixed cost and get you stabilized. That way you’re happy with paying so you can make money elsewhere (or control budget elsewhere) or that you’re happy having you/your staff learn how to manage IT whether it’s your job or a side assignment. \n", "Q: Reset Admin password for macOS Mojave This is a MacBook Pro running macOS Mojave 10.14.6 with FileVault enabled.\nIn my case the problem is that at the login page, when the computer starts, the admin user account doesn't appear but after logging in as standard user I see that there is an admin.

The first attempt actually yielded a result that constantly showcased weirdness. When I looked at the page again, I noticed that he recommended having upgraded the BootROM through Sierra. Now, the MacBook did indeed come with Sierra but I had already flattened the SSD to put Catalina on it instead. And now, I am well stuck.\nTrying to use createinstallmedia from the Sierra installer app's resources folder does spawn an uncountable amount of processes, but does not actually ever ask me to erase the drive and tell me that it's copying files over. And any other createinstallmedia that I had available to try just outright did the same or refused to accept the application image.\nThen I thought of booting up a Sierra VM. After all, I did have the image already, so installing it into a VM and using the createinstallmedia tool from within there should yield me a usable result. But no - just dropping macOS into a VM won't work at all, even if the host is a macOS either.\nI have tried several methods, but I am quite out of ideas by now. I may also have a failing harddrive, but using the latest GParted Live DVD to load the Smart Monitor GUI only had me tell me that everything was fine with it. Weird.\nHow can I create a Sierra image on macOS Catalina (my other, 2014 MacBook Pro) that I can boot off on my MacBook7,1? Alternatively, I have a Windows 10 PC available, so if there is a method to make such image on Windows, this would also help.\nSmall bonus: Do you happen to know why createinstallmedia just basically throws out so many other createinstallmedia processes?\n\nA: The 2014 MacBook Pro should be able to download and run the Sierra Installer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Current Version is: OS X el Capitan 10.11.6 What's Next?\nThe answer to that question is the process you can / should follow to download the installer and then run the create script.\nWhat specific error message do you get following the process here?\nYou might need to post a screen shot of exactly what the terminal window shows in case you've got a syntax error we can spot. Also, the diskutil list command showing the USB drive you target might help.\n\nA: I have it solved - and in fact, I am posting from the new maschine right now!\nFirst, let me clarify the situation a little bit:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a MacBook from mid 2015 that I would like to sell. It officially supports Catalina and runs fine.\n\n*I bought a MacBook from 2010 - the white one which identifies as MacBook7,1. I want to use this one as my main laptop since I built a very expensive desktop PC and only need a laptop for when I travel to friends and/or family. For this case, the 2010 MacBook is well more than enough.\n\n\nFirst things first: I created a bootable Catalina install media on the 2015 MacBook and had it patched through dosdude1's `Catalina Patcher\" utility. I was worried that maybe the BootROM was not updated - but I realized that I had well been able to boot off an APFS device the whole time, which means that the update had been performed already by the previous owner of the 2010 MacBook. Big relief and oopsie there on my end.\nBut here is what I did not do: Diagnose the device.\nWhen you boot, hold D on your keyboard to get into Apple's hardware diagnostics tool. Mine reported a 4MEM/9/400000 (I hope I am not missing a 0?) almost immediately, indicating that my memory was deffective.\nSo I went to my desktop computer and burnt a copy of UBCD, the \"Ultimative Boot CD\". This includes a couple of hardware tests and benchmarks - including \"TestMemory86\". Running this multiple times after swapping positions and sticks used in the maschine, I eventually eliminated the dead SD-DIMM...but kept it, since I need to buy new RAM anyway so I have a bit of a refference at hand.\nAfter that, the maschine didn't just install, but also boot perfectly fine into macOS. Setup and all that was flawless and I have had no further crashes eversince!\nSo, if you are coming here after encountering weird behaviour with a second, or even third hand MacBook - I highly recommend running the diagnostics tool. Although I spent about four days trying to get this maschine to work and wasted a lot of time and efford there, I hope others may be able to avoid this desaster :)\n\n\n*\n\n*You can find UBCD here: https://www.ultimatebootcd.com\n\n*More information on Apple's Diagnosis tool: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257\n\n*dosdude1's Catalina patcher is here: http://dosdude1.com/catalina/\nI hope someone will find this helpful =)\n", "Q: How to change DPI?

Using Fusion it will work on e.g. a virtual Windows Machine. \nAnother user has also posted this, but no replies on that thread. It appears to be a more general problem.\nUpdate: I've been working on this for some days, but it might be working now. I am not quite sure what did the trick, however. \nI've installed/reinstalled the VCP driver found here. That didn't help. \nThen I also installed the D2xxHelper, which also didn't help. Actually it made it worse since this actually removed the device completely from /dev/cu.usbserialxxx. \nI then rebooted the Mac and the device was back and now actually working as it should. If it was necessary to install both or only one of the two and reboot, I do not know. Hope this helps you too.\n\nA: On the suggestion of the developer of Serial.app, I installed the FTDI VCP driver v2.4.2, available from the FTDI Chip web site.  This seems to be a functional workaround to the problem.  \nYeah, Apple's driver should work without the FTDI driver, but until they get it right, installing the FTDI VCP driver should do it. \nThe D2xxHelper driver is needed ONLY if you want to use the FTDI library APIs to use the FTDI interface.  If you want the /dev/cu(or tty).usbserial interface, you should NOT install the D2xxHelper driver.\nYou also should not need to reboot, just make sure you close any apps that might have been trying to access the device before you install.  You WILL be prompted to Allow the driver in the SystemPreferences, Security & Privacy panel (General tab).  After you get the prompt, you have 30min to \"allow\" before it goes away in the Security & Privacy panel.  Once it goes away, it will re-appear if something tries to use it, so I assume it would re-appear if you plug a cable in, or launch an app that uses the device.\n\nA: UPDATE: Dec/16/2019 - installed latest updated MACOS .. and problem magically went away. GRRR no explanation, no release note, just magically fixed it self.\n\nA: Response from FTDI regarding signed drivers\nApple are moving from what are called Kernel Extentions (.kexts) to what are called Driver Extensions (.dexts) for the implementation of drivers starting in macOS Catalina (10.15). Currently .kexts are still supported in macOS Catalina, however after the beta release they issued an update which stopped our driver from loading. This update required our driver (FTDIUSBSerialDriver.kext) to be re-signed and notarized, we completed this process with an updated Apple Developer ID (as they lapse every two years). Unfortunately when Apple issued our new Developer ID to re-sign and notarize the driver package they did so without the .kext support option enabled (as .kexts are being deprecated it is no longer automatically included). This is why there is a code signature issue with our driver, currently we are waiting on Apple issuing us with the correct Developer ID to be able to sign .kexts for macOS Catalina.\nAs such our current VCP driver available on the website has a signature issue and wont load. However if the device you are using implements a default FTDI VID/PID combination it should be picked up by the inbuilt AppleUSBFTDI.dext driver and present accordingly in the ‘/dev’ folder on your system in the following form:\n/dev/cu.usbserial-xxxxxxxx\n/dev/tty.usbserial-xxxxxxxx\ndespite of having default PID VID it doesn't work on my Catalina 10.15.4 @ FTDI USB to serial module doesn't work in Catalina\n", "Q: Can a 16“ MacBook Pro be reverted to an OS before Catalina? I want to get the new 16\" Macbook Pro which ships with Catalina, but I don't want Catalina at least for now because of how many legacy apps it breaks, not to mention Avid/Protools hardware which typically doesn't update drivers for up to a year after a new OS release. \nI understand that new Macs sometimes have drivers they need which bundled only with that latest release, but I'm not sure how set in stone this is. Where can I find more solid information about this? I'm really Catalina-shy at this point.\n\nA: The 16\" MacBook Pro cannot run anything earlier than Catalina.\nSometimes you can “downgrade” the operating system on a new Mac to an earlier version of macOS, but you should never count on it.\nIf that Mac is completely new hardware (like the new 16\" MacBook Pro) then Apple never adds driver support for older versions of macOS.\nIf you order a Mac which could run an older version of macOS, even though it comes installed with a newer version of macOS, it might be able to downgrade.\nFor example, if Apple released a minor update to the 2019 MacBook Air line, and you ordered a new MacBook Air and it arrived with Catalina on it, you might be able to install Mojave on it. But you would never be able to install High Sierra on it (in fact the 2019 MacBook Air cannot run anything older than 10.14.5).\n\nA: No - the Mac Pro (about to ship) and MacBook Pro 16 have T2 chips that lack any firmware support to run anything but Catalina. Since Catalina has been available for testing since June 2019, it’s going to be hard for a software company for professionals to say they can’t support it 6 months after the beta period started.\nYou can run older OS in a virtual environment, but if you absolutely cannot bring your work to 10.16 it’s better to not buy the latest hardware until you know your software can support 64 bit only operating system.\n\n\n*\n\n*Avid - http://avid.force.com/pkb/articles/en_US/Compatibility/macOS-Catalina-support\nThey say coming soon as of 1 December - will be interesting to see if they can support the monster Mac Pro on release day.\n\nA: No as it won’t have shipped with it.\nIt won’t boot to alternate installers so only recovery options to install.\nSo only Catalina upwards.\nThere maybe a way to do it but not officially.\nYou could maybe use VM Ware Fusion to run Mojave in Catalina but not sure if that would be a particularly seamless experience.\n", "Q: How to find out which app is sounding a bell, and how to silence it?

It has a 256G SSD with about 200G unused.  \n\nA: Your Late 2013 MacBook Pro does indeed have the integrated decryption functionality in hardware. It is not too old for that. It is integrated in your CPU.\nSo that solves the riddle of whether or not the slow app loading times are related to not having that - it isn't.\nYou can disable the encryption of the file system \"without pains\" by opening up System Preferences => Security & Privacy => FileVault and click \"Turn Off FileVault..\". I'm pretty sure it won't help your application loading times though.\nNote that disabling FileVault takes a long time. It runs in the background so you can continue to use the Mac, but it will be slightly less performant during that time.\n", "Q: Changing system font in macOS Catalina I am using macOS Catalina, and I would like to change the system font to something other than San Francisco. \nI tried TinkerTool, but it doesn’t really work.\n\nA: Our only hope is that the gentleman who makes this tool figures out a way to make it work.

However, I have another perplexing issue....or simply curiosity. \nWhen you hold down the option key at bootup, I see a hard disk icon with “Macintosh SSD” - obviously that’s OS X. But I don’t see one for Windows (BOOTCAMP). I see “EFI Boot” instead. If I select that, I boot into Windows 10. So, ok, it works, but why does it not say “BOOTCAMP “ or “Windows”?\nAlso, if I’m in OS X and I go to the System Preferences and choose BOOTCAMP as my startup disk and restart the computer, it boots into nothing and says there’s no startup disk. So I have to power down and hold option again. \nI suspect there’s a nuance or issue with the EFI partition or MBR now that APFS is involved, because I never had this issue before with fresh installs, which this was for both sides - OS X and Windows. \nIf anyone knows what’s going on, please let me know!\nThanks!!\n\nA: You probably were suppose to install Windows to BIOS boot, instead of EFI boot. However, if all the hardware is working, there is no harm in EFI booting.\nThe fact that you do not see Windows label on the Start Menu is another indicator that you probably were suppose to BIOS boot Windows.\nI am not sure why you can not properly select Windows from System Preferences. Again, this may be because you are EFI booting Windows. Or, there is something else wrong, but there is not enough information in your question to diagnose the problem. For example, you may have Windows boot files in the EFI/BOOT folder, but not the correct files in the EFI/Microsoft folder on volume labeled EFI in disk0s1.\nBTW, you can select to the default operating system to boot from macOS and/or Windows by installing rEFInd on your Mac.

To be clear, I don't want to create a new note; I want to open an existing one. Is there a way to do this?\nAfter the note is opened, one way to open it in a separate window might be to trigger the keyboard shortcut ⌘1 which will open the note in a separate window.

I was thinking ethernet cable (from Early 2011) to a USB-C-to-ethernet connector for the 2019 MacBook Pro.\n\nA: The fastest way is to connect the two computers using Thunderbolt. This will give you 10 Gbps of bandwidth, which is 10 times what you would get from the ethernet port on the 2011 MacBook Pro.\nNote that if you have only one drive in your old MacBook Pro, you'll technically be limited by the speed of that drive when transferring. I.e. if you have a 6 Gbps drive, you'll only be able to transfer at that speed - which will probably use approx. 7 Gbps of Thunderbolt bandwidth. If you've got the two drive mod for the old MacBook Pro, you'll theoretically be able to use the full bandwidth of the Thunderbolt connection.\nYou'll need a Thunderbolt to Thunderbolt cable and a Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter cable to connect the two Macs. As Thunderbolt 2 is backwards compatible with the original Thunderbolt, this will allow you to link the two Macs together. Then boot up the old Mac in Target Disk Mode (hold down the T key while booting) - and you can use it as a data source in Migration Assistant.\nIf you haven't got those cables lying around, chances are that it is probably faster to just use Ethernet rather than waiting for cables to be delivered. WiFi is definitely the slowest approach here.\n\nA: The fastest and most economical way to migrate your files would be remove the hard drive from your 2011 MacBook Pro and with the use of an inexpensive USB-to-SATA Adapter (it's a minimum of USB 3.0), you'll be able to transfer files at 5Gbps; using USB 3.1, up to 6Gbps.\nHere are some factors:\n\n\n*\n\n*The drive from the 2011 MBP is a SATA III drive which is capped at 6Gbps, so whether it's an SSD or a traditional spinning drive, 6Gbps is the limit no matter how fast the drive or connection.\n\n*USB 3.1 can go up to 20Gbps, but because of the throughput limit of the drive, you're limited to 6Gbps - you can only go as fast as your slowest link.\n\n*It's 5x faster than Gig Ethernet (1Gbps) and potentially 1000x faster than 802.11n (54Mbps - the wireless spec in the 2011 MBP)\n", "Q: How to add readable subtitles in iMovie?

The main objective is to have an app on your developer's iPad. \nMake Sure Your Device is Backed Up. \nFirst, your iPhone or iPad should be backed up either to iCloud or to iTunes on your computer. If it's not, plug it in and launch iTunes. When you see your device in the sidebar, right-click on it and choose \"Transfer Purchases from...\" (if you have the sidebar disabled, click File > Devices > Transfer Purchases from....) to get those apps off of your device and onto your computer.\nCopy the App to a Safe Place for Future Installs.\nOnce your purchases are transferred, visit the Apps tab in iTunes, find the app you want to back up, and right-click it. Select \"Show in Explorer\" (Windows) or \"Show in Finder\" (OS X) to reveal its file location. Then just copy the IPA file to Dropbox or any other location for safekeeping. When you're ready to install it again, sideload it. Just drag a copy back from that safe location back into the apps list in iTunes when your new device is connected. You'll need to log in to your Apple account (here you can change your password or you can log in by yourself), but once you do, iTunes will install the app on the next sync.\nI hope this solution also makes sense for you as you are looking to have an old application install on other iOS devices. \n", "Q: How to uninstall USB to VGA Adapter's drivers?

From looking at it, the following files get removed\n/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL/MCTT6Audio.driver\n/Library/Extensions/MCTTrigger2.kext\n/Library/Extensions/MCTTrigger6USB.kext\n/Library/Extensions/MCTTriggerGraphics.plugin\n/Library/Extensions/Trigger5Core.kext\n/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mct.USBVGASync.plist\n/Library/LaunchDaemons/tw.com.mct.TriggerDriver.plist\n/System/Library/Extensions/MCTTrigger2.kext\n/System/Library/Extensions/MCTTrigger6USB.kext\n/System/Library/Extensions/MCTTriggerGraphics.plugin\n/System/Library/Extensions/Trigger5Core.kext\n/System/Library/Services/USBVGASync\n/usr/local/libexec/MCTTriggerDriver\n/usr/local/sbin/USBVGASync\n\nAfter removing the files a restart is required.\n", "Q: Request Applescript to copy only one file type from 2 folders, into a 3rd folder Hi I've been trying to find utilities that will do this but I am guessing applescript/Automator on Catalina mac would work too.\nBasically I have 2 folders with all kinds of books (.pdf, .mobi and .epub) and subfolders too. I want to only copy files of extension epub type in these 2 folders, into a 3rd folder.\nSo by running the script the third folder would have only unique EPUB files from the former two folders.\nCan anyone please advise me how to write this up in Automator? Thanks!\n\nA: There are actually many different ways to do it in Automator! Here is one set of actions you could use:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ask For Finder Items \n\n*Get Folder Contents\n\n*Filter Finder Items \n\n*Copy Finder Items\n\nA: If you want to run this in Terminal you can use\nfind /path/to/top/of/source -type f -iname '*.epub' -exec cp '{}' /path/to/target/ \\;\n\nThis will duplicate all files, which might be heavy on disk space depending on the number and size of your Epubs.

However, it already came with an off-brand charger and the text on it has gone washed off it seems, so I can not reliably tell which charger I would have to buy.\nWhat I do know: I have to use MagSafe 1. According to a datasheet, it may as well be 60W.\nNow, I have seen some bricks with USB-C to MagSafe 1 cables and additional USB ports - which would be handy to charge additional devices when on the go. But I am afraid of accidentially picking the wrong wattage.\nWhat do I have to look out for, exactly, when picking a charger? I also live in Germany, if this is any important in terms of outlet, power delivery and alike. I'm a software-, not a hardware guy :)\n\nA: You can buy one here. It is original charger and it works well. Why do you need type c I can not understand\nAll you need to know about the charger is: voltage, socket type, magsafe version\n\nA: This Apple page will help you select the correct Apple charger.

In a mac (10.14.6) I want to set the default application to files of type  'err' (i.e. files like test.err or output.err) to be TextEdit. \nFor that I follow the description given here, and set the default application to be TextEdit.\n \nHowever, when I double click on that exact same file in the finder, I see the following text box:\n\nSo what am I missing? Why does it nor work?\n\nA: I don't know why the existing two methods are not working - they both should.\nAlternatively try RCDefaultApp which as far as I'm aware still works in Catalina. [I can only test up to Mojave.]\nI added this manually using the + button & it actually suggested TextEdit itself. I'd suggest also checking 'Override file creator' & see if that might help.\n\n\nA: The simple process goes as:\nRight click on .err file and press Option , then Open with will change to Always open with. \nThen select the appropriate application you want to open. It will open and then close it. \nTest it by double-clicking and then it should work without any issue. \nReference for it as a screenshot:\n\n", "Q: Files display only ^@^@^@^@ I have some files I was hoping to open and look at. I usually open files of the same extension them on a server in a UNIX environment. These files as far as I can tell have been plain text but attempting to open this particular set with nano on my Mac displays the following ^@^@^@^@^@^@.... Is there a way to change the encoding so I can read them? Also the files are old and some that I do not believe should be empty are empty, is there a good test to see if they are corrupted?\nUpdate:\nMoving the folder onto the UNIX server does not fix this issue. Contents are still ^@^@^@^@^@....\n\nA: File extensions can usually suggest the type of contents a file might have, however, sometimes files are misnamed, and sometimes files are corrupted.  I presume that if you're accustomed to opening filenames with a similar extension with a text editor like nano, you're expecting this file to be plain text as well.\nGive the command 'file' a try; that could tell you what the contents are. \nAlso, if it's mixed text and data, the command 'strings' can help pull out some interesting text in an otherwise unreadable (to the eye) file.\n\nA: ASCII values lower than 32 are often displayed in Unix text environments as ^@, ^A, ^B... and so on. Thus, ^@ represents ASCII character 0, ^A represents 1, etc. (So, when you type CTRL C, you're actually sending ASCII 3.)\nIf the file reads entirely of ^@ in nano, then the file is 'zeroed' and contains no useful data. Time to check the backup.\n", "Q: macOS No Longer Connecting to Wireless Keyboard Wirelessly I have an Apple Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad, and normally it works well wirelessly, and was doing so this morning, but suddenly it's no longer working.\nThe keyboard still works perfectly via its cable, through which it is now fully charged, however upon disconnecting the cable it is disconnected from the computer completely, despite the power still being on, and Bluetooth being enabled on the computer (a 2018 Mac-Mini).\nI've tested the keyboard with another machine, and it still works as expected, so there appears to be no fault with the keyboard itself. On the other machine, disconnecting the cable causes it to connect automatically via Bluetooth like it's supposed to. But for some reason this isn't happening on my brand new Mac-Mini (which has been working fine for about two weeks until today).\nTo try and rule out a hardware fault, I tried using a USB Bluetooth dongle to see if I could connect the keyboard using that, but have had no more success with that than with the internal Bluetooth.\nI installed Bluetooth Explorer (from the Xcode additional tools) to make sure I had switched to the USB dongle, but have avoided using any of its other functions; however, I've noticed two errors in its event log:\nupdateChainPower error: 82\n(null) (Handle: 0xB) connection failed, status: 0x04\n\nThe first occurs upon opening Bluetooth Explorer's Bluetooth Status window, while the second occurs when attempting to connect to my keyboard wirelessly.\nGiven that the keyboard works fine with another machine, and a USB Bluetooth Dongle cannot connect either, this seems like it may be a software issue with macOS. It's like there's just no signal.\nOther steps I've already tried include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clearing all devices and re-pairing the keyboard (connecting via cable).\n\n*Turning Bluetooth off, trashing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist then restarting.\n\n*Resetting the Bluetooth module via the debug menu (Option-Click Bluetooth menubar widget).\n\n*I've also tried to pair my Mac with my Android phone but neither is able to detect the other (with or without the USB dongle).\n\n*Reset NVRAM\n\n*Reset SMC\n\n*Booted in Safe Mode (no change even after re-pairing)\n\n*Tested whether

The key works fine on the built-in keyboard. After using the bluetooth keyboard the layout switches back to the previous one.\n\nDoes anyone now how to tell macOS that this key exists on the G613?\n\nA: You should be able to set a device-spesific key change using Karabiner.

I need to connect several 3.5\" hard drives to it, and its USB 3 ports are currently used up with other devices. So what I'd like to do is connect something like  an external enclosure with multiple drive bays (as many as four) to the Thunderbolt 1 port of this iMac.\nSo far I haven't been able to find a singular device that'll let me do it, and I'm not sure if I can pull it off with adapters. For example, there are now many USB-C multi-bay hard drive enclosures, but I'm not confident I'd be able to use it with a 2012 iMac.\nIs there either a) a device, possibly an old one I could get used, that connects multiple hard drives to a Thunderbolt port, or b) an adapter I can use to connect a more modern multi-bay enclosure?\n\nA: I ended up getting an OWC ThunderBay 4 and an Apple Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter.

And that answer says there are dialog-specific shortcuts anyway, and I guess that's the \"Mac\" way to handle it. What are they in this case?\n(Tried various combinations of ⌘, ⌥, ctrl, ⇧ and other keys. Only ↵ and ⌘+. choose \"Don't Add\" and that's it.) \n\nA: Try  Cmd ⌘   A  or  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   A  \nThey're a bit hit & miss as to which works in any given circumstance, but [key/keys] + [first letter] will usually do it.\nbtw, you can toggle the Tab behaviour on & off at will with  Ctrl ⌃   F7  even whilst the dialog is open.\n\nA: On Mojave, the dialog reads \"Keep .ext\" or \"Use .ext\". Command U works to activate the \"Use .ext\" choice. It's possible that on your OS version, Command A for Add will work. (Apple's Human Interface Guidelines used to recommend that key shortcuts were indicated.)\nI'm fairly sure that Tab used to be enabled for all items by default in the Classic Mac OS days. I'm not sure why or when it was turned off by default.\nIt's exactly what you need for this kind of situation. Dialog controls are traversed with Tab and the currently highlighted button activated with the Space bar. Only the default (blue) action is triggered by Enter/Return. Escape is traditionally Cancel. \nThis dialog is problematic (on Mojave) because the the negative action is both the default and the initially highlighted button. If the 'Add' button was initially highlighted, you could press Space or Enter/Return to choose the two options, without using Tab. (You could try Space bar on your OS version.)\nI'm unaware of any issues with having Tab set to move across All Items.\n", "Q: How do I get information specific to CPU core via command Suppose we have one CPU with 2 cores.

As you will have a macOS High Sierra offically from App Store also, it is safe to run the following option. \nFirst, you need one reference Macbook Pro or Mac mini whatever you can get. \nFrom the reference machine, download macOS High Sierra from the \nlink below and follow the first step of clean install macOS Sierra on your USB:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/macos-high-sierra/id1246284741?ls=1&mt=12\nThat link should open the MAS and take you to the macOS High Sierra download page.\nClean Install macOS Sierra on your startup disk\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a bootable flash drive with macOS Sierra.\n\n*First, make sure your USB flash drive is formatted and named as “Untitled”.\n•  To format a USB drive launch Disk Utility (Finder -> /Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility).\n•  Select your USB drive under External.\n•  Click the Erase tab at the top of the Disk Utility window. Select Mac OS Extended (Journaled) from the format list. Then, click the Erase button. When the process is complete, click Done, and close the Disk Utility window.\n•  If your drive is named something else, you need to rename it (Open Finder -> right click on the USB drive and choose Rename).\nNow, your USB flash drive is ready.\n•  Launch Terminal \n•  Enter the following text into Terminal:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app –nointeraction\n\n•  Hit the Enter key.\n•  Terminal will ask you for an admin password (the one you use to log in). It won’t display characters when you type, so just do it. Hit Return. You’ll see that Terminal erases your drive. Then, Terminal will copy the installer file to your disk. This will take a few minutes. When the process is complete, the Terminal window will report \"Done.\" \nYou can quit Terminal and your bootable macOS Sierra installer USB drive is ready for use.\nOn your main Apple device\nPlug in the bootable macOS Sierra installer USB drive to your Mac.\n\n\n*Restart your Mac while holding the Option or Cmd+R. Make sure to keep it pressed!\n\n*When Mac restarts, you’ll see the macOS Startup Manager with a list of bootable devices that your Mac can start up from.\n\n*Use the arrow keys to choose your USB drive with macOS Sierra installer.

I tried to set a custom dynamic wallpaper in Catalina as I used to do in Mojave (that worked fine) but my dynamic wallpaper will display the following option as you can see the picture (bugged).\n\nand when I want to change it the \"Dynamic\" option it's no there!\n\nI tried to find the path of the dynamic default wallpapers and I couldn't paste the \".heic\" files where catalina's wallpaper is. I also tried to set a default dynamic wallpaper first and in dynamic mode and then I switch to the custom one and didn't work. \nDid dynamic wallpapers format changed in Catalina OS?\nHow can I set a custom wallpaper in Catalina?\nlink to the custom wallpaper\n\nA: Copy your .heic file into /Library/Desktop Pictures.  Then, you'll need to somehow get the list of pictures to repopulate. This seems to sometimes happen to me when unplugging displays, or just after waiting long enough, or, most reliably, after a restart.  Then your new desktop should appear in the list of Dynamic Desktops under System Preferences:Desktop & Screen Saver:Apple/Desktop Pictures.\nIt seems like Apple prevents the Fill Screen/Fit Screen menu from showing up in the Apple folders, since they presume that all of them are already properly sized.  This avoids the issue where they located those two menus on top of each other, which is what's preventing us from just loading the wallpapers directly.\n\nA: There are 4 solutions to this problem. \n\n\n*\n\n*Easiest\n\n\n*\n\n*select Catalina wallpaper (System Preferences->Desktop & Screen Saver)\n\n*make sure the popup button has selected Dynamic item\n\n*close the System Preferences\n\n*locate your wallpaper, right click on it and select Services->Set As Wallpaper\n\n\n\n*Mid (requires tools) Remove Still images from dynamic wallpaper\n\n\n*\n\n*recreate dynamic wallpaper without still images (remove appearance metadata)\n\n*dynamic wallpapers without still images will cause only one menu item to be present and it will automatically get selected\n\n*Dynaper has the Remove Still Images Helper tool\n\n\n\n*Hardest (but best). Place dynamic wallpaper into System/Library/Desktop Pictures/\n\n\n*\n\n*disable SIP\n\n*reboot\n\n*open terminal and make System partition writable sudo mount -uw /\n\n*copy wallpaper with root sudo cp path/to/wallpaper System/Library/Desktop\\ Pictures/\n\n*OPTIONAL: copy custom thumbnail (same name as wallpaper) with root sudo cp path/to/wallpaper System/Library/Desktop\\ Pictures/.thumbnails/\n\n*enable SIP \n\n\n*Hardcore \n\n\n*\n\n*use Xcode: attach to process com.apple.preference.desktopscreeneffect.desktop.remoteservice and Debug view hierarchy\n\n*find the incorrect popup button address\n\n*pause program execution\n\n*run command [0xaddress setHidden:YES]\n\n*resume program execution\n\n*modify wallpaper selection to Dynamic\n\n\n\nExplanation:\nStarting macOS Catalina the system prefers Dark still image on dark appearance. Due to bug 2 overlaping popup buttons are displayed. For images inside System/Library/Desktop Pictures/  the disableCustomPlacement is set to YES (this makes the other popup to be hidden) . All other locations will have this property set to NO (this causes 2 popups to be displayed). \n Derived Properties:\n     pictureChangeIsActive:  0 \n     canSetBackgroundColor:  0 \n     disableCustomPlacement: 0 >\n\n\n\n\nA: What worked for me on Catalina 10.15.7 was to simply create a Desktop Pictures folder in the root Library folder at the same path, rather than trying to modify System/Library. In other words, instead of /System/Library/Desktop\\ Pictures which is restricted, place your custom pictures at /Library/Desktop\\ Pictures, and you should find they show up correctly in the control panel.\n\nA: As the Library/Desktop Pictures/ is located under /System/ (which is protected by SIP), users don't have write access in there. To workaround this, you can boot into Recovery Mode, disable SIP, restart, move pictures into the default folder, boot back into Recovery Mode, enable SIP and then restart. But all of this seems like overkill just to change a wallpaper.\nThere's another way to change your custom dynamic wallpaper to \"dynamic\". Do the following instead:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to sys prefs > desktop & screen saver and choose the default dynamic Catalina wallpaper. Set it to \"dynamic\" and exit sys prefs.\n\n*Open Finder and navigate to the folder where your custom wallpaper lies. Right click your custom wallpaper and choose Set desktop picture. This will change the wallpaper while also preserving the dynamic setting.\n\nTested on macOS Catalina 10.15.2\n\n\nA: Update!\nI found a solution that works on Catalina and should work on Big Sur too (although this hasn't been tested).\nYour custom dynamic wallpapers can be stored anywhere and should be added to the Desktop & Screen Saver prefpane using the plus button in the bottom left.\nOnce you have your custom wallpapers imported, navigated to Accessibility settings and enable VoiceOver. Using VoiceOver, you can navigate (using tab) down to the dropdown menu for selection of screen fill preference or the dropdown menu for selection of dynamic preference (Dark, Light, or Dynamic).\nYou can toggle through these options using arrow keys and select Dynamic to enable your custom .heic file to dynamically change throughout the day (if the data is there).\n\nThis method requires no disabling of SIP or any modification of permissions.\nEnjoy!\n\nA: *\n\n*download fancy dynamic wallpapers(.heic files) from this website\n\n*put the .heic files under /Library/Desktop Pictures (P.S. before Mac OS Catalina, it allows you to put the pictures anywhere. But in Catalina, putting the files under this specific folder is required, otherwise, you could only see dark still wallpaper even if you set it to dynamic.)\n\n*system settings:\n\n\nA: The issue is that the menus are overlapping each other, and you can't click on the underneath menu to select Dynamic. \nYou can work around this by clicking on the preview image next to the dropdown menu to highlight it, and then press Tab. This selects the correct dropdown. You can then press down arrow to open the menu, and select Dynamic.\n\nA: While the workaround explained by Mox works really fine —I however recommend using the Keyboard Preferences, Shortcuts tab checkbox to \"Use keyboard navigation to move focus between controls\" rather than VoiceOver— this technique sadly does not work for secondary monitors.\nIf you're feeling a bit adventurous but are not comfortable with disabling SIP, you can edit the desktop pictures database using free tools like https://sqlitebrowser.org to enable the Dynamic mode for your favourite wallpaper. Still interested? Follow the guide!\n\nThis process is totally safe and does not disable system security mechanisms. In case things go south and you make a change you shouldn't, the system will reset the desktop pictures to the default.\n\nThe database is located at ~/Library/Application Support/Dock/desktoppicture.db. Once opened, browse data and display the preferences table.\nThere you'll find a bunch of numbers. I've not figured out exactly what they all mean, but they are essentially linking pictures with spaces/monitors and with their settings (scale and dynamic).\nI've found out that if you set the data_id to 9 for the key 20 of the row containing the picture ID that matches the picture you're trying to update (figuring which picture ID is the hardest part), this will set the wallpaper to Dynamic. To be honest I just updated every 20 line without paying attention to the picture_id column.\nHere's an example with my dual screen setup. Pictures 3 and 4 were my desktop pictures that needed the Dynamic mode enabled:\n\nOnce you're done, save the DB (write changes) then log out/log in, restart, or (quicker) type killall Dock in Terminal.app.\nYour wallpaper should be instantly updated with no further actions from your part. If you used the killall Dock command while System Preferences was open, make sure you quit completely System Preferences before making any changes.\n\nIn case you mess things up, no worries. You can always use System Preferences to \"reset\" your setup. You could even delete the desktoppicture.db entirely and the system would create a new one with the default wallpaper setup, so there's no real danger here.\n\n", "Q: Why does AppleScript \"exists\" sometimes always return \"false\"? (part of question regarding checking documents in Pages) I'm new to AppleScript and I've reached this problem after several other problems and work arounds (see further down for more details). My current problem is that I'm telling Pages to check if any document is open with\ntell application \"Pages\"\n    exists front document\nend tell\n\nbut sometimes even when Pages has a document open the \"exists\" is always \"false\". And in general, it seems that sometimes, any reference to \"front document\" returns errors that it can't get it when it is clearly there. When I quit Pages and try again, usually it works...until it doesn't.\nAny ideas?\nMy original problem stems from wanting to make a QuickAction to open a file in Pages -> export to PDF -> close Pages -> repeat as necessary. But the script gets ahead of itself and tries to complete the export before the file is even open.\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set theSelection to selection\n    repeat with oneItem in theSelection\n        set finderLocation to oneItem as text\n        open oneItem\n        tell application \"Pages\"\n            set idx to 0\n            repeat until (exists front document)\n                set idx to idx + 1\n                if idx > 2000 then quit\n            end repeat\n            set pagesLocation to file of front document as text\n            repeat until finderLocation = pagesLocation\n                set pagesLocation to file of front document as text\n            end repeat\n            set exportFile to file of front document as text\n            set exportFile to text 1 thru -6 of exportFile\n            set exportFile to exportFile & \"pdf\"\n            export front document to file exportFile as PDF with properties {image quality:Best}\n            close front document without saving\n        end tell\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nSo I've been trying to find a way to check if the document is open first before continuing. And I came up with this, to check if the front document file location in Pages matches the file locations opened by Finder. This worked until I tried from a fresh instance of Pages (quit Pages first then try). The problem there was that  Pages would flag an error for not being able to find \"front document\" at all (since it needed to read its file path but nothing was open yet).\nSo now I'm here trying to check if ANYTHING is open before checking if the target file is open. But now, as described above, it seems that references to \"document\" just breaks and causes either \"exists\" or \"file of front document\" to hang.\nAm I even headed in the right direction here or is there a better way to do this?\nThanks in advance.\nEDIT:\nnow my script looks like this, and seems to be more consistent, at least so far\ntell application \"Finder\"\nset theSelection to selection\nrepeat with oneItem in theSelection\n    set nameOfDocument to name of oneItem\n    open oneItem\n    tell application \"Pages\"\n        repeat until (exists document nameOfDocument)\n            delay 0.1\n        end repeat\n        set exportFile to oneItem as text\n        set exportFile to text 1 thru -6 of exportFile\n        set exportFile to exportFile & \"pdf\"\n        export document nameOfDocument to file exportFile as PDF with properties {image quality:Best}\n        close document nameOfDocument without saving\n    end tell\nend repeat\nend tell\n\n\nA: This following AppleScript code should work for you.  Ultimately, this code sets a variable for the count of open documents in Pages (openDocuments)  Then if the count of openDocuments is not 0, the names of the open documents are stored in this variable openDocumentNames\nif application \"Pages\" is not running then\n    tell application \"Pages\" to activate\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell application process \"Pages\"\n        repeat until frontmost\n            delay 0.1\n        end repeat\n    end tell\nend if\n\ntell application \"Pages\"\n    set openDocumentsRef to a reference to documents\n    set openDocuments to count of openDocumentsRef\n    if openDocuments is not 0 then\n        -- Gets The Name Of The Open Files\n        set openDocumentNames to name of openDocumentsRef\n        -- Gets The File Paths To The Open Files\n        set openDocumentsPaths to file of openDocumentsRef\n    end if\nend tell\n\n-- Shows & Selects The Files In A New Finder Window\ntell application \"Finder\" to reveal openDocumentsPaths\n\n\nA: A slightly different approach. It opens the selected Pages file in the Finder, which will launch Pages. It then activates Pages, waits a moment and tests for busyness. It then checks that the open doc matches the selected file and if they are the same, exports a pdf version to the same folder, and closes the pages doc.\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set oFil to selection as alias -- get alias of selected file\n    set oFilT to oFil as text -- get file of selected file\n    set oNam to name of oFil -- get name.extension of file\n    if kind of oFil is \"Pages Document\" then\n        open oFil\n    end if\nend tell\n\ntell application \"Pages\"\n    activate\n    delay 1\nend tell\n\nset pagApp to path to application \"Pages\" -- App to test\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    if busy status of pagApp is true then -- Test busy status of Pages\n        say \"Busy\"\n\n    else -- if not busy then…\n        tell application \"Pages\"\n            set dFilT to file of document of window 1 as text -- get file of document 1\n\n            if oFilT = dFilT then -- is Finder selected file same as Pages open document\n\n                set dNam1 to name of document 1 -- get name without extension\n                tell application \"Finder\" to set xFil to (container of oFil as alias as text) & dNam1 & \".pdf\"\n                export document dNam1 to file xFil as PDF with properties {image quality:Best}\n            end if\n            close document dNam1\n        end tell\n    end if\nend tell\n\n", "Q: Applescript - Close all windows except frontmost window I have created an automator quick action that runs the following apple script\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set frontApp to name of first application process whose frontmost is true --retrieves name of open application\nend tell\n\ntell application frontApp\n    repeat while window 2 exists\n        close window 2\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nIt works; however, it takes a while to run if I have a lot of windows open.\nIs there a way to close all windows simultaneously except for the frontmost one?\nI typed in tell application \"Finder\" to close every window from 2 to 5\nAfter I compiled it, it automatically changed to tell application \"Finder\" to close ( windows 2 thru 5 ). However, I get the error message error \"Finder got an error: Can’t get windows 2 thru 3.\" number -1728 from windows 2 thru 3. So, then, it accepts the structure of the command, but I'm still missing something.\nEdit: I tried the following script\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    close (every window where index is greater than 1)\nend tell\n\nHowever, I get the error \"Finder got an error: Handler can’t handle objects of this class.\" number -10010\nWhy does this not work?\n\nA: If you're running it as an Automator quick action, then you can close all windows except the frontmost window of the frontmost application by using the code below inside a Run AppleScript action (you can delete any sample code that appears, including on run {input, parameters}...end run:\ntell application id \"com.apple.SystemEvents\" to tell the first process ¬\n    whose frontmost = true to tell a reference to windows 2 thru -1 to ¬\n    if exists then tell the value of attribute \"AXCloseButton\" to click\n\n\nA: Please try this. It might run faster. (edited my original answer with new code).\ntell application \"Finder\"\n\n    set theWindows to {}\n    set theCount to (count of windows)\n    if theCount is greater than 1 then\n        repeat with i from 2 to theCount\n            set theWindow to window i\n            copy theWindow to end of theWindows\n        end repeat\n        close theWindows\n    end if\nend tell\n\n\nA: I don't expect this to work for every app but it should for any scriptable app. NB Some apps have invisible windows (e.g. omnioutliner has various 'license' windows) so I've added a filtre to only include 'visible' windows. Perhaps that will cause the script to break on some apps. I've tested it on the Finder and OO.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set frontApp to name of first application process whose frontmost is true\nend tell\n\ntell application frontApp\n    \n    set ab to windows whose visible is true\n    set bc to rest of ab\n    \n    try\n        close bc\n    on error\n        repeat with y in bc\n            close y\n        end repeat\n    end try\n    \nend tell\n\nIn general, the frontmost window has an index of 1. So this script makes a list of visible windows and then uses the 'rest' command to make a second list of every item after the first from list 1 (i.e. not window 1).\nAwkwardly, different applications implement 'close' differently. With the Finder you can close a list of windows, with OO you cannot — it generates a -1700 error. So the last part of the script tries to close the list of windows and if that generates an error, it cycles through the list, closing each window sequentially.\n", "Q: MacOS - Where is Terminal themes/profiles utilized by Terminal.app on disk? I know i can export a profile, i can then use it, but if I modify it, i have to export it again, to have a proper backup. \nI'd rather have a symlink to the actual file in use by terminal rather than an exported version of it I have to constantly re-export when i wish to backup my system. \nHowever, I can not find the location where Terminal uses the imported themes.

Intel Power Gadget for Mac v3.6.2 should resolve this issue: https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-power-gadget\nI'm the owner of Intel Power Gadget for Mac. Please contact me at powergadget@intel.com so I can work with you to debug this issue.\n\nA: Other than checking for Catalina-specific updates for Intel Power Gadget, or logging a bug with Intel, you could try disabling other kernel extensions one by one to see if it's related to an interaction to any of those. For example, from your kernel panic I see you could potentially disable:\n\n\n*\n\n*Karabiner\n\n*VirtualBox\n\n*Network sharing (\"filesystems.smbfs\")\n\n\nA: I have a 2019 macbook pro 15\" running 10.15.2 and when I tried to open the intel power gadget, it crashed the entire computer and restarted. I got a message after the reboot saying the computer restarted because of a problem. \nThe crash log points to the kernel extension by intel. I also ran the command line to see the cause of the previous shutdown and it gave a code of -20. I couldn't find any info regarding -20 crash code on macOS. I uninstalled the power gadget. Will see if this solves the problem.\n", "Q: Copy Time Machine backup with rsync Is it possible to copy a Time Machine backup using rsync to another HFS formatted disk?  I am concerned that rsync would not be able to track the hard-linked directories that Time Machine uses.\n\nA: The rsync command is very powerful and versatile, and it can preserve the Hard Links and other crucial information of the Time Machine backup. As from this post (https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-apple-osx-bsd-rsync-copy-hard-links/), you could do:\nrsync -azH /path/to/source /path/to/dest/\nThe flags stand for:\n-a: archive mode (copy direcotries, preserve permisions, groups and ownerships, modification times..)\n-z: compress while transfering to accelerate the copying process\n-H: preserve Hard Links (crucial for Time Machine backups)\nYou could also add -v (for verbose) to visually follow the progress of your backup.\n(I don't know if Time Machine uses numeric group and user IDs, in which case you could add the --numeric-ids flag).\nBTW, you may also want to update your rsync through Homebrew (v. 3.x.x), since the one that ships with Catalina is 2.9.6.\nI would also add an alias to my backup script in my .zshrc file with two purposes: 1. make it easier to run without having to type everyithing again every time I want to backup, 2. make it less prone to destructive human error (such as inverting the path to source and the path to destination).\n", "Q: How can I have unlimited keyboard shortcuts?

However, you should be able to do it, but you will most likely have to manually add shortcuts in plist files.\nI think the answer provided here, as well as this repository, will help you create custom keyboard shortcuts.\nYou can also check out Keyboard Maestro's FAQ on their workarounds to key sequence shortcuts.\n", "Q: Lost folders after upgrading to Catalina. Any chance to recover them? Two days after upgrading to Catalina, I have noticed that some subdirectories are missing. I'm not exactly sure when these directories went missing as I was on vacation, but here is what happened.\n\n\n*\n\n*I upgraded to Catalina few days ago\n\n*Decided to delete some directories, mostly node_modules from old projects, to get some free space.\n\n*After that I didn't touch anything and discovered that some directories are missing when I get back home.\n\n\n\nOriginal size of www directory was somewhere around 55GB and similar size is shown in Finder. DaisyDisk also shows that there are 55GB of hidden files somewhere (it's not telling where).\nsudo du -sh www/ shows directory size of 10MB.\nFree space before deleting node_modules was 11GB and after deleting (now) is 20GB. If files under my www directory were really deleted, free space would be much larger.\nBased on other answers found here and on the Internet, I have tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tried restore using DiskDrill. No success. \n\n*Run First Aid under Disk Utility. No success. \n\n*Relocated Items directory is empty. No success. \n\n*Recovering using Stellar Data Recovery. No success. \n\n*Scanned using GrandPerspective. No success. \n\n\nWhat else can I try? \n\nA: There is a 3rd party app called Stellar Data Recovery. There is a free trial period that can be used to recover your files. I used it about 8 months ago for some lost files and it recovered them for me. It was relatively easy to use as I did it myself and I'm not great at that type of thing. The software sells for $80 but it has a free download. \n", "Q: Will turning on two-factor auth require me to know my security question answers?

That would be a convenient way to solve the problem :)\n\n\nSo, in short, should I press the \"Turn on\" 2FA button in my phone just yet?\n\nA: Turning on two-factor-authentication may require your security questions.\n\nYou might be asked to answer your Apple ID security questions.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/HT204915\nOnce 2FA is activated, your security questions are deleted.\n\nDo I still need to remember any security questions?\nNo. With two-factor authentication, you don't need to remember any security questions. We verify your identity exclusively using your password and verification codes sent to your trusted devices and phone numbers. When you enroll in two-factor authentication, we keep your old security questions on file for two weeks in case you need to return your account to its previous security settings. After that, they're deleted.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/HT204915\nTherefore, I suggest you attempt to set it up, since the use of ‘may’ in the first quote means there is potential that the security questions are not asked for, and it you are successful in setting up 2FA your security questions are removed. However, this is on the condition you have a trusted device to receive the authentication prompt, which requires you to be logged in to your Apple ID on the device.\n", "Q: How do I change my UserId on Apple Developer Forums? How do I change my userid on the Apple Developer Forums?  As shown in the below screenshot, it seems there is no way to change this. Do I need to simply call Apple support?\n\n\nA: Yes, you are correct. \nYou'll need to contact Apple Developer Account Support. However, in most cases you will get an answer as once your account is created, you will not be able to change your username that appeared when creating a username, and suggest registering a new Apple ID for the developer.\nSo, if you don't care, you can probably create a new user.\nOr at least first give a try asking Apple Developer Account Support team. \n\nA: I called Apple Developer support and was informed that I am not able to change my developer forum userID as it is tied to my Apple ID.

I've created a hidden \".dotfiles\" folder within the home folder, moved the dotfiles into it, then symlinked them back into the home folder with:\nln -s <dotfile name> ..\n\nHowever, terminal complains that the commands associated with those dotfiles are no longer found.  I'm not sure what exactly I'm doing wrong, but any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Your ln syntax is wrong, which is leading to self-referential symbolic links. For example:\n% mkdir .dotfiles\n% cd .dotfiles/\n% touch .foo\n% ln -s .foo ..\n% cd ..\n% ls -l .foo\nlrwxr-xr-x  1 tph  wheel  4 Dec  5 10:38 .foo@ -> .foo\n\nAt this point .foo exists but it's a symlink to itself, not to the copy in .dotfiles.\nProbably the easiest way to do it is to cd ~ and make the symlinks from there:\n% cd ~\n% ln -s .dotfiles/.foo .\n% ls -l .foo \nlrwxr-xr-x  1 tph  wheel  14 Dec  5 10:46 .foo@ -> .dotfiles/.foo\n\n\nA: ls -l in upper directory to see what the link points to.\nYou might find it should be\ncd ..\nln -s dotfile_dir/dotfile_name .\n\n\nA: Assuming the .dotfiles directory was added to $HOME, and you've moved the target dot files into it, then use the following compound command in Terminal:\n Hint: Copy and paste the for in do command, no need to type it.\ncd .dotfiles\nfor f in .??*; do [ ! \"$f\" == \".DS_Store\" ] || continue; ln -s \"${HOME}/.dotfiles/${f}\" \"${HOME}/${f}\"; done\n\nThen close and reopen Terminal.\nThis will create a proper working symlink for each dot file in the $HOME/.dotfiles directory into the $HOME directory, because fully qualified pathnames were used. \n\nNote: The use of ?? in .??* is so you do not try making a symlink to . and .. in the .dotfiles directory as they already exist in $HOME and you wouldn't want them symlinked anyway. Without the qualifier you'll get ln: ..//.: File exists and ln: ..//..: File exists. There could also be a .DS_Store file, which you do not want to symlink either, so [ ! \"$f\" == \".DS_Store\" ] || continue; handles it.\n", "Q: Is it possible to renew an Apple Enterprise License prior to deadline As we come to year end, I wanted to get handle on our licensing.

I would like to create an apple script that checks if a window of an application with a specific name (not id or index) exists. I used the following code in a previous script, and it works:\ntell application \"Notes\" to close (every window whose name is \"Notes\")\n\nHowever, I can't figure out how to check if a window with this title exists. This should be incredibly simple. How do I do it?\n\nA: You can do this with the System Events application - for example:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    if exists (window \"Terminal — -zsh\" of process \"Terminal\") then\n        display dialog \"Found\"\n    else\n        display dialog \"Not found\"\n    end if\nend tell\n\nNote that process is case sensitive while window is not.  Therefore this will work\nif exists (window \"TeRmInAl — -ZsH\" of process \"Terminal\")\nbut this will not\nif exists (window \"Terminal — -zsh\" of process \"terminal\")\n\nIf you are running from Script Editor you must authorise it in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility\n\n\nA: Yes, it is simple and there is no need, in this case, to involve System Events. Just ask Notes directly if the window exists, e.g.:\ntell application \"Notes\"\n    exists window \"Notes\"\nend tell\n\nThis returns either true or false, however the code in this form may not be as useful as either wrapping the query in an if statement block or assigning the results to a variable, e.g.:\ntell application \"Notes\"\n    if exists window \"Notes\" then\n        # Do something.\n    else\n        # Do something else.\n    end if\nend tell\n\nOr:\ntell application \"Notes\"\n    set itExists to exists window \"Notes\"\n    if itExists then\n        # Do something.\n    else\n        # Do something else.\n    end if\nend tell \n\n", "Q: error using tty.usbserial-xxxx: could not open, resource busy Since one year I'm using a MacBook Pro 13 upgraded to Catalina in October.

It wasn't until later I realised Photos doesn't store albums literally in an album:folder mapping.\nI don't even know if Photos retains the original file-name or not?\nI have software that expects photos to be in a single folder, with sequential naming (like how they normally are on a camera), to create a time-lapse video.\nHow can I get this out of Photos from an album?\n\nA: If you select all the photos that you want to export, you can go to File -> Export. You can then chose to export the original files or compress versions. In either case, you can choose to have the exported files keep their original file names, or just be pure sequential (1.jpeg, 2.jpeg, 3.jpeg, etc), optionally starting with a prefix of your choice. \n\nA: You can use AppleScript to do this if you fancy a bit of automation through scripting.  Although there doesn't seem to be a specific scripting option to name the exported files numerically, the photos will get exported in the order that they were in on your camera, and they'll retain the same filenames too.\nIn Script Editor, create a new script and try this code out, adjusting the album name and export path accordingly:\ntell application id \"com.apple.photos\"\n    set photos to every media item in the album named \"Seville\"\n    export the photos to \"/Users/CK/Pictures/Seville\"\nend tell\n\nIn my case, the album \"Seville\" was a top-level album, and not one that was nested deep inside other folders.

I have a simple question: I bought a NAS from Synology and I copy my files from macOS (my filesystem is AFPS) to the NAS with Samba, formatted in ext4. Sometimes I also copy files from AFPS to NTFS (I'm using the Paragon Software). I never had any problems, but I want to be sure: Can there be problems due to these different file systems for example that files won't be copied, because the target system doesn't support the filename? macOS would tell me, if this is the case?\n\nA: Files content is just bytes and the FS job is to handle it and that's all, by copying a file you just copy the bytes and not how it being handled. SMB send the data as a raw data and the \"other side\" receive it as a raw data and handle this data according to it's rules.\nSo to answer your question, the FS does not matter.\n\nA: This article suggests that the illegal character issue is a function of the OS, more than the file system. So you can write chars like * and | to an NTFS filename using MacOS, but it will cause trouble when viewed on a Windows platform.\nOf course, NASes use an OS to serve the files: Synology uses a Linux-based system. As Unixy cousins, things should be similar. If Windows were in the mix somewhere, then there might be problems. \nTo answer your last question: MacOS can only tell you what the server OS provides to it. If the server OS misunderstands the filename and parses it differently, that may not necessarily generate an error, even if the file doesn't save as expected.\nAnother possible problem when passing files across different file systems and OSes is whether extended attributes remain associated with the file. I would expect a Synology NAS to handle this correctly, but it's worth checking.\n", "Q: Do the version 4 Boot Camp Windows drivers depend on any older versions being installed beforehand? When Snow Leopard was released in 2009, both its installation DVD included with all sold Mac machines and the retail DVD that could be purchased directly through Apple included version 3 of the Boot Camp Windows drivers. Throughout the version 3.x lifecycle, several updates were released - 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 can still be downloaded from the Apple website and each makes it explicitly clear that it requires the previous version to install - see the following URL for an example (See the \"System Requirements\" section):\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/dl1443\nSo - my question. If you are trying to install Windows 7 on an older Mac model (let's take the MacBook Pro Early 2009 as an example), the latest version of the Boot Camp drivers to support this particular model would appear to be 4.0.4033 (https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1630) - however, what isn't clear from this download page is whether a previous version of the drivers need to be installed - as was the case with Boot Camp version 3.x. \nWould anybody be able to clarify: can Boot Camp 4 simply be installed onto a freshly-installed Windows 7, or must an older version of the drivers be installed beforehand?\n\nA: Boot Camp 4 can simply be installed onto a freshly-installed Windows 7. An older version of the drivers does not need to be installed beforehand. You should install Windows to BIOS boot. \nFYI:\nIf you want to deviate from the official version of Windows that Apple had documented to support, then  you may be able to do so. However, often this requires some special procedure to correctly install. For example, installing a 64 bit version instead of a 32 bit version. Or, installing Windows 10 on a machine that officially only supports Windows 7. Many answers here a Ask Different have been posted on this subject.

No Finder window pops up, which means that the folder they were originally residing in, no longer exists.\nIs there a way to reveal the file name and folder location of these \"lost\" referenced files so I can repair my Photos database?\nNote: since the internal storage structure of the Photos Library changed dramatically in Catalina, I'm explicitly referring to Catalina in this question as I suppose it might affect the answer.\n\nA: I couldn't find anything in Automator so I decided to explore a copy of the SQLite database stored in the Photos Library.photoslibrary bundle managed by Photos.\nThe instructions apply to macOS Catalina and may not work for earlier/later macOS versions.\n⚠️ Warning: Never edit this database as it is managed by Photos.app.\nI used the DB Browser for SQLite app for the job.\nFirst copy the database to a working directory (assuming ~/PhotosDBCopy/):\nOpen a Terminal and type:\n$ mkdir ~/PhotosDBCopy/\n$ cp -pr ~/Pictures/Photos\\ Library.photoslibrary/database/ ~/PhotosDBCopy/\n\nNow launch the DB Browser for SQLite app and open the following database: ~/PhotosDBCopy/Photos.sqlite\nThe referenced images are listed in the ZFILESYSTEMBOOKMARK table. The original file paths are stored in the ZPATHRELATIVETOVOLUME column.\nClose Photos.app.\nMake sure you place the originals on your filesystem at the location given in the ZPATHRELATIVETOVOLUME column.\nOnce all photos have been placed in their initial folders (prior to moving them elsewhere), you can re-open Photos.app. The red line across the 'referenced' overlay icon will be gone for the referenced images, which means that Photos.app found the referenced originals on the filesystem.\nYou can now consolidate your Photos database. Upon completion, it is normally safe to delete again the recovered originals as they have now been copied into the Photos database (no more 'referenced\" overlay icon on the photos).\n", "Q: Copy a Time Machine \"backup\" from the TimeCapsule to a HD I'm reading this, but I'm concerned about one point.\nIn the Check the format section, it says the drive has to be Journaled HFS+ and have a GPT map.

You can't copy a Time Machine backup to your APFS drive. If the drive does not have important data you can erase it exactly as described in the Apple article and copy your Time Machine backup.\nBut, I don't see any benefit in that for you.

I just need to enter something like:\n[green] The file was approved. [/green] <-- this is just for illustration purposes since this question field doesn't have colors. These tags have no effect on the system.\nor \n[red] The file was denied. [/red].\nSince the system is online, I can't use direct commands to set the color the text like we would do using TextEdit or any other real editor. So I wonder if there is a way to set the color of the text via Applescript (Automator Service) and send it to the clipboard because I know the browser will paste the formatted text with the right color.\nAny other workaround will be appreciated.\n\nA: As I do not have access to the web app you are using, I really cannot test if this will work for you.\nThe example AppleScript code, shown further below, with limited testing works for me as coded under macOS High Sierra.\nOverview: Gets the selected text in Google Chrome and places it on the clipboard in the chosen color as HTML data, and pastes it back over the selected text.1 \nIt uses an Automator Service, set to Service receives selected text in Google Chrome, with [] Output replaces selected text left unchecked, to which a keyboard shortcut was assigned in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services as: ⌃⌘C\nThe Automator Service uses a Run AppleScript action with the default code replaced entirely with the example AppleScript code.\nUsage: After selecting text in Google Chrome then pressing ⌃⌘C a choose from list dialog box is shown where you can select which color to make the selected text on the clipboard. You do not need to use the mouse, just keystrokes, e.g. G-Enter for green, O-Enter for orange and R-Enter for red, or Esc to cancel the action.\nAt this point, if all works right, the selected text will have been replaced with the colored text from the clipboard.1 (You will have to give it a second to let the service complete.)\nYes, it's a few keystrokes, but once comfortable with it I believe it will become second nature and be faster then having to reach for the mouse, etc.\nThe usual caveats may apply for the use of this in: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility \n1Also note that the text box containing the selected text must allow pasting back the same HTML class data type and structure that was placed on the clipboard as given in the comments to the OP as answers to the questions I asked, otherwise this will not work as coded. \n\nExample AppleScript code:\n--  # Green HTML Color: #27ae60     '23323761653630'\n--  # Orange HTML Color: #e67e22;       '23653637653232'\n--  # Red HTML Color: #d35400       '23643335343030'\n--  # sed command 'placeholder'     '706C616365686F6C646572'\n\nproperty myBrowser : \"Google Chrome\"\n\nproperty greenHTML : «data HTML3C6D65746120636861727365743D277574662D38273E3C7370616E207374796C653D22636F6C6F723A233030666630303B223E706C616365686F6C6465723C2F7370616E3E0A»\nproperty orangeHTML : «data HTML3C6D65746120636861727365743D277574662D38273E3C7370616E207374796C653D22636F6C6F723A236536376532323B223E706C616365686F6C6465723C2F7370616E3E0A»\nproperty redHTML : «data HTML3C6D65746120636861727365743D277574662D38273E3C7370616E207374796C653D22636F6C6F723A236433353430303B223E706C616365686F6C6465723C2F7370616E3E0A»\n\nproperty tmpHTMLdata : \"/private/tmp/tmpHTMLdata\"\n\n\non run {input, parameters}\n    activate me\n    set selectedText to item 1 of input as text\n\n    set chosenColor to (choose from list ¬\n        {\"Green\", \"Orange\", \"Red\"} with title ¬\n        \"Color Chooser\" with prompt ¬\n        \"Which color to make the selected text?\") as text\n\n    if (chosenColor as text) is \"false\" then\n        return\n    else if chosenColor is \"Green\" then\n        my writeToFile(greenHTML, tmpHTMLdata, true)\n    else if chosenColor is \"Orange\" then\n        my writeToFile(orangeHTML, tmpHTMLdata, true)\n    else if chosenColor is \"Red\" then\n        my writeToFile(redHTML, tmpHTMLdata, true)\n    end if\n\n    do shell script \"sed -i '' -e 's|placeholder|\" & selectedText & \"|' \" & quoted form of tmpHTMLdata\n    set the clipboard to (read tmpHTMLdata as «class HTML»)\n    delay 0.25\n    tell application myBrowser to activate\n    delay 0.25\n    tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"v\" using command down\nend run\n\n\non writeToFile(theData, theFile, overwriteExistingContent)\n    try\n        set theOpenedFile to open for access POSIX file theFile with write permission\n        if overwriteExistingContent is true then set eof of theOpenedFile to 0\n        write theData to theOpenedFile starting at eof\n        close access theOpenedFile\n    on error eStr number eNum\n        try\n            close access file theFile\n        end try\n        display dialog eStr & \" number \" & eNum ¬\n            buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1 ¬\n            with title \"File I/O Error...\" with icon stop\n        return\n    end try\nend writeToFile\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and other than any included error handling does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate.

I'm primarily listen to Spotify and I know it has shortcuts but that requires me to make the Spotify window active which it rarely is.\nI've looked into both Google and the shortcut options Apple provides me and I have yet to find a way to set up a global shortcut for the Media Keys (Next, Prev. Play/Pause) \nAny help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: With the advent of Shortcuts on macOS Monterey, you don't need so many steps now.\nYou need to just create a shortcut which runs the macOS Play/Pause action and then make it a Quick Action, check Finder, and set your keyboard shortcut.\nHere is an example shortcut I created: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/aa8c4a50ec5d4960a6e05893cda51ccf\nOn Ventura, you can do this all within the Shortcuts app. Launch it, then search for \"pause\", and assign the \"Run with\" keyboard shortcut you want. You also won't need to select Finder anymore; you can instead leave Services Menu as the default checked item. Here's what it looks like when you're done in Shortcuts:\n\n\nA: This solution is a bit of a workaround, but I think that it should work for you. \nFirst, you can write some AppleScripts that will perform the actions Next, Prev., and  Play/Pause. I found some examples here. If you are on macOS Catalina, you will need to replace \"iTunes\" with \"Music\", unless you only use Spotify and don't want to check for other open applications.\nNext, you can create a Quick Action (also known as a service) in Automator. I found some instructions to do that here.\nFor each AppleScript (Next, Prev, Play/Pause), you can either save it as an application, and set the service to open that application, or you can have your service run the AppleScript directly by using the Run AppleScript variable in Automator.\nWhen you save each service, give it a name (like next, prev, and play), as that will be what shows up in the shortcuts menu.\nNow that you have 3 services, you can go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Services. You can now set a keyboard shortcut to run each service, which in turn should run the AppleScript to perform the Media Action you want. The services you just made should be in the General section, which is at the very bottom of the list for me.\n\nA: I had a similar problem, using a basic, non-apple, USB keyboard pressing F8 wouldn't pause my music whether or not I checked the \"Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys\" option.\nI spent a while trying to get Applescripts to control Chrome but it was more complicated than controlling Spotify.\nWhat ended up helping was installing Karabiner-Elements. Without any extra configuration, now pressing F8 works to control media.\n\nA: Everything in @beninato's answer worked for me. The only thing I had trouble with was that when setting the keyboard shortcut for the services I created, it had to include the command key for the service to be run by the shortcut.\nMaybe that was your issue @Mestika?\n", "Q: How is it possible for Maps in iOS 13 to have location permissions set to \"Whilst Using\" but provide navigation instructions in the background? Whilst taking a look at the apps that have permissions to view my location in iOS 13.2.3 from Settings/Privacy/Location Services, I've noticed that the stock Maps app is only listed as having access to my location \"Whilst Using\". Interestingly, however, whilst a navigation is in progress I can appear to be able to navigate away from the app to my Home Screen and still receive navigational instructions. Is this due to this app using a different location model to apps downloaded from the App Store?

Smart Folders are folders that are occupied by a search action. The smart folder finds and organizes the results of a find operation. Another more descriptive answer is found here and here.\nYou create a smart folder by going to the Finder and then selecting create a smart folder from the File menu. The smart folder looks like the image below.\n\nBy clicking the + button you below the search bar you can add more criteria to your search. Hence you can fine-tune the contents of your smart folder. \n", "Q: Basic 'print' & 'puts' Mac OS terminal commands not found I followed this article to install & update ruby with a package manager but I clearly messed up somewhere.\nhttps://stackify.com/install-ruby-on-your-mac-everything-you-need-to-get-going/\nIf I try to 'puts' or 'print' anything I get -bash: print: command not found / -bash: puts: command not found returned.\n'ls' & 'cd' commands still work for example, but echo $path returns nothing.\nAs you have probably guessed, I am completely new to code & stupidly copy pasted lines into the shell that I don't understand.\nIs this a path issue?\n\nA: *\n\n*print is not a standard bash command.

HDD now cannot be mounted? My friend's 2012 iMac attempted to self update over night and it resulted in the prohibited sign on a gray screen this morning and so, the iMac does not boot anymore!\nHere are all the things I've tried so far:\n1) Holding down SHIFT on power up to go to safe mode, results in black progress bar followed by prohibited sign.\n2) Holding down CMD-R on power up to go to the recovery console, results in black progress bar followed by prohibited sign.\n3) Holding down CMD-OPT-R on power up to go to the online recovery console, this works, it connects to the WiFi and boots into the recovery console successfully.\n3a) From that online console, I can go to Disk Utility and I see the internal 1TB HDD, but I cannot mount it as it does nothing when selecting the MOUNT item.  Also, that HDD (disk0) information is very minimal like the drive was inaccessible or something.  However, from the Terminal > \"diskutil list\" command, I can see two partitions inside disk0, but nothing happens when I mount or force mount any of them: disk0s1 (150MB EFI) and disk0s2 (1000GB APFS)\n3b) In Disk Utility, I tried to use the First Aid functionality on disk0 (not the actual partitions since Disk Utility does not show them, but rather the root disk element itself) and it's been sitting there in a popup window displaying \"Running First Aid...\" without any sort of progress for an hour now.  It does not list or show anything happening in that window and there is no cancel or close button either.  I forced a power down on this one as it was not seemingly working at all.\n4) Holding down SHIFT-CMD-OPT-R on power up to go to the online factory reset console, this works, it connects to the WiFi and boots into the recovery console successfully.  In Disk Utility, I GUID partitioned an external 500GB USB HDD and formatted it as HFS+ then proceeded to install Mac OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) which is what the factory reset console suggests and what my friend says the iMac came with in 2012.  It took 3.5 hours and it worked.\n4a) I understand that APFS is only available since High Sierra and not Mountain Lion so installing Mountain Lion as per described in 4) is useless even tough it worked, because obviously, the HDD wasn't mountable using 10.8.  So I opened the iMac and replaced the internal hard drive with a brand new one.  I am now attempting the same as 4) with 10.15 Catalina instead, which is suggested when booting the iMac via the online recovery console (CMD-OPT-R) anyway. I am sure this will work (3 hours left to install) but since I want to get the DATA back from the old drive, I'm eager to see if connecting the older drive via USB will make it mountable after booting 10.15 Catalina via the brand new internal hard drive.\nEDIT: So, this morning, Catalina has finished downloading/installing (4a, above) on the brand new internal HDD that I've installed yesterday evening.  So the iMac works flawlessly now, and thanks to iCloud syncs, almost every document is back in the computer, it's still downloading documents right now so I'll wait until it's all done (is there a way to know when an iCloud sync back is completely finished anyone?).  The old internal drive, which I've attached via USB DOES NOT MOUNT, still. And Disk First Aid still seems stuck on diagnosing the drive! So it may just be dead, like you mentioned. I'll leave Disk First Aid run for 2 hours and I'll report back afterwards.\nI am aware of those 2 interesting ideas, however like I mentioned, we cannot access disk0s2 to browse/delete files.\nSystem won't boot after attempting 10.13.4 update\nOSX Prohibited symbol on Boot (High Sierra Update Caused)\nAny more ideas? We do NOT have another Mac, this is the only Mac we can use.  However, I have some external drives that we could format and use.  Also, internet is very slow here (booting to online recovery console begins by downloading like 1GB of DATA and this takes almost half an hour!) so the most preferred method would not imply downloading gigabytes of install files, unless it's actually mandatory.\n\nA: There are two possibilities. There have been reports of Catalina causing some corruption to the EFI firmware partition. However, if the iMac was running auto-updates, then it should have already updated to Catalina? In which case that's probably not the case.\nThe other possibility is that the 7-year-old internal hard drive has failed. The computer itself seems to be working as you've booted to an external. \nDrive failure often happens to old drives after an OS upgrade (\"The new OS broke my drive!\") because writing several GB of files to the drive is the 'final straw that breaks the camel's back'.  \nIt's possible that the drive may mount and be read once you've booted to a Catalina OS. You might need to run third-party disk recovery software like Data Rescue.\nHowever, if the drive will not mount at all, then data recovery becomes much more difficult. And by difficult, I mean expensive.\nThis is where I ask you if you have a backup.\n", "Q: Cannot ls ~/.Trash in the Terminal in Catalina (operation not permitted) Ever since buying a new Mac, which has forced me to upgrade to Catalina, I cannot view the Trash folder in the Terminal. ls ~/.Trash just gives ls: .Trash: Operation not permitted.

According to ls -al ~, the permissions for ~/.Trash are drwx------, and the owner is me. sudo chmod a+x ~/.Trash and sudo rm -rf ~/.Trash both fail with the same error.\nIs it possible to view the Trash in the terminal in Catalina?\n\nA: You have to give the Terminal.app Full Disk permissions in the security settings.\n\n\nA: I have gone through many solutions and this one is the best. Let me tell you that this also does not help to delete the files but makes life easy.\nBy giving the 'Full Disk Access' to terminal you can actually go inside with 'cd' and see the content and even by giving '777' permission to all the content there you can move everything outside '.Trash' in some other folder and keep the stuff parked there. This will get away the annoying 'Files are in use' warning and you can use empty your trash bin normally.\nThis is a great solution, if you do not mind one unnecessary folder of 0 size lying in your disk.\n", "Q: Yahoo taking over my google search My default search engine is google, but when i search it goes to yahoo.

If you lack these (either because you deleted them or never had them installed first hand) and never registered the purchase with your Apple ID, you need to work your way up through the missing years of upgrading, including the registration with your Apple ID to be offered an installation on any system that's older than the currently shipped Mojave:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install an old iWork suite (from your original installation medium, or use the iWork ’09 trial suite that can still be downloaded from Apple.\n\n*You now have an iWork 09 folder inside your Applications folder, containing trial versions of Pages, Numbers and Keynote.\n\n*Launch Pages, Numbers and Keynote, then quit each app. (This step was suggested by the instructions based on the 2014 article. It doesn't seem to be necessary any more - I had only launced one of the programs.)\n\n*The trial suite can be upgraded to iWork 9.3 with a downloader available at Apple - Support - Downloads. I cannot verify if this step is necessary since I had installed that upgrade. I suspect it can be skipped.\n\n*You still have an iWork 09 folder inside your Applications folder, containing trial versions of Pages (v4.3), Numbers (v2.3) and Keynote (v5.3).\n\n*Launch the Mac App Store, go to the updates tab, and activate show incompatible updates. Selecting one of those apps will take you to the app's page. There, select update. The store asks for purchase confirmation and your password (if required by your settings). Then it will attempt to update the application, and fail, telling you that they require 10.14. Repeat for all three (five, if you installed iMovie and Garageband from your original DVDs) applications anyway, since from then on this application will appear in your Purchased tab. (Note: The Purchased tab disappeared with MacOS 10.14 - High Sierra might be the last OS to handle this step)\n\n*Now your purchase is linked to your account, and you may reinstall those applications if they ever should get lost. So let's loose them: delete the iWork09 folder from Applications (or move it to the Thrash).\n\n*Go to the purchased tab in App Store. The applications are listed at the top of the purchased list. Upon selecting install, you will be prompted if you want to install the last supported version for your OS release. \n\n\n*You now have Pages (v8.1), Numbers (v6.1) and Keynote (v9.1) directly in your Applications folder. (Version numbers applying to High Sierra as of January 2020)\nAlternative route\nIf you have access to another Mac running a version of MacOS currently supported by the App Store (As of Jan 2020, that would be 10.14 (Mojave) or 10.15), you could associate your AppleID with an account on that Mac, download (and thus register) the Applications you want to install on your older Mac there, and then use the Purchased tab on the older Mac to reinstall older versions of those apps on the older Mac.\nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*2014 Redmondpie article\n\n*2014 Cult of Mac article\n\n*2018 osxdaily article \"Where to Download Old Mac OS Software\"\n\n*MacWorld article about missing purchases tab in Mojave App Store\n\nA: If you go to the Mac App Store and try to install the iWork apps, it should offer you the appropriate versions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Pages\n\n*Numbers\n\n*Keynote\nAre you looking for the older version of iWork before the Mac App Store?

But you cannot buy it because your OSX version is to low.\nIf by any chance you are able to borrow or log into a newer MAC, with the appropriate OS you can \"purchase\" the application and download it there.\nNext time you open App Store on your old Mac, you will be given the option to download the last supported version of the app. Since it is registered on your account that you now own the program.\nAlso, having a friend with an Apple ID from which the suite has been downloaded can help. Let him log into App Store on your Mac with his ID. He can then install the program on your Mac. Afterwords you can login yourself. And the app is still yours.\n\nA: I suggest you upgrade to High Sierra. I'm using Pages, Numbers, and KeyNote and have very recent versions that work fine.

So somehow the input source menu is managed differently now, but I have now clue how or how to find out (all searches pointed me to scripts similar to mine)\nUpdate 2019/12/10\nThe suggested solutions so far both have defects, in one case you always get a delay of 5 seconds which is rather long and the trick with killing  \"System Events\" as taken from the other posting doesn't always seem to work, sometimes it results in the script getting a timeout (which is even worse then have the 5 seconds delay all the time), so it looks as if this is still in need for a better solution\n\nA: I stumbled upon the same issue of wanting to switch between multiple input sources with keyboard shortcuts quickly since Catalina broke the old method using AppleScript. Although the above methods work, they're rather clunky, unreliable, and slow (at least for me).\nAfter a bit of digging around the internet I found a better solution. Someone wrote a terminal / command line utility program that changes input source layouts by name that  works really well, and changes input sources instantaneously (tested in Catalina).\nHere are the steps to make it work:\n\n*\n\n*Download the source files from https://github.com/minoki/InputSourceSelector - click on the green button Code → Download ZIP\n\n*Extract the ZIP file\n\n*Open terminal and navigate to the unzipped folder\n\n*Run the make command in that folder, and an executable \"InputSourceSelector\" will be produced. (You may have to add executable permissions to it via chmod +x InputSourceSelector).\n\nNow you can list and switch input sources with these commands:\n\n*\n\n*./InputSourceSelector list-enabled - to list all currently enabled input sources\n\n*./InputSourceSelector current - to show the currently selected input source id\n\n*./InputSourceSelector select <InputSourceId> - to switch to an input source by its id\n\nSee the README on the author's page for more commands.\nThen to switch layouts, use the command 'select' with an <InputSourceId>:\n\n*\n\n*./InputSourceSelector select com.apple.keylayout.US\n\n*./InputSourceSelector select com.apple.keylayout.Dvorak\n\n*./InputSourceSelector select com.apple.keylayout.Spanish\nThe <InputSourceId> is the id before the parentheses, for example:\n\n*\n\n*For \"com.apple.keylayout.US (U.S.)\" the id is \"com.apple.keylayout.US\"\n\n*For \"com.apple.keylayout.Dvorak (Dvorak)\" the id is \"com.apple.keylayout.Dvorak\"\n\n*For \"com.apple.keylayout.Spanish (Spanish)\" the id is \"com.apple.keylayout.Spanish\"\n\nFor ids with spaces, you may have to enclose them in double quotes.\nYou can now place the executable file in '/usr/local/bin' to make it available system-wide, and run the command without the preceding './' from anywhere in the system.\nYou can also make a couple shortcuts to quickly switch between the various input sources in BetterTouchTool or a similar program.\nIn BetterTouchTool just add a global keyboard shortcut, and for the Assigned Action select \"Execute Terminal Command\". In the terminal command window use the command /usr/local/bin/InputSourceSelector select com.apple.keylayout.Dvorak or whatever input source you want to switch to.\n\nA: Unfortunately things have changed in macOS Catalina and you''ll have to activate that menu in a different manner.\nThe following example AppleScript code, shown further below, works for me in macOS Catalina, however as I was testing in a virtual machine I do not know if the time lag in the running of the code, between clicking the target menu and the subsequent code, is inherent of an issue in the virtual machine or it will be the same on a physical machine.\nI do not have German LaTeX2 so I used German instead, although for convenience I have replaced it in the code after testing.\nThe usual caveats apply for the use of this in: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility\nExample AppleScript code: \ntell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n    tell application process \"TextInputMenuAgent\" to ¬\n        tell menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2\n            click\n            click menu item \"German LaTeX2\" of menu 1\n        end tell\n\nThis does the same thing in a different manner, and one of these ways may be faster.\ntell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n    tell application process \"TextInputMenuAgent\" to ¬\n        click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    keystroke \"g\"\n    key code 36\nend tell\n\nTo use the example AppleScript code in a handler:\nchangeKeyboardLayout(\"German LaTeX2\")\n\non changeKeyboardLayout(layoutName)\n    tell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n        tell application process \"TextInputMenuAgent\" to ¬\n            tell menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2\n                click\n                click menu item layoutName of menu 1\n            end tell\nend changeKeyboardLayout\n\nOr the second version of the code:\nchangeKeyboardLayout(\"German LaTeX2\")\n\non changeKeyboardLayout(layoutName)\n    tell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n        tell application process \"TextInputMenuAgent\" to ¬\n            click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        keystroke (first text item of layoutName)\n        key code 36\n    end tell\nend changeKeyboardLayout\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors.\n\nA: For the record, combing the answer how to get to the input source menu in Catalina with an answer that deals with the bug (?) generating a delay  give a version that work as nicely as the old one did:\non changeKeyboardLayout(layoutName)\n    launch application \"System Events\"\n    delay 0.2\n    ignoring application responses\n        tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"TextInputMenuAgent\"\n            click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2\n        end tell\n    end ignoring\n    do shell script \"killall System\\\\ Events\"\n    delay 0.1\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"TextInputMenuAgent\"\n        tell menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2\n            click menu item layoutName of menu 1\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend changeKeyboardLayout\n\nchangeKeyboardLayout(\"German LaTeX2\")\n\nUpdate 2019/12/10\nThe trick with killing  \"System Events\" as taken from the other posting doesn't always seem to work, sometimes it results in the script getting a timeout (which is even worse then have the 5 seconds delay all the time), so it looks as if the solution to my question is still somewhat open\n\nA: I wrote this script a while ago that uses a carbon API to change the keyboard input source through low-level system calls, which would ordinarily be ideal and obviously preferable to manipulating the UI.  That said, it is a couple of years old, and so I couldn't say whether or not it will still be viable in Catalina, not least because carbon is being (or is) deprecated, but the script is written in JavaScript for Automation, which, like AppleScript, is basically falling to bits.\nBut, I'll post it anyway, just in case it does have value in the newer OS setting:\nObjC.import('Carbon');\n\nnil = $();\n\nunwrap = ObjC.deepUnwrap.bind(ObjC);\nbind = ObjC.bindFunction.bind(ObjC);\nbind('CFMakeCollectable', [ 'id', [ 'void *' ] ]);\nRef.prototype.nsObject = function() {\n    return unwrap($.CFMakeCollectable(this));\n}\n\n\nfunction run() {\n    const lang = 'German';\n\n    const currentSource = $.TISCopyCurrentKeyboardInputSource();\n    const sources   = unwrap($.TISCreateInputSourceList(nil, false)),\n          sourceIDs = sources.map(src => $.TISGetInputSourceProperty(\n                                      src,'TISPropertyInputSourceID')\n                             .nsObject()),\n          sourceID  = sourceIDs.filter(src=>src.indexOf(lang)!==-1)[0],\n          source    = unwrap($.TISCreateInputSourceList(\n                            { 'TISPropertyInputSourceID' : sourceID },\n                      false))[0];\n    const status    = $.TISSelectInputSource(source);\n    return (status==0);\n}\n\n\nA: I have found an alternative solution that guarantees no delay, using the system-wide keyboard shortcut ^F8\n(predefined in \"System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Keyboard > Move focus to status menus\")\ncombined with the desired amount of down-arrow key-strokes and a Return, works like a charm\nI wish the above looks like AppleScript for you, the fact is I still can't write the simplest AppleScript after years of using it.\nSo I defined the above series of key-strokes in BetterTouchTool, it does the job :)\n\n", "Q: How to get postfix send mail (with Gmail smtp) under macOS Catalina?

Please note that although this has a similar title to my previous question (Does Apple offer a page that lists all versions of published Boot Camp drivers?), the answer that I'm looking for is much different. :)\nI'm aware that Apple offer multiple versions of Boot Camp drivers for each Mac model, and that there are several different (unsupported) ways of obtaining this. Does anybody happen to have a way of obtaining all of the drivers that Apple host for each Mac model that doesn't require macOS to be used? I realise that these drivers can be downloaded in PKG form, which from my understanding then requires a Mac to extract the *.dmg file from it that can then be used to obtain the contained drivers - I'm hoping for a way to avoid macOS, and use Windows throughout the entire process. Again, just to confirm - I'm not looking to obtain any model-specific drivers, but instead would like to be able to download all drivers hosted by Apple - mainly for archival purposes and to examine the differences between each set of drivers to establish the different drivers that Apple use.\n\nA: You can until the 2015 model year. This is when Boot Camp Assistant application starting installing Windows without the use of a DVD or USB flash drive. Basically, the previous answer explained the drivers can be found using the links provided on the Apple webpage Install Windows 7 on your Mac using Boot Camp. These downloads are in the form a zip files which can be unzipped by Windows or macOS. As I already explained, the Snow Leopard ISO must be mounted on a Windows machine in order to access the Boot Camp files. If you mount the the ISO using macOS, the you will get the Snow Leopard files.\nYou should also note that the Boot Camp Support Software (Windows Support Software) includes Apple Update which often downloads updates to the the Boot Camp Support Software. This no longer works with many of the older versions of the Boot Camp Support Software. However, when you install other Apple Software, an updated version Apple Update may be installed. These updated versions have been know to download updated drivers from Apple, but rarely update Boot Camp itself. Also, Windows Update will also download updated drivers for Macs.\nThe previous answer included a BASH script/function which produced a list of URLs based on a given Mac identifier. When one of these URLs in pasted to Safari, a .pkg file would download containing the .dmg file, which contained the Boot Camp Support Software. I realize this requires a macOS, but the same thing can be done in Windows by using Microsoft Edge and some free third party software.\nFor example, installing git by default provides a BASH window which can execute the GetPkgUrl function. \n\nThe .dmg file can be extracted from the .pkg file by using Easy 7-zip.\n\nAfter clicking on the OK button.\n\nThe result is access to the Boot Camp Support Software, which can be extracted from the .dmg file by using Easy 7-zip.\n\nDid not check every model identifier, but for the iMac14,1 (2013) through iMac19,1 (2019), there is only one .pkg file per identifier. I theorize this is probably true for all 2013 and newer Macs. Therefore, it may to be too difficult getting the Boot Camp Support Software for the latest model Macs. \nI realize what you are really looking for used to exist. When OS X was delivered on DVDs, the current version of the Boot Camp Support Software was included on the DVD. This covered all model Macs up to the release of the DVD. After Apple starting eliminating optical drives starting in 2012, there was a website providing links to the zip downloads. However, by 2015 Apple was switching from websites to the use of the Boot Camp Assistant to download the Boot Camp Support Software. \n", "Q: How to get back Chinese Speech after upgrading to Mojave? After upgrading to Mojave, I cannot use Chinese Speech any more.

I then first removed all the speeches in Chinese inside of System Preferences, and then rebooted the Mac, and then added the speeches back.  After the download, this fixed the problem.\n", "Q: VoiceOver not reading '-' in Xcode VoiceOver interprets a hyphen as a brief pause. That makes sense for hyphenated words, but it makes no sense for sums or for code. For example in Xcode this line\nnumberOfGuesses -= 1\n\nis rendered as \"number of guesses, equals one\" by VoiceOver. That's terrible. How do I make VoiceOver behave sensibly for the minus sign in Xcode?\n\nA: In VoiceOver Utility, you can go to the Pronunciation tab of the Speech section, and set up custom pronunciations. I've never used VoiceOver before, but I was able to get some custom pronunciations working. I set -= to be replaced by minus equals, and that seemed to work. Additionally, you can make these custom pronunciations app specific, or work in all apps, if you only want Xcode to read hyphens as minus signs. See here for more details.\n", "Q: AirPods Pro: clogged ears (Airplane Ear or Eardrum Suck effect) with noise cancellation turned on I have recently bought a pair of AirPods Pro and noticed a strange effect. It is difficult to explain, but it feels like a bit softer clogged ears (Airplane Ear) effect. The same like in the airplane or mountains when you move fast up or down. You naturally want to swallow in order to unclog ears and it helps for some time, but then the effect repeats. In transparency mode or with noise cancellation turned off everything feels normally, like generic in-ear headphones.\nIt is easier to notice this effect when sitting in the almost silent room with AirPods Pro turned on, but without music.\nSo the question is does anyone also experience the same? Maybe it is a common effect for in-ear headphones with noise cancellation and other brands are affected too? Or should I bring them to service?\n\nA: The effect you are describing is commonly referred to as \"eardrum suck\". It's a common complaint for any type of noise-cancelling earphones.\nOnly some people are sensitive to it, and the stronger the noise-cancellation, the more likely it will bother you. Headphones seem more likely to cause it than earbuds.\nAccording to Brent Butterworth, a headphone reviewer, it's an aural illusion caused by the nature of noise cancelling circuitry (there is no pressure on your eardrum, it just feels that way). It's a little difficult to explain succinctly, but this article goes into all the details: https://www.soundstagesolo.com/index.php/features/178-eardrum-suck-the-mystery-solved\n", "Q: Can I completely turn off the fans on a MacBook Pro (0 RPM) I would like to know if there is a utility to completely turn off the fans. \nCurrently, when completely idle, fans are showing 2000 and 2100 RPM.\nAlthough this is probably not recommended, I would like to have the option to completely shut them down.\nSoftware such as 1 enable fan control but only lets you lower the RPM to the minimum set by Apple (which is 2000 and 2100 for each fan respectively),but I’m looking for an off switch. \nWhen the CPU is idling, this should help preserve some battery life, and prevent dust from accumulating.\nI am fully aware that this can damage the system and am not recommending this to anyone.\nThe question is whether this could be done and not whether this should be done.\n\nA: Disabling the fans is not recommended but appears possible through the software below:\n\nsmc-command\nThis tool will allow you to write values to the SMC which could irreversably damage your computer.\n...\nThis program will allow you to read and write values to the SMC using the AppleSMC kernel\n  extension.

From there on every time I try log in to my account a status bar appears and then the whole system shuts down. Same thing happens in Safe mode. \nIn recovery mode I tried a clean OS install but the wizard said that there is 0kB free on my disk. I imagine the installer from the previous upgrade attempt is still somewhere on my disk, taking up a lot of space. \nSo I tried launching a terminal and deleting random unneeded files.\nAfter having deleted probably between 500 and 1000 MB of data, I tried restarting and logging in, but the system shuts down at the same point in that login status bar. \nFileVault is enabled on my laptop. \nHow can I recover my laptop?\n\nA: There are a few good suggestions here.

I have an essential tremor. This means that the slightest unintentional graze on the Touch Bar or touchpad on my MacBook Pro can have extremely undesirable consequences.\nSo how can I change the sensitivity on those input devices and yet retain the key functionality of those devices? The key functions provided by the Touch Bar are the escape key (accidental grazes are easy and can have extreme consequences), and changing the sound volume or screen brightness. All other features of the Touch Bar are accessible by other means.\nThe touchpad also has key functionality, but not quite as critical as the escape key. But once again, slight grazes can result in highly undesirable effects.\nHow can I change the sensitivity on the Touch Bar and the touchpad and still retain the essential functionality provided by those input devices?\n\nA: Many of us have difficulties with aspects of UI design, both in hardware and software. Look past the frustration and think around the problem. \nA simple fix for me was to attach an external keyboard, wired at first, but then wireless using a Matias 101-key keyboard with the number pad on the right, a design I've been using since the DEC VT220 terminal keyboard came out a few decades ago. I also use Apple's wireless trackpad, which is larger, and sits where it should be - next to the keyboard.\nI see Matias now has a backlit model! How cool!\nBe well. Take a deep breath and center yourself.\n\nA: Quoting from your comment to @IconDaemon's answer:\n\nThis answer suggests adding a usable keyboard and a usable touchpad. Oh, my aching back! I want those capabilities built-in to my luggable-around laptop, in the form of a usable UX\n\nYou can consider getting a recently introduced (released November 13) 16\" MacBook Pro (or at least give it a try in one of the nearest Apple stores). Your issue primarily appears to be with the following things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Difficulty using the keyboard.\n\n*Touch Bar sensitivity.\n\n*Unintentional taps on Esc key and difficulty using it.\nWhile #1 can be subjective, the 2016 - Mid 2019 Mac portable lineup with Butterfly key mechanism has been widely regarded as being not as intuitive as the previous 2015 and older, Scissor mechanism based keyboards.\nRecently introduced Late 2019 16\" MacBook Pro apparently fixes all the above issues (especially with regard to keyboard and the Esc key)to a great extent. They are discussed below respectively:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Scissor switch mechanism is back. The keys are marginally smaller in size and a tiny bit further spaced apart compared to one from Butterly era (2016 - Mid 2019). They have more key travel (approximately somewhere between older Scissor switches and the Butterfly switches), thereby giving better tactile feedback. The keys themselves are more stable and doesn't wobble as much as it did in the older Scissor switches (2015 and older). As an additional benefit, there's much lesser bleeding of backlight from the sides of the keys.\n\n*Touch Bar is spaced further apart from the numeric keys row, thereby reducing the chance of accidental taps to a certain extant.\n\n*Physical Esc key is back.\nSo if the keyboard is the major sore point with the MacBook, your can consider test driving a 16\" 2019 MacBook Pro.\nAs far as the Trackpad is concerned, try tweaking the Trackpad settings under System Preferences and see if that resolves the issues to a certain extent. There are many 3rd party apps available that lets you further fine tune the Trackpad settings.\n\nA: I would hate to just say - Sell it, take satisfaction that you learned from the mistake in time and money you spent, find a machine or tool that doesn't irritate / ruin the experience of the things you care about.\nThe first draft of your question shows you aren't new to using tech, have very reasonable expectations and very specific complaints about track pad sensing your tremors in digits and not your overall intentions to move the pointer. \nI would map the caps lock key to be escape even if you have a physical escape key.  That changed my life on my first TouchBar mac at work. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207358\nI wonder if mouse keys in accessibility plus disabling trackpad input is overkill, but it’s very worth exploring. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/accessibility/mac/mobility/\nThe voice control / accessibility keyboard is also something that with head tracking, might be awesome for cursor control and customizing input.

There's two ways. First, you can bind two different macros to the same shortcut. When you trigger it, a palette pops up and you just type the first letter of the macro you want to trigger (or more if they have names that begin with the same letters). For example, if I have two macros triggered by Cmd+S called \"high\" and \"him\" then you'd need to type \"hig\" to trigger the first.\nAlternatively, you could use a  \"Prompt with List\" list and use switch/case.

See if this one does what you need.\n\nA: Seems I didn't finish the keyboard wizard for the new keyboard.\nWent to settings - keyboard, there it popped up and it asked me exactly for the key right to the left shift key. That's exactly the key causing issues for me. I pressed that key, the wizard recommended me european keyboard layout, I accepted.\nVoila, the key now writes < and with shift >. One thing that didnt work was writing the pipe symbol together with the option key.\nI added this rule to DefaultKeyBinding.dict:\n\"~<\" = (\"insertText:\", \"|\");\n\nLogged out and in, and now I can also write the pipe symbol with option key and the <>| key.\nLesson learned: unicode code for a key depends on the chosen keyboard layout.\n", "Q: Shortcut for mirroring touch bar I would like to see an emulated touchbar on my iMac. \nI randomly pressed the shotcut for it, but I don't know, which it was and I couldn't find it one the internet either. Btw., I don't use an Apple keyboard, so i.e. the fn key is missing.\n\n\nA: You can show the Touch Bar on your screen using Xcode by choosing Window → Show Touch Bar or shift-cmd-8.\n", "Q: Zulip desktop app has \"no available windows\" I have the Zulip desktop app installed on Mojave 10.14.6, and I often cannot open any Zulip windows. When I right-click on the Zulip icon in the dock and select \"show all windows\", I just see the message \"no available windows.\" I have tried quitting and restarting the app, selecting \"unhide\" from the menu, reset (cmd-R), hard-reset (shift-cmd-R), and various other menu options (such as toggling which organizations to show), with no effect. I have even restarted my laptop without being able to recover.\nI was able to recover the app once by uninstalling and reinstalling, but it soon disappeared again.\nIs there any way to fix this in Zulip specifically or other apps in general?\n\nA: Zulip was in \"minimized\" mode. To show any windows, I needed to click on the tray icon in the upper-right and select one of the menu options.\n\nIn the Zulip \"Settings\" menu, the \"Always start minimized\" option was enabled; I have now disabled it.\n", "Q: colorsync.display high cpu \nPID 217, colorsync.display is pegged at 119% CPU, any ideas what this is or what might be causing it?\n\nEDIT: It is happening again\n\nEDIT EDIT (12/27/2019): Happening again with no cause known yet...\n\nEDIT EDIT EDIT (2/2/2020): Happening again, any ideas?\nThere is no process in Activity Monitor showing that kind of CPU usage\n\n\n\nFull log at https://gist.github.com/jeffreyroberts/22e88a32fe80af06e9aa31a6bdb5eea9\nAnalysis of sampling colorsync.displayservices (pid 214) every 1 millisecond\nProcess:         colorsync.displayservices [214]\nPath:            /usr/libexec/colorsync.displayservices\nLoad Address:    0x10bcb6000\nIdentifier:      colorsync.displayservices\nVersion:         3345.6\nCode Type:       X86-64\nParent Process:  launchd [1]\n\nDate/Time:       2019-12-08 23:54:17.509 -0500\nLaunch Time:     2019-12-07 21:38:19.656 -0500\nOS Version:      Mac OS X 10.14.6 (18G1012)\nReport Version:  7\nAnalysis Tool:   /usr/bin/sample\n\nPhysical footprint:         11.7M\nPhysical footprint (peak):  11.8M\n----\n\nCall graph:\n    2864 Thread_2260   DispatchQueue_1: com.apple.main-thread  (serial)\n    + 2864 start  (in libdyld.dylib) + 1  [0x7fff666083d5]\n    +   2864 ???

If I filter for colorsync it shows a number of processes, among them colorsync.display, with CPU usage at 0%.\n\nThis may just be a process that gets stuck in htop for some reason.\nUpdate 24th of February 2021: experienced the same on a M1 MacBook Air. Restarting htop removed it from the top CPU-consuming processes listed there.\n\nA: If you use Activity Monitor, you can select the process and Inspect Process CommandI.

Given: Macbook pro 13 Inch with MacOS 10.15.1 (Catalina), 500 GB SSD built in.\nHard drive had 34 GB of free disk space according to diskutil and df -h.\nWanted: Reclaim  free disk space.\nWhat I did:\nI moved a huge folder of 120 GB onto an external disk. Trash was empty. I rebooted the machine, ran Disk Utility's First Aid as well.\nIt remains with 34 GB of free disk space.\nI moved another folder of 9 GB to an external disk drive.\nIt still remained with 34 GB of free disk space.\nI gave the system some hours of probably internal reorganizational tasks (if any... because you'll never know)\nThen I figured out 2 further cache folders on a project holding 25 GB each and removed them via rm -rf. \ndu -sh gave me proof that these 50 GB was really deleted and my whole projects folder was 50 GB smaller than before. \nHowever, my disk is still quite full. Free space: 34 GB.\nHow can I fix this without reformatting and reinstalling everything from scratch?\n\nA: Okay, I can answer by myself.\nIn further investigation I came across the hidden space called local snapshot space that is caused by local time machine snapshots and tried to purge them for giving back at least 100 GB:\n♠ sudo tmutil thinlocalsnapshots / 100g 1 \nPassword:\nThinned local snapshots:\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2019-12-07-134712.local\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2019-12-07-134712.local\n\nAlthough some snapshots should have been deleted, nothing happened in order to show more free disk space. I increased the argument to 110g and now at least 72 GB was released and show up as free disk space.\nI plaid a bit with separate values, found a tool called Daisy Disk that is able to show the size of hidden spaces.\nI tried to remove all these local snapshots with \ntmutil deletelocalsnapshots /\n\nand it seems to remove them. At the end there are still 50 GB of hidden spaces left according to Daisy Disk that I am unable to find their location at the moment.\nIt seems that under the hood APFS would care by itself to free up this space if required.

I have an 2 TB external hard drive. It is formatted as NTFS format, supported by ntfs-3g which is installed using Homebrew. There is already about 500 GB data existing on it that I need to keep. I now want to use the rest of the space on it to store my TimeMachine backups. There is only one partition on the hard drive. I do not have other hard drives to shuffle the data. How can I start to use this hard drive to store my Time Machine backups?\n\nA: Time Machine can only work on a volume formatted as HFS+. So you will need to repartition this drive. A quick Google shows that it is possible to resize an NTFS partition, but this can't be done with Disk Utility on MacOS.\nI wouldn't recommend playing with the partitioning on the volume if the 500Gb of stuff isn't also backed up somewhere else.\n", "Q: What features have been added to the Files app since it was introduced with iOS 11?

You need the private key as well.\nThe private key was probably created along with the original CSR (certificate signing request) sent to Apple. By default, the private key is stored in the user's Keychain.\n\n\n*\n\n*The certificate is public and often stored in an unencrypted .pem file.\n\n*The key is private and often stored in the Keychain or an encrypted .p12 file.\n\n\nNew Certificate and Key\nYou can ask Apple for a new signing certificate, using a new private key and CSR. This does not require administrator access or access to the existing Keychain. You will need access to the online Apple Developer account of the company.\nAs a precaution, consider creating a separate Keychain for the company - marked as Default while creating the CSR. The private key will then be saved into the separate Keychain and can be passed to codesign as an absolute path with the --keychain flag. You can also store the certificate in this Keychain file.\n", "Q: Install macOS Catalina on non-supported MacBook Pros I have a MacBook Pro Early 2011 model and wanted to check if the latest macOS, Catalina can be installed on it.\nApple clearly says my Mac is not supported: https://support.apple.com/kb/sp803\nNevertheless, What ways are there there to get this Catalina running?\n\nA: No, not directly. Catalina won’t have the drivers needed to operate the older CPU and GPU so you would need to heavily modify that OS to have it run on old gear.\nSpecifically you lack a Metal compatible GPU so Mojave and Catalina are going to need modifications or emulation to run:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/metal/\n\n*How critical are macOS Mojave compatibility requirements?\nThat being said, you can get virtualization software that would let you run Catalina virtually - so the hardware you have will run - just not at full hardware speeds the latest OS.\nHere is a patcher that says it supports MacBook Pro as old as 2008:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://dosdude1.com/catalina/\nIf that doesn’t work for you, I would recommend VMWare Fusion since we’ve had good results with that at work testing since Catalina was in beta in June and now in release.

However, exiftool has another option \"-overwrite_original\" which can be added to the command line as follows:\nexiftool -overwrite_original -all= filename\n\nMy problem is that when I add the other option (overwrite) to the Automator shell script above, the script just doesn't work. Is there any syntax problem that I need to fix?\n\nA: From Terminal on macOS Catalina 10.15.1, exiftool -ver returns 11.78.\nI used the ExifTool-11.78.dmg from https://exiftool.org to install it.\nexiftool -all= filename does not make a backup, nor does exiftool -overwrite_original -all= filename; however, in both cases a filename_exiftool_tmp file is created during the process and I'm just left with filename when the process completes.\n\nAs an example, I take a screenshot of the Desktop and just use exiftool filename from Terminal and it prints out 90 lines of metadata.\nThen I use Automator on it, then back in Terminal using exiftool filename it prints out 20 lines of metadata.\nThe metadata of the 20 lines left cannot be removed by exiftool.\nI then run exiftool -all= filename from Terminal and it prints 0 image files updated and 1 image files unchanged.\nThis is exactly as it should be as some of the information is not being pulled from the file when queried by exiftool. \nSome of that info comes for the filesystem, attributes of the file and what info is shown that comes from within the file just cannot be removed by exiftool and I've actually read that somewhere within the documentation, whether it be at https://exiftool.org, or from where I just don't remember exactly where, sorry.\n", "Q: /private/var/folders not getting empty after reboot on macOS Catalina /private/var/folders is not getting empty after reboot. The folder is 200 GB! I tried safe mode too and it didn't change.\nHow can I thin out the folder(s)?\n\nA: It's likely that unneeded files will be cleared if you perform a Safe Boot. And then restart normally.\nHowever, a detailed account of cleaning out /var/folders can be found here,  \nhttp://www.magnusviri.com/Mac/what-is-var-folders.html\nwhich seems to indicate that not everything gets deleted on a Safe boot.\nBut unless you are desperate for storage space or experiencing some issues, I wouldn't recommend wholesale deletion of the entire contents.\n\nA: This will likely be closed as a duplicate, but I wanted to explain a couple things: When safe boot doesn’t clean these out, you have two options.\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete it in terminal - knowing you will restart and it will either boot or you’ll have to reinstall the OS (likely keeping the user data in tact)\n\n*Delete everything in an erase install, install the OS and migrate back the user data and apps and settings.\n\n\nI say prepare for #2 and then try #1 and see if you can learn something in the process. Deleting the files won’t break the running OS - since the files don’t delete fully until you restart. 200 GB is not normal, something is really wrong on your Mac so erase install is the only easy cure for that.\nThere’s no end to the abuse some developers will heap upon private folders, so if you need to resort to deleting things here regularly, it’s generally not Apple causing the pain.\n\n\n*\n\n*How will macOS behave when creating folders in /private/var/folders to mount a NFS share with?\n\n*Login Script for deleting contents of /private/var/folders\n", "Q: In countries where the Emergency Services can be called without a SIM card, what caller ID is shown to them when called from an iPhone? In countries where it's possible to make calls to emergency numbers (911/999, etc) from an iPhone that has no SIM inserted, how is it possible for the emergency services to track a device - would it be possible for them to call you back, even if the phone didn't show a caller ID due to one not being present?\n\nA: *\n\n*No - when you don’t have service, they can’t call you back.\n\n*Yes - you can call out and the only location data will be which cell tower data is provided to EMS / Emergency Services - not the GPS or location of the device doing the calling.\n\n\nIn more details:\nA SIM doesn't determine if you can connect to a cell tower, the phone's antenna determines it.  The SIM only has your phone number and carrier info so you can make emergency calls without it.  In the case you've mentioned, the call will go thru but the phone number and location will not be sent. 1 \nSo in this context, whether you have a SIM inserted or not is irrelevant.  Calls to emergency centers are treated the same with or without a SIM.\nEmergency calls are routed to a Public Safety Access Point (PSAP) for all carriers. Location data is sent with accuracy between 50 and 150 meters depending on if it's using cell tower triangulation or mobile-based location (GPS chip). 2\n\n", "Q: Macbook turns on but screen is dead or completely dark My Macbook Pro's screen just blinked and went dark.\nWhen I turn the computer on, the fan turn on and runs but the screen is dark.\nI tried all the option and tricks but nothing is works.

Can I boot from that, as long as I know the password? (I assume yes, but that I’ve got to install Samsung software on the target machine first.)\nIs the answer any different if I additionally enable FileVault on the external drive (APFS, GUID)?\n\nA: I don't think so, because the drive can't be unencrypted by the Mac before an OS is loaded. \nIf you want to encrypt your data, then using FileVault is the best way, and your Mac knows how to boot from a FileVault drive. \nHowever, it will boot to Recovery first, then ask you for the drive's password, then let you boot up.\n", "Q: How do I change the icon on an external drive? How do I change the icon on an external drive?

Has something changed that now makes this impossible?\nI've tried this now with several drives (various hardware) and am unable to change the icon on any of them. This used to work before (1) updating macOS and (2) reformatting the drives with APFS/GUID.

I had entered a computername in System Preferences, Sharing of (not really) mymacbk. I am using Frontier's FiOS service, whose router normally attaches \".home\" as the top level domain.  For various reasons discussed elsewhere on the net (for example, 189350), a hyphen, digit combination is getting added to that, so I see mymacbk-3 using the hostname command from bash.\nBut, just for fun, I executed \nping mymacbk\nping mymacbk.home\n\nIn both cases, I got back an IP address that, according to https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx reverse lookup tool, belongs to Akamai Tech: a23-202-231-168.deploy.static.akamaitechnologies.com  Looking up both of my actual names (mymacbk and mymacbk.home) on their DNS Lookup returned nothing.\nWhat is going on?  More importantly, is this possibly a symptom of having been compromised or virus/malware infected?\n\nA: Akamai runs a content distributions system used by major websites to provide fast web response on a global scale. It is used by Apple, Adobe, Microsoft and many others. \nPort 443 is used for HTTPS - the encrypted version of HTTP web-page access.\nIt is quite normal to see a lot of traffic directed through Akamai.\niCloud content is stored on Akamai servers. Assuming you are using iCloud, e.g. to store Safari bookmarks, it is normal that opening Safari triggers a connection to Akamai since the actual content (= Safari bookmarks) is physically stored on Akamai distribution servers and needs to be synced when opening the browser.\nMore insight on it:\n\nOn July 21, 1999, at Macworld Expo New York, Apple and Akamai\n  announced a strategic partnership to build Apple's new media network,\n  QuickTime TV (QTV), based on QuickTime Streaming Server.[32] Both\n  companies later announced that Apple had made a $12.5 million\n  investment in the company the previous month.[33] Apple continues to\n  use Akamai as their primary content delivery network[34] for a wide\n  range of applications including software downloads from Apple's\n  Website, QuickTime movie trailers, and the iTunes Store.[35]\n\nSo to your question \"is this possibly a symptom of having been compromised or virus/malware infected?\" - I don't think it is compromised or infected by virus. \n", "Q: What is the typical CPU utilization of idle iMac?

About 65% reports as \"System\" usage, 10% \"User\", and 25% \"Idle\".\nWhen I sort the processes by \"% CPU\" the kernal_task process is using the vast majority of the CPU (~250%).\n\nIs this typical, or is it something to be concerned about?\nEdit: added screenshot of Activity Monitor\nEdit 2: added screenshot of Activity Monitor and output from ps -al command after booting into Safe Mode (see below)\n\n\nA: A new Mac may use a considerable amount of resources building the database for Spotlight. This may take several hours. but on a new machine, without a lot on it, maybe as low as 30 minutes.  If you see a lot of resources being used I'd be concerned. My older iMac is currently just sitting here doing nothing but I have 7 web pages open. Activity monitor says the System is being used 6% of the time, user uses about 20% of the time and its ldle the remaining 74% of the time. Is this consistent with what you are seeing?  These values are given on the CPU page to the right of the CPU Load plot.\nEven when you are doing nothing, many processes are running in the background as you can tell by the amount of processes listed when you use activity monitor.\n\nA: Over time, you should be less than 1-2 % CPU with no processes needing to do work.\nThat process manages thermal and does other work. What does activity monitor look like, top 20 cpu users? https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207359 \nWhat’s the ambient temperature of the air around the mac?\nAlso, check the memory, network and disk tabs of activity monitor. If you have IO happening (cloud download, network, spotlight indexing) then even with all apps you normally think of as being quit, the system can run for hours or days if there is work to be done in the background. The good thing, is these background tasks yield if you have front apps to run, so I would walk away for 6 hours and let things run, then check again.\n\nIn your case, sort by all CPU time and quit everything you can like Firefox and watch for 15 minutes to see if kernel is quieted. The energy tab also is great for seeing the last day and hour what’s stoking the kernel task fires.\n", "Q: Why is Google Chrome trying to run netbiosd attempting to connect to 192.168.2.255? I usually don't use Google Chrome, because on my MacBook I'm addicted to Safari. \nToday when I launched Chrome, it ran netbiosd to connect to the local IP: 192.168.2.255. The local IP does not exist on the network and my local subnet is different than it is attempting to connect. I use a software called LuLu to detect outgoing calls. It is a packet filter similar to Little Snitch.\nSo where did it come from? What is netbiosd process?\n\nA: Netbios searches for local services like shared files and printers. What device is at 192.168.2.255 and did you enable chrome to try to print or open files?\nThis could be harmless or it could be code running that you don’t want to.\nThe process is a helper, Apple installed it, it’s running code that google likely was told by you to run.\n", "Q: AppleScript to choose item on web page Is it possible with AppleScript to choose a clickable element in a web page and click it and if so, can you give me an example?\n\nA: Yes, generally speaking, it's possible, however it can depend on the browser and the web page, there is no one method fits all, if you will.\nExamples:\nUsing this particular web page, looking at the question title line, to the far right is a blue button with says: Ask Question\nThe following line of AppleScript code will click that button in Safari if Allow JavaScript from Apple Events is checked on the Safari > Develop menu, which is hidden by default and can be shown by checking [√] Show Develop menu in menu bar in: Safari > Preferences > Advanced\ntell application \"Safari\" to tell document 1 to do JavaScript ¬\n    \"document.getElementsByClassName('ws-nowrap s-btn s-btn__primary')[0].click();\"\n\nWith Google Chrome the following example AppleScript code does the same thing, without having to modify any of the default settings:\ntell application \"Google Chrome\" to tell active tab in front window to execute javascript ¬\n    \"document.getElementsByClassName('ws-nowrap s-btn s-btn__primary')[0].click();\"\n\nNote that the JavaScript code portion, within the double-quotes, of each of these is the same while the basic AppleScript code is different for how each of the two applications work with the code.\nI should also point out that while this is AppleScript, albeit running some JavaScript, it's really the JavaScript that's doing the real work of clicking the target button. Basic vanilla AppleScript without executing some JavaScript cannot really click a button on the web page content unless it's done through the very kludgy use of UI Scripting.\nUI Scripting example:\nOn my system, in macOS High Sierra using Safari, version 11.1.1 (13605.2.8), the following example AppleScript code works to click the button that the other examples click.\ntell application \"System Events\" to click UI element ¬\n    \"Ask Question\" of group 5 of UI element 1 of scroll area 1 of group 1 of ¬\n    group 1 of tab group 1 of splitter group 1 of window 1 of application process \"Safari\"\n\nOn my system, in  Safari on macOS Catalina you'd have to change of group 5 of UI element 1 to of group 6 of UI element 1, and while that seems minor, nonetheless, it will depend on what you're trying to click and where and some objects on a web page may not be clickable at all with this method, yet will most likely be doable with JavaScript calls.\nThis wouldn't work in Google Chrome as it does not expose that particular UI element to click in this manner.\nOne of the issues with UI Scripting is the hierarchical structure to the object is subject to change between versions of the application or the versions of macOS and would need to be modified, where the use of AppleScript with JavaScript will typically continue to work without modification.\nBy the way, none of this is doable in Firefox.\n", "Q: Macbook Mail plays incoming mail sound even after turning off all notifications My Macbook Pro's Mail app continues to play the bass sound when a mail message is received, even though I've turned off all incoming mail sounds and notifications (see screenshots below). Is there anything else I can do to eliminate the incoming mail sound? I'm on a 2018 15\" Macbook Pro running 10.14.5 and Mail 12.4 (3445.104.11).\n\n\n\n\nA: I have had a similar issue. I use SpamSieve and I was unaware (or had forgotten) that there is a preference within SpamSieve to make a sound after a message is identified as 'good'. That is why the Basso sound (the default from SpamSieve) was being played after the 'New Message' sound - that, in experimenting, I had chosen in Mail.\nAre you using SpamSieve? Or perhaps another filtering service that rides on Mail?\n", "Q: Photos imported via webinterface cannot be edited on iOS devices When I import photos via webinterface to iCloud, I cannot edit those images on the iPhone or iPad (both running iOS13). I run into this error. This only happens when these images were uploaded via webinterface. Uploading the exact same files via iPhone (by attaching an SD card to the device) lead to me being able to edit these images also on other devices.\n\nA: I can confirm that this is not a blanket restriction and I have uploaded some images via iCloud (tested a PC / Windows 10 and macOS Catalina) web app.\nI would upload an image that isn’t already in your library as a duplicate as I believe the system is trying to match duplicates.\nOnce that’s done, you will likely need to wait out whatever processing is stuck on your specific library or engage Apple support since they would need to look server side to investigate why specific images are stuck.\nExpect to spend at least 30 minutes on the phone with Apple to collect information and/or try the “FAQ” steps and eventually if there isn’t a workaround or quick fix, you’ll be asked to make a support PIN to engineering or higher tier iCloud support can look at your specific sync data.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202650\n", "Q: Why can't I use zsh? So I upgraded to Catalina. Actually it's more like a fresh install, I only copied across the few files I wanted to keep.\nThe shell is now helpfully telling me:\nThe default interactive shell is now zsh.\nTo update your account to use zsh, please run `chsh -s /bin/zsh`.\nFor more details, please visit https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208050.\n\nThe information on that page helpfully shows GUI instructions which do not work. Specifically, it says \"Control-click your user name in the list of users on the left, then choose Advanced Options.\", but Control-click does nothing. So I reported that on the page.\nWhen I use the suggested command instead:\nhostname:~ username$ chsh -s /bin/zsh\nChanging shell for username.\nPassword for username: \nchsh: Operation was denied because the current credentials do not have the appropriate privileges.  Operation was denied because the current credentials do not have the appropriate privileges.\nchsh: no changes made\n\nThis is different to \"Can't use zsh shell in Catalina\" because I get an error message that they don't.\nIt's also different to \"chsh: Operation was denied because the current credentials do not have the appropriate privileges\" because it seems that in their case, they were using iTerm. I'm using the default Terminal.app.\nI have tried it with sudo just for laughs, but of course it does this, which makes perfect sense:\nhostname:~ username$ sudo chsh -s /bin/zsh\nPassword: \nChanging shell for root.\n\nSo what's the deal here? How am I supposed to do it?\nUpdate:\nWell this is interesting. Two password prompts, and then a different error message about the parameter being invalid.\nhostname:~ username$ sudo chsh -s /bin/zsh username\nPassword: \nChanging shell for username.\nPassword for username: \nchsh: One of the parameters provided was invalid.  One of the parameters provided was invalid.\nchsh: no changes made\n\nThis error is new to me, but apparently it's new to Google as well, so I'm officially a trailblazer!\nUpdate: Happy New Year!\nBack in the office again.\nThrough poking at commands we had determined that Centrify was in use. Centrify comes with an adupdate tool which is supposed to be used to change user information. With the help of IT, we tried it, though, and were still denied, but now it's more like an error.\n$ adupdate modify user -s /bin/zsh username\nAn error occurred while trying to modify a user while in Auto Zone.\nThe options (-d, -g, -i, -u, -s, -l, -m, -o, -X, -z) cannot be used during this operation.\nPlease consult the manual pages for more information.\n\nFirst impressions: What is Auto Zone and how do I get out of it?\n\nA: This is a somewhat speculative answer, on the assumption that your account is coming from an Active Directory domain your Mac is bound to. You can check this by running:\ndscl /Search -read /Users/\"$USER\" | grep AppleMetaNodeLocation\n\nIf it prints something like \"AppleMetaNodeLocation: /Active Directory/<somedomain>\", then your account is coming from AD, and this answer might work for you. I say \"might\" because I don't have a setup to test properly, and haven't messed with this stuff for several versions. If it doesn't print something about \"/Active Directory/\", this answer is not relevant.\nBefore proceeding further, I'd make a record of your current AD binding configuration. Run:\nsudo dsconfigad -show\n\n...and save its output somewhere, so you can refer to it if you need to put things back the way they were. If it doesn't print anything, then there's something weirder going on and I wouldn't recommend proceeding until you know what it is. It'll probably list something like \"Default user Shell = /bin/bash\"; if so, I'm pretty sure that's the root of your problem. To change this, run:\nsudo dsconfigad -shell /bin/zsh\n\n...and then probably reboot to make sure change takes effect. Oh, and check your Terminal preferences to make sure they're not overriding that (see here).\nExplanation (if you care): in unix (including macOS), each user account record has an attribute that controls their default shell. Changing the user's shell (with chsh or whatever) edits the user's record to change that attribute value. But Active Directory accounts don't have this attribute (unless the AD domain has Identity Management for Unix enabled -- but that's deprecated), so Apple's AD connector fakes up a value for this on its own. Because it's fake, it can't really be changed. But you can change what value the AD connector uses to fake it up, and that's what the dsconfigad command does.\n\nA: @bmike has already offered the easiest solution, but I wanted to go back to the GUI instructions not working.\nI found that Apple’s instructions here can be confusing. Control-Clicking will not do anything unless you first “unlock” the Users & Groups pane, as shown below in the blue box:\n\nOnce you have it unlocked, be sure you are clicking in the white-area on the left to access “Advanced Options…” as shown above with the blue arrow.\nThen you should be able to access the options, including shell, from the Advanced pane.\n\nA: Don’t use sudo directly without some additional switches - your invocation  would change root’s shell, not your user account.\nIf your short name is mike (you can check with whoami or who am i\nsudo -s\nchsh /bin/zsh mike\n\nOr if you know an admin short name and password you could skip the sudo initially\nchsh -u admin /bin/zsh\n\n@ me if you still have issues, there are a couple other ways to skin this cat, but I think once you specify the other user and su to root first, you should be set. It should have just worked out of the box, but hopefully we don’t have to go down that rabbit trail.\n\nA: After some more digging, finally a working solution!\n$ sudo su -\n# vim /etc/centrifydc/passwd.ovr\n\nAdded this line:\n+username:::::::/bin/zsh:::::::\n\nSaved, back to the shell...\n# chmod 644 /etc/centrifydc/passwd.ovr\n# adreload\n# adflush\n\nLogout from macOS and login again, and default shell is now zsh. \n", "Q: Syncing iCloud bookmarks with Opera GX? I work on a MacBook on the go, an iPhone when on the train and a Mac Mini Server for other stuff - it is actually stuffed in my parent's place. But... I also game on a Windows maschine. Now, since I am very tied to the Apple eco-system, I obviously use iCloud for managing most of my stuff. HandOff and singing into my MacBook with my Apple Watch are super convenient and great! Especially sharing tabs and bookmarks across Safari. But unfortunately, I don't seem to get this on Windows - at least not with Opera GX.\nSee, I don't really like Google Chrome and I use Firefox for other stuff...ahem. So Opera GX is my main browser; it has the great resource limiter which is super great, a lot of customization and somehow it even has Razer Chroma...? But what it does not have is support from iCloud. And that sucks.\nSo Opera GX allows you to install Google Chrome extensions - and since there is an iCloud extension, I installed it in the hope that I would be able to sync my bookmarks this way. But no, the \"iCloud for Windows\" does not recognize this attempt at all, unfortunately. But since Opera GX is essentially abstracting itself to run Chrome extensions and - to my knowledge, mind you - runs the Chromium web-engine, I should be able to trick iCloud into believing that my Opera GX was actually Chrome, right?\nI haven't succeeded in this, unfortunately. But since Chromium enforces a specific application infrastructure - all the way from command line arguments to internal page routing for settings and alike - I would think that once iCloud thought that my Opera GX was actually Google Chrome, it should sync my bookmarks just fine. Really, I only want my bookmarks - tabs do not matter that much to me, but it would be nice to have! But I don't think Apple would even allow this feature for non-Safari browsers anyway.\nSo how can I make iCloud for Windows think that Opera GX is Chrome, so it syncs my bookmarks? Thanks!\n\nA: If you create the NativeMessagingHosts registry entry it syncs fine without Chrome being detected.\nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Google\\Chrome\\NativeMessagingHosts\\com.apple.bookmarks]\n@=\"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Common Files\\\\Apple\\\\Internet Services\\\\AppleChromeDAV_host_manifest.json\"\n\nIn the UWP version of iCloud both Firefox and Chrome keys are already exposed by the AppX though you can't see them in the registry. So any browser should just work if you install the iCloud extension.\n", "Q: Documents show have 4GB but there is no file in it As you can see below this image, the Documents shows that it have 4.11GB but on the right side, it have nothing. What should I do now? Is it the file gone or the file went to somewhere else?\n\n\nA: The amount of data being shown is the total amount of storage the documents take up on your local disk. You are not seeing any files since it is only displaying large files, as seen by the tab bar below the \"Documents\" header where \"Large Files\" is selected. This means there are no large documents on your Mac, but there may be many small files that are taking up the 4.11 GB.\nTo see all the files that may be taking up storage on your Mac, click \"File Browser\" in the tab bar under the \"Documents\" header. This will show all the files in the root directory of your Mac, so you can clear them out. However, I would not recommend removing files from the \"Library\" folder unless you know what you are doing. This folder can contain system files that are essential to running certain apps. \n\n", "Q: Emptying trash slow on external HDD? macOS Catalina.\nEmptying trash on the internal SSD is normal, but very slow on external HDD (USB 3.0, 5400rpm).\n\nA: If you can measure the iOPS in activity monitor you will likely see the trash is constrained by the access speed of the hard drive over the USB bus. The Mac is capable of asking for thousands of changes and it waiting for the physical drive to answer back.\n\nThis is expected, as solid-state drives (SSDs), are significantly faster than traditional hard drives (HDDs). The reason for this is that HDDs rely on writing data to a physical disk that spins around at an extremely fast rate, similar to a DVD. SSDs are able to be much faster since they instead store data digitally in chips which are written through electrical currents. These electrical currents are much faster than a spinning disk, which will make computer operations faster on SSDs and slower on HDDs. Because of this, processes such as emptying the trash will be slower on HDDs.\nFast for a hard drive is 100-300 iops and fast for an SSD is 10x as many operations per second or more in the Pro models.\n\nA: Deleting file operates meta-data on a filesystem. It is of a random accessing pattern.\nSSD is thousands of times faster than HDD in random operation (tens of times in continuous operation).\nThe time to take is proportional to the number of files instead of the size. If it is a bundle (e.g. an app) with many files, it will take more time to delete.\n", "Q: As of iOS 13, what filetypes does Safari's Download Manager support? As of iOS 13, Safari now includes its own built-in Download Manager; the idea is that for supported filetypes, a user can simply tap on a link from within a web page and Safari will offer to either open the file (essentially mirroring its old behaviour in pre-iOS 13 builds), or download the file to a location of the user's choice which can be changed from within Settings/Safari.\nWhat isn't clear, however, is which filetypes the Download Manager supports. As an example, I've seen a reference to Safari being able to download MP3 files (https://www.cultofmac.com/629362/safari-download-manager-ios-13/), but in my own testing as of iOS 13.2.3, tapping on a link to an MP3 file simply opens it - as was the case in iOS 12.\nSo, my question - is there a definitive list of filetypes that Safari will offer to download when tapped?\n\nA: There’s no definitive list of file types which download automatically, since it’s not based on file type but rather the server providing the content. Safari supports every file type if the server is set up to provide a download.\nYou can force a download of a link to a resource rather than opening the link by holding down on the link and choosing Download Linked File.\n", "Q: Is it possible to connect an external camera to an Ipad Mini? My son has started doing stop-motion animationusing his iPad Mini 4, but using the built in camera can be quite restricting in terms of positioning and ease of use. We thought we'd buy an external webcam as these are often used by the stop-motion community but all my initial research (discussions.apple.com for intance) says an iPad can't use one.\nIs this really the case? I'm surprised given the normal Apple support for creative work.\n\nA: Connecting a webcam to your iPad isn't as straightforward as you might think. The iPad doesn't natively support USB cameras through the Camera Connection Kit, nor can it wirelessly connect to a webcam over Wi-Fi. \nNevertheless, there is a way to view your webcam's video feed on your iPad and even record what it's seeing -- but only with a small number of webcams that have their own iPhone and iPad apps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure your webcam has its own dedicated iPad app. The easiest way is to search the App Store for the name of your webcam manufacturer. For example, typing \"Linksys\" reveals several apps that support wireless video streaming.\n\n*Install the app of your choice. The My Webcam app for iPad is compatible with Logitech and Creative webcams; the Viewer for AXIS Camera Companion app for iPad is compatible with AXIS Cameras.\n\n*Open the app and follow any on-screen instructions to connect to your webcam. Usually this involves entering your username and password before logging in to see the webcam feed.\n\n*Choose an app such as Viewer for AXIS Camera Companion if you have multiple cameras and you want to see each feed as a thumbnail. Apps such as My Webcam enable you to remotely move cameras by swiping your finger across the screen.\nThings Needed\n\n\n*\n\n*Webcam with the dedicated app\n\n\nTip\n•   If you have an iPad 2 or later, you can use it as a dedicated webcam and stream the video feed from its camera across the Web.

I'm connecting to my macOS 10.15.1 device over SSH via PuTTY on a Windows computer to run a terminal program, imagesnap, that attempts to use the MacBook's camera.\nWhen I ran the program locally on command-line on a Terminal the first time I got a permission pop-up that allowed me to give Terminal access to Camera in the Security & Privacy settings.\nWhen I run the same program on command-line via an SSH connection the program aborts without successfully taking a photo, and I receive no permission request for Camera access.\nWhen I look at the section Camera in the Security & Privacy settings after trying to run the program using SSH there are no entries besides Terminal, which was already given access. Terminal is shown marked as having Camera access, so it and SSH programs are separate considerations for Security & Privacy.\nHow do I give my SSH connection programs Camera access?\n\nA: You can access the list of permissions in System Preferences => Security & Privacy. Select the Privacy tab and then choose Camera in the list on the left. You can then checkmark the apps on the right that you want to have access to the camera. \nIf you have previously denied access to a program, it should appear here where you can checkmark it to allow access again.\nAs you're running a command line program from within the Terminal, it is Terminal.app that appears in the list on the right - and this is the program that needs to be checkmarked.\nUPDATE: After your edit I realize that your problem is specifically when run via SSH, and not in general via the command line.

Say I have two tags, \"Green\", and \"Green 1\".\nHow do I replace all instances of the \"Green 1\" tag with the \"Green\" tag, across all files on my device?\n\nA: I've had two 'Green' tags, though with slightly different names for quite some time, so I thought I'd see if I could find a workaround.\nBest I can come up with is in effect a find, add, remove.\nFortunately it turns out I'd only a few 'other Green' so it was quite quick, but you can almost see the Finder 'thinking' as it ticks through them all.\nFrom Finder Prefs>Tags, make sure both are ticked & then drop both your 'Greens' into the favourites at the bottom, circled.  You can only have 5 at once, so others will be removed. You can re-add afterwards. Leave this window open, you'll be coming back to it.\n\nOpen a Finder window & select your 'to be deleted' tag in the sidebar, to list all the files tagged with it. Mine was called 'In Queue'\n\n Cmd ⌘   A  to Select All.\nRight click & assign the other green tag to the files, so they now have both tags.\nGive the Finder time to finish - you can see it adding the second green dot…\nThen - right click again & remove your unwanted tag.\nEverything is now tagged with the single, wanted, Green tag.\nGo back to Finder prefs & you can delete the extra tag altogether.\n\nA: Click the green1 tag in sidebar and select all the files and right click on them. Go to Tags.. and add/remove. \nIf green1 is not in sidebar, go to Finder Preferences -> Tags, and Advanced to get it visible. \n\n\n", "Q: How to customise rEFInd theme on High Sierra?

If a user connects to one of the five\n  tinyservers at port 80 with his webbrowser, the request is redirected\n  to the corresponding webserver running on the powerful machine.

Currently .kexts are still supported in macOS Catalina, however after the beta release they issued an update which stopped our driver from loading. This update required our driver (FTDIUSBSerialDriver.kext) to be re-signed and notarized, we completed this process with an updated Apple Developer ID (as they lapse every two years). Unfortunately when Apple issued our new Developer ID to re-sign and notarize the driver package they did so without the .kext support option enabled (as .kexts are being deprecated it is no longer automatically included). This is why there is a code signature issue with our driver, currently we are waiting on Apple issuing us with the correct Developer ID to be able to sign .kexts for macOS Catalina.\nAs such our current VCP driver available on the website has a signature issue and wont load. However if the device you are using implements a default FTDI VID/PID combination it should be picked up by the inbuilt AppleUSBFTDI.dext driver and present accordingly in the ‘/dev’ folder on your system in the following form:\n/dev/cu.usbserial-xxxxxxxx\n/dev/tty.usbserial-xxxxxxxx\nMy FTDI module has default PID VID but still doesn't work.

This may be the same as the Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5621.\n\n*Make sure the Windows Support Software have beed copied to the Windows 10 installer flash drive before installing Windows 10.\n\n*You want to have first installed the latest version of High Sierra. This will insure you have the latest firmware updates. (Firmware updates are included in the latest versions of macOS.)\n\n*You would be better off installing Windows 10 to BIOS boot. Most likely the Windows Support Software for you model Mac was designed for BIOS booting and may not work properly if you install Windows to EFI boot.\n\n*The Windows Support Software for your Mac may contain a BootCamp.msi file that is to old to be used with the latest versions of Windows 10. See the question WDF VIOLATION Blue Screen after Upgrading Mac to Windows 10 May 2019 Update (1903) Edition.\n\n\nIf you do not want or need macOS installed on your Mac, then you can just have Windows 10 installed.

However I think I can provide more advice on:\n\nIf so, how do people with financial/banking apps manage this?\n\nProvide them an account that either fakes the data exchange in the app, so they can see the UI but the data is dummy from some XML files in the app. Or make it so if that account logs in it connects to test services rather than live services.

Please drop a valid one.\"\n        echo \"'$FILE'\"\n    fi\ndone\n\n\n# check if there are EAs\necho \"\"\nLINES=$(xattr -l \"$FILE\"|wc -l)\n\nif [ \"$LINES\" -eq \"0\" ]; then\n    echo \"Can't fix this file\"\n    echo \"There are no extended attributes associated.\"\n    exit 1  \nfi\n\n# now remove the EAs\necho \"\"\nxattr -c \"$FILE\" &>/dev/null\necho \"You can now open this file in QT7.\"\n\n# create space\necho \"\"\n\nThanks to anyone that can assist me in this matter.\nCheers\n\nA: The only line that does work in that script is\nxattr -c \"$FILE\"\n\nTo run a command on all files in a folder, use find:\nfind /path/to/folder -type f -exec xattr -c \"{}\" \\;\n\nxattr also provides the -r flag to run recursively, so you can avoid find given that this functionality is part of xattr:\nxattr -rc /path/to/folder\n\n", "Q: Unable to edit config.inc.php in the phpmyadmin configuration I'm trying to edit a file on my mac.

When looking at answers to several questions on Ask Different concerning installing Windows via Boot Camp, I've seen several references to installing Windows to a Mac via \"BIOS Boot\". Would somebody be able to explain how this can be achieved?\n\nA: Assuming you are using the Boot Camp Assistant to install a version of Windows officially supported on your Mac, then Windows will be installed to BIOS or UEFI boot automatically without user interaction.\nDuring the Boot Camp installation process, Windows determines the boot method based on how the Boot Camp Assistant partitions the installation drive. If Boot Camp Assistant choose to keep a GUID partition table (GPT) with a fully protected Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table, then Windows will install for a UEFI boot. The alternative is to change to a GPT and a partially protected MBR partition with entries for the macOS (OS X) and Windows partitions. This is referred to as hybrid partitioning. In this case, Windows will install to BIOS boot. The older Macs only support hybrid partitioning for Windows installations, because there is a BIOS, but not a new enough EFI version in the firmware. Newer Macs support both methods of partitioning for Windows installations, because there is both a BIOS and new enough EFI version in the firmware. However, the newest Macs only support a GPT with a full protected MBR for Windows installations, because there is no BIOS support and enough EFI support in the firmware.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use 2 iPads simultaneously with Sidecar? I'd like to use 2 iPads simultaneously as extra monitors for my Mac. When I try to connect a second iPad through Sidecar, it disconnects the first iPad. \nIs there a way to override this and use two iPads with Sidecar?\n\nA: \nIs it possible to use 2 iPads simultaneously with Sidecar?\n\nThe current implementation of Sidecar in macOS Catalina and iPadOS 13 doesn't allow using two iPads simultaneously as Sidecar target. While this is not explicitly mentioned by Apple, all the support documents hint towards the conclusion that only a single iPad can be used as a Sidecar target.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use your iPad as a second display for your Mac with Sidecar\n\n*Sidecar - Sidecar lets you expand your Mac   workspace—and your creativity—with   iPad and Apple Pencil\nThe primary intent of using Sidecar is not to let you use your iPad as an external display, rather to aid to your productivity.\n", "Q: How can I make iTerm2 hotkey window fill out the whole screen? I am using MacOS Catalina, and I use iTerm as my terminal. My problem is, that every time iTerm has been closed, and opened again, it only opens in half screen. I know I can drag it down to full screen with my cursor, but it's super annoying if I have to do that every time I open it.\nIs there a way to make it full screen by default?\n\nA: Yes, go to preferences under the iTerm menu item. When the panel opens, select the Profiles option at the top of the panel. Once that opens, click on the Hotkey Window option, and then click the window tab near the top right. In that window you can define the window size or on the right select instead of Normal, Full Screen. See the image below.\n\n\nA: You can configure the profile for the hotkey window to always fill the whole screen with the drop-down menu iTerm2 > Preferences > Profiles > NAME OF HOTKEY PROFILE > Window > Style.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to toggle between a half-screen and full-screen hotkey window, the menu item Window > Zoom achieves something to this effect, as long as the Style is set to something like Full-Width Top of Screen.\n\nWhen you open the hotkey window, the menu bar does not automatically switch to iTerm2, but you can still use the shortcut (which is ⇧⌘0 on my system; it might be different on yours).\n", "Q: CSS Zoom does not work iPad OS (v13- latest) Safari I have discovered a bug in Safari with iPad OS. The problem is that when I zoom using the css zoom attribute, safari is taking an element's font-size and is either enlarging or shrinking based on the zoom level.\nExample: If I have an element with font-size: 20px at 100% and zoom to 50%, safari is making the font-size now 40px keeping the element at 100% therefore breaking my layout. This only occurs only on devices running iPad OS. (This happens at all zoom levels 50%, 60%, 70%, etc.)\nDoes anyone have any extra information on iPad OS that may help me solve this problem? I have already reported to Apple, but it has been a while since I have had any status update.\nLINK TO TEST: http://alleetest.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/\n\nA: I see your issue. Unfortunately, I have noticed that Apple has broken several aspects of webpage rendering on iPadOS, leaving several minor visual quirks that didn't exist in Safari 12 for iPad.\nAlthough it is very annoying that they broke Safari, unfortunately, we have to live with it in the meantime. What I would do is create a script that will increase and decrease the size of the elements, text, borders, etc. when you change the \"zoom\" size. Doing this would also give support for the Firefox browser, as it doesn't have support for the CSS zoom.\nThis suggestion might not be ideal, depending on what you are trying to do, but hopefully, this helps somewhat.\nAlso, it should be noted that the iPadOS Safari browser's built-in zoom feature using a keyboard will work correctly, just not the CSS zoom.\n\nA: Solution:\nfunction setTransformScale(scaleFactor) {\n    if(!scaleFactor) scaleFactor = 1;\n\n    let height = $(window).height()*(1/scaleFactor);\n    let width = $(window).width()*(1/scaleFactor);\n\n    $(\".body-container\").css({\n        width: width+\"px\",\n        height: height+\"px\",\n        transform: `scale(${scaleFactor})`\n    });\n};\n\nI have completely removed the CSS Zoom property from my site and switched to transform: scale() property. To counter the spacing I added \"transform-origin: top left\" to my css file and in javascript I run my created function when sizing pages.\n$(\".body-container\") is my div element right below the body tag causing the zoom effect on my entire page.\n", "Q: Shell variables in standalone app of bash script I have a bash script that mounts a fuse filesystem created with the backup tool borg. Mounting the filesystem requires a passphrase. The mount command of borg allows to read the passphrase from an export in my shell script. So the first two lines of my script are something like \n#!/bin/bash\nexport BORG_PASSPHRASE='mypassphrase'\n\nThen I mount the filesystem with the mount command\nborg mount user@server:/mntpoint::backup_repository /localmntpoint\n\nThe script runs perfectly fine. However, I would like to create a standalone app which runs this script. So I called the script Borg and created a directory Borg.app which contains Contents and MacOS as subdirectories and in MacOS I put the Borg shell script. This appears to be the usual way of turning a shell script into a clickable application. I am aware that one can click the shell script itself and a terminal will fire up and execute the script. I prefer the other option. \nUnfortunately nothing happens upon clicking my Borg.app. I suspect the issue is the export command at the beginning which is somehow missed by the mount command in this setup. \nAny help in resolving this is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Make sure that\n\n\n*\n\n*the shell script within Borg.app is executable (chmod +x ...)\n\n*all the files within Borg.app are accessible by the current user\n\n*any command called from the script is called with the full path specified (especially for things stored in /usr/local/bin and similar non-default places)\n\n", "Q: Xcode simulator constantly download something Xcode 11.2.1 simulator 13.2.2 constantly download something daily about 450 MB through nsurlsessiond.

Here's a photo of the screen.\nI have no idea why this screen was shown. I remember my password quite vividly, and all I did was turn on the laptop.\nHowever, this is not the worst part. The worst part is that the computer doesn't react to either the keyboard or the mousepad. I'd choose \"the keyboard doesn't work\", except the keyboard doesn't work and therefore I can't choose this option...\nComputer: MacBook Pro (mid 2012)\nOS: macOS Catalina, v. 10.15 (possibly 10.15.1, I don't remember if I upgraded)\nEDIT: I'd like to clarify the statement \"my mousepad doesn't work\".

I'm searching for a way to easily access the website on my localhost (Macbook) with my iPhone.\nPossible solutions which don't work:\nUsing Ngrok - This comes close to what I want. I open the Ngrok URL on my Macbook and then open it on iPhone using the special feature 'Open safari tabs from Macbook'.\nHowever, Ngrok is way to slow and buggy... If it weren't so slow this would be perfect...\nAccessing localhost through network IP - I know it's possible to access your host machine with your iPhone by browsing to it's IP when the devices are on the same WiFi... But I don't always have the wifi-password of my clients, and it's a hustle to ask (they often don't know/have to search too long)... So not a reliable solution.\nOther solutions? - What other options do I have? Isn't it possible to access my Macbook with my iPhone when I use my iPhone as personal hotspot (4G)? Or isn't something like this possible with Airdrop?\nTL;DR:\nI'm searching for the most easy and reliable way to open up my localhost (Macbook) with my iPhone. Without using Wifi. LTE Personal hotspot is allowed. Ngrok to slow.\n\nA: Other than Ngrok, ssh.localhost.run is excellent for that purpose. You need to have the Openssh Client. Use :- \nssh -R 80:localhost:port ssh.localhost.run\n\nReplace \"port\" with the port your server is running on. You will receive a link,  just like Ngrok, you can use that link. Other than localhost.run there is also serveo.net, use it the same way as localhost.run, but it is currently down, so localhost.run.\n", "Q: How to Hide and show an app via a single shortcut? I'd like to show & give focus to and hide an app using a single shortcut. The app (or apps) i like to use this way do not natively support this on their own. Is this possible on macOS (10.15 in my case)? Maybe using some 3rd party app or Automations?\nI'm using this with iTerm2, it's called \"Show/hide all windows with a system-wide hotkey\", also, Launchbar has this feature but i'd like the same behaviour in PCalc and/or Calcbot.\n\nA: This answer is a step by step explanation of what ankii proposed in a comment.\nFirst, open Script Editor and write an Apple Script to toggle the visibility of your application. The following code should work, just change the value of appName (currently set to Finder) to be the app you want.\nset appName to \"Finder\"\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    if visible of application process appName is true then\n        set visible of application process appName to false\n    else\n        set visible of application process appName to true\n    end if\nend tell\n\nSave this Apple Script as an application (File -> Save -> File Format -> Application). I named it Toggle Visibility, but you can call it anything.\nNext, open Automator and create a new Quick Action (previously a called a service). Change the values in the drop down menu so that \"Workflow receives no input in any application\" is displayed at the top. \nDrag Launch Application from the list of options on the left (you can use the search bar to find it) into your workflow. Set the selected application to other, and find the Apple Script you saved as an application previously.\nGo to File -> Save to save your Quick Action, and give it a name.\nFinally, open System Preferences and go to Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Services, and scroll down to the General Tab. There, you should see the name of your Quick Action you just saved. Click the check box to enable it, and add a keyboard shortcut to activate it. Make sure the shortcut you added doesn't conflict with other shortcuts on your computer.\n", "Q: Signed pkg using productbuild --distribute but codesign says \"code object is not signed at all\" I am signing my package during distribution using\nSIGN_IDENTITY_INSTALLER=\"Developer ID Installer: Pxxxxxxx, LLC (AXXXXXXXXX)\"\n\nproductbuild --distribution final-distribution.xml --package-path /tmp/installer-temp/package.pkg --resources resources --sign \"$SIGN_IDENTITY_INSTALLER\" \"Package.pkg\"\n\nAnd this outputs what it's supposed to\nproductbuild: Signing product with identity \"Developer ID Installer: Pxxxxxxx, LLC (AXXXXXXXXX)\" from keychain /Users/michael/Library/Keychains/login.keychain\nproductbuild: Adding certificate \"Developer ID Certification Authority\"\nproductbuild: Adding certificate \"Apple Root CA\"\nproductbuild: Wrote product to Product.pkg\n\nBut when I go to verify the signature nothing is there.\ncodesign -dv --verbose=4 Product.pkg \nProduct.pkg: code object is not signed at all <----WHAT?\n\nAm I supposed to be signing with the Developer ID Application and not the Developer ID Installer?\nAll certificates exist in keychain and work just fine.\nEdit 1\nSee the certificates in the Apple Developer Portal.\n\n\nA: Use spctl, not codesign\nThe codesign tool does not work with package files, .pkg.\nUse the spctl tool instead:\n/usr/sbin/spctl --assess --ignore-cache --verbose --type install <pkg-path>\n\nAlternatively, Installer.app\nYou can also check the package certificate using Installer.app:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the package in macOS's Installer.app;\n\n*Click the padlock in the top-right of the installer window.\n\n\n\n\nA: To sign macOS packages, you will require access to an Apple Developer account.

The name of the certificate should be of the format: Developer ID Installer: Apple account name (serial number).\n\n*Open terminal. The command to sign the package should look something like this:\nproductsign -sign “Developer ID Installer: Your Apple Account Name (**********)” ~/Desktop/example.pkg ~/Desktop/signed-example.pkg\n\nHere, the quoted text following the –sign tag refers to the name of your certificate. The two arguments, following the name of the certificate, refer to the current location of the unsigned package (/Desktop/example.pkg) and the location of the signed package (/Desktop/signed-example.pkg), respectively.\nThe signed certificate gets stored in the destination path specified in the command.\nHope this clarify your open queries and may guide you to have a proper solution. \n", "Q: Keep standalone bash script app open after run of script I have a bash script that I have turned into a standalone macOS app (i.e. I created a folder Script.app which contains subfolders Contents and MacOS and in the folder MacOS resides my bash script).

The new data protections in Catalina make some folders inaccessible by default (for example the 'Documents' folder).  When an application tries to access one of these folders the OS presents the user with a dialog box to ensure they intended the access.\nSee the Data Protections section here.\nThis seems to have had the effect of breaking home folder network shares.  If you enable file sharing in macOS, any registered user is able to access their home folder using their own credentials.  This works in Catalina, but the special private folders (Documents, Downloads, Desktop) can't be interacted with.  Attempts to interact with them result in an 'access denied' error and no dialog is presented to the user on the server machine that would allow access.  On the client machine, in both Finder and Terminal these folders simply appear empty and you get a permissions error if you attempt to create a file.\nI can see no configuration in either the Security and Privacy settings for these files or in the File Sharing settings that would solve this problem.\nHow do I allow access to these folders as part of the user's home share over a network in Catalina such that it works as it did in previous versions of macOS?  \n\nA: This is probably a bug. You can solve it by deactivating the file sharing option in the Sharing section of the Preferences window and then reactivating it.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut flashes my display If I press the keyboard shorcut  Cmd-Opt-Shft-Ctrl-W from any app it seems to flash my entire display.   I believe this started with Catalaina but I could be wrong.\nI thought at first it was Keyboard Maestro doing it but the shortcut flashes my display even when Keyboard Maestro is not loaded.\nAny ideas what  Cmd-Opt-Shft-Ctrl-W does and why it flashes the screen?\n\nA: Quoting from this question: \nWifiDiagnostics files filling up drive even with logging disabled \n\n... that particular keyboard shortcut, command+option+control+shift+w, triggers something in OS X (possibly Catalina only; I don't have an older OS to test against) that starts the wifi logging.\n\nSo please check your /private/var/tmp.\n\nA: The combination Cmd-Opt-Shft-Ctrl-W is some kind of system reserved combination, e.g. during updates/installs of the OS  Cmd-Opt-Shft-Ctrl-W opens up a GUI for the update process, including access to the update log. So it may act as a \"breaker\" for the system itself. As @ankii suggests, it triggers network diagnostics when booted, so the screen flash is there as to notify that the indeed diagnostics were triggered.\n", "Q: How to allow Terminal to Find Commands without Export PATH?

How can I use karabiner to make two key presses map to two other key presses?\n\nA: Ok I solved my two specific problems, though I am still not sure how I would replicate multiple key presses if more than one of them were not modifier keys.\nPut the following two json files in user/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications\n{\n  \"title\": \"Shift + Enter\",\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Shift + Enter to Option Enter (newline in messenger)\",\n      \"manipulators\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"basic\",\n          \"from\": {\n            \"key_code\": \"return_or_enter\",\n            \"modifiers\": {\n              \"mandatory\": [\n                \"shift\"\n              ],\n              \"optional\": [\n                \"caps_lock\",\n                \"option\"\n              ]\n            }\n          },\n          \"to\": [\n            {\n              \"key_code\": \"return_or_enter\",\n              \"modifiers\": [\n                \"option\"\n            ]\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nThis one (shift enter) is really frustrating me but not because of karabiner. In messenger i need to option+enter to get a new line character, but in the browser option-enter refuses to do anything. I wish I could get a key combination that does a consistent \"safe\" new line character, rather than making me fear I am going to accidentally press enter to send or complete or publish or something like that.\n{\n  \"title\": \"cmd + angle brackets for workspaces\",\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Use CMD + comma  (left angle bracket key) to switch to  left workspace\",\n      \"manipulators\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"basic\",\n          \"from\": {\n            \"key_code\": \"comma\",\n            \"modifiers\": {\n              \"mandatory\": [\n                \"command\"\n              ],\n              \"optional\": [\n                \"caps_lock\",\n                \"option\",\n                \"control\"\n              ]\n            }\n          },\n          \"to\": [\n            {\n              \"key_code\": \"left_arrow\",\n              \"modifiers\": [\n                \"control\"\n            ]\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Use CMD + .

Sync was working fine until a few days ago, about a week after installing Catalina.\nI accidentally opened my Photos library from a networked Mac and closed it. It didn't appear to cause any problems, but the next time I opened Photos on the local Mac, it gave me a \"repairing library\" progress bar. That eventually completed and all my photos showed up. So far so good. But since then (five days ago), it has not downloaded any new photos from iCloud.\nIn \"All Photos\" view, at the bottom where it would normally say \"Downloading x new items\", instead it says \"Restoring from iCloud...\":\n\nThe numbers are wrong. When I first open Photos for just a second it shows slightly lower numbers, which are the numbers of photos and videos actually in the library. Then the \"restoring\" message comes up and it switches to a higher number, which is still lower than the number shown on my phone and other iCloud synced libraries. The photos missing from this library show up fine on those devices.\nThe iMac has been on and attached to a fast and reliable internet connection the whole time. I assumed it would resolve on its own, but it has now been 9 days and it's getting inconvenient to not have access to new photos.\nWhen I posted this I was running macOS 10.15.1. I have since upgraded to 10.15.2, and the problem persists.\nI've tried restarting and I've tried turning \"Download originals to my Mac\" off and back on, to no avail.\nLast night (day 8) I opened Photos while holding command-option to rebuild the library. It took about 9 hours, after which it went right back to the same \"Restoring from iCloud...\" message.\nHas anybody else run into this problem? Anything I can do to get it back to normal syncing?\n\nA: My library is back to normal, but the question is still somewhat unanswered. After 12 days of \"Restoring from iCloud...\" I gave up hope and turned off iCloud Photos (both in the Preferences pane of Photos and in the system preferences under \"Apps on this Mac using iCloud\". One or the other told me that one unspecified item would be deleted, which in desperation I agreed to. Restarted and turned them both back on.\nPhotos thought for a while and then said \"Uploading 11X,XXX photos\". I left it open while it counted down agonizingly slowly for about a week. The first 50k took much longer than the rest, so maybe it does the bigger files (or more recent photos) first. When it finally got to zero, it downloaded the new photos that were missing, and everything has been working fine since.\nIf I get the \"Restoring from iCloud...\" message again, I'll probably skip right to turning iCloud off and back on, since it sounds like there's no way to avoid re-uploading every photo anyway. Of course if anyone has a better solution I would appreciate a real answer.\nUpdate and warning:\nWhen writing this answer I went back and turned off iCloud Photos in both places again, hoping to figure out which one triggered the re-upload. I was expecting it to give me a warning. THERE IS NO WARNING. Now my Photos app is back to \"Uploading 11X,XXX\" photos.\n\nA: I've had the same issue. After some troubleshooting, I realised my Mac was running low on disk space. After cleaning up and making more free space, Photos app immediately started syncing iCloud photos and showing them in the app.\n\nA: Here is a way to figure out what's going on under the hood : use the Console app or the command line Log tool :\nlog stream --predicate 'process == \"cloudd\" or process == \"cloudphotod\"'\n\n\nA: Since I ran into the same issue, I had to research this as well. From what I found, this seems to be normal. After a library repair, each photo is being verified against the iCloud library copy.\nThis Apple support document 1 states:\n\nIf you repair a library that's automatically updated with iCloud Photos, the entire contents of the library re-updates with iCloud after the repair ...\n\nJust like a normal iCloud library upload, this can take a very long time. For my 20.000 photos, it's currently at 72 hours without an indication of being finished any time soon it took about 80 hours. Then, the Photos app showed Updating (only the word Updating without any additional information) for a few hours before now switching to Uploading 19,800 items.\nIt's re-uploading every single photo in my library. Due to my low upload bandwidth, this is a very slow process and it uploaded about 1,000 photos in the previous 4 days.\nSo for me the messages that showed up in the status bar were, in order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restoring from iCloud (for about 4 days)\n\n*Updating (for a few hours)\n\n*Uploading x items (very slow, will possibly take many weeks to finish)\n\n\nUPDATE Jan/10: I took the laptop to work because we have a very fast upstream connection there. Over the weekend, it uploaded all photos, downloaded the new ones and is now back to its old Updated Just Now status.\n", "Q: How do you disable or speed up the character/emoji keyboard animation? Context: By default on macOS, you can press cmd + control + space to bring up the character keyboard (more commonly known as the emoji keyboard). Before the keyboard pops up, there is a short delay and a fade in animation. For documents where you enter such characters frequently, the delay is substantial and interferes with the flow of typing.\nThe Question: How can you speed up the time it takes to show the emoji keyboard? Is there a terminal command to disable the animation, or otherwise reduce the time it takes to ultimately enter the desired character?\n\nA: Found the answer -- though this will also affect other animations:\ndefaults write -g NSAutomaticWindowAnimationsEnabled -bool false\n\n", "Q: On OS Catalina Delete the account you are currently logged into I have a Macbook Air, and I am logged into an administrator account which I want to delete. Is there a way to delete the account I am currently logged into while using that account?\n\nA: The closest you can get to delete your admin with the name admin_username (even with no other user left afterwards) without logging in as a different user in the GUI is to enable root and remove your admin with the superuser:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal.app\n\n*Enable root with dsenableroot. You have to enter your admin_username password and choose a new password for root and verify it.\n\n*Change to root: su - and enter root's password.\n\n*Enter:\nrm -dR /Users/admin_username; dseditgroup -o delete -n . -u admin_username admin; dscl . delete /Users/admin_username; reboot\n\nThe password of admin_username is probably required. I ran several tests with various permutations of the command above and either dseditgroup or dscl asked for it.\nWarning: This will remove all admin_username files & folders! Most files can be recovered with a data recovery tool.\nAfterwards the root user will be enabled and depending on your settings it will be visible as \"Other users...\" on the login screen.\n\nThe command was tested in a virtual machine. The admin user had a relatively small user folder (< 5 GB). On a real machine your milleage may vary.\n\nReading and interpreting all related questions and comments I suspect that the MacBook Air is a shared computer with two admin accounts belonging to different parties (PvsP/PvsB) being at loggerheads in the meantime.\nI would hand over the computer to a wise, reliable and neutral person, explain the dilemma and expect a Solomonic solution.\n", "Q: Back up MacBook without display How can I back up my MacBook when it's display is broken and I don't know if the computer is currently on or off or whether it is booting up correctly?\nI've been keeping backups on an external HDD with Time Machine and asked a recent question about a problem I had with that - \"not enough space on disk\" - so please can answers to this question also explain how to back up if that is an issue?\n\nA: The simplest method (assuming you have or can borrow/rent one) is plug in an external monitor. That may not be possible or practical but it has to be said...\nThe problem here is knowing if the Mac is on or off. You can check in a darkened room to see if you see ANY light change (keyboard, display) when hitting the power button. Also in a quiet room listen for fans or drives spinning up (assuming you have spinning drives and not an SSD) And often turning on a Mac will make some noise when it is powered on.\nIf you can get to the battery and take it our or disconnect it readily that would confirm it is indeed off.\nYou can usually shut down any computer (Mac or PC) by holding down the power button for 15 seconds or so. Once you do that hitting the power button will power it up.\nForgoing all of that you could just plug your Time Machine drive into the Mac and watch for the drive activity light. More than a 30 seconds or so of drive activity might be a good indicator that macOS was accessing the drive. Let it run overnight and then plug it onto another computer and check the date stamps on the sparsebundle and/or its contents to see if it was modified overnight.\nThere are likely other ways that I haven't thought of but those should get you started, unless you've already tried all of that...\n", "Q: Urgent - iPhone disabled, rescue data I have the iPhone 6s of my grandma here.  She asked me if I could recover the photos she has made with her iPhone after it disabled itself for some reason. \nI have already updated it multiple times over the recovery mode with iTunes. If anybody has any idea on how I could solve this quickly, I would be forever thankful. I believe my mother would love to have some of these pictures as well.\n\nA: If you've restored the phone once, the data is no longer on the device.\nYou (your grandma) would have either needed a backup via iTunes on their computer, or backups being made via iCloud.\nIf you plugged the phone into her computer and there weren't restores available, and the iPhone setup phase doesn't say it can restore from iCloud, there's no backups to restore.\nHowever, phone backups and service data are two different things. There is a change that if you set up the phone and log her back into her Apple ID, her \"live account data\" (service data) would come back if they were being stored in iCloud via iCloud Photos.\nHave you gone all the way through the restore process and Apple ID login on her phone?\n\nA: It is not possible to recover any contents off an iPhone that has been disabled. The contents is resting in an encrypted state on the iPhone and is only decrypted by a key which is constructed by several parts, one of which is the lock code used when unlocking an iPhone.\nI will assume there was a lock code in use since for an iPhone to become permanently disabled I think the wrong lock code needs to be entered 10 times.\nWhen you get the \"iPhone is disabled, connect to iTunes\" message on your iPhone, the decryption key has been permanently discarded and the same unique key can not be reconstructed by anybody, as the key is constructed the first time you set up the iPhone by, amongst other things, the random input from the microphone at the time.\n", "Q: What size is this internal screw for the Macbook Air (A1466)?

I have two active user accounts which may be logged on simultaneously. If two users are logged on, I observe a split-second freeze of the screen exactly every 1 minute. This is very annoying when watching videos, but actually observable during any actions, e.g. window dragging or typing text. The issue is visible when logged in as any of those two users. \nThis only happens when two users are logged on. If only one user is logged on, everything works fine.\nBy analyzing the console logs, I came to a conclusion this has something to do with the integrated/discrete GPU.

I'd qualify that advice with the further suggestion to check the device's light to see it's not doing anything before ripping it out.\nFigured there would be countless others thinking \"Surely there must be a way to properly remove USB devices from my iPad...\". Short answer: nope.\n", "Q: Change arrangement of iPad used as Sidecar Display I have an iPad Pro (2018 3rd Gen) that I'm using as 2nd display with my Macbook Pro (2018).  I can enable it and it works well, but it's on the wrong side of my Macbook and there's no options in Sidecar to change the display arrangement.\nHow do I change the monitor arrangement of my iPad relative to my Macbook?\n\nA: Sidecar has no settings to change monitor arrangement. You only enable the iPad as an additional display in the Mac's System Preferences.  You still have to go to \"Displays\" in your Mac's System Prefs to change the arrangement of the iPad as a display relative to your Mac.\nAfter (2) days of dragging things in the opposite direction to the iPad display it finally occurred to me to check Displays...

In my case it failed, and I could see the overallocation warnings there.\nSo here's my solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*restart mac os and press cmd+r to enter recovery mode\n\n*open terminal\n\n*run cmd diskutil list - to check your disk identifier, mine is disk0s2\n\n*fsck_apfs -ln /dev/disk0s2 - optional: if you just want to check your volume to make sure you have issues. This also resulted in overallocation warnings.\n\n*given the overallocation warnings, we can use fsck_apfs to fix them, but if you just run the command, it will throw the error that your container is mounted with write access.\n\n*You'll need to unmount you disk with: diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk0s2\n\n*Now that your disk is unmounted: fsck_apfs -oy /dev/disk0s2 (-o to repair overallocations, -y to answer yes to questions, i.e always attempt to repair any damage that is found)\n\n*Once finished mount your disk again: diskutil mountDisk /dev/disk0s2\n\n*You can check again if overallocation errors are gone with command of 6\n\n*Restart your machine, you should be able to go through bootcamp assistance and it should be able to partition your hdd.\n\n\nIf you get permissions error, run commands with sudo.\n\nA: If you happen to have a Fusion drive, this worked for me https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT207584\nStrange this is happening (to myself as well) on Catalina when Mojave's most recent update specifies it fixes this\n", "Q: What are the implications of leaving the XHC20 interface \"up\"? In order to sniff USB traffic on macOS, the XHC20 interface must be \"brought up\" by executing the following command:\nsudo ifconfig XHC20 up\n\nMany online tutorials also suggest to disable the interface after the sniffing is complete. This can be done by executing:\nsudo ifconfig XHC20 down\n\nMy question is: can I leave the XHC20 interface \"up\" even when I'm not actively sniffing it?\nWhat are the implications (performance, memory, security, etc.)?\n\nA: Yes, you can leave the interface \"up\" when not actively sniffing it.\nThe interface is actually a sort of pseudo interface based on BPF. Those are generally very performant, and have little to none implication for performance and memory usage.\nIn terms of security, you could be exposing the your USB traffic to other users on the same Mac that have access to the interface, but not otherwise to your USB traffic. This is not commonly the case on macOS installations in homes / offices.\n", "Q: Add/replace image in Keynote 9.1 (6369) from outside Photos or Movies I am working in Keynote 9.1 (6369). \nApple support shows one can drag-and-drop in an image. But is there really no more direct way to, having clicked on the photo icon in the bottom-right corner of the media placeholder, navigate outside of the Photos or Movies directories? That seems astounding. \nCan I set the list of directories from which Keynote allows me to choose images? Or is there a setting to navigate via Finder instead of the default UI for choosing? \nIf this behavior is improved in the more recent versions of Keynote, that might be close to a reason to upgrade my OS. \n\nA: You can add images via the \"Insert > Choose…\" menu item (bottom-most menu item in the Insert menu). This opens a regular Finder window.\nYou can also use the corresponding keyboard shortcut Shift-CMD-V.\n\nTo replace an existing image, you select the image on the slide, choose the \"Format > Image\" sidebar and then click the \"Replace\" button (brings up Finder window again).\n\n\nA: In Keynote 9.2.1, if you can't find the image you're looking for in the built-in pop-up, you can simply drag and drop an image file from Finder into your slide. \nI believe this feature is available in all versions of Keynote.\n", "Q: Tools, languages, libraries and API's for development of a MacOS wide application Please just assume that the user has accepted whatever permission are required. \n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to listen to window actions under MacOS? In Swift\npreferably? \nFor instance, if a window moves, is resized, minimized and etc. \nPreferably without polling and comparing states.\n\n*Is it possible in Swift language get info on windows, or manipulate windows of other applications? Or do you have to rely on using something like the dreadful AppleScript? \n\n*How well does Swift stand on its own when developing MacOS applications? What fallbacks are required? \n\n*Is LUA and hammerspoon perhaps better suited for this kind of task? \n\n*Is it possible to draw around windows to add buttons and what not under MacOS? Would this be possible in Swift, AppleScript or Objective C? \n\n\nA: *\n\n*No, there is no public API for these events on macOS. The programming language does not matter.\n\n*Yes. Using the Accessibility frameworks. The programming language does not matter.\n\n*Swift is Apple's recommended development language for macOS. Discussions about Swift are better answered elsewhere.\n\n*See above.\n\n*Within your own application, yes this is possible. Sections of windows can be transparent.

I'm 100% that I haven't made these changes myself, nor has anyone else in terms of physically accessing my mac. \nWondering whether this is a common issue or some form of malware/virus?\nI've ran Malwarebytes and various other tools to try detect an infection, nothing was detected.\n\nA: I recommend you reset your NVRAM. This chip stores information on screen resolution and can often become corrupted. You can reset it by starting your Mac while holding down cmd + opt + P + R . You should hear the Mac chime, restart and chime a second time. Then you can release the keys you are holding.

You may enable mouse keys - press 5 times Alt key and then use keyboard to move the cursor.\nAlternatively you may install some third party tool to control the mouse. My recommendation goes to Karabiner Elements, because I use it for bunch of other useful staff. Once you install it you should  add Mouse Keys Mode.\nThere is also https://github.com/h2ero/XEasyMotion   but I haven't used it personally.\n", "Q: Is it safe to cancel tmutil delete halfway through? I wanted to delete my oldest backups to free up space on my backup drive.\nDue to some confusion, I \"accidentally\" deleted all backups.\nThe image shows the current progress of the command:\n\nIs it safe to just ctrl-c/ctrl-d this?\nI don't care about deleting the rest, I bet there is enough space by now and if not I'll find out and obviously delete again.\n\nA: You have two choices: let it run and delete everything; or stop it and see what's left. The residual backup may be incomplete, in terms of files and times, but it will be something. \nMy advice for TM has always been: don't mess with it. let it do its thing. When the drive gets full, either let it start deleting the oldest backups (which it will do itself), or get a bigger drive and start again or transfer the archive.\n", "Q: Inconsistent app update sizes in App Store and Launchpad I saw there was an update for Xcode in the App Store that said the update size was 7.8GB. However, when I was updating the app, Launchpad said the update size was 3.59GB.\n\nWhat is the actual update size, and why is there a discrepancy?\nI'm currently using macOS Catalina, but I think I noticed the issue in Mojave as well.\n\nA: The App Store supports compression and differential downloads that saves you time and bandwidth by only downloading the differences between the current version and the version, you already have installed. \nThis explains why the updated version can be listed at 7.8 GB while only 3.59 GB are downloaded.\nNote that it is not possible to download differentials in all cases. In those case you download the full package. Also note that if a differential download fails (for example due to the internet connection breaking up) - then a full download is attempted on the next try.\n", "Q: Homebrew services - how to stream its log?

If i run it as a homebrew service, which is what mongodb itself recommends for mac, with command brew services start mongodb-community, I won't get any log output.\nHow do i continually stream the log? For mongod, or other homebrew services?\n\nA: The mongodb-community service logs to the following places:\n$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/var/log/mongodb/mongo.log\n$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/var/log/mongodb/output.log\n\nUsually this means that they're located in:\n/usr/local/var/log/mongodb/\n\nYou can continually stream the logs using a command like this in the Terminal:\ntail -f /usr/local/var/log/mongodb/*.log\n\n\nA: You have several options to start mongodb and show the mongo log:\n\n\n*\n\n*Directly in the Terminal window:\nbrew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community && tail -f -n100 /usr/local/var/log/mongodb/mongo.log  \n\n\n*In a second Terminal windows (or a tab) (the second one has to have a known tty device number - you get it e.g. with w or tty):\nbrew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community; tail -f -n100 /usr/local/var/log/mongodb/mongo.log > /dev/tty001;\n\n\n*Send the log to a detached screen:\nbrew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community && screen -dmS mongolog tail -f -n100 /usr/local/var/log/mongodb/mongo.log\n\nto attach to the screen use screen -d -r mongolog in a second window/tab.\n", "Q: How do I send a Ctrl+Alt+Delete when connected from the Screen Sharing app to a Windows computer?

I was upgrading the memory, SSD and optical drive (modded a blu-ray drive with the original upper shell from the SuperDrive) in a MacBook 2010 White Polycarbonate a1342 when I realized that one of the headers was...gone.\nIt turns out I may have accidentially broken it off, I think. So I took the cable and taped it somewhere else for the meantime.\nThe hader I think I have broken off is in the corner between the battery and optical drive. There are two very flat, slim headers with cables coming from - seemingly - the battery part, and they both plug in there. I somehow broke the other header, whilst not having even touched it after putting the plug back in (and it took me forever to do this with my fingers...). But when I was leaning back, I noticed that the bottom cable was loose again and when I tried to re-insert it, the corresponding header for it seemed to have disappeared.\nI tried to find out what header it was, but unfortunately, all that shows up is the \"Power on Pads\" related topics and pinouts, with the MagSafe adapter included. But it does not tell me what header is on there, and if it is important or not.\nAfter putting it together, I booted the laptop and it seemingly had no errors turning on. True, I have no OS on there right now but it still seems to be fine. The optical drive also seems to be powered and lets me insert stuff into it.\nWhat do you think the broken header is, and how can I find it out? The cable seems to have two pins, whilst the other looks like having three. The 2-pin one has no socket anymore.\nEDIT: I shared these pictures on Discord as I tried to get some additional help.\nHeader area:\n* https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/516146586263486499/654435822237646849/IMG_0999.jpg\n* https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/516146586263486499/654435825441964053/IMG_0998.jpg\nThe now header-less plug: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/516146586263486499/654435822631649290/IMG_0997.jpg\n\nA: The broken header appears to be the right speaker connector (or the sleep LED connector). \n\nComparing it with the \"left side\" (and considering the two cables only) I tend to the speaker connector. The accompanying text is not very precise.\nBoth links/pics from: iFixIt's MacBook Unibody Model A1342 Logic Board Replacement\n", "Q: Which USB ethernet classes does iOS support Firstly, I posted the same question on stackexchange and did not know about this community.\nI'm busy with a USB ethernet implementation to provide an ethernet connection to an iPhone over USB.\nI'd prefer to use CDC ECM but it seems like iOS does not support this. It does however work with CDC NCM.\nDoes anyone know or know where I can read on what USB ethernet classes are supported by iOS.\n\nA: I don't think Apple has published a publicly available list. However, some manufacturers do seem to have a collaboration with Apple on USB-ethernet devices, so they probably have received documentation from Apple on what's recommended.\nI'm currently working on the exact same as you, and have found that CDC ECM does not work, nor does RNDIS over ACM work. And as you describe, it seems devices using CDC NCM can be made to work. I have also tried EEM, but couldn't get it to work - that might be due to errors on my part however.\nI haven't got any further information than that at the moment.

During this maintenance cycle, the computers will restart to the login screen and enter a thaw and locked mode for a period of time.

The standardoutpath log lists all the updates which is exactly what I want.\n\n\nIssue\nAfter restarting the computer to see if results stick, I notice that the results cannot be replicated. Instead I receive the following in StandardErrorPath log:\n\nRemoteUpdateManager exiting with Return Code (1)\n\nBased of the RUM guide, Return Code (1) is: \"Generic error, for example an internal error. For example, this might be the case where Adobe Application Manager installation is corrupted or network is not present. In this case, typically, the process of downloading or installing updates cannot be started at all.\"\nI went as far to apply chmod 777 and chown root:wheel to both the .sh and .plist, along with `/usr/local/bin/RemoteUpdateManager'. Tried without sudo in the .plist and .sh. \n\nA: Since the launchd plist is in /Library/LaunchDaemons/ it's going to be run as root. Given that, you don't need to call sudo as your first program argument, nor do you need it in the shell script. Also, it's good practice to use full paths in program arguments so /bin/sh instead of sh.\nThat's all just housekeeping though. What I find interesting is that it works when you are logged in as a user but does not work when launchd runs it upon load during restarting. The launchd.plist man page section for RunAtLoad has this little warning:\n\nThis key should be avoided, as speculative job launches have an adverse effect on system- boot and user-login scenarios.\n\nFor that reason I avoid using RunAtLoad true for root level launchd tasks. I suspect what you're seeing is that the system is not ready to run RemoteUpdateManager at the moment when launchd loads your plist. \nRunAtLoad is awfully handy, though, so you may have to stick with it, but I'd play around other mechanisms to tell launchd when to run your script. You could try using StartInterval 60 or something to give the system 60 seconds to fully spin up after loading the plist. That assumes your maintenance window is at least 60 seconds long plus whatever time is needed by your script. An alternative could potentially be to use StartCalendarInterval but you'd want to be very sure that the maintenance window is rigidly defined in time and not cancellable by your users.\nYou could also keep RunAtLoad and use KeepAlive with SuccessfulExit true to make launchd keep trying to run your script until it successfully exits. It's not an elegant solution but it may work. If you're doing this make sure to set your ThrottleInterval to something reasonable or else launchd will complain mercilessly if the task is permanently failing.\nThe last thing to keep in mind is that your plist is going to cause your shell script to be run at EVERY restart. You should incorporate some mechanism in your shell script to detect if you're in a maintenance period and exit 0 if not.\n", "Q: Does the time machine backup include the backups of my iPhone? I have taken a full backup of my iPhone on my MacBook (about 200GB), which has taken my MacBook storage to 90%! Then I have taken a backup of my MacBook using Time Machine on my external hard drive. My question: does the time machine backup in my external hard drive include the iPhone iOS backup? \nI want to know because I want to delete the 200GB iOS backup from my MacBook. Both my iPhone and MacBook are running the latest OS.\n\nA: Time Machine makes a backup of everything in your computer, and since your iPhone backup is in your computer, it will back it up too.\nTo make sure, you can locate your iPhone backup in your Mac and then open your Time Machine drive and look for the same files in the corresponding location, and see if they have been copied.\nAccording to https://support.apple.com/bg-bg/HT204215, your iPhone backups are located by default in ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/. Open that location in your Mac, have a look at how many files are there, how much space they take, etc. Then, once your Time Machine backup is done, open the backup drive, go to the current backup's folder, navigate to the same route (it should be Users/(your username)/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/) and see if you have the same files. This way you'll be sure.\nEDIT: be warned: if you delete the files in your Mac, the next time you use Time Machine it will delete them in the most recent version of your Time Machine backup too (though it will keep them in your previous version).\n\nA: Yes, the Time Machine backup does usually include the backup of the iOS device that you have stored on the MacBook itself.\nYou can choose to exclude directories from the Time Machine backup, so you can do that to avoid these backups to be backed up again.\n", "Q: What is this blue arrow and how do I get rid of it? \nOn macOS this arrow just appears, and overlays on top of any window.\nHow can I get rid of it?\n\nA: The floating arrow can appear whilst using the Help menu to point out menu items in Finder, and in other apps. The example below is from Finder, but I tried this in Pages and Keynote and the function/appearance is the same.\n\nIn this screenshot, the arrow is white, not blue. The arrow is animated and moves around a bit to give a visual hint it is active.

But when I then hit the power button, suddenly, nothing happens.\nI always unplugged the power plug from the motherboard...but now it wouldn't even seem to accept the MagSafe connection anymore, as the plug does not even light up green nor orange.\nSo, I would like to know how I could diagnose this situation. I would guess that something is wrong with the power - but what would be a good way to do so?\n\nA: The symptoms are not good. The first thing to check on MagSafe issues is to replace that sub assembly since it’s cheap and easy. If you are not able to source that part, you could disconnect the battery and the display to see if you can get the mac to boot as a minimal system (or at least the MagSafe light to work).\nHopefully you don’t need a new logic board, but by disconnecting things that aren’t critical, you should be able to build up a working system assuming each part works.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624\nFor any Mac that’s not vintage, Consider a flat rate repair at Apple for situations like this. Assuming the internals aren’t mangled badly, they can and will test each part and repair all (including reasonable number of missing screws) for the paid flat rate cost.\nSince this is vintage, your best bet is sourcing some cheap donor machines in hopes of getting enough spare parts to validate which item has failed here.\n", "Q: My Mac Switches Audio Output From Bluetooth Headphones to Internal Speakers I was watching some youtube videos on my mac (macOS Catalina, MacBook Air, 13-inch, Mid 2012) with my paired Bluetooth headphones. Randomly, about 15 minutes in the audio output just switched to the internal speakers. Went into audio preferences and tried to select my headphones as audio output but it wouldn't change where the audio was playing from. I then disconnected and reconnected the headphones and it worked for around another 15 minutes, and then the same thing happened. I have experienced this issue multiple times with both my headphones and a pair of wireless earbuds. Both the headphones and the earbuds work with my iPhone 6 with no problems at all. Does anyone know a way to stop this from happening?\n\nA: This kind of issue has been widely noticed after the major updates of macOS from Mojave to Catalina. I would suggest you get the latest Catalina update that has been released couple of days ago. \nIn other hand, try the following two resolutions which might help you. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder\n\n*Click on “Go”\n\n*Then go to “Folder” \n\n*Type on the search tab ’ /Library/Preferences’\n\n*Look for a file with a filename “com.apple.Bluetooth.plist. \n\n*Delete that file. Not to worry though as will auto-create a new copy of the Bluetooth file.\n\n*Once file is deleted, restart your Mac device.\n\n\nPRAM or Parameter Random Accessory Memory that stores system settings on your Mac device such as settings on display, volume of your speakers, time zone settings and many others. Here’s how to reset PRAM on Mac: \n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your Mac device.\n\n*Press the Power Button.\n\n*Before the grey screen appears, press the Command, Option, P, and R keys all at the same time.\n\n*Continues pressing the keys Mac restarts and a startup sound can be heard for the second time.  \n\n*Finally, release the Four (4) keys:  Command, Option, P, and R keys\n\n", "Q: For making an assistive device, does iOS 13 enable control of a cursor using code? Curious if it's possible to control a cursor on an iPad, for example to allow someone who can't touch the screen to be able to generate movement commands some other way, and have those commands sent to the iPad to move and click the cursor.\nI heard iOS 13 has AssistiveTouch and allows things like a Bluetooth mouse, which gets toward what I'm asking about.\nAs an example, it would be great to use Python to send messages to the iPad to move the cursor, or use Python to emulate a Bluetooth mouse essentially. Anyone know if this is possible?\n\nA: You can use a Bluetooth mouse with iOS 13 by opening Settings > Accessibility > Switch Control > Switches, and then from there add the Bluetooth device. This allows you to control a cursor on screen.\nYou can also do on-screen navigation using other third party hardware in form of \"ordinary\" Switch Control equipment. In addition it is possible to use the camera to control navigation - moving your head to the left or to the right choosing diretion.\nYou can use Python on seperate hardware to emulate a Bluetooth mouse - this would make it possible to control the cursor from Python.\nAll the above have to do with system wide cursor control. There's also the option of developing your own app. If you do this, you can control the cursor within the app any way you like - this could for example be over the network controlled by Python. This is essentially the way that for example Citrix managed to have a controllable cursor on pre-iOS 13.\n", "Q: Horizontal lines showing only on night shift mode A bunch of clear horizontal pixel lines are showing on my MacBook pro laptop screen. This just happened today. I noticed these lines disappear when night mode is off. Can someone please let me know if this is just a technical issue with the update or if this may be a precursor for any future problems. please help me ( : .\nAlso, I haven't updated my laptop to the most recent update because one of my course websites isn't compatible with that version yet.\n\nA: I recommend you reset your NVRAM. This chip stores information on screen resolution and can often become corrupted. You can reset it by starting your Mac while holding down cmd + opt + P + R . You should hear the Mac chime, restart and chime a second time. Then you can release the keys you are holding.

I spent over an hour updating devices to get \"Family\" (shared) Reminders working again....and it still isn't. Then I find this, which is a bit infuriating:  \nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2019/10/01/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-upgrade-ios-13-reminders-app-iphone-xs-max-xr-update/#51aaac7e57b8\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2019/9/30/20892460/apple-ios-13-reminders-broken-icloud-sync-macos-catalina-delay-upgrade\n...but these articles are from September. SURELY this is fixed by now....right?! All devices are on iOS 13. When I send the invite to my wife's phone we accept it but then...nothing. There was a yellow exclamation point on the \"Family\" reminders previously (which I erroneously assumed upgrading to iOS 13 would fix), but after the upgrade didn't fix it, I tried re-creating and re-sharing, but no luck so far.  \n\nA: My apologies to the AskDifferent community - this was mostly just a rant due to frustration. After updating my iPhone to iOS 13.3 (like the other devices) then resharing the \"Family\" reminders, they started syncing with my wife's phone. I was just being a bit impatient, then those click-bait articles put me over the edge. :/ \n\nA: As per Apple's support article - Get ready for the new Reminders app (published on 11/12/2019):\n\nSharing a Reminders list using the Add People function does not work currently in iOS 13. Apple is aware of this issue, and it will be resolved in a future software update.\n\nThis is a blocker for me. I upgraded both iPhones to the 13.3.1 and re-sharing won't do it. It says it's shared on mine, my wife accepted the sharing but the lists won't show on hers. I'll keep an eye on this and try to update here once it gets fixed.\n", "Q: Every application's file open/save dialogue asks for \"Keystroke Receiving\" permission Is this a normal thing or I have some kind of plugins or applications which makes my requesters require this permission?\n\n\nA: I'm not sure why every application would want this. I have heard that apps using JavaFX trigger this permission, even though they don't explicitly want or need it. \nIt's therefore possible that it is an unintended effect rather than an actual case of apps needing or wanting to monitor the keyboard input.\nProbably best to deny and then allow if problems occur with the specific apps involved.\n\n", "Q: My MacBook Air suddenly shut down today, is there an easy way to find the associated log entry? My old 2012 MacBook air suddenly shut down. I had the battery recently replaced by a non-Apple shop since Apple has already obsoleted this model.\nThe battery was somewhere between 60% and 80% when this happened. I wasn't doing anything particularly power-consuming, WiFi was on but I was just editing some slides (no active browsing or movie-watching).\nI plugged the power in and restarted. The date was reset to something in 2018 and the time was wrong. I connected to the internet and let it auto-reset.\nI've had this new battery a month or two and it's worked fine until today; I can work offline for ~5 hours and still have ~30% charge left. \nQuestion: I've never looked closely at the console reports before so I don't know how to search for a sudden shut down, possibly due to loss of power.

From time to time I log into my server through screen sharing to find this warning:\n\nThere is a program trying to restart my server, and I can't for the  life of me figure out which one is the culprit. Sometimes the restart attempt gets blocked by the OS when other users are connected through the file sharing service, but other times (e.g. at night and during the weekends, when no one is in the office) the restart goes through. This drove me crazy when performing long backups overnight and coming to work in the morning to find a failed backup and no trace of what went wrong in the logs.\nSo now I'd like to get to the bottom of it.\npmset -g told me that autorestart was set to 1. I manually set it to 0 with pmset -a autorestart 0. This was a couple of weeks ago and I thought to have fixed the issue this way. But today I logged in to the same warning above, so something is still trying to restart the computer. autorestart is still correctly set to 0.\nI have to confess I don't know where to look.

My High Sierra installation did not come with a recovery partition, only internet recovery so I don't have csrutil. It's not in usr/bin, or the base install volume either like many have suggested, Single User Mode does not provide a csrutil either.\nI have looked through the stack threads on the issue, and can't find a single solution other than upgrading or reinstalling, neither are an option for me currently. I do not have access to a High Sierra version of cocoadialog (v3.0.0beta7/v2.3.7) so I can't use recover partition installer app either. \nDoes anyone have any suggestions on how to disable SIP at this point?\n\nA: Install rEFInd to your hidden EFI volume. You then can restart the Mac, hold down the option key to invoke the Startup Manager, select rEFInd and instruct rEFInd to enable/disable SIP.\nActually, this is the fastest way to disable SIP because you an also instruct rEFInd to immediately boot macOS after disabling SIP.\nSince you currently can not disable SIP, you will have to install rEFInd by not following the installation instructions. For example, to install to the internal drive EFI volume, you would enter the following commands.\n\nNote: The commands below may overwrite boot files if you already have Windows or Linux installed on your Mac.\n\ncd ~/Downloads/refind-bin-0.11.4/\n./refind-install --usedefault /dev/disk0s1 \n\nYou can also create a USB flash drive with rEFInd instead of installing to your internal drive. \nYou may need to add the following lines to the bottom of the refind.conf file.\ncsr_values 10,77\nshowtools csr_rotate, shell, gdisk, memtest, mok_tool, apple_recovery, windows_recovery, about, hidden_tags, reboot, exit, firmware, fwupdate\n\n \n", "Q: iCloud duplicating folders & files can not be opened (macOS Catalina) I have my documents folder on iCloud. Since installing Catalina folders have been multiplying. The original folder (e.g., Articles) has spawned duplicate copies (Articles 2 and Articles 3).\n\nThe original folder is empty, the duplicates contain files, but rarely (maybe even never) the same set of files. Usually the item count in the 2nd instance of the folder is one less that the 3rd instance. The duplicate folders also exist on iCloud.\nWhen I attempt to open a file through Finder I'm ignored - double-clicking on the file produces no result. If I try open filename in Terminal I at least get an error message \"The file filename does not exist.\"\nAny idea of what is going on?

So I got a USB-C hub with HDMI, RJ-45, USB-3.1 and SD card connectors. If it helps, it is from Networx, model no. Y-9115-S. It works, but gets ridiculously hot (40 - 50˚C) with only a USB stick or an ethernet cable plugged in.\nNo, I am not running ffmpeg on the hub's internal processor. \nThis happens with the hub on both the left and right side ports. It comes with its own power supply but I don't use it and run the hub unpowered. The hub temperature certainly is a design flaw in a first-generation product, but I wonder if it is normal. Have others experienced the same or is my hub defective?\n\nA: As usual, the flood of different converters uses only a few board designs, and the most popular one seems to use cheap components, most likely for power conversion from 5V to 3.3V for its internal electronics. A step-down converter (similar to a switching power supply) costs more than converting the excess voltage to heat via resistors, after all.\nI have now found a product made by iTeknic (model # IK-UC001) which actually carries a warning that it might heat up to 130 F in use, but so far it has stayed cool in tasks where the other adapters would heat up close to those 130 F. I have not looked inside (yet) but suspect it uses a step-down converter. They cost about 0.1% of the hub's purchase price, after all. \nI guess the Networkx hub's external power supply (for a device meant for portable use!) should had been a warning. The iTeknic hub comes without such a power supply.\n", "Q: Exit the \"Do you want to save your changes?\" dialogue as fast as possible (discard changes) When I press cmd-q or cmd-w on an app, sometimes I get a popup like:\n\nI just want to quit the app as fast as possible, I want to select the \"Revert Changes\" or \"Don't Save\" etc. equivalents without having to move my hand to my mouse/trackpad, move the mouse cursor to the button on the screen, and click.\nI don't want to have to take my hands off of the keyboard.\ncmd-backspace used to work for me\nBut it doesn't anymore, at least not in Preview.app.\nWhat's the new solution in Catalina?\n\nA: Press the Spacebar.\n⌘ + Backspace works if you are trying to choose “Don’t Save” but the Spacebar is what you want to select ‘Revert’.\n\nA: You could use Keyboard Maestro to check which buttons exist and then press the appropriate one. For example, I've bound cmd+shift+w to check for \"don't save\" and a few other options. It will then use the press button action to press \"don't save\" or whatever\nThis will work as long as you add any new dialogues to your if/else statements. I have like 3 and it deals with 90% of cases.\nIf you need a super generalized solution, you could just hit the appropriate number of tabs and then hit space. The problem with this is that sometimes there are a lot of extra fields in between the start and the \"don't save\" button\n\nA: Most Apple dialog buttons have key shortcuts. In the old days, if you held down Command, you would see what the shortcuts were in the button text. \nEnter will activate the default button, which is filled in with a colour (usually Blue).\nEscape activates Cancel.\nSpace will activate the current highlighted button, if you've got tabbing through menu items turned on. It may also select the 'non-default, non-cancel' action by default.\nCommand S activates \"Save\".  \nIn Applications that don't use Apple's Auto-save and Versioning, Command D activates \"Don't Save\". Otherwise, it selects the Desktop as the file location.\nCommand Backspace works when you try to close an Untitled document that's been auto-saved: then the choice will be to Delete it, or Save it with a name.\n", "Q: Harddisk exchange from one MacBook Pro to another MacBook Pro with same configuration and model with different serial no I am working as a system admin in a corporate company. Today I got one ticket from HR. HR is using MacBook Pro having a 100 GB harddisk. He needs to upgrade the harddisk from 100 to 500 GB. What I did at the moment is that I have the same MacBook Pro with 500 GB harddisk. I exchanged the harddisks for both the Mac in the live state that means on the state I didn't shut down both Macs. \nAfter exchanging harddisks neither of the Mac boot. Is it possible to install new os for two Mac hard drives.\n\nA: I'd suggest putting both the harddisks back into the devices they were originally in and try booting again. Make sure the laptops are plugged in when you do this. If that doesn't work, it's very possible you've damaged the disks by trying to pull them out while the laptops were running.\nIf it does work, then I'd use time machine to create a backup of the 100GB disk you're replacing on an external USB drive. Then, after that's complete, power off the laptop, replace the disk with a new one, then follow the steps here to \"Restore from a Time Machine Backup\".\nTo be clear, this is assuming these are older MacBook Pro's with removable harddisks, not the solid-state drives that are soldered onto the motherboards. Those cannot be removed or replaced, at least not without permanently destroying the entire machine.\n", "Q: Compare any checksum with proposed checksum by website I often download files from the Web and many websites suggest to compare a proposed checksum with what I obtain from my computer (usually in Terminal).\nHowever, as the checksums tend to be quite long 64 characters for sha256 or 32 for md5 for example, I was wondering if a universal Terminal line could be created to use what a website might propose as a checksum?\nI found askUbuntu question that is similar to mine, however restricted to md5sum. What I would like is a little bit what the contributor suggest but with any checksum algorithm (e.g., sha1, sha256, md5, etc.):\n$ echo \"checksum_suggested_by_site_to_be_put_here  filetohashA.txt\" | md5 -c -\n\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Here are two different approaches that can be taken, one using Automator and AppleScript, and the other using a bash script and Terminal.\nUsing Automator and AppleScript\nThe following example AppleScript code, used in an Automator Service1, set to Service receives selected files or folders in Finder, with a Run AppleScript action, will allow one to paste a copied MD5, SHA1, SHA256 or SHA512 checksum value into a dialog box and verify it against the selected file in Finder.\nIn macOS High Sierra, I saved the Automator Service1 as Verify Pasted Checksum. Then in Finder selecting a downloaded file for which I had a checksum copied to the clipboard, I right-clicked it and selected Verify Pasted Checksum from the Services context menu. I then pasted in the copied checksum and pressed the Enter key. It then returned the appropriate message.\n\n\n*\n\n*1 In macOS Mojave, and later, an Automator Service is called a Quick Action.

I am trying to get all the pictures from the old iPad to the new. When I turn on iCloud for photos I get the following error: “\n\nPhotos and Videos Synced from iTunes will be Removed\n\nThe problem is that I no longer have the PC which I used to sync. The only copy of all these photos is on the iPad and I am having a difficult time transferring them off the iPad.\nTo summarize, I want to get all the pictures from an old iPad. On the old iPad I have photos from the following sources:\n\n\n*\n\n*Import from iTunes.\n\n*Import from a digital camera using the converter.\n\n*Pictures taken with the iPad.\n\n\nI do not have easy access to a Mac or PC.\n\nA: If you can get access to a Mac or a PC, you should try the iMazing application.\nIt allows you to selectively copy data from your iPad. You should be able to get all photos from the Photos app. I believe iMazing can also copy individual apps and their data from one device to another.\nThe iMazing application can also create backups and lets you browse those backups. Make a backup. Save it to a USB pen drive. Whatever method you use to transfer photos from your old iPad to the new iPad, that USB stick will be your safety net. Keep it around until you are sure the new iPad has all the photos.\n\nA: You can use the camera connector ( https://www.apple.com/au/shop/product/MK0W2AM/A/lightning-to-usb-3-camera-adapter ) + 30 pin cable (the one that fits your older iPad) + lightning cable (the cable for your new iPad). \n\n\n*\n\n*Camera connector goes to your iPad. \n\n*Use the extra lightning slot to\nprovide power to the iPad/connector. \n\n*Use your 30 pin cable from the\nold iPad to plug that into the USB-A slot.  \n\n*Unlock new iPad and go to\nphotos.  \n\n*Unlock old iPad. \n\n*They may ask if you want to \"trust.\" Tap in\npasscode to say yes. \n\n*New iPad will show \"import\" tab/button.  \n\n*Import\naway.\n\n\nMay take some time depending on # of photos and videos. That is why you have it plugged into power.\n\nA: Alternatively, create an Outlook account and install on each iPad the OneDrive app.\nTurn on each iPad the OneDrive Camera upload to ON. This might be the solution to your problem.\n\nA: You could consider using PhotoSync.\nhttps://www.photosync-app.com/home.html\n\nA: You have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup the old iPad using iCloud and then restore the backup onto the new one.

I have always used my Mac/iTunes to back up iOS devices.\nOne benefit I see is that my Mac Time Machine solution will backup the contents of the computer, including the iOS backups – I imagine that as creating something similar a to snapshot history of the iOS devices (assuming one can navigate to earlier Time Machine snapshots, and extract & restore the iOS backups therein).\nRecently, Apple seems to have improved its iCloud Backup solution. Does Apple provide snapshot histories of iOS backups, or only the latest backup image?\n\nA: There used to be a statement in the iCloud Terms and Conditions Version from March 1, 2017 (Internet Archive Link) that \"iCloud will store your last three backups\" (for a device).\nHowever, this statement has been removed as of 2020. The Terms now only say that \"If a device has not backed up to iCloud for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days, Apple reserves the right to delete any backups associated with that device.\" (current iCloud Terms and Conditions).\nSpeaking from experience, iCloud does sometimes keep multiple backups for a single device, but as far as I know there is no way to control this behavior. \nIf you like to keep a snapshot history of your iCloud backups, I'd recommend to continue backing up using your Mac.  \n\nA: First you enable iCloud and all the services that you want to backup (for most it's all the checkboxes). During the night the iPhones makes an iCloud backup for that day.\nSo if you were to restore the iPhone, in setup process you could either choose to setup as new, backup from Mac or backup from the iCloud. If you choose iCloud, you would get everything back included all apps that would automatically download and network settings for example.\nHere is the tricky part. While by default most people choose the iCloud backup to get their latests backup and that works for almost everyone, you can also set the iPhone as new, get back your iCloud data (contacts, messages, photos) but discard network settings and other settings that don't get included in the regular iCloud saves. When you do this on create a secondary backup that's available to choose when you will setup a new phone next time, so in a sense it's a snapshot. \nAs to why you would need that, that's another questions and I for sure wouldn't rely on this method.\nHere is an image of how it looks like when you have multiple iCloud backups to choose from on restore. Note also that you can delete other backups from previous phone from settings > iCloud > backups.\n", "Q: Is getting a Mac Pro to run Windows useful in any way With the new Mac Pro recently released I can't help but be intrigued.\nThe thing that stands out the most for me is the hardware options the Mac Pro has.\nI have a few questions about running Windows on the new Mac Pro.\n\n\n*\n\n*Would it be possible to just install Windows 10 onto the hardware,\nby completely removing OSX? I.E. would windows be compatible with the motherboard, CPU, RAM, etc? I would think the answer is yes,\nbut maybe there are BIOS settings or limitations.\n\n*Would running Windows with Bootcamp allow the computer to take advantage of the hardware on the Mac Pro? Eg, to play games, edit videos, etc.\n\n*Is there any benefit in getting a Mac Pro if one is simply going to install Windows on the machine? The box is designed with cooling and aesthetics, and it's easier than building a custom rig.\n\n\nI know these sorts of questions come up often, but I couldn't find any information regarding only the hardware. Most comments on this topic involve Bootcamp and various ways to run windows on OSX. \nI'm mostly curious to know if one could buy a Mac Pro and be able to benefit from Mac's great hardware as well as have all the benefits of using Windows, which for me are mostly playing games and software development using .NET (4, not core).\n\nA: There is very little difference between running Windows 10 on a PC and a Mac. The Boot Camp Assistant that comes with macOS is just a utility that simplifies the installing Windows in dual boot arrangement. \nThe Boot Camp Assistant also allows the user to download the drivers needed to install Windows as the only operating system on the Mac. However, Apple offers no other assistance in doing so.\nThere has been issues in the past were Apple has released a new Mac before the Windows drivers (Windows Support Software) was available. So you probably want to ask about running Windows before purchasing the latest Mac models.\nSo the answer to your questions:\nQuestion 1: Yes, but you need macOS to first download the Windows Support Software.\nQuestion 2: Yes, the Windows Support Software provides all the drivers need to run all the hardware included on a Mac.\nQuestion 3: Most likely there are other PC manufacturers that provide the same hardware at a lower cost. A lot of what you pay for when purchasing a Apple goes to support macOS. Apple provides little or no support for Windows. (Other than providing the Windows Support Software and the Boot Camp Assistant.)\n", "Q: MacBook Air 10.15.2 Shuts Down on Startup, falsely indicating 0% battery I have a MacBook Air, with Catalina 10.15.2. When I start it up unplugged, with a full battery, most of the time it starts up and then immediately shuts down. When I hit the power button again, it shows the red power indicator with 0%. I plug it in and it launches just fine. \nI brought it into the local Best Buy and they ran hardware diagnostics and said everything looks fine. \nHow can I get it working without cord ? \n\nA: I believe the battery in your laptop is shot. It might say it's fully charged, but the internals are no longer sufficiently capable of holding a charge or delivering enough of a consistent supply of electricity to safely run the laptop (to be clear, by \"safely\", I mean \"without it losing power and shutting down\", not \"without causing harm to you and your loved ones\").\nI suspect it won't be long before the battery stops saying it's fully charged, and starts displaying an X through the charge level icon.\nWhat you describe is exactly what happened to my old MacBook a few years ago.\n\nA: *\n\n*Perform an SMC reset\n\n*If an SMC reset doesn't resolve the issue, I would recommend taking it to the Apple store. BestBuy Geeksquad aren't trained on Apple hardware (they are untrained in general) aren't authorized Apple repair centers. \nYou can check to see if your hardware is still under warranty here. Apple should still offer you in store support to diagnose the issue. If a hardware fault is found, it would be covered under the warranty. If you're out of warrant, you'll have to pay for the repair out of pocket.\n", "Q: Is CSS injection possible on iPad using Safari? There is a possibility to use a custom style sheet in Safari on Mac to inject CSS syntax that changes the rendered output of web pages. \nI’m seeking a similar tool for iPad and iPadOS. \nIs there any way to use CSS injection in Safari or other browsers on the iPad? \n\nA: To inject a custom CSS into a webpage on iPad you can use the app Shortcuts. First, you need to create a new shortcut:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Shortcuts\n\n*Select Create Shortcut > Web > Run JavaScript on Web Page\n\n*Use the following JavaScript:\nfunction addStyleString(str) {\n    var node = document.createElement('style');\n    node.innerHTML = str;\n    document.body.appendChild(node);\n}\n\naddStyleString('body { color: red !important }');\naddStyleString('body { background: silver !important }');\n// This way allows you to add CSS in multiple passes\n\n\n// Call completion to finish\ncompletion();\n\n\n\n*Tap Next\n\n*Add the Shortcut Name\nTo apply a custom CSS you need to run the shortcut in Safari:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a web page in Safari\n\n*Tap on the share button\n\n*Scroll all the way down and tap on the newly created shortcut.\nHINT: Use !important in CSS injections to override default rules.\n\nA: I found that this was possible with a satisfactory solution on ios 15.1+ using the a user.js and the Userscripts app.\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887\nAn example userscript that just adds css:\n// ==UserScript==\n// @name         Nicer style on example.com\n// @namespace    codesthings.com\n// @license      MIT\n// @version      1.0\n// @description  Adds my user style to example.com\n// @author       JamesCodesThings\n// @match        *://*.example.com/pages/*\n// @grant        GM_addStyle\n// ==/UserScript==\n\n(function(){\n  const userStyle = `body.readable {\n  font-family: sans-serif;\n  font-size: 1.2rem;\n  background-color: #222;\n  line-height: 1.25;\n}\n\n/* More CSS Here */\n`;\n\n  // I found that increasing specificity helps on iOS.\n  document.body.className += 'readable';\n\n  GM_addStyle(readableCss);\n})();\n\nYou can host your userscript somewhere like greasyfork.org, then visit the script download page on iOS safari and use the extension to install the user script.\nExample full userscript: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/448219-lazyfoo-readable-css\n\nA: Automatically?\n\nNo. (at least not as of mid-2022)\n\n\nIf someone were to write a Safari extension*, or if Apple adds support in a future iOS version, then the answer would of course change.\n*(if even possible: macOS Safari has the Cascadea extension… if doing the same thing on iOS/iPadOS were trivial, it seems that extension’s developer might have already done so)\n\nFor more background details and possible workarounds (besides the ’Shortcuts’ method that @mykola-zotko suggested in the earlier answer), please see the answers at: “Can I over-ride CSS with user-css on Mobile Safari?”\n\nA: Yes, automatically script injections works on iOS.\nYou could use the Userscripts app mentioned above, it works on iOS and macOS Safari. The easiest thing to do is use the macOS version to install your scripts, and then sync them to your iOS device using iCloud. Save the scripts on macOS in an iCloud folder that you could access on iOS.\nWorks flawlessly. Also, no need to use a UserScript (Javascript) to load stylesheets, as UserStyles is supported directly.\nYou'll need iOS 15.1 or newer.\nPS! To get your scripts to sync faster, open Finder on your mac to the scripts folder you've choosen, and the open the same folder in Files on your iOS device. You'll see the files syncing faster.\n", "Q: How to Fix Generic File Icons in macOS Catalina?

How do I set this up? I've looked at different software such as OpenVPN and Tunnelblick. I'm not sure how to set up remote access. Any suggestions? Advice?\nAdditional information: \nThere is basically no IT department. So I would need to set up the server side solution as well if that is what is needed. \nMore information:\nI basically need to use the database connection from inside the company network. \n\nA: Who is supporting your network at your company? An \"IT\" department? You? An outside company/managed service provider (MSP)?\nIT Dept - ask them if they can offer a VPN connection for remote access.\nMSP - ask them if your firewall supports a VPN connection for remote access. If it does, ask them what is required to set it up (this may be billable).\nYou - you're probably in over your head. To start with, you need to know what kind of firewall you have.\n\nA: First, your company might have its own VPN setup guidelines and then only you can use third-party VPN tool after your IT department suggests you. \nCisco Anyconnect Secure Mobility client is a widely used third-party tool that you can use only after your company sets up the VPN accordingly to connect your company network. \nAnd then, to work remotely you need to Microsoft Remote Desktop v10 (you can get it from Mac Store) if you are trying to access the Windows machine of your company. \nI hope this gives you an overall idea of accessing company network from your machine. \n\nA: All macs support screen sharing out of the box.

You could be seen as bypassing security and opening them to data exfiltration, remote control and security breaches when you connect in without their permission.\nYou can write the guidelines if the company is small and start slowly. You’ll choose a strong password on your mac and only use one software and then let them review the setup once you’ve tested it. Someone either pays for internet or set up the network, so work with them and you’ll be set.\nEven if you VPN in - Screens Connect is great and you can try it out for free using https://setapp.com/ and then just rent it if you don't want to buy it.\nLastly, ubiquity offers powerful networking gear if you wanted to hire network specific tools for this task. Then you could set up a point to point VPN or have work install this gear so you can securely connect if they have nothing set up for this yet.\n\n*\n\n*https://ui.com/consoles\n", "Q: Thunderbolt Cinema Display to nonThunderbolt Macbook Pro 2010 I've been looking everywhere online to see whether my question can be answered and I still can't seem to find an answer. \nI have a mid-2010 Macbook Pro with a Mini DisplayPort and I recently was given an Apple Cinema Display Thunderbolt 2 Screen at work however I believe that it's not possible to connect the screen to my laptop with the Thunderbolt 2 cable. \nIs there any way to bypass this? \nI don't want/need audio or anything, I just need my screen to be projected onto the screen. Is there an adapter from Thunderbolt 2 to USB so I can connect it through the USB port or to the FireWire 800 port? \nThanks!\n\nA: Ultimately, the Thunderbolt Display will not work with a 2010 or earlier mac.\nWhile Thunderbolt output ports are backwards compatible with Mini DisplayPort, the reverse is not true. So, if you had a 2011 or newer mac with a thunderbolt port, you could plug in an older Mini DisplayPort monitor, and it will work perfectly, but you cannot plug a newer thunderbolt monitor into an older Mini DisplayPort port.\nFurthermore, the monitor cannot be connected through USB or FireWire, as they do not carry a display signal.\nAll that to say, I'm afraid the screen you were given at work is not going to function with your 2010 MacBook Pro.\n", "Q: How am I supposed to install El Capitan on a new SSD without recovery partition?

I need to copy some sentences/use text to speech on the doc. In preview, however, many of the words are mashing together (the spaces are being removed. Thus: \n\n\"This statement introduces highly complex feature Romans. On the one\n  hand, Paul is insistent\"\n\nbecomes:\n\n\"ThisstatementintroducesahighlycomplexfeatureofRomans.\n  Ontheonehand,Paulisinsistent\"\n\nNow, it's very possible that that is how the metadata is normally read. For example, Skim also has the same problem. On the other hand, Adobe Acrobat Reader is including the spaces. Chrome also functions the way that Adobe does. The problem is that I don't know why preview is functioning the way it is.\nMy question(s) are the following (any of which will satisfy me):\n\n\n*\n\n*why is this happening? Does Preview process text differently (or does Adobe have some kind of spell check)\n\n*is there a way to fix this (either by getting the metadata from adobe into preview or by getting preview to work correctly).\n\n\nA: Solved (probably). I realized that I actually created the PDF from another PDF. The original PDF was poorly OCR-ed (Optical Character Recognition) and I believe that Preview was reading that OCR. I re-OCR-ed my new doc and I think that's where Acrobat was getting it. I just made a PDF of images from the old PDF and then re-OCR-ed it so that all the old metadata was gone. Thanks!\n", "Q: How do I prep a, temporary, root login before editing sudoers? I want to alter my sudo capabilities on my mac, to avoid password prompts on starting postgres among other things.  I'm reading Michael Lucas' Sudo Mastery and generally have an OK idea on how to modify the entries and use visudo.\nHowever, Michael makes the point that, regardless of what you do, editing sudoers is inherently unsafe and can lock you out of your machine.  And he goes out of his way to warn people to activate a root login, especially on macOS.  Once your sudoers file is ok and you've confirmed that with a reboot, you can always disable the root.\nI mean, if it's just copying the original sudoers and then, when things blow up, safe boot, go to the Terminal and restore the backed up sudoers, that's fine.  But I want to be 110% sure I will not get locked out.\nNote:  I might very well try my hand on a Linux VM's sudoers first, but I still want to have an escape route.\nOn macOS Mojave, keeping in mind Apple's various intentional security limitations around safe boots and SIP, what are the simplest steps to go create temporary root login backdoor?\n\nA: No backdoor is required, in fact really nothing (not even a backup) is required to edit the sudoers file. You can't get locked out of your machine.\nA backup (sudo cp /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.bak) is more convenient though, because you can simply restore it with a one-liner.\nReasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudoers is not required to authenticate a user at log-in\n\n*sudoers is not required to activate the root user with Directory Utility - only a working admin account. Authentication is done with the local OD services.\n\n*If you have a working Internet connection or a working local Recovery Mode (aka recovery partition) you can always restore the default sudoers file either from an online resource (e.g. pastebin or github) or as mentioned earlier: more convenient from a local backup file.\n\n*If you have a second Mac and some fitting cable you can always start the \"broken\" Mac in Target Disk Mode and transfer a working good sudoers file from the second Mac.\n\n\n\nTested in a Mojave VM by: \n\n\n*\n\n*simply removing the sudoers file completely\n\n*editing sudoers with nano and commenting out the root and %admin line, changing ownership of sudoers to 501:staff and make it 777\n\n\nProof:\n\n\nA: With due respect to the other folks who have offered suggestions so far, they are offering far more complicated ideas than are necessary.\nHere is the simple truth: from at least 10.11 onward, there is no need to ever touch your /etc/sudoers file. None. Just leave it alone.\nLook at the bottom of the /etc/sudoers file and you will see these lines:\n## Read drop-in files from /private/etc/sudoers.d\n## (the '#' here does not indicate a comment)\n#includedir /private/etc/sudoers.d\n\nWhat that means is that you can put files in /etc/sudoers.d/ and sudo will read them as if they were in the main sudoers file without ever having to touch the official sudoers file.\n(In some versions of macOS, you may need to create the folder via sudo mkdir /etc/sudoers.d/ but in recent versions, it already exists.)\nYou can create/edit the file like this:\nsudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/foo\nWhen you exit the editor, visudo will check the syntax for you, but even if you ignore the warnings and save it anyway, sudo will ignore any file in /etc/sudoers.d/ which does not have the correct syntax, but your main sudoers file will remain intact and working.\nYou can run sudo visudo -c to check the syntax of any/all sudoers files, and to show that they are being read/included.\nFiles in /etc/sudoers.d/ should be owned by root, they should be chmod 440 and they should not have any file extension (i.e. “foo” is ok but not “foo.txt”) If you create the file using visudo it will automatically be given the correct permissions.\n(Oh, and you don’t need to enable root on a Mac. I’ve used one since 2003 and done all sorts of weird stuff but I’ve never needed it.)\n\nIf you ever do manage to screw up your /etc/sudoers file, you can use BBEdit to edit the file. It will prompt you for your admin password, but once entered, it can edit the file and remove the offending line. But you should still never edit the /etc/sudoers file. \n\nA: macOS is a bit safer than most unixish OSes in this respect, since it has paths to root that don't depend on sudo. If you do mess up /etc/sudoers, there are several ways to recover (even without advance preparation, aside from backing up /etc/sudoers):\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the Directory Utility (it's hidden in /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications, but Spotlight can find it). Click the padlock and authenticate, then choose Edit menu > Enable Root User, and enter a root password. When you're done with root, you can disable it the same way.\n\n*You can use AppleScript's do shell script ... with administrator privileges to run shell commands as root. Open /Applications/Utilities/Script Editor, and enter something like this:\ndo shell script \"cp /etc/sudoers.bkp /etc/sudoers\" with administrator privileges\n\n... and press the run (right-pointing-triangle) button in the toolbar. Authenticate when prompted.\nThen there's also the simple & universal method: before messing with /etc/sudoers, run sudo -s to open a root shell and leave it open so you can use it to recover if necessary. It obviously won't survive a reboot, but you can do basic tests on your new /etc/sudoers before rebooting.\n", "Q: External drive won't eject cleanly I have several external drives, all of which work fine, but recently purchased and backed up to a new drive (Samsung T5) which always fails to eject cleanly. Whenever I try to eject it, I'm asked:\n\n“Drive” is a volume on a disk that has 2 volumes. Do you want to eject “ Drive” only, or both volumes?\nTo eject both, click Eject All, or hold down the Option key while ejecting.\nTo eject only “Drive,” click Eject, or hold down the Control key while ejecting.\n\nUnless I choose Eject All, the drive stays around, so I choose Eject All. But then I get a message that says \"Drive - Data\" was not ejected because it was in use, and I have to Force Eject to finally eject it. When I then unplug the drive I get a warning that doing so might have caused problems.\nThere's nothing that I know of that's actually using the drive when I do this, and no damage seems to be done.\nWhy won't my Samsung T5 eject cleanly?\n\nThe drive is formatted APFS/GUID, unencrypted and is a bootable clone with FileVault enabled (though it behaved this way before FV was enabled too, and before anything was backed up to it.)\n\nA: This issue is generally caused by a background process that is taking a (very) long time to complete. \nIn my case it was Spotlight indexing, which I don't need for the drive in question. So after confirming that it the culprit was indeed Spotlight and terminating it, I simply disabled Spotlight indexing for the drive, and now I am able to eject cleanly. Similar instructions apply for identifying and terminating whatever process is the cause generally.\n\nA: Logging out and logging back in should allow you to eject any drive that does not host the operating system currently in use. \nAs to why, finder is often the culprit.\n", "Q: Bootcamp \"Missing Operating System\" on external drive I've been using an external disk drive to use boot camp on my MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012).

I found this very useful script that does the job for what I'm looking to achieve.\nIt's been taken from this post: Batch download URLs from a .txt file\n\nTo use the following method, you will need to install wget.\n       Make a file with the extension .sh in the same directory as your file containing the links and add this text to it:\nmkdir ~/Desktop/download\n\nwhile read line; do wget -E -H --directory-prefix=/Users/username/Desktop/download -k -p $line; done < file.txt\n\ncd ~/Desktop/download\n\nMake sure to edit the script and change username to your username\n       This reads file.txt for the URLs and runs the wget command multiple times with all the links one-by-one and saves them to a\n  folder named download on your desktop.\n\nI just need to make a small edit to make sure that between one request and another the script waits 5 minutes.\nCould you please tell me how to edit it?\n\nA: wget can read URLs directly from a file (-i file), and knows how to pause between downloads (-w seconds), so you don’t actually need a loop at all. Also, wget downloads into the current directory by default so you don't really need --directory-prefix either.\nJust run\nmkdir -p ~/Desktop/download\ncd ~/Desktop/download\nwget -E -H -k -p -w $((5*60)) -i file.txt\n\nPS: You might also want to add --random-wait to have wget wait between 0.5 and 1.5 times the number of seconds you've specified. This might help to avoid problems with sites who take extreme steps to detect and block wget requests.\n", "Q: How to choose mac battery? I had a problem with my battery(as I think). Actually I asked the question before about this issue here MacBook turning off suddenly\nAnd eventually, I have decided to change my battery. I opened my MacBook and took a few pictures\n\n\nAnd now I would like to buy genuine MacBook a1417 battery, by this search request I can find on eBay a lot of offers, but the question here is how to understand that this or that battery a really genuine(original) and I that I can buy it without any doubts? \nFor example this two \nhttps://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.co.uk%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F202630493472\nhttps://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F202496878288\nBoth of them wrote Genuine, but price difference in around 10$... and anyway how can I check that this battery really good and genuine one?\n\nA: Apple does not sell or distribute its OEM parts to consumers; Apple parts are only available to Apple stores and to Apple Authorized Service Providers. To get an Apple battery, you must either take your MacBook in for repair at an Apple store or to an Apple Authorized Service Provider. Neither of these sources will sell parts (here, a battery) by itself.\nThus, all MacBook batteries offered in the marketplace are non-OEM. They may be perfectly good (perhaps even taken from the same factory production line as Apple's parts), or they may be inferior. \nAs a consumer, the best you can do is to buy from a reputable source; one that offers its own warranty, and will replace the part if it is defective.\nI've installed several MacBook and iPhone batteries from iFixit.com, using non-OEM replacements. They've worked fine.\n", "Q: Reference book or websites on how Mac OS works I'm looking for a good book or other set of reference materials on how MacOS works.  I'm not concerned with the GUI tools or advanced Finder tips or things like that.  Rather, I'm interested in the UNIX underpinnings.\nI primarily used Linux for several years and still have a few Linux machines around, and much of my Mac use is in a Terminal.  But I have a basic grip on how a Linux machine works that I just don't have for a Mac.  For instance I know most Linux distributions use systemd, so I can poke around in that documentation.  I know the Mac uses launchd.  What would be nice is a book that explains these sort of technologies.  Other examples would be how application bundles work, or how kexts work.\nThe rough equivalent of \"How Linux Works\" from No Starch Press for the Mac would be good, but I can't find any books like that.  Even some decent webpages would be good - I can't find any on Apple's site.  Right now the best I can do is rummage around through the manpages on my system.  \n\nA: *\n\n*https://developer.apple.com has a lot of information, basic registration is free.\n\n*The books from http://newosxbook.com/index.php have more technical content than most macOS users/developers need in their lifetime.\n\n\nBesides that you should be able find a lot of information by just googling for \"macos launchd getting started\" and similar search terms.

Some iPhones  were advertised as being \"water resistant\" so I thought that there was no problem with keeping them in the bathroom out of the bathtub so that I could listen to music. Will they be safe?\nAfter all, if you can submerge an iPhone under liquid water for 30 minutes, then water vapor, which is filled with similar sized water molecules while having much lower density of water (and hence the minerals that come with the water) should be of no concern. Am I wrong?\n\nA: Apple's technical support document suggests avoiding taking an iPhone into a steam room:\n\nAbout splash, water, and dust resistance of iPhone 7 and later\nLearn about splash, water, and dust resistance on your iPhone.

How do I stop messages from appearing on the old phone and the log for incoming calls? I’m hesitant to delete my Apple ID since I purchase games occasionally with it. Is there a way I can still use the App Store and stop the messages from appearing?\n\nA: The officially supported way is to use Family Sharing. You create a child Apple ID using your account, and you will maintain parental control over the child account, including App Store, iTunes and Apple Books purchases. It will have access to all your apps and music, and you will have the opportunity to approve any purchases your grandchild makes.\nCreate an Apple ID for your child\n\nUse the steps below to create an Apple ID for your child, then add\n  them to your family group. After you add your child to your family\n  group, they will have their own Apple ID that they can use on any\n  Apple device. Your email address is the rescue email address for your\n  child’s account, and you can use it with the security questions you\n  provided to reset a forgotten password.\nIf the child already has a Game Center account, but not an Apple ID,\n  you don't need to create a new account for them. Just search for their\n  nickname instead.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > [your name] > Family Sharing > Add Family Member >\nCreate a Child Account > Next. If you're using iOS 10.2 or earlier,\ngo to Settings > iCloud > Family.\n\n*Enter your child's birthday and tap Next. Be sure to enter the\ncorrect date.\n\n*Review the Parent Privacy Disclosure and tap Agree.\n\n*Enter the requested information for your payment method and tap\nNext. If you don't have a payment method on file, you need to add\none.\n\n*Enter your child's name, tap Next, then create their Apple ID\n(username@icloud.com) and tap Next. Tap Create.\n\n*Follow the onscreen instructions to set a password, choose security\nquestions, and set up your child's account. Choose passwords and\nsecurity questions that you can both remember.\n\n*Turn on Ask to Buy to approve all iTunes, Apple Books, and App Store\npurchases initiated by your child.

I have a 2012 MacBook Pro 13 inch non-retina model .\nThe issue was ,from past one year I used to get service battery message but I still kept using without worrying about it.  \nThe OS  would boot sometimes or else it would not boot at all showing flashing folder with a question mark. Then I upgraded the hard drive that came with the device with an SSD thinking I would solve this problem by updating the OS to Mojave which runs on APFS system which they said was good with SSD. The booting issues were still there. I upgraded the battery thinking it would solve the booting issues.But only after which it did not boot at all.\nThe battery was either always full or didn’t charge at all it was very confusing because the MagSafe cable was green all time the os was very slow even if it booted.\nTook it to an Apple authorised service centre where they say even after changing the hard drive flex cable the booting issues are still there.\nThey can any time call me to take back the MacBook(as it was)as it’s been 2 months they’re working on it but no solutions found as I am being updated by them on a weekly basis.\n\nA: I would trust the technician that opened the mac, replaced some parts and knows what they’re doing. Apple training is very good at fault isolation and repair skills and accurate quoting. They would likely have tested a battery or offered you a battery swap which is the typical part failing when the board won’t charge a battery.\nThe cost of becoming skilled enough to repair a logic board is why it’s almost always cheaper to get a service part from Apple (which you can’t do anymore due to this being vintage/obsolete) and having Apple rework the part and/or scrap it for a new logic board when it’s uneconomical to repair your board.\nUnless you can get 5 Macs for scrap prices and try swapping and hope you hit the lottery, swapping the board for one that’s good is going to be the only chance you can get a cheaper repair than paying an expert to source your spare parts or perform some diagnosis on what’s failing on your specific board.\n", "Q: Calendar loses custom \"open file\" alerts On a Mac with High Sierra 10.13.6 Calendar loses any custom alerts linked to opening a file.

The reason is that I want to run an AppleScript as an alert, which after Mountain Lion I would need to do by saving it as an application bundle and opening the file.\nWhy does this happen and how to fix it?\n\nA: This drove me crazy at one point too.

I want to reorder (not change the default program) the programs suggested in the menu when I click on 'open with' for a file.\nI don’t want to add or remove programs, just sort them for easier selection.\nIs this possible natively or with another program or launcher?\n\nA: Unless someone comes up with some heavy magic, I'm going to say: \"No\". Apple lists the apps that can open that file type in alphabetical order. (Higher versions of the same app are listed first.)\nThe practical ways around this are removing apps or changing them when they offer to open a type you don’t want or establishing drop folders that open dropped documents in the app of your choosing when sending a document to the non-preferred app.\nFor example, LaunchBar app has a send to feature that lets you send a file to any app quickly with a couple key strokes, which does take setup and training.\n\nA: Since the programmes are presented in alphabetical order, you can just rename them or preface them with a numerical or alphabetic identifier. I have Lightroom CC as part of the Adobe suite. I think I must have added it by mistake and it now precedes Photoshop. So I kept on clicking on it by mistake, instead of Photoshop. I never use Lightroom CC as use the classic version, but I want to check it out, so don’t want to delete it yet.

Then at start, the library often will run a sanity check on next launch and show you what the library has received.\nIf you were sending hundreds of photos, it’s quite likely the transfer started and once you saw the visual indication that the transfer started, you closed the sending window before the send was complete. When training people to AirDrop, most seem to think they are done when the transfer is just getting started.\n", "Q: Enable Voice Control without floating mic icon TL;DR I have searched to find a way to hide the icon but still have Voice Control enabled, or at least have a way to permanently move the icon to the dock/menu bar/Launchpad but have found this discussed nowhere.\nAny suggestions on how I can have Voice Control enabled and have the floating icon permanently stored somewhere out of the way?\n\nIn the past year I discovered Dictation for my MacBook Pro. With Mojave the microphone icon was to indicate that dictation was activated. The Keyboard Shortcut I used to switch this on/off was to press either command key twice.\nI was new to integrating this feature in my daily MBP use when I upgraded to Catalina. The Keyboard Shortcut no longer worked (wether the Voice Control was enabled or not) which was fine because I discovered Voice Control, which I began using and really enjoy. It expands Siri to not just transcribe dictation and enables voice control in every function of my MBP.\nHowever, the floating mic icon is always on screen.

Instead of moving the Icon to a different place, my solution simply toggles it on and off with a quick applescript. Credit to Jono on the Keyboard Maestro forum for solving this.\nAdvantages of the method: saves a ridiculous amount of ram (VC takes tons)\nDisadvantages: you have to toggle it on and it takes a few secs.\nThe following applescript, which can be triggered by an automator workflow/shortcut, will toggle voice control on and off.

And if Voice Control is taking up memory, this would help. Mind you, turning Siri on if it wasn't before might take up extra memory anyway.\n\nA: It's a very pretty bit of artwork, but it gets in the way -- especially for the visually impaired, and aren't they the ones who need this assistive technology the most?

I am trying to compare Google Docs's Drawings with Mac's Preview, and if I can have a canvas, such as a white one with 1200 x 800 pixel, then I can start drawing rounded rectangles, lines, and text.\nHowever, there is no way to get a new blank document of 1200 x 800 pixel wide to begin drawing. Somehow it seems I have to find such an image, make a \"copy\" (the copy in copy-and-paste), and then \"Paste from Clipboard\".\nIs there some special or secret method or good method to create such a new document to draw on?\n\nA: This is exactly what a document template on macOS is intended to do. You make one document then flag it. Next time you open it (from automation, script, recents, finder) it creates a new empty document with precisely the setup you want.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/create-document-templates-on-mac-mchlp1341/mac\nEven though Apple documents this clearly and plainly, I suspect most people find it a “secret trick” or hidden gem once they have an itch like yours that needs scratching.\n\nA: There is one method:\n\n\n*\n\n*simply look at any webpage with some blank space or even with content.\n\n*Do a screenshot by Cmd Shift 4, and then dragging the mouse\n\n*Now you have a screenshot (default location of the file is Desktop)\n\n*Double click it, and now you are in Preview\n\n*Use Preview's Tools -> Adjust Size to get your desired size.

Recommended is 40ms so you can just set the keys which pose you a problem.\n\nA: There appear to be many variations on this question, that I have found.\nHowever the problem addressed in this question is the one that I was experiencing.\nSo I'd like to try to post here a comprehensive answer that addresses the best possible solutions that have come up so far, starting with all the most common, simplest and least likely to work suggestions up to the ones that seem to address this problem specifically.\nNote: If you've done your research, you'll note already an enormous amount of overlap with multiple pages linking back and forth to one another, in regards to this issue. My attempt here is simply to aggregate as many of the key factors involved into one place.\nBackground\nSo for a long time now, MacBook users have reported a 'double typing' issue, most especially with the most recent MacBook Pro's to hit the market. There have been many reports of this problem occurring on 2015, up to 2019 edition MacBook Pros, from the 13' to the 15' Touch Bar, and every thing in-between.\nThere appear to be multiple similar problems, that may or may not have more than one possible solution. The most common reported issues I have seen are:\n\n*\n\n*single keys such as b or n being pressed and outputting doubles like bb or nn in their place. Space bar is also commonly reported to be double typing.\n\n*some people may also be irked by the default setting of a double space autocorrecting to a period ..\n\n*instances of multiple repeated strings or sequences of keystrokes, at seemingly random intervals, for example whole words, or even multiple words appearing twice, and also modifier commands such as: ⌘+w or ctrl+tab.\n\nIn my case the problem was the latter. I'm sure other variations of this problem exist, these are the ones I've encountered most frequently in my search for a solution.\nPossible Solutions\nThis is a summary of most of the answers that I have come across so far, hopefully one of them will work for anyone who is experiencing this problem.\n\n*\n\n*System preferences -> keyboard = Slide the bar left to turn 'key repeat' to off. This is one of the most common solutions as it is by far the simplest and quickest to try. It's also the least likely, from what I've gathered.\n\n*cleaning your keyboard, as per these instructions there's even an app to help you do this\n\n*turning off the period autocorrect option = System preferences -> Keyboard -> Text: Uncheck \"Add period with double space\"\n\nThis problem has become so substantial that Apple has released an extended service specifically for this problem, whereby they are replacing keyboards free of charge for anyone who's device falls within their approved list, which as of Jan 2020 includes all Mac products using the butterfly keyboard.\nLike many others however, it seems to be increasingly clear that for most people (though not all) this is not a hardware issue. Many users, including myself, have testified that this occurs not just on the Mac keyboard, but external keyboards also, wired, wireless and bluetooth alike.\nMost significantly this problem appears to have started for many, only after installing Catalina.\nUsers have reported that the problem disappears when:\n\n*\n\n*Running their Mac in 'safe mode'\n\n*In other user accounts on their machine (this is true in my case)\n\nSo a number of other suggestions have also popped up. For those who believe that their problem is software related, the following solutions may work for you.\n\n*\n\n*Install an app called Unshaky\n\n*Reset your NVRAM as per a comment from this other question\n\n*\n\n*option+⌘+P+R\n\n\n\n*Update to the latest version of macOS Catalina (version 10.15.3 as of the time of writing) -- System Preferences -> Update Software\n\n*Create a new user account\n\n*Re-Install MacOS in the Background\n\n*Roll back to the previous MacOS, Mojave\n\n*And the worst case scenario - A full wipe of your system and re-install a fresh version of your MacOS\n\nFor anyone who has Wacom tablet software installed\nthis Reddit post appears to have isolated a fairly specific problem, but it appears to have fixed the problem for a lot of people, and makes intuitive sense to me, for anyone who has Wacom Driver software in their system.\n\n*\n\n*Install the most recent Catalina compatible Wacom software from their website --(This is what solved the problem for me)\n\n*Uninstall any Wacom drivers you may have installed on your system. Official instructions can be found here\n\n*\n\n*disconnect tablet from USB\n\n*Navigate to: Finder -> Applications -> Wacom table -> Wacom Tablet Utility\n\n*Click the 'Uninstall' button\n\n*Restart your machine\n\n*Find and delete all related folders as per the linked instructions\n\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nFinally, I'd like to acknowledge the multiple posts and pages that I have drawn on to find this solution. I can't take credit for any of the solutions posted here, I found them all in my efforts to fix my own frustrating problem. I hope that anyone experiencing this problem finds a solution in this answer.\n\nA: TLDR: Thoroughly scrub Wacom from your computer--there is a lot of scrubbing to do, so even/especially if you uninstalled it, read further! I'd uninstalled Wacom tablet driver some time ago, so of the possible causes, I doubted this was my issue. I decided I \"may as well\" check if it left any artifacts and clean them up anyway... then saw just what it had left. and I thought \"Oh my! this looks like stuff that could break your keyboard.\" then, slowly, \"oh god oh god I'm never letting Wacom touch me again. I must warn the others.\"\nStep 0: Uninstall the app, from within the app if possible.\nAs I mentioned, I had already uninstalled Wacom Tablet Driver. So I can't remember if the app has an \"uninstall\" function, or if I simply dragged it from Applications to Trash, the usual process on a Mac. It seems sociopathic to me to write software that leaves a mess like this without including a way to clean it up, but sloppy software is often sloppy in more than one way. Therefore, I recommend:\nCheck if the Wacom application includes \"Uninstall\" in the menu, and use it if available. Otherwise, put it in the trash, then permanently delete it. No matter which way you uninstalled it, complete steps 1 and 2.\nStep 1\nCheck that its accessibility permissions are gone. In the GUI: apple > System Preferences > Security and Privacy > Accessibility > Remove Wacom from program list.\nStep 2: Find and rm remnants\nIn Terminal:\nsudo su\nfind /Library -iname *wacom*\n\nI checked the folders ~, /Library, and /Applications (System/Volumes/Data might be worth checking too.) I found over 50 files including but not limited to\n/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/WacomTabletPlugin.plugin\n/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.wacom.TabletHelper.app\n/Library/Frameworks/WacomMultiTouch.framework\n/Library/Preferences/Tablet/Wacom App Specific Settings/ArtRage Studio Pro.wacomas (and many other programs I'd never used)\n.plist everywhere\n/Library/StagedExtensions/Library/Extensions/Wacom Tablet.kext\n/Library/Extensions/Wacom Tablet.kext\nSystem/Volumes/Data/private/var/folders/yt/957bjc4158l5_rfzsnmfwyqm0000gn/C/com.wacom.wacomtablet\n\nFor me, the problem seemed to get fixed by this filesystem cleanup very early on (something in ~/Library or /Library most likely.) It was memorable because it was happening to me at almost per-sentence frequency, but I could soon type commands without them repeating.\nStep 3 (or 2b?): How to delete kernel extensions\nNotice Library/Extensions/Wacom\\ Tablet.kext/ in step 2?

I have done full backups many times before: they have been slow, but not like this. Today's backup includes long stretches of no network activity, punctuated by brief – but small — bursts. \n\nThe progress bar declines to offer a prediction, but my estimate is about a week. \nI have rebooted, erased the Time Capsule (via AirPort Utility, not Disk Utility) twice and re-started. Apps like Music and Photos were closed anyway. Tried the throttle hack (https://www.imore.com/how-speed-your-time-machine-backups). Pored through dozens of outdated suggestions online.\nWhat finally got it rolling? Answer to follow.\n\nA: After about six hours of waiting for Godot, I tried this experiment: put the Mac to sleep (power not connected) and see if (still sloooow) backup proceeds while sleeping. It did not. (I let it sleep for a half hour, so the presence or absence of progress would be more apparent.) But... on re-awakening, the backup was more than 10x faster. \n\nAlso, I found that when power is connected, backup does continue while sleeping. (PowerNap feature, checkbox in System Preferences > Energy Saver panel.) So while both laptop and I were asleep, 90% of the backup completed.\nSolution? I don't know how general it is, and this is post-hoc reasoning, but my suggestion is: try putting your Mac to sleep for a while, with power disconnected. On awakening, it might just be 10x faster.\n", "Q: Desktop icon spacing - bigger gap on the left of desktop Why do the desktop icons on the left of the screen have a bigger gap than the icons on the right? I have set my desktop icons \"snap to grid\".\nIs there any way I can make it even?\nResetting Finder and changing grid spacing doesn't help.\nI'm using Mojave on MacBook Pro.\n\n\nA: The zero point (0|0) of the grid coordinate system is the upper right corner of the desktop (either with or without menubar - depends on your settings in System Preferences > General > Automatically hide and show menubar).\nWith a fixed grid size progressing to the left and the bottom of the desktop you usually will get gaps (=incomplete grid boxes) at the left and at the bottom.\nExample with your screenshot:\n\nEach box has a fixed size (pixel x pixel) depending on the grid spacing setting. The leftmost column is incomplete and the bottom row is overlapped by the dock. Both usually won't be used to place items in there.\nAFAIR Windows uses a relative grid size and a natural number (=positive integer) of tiles (in the x- and y-direction).\n\nAssuming the grid spacing is in pixel (or better some natural multiple), you can set it to a whole integer divisor of your monitor size. I think 60 will fit a lot of common sizes:\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Set :DesktopViewSettings:IconViewSettings:gridSpacing 60\" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist\n\nCheck the settings with:\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Print :DesktopViewSettings:IconViewSettings:gridSpacing\" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist\n\n", "Q: How can a malicious video get into my FaceTime call? Apple's recent update (10-Dec-2019) deals with fixing the following security issue:\n\nImpact: Processing malicious video via FaceTime may lead to arbitrary\n  code execution\n\nIf I call somebody via FaceTime video, how can a malicious video get into it? I mean, my video call is a video but it is not malicious. Where from does some other [malicious] video come?\n\nA: In cases like these, my presumption is always that the majority of the risk comes when someone is able to connect to you and send malicious data (in this case in the form of video) to you.\nSo, for example in this case, I would assume that the danger comes from someone who attempts to connect “via FaceTime” (meaning the FaceTime port and/or protocol) but not with the official FaceTime app. Instead they would use some nefarious tool which will attempt to overflow some buffer or otherwise send data that the FaceTime app on your device will not be able to handle.\n\nPersonally, I never use FaceTime on my Mac or iPad, so I log out of the FaceTime app on the Mac and iPad, which limits the “attack vector” to my iPhone. I do not do this primarily for increased security (although it is a nice side benefit). I do it because I don’t want all of my devices to “ring” for a FaceTime call, only my iPhone.\n", "Q: How to make and alias list from multiples results of a shell script? So this is the shell script that I have in my Applescript editor which brings up all of the videos that have been added to my computer today.\ndo shell script \"mdfind 'kMDItemDateAdded >= $time.today && kMDItemKind = *movie'\"\n\nI see four videos show up in the results section of the Appliscript editor. But I am having difficultly changing those results into an alias list and sending them into a folder called \"New Videos\".\nCan anybody show me how this is done? \n\nA: Let’s assume that your new videos folder is located on your desktop.  This AppleScript code does not create an alias list.  The list created will be Posix paths.\nproperty moveToFolder : POSIX path of ((path to desktop as text) & \"New Videos\" as alias)\n\nset fileList to do shell script \"mdfind 'kMDItemDateAdded >= $time.today && kMDItemKind = *movie'\"\n\nset fileList2 to paragraphs of fileList\n\nrepeat with thisMovie in fileList2\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        move disk item thisMovie to folder moveToFolder\n    end tell\nend repeat\n\n", "Q: macOS wastes RAM on Mac with 64Gb RAM Last week I've switched from my old Macbook 15\" 2014 16Gb to Macbook 16\" 64Gb. With my old mac I was quite comfortable to run Chrome, Lightroom, VSCode and even VM at the same time.\nA 2-day fresh Mac right after system restart consumes ~16Gb of RAM... It's not a file cache, it's apps memory which reserved and not available to other apps. No software installed, no apps in autorun, only Apple services.\nHere is the list of processes right after a system restart. \nWhy opendirectoryd is using 800Mb? I'm not even using Open Directory functionality. Why loginwindow requires 800Mb of memory? A corebrightnessd responsible for Night Shift functionality — 420Mb?\nWhat the hell is going on? Why a fresh system is wasting 16Gb(!!!) of RAM just for nothing? This RAM is enough to run several ram-hungry apps.\nCan we control that somehow using internal settings like sysctl?\n\nA: No - there’s not a sysctl to change this on macOS that I’m aware of. The first accommodation for server workloads is to enable more processes, but that won’t affect vm allocation or recompiling the frameworks.\nIf for some reason you are running more server workload and want to sacrifice a little single threaded performance to let lots of daemons run well - try enaBling performance mode for server and get Apple’s tuning for that workload.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202528\nI see this as efficient use of the RAM as there’s a long history of caching aggressively and loading frameworks off disk when referenced, then balancing later on macos:\n\n\n*\n\n*Isn't Inactive memory a waste of resources?\nTo convince yourself this is as designed, you could make a new user account, disable auto log in for any migrated accounts and get a clean restart. Per my comments, nothing looks to be drastically out of the design intent of macOS. If you wanted to dig deeper into your exact memory allocation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Grab a sysdiagnose from the brand new account\n\n*Grab a sysdiagnose from your account now and in a couple days once all the third party apps you have installed are updated / stable.\n\n*Push the kernel and virtual memory subsystem a bit with actual apps running - the system is going to throw RAM at anything since you have so much. I see this more froM the viewpoint that it’s wasteful to power 64 GB of RAM and not allocate it. \n\n\nThe system doesn’t need free RAM for anything except a new allocation.\nThere’s zero chance your Mac can’t allocate a ridiculous amount of RAM instantly in the above snapshot with >32 GB still free.\nThere a long history of expectations about memory management from perspectives of other OS / other kernels / and legitimate learning curves on macOS so I don’t doubt you’re worried a little, but we may need to get into an actual problem.\n", "Q: Mosquitto link troubleshooting  brew install mosquito\n\nReturns:\nWarning: mosquitto 1.6.8 is already installed, it's just not linked\nYou can use `brew link mosquitto` to link this version.\n\nLink attempt:\nUsers-MacBook-Air:~ user$ brew link mosquitto\nLinking /usr/local/Cellar/mosquitto/1.6.8... \nError: Could not symlink sbin/mosquitto\n/usr/local/sbin is not writable.\nUsers-MacBook-Air:~ user$ ls /usr/local/sbin\nls: /usr/local/sbin: No such file or directory\nUsers-MacBook-Air:~ user$ sudo brew link mosquitto\nPassword:\nError: Running Homebrew as root is extremely dangerous and no longer supported.\nAs Homebrew does not drop privileges on installation you would be giving all\nbuild scripts full access to your system.\nUsers-MacBook-Air:~ user$ mkdir /usr/local/sbin\nmkdir: /usr/local/sbin: Permission denied\n\nThe goal is to invoke mosquitto_sub.

You can download High Sierra by accessing the link on the Apple website How to upgrade to macOS High Sierra. After High Sierra finishes downloading, you will get the following popup message. You can click on Quit to exit the installer.\n\nTo install High Sierra, you will have to copy the installation files to a flash drive. See the Apple website How to create a bootable installer for macOS for instructions. Once booted from the High Sierra flash drive, you can install High Sierra in a new APFS volume.\n\nNote: The installation of High Sierra on my Mac consumed about 29 GB of space. If you are space limited, then you may have to temporarily move some of your personal files off of the installation drive.\n\nAfter finishing installing High Sierra, you can use the Boot Camp Assistant included with High Sierra to install Windows 7. \n\nNote: Apple documentations does state that the Windows 7 ISO should include Service Pack 1 (SP1). You can download a Windows 7 ISO with SP1 from the Microsoft website Download Windows 7 Disc Images (ISO Files).\n\nDuring use of the Boot Camp Assistant, you will encounter the following window. \n\nIf you click on Open Website, you will be directed to the website Install Windows 7 on your Mac using Boot Camp. You should follow the directions given on the website.\nAfter Windows 7 is installed, you can boot to Catalina and use the Disk Utility application to remove the High Sierra volume.\nSome Comments about 2015 and Newer Macs\nApple and Microsoft intended for Windows 7 to BIOS boot on Macs. The instructions given in this answer should install Windows 7 to BIOS boot. However, starting in 2015, Apple starting eliminating the ability for Macs to BIOS boot. This is why the links to download on the website Install Windows 7 on your Mac using Boot Camp end in 2014. In your case, you can either try installing Windows 7 without the Boot Camp Support Software (Window Support Software) or try the Windows Support Software that can be downloaded by using the Boot Camp Assistant.\nA Note about Windows 10\nIf you have a Windows 7 product key, then you may be able to use this product key to install and activate Windows 10 for free.

I've been having some issues ever since being pushed to switch to Zsh over Bash in macOS Catalina.  A lot of the issues seem to be surrounding commands not being recognized under certain circumstances.\nAs mentioned, the issue I'm currently having has to with with Atom editor and the shell commands that can be installed with it.  After downloading Atom and running the Install Shell Commands in the Atom menu, you should be able to launch Atom via the command line with the atom <file> command.  My issue is that, the command is not recognized at all until I manually the launch the application once.  If I try to use the command, I'm greeted with zsh: command not found: atom.  After the application is launched manually (outside of the command line), Zsh no longer reports that it cannot find the command atom command, and it begins to work.  This all resets as soon as I turn my computer off and on.\nDoes anyone know what could be causing this?  This never happened pre-Catalina.\n\nA: I am going to bypass what could be causing it, to tell you how to “cure” it.\nFirst, find out the exact path of “atom” (not Atom.app).  It is probably embedded somewhere inside of Atom.app, but it's possible the Install Shell Commands copies it to somewhere else.  \nIf it disappears on a reboot, it might be copied to /tmp (!).  If that is the case, do echo $path and copy it to one of those directories.\nAfter you have atom in a location that won't be erased on reboot, ensure that location is in your zsh $path as discussed in How does zsh find commands?\n", "Q: Resizing APFS container and partition I was tring to increaze the size of the Windows 10 Boot Camp partition with Disk Utility but I made a mess.

There is an icon at the top right (circled in red) that will switch you to the system character viewer. \n\nOnce you have switched to the character viewer, you can navigate and insert characters as you normally would, just as if you had opened it from the input sources menu. Happily, once you have switched from the emoji picker to the character viewer the system will remember this choice, so the next time you hit ⌘^␣ you will get the full character viewer instead of the emoji picker.\nIt doesn't address the missing input sources menu, but for the specific task of adding non-standard characters I find it to actually be faster. \nIf you happen to know the code points you can also enable the 'Unicode hex input' input source. You can't switch the via the input sources menu, but you can use ctrl-space (^␣) to switch between enabled input sources. With the unicode hex input source enabled, opt-xxxx where xxxx is the code point number will insert a character.\n", "Q: Is there any free iOS video player that allows you to transfer and keep a folder hierarchy intact? I have a video course folder that in turn has multiple folders (one for each chapter). I was using VLC on my ipad and found out that when I copy the parent folder to the device, it just copies all the files to a folder. ie removing all sub folders and adding ALL the videos in just one parent folder. \nI switched to infuse. Turns out you can have only 1 level of folder. ie. if you have a Parent Folder which has 10 sub folders. You will now have just 10 folders without parent.

Don’t even use VLC until you’re forced to. That being said, my Documents folder and dozens of music, video, pdf files all transfer perfectly from Mac to iCloud web interface to files on iPhone and iPad. VLC for iOS navigates this hierarchical storage perfectly so I’m guessing you are struggling to load your folders into VLC sandbox and not using the files app. \nPutting video files (or any files) in a specific app sandbox is really fighting against the grain. \n", "Q: Connect to a second computer at startup First, I'm sure this question has an answer somewhere, but I cannot find it.\nIs there a way for my main computer to connect to a backup computer on startup?

Why are my mom's contacts on my phone, and how do I delete them?\nWe have different iCloud accounts and different phone numbers and different email addresses.\nI need help on how to remove them from my phone without deleting them from her phone \n\nA: It appears if your device was previously used with you mom's iCloud account, and her contact information was not removed from the device before you signed in with your iCloud account. This will merge the contact data from both accounts. \nUnfortunately, there is no way to automatically detect which contacts were yours or which ones were your mom's.\nA simple solution is to manually delete all the contacts that do not belong to you. First, ensure that your phone is using your account for contacts, otherwise you will be deleting your mom's contacts on her iCloud account. Go to Settings > Your Name > iCloud > Contacts and check if Contacts is on and the account is yours. Then, open the contacts app and tap edit on the contact you would like to delete. Finally, scroll to the bottom and press Delete Contact then Delete Contact on the popup again.\nIf you happen to use Time Machine on a separate macOS device and use iCloud sync, you could try to recover your old contacts list, delete all your contacts, then re-import the original contacts from the Time Machine backup.\nTo prevent this from happening in the future (as I have done this many times myself on accident), make sure you completely erase your device before signing in with a new iCloud account.\n", "Q: Can I search images on Safari using a text in the text field on a third-party app using shortcut?

This is a low-tech question. I've been nursing a late 2012 MacBook Air which has been obsoleted by Apple. The folks who replaced my battery told me that they can't repair the mechanism that produces friction to hold the monitor at a fixed angle. It falls down unless I use something to hold it.\nWhen pressed, the only solution they could come up with is to buy a second, used laptop of the same model and swap the entire display.\nIs this really the way it is, or is there some way to tighten or replace the friction mechanism, or any clever hack beyond using string or some other object to hold it at an angle?  \nI can barely get it to remain stable at the exact vertical position, but can't type on it like that.\n\nA: Yes - this is eminently repairable and easy to diagnose remotely since you describe a typical and physical hinge clutch failure. \nThe good news is you can buy liquid damaged / logic board broken Macs that are vintage for very low cost and possibly know the screen assembly is fine by booting to recovery or just trusting the seller.\nSwapping the entire display is pretty easy but to get to it are numerous delicate and fragile connectors likely to break the rest of your mac if you’re not careful or have a helper to hold things. Also, you have to remove the battery, which can be bent / damaged and cause a fire risk.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Mac/MacBook-Air-13%22-Mid-2012/Screens\nThis also is a very easy repair for someone that does repairs professionally and they can source parts cheaper than you in most cases. They are right, you can’t just repair the hinges - you need an exceptionally strong press that costs far more to make than buying hundreds of displays.\nYou risk breaking the LVDS cable if there is a sharp piece broken, so short term you need to use it in closed clamshell mode with an external display and baby it while you decide if it’s worth $300 to fix.\n\nA: It is in most cases eminently possible and feasible to repair a loose hinge on a MacBook air 2012 in itself. The process to expose the raw hinges are not too hard. You need to remove the screen assembly, then the black plastic at the base of the screen assembly slides a few millimeter to the side and then comes off by lifting. Like this you have the hinges exposed. Often it is then a simple matter of tightening the three screws on each hinge as hard as you can to up the friction to where it should be (these screws can loosen over time by themselves), then assemble again. If one or both hinges are actually broken, that is when you need spare parts as indicated in another answer here.\n", "Q: How to delete a downloaded voice from Siri in iPhone5s I would like to delete a Siri voice that has taken up most of the remaining small space that i had left in my iPhone 5s.

App-specific passwords maintain a high level of security and help ensure your Apple ID password won’t be collected or stored by any third-party apps you use.\nWeb form Password:\nThese are passwords set by the site you are visiting, such as a bank for instance. They make the rules for their own site. Some do not allow your browser to remember for safety/security reasons. Others do allow it so you can set your browser to auto-fill those.\nInternet Password:\nThese are passwords provided by you to access the Internet while connecting through WiFi, configuring Proxy and others that is related to network on your system. \nKeeping track of passwords is hard, especially if you follow the best practice of never using the same password twice and have multiple devices. iCloud Keychain keeps website and Wi-Fi passwords up to date across your Mac, iOS devices, and iPadOS devices. It also keeps account passwords and settings that you add to Internet Accounts preferences up to date on your Mac. \nHow can I create a Keychain item of a specific kind?\nApps and servers may automatically create a keychain with a password for you when you create your account or log in, or they may offer you the option to have Keychain Access remember the password. It is the same for Internet passwords too as it is added automatically by creating a key chain under an appropriate group. \nYou need to deep dive a bit on Keychain properties if you want to create for Web Form password for your own tool. It would provide a bit idea if you look on this query too.\n\nA: Web form password: are the most common ones that you use, on websites accessed via browser Safari, or Safari interfaces brought up when some app demands it on iOS. \nInternet password: on my Mac seem to be the ones for proxy which I set up years ago and no longer use. System Preferences, Network, Wi-Fi, Advanced, proxy seem relevant here. \nApplication password: seem to be those used by apps internally on your Mac locally to keep your login active over time, for example WhatsApp, Spotify and some lesser known services like Xcode, news and Safari Extensions that need you to login. \n\nOn first glance, Web passwords are the easiest ones to create and Application Passwords are not directly accessible to user it seems. They might be working like access tokens which are of no use to the end user.  So changing types is no to beneficial. Others can highlight over this part.\n", "Q: Messages and FaceTime stuck with temporary number I recently changed my provider and got a new phone number, temporarily, while my old provider transferred it. During that brief period of about 48 hours, my Apple Account, Messages and FaceTime picked up on the change and set everything to the new number.\nNow I've got my old number back, I cannot seem to force Messages and FaceTime to pick up on the change back to my previous number. I have managed to add my old number back to my Apple Account and Trusted Number, but it insists on keeping that temporary number (which is now no longer in service) as the main contact for Messages and FaceTime, which subsequently appends it into my Apple Account.\nI managed to get the above to work by switching iMessage and FaceTime off, then logging out of my Apple Account, and switching off; finally turning everything back on again about 20 minutes later. However, this has no effect on the Messages/FaceTime choice of contacts, which is stuck with that temporary number.\nWhat's the trick to fix this?\n(iPhone 8; iOS 13.2.3)\n\nA: I managed to fix this by switching off Messages and FaceTime, removing the SIM, turning off, switching back on, reinserting the SIM and then manually tweaking the Apple Account contacts (removing the manually added number, which was a duplicate once the reinserted SIM was recognised).\nI don’t know which of the above steps are necessary and which are optional, but it seems to have worked for me!\n", "Q: How do I delete or show the size of a non-TimeMachine APFS snapshot tmutil not only stores Time Machine snapshots, but also snapshots for other applications.

However, I'm hesitant to delete and files from /tmp/snapshotbackup/ fearing I may thus delete (hardlinked) files from my regular disk (not likely, but I prefer to be cautious).\nSo I still have the question how can I determine the size this snapshot takes on my hard disk, and how can I delete it?\n\nA: I received a reply from the author of ChronoSync, and he helpfully explained the following option to manage snapshots.\nTo list snapshots:\ndiskutil apfs listSnapshots /\n\nTo delete snapshots:\ndiskutil apfs deleteSnapshot / -name <name_of_snapshot>\n\nThis seems the better option, which unfortunately doesn't seem listed elsewhere (all other guides I found only mention tmutil).\nI couldn't test, since I already deleted it with CCC.\n\nA: The only tool that I am aware of that will allow you to easily view / delete APFS snapshots is Carbon Copy Cloner.\nThe app is meant to clone your hard drive, but it also has an interface for viewing / deleting snapshots, as shown here:\n\nSelect your drive under “Volumes” on the left and the right column will populate with all of the snapshots (I don’t happen to have any non-Time Machine snapshots, but it will show those too).\n", "Q: iTerm2 does not take the focus with the hotkey window I have setup a new Mac with iTerm and the hotkey window shortcut (MacOS Catalina).\nIt all works well, except that the hotkey window does not take the focus when it opens.

How would it differentiate between not being in your seat because you left and not being in your seat because you have a standing desk?\nThe answer is it can’t.  \nThe closest you can get to automating the locking/unlocking of your based on your physical position is through proximity.  There’s an app called Near Lock that purports to achieve this, however, it requires an iPhone; it’s implied that you use an Android as you mention a Huawai smartwatch in your linked question.  \nFurther, you’re looking to automate something that by design should be a user interactive process.

Can someone tell me how to get them back?\nThanks.\n\nA: Carbon Copy Cloner makes a clone of one entire disk volume on another disk volume. In other words, it duplicates the source disk on another volume, replacing whatever was already there.\nA safer method would have been to use the drive as a Time Machine disk, which would then backup everything to the external drive, but keeping existing files in place.\nIf you can indeed recover all your files using Data recovery software, then you should go ahead with that. It is 'not easy' for you to do it yourself, as you would have to write code to read entire disk data blocks and work out where files begin and end (because they lack the catalog entry that the Finder can use to display files).\nIt is essential to have a second copy of every file that you want to keep, on another device, exactly to prevent situations like this.\n", "Q: Message from voicemail yet no missed call on iPhone 11?

One of my Macs is running Mac OS Mojave and so for parity with my Catalina machine I switched the shell to zsh. Not sure exactly when but at some point I noticed the current working directory was never being displayed either in the prompt itself or in the title of the tab.\nI found I way to restore the title to the prompt by adding this to my ~/.zprofile file: PROMPT='%~ '. However, I have not been able to restore the directory name to the tab title:\n\nThis is quite frustrating when dealing with multiple tabs, as I do daily. It would seem to me that everything in the Terminal's settings is correct:\n\nAm I missing something or have I encountered a strange bug?\n\nA: Solution: Copy the zsh setup files (/etc/zshrc and /etc/zshrc_Apple_Terminal) from a Catalina system to the older system (preferably after backing up the original equivalent(s)).\nI haven't tested this in Mojave, but I did in High Sierra, and it works fine there.\nExplanation of the problem: Setting the Terminal window/tab title requires running some code (e.g. a shell function) to send the appropriate escape sequences, encoded version of the directory name, etc to the Terminal. In older versions of macOS, this was handled in bash by having /etc/bashrc run /etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal, which defined a suitable function and set PROMPT_COMMAND to tell bash to run it each time it prompted for a new command. But since zsh wasn't the default shell, Apple didn't bother to create the equivalent setup scripts for zsh.\nIn Catalina, zsh is the default shell, so they wrote analogous setup steps and added them to /etc/zshrc and /etc/zshrc_Apple_Terminal. The mechanics are different (for example, zsh uses add-zsh-hook precmd instead of the PROMPT_COMMAND variable), but it does essentially the same thing. These files are not dependent on anything in Catalina; you can simply copy them to older systems, and they should work the same as they do in Catalina.\n", "Q: Books doesn't have a 'Show in Finder'? Books 2.2 on Catalina 10.5.2\nThere appears to be no more 'show in finder' option! How do I know where my books actually are on my hard drive?\n\nA: Turns out that Books on Catalina is a disaster. It moves all of your data from wherever you had it in iTunes (in my case an external drive) and puts it onto your internal drive. There is no interface to change the location (you can do it with a symbolic link created in terminal I believe).\nmv ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/Books/ /Volumes/SomeDrive/Books\nln -s /Volumes/SomeDrive/Books ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/Books/\n\nI have a new November 2019 MacBookPro, so I can't download to Mojave.\nFor more reading and complaining check the following link:\nhttps://macmost.com/forum/how-do-i-manage-my-audiobook-library-in-macos-catalina.html\n\nA: /Users/me/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/Books/498709973.epub\nTalking from Mojave, but searching EPUBs from Finder or say EasyFind can reveal them. \n\nA: I post this as a warning to everyone: if you add a symbolic link to your Audiobooks folder, there is the potential for massive, silent data loss.\nLearn from my suffering:\nI came to the same solution as Phil did on my own. On macOS 10.15.7, I had some .m4a files stored in the Music folder. I removed them from the Music.app interface and kept the files. In the Finder, I changed all of the extensions of those files to .m4b and dropped them into the Automatically Add folder. I forgot that I didn't have the correct drive (where my Audiobooks are stored) plugged in. Music.app tried to add those files to the Audiobooks folder, and when it couldn't find the drive, it silently deleted most (not all) of the files instead of putting them into the Not Added folder.\nAs far as I can tell, the files were not moved to a temporary location (/tmp, somewhere within the labyrinthine Books folder location, etc). They aren't in any other folder that I can find. I've used EasyFind to search the entire drive, including invisible files and packages, for anything with \".m4b\" in the name. Nothing. They're just gone.\nI'm so angry that I'm calm. The sheer idiocy of coding the app not only to silently fail but also to \"move\" those files into the ether rather than simply set them aside if the symbolic link fails is just beyond me.\nAnyway, if you set up an alias, do not ever, ever, ever open Books or Music (as the latter apparently can't be trusted either) without having the media drive attached. Apple apparently can't code anymore.\n", "Q: macOS Catalina blueoothd high CPU IOBluetoothBroadcomSchedulerWorkaround issue I've already spent many hours with this and I wasn't able to come up with a solution.

I've had it for a couple of weeks now and it has worked fine, until few days ago when it started to present really annoying WiFi issues. Approximately once per day the WiFi just disconnects and refuses to connect for a period of time. It is resolved after I repeatedly restart the computer. It's not an issue with the router or the connection as all the other devices in this household, as well as my previous computer which had no network problems. Even the auxiliary shared network connection from my iPhone can be difficult to establish. Are network issues something characteristic to these models? Is there any way to fix this? \n\nA: For \"mysterious\" wifi connection issues, I have a blanket method that I do with any client Mac that has them, and it solves the problem in about 80% of cases, and in the remaining 20% of cases it is hardware.\nSo try this: Go to the folder \n/Library/Prefecrences/SystemConfiguration/ \n\nand remove the following files:\ncom.apple.airport.preferences.plist\ncom.apple.network.eapolclient.configuration.plist\ncom.apple.smb.server.plist\ncom.apple.wifi.message-tracer.plist NetworkInterfaces.plist\npreferences.plist\n\nYou need admin to do this. Immediately after thrashing them, reboot. Removing these settings files will not 'mess' with your Mac in any, unless you have some very specific network setup you need to preserve, but doing so will in my experience solve many network hiccups.\nIf that doesn't help, one might suspect firmware or hardware problems. \n", "Q: Deleting (intrusive?)

So you can delete that folder using Finder (yay!) and see if it comes up again. It could be a good thing to save to protect you from tracking!\n\nA: All the ones in /System are Apple system files that handle integrating MacOS with FaceBook, rather than 'software' written by FaceBook. They certainly aren't going to steal any info from your Mac.\nIf you don't have a FaceBook account, then they will be unused (like many other system components that you're probably not using). \n\nA: Thank you all for your responses. As mentioned I can't delete any of these files no matter what I do, so I guess a clean reinstall of the OS will solve it - as long as I steer clear from using Facebook whatsoever and perhaps conducting a clean OS reinstall of iPhone and iPad too avoiding the FB app.\n", "Q: Encrypting a USB for use on Mac *and* Windows I have an external USB drive and I would like to encrypt it – preferably on Mac, however Windows is an option. The USB should be ready to use for both Windows and Mac without the use of third-party software. Using third-party software for formatting and/or encryption is not a problem.\nUsing Disk Utility, I can only format the drive to a non-encrypted FAT32 or ExFAT. Using another format makes the USB drive unreadable on Windows computers.\nI have already tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Formatted on Mac using Disk Utility to ExFAT. Encrypted using BitLocker on Windows. Result: works on Windows, does not work on Mac.\n\n*Formatted and encrypted on Mac using VeraCrypt. Result: works on Mac, does not work on Windows.\n\n\nAgain, when I mention that the drive 'does not work', it does not work in a plug-and-play kind of way.

At my desk I use my intel CPU 11\" MacBook Air with the lid closed, an external monitor with no camera, and a headset with microphone. After updating to Mojave from Sierra, I can no longer use FaceTime Audio in that configuration. I'm looking for a way to stop FaceTime from waiting for video from the inactive FaceTime camera.\nUnder Sierra, I could open the FaceTime app, and place or receive FaceTime Audio calls normally.\nNow, under Mojave, when I open FaceTime, the window is black, and after a minute or so, I get an alert saying \"No Video - FaceTime has not received any video from the connected camera. Restarting the computer may fix this issue.\" I'm not able to place calls, and restarting doesn't help. I'm still able to receive calls.\nI can plug in an old USB webcam, but I'd rather not, because I don't want video, it seems to use a significant amount of CPU, uses a USB port, etc.\nI might be willing to change my OS to Catalina if that would solve it, but my computer doesn't support any OS newer than that.\nAre there solutions I can use to make this work without having to  keep the lid open or plug in a camera?\n\nA: Here's a solution which works for macOS >= 10.14. One can initiate a call in Messages by clicking on details in a chat history and then on the phone symbol.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/messages/icht1091/mac\n\nA: This is something that has both dogged and annoyed me for several major releases of macOS. I have had Macbook Pros and Mac Minis for a number of years, running in clamshell mode (Mac Minis, simply without a camera). I use FaceTime Continuity iPhone Cellular Calling, daily, in my business. Apple states it supports FaceTime for making and receiving either audio or video calls, in its own documentation. It also gives the availability of a camera as a prerequisite only if you want to make/receive video calls.\nFurther details on system requirements, here: https://support.apple.com/e... and here: https://support.apple.com/e...\nHowever, over at least the last five years, following each update to the newest major release of macOS, I have lost the ability to use FaceTime because it tells me \"No Camera Available. To use FaceTime, turn on the camera.\" Then, normally after months of living with this (undocking the laptop and opening it, or grabbing a webcam and plugging it in, so FaceTime can detect the camera and start working, each time I launch it), Apple seems to fix the issue and FaceTime works happily, without needing to detect the camera. But only until the next major update.\nWhen I moved to Big Sur, I was having to do the workaround, opening the laptop lid, until Apple released an update (couldn't tell you which one), after which FaceTime worked without complaint. I recently moved to Monterey, 12.1 and I'm back with FaceTime complaining about no camera.\nWith all the major software producers slashing budgets, normally starting with QA, we are all doomed to a Groundhog Day existence of needless software bugs reappearing, as this is clearly an example of.\nCurrent System info:\nMacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017)\n2.9 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7\nmacOS Monterey 12.1 (21C52)\n\nA: You could try using a virtual camera, i.e. an application that passes on a video image as if it came from a webcam (e.g. OBS). Out of the box this will not work, as FaceTime does not support virtual cameras.\nHowever, you could try a workaround where you disable SIP. This Github issue comment mentions that this made it work for them.\nIn the same thread, this comment indicates that:\n\n...cloning PhotoBooth allows me to use the Virtual Cam but on Facetime it just shows a blank screen. This is on Monterey 12.0.1.\n\nThis would indicate that you could at least use FaceTime, albeit with a blank image instead of the actual video.\n", "Q: How do I remove a certificate from Certificate Trust Settings if the profile doesn't exist? If I go to Settings > General > About > Certificate Trust Settings... I see several profiles installed under the \"ENABLE FULL TRUST FOR ROOT CERTIFICATES\" heading.\nThere is a way to toggle them off, but not disable them.\nAccording to this website, it says that you can remove these certificates by navigating to Settings > General > Profiles. When I navigate there, I don't see any corresponding Profiles that are installed. They seem to have been deleted a while ago, yet the Certificates remain under Certificate Trust Settings.\nAnother site recommends to re-install the profile temporarily and then remove it. However, the profile is long gone and I don't know where to get it from.\nHow do I remove these certificates that don't have corresponding profiles on my phone?\n\nA: I'm on iOS 13.3. I tested this using non-orphaned certificates in hopes of isolating the issue to see what is the minimum option you can use to remove these certificates.\nWorks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Assuming you have the profile (i.e. non-orphaned): Settings > Profile > (Profile) > Remove\n\n*Nuclear option (deleting everything on your phone): Settings > General > Reset > Erase all content and settings\n\n\nDoesn't work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings > General > Reset > Reset network settings\n\n*Settings > General > Reset > Reset all settings\n\n", "Q: web request failures in curl I have a macbook pro running Catalina 10.15.1.

Try disabling IPv6 locally.\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Network  > TCP/IP > Change Configure IPv6 to Link-local only.\n\n*If you have access to the router, try disabling IPv6 network. If that solves the issue, then there's a misconfiguration on router.\n\n*After you found the cause, fix it and enable firewalls and anti-virus programs.\n\n\nA: There are two options that you can try;\nFirst, try to run this command\nexport HOMEBREW_FORCE_BREWED_CURL=1\n\nAnd second, run the following command from your terminal:\nnetworksetup -setv6off Wi-Fi\n\nReboot the machine and check it.\n", "Q: 2017 MacBook Pro kernel panics when it sleeps after update to Catalina After I update to Catalina (10.15.2), the system will freeze when I plug the USB keyboard to the Macbook.\nI ran the Hardware check, but there is no thing broken and I also had tried  to rest the SMC.

But I am having difficulty telling the script that there are images in the same folder that already have the same name.\nFor example, I have three images of a cat that are named Hello World 1, Hello World 2 and Hello World 3. \nIn the same folder I also have three more of the same image but with the name Test Image 1, Test Image 2 and Test Image 3.\n\nI want to rename all of the \"Test Images\" to Hello World 4, Hello World 5 and Hello World 6 but I get the following error:\n\nerror \"Finder got an error: The operation can’t be completed because\n  there is already an item with that name.\" number -48\n\nHow do I tell the script that there are other images in this folder that have the same name and that it needs to start from \"Hello World 4\" and continue renaming the rest of the images?\nPlease note that I will be using this as an embedded script in an application called Hazel (noodlesoft.com) and it does not accept handlers. So I will need a solution that does not use a handler.\nHere is the script I am using that gives me the error when I try to rename the \"Test Images\":\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set all_files to every item of (choose file with prompt \"Choose the Files you'd like to rename:\" with multiple selections allowed) as list\n    set new_name to \"Hello World\"\n    repeat with index from 1 to the count of all_files\n        set this_file to item index of all_files\n        set {itemName, itemExtension} to {name, name extension} of this_file\n        set index_prefix to \" \"\n        if itemExtension is \"\" then\n            set file_extension to \"\"\n        else\n            set file_extension to \".\" & itemExtension\n        end if\n        set the name of this_file to new_name & index_prefix & index & file_extension as string\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\n\nA: The main problem is similar to your other topic - the new name + suffix is not checked against what is already in the folder.  My answer to that topic used a general-purpose handler for getting a new name, so without using that, the (stripped down) contents are used instead:\nset all_files to (choose file with prompt \"Choose the Files you'd like to rename:\" with multiple selections allowed)\nset theName to \"Hello World \" -- includes separator text\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set theFolder to container of first item of all_files -- the base folder\n    repeat with this_file in all_files\n        set theExtension to name extension of this_file -- keep existing extension\n        if theExtension is not \"\" then set theExtension to \".\" & theExtension\n        if name of this_file does not start with theName then -- don't rename renamed items\n\n            # the \"increment suffix number until the name is unique\" part\n            set counter to 1 -- starting suffix\n            set newName to theName & counter & theExtension\n            tell (get name of items of theFolder) to repeat while it contains newName -- get new name\n                set counter to counter + 1\n                set newName to theName & counter & theExtension\n            end repeat\n\n            set name of this_file to newName\n        end if\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\n\nA: One way would be to check for the existence of the files before you attempt the rename. Write a loop.  Start where your default start file name would be.  Run the names until find an untaken name. \nIt's harder than it should be to find out if a file exists or does not exist. This routine while long has worked for me.  To avoid this handler, copy the code into your check loop.:\n-- ------------------------------------------------------  \n(*\n  ideas from:\n  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3469389/applescript-testing-for-file-existence\n\n\n use the alias way.

I'd like to reinstall its MacOS, however, when I reinstall it, it takes me to \"enrollment server\". I guess I need to either take it to my company or somehow connect with VPN. But, Is there a way to bypass that?\n\nA: No, you shouldn't bypass the Enrollment Server option. I am pretty sure it is related to the MDM setup that you have in your iMac from the company. \nOnce your company's MDM is connected with Apple Business Manager of your company, it rollout Enrollment in the beginning once it hits the internet. \nYour IT department must have something like this that enroll your devices to MDM. \n\nEither your IT admin can give you the password if needed else, it should enroll in the company server without authentication once you hit the internet. Better to reach out to your IT department in this context. \nI suggest not to look around to bypass as it is an MDM tool for inventory from your company with company policy. \n", "Q: How to disable auto-capitalization in Apple Mail app (really impossible?)

I understand apple's move from bash to zsh, though I'd really rather that they hadn't made the change.\nI've tried zsh, and decided that I'd prefer to remain with bash.\nSo, since MacOS Catalina isn't using /bin/bash any more, am I going to run into any problems if I replace it with the new version? (  3.2.57 with 5.0.3 ).\nI wouldn't have thought of doing this before, because it would have been quite possible that some part of the OS relied on a feature that had changed in new versions.\nNow, though, that /bin/bash isn't officially used, can we change it?\nIf so, that would be a really positive side-effect of the move to zsh. We can keep our user accounts compatible with out linux accounts, all using zsh, and keep the latest version running on all our machines, without having any danger of a conflict with the OS.\n\nA: You can install the latest bash via homebrew. There is already a guide on how to install it via homebrew.\nInstall brew via:\n/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\nAfter installing fetch the latest version of bash via brew. \nUsage:\n$ brew install bash installs the latest version of bash.\nBinaries in /{,usr/}{,s}bin/ should not usually be replaced with other files.

There may be differences between the old and new versions that require script modification.\n\nA: You can't easily (and shouldn't) change/upgrade /bin/bash.

It can of course remove all files, and copy all files from the first drive, but since I have multiple TB data, it will not be efficient. And most of the time, I will have not so many changes anyway. \n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: \nI've just bought another 5TB external disk (Seagate backup plus portable), where I always would like to have a 1-1 copy of the whole date from the first disk.\n\nIt’s not a sound strategy to back up a backup.\nI write about this in much more detail in another related answer, but to summarize here, you should have distinct backup jobs, not copies of existing backups.\nHaving an “identical copy” of a drive is good for redundancy and the correct tool for that job would be a product that implements RAID where the drives are mirrored.  Manually (meaning non-RAID) syncing drives falls short of being a good backup solution because if there are issues with the original backup (i.e. file corruption), the same issue is replicated to the other drive making the backup useless.\nSyncing is a tool best used when you need to have files accessible in/from different locations and are typically not being simultaneously accessed (changed).\nWhat you should do with your current setup is continue to use the MyBook for your daily backup and then create a new backup job that does a differential (only what has changed) backup when you plug in the Seagate.\n\nA: You are looking for a file syncing app. There are many to choose from. \nChronosync and SuperDuper, are apps that I have used for different purposes, but there are many others.\nPS: Answer me this: if you accidentally delete a file on your 1st external, and then the 2nd drive synchronizes and deletes the file: how will you recover that file?\n\nA: You could do it yourself with rsync but if you want a better, more Mac-like / GUI experience, I’d recommend Carbon Copy Cloner.\nIt will only copy over the files which have changed, and it can be set to sync whenever a disk appears, or it can manage mounting and unmounting the second drive on a schedule. I’d have it set to run at like 1:00 a.m. so as to not use system resources while I am using the computer.\nI also own ChronoSync and SuperDuper, but I think CCC is the best / easiest tool for the job.

I want the number to \nkeep on ringing without being answered, or if they must hear a message then \nfor the message to tell them the phone is switched off and that's it.\nRecently I got a text message from Three itself saying they'd left me a \nvoicemail, and I would like to delete that voicemail without setting up \nvoicemail in the first place.\nIn short, I would like to kill the voicemail facility, deleting whatever \nmay be in the box, without even listening to it and without setting up \nvoicemail in the first place. How can I do this? If to kill it properly I need to set it up first and then kill it, how do I achieve that?\n\nA: Step 1: Go to your home screen and tap on the keypad icon at the bottom.\nStep 2: Once the keypad is launched, type ##002# and then click on the Call button. There is no cause for worry since the iPhone will not actually make the call, but will display the settings of your voicemail.\n\nStep 3: You will be presented with three different messages\n\n\n*\n\n*Voice Call Forwarding\n\n*Data Call Forwarding\n\n*Fax Call forwarding.\n\n\nDo not do anything, but simply tap on the “Dismiss” tab at the bottom of the screen. You will have successfully disabled your voicemail for all types of calls.\n", "Q: Map Option to Alt instead of Alt Gr I've connected an external keyboard to my MacBook Pro. It's a Windows keyboard, but I'd rather not re-learn the swapped order of the Windows/Alt keys (vs. Option/Command keys). So I went to System Preferences, Keyboard, Modifier Keys… and swapped them:\n\nSo far, so good. But \"Option\" isn't really interpreted as \"Alt\" here Both in VMware Fusion and in Royal TS, the Windows key on the left and the menu(?) key on the right now do what appears to be Alt Gr, with various subtle but annoying differences in Windows, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*the alt-tab switcher is now sticky. You have to explicitly confirm with enter\n\n*some letters like alt-o now produce special characters\nkeyboard mnemonic (underlined menu items) do not work at all\n\n*Even though VMware Fusion does offer numerous remapping options, I couldn't figure it out. This trick works. However, that seems hacky and would also need to be applied to every single remote desktop in Royal TS. Not great.\n\n\nI'd much rather solve this on the Mac side. If I turn the mapping off, Alt does get sent as Alt, so why does swapping the two change it to Alt Gr at all?\n\nA: It looks like Karabiner-Elements is what I'm looking for.\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/281437/9422 has been quite helpful. So far, this mapping appears to do what I'd expect (unlike Apple's):\n\n", "Q: How can I run a command which will not survive terminal close?

It will connect to the router, but there’s no actual internet access and sometimes will say “can not obtain IP address”. I pulled up the network details on my computer and Xbox that both connect without a problem and I noticed that the subnet mask on my iPhone will show 255.255.0 rather than 255.255.255.0. What does this mean or what is it telling me? \nI have tried setting up static IP addresses as well, but this subnet mask issue still happens each time. \n\nA: Reset network settings on the iPhone\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings.\n\n*Tap General.\n\n*Scroll down to and tap on Reset.\n\n*Choose the option to Reset network settings.\n\n*If prompted, enter your passcode to proceed.\n\n*Then tap the option to confirm that you want to reset network settings on your iPhone.\n\n\nWhen the reset is finished, your iPhone should restart on its own and then loads up the original network configurations. Don’t forget to reconnect to your Wi-Fi network to get back online and use online services.\n", "Q: How to find which shared library is missing? When I use ldd on Linux it tells me right away if something is missing, i.e.\nldd -d some_lib.so\n    libexample.so => not found\n    libex.2.so => not found\n    libm.so.6 => /lib/libm.so.6 (0xf5860000)\n    libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0xf785b000)\n    libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0xf78a9000)\n    /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x46b4c000)\n\nOn Mac OS there is no ldd and people recommend using otool -L, but that shows which shared libraries are expected, not weather or not they are there. Another approach would be to use dtruss, but it requires sudo, and it least in my experience the application behaves very differently when it is being dtrussed, and it fails for an entirely different reason (and before it gets to trying to load the troublesome .dylib).\nSo if you suspect that a shared library is missing, what is the standard approach to finding which one it is on the Mac?\n\nA: The easiest way is simply to run the program. If the shared library is missing, you'll get an output similar to this:\ndyld: Library not loaded: mylib.dylib\n  Referenced from: /path/to/myprogram\n  Reason: image not found\nAbort trap: 6\n\nYou can also run the following command:\nobjdump -r --dylibs-used /path/to/myprogram\n\nThis will essentially give you the same output as the otool command, you've mentioned in your question (many years ago, Apple replaced the old toolchain with a llvm based one, so otool on recent macOS versions will just call objdump). The program lists the shared libraries that the program expects - you can then check manually if you actually have those files. I.e. is there a file in that path with that name, is it readable by your user and does it contain a valid dynamic library.\n\nA: The dynamic link editor dyld prints all dylibs loaded\nif you export (sh) ot setenv (csh)\nthese variables:\nexport DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES=1\nexport DYLD_PRINT_RPATHS=1\nexport DYLD_PRINT_TO_FILE=dyld.log\nmyprogram\n\nHere's an example dyld.log; otool -L the last \"unloaded\" lib\nto see what it wants to link to.\n...\ndyld: loaded: /opt/local/mac/big/py3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/scikits/umfpack/__umfpack.cpython-37m-darwin.so\ndyld: loaded: /opt/local/mac/big/SuiteSparse/lib/libumfpack.5.7.8.dylib\ndyld: unloaded: /opt/local/mac/big/py3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/scikits/umfpack/__umfpack.cpython-37m-darwin.so\n\nThe manual page man dyld lists dozens more switches.\nThere oughta be a better way ...\n", "Q: iPad USB-C Internet Connection: Tethering to Macbook I have an iPad Pro (2018 3rd Gen) with a USB-C Port and a 2018 Macbook Pro with a USB-C Port. Can I tether the iPad to my Macbook's Internet connection using a USB-C cable?\n\nA: Yes, you can use a USB-C cable to share Macbook's Internet connection with the iPad just like the USB to lightning cable does on iPhones and older iPads. \nBenefits:\n\n\n*\n\n*The USB-C cable powers the iPad directly from the Macbook reducing the number of mains sockets you need to just one.\n\n*WiFi & Bluetooth can be completely turned off on the iPad.\n\n*Traffic is proxied to the iPad via the Macbook (which has a firewall in front of it).\nNegatives:\n\n\n*\n\n*Airdrop and Sidecar will not work with your wireless interfaces down.\n\n\nParts Required:\n\n\n*\n\n*Standard USB-C charging cable that came with your iPad will work\n\n*Or this short (and tidy) Anker USB-C cable I've found works well\nInternet Connection:\nYou Macbook should have a non-802.1x Internet connection to share, ie: straight WiFi.

increasingly more now), when I wake my computer from sleep, the touch bar does not wake up. It doesn’t light up or react to touches — it’s just a piece of black plastic. This is usually fixed by a restart, but when my computer goes to sleep again it’s a crap shoot of whether the touch bar will wake back up again. It’s getting really annoying to have to restart my computer after almost every time I wake it from sleep, especially just to access essential controls like volume and brightness.\nHere are some things I’ve tried that didn’t work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Force-quitting the TouchBarServer from the Activity Monitor\n\n*sudo pkill TouchBarServer\n\n*pkill \"Touch Bar agent\"\n\n*Resetting the SMC (shutting down, holding power button for 10 seconds until the fans spin, and then booting up again)\n\n\nOne thing I did notice is that the touch bar turns back on when I log out of my account or switch accounts, and when I log back in to my account again, the touch bar turns back off. This is really weird because I can’t think of a reason why this would be related to my user account. I haven’t tried deleting my account and creating a new one, because that’s a lot of work and I’m not sure it would even fix the problem. But I would be willing to do that if I knew it would definitely fix it.\nI tried searching online but found nothing; it seems the community hasn’t come across this problem yet. Is this likely a common problem with new MBPs or Catalina, or is it just the luck of a draw with my machine?\n\nA: I recommend you to reset NVRAM of your MBP. \nThis chip stores information on screen resolution and can often become corrupted. You can reset it by starting your Mac while holding down cmd + opt + P + R . You should hear the Mac chime, restart and chime a second time. Then you can release the keys you are holding. \nMore info here.\n", "Q: Correct settings to record computer audio with Garageband, internal mic and ishowYouAudio I have the following aggregate device to record audio on the computer however I am sometimes getting some very bad feedback buzzing noise can be heard in this podcast episode. \nhttps://cafe.simplecast.com/episodes/fazale-rana at 41:30\nWhat are the correct settings and clock source but I need get the audio?\nI currently am using this: \n\nI also tried this but I still get the buzzing noise\n\nperhaps my issues lie with the output?\n\n\nA: I believe the problem you are experiencing is caused by the computer CPU receiving to many command redirects. This delays the audio from being cached (stored) in the buffer at the proper time to be outputted. The lack of momentary audio data (samples) results in the static or clicking sounds.\nProof test 1: Does this problem occur when the laptop is cold and just turned on? If no, then this is the problem.\nIs short you are asking the computer to do too much and as time passes the accumulative effect plus with the computer running warmer/hotter it will start to experience audio problems.\nYou will note that the problems first starts with your onboard microphone. Yet, the guest input remains normal with no problems.\nResolution 1: Poor-Maybe the computer is throttling back on the CPU because of excess heat. Do what you can to reduce the computers operating temperature.\nResolution 2: Increase the cache buffer size in iShowU. I am unfamiliar with this and a quick review did not lead to this being a possible alternative or not. This will create a delay in the signal. Find a happy medium if this option is available in your iShowU audio preferences.\nResolution 3: Flushing the RAM sometimes works. I use the free version of this \"Memory Clean 2 (Direct Version)\" and flush the RAM when static starts.\nResolution 4: Try using a different (light weight) browser.\nResolution 5: Amazon search this: Focusrite Scarlett Solo (3rd Gen) USB Audio Interface with Pro Tools | First. Then you need a XLR (balanced) microphone (no USB). This will be a $200 setup. You can use Pro Tools |First if you want as an alternate recording device. \nI experienced the same problems over a decade back. It doesn't matter how powerful your CPU is or how much RAM you have. This problem is not cause by the lack of either, it is a data flow problem. An external audio interface plus a XLR (balanced) microphone is a solid start to removing audio problems.\nI noticed your voice needs a compressor on it to enhance the clarity of your speech. If you use the Pro Tools | First (free) included I believe it comes with a compressor as well as other virtual audio hardware (EQ & etc)you will adopt for your productions.\n", "Q: External Flashdrive Won't Mount on Mac I formatted it as a boot drive, and it worked. But now, my Mac reads it as only being 2.4 MB rather than 124 GB, but it recognizes that the drive is 124 GB when trying to partition, although I can't partition, since the drive won't mount in the first place.\n\nA: I put the flash drive in a computer running Windows 10. I discovered it had an EFI disk partition after seeing the EFI folder through File Explorer, and I realized that that was the thing that was not allowing the drive to work on my Mac. I was unable to delete that partition through Disk Management, since Disk Management won't allow you to modify or delete EFI disk partitions, so I had to use Diskpart. I right clicked the Command Prompt to run it as an administrator. Once it opened, I typed in diskpart, and hit enter. I looked over at the Disk Management tab to see which disk it was. I then typed in select disk 1, and hit enter. After that, I typed in list disk, and hit enter to make sure I selected the right disk, since there's an asterisk to the left of the selected disk. Once I saw I selected the correct disk, I typed in clear, and hit enter. It didn't work the first time, so I waited a minute, and typed in clear again, and it worked the second time. I then went into Disk Management, and initialized the drive as an exFAT drive, since NTFS doesn't work on Mac without some sort of special program. It now works perfectly fine on my Mac.\n", "Q: Can I install a custom OS on iPhone 5s? I got myself an owned iPhone 5s to have some fun. Today I got extra adventurous and would like to try some \"unofficial\" operating systems like Android and postmarketOS. Unfortunately, a quick search with Google didn't give me much information.\n\nA: Is there an easy switch to jailbreak iPhone 5 that’s documented here - not yet. \nMay you find a crack or Apple key to sign whatever code you want. Of course, any hardware system could have cracks. \nCan you do it? Depends on your skill and research ability and time you devote to the exercise. \n\nA: I know this is an old thread but for anyone looking you are able to install Android on iPhones now thanks to Project Sandcastle.\nMore info can be found here\n", "Q: How can I check if iPhone has been manipulated or compromised firmware? I would like to buy a secondhand or refurbished iPhone 7 or newer. Since I am not watching anything regarding the hacker's scene, I am not up-to-date. Is any newer version of the iPhone hacked? Is it possible to manipulate iPhone firmware? \n\nA: Typically these modifications are not sustained beyond reboot. The ones that were are called ‘untethered’ and the last one im aware of that was 9.3.4. If the iOS version is beyond that it would almost certainly have to be of the ‘tethered’ variety and simply rebooting the phone should disable any such modifications\nAdditionally if there is a newer iOS version available to update, doing so will break any access to the files required to remodify the phone in the future and new files will be required to redo the process at that point.\n", "Q: crashes after sleep in the last few weeks I Have had multiple crashes a day after the Mac goes to sleep.\nhere is the log\nzeltak@imbp-50:~|⇒  log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains \"Previous shutdown cause\"' --last 24h\n\nFiltering the log data using \"composedMessage CONTAINS \"Previous shutdown cause\"\"\nSkipping info and debug messages, pass --info and/or --debug to include.\nTimestamp                       Thread     Type        Activity             PID    TTL\n2019-12-19 16:35:42.924903-0500 0xbc       Default     0x0                  0      0    kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: -20\n2019-12-19 19:26:36.824995-0500 0x1919     Default     0x0                  0      0    kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 5\n2019-12-19 20:20:46.794533-0500 0x1c80     Default     0x0                  0      0    kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 5\n2019-12-19 20:26:11.649020-0500 0x1ebf     Default     0x0                  0      0    kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 5\n2019-12-19 21:20:20.630227-0500 0x20b2     Default     0x0                  0      0    kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 5\n2019-12-19 22:14:27.574007-0500 0x22a7     Default     0x0                  0      0    kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 5\n2019-12-19 22:19:51.495891-0500 0x22a7     Default     0x0                  0      0    kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 5\n2019-12-19 23:14:00.490561-0500 0x22a7     Default     0x0                  0      0    kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 5\n2019-12-20 00:08:06.470641-0500 0x282e     Default     0x0                  0      0    kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 5\n2019-12-20 01:02:15.395498-0500 0x282e     Default     0x0                  0      0    kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 5\n2019-12-20 01:56:25.387258-0500 0x2c8f     Default     0x0                  0      0    kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 5\n2019-12-20 02:50:35.362751-0500 0x2e80     Default     0x0                  0      0    kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 5\n2019-12-20 03:44:46.298714-0500 0x334b     Default     0x0                  0      0    kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 5\n2019-12-20 04:37:41.253859-0500 0x34e5     Default     0x0                  0      0    kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 5\n2019-12-20 07:00:04.159349-0500 0x3502     Default     0x0                  0      0    kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 5\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLog      - Default:         15, Info:                0, Debug:             0, Error:          0, Fault:          0\nActivity - Create:           0, Transition:          0, Actions:           0\nze\n\nim using a 2018 MBP, with latest Catalina 10.15.3\nin new to the Mac, can anyone help me decipher the log?\n\nA: In your case, Shutdown 5 is a normal shutdown. \nSo regarding Shutdown -20, \nStart up in safe mode\n\n\n*\n\n*Start or restart your Mac, then immediately press and hold the Shift key. \n\n*The Apple logo appears on your display. \n\n*Release the Shift key when you see the login window. \n\n*If your startup disk is encrypted with FileVault, you might be asked to log in twice: once to unlock the startup disk, and again to log in to the Finder.\n\n*To leave safe mode, restart your Mac without pressing any keys during startup.\n\n\nCheck after this whether the issue persists or not.

I remember in the past, we can double click the \"highlighting icon\" and make it a highlighting mode, so whatever we select in the PDF document, it'd be highlighted permanently.

I may just be missing the right terminology, spreadsheets have never really been my thing.  But I'm struggling to combine SUM() and VLOOKUP() for my needs.  (Assuming these are even the functions I want to use, there could be something better that I'm just not noticing.)\nGiven a lookup table of Customers, for example:\nName  |  Miles from Office\n--------------------------\nBob   |  3.4\nJoe   |  9.1\nTom   |  2.9\n\nAnd a table of Transactions, for example:\nDate     | Customer | Amount\n----------------------------\n1/1/2019 | Bob      | $1.23\n2/1/2019 | Tom      | $2.34\n3/1/2019 | Bob      | $3.45\n4/1/2019 | Bob      | $4.56\n5/1/2019 | Joe      | $5.67\n\nHow can I get a sum of \"Miles\" for the transactions?  For any given transaction I could do:\n=VLOOKUP(\"Bob\", 'Customers'::A2:B4, 2)\n\nAnd that would successfully return 3.4.  But if I were to wrap that expression in a SUM() then how would I get it to run the VLOOKUP() on each item in the range being summed?  I tried:\n=SUM(VLOOKUP('Transactions'::B2:B6, 'Customers'::A2:B4, 2))\n\nWhich I didn't think would work (but was worth a try), and indeed it didn't and just returned the first value, in this case 3.4.\n(Specifically using Numbers in iCloud in my browser, if that makes a difference.)\n\nA: Create another column in Transactions. Put the VLOOKUP in that column. So then you have the miles for each one: 3.4, 2.9, 3.4, 3.4, 9.1. Then in another cell, use SUM(D2:D6) to add those up.

I live in Bahrain:\nCrucial 16GB Kit (8GBx2) DDR4 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) 260-Pin SODIMM Memory - CT2K8G4SFS824A\n\nA: Apple has a support document explaining this, see https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201191#27inch2017 for your model:\n\n\nA: Crucial has a compatibility chart here:\nhttps://content.crucial.com/content/dam/crucial/dram-products/mac/flyer/crucial-memory-for-mac-systems-compatibility-chart.pdf\nAccording to their chart, you can install the PC4-2400, or the faster PC4-2666.  I assume it would slow the 2666 to 2400, but get whatever is cheaper.  You could then potentially move the RAM to a newer machine later.\n\n", "Q: Sync photo albums between Mac and iPhone I am having this problem already a few months now and I wonder why there isn't any solution for it because it belongs to the basics of photos. I am talking about photo albums. And by a photo album I don't mean my whole photo library, I mean albums which I create on my iPhone with titles like New York, Los Angeles or Europe Trip which contain only selected photos I took. That's a photo album. So, I can have many photo albums within my photo library.\nApple simply doesn't support to sync those photo albums. I do have an Apple MacBook Pro and sync my photos between the iPhone and the MacBook with the Photos app provided by Apple. However, whenever I do this, I just have all the photos on my MacBook but not the albums. That is so annyoing because it just doesn't make sense to me... Also, I want to have this working in both directions.\nDo you guys know if this is possible and if yes, how?\n\nA: There are two basic ways to do this. You can use iCloud for storing pictures and then also use it for pictures on your Mac.\nThe other way is when you connect your phone to your Mac with a lightning cable. Then you can go in iTunes and go to the phone setting and sync options where it will ask you what do you want to sync there would be multiple tabs pictures would be one of them. (You will have to turn off iCloud for this.)\nIf you are on macOS Catalina then you can connect your phone go to Finder. Go to your phone, and change tabs to pictures and check the sync option. Then go back to the general tab and then click sync, it will take some time but you should be able to do it.\nThis video from Apple should help you\n", "Q: Set up VNC to use iPad Pro with Apple Pencil as a graphics tablet I work with photoshop in my Macbook Air.

Everything worked, except that I can't boot when on battery. The battery itself is fine, so I can connect the charger, press the start button, and it starts. I can then disconnect the charger, and it will keep running. But without the charger, it will just not recognize the power button press.\nI tried resetting the SMC (Shift+Ctrl+Option+Power Button), and resetting the PRAM (Cmd+Option+P+R like 5 times), but nothing changed.\nAny ideas?\nUpdate: Now it won't turn on even with the battery inserted, and it also does only charge if I try several times to connect the magsafe adapter\n\nA: I have finally found a fix:\nI left it overnight on the charger, sitting at a green light (100% charge). Apprently, that does a battery recalibration. Then, I was able to boot it from battery using the bootup pads on the mainboard. After then also cleaning of the keyboard connector (only like 3 keys were working) with isopropyl alcohol and some scrubbing, it finally worked.\n", "Q: Can't update or uninstall iTunes for Windows Whenever I try to uninstall or update iTunes on my Windows computer, it just says:\nThe feature you are trying to use is on a network resource that is unavailable.\n\nClick OK to try again, or enter an alternate path to a folder containing the installation package 'iTunes64.msi' in the box below.\n\nI searched everywhere for an iTunes 64.msi file, and can not find it.

Dark Background + Dark Text on random messages (illegible), inconsistent Stats: 10.15.1\n2014 MacBook pro\nIssue is in Mail application only.\nRecently the mac mail app defaults to dark text and a dark background as shown in the photo (Hopefully you get the point with what is visible, there's a \"Hi All\" underneath the From/To). It makes text very diffciult to see. \nSometimes if I click to load another email, it reverts to white background black text, sometimes to white text, black background.\nIt seems to only be in this app - some kind of dark mode bug maybe. Could be related to individuals using some kind of formatting on their emails, except the issue is not persistent - when I select another email and then switch back, sometimes the issue resolves.\nIs this a bug? Is this a settings issue?\n\n\nA: Do you have have macOS 10.13.x High Sierra on your Mac? There is a bug in the video chip or driver for some models in that version of macOS (also possibly in Mojave) that renders messages black in Mail in some scenarios. I have only seen it once, and then it affected all messages in threads, meaning it only manifested with the Mail View menu -> Organise by Conversation turned on, and then only for messages where there were actually two or more messages in the thread.\nThe solution, if this is the bug that bites you, is to open the System preferences, go to the Displays pane -> Colour tab, and try another one of the Display profiles in the list (uncheck \"Show profiles for this display only\"). Some will display the bug, some won't, so try to find one that don't show the bug and is pleasing to the eye. Alternatively you can calibrate the display to make a custom profile, and see if that one is bug free.\n", "Q: Why do PDFs disappear from the Books app on iPadOS?

But when I exited the PDFs there, only two of them remained in my library. The other three immediately disappeared from my library.\nWhy would that happen? Is there anything I can do about it? I can make them available offline and read them in the Box app but I prefer to collect all my reading material in Books.\nThis happened on an iPad Air 2 running iPadOS 13.3. I doubt this is caused by the Box app; could it be some property of the PDF that causes Books to remove it immediately on closing?\n\nA: \nI doubt this is caused by the Box app;\n\nThis is highly unlikely. Once the PDF is copied into the Books app, it's not possible for the Box app to remove it from the Books app.\n\ncould it be some property of the PDF that causes Books to remove it immediately on closing?\n\nNo.\nYou can additionally check if you have sufficient storage space available on your iPad.

If you have a soft copy of Snow Leopard, then burn this to a DVD.\n\n*Use the Disk Utility to erase the entire internal drive.\n\n*Install Snow Leopard\n\n*In necessary, install the OS X 10.6.8 combo update. You may find this difficult to download using Snow Leopard. If you currently have High Sierra, you may want to download this update to a flash drive before erasing the internal drive.\n\n*Use the Boot Camp Assistant application to install XP. If you have a soft copy of XP then burn this to a DVD. I assume XP is 32 bit and contains Service Pack 2 (SP2). Some users have posted that XP did not have to have SP2, but the Apple documentation says it does. If SP2 is required and your XP does not have this, then it is possible to add SP2 by slipstreaming, but this is probably more work than you want to tackle. The Boot Camp Assistant will probably require only Snow Leopard be installed before allowing Windows to be installed.\n\n*After installing XP, insert the Snow Leopard DVD to install the Window Support Software. You may be able to substitute the software from the Install Windows 7 on your Mac using Boot Camp website.\n\n*Install SP3 for XP.

If your Mac came pre-installed with macOS High Sierra of any earlier version, it can run macOS High Sierra.\nAssuming it does, you can't run macOS High Sierra installer from within macOS Catalina (or any newer release of macOS). The error message is conveying precisely the same thing to you:\nThis copy of the \"Install macOS\" application is too old to be opened on this version of macOS\n\nTo downgrade your Mac by installing an older version of macOS, you need to create a bootable macOS installer on a removable media.

I’ve also spent a good amount of time working with Apple Support, to make sure that these methods are \n\n\n*\n\n*safe\n\n*don't break any policies or warranties \n\n*work properly\n\n\nI was given a MPB 16\" by Apple to figure out what my DJs for my bands need which is a workable new 16 with the proper drivers while running Mojave so we can still use the plug-ins that are on Ableton and ProTools, not to mention the ones that just haven't been updated to work with Catalina.  \nAs digital obsolescence is just a way of life in the digital era, I have come to grips with that I will eventually have to let some go but I have DJ mixers for example like the Rane 64 which will probably never be updated (at least not anytime soon) since it barely got support for Mojave and I will just have to once the dust settles, go to a Catalina only system but in the meantime, I need a very good band aid that will keep my businesses running.\nI am doing this for self but I am keenly aware that, more than any time before, the upgrade and the release of the new 16 at the same time (not to mention the Tower) which I had to freeze 4 $26K versions of that I was ready to buy which is why they gave me this to figure out if I can work but until then, I pulled my deposit and didn't buy.\nI will tell you I have successfully created a bootable installer, installed it using the host 16 (therefore while installing, in theory it should have downloaded all the correct drivers for the system so things like video switching, proper thermals, etc are happening) and that is what I am doing right now.  \nWith various diagnostic tools and benchmark tests I am making sure that the system is running as it should before I post my method. The above post is correct but it leaves out some important things and I will hit on them in the video and script tutorials that I will have VERY shortly after I make sure everything is correct.\nJust doing it willy nilly is a dangerous operation because the system itself from the 15 to the 16 had some pretty drastic changes and getting the right drivers in the right place is important. \nI have been told by several engineers that, contrary to the above statement, that you should run the OS from am external drive only and not create a partition (or actually volume as it's called in APFS file format for macOS.  The reasons for that are still unclear to me but I don't want to test it on a system that I don't own and so I am only doing what I am told will keep me in policy and for the record, that does not so do it with care.\nI am using a USB 3.1 SanDisk Portable Extreme TB disk and the bottlenecking I was expecting is almost nill and maybe actually be that because of the 10Gbps transfer rates and the ability to have USB 3.1 on the 16 which if you don't install correctly, you might not have.  \nSo I have added some context to my mod deleted post that I am about to post a tutorial on how to do it the way that Apple is helping me do.  \nI plan on running a dual boot OS for at least 6 months, maybe a year depending on how long it takes some of my developers to start supporting Catalina properly.  If I was not able to make this work, I would have had to turn to the dark side and use a Windows system because I can't go backwards in speed (especially in the video CG world where speed is now near real-time previews of major depth in C4D with RedShift which the Navi on the Tower would provide much like the Nvidia RTX 2000+ series).  \nAs for the 16, it will more than support my musical needs.\n", "Q: How to monitor multiple macOS system usage?

Lots of people in my office are using Apple Watch.

Any App? \nI could go as far as building the custom mobile app if it does not exist yet, but really need direction on where I should go first.\n\nA: Since health data is highly private, you’ll want to have an app run on each device so everyone opts in to the collection. \nThis has been done very well - https://apps.apple.com/us/app/challenges-compete-get-fit/id1051342211\nI would start there and then see if you even need slack integration. The shortcuts app does have the ability to pull data from the health database, but you’re going to need to connect a few things and then architect the trigger or have people periodically push their data. The app above has already solved all those “design and technical challenges” for you so you can all just design a challenge on workouts and fitness \n\nHere’s how you get started with shortcuts. You can chain them together and call any web API so that’s how you’d get things to slack if there isn’t a slack app that works with shortcut automation on iOS. \nThere is an app for slack you could install and see if shortcuts still can post to slack after the app was renamed\nfrom workflow to shortcuts. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://your-slack-instance.slack.com/apps/A03A1LEM4-workflow\n\n", "Q: How to transfer keychain data from an external SSD? I need some information about Keychain access.  I plan to replace the SSD currently in my MBP with a larger SSD.  The SSD currently in my MBP would be placed in an enclosure which will be essentially an external drive. I plan to put a clean copy of the OS on the new drive to avoid any transfer of malware and so on which would happen if I cloned the drive I remove.  My only concern is the Keychain Access folder.  I need to keep all the information in the Keychain Access folder on the “old” drive and transfer it to the new drive.  Can I be sure that if I copy and paste the folder I will be getting all the data?\n\nA: The best way to copy your keychains to a new computer is to export and then import them using Keychain Access. See Import and export keychain items.\nHowever, you can also manually copy your keychains to another Mac/mac using the steps below. It should work in your scenario too. \n\n\n*\n\n*On your Mac, locate the keychain files you want to transfer.\n\n\nKeychains are usually located in the Keychains folder in the Library folder in your home folder. To locate these files, press and hold the Option key and choose to Go > Library, then open the Keychains folder.\n\n\n*Select the keychains you want, then press and hold the Option key and drag the selected keychains into another folder to copy them to the folder.\n\n\nKeychain files typically end with .keychain-db. Don’t select and copy encrypted folders with names that appear as a series of numbers.\n\n\n*Transfer the folder containing the keychains to the new computer.\n\n\nImportant: Transfer the keychains in a safe manner so no unauthorized person can access them. For example, use AirDrop or a USB flash drive to copy the files.\n\n\n*Change the name of the transferred keychains on your new computer so they don’t become confused with any of the existing keychains.\n\n\nThis is especially important if you are copying a standard keychain, such as the login keychain.\n\n\n*Open Keychain Access, located in the Utilities folder in the Applications folder.\n\n*Add each copied keychain one by one by choosing File > Add Keychain, selecting your keychain, then clicking OK.\n\n", "Q: tracing stuck local to local mails in macOS I'm sending myself a mail like this:\nAdministorsMBP2:~ administrator$ mail -s \"subject here\" me@mydomain.com <<< \"message\"\nAdministorsMBP2:~ administrator$ echo $?\n0\n\nThe command returns zero, meaning success.\nmailq command says empty.\nmy gmail inbox is empty too.\nso what happened? did the mail go through , if not how I trace this.\nmail command borrowed from: https://stackoverflow.com/a/13447901\n\nA: I know you want to use the command line, but use the GUI to add one mail account in Apple mail so you can view the sending mail server status.

At first, I was very happy as my iMac was much faster and even more quiet than before! After few hours of working with my iMac, the attack LED ( not the iMac) fell down from my desk on the floor.  I attached both display data cable and the display power cable, here are the symptoms:\n\n\n*\n\n*The iMac LED it all black.\n\n*I connected the iMac to my external LCD monitors and it works fine, i can login and work with it fine\n\n*The Fan is constantly running. Why is that?\n\n*My iMac seems to be very slow compare to the incident. What could be the reason.\nI suspect that either my mac’s display is damages or one or both of the two cables: display data cable and the display power cable are broken.\nAny help and advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: You have two distinct problems with your iMac that you’re unfortunately conflating with the most obvious damage - the broken display.  \n\n\n*\n\n*The display is most likely broken and will need to be replaced.  I can be tested, but not in a typical home or office environment.\n\n*The cable connectors on the logic board may be damaged as a fall like that will literally rip them off the board.  A visual inspection should be enough to verify if they are good or not\n\n*The fan spin is likely because you replaced your hard disk with a non-Apple one that doesn’t have a temp sensor.  A missing sensor will cause the fans to spin at full speed\n\n*The slow performance is likely due to the erroneous temp readings (from the missing sensor) and the Mac thermal throttling in response.\nTo fix the fan and speed issue, you simply need an inline temp sensor to send the correct data to the SMC.  However, the screen is quite expensive and you should get a quote on a replacement prior to doing this - it may be much more cost effective purchase a replacement iMac of the same vintage and sell that one for “parts.”\nAlso, if you’re going to replace a HDD and go through all the trouble on an iMac, you should spring for an SSD.  The performance gains are well worth it.\n", "Q: iPad mini wont update over iOS 10 I have been trying to update my iPad mini. But I don’t know what version it is. And I tried on the Mac computer, but it says current update is iOS 9.3.5. And it won’t let me make a new Apple account.\n\nA: You apparently have the original (first generation) iPad Mini. The last version of iOS released for the generation of iPad Mini is iOS 9.3.5 (iOS 9.3.6 for Wi-Fi + Cellular models). So it's not possible to update it to iOS 10 or later.\n\nit won’t let me make a new Apple account.\n\nYou can register for a new Apple account by going the the Apple ID website on any computer.

It seems that I don't have write permissions to write anything on the new partition.\n\n\n\n\nWhy is that and how can I fix it?\n\nA: I assume this happened as you have used the partition on Extended Journaled\nOpen the finder, find the drive under ‘Devices’, then right-click and select ‘Get Info’.  A dialog box should pop up and display the basic info of the drive. At the bottom, there is a collapsed menu for ‘Sharing & Permissions’, make sure your username has read and write permission, and check \"Ignore ownership on this volume\"\n\nIf you are unable to do this , then first try to disable Journaling, and do the previous step shared above\nOpen Disk Utility, Select the partition and then hold down the alt key. Select the file from the top menu and you will then see an option to ‘disable Journalling’\n", "Q: How do I search specified text in files on my Mac that are less than 20kb? I created an SVG image a few months ago.\nRecently I found the file is lost, but I don't think I deleted it.\nI need to know how can I find this file by setting up these filters:\n\n\n*\n\n*only search for files that were created in the past 8 months.\n\n*only search for files that are less than 20kb.\n\n*search keywords \"XXXX\" (which I am sure is in that file) that existed in these qualified files.\n\n\nIs there any way I can do this? Any solution is welcome.\n\nA: A simple Finder Spotlight search can do this. Navigate to the Folder you want to start the search from. Type Command F, and then enter the search criteria:\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by keywords: do you mean metadata describing the file, or some actual text in the SVG? You could try the \"Contents\" token for the latter.\n\nA: You can use Find Any File app as seen below\nhttps://apps.tempel.org/FindAnyFile/index.php\n\n\nA: Try this from terminal also if you want to get a file of search in txt too:\n find . -name '*.svg' -type 'f' -size -20k -newermt 2019-04-23 -not -newermt 2019-12-28 > findlist.txt\n\nNote:   the - before 20k. Just 20k means exactly 20 kilobytes. -20k means smaller than 20 kilobytes. +20k means larger than 20 kilobytes.\nThe -type 'f' forces the command to only act on files and skip directories. this would avoid errors if the path contains folders with names that match the pattern *.svg.\nIf you want to filter size in bytes (as in 20 bytes instead of 20 kilobytes) then you have to write it like this: 20c. If you just write 20 it will be interpreted as 20*512 bytes. This is a strange requirement by POSIX.\n", "Q: iMac SSD upgrade – Firmware password lock My dad bought a used 21.5 iMac (2017) a few weeks back (previous owner bought it new but decided to sell after a week, so its basically new.) Given that it came with a 1TB fusion drive, we decided to switch it for the Samsung EVO he was using in his previous Macbook (He doesn’t need storage, only speed.)\nAll went according to plan in terms of opening and swapping the drives, but upon rebooting (attempting to ctrl+r to boot menu) it popped the apple logo and then swapped to a black screen with a lock and password field.\nAfter a little reading on the subject it seems someone must have enabled the EFI Firmware password protection which doesn’t allow booting on other drives e.g. external or otherwise.\nI’ve contacted the previous owner, but she's drawing a blank, claiming never setting up anything of the sort. I’m unsure if this can be enabled during first boot installation, but she didn’t strike me as the type who would know how to do so afterwards (let alone think about it.) My guess is that the shop might’ve had it returned from a prior owner, not reset it correctly and resold it as new (or perhaps discounted, hard to tell from the receipt.)\nTL;DR\nKnowing firmware is locked with an unobtainable password ... \n\n\n*\n\n*Would I be able to remove the new SSD and insert the original HDD and have\nthe password prompt go away? Or is the system locked until correct\npassword is entered, no matter the drive (it booted prior to\nswitching drives).\n\n*Warranty void on opening and swapping diskdrive? Searching around it\nseems everyone has a different story. Some say the rest of the\nsystem is still under warranty, others do not. This isn’t Apples\nissue of cause, but I would likely levy it against the reseller.\n\n*Even if the old HDD would work again, I’m assuming that not having\nthe FW password would be a roadblock if reinstalling OSX in the\nfuture?\n\n\nA: This Apple document tells you everything you need to know about Firmware passwords.\nThe essential points for you are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your Mac asks for the firmware password only when attempting to start up from a storage device other than the one selected in Startup Disk preferences, or when starting up from macOS Recovery.\n\n*If you can't remember your firmware password or passcode, schedule an in-person service appointment with an Apple Store or Apple Authorized Service Provider. Bring your Mac to the appointment, and bring your original receipt or invoice as proof of purchase.\nThe Firmware password is not required for OS installation.\nYou will need to ask the original purchaser for their receipt or other proof of purchase.\n", "Q: Is it possible to move from an old mac to a new mac only selected applications and documents? I would like to move from an old mac book pro to a new one only selected applications and documents. I set my old mac using an older one mac so I have very old applications that I should uninstall. I run migration assistant but with this program is not possible to select the application I want to transfer. Is there another way to do this? Both mac (old and new) run Mojave 10.14.6.\n\nA: You can of course select and copy any documents you want: though you will have to select them manually. \nFor the applications, it will largely depend on where they came from. Apps from the Mac App Store are linked to your Apple ID, and can be re-downloaded from the App Store onto the new Mac. \nThird-party software may work just by copying the application: though some apps may need an installer that adds additional support files. Apps may need serial numbers or other protection re-applied.\nwhether they are App Store downloads, or other software that requires an installer. Some apps can be copied \n", "Q: How to access a website despite a certificate error? I am moving a web server to a new infrastructure. Before switching the DNS records I would like to check if the new configuration is working. I modified /private/etc/hosts/ with the IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) of the new server and after flushing the DNS cache everything is working.\nBut as the certificate doesn't match, Safari, Firefox, Opera and Chrome give me an error which I can't seem to ignore. Is there a workaround for this?\n\nA: For Google Chrome the following flag exists to circumvent certificate errors and continue browsing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close Google Chrome\n\n*Open Terminal and enter:\n/Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome --ignore-certificate-errors &> /dev/null &\n\nIf the app resides somewhere else than in /Applications/ apply the path to Google Chrome respectively.\nLaunching Google Chrome like this is rather meant for dev purposes than for normal browsing since the security of the https-connection(s) is flawed. \n", "Q: Website says enable cookies even though they are enabled, on Catalina I use the bill pay feature from my credit union.  After upgrading to Catalina the bill pay feature reports that cookies are disabled.   \nCookies are not disabled.  I have cleared them, cleared history, restarted safari, restarted the computer.  Still no love.  You can see that new cookies have been created after logging in to the credit union.  But the bill pay feature still reports that cookies are disabled.   I have two systems running Mojave that don't have this problem.  What could be blocking this web site from reading the cookie? The firewall maybe?\n\nA: I’m going to avoid stating that your banking web site is garbage and that it’s not your firewall or anything you can change (other than banks), so let’s go to a nice site that can show you if your chosen browser and settings allow cookies to function. Then you can make your own opinion of what your bank’s site is telling you:\n\n*\n\n*https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_cookies.asp\nScroll down to the part that says The Cookie String and there are 5 controls where you can set, delete and inspect cookies.\nIf that works, your browser is processing cookies. I have a hunch you can figure things from there, but if not @ me or ask a follow on question with details above so we can dig into either the w3schools site or your bank’s specific site.\n\nA: If there's any hint of \"best viewed in these browsers\" on the site, it's good to use them. \nYou can \"empty cache\" using alt+command+E or by using Develop Menu in Safari.\nAlso, try turning off \"Prevent cross-site tracking\" to see any effect. You can turn it back on later, if you want.\n\nSome websites use third-party content providers. A third-party content provider can track you across websites to advertise products and services.\nWith this option turned on, tracking data is periodically deleted unless you visit the third-party content provider.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/safari/sfri35610/12.0/mac/10.14.5\nAlso disable all extensions and third party safety applications you might have.\n", "Q: How to sync Home Videos on TV app from macOS Catalina 10.15 to iPhone?

So, you bought a new mac that came pre-installed with Catalina which means you cannot run Mojave on it.  You could get a virtual machine and run Mojave in the virtual machine.

An Automator workflow that mounts a disk image on when I drag and drop the dmg file onto it is easy: \nInstead of dragging and dropping the dmg file I want to double click the created workflow and have it mount a specific file. I've tried using \"Set Value of Variable\" to the path of the dmg, \"Open Finder Items\", and \"Get Selected Folder Items\", nothing works. \nI can do it with the command line as:\nhdiutil mount disk_image_name.dmg\n\nI've also tried with the Applescript: \n    on run {input, parameters}\n\n        tell application \"DiskImageMounter\"\n            open \"path/disk_image_name.dmg\"\n        end tell\n    end run\n\nBut after mounting the disk image as expected, Automator freezes for about 15 seconds and gives the below Syntax Error. \n\nThe reason I want to avoid using hdituil is the disk images are encrypted.

I really hope to solve this problem as it has been drilling me for weeks now. I have a MacBook Pro 13\" (2018 with Touch Bar), the A1989 model.\nWhen I shut down my Mac, the Mac shut down correctly and I closed the lid. Left it in my desk until morning. In the morning, I felt that the Mac was warm to the touch and when I turn on, it boots up with Apple logo (like a normal startup, so it wasn’t sleeping) and it asks for my password before I could use Touch ID (so it wasn’t sleeping). BUT the battery had drained from 100% (when I shut it down) to 5%, if not completely 0 mAh left in the battery (literally 0% and won’t boot unless plugged in) when I turn it on.\nI find this behaviour rather frustrating and it definitely consumes my charge cycle. When I shut it down and left it for some good 2-3 hours, it also drains around 20-30%.\nYes, I have once removed the Logic Board for cleaning (after some minor liquid damage around the iBridge Bus, which caused camera, Touch Bar, and ambient sensor to no longer work). But I made sure everything was dry and cleaned all the corrosion with 95% ethanol before putting everything back together. Couldn’t be I missed something that causes this weird problem right?\nThings I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resetting the SMC and NVRAM (and even T2 chip) multiple times.\n\n*Reinstalling macOS (I used 10.15.2 and tried downgrading + fresh install 10.14.6 to no avail).\n\n*Shutting the Mac down and not even touching the lid. So, left the Mac open after shut down for hours, and yet it drained too.\n\n*Turning off Wi-Fi before shutting the Mac down.\n\n\nall to no avail.\nWeirdly enough, if I just sleep the Mac, the drain was normal (just 1% drain overnight). Shut down, which was not supposed to drain any battery, was actually draining A LOT (even if need power for startup or shut down, those maybe drain around 1-5%, not 20%).\nPlease advise me on what to do. Thank you so much :))\n\nA: I had this same problem and the only thing that worked for me was turning off bluetooth completely from the menu bar by clicking \"Turn Bluetooth Off\" on the bluetooth logo.    This has completely stopped my Mac from draining over night.  \nPreviously I had tried all of those same things that you did and nothing worked.   \n\nA: I have the same experience with the latest MacBook Pro 13inch 2020 model, just delivered 2 weeks ago. I never turned on BT, and have also tried disabling the new battery management feature to no avail. The only thing left for me to try is to turn off WiFi before I shutdown.\nAny help will be gladly appreciated.\n\nA: What worked for me was to disable \"Allow bluetooth devices to wake this computer\" option under Bluetooth advanced settings.\n", "Q: Safari tabs sync on two macs and an iPhone does not work Syncing using iCloud with 2 macs and an iPhone does not work. I use iCloud to sync safari, and my MacBook is perfectly synchronized with my iPhone. \nThe problem is that my iMac is not synchronized at all.  When I add some website to a reading list on the MacBook, it does not appear in the iMac. \nI tried to uncheck and recheck the Safari checkbox in iCloud on all of my devices, but it didn't help. \nDoes anyone know how to fix this?\nI am running the latest Mojave(10.14.6) on both Macs, and iOS 12 on my iPhone.\nUpdate\nAs @ankii suggested, I've tried to remove all bookmarks from the iPhone and the iMac, and resync. Now the bookmarks are syncing between these devices, but the open tabs are not. On my iPhone I can see the open tabs from the MacBook but not from the iMac. On the iMac I see no open tabs from none of my other devices.\nI also tried to follow this answer MacOS Safari iCloud tabs stop working randomly after some time but it didn't help.\n\nA: It's a radical way  to solve it, but that's how I did it. Export the bookmarks.HTML  using File menu in Safari. Then start cleaning up the bookmarks, reading list and favourites from all the devices. On Macs it's easy to do using \"Edit bookmarks\" and right-click on an item on reading list to clear all. \n\n\n*\n\n*How to clear ALL items from Safari's reading list?\nAfter all devices, and iCloud have no bookmarks, reading list etc, check the sync by adding a test bookmark. If it does, then import the HTML file. If not, try uncheck/check Safari sync in System Preferences. \nAlso, this is not a verified remark, but Safari stopped syncing the moment I made bookmark folders on my Mac. I had to use them without folders. \n\n", "Q: How can I automate adding sender addresses to a Rule in macOS Mail? So I've created a Mail Rule \"Bin Spam Messages\" that will delete messages from a sender. What I can't figure out is how to automate adding new sender addresses to the rule. I'm guessing I could do this with AppleScript but I'm also trying to do it without opening the message. The goal is to automatically delete spam messages from my inbox and junk mail folders. I thought this was what the Apply Rules menu option was for but apparently not.\nAny ideas?\nUpdate: I have tried updating SyncedRules.plist using a Shell script (below) but (a) it doesn't show up in Mail preferences; and (b) SyncedRules is restored after relaunching Mail. Not sure where else Mail rules are stored.\n#! /bin/zsh\n\n# Generate 128-bit UUID\nCRITERION_UNIQUE_ID=\"$(uuidgen)\"\n\n# Define Shell input variables\nEXPRESSION=\"$1\"\nHEADER=\"$2\"\n\n# Define SyncedRules.plist file\nFILENAME=\"/Users/tim/Library/Mail/V7/MailData/SyncedRules.plist\"\n\n# Run plutil\nplutil -insert 0.Criteria.0 -xml \"<dict><key>CriterionUniqueId</key><string>$CRITERION_UNIQUE_ID</string><key>Expression</key><string>$EXPRESSION</string><key>Header</key><string>$HEADER</string></dict>\" $FILENAME\n\nThis script inserts a dictionary into the first items Criteria array containing a 128-bit UUID, sender email address and email header, but my issue is persistence. If I run the command with sudo, I can update the SyncedRules.plist but Mail doesn't recognise the changes and the .plist is restored when Mail relaunches, anyway.\nGetting warmer...\nMore Updates: So I doubled back and had a look at the Mail library in Script Editor.. then discovered this answer https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/332482/34929 - there's a block there that I'm particularly interested in... something like make new rule with properties {header:\"\", expression:thisItem, rule type:from header, qualifier:equal to value} condition - I think this is where I'm heading now.\n\nA: Mail remembers tabs in Preferences window, and the workflow is highly simplified using \"edit rule\" to add new senders and to add new actions or use the already specified ones for them. You'd anyway have to add a new sender's mail ID manually. For these reasons, I am not very keen over having a script or automator action. \nHowever, I decided to put my comments into a partial answer.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3542826/applescript-editor-record-doesnt-work/18752770#18752770\nThis answer documents a way to use Automator to record the actions you perform in the mail app. Here's the workflow. Select all steps and copy paste in \"Script Editor App\" for getting the code. https://pastebin.com/RNSShvWK\n\nHere are the details from Preferences Window of Mail app using \"Accessibility Inspector\".

More in detail here is the C-SLIDE product page. \n\nI decided it's time to get rid of it but I'm not sure how to do so properly without damaging the display's protection layer.\nDoes anybody have experience with this kind of delicate operations? Is there any solvent expressly produced for that? Or would it help handling the laptop to a specialised shop or an Apple Store?\n\nA: The damage is already done by whatever adhesive was applied. Apple only recommends one solvent, pure water, so I would use a plastic spudger to gently dislodge the slide and then clean as best you can with water. \nIf you need a solvent, flip the screen upside down so any solvent drips over the normal top, now bottom onto the aluminum as opposed to dripping down the glass. \nChances are, the anti reflective coating will only be weakened or damaged in that top area or not at all. Damage to that layer there doesn’t spread, it’s only where a solvent or physical abrasion is present, so carefully control abrasion and solvents and your screen area should be safe. \nTaking it to a shop that has tools and experience with solvents might be well worth the trip. Take them a pie or cookies, they will love the challenge and you’ll be in good hands if you’re not sure of your skills.  \nMy hunch - you’ll get it off and whatever damage happened will be negligible and no issue. Please post a follow up picture once you’re done or answer how you solved this!\n\nA: I firstly asked a specialised shop to remove the cover for me, but - after a quick attempt with a solvent - they answered they couldn't take the risk of damaging the screen.\nTherefore I eventually took a big breath and removed it by myself by delicately using my nail to leverage the cover.\nResult: I was able to remove it from both laptops without leaving any trace on the screen. The only visible damage consists of a few light scratches left by the sliding lid.\n", "Q: Chown to make sudo unncessary? I am setting up a new Mac for mobile app development and so I need to install a lot of things through the Terminal. Its asking me for sudo to do a lot of things and I vaguely remember a chown command that makes my user the owner of the root directory so that I don't need to do sudo. What is that command? \n(Most of my searches so far have taken me to people messing up that command and breaking things and so I didn't just want to try something.)\n\nA: The tool chown isn’t good for this. Instead use sudo -s to be root. Now you’re the owner of the root directory.\nIf you want to ask a follow on question showing a specific path and specific command you get a specific error, there might be a better way to set things up - root won’t help with system read only files and the restricted flag in System Integrity Protection. Also, avoiding root entirely or adding your user to the sudoers file for the things you need also will get you less friction without tearing down all the protections of using a non-root user provide.\n", "Q: How do I play an mp3 on my iPad?

The Outlook search (top right corner of Outlook, not Spotlight search) used to return everything. At some point, it started only returning items from the currently active folder (the folder selected in the sidebar). For example, if I am in Inbox, it will not return items from Sent. To search sent items, I have to go to Sent and then repeat the search. At first I thought it was some random glitch, but after several months and multiple updates and restarts, it continues to happen.\nI saw some similar posts (such as How to fix Outlook for Mac search), but they seem to be related to Spotlight indexing or privacy.

For example, when you run mkdir from the command line, it uses the mkdir() function to actually create the directory. Finder doesn't bother using the mkdir command, it simply calls mkdir() (or something equivalent) itself.\nThis causes two problems for what you want. First, system calls aren't generally logged; and second, there isn't always an easy way to figure out what command would do the equivalent thing (if there even is such a command -- there isn't always).\nThere are ways to get some info about what's going on behind the scenes of GUI programs, but they're not particularly easy to use (or interpret the output from).\n\n\n*\n\n*The fs_usage command will list file system events (including things like directory creation) as they happen... but a lot of file system events happen all the time, most of them completely irrelevant to what you're interested in. Filtering out what you care about tends to be tricky. And of course it's only useful if it's a file system event you care about.\n\n*DTrace can be used to trace things like system calls in detail, if you know what calls you're interested in tracing. Recent versions of macOS restrict the ability to trace most Apple programs (Finder, System Preferences, ...), so you'll need to at-least-partly disable System Integrity Protection to use it effectively.\n", "Q: Cyberduck Google Drive connection error I've downloaded Cyberduck for Mac.

Then, if I use the Install Snow Leopard option from the DVD, when it restarts it hangs on the apple icon, but if I restart the Mac nothing happened to my HDD.\nI also tried using booting the DVD by holding 'Option' when I restart it, and after I choose to boot from the DVD, it hangs on the apple icon and I can hear that the DVD stop spinning.\nI boot it on safe mode and use the Apple Hardware Diagnose Tool and no issues have been shown. I will appreciate if anyone have an idea of how I can perform this clean install. Thanks!\n\nA: A Snow Leopard DVD may not work on a 2010 iMac. For example, according to everymac.com a iMac11,2 (21.5-inch, Mid-2010) came preinstalled with OS X 10.6.3. So, if your Snow Leopard DVD is OS X 10.6 then you should expect problems when booting.\n\nNote: While one may think 10.6 should be 10.6.0, doing so would differ from Apple conventions. For example, see an image of the Snow Leopard 10.6 DVD or the system requirements for the Mac OS X 10.6.8 Update Combo v1.1.\n\n\nA: According to @David Anderson (thanks!), the 2010 iMac came preinstalled with Snow Leopard 10.6.3. Therefore, there's a good chance that earlier versions of Snow Leopard (10.6.0–10.6.2) will not contain the necessary drivers for your machine, and will be impossible to install.\nApple released at least two retail Snow Leopard installation DVDs—I own one which comes with 10.6.0, and one which comes with 10.6.3. If you have an earlier DVD, that may explain why the OS is unable to boot.\nSo, one thing you could try is tracking down a 10.6.3 installation DVD, on eBay or similar. The disk you're looking for has part number MC573Z/A. There also appears to be an image of this DVD in the Internet Archive's Software Library, but I cannot personally vouch for its authenticity.\nAnother option is to install your DVD inside of a VM, upgrade to 10.6.8 within the VM, and then clone the VM to your hard disk. However, this route is made quite tricky by the fact that most VM software will refuse to install non-server editions of Snow Leopard, due to a licensing restriction that Apple lifted starting with Lion.\n", "Q: Automatically tagging files that were last opened more than x days ago I want to set up a process to run each day and identify files that were last opened x days ago, then apply a tag like \"to review\" to those files. Those files would appear tagged in Finder with the appropriate color / tag and that tag would be searchable.  \nIs Automator the best bet and, if so, does anyone have a script that does something like this that I can refer to?\n\nA: When a file is tagged in Finder it has an extended attribute set on it:\n      com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags \nGeneral Information\nThe easiest way I've found to apply a custom tag to a file programmatically is to use xattr to get the value of a custom tag, not one of the default tags, and apply it to the target file(s) via a shell script. For example, I created a new custom tag named Review, giving it the color yellow.

See man xargs in Terminal for additional information. \nProgrammatic Usage\nThis could be used in a bash script or in Automator using a Run Shell Script action, however the Find Finder Items action and Filter Finder Items action in Automator has a bug with the Date last opened setting.\nThis leaves using the find command or the mdfind command, the latter being better at finding files for the Date Last Opened as shown in Finder in List view or the Get Info sheet for a given file, which is the kMDItemLastUsedDate attribute used with the mdfind command using a properly formed query. Note that mdfind does require Spotlight Indexing of the target directory, and is turned on by default.\nIn Terminal, this compound command example uses mdfind to locate files matching the query and its result it passed to xargs to run xattr on the files to apply the custom tag:\nmdfind -0 -onlyin \"$HOME/Documents\" 'kMDItemLastUsedDate > $time.today(-7) && kMDItemLastUsedDate < $time.today(-6)' | xargs -0 -I % xattr -wx com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags '62706C6973743030A101585265766965770A35080A0000000000000101000000000000000200000000000000000000000000000013' %\n\n      Hint: Mouse over and horizontal scroll to see full code.\nHow this gets wrapped in a shell script or in Automator using a Run Shell Script action and scheduled to run at a regular interval really depends on how one intends to schedule it and other criteria surrounding how one intends to take into account its usage and other controls so as not to just run wild, if you will.\nI would probably choose to use launchd to schedule this as a bash script and stay away from Automator, that is depending on what else one is wanting to be a part of the overall process.\nFor testing purposes, under macOS High Sierra, this is what I did:\n1. Create a bash script with the example mdfind compound command from above.\nIn Terminal:\nmkdir ~/bin\ncd ~/bin\ntouch crtag\nopen -e crtag\n\nThe last command above should, by default, open crtag, for [C]ustom[R]eview[Tag], in TextEdit, in which the following lines were added:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nmdfind -0 -onlyin \"$HOME/Documents\" 'kMDItemLastUsedDate > $time.today(-7) && kMDItemLastUsedDate < $time.today(-6)' | xargs -0 -I % xattr -wx com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags '62706C6973743030A101585265766965770A35080A0000000000000101000000000000000200000000000000000000000000000013' %\n\n      Hint: Mouse over and horizontal scroll to see full code.\nSaved the e.g. crtag document and closed it.\nBack in Terminal, made crtag executable, e.g.:\nchmod 0755 crtag\n\n      Note: 0755 translates to: -rwxr-xr-x\n2. Create a PLIST file for launchd to run the e.g. crtag shell script daily at the desired time.\nIn Terminal:\ncd ~/Library/LaunchAgents\ntouch com.my.DateLastOpenedCustomReviewTag.plist\nopen -e com.my.DateLastOpenedCustomReviewTag.plist\n\nThe last command above should, by default, open com.my.DateLastOpenedCustomReviewTag.plist in TextEdit, in which the following lines were added:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>EnvironmentVariables</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>PATH</key>\n        <string>/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:</string>\n    </dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.my.DateLastOpenedCustomReviewTag</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/bin/bash</string>\n        <string>/path/to/script</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <false/>\n    <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>\n    <array>\n        <dict>\n            <key>Hour</key>\n            <integer>9</integer>\n            <key>Minute</key>\n            <integer>00</integer>\n        </dict>\n    </array>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nWhile setting /path/to/script to the actual fully qualified pathname, e.g. /Users/me/bin/crtag, and the time as shown in the <key>Hour</key>, <integer>9</integer> and <key>Minute</key>, <integer>00</integer> keys, which uses 24 Hour time.\nSaved the e.g. com.my.DateLastOpenedCustomReviewTag.plist document and closed it.\nBack in Terminal, loaded the e.g. com.my.DateLastOpenedCustomReviewTag.plist file for launchd to run the shell script, per its settings:\nlaunchctl load com.my.DateLastOpenedCustomReviewTag.plist\n\nNow every day at e.g. 9:00 AM, the files meeting the mdfind query will have the custom tag applied to them, which can be viewed in Finder from the Tags section on the Sidebar, or other Finder methods involving Tags.\n\n\nNote: See the manual pages in Terminal  for mdfind, launchd, launchctl, tr, xargs and xattr, e.g. man mdfind.

My guess is that Apple's T2 chip blocks the fingerprint to 3rd party apps, but I'm not sure if I'm correct. \n\nA: You guessed correctly. Speaking as a developer, there are no APIs Apple provides to interface with the fingerprint reader directly. Even the process of asking to store credentials goes through a system API that really only gives you a success or failure result and an optional reason. As their docs put it:\n\nThe context handles user interaction, and also interfaces to the Secure Enclave, the underlying hardware element that manages biometric data. \n\nYou never get to see or interact with that data.\nAlso, the fingerprint reader on Touch ID-enabled Macs functions as a power button, so there's no way to remap that key to do anything else useful either.\n", "Q: How to delete Command Line Tools while keeping Xcode? I recently purchased a new Mac and I am currently in the process of setting it up as a development machine.\nBefore installing Xcode I went ahead and installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sublime Text\n\n*Sublime Merge\n\n\nWhile setting up Sublime Merge I was prompted to install the Xcode Command Line Tools (Macintosh HD -> Library -> Developer -> Command Line Tools).\nI went ahead and did that, and was able to successfully set up my repos on Sublime Merge.\nI then installed Xcode which comes bundled with the Command Line Tools in its own package (Applications -> Xcode -> Contents -> Developer).\nRight after installing Xcode I saw that in Software Update I had an update to the Command Line Tools and so I performed that.\nI'm striving for a clean set up and was wondering whether or not I now have redundant copies of the Command Line Tools, if so, how do I (or do I even need to) get rid of the old tools safely?\n\nA: Xcode.app provides a set of command line tools. Standalone 'Xcode Command Line Tools' provides another set. You can switch between them (see xcode-select --help).\ngit, gcc and many commands in /usr/bin/ is actually a jumper to the real executable of selected CLT.\nStandalone CLT is almost unnecessary if you have Xcode.app installed. You can simply trash /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools to remove it.\nIn my case it installed these pkg (pkgutil --pkgs before and after installation)\ncom.apple.pkg.DevSDK_macOS1013_Public\ncom.apple.pkg.CLTools_Executables\ncom.apple.pkg.DevSDK\ncom.apple.pkg.CLTools_SDK_macOSSDK\ncom.apple.pkg.macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14\ncom.apple.pkg.DevSDK_OSX109\ncom.apple.pkg.CLTools_SDK_macOS1013\ncom.apple.pkg.CLTools_SDK_macOS1014\ncom.apple.pkg.DevSDK_OSX1012\ncom.apple.pkg.DevSDK_OSX1011\ncom.apple.pkg.DevSDK_OSX1010\n\nYou can use pkgutil --files <pkg_name> to see installed files.

I have have been running Catalina on my long-in-the-tooth Mid-2012 13\" MBP. As I'm now getting a new work MBP, I wanted to give my wife this MBP, and take hers (pre-2012, and therefore can't install Mojave or Catalina in its current state). However... I still need a machine to do occasional freelance work on... so I was wondering, could I install my system HD in my wife's older MBP, and have it \"just work\"? Like, would it successfully boot into Catalina? Or would it balk at the older hardware on boot? Or some other kind of non-/semi-functioning? (I'd like a canonical answer, but personal experiences are also really helpful.)\n\nA: In the past, you could quite simply move a boot drive from one Mac to another & have it work as though nothing had changed. The only proviso was that both machines were of an age to know what each OS is, not too new, not too old.\nI've been doing this with Macs for decades. \nIf the 'jump' between OSes would have required a firmware update, that may be a stumbling block, however, if the Mac you want to transfer the drive to cannot run the OS on the drive, then this simply will not work at all.\n\nA: No. \n2011 MacBook Pros and earlier are not supported by Catalina. The latest supported OS for those MBPs is 10.13 (High Sierra). While there might be hacks and system modifications to get Catalina to run, they will be unreliable.  \nApple usually closes off new OSes to old Macs because they lack necessary hardware - in this case because their GPUs don't support the Metal graphics framework.\nGenerally, any given installation of MacOS should work on any Mac that the OS supports. I've cloned several Macs, but always in a 'forward' direction: G3 iBook 2003 to MacBook 2006 to MacBook 2009 to MacBook Pro 2012 to MacBook Pro 2014 (Tiger 10.4 to Mojave 10.14!!!)\n", "Q: Downgrade to older version of app while keeping app data? Is there a way to downgrade an app and keep the app data you have built up by using the newer version of the app (e.g. keep game scores, keep wifi test history, etc...) \n\nA: If you have the app binary IPA cached and ready to install, yes you can try that by wiping the device, reload the data and only restore the app version you control. \nThis is not something that’s been easy or even possible for most people without prior setup work in the past few years as iTunes no longer manages local IPA downloads. \n\n\n*\n\n*ground control might work if you’re already using that\n\n*Apple configurator might be able to help if you already use it\n\n\nIn almost all cases, the answer is no. Even if you’re a dedicated IT department, you will need to plan to prevent upgrades until you test things as opposed to have a roll back option. \nApp upgrade and installation is one way forward by very intentional design. Work with the vendor to fix your issue in the next build or choose to not use the app are the practical choices for the vast majority of cases. \n", "Q: How to make display PDF images with mouse hover in iTerm2 after \" ls -l '? On Catalina 10.15.2, Sometimes, in iTerm2 terminal, after a ls -l command, I can visualize some pdf files (a popup window appears suddenly) when my mouse is over the list of PDF filenames.\nBut this is not systematically and I would like to know how to make appear this popup window into which the image of filename pointed appears (that would be very useful because this popup window is relatively large and we can distinguish details).\nIf someone could know what to do to activate systematically this behavior with mouse (maybe it is a shortcut with mouse or other things, I don't know), this would be nice to explain it.\n\nA: You can activate this behavior in iTerm2 by activating the \"Look up & data detectors multitouch shortcut.

It's not clear why you have 192.168.5.255 and 192.168.2.255 both as broadcast networks, but that's not necessarily wrong if you have your network set up like that.\n", "Q: Using a Macbook Pro as a second monitor for another Macbook Pro My parents are visiting us for Christmas, and we'd like to watch a movie together. We have two Macbook Pros between 4 people and no TV or other display, so we'd like to watch the same movie, synchronised, on both computers. We're on the same WiFi network but don't have any HDMI cables, thunderbolt cables, etc.\nIs there a way that we can use one of the Macs as an external monitor for the other Mac, in order to achieve this?\nUnfortunately, the Bluetooth antenna is broken on one of the machines, so a Bluetooth solution won't work for me. However, feel free to post one in case it's helpful for other users.\n\nA: \nso we'd like to watch the same movie, synchronised, on both computers.\n\nYou can leverage the Screen Sharing feature built into macOS to achieve this. You'd just need a network connection (which you happen to have via Wi-Fi) and would NOT need any cables whatsoever.\nTo use Screen Sharing, on the MacBook on which you'll be playing the movie, go to System Preferences app → Sharing and enable Screen Sharing.\n\nOnce configured, the other Macs in the same Wi-Fi network would be able to see the configured MacBook and can request access to your configured MacBook.\nHowever, in this scenario, you'd have to resort to using the original Macs speaker. So the audio playback would only be from one MacBook (which would also be the case in an external display scenario). \n\nA: Try using AirParrot2 for it. It is a great screen share tool and it allows me to project my Macbook screen onto a TV too. So you can watch on the big screen instead of two separate screens.\n", "Q: xhost on MacOS Catalina I am trying to work with Docker and a gui application and I need to use the xhost command.\nI believe it used to exist but I don't see it. I also believe it is related to Quartz but running Quartz doesn't magically make the problem go away!\n\nA: If XQuartz was installed previously, you have to enter the full path to xhost if the /opt/X11/bin folder wasn't added to your PATH or the system's PATH:\n/opt/X11/bin/xhost\n\n\nRun without any command line argument\n\n... a message indicating whether or not access control is  currently enabled  is printed, followed by the list of those allowed to connect.  This is the only option that may be used from machines other than the controlling host.\n\nFurther help: man xhost (or man /opt/X11/share/man/man1/xhost.1 if the /opt/X11/share/man folder isn't considered by manpath).\n", "Q: Why does the lettering wear off MacBook keyboards? Check out the letter \"A\" in the image.  Why is it smudging / wearing off?\n\n\nA: The keys on Apple's laptops are translucent plastic, with black paint applied on the surface. The letter is 'reversed out' of the black paint, backlit through the translucent portion.  So it's not white paint smudging, but black paint wearing off.\nThose keys are pressed millions of times. And each press involve some degree of friction, which means the removal of matter. The sweat from your fingers is slightly acidic; and who knows what other oils and particles might get transferred from your sandwich. It's possible - or even likely - that a laptop keyboard might get other 'matter' spilt or splashed onto it.\nAny or all of these things might act as a combination of solvent and abrasive. If you use a microscope or macro lens you will see this chipping clearly.\nObviously, the designers know this, and try to make a keyboard whose paint will resist the rigours of a lifetime's use. However, nothing is impervious. How old is your Mac?\nAs to why this key and no others? A is certainly a key that's going to get more finger-rest and usage than others. It's just the perfect storm of the right amount of wear with a particular mix of particles and chemicals.\n\nA: \n⤅ +25y ⤅\n\n\n True! No real answer but easy to understand...\n\n\nA: I've had this exact same issue, and it is always those 3 or 4 keys.  It happened to me just 6 months after owning the Macbook Pro this year (2020).\nThey replaced the board, but by Oct it started again.\nI don't accept that it is based on how you type tho.  I had a Macbook Air for about 7 years or so, and sold it looking almost like new.  It is how they are made.  Whether they are made cheaper, I don't know.\nAnyway, it happened again and Amazon came to the result as I got it from them.\nI've now got a replacement unit.  Different keyboard too, so hopefully it's better quality.\nFor Apple you expect it to be the best.  They always say they do the best, not the cheapest.\nBut yes, I've had that issue, TWICE within 12 months.\n\nA: Seen this on many keyboards of many manufacturers - it’s about how you “hit” the keys...\nWith a slight sliding action you will eventually wear away the material.\nYou could use a keyboard cover to protect the keys from further wear, but some say they don’t like the different feel - that’s a choice to make.\nAnd, you are not alone - been happening on mine as well... As in the shift key and the command key.\n", "Q: External display doesn’t fill screen I’m using a Mobile Pixels DUEX PRO as an external screen for my Mac laptop, and at normal resolution, everything is too small (see first picture). I’ve tried to change the resolution, but all that ends up happening is that the screen scales down but doesn’t fill the screen, and everything is still way too small to read. (second picture)\nHow do I decrease the resolution of the screen while still having it fill the screen? Thanks!\nTo clarify, I'm not looking for how to “zoom” using the accessibility settings, the issue is that basically everything on the external display is half the size of what it is on the main screen, and the “scaling” option in display settings doesn’t actually change the resolution of the screen, it just decreases the actual size of the screen.\nAs for info on the screen, it’s the Mobile Pixels DUEX Pro, which connects via USB (here: https://www.mobilepixels.us/pages/duex_pro_product_page). I’m on Mac OS 10.15.2, and the driver for the screen is DisplayLink. My laptop is a 2014 Retina MacBook Pro.\n[\n\n\nA: Something is odd with the display - I expect you to have the traditional larger text / more space controls rather than a list of resolutions.\nThe resolutions are poor for controlling text size as you correctly have diagnosed.\n\nYour OS is totally up to date and your hardware is well capable of driving that display. Does the vendor have an update to the display / firmware you might load to assist in working more like most display port monitors? Your Mac can use an iPad to run display, but since you already have this hardware - I hope my start to an answer either helps or someone can provide the clue / missing step to get back to the controls above.\nOne hint - when you are in the displays preference pane and your DUEX is connected - hold the option key and down by the help question mark - bottom right, you should get a button to \"Detect Displauys\" - press that once and exit out of displays / re-enter it to see if that helps get you different choices.\nI would also check \"Show mirroring options...\" so you can see if the menu item for the second display helps you mirror / change the resolution.\n", "Q: Control stays with previous app after four-finger swipe? On my mac (Sierra, OS 10.12.6), I have it set so that I can swipe between different desktop screens with four fingers on the trackpad. But when I do this, the \"control\" stays with the app that was in use on the previous screen. \nI.e., if I am using the Messages app, but then four-finger swipe to change to the screen where Google Chrome is open, and then I start typing, the text is entered into a conversation in Messages (only noticeable after scrolling back to the previous screen), not into Chrome. \nIs there a setting that can change this behavior? It is always counterintuitive to have the app that's visible on my current desktop not actually be the one I'm controlling. \nEDIT\nI just found that this issue occurs consistently when switching between screens with Messages and Chrome, but doesn't seem to happen for all apps. E.g., when I switch between screens with Notes and Chrome, the control switches to the new app as desired.\n\nA: This is unexpected behaviour. There is no setting for this. Does this also happen when you switch to a different virtual desktop with the keyboard shortcut ctrl + left/right arrow key?\nI would usually tell people to trash the plist that holds any related settings but it seems that com.apple.desktop.plist doesn't exist anymore in Sierra.\nInstalling sierra over the current install could mend your issue. Best to have the latest installer for sierra in that case and not an older version than you already have installed. This will, by the way, not delete you stuff. It will install the OS over whatever is already there. You can only loose stuff if you go erase the disk first before installing. \nTalking about re-installing, can you not install a later version of OSX? Maybe High sierra?\n", "Q: How to bind Alt-p to up arrow instead of π Mac binds alt-p and alt-n to π and ˜.  How to make it behave as up and down arrow?\n\nA: Normally we use ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict file to customize some keys.\n{\n    \"~p\" = \"moveUp:\";\n    \"~n\" = \"moveDown:\"; /* not really works */\n}\n\nHowever I found it does not work for alt-n.\nWould you consider to use ctrl-p and ctrl-n instead? It is of standard emacs/readline key combination.\n", "Q: Can I re-download the Songs of Innocence download I once had without an Apple Music subscription? I used to have the U2, Songs of Innocence album on my phone, that was a free download from Apple in 2014. (This was slightly controversial at the time.)\nI can't see it on my iPhone X, running 13.3 in Apple Music App under music or purchases. Nor can I see it in the iTunes app under downloads or purchases on my phone. \nThe instructions on Apple's website, from the linked help page, indicate that having Apple Music enabled is a pre-requisite for downloading it. I don't have Apple Music enabled. \nThis came out prior to Apple Music. I don't understand why it would be associated with it. \nIn addition, I can see the Songs of Innocence Album on my phone using iMazing under Music, looking as if it needs to be downloaded from the Cloud. \n\nMy question is: Can I re-download the Songs of Innocence download I once had without an Apple Music subscription?\n\nA: You can download it without an Apple Music subscription, provided you had an iPhone at the release time in 2014 and still have the same Apple account. \nFor this this was:\nMusic App -> Library -> Artists -> U2 -> Songs of Innocence -> Download. \n\n", "Q: How to permanently unhide the Users Library folder in Catalina I would like to permanently unhide the /Users/<myname>/Library folder so that it is always viewable in a new Finder window.

The Show Library option only appears when you're in exactly the right folder.\n\nA: On the command line it's:\nchflags nohidden ~/Library && xattr -d com.apple.FinderInfo  ~/Library\n\nNo need to kill Finder.app!\n\nBoth commands (chflags ... & xattr ...) remove a \"hide flag\" here. Especially the second command  - the first one is well known already - removes the extended attribute com.apple.FinderInfo of the user's Library folder with the content: 0000000000000000400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 which - when applied like this - hides files and folders immediately.\nIn return you can hide files and folders by applying:\nxattr -wx com.apple.FinderInfo \"0000000000000000400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\" foo.bar\n\nIf the file or folder already has an extended attribute com.apple.FinderInfo (e.g. a single color tag) it will be overwritten. \nApparently you can combine tags/flags in com.apple.FinderInfo and:\nxattr -wx com.apple.FinderInfo \"0000000000000000400400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\" foo.bar\n\nwill hide the file and apply a green tag.\n", "Q: Where to find older versions of iTunes?

I can no longer launch many apps with Spotlight: Terminal.app, Mail.app, Calendar.app, the dictionary, etc.\nSome apps do launch, like Safari and Numbers.\nIt appears that there are now two Applications areas, and it seems that Spotlight doesn't index any that are in the /System/Applications area.\nI have tried adding and removing the /System/Applications directory from the privacy settings of Spotlight (apparently supposed to cause Spotlight to re-index an area), rebooting, clearing PRAM, and the following commands:\nsudo mdutil -E /\nsudo mdutil -E /System\nsudo mdutil -E /System/Applications\n\nAll of which has been to no avail.\nI haven't been able to find similar complaints online. Is this just affecting me? Or is this a general problem with Catalina?\nIf just me, what else can I try to diagnose or solve this?\nEdit (update):\nOK, I tried the following sequence, suggested in the comments below:\nsudo mdutil -i off -a\nsudo mdutil -i on -a\n\nThen I repeated it and removed a Spotlight file while it was off (still without success):\nsudo mdutil -i off -a\nsudo rm -fr /System/Volumes/Data/.Spotlight-V100\nsudo mdutil -i on -a\n\nCan anyone comment if Spotlight is working for them on Catalina to launch apps under /System/Applications (e.g., Terminal.app)? I still don't know if this is my problem or a general Catalina problem.\n\nA: This is a rare situation, but I’ve had great success making a new volume sharing the same APFS container and reinstalling a clean OS in a new volume to validate it’s not your disk that’s failing(failed). It’s not at all unique to Catalina and Catalina works great for spotlight in hundreds of machines we have. We’re seeing fewer spotlight issues compared to older OS in fact.\n\nBack to what you can do - installing a new OS to the same container (to test). I would back up all your important filed before poking anymore, just in case. Once you have that system set up you can let spotlight run on the new OS and convince yourself it’s just that you have corrupt data on the old volume.\nOnce you know you have a working system, you can run some apps or just run Migration Assistant to bring the files over. If you lack space to have two copies of everything - boot to the old systems and clean / run a Time Machine backup and restore from there (or just erase and install if you already have a backup) knowing things will be fixed.\nThe commands you list are nice if they work once, but running them several times rarely patches up a system that’s broken in my experience so the sooner you can delete / walk away from the corrupt data / files / filesystem, the better.\nIf you really need to isolate the failure, I would run mddiagnose and review the files - it’s a ton of work the first 5 to 10 times you try to understand all the diagnostic files - like finding a needle in a haystack, but most failures can be identified from the diagnostic output. \n", "Q: How does Time Machine encrypt backups to network disk? I see other questions regarding encrypting Time Machine backups to external disks, like this one:\nIf I encrypt a Time Machine backup disk, is the entire disk encrypted or just the Backups.backupdb directory?\nThere it says the entire disk is encrypted.\nBut for a network disk, I find it hard to believe that Time Machine can encrypt the disk. For example, is remote encryption of an entire disk possible via SMB?\nOf course, Time Machine still supports encryption to a network drive, so then what exactly is it doing?\n\nA: Neither the remote disk nor the remote volume is encrypted by Time Machine. Instead a special \"sparse bundle (disk image)\" (\"backupbundle\" for Catalina) is created on the network drive. In fact it's no uniform disk image file like a dmg but a special folder containing sub-folders and config/log files.\nThe content of the source volume(s) is saved as AES-128-encrypted band (or chunk) files in the bands folder. \nThe password is merged into a special file named token in the backupbundle.\n\nThe remote disk or volume could be encrypted independently though. This depends on the (TM-)server config. \n", "Q: What's the meaning of \"These photos will also be deleted from Photo Stream on all your devices\"? I have iCloud Photos, and for a period had iCloud enabled on my iPhone (6, 12.1.2). Then I had disabled iCloud on the phone to free space. Some photos still stayed on the phone and I didn't delete them for a while. Now after some time again my storage is full on the phone and I wanted to delete these photos, which all perfectly synced to Photos on my other Macs, and which I'd assumed are only local copies. \nBUT when I tried deleting them I got this message: \"These photos will also be deleted from Photo Stream on all your devices\". I've checked and Photo Stream is disabled on the phone. It's not clear to me how things work and why I'm getting this message.\nCan I safely delete these photos without deleting them from Photos across all devices?\n\nA: I suggest that you have a separate folder on an external drive for all photos as a backup.\nI do this and even if I make a mistake between any device and iCloud I still have the originals.\nWhen it warns you that the photos will be removed across all devices then it is best to believe it and make sure.\n\nA: Your photo library is independent of the photo stream. So is opting in to iCloud storage of your photo library.\nThe only overlap is if you import items from the photo stream into the library. Deleting an item from the photo stream does not delete it from any library so it's safe to delete if you're sure you already have it imported or never want it imported.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201317\nSince everything gets deleted automatically from the stream, you're just accelerating that for the ones you choose to purge early.\n", "Q: Does keyboard maestro have a trace/verbose log?

Am I understanding this right?  Maybe this name and age will not always show up?  Maybe it can be overwritten by display names and other settings?  What are the limits and flexibilities here?  For example, I want that when my child is using iMessage, Facetime etc it shows up with child's name, not mine. \n1b) Use child's First name, Last name and fake birthday of 13+.  What are the negative consequences of this approach?  \n1c) Use child's First name, Last name and fake birthday of 18+\nWhat are the negative consequences of this approach?  \nIs there option 3) that I haven't considered?  ... For example, one thing that came to mind is that I could do option 1) and then create child's account from the iPad, signout of apple ID and then re-sign in with the child account.  Seems like it would work, but has anyone tried it? What could go wrong with that approach?\nMy biggest concern is that these days it seems like apple ID is used as a proof of ownership (more than having the actual device in my hands) and by messing with birth dates and such it will create some hassle later on in the device's life cycle: device lost, password resets, sale, etc etc\nAlso, apple ID seems to be connected to device's serial number.  If I have multiple accounts linked to single serial number like option 3) is that going to create a problem?  \nNote that I do not plan to enter my credit card in any scenario, so I'm not worried about child making unauthorized charges.   If I do, it will be very rarely ... maybe once per year (and then I would remove the credit card info again)\nI have a feeling that there is no \"best way\" and I will have to choose between different trade-offs.   What are those trade-offs to be aware of?   What would you do if you were me?   \nThank you\n\nA: You will have the least headaches to bribe (or make time) to wipe the device - and set yourself up as the Family Owner using your own Apple ID.\nTo start, just use parental controls and have the child come to you for authorization. Once you have gotten a few purchases in, maybe with a $25 gift card - then consider if you can approve purchases from an inexpensive used iPad with your credentials or via email from your device of choice and then put your child’s account in as a managed / family / child account.\nYou can set up your family at https://appleid.apple.com once you register yourself first on the device. Put in your charge card, address, and save your security questions - make sure your cellular and recovery email are safe and operational if you go two factor auth.\nYou asked about 5 great questions in the original post, so hopefully this is enough to get you started. Take the time to set up your account, then make a family and create the child accounts. You will be super glad you spent the time to use the managed route.\n", "Q: getting `pip` to use `python3` instead of macOS-supplied python2? I don't really know much about python or pip so this may be an easy question but I’ve looked around and don’t really see an easy to understand solution, and the deadline is coming up soon, so it seems like it would be a good time to get a guide together.\nRecently when I was using pip I saw this warning:\n\nDEPRECATION: Python 2.7 will reach the end of its life on January 1st, 2020. Please upgrade your Python as Python 2.7 won't be maintained after that date. A future version of pip will drop support for Python 2.7. More details about Python 2 support in pip, can be found at https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/development/release-process/#python-2-support\n\nMy understanding is that there is no way to upgrade the version of python provided by macOS, either in /usr/bin/python or /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python2.7.\nI have /usr/local/bin/python3 installed via brew but I have no idea how to tell pip to use that version of python instead of the macOS-provided version, or if that will break anything, etc.\n\nA: There is no way to overwrite the existing System python(s) with newer versions. (Catalina comes with a version of python3.)\nThe command pip3 will specify that you want to install modules to python3. \npython2 will of course continue to work after 1st Jan, and many people still have lots of scripts that they will continue to run.\n", "Q: Why doesn't the iMac Pro (2017) support the Apple Pro Display XDR at 6k resolution? Apple's Set up and use Apple Pro Display XDR web page does not list the iMac Pro as a supported computer in this section:\n\nPro Display XDR supports a resolution of 6016 x 3384 with 10bpc on\n  these Mac models:\n\nHowever, it does list as supported:\n\nMac computers with Thunderbolt 3 ports connected to Blackmagic eGPU or\n  Blackmagic eGPU Pro\n\nApple's Use Blackmagic eGPU with your Mac web page states:\n\nBlackmagic eGPU includes a Radeon Pro 580 graphics processor with 8GB\n  DDR5 memory, giving your connected Mac graphics performance that's\n  similar to a high-end 27-inch iMac.\nBlackmagic eGPU Pro includes a Radeon RX Vega 56 graphics processor\n  with 8GB HBM2 memory.

The signal can be sent directly using USB-C, or as Thunderbolt.\n\n*A GPU that supports two DisplayPort 1.4 connections at HBR3 speed without DSC. The GPU needs to be connected to a Titan Ridge Thunderbolt controller that can transmit both of those DisplayPort 1.4 singals over Thunderbolt.\nThe iMac Pro has a GPU that can support 6K without DSC, but it has an Alpine Ridge Thunderbolt controller that can only transmit DisplayPort 1.2 signals (but if it can't transmit DisplayPort 1.4, then how does the iMac Pro transmit 3840x2160 at 60Hz with the USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter when the adapter only has two DisplayPort 1.4 lanes?).\nGPUs that support DSC are Nvidia RTX (Windows only), AMD 5300M, 5500M, 5700XT, W5700X, W5700. The W5700 has a USB-C port but I don't know if it works in macOS. The RTX cards have a USB-C port which allows 6K to work in Windows.\nThe Blackmagic eGPU doesn't support DSC, but it has a GPU that supports two DisplayPort 1.4 connections at HBR3 speed. The GPU's outputs are connected internally to the Titan Ridge chip in the Blackmagic eGPU which transmits the DisplayPort data over Thunderbolt to the Thunderbolt display that is connected to the eGPU. However, support for dual HBR3 connection (for 6K) requires a firmware update that was recently released by Blackmagic. Otherwise, it only supports dual HBR2 (allows only 5K).\nOther computers that have a GPU that doesn't support DSC but does support dual DisplayPort 1.4 might be able to connect to the XDR display using a GC-TITAN RIDGE to achieve 6K. However, this might have a problem similar to the Blackmagic eGPU and therefore might require a firmware update that might not exist yet and might not ever exist. When I try to connect two HBR3 displays to the same Thunderbolt port of a GC-TITAN RIDGE, one connects at only HBR speed. I have not tried the firmware update from October. I doubt that it addresses this problem.\nI do not know if the EDID of the XDR display contains enough information for dual HBR3 tiled mode to work in other OSs besides macOS. Specifically, the EDIDs that I have do not contain a 3008x3384 timing even though they specify a tile of that dimension. This might be because I've only seen EDIDs for dual HBR2 5K and HBR2 DSC 6K modes. The missing timing info exists in the mtdd files for the XDR display at /System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides/DisplayVendorID-610\nwhere DisplayProductID is one of ae21, ae22, ae23, ae2d, ae2e, ae2f.\nTo obtain DisplayPort connection info, use the following command:\n/System/Library/Extensions/AppleGraphicsControl.kext/Contents/MacOS/AGDCDiagnose -a > AGDCDiagnose_a.txt 2>&1\nThere is also a command specifically created for the XDR display\n/System/Library/Extensions/AppleGraphicsControl.kext/Contents/MacOS/DisplayDiagnose -a > DisplayDiagnose.txt 2>&1\n", "Q: Fresh Install OS vs Install Update On New User I'd like to ask if there's a difference between:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fresh installing Catalina using Flash Drive.\n\n*Create a new admin user, logout the current user, login the new admin user and delete all the existing users and their files. Then from there, install the Catalina by download.\n\n\nWill there be a huge difference? In terms of disk space and speed of the machine after installing the Catalina?\nI feel like the #2 (my usual way) is more practical in terms of time consumption and effort.\n\nA: A \"Fresh install\" usually means erasing the target volume of all files, and then installing an OS, thus removing any possible problems from third-party installed software, and incorrect or inappropriate settings in /Library or /User/Library .plist files.\nSimply deleting all the files in one or more user accounts will not remove third-party applications, their /Library files, other installed processes, and things like printer drivers. \nSo, the latter will keep more data on your drive than a fresh install. Speed is unlikely to be affected, unless your drive was full.\nI can't think of a reason why deleting user accounts would be a useful process.\nBy default, Apple's system installation process upgrades the existing OS, and retains all user files, settings, applications, etc in place. Some listed items, known to be incompatible, are removed by the installer to folders where they are not launched by the OS.\nAs Apple releases a new OS every year (or every 2 months if you count the point updates): 'slashing and burning' all your settings, files, and applications is entirely unnecessary. (I have updated in place every OS from 10.2 Jaguar to 10.15 Catalina, and cloned my disks across more than six Macs. I dare say there's some 'cruft' from my 2002 G3 iBook now sitting on my 2018 Mini!)\nI would recommend only doing a clean install, or other similar process, if you get some problem occurring after upgrading. Alternatively, with a bit of detective work, you can usually find out the 1% of your files that are causing the problem, and then delete those, rather than the removing 100% and putting 99% back.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to sleep a Mac's touchbar I am looking for a quick way to make the touchbar go to sleep, without having to wait.\nWhen I use my computer in a dark environment I don’t know how to disable the bright touchbar. I just want to see what’s on the screen, no extraneous information is needed.\n\nA: tl;dr: You can get a shortcut/script/service to revert Touch Bar to work as normal F keys. This is very close to a normal keyboard, with backlight on, in the night. \nI used this answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/18752770/10063119 to get the code from the Automator’s “watch me do“.\nOpen Automator, choose a new “workflow” and keep System Preferences in the dock. Hit the red record button and use System Preferences to disable the fancy Touch Bar and set it to the normal F keys.\nSelect all steps in the workflow and paste in Script Editor app. Then you can edit it to your need, bind it to keyboard shortcut in System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts.
