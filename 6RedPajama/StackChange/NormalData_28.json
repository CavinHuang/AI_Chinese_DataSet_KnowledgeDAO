["Q: Adobe Acrobat Pro on Macbook Pro scrolls very slow Whenever I open a PDF in Adobe Acrobat Pro (version of Adobe Creative Cloud) on my Macbook Pro (early 2013 Retina version with NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M 1024 MB) scrolling through the document is unacceptably slow.\nIn terms of 'frames per second' it would be about 2 fps when scrolling.\nDoes anyone have a suggestion on how to improve the speed of this? I expect it to run about as smooth as scrolling/viewing a webpage.\nEdit: added summary from comments below:\n\nIt happens with any PDF, no big difference between 'text only' PDF or one build up with images. Text PDF example: http://www.vivin.net/pub/pdfjs/TestDocument.pdf - still renders too slow.\nAlso tried with the laptop of a colleague, same Macbook model, same specs, same Acrobat -> same behavior :) I'm amazed why that is so slow. When I open the PDF in Chrome, it is fast (because Chrome has pdfjs integrated, a different viewer). However, I want to solve it with Acrobat.\n\n\nA: Kill all smoothing options in \"page Display\" preferences, besides \"for laptop/LCD screens\", and set a custom resolution to 90 ppi. Then speed picks up nicely.\n\nA: You have to turn on Enable Scrolling from the View menu. I also had that issue before.\n\nA: Acrobat Reader and Pro are bloated. Apple's Preview runs circles around it and that doesn't make sense being Adobe's own Reader and file format should work flawlessly (by now). Pro can do more things like make PDF forms. But ever since Acrobat 5, it's become an overly large Application that runs unacceptably slow.\nPDFs were originally intended for books. Later functionally was added for PDF forms, archiving records, printing and prepress. They are doing too much with it and there about almost 20 versions of the PDF file format if your include PDF/X, PDF/A, PDF/E, PDF/VT and PDF/UA in addition to PDF 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.6, 1.7 2004, 1.7 2006, 1.7 2008, 1.7 2009, 1.7 2011, 1.8, and 1.9.\nIt's a shame that Adobe can't tame this its own wild beast. Adobe PhotoShop CC and Illustrator CC are excellent. Indesign CC is good with the exception that its Alpha Channel form of PDF transparency is not compatible with Firefox's builtin PDF plugin. Indesign's drop shadows will come out as boxes in both Dropbox and Firefox's internal PDF viewers. As a stone age workaround, you can use PDF 1.3 to flatten the file, but then you face unwanted lines in the web view. InDesign drop shadows have always worked in the inverse of Illustrator's drop shadow transparency which doesn't make any sense with software coming from the same vendor and both were created from scratch (to the best of my knowledge the source code to these two apps were not bought from another company). Adobe needs to get a grip on PDF. It has been too long.\nAdobe Indesign was designed to become a QuarkXpress killer. But they lost sight on how its transparency should work and things like Rasterize and Keyline view were omitted. So if you need those additional tools, you have to copy and paste the elements into Illustrator. Turn on PDF in Adobe's clipboard past preferences , do you edits in AI then copy them to InDesign via the clipboard. Waste of time to get decent looking online PDFs from InDesign. It is best to not use Acrobat and InDesign and just use Preview as your viewer or Firefox, and use Illustrator to create decent PDFs that have transparency.\n", "Q: MacPort : Is a given package a dependecy for another one ? My MacPort package are becoming the huge mess. I probably won't use some of them and I was wondering how I could know if a given package is a dependecy for another one. \nFor example I have GTK3 installed. How could I know which other installed package needs GTK3. \n\nA: From Macports guide You can list all the ports dependent on a port x say\nport echo depends:x\n\nTo find ports that have no dependants use \nport echo leaves\n\n", "Q: Read .iwa files from Pages Pages has crashed, my file is now corrupted and I'm trying to get the text from this file.\nif I Right click on the file > Show package content > open index.zip , I can see a bunch of .iwa files which seems to contains my original text, especially \"Document.iwa\".\nIf I \"$ nano Document.iwa\" (because \"$ file\" only returns \"data\") I can see some of my text, but the overall seems crypted.\nDoes anyone know how to decode/read this kind of .iwa file or recover corrupted files?\n\nA: At GitHub obriensp/iWorkFileFormat there exists some work on reverse engineering the format and they have published results there.\nBasically, the .iwa files are Protobuf streams compressed using Snappy.\nThere was also a question on Stack Overflow about the format:\nReverse engineering iWork '13 formats\n\nA: I previously had an issue with one of the new Pages docs that I was able to 'fix' by opening it at iCloud.com. You might try that. The new format is a pain being binary though it does make the syncing between iDevices and Macs easy.\n", "Q: odd behavior of pgrep in bash script I have a script to kill a process tree that works fine in linux but I am experiencing some odd behaviour on osx. It actually works fine with my unit tests and also when trying to run it manually on osx, but for some reason when it runs as a jenkins job it acts differently.\nSo this is the current bash function with a bit of debug echo and sleeps:\nkilltree() {\n  local _pid=$1\n  local _sig=${2:--TERM}\n  echo \"Stopping ${_pid}\"\n  sleep 1\n  kill -stop ${_pid} # stop parent to avoid creation of new children\n  children=`pgrep -P ${_pid}`\n  echo \"Children=$children\"\n  sleep 1\n  for _child in $children; do\n      killtree ${_child} ${_sig}\n  done\n  echo \"Killing child ${_pid}\"\n  sleep 1\n  kill -${_sig} ${_pid}\n}\n\nThe call to pgrep that from a failing run can be pgrep -P 9651 prints out all processes on the machine, and the scripts hangs when it try to kill pid 0.\nBut why would it get all processes ? When the run is done process 9651 is still running and if I issue the command on the command line pgrep -P 9651 there is no output at all (which is expected since this process should have no children).\nI added a debug call to print the process tree right before listing children:\n+ pstree='-+= 00001 root /sbin/launchd\n \\-+= 09774 root /usr/sbin/sshd -i\n   \\-+- 09777 jenkins /usr/sbin/sshd -i\n     \\-+= 09783 jenkins bash -c cd '\\''/var/jenkins'\\'' && java  -jar slave.jar\n       \\-+- 09784 jenkins /usr/bin/java -jar slave.jar\n         \\-+- 09807 jenkins /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_21.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/bin/java -classpath/     \n          \\-+- 09817 jenkins /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_21.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/bin/java -\n            \\--- 09828 jenkins sleep 10'\n\nLooks normal to me, the sleep 10 have no children.\nAny ideas - I am a bit stuck after having tried to debug this for some hours ?\nThe process that is trying to be killed is in this case a simple sleep 10 that is used for testing.\n\nA: Where are you getting your version of pgrep from?\nThe version I have from MacPorts is coded such that if you do not supply a pattern it will match all processes even if you have qualifiers such as the -P option.\nWhen I issue pgrep -P<ppid> I get a full list of processes.  If add a pattern as in pgrep -P<ppid> \\. then it works as expected only providing processes with the given ppid.\nAs to the behavior difference, maybe you have a couple versions of pgrep on your machine and the jenkins jobs have a different PATH so are finding a different version?\nFrom terminal window you can look for multiple versions with:\nmdfind -name pgrep\n\nI also suggest you compare the PATH variable used in the job vs. interactive.\nTo view which file the shell will use, you can use type -p pgrep and type -a pgrep will show all places in the PATH where pgrep can be found.\n", "Q: Parallels, Mac and windows using US International keyboard I am currently using Windows 8.1 in parallels under Mac OS X Mavericks.\nOn both Mac and Windows I use US International since I need the special danish chars æ, ø and å. \nThese chars are placed differently on the mac layout and the windows layout. \nThis is very confusing!\nIs there a way to make them the same - the mac placement is to prefer?\n\nA: I found the answer here:\nhttp://forum.parallels.com/showthread.php?265348-How-to-get-same-keyboard-layout-in-Windows-8-as-on-Mac\nBasically I had to find an apple keyboard for US International and use it.\n", "Q: how to set mac desktop background as working terminal I would like to set my background to a working Terminal window even when I minimize all applications.

I pay for iTunes Match, but it's disabled on my phone. (It has been enabled in the past.)\nWhat can I do to fix the art?\n\nA: The \"awesome\" thing is, that if you want to have the right Coverart in your iPhone you are obligated to buy your music in the iTunes store, else it messes the Coverart up (even though it is the correct one in iTunes). Bottomline: neither Amazon mp3 nor imported CD (no matter if original or not) will have the right cover in your iPhone.\nThanks apple for this great new feature !\n\nA: i know this sounds silly but go into your settings into music and try unchecking \"show all music\"\n\nA: I don't think this is a problem with iTunes showing the wrong artwork because you didn't buy the music from them.\nIt seems like they have artist artwork and album artwork. It makes sense if you have multiple albums by the same artist; which 'album art cover' should it use to represent the artist?\nNow if you only have one album for an artist, it does seem a little messed up that they aren't using that cover, especially when you are scrolling through artists and expecting to see that cover.\n", "Q: Disabling Java plug-in globally? After following the instructions in this answer (briefly: Java prefs pane → Security → disable \"Enable Java content in the browser\") to disable the Java plug-in globally, I'm presented with an admin password prompt dialog, followed in turn by this dialog:\n\nHow do I change this setting for all users?\n\nA: The answer is at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/jcp/properties.html (Java 7) and http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/deploy/properties.html (Java 8), though the instructions could be more explicit.\nThey say to set the deployment.webjava.enabled to false in your deployment.properties file, whose location is defined by the deployment.system.config property in the file ${deployment.java.home}/lib/deploy/deployment.config.\nI found that you can just create deployment.properties in ${deployment.java.home}/lib, which I guess is a default location.\nThis raises the question of what the value of ${deployment.java.home} is, and it's not what I expected. I'm using OS X 10.7.5, and the value of deployment.java.home for me is /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home.\nI created a deployment.properties file there with the contents:\ndeployment.webjava.enabled=false\ndeployment.webjava.enabled.locked=true\n\nNow, when I open the Java Control Panel and go to the security tab, I see this:\n\nThere is that nagging \"Only disabled for this user\" still, but I think that's just a UI bug.

My old computer (the one originally with the backed up music) died on me, so iTunes wont backup music from my iPod to the computer. So I am forced to either use a 3rd party transfer software or transfer the music from the iPod's file system. Attempting a backup either of these ways results in errors that prevent the computer from transfering 95% of the music. The 3rd party software offers no information about the error, but copy/pasting from the iPod file system to the PC returns the following errors:\nerror code 0x80070022 (first error message)\nerror code 0x80070057 (subsequent error messages for 95% of music files attempting to be copied)\nIf I try transferring through the iPod's file system on my Macbook Pro, I get error code -36.\nI've tried restarting both the PC and iPod, and I've also tried the transfer in safe mode and copy-pasting files instead of just dragging a whole folder from ipod to computer. All attempts eventually have the same resulting error messages. I've even tried to transfer files onto a Linux machine to cover all bases. Most of the  12,000 songs on the iPod were ripped long ago from CDs I own. I've also painstakingly rated every one of these songs. I'm very worried that one day my iPod will crap out on me and the ratings will be gone forever and I'll have to spend tons of time reripping those CDs again. I've also googled this problem and have found little help.\nOther details - this iPod was originally set up on a WinXP PC. Additionally, I should note that I have no problems connecting to iTunes or playing any of the music files. These errors are only preventing me from copying music files to my PC or Mac.\nThank you in advance!\n\nA: The only thing I can currently think of would be swapping out the cable at this point and seeing if performance improves. You've tried on different computers, so that kind of rules out fault with the PC/Mac. It has to be something with the iPod, and the cable is the first thing I'd check.\n", "Q: KeePass application with synchronization support on a Mac? I'm looking for a KeePass application for use on Mac OSX. \nKeePassX and KyPass 3 but both lack support for synchronization of KeePass 2 (.kdbx) databases.\n\n\n*\n\n*KeePassX will just plain overwrite the database. \n\n*KyPass 3 will do you the courtesy of alerting you of a potential data loss before overwriting a database.\n\n*KeePass is a third option, but I have't not been able to get the application to work, let alone test synchronization.\n\n\nWhat Mac OS X apps support synchronization of the kdbx database that stores credentials in this open source format?\n\nA: MacPass is an open-source KeePass client for OS X that is able to sync KDBX files.  I came across this looking for an answer to this question myself, finding no real satisfactory answers elsewhere.\n\nA: The problem is the .kdbx-file. \nThe solution is to download and install KeePass Classic 1.27 on your Windows machine, which still saves the database file in the older .kdb format. This .kdb file can be cross-opened in both Keepass Classic and KeePassX on your Mac.\nTo make them synced across devices I would recommed using Dropbox in which you save your .kdb database file. Obviously this is not a real-time syncing application so you cannot have the apps open on all devices at the same time and see the changes. It is a save-close-sync procedure inbetween. However it works flawlessly this way.\nEqually, now this dropbox-synced .kdb-file now works on iOS through the excellent little PassDrop app :-)\n", "Q: Preserve scroll position when navigating back/forward in Safari? It seems we've been spoiled by other browsers, but sometimes you just can't use them (like for viewing Apple videos).\nWhen I hit back/forward in Safari, then immediately I lose my place on the page. Is there an option to make Safari remember your page scroll position like every other browser?\n\nA: It appears as though you're running into the \"continuous scrolling\" nightmare, which has become popular in recent times.\nOn all \"regular\" websites, this is not an issue from Safari 6+ and since at least Lion.\nThe problem is that some websites load a page, then when you reach the bottom of that page, it loads the next page below the current one. This is meant to be useful, but in the majority of cases it breaks navigation, since the page reloads on navigation.\nThere is no solution to this mess, other than to disable continuous scrolling, if the webpage you're accessing gives you that option.\n", "Q: Remove entire time machine backup on external drive I recently acquired a macbook pro with Leopard installed. All other software had been removed before I purchased it. I wanted to install Snow Leopard. The advice I received was to be safe I should backup up the current system before installing.

I want to add a user to the Administrators group but none of the built-in groups show up under Accounts -> Groups on OS X Server. \nHow can I manage users in the Administrators group?\n\nA: The most common use of admin with Server.app is to run server.app and administer the server itself.\nIf that's what you want, use Server.app to tick the administer this server box:\n\n", "Q: Replace Text Edit as the default text editor I've seen questions like this which don't quite solve my problem.\nI'd like to make Sublime Text 3 the default file viewer/editor for all files that currently use textedit.\nMost of these files can be command+i'd, but the ones that have no extension cannot. They give all sorts of permissions errors such as the ones in this image \nIs there any way to just never use textedit, and instead set sublime as the default editor for all files?\n\nA: To set Sublime Text as the default handler for public.plain-text:\nMavericks (10.9) and earlier\ndefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices \\\n    LSHandlers -array-add \\\n    '{LSHandlerContentType=public.plain-text;LSHandlerRoleAll=com.sublimetext.3;}'\n\n\nYosemite (10.10) and later\nUse com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.\ndefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure \\\n    LSHandlers -array-add \\\n    '{LSHandlerContentType=public.plain-text;LSHandlerRoleAll=com.sublimetext.3;}'\n\nRemember to restart to pick up the changes.\n\nA: I centralize all my default apps management with Magic Launch. You can configure it to open all txt with Sublime Text as default without command line (beside, you can change it easily from System Preferences).\n\nOne more exceptional useful Magic Launch’s feature is you can set rules based on filename, folders location, which I use intensively to choose different apps for development and writing.\n\nA: I tried grg's solution in the past and I believe it worked.  However, on Yosemite and El Capitan, I ran into problems.\nDonnaLea's comment in that solution clued me in on creating a solution.  I added the folder path before com.apple.launchservices additionally the file had a slightly different name com.apple.launchservices.secure.\nYou can see the file/folders being modified in the following path:\n/user/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist\n\nScreenshot for reference:\n\nHere's the command I used in terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure LSHandlers -array-add \\\n'{LSHandlerContentType=public.plain-text;LSHandlerRoleAll=com.sublimetext.3;}'\n\nLastly, after a restart to my machine it worked as advertised.\n\nA: *\n\n*Right click on a .txt file in Finder.\n\n*Choose \"Get Info\".\n\n*Expand \"Open with:\" and choose your preferred text editor in the\ndrop-down.\n\n*Push the \"Change All...\" button below the drop-down and then confirm\nin the dialog that pops up with \"Continue\".\n\n\nThis works on Yosemite (OS X 10.10). \n\nA: RCDefaultApp still works on macOS Sierra. You can easily select what program is default for plain text (BBEedit in my case). \n\n\nA: The solutions proposed here work perfectly for Sublime, but I wanted to do this for Visual Studio Code. The only difference is that you have to find the \"application bundle identifier\" for whatever text editor you use. I ran this command:\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Print CFBundleIdentifier' /Applications/Visual\\ Studio\\ Code.app/Contents/Info.plist \n\nlink for reference\nto get the identifier \"com.microsoft.VSCode\". Then I installed \"duti\" and ran this command:\nduti -s com.microsoft.VSCode public.plain-text all\n\nThis should work for any text editor you want that is installed under /Applications. I hope this helps non-Sublime users.\n\nA: Another option is to use duti (https://github.com/moretension/duti).\nRun brew install duti, save a filetype like this as:\nduti -s com.sublimetext.4 public.plain-text all\n\nThe changes should be applied immediately, so you don't have to restart like when editing com.apple.LaunchServices.plist.\nTo also change the default application for executable scripts with no filename extension, add a line like this:\nduti -s com.sublimetext.4 public.unix-executable all\n\nSome files are also considered 'public.data', not 'public.plain-text', so you can do this as well:\nduti -s com.sublimetext.4 public.data all\n\n\nA: I am using Catalina 10.15.6.  Taking the following two steps worked for me.\nSave SublimeText files with \".txt\" extension by default\n\n*\n\n*Open SublimeText.\n\n*Go to SublimeText > Preferences > Settings.\n\n*Add the following line into the \"Preferences.sublime-settings--User\" file:  \"default_extension\": \"txt\",\n\n*Save and close the updated settings file.\n\nConfigure your Mac to open all \".txt\" files with SublimeText by default\n[Follow these steps, as posted by David Resnick in a prior answer]\n\n*\n\n*Right click on a .txt file in Finder.\n\n*Choose \"Get Info\".\n\n*Expand \"Open with:\" and choose your preferred text editor in the drop-down.\n\n*Push the \"Change All...\" button below the drop-down and then confirm in the dialog that pops up with \"Continue\".\n\n\nA: First do get info on the file that you want to set sublime text as the default. Then go to the open as section and choose sublime. After that press change all then continue on the popup menu and you're done\n\n\nA: Rightclick on the file --> Other --> Choose your favorite text editor (I choose Sublime text in my Applications folder) --> Check the 'Always Open with' checkbox --> Open.\nThis setting will be automatically applied to all other files in the machine.\nNo need of any restart or no need of any 3rd party software.\n\nA: This solution is ripped from a YouTube video, but it works perfectly for my situation (I'm just using Sublime to edit files in languages like Python, Java, and Ruby).\nFor any particular file, right-click, select \"More Info\", and click on the \"Open with\" tab. You can select what text-editor you want here, and use \"Change-all\" to use the editor for all files of this type. Obviously, this doesn't work for files with no extension, but it's been an easy quick-fix for me.\n", "Q: How to copy plain text from web pages in Safari?

Weirdly I was not able to find anything online. I do not have access to a different Apple device or physical media.\n\nA: To install OS X Mavericks, the Apple ID that you enter must have Mavericks in the purchase history. If Mavericks is missing, the installer will not let you proceed.\nIf you had another machine, you could download Mavericks using your Apple ID so that it's registered with your Apple ID. If you even have access to a friend's Mac, you could use that to register the installer.\nIf that's not an option, you could go to the Apple Store, as was discussed over on ASC:\n\nI solved the problem by going to the apple store and they reset things for me by installing Snow Leopard on it again. It wasn't until my second visit though so yes they might take a while.\n\n\nA: In the future, your best bet would be to purchase Mavericks from the app store, run the installer, THEN wipe the drive and re-run the installer.\nRight now, you have 3 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Call apple, give them your Apple ID, and purchase Mavericks over the phone if they will let you.

(If there is an apple store nearby, this is the most likely to work).\n\n*Install an old operating system using the optical disks that came with your mac, then purchase Mavericks from the app store and run the installer.\n\n\nHow are you pulling up the \"Install OS X\" interface?\n", "Q: iPhone 5 iOS7 no sound only vibrates when ringing?

This seems to be a common issue and I will go to an Apple Store as soon as possible to get a new one. Is there a recommended serial number or part number I should look for?\nI currently have Part No. ME277KS/A and Serial No. F4KLV1G7FCM6.\n\nA: Don't bother getting a replacement, get a refund as it'll likely be the same and you'll see the same issues on their demo units if you have a keen eye like I do.  Detailed reply below...\nI have a space grey iPad Mini Retina 32GB WiFi/3G.  I also have the yellow tint on the lower half of the screen by the home button.  I've tried leaving it plugged in and set at 100% brightness for 4 days and the issue persists 6 weeks later.  I went into my local Apple Store and I could see that all the others on display were the same or even worse regardless if they were black or white bezels or what the serial number started with (mine is F4KM...).  It is a production issue that had been around for ages and Apple think it's now good enough for us not to notice but, a lot of us do!  It's not a glue curing issue and will not go away over time.\nI've even been to the genius bar and they can't acknowledge (or refuse to) the problem even after showing them photos, a clear white screen and the greyscale test which clearly shows the issue even under the store's lighting.\nI think Apple are clearly aware of this problem and just don't want to go through the expense and embarrassment of a recall affecting millions of units as only a few of us can see this widespread problem that appears to affect ALL retina iPads.  However, they will be forced to act once major magazines and consumer media start publishing these problems.\n\nA: To the answer above. I don't think it has anything to do with the glue in the case of ipad mini/air. Reason is because the LCD screen itself isn't fused to the glass panel. If you look at ifixit.com, it clearly shows that it isn't fused. Therefore glue isn't used in ipad mini nor the ipad air. \nHowever, it may be the case with the iphones since the LCD is fused to the glass. \nI recently purchased an ipad mini with retina display (exactly one month) and till now I have not noticed any issue but then I realized my entire screen had a yellow tinge (or I could be just seeing things). Now I don't know if I should take it to the apple store and have them take a look at it, but looks of it, they probably won't do anything and I probably won't waste my time. Knowing that the replacement unit that I will get might have a different issue. I'll just have to suck it up and deal with it.\n\nA: I've now been to the store and first of all, the demo units don't have any yellow tint. They opened two units and they had the yellow tint. The Apple employees also saw the tint and I will now see if the tint goes away after some usage.\nThe demo units serial no. started with DLXLL.\nBoth the person at Apple and one at another store suggested that the glue could be the issue and that it might go away after some usage. Which would make sense since the demo units are on all day.\n", "Q: Why BlueTooth is activated after updating the iOS? I noticed something while updating the iOS. After finishing the updating, I always find that BlueTooth is on and activated.  \nAny idea why Apple is doing that?\n\nA: Apple turns on Bluetooth because of iBeacon.

I have an iPhone 4 that I didn't upgrade to iO7 because I'd heard a lot of people saying it hurt the phone's performance, and my phone's performance was already pretty terrible.\nI've seen people saying that 7.1 is specifically faster for an iPhone 4, but only in comparison to iOs 7.0\nIf I upgrade my iphone 4 to 7.1 will it run better or worse? I use it as a backup device, mainly for music, so I'm ok doing without the improvements, but if I'm likely to get a performance improvement than I'm all over it.\n\nA: 7.1 is probably the best performance that you'll see on the iPhone 4. While the loading times for apps seems to be cut by a half a second or more for most, there's only so much you can do for a 4-year-old processor. I'd say the upgrade is well worth it. You won't see all the features that the 4S and 5 iterations see, but its still an increase in performance -- I'd say go for it.\n", "Q: Purchased music keeps appearing (iPhone 5, iOS 7.1) I have downloaded music directly from iTunes onto my iPhone from the app. The problem is some of the songs I don't want on my iPhone and I just do not have the space for it, and I would like to add different music to my iPhone. The problem is I have \"show all music\" unchecked, I also have \"automatically download music\" unchecked, as well as pretty much every answer that has been given online to resolve this problem. I don't use iCloud or iTunes match.\nI even closed the music by going to general > usage > music and deleting all of the data. That still didn't work. I even factory reset my phone, and once I sync my phone the purchased music will completely sync back onto my phone. I know it is only the purchased music, but seeing as I only have a 16GB iPhone, I absolutely NEED more space, and it is killing me that the only way to get rid of it is to manually delete each of the 500 individual songs by swiping left on the iPhone. \nIf anyone can help me I would really really appreciate it. I've spent countless hours being frustrated by my phone trying to get this music off in order to have space to add new music. \n\nA: Any songs I had in a playlist called \"purchased\" kept reappearing (Even after I deleted all music from the usage setting). Once I deleted that playlist they did not.\n\nA: It sounds like your problem is not the settings on your phone but rather the settings on your computer.\nSome options for what you might do:\n\n\n*\n\n*change settings in iTunes so that you do not automatically sync\n\n*change settings so that you only sync songs that are selected (check marked)\nin your iTunes library\n\n*delete songs from your iTunes library that you don't want on your phone\n\n*don't ever plug your device into the computer and manage your songs solely\nwith the phone\n\n\nHere are two pictures you might find helpful within iTunes:\nIn iTunes preferences, see Devices Preferences.\n\nAlso, after plugging in your device, select it from the iTunes menu or in the top right area of iTunes and scroll down to see some other options.\n\n\nA: I've just been through this and this is what worked for me:\nFirst make sure your phone is unplugged from iTunes on your computer.\nGo to the iTunes Store on your computer and hide all your purchased music. (Probably you just need to hide the music you don't want but I hid everything because you can still select the song manually to sync to your phone).\nThen on your phone:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > General > Usage > Music\n\n*\n\n*Then hit \"Edit\" and delete all of your music.\n\n\n*Go to Settings > Music and turn OFF \"Show all Music\"\n\n*Open Music and it should say \"No Content\"\n\n\nOnce the phone is clear you can Sync your phone to iTunes on your computer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: Under \"Summary\" on the iPhone tab in iTunes make sure at least \"Sync only checked songs\" is checked.\nUnder the \"Music\" tab make sure that \"Selected Playlists, artists, albums, and genres\" is checked.\n\n\nThat should make sure that only music you want makes it to your phone.\nHope this helps. \n\nA: I had the same problem! I did this : http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4919\nBefore I did that, I did delete all my music from the phone.   Settings>General>Usage>Music and under music I hit EDIT and deleted with the minus button.  \nIt worked. After hours of frustration over horrible purchases, I finally was able to remove all the songs I didn't want on my iphone. \n\nA: While the music does appear on your iPhone, did does not necessarily mean that it is taking up storage on your iPhone. I also have a 16 GB iPhone and was trying to delete my purchased music.\nWhat I found is that those songs are stored on Apple's server in iCloud and thus are available to you whenever you have an internet connection. As soon as you turn off Wifi and cellular data, however, the songs are no longer playable. This suggests that they are not on your iPhone's hard drive and therefore shouldn't be a problem for storage.\nGive this a try for yourself and see if your issue is the same as mine.\nSo in summary, your problem is not a problem at all, but in fact is kind of a nice feature. Songs free of storage.\n\nA: It seems odd that it's downloading the purchased music even though you have automatic downloads turned off.\nHowever, try connecting the phone to your computer and configuring the songs manually in iTunes. You can select only certain songs to sync, ask iTunes to \"only sync checked song and videos\" (this means if their checked in your Library, not in the sync window) and also \"manually manage music and videos\". Anything not selected, included the wanted purchased songs, will not be synced and should be removed from the device if their not specified to sync also. Have you tried this?\nHope this helps.\n\nA: had same problem.

It wouldn't show the screen so I kept inserting and removing the cable.. \nPlease feel free to be as technical as you want. I'm a CS major :)\n\nA: There is one troubleshooting step that OS X shares with the classic Mac OS, removing preference files. But on OS X there are TWO folders:\n/Library/Preferences and ~/Library/Preferences\n--The latter being in your user/home folder--\nSince the issue doesn't exist under another logon it is specific to that user folder. SO there is something specific to that user that is causing the problem. This takes the /Library/Preferences folder out of consideration for troubleshooting preferences. The first thing I would do is use a utility like Onyx to verify and clean the system. This includes verifying preferences files. After that rename the ~/Library/Preferences folder to something like \n~/Library/Preferences-old\nYou'll probably have to do that in Terminal and use sudo as those files are owned by another user on the system. then create a new ~/Library/Preferences folder and reboot.\nIf you can now log into that account it is a simple (HAH!) matter of putting preferences files in the new Preferences folder and rebooting till you find which one it is.\nNo guarantee, though, that it is a preference file, it could be a startup item. So do the same thing with the ~/Library/LaunchAgents folder.\nThe other thing to consider is that it might be easier to just create a new user folder. Copy the things you need out of the old user folder and delete the old user. That could save you a lot of troubleshooting time. It would be my preferred way of doing it (after running Onyx) as I care less about what happened than just finding a fix that gets me up and running more quickly.\n", "Q: Can I have two Time Machine partitions on one hard disk drive? I know that someone can use a partition on a hard disk drive for Time Machine, but is it possible to specify more than one partition on a single drive for this purpose? \nThe scenario: My partner and I want to share one physical HDD to back up our Macs, but we want completely separate encryption passwords for our backups.\nAnd if it is possible, is there a downside?\n\nA: It is definitely possible to partition a single drive into two partitions and have separate encrypted Time Machine backups on each partition for your two individual Macs.\nThe only downside is a single point of failure since there's a single physical drive used for two machines. If anything goes wrong with that disk, both the Macs would be left without usable backups. You could still go ahead with this approach, but it would be better if you have disk clones also done regularly on (additional) separate physical drives and/or use some online backup service for important data.\nFor more information on Time Machine and encrypted backups, see:\nTime Machine FAQ - How do I set up and use encrypted backups?\n", "Q: How to create a custom repeating reminder? I want a reminder that goes off on Mon, Tue, Wed and Thu at 5pm.  I haven't found a way to do that.

However, you can set an alarm in the Clock app that will go off at 5pm (or your chosen time) and you can select specific days like Mon, Tues, Wed, and Thu.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: i had the same Peoblem my Solution was to use an alarm clock instead of a Reminder\n", "Q: Mavericks installation stuck at 18 minutes mark I am trying to reinstall Mavericks an 27 inch, Mid-2011 iMac\nThe hardisk has been reformatted, and I have created one partition Mac-HDD in it.\nI have created a Mavericks usb installer using this command:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia \\\n--volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app --nointeraction\n\nCan you suggest anything I can try?\n\nA: You can show the install log by pressing cmd-L. Make sure you're showing all messages and look at the bottom of the log. This may give you a hint as to what's happened (or happening).\n\nA: You might also want to repartition the HD and then do a repair. It is possible you have some bad blocks on the HD and it needs to be replaced.\nYou could also do a secure wipe and do a one pass wipe with zeros, under security options.

I desperately would like to retrieve that file ASAP!\n\nA: Reading your question I doubt you have any backup, the data will be gone and you cannot recover it.\nTexting a voice-file is a pretty weird option IMO, as once it will be sent by the provider it won't be sent again to any device. (You don't receive all your text-messages again on a different phone, do you?)\n", "Q: Is there a quick way to relink my homebrew kegs? I just upgraded my MacBook Air to Mavericks.  The process appears to have removed almost all of the symlinks that homebrew put in /usr/local/bin.  As I notice things missing then I relink them via brew unlink <keg> && brew link <keg> (although the symlinks are gone, homebrew still thinks they are there so I need to unlink first).  This feels somewhat inefficient.\nI could just loop through everything in /usr/local/Cellar but not every keg is automatically linked and I don't want to link those.  So my next guess is to list every linked keg and relink them (using the above).\nIs there some magic command that will find all the kegs that homebrew thinks are linked so that I can relink them?\n\nA: In addition to the other answers to this question, you may also need to relink formula with multiple versions installed (brew link won't do this for you).\nFirst, relink all the formulas you can:\nbrew list -1 | while read line; do brew unlink $line; brew link --force $line; done\n\nThen run brew doctor, which should complain and give you two lists:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unlinked formulae with multiple versions\n\n*Keg-only formulae which have been incorrectly link by the original relinking process. \n\n\nFor each formula with multiple versions run the following, replacing \"python\" with the formula name:\nbrew info python  \n\nThis will show you, among other information, all installed versions. Choose which version you want to link (for me its 2.7.6), and use brew switch\nbrew switch python 2.7.6\n\nYou will also want to run brew unlink on the list (if any) of keg-only formulae that have been linked.\n\nA: This bash command (taken from there) will unlink all installed formulas and then link them again:\nbrew list -1 | while read line; do brew unlink $line; brew link $line; done\n\nI guess all formulas need to be linked, otherwise, whichever tool depends on them, won't be able to find them..\n\nA: /usr/local/Library/LinkedKegs seems to contain a list of, well, linked kegs, so this should do the trick:\nls -1 /usr/local/Library/LinkedKegs | while read line; do\n    echo $line\n    brew unlink $line\n    brew link --force $line\ndone\n\nI'd recommend ensuring you have write permissions to /usr/local/lib again before trying this.\n", "Q: How to make a small storage in my macbook to act as a USB stick?

This way I won't need to install drivers for every scanner I use.\nIs that possible? Is there a small app that can make it? Convert the usb port into a usb stick on option.\n\nA: You mean use the partition as a USB drive on an external scanner?  If you start the computer in target disk mode and plug it into the scanner with a USB cord, this may work.\nIf you're running Mountain Lion or Mavericks, you can use Disk Utility to add a small, FAT  formatted partition to your hard drive without erasing it or losing any data.\nConnecting that partition to an external scanner may prove to be trickier than installing drivers for a scanner.\n", "Q: Can you make Mac's Menu Bar hide?

I haven't found anything, though, concerning the iPad 2. Are there any improvements for iPad 2 as well?\n\nA: I've read in many user comments that yes it did improve the UX on iPad 2. It's more fluid than before. \nEdit : This french site confirms it.\n", "Q: Ad banner with my ads I would like to make a banner that will display ads for my products only. Will it be ok with App Store or my app won't be approved (or cut later)?\n\nA: The only thing I can find in the App store review guidelines is this:\n2.25\n\n\n*\n\n*Apps that display Apps other than your own for purchase or promotion \nin a manner similar to or confusing with the App Store will be\nrejected, unless designed for a specific approved need (e.g. health\nmanagement, aviation, accessibility, etc.) or which provide\nsignificant added value for a specific group of customers.\n\n\nBut you can't make it look like the standard i-ad banner because that means you are replicating an existing apple product.\n8.3\n\n\n*\n\n*Apps that appear confusingly similar to an existing Apple product or \nadvertising theme will be rejected\n\n\nAnd you must keep in mind that the ads can't be too annoying:\n2.13\n\n\n*\n\n*Apps that are primarily marketing materials or advertisements will be\nrejected\n\n\nIf you follow these rules I would say go for it, it sounds to me like it is perfectly within apples rules what you are trying to do.\nFor the full apple app-store review guidelines go here\n", "Q: Disable automatic menubar icon sorting in Mavericks? In Mavericks the icons in the menubar changed behavior. \nThe sorting is not dependent anymore on the order at which the apps were launched, but rather … something else. The icons jump and I now have an app running that adds a menubar icon, when I click it, I see the location services icon for a moment to its right, before it disappears, leaving a gap. \nThe icon that flashes mostly is the location icon, which appears leftmost in the sequence (sometimes leftmost removed by one). I didn't think OS X menubar icons can even be drawn where I am seeing them.\nIs there a hidden preference or something I can do to prevent OS X being smart \nabout the sorting?\n\nA: There are two types of menubar items in OS X. The classical one of type NSMenuExtra which is primarily used by Apple's own stuff like the clock, AirPort, TimeMachine, VPN and keychain, etc. These are not officially available for third party developers.\nThe other type is an NSStatusItem which is available for everyone and almost all apps that provide a menu bar item use this type.\nHistorically only NSMenuExtras could be sorted by ⌘ (command) dragging them and NSStatusItems were displayed in launch order from right to left. Since Mavericks Apple allow all items to be reordered by command-dragging them.\nThe chosen order should be persistent across logins. Some items like location services or screen synchronization will only show up when needed so they may change your sort order temporarily. The order is the same for all menu bars if you're using multiple screens.\n\nA: Try Bartender. This lets you rearrange all your menu bar items and will ensure their position remains at all times whilst the app is open. This will also ensure that previously saved menu bar items return to their correct position after being closed and reopened. Finally, Bartender fixes a number of positioning bugs that seem to occur with some menu bar items since Bartender 'controls' the position of all menu bar items regardless of the position that they 'want' to be (or OS X wants them to be).\n", "Q: How to get the shortest file size on aliases? I realize a bit of why they are so big. Actually, they used to be small enough (around 2kb) and still magical about keeping the file link.\nI can also see a few ways to \"shorten\" it, including one I've been using for a long time already, which is a simple service to create symlinks instead. There's an issue there:\nSymlinks are not aliases\n\n\n*\n\n*They break way too easily. An alias can keep linked to the origin most of the times.\n\n*Some software will treat symlinks differently from Aliases. Here, each one have their use, and eventually I'll use one or another.\n\n*Not as easy to create as aliases -> use CMD + ALT while dragging n' dropping files!\nSo, forget symlinks for this question, please!\nAs for the actual way to shorten it (described on the already linked apple forums) they are way unpractical. First you need to install Shrink Alias with Shortcuts (because the first is unsupported in newer OS X's and the second is a hack to make it available as a Service) and Delete Data Fork workflow. Then manually apply both to each alias. Eventhough you can do it by selecting all files in Finder, again, you still have to do it for each time you create aliases and it's many hacks to keep updated on the next OS'es.\nIsn't there a simple Service Workflow, Automator or AppleScript which could do  all that automatically whenever I create a new alias, maybe by hooking up on the Alias Manager?\nI doubt there is a secret to help with any of this...\nHow about some other new idea about all this?\n\nA: In High Sierra, the following works: just select the alias and run Finder command \"Show Original\" (command-R).  This trims the alias size down to a minimum.  This brought an alias that was previously 24 Mb down to 8 Kb.\n", "Q: Repair or reinstall Mac partition I have a hard drive that is having problems on a Mac that doesn't use Time Machine or another complete backup system. I get this error when trying to repair the disk:\n\nError: Disk Utility can’t repair this disk. Back up as many of your files as possible, reformat the disk, and restore your backed-up files.\n\nI have all the stuff I want backed up, but I'm curious if there is anyway to rebuild/repair it? I booted with a Ubuntu live CD and ran badblocks to check the disk with 0 errors, so hopefully that means the drive isn't going bad. \nIt seems I've repaired windows partitions before, so it seems weird that a Mac partition would be so fragile that there was no way to repair it.\nIf there is no way to just fix the partition, \ncan I just boot into the Maverick System Recovery and erase/reinstall, or do I have to boot from the original leopard DVD and then upgrade?\n\nA: It all depends on what is going on with the drive and unfortunately there is really no good way to tell.\nI have been using Diskwarrior for YEARS and it is still my go-to disk repair tool. Drive Genius is pretty good too. I have both but always start with Diskwarrior.\nThese tools MIGHT be able to repair the volume issues, but it might be quicker, easier and cheaper (?) to just bite the bullet and do what the disk utility says: reformat and reinstall.\n\nA: Apples disk utility will repair a wide variety of errors, but also draws the line on some other errors (or likely volume and rate of of errors) and then focuses on backup and a clean re-start to that drive. \nIf you have a good backup or don't care to back anything up, I would just reinstall. Booting into the recovery HD and erasing the drive will start with a clean slate. At that point, the installation process will be an excellent test whether the hardware is failing or not. \nOnce you have evidence the hardware worked by an error-free installation and clean disk utility verify post install, at that point you can restore your backup or just commence using the clean OS install. \nIf you don't have a backup and can't get one using Apple's tools, then it might make sense to gIVE Disk Warrior/Drive Genius or another third-party repair tool a try to repair/recover and at least get a good backup. \nI think of apple's disk utility warning similar to run-flat tires or an engine that can shut off one cylinder and still get you home or to the repair shop under limited power. The system used to keep running until it broke catastrophically, leaving people with no warning that they needed to back up their files when disk errors started happening at elevated rates. \n", "Q: iPhone 4S: how to set up multiple phone numbers under text messages send/receive option Under \n\n\n*\n\n*settings \n\n*text messages \n\n*send/receive\nI had 3 phone numbers listed - mine and my children.\nI am not sure how this setup occurred although they have iPhones that use and are associated with my email and Apple ID.  \nRecently my Apple ID was changed and I lost this functionality.  I'm wondering how to get these phone numbers back.  I am interested in monitoring my children's texts using this feature.\n\nA: This question covers the procedure you will follow to re-enroll your children's phone numbers under your new Apple ID. \nOn their two phones, go to settings app, tap iMessage and sign out of e old account. Sign in on your account and set their \"Caller ID\" for sending iMessage to be their phone number. Repeat for any/all devices that use your new Apple ID.\nHowever, there are problems with this approach.  Just be aware that when you get your children's messages, you only get their iMessages (message sent from an Apple computer or an iOS device only). SMS from non-Apple phones still go directly to their phone without you seeing them. \nYour children will receive a copy of all of your iMessages as well and they could send messages as you (but not your SMS).\n", "Q: Changing my home address in iOS 7 not picked up in Maps or notification center I need to change my home address, following this post. I've moved, so I need to update my address, but it does not seem to work. My new street address does not exist in the map (as I've moved to a newly developed area), and when changing the address in my contact, the old address is still recognized as \"Home\" in my Maps application. (Thus, also displaying \"Right now, it would take you XX mins to drive home\" to my old address) Does anyone know how I can correct this?\n\nA: I was able to clear the map history from Settings -> Privacy -> Location Services -> System Services -> Frequent Locations. Doing this, changing my contact card and updating my AppleID seem to have solved the problem (Apart from the fact that my street doesn't exist yet). \n\nA: You should definitely update your details on your Apple ID.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to AppleID\n\n*Update your address details\n\n*You should be done\n\n\nThe fact that your street does not exist in Apple Maps is nothing you can do about, except leaving feedback at Apple so they can update their map to be consistent.\nRegarding the \"home\" location in your contact, you have to edit the one with me next to it. Also please check if you have yourself multiple times listed (iCloud, local, other sources).\nI've just changed my location to check it and my Home is now changed as you stated in your question.\n\nA: On iPhone 7 go to map settings: change house number, city, state and zip. Pretty easy actually. Went to Samsung 7... so excited to get an iPhone again❤️\n", "Q: How to insert pages document to another pages document? I am using Mavericks, and Pages 5.1. I have created two .pages documents. Now, all I want is to attach one .pages document to another. In windows I could simply drag and drop or copy and paste both would have worked.

Here all files looks disabled. I can attach a .mov file but no other files, be it .pages , .numbers , .csv  etc.  \n\n\nHow do we insert one pages document to another pages document?\n\nA: Create a folder paste the two files into it. Now hyperlink the two files by opening the document (whichever you are trying to add a link in) then click inspector after you have the text you want to hyperlink, for the hyperlink URL, try the following. \n    Insert other pages document name here.pages\n\nNow close the document and save all changes. \nRight click the folder and compress it, then email the compressed folder to the person you are trying to send this to.\n\nA: I am using the same version of Pages and Mavericks but I cannot duplicate your items 1 and 2. I was able to move an entire document or just one page of it by selecting the text and using copy and paste as well as drag and drop of the selected text. Formatting is also preserved. \n", "Q: How to exclude songs or playlists from iTunes Songs? I have audiobooks, voice memos, among other things that have a place in my library, but don't need to be in my music list.  \nIs there anyway to exclude them or hide them from Music?  It's annoying to hit 'play' and be bombarded with pieces of books instead of actual music.\n\nA: In the Settings of the Song/Track u can set the Option to Skip/Don't play on continous Playback (Sry don't know the exact Name of the Setting in English my OS X is in German)\n\nA: If you're in the music-section of iTunes, only \"music\" should be played.\nMake sure your audiobooks and memos are categorized as such by doing a right-click on them and selecting info.\nThen, in the \"options\" tab, there's a dropdown where you can select a kind (music, audiobook, etc.)\n(if the dropdown is grey [as in: not selectable], turn off iTunes Match, change it, and turn it back on)\n", "Q: Macbook hangs at startup I've been having problems occasionally starting my Macbook Pro Retina.

When I launch in verbose mode it stops at this line.\nAppleUSBMultitouchDriver::checkStatus - received Status Packet, Payload 2: device was reinitialized\n\nHow do I determine what's causing the issue?\n\nA: How long have you left it at that point?  Another user reports the same issue, but they left it for another 15-20 minutes and then another message appeared highlighting a disk failure.\nTry creating a bootable back up on an external drive ASAP and test it.  Then at your leisure investigate further, that is leaving it on the start up verbose message screen.\nI personally would recommend using carbon copy cloner as it was quite useful, but super duper has a free mode that should work for you.\n\nA: I finally found a solution.

The cable costs $20 online. I watched the YouTube videos showing how to remove the LCD -- I think I could do it.\n\nA: It's not a very difficult think to do, I used to work at the Genius bar and I can confirm that it takes roughly about 20 mins for me to do, but there's always a queue of repairs to be done so it's very unlikely they will get it done there and then for you, unless you get a nice Genius. \nIf I were you and if the computer is out of warranty, then I'd say to do it yourself. \n\nA: Ask for a price at the genius bar, I'm assuming the price will be rather high (official repair centers in Austria charge a lot more than 20$ for the cable and add about an hour of work - the whole process would probably cost almost as much as the MacBook is worth)\n", "Q: Add MP3 Files To Native Music Player?

As you might know, Spotlight can do simple mathematics.\nFor instance, typing cos(pi) will result in -1, as you might expect.\nI just typed in cos(pi/2), which should be 0 but it gave me -5e-12.\nYes it is probably due to a rounding error, but come on: cos(pi/2)! \nIn my opinion, that clearly looks like bug. What do you think?\n\nA: They are not storing π with unusual floating-point precision.  They are using an incorrect value for π with double precision.  To approximate 3.1415926536 in binary, at least 38 bits are required:\n3.14159265359922… > 11.001001000011111101101010100010001001\n\nNotice that 2^-36 is about 1.5e-11, which coincides with the trailing 99.  Double-precision floating-point has a 52-bit significand.  To evaluate cos(pi/2) as -5e-12, the only other possible choice would be a 48-bit type, which would be very strange.\nNear 0 and π, where the derivative is nearly zero, cos(θ) cannot be calculated very accurately:\ncos(3.1415926536) ≈ -0.999999999999999999999947911\nThat differs from -1 by about 5.2e-23, which is smaller than ε for double, so cos(3.1415926536) is calculated as exactly -1... which is incorrect.\nNear ±π/2, the derivative [-sin(θ)] is nearly ±1, so the error at the input becomes the output.\ncos(1.57079632679961) ≈ -4.71338076867830836e-12\ncos(1.57079632679962) ≈ -4.72338076867830836e-12\ncos(1.57079632680000) ≈ -5.10338076867830836e-12\n\nI happen to have a TI calculator that displays one less digit and calculates cos(π/2) as -5.2e-12.  However, it is very different electronically and was designed to give an exact value for cos(90°).\nI would guess that in Spotlight, cos(pi/2) is being calculated by retrieving a value for π, converting to a decimal string, storing that as the (exact, rational) binary value 11.00100100001111110110101010001000100100001101101111 (or 10000), dividing by 2, and then essentially subtracting that from the true value of π/2.  You should find out whether cos(pi/2 + cos(pi/2)) is closer to zero (it might be -2.2e-35).\nMultiplication by a power of two should affect only the exponent, not the significand.  It might be possible to determine how rounding is applied by repeated halving or doubling.\n\nA: It is a bug that's reproducible on 10.9.2 - and a floating point rounding error one like that is quite typical.\nIt's the value of pi that is being handled without enough precision if I had to guess.\n\n\n*\n\n*cos(999999*pi) doesn't have an error\n\n*cos((999999+1)*pi) does have an error - likely rounding\n\n\nI'd head to https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/ if you want to see Apple's bug fixing apparatus in action.\n\nA: From the other answers and comments the following becomes clear:\nThe fact that you get a nonzero result is NOT a bug, even with a perfect implementation of the software you would run into the limits of floating point calculations. However, the error in the order of 10^-12 is really big.\nThis is NOT to blame to the inaccuracy of floating point numbers. The result you get is just this:\ncos(1.5707963268)\n\nThat can be validated using any alternative software package. If you were to evaluate cos(pi/2) in one of those packages you will definitely get a result much closer to zero than 10^-12.\nTo conclude I see two possible limitations, one of which must apply:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pi is not stored with sufficient precision, or at least pi/2 results in insufficient precision\n\n*Cos simply takes insufficient precision as input\n\n\nPerhaps someone with acces to the software can validate which of these applies.\nUpdate\nAs mentioned in the comment the problem seems to be the accuracy of the constant pi.\n\nA: Considering that -5e-12 is a verryyyy small number, this is a rounding error.\nI think it's the consequence of spotlight showing more decimals than than are used in the definition of the pi constant or the infinite series used to calculate trig functions.\n\nA: It's due to the lack of precision of pi and due to the overall all lack of precision in the built-in system. \npi = 3.1415926536\n\npi/2 = 1.5707963268 \n\ncos(1.5707963268) = -5.103412e-12\n\nFYI =  5.103412e-12 = 0.000000000005103412 ~ 0 \n\n\nAbout the overall system precision : \n3.141592653589793238462643383 = 3.1415926536 \n\nIn Python we get following : \n>>> float(\"3.141592653589793238462643383\")\n3.141592653589793\n\nAs we can see there is a problem with the precision since it doesn't even match the float representation. \n", "Q: Messages on OS X stopped working after iOS 7.1 upgrade After upgrading my iPhone 5 to iOS 7.1 the Messages app on my OS X 10.9.2 installation can no longer send messages via iMessage to other iMessage users.

The service works perfectly if I manually select it but not with the shortcut. As you can see from the screenshot the shortcut is definitely assigned... \nEdit:\nJust discovered that it actually works in all finder views except column view...\nWhat's going on here?\n\nA: Usually this happens when there are conflicting keyboard shortcuts with other apps. Here is how I troubleshoot this type of problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart and prevent all login items from running.\n\n*Try the shortcut you’ve assigned, in this case, Option+Command+C.\n\n*If it works, that means there are other apps that prevent you from running the service.\n\n*Run the apps in login items one by one and test the shortcut until you find the conflicting apps.\n\n\nMost of time it solves my problem. If it’s not conflicting keyboard shortcuts form other apps, you might use Key Codes to check the state of each key when pressed.\n", "Q: Android File Transfer I installed the \"Android File Transfer\" to move some data.

I couldn't find any option to change it.\n...the connection is not very stable, so every time I touch my mobile it dis- and reconnect and push the window.\n\nA: You can disable the auto start of Android File Transfer, and only open it in case you need it. \nHere are the steps you need to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up User & Groups and remove Android File Transfer from the Login Items\n\n*remove the agent from Google's app's library: rm -r ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Google/Android\\ File\\ Transfer/Android\\ File\\ Transfer\\ Agent.app\n\n*remove the backup agent from Google's app: rm -r /Applications/Android\\ File\\ Transfer.app/Contents/Resources/Android\\ File\\ Transfer\\ Agent.app\nThe removing steps are needed, as otherwise the app will unfortunately reinstall itself to the login items the next time you start it. Also instead of removing, you can just move them away for backup in case you might need them.\nAfter doing these steps the app will not start when you connect a phone, and you need to open it manually (CMD+Space plus start typing \"Android File Transfer\") when required.\n\nA: I have found Airdroid much easier and less temperamental to use in controlling/managing my android\nhttp://www.airdroid.com\nYou will need app on your phone and browser bookmark \n", "Q: Two Clash of Clan accounts under one Game Center account I have a problem that I am worried about with my Clash of Clans game. I originally started playing the game on my iPad. I was not able to play it while I was out because my iPad did not have an internet connection. So I downloaded the game on my iPhone 5 so I could play it everywhere and started a new base. At the time, I did not know that they were on the same Game Center account. Now every time I get onto my phone, it asks if I would like to load my TH 7 village, but my progress on this base will be lost. Well my base on my iPhone is a lot higher then the one on my iPad now. If I have to lose one account, I am OK with losing the one on my iPad lvl 47 rather than my lvl 70 on my iPhone. Can someone explain to me what I need to do to save my lvl 70 account? \nI am OK right now but when i get a new phone I will lose it because it is not linked to a Game Center account anymore. How can I ditch the level 47 village and keep the level 70 village?\nLong story short: I have Clash of Clans on my iPhone and on my iPad. Both have different villages. Started my village on the iPad first. Both are under the same Game Center account. Everytime I get onto my phone it ask if i want to load my TH 7 King Tom village. I always say no because it is not high lvl like on my phone. Is there a way to keep both villages and put one under a different game center or can I delete the low level one and just leave the high level one? Just dont want to lose my lvl 70 village is all because I have put so much money into it. \nThanks\n\nA: How open are you to creating a new Game Center account?\nIf yes, then follow the steps below:\n\nSteps are taken from http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4314?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Game Center app\n\n*Tap on your email/username and click sign out\n\n*Tap on the Create a new account button\n\n*Follow the steps on the screen\n\n*Sign in to your new GC account and open Clash of Clans\n\n*Congrats! Your village should be linked to the new GC account. To test it out, sign in to another device with Clash of Clans and tap on OK/Confirm\n\n\nIf no, well..... * shrug *. IDK what to do.\n\nA: Ok. I have gotten the same problem but in the opposite way. I am not sure but I think you need to ( on which ever device you aren't using and dont want the base) log out or delete clash of clans from Game Center account. It is hard but you can look it up. Easier will be just deleting the game on iPad or phone (which ever you don't want to keep), so that the message will stop appearing. BUT THE EASIEST is to just always click on Cancel when the note about replacement appears (This is what I do). Hope I helped. Good luck!\n", "Q: Textwrangler Open File in New Tab I just become a Mac user and I've been looking for a decent free code editor, thus I found Textwrangler.\nHowever, I like it a lot, I only have one problem with it. How does one open a new file in a new tab rather than a new window?\nI open a directory with it and have the tree, but each time when I click on a file it closes the current file I am viewing and opens the new one.\n\nIs it possible to have things open in a new tab as when you one a link in a new tab in Chrome or more exactly how you open a new file in Notepad++ on Windows.\n\nA: Command + Option + [ \nor \nCommand + Option + ]\nto navigate between open documents in the single window.\n\nA: Forgive me if it this is off-topic, but have you tried Sublime Text yet? I used to use textwrangler, but I haven't looked back since I switched to Sublime. A must have for me is the multiple cursors, which I have not seen anywhere else. By the way, Sublime is not (technically) freeware, but they let you download and install it for free, just bugging you from time to time, asking you to buy, but without limiting any features. Off course, in case you adopt it it would be fair to purchase it, but if you are on a budget it is ok to postpone. Hope it helps.\n\nA: I realize I'm necroposting a little, but to do this is BBEdit (which ate TextWrangler a while back):\nWhen you have a file open, you want to use the View >>> Window Appearance >>> Show Sidebar menu option or hit Command-0 (zero).\n\nThen profit. (See \"Currently Open Documents\" tab showing, below.)\n\nSublime is a great app, as is VIm, as is whatever Panic calls Coda next, as is WebStorm, as is VS Code, as is... \n... but if you want to use BBEdit with tabs, that's how. ;^D\n\nA: TextWrangler has a separate disk browser and editor view.\nIn your image above you are in the disk browser. From the disk browser press return when you are showing the file you want to edit. It will open in a new window.\nGo back to the disk browser and when you hit return it will load a second document into the same editor window.\nNow you will see a sidebar that allows you to move between your open documents. There are also menu commands and keyboard shortcuts galore to move between documents in the current window and move documents between windows.\n", "Q: Run Emacs within Bash I am looking for a way in Bash to run something within Emacs.

These are often for mundane tasks such as taking out the recycling. I want these tasks to appear maybe 10 mins before the due time - ideally I would like to have options the same way iCal alerts work.\nHowever I can't find any options for when the reminders show up - they seem to show 24 hours in advance. This is confusing because for small tasks I often don't look at the time/date (where it says \"tomorrow\") and end up take out the recycling one day early!\nIs there an option for this? I have tried setting iCal events aswell, and they also show 24 hours early.\n\nA: You can set a specific time for a reminder: mouse over the entry in Reminders and a circled \"i\" for \"Information\" will appear, upon which you should click.  Then select the checkmark box, \"Remind me: On a Day,\" and fill in the date and time for the reminder.  \nThe Reminders functionality in OSX and iOS is minimal; Apple seems to have wanted to include a product to be able to say they did, but not one that actually competes with any of the third-party vendors, to avoid strangling the software ecosystem like Microsoft did with Outlook.

This list, the one accessed by System Preferences/Keyboard/Text, vanished when I updated to 10.9.2 (it survived the initial update to Mavericks). I do a lot of writing for the sciences, and I've spent years building that list. (recent MacBook Pro, 10.9.2). \nSome sites say I should get the /Users/username/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist file from a backup, but I've searched the HD of my other computer (same specs but running 10.9.1, Replace/With list intact), and I can find no such file.\nOther sites say it's in the \"NSUserDictionaryReplacementItems array\" in 10.9, but unfortunately I don't know what that means.

UserDictionary.db is used even if iCloud is disabled and it has precedence over .GlobalPreferences.plist.\nIf you for example run defaults write -g NSUserDictionaryReplacementItems '({on=1;replace=aa;with=bb;})' and quit and reopen TextEdit, aa is replaced with bb in TextEdit, but the changes are reverted if you open the Text tab of the Keyboard preference pane.\nYou can change both UserDictionary.db and .GlobalPreferences.plist by using a script like this:\ndate=$(date +%s)\nwhile read -r replace with; do\n  plist+=\"{on=1;replace=\\\"$replace\\\";with=\\\"$with\\\";},\"\n  sql+=\"INSERT INTO 'ZUSERDICTIONARYENTRY' VALUES($((++i)),1,1,0,0,0,0,$date,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,\\\"$with\\\",\\\"$replace\\\",NULL);\"\ndone < <(sed 's/\\\\/\\\\\\\\/g;s/\"/\\\\\"/g' ~/replacements.txt)\nsqlite3 ~/Library/Dictionaries/CoreDataUbiquitySupport/$USER~*/UserDictionary/local/store/UserDictionary.db \"delete from ZUSERDICTIONARYENTRY;$sql\"\ndefaults write -g NSUserDictionaryReplacementItems \"(${plist%?})\"\n\nIn 10.8 and earlier versions of OS X the text replacements are stored in the NSUserReplacementItems array (not NSUserDictionaryReplacementItems) in ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist.\n\nA: I found an easier way to do it.\nUse these steps to export your existing text substitutions:\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences > Keyboard > Text.\n\n\n*Select the shortcuts you want to export. If you want to export all of your text substitutions, select one of them, then choose Select All from the Edit menu.\n\n\n*Drag the selected shortcuts to the desktop.

So if the upgrade breaks something all I have to do is back up the few changed files and restore from my clone.\nAs for Time Machine, you can't restore an O/S from Time Machine as it does not backup system files. However once you have reinstalled the O/S Time Machine can take you the rest of the way.\nProbably NOT what you want to hear but that's the only solution I have ever found...\n\nA: You could\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up the files you need to an external harddrive (or TimeCapsule?) - or clone your disk, there's tools available for it\n\n*Format your disk to a clean HFS+\n\n*Install a clean version of OSX Mavericks using 10.9 installer\n\n*Put back the files you need\n\n\nA: Use TimeMachine for backups and simply rollback if something goes wrong at updating OS X.\n", "Q: Why can't I choose full screen mode in Photoshop CS6? I am using a trial version of Photoshop CS6, and I can't choose full screen mode. I am running OS X 10.9.\n \nWhat's wrong?\n\nA: Make sure there is a file opened first, if photoshop is \"empty\" the options are indeed grayed out even in the registered version of photoshop cs6.\nLet me know if this fixed it\n", "Q: Is iWork for iOS a real office document editor? Can I use iWork on my iPhone and iPad as a complement to my employer issued Windows PC? I know that iWork boasts some Microsoft Office compatibility but how is it implemented? If office documents are imported and converted to a iWork format and then have to be exported to a Office format on save, isn't there a risk for dataloss?\nIdeally iWork would edit actual office documents but I'm not sure if this is the case.\n\nA: There surely is a risk for data loss, mostly in the formatting of documents. As you suspected, the files are converted when opened (and saved) to the iWork format. Certain features in Office aren't present in iWork, such as SmartArt or VBA applications.\nFor handling simple letters it could be a compliment, but for business critical documents that shouldn't change their formatting all the time I would stick to one of both. Since your employer decides what you use at work I don't think iWork would be a very good option in this case.\n\nA: Pages exists and many people use it - yes it a real option for editing Word docs on iOS. (most use it happily and productively as well)\nConvert and not support 100% of the features that any one PC version of word does - no Not only is it not Word and has a different UI and different philosophy on how toolbars and controls are organized, it's not as complicated as Word by any measure. \nIn fairness, word on the PC doesn't support 100% of the features from one version to another and has many formats and conversions - so it's more a degree of what subset of the features you and your colleagues actually use and whether you stick to pre 2007 formats or have jumped to the new Office document format.\nThe good news, is you can try out the conversion from word to pages and back (or even try pages using word format exclusively) for free online using iCloud.com and the iWork for iCloud beta. \nIf you want to edit a specific version of Word on the PC that you need to interoperate with, I may be able to provide some more guidance on how groups of people have felt when using Pages on iOS with a body of document that for years were crafted and edited in a Word only / PC only environment.\nAs a compliment I say jump in and get working in Pages. If you use Macros and VBA you will quickly learn that those just don't make the transition and work on documents without those attributes and get quality work done since you are clearly a power user. If you are not a power user, I say jump in - the less complicated Pages may make you more productive and you'll quickly learn that there is or there isn't a conversion issue and can make an educated plan on how to proceed if you run into that.\n", "Q: Why am I not prompted to 'Keep notes on iPhone' when I disable Notes in iCloud settings? Other things like Contacts, Reminders, Calendars, and Safari data all prompted me to 'keep data on iPhone' when I toggled them off in iCloud settings, but not Notes!\nI want to keep my notes on my iPhone when iCloud is disabled.\n\nA: It's either a bug or by design. My iDevices do the same. \nYou could try moving them to a different account using the notes app on the Mac, if you have access to that. That wouldn't solve your problem completely though.\n", "Q: How to regenerate random smart playlist in iTunes 11? I have several smart playlists that pick a random selection of music limited by total disk space.\nIt used to be that to change that random selection, you just selected all the tracks in the smart playlist and pressed backspace to delete them, which caused it to repopulate with a new random selection. \nIn iTunes 11.1.5, if I select all the tracks and press backspace, nothing happens.\nHow am I supposed to regenerate the random list now? The only way I've found that works is to open the smart playlist properties, change the \"selected by\" dropdown to something other than what I want, click OK, then open the properties it again and change it back. But that's far from optimal.\nEDIT: Apple seem to have fixed this sometime around iTunes 11.4. You can once again select some or all of the tracks in a Smart Playlist, then press backspace to delete and regenerate (provided Live Updating is selected in the playlist properties).\n\nA: If you uncheck \"Live updating\" in the smart playlist edit screen you will be able to delete tracks from the smart playlist. \nHowever the playlist won't repopulate until you right-click the playlist and select \"Update Smart Playlist\".\nInterestingly that command doesn't do anything unless the tracks have been deleted. \n", "Q: Safe Mac-bundles up-to-date? I like the idea of mac bundles where a group of awesome apps are offered in a very good price.

So is any website keeping track of mac bundles, but bundles that are not scams/fake/virus etc.\nCheers.\n\nA: I haven't followed them for a while, so I don't know if they reliably catch all the bundles, but I followed http://dealmac.com back in the day. \nThey track lots of hardware deals and some software.\n", "Q: 2011 iMac kernel panic My iMac keeps shutting down approximately every 3 hours.

I just bought an iPhone 5, and was planning on listing my (what I thought, was) 5th generation iPod touch I bought last year, but Glyde and Apple support both claim there are only 32GB and 64GB 5th generation iPod touches, where as, mine is only 8GB.\nMy girlfriend has the iPhone 4S, and my iPod's screen is bigger than hers, which leads me to believe it is an iPod touch 5th Gen, but I can't find any documentation on it existing in the wild. It also has no rear camera, only a front facing one.\nThe model number laser etched on the back is: A1421\n\n\n\nA: You do have a 5th Generation iPod touch, and it's the 16GB model.\nIf you check out Apple's website for current-generation iPod touches, specifically the \"tech specs\" page, you'll see that there are two types available today. The left one (the one with no metal circle on the bottom-left of the back) is the one you have.\nOn your Usage page, you have two numbers: available and used. The confusion is probably because \"available\" here means how much space you have left for new content, not the total amount available to you. If you add the two numbers together, you'll have roughly ~13GB of total storage. (the remaining storage being taken up by the OS)\nAlso, Apple has an article on identifying your iPod that can often help find the marketing name for any iPod that's been released.\n\nA: It's clear that your iPod touch model No. is A1509. It has the following specification.\n\nMost Apple Hardware products can be looked up at EveryMac.com's Lookup.\n\nA: It is possible to have a 16gb 5th generation iPod Touch. There are - to my knowledge - no 8gb 5th gens. however.\nFrom your picture and the information provided, you most certainly have a 16gb 5th generation iPod Touch.\n\nMain difference between the 16gb iPods and the ones with larger storage capacity (besides storage) is that the 16gb does not have a rear camera (as you know), while the larger ones do:)\n", "Q: Record my iPad screen on MacBook I have an iPad 1, and MacBook with Snow Leopard 10.6.8.

I am able to see the iPad screen through AirServer on MacBook, but I'm not seeing any option to record my iPad screen.\nCould someone advise what I'm doing wrong here?\n\nA: There are several 3rd party AirPlay receivers which could run on Mac OS X and receive/record screen mirroring from an iDevice.\nYou have to download and install one of these applications. Try LonelyScreen (free) or Reflector ($15).\nAnother way is by using QuickTime. QuickTime on OS X 10.10+ can record iDevice screens, but you must connect your iDevice to Mac, while the AirPlay receiver method can work with Wi-Fi.\n\nA: AirServer 5 lets you record the mirrored screen. Make sure you are updated to AirServer 5 or later or the option will not be available.\n", "Q: My iPhone was stolen and now doesn't appear in iCloud? My iPhone was just stolen and when I open iCloud it no longer lists ANY of my phones, even old ones that I still have but my kids use as iPods.  What is going on?\n\nA: You haven't mentioned it, but even if you had your location services disabled and your iPhone was untrackable with \"Find my iPhone,\" you should inform Apple that your phone was stolen. If you bought your iPhone new, then Apple will have record of that iPhone's serial number (and probably MAC address) associated with your name. If the serial number shows up in their systems, either by the thief seeking support from Apple, or by the theif's creation of an AppleID and attempting to reassociate that iPhone to their name, Apple can flag the activity as suspicious, remotely wipe the phone, or more likely, simply disable it. I highly recommend calling Apple support and reporting that your iPhone was stolen.\n\nA: May the iCloud Find my iPhone service doesn't work anymore because you have changed your Apple ID password and the iPhone (and the other devices you mentioned) can't login anymore into Find my iPhone.  Try if it appears when you change the password back to the you entered in iCloud on your iPhone (and the other devices). I'd say that the iPhone (and the other devices) won't appear immediately, give it at least 3 hours, I don't know how often it tries to connect to iCloud if the password was wrong.\n\nA: If you didn't have them set up under the same Apple ID, or with Find My iPhone/Device, they won't show.\n\nA: It might not be showing up anymore because the person who stole your phone may have preformed a factory reset on it,not certain on that but i think thats a possibility.\n", "Q: How to batch download and process camera roll My camera roll is taking up way too much space on my iPhone, but I like having all my pictures.\nEvery time I connect my iPhone to my computer, I would like to download/save new photos on my Mac, batch downsize the images to something much smaller and then append them to an album.\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: Apple has Photo Stream for this purpose. As long as you launch iPhoto once every 30 days (at least) it will get all your photos from iCloud. You can then delete them off your phone once you know they've been imported into iPhoto.\nAlternatively, you can set up Google+ Auto Backup on your phone. As the name implies, it will auto-upload everything you take to G+. If you let it resize the images to 2048px it won't cost you anything either.

On previous OS X releases, I could open Disk Utility and choose file->NFS Mounts. I cannot find anything similar in Mavericks. Is there any GUI for mounting NFS, or must it all be done via the command line?\n\nA: A late answer, for posterity and the desperate searcher.\nThe GUI has been moved more or less to Directory Utility, which can be found in /Volumes/[name of your harddrive]/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications. Use -shift-G if you are lost to find your way. \nOpen Directory Utility and click on the Directory Editor (third) icon.\nSelect \"Mounts\" from the dropdown menu Viewing (Node dropdown menu set to \"/Local/Default\") - if editing is locked, click the lock and enter an admin password.\nClick the + icon in the lower left corner of the pane to start a new entry.

The values for AppleMetaNodeLocation and GeneratedUID are generated automatically. \n\nRestart your computer.\nNote added: After changing the NAS system I noticed that the above instructions worked with a Seagate BlackArmor NAS, but not with a WD MyCloud Mirror NAS. The WD NAS can be mounted as a NFS share under OS X 10.6.8 without problem. For a working connection with the WD NAS I used the following options: resvport,nolocks,locallocks,nosuid,rw,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check,soft,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,timeo=900,retrans=3,proto=tcp,all_squash (I copied these from another site, maybe not all of them are required).\n\nA: Unfortunately the NFS GUI tools have been removed from disk utility in Mavericks.  However the NFS manager tool ( www.bresink.com/osx/NFSManager.html) can replace that functionality and provide even more fine grained control than disk utility's implementation did.  If you want this NFS mount to remain mounted persistently you can also use  automounter which is a CLI only tool. \n", "Q: How can I clear photos from an iPhone? I'm trying to delete my camera roll, I imported in to iPhoto, then deleted all the photos with Image Capture. As soon as I open the Photos app on the iPhone it just starts downloading everything again... Any ideas? I'd like to keep my photo stream working, just not keep the whole camera roll on the phone.\n\nA: First, make sure what you're seeing is actually Camera Roll and not Photo stream.\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap Settings > General > Usage.\n\n*Wait for the \"Storage\" section at the top to populate (can take a\nwhile).\n\n*Tap \"Photos & Camera\".\n\n*Tap \"Camera Roll\".\n\n\nThis will display the usage for each section.

I plugged it back in and synced my songs manually (not from the backup).\nNow 5 songs that I bought from iTunes have all lost their album cover on my iPhone. All the other album covers from other songs are still there. It's not a big deal, but I like to have all album covers filled in.\nWhile I was typing this I remembered that it helped to completely delete the album covers and download them again, I did this, now only 2 albums are naked, so to speak.\n\nA: I had this problem and through asking google I figured out a solution.\nYour best bet (it worked for me) is to go to your iTunes, sync your iPhone and then go to music. Once you are at the music tab, you want to uncheck the \"Sync Music\" at the top (this will get rid of all of the music without album covers, it will be okay I promise). Then you want to sync your phone so it gets rid of the music. Then once that is completed, you want to recheck the \"Sync Music\" and sync your phone so it reverts what you just did. It will take a few minutes for the music to get back on your phone so be patient! Afterwards, everything should be peachy keen :)\nHope I could help.\n", "Q: Expedite iOS app review to less than 24 hours Is it possible to get the app reviewed within a day or few hours? I know there is an expedited app review process if the app is time sensitive then Apple will review the app very quickly, but that also might take 1-3 days sometimes. We built an app which is needed to be in store tomorrow, though one version is already up there but it is not working properly as expected. We have fixed the bug and want to app to be in market before tomorrow morning.\nCan my app's review be expedited further than the process above? We are even ready to pay some amount if Apple is ready to review and submit our app in less than a day.\n\nA: I have heard of people using their paid tech support instances to expedite a review or determine why exactly it's being rejected if there is a code problem (such as Apple suspecting that a private API is being called when you are not calling any private API), but your best bet is probably to follow the normal process outlined here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/\n\nUrgent Bug Fix\n  If you've submitted an update to fix a critical bug in your app on the App Store and you are requesting an expedited review, be sure to include the steps to reproduce the bug on the current version of your app.\n\nBe sure to explain why the bug is critical before you burn a chance at an expedited review. I would call someone that's not a software developer and have them give you an honest reaction if your bug is really critical after you take 60 seconds to explain to them the nature of the problem.\nIf you can't explain to a lay person in 60 seconds why this is critical to them as a potential user of your app, you might not get Apple to bump you to the front of the line. If your description of the critical nature of the patch is in the end user's interests, this seems to be your best shot to move things to the front of the queue. \n\nA: The expedited app review process still takes time, I have seen app developers wait from a few hours to a few days and in really bad cases, weeks. I have also seen app developers try every possible way to speed up the process (finding the review team on Facebook, Linkdin, etc..)\nIn regards to your specific problem, that's the reason we created rollout.io an SDK which allows you to solve quality issues in production instantly, the solution is fully complient with Apple's guidelines.\nDisclosure: I'm one of the co-founders of Rollout.io\nP.S\nThis site shows the average approval time on Apple's app store (regular submitting process) - http://appreviewtimes.com/ \n", "Q: XQuartz X11 2.7.5 not found to get X11 i went to XQuartz here https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/X112.7.5\nhowever the download linke XQuartz-2.7.5.dmg seems to be broken -- couldn't find it anywhere else either. what am i missing?\n\nA: If you go to the XQuartz home page you will find a link to download XQuartz that should be correct.\nIf you are running OS X 10.9 then you need version 2.7.5\nAt the moment it is http://xquartz.macosforge.org/downloads/SL/XQuartz-2.7.5.dmg but our friends at MacOSforge appear to have a broken server.

Mid 2012 MBP with OEM hard drive. I booted it this morning to a flashing question mark folder. I happened to have an external drive with OSX on it, booted to that external drive just fine. I opened disk utilities with the original hdd still inside the MBP, it wasn't listed in Disk Utility, couldn't find it in Terminal.\nI popped the original hard drive out of the MBP, booted off the external drive to OS X, connected the original hard drive to a SATA-USB to the MBP, OS X could see it just fine. I ran a disk repair from Disk Utility, everything checked out, said it repaired a few errors, etc. Popped it back into the internal SATA connection in the MBP, and restarted the laptop (unplugged the external hdd). Flashing question mark folder appeared again.\nHappened to have a second 2.5\" internal hdd with OS X installed. Popped it into the internal SATA connection in the MBP to test perhaps a bad SATA cable, etc. That hdd worked just fine, booted OS X. \nI tried resetting the NVRAM (command+option+P+R). I've basically tried everything I could think of, not sure why it's not booting the original hdd. Again, I booted off a different drive and the original internal drive plugged in via SATA-USB, I am able to view the contents of the drive just fine (naturally backed up all my data as I assumed the disk is failing).\nAny thoughts, tests, concepts, theories, are all very much welcomed and appreciated!\nUPDATE\nI've since decided to unseat the internal sata cable and reseat the cable. Upon booting with the original drive, everything booted fine. After a several hours of use, and restarting, the drive wasn't recognized. I have reason to believe the SATA cable is bad. My question now, is there a way to tell if the cable is going bad or if perhaps its a logic board issue? If I'm able to boot external drives just fine, would that imply the logic board is operating normally? Or are we somehow bypassing that function by the nature of being external? \n\nA: Since only one drive gives you a flashing ? when mounted internally, you've pretty much ruled out hardware failure of the controller and the cabling. \nI would first try booting into the start up manager by holding the option key with the problematic drive on the internal bus. The ? can come up when the startup disk settings in NVRAM don't match the drive, but if any drive connected is bootable, it should show when you boot with option held down. \nYour next step after making sure it's not startup disk settings would be to erase that drive entirely and try reinstalling OS X onto it. You could flip a coin and decide to do the installation internally or externally. \n", "Q: Other physical remote options for a Mac (not an iPhone or iPad) I reassigned the buttons on my Apple remote with BetterTouchTool to fire off hot keys on my Mac.  I then taught my universal remote the Apple remote buttons.  This works perfectly, except that Apple's remote only has 7 buttons.  I want at least a few more.\nIs it possible to use 2 different Apple remotes for one Mac, assigning different controls to each remote?  I doubt it, but I'm asking just in case.\nIs there any other remote that would work with a Mac other than Apple's remote, in order to get more buttons to reassign?\nWhat I want is 12 buttons (or more), which I would then teach my universal remote.  That's why using an iPhone or iPad won't work in this scenario.\nIs there some other option to accomplish the same task?\nEDIT: Yikes, did I stump the band?\n\nA: Eventually, I answered my own question.  For the sake of hopefully helping anyone else who may be wondering the same thing, here's my answer:\nI asked: \"Is there any other remote that would work with a Mac other than Apple's remote, in order to get more buttons to reassign?\"  The answer is yes!  It's possible to use two Apple remotes, assigning different functions for each, and it's possible to use a universal remote with a Mac, assigning any functions you'd like to any buttons you'd like.\nI found two options for doing this.\nThere's a usb receiver called Flirc that learns remote buttons for just about any remote and then assign actions or hotkeys.  And, there's an App called Remote Buddy which allows you to use more than one Apple remote and/or various other remotes.  I can't say how well it works since I opted for Flirc.\nBasically, I have two Apple remotes - an old white one and a silver one.  I wanted to use the white one to control my Philips Hue lights via Applescripts I wrote, and I wanted the silver remote to control iTunes and system volume.  Using Flirc (and the free BetterTocuhTool app), this was astonishingly simple to set up.  Once I realized how flexible Flirc is, I also recorded functions for my universal remote.  I've only had Flirc for a few days, but I'm really thrilled with it.\n", "Q: Deselect text using keyboard shortcut or prevent selection of word/link on right click I often copy links in Chrome with the context menu, to paste into a chat window (Adium). This process selects the link on copy. When I cmd+tab back to my browser window, the text is still selected and it interferes with keyboard control of the given website. This forces me to move my hand back to the trackpad, find some non-active space (page bg usually), and click to deselect. I'd rather not have to move my hand from the keyboard to do this.\nI've tested this in Chrome, Safari, and TextEdit. I could maybe solve it in Chrome with a userscript, but I'd like a more general solution for other programs as well.\nedit Another way of looking at this problem is that OSX selects the word or link on right click with a context menu, but doesn't clear the selection when the context menu is closed. Is there a way to force deselection of text on context menu close?\n\nA: cmd+a (select all)\ncmd+shift+home [at least tested on PC with control+shift+home]\n\nA: Tapping an arrow key will deselect the text.\n\nA: Hold down the control key and single mouse click on the page.\n\nA: Holding down the insert key deselected the item.\n\nA: On Ubuntu Chrome Ctrl+A(Shift+a) deselects text.\n(This shortcut also toggles tab list, but not whilst text is selected.)\n", "Q: How do you paste syntax highlighted code into Keynote '13? I give a lot of code heavy presentations with Keynote. Syntax highlighting makes these readable. \nIn the past I've used web based syntax highlighting tools, and then pasted the easier-to-read code into my presentation.\nWhen I upgraded to iWork '13, which includes Keynote 6.1, pasting content strips the font style and color.\nFor example, if I take this colorful code from GitHub and paste it into Keynote it removes all the formatting as shown here:\n\nIs there a way to get syntax highlighted code into these presentations?\n\nA: This is probably the online highlighter you are using.\nI use http://markup.su and it works fine with Keynote 6.1 - it autodetects a number of languages and has a number of \"themes\".\nIf it isn't the highlighter then it may be your template or browser. I was able to take your code and paste it from markup.su in Safari into Keynote perfectly.\n\n\nA: If you don't like the idea of pasting your code online, consider installing the Pygments python package and generating your highlighted syntax at the command line:\npygmentize sms_me_last_line.sh\n\nCopying from Terminal and pasting into Keynote worked for me. But it took me a while to find the formatting control for removing the background text color. (Click Format in the toolbar to show the formatting options, click Text, click Style, then click on the gear to show advanced formatting options. In that pop-up you will find \"Character Fill Color\".)\n\nA: I'm using Vim. I found this plugin super useful:\nhttps://github.com/zerowidth/vim-copy-as-rtf\nIn This way I can keep my codes the same look when I was writing and presenting them.\n\nA: It's a bug in Keynote '13:\nPasting rich text from Xcode to Keynote works when you paste in an existing text box.\nIt doesn't when you paste into a new text box.\n\nA: The 'short' answer\n... is that different apps copy formatted text to the clipboard in different ways, and different apps support pasting from different formats. Typically you'll get some kind of 'plain text' format, as well as maybe HTML or RTF formatted text in the clipboard, and it's up to the pasting app to choose which it likes best.\nKeynote 6.1 definitely supports some kind(s) of formatted text pasting, as I can get this to work with Safari. But it doesn't seem to work with Firefox or Chrome (at the time of writing). From a bit of testing, it seems the Apple apps all play nicely together (no surprise there), and a few others will copy/paste to/from the Apple apps too (including Microsoft Office products). Unfortunately when you copy from Chrome, you only get plain text & HTML-formatted text copied to the clipboard, so it would appear Apple's iWork apps don't support pasting HTML formatted text.\nSo if copy/paste doesn't include formatting, you can either:\n\n*\n\n*Try a different browser to copy from, such as Safari; or\n\n*Find an intermediate app to paste into (which 'speaks' both HTML formatting and can re-copy into a format Keynote/etc understand), such as Apple's own TextEdit.app\n\nSurprisingly, Apple's own TextEdit.app will happily paste formatted text from Chrome, and it can be re-copied to the clipboard and pasted with formatting into Keynote/Pages/etc.\nDepending on your point of view, this may seem a limitation (or fault) in Chrome/Firefox or in Pages/Keynote/etc, but in the end they simply don't speak the same formatting languages (at present).\nI'd encourage anyone experiencing this to send feedback to the developers on both 'sides' in the hope of getting this fixed—either with Chrome/Firefox supporting RTF/RTFD copying (or whatever is most standard/appropriate beyond HTML), or by Apple's iWork apps supporting the pasting of HTML content.\n\nMore than you want to know about copying to the clipboard\nWhen you copy some text to the clipboard, depending on the application, it may get copied in a few formats. You can see these using Apple's Clipboard Viewer application (requires building in Xcode).\nFor example, copying from Google Chrome, the clipboard gets populated with four separate copies of the information I copied—two plain text (public.utf8-plain-text, NSStringPboardType), and two HTML formatted (public.html, Apple HTML pasteboard type).\nCopying from other apps gives various combinations of format types, with some other common ones being 'TEXT' (CorePastboardFlavorType), com.apple.traditional-mac-plain-text, Apple PDF pasteboard type, Apple PICT pasteboard type, public.rtf, NeXT Rich Text Format v1.0 pasteboard type, NeXT RTFD pasteboard type, com.apple.flat-rtfd, com.apple.iWork.TSPNativeData, com.adobe.pdf, com.adobe.indesign-import-ustl, and so on...\nAs you can see there are a variety of plain text formats (with various encodings like UTF8/UTF16), RTF types, PDF and Adobe types, image types. There's also a bunch of metadata types that describe the application that copied the data (e.g. com.apple.iWork.TSPNativeMetadata), or the features of the copied text (e.g. com.apple.iWork.TSPDescription), and what appear to be separated text and style data (ustl and TEXT as CorePasteboardFlavorTypes, and their com.adobe.indesign-import- equivalents).\nI don't know any way of seeing which format types are supported by which applications for pasting, but using the Clipboard Viewer you can quickly see which format types are generated on copying.\n", "Q: In Safari \"Export to PDF\" looks different then \"Print as PDF\" - Why is this? In Safari (I'm using 7.0.2) if you browse to a website and select A) file>export to PDF you will get a different looking PDF then if you go to B) file>print>PDF>save as pdf \nB) Looks like its using the CSS media query for print, but A) only looks like its using some of this information then applying more styles of its own. Does anyone know wheres these extra styles are coming from and how they can be overwritten or ignored by the page being exported?\n\nA: Well, I know this is an older question, but I came upon it and thought I would answer...\nThere are two things that can be different here -- one, as is noted in the question, is the special set of styles used for printing. This is set up on the website you are looking at, and is not something you have control over. The second are the print options. I think by default printing of background images and colors is turned off, and it is possible to make other settings too. These are controlled through the print dialogue.\nThe automatic print stylesheet is a a pet peeve of mine. I've always thought a better solution was to offer a button to let visitors choose to format the page for print, rather than doing it without their control. I always want to default to giving users more control rather than taking it away.\nI would assume that if you set up a special user stylesheet to be applied to all pages in the Safari preferences (normally done for folks with needs for special display characteristics such as high contrast or extra large type), those styles would be applied when printing as well. I haven't tried that out, though.\nTLDR: if the website has their CSS set up to serve special styles when printing, there isn't much you can do about it. While you do have control over some elements of printing, such as printing of background colors and images through the print dialogue.\n", "Q: Restoring iPhone as a new iPhone but backing up contacts I have an iCloud account, but I am backing up via iTunes.\nI want to restore my iPhone because of the \"other\" files taking up a really huge portion of my phone's memory (2 GB and I have only 16 GB of storage).\nI just want to back up my contacts. I've checked my iCloud account online and my contacts are there. Can I recover the contacts back to my phone after restoring to a new iPhone too?\n\nA: Yes, as long as your contacts are synced with iCloud, you can reset your phone without losing them. If you can see them on iCloud.com, they are synced.\nFirst make sure you have a current iCloud backup of your phone before resetting. You can backup manually by going to \"Settings > iCloud > Storage & Backup > Back up Now\".\nSecond, make sure your contacts are being synced \"Settings > iCloud > Contacts\" button turned ON (green showing). \nNow, after you reset your phone (Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings), you can set-up the phone as a \"new phone\" (i.e. not from your iCloud backup).

You would need to open the iMac's system volume (default is Macintosh HD) and remove or rename the two files mentioned above in Library/Preferences.\nHopefully that helps!\n\nA: I'm having this same problem and yet, it is different. I note all over the Web a variety of like, but different versions of the problem. Solutions that work for one, do not work for all, even when the descriptions ARE identical.\nMy mid 2011 27\" iMac 10.13.3 Radeon 6970 blanks out (flashlight trick does not work) while second monitor remains active. I can be in mirror mode or not. It may or may not flicker intermittently before blacking, or after recovery. Usually, the only way I can recover is to use the Sleep command from the second monitor (forces me to use mirror or insure the second is setup to have the menu bar). \nUsing the sleep function usually blanks out the second screen briefly and then both return, as if Finder Relaunch. Sometimes, it puts the system to sleep and I can return normally. It can require anywhere from one to twenty or more repeats of this operation one after the other for a day-long fix, or rear its head again later, several times a day. \nNot one of any of the other many solutions offered elsewhere will work. I will add that I often use my second for TV and if the iMac blacks, I have to switch back to second display use in order to 'sleep' it, again. Very hard to watch NASCAR while computing. Hard enough to do dual screen computing.\n\nA: So as I understand you have reinstalled Mavericks. As you have been able to use the installer (Recovery HD) the hardware should be fine. Please note though that usually when you reinstall Mac OS X it will keep all your settings and programs. This might mean that the thing causing your troubles is also kept intact.\nTo resolve this, I would suggest the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from recovery HD\n\n*Make a backup using disk utility to external drive (if neccesary)\n\n*Erase Macintosh HD\n\n*Install Mavericks\n\n\nThis should resolve your problems, provided that there is really no hardware failure. If this doesn't help, you can rule out software failure and your best bet is to go to an Apple Store.\n", "Q: Is my Mac Mini HDD about to fail? I carried my Mac Mini while traveling a few times, once to a different country and couple of times to different cities.\nI once noticed the hard disk inside makes noise like its about to fail. But the noise is not noticeable unless the room is very very quiet, or when I keep my ear on the Mac Mini hardware and I can clearly hear the creeking noise from HDD.\nBut running disk verify shows no error. Will the apple store replace it for me due to bad health of the HDD? I am still under warranty.\n\nA: I suggest taking a backup and going to an Apple Store soon.\nI had two situations like this with funny creeking noises, the hard drive eventually slowed down and stopped working - no bad sectors or anything. It just eventually stopped.\nIt was not an Apple drive, but I am sure it's worth asking. Worst case scenario you will have to come back when drive eventually dies.\n\nA: Tiny clicking noise is normal for HDD since it is a mechanical head moving up and down during read and write process.\nThe Disk verify is not 100% checking every single sector.\nTo see if there are problems Open your console and type Error in the search window and look for Disk I/O errors.\nIf you have them, those are the first signs of disk failure.\n\nA: The other thing to think of is that sometimes a noisy/failing HD noise is sometimes actually fan noise.\nEspecially if you have been carrying it around. Fans tend to be much more fragile than hard drives and fans in computers NOT designed to be carried around may experience bumps that could eventually damage them.\nIf it is possible to run the Mini with is partially disassembled (basically out of the case) you might be able to be sure where the noise is coming from.\n", "Q: Distribute iOS app without human interaction Is there a way to deploy an iOS app to a device without requiring human interaction.\nBy 'no human interaction', for instance, consider an automated scenario (in a CI environment) where the server can deploy an app to a device and there is no need to have a person to go to the device in order to open an URL and click 'install'.\nFollowing image shows what I want to avoid.\n\n\nA: Yes it is possible.

Now via the MDM API, an IT administrator can send an app to the device and have it installed silently in the\n  background. There is no need to ask the user which delays compliance,\n  the app just installs itself. This works both for apps in the iTunes\n  App Store that the company may have purchased a volume license for and\n  apps developed by the company itself for internal use, that are not\n  stored in the iTunes App Store.\n\nContrast this with what iOS 6 provides (described in the same article), which is (italics mine):\n\nIn iOS 6, through the use of MDM APIs you could:\n  Install Apps via MDM. This feature tells the user that they must install an app. The user could ignore this message and the\n  administrator will have to decide how to handle this. They could set\n  the MDM system to automatically lock their device out until they\n  install the app. They could keep calling the user asking them to\n  install the app. Either way, the app cannot be installed for the user\n  by the IT team.\n\n", "Q: The C key stopped working, any workaround to emulate 'Command + C'?

I am trying to get rid of Genieo which accidentally got installed on my MacBook Pro, when I considered using jEdit. I followed their Download link which appears to be on sourceforge, when the following screen appeared:\n\nI should not have been so naive and I should have read more carefully, but since it is not uncommon in having to push yet another button when downloading and because I though sourceforge was a trustworthy resource, I followed the link, ending up with Genieo installed on my mac. \nThe result is that I am currently being spammed with Genieo driven popups. I want to get rid of this, but the only howto I can find points to Genieo's site where I can download an uninstaller. \nI can't say that I trust a site which uses murky marketing tricks to lure people in using their software in the first place, so I am quite hesitant in downloading their uninstaller. I am afraid of what that might unleash on my Mac. \nIs there any way to get rid of Genieo manually?\n\nA: \nIs there any way to get rid of Genieo manually?\n\nThe only way is to do so manually. Carefully follow Thomas Reed's Genieo Removal Guide to completely rid your machine of the offending adware. Here is an abbreviated version of Thomas Reed's guide:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Genio. Remove /private/etc/launchd.conf. \n\n*If it's not present, move on. If it is, trash it and restart the machine (See the warning in the full guide about overlooking this step). \n\n*Remove the following files, if present:\n/Applications/Genieo\n/Applications/Uninstall Genieo\n/Applications/Uninstall IM Completer.app\n~/Library/Application Support/com.genieoinnovation.Installer/\n~/Library/Application Support/Genieo/\n~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.genieo.completer.download.plist\n~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.genieo.completer.update.plist\n/Library/LaunchAgents/com.genieoinnovation.macextension.plist\n/Library/LaunchAgents/com.genieoinnovation.macextension.client.plist\n/Library/LaunchAgents/com.genieo.engine.plist\n/Library/LaunchAgents/com.genieo.completer.update.plist\n/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.genieoinnovation.macextension.client.plist\n/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.genieoinnovation.macextension.client\n/usr/lib/libgenkit.dylib\n/usr/lib/libgenkitsa.dylib\n/usr/lib/libimckit.dylib\n/usr/lib/libimckitsa.dylib\n\n*Restart the machine again. \n\n*Remove /Library/Frameworks/GenieoExtra.framework and empty the trash.\n\n*Remove the Omnibar Extension from your browser. See full guide if you are unsure how to do so. \n\n*Reset the Home Page, and possibly default search engine for your browser. \n\nA: I went to toolbar, on my mac. Genieo was on the top right hand side. I clicked on the icon and pressed \"disconnect\". This allowed me to move it into trash. It's the most annoying software which was attached to a budget planner. Hope this helps. It worked for   me.\n\nA: Absolutely do not trust the genieo adware uninstaller, it's known not to work & leaves hidden software behind.\nhttp://www.thesafemac.com/arg-genieo/ works, \nas do the similar steps posted on Apple Support Communities :\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/25139427?ac_cid=tw123456#25139427\n\nA: This program puts itself into the launchd.conf and is launched automatically when the Mac starts up. Temporarily, quit it, or uninstall it.\nThen follow the steps below to Remove Genieo and if possible, run the Appcleaner utility to remove the traces.\nMake sure you remove/uninstall it from the extensions on browser as well.\n\nA: I got rid of Genieo by Showing Package Content and then moving individual components to the trash.  I couldn't empty the trash because my OS said Genieo was still running and I wasn't able to quit it.  But since apps can't launch when they're in the trash I did a restart and then I could empty the trash.\n\nA: This is what they say:\nHow do I stop using Genieo?\nWith the following options you can choose to either temporarily deactivate Genieo, or fully uninstall it:\nDisable Genieo from the browser button menu. This will stop Genieo's process of mapping browser activities and introducing new content to your Homepage. With this option, you can reactivate Genieo from the browser button menu again.\nRemove Genieo's add-on from your browser.\nFully uninstall Genieo by following these instructions.\n\nA: This is the most annoying thing EVER.  Do NOT think that simply by Quitting or Disabling/Disconnecting the Geneio icon at the top that you are done with this thing!!  It will come back and ask you if you want to use it as your Homepage/Search Engine and when you click No or Disable, it then becomes your search engine.\nTo remove it completely, as well as the steps in a post above to search for all of those files in Finder and then trash them - you must also Quit Geneio (at the top right side of your screen) AND remove Omnibar from your extensions.  To remove Omnibar - Go to Safari in the Toolbar at the top of your screen --> Preferences--> Extensions icon (Blue pic).  Remove to the trash BOTH Geneio AND Omnibar.  Turn your computer off and restart before emptying the trash.\nWorth also doing a search in Finder for Geneio or Omnibar and delete any of these.  After everything is in the trash, restart and empty your trash.\nI am finally rid of this thing now it would seem.  Removing Omnibar was for me the final step that gave me back Google!\n\nA: If you have installed Spotify you ought to remove that too. It was freezing my Google Calendar\n\nA: If you get \"permission denied\" when using terminal to remove the lanchd.conf file, use this command instead\nsudo rm -R /Volumes/\"your HD name\"/private/etc/launchd.conf\n\nA: I got this toolbar a few days ago. But luckily, I successfully removed it from my PC by following the manual guide. Open the affected browser and reset the settings. Also, I removed all suspicious extensions and applications from the Program Control Panel. Maybe you can try this way.\n\nA: I downloaded uninstall from this site http://www.genieo.com/features/. It works.\n\nA: Clean my mac 2 seemed to do a good job for me FWIW\n\nA: I just wasted 45 minutes trying to remove this Genieo malware so here goes my solution.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you can, go to another Mac computer and download AppCleaner from Cnet's downloads.\n\n*Transfer the application to the computer with Genieo installed\n\n*On the impacted computer, unzip AppCleaner and open the Applications folder.\n\n*Move the Genieo application to the Trash and empty it afterwards. AppCleaner should take care of the rest\n\n", "Q: Spilt one huge PDF into separate .txt files I have a PDF file of 2 years worth of journal entries that were exported from MacJournal back in 2009.

I tested transfer speeds by reading/writing a large file from/to both an encrypted and an unencrypted drive. I tested on a current Macbook with Mavericks and on an older machine with Mountain Lion. I used Disk Utility to format the drive as Mac OS Extended (Journaled) and Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted).\nMacBook Pro (2013) with USB 3.0 running OS X 10.9.2 (13C64)\nWrite: 86.16 MB/sec (encrypted:   0.62 MB/sec)\nRead: 181.66 MB/sec (encrypted: 151.15 MB/sec)\nMacBook Pro (2007) with USB 2.0 running OS X 10.8.5 (12F45)\nWrite: 23.57 MB/sec (encrypted:  5.04 MB/sec)\nRead:  36.23 MB/sec (encrypted: 37.87 MB/sec)\nAs you can see on the older machine the write speed clearly decreases when writing to the encrypted volume but is still about ten times faster compared with the newer machine running Mavericks. Could this be some recently introduced issue in FileVault or CoreStorage?\nUpdate (2014-06-28)\nThe USB drive seems to have had a hardware defect from the start. I got a replacement drive (same model) which still doesn't deliver the results I would expect but at least the encrypted write speed of the 2013 MBP is now on par with the 2007 MBP.\nMacBook Pro (2013) with USB 3.0 running OS X 10.9.3 (13D65)\nWrite: 135.41 MB/sec (encrypted:   9.29 MB/sec)\nRead:  196.22 MB/sec (encrypted: 187.04 MB/sec)  \nMacBook Pro (2007) with USB 2.0 running OS X 10.8.5 (12F45)\nWrite: - MB/sec (encrypted:  9.39 MB/sec)\nRead:  - MB/sec (encrypted: 37.79 MB/sec)  \nThis still leaves the question though why the encrypted write speed to the USB drive on the 2013 MBP is less then ten percent of the regular write speed. I also compared read/write speeds before and after activating FileVault on the internal SSD of the 2013 MBP and there I couldn't detect any slowdown at all.\n\nA: I have the same problem, which I'm pretty sure is due to a combination of the way write operations work on flash memory and the way core storage (or any whole-volume) encryption works.\nFirst, write behavior: unlike volatile memory (the stuff used in the memory of your computer) or hard disks, where any bit can be written to 0 or 1 at any time, flash memory has two main states: written and erased. Within \"written\" are 0 and 1. When you need to write to flash memory you must write an entire block that is currently in the erased state. File system software in the OS may know what blocks are free, but the controller and storage on a flash device don't. A special way for the OS to tell an SSD to make blocks available has been devised for \"bus-connected\" SSDs: it's called TRIM. USB protocol stacks don't, to my knowledge, support TRIM. So, basically, flash memory continues to fill up until there are no actual erased blocks, at which point the file system has to erase and rewrite blocks by reading them, merging in the new data, erasing, and writing them back out. That's why you see small-file write performance degrade on SSDs over time.\nThe special circumstances of encrypted volumes is interesting: depending on the way the encryption works, it may actually encrypt an entire volume, filling all the blocks with what appears to be random data even if the blocks are actually unused and would contain zeroes. So when you turn on FileVault (or otherwise enable core storage encryption), it basically consumes the entire volume, leaving no space for write operations. The file system has to constantly read, erase and rewrite blocks so that it can rewrite them with any encrypted data you want to put on it.\nNow I will say right here that this is speculation based on a reasonable understanding of how things work, but there are people who actually know the details, who may correct or improve my explanation and I hope that they will do so.\n", "Q: Apache \"Client denied by server configuration\" When I am running my localsite/~user.name/ on OS X 10.7.5 it is loading the the correct page but in the log /var/log/apache2/error_log it's recording this message.\n[Fri Mar 14 00:17:07 2014] [error] [client ::1] client denied by server configuration: /usr/~\n\nHere is my httpd-vhost configuration for localhost\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n  ServerName localhost\n  DocumentRoot \"~/Sites\"\n  <Directory  \"~/Sites\">\n    Options Indexes Multiviews\n    AllowOverride All\n    Order allow,deny\n    Allow from all\n  </Directory> \n</VirtualHost>\n\nA check of apachectl -t shows no unexpected errors since I'm using localhost and don't need fully qualified DNS:\n\nhttpd: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using MacBookPro.local for ServerName\n  Syntax OK\n\nI am serving plain text files with basic html in them.

It pops back up when I put the cursor to the bottom of the screen but does not stay there permanently any longer.\n\nA: You've probably enabled Dock hiding. You can toggle this by pressing ⌥⌘D.\nAlternatively, you can toggle it through System Preferences or by right-clicking the spacer between the apps and the stacks then turning Hiding off:\n\n\nA: For me, I don't remember turning Hiding On, but I must have done it inadvertently.  When I tried toggling it off, it fixes this problem.\n", "Q: command not found for shell script I created the following bash script in OS X 10.7.5:\n$ cd ~/Documents/github/scripts\n$ vim hello_world.sh\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nclear\n\necho \"The script starts now.\"\n\necho \"Hi, $USER!\"\n\necho \"I will now fetch you a list of connected users:\"\necho\nw\necho\n\necho \"I'm setting two variables now.\"\nCOLOUR=\"black\"\nVALUE=\"9\"\necho \"This is a string: $COLOUR\"\necho \"AND this is a number: $VALUE\"\necho\n\necho \"I'm giving you back your prompt now.\"\necho\n\nThen I make sure it is executable:\n$ chmod ugo+rwx hello_world.sh\n$ ls -l\n-rwxrwxrwx  1 GuardDog_02  staff  325 Mar 13 18:51 hello_world.sh\n\nThen I add the directory to the contents of the PATH variable:\n$ vim ~/.profile\nexport PATH=/Users/GuardDog_02/QtSDK/Desktop/Qt/474/gcc/bin/:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin\nPATH=$PATH:/Users/GuardDog_02/Documents/github/scripts\nexport PATH\n\nI then run the following to have the effect applied:\n$ . ~/.profile\n\nThen I open a new controlling terminal window, and I run hello_world.sh, but get command not found:\n$ hello_world.sh\n-bash: hello_world.sh: command not found\n\nWhy isn't the shell script recognized from the interactive bash shell in the controlling terminal? I tried the same thing in Ubuntu and it worked just fine.\n\nA: Do you have a ~/.bash_profile? If so, then that will be preferred over the ~/.profile startup script. Next, verify the setting of your path (echo $PATH). Also (and this may be a dumb question) are you actually logged in as GuardDog_02? In other words, is ~ identical to /Users/GuardDog_02?\n", "Q: Best version of OS X for a 2008 iMac? (This is a follow-up to How to improve old, slow iMac -- new SSD? Or more RAM?)\nI replaced the HD on our old 2008 iMac 8,1 with an SSD, and it seems much faster.\nHowever, it was running 10.9; now it's on 10.7.4 (which was already on the SSD.)\nShould I install 10.9 like the App Store suggests? Or keep the version at 10.7.4?\nIt only has 3GB of RAM.\n\nA: I am of the opinion that you should keep your O/S up to date unless you have a SPECIFIC reason to stay at an earlier version. E.G. incompatible software that you MUST run or a noted incompatibility with a service that you can't do without (EG some people are still having issues with MS Exchange compatibility in mail.app on Mavericks).\nSo, your computer has enough RAM (more RAM if possible) and a nice fast SSD so I would go with the Mavericks install... IMHO\n\nA: I do have the same iMac as you. \nI believe Snow Leopard is the fastest system you can install in your iMac though its not supported by Apple anymore. \nI did the upgrade to 10.9 and I felt the system slower, but, I did that because some softwares required the upgrade to run. \nWhen Yosemite came your, I gave it a try. I made a fresh install and, at beginning everything appeared to be normal. But I felt the system VERY slow at everyday life tasks. So I decided to downgrade back to Mavericks. \n\nA: I have a 2008 iMac 8,1 Core 2 Duo running OS X 10.10.4 Yosemite. Yosemite actually consumes less HDD space and appears to run faster than older versions of OS X.\nMy recommendation is always upgrade to the latest OS.\nNote also about two years ago replaced original 1+1GB RAM... now have (2+4) 6 GB 800 MHz DDR2 SDRAM. Works beautifully.\n\nA: Anything above 10.10 has so much disk I/O it could fry the older hard drive (source: Apple Genius)\n\nA: Your instincts are correct—avoid updating to Yosemite or any later OS. The transparency effects Apple introduced in their graphical facelift can be taxing on older machines, and I have directly experienced many computers become significantly less speedy as a result.\nSnow Leopard will likely feel the most speedy on your machine. However, if you need something a little more recent, macOS X 10.9 Mavericks is a good compromise OS to stick with. It should feel almost as fast as Snow Leopard, and you since you're already on Lion, you won't have to deal with the hassle of downgrading (which requires a clean install).\n", "Q: Full-screen photos for incoming calls in iOS7.1 I have upgraded my iPhone to iOS 7.1 What the hell happened to my full-screen photos for  incoming calls?\n\nA: Apple changed the layout/design of the incoming-call and call-in-progress screen with iOS 7.1. If you want to let them know that you preferred the old layout, you can use the Apple Feedback form on apple.com.\n", "Q: Batch convert Apple Pages files to Microsoft Word doc files How can I convert a large number of Pages and Numbers files into corresponding MS Office format in a quick manner.\n\nA: iWork Converter can batch convert Pages files to doc without script.\nAlso can convert Numbers files to xls.\nhttp://tyorex.com/iWorkConverter\n\nA: You could also use Automator and some third-party actions such as:\nhttps://www.ghostotter.com/pages-automator-actions\n...to make a droplet or service to do the job.\nFor example:\nOpen Automator from your Applications folder\nMake a new Application (File>New>Application)\nNext, assuming you have the actions mentioned above, drag in the following actions from the Pages library (in the left hand column):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Document(s) \n\n*Export as PDF (remembering to select \"All Documents\"    from the drop\ndown\n\n*Close Document(s)(again, remembering to select    \"All Documents\"\nfrom the drop down\n\n\nIt should look something like this:\n\nSave your Automator app somewhere you can get to it easily (e.g. your Desktop) and simply drop Pages documents onto it as and when you need to.\n\nA: Paste this into an Automator run AppleScript.\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    --Select from where you will pick up the pages files\n    set theSourceFolder to choose folder with prompt \"Select folder with original pages files :\"\n    --Do it\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set theNames to name of files of theSourceFolder ¬\n            whose name extension is \"pages\"\n    end tell\n\n    --Select where the files will go\n    set theDestinationFolder to choose folder with prompt \"Select folder where files will go :\"\n\n    -- How many files to export\n    set item_count to (get count of items in theNames)\n\n    --Get files and export them\n    repeat with i from 1 to item_count\n\n        set current_file to item i of theNames -- get a file\n        set lean_file to text 1 thru -7 of current_file & \".docx\" -- change the originalfile (.pages) to a .MS Word name\n        set out_file to (theDestinationFolder as Unicode text) & (lean_file) -- get the fully qualified output name\n        set in_file to (theSourceFolder as Unicode text) & (current_file) -- get the fully qualified input file name\n\n        tell application \"Pages\"\n            set mydoc to open file in_file -- open input file in Pages\n            export mydoc to file out_file as Microsoft Word --do the exporting\n            close mydoc saving no -- close the original file without saving\n        end tell\n\n    end repeat\n\n\n    display dialog \"done\" -- Job done\n\n    return input\n\nend run\n\n\nA: You could also use my app Docxtor. It lets you convert whole folders of documents and will even reproduce complete folder structures, something which is difficult to achieve by AppleScript. \n(Disclaimer: I am the developer of this app!)\n", "Q: Why does my music not play through FaceTime? When I'm on FaceTime with my friend and we both want to listen to music, how come if I turn on my music on iTunes, the person I'm facetiming with can't hear it?\n\nA: To prevent audio feedback, FaceTime will try to cancel any audio the mic picks up that is coming from the same device's speaker. For your friend to hear your music, play it from a different device than the one you are using for FaceTime.\n\nA: It seems to occur in many iPhone and iPad models. in FaceTime call, OS will lower the playback volume of your music, and send it only to the headphones connected to the phone.\n", "Q: Restore Windows 8.1 System Image Backup to new Boot Camp partition I just got a new hard drive because the old one was going bad. I made a system image backup of the old Boot Camp partition and saved it to an external drive.\nGot the new drive set up, with Mavericks, ran bootcamp and got a partition set up, installed windows 8.1 on it, and then tried restoring it from the image. When I get into the system restore I can choose the backup location, but the next step where you choose/format/partition the drive looks like it needs some kind of disk driver, but I don't know where to find a MacBook disk driver.\nI'm hoping to restore so I don't end up having to reinstall everything.\n\nA: if you already installed WIN8.1 how or why would you also restore a backup image as well?\nit seems like that is what is going on based on \"next step where you choose/format/partition the drive\" would indicate an attempt to restore the backup image on the new WIN8 install partition. btw, did you use winclone?  \n", "Q: Why is my Launchpad missing app icons? Sometimes my Launchpad just look like this without any app icons. What causes this problem and how can I solve it?\nI am using 2011 11″ MacBook Air with OS X 10.9.1\n\n\nA: This didn't work for me,\nFinder did not respond, clicking on Apps gave this error  \nCould not obtain valid temporary directory for sandboxed app ...\n\nI also had to open a terminal and run:\ncd /var/folder\nsudo rm -rf *\n\nSearched for and opened Activity Monitor, stopped the com.apple.IconServicesAgent service and rebooted.\nMy icons came back in launchpad and dock.\n\nA: A less intrusive way to tell LaunchPad to reset it's settings and regenerate app listing and icons is to perform this command line step:\ndefaults -currentHost write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool true; killall Dock\n\nYour screen desktop may blank and the dock will go away momentarily. If this doesn't work, the next step is to log out and back in. A reboot also could help further in some limited cases.\nSee more discussion at https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/194073/5472 and https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/150973/5472\n\nA: Delete the Dock database files and relaunch Dock:\nrm ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Dock/*.db && killall -HUP Dock\n\n\nA: i read on another website if you type the following in terminal the launch pad gets back to normal:\nrm ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Dock/*.db; killall Dock\ni had the same problem and this worked so hope it helps anyone else with the same problem.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Finder\n\n*Go to \"~/Library/Application Support/Dock\".\n\n*Find file *.db, delete it, \n\n*Open Terminal, type killall  Dock, and all icons return.\n\n", "Q: How do I recover data from a dead MacBook Air? Things I've tried:\nAll of the key combinations, it does not respond to any of them. I can't boot from anything external, I tried removing the SSD which is an OWC Mercury Aura Pro 6G. It doesn't respond to anything I do except reset the PRAM, and it just sits there forever, no fan, no apple logo or spinning wheel. Extra emphasis on the nothing. There may aswell be a uC connected to the LCD that outputs a blank grey screen because that's all it does.\nI'm at a loss and I have no idea what to do. Going to the apple store is not an option, I can't afford the repair bill. This is a customers computer, they hired me to recover photos off of the SSD, and said I could keep the computer if I can fix it. \n\nA: There are reasons why good data recovery services are usually expensive. In your case you seem to have two options\n\n\n*\n\n*figure out why the Mac doesn't start anymore (with the SSD installed of course). There is a lot of material on http://support.apple.com/ describing various steps on how to recover an apparantly dead MacBook Air\n\n*focus on data recovery by moving the SSD into an external enclosure, attach this to another Mac and access data from there. \n\n", "Q: Some texts automatically underlined in iPhone 5 with iOS 7.1 I am using iPhone 5 with iOS 7.1, My problem is text automatically underlined on some buttons in the application\n\nIs there any settings available to remove the underline?\n\nA: This is a change to show which button labels are pressable.\nYou should go to Settings > General > Accessibility and turn on/off Button Shapes and then revisit the app in question. You should only see underlines and shapes when this control is on, and this is to indicate what buttons that look like text are actually tappable for those with accessibility needs.\n", "Q: GarageBand multiple takes doesn't work I'm trying to simply record multiple takes using GarageBand 11.  I enable cycling, record once, the hit stop, rewind, record again... BUT NO TRIANGLE APPEARS on the track folder. Also, while the track plays back a 2nd time, its playing out loud so I cannot hear what I'm doing.  I tried with the REPLACE mode enabled and disabled, but that doesn't help.\nAny ideas on how I can record multiple tracks?\nI have logix 10 installed too and have the same problem there.\n\nA: Do you want to record multiple tracks, or multiple takes?\nFor multiple takes you need two things\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure Cycle mode is on\n\n*In General settings (GarageBand/Preferences/General) Cycle on is set to Create Takes\nTo record multiple tracks simultaneously:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that the Record Enable button is shown\n\n\n*Activate recording for multiple tracks. You can only do that for separate input channels.\n\n\nA: You shouldn't (need to) stop and rewind.\nOn the yellow bar on top of the screen, set the region you would like to cycle. Garageband will do the rest.\nWith pictures:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/PH1913?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\n", "Q: How to use an application name to kill it from a script I'm trying to create a cron job to prevent children at a school from running the Minecraft server. (We actually need them to run the Minecraft client because we use it to teach programming.) The name of the PROCESS is always \"java\". That's not useful for me.\nI found a way using jps and lsof of getting the filesize of all running .jar files. I could kill processes based on that, but it seems messy.\nThe name of the Application (not the process) that runs the Minecraft server (as show by the Apple logo on the top left corner of the screen) AND its Java class name are both net.minecraft.server.MinecraftServer but I can't ever get that string from the command line, no matter how many variations of ps I try. ps and top always call the process \"java\". It's easy to find the file name being used, but that's useless because it's easily modified.\nIs there a good, clean way to find if the Application or Java class net.minecraft.server.MinecraftServer is running and what its process is?\n\nA: Minecraft Server should be detectable through the arguments passed to its java process.\nOver at Unix & Linux, the question kill process based on arguments tackles this problem: how to kill a specific java process based on its command line arguments.\nThe top answer recommends using pkill with the -f flag to kill based on the arguments associated with a specific process. The final command may be as simple as:\npkill -f 'MinecraftServer'\n\nWith regard to using cron, this is fine but Apple recommend migrating to launchd as cron is less efficient.\n", "Q: How to force Spotlight to index content inside a package? I wish to use Spotlight to search inside my Papers 3 library package (i.e., a 'bundle') as the search functionality within the application is broken and/or hamstrung. Is there any way I can force Spotlight to index the contents of the PDFs in this package?\nI've tried EasyFind as an alternative and it seems pretty useless at searching file contents.\n\nA: Not a direct solution to this problem, per se, but a workaround: the (very expensive) software FoxTrot Professional Search finds files within bundles like the one used by Papers 3. It's very flexible and powerful for searching document contents in its own right, too.\n", "Q: Unusual iMessage received from my mom, who wasn't aware she sent it I received a iMessage via my mom's locked iPhone 4 while simultaneously calling her.  I stated I just received a message from you. She was confused because she doesn't use or know how to use this feature.\nThe content said \"Can't talk now - On my way.\".  I sent her a screenshot of this verbage to which I was referring to.  She allowed another family with more experience of iPhone to investigate.  They had no record or proof on their end of what I had sent but the rest of the message thread was identical. \nHow can I receive a random message seemingly via my mom's telephone number that she did not send?  Can we be part of someone else's spying on and unlocked phone? \nI am extremely confused.  I called AT&T and Apple and neither could help me. \n\nA: Check the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings\n\n*Phone\n\n*Click the third line (free translated) \"Answer with text message\"\n\n*The exact text you received is right there.\n\n\nIf you have a running phone call, your screen will turn black once the sensor will notice the darkness of your face being close to it.\nOnce you click on your phone during an incoming call, you can decline the call and answer with one of the messages explained above.\nThis has nothing to do with spying and hacking.\n\nA: You have received an automated response from your Mom's phone while you were calling her.\nShe must have inadvertently used 2 ups..ups when trying to answer your call rather than answering normally, and therefore accidentally used the \"Respond with Text\" function, which has a standard text of \"Can't talk now - On my way\".  \nThere are other options to choose from, such as \"I'll call you later\" and \"What's Up?\" by default, or you can edit the defaults to read with your own message in Settings > Phone > Respond with Text.\nThat message is sent automatically via iMessage format if the recipient (i.e. the caller) is a valid iMessage address (otherwise as an SMS), and should show in her sent messages in iOS7.1, but I am not sure about earlier versions.\n", "Q: How to set default Window position and/or size? Whenever I start an application like Terminal or Preview, they are always opened as a small window on the top left corner of the screen. Is there any way to set them to open in the center of the screen? Preferably maximized too?\n\nA: Slate (a window manager) is extremely configurable, and using the JavaScript config file will allow you to do this. Events like a window opening can be handled with a JavaScript callback which moves the window to fill the screen.\nAn example of what you want: (taken pretty much directly from the wiki page)\nslate.on(\"windowOpened\", function(event, win) {\n    if (win.app().name() === \"Terminal\" || win.app().name() === \"Preview\") {\n        win.move(\"x\" : \"screenOriginX\", \"y\" : \"screenOriginY\",\n                 \"width\" : \"screenSizeX\", \"height\" : \"screenSizeY\");\n    }\n});\n\n\nA: In Terminal you can change the default window size from Preferences > Settings > Window:\n\nYou can also use window groups to set a default position and size for the window opened when you launch Terminal (but not for new windows opened later).\n\nI use Sequential and Skim as alternatives to Preview and iTerm 2 as an alternative to Terminal. All of them have an option to open windows in full screen by default, and all of them have their own (pre-Lion and actually usable) implementations for full screen windows.\nThe sizes of Finder windows are saved in .DS_Store files and there are no default window size settings in com.apple.Finder.plist or anything. I use a script like this to reset the properties of windows:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    if number of Finder windows is 0 then return\n    tell Finder window 1\n        set toolbar visible to false\n        set sidebar width to 0\n        set statusbar visible to false\n        set current view to column view\n        set bounds to {960, 44, 1920, 1076}\n        tell its column view options\n            set shows icon to false\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\nA: I'd like to help you with the correct answer which is given on SuperUser: What controls saved / default window sizes and positions in OS X?\nNext to that, if you don't want to mess with the .plist files I can recommend you BetterSnapTool which can be used to drag a program to the top of a screen like you can do in Windows 7 by default.\n\nA: On OSX 10.9, when I drag the Terminal window to a different spot, then quit, the new location is remembered upon relaunch. To change the size of the window, in Preferences -> Text, you can make the font size bigger, which will be remembered. In Preferences -> Window, you can set the number of rows/columns as well.\n\nA: Get an app named SizeUp. It is not free but it pays for itself in productivity real quick.\n", "Q: How can I resolve this error during a dmg copy operation I am trying to copy a 200GB dmg file between two disks (one firewire, one local) and see this error:\nThe Finder can’t complete the operation because some data in “mbp_18_06_2011.dmg” can’t be read or written.\n(Error code -36)\n\nHow can I debug / fix?\n\nA: You can try copying the data using Terminal \nType in sudo ditto ~/sourcefile ~/Destination\nReplace \"~/sourcefile\" by dragging the file you want to copy into the terminal window which will autofill, and do the same with the \"~/destination\"\nAlternatively: sudo ditto -V ~/sourcefile ~/Desktop\nThis will show you progress and any errors as the files are being copied     \n\n\nA: If the dmg is mounted, you'll get that error when trying to copy it I believe.

When I copy and paste the name \"Gereon Müller\" from this book http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/18 (choose the download tab) I get the ü decomposed into two characters on a Mac. This does not happen under Windows and Linux (xpdf, acroread, sumatra), but it does happen on a mac with acroread and with skim. Any ideas?\nEdit: These are the two characters: ü In the text you can see an ü, but it is actually an u with two dots that are shifted over the u. Look at this: ẗ (as you can see, I composed a t with these two dots). This is not a problem for reading the ü, but if I want to continue to work with this ü I get problems, since LaTeX does not like these characters at all. In emacs I can edit these two characters seperately.\nEdit II:\nI played with different applications and they behave differently: Word gets one copy and paste right, while emacs gets both wrong.\nWord:\n\nEmacs:\n\nEdit III\nAnd this is text edit:\n\n\nA: If having such characters in decomposed form (represented by two codepoints, base character plus combining accent mark)  is a problem for further processing you need to do, then you can use an app like Unicode Checker to convert the text to Unicode Normalization Form C.  That will change them into the composed, single-codepoint form.\nhttp://earthlingsoft.net/UnicodeChecker/\n\nA: I reproduced your steps:\nThe Book is in English and in Adobe pdf format.\nI downloaded the preview and found some examples with \"Umlauts\".\nCopy and paste them in to my Notes.\n\nGüldemann Joël König\n\nAs you can see it works perfectly well.\nSuggest you check and update your Adobe reader to XI version.\n\nA: \"ü\" is almost always represented as a single character in text encoding schemes, but I have been informed that it can also be represented as two characters. In Unicode, for example, \"ü\" is represented as a single \"precomposed\" character as 00FC. However, it exists as a less-commonly-used two-character grouping as 0075 0308.\nYou are encountering a strange bug or incompatibility. I suggest that it may be that the word processor program into which you are pasting the text has been set, for that document, to use a type of (old and obsolete) character encoding that does not properly recognize the \"ü\" character. Either that, or there is some strange problem with the way that this particular PDF you are working with has been character-encoded.\nBy inspecting the PDF you linked to, I see the following:\nApplication: LaTeX with hyperref package\nPDF Producer: xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)\nPDF Version: 1.5 (Acrobat 6.x)\n\nI do not understand the implications of this, having no experience with LaTeX, but perhaps this could provide a clue.\nThe next step in troubleshooting the problem is to find several different PDFs from different sources and different websites that also have German in them, and see if you have the same result when you copy text out of them and paste them into whatever word processor you are using. If you cannot reproduce the problem, then it's a problem with that particular PDF.\nThen you should try pasting German text with umlauts from the various different PDFs into new blank documents in different word processor programs (Apple TextEdit, Bean, Apple Pages, Microsoft Word, OpenOffice, whatever you have on hand) and see what results from that. The problem might be a quirk in one particular word processing program and its preference settings.\nI assure you that it is highly unlikely that you are having any kind of problem with the Mac OS X operating system itself. I routinely work with writing text and making PDFs in several languages with diacriticals, including German, Spanish, Italian, and French, and I have never encountered a problem like that which you are reporting.\n\nA: \"Type German characters - online German keyboard\",  type your letter and when finished copy it to the document you need it on (in my case, I copy it to my email, no problem). That online keyboard comes in a lot of languages. Look it up, it's good, it's under German.typeit.org  \n", "Q: OS X codesigning certificate expriry We use Apple code signing certificates to sign apps so that users can know we made the app. What happens to the users when our certificate expires?\nDoes it mean that app will now appear untrusted or does it only affect us and no longer let us sign code using that certificate?\n\nA: When you sign an app using a code signing certificate, you are establishing an end date for that app (in terms of it having an unexpired cert). \nYou will not be affected directly (except hopefully for getting warnings that you are using an expired cert) but your users will notice when the expiration passes and they will not get a warning beforehand. One day it will break, precisely when their clock passes the date of expiration. It will still be signed of course, so you may want to prepare your customers to expect that the trust the OS extends to your your app will expire. They can choose to keep running the app by disabling the checks or stripping the code signing. You might also to supply users with newer versions of the same app that are re-signed should they want he same exact binary but simply extend the signing for a different time range. \n", "Q: Ducking in iMovie 10 iMovie 10 makes ducking a lot less easy... I'm trying to make interview clips automatically reduce the music, but it's making life difficult for me. Can someone please tell me how to do audio ducking in iMovie 10? Thank you!\n\nA: The audio ducking controls in iMovie 10 are in the adjustments bar under the sound tab. In the sound tab, there's a slider labeled \"Lower volume of other clips\" and this slider ranges from around 20% ducking to 100%.\nMore about this in this tutorial video I made: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EChiImCZbno\n", "Q: Is there a way to automatically upload photos from an iPhone to Google Drive With Dropbox, you have the option to upload all photos from your iPhone to Dropbox. Is there an equivalent for Google Drive? I.e. is there an app, that when I open it will upload all my photos from my iPhone to my Google Drive account?\nI don't see a preference setting for this in the google drive app, and I have searched for 3rd party apps and nothing seems to do this.\n\nA: You should use the app Photosync which let you choose where to download your pictures, including Dropbox, Google+/Picasa, Box, 500Px and Google Drive (!) to answer your question.\n\nA: Use Google+! Switch on auto back up, check settings to make sure it uploads over wifi only perhaps.\nAlso, the Google+ app offers the option to upload full-size photo files, which will use your Google Drive space allotment, or to upload unlimited \"standard-sized\" photo files. Standard size means they are resized to 2048 on the longest edge. This is a nice option if your photos are mostly snapshots or mostly just viewed on screen and never printed.\n\nA: Yes, Google Drive has a built-in option for automatic photo backups.\nGo to Settings -> Photos and enable Auto-Backup. If you choose to upload in High Quality instead of Original, the uploaded photos won't count against your Google Drive storage limit.\n\n\n\n\nA: I was looking for this 'automatic uploader' too.\nI downloaded the IFTTT app and added a recipe that checks if any new item is added to the camera row and, if so, store to google drive.\n\nA: It sounds like you're looking for the Google Photos app.\n", "Q: Webcam Colored Lines - Hardware Issue? Has anyone seen this before? It's happening with any camera app (Skype, Photo Booth, Hangouts) so it doesn't appear to be software related. I'm assuming it's a hardware issue but I'm wondering if anyone else has seen this before.\nThanks!\n\n\nA: Note that I am GUESSING here but that looks awfully like a damaged sensor. You occasionally see similar displays on LCD panels when they go bad so this might indeed be the hardware error you think it is.\n", "Q: Creating a Bootable USB Drive: unable to download Mavericks again I am following this guide to creating a Bootable USB Drive with Mavericks: How to Perform a Clean Install of OS X Mavericks\nHowever, I cannot find the Install OS X Mavericks.app file in my Applications folder. \nAnd when I go to the app store I am not able to download Mavericks again. Clicking on \"Free\" does nothing. I see no option to download anywhere.\n\nIs there anywhere else that I can get a copy of this file so that I can create the bootable drive?\n\nA: You can not download Maverics Installer if you already have mavericks.\nNext time when you download a major new OS, DO NOT RUN after download.\nFirst find the download and make copy the Installer file.\nThe reason is the Installer will delete it self after installation is complete.\nHow to make a Bootable USB for Mavericks has been discussed and answered here.\nLast not least: There is a Recovery (hidden) partition on you drive.\nWhen called upon that one will recover (repair) your mavericks from the Internet. The recovery can be also done from a USB. as explained here, it only needs a small USB with 1 gig size.\n", "Q: Can upgrade to Mavericks harm Bootcamp NTFS data partition? I consider to upgrade from Mountain Lion to Mavericks. I have two Bootcamp Windows 7 partitions, one for boot & system, another for documents and data. Both Windows partitions are NTFS. OS X recovery partition was manually removed prior to installing Bootcamp/Windows.\nAny risk that upgrade will break either of my Windows partitions? How to minimize the risk? It definitely happened last time I upgraded from Snow Leopard (or Lion?) to Mountain Lion.\nOne post suggests that it happens with any OS X upgrade, though I'm not sure it applies to my situation.\nUpdate: Tried running upgrade, got this message: \"Install Failed: OS X could not be installed on your computer. OS X can't be installed on the disk because a recovery system can't be created. Visit www.apple.com/support/no-recovery to learn more\" which links to another support article (which is surprisingly for Lion) suggesting to manually shrink the OS X partition which will allow space for creating recovery partition. The question is still the same: will it hurt either of my Windows NTFS partitions?\nThis is how my partitions look on OS X side:\n\n\nA: Usually OS X backups don't mess with the partitions, except for when they create a recovery partition. And since your recover partition has been (manually?) removed, OS X will probably try to add it again.\nIf you do the upgrade, definitively back up all your stuff (on the windows side as well!).\nIf you want to play it really safe:\n1 - get an external (usb) drive\n2 - copy your mac-partition to that drive (via disk utility or any other cloning software)\n3 - boot from the external (usb) drive and run the update there\n4 - clone the partition back form the external onto your internal drive \n\nA: My final resolution for this problem is described in this answer to a related question.\nIn a nutshell, I decided to switch to a single partition (reasons detailed here). To migrate, I used WinClone for Windows partition, Time Machine backup for OS X, manually moved all files from Windows data partition to a spare HDD; installed OS X from the scratch (Lion), restored OS X backup over it, re-installed MtLion (this restored the recovery partition); manually create FAT partition with Disk Utility and restore WinClone backup to it; upgrade to Mavericks; move Windows data files to the Windows partition.\n\nA: I upgraded from 10.8 to 10.9 OSX with an XP BootCamp partition and everything worked fine. Both booting as a PC, and with Parallels desktop.\n", "Q: Mavericks - VPN command line I see a lot of third party apps that offer the ability to turn your Mac into a VPN server. It seems the VPN server functionality is built into OS X from what I've read but you need OS X server to get the GUI or a third party tool.\nSo if it's built in, can I configure VPN (DNS, IP, users, etc) from a command line instead of using some GUI? If so, how would I go about configuring everything?\nI want to enable VPN on my Mac Mini (Mavericks) so I can use my iPhone to VPN into my home network. I have an Airport Express and have the proper ports forwarded to my Mac already.\n\nA: On Mac OS X the VPN connections are handled by a daemon vpnd, which should be started at boot by altering /etc/hostconfig so that the line VPNSERVER is set to \"-YES-\".\nDon't do that until you have read and understood the man page for the vpnd configuration plist file and written the file. You can get a good explanation of the file and a template with man vpnd -s 5 at the command line. While testing you can run vpnd from the command line with the \"-d\" option which stops it going to the background and prints the log info to your terminal session - just the thing for watching it all go wrong.\nHave fun! Frankly I pay the $20 or so for the Server app and get the GUI for stuff that fraught with peril - you don't want to get the security on a VPN wrong.\nBTW - If you're going to be playing at the command line then here's a tip - you could have learnt most of that by starting with apropos vpn at the prompt.\n", "Q: Missing Groups After Syncing with iCloud I lost all of my groups when syncing Outlook 2010 with iCloud sync on Windows.\nHow do I get them back?\n\nA: If you do backups look for the .pst-file (office identity) and restore it from a backup.\n", "Q: Converting filenames with embedded backslashes to directory tree I recently extracted a ZIP file that I expected to contain a path hierarchy but turned out to be a flat archive of files with backslashes in the filenames. So I ended up with something like:\n$ ls -1d ./*\nSomeFile.txt\nFoo\\OtherFile.png\nBar\\Baz\\Faz\\foo.txt\n\nAll of these are just siblings in the same single directory. In my actual case, there are several hundred files, so making the directories and moving things by hand would be tedious at best.\nMy current plan is to write a small Python program to put them all where they belong, but I was wondering, is there a quicker easier way to do it from the command line?\n\nA: Python to the rescue!\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport sys, os, os.path\n\ndef treeify(filenames):\n    for fn in filenames:\n        parts = fn.split(\"\\\\\")\n        pathparts = parts[:-1]\n        basename = parts[-1]\n        path = ensurepath(pathparts)\n        os.rename(fn, os.path.join(path, basename))\n\ndef ensurepath(parts):\n    if len(parts) == 0:\n        return \".\"\n    path = os.path.join(*parts)\n    if not os.path.exists(path):\n        os.makedirs(path)\n    return path\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    treeify(sys.argv[1:])\n\nInvoked like:\n$ ~/scripts/tree.py *\n\n", "Q: New iPhone asks for an Apple ID login that is not mine I have just changed my phone from an iPhone 4S to an iPhone 5S. I backed up my old phone to iCloud, then downloaded the backup to my new device.\nWhilst entering the settings app in my new phone, it asked me for the password to an Apple ID that was not mine. It transpired there was an app on my old phone that had been downloaded using this other ID. The app did not appear in \"my purchases\" in the App Store and the phone has never belonged to anyone else. It has only ever been backed up to iCloud or a secure iTunes account on my laptop. \nHow is this possible? I spoke with Apple and they couldn't help.\n\nA: It was a music file that was bought on iTunes by a friend of someone & passed to me on a memory stick by someone else. For some reason (apparently not a random occurence) when you re-install a back up from iCloud it recognises the original purchaser & asks for their id & password. The app was something random & not connected.\n", "Q: Is it currently possible to upgrade iPhone 4 from iOS 5 to iOS 6?

A while ago I made a copy of my Aperture library on my Windows machine in case my Time Machine drive failed. My Time Machine drive failed last night and now I would like to restore this backup.\nWhen I made the backup, I used a direct ethernet connection. A Cat 6 crossover cable between my Mac and my Windows. I transferred the files using SMB. However, that was slow and failed often. \nIs there a better way of transferring this massive folder from my Windows to my Mac?\n\nA: Honestly, if something fast like USB 3.0 or Thunderbolt are available to you, get yourself a small 64GB SSD and a USB 3.0 enclosure, or this (expensive, but a very good long-term investment if you have Thunderbolt. It's actually just a Thunderbolt to SATA adapter, with a fancy name. There are other options, this is just the only one I'm familiar with. ), and you should be able to make those transfers in no time. With such a small SSD, the price should be sub-$100 even for the fast ones.\n\nA: Honestly you get the best throughput using sneakernet for large volumes of data.\nGet yourself a 64 GB thumb drive (or an external USB HD, they are handy things to have!). Format it as ExFAT and copy the files to the thumb drive on the PC, plug 'er into the Mac and copy away...\n\nA: Optimal set-up:\nGoogle Fiber and a lot of storage space via a paid plan with Google Drive or Dropbox.\n(You can use any fast internet service provider... Fiber isn't available everywhere.)\n\nA: Another option if both of the machines are in the same network. You can use netcat on both machines. Remember though, do not use this anywhere else where security is a concern as netcat is fast because it does not have any security layer.\nYou can install window's netcat here: http://joncraton.org/blog/46/netcat-for-windows/\nand on Mac you can use brew to sic it out.\n", "Q: Cannot send the message using the server cox.net I have two 2009 iMacs with OS X 10.9.2 and I am a Cox Communications subscriber.

I use two factor authentication and application passwords so resetting the passwords, while annoying only takes a minute or two.\nAll that by way of saying that you may be having a similar issue: Mail.app forgetting the password.\nChange your email password then go into mail.app -> Preferences -> Accounts and change the Incoming Mail Server password. Then click on the Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP) drop down menu and select Edit SMTP server list. Click on the server for Cox and type in the new password there too.

Remove unwanted items.\nAlso, as you have done, make sure to uncheck the option that shows when logging out to re-open apps.\n\n3. Places to look to actually remove startup items\nThere are some other places that are hidden and you can't fix with a checkbox or button. Check \"/Library/LaunchDaemons\" and \"/Library/LaunchAgents\".\n\nIf none of that helps, you might have a tricky case, and you can try using the Google to find other secrets like this article at Macworld.\n\nA: You need to right click/tap that particular app to reveal a pop-up menu> under Options > un click> Open at Login \nand that should solve it...restart your computer to see if it does it again. This should solve it as I have the same problem with Chrome.\nSee the image attached below: \n\n\nA: There are three official places I know of that unwanted items on startup are controlled:\n1) Login preferences: if you want to delete an item, make sure you highlight it and then click \"-\" instead of just unchecking it. If it is unchecked, it will still start, it will just have a hidden windows.\n\n2) \"General\" - make sure \"Close windows when quitting an application\" is checked. This shouldn't control which applications actually open, but I've seen some people confuse unwanted windows with unwanted apps.\n\n3) The \"Reopen programs when logging back in\" dialog on logout – this should be unchecked.\nIn addition, there are some unofficial tricks you can try:\nDisable ApplePersistence: \ndefaults write -g ApplePersistence -bool no\n\nNote that this will also disable Versions (autosave)\nSet \"System preference>General>Recent items\" to NONE (default is 10)\nref:\nThe first three tips have worked for me; the last two are from https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5538748?start=0&tstart=0\n", "Q: Notification window placement on Mavericks I would prefer my notifications to pup up in the middle of my screen so that I will be sure to notice them. Is there a Pref somewhere to do this? If not, is there an app equivalent to the previous iCal which will do this? Thanks.\n\nA: There is no settings in Notification Preferences to do that.\nHowever, you can switch to Alerts, they will stay until you dismiss them.\nGo to system preferences and open Notifications.\nFor each application you care, switch the notification to Alerts, so now you wont miss them on your screen.\n", "Q: Can't save all photos to iPad air from photostream It might sound strange but trying to save the photo portfolios to my iPad using photostream to transfer from iMac, noticed that in one of the folders not all the photos were saved.\nRepeated several times, the weird thing is that is always the same number of photos missing from photo stream to the destination folder. I really don't know how to address this problem.\n\nA: I don't understand your question completely, but I'm pretty sure:\nYou have reached the sharing limit on Photo Stream or iCloud. Apparently you can only transfer so many photos per hour, or per day. (Read more in the Apple support article.)\nIt might also be that there is a limit on your iPad for memory space. Is your iPad memory full?\n", "Q: Load clash of clans village asking me to update - state of village Recently clash of clans updated. When I logged into a another game centre account it asked me \"Do you want to replace it? if yes type confirm.\" \nWill I lose my other village if I type confirm ?\n\nA: No. I do that all the time. I have a TH 3 village and a TH 8 village. When switching from my TH 8 to TH 3, it gives me the message. I later switch back to my TH 8 and it is perfectly fine. From here (http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/1n51uh/is_it_possible_to_have_2_villages_on_one_device/) it says (quoted from Chief LPFX): \n\nEach time you switch you will get a Game Center Alert asking you if you want to discard this village and load the other one. You may need to type \"CONFIRM\" to continue. Don't worry, the other village is not deleted.\n\nSo, you can switch between them. The CONFIRM message is just to make sure you didn't mean to accidentally switch.\n", "Q: iPhone 3GS no sim error I got an iPhone 3G from a friend and it is showing \"no sim card\" and I know the sim card is good and it won't let me do anything but phone start up. Can anyone help please?\n\nA: Restore that iPhone. If the problem persists: take it to a repair shop. It is probably a hardware problem. I had the same problem myself.\n", "Q: Used iPhone 3G 16G - Worth anything? I currently have a an iPhone 5 64GB I am using and a iPhone 3 16GB I am not using. Planning to upgrade to the iPhone 6 when it comes out later this year. \nI've heard Apple will give you cash off purchase for trade in. Does anyone know what they might give me if I trade one or both in, and whether a combination trade would even be considered?\nOr, would I be better off selling on my own?\n\nA: Although newer iPhones get substantial value (iPhone 4S + 64GB AT&T is up to $150 today), iPhone 3 and 3GS are rapidly becoming worthless in the US. Your phone is may still be worth money in a rebate or gift cart in USA if you exchange it as part of a phone purchase. Apple has an official relationship with PowerOn where the staff in each store checks market conditions from that third party and quotes you an offer when you are shopping.\nApple's plan is documented at http://apple.com/recycling and currently in the US, you can only trade in one device for each iPhone purchase. You can go to that site now and see if they will offer any money, but I'm seeing $0 currently. \nApple staff are trained in evaluating the condition of devices, so you'll get a better read on the price you'll get by having that second opinion. Some people feel their phone is flawless when it isn't. Others mark a phone down for things that would actually fetch price for excellent condition. You can do a little research before going in to the Apple store on:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://gazelle.com\n\n*http://ebay.com (prices here will likely be both higher and lower than what you will get from a company that does Apple's trade in which means you have to do more work to get a fair number)\n\n*http://amazon.com (search for your model and look for Trade In in the right side of the web page under the buy now/add to cart button)\n\n\nI would also research what your local cell carriers have for current promotions. If there is an in-store, verifiable special. You can ask Apple Retail to match the brick and mortar offers if there are case / charger deals locally when you buy.\nIf Apple's deal isn't good enough, look for a carrier or Radio Shack that have $50 for any phone trade in and see what's the best deal overall. I can't imagine it not going for $15 if you put it on ebay for 0.01 and no reserve, but that's a bit more of a gamble than if you were to get an offer from a company that buys used devices.\n", "Q: File tree list Mac Terminal I am trying to create a .txt file that is the output of a certain function in the terminal.\nSo my function is to create a list of all the files that i have inside the folder TEST\nso what i typed was:\nchmod +x /Users/XXXX/Downloads/Terminal.sh\nfind /Users/XXXX/Downloads/Test -not -path '*/.*' >/Users/XXXX/Downloads/TestFiles.txt`\n\nso this will create a file named TestFiles.txt, which will contain a list of all my folders and files inside the folder DOWNLOADS. its works perfectly fine for me\nso my question is…. is there a way to add the size of each file right next to its name on the list in the .txt file?\nThank you\n\nA: Try this:\nfind ~/Downloads/Test -name '*' -exec ls -la -print > ./files.txt {} \\;\n\n~/ is equal to: /Users/XXXX\nThe file \"files.txt\" is saved in the directory that you run this command.\n", "Q: Is the CT3309352 Crucial memory the same as CT2K4G3S1067M? I am trying to help my brother and sister in-law upgrade their 2.26 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Mid 2009 MacBook Pro (MacBook Pro5,5) to Mavericks.\nThe Mac is currently running Mac OS X 10.6.8 and has only 1 GB of DDR3 memory. I know that Mavericks requires a minimum of 2 GB of memory. Therefore I'd like to upgrade the installed memory to at least 4 GB if not 8 GB.\nAccording to the Crucial website I should upgrade to a 8GB Kit (4GBx2), 204-pin SODIMM, DDR3 PC3-8500 memory module. In searching for this module's part number on Amazon I am given the result Crucial 8GB Kit (4GB x 2) DDR3 1066 MT/s (PC3-8500) CL7 SODIMM 204-Pin Mac Memory. The specs appear to be the same but the part numbers are not:\n\n\n*\n\n*CT3309352 - Crucial\n\n*CT2K4G3S1067M - Amazon\n\n\nGiven the mismatched part numbers I am unsure if they are the same memory module. Is the module from Amazon the same? Which should I purchase to upgrade this aging MacBook Pro?\n\nA: Here is the result of my conversation with Crucial. Given their quality and reliability as manufacturer and supplier, I personally am tempted to spend a little more and source the upgrade kit directly from them. If any problems then should be easy to have it fixed.\n[Mark:  Hi Can you tell me if CT3309352 - Crucial and CT2K4G3S1067M are the same part numbers for a Crucial upgrade 8GB kit for the MacBook Pro mid 2009 13\" or are these two similar but different units produced by Crucial?\nCrucial Agent :  When you order by advanced search or by motherboard/system information online, you are shown the “external” part number CT3309352. The part number that you see on your module is the actual module base part number CT2K4G3S1067M. If you order by advanced search or motherboard/system information, the external part number is included in the packing list with your memory module. The modules are exactly the same. They are the same part. And will work in your MacBook Pro mid 2009 13\".\nMark:  Thank you. So you are saying depending on the method of search, you will get two different numbers but they are a reference to the identical unit that will be compatible, with above MacBook Pro?\nCrucial Agent:  For some systems yes. Some times you can look up just by the part number CT2K4G3S1067M and put it in to find it, but it is not always show any results when doing this. Normally only the servers show the actual part number. But this one is listed as compatible for your system and will work.]\nSo there you go this should help.\nCheers\nMark\n", "Q: What are the six openings on the bottom of the MacBook Pro for? I have a 2013 Retina MacBook Pro. I have noticed there are six slits, three on each side, on the base of the laptop.\n\nWhat are these for, and if I were to use them as a place to clip something, would it affect my computer?\n\nA: They're vents for air:\n\n…but they're not just for air. They are also used as part of the structural system of the machine.\n\nThe vents are also part of the structural system creating strong beams that actually increase the rigidity of the overall product.\n\n\nThis Apple video explains it very well:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Neff9scaCCI&t=3m20s\n\nA: Try this...\nPlug your computer in and set it on a table\nPlay a long video from youtube\nafter about 10 minutes but your palm next to those holes on either side of the macbook\nfeel warm air?\nThen they are cooling vents.\nI would be loathe to block these with ANYTHING.\nBut them I am a bit paranoid about keeping my electronics cooled properly...\n", "Q: Can one slice of a \"Disk Utility\" RAID mirror be moved to a new computer? With a 2-disk RAID mirror created in Disk Utility, after one disk fails, can the remaining good disk be moved to a different Mac and used successfully?\n\nA: Theoretically, yes.\nBut remember Apple's RAID solution is software based so both computers should have the same O/S versions. \nBut if you are moving a boot volume AND the hardware is the same it should be cake.\nMoving a boot volume to DIFFERENT hardware... well I've never tried that. It might work and it SHOULDN'T damage the drive data. \nYMMV\n", "Q: In game app updates, bypassing App Store Some apps, I've noticed that developers are able to update their software without submitting them to the App Store. \nFor example, Game of War will occasionally tell you that an update is available and to restart your device.  You can then watch the progress bar carefully and see that updates are being pushed to the app.\nI'm assuming they are using XML to change certain attributes and their location on the server.  That's a guess but I don't know.  They are able to make significant feature changes to the game, like adding hyperlinks to map locations,  push sales promotions, add certain events etc. These methods don't require compilation, as that would obviously require resubmitting the app.\nWhat is Apple's policy in the developer terms or seasoned advice on how to keep from running afoul of behavior that would get your app pulled from the store? \n\nA: I see a lot of games do this and I believe it's OK.\nThink of a game as being 2 pieces: the app (program) and the data it runs on. Apps are generally allowed to download and store data.\nIf an update is merely adding new zones or items represented as various files or tables (with no new programmatic functionality needed), then it only needs to request new static data.\nHowever: game engine updates would require a change to the app and therefore an update via the App Store.\n", "Q: Where is \"All My Files\" folder? I used to think \"All My Files\" is not a real folder but it turns out otherwise. I accidentally moved some of my files into \"All My Files\" folder and now they are disappeared! How can I locate \"All My Files\" folder?\n\nA: Actually, All My Files is a folder, but not the way you'd expect it to be. It exists at the path /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/Resources/MyLibraries/myDocuments.cannedSearch. It is a special type of folder, called a bundle, that has an extension. You can usually access the inner part of these by right-clicking and choosing \"Show Package Contents\", but with All My Files you can't due to Finder's special treatment of it.\nThe bundle contains a file called search.savedSearch which is just a Smart Folder property list. This is a search for all files within your home directory.\nIn your case, this doesn't matter, because when you drag something into the All My Files folder, it goes to ~/Documents. The odd thing about this is it only happens for All My Files, and not other Smart Folders, which don't allow you to drag-and-drop files into them.\n\nA: The All My Files is not a real folder unlike others.\nIs is simply a collection of all files on your mac.\nThey come from all kind of different folders. \n", "Q: \"You shut down your computer because of a problem.\" keeps displaying on every boot I am using a 13\" MacBook Air (late 2013 model) with OS X Mavericks.\nYesterday, my computer hung up and gave me a kernel panic error where it told me in different languages that I needed to restart it. Since that restart, it gives me a notification/warning saying, \"You shut down your computer because of a problem.\" every time I boot it up. I am a Mac Newbie and so dont know what to do. Most articles on the internet deal with what to do when that warning shows up. None of those tell you how to get rid of that warning.

Then using Hazel I automate the filing so that it saves anything in green as a keyword.  Then Hazel auto matches the date and renames and files the PDF based on the Company, Date and total.\nSo as odd as it is I'm not sure how to do this when I get an email receipt or a receipt from a we page.  The only way I can get it to work is to actually print out the receipt and do the same process.\nEvery time I do that it feels like I'm moving backwards in terms of automation.  Does anyone know a way I can highlight a PDF to save as keywords in Hazel?\n\nA: If you open the PDF in Preview, you can manually add keywords to the PDF. There is no need to highlight the words first.\nOpen the Inspector (Command - i) and the click the tab that looks like a magnifying glass.  Click the + button on the bottom left and you can add the keyword.\n\nA: Depending what you use to open the PDF files.\nIn Adobe reader there is a Highlight tool where you can choose the coleor and save it as default.\nIn Preview (which is the default pdf for Mail.app) there is also a Highlight tool and here you can also choose the highlight color.\nIn this example the top line was marked in adobe Reder XI, and the bottom line was marked in Preview application.\n\nHere are the instructions how to make a highlighted text a keyword.\n\n", "Q: Keyboard shows on iPhone 4 on lock screen and home screen I just upgraded to iOS 7.1.

It's a MacBook Pro Mid 2010.\n\n\nA: From looking at the pictures and combining this with the fact that the screen reverts back to normal after turning off the laptop for a few hours, I suspect a hardware problem. Which means that you need to get the laptop to the next Apple Store (or other Apple dealer) to have it fixed.\n", "Q: Disable voice control on iPhone 4s, ios7.1 My partner has a hand-me-down iPhone 4s, and a few months ago, the home button started playing up and not pressing. She started using the on-screen home button instead, which has solved the problem of not being able to press the home button.\nNow though, the home button is more responsive, even too responsive. We started noticing that she had called random people (totally random, not most recent or near the beginning of the alphabet or anything) while the phone was in her bag, and occasionally while locking the phone, it would issue a camera shutter button as if it had taken a screenshot. Now it is frequently activating voice control, even if it is just sitting on the table.\nIt's pretty clear that the problem is that the home button is sticking down sometimes, and is often opening voice control, and as a result, dialling random people (apparently the voice dial software is oversensitive and thinks anything is a name, rather than saying 'sorry, cannot find \"hrrghgsh\" in your contacts'.\nOther people who have had this issue have said that you can turn off voice dial (but not voice control) via settings > general > passcode lock, however my partner's phone has no such setting for voice dial in passcode lock, or anywhere else as far as I can tell.\nCan anyone tell me where voice dial has moved, or if voice control itself can be entirely disabled (as one would expect to be possible) or alternatively, if the home button itself can be entirely disabled?\n\nA: There is a way to make home button not to work wheb the home is lock.\nFirst activate Siri\nsetting >General> Siri > ON\nThen\nIf iphone 5s (may be it work in iphone 4a)\nsetting >Id&passcode> there is an option where it tell to siri off when phone is lock. \nmake sure you put it off.\nThats it home button wont work when phone is lock.\nPreventing voice control to make stupid random call\n\nA: I am experiencing the exact same situation on an iPhone 5. My home button is also sticking and the hyper-sensitive voice control is attempting to call people even when I am silent. As far as I can tell after painstakingly going through every single setting available, and researching on forums etc. The option of disabling voice dialling has been taken out of iOS7.1. I have not been able to find any mention of it anywhere.\nEDIT: After reading through some information in Siri, I have restricted the use of Siri altogether (which may be a possible fix)\nYou can do this at:\nSettings > General > Restrictions (Enter a passcode lock) and deselect the bar next to Siri as allowed content.\n\nA: This setting seems to have been removed.  Prior to 7.1 it was in:\nSettings > General > Passcode > Voice Dial > OFF\nSince 7.1 things have moved around a bit in settings, and the equivalent area would now be:\nSettings > Passcode\n...only the option is absent.  Hopefully it will be returned, as my sticky home buttoned iPhone 4 is also occasionally dialling nonsense for me.\nSo, to summarise, there seems to be no way to turn it off for iOS 7.1 on a non jailbroken iPhone.\n\nA: I am from Brazil and I am facing the same issue with my 4S 7.1;\nThe Voice Control activation occurs suddenly (locked or not; and also while I am using the phone... it closes my current application as a pressed Home Button).

Ok, the phone stop calling people, but other similar things occur with Siri.\nSo, What Did I see? After I turned ON the Siri, I came back to GENERAL->PASSCODE... And NOW, I can see the option to disable VOICE DIAL (SIRI is still ON). After, I disabled SIRI and by now, My phone is working properly!

I'm going to New York soon, and the iPhone 5C is just $99 USD. I am wondering if  an Irish SIM work or if I would have to get it unlocked?\n\nA: When you buy an iPhone in America for $99 it's probably a SIM-lock together with an subscription. Here you can find the different iPhone 5S models. Search on the internet which Cellular frequencies are used by your provider, and then compare on the site I gave you which models you can use. Mostly the $99 models are locked for AT&T, Verizon,... providers only. So when buying an iPhone in America, make sure you check to model nr on the back of the package.\n\nA: You can use your iPhone internationally. Just make sure you get one without sim lock (safest bet is an apple store) \nIt will cost you more than 99$ (That's the price you get with a 2 year contract). \nAnd if you pay tax when importing to ireland, the device will probably cost you about the same. \n", "Q: mid-2011 MBA: sluggish wifi on WPA/WPA2 networks Machine specs: Mid-2011 MacBook Air with a 1.8 GHz Intel Core i7 processor, and 4 GB DDR ram, Intel HD Graphics 3000 384 MB, OS 10.9.2 (Mavericks).\nWifi connection is sluggish with multiple ISPs on various WPA/WPA2 networks (home, friend, family, etc.)  but works fine on large public networks (e.g. Starbucks) as well as the university network where I am a student. My other apple devices (iPhone and iPad mini) work fine on the same WPA networks which are giving my 2011 MBA trouble. \nAfter and in-depth search of this site and a few others, I’ve tried the following trouble-shooting steps to no avail:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hardware inspection of airport card by Apple technician revealed no damage\n\n*Fresh “erase and install” of the OS 10.9.2 (did not use time machine backup out of fear of cloning the problem back onto my machine)\n\n*verified and repaired permissions and disk from Disk Utility\n\n*verified and repaired Keychain \n\n*verified that the wifi was also sluggish in safe mode and restore mode\n\n*hard reset of WIFI by erasing the appropriate system preferences plists\n\n*created a “test” location in Apple network preferences; erased and created Wi-Fi in network preferences\n\n*flashed the PRAM/ NVRAM\n\n*changed DNS servers manually \n\n*checked the activity monitor and ran Sophos Anti-Virus to check for malware, viruses, etc. \n\n*turning off the bluetooth\n\n*dragging the appropriate network to the top of the list\n\n*renewed the DHCP lease from network preferences\n\n*reset the MTU manually to 1453 (default is 1500)\n\n*flushed the DNS cache in Terminal (dscacheutil -flushcache)\n\n*turned the Apple security firewall on and off again\n\n\nAt this point I'm thinking it actually may be a hardware problem that was overlooked by the Applecare technician.  Would it be worth buying a new airport card and installing it myself?\nThanks, all, for the help!\n\nA: Turns out one of the internal antennae in the monitor was not properly connected to the airport card.  After properly securing the antennae the wifi problem was fixed immediately.  Evidently the problem affected the signal strength and reliability, even though it showed full bars on the menu bar.\n", "Q: Is it possible to replace a whole keyboard on a MacBook? I have a German keyboard-layout at my MacBook Air. Is it possible to replace every key to have a English keyboard? \n\nIs the structure and the size of the keys the same in every country?\n\nI want to switch to the English keyboard in the system preferences and also have the keys from the English one!\n\nA: Replacing an entire keyboard on a MacBook (Air or not) is a hard operation or a delicate operation if you just do the key caps. It is in the realm of possible, but almost never is it practical. The systems are designed to have the top case swapped out and over time, the battery is also becoming part of the top case in some cases as are the keyboard caps. Where they require delicate tools and glue / adhesive skills to replace parts other than the whole top case.\nIn every case I've seen, there is at least one difference (typically a handful of differences on the 82 or so keys) in the key cap physical size between a US model and a european model. Total replacement of keycaps isn't a viable option.\nApple doesn't sell key caps to end users, so you will want to look up a Service Provider to ask them what they would charge you to sell you the black replacement caps if you ordered a set for the US model of your Mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://locate.apple.com\nYou'll also ask them how much the scissors underneath would cost (and how long parts take to arrive) in case you break the delicate plastic parts while removing the caps. My guess is you'll get many of the keys replaced easily for not a whole lot of money, but the special keys will be shaped in a way that you can't replace them.\nSource: How to identify keyboard localizations\nGerman (G):\n\nUS:\n\n\nA: I changed my MacBook keyboard the other way around from QWERTY to QWERTZ and I had no problem changing the keys. There weren't that many actually only some special characters and some number keys. Totaling about 10 keys. A lot of amazing replacement videos are on YouTube to help!\nI didn't exchange the Enter, Shift, etc. because the Enter is different between US and DE layout. The replacement keys were found on this site: my-laptop-setup.com. Keys look 100% like the original \n\nA: Observe the pictures that bmike added. I found this out the hard way. The enter-key is differently sharped between US and Scandinavian layout. It seems like have to cut one aluminium space/bridge OR buy a scandinavian topcase.

I found this informative post about completely disabling audio on OS X by removing/disabling the required audio kernel extensions. The problem is this disables audio-in and audio-out, and I only want to disable audio-in.\nI'm looking to completely disable audio-in, in a way which cannot be re-enabled by unprivileged users, not just muting it. How could I accomplish this?\n\nA: Disabling Input\nTo disable the input, I'm not entirely sure.  Here's what I thought of:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use a internal audio input device like SoundFlower, which basically routes the audio output into the audio input.\n\n*You can mute the volume (although you said you don't want to do only that)\n\n*You could take a look around the /System/Library/Extensions/ folder and in the IOAudioFamily.ktexts file for anything useful, however that can muck up OS X.\n\n\nPreventing Changes\nDisabling underprivileged users from changing the settings isn't actually too hard:\n$ sudo chmod 700 /System.Library/PreferencePanes/Sound.prefPane\n\nWill do the trick.  Loading the preference pane from any user (other than root) will display an error.\n\nA: Insert a Minijack (headphones) in the Macbook's minijack input, option click on the Volume item in the Menu Bar and select use Audio Port for input:\n\n\nA: chmod 700 still allows the current user to change sound prefs, chmod 000 would allow only root to change prefs.\n$ sudo chmod 000 /System.Library/PreferencePanes/Sound.prefPane\n\n\nA: I believe you can just adjust the input volume to the lowest setting (it is a slider within system preferences => sound => input). Move it to the far left and leave the rest the same. \nBe sure and select the correct device for sound input when making your adjustments. \n", "Q: Disabling App Nap in Mavericks I want to disable App Nap globally on a late 2009 iMac desktop running Mavericks, is this possible?\n\nA: Yes you can by setting NSAppSleepDisabled globally:\ndefaults write -g NSAppSleepDisabled -bool true\n\n", "Q: Deleted Safari and now I cannot get it back. Mavericks I deleted my Safari browser and now I would like to download it again but it seems that this option is not as easy to be done. I'm running OS X Mavericks at the moment, and there is no download for Safari on the Apple page except for those before OS X Lion.\n\nA: Safari gets reinstalled:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sometimes when you download and install a Combo Updater.\n\n*Always when you reinstall the OS.\n\n\nYou could also use a tool like Pacifist to get the app from the install package (or Time Machine from your backup), but it depends on how you lost the app whether you want to go in like a surgeon or have the deluxe treatment. Unless you are sure you can use Pacifist, I'd start with the Combo and then move to the normal installer.\n\nA: You can copy Safari from the recovery partition:\ndiskutil mount Recovery\\ HD\nhdiutil mount /Volumes/Recovery\\ HD/com.apple.recovery.boot/BaseSystem.dmg\ncp -R /Volumes/OS\\ X\\ Base\\ System/Applications/Safari.app /Applications\n\nAlternatively redownload an OS X installer from App Store and then use Pacifist:\n\n\nA: Download and install Safari 7.1 manually, directly from Apple. This is the same link the App Store uses to check for updates. (Note that if you install that package on anything other than Mavericks — assuming Installer would even permit such a thing to happen — you will probably cause more harm than good.

I have to get on a Mac computer to do that.\n\nA: If your iPhone is syncing with iCloud properly your add button will disappear until the system finishes syncing.  If the sync is frozen, you can toggle iCloud Calendars off in Settings>iCloud, restart the iPhone, and then turn Calendars on again to restart the OTA sync.  If there still is no add button sync iPhone with iTunes to restore the calendar app.  On rare occasions you might have to restore the iPhone firmware.\n", "Q: How can I achieve higher quality results from my bargain based 4K monitor? I just got the latest 2013 15.4-inch MBP 2.6GHz and I also have the 39-inch Seiki 4K television. \nI previously had a 2010 MBP 15.4-inch 2.53GHz and used a Mini-HDMI to connect to the 4K which was able to support 1920 x 1080p at 30Hz and 3840 by 2160p at 24Hz. 4K videos on Youtube had a picture that looked fantastic, but the 24Hz really put my ongoing enthusiasm in a bind.\nSince I've upgraded to the latest MBP, which is in every way superior to my old build, how can I best utilize the new features and power to get the most out of the 4K or at least improve the 24Hz rate.\nAre there any best practices to follow for movies, audio, browsing etc when you have a choice between Thunderbolt2, USB3.0, HDMI, etc? Are the dual graphics enough to push 4K at a rate above 24Hz? \nPerhaps there is a single cable that can solve all my problems.\n\nA: Here is some information:\nApple lists the 2013 MacBook Pro with Intel Iris Technology as being able to run a 4K display at 4096-by-2160 resolution and 24 Hz as well as 3840-by-2160 displays at 30 Hz over its HDMI port. \nThe latter is the resolution of the Seiki and conveniently as high as it goes at 4K – HDMI 1.4 is limited at these rates. \nSome manufacturers say that they will update their HDMI 1.4 to 2.0 which can do higher frame rates, but Seiki has made no such promise.\n", "Q: Unable to modify the volume with the keyboard Sometimes, when I connect an external set of headphones/speakers, I am unable to change the volume. When I press one the volume keys, I see the image below. \nWhy does this happen? Interestingly, if I am playing music using software that has a volume control (e.g. Spotify or Youtube) I can still change the volume with the mouse using the application's volume bar. However, the system's volume bar is greyed out and can't change it either.\n\n\nA: I think I found a quicker and easier fix. At least it works for me.\nWhen the volume keys don't respond (happens pretty often and I haven't figured out why) I simply put the computer in sleep mode then re-awaken it. Takes a few seconds but it works every time.\n\nA: If all else fails, open a terminal window and type the following to adjust it your volume:\nsudo osascript -e \"set Volume 5\"\n\nYou can change to \"5\" to a higher or lower number to make the volume go up and down\n\nA: Simple Hack: Plug in a pair of headphones, then unplug them. This will allow you to control the volume again.\n\nA: This happened to me too I just shutdown the mac and turned it on again, after this it was back to normal. \n\nA: This icon appears when the external device or application has taken over and is to be used to adjust volume. \nThat also means the internal speakers are disabled. \nTo verify, go to system preferences sound, and look in the output tab which device is to be used to adjust volume.\nSee following example\nIf I select the Sharp TV I will get the icon like you have if I try to adjust volume on may mac, so i have to use the TV volume adjustment.\nHowever if i select Internal speakers the volume adjustments works on my mac.\n\n\nA: I just plugged an audio device back into my macbook air, worked. didn't need to put to sleep or do some code or restart. \n\nA: What worked for me: open up a Terminal window and run:\nsudo killall coreaudiod\n\nYou may also need to run the following two commands right after:\nsudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext \nsudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext\n\n\nA: I tried all the other answers (enabling the internal speakers, killing coreaudiod, putting the computer to sleep), but the only thing that worked for me was a reboot.\nI also read somewhere that rebooting into safe mode might fix it, but thankfully I didn't need to do that.\n\nA: The easiest way to fix this when it happens to me (usually when I unplug my headphones) is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences -> Sound\n\n*Adjust the slider bar at the bottom where it says \"Output volume\".\n\n\nEven a small adjustment to the aforementioned slider bar re-enables the keyboard volume controls for me.\nThe question I actually want answered is why the problem happens in the first place. Please let me know if anyone finds out.\n\nA: I just rebooted and it worked for me! Been having this trouble since I did the last round of updates.\n\nA: I had this problem twice within this week, first time it happened.\nI checked the settings but did not have any other audio device connected. Tried putting my computer to sleep and waking it again, tried quitting the sound applications and started it again, all didn't work. \nWhat worked was I adjusted the volume in the settings by dragging the volume bar manually and I was able to use my volume buttons again.\nKinda annoying.\n", "Q: When is a ethernet-to-thunderbolt cable necessary? With the upgraded wireless on the latest 2013 MBP's when would I need this cable? I do have a Time Machine but the rate of data transfer wouldn't increase from having thunderbolt since the speed would only be as fast as its the slowest technology. \nWhat else can I use it for?\n\nA: The main reason for Apple to develop the Ethernet-to-thunderbolt cable is because the Macbook Pro retina line is too thin to fit the ethernet Port, thunderbolt is thin enough to fit. If you have a MacBook Pro retina you have 2 choses:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Wifi\n\n*Buy the Ethernet-to-thunderbolt cable to use cabled internet on you Macbook Pro retina\n\n\nThe only reason: People who don't have wifi, don't want to use it, don't have a fast rooter,... \nIf you have a normal unibody macbook pro there is no reason to buy the cable. :)\n\nA: If you have WiFI wherever you go to with your MBP you probably won't need this cable. But there are places where the only network connectivity is available via Ethernet (hotels without WiFi for instance), also some people don't like running a WiFi at home to avoid the radiation.\n", "Q: i tried reseting all of my data on my ipod touch to unjailbreak now stuck black screen after apple logo ok so today i wanted to reset my jailbroken ipod touch 2g because it was having some issues. i went into settings, general, something like reset, then something like reset all data and content. after i pushed that it did the regular loading bar thingy and when it restart, i got the apple logo then a black screen. no loading circle of death, just a sad lightish blue black screen. now, before that, my ipod just went to recovery mode, so i thought, why not rejailbreak it, so i did that and thats how i got it working again. then the whole reset stuff and now this. i have tried just about everything, dfu mode, recovery mode, ipsw restores on both itunes and redsn0w, and when i do that, in redsn0w, when you think things are going good, it brings up a loding bar and does nothing. itunes dows the same. please help. alll ideas are appreciated. thankyou\ndaniel\n\nA: Hold both buttons down until iPod-touch resets.

Is it possible for thunderbolt to transmit power to or from a Macbook Pro. Perhaps to power/charge it or power/charge an external device?\n\nA: According to Apple, yes, it can carry power for devices in some circumstances. Specifically:\n\n7. Does the Thunderbolt port supply power to connected devices?\nYes. A Thunderbolt port supplies power if that Thunderbolt port is part of a device that is connected to an AC power outlet or is operating on battery power. If your Thunderbolt devices have their own power supplies, you should connect the power supplies to them for optimal functionality. If you are using Thunderbolt devices that get their power only from the Thunderbolt bus, computers running on battery power will experience battery drain more quickly.\n\nThe Thunderbolt specs on the Wikipedia page for Thunderbolt currently say the copper-based version of the Thunderbolt protocol can deliver 18 V at 550 mA (9.9 W max). Presumably all Thunderbolt cables are built to this spec and can handle that kind of power passing through them. Whether the connected device can supply that kind of power is another question that can only be answered by looking at specific devices.\nThunderbolt over an optical, instead of copper, connection would not be able to carry any power with the data signal. I note this only because Thunderbolt was original designed to be an optical protocol; though its since been adapted to copper which is a good thing.\n", "Q: Time Machine backup of renamed computer fails After getting a new MacBook Pro recently, I decided to reuse my old MacBook Pro as a home server. I reformatted the disk and reinstalled OS X, giving the computer a different hostname (let's call it NewHostname) in the process. \nNow I want to back up the computer to the same Time Capsule I was using before. However, there is already an encrypted backup of the computer on that Time Capsule from when it was still called OldHostname. When I try to set up Time Machine, it returns an error message saying \"The disk \"DiskName\" already contains an encrypted backup for this computer.\" This appears to be referring to the old sparsebundle image. \nThe only options Time Machine offers are to continue using the old sparsebundle or to erase it and start a new encrypted backup. Is there any way I could keep the old sparsebundle and start a new backup? And how does it even know that this encrypted file happens to correspond to this computer when the hostnames don't even match?\nNote: I've already tried renaming the file in Finder from OldHostname.sparsebundle to OldHostname-old.sparsebundle, but that didn't work.\n\nA: Try to use tmutil inheritbackup:\nsudo tmutil inheritbackup /Volumes/Data/OldHostname.sparsebundle\n\nFrom man tmutil:\ninheritbackup {machine_directory | sparsebundle}\n        Claim a machine directory or sparsebundle for use by the current\n        machine.

I have rebooted my iPod and I have sent the video via email to myself but I still cant play it. I dont want to delete this video as I know the video is important and I know where its from. What can I do to get it to play? \n\nA: I like to use a VideoLan application.\nIt does not look like much but it works like charm and it is very easy to use.\nYou can download a Mac version here.\nOr in your case the iOS version here.\nIt is a Video player that plays anything, it's safe to use, and I had it for years and play all my videos on it.\nSince the Video was send to you it might be in a format that your iPod can not play.

(100 devices, ad-hoc)\nSomehow the game got leaked on a site that offers .ipa apps for jailbreaked devices.\nCan I get in trouble with Apple because of this? (Can Apple see that the app got installed on more than the usual 100 devices?)\n\nA: If it is your app, you should probably notify Apple. If you are testing for someone else, notify the developer and Apple. It really isn't your fault. To your second question (\"Can Apple see the the app got installed on more than the usual 100 devices), I'd say no. Because jailbroken users use methods such as iFunBox or vShare/AppCake, Apple has no way of keeping track of how many times the app was downloaded unless they used the Apple way. Finally, I'd try to find out how your/the app was leaked. \n\nA: It is almost impossible to get it back even you notify Apple because there are so many Installous alternatives like those mentioned vshare, appcake, ifunbox, kuaiyong, and those site usually has people download and upload apps. I will sort out why the app is leak if I were you.\n", "Q: Context menu got empty separator I’ve got empty lines in context menus, what is it and how could I get rid of it?\n\n\nA: Got it, it was an outdated TotalFinder plugin. Installed the newest and context menu is OK now.\n", "Q: Apple mail and a POP3-only mail account I have set up a mail account with Apple Mail. What I realized only when it was \"too late\", the mail server does not provide IMAP (only for a fee), and thus roundabout 100 E-Mails were downloaded and removed from the server.\nCan I somehow upload those emails back up to the server?\n\nA: With a POP account you can't \"send\" (upload) email to the server.\nAs \"Buscar 웃\" told you, if you have another email account (with IMAP of course), you can upload emails from the first account (POP account) to a folder on the second account (IMAP account).\nTo do that, first you create a new folder on the IMAP account, then you select all the emails you want to \"transfer\", then do a right-click on the selection and select \"Copy To > the folder previously created\". I recommend you to copy (Copy To) emails instead of move (Move To) them, to prevent any emails’ loss if an error occurs during the transfer.\n\nA: If you have a second email account, send the emails in question back to the first one.\nThey will appear in your online email.\n\nA: Only by forwarding, POP does not allow uploading/syncing of messages. \nBut why would you want the mails to be on the server if you already have them on your mac?\n", "Q: Why I can't see the “price” tab in itunes producer I'm submiting my first book to the Ibook store.\nProblem : In Itunes Producer, I can't see the \"price\" tab ? Do you know why ?\n\nA: When you create an account on iTunes Connect in order to distribute books, you can either create a Free Books Account or a Paid Books Account.\nApparently, for the Price tab to appear in iTunes Producer, you have to be logged in with a Paid Books Account. Make sure you followed the right procedure when you did create your account. If you didn’t, I’m quite sure you can somehow switch from Free to Paid. I don’t know how, though.\n", "Q: iCloud alternative for a calender sync I am looking for an alternative to iCloud's calender sync between my Mac and my iPhone. Like many others, I really didn't appreciate the fact that you're now forced to use iCloud to sync your calender...\nSo I'm looking for an alternative to either locally via USB sync my calendar with my iPhone, are to get a server on my MacBook for this purpose, which would only accept connections from my LAN. Or a totally different application for both Mac OS and iOS, syncing over USB. What I don't want is uploading my data to a server that I don't own: iCloud, Google...\nI have read this alternative: sync calendar and contacts without iCloud in Mavericks but the reviews are not really good for this app... erasing instead of sync is not an option for me!\nThen I was thinking about something like Radicale, i.e. setting up a server but I'm a bit worried about all the problems arising from security issues etc.\nWhat would you suggest? Is there even something like this out there?\n\nA: Update: According to developers/macrumors local sync is back in the latest beta of iTunes, and will hopefully be back in the next release as well.\nLike you already said - being worried about security issues when you run the server locally is reasonable. You probably will never get your local server as safe as apple has made their iCloud Server. \nI honestly don't think your calender is so interesting that anybody would want to hack it, bur that's your decision after all. \nI currently don't know of any app that syncs via usb. Sync mate doesn't work under mavericks, but they said an update would come in \"winter\" this year. \nIf you want to go local, I'd recommend using OS X server. \n\nA: I don't think that syncing over USB is your goal, but rather ensuring that your data only lives on your server and not in the public cloud (iCloud, Dropbox, etc).  With that in mind, the simplest solution is to purchase and install OS X Server.  \nIf you install OS X Server, you can run your own server.  OS X Server includes mail, calendar, and contacts servers (IMAP, CalDAV, and CardDAV, respectively).  These servers and protocols should be secure enough for your needs.  Macworld magazine did a great write-up of how to set up OS X Server for calendar and contacts.  \nPersonally, I use an old Mac as a server at home, which means that I don't have to sync only when I'm near my laptop.  You'll have to decide for yourself whether this is worthwhile to you.  I've been running a server for this purpose (amongst others) at home for several years.  \n", "Q: Small external hard drive in time machine I have a external hard dive that is smaller than the hard drive of the computer.

Could be helpful since I'm a PHP developer, otherwise I'll consider to buy an QWERTY keyboard.\nThanks\n\nA: For the Apple French or Belgian azerty layouts, [] should be at option plus shift plus ().\n", "Q: Indian Rupee Symbol On OS X, Shift-Option-2 prints the Euro symbol €. \nIs there a shortcut to print the Indian Rupee Symbol ₹?\n\nA: DefaultKeyBinding.dict\nCreate ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict and enter\n{ \"$~2\" = (insertText:, \"₹\"); }\n\nThis rebinds ⇧⌥2 to insert ₹\n$ = ⇧, ~ = ⌥\nQuit and reopen applications for the change to take effect\n\nA: You could use the Text replace function.\n\nNow every time you type Rupee (or Rup, or what ever you like to use) in a text document it will be replace with the Rupee symbol.\nThis solution is my preference since there are No special finger breaking key combination, and nothing to remember.\n\nA: There might be one if you are using a keyboard layout from around that part of the world (I don't know). Also, there might be an easier way to do this, I am not an expert.\n\n\n*\n\n*go to System Preferences > Keyboard\n\n*click \"Show Keyboard and Character Viewers in Menu Bar\"\n\n*In the new menu bar item select \"Show Character Viewer\" \n\n*Select \"Currency Symbols\"\n\n*Right click the ₹ and select Copy Character Info\n\n*Paste this into Text Edit and then copy just the ₹ itself\n\n*Go back to System Preferences > Keyboard > Text\n\n*Click the + to add a new text replacement value\n\n*Pick a memorable but seldom used key combination (unfortunately here you cannot use modifier keys)\nFor the last step I used \"rupee\" which caused that symbol to appear while I was writing these instructions. (I then deleted it which is why I was able to type \"rupee\")\n\nA: Work through the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences → Keyboard\n\n*Check ‘Show keyboard and character viewers in menu bar’\n\n*Open Microsoft Word → Preferences → AutoCorrect\n\n*In the Replace: column type rs.\n\n*Copy Paster the ₹ character.\n\n*In the With: column, right click and paste the copied ₹ character.\n\n*Alternatively, in the Replace: column, you can choose to input ® character by pressing Option key and r button simultaneously.\n\n\n\n\n\nA: This is because some Apps like Google Chrome do not use the Apple built-in text expansion feature but instead override it with their own keyboard handling mechanism. Usually, this is the reason why you cannot find those Apps that go against some default Apple's standards in the Appstore because they would be limited.\nIn the case of Chrome, there is little you can do about it since that is a closed source App and that is how it was made. However, there are a lot of add-ons in Chrome that does the exact same job, and sometimes even better with some more advanced features. Here is one.\nWhat I personally recommend is using an external App for all your text expansions that work globally with all Apps. The one I have been using for a long time is TextExpander for Mac. You can try their free trial. It offers a lot of programmable expansions that comes handy in a lot of daily conversations/emails.\nIf you would like a free hack instead, try this: \nWhen in chrome just press (⌘Space), this will open the spotlight search bar, write your shortcut text, it will expand after hitting space. Select it all (⌘A), copy it (⌘C), then hit the (Escape key) and paste your full text (⌘V) where you want to. \nThis workaround might seem a lot when reading it, but it is really a 2-second process when it sticks to your muscle memory.\nSource: https://www.quora.com/How-can-OS-Xs-Keyboard-Text-Replacement-be-used-in-all-text-entry-fields-within-the-OS\n\nA: If you are using an Input Source for one of the languages of India, you can normally use opt + 4.  Except Devanagari Qwerty, where it is on the ] key.\nI do not know if this is region-specific or what, but it DOES work out of the box without editing any settings.\n\nA: Suggesting inserting a shortcut instead of editing the keyboard layout is IMAO a horrible suggestion.\nGrab Ukelele and edit it properly™, instead.\ni.e. if what you want to do is modify your keyboard layout, what you should actually do is... surprise surprise... modify your keyboard layout. Using workarounds such as those suggested is insane.\n", "Q: Some apps won't run after upgrade to iOS 7.1, how to fix? I update to the newest 7.1 yesterday.  Now some of my apps will not open.  Is there a way to delete this update?\n\nA: Try shutting down all apps by double clicking the home button, then swiping all of the apps up to the top of the screen to quit them then reboot your phone by holding down the Home & Power button at the same time until it prompts you to shut down.\nGo ahead and restart it again. If it still won't fully launch, you may have gotten a bum download. To delete the app, tap and hold on the icon until the 'x' appears and tap that 'x'. Go back to the app store and then reinstall the app and give it another try.\n\nA: No, unless backing up to a file without this update, for example a backup on your PC. The best thing you can do is unistall those apps (Holding your finger on the app, until the start to shake, then with the cross on the right top the application or via Settings). And reinstall. If this won't work it'll probably be an error in the application, and probably soon fixed by the developer.\n\nA: This happened to me too, my password manager app \"Keeper Data Vault\" crashes immediately every time it's opened. Worked fine prior to 7.1 update. And since the makers of this app have abandoned this version and replaced it with a new version which forces you to sign up and give them money regularly, I'm not hopeful of recovering my passwords. \nIf only I could roll back to iOS7.0, recover my passwords from Keeper and then find a better password manager app that doesn't cheat and rip-off its customers.  \n\nA: The Facebook app didn't work after this update on my iPhone 4, but after I re-installed the app it worked.\nTry deleting your app and re-installing it.\n", "Q: iCloud Keychain not syincing all iPhone wifi passwords to Mac I recently upgraded my iPhone 4s to the latest ios 7.1 and my macbook pro to Mavericks and have set up iCloud Keychain sync on both devices. \nMy problem is that I'm connected to a wifi network on my iPhone and want the password synced to my laptop but when I click on the network on my laptop it asks for a password to this specific Network. On my laptop I'm connected to another wifi network already but it's very slow. Plus, when I was at home this past weekend with fast internet I'm sure it gave my laptop time to synchronise with my iPhone.  \nBut why has all other wifi network passwords been transferred to my laptop but not the one I want to connect to? \n\nA: I was having the same problem as you. I solved it by turning my phone into a hotspot briefly for my laptop, which allowed it to sync new passwords, and then I just clicked on the network, and it didn't prompt me for a password, just connected.\n\nA: It should sync via internet (icloud), unless maybe the ports needed are blocked on said network. \nSince this is just a single case, save yourseld the headache of troubleshooting and just enter the password again on your mac..\n", "Q: OSX Mavericks Root User I know it is possible to enable root user and then logging in as the root user. But is it possible to get root access with your admin account in OSX Mavericks?\nIt is kinda annoying to always type the password whenever you are installing stuff and using the terminal.\nLast resort would be to always login as the root user?\n\nA: sudo asks for the admin password only if you haven't used the command in the last 15 minutes or so. For extended root sessions I usually run sudo -s to create a new shell with root privileges. \n\nA: Theoretically speaking, you could add your admin account into the wheel group, then use visudo to edit the sudoers file to allow your user account to execute commands as root. Not only would you have root privileges automatically in Terminal, it would also apply to the GUI as well (no more entering passwords when installing packages or unlocking preferences). However, granting root access to any account other than the root user is a Bad Idea and would be the Wrong Thing to do. The security ramifications of doing this are extreme, and could seriously mess up your system if you don't know what you're doing (and even if you do).\nBut you did want to know if it was possible.\n", "Q: Remove MacBook from Apple ID, is extended warranty still valid after that?

However over the past 2-3 days I get an error when I try to add new songs to iCloud:\nWe could not complete your iTunes Store request.\nAn unknown error occurred (4010).\n\nThere was an error in the iTunes Store. Please try again later.\n\nI have restarted iTunes, rebooted my Mac but it made no difference.\nResearching online shows lots of people going through all kinds of steps such as blowing away their whole iTunes library to fix this - often without success.  As this is not a new problem I am hoping someone will know the proper fix for it.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: So what worked for me was to sign out of iTunes Store then sign back in.  This will disable iTunes Match. You then need to turn Match back on. It looks like it is starting completely from scratch (!) but it doesn't and instead adds all songs to iCloud that were missing.\nI had 3 albums to add and I had to go through this process for each one.  I am assuming that something has changed or gone wrong on Apple's server side for it to start behaving this way when it previously worked fine.\n\nA: I've gotten this error message when I've manually added mp3s to iTunes and it attempts to do the match. \nHappened again just now and I tried a simple Store > Update iTunes Match and it seemed to jumpstart the process and complete it. \nRemains to be seen if this will fix all future occurrences of this error message.\n\nA: I got this error after importing songs from another iMac. After diligent troubleshooting, I found the cause of the 4010 error in my case. I had been using iTunes Family Sharing, and the songs that had been downloaded from other family members' accounts were the ones triggering the error. (I found this by selectively uploading only certain songs to iTunes, and discovered that all the songs that triggered the error contained other user names in the song purchase field.) After deleting from my library the songs purchased by other family members, I was able to use iTunes Match again, and did not get the 4010 error. Then I was able to re-download the family song purchases.\n\nA: It started a couple of weeks ago for me. I am using the newest MacBook Pro with all the latest updates. I find that I have to restart the entire machine then start iTunes again. So far, it works every time. Restarting the entire machine is really a hassle, but it does work. Once it works, it will get the same error if you try it again before restarting the machine. \nPS: I have spoken directly with AppleCare and nobody seems to know what the 4010 error message means.\n\nA: In the menubar in the \"store\" menu try turning off iTunes Match, reboot, and turn it on again\n\nA: Rebooting iTunes match works for the songs you try to put onto iCloud, but once you start adding more songs and attempt to put those onto iCloud, you have to reboot again. This has also been happening to me over the past couple days, and I'm not sure why. It's getting really annoying having to reboot iTunes Match every song or so.\n", "Q: How can I give my sister my iPad 2 with the videos and music from my iTunes account intact? I want to give my sister my old iPad without deleting the videos and music I've put on the device. What do I need to do to deactivate it from my iTunes account without deleting the video and music content?\n\nA: Once she decides to sync the device once, the contents will still be removed. Your sister won't be able to back up the videos and music or sync it to her iCloud, but it should keep playing all the media for months to come. If she erases it or syncs it with a new computer - she can return it to you for a reload or just start fresh with her songs at that point.\nTo remove your accounts, open the Settings App:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the passcode (optional but nice to for her to choose one)\n\n*iCloud - tap Delete Account and delete all the content.

When I am on my iPhone, I move emails to folders (Evernote, Nozbe, or Archives) depending on how I want to process them.  \nWhen I get back to the office, I forward those emails one at a time.  There has to be a way to automate this so that when my Mac discovers, for example, that there is an email in the Evernote folder, it just forwards it to my unique Evernote email address.\nI am a novice at scripting and I don't know how to make this work.  I tried using Apple Mail rules, but I don't see where I can identify emails based upon the folder they are in. Automator doesn't have a service for forwarding emails in Apple Mail (though I see they have one for Outlook).\nAny ideas? I'd toast a cold one in honor of someone who would help a brother out. ;-)\n\nA: So bmike got me rethinking my question, and I found a slightly different solution to the problem: Automatically forward \"Starred in Gmail\" messages to OmniFocus\nIn this case, I just set a gmail script that, when I flag an email (or \"star\" on gmail), it forwards the email to a specific address, and then unflags the email.  Not exactly what I set out to do, but a solution nonetheless.\nThe only caveat is that my labels idea would be able to forward emails to different special email accounts (you could have one for omnifocus, one for Evernote, etc.), but if I'm going to be picky, I should learn to code, right?\n\nA: If you're using Gmail anyway than there is another option that might work for you.  IFTTT has a Gmail channel, which will allow you to forward that email to another address whenever a specific label is added. This should be a good option for what you are trying to do.\n", "Q: iTunes keeps asking about incoming network connections Since I’ve upgraded to Mavericks (10.9, then 10.9.1), the system has been asking if iTunes (up to the current 11.1.5) should accept incoming network connections every time it launched it.\nI’ve tried reinstalling the app, to no avail. Running the app on a fresh account (hence with default preferences and empty library — does it even need inbound connection by default?) doesn’t display the dialog.\nI’ve tried removing the preferences file and the iTunes directory from the ~/Library folder, yet again with no result.\nI’ve check the signature of the app with:\n$ codesign -v /Applications/iTunes.app\n/Applications/iTunes.app: a sealed resource is missing or invalid\n\nIt thus seems I have an app signature issue.\nWhat should I try next?\n\nA: I reinstalled iTunes again, and this time was successful.\n\nA: Did you have enable the firewall in System Preferences ? (\"System Preferences > Security ..\")\nIf yes I think the problem if there. You can disable it or if you want to keep it active you can click on \"Firewall options\" and manually add iTunes and \"allow  incoming network connections\".

To do so just:\n\n\n*\n\n*Locate the Keychain Access application, under /Applications/Utilities.\n\n*Choose Keychain Access > Keychain First Aid.\n\n*Enter your User name and Password.\n\n*Select Verify and click Start. \n\n*If any problems were found, select Repair and click Start again.\n\n\nIt could be, too, that you've changed your account password without using the Accounts Preferences pane. If that is the case, for your default keychain to be unlocked automatically when logged in, you'll have to Synchronize your Keychain Access and login passwords. To do so just:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Keychain Access. \n\n*From the Edit menu, choose Change Password for Keychain \"login.\"\n\n*Type the former password of the account that you are currently logged in to, then click OK. \n\n*If you entered the correct password, a new window appears; enter the original password again in the Current Password field. \n\n*In the New Password field, type the password that matches your current account password.\n\n*Re-enter the newer password in the Verify field, then click OK.\n\n\nThis is needed because, as Apple explains it:\n\nIf you change your account's password using your Mac OS X Install disc (or if your network-based account password is changed due to a network admin forcing a password change), your default keychain password (which uses the same initial password as your user account) does not change. Because of this, you will be prompted to enter a keychain password each time an application requires authentication that your keychain would normally provide.\n\n\nA: You have 2 Options:\nOne is to just open the keychain at log in and leave it open - this is not recommended\n2- open keychain find the application(s) in question and give them access\nsee example\nyou have to select the Allow all applications to access this item\n\n\nA: I had the same problem. It has bothered me for several weeks on my new Mac. It should be caused by changing Mac password using 3rd party software. On macOS El Capitan and  Sierra, there is no Keychain Access > Keychain First Aid. Changing login keychain's password does not help. To solve this problem, you have to reset your default keychain.\nPlease note: you'll lose all your passwords stored in it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Keychain Access, which is in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder. \n\n*Choose Preferences from the Keychain Access menu (or Cmd,), then click the Reset My Default Keychain button in the preferences window. After you enter your new password (same to the password of your Mac account), Keychain Access creates an empty login keychain with no password. Click OK to confirm. (If you don't see a Reset My Default keychain button, close the preferences window and select the “login” keychain from the left side of the Keychain Access window. Press the Delete key, then click Delete References.)\n\n*Choose Log Out from the Apple menu to return to the login screen.\n\n*Log in to your account.

You may see the colour wheel of death when you get the certificate trust prompt from some applications, like Microsoft Remote Desktop or Microsoft Office (weird but it happened only with these to me!).\nOnce you see the colour wheel, your only option is to reboot and after this you will get several prompts for the keychain password BUT you would have to type your old password even if you previously reconfigured Keychain Access to use the same password.\n\nA: You need to create a new keychain if admin has changed your password.\nPer a deleted Apple Support article:\n\nThe keychain password is available only to the user and not the administrator. If the login password is reset by the administrator, the keychain password is not changed. The user is asked to reset the keychain password during the next login. If the login password was reset because the user forgot the old password, the keys, passwords, and other information in the keychain won’t be accessible, and the user will need to create a new keychain.\n\nAlso here and here.\n\nA: I came across this same issue on El Capitan, and had already searched and tried all suggestions on here.\nMy solution was to disable FileVault under System Settings > Security & Privacy and everything works fine again.\nUpdate: \nBefore you downvote because you can't understand how someone can disable the default FileVault encryption: I don't see the downside of disabling FileVault. For really sensitive data, other tools such as Symantec Drive Encryption / PGP or TrueCrypt can be used. At least it doesn't get in the way like FileVault does with the system keychain.\nAs mentioned in the comments, I had searched on SO for this questions and found several answers, of which none worked for me. Therefore disabling FileVault (and switching to another, independent encryption tool for the data you want or need encrypted) is a viable option.\nAdvantages vs disadvantages with using file vault.\n", "Q: Cannot change region (locale) on MBP running OS X 10.9.2 I'm running OS X 10.9.2 on a MacBook Pro (Mid-2012) and cannot change its region (locale) via System Preferences -> Language & Region:\nChanging it ostensibly works, but revisiting the preferences pane later shows the region reverted to its previous value.\nIn terms of what tools and apps report, the story is inconsistent:\n\n\n*\n\n*defaults read -g AppleLocale does show the NEW locale\n\n*locale, by contrast, shows the PREVIOUS locale\n\n*Similarly, Calendar.app shows holidays from the PREVIOUS locale\n\n\nThus, for the most part, the system behaves as if the region changes was ineffective - which is at least consistent with the preferences pane reverting to the previous value.\nHere's what I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset the NVRAM\n\n*Repaired the disk with Disk Utility\n\n*Booted into single-user mode and ran fsck -yf\n\n*Cleared most caches with OnyX\n\n*Checked the syslog for telltale entries\n\n\nAll to no avail.\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nA: Is there maybe an AppleLocale key in ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/.GlobalPreferences.*.plist?

I couldn't figure out how to save and upload it either like you could on a PC.\n\nA: You cannot put an image in your signature on iOS. If you use Macmaniman's strategy of pasting in an image, the image will show up in settings, but not in an email. (tested on iOS 7)\nA workaround is to insert the company logo into each email as you are writing it. However, I don't see why you would want to do this.

It used to run Snow Leopard - Apple staff upgraded to SL before giving me the MBP). \nApple mentioned that Snow Leopard normally ran AHT from the second CD, but I do not have that nor do I have a backup. I tried all options like command-D and D and even alt-D (they talk about these here as well), but none worked so I decided to go this path.\nNow when I restart and press D I see a brief flicker and then my Macbook Pro turns off. Fortunately it still runs, but I want this to work of course. Why is this happening? Are these kinds of errors logged somewhere?\nThere are tools to access the EFI Bootloader and perform diagnostics, add partitions and so on using rEFIt as mentioned here on SO.

I don't know how it is on the Macs that don't have a Disc-Slot. Maybe Apple has added the Hardware Test to the Recovery Partition.\nKeep in Mind what do you do if the Check brings up a Failure? - And all the Time you maybe need to figure out what exactly is the Failure from a cryptic Error code!! - I highly recommend you ro bring your Mac to a local apple retail store so they can check it for you it will cost something but still less then the time you will be spending to do it yourself.\n", "Q: Sending a PDF to iBooks (iPad) How can I send a PDF to my iBooks in iPad without having to connect the iPad to my laptop using a cable?\nIs this possible at all?

The shell command is simply: defaults write /Users/Milo/Desktop/MyPlist \"My Key\" \"My Entry\". The issue that I'm having is that after running that command, it messes with the order of the plist file. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, except that I wrote an application that parses the plist, and it does so according to the order of the keys in the file. I don't want to change my app just to accommodate a seemingly random ordered plist that gets returned after I run the command. How can I make the command not reorder my plist?\n\nA: The order of key value pairs within a Property List, plist, dictionary structure is not specified and can not be relied upon.\nIdeally, your application needs to parse the property list without relying on the order of the dictionary pairs.\nIf the order is critical to your application, consider changing the property list structure to an array of dictionaries; where each dictionary contains a single key value pair.\nIf you can not change your application, and the property list is formatted as XML, then you may want to investigate other command line XML manipulation tools.\n", "Q: OSX Mavericks doesn't reboot/shutdown/logout from menubar sudo reboot or sudo halt works when executed from terminal.

The messages are end-to-end encrypted for each receiving device.\nIn other words: Your new device can't decrypt the old messages, as the original sender didn't know about this new device.  \nSee this article:\n\nYou’ve actually got one set of keys for each device you add to iCloud,\n  and each iMessage is encrypted independently for each device.

In the past 7 days I have updated to Xcode 5.1 seven times! \nYesterday I dragged Xcode to the trash and emptied the trash in an attempt to make it stick, this morning I got a popup saying that Xcode had been auto updated (should it even do that?) EDIT it is a preference setting!) but there is still an update showing Xcode 5.1 as being available. \nI have now dragged Xcode to the trash, emptied the trash, rebooted and fixed permissions. Noting the previous thread about repeated updates I have enabled the App store debug menu and cleared cookies and reset the application. In desperation I even shutdown my NAS which has the old version of Xcode on it (I invoke Time Machine manually)\nI am trying to resolve an issue with my ISP and this is not helping. Before I install Xcode for the 8th time, is there anything else I can do to convince the App store that it has indeed updated Xcode?\nEDIT: Despite the above preparations, I updated Xcode just now and another update is already showing as being available!\nEDIT: I may have solved the problem. Another application needed updating and then also exhibited the repeated download issue. Reading around I discovered comments about Spotlight and App Store issues. The Spotlight fixes didn't seem to do anything for me but I read a comment that deleting some dubious looking files in \"/Library/Application Support/App Store\" seemed to do the trick. I moved these 3 files to a temporary directory and rebooted. At last! The problem seems to have been fixed. 2 of the files were recreated, the 3rd (utd.plist) wasn't. I will leave it for a few days before declaring success.\n\nA: I was having the same problem with the Xcode 6.0.1 update continually showing up in the App Store. I applied the same update several times during my troubleshooting, even though during the process I kept deleting Xcode from my hard drive, I have no need for it any more. I didn't have more than one copy of Xcode on my drive, one possible reason for this issue.\nI just solved my problem. I had disabled Spotlight indexing a while back, on the advice of a web page I had seen, because it was using too much CPU and I didn't believe I really needed it. What I didn't know was that the App Store depends on the Spotlight indexes to determine whether you have an app installed; it was looking at a stale index.\nI just re-enabled indexing (\"sudo mdutil -i on /\"), and as soon as Spotlight actually started re-indexing, the App Store decided I didn't have any updates to be applied for Xcode.\n\nA: I would uncheck \"Download newly available updates in the background\" in System Preferences > App Store and not click the update button or whatever you are seeing in the App Store.\nThis isn't really a full fix, but will at least might help you with your ISP for the time being. \n\nA: Install Mavericks again via the AppStore, it won't touch your personal files. It seems like something in your system is wrong pushing you all updates all over and over again.\n", "Q: Can I sort Spotlight results by most-recently-used? Like everyone else, I use spotlight to open up OSX apps.  But I also like to use it to open up a particular log file, or a specific remote desktop connection.  \nWhen I search for the osx app, it is usually sorted to the top of the list so I can just type the return key to run it.  However, for the log file and the remote connection, they are WAY down the list, so I have to use the mouse to click them.  (I know, I am lazy)...\nI used to use Launchy when I was on windows, and it would sort my most recently used items or most frequently used items to be at the top, so it was nice and convenient.  Is there any way to duplicate this functionality?\n\nA: I do that in Finder Search window with custom settings.\nIt looks like this\nI save that search in the finder side bar, so now just click it and it shows me the results.\n\n\nA: I'd check out LaunchBar. I'm not certain it will do exactly what you are looking for, but unlike Spotlight, it doesn't keep any class of result at the top. \nAside: I bought version 2 back when I first got OSX 10.0 (if I'm remembering correctly... the developer was originally a NeXT shop) and have bought updates a few times (It is currently on version 5.) It has definitely been worth it.\n\nThere are also a couple of free options that I've dabbled with, but I always went back to Launch Bar:\n\nAlfred - (free, but they charge for certain actions you may or may not want)\nQuicksilver - (Donationware)\nAlso: it might be possible to get Spotlight to do what you want. I'll leave that for other answerers since I don't know.\n\nA: What you ask was the default behaviour of Spotlight, at least until Mojave, in my experience.\nOnce I updated to a more \"modern\" macOS version, Spotlight stopped sorting results altogether.\nWorkaround\nIt doesn't give total control and the actual \"Last Used hits\" behaviour,\nbut you can add a (whatever) tag to the desired files.\nThis makes Spotlight increase the priority of the file and bumps it up.\n(usually; until Apple doesn't come with a regression on that either)\n", "Q: Unable to create iCloud-Backup i wanted to create an icloud backup for my iphone.\nafter i started i lost my wifi connection because i left my house.\nafter i came back i found out, that the backup failed.\nsince then i was not able to create another backup.\nin one forum i found the answer, to delete all my previous updates. thats why there is written \"last backup: never\".\nwhen i start my backup, it starts loading first but then stops again.\n\nwhat can i do to make it work again?\ndoes this problem even come from the failed connection?\n\nA: The first step I would try after doing what you have done already would be to turn off iCloud backups and restart the phone before turning it back on again.\nIf that doesn't work, I would try to initiate the backup from iTunes using the Back Up Now button.

When I charge it, it heats up even more and battery drains very quickly. Its battery is currently fully drained for more than half an hour and the back still seems as it is heated. What's the problem and how can I solve it?\n\nA: Are you using IOS 7? When using IOS 7 be sure to check your apps which are running in the background, but normally these apps are also closed after some time in standby. Be sure to update your iPhone to IOS 7.1. When you say your iPhone/battery heats up when loading there is surely something wrong with your battery. Your USB transformer might heat up a little, but never had an iPhone heating up when charging. Contact Apple Support, or your reseller. Probably your battery needs replacement.\n\nA: It seem that you battery has reach its limits needs a replacement. You can check to see if there are apps causing your battery to drain quickly.

I want to require a password after 15 minutes of sleep or inactivity, which should be straightforward. However, I am getting some strange behavior. \nA- With the Require Password <option> hours after sleep or screen saver begins option in the \"Security and Privacy\" preference pane unchecked, my machine does not ask for a password if I close and immediately open the lid.\nB- With the \"Require Password <option> hours after sleep or screen saver begins\" option in the \"Security and Privacy\" preference pane checked and the timeout set to 15 minutes, my machine requires a password if I close and immediately open the lid.\nI want to be able to wake from sleep without a password if it has been less than 15 minutes since I last used my mac. This should be simple, but for some reason the appropriate setting isn't having the desired effect. Any ideas on how to fix this so the setting works as it should?\n\nA: I have tried to replicate and analyze your problem.\nThe key word here is close the lid and \"immediately\" open it again.\nThere is a file called com.apple.screensaver.plist located in your user library preferences folder that should change when you change the settings for password timer. \nWhile observing it there is actually a slight delay in writing that file, since a temporary version is written first. If you do the immediate stuff it is possible the .plist file is not correctly completed so your 15 min delay is not working.\nIn your case I would take a wild ques that plist file does not change the settings to 15 minutes and it is stuck to the \"Immediately\" request password.\nThat can also be caused the corrupt ACL permissions, or the immediately action you are doing.\nMake sure the plist file has the accurate date/Time stamp before attempting to close the lid.\nTo test log in as another user and try again. If it works with other user reset your ACL.\n\nA: According to Apple documentation, \"Upon waking, a user login password must be entered before the Mac can be used.\" If we take that at face value, being able to not enter a password after the system has slept, e.g., you've closed the lid, presents a security vulnerability.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/PH14125\n", "Q: Is multi desktop more resource expensive?

After a quick search I knew I wanted to uninstall it and found this: http://www.thesafemac.com/arg-genieo/. (This guide is actually recommended in another question on this site.) I followed the steps, but made two blunders. I rm-ed the files listed in the guide, thereby skipping the recycle bin (I'm not sure what the English name is). After I finished the list I wanted to make a back-up (second blunder: I should have done that before I tried to uninstall Genieo, my last backup is 76 days old) but noticed that the program needed to unlock my drive didn't open, like all other apps that weren't opened yet. At this point, I wished I had the files still in the recycle bin so I could place them back. Fortunately, I already opened Terminal (I have it still open) (so I can still use command line utilities) and Safari (enabling me to type this question). Safari just crashed. Because I can't launch apps, I assume my computer won't reboot. Please save my iMac.\nBy the way, I don't notice any obvious traces of Genieo still being present. At least that worked.\nI would be happy already if I could just make a backup (but my drive is lockable and I need to launch an app to unlock it, so I can't access my external hard drive) and after that boot from a CD and restoring the old backup or restore from Time Machine (the old backup), in both cases I would have access to my latest files and I could place them back one by one (as restoring the whole snapshot would break the system again).\nUPDATE\nI had an idea how to fix this: boot from disk, make backup, clean install. Now I just need help with the first and last step (never needed to do that). There is one problem though: my iMac is very old; it came with Tiger, but I upgraded to Snow Leopard with a Mac Box Set. My question now is if I can boot from the CD in the Mac Box Set. The accompanying manual says nothing about this.\n\nA: Turns out I couldn't access my disk when booting from disc (I apologise to all dyslectics reading this). I discovered, though, that since my last backup (which was 79 days before the crash) I had actually only used the computer very little, so I used a single USB stick to back up all files that were created or edited since then. (These files are fairly easy to find by sorting on last edited date in Finder. Luckily, I had still access to Finder.)\nBooting from the disc in the Mac Box Set is indeed possible, I asked at the local Apple Reseller and did it myself. It was very easy (<3 Apple). I just had to press C during startup, see http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1533 for the official list of startup key combinations. (That is where I found the information.)

Those symlinks are not working, when sharing the folder. Also, when using ZFS, I can only share a whole pool, but if a filesystem is on top of the pool, it disappears.\nFor example: \nzpool create tank /dev/disk1 dev/disk2 #(merging Movies for example)\nzfs create /tank/MoviesA\nzfs create /tank/MoviesB\n\nSharing /tank results in an empty folder, even if MoviesA and MoviesB are filled with Movies.\nI also tried to simply share the hidden folder /Volumes but as you can guess, it does not work. I know this does not work and has its reasons, but I tried it to see what is possible.\nSo the main idea should be clear: creating a network share that contains all drives, but keeps them independent from each other.\nI could share a whole zpool, but if a disk fails, it gets lost. Also i could use something like mhddfs but in that case I have no control over the place where a file is stored.\nIn an ideal situation I would have one big network share called \"Server\"\nwhich contains all my hard drives by their names, and lets me browse and move stuff from one to another. Simply as said above when I tried to share the folder \"Volumes\".\nI hope there is anybody out there who can help me out with this. There has to be a simple solution...anything virtual. \nWhat obviously is working:\nTransmit -- Mount the SSH connection under /Volumes\nTransmit then creates a Virtual Drive, but this is not shareable via SMB or AFP and does not show the correct size.\nWhat I have not tried yet: \n- play around with NFS\n- OSXFuse and SSH (probably the same as Transmit does)\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\nI do know that there are other options. I also thought about Spans, JBODs, RAIDz, RAID1 Mirror sets in ZFS Setups...\nSome Info on the available HDDs: 2x4 TB, 3x2 TB, 1x1 TB and a 640 GB Disk.\nIf you have any other idea, please share. I am simply trying to have everything in a nutshell, but not like a JBOD so if one drive fails everything gets lost. And I don't need a RAID because the data is not that important and is going to be backed up on the 2x4 TB or the other way around.\n\nA: There are two ways to do this. I've my combining both solutions I've found that I've been able to maximize both resiliency and flexibility.\n1 - Server Side.\nUse OSXFuse (https://osxfuse.github.io/) and  mhddfs, the latter of which you can install via MacPorts, to create a large drive pool. Then share that. (A wrinkle here here is that mhddfs runs in user space, typically after login, so file-sharing may need to be restarted after mhddfs fires. I'm still trying to work out that kink. If you figure anything out, please do share.)\nKnow that you can then also share the drives independently. Use the DrivePool share for reading, and the individual shares for writing (so that you have more control over where the files go).\n2 - Client Side.\nUse auto_mounter and mount all the drives individually on the client, but in the same folder. Although they are individually mounted, auto_mounter is smart enough that after a short sping-up-and-connect delay they basically act as a large, laggy folder on the client machine. This solution is suprisingly robust.\nThe settings will be a combination of two client-side manifest files, (1) /ect/auto_master, and (2) conventionally at /etc/auto_resources. The best tutorial for this is here - http://useyourloaf.com/blog/2011/01/24/using-the-mac-os-x-automounter.html. It's old, but the instructions still work perfectly on my machine using 10.9.5 on the client and server.\n3 - Combine both solutions!\nI have my mhddfs master drive pool on my client at /mnt/DrivePool, and the individual drives at /mnt/IndividualDrives/D01 through /mnt/IndividualDrives/D10. It looks a little clunky at first, but it is actually quite robust and flexible for my needs.\n\nA: I've just realized you can use UnionFS on OSX, via fstab or automount. This might be what you are looking for. It's like mhddfs without the balancing. \n\nA: For anyone getting into similar trouble :\nI went for ZFS and created a Software RAIDZ.\nI extended my Server to 5x2TB Data and 1x3TB Backup[1] + 3x2TB Backup[2]\nSo I got a total of 8TB in a raid, 3TB as a Backup Drive and 3x2TB as Individual hard drives containing a Full Backup of a Section.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 13\" 2011 not booting -- question mark folder My MacBook Pro is not booting.

For me, I have not seen issues of this sort, thankfully.\nBut what I have noticed (and which I am having trouble finding others who have noticed it) is an aggravating subtle change to the behavior of scroll. Before, in 10.8, the two finger scroll on the touchpad controlled the scrollable buffer in a one-to-one fashion. Now, for very low finger motion velocities, the scrolling motion is accelerated.\nThis means the page will scroll much faster (something like 5 to 20 pixels per second) even when I am barely moving my two fingers at all.\nIn addition to this, this acceleration appears to have a rubber-band effect, where for slightly faster finger velocities, it actually slows down the motion of the buffer. It's almost like Apple is imposing on me some sort of \"optimal scroll rate\" and correcting me even though I know damn well how fast I want to move through the page to match my skimming speed, thank you very much.\nAnd then, there is a separate higher-velocity regime where if finger velocity exceeds some much higher threshold the rubber-band adjustment is taken away. This feels good and proper and the momentum scrolling works just great.   \nI have become a bit of a speed reader/skimmer over the years and my rate of about half a page a second is just at this threshold, between the top range of the aggravating rubber-band-slowing regime and the \"free-spinning\" proportional control regime.\nSo, basically... I don't like this. I want it to feel like my fingers are directly dragging the scrolling buffer. I don't want \"help\". The non-physical \"help\" breaks the proportional physics of control, and it basically feels like they took a perfectly tuned rolling tube that I was using to view my documents on and squirted a magic rubber banding lubricant that defies physics into the bearing. \nNote: It's possible that I am experiencing some side effect due to not installing the new OS fresh and instead updating a rather heavily \"broken in\" 10.8 setup. I've got BetterTouchTool and other widgets of this sort that took the ride over that might possibly be interfering and generating this strange behavior. \nSo anyway. The actual question is.... try scrolling a page in Mavericks at this rate of speed. Maybe try to do a comparison with a Mac that's running 10.7 or 10.8. See if you can spot this difference. If not, please tell me I'm crazy and maybe that means I can get this changed back to the way it should be.\n\nA: I arrived at this page because I also perceived a subtle change in the trackpad scrolling mechanics after upgrading to Mavericks.  It does indeed feel that medium-speed scrolling is slowed down a bit from before (10.7 in my case).  I don't have a machine running the older OS to test this on, though.  \nAnyway, I turned up the scrolling speed to max in System Preferences > Accessibility > Mouse & Trackpad and find the new mechanics tolerable on that setting.  This is maybe not the solution you are looking for but perhaps other readers will be content as I am with this fix.\n", "Q: How can I import my contacts and data from Basecamp to Proofhub? I've been using Basecamp as a project management tool since 2010.\nIt has a good interface and organisation of data, but sometimes you might not be willing to share the secrecy of a project with the clients.

I then wanted to connect remotely from my Macbook Air in bed, and so accessed the VM via Microsoft's OSX remote desktop client.  I'm able to successfully connect to the Ubuntu guest VM, however my Macbook Air's arrow keys output numbers when pressed making it impossible to navigate with them (a big problem for coding).\nAdditionally, the touchpad is hyper-sensitive when using two fingers to scroll on the page.\nI found a random forum post suggesting to turn off Numlock on the Windows host machine which I did, however nothing changed (even after rebooting the VM and reconnecting).\nHow can I fix the arrow keys so they function as arrow keys?\n\nA: The problem is that the NumLock state gets stuck to On inside the RDP client. Tools like numlockx don't help - the client returns the state back to On. It's not just the allow keys that stop working - Ins, Del, Home, End, PgUp and PgDown are affected as well. The solution I found is to remove all references to keypad keys affected by NumLock from the xmodmap settings. To do that, run on the guest\nxmodmap -pke | sed 's/KP_\\([^ ]*\\) KP_.*/\\1/' > $HOME/.xmodmap\n\n.xmodmap will be loaded on the next login. To load it immediately, run\nxmodmap $HOME/.xmodmap\n\nAlternatively, use the newer version of the RDP client (Microsoft Remote Desktop 10). It fixes the arrows. It's a full rewrite of Microsoft Remote Desktop, it has its own issues with the Insert key and middle mouse button.\n", "Q: Which program installs *osxfuse* files in / (root folder)? $ ls -al /*fuse*\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   25400 Dec 17  2011 /libmacfuse_i32.2.dylib\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   25400 Dec 17  2011 /libmacfuse_i64.2.dylib\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  388048 Dec 17  2011 /libosxfuse_i32.2.dylib\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel     990 Dec 17  2011 /libosxfuse_i32.la\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  388080 Dec 17  2011 /libosxfuse_i64.2.dylib\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel     990 Dec 17  2011 /libosxfuse_i64.la\n-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel     332 Dec 17  2011 /osxfuse.pc\n\nIs it ok to delete them?\n\nA: After some investigation, the *macfuse* files were mv'ed to root folder by a mis-configured bash script.\nThe script was supposed to move the *macfuse* files to somewhere else and ln from /usr/local/lib/*.macfuse*, to kill some homebrew warning.

A few minutes ago, after unlocking my phone (iPhone 4, iOS 7.0.1) I got a dialog over the home screen:\n\nPasscode Requirement\nYou must change your passcode within 60 minutes\n\nand it offered to let me do so.

Is there a definitive answer?\n\nA: I had this problem tonight too.  I \"bit\" before I thought it being malware, but it doesn't seem to have been malware.  I changed my PIN and the phone reset, then the new PIN worked.  BUT...  the phone immediately asked for me to change the PIN again... now I was thinking Malware.  I kept changing the PIN and it kept asking me to do it again.  I used the tip earlier in this thread about too simple of a PIN and tried a 9 digit PIN and that worked, the message didn't return.  Funny thing is that after, I was able to go into settings and set the PIN back to the 4 digit PIN that I had originally, no further messages.... yet.\n\nA: This message is the case when either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your device is enrolled under MDM and after deployment it will display something like image below.(https://www.apple.com/iphone/business/it/management.html)\n\n*Your passcode is too obvious and needs to be changed\n\n*Microsoft Exchange can force a passcode on your iPhone.\n\n\n\nObvious codes start with the following numbers: \n\n\n*\n\n*196* \n\n*197*\n\n*198* \n\n*199*\n\n*200*\n\n*201*\n\n\nBut also include:\n\n\n*\n\n*1234\n\n*0000 (or any 4 same number combination)\n\n*0001 or 0010 or 0100 or 1000 (or any number with this pattern)\n\n*1379\n\n*2580\n\n*2468\n\n\nA: Go to Settings app > General > Profiles\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete any configuration profile that you don't want to keep, then delete any that control passcode.\n\n*If Profiles is not near the end of the list (below VPN and above Reset >) then you may have no profiles and can continue to the next step.\n\n\nNext, go to Settings app -> Passcode\n\n\n*\n\n*enter your passcode, turn passcode off, then set it up again\n\n\nLastly, Exchange servers can institute a passcode requirement, so you might disable any Exchange mail accounts - temporarily removing them from the device to see if the Exchange server was sending the message or setting any requirements. I don't know if this sets a profile or not, but will edit things if I can find a reference to how this works in practice.\nYou can choose your same pin again, but the OS will likely want to keep reminding you that a change is required until you clear the \"warning\". Enough people have reported that just \"changing\" the passcode doesn't work that something must be up.\nIf you have jailbroken the device, I might consider rolling back to a stock iOS for a bit and choosing an entirely more complicated passphrase for a while just in case it is some phishing attempt. Just because this is considered to be very unlikely doesn't make it impossible.\n", "Q: Why is permission denied on this folder?

The DisplayPort monitor is fast, while the two USB to DVI converter monitors are much slower but sufficient for email and web browsing tasks.\n\nA: Amazon has used options that are a little less for the DualHead2Go Digital ME and some other Matrox devices that might work (though all of those are in the $200 range). \nThere is also the Belkin Thunderbolt Express Dock which has two thunderbolt ports along with misc other ports for $149\nIt looks like Thunderbolt splitting is relatively expensive. \n\nA: The three options that come to mind here that don't have significant costs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Purchase a USB-to-[your monitor connection type] converter; while it won't work as well as the direct Thunderbolt connection, you will now have different connections to your machine for each of your monitors, and be unable to mix them up.\n\n*Label your Thunderbolt adapters. (Front/Back, for example)\n\n*Tape the plastic portions of your Thunderbolt connectors together, with a piece of foam or plastic in between to maintain distance between the two connectors, rigging the two Thunderbolt adapters to be (functionally) a single connector.\nPersonally, a dock is probably your best bet; though expensive, they would take care of this quickly.

You can limit it to just the battery info by tweaking the command as follows:\n$ system_profiler SPPowerDataType | grep -i \"charge information\" -A 10\n\nResults:\nCharge Information:\n          Charge Remaining (mAh): 3433\n          Fully Charged: Yes\n          Charging: No\n          Full Charge Capacity (mAh): 3517\n      Health Information:\n          Cycle Count: 941\n          Condition: Service Battery\n      Battery Installed: Yes\n      Amperage (mA): 0\n      Voltage (mV): 12343\n\nHere we can see that the battery is in need of service. (Coincidentally, I have a MBP with the exact same symptoms you have, so the output here works perfectly!)  The key here is that under \"Amperage\" we get a \"0\" which means there is literally no current coming from the battery (Note: even though it may have voltage, if there are no amps, it won't have the \"power\" to supply).\nIf we unplug the power adapter, the battery has nothing to supply so the computer shuts off.\nThe Fix\nYou just need a new replacement battery battery (I suggest getting ones with at minimum a 12 month warranty; 18 month is better).  From personal experience, the more \"warranted\" batteries lasted much longer.  Definitely  avoid the ones with less than a 12 month warranty no matter how inexpensive they are.\n\nTo replace the battery; it's actually very simple.  Just remove the screws holding the back cover in place.\n\nThen, just remove the screws holding in the battery and swap.  Just be careful when disconnecting the battery from the logic board. Don't yank it off, use a spudger or similar tool to disconnect the molex connector by \"wedging\" it off.\n\nReverse the procedure to reassemble.  Make sure you note where each screw comes from as they are different.\nThat's it.  Your MBA will now be able to hold a charge like it did when new.\n\nA: Your battery gets not charged properly. This can mean different things. Start inspecting all the different components involved.\nTry resetting SMC first and only after a SMC reset did not solve your problem you should think about replacing your battery. \nThe other two answers already explain everything you need to know about each of those steps very well.\nBut you should also check all the components and connections your current passes through: power adapter, MagSafe connection pins, MagSafe connection at your laptop. If, for example your MagSafe connection is not stable, your SMC could get into trouble: are all the pins ok or is one stuck? This happened to a MacBook Pro we have and as a result we had to buy new Batteries continuously until we found out, that the pins apparently did not have a stable connection. A screwed up SMC could be at the cause of all your troubles and in that case the question is: why did it screw up?\nIn our case the MBP stopped holding charge and did not charge. A SMC reset + MagSafe cleaning helped in our case, but we will probably have to buy a new power adapter.\nWhen your MagSafe connection works you should get proper feedback from the LED.\n\n\n*\n\n*check all the connections, what is the condition of your battery? Is it starting to increase its volume? Do you have a stable power connection at power outlet or at the MagSafe?\n\n*do a SMC reset.\n\n*try to charge after SMC reset\n\n*does it charge? What does the MagSafe LED say: green, orange, off?\n\n*in case SMC reset does not solve your problem you should consider a more thoroughly inspection of your battery.\n\n\nFrom experience I can say that a screwed up SMC can put excessive stress on a battery and destroy it in a very short time.\n", "Q: Is \"flash storage\" the same \"SSD\"? I'm looking to see if the two are interchangeable and if not what the differences are. \nIf the two in fact have a difference, perhaps adding devices or cases where each are normally used over the other.\n\nA: Credit for this answer goes to https://danielmiessler.com\nShort Answer\nLet's clear up the definitions:\n\nSolid State Drive = a hard drive that has no moving parts\nFlash memory = a method of permanently storing information without\nconstant power being applied\n\nTherefore, the answer to your question is No; Flash Memory is not the same thing as a Solid State Drive.\nFlash memory is one implementation of an SSD. You can also create an SSD out of RAM; if you implement an SSD using RAM, you'll lose data when you turn off the power to the SSD.\nLong Answer\nSDD (Spinning Disc Drive) - a.k.a HDD (Hard Disc Drive)\n\n*\n\n*It is important to know the difference between a Spinning Disc Drive (SDD) and a Solid State Drive (SSD) to answer this question\n\n*What is a Spinning Disc Drive?\n\n*Spinning Disc Drives have moving parts\n\n*Spinning Disc Drives are being phased out in favor of Solid State Drives (at least in consumer applications)\n\nSSD (Solid State Drive)\n\n*\n\n*SSD simply means \"a hard drive without moving parts\"\n\n*The Solid State Drive was developed to improve upon Spinning Disc Drives (moving parts are not that reliable and slow to read from memory)\n\n*The SSD has been around for decades (contrary to popular belief)\n\n*Recently, the technology has gotten better, so you see them in all newer comptuers\n\nRAM (Random Access Memory)\n\n*\n\n*SSD's were originally achieved by using RAM as the method to store data\n\n*RAM requires continuous power to be applied to retain data\n\n*By using RAM, the hard drive no longer had moving parts\n\n*The major downside of using RAM: you can never turn your hard drive off or else you lose all your data.\n\n*Historically, RAM was/is  used in conjunction with a Spinning Disc Drive or a Solid State Drive (since RAM cannot retain data once powered off)\n\n*The upside of using RAM: RAM is super fast - faster than SSD's and flash memory\n\nFlash Storage\n\n*\n\n*Flash storage is also relatively old technology, but started as a way\nto permanently store information without power being continuously applied (in contrast to RAM)\n\n*Flash storage has traditionally had significant aging issues\n\n*Basically you could only write to the memory a certain number of\ntimes before you would lose that section of the drive, and\nperformance would generally get worse over time as well.\n\n*As Flash storage improved (in the\nlate 2000’s), manufacturers started making SSDs out of Flash memory\ninstead of out of RAM.\n\n*Modern SSD hard drives are Flash-based, so today, there’s not really a\ndifference between SSD's and Flash memory.\n\n*As stated above, SSD's are simply disks that have no moving parts, and Flash is the implementation that allows that to happen\n\n*USB thumb drives have used Flash storage for a long time as well, but\nthe quality of the Flash storage in USB's is typically much lower\nthan the Flash memory used in SSD's. This means much worse\nperformance for USB's than SSD's (but I believe current USB technology is improving to close the gap)\n\nSUMMARY\n\n*\n\n*SSD just means a hard disk that doesn’t have moving parts; Flash is a type of\nmemory that is very fast and doesn’t require continuous power\n(non-volatile)\n\n*SSDs used to use RAM, but now use Flash instead. In short, you\nshouldn’t compare Flash to SSD just as you shouldn’t compare\nbatteries to lithium-ion. In both cases the latter is a type of the\nformer.\n\n\nA: An SSD has flash storage inside but SSD is a special form factor, in most cases meaning that it is designed to fit in places that a normal 2.5\" HDD would be installed. Flash comes in a huge range of formats from tiny cards for phones and cameras and in Macs it can be an SSD, mSATA, and PCIe form factors.\nSo if you have a flash device in the shape of a 2.5\" drive it is an SSD. MacBook Airs, Retinas, new iMacs, and  the new Mac Pro all use PCIe form factors giving even better performance.\n\nA: Yes and no.\nFlash storage is storage that uses electronically programmable and erasable memory modules with no moving parts. It refers to a very specific implementation of data storage. It can come in different packages though: wrapped in a hard, plastic envelope you slide in to your camera; mounted to a PCB stick with exposed connectors and docked inside your MacPro; or mounted inside a drive enclosure that's slid in to an existing drive bay.\nSSD, or Solid State Drive, refers to an enclosed storage device that's meant to act as a disk for a computer, but is lean on details about what's inside the enclosure and being used to store the data.\nTechnically, \"solid state\" just refers to \"electronics with no moving parts\". So a \"solid state drive\" that used ferromagnetic fluids to store data is still an SSD.\nAnd indeed, SSDs have been around for a long time with a variety of different solid state storage mediums inside of them to keep those 1's and 0's persistent. However, in this day and age, at the time I'm writing this, SSDs are generally filled with (you guessed it): flash-type memory modules. Though flash-based SSDs generally carry the property that their enclosure is built to mirror that of a typical 2.5\" spinning drive disk enclosure with an SATA interface so that it can act as a drop-in replacement for a mechanical disk.\n", "Q: iPhoto update seems to be 2G and two attempts to run it failed. It used half my monthly data My iMac is only a few weeks old.  Just after i bought it, it started to automatically run an update for iPhoto.  This went on for several hours and used 2G of data but the update failed.  It tried again with the same result.  I rang Apple and was talked through the process of selecting when I wanted to update and was told that option would show me how big the update file was.  (it doesn't  until it starts to download).  My monthly data of 8G has always been more than I needed, however because of this update failure I used half of it in one day.  Any suggestions on how I can update or why it is failing?  Thanks.\n\nA: No suggestions as to why it is failing, but I have a suggestion re the update.\nDon't. \nNo update to iPhoto is going to be urgent. Leave it until it is convenient to take the iMac to somewhere with fast internet access, then hit \"Software Update\" and let it run its hardest.\n", "Q: Can an iPhone be force started before the 15 minute recharge period? There are times when the iPhone is at low battery level that it turns itself off.\nSometimes, it maybe when I am going to charge it but looking for where my cable is, it turned itself off.\nSo I wonder, if I missed it by 20 seconds, how come sometimes I had to wait 15 minutes or even 18 minutes of recharging before I can start up the iPhone again, say, just to look at my email to see what flight number it is.\nSo if I had plugged in 20 seconds earlier, I might be able to use it continuously, for as long as I want, vs now I have to wait 15 minutes.  It is no issue if I am at home, but it matters more if I am at the airport trying to look up some info or to find a hotel due to flight cancelation due to weather.\nSo is there a way to charge it for 3 or 5 minutes, and force start the iPhone instead?\n\nA: Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a way. As far as I know it charges to around 4-5% of battery capacity so that it's sure to be able to perform the whole boot process, even if it's unplugged, so not to screw something up when losing power while starting up the OS.\n15-18 minutes seems long to me, though. It's usually 5-7 minutes using the iPhone charger.\nAre you charging off a PC USB port? \n\nA: It tends to be that the built in car phone chargers aren't phone chargers, and are meant for getting music of USB flash drives and MP3 players. If you want to charge your phone in your car. I would recommend either plug your charger brick into a 12 to (your standard house voltage) adapter. Or get a car lightning charger that plugs into the cigarette outlet. That would bring your 15 minutes down to about 5.\n\nA: Yes, if you know what you are doing. plug into charger, unplug battery from logic board. when apple comes on screen plug battery back in. Jump start.\n\nA: In short, no. There is no way to force it to restart when you are charing from \"0%\". In fact it is even posible when recharging and your phone is still alive, and you are continuing to use it, even then is it possible the iPhone shutsdown. \nThis is an build-in security, your iPhone shutsdown when it's almost empty just because before shutting down it still needs some time to do some jobs. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*It must inform your carrier that you're not available anymore\n\n*Must shut down apps\n\n*Must be sure that everything is saved so there is no data loss.\n\n\nThe reason why it takes 15 minutes to restart:\nIt makes sure that it has enough batery power to execute this tasks, or even better has enough power to feed your (heavy) requests when it's on again. As said before it's possible that even when you're ontime to recharge your phone, it still shuts off because of too low power and prevent data loss.\nBelieve me, it's build-in to help you, not to plague you.\n\nA: I know this might seemed a bit crazy & wild to suggest but I hope it might help but honestly there's one particular time I was so mad that my phone won't turn on even though I've charged it for hours and still wouldn't turn on, I smacked my iPhone on the wall and floor but not too hard just an average a few times because I get so mad but I also don't want to damage the iPhone. My phone eventually turns on.\n", "Q: How to turn an MBA on when the power button is not functioning? My MBA power button is not functioning (on or off). I would like to know how to turn it on, in case the MBA is accidentally shut down. I have seen the technician do something inside but it's not open knowledge. Can anyone share their technical experience pls. I am confident I can, given specific steps. Thanks!\n\nA: Since you think it is a permanet damage the best option is to replace the keyboard.\nIf you are not sure it is a permanent damage and before you replace the keyboard consider this:\nThere is a tiny spring loaded contact under the key cap.\nSometimes (rarely) a food or dirt get stuck in there.\n1- Use a air can and blow around it, hoping to blow out the dirt.\nor\n2- Use a Alcohol (with Computer in OFF mode) soak it, wait for 10-20 minutes.\nUse Hair blower and warm it up to evaporate the alcohol (not to hot)\nor\n3- Buy new and replace the keyboard, it is not a walk in the park but doable. It might cost you aprox $60 for keyboard, and you will need a special screwdriver. Estimated TTC about 2 hours.\n\nA: You can take a look at this video but be sure it's the same model!\n", "Q: How to download a game twice with an apple ID? Could you pls inform me How I could download a game twice with my apple ID on my Iphone, since I deleted it by mistake and now I can not download it.\n\nA: Anything you buy on the App Store is able to be downloaded again as many times as you like, it's not like it used to be on iTunes where you downloaded it once, and then couldn't do it again if you lost the file.\nTo do this, just go back to the app store, and search for the app in question.  Instead of listing a price, or saying FREE etc, you should have a little icon showing a cloud and an arrow which you can tap to redownload.  Note, you can only download the latest version of the App, so it it has been updated since you last used it, then you cannot go back to an older version (unless you have a local backup of the file on your iTunes machine).  Also, you must be logged into the store using the same Apple ID that was used to make the original purchase.\nThe only way I know of that you cannot use this method, is if the app is no longer available on the App Store, in which case you can still get it, but you need to go through your purchase history to get to the download link instead of getting it from searching the store.\n\nA: Instead of searching for the app, you could open the Purchased list and download it from there.\n\nA: You can reinstall purchased apps (and free apps just the same) using the App Store app.\n\n\n*\n\n*On your device, navigate to the App Store Select the right-most\ntab, Updates \n\n*At the top of this view is an area labeled\nPurchases.

There is a use case.\nWhen a user wants to play an encrypted file, the encrypted file will pop up a dialog box to request the user to enter a Playback Password. This dialog box will display the machine ID of the user's apple device. The user can send his/her own machine ID to you, and you can create a Playback Password based on the user's machine ID. After that the user can use this Playback Password to play your file on his/her device. Since the Playback Password is created based on the user's machine ID, the user will not be able to share the Playback Password with other users. Since the Playback Password is bond to the user's device, the user will not be able to re-distribute your files.\nIs there some software that helps me to obtain this purpose?\n\nI seem to have secured the streaming video from the web site well enough, but a lot of the members want video files because they don't want to have to deal with wi-fi to play the video while they conduct the class. \n\nThere is no doubt someone can just shoot the video from the screen, but I want to slow down the proliferation of my video.\n\nA: The software you are looking for is called \"Digital Rights Management\" software, often abbreviated to \"DRM\".\nSearching for this term will find a wide range of third party tools and solutions for protecting your videos. The offerings will range from massive companies like Adobe with their Access solution to numerous smaller companies.\nProtecting Streamed/Online Content\nControlling access to a video file to be played on viewer's computer is a difficult problem. Your best option is to provide online only access to your video content. By serving the video content yourself, you can more easily control access.\nHave you considered using YouTube and their paid channel service?\nProtecting Local Content\nThere is currently no built-in DRM mechanism included with Mac OS X. Requiring a user to install a third party video codec is likely to limit your audience.\nHowever, Flash remains a popular plug-in and can be used to provide digital rights management. Flash works both in the web browser and for stand alone applications.\nSearching for flash protect local video returns software claiming to support multiple platforms, including Apple:\nProtect Software\n\nWe protect your software, video and content effectively against\nillegal copies and sharing.

Anyone can copy and redistribute to they liking, while doing so promoting your video.\nThere is no point for me listing the crack methods just to prove the point but easy to Google them.\n\nA: I like the answers given so far. People do crack videos - as Ruslan above notes. It's really really easy. Same for YouTube videos. Essentially, anything that shows on a computer screen can be captured. (Grab is built into OS/X; Videobox for example, downloads from YouTube sites - whether they are flash-based, HTML5 or QT). \nI don't know if that capability exists for mobile devices. But it's pretty straightforward to copy iOS files to your desktop computer.\nSo, it may help to focus the answer if people knew the potential audiences. Are your videos produced for a large company? (could result in a contractual arrangement), for private individuals? (numbered / licensed copies).\nWhat film companies sometimes do to protect pre-screen films (such as giving their work to oscar/tv reviewers), is to overprint portions of the film with licensing info, and sometimes, to remove color from small portions (a minute or so). \nI suppose that you could throw a lot of money at solutions, so I think it's important to understand your potential target groups. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: -1006F error message when trying to recover mac my macbook pro crashed and i sent it for repairs.. so the guy installed a new hard drive but then sent it back with a screen having a flashing folder with a question mark.. so i looked at this page and basically restarted by pressing the option button.

(See the section on supported protocols)\nWhen starting the computer, press Command+Option+R until you see a spinning globe appear along with a message about the recovery mode.\nThis will force your Mac to launch Internet Recovery. You'll know that you are in Internet Recovery when you see a spinning globe and a meter running underneath it. \n\nA: I'd like to add another answer to help anyone who may encounter this. My scenario was for during the Yosemite recovery, error was showing the internet globe icon and \"apple.com/support -2105F\" so slightly different error number.\nPrior to this, the recovery process was stuck for hours on \"Chunk download failed, retrying...\".

(e.g. the ones discussed here.)\nI see that in this article here on \"OS X Mavericks: Use global keyboard shortcuts\" that shortcuts are called \"global\" but in a different sense - it seems to me - because they are only available if the given application is already active (focused upon, on top, like for example a text editor in which I can write) but not if it is not in this position (for example: if the text editor is open and ready for writing, then, the shortcuts available for an audio player will not be accessible). \nSo, I am not referring to the media keys on the keyboard, but to ones that I can set in an application and then can use when other application is active and actively used.\nWhen adding some shortcuts for vlc under Keyboard settings, they are not global in this sense.\n\n\nA: You can assign a shortcut to a script like this:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"VLC\"\n    click menu item \"Step Forward\" of menu 1 of menu bar item \"Playback\" of menu bar 1\nend tell\n\nFor example save the script in ~/Library/Scripts/ in AppleScript Editor and then use FastScripts to give it a shortcut. Or if you have bought the Powerpack for Alfred, you can create a workflow with a Hotkey trigger connected to a Run Script action.\n", "Q: Is it possible to create shortcuts for VLC using Automator? I see here that Automator can be used to create commands that then can be triggered globally.\nI have no idea how to use Automator but see that it has some options for involving applications... Can a \"service\" be created for VLC that will then be bound to keystroke triggers?\nWhat I want are simple commands like pause/play, back and forward that could be used with shortcuts no matter what other window application is on top.\n\nA: You can create services like this:\n\nThen give the services shortcuts from System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services.\nI prefer using third party applications instead of services to assign shortcuts to scripts though. There has been a bug since 10.7 where the shortcuts for services don't always work until you hover over the services menu from the menu bar (or for example run a service once from the menu bar). There is also a noticeable delay before services are run, and the shortcuts for services don't work when an application that doesn't have a services menu (like Tower) is frontmost.\nMore examples:\ntell application \"VLC\"\n    if playing then\n        tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"VLC\"\n            click menu item \"Pause\" of menu 1 of menu bar item \"Playback\" of menu bar 1\n        end tell\n    else\n        play\n    end if\nend tell\n\ntell application \"VLC\"\n    set n to 60\n    if duration of current item - current time > n then\n        set current time to current time + n\n    else\n        next\n    end if\nend tell\n\ntell application \"VLC\"\n    set fullscreen mode to not fullscreen mode\nend tell\n\ntell application \"VLC\"\n    volumeUp\nend tell\n\nOpen VLC's dictionary in AppleScript Editor to see all supported terminology.\n", "Q: Is it possible to identify who deleted my shared folder? My Mac, in my workplace, can be accessed from other Mac systems (file sharing is enabled, and it has no password set).\nI've found out there are 2 folders were deleted (missing from my desktop). \nHow can I check who was connected to my system or who was access my desktop remotely, so that I can identify who deleted my folder?\n\nA: Regrettably Mac OS X does not log file access and changes by default. The user responsible for deleting the two folders is unlikely to be identifiable through your Mac's log files.\nThere are records kept of file changes in .fseventsd but these are at a block level, rather than the folder and file level.\nThird party file recovery tools may still be able to recover your two lost folders.\n", "Q: How to install imagick via homebrew?

How can I correct this issue?\n\nA: The process used to be opaque and therefore complicated, but Apple now has a self-service web app for small businesses to self-list:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://mapsconnect.apple.com/\nI've not had any issues with updating and creating listings and the email feedback you get is quite helpful if you run into any questions or snags.\nIf you fail to update your own listing directly with Apple, you can also try to get other data sources like Google Maps, Yelp, etc... correct in case Apple pulls data from other sources. I recommend making an Apple entry for your business rather than letting the system try to guess the correct information.\n\nA: Siri had our information wrong as well. \nI followed the link and altered the information but got an error message that claimed the automated process did not approve the changes and it asked me to fill out a form to be sent to a human.\nI have not heard back. \nI also got an email from apple.com saying something similar and it asked me to reply to their email to get hold of a human.\nI have not heard back.\nbelow is a copy of the email\n\nUnfortunately, our automated system was unable to approve your edits.\n  If you believe that we have made a mistake, please reply to this email\n  and request a manual review. One of our team members will then review\n  your profile and notify you of our decision.\n\n\nA: There are two possible scenarios:\n1) The person searching for your phone number knows you and has your information stored in their iPhone already.  Siri will always look first into a person's contacts when asked to \"Call X\".  If the person searching only has your home number, it will go ahead and call that number.  This will override any public information Siri may have access to.  You have no control over this other than to always ask people to add your office number to their contacts.  If Siri is not specifically told which contact to call, it will prompt the caller and they'll have to choose which number to call.\n2) The person searching for your phone number DOES NOT have you in their contacts.  If phrased correctly, Siri will search across common search engines (Bing, Google, etc.) to find the most likely match.  If the results return your home number before your office number then that is because of the way your information appears online. You have some ability to affect this if you are willing to search for yourself and then work with each of the sites that lists your information to get it listed the way you want it to appear in search results.  Or you could hire a company that specializes in such work.  Many of those can be found by searching for \"online reputation management\".\n\nA: It sounds like what is happening is that people are using Siri to search the web for your name, \"Phone number for Doctor John Smith?\" or some such.\nIf that is indeed what you are referring to then what is happening is Siri is using Bing or Google to search for you by name and it just so happens that your home number shows up in the search results before your business number.\nWhich is not really an issue with Siri or even Apple. The issue is with the WWW.\nIn other words there are more links to pages with your home phone number on it then there are to your business phone number. Go ahead, type your name into Google and Bing and see what the results are. There is very little you can do about that besides either changing your home number or putting an outgoing message directing patients to the correct number.\n", "Q: Mavericks Mail.app Text Re-formating Driving Me Bonkers I send my e-mails in plain text via mail.app. Since the release of Mavericks, there is one auto-correct feature that is driving me bonkers and I'm hoping someone here can point me in the right direction.\nWhen composing long e-mails, I will create headers using a string of dashes.

Any suggestions?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Found the answer to my own question. For some reason, simply asking the question tends to provide me more clues from which to solve it myself. Weird how that works. \nApparently there are substitutions within Mail for Smart Quote and Smart Dashes, which is what was giving me fits. You'll find it under \"Edit \\ Substitutions \\ \" \n\n", "Q: What is iLifeAssetManagement, and can I delete it? I have 5 GB of stuff in ~/Library/Application Support/iLifeAssetManagement and I'd like the space back. What is this stuff and how can I reduce its footprint?\n\nA: Yes you can delete it. I would make a backup of your Mac before deleting anything in ~/Library just in case you run into corruption.\nThis folder contains iCloud synced photos from your PhotoStream, so you might just have the folder fill up again unless you want to poke at that folder and make sure you turn off iCloud syncing before you do the pruning.\n\n\n*\n\n*Does PhotoStream sync to my Mac when iPhoto is not open?\nDeleting things from the iCloud photo stream directly will reduce the size footprint on all your devices so that's what I'd recommend in this particular case. You can sort things by size in Finder, so that might help you see if just a few large videos are responsible or if you instead have hundreds of small photos all adding up.\n", "Q: Is there a time limit on how long you can stream iTunes Radio? My iTunes Radio will shut off every few hours and ask me if I want to resume. Is there a time limit on how long you can stream iTunes Radio and if so can it be disabled?\n\nA: You should count on it shutting off pretty much at the two hour point:\n\nWhy does the music stop playing after two hours?\niTunes Radio will time out if you don't interact with your system or\n  device for approximately two hours. If this happens, simply access\n  iTunes Radio again and choose a station to continue playing.\n\nFrom: http://support.apple.com/kb/TS5181 - Common questions about iTunes Radio\nIf you set a timer and change the channel about 20 minutes before things are about to stop, my experience is your 2 hours starts anew. I don't know if there's a practical limit on how long you could keep this up or if some pause is eventually enforced on the server side.\n\nA: I think this is a standard practice of streaming services because they do have to pay (a tiny amount) for each track they play, so they want to make sure you are still there and aren't streaming their money into an empty room.\n", "Q: IOS messages - contacts with both IOS and text messaging So my kids all have \"dumb\" phones and iOS devices (iPods, iPads). Currently, I only have one contact per person, with both their iOS device and regular phone number as part of their contact. \nUnfortunately, I can't tell if I'm getting a message from their phone or iOS device. If they are on their iOS device, I can send them links, images, etc... but if their are on their phone, I can only send text messages. \nApart from creating 2 contacts for each person (one for their phone, one for their iOS device) is there any other way to tell these apart?\n\nA: So long as your children have iMessage turned on Settings.app > Messages > Turn iMessage *on*, you can determine which device you are messaging based on the color of your message bubble backgrounds or, in your specific example, the \"Send\" button color (while typing): \nGreen = non-iOS dumb phones. \nBlue = iOS devices. \n", "Q: How does Time Machine make room for new users? This is more of a hypothetical question, but we've been using a Time Capsule to back up our Macs, and it has steadily been filling up since the year or so that we've had it.\nWe've since brought a few new Macs onto the network and have started backing them up to the Time Capsule as well. From what I've read, Time Machine makes incremental backups of Macs, and apparently deletes old backups to make room for new ones.\nMy question is twofold: \n\n\n*\n\n*How does Time Machine decide which backup information to delete, especially amongst several Macs backed up to a single Time Capsule? \n\n*As we add more users to the Time Capsule, and it begins to fill, will Time Machine be smart enough to give new users enough space by deleting old backups from other users? If not, how can we achieve this?\n\nA: My experience is that TimeMachine does not cross the \"per-machine\" boundary when deleting old backups. \nWe have a disk attached to an AirportExtreme AC and which is the target for four Macs. These machines have significant differences in the size of their backups. One of them in particular is an old Mini running 10.6.8 that does not see much activity other than the occasional software update, so the incremental backups are rather tiny. The MacBook Pros on the other hand are a lot more active and regularly submit incrementals that are several GB in size.\nWhenever the MacBook Pros need space TM just discards their own history, never touching the others' directories.\nThis fact is immediately evident when comparing the number of backups for each machine. The Mini has a long history saved, the MBP's quite shorter ones.\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: Can I use a Macbook (or an iMac) as a Bluetooth Player? We all know that iPhone, iPod, and iPad cannot act as bluetooth players since they only have the hardware to act as a Bluetooth server. My question is if Macbook and iMac are similar.\nIf not, I like to set up a home network where multiple of my computers can play the same audio stream at the same time.\nThe reason that I do not use wireless audio system is because my apartment is jammed with wifi channels. There are around 200 wifi channels around me and wireless audio system doesn't work - same goes with airplay. I tried all the wireless system, only bluetooth works.\n\nA: You actually cannot. Let me explain why:\n\n\n*\n\n*The bluetooth hardware of Macbook and iMac are designed to be \"sender\" rather than \"receiver\"...\n\n*The software/driver is designed without considering using the computers as bluetooth receivers.\nIf you must connect two computers in an area where wifi channels are all taken, you can try using 5G wifi connection rather than the 2.4G - and if that still doesn't work, you are out of luck.\nNote: wireless audio receivers usually are designed with special hardware component to eliminate lags - and even so there are so significant lags on all devices. So do not expect your computers will sync - in fact, there should be half or one second lag even in an ideal condition.\nHope this help!\n\nA: I know this is an old post, but I found a way to do this and thought I would share.  If you install Airserver on the iMac then you can \"Airplay\" the song to the iMac.  It's not exactly bluetooth, and it probably uses much more battery on the phone, but it allows you to play music from your phone through the iMac (or any computer for that matter.)  Just thought I would share.\n", "Q: Setting Outlook.com contacts and calendar on OSX There are similar questions regarding the synchronization of Outlook.com on AskDifferent, mostly related to the native OSX Mail app. However, I'm particularly interested in connecting the Contacts and Calendar apps on OSX to my Outlook.com account.\nIs there a way to use my Outlook.com account to integrate with the contacts and calendar apps?\nI am aware that Outlook.com does not implement the native Exchange protocol, however considering adding an Outlook.com account on iOS seems to work just fine for mail, contacts and calendar entries, there is perhaps a decent way to achieve the same on OSX?\n\nA: I have one suggestion for Calendars which I use. You can go to http://calendar.live.com, and get a sharing link for a calendar. Take the ICS link, open Calendar on your Mac. Then, go to Import Subscribed Calendar and paste this link. Make sure to replace webcals:// with https://. This gives you a read-only subscription and at present, is the only workaround to Microsoft's stubbornness. I have no solution for Contacts though.\n\nA: For desktop usage, Outlook.com uses IMAP for mail.  However, it doesn't provide CardDAV or CalDAV access for contacts and calendars.  For mobile usage, Outlook.com uses Exchange Active Sync.  I'm not aware of any Mac desktop apps that support Exchange Active Sync.  \nYou should tell Microsoft that this is important to you.  When you login to Outlook.com, click the settings icon and then click on Feedback.  Tell them what you want, why it matters, and what you will do in lieu of having this available to you.  For example, I said this in my feedback to them about this topic (feel free to borrow this, although I'd recommend changing it to whatever is important to you):\n\nI want to be able to sync my calendar and contacts across all devices\n  that I use.  I can get my calendar and contacts on my phone, but not\n  on my Mac.  Please make it possible for me to see my calendar and\n  contacts on Mac desktop clients.  Gmail can sync my calendar and\n  contacts to my Mac desktop applications, which makes it very difficult\n  for me to use Outlook.com instead of Gmail.\n\n", "Q: Mac Pro crashed and wants to recover files on hard drive I have a Mac Pro and the motherboard is damaged and I'm trying to retrieve the files from the hard disk on my Windows 7 desktop.

It goes away when I click. But it's really annoying.\n\nWhat is the point of it and how do I get rid of it???\nThanks\n\nA: That looks like you have a Chrome plug-in that is a web site reader.\nOn your screen shot one can see the \"250wpm\" (words per minute)in bottom right corner, that would be an indication that you have a reader plug installed.\nRemove it or fix it.\n", "Q: iSight Camera not present on iMac I have an iMac 9,1 running Mavericks.

This has affected numerous people, mainly those with AirDisplay (due to the integration that AirDisplay provides — it's not really using supported APIs).\nUntil this problem is fixed, either by AirDisplay or OS X (for those suffering with a similar problem that seems to be caused by FaceTime), uninstalling AirDisplay and/or turning off FaceTime seems to fix it.\n", "Q: Does the MacBook Pro need both Ambient Light Sensors to function correctly? Does the Late 2013 15-inch MacBook Pro (Retina display) need both sensors to the left & right of the FaceTime camera in order to function correctly?\nAre these both ambient light sensors? I usually don't use FaceTime nor do I allow the system to automatically adjust the levels of brightness. \nIf the two uses mentioned above are the only two purposes for these sensors, I wouldn't really need them, or at least not both of them right?\nThe problem is the screen protector I have, which was supposedly designed for the exact specs of this laptop; yet, it clearly covers the rightmost sensor. The slightest up, down, left, or right will leave one side short and the other side overlapping the bevel. \nIf both of them happen to be ambient light sensors, my question is, in order for the macbook and other apps to function properly are both sensors necessary? Please keep in mind the fact I don't use FaceTime and do not allow the system to auto adjust brightness as well. \nElse, what are their purposes?\n\nA: On my 2015 Macbook Pro, what looks like two ambient light sensors is actually a light sensor on the left of the webcam, and a green LED on the right of the webcam that lights up when Facetime is open to let you know the camera is in use.\nThe sensor on the left can be tested by waving a flashlight in front of it and observing the keyboard dimming. The light on the right can be verified by opening Facetime.\n", "Q: Stuck on FileVault login screen with never ending spinner I am using FileVault 2.0 on Mavericks. \nAfter restarting the computer one day, I was presented with the gray file vault login screen (normal).

This spinner continues spinning indefinitely (the most I have waited at this screen is 30 minutes).\nIf I try holding down the power button and attempting to login again it fails no matter which user account I try.\nI tried using Disk Utility to verify my disk and it shows that it is fine.\nHow do I fix this problem?\n\nA: TLDR: I contacted Apple about this problem, and they recommended to reinstall OS X, which seems like a temp fix.\n\nReinstalling OS X should at least allow you to login again. This is great if you have any data that isn't backed up. However, after a subsequent restart, I have experienced this problem again, so it seems like this only a temporary solution. \n\n\n*\n\n*Restart the computer. \n\n*Hold command-c while it is starting up. \n\n*Open Disk Utility.\n\n*Select the grayed out encrypted partition. \n\n*Choose unlock.\n\n*Type in your FileVault master password.

Thus iff you say it runs on an iPad you have run it on an iPad, if I have an IPhone you have run it on an iPhone etc.\nIf I have a problem I expect you to be able to reproduce it on the hardware I have or be able to say that you see no problem on the hardware.\nNo simulator is perfect there will be differences between it and real running - especially as they use different types of processor etc. One example of this as pointed out by 0x7fffffff is that the file system in the simulator is case insensitive but on a IOS device it is case sensitive\nSo I would expect professional support to have run the app on at least an iPad and an iPhone and preferably on various models e.g. iPad and iPad mini, iPhone 4s and 5.\n", "Q: Backing up OSX and bootcamp for a new drive I'm getting a new larger size SSD for my MBP and I want to transfer my existing OSX and bootcamp partitions onto it... \nIn preperation, iI've used bootable USB CloneZilla to clone everything onto an external drive that I have.\nWhat I'm unsure about is how to restore it all back..

After completing the restore, there's now a new \"Reset Password\" button on the login screen that I swear wasn't there before. I'm afraid to click the button and mess things up, so I just want to know: if someone were to get a hold of my laptop and click that button, would they have to enter the current password before they could reset it? It makes me nervous that that button is there. How do I get rid of it?\n\nA: You should push the button and set the password to whatever you like.\nSince the machine was \"factory reset\" (as per yours) and then you dropped the TM backup on top of the reset, she/he/it now has non-matching credentials and is asking you to set things right.\nDo all this under the usual precautions: own risk, make sure your backup is good and usable in case you have to repeat the process, etc.\n", "Q: Need help figuring out how to save 1500 pictures between 2 iPhones and and iPad while traveling I need help.  I have been traveling for 5 months and have 2 iPhones with me as well as my iPad.  One of my iPhones is a 4, this is my work phone.  I have approximately 1500 pictures on this phone that I would like to be able to save before I turn my phone back into my company. (it will then be reset to factory settings). So far I have not been able to figure out how to successfully place my pictures in the iCloud so that I can access them from my personal iPhone 5 or my iPad.  I am in a very remote area and do not have a desktop or another computer with me.  Also, the wifi is often patchy.\nDo I create a photo stream on the work phone?  Do I need to email myself each and every picture?\nI have about a month and 1/2 more of this trip and my work phone is telling me that I am out of storage and unable to take anymore pictures. \nHelp..if you can.\nthanks\nA\n\nA: For part of your solution you could try Dropbox to upload the files for later retrieval.\nDownload the app on you iPhone 4 and setup an account.\nTo upload your images follow the instructions here (with visual aids). Which are:\n\n\n*\n\n*First navigate to the location within your Dropbox where you'd like\nto put the photos. Then do the following:\n\n*Tap the ellipsis (...) icon at the top right of the screen to get a\ndrop-down menu.\n\n*Tap Upload (+) from the menu.\n\n\n(Optional: To put the photos in a new folder, tap Create Folder from the menu first before uploading.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap the ellipsis icon to get a drop-down menu.\n\n*Select the album you'd like to upload photos from.\n\n*Select the photos and videos you want to upload.\n\n*Tap the Upload button at the top of the screen.\n\n\n\nYou could install the dropbox app on your personal iPhone login and the download the images from dropbox. But oddly dropbox do not do a multiple download to the iPhone photo library only single. ( pain)\nIt is possible to use third party app and logging into your dropbox account through it would allow you to do multiple downloads\n\nAlso dropbox have a new auto upload which may help you when you take new photos.\n\nThe Dropbox mobile app gives you different ways to upload files from\n  your phone or tablet to your Dropbox account. Once files are uploaded,\n  they will sync with Dropbox on your computer and all your other\n  devices.\nUpload photos and videos automatically\nDropbox can automatically upload photos and videos taken from your\n  iPhone. This feature is called Camera Upload, and you can turn it on\n  when you first install the app or by going to the app's settings. You\n  can also choose whether to allow uploading when your device is\n  connected to a cellular network.\n\n\nKeep in mind you get about 2GB+  free.\n1500 images may that up most of that space. You can see how much by looking at the usage settings on iPhone ( amount will include video sizes)\n\nA: The simplest solution would be to back up your work phone to iCloud. You might have to pay for fast wifi if yours is too slow and also turn off backing up all items except photos initially. \nLater on Make complete and current backup of one of your personal devices again using iCloud. \nNote:1, Backing up two devices to iCloud may mean you run out of  your free 5 GB allotment and may not be able to do so without buying more storage or deleting data to complete the backup/s.\nNote: 2, Also if your volume of data makes bandwidth a problem for transferring them, renting or borrowing a computer to move the files over to USB storage may be far more time efficient and save the cost of iCloud storage if you can't fit everything in your free 5 GB allotment.\nYou can also backup directly through iTunes which would mean you do not have to worry about space in iCloud with both the backups and can do the work-phone backup via iCloud while still away and the personal-phone backup via a iTunes when you get back.\nOnce both phone have been backed up though either means and you haven't managed to do note 2.\nRestore the work-phone backup from iCloud to that personal-device (remember the iOS version of the work phone)\nUse a computer to archive the photos from the newly restored temp device.\nThen restore the personal-device's current backup back to the temp device once again making it the personal device. \nAt that point, you can turn in the work phone.\nYou should now also be able to delete the old work-phone backup from iCloud. \nThe least practical method would be to beam the files using iPhoto or just airdrop them from the photos app, but I can't imagine doing that for 250 photos let alone 1.5k times. Even grouping multiple photos (5 might be the limit) to transfer a group isn't efficient use of time. \n", "Q: Stop Chrome from switching to dedicated GPU Is there a way to prevent Chrome from switching to dedicated GPU?\nBut just Chrome.

Here are the specs:\nCrucial M4 CT256M4SSD2 2.5\" 256GB SATA III MLC Internal Solid State Drive (SSD)\nCrucial 8GB (2 x 4GB) 204-Pin DDR3 SO-DIMM DDR3 1066 (PC3 8500) Laptop Memory Model CT2KIT51264BC1067\nMy problem is that after upgrading my laptop drains significantly more battery while on sleep. Like 15% per day, before upgrade it drained like 1-2% per day on sleep.\nI'm on Mavericks but with upgrades, so not a fresh install, I also enabled the trim support for the SSD with a third party app. I tried SMC reset at some point as well. I have the latest firmware update.\n\nA: You probably have one of the following enabled that could explain the power drain.\nPower Nap or Wake on WiFi, disable them, \nor read the small print that says what it will do in sleep :)\n\nAlso as said earlier, open the Console and type \"Wake\" in the search window of the Console.\nNow look who and what is waking it up and what is it  for what reason and what is it doing about it.\nAs for your question why is it consuming more power, well you added more lights to the Christmas tree.\nFor example when HDD sleeps it does not consumes any power. The cussing SSD does consume power since it reshuffle it self from time to time, that is normal for SSD to refresh its memory cells.\nUPDATE:\naccording to apple, you computer does not support the Power Nap mode settings thus enable/disable activity during the sleep.\nSo back to the Console reports:\nType \"Wake\" and look what is waking it up or keeping it awake based on time stamps.\nGoing on a limb, I would say it is your Trim support for the SSD, that you will find in the Console.\nThe TRIM command is an important disk command for SSDs that keeps your flash memory appropriately cycled so that you can achieve faster read and write speeds, as well as a longer lifespan for your SSD.\n", "Q: How to safely do a factory reset, lend my iPad, then restore it?

I've messed up and used a generic LCD cleaning product on a glass iMac screen. According to the label it consists of distilled water and surfactants (or surface-active components, don't know how to translate it correctly). As a result there are smudges on the screen. Any way to remove them?\n\nA: I have done this safely before with windex.  Just spray a little on a microfiber or even a soft towel and wipe down the screen.  As long as you do not drown it you will be fine.\nI have taken the glass off the iMac before to work inside it and they do a good job sealing the insides from the out.\nIn general, when cleaning a computer, distilled water is fine as it is non-conductive.\n\nA: Some Macs come with a microfiber cloth that works pretty well cleaning the screen. If yours didn't (or you lost it) you can pick one up at places like Amazon.com or Walmart. \nThe type of microfiber cloth that I'm referring to can be seen here at Amazon. A search returns lots of simulated terry-cloth microfiber towels (e.g.), which might work, but I recommend something like the first link.\n\nA: You definitely want to be careful so as not to damage the anti-glare coating that Apple puts on your screen at the factory. Though this method does stray from the official cleaning instructions from Apple, I've had very good results using the following method to get a pristine, streak-free screen which honors the clarity of the Retina displays on my iMac 27\" and MacBook Pro.\nCleaning Method:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use either (a) warm water, or (b) a cleaning solution specifically made for\nApple screens. (I found one called iKlear at Fry's here in San Diego, which is\nspecifically made for displays on Apple products). Apply the\nsolution (or water) to a clean microfiber cloth, then wipe the\nscreen down with it. As others have mentioned, try to use the one that came\nwith your iMac. Otherwise, just purchase a replacement (get one that is specifically made\nfor cleaning computer displays).\n\n*Get a nice shower squeegee. I always make sure to\nclean the squeegee blade off first. Use the squeegee to carefully pull the remaining\ncleaning solution to the edge of the screen (while the display is still wet). Catch the dripping solution with your microfiber cloth as you get close to the edge of the screen. Don't try to use a dirty or old squeegee. I'd recommend one like this.\n\n\nA: Let me share with you how I came to this.  My screen was heavily smudged.  I tried water, dish water, glass cleaner, vinegar, and it only got worse.  So I figured I did not have much to lose and I tried spray Lemon Pledge furniture polish. I sprayed it on, rubbed and cleaned with a soft cloth, then polished with a very clean cloth.  My screen is now almost perfect 98 out of 100 + the surface is not as sticky as it used to be.  It seems more finger print resistant and the dust blows right off.\n", "Q: Permissions For Mounted Backup Disk I just dropped a new SSD into where the optical drive was on my macbook pro. \nI did a clean install of 10.9, and i left the old drive as is without running migration assistance. \nMy Old HD is now mounted and visible on my desktop.\nWhen i try and goto /Volumes/OldDrive/Users/Foo or /Volumes/OldDrive/Users/Bar i now get a permission denied error. \nHow do i grant myself super user powers to navigate through my old files in Finder?\n\nA: One option is: \n\n\n*\n\n*select the folder\n\n*press Command-i,\n\n*expand Sharing & Permissions\n\n*click the lock to authenticate\n\n*then click the plus button\n\n*add your active user account to the list\n\n*Optional: then click the gear menu and choose \"apply to enclosed items\". (this action is recursive and could take a while as it touches every file...) \n\n\nA: Since the user IDs (which it uses to track file ownership) don't appear to match up between the old & new systems, it might be simplest to turn off file ownership on the old disk. Select the old volume in Finder (not something in it, it must be the volume), choose File > Get Info (or press Command-I), expand the \"Sharing & Permissions\" section at the bottom of the Info window, click the padlock and authenticate as an admin, then select the \"Ignore ownership on this volume\" checkbox.\n\nA: First you should know that the Apple factory hardware in many MacBookPro's do not reliably support a 6G (6Gb/s) Solid State Drive or Hard Disk Drive in the optical bay, so if you're using a new hard disk you will encounter disk corruption and many strange problems. \nSince you did a clean install the new user UUID for your account no longer matches what was there before. All the data on your old disk is protected using these old user UUIDs. You should have performed a Migration to create your \"new\" user account(s) and move over any files. You should be able to still do this from a Admin user account and the Migration Assistant application in the Application > Utilities folder. \nIf you're an admin user you should be able to Get Info on the drive and Ignore Ownership on it. (Click the lock if required.) This will allow you to access the files but now you won't have any permission checks to protect who and what processes can access the drive. But it will allow you to copy them off. \nIf you use Get Info's Sharing & Permission's you can add your new user with permissions to access the file(s) but this retains the old owner unless you also select the newly added user and use the 'gear' pulldown to \"Make  the owner\". You'll also probably want to \"Apply to enclosed items\". \nIt may just be best to disable owners on the volume, copy the files off, reformat the drive and add back your files as the new user. This will get rid of a lot of \"gremlins\" that can persist in these situations. \n", "Q: Mavericks Finder Sidebar Bug?

Is it possible and allowed to implement this website in an iPhone app?\nIf no: Is there another way to put this site on the Appstore? I haven't found any information about that.\n\nA: Pixate's Freestyle isn't a drop in wrapper to turn a webpage into an app, but it might be a good starting place to create your app. It lets you use CSS to define the style of your app.\nThat's just the look though, you will still need to figure out what you want to do for the app logic.\nYou will also need to get a iOS Developer account ($99/year) in order to submit an app to the app store. \n\nA: As traisjames says, you could indeed make a wrapper that loads your webpage.\nJust porting a website to an app isn't allowed according to Apple's App Store review guidelines (here).\nIt says so in this line:\n\n2.12 \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Apps that are not very useful, unique, are simply web sites bundled as Apps, or do not provide any lasting entertainment value may be rejected\n  \n\nContaining it in a wrapper takes care of this problem since it is not just a website anymore.\n\nA: If they need to be online to do what the website does you could just make a very basic web browser application and have it always load to your website.  You should also be able to host on the phone too, just like using file:// on your computer.\n", "Q: Screen capture utility no longer saves to Desktop In the last few weeks, screen capture stopped working on my MBP. Well, partially.\nI can still capture to the clipboard with command + control + shift + 4, but if I try to do a standard capture to a file, my Mac plays the screen capture sound but nothing gets saved on my Desktop.\nI'm running OS X 10.9.2. The issue has survived a reboot.\nAny suggestions? \n\nA: None of the answers above helped me, but I discovered the my case:\nShift + Command + Control + 4 saves the screenshot to the clipboard.\nShift + Command + 4 saves the screenshot to a file on Desktop.\nSo if you're using the first short-cuts, you have to manually open a photo editing app and paste the image, but this can be done automatically with the second short-cut.\n\nA: It sounds like the file is may be getting saved elsewhere. It can be set with \ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Desktop/ and you'll need to killall SystemUIServer or log out/in again for it to take effect. As an aside using type and name instead of location can set those as well. defaults read will tell you how things are set. \n\nA: Your Screenshot is getting saved to the clipboard instead of to a file.\nAre you using a third party mouse like a logitech mouse?  If so then go into the mouse settings and if you are using a shortcut, change the save setting to file instead of clipboard.\n\nA: Are you running Dropbox? It has a \"feature\" that grabs screenshots, copies them to a folder called \"Screenshots\" in your Dropbox folder and then puts a public URL for the file on your clipboard.\nLook for \"Screenshots\" in your Dropbox folder.\n\nA: I've never heard of this kind of issue, but I did some searching and it seems that this should work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal\n\n*Copy, paste, and enter this line:\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Desktop/\n\n\n*Copy, paste, and enter this line:\nkillall SystemUIServer\n\n(See OS X Daily source and Lifehacker source.)\n\nA: Under system preferences, go to Keyboard>Shortcuts>Screenshots.  Check your key configurations and restore default if you need to.  You can also try changing it and changing it back.\n\nA: Shift, Control, Command, 3 or 4. Copied a screen shot to your clip board.

The directory has to exist or you will get an error saying that you do not have permission to save files in the location where screen shots are stored.\nI would like to add that Shift+Command+5 shows an on-screen menu that allows more fine grained control of what is captured and where. For example if you wanted to include the Command+Tab screen you could set a countdown timer to accomplish the capture.\n\nA: This began happening to me on my MacBook Pro two days ago.  Initially I wondered whether the screenshots were lost, but I then found that the save location has been altered.  Previously the screenshots were automatically saved to Desktop.  Now they are being saved to Documents.\nThe change occurred after I had modified my System Preferences | Privacy & Security settings to allow Zoom to save recordings to the Documents folder.\nClearly there must be a way to switch the Save location back to Documents, and when I find the answer I will post it here.  In the meanwhile, it's good to know that the screenshots are not lost, so I am posting this answer, in case it assists someone else.\n\nA: Non of the above fixed it for me. What helped was using the \"Screenshot.app\" once. Afterwards the shortcut worked again as expected.\n\nA: The Screenshot utility apparently does not save the file if you have very low disk space on your Mac.\nIt appears to work, and plays the camera sound, but does not save the file. It does not display an error or alert.\nA run-away process brought my system's free disk space down to 128mb. I could not take any screenshots until I noticed that this happened.

Along with all other OS X system notifications, they are shown in Notification Center without any user intervention required to activate them. Conversely, you can't disable them either. This is the same with battery notifications, disk ejection notifications, etc.\nIf you want to disable Time Machine notifications, set the flags value for _SYSTEM_CENTER_:com.apple.TMHelperAgent in the app_info table in ~/Library/Application Support/NotificationCenter/<udid>.db to 12609 or 13639.\nIf you want to customise it further, change one of the other entries for Notification Center, then read the flags value for that app and save it as the flags value for TMHelperAgent.\n\nA: To disable Time Machine notifications on Yosemite, first find the Notification Center database by running:\ncd `getconf DARWIN_USER_DIR`/com.apple.notificationcenter/db\n\nYou'll end up in a directory containing a SQLite database called db. In this database's app_info table, set the flags value for _SYSTEM_CENTER_:com.apple.TMHelperAgent to 12609.\n", "Q: Terminal not displaying colors for directory listings I don't know why my bash session doesn't show colors.

How to transfer all my local storage contacts back to iCloud?\n\nA: If you enable contacts in iCloud settings it should ask you to do so. \nIf it is enabled already, perhaps try to turn it off and on again?\n", "Q: Is there an equivalent utility to Linux's tracepath for OS X? I'm attempting to determine the path MTU from my Mac to various sites, and can't find a built-in utility to accomplish this.\nIn Linux, I would use a utility like tracepath, but I\"m wondering if there is some sort of equivalent available for OS X.\n\nA: traceroute is available on the Mac. Traceroute is actually a more featured version of tracepath.\nman traceroute will give you the details but traceroute <host> does the same thing as tracepath <host>.\n\nA: You can use the standard ping that the Mac OSX comes with to find pmtu. \nping -D -s <size> <host> shoud do the trick. Please note, the size is just the ICMP datagram payload size. To see the IP MTU, you need to add 8 bytes of the ICMP header and 20 bytes of the IP header (so for example, to send 1500 Bytes long IP packet, you need to specify size as 1472). Please note, -D is important here, as it sets the Dont-Fragment flag on. \nYou can also use ping -D -g <minsize> -G <maxsize> -h <sizeincr> <host> to run a ping sweep. This pings your host with packets starting from minsize up to maxsize in sizeincr increments. Again, same rule applies to your sizes - these are just for ICMP payload (so you need to add 28 Bytes to the size specified here for the full IP MTU size). \nWhat you're looking for is an ICMP unreachable message back with a \"Fragmentation needed but Don't Fragment flag on\" sub-type back. The IP address of the sender of the above ICMP message is the host or router which has its MTU set to lower than the size of your packet, on the link which it would use to forward your packet further towards the destination. \nPlease note as well, that sometimes (badly misconfigured) firewalls or traffic filters will block all ICMP messages and in such case, you'll just see no response. To test which host dropped the packet, you could run traceroute to your destination and then repeatedly ping every hop on the way with '-D' and a size or a sweep to discover the local MTU of the link that hop is connected to. It will be the link between the last host you can ping and the first host you can't that will have a smaller MTU. \nAgain - this is all subject to routers handling ICMP, which they might not. \nThe PMTUD (Path MTU Discovery) protocol works in the same fashion. It uses TCP packets with DF flag on. The TCP sessions endpoints agree on their MSS (Maximum Segment Size, which is MTU less IP and TCP headers, 40B) - they choose the smaller of the MSS values advertised by each host in the TCP handshake. Then they send all traffic with DF flags on, and wait for the ICMP unreachable or a TCP ACK. The latter means the PMTU is sufficient, the former mean they need to drop MSS. \nHope that helps!\n\nA: doing a ping -DRo <hostname| IPAddr> did a simple tracepath for me\nI also created a simple shellscript called tracepath, and looks like:\n#!/bin/sh\n#ping -D -g <minsize> -G <maxsize> -h <sizeincr>\necho \"tracepath to $1 \\n\"\nping -DRo $1\n\nNot quite as nice as a real tracepath\n", "Q: What's the menu area near the clock called? \nWhat is the part of the menu bar called with the time machine, bluetooth, wifi, volume and battery icons called? (Near the clock)\nI wanted to search how to remove unused icons from it (like timemachine)\n\nEdit: How can I get rid of this icon in my menu bar? How can I put the icon back?\nI'd still like to know what it's called, like the system tray on Windows.\n\nA: The answer above is true. To add to that:\nThey're also known as menu items. You can also remove them by holding down the command key and dragging them out of the menu and it will release its magic smoke be removed from the menu bar. (Just like you can remove items from the dock).\nIt seems that you can only remove Apple menu extras using the method mentioned above. To remove any third party menus you will have to hunt around the file system and remove it manually or get lucky with an uninstaller that removes the program and it's associated menu extra.\nTo reload the menu extras (which I believe is the correct Apple name for them as per answer above), you can just restart SystemUIServer using /Applications/Utilites/Activity Monitor making sure you have View > All Processes selected in the view menu.\nFor advanced, you can just do:\nIn Terminal:\nkillall -KILL SystemUIServer\n\nto check to see if you have got rid of that pesky menu extra that you wanted to get rid of. If its still running, keep hunting!\n\nA: These are called menu extras. \nThey are different from status bar items (which are usually used in other apps) in that you can hold command and drag them around. \nEach of these can be turned on and off with a checkbox in System Preferences (the Bluetooth one can be toggled in Bluetooth preferences, etc.)\n\nA: They are also known as 'menulets'.

I am considering an application called Mac Informer.\nIs this application safe?\n\nA: Applications bought through the Mac App Store are handled by Apple's mechanism. Most non-App Store Mac applications include their own built-in software updating mechanisms.\nI would approach this as a question of what value does Mac Informer offer over the risk of opening up your Mac to an unknown company.\nAt some stage, the application will need your administrator privileges to install software updates. This will expose your Mac to any actions, positive or negative, the application wishes to take.\nThe lack of identifiable individuals, lack of physical address, and lack of registered company details on the about page does concern me.\n", "Q: Why does ssh not detect disconnects? If I SSH into a remote host on OS X, and then close the lid and travel home, upon opening the lid, OS X sometimes notes rather quickly that a disconnect has occurred (with the message \"Broken pipe.\"), but often ssh just hangs. I thought of adding TCP keep-alives, however, the man page notes:\n\nThe default is \"yes\" (to send TCP keepalive messages), and the client will notice if the network goes down or the remote host dies.\n\nIs there anything more I can do or check? Why does it work?\n\nA: sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.always_keepalive=1\n\n(or net.inet.tcp.always_keepalive=1 in /etc/sysctl.conf)\n\nA: If you travel from your office to your home, your MacBook will be disconnected from any network.\nEven if ssh sent a keepalive, it would not be received by the server (because your computer is offline).\nThe best thing you can do: quit your ssh session before traveling, it will at least avoid ssh hangs.\n", "Q: How can I have one password for FileValue 2 (pre-boot password) and another for my user login? I know this is possible.\nWhen I first installed Mavericks, I set up a default password of \"password\".\nI then enabled Filevault 2.\nAt some point I then changed my password from \"password\" to my actual password.\nHowever the pre-boot password is still \"password\".\nI like the fact that there were two different passwords, but I want to change the pre-boot password to something better than \"password\" (obviously!) but...\nHow?\nOn my laptop, I've done some testing and changing the user login password also updates the pre-boot password.\nAnd if I fail the pre-boot password 3 times and use the recovery key, I can update the  password, but it only updates the user login password, which in turn automatically updates the pre-boot password.\nSo they are always in sync.\nSo how on earth did I originally have 2 different passwords, and how can I continue to have 2 different passwords?\n\nA: As you've found, there's an sync process when you change your password that automatically updates your account login at the FileVault 2 pre-boot login screen. However, if you're OK with having to login twice, there's a way to set the FileVault 2 login process on Mavericks so that you're stopped at the OS login window after logging in at the FileVault 2 login window.\nThe way to do this is to disable FileVault 2's automatic login, which is the process that the OS uses to automatically log you into your account after you've logged in at the FileVault 2 pre-boot login screen. Apple has a KBase article here that shows how to do this:\nOS X: How to disable automatic login when FileVault is enabled\nOnce you've disabled automatic login, set up a new local account on your Mac and set it to use a different password from your account's password. New local accounts should be automatically enabled for FileVault 2 access, so you shouldn't need to do anything else. Since this second account is only going to be used as a FileVault 2 login, I'd recommend making it a standard user with no admin privileges.\nAfter that, reboot your Mac and login at the FileVault 2 pre-boot login screen using your new account's password. When the OS unlocks and boots, you should then be stopped at the OS login window. At that point, login with your regular username and password.\n", "Q: How does Font Book.app determine the \"Design style\" for a Smart Collection? In Font Book.app one of the criteria for creating a Smart Collection is \"Design style\".\n\nHow does Font Book.app determine whether or not a given font falls into one of the available categories?\n\nA: OK, I think I figured it out...  Opening a font in RoboFont, I scoured all the obscure meta-info available and finally found the entry that seems to correspond to what FontBook uses for the Design Style in the section called Panose (a term I had never heard of!).  Long story short... FontBook seems to probably use the Proportion to determine the style. \n\n\nA: That kind of info is often included in the metadata of the font file itself, especially in OTF files. It is usually the type designer or foundry that categorizes the font in the first place.\n", "Q: Where are the power-on jumpers on a mid-2013 MacBook Air logic board? I'm trying to locate the power-on jumpers on the logic board of mid-2013, 13\" MacBook Air.  Similar to this question, but for the newer model MacBook Air.\nI have disassembled and cleaned all components after I had a liquid spill. Computer seems to be charging ok now; previously was not. I suspect the keyboard is damaged but want to start computer to run a systems check. \n\nA: They are located just above the airport card.  A small flat head or T7/T8 bit should work for bridging them.\nYou can see them in step 17 of iFixits Logic Board replacement guide:\n\nPower Pads highlighted with a red square along the top edge of the Mac, picture courtesy of iFixit\nSomething to keep in mind is that a damaged or faulty keyboard could prevent a Mac from starting if the power button is always registering a press. If I were troubleshooting this I would first try to short it using the power pads. If that didn't work after a couple of attempts (the flat ones are more difficult to short) I would disconnect the keyboard's flex connection (to the right of the battery connection) and attempt it again.\nObviously, always use caution when working inside of a Mac that has power supplied to it.\nGood luck!\n\nA: The jumpers are sometimes labeled something like \"PWR\"\n\nA: I also have a 13.3 MacBook Air Mid-2013 with liquid damage. I replaced the keyboard and the power button still doesn't work. So here is how I get it to boot up:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disconnect the battery for a few seconds (charger not connected) and then reconnect the battery.\n\n*Connect the charger and after a second the MacBook will boot up.\n\n\nI just let it to go to sleep when I'm not using it.

ago: The first rule of troubleshooting is \"Isolate And Identify.\" Pound that into your brain.\nIn other words, strip the system down to the minimum, unplug EVERYTHING that is not needed to boot the computer, undo any changes (especially hardware) that were made to the computer, no matter how long ago they were done. Uninstall any software you recently installed, undo any changes you recently made. Create a new (admin) user and see if it repeats in that login.\nTHEN if you can get it to stop crashing or acting wrong start re-doing the changes ONE AT A TIME till they start to recur. Sometimes the strings and smallest change can cause problems. Even if it doesn't seem reasonable to you, it could be the problem.\nUpgrading to Mavericks MIGHT fix the problem. Removing the new(isn) RAM might also fix the problem. Failing those things start unplugging and uninstalling...\n\nA: That looks (the report) very similar to a problem I've got.  It started with frozen screens & Kernel Panics, every now and again, slowly its got worse, so I decided to investigate.  After doing several things, I decided to do an AHT test (hardware test = pressing \"D\" on start up), after doing an \"Extended Test\" the result was 4/MEM/9/40000000: 0xb73ce318 which I'm pretty certain means a bad RAM chip?  Which means finding the bad RAM chip & \"retiring it\" (taking all but one out & testing them one at a time, until you find the culprit)?\nI have a late 2010 27\" iMac & Mavericks 10.9.4\n", "Q: Life without optical input I'm upgrading from a Mac Mini to an iMac and am quite surprised to learn that I'm losing some connectivity options. Firewire I can live without, but I quite needed the optical input on my Mac Mini.\nI have a PC and a Mac, and one set of speakers. So I used the optical output from my PC to the optical input on my Mac Mini and was quite happy with that arrangement. But it seems the iMac lacks optical input. What options are open to me? I can find professional solutions from M-Audio that would work, but I'd rather not have to pour hundreds of dollars into making up for a missing port.\n\nA: You can connect the optical outputs of your two computers to an optical switch, then connect the switch to your speakers.\nSince most switches have TOSLINK inputs you might need 3.5mm optical -> TOSLINK cables to connect your computers to the switch.\nAll of these parts are common and relatively cheap.\n\nA: I'm using a miniDSP USBstreamer B for 2-channel optical I/O on an iMac Pro.\n", "Q: Can not share the internet via wireless \n\nOK, from the first picture it is a case of internet sharing via wireless is successful. And in the second case on picture two I tried to share internet via wireless by tick off and tick on \"Internet Sharing\"(again and again) but it doesn't work. I can not share the internet via wireless (notice the red highlight frame the wireless status logo it doesn't change)\nwhat have i tried ?\nSometimes, I could figure out this problem by restart my computer. But do you have the another ways to figure out this problem without of restarting the computer? \n\nA: I noticed an Issue in our Company on some of the 2011 27-Inch iMacs were sometimes the Ethernet-Adapter failed.\nIf your Ethernet Adapter is not connected to the Internet, your Mac won't share the connection via Wireless, because there is no ethernet/internet to share.\nYou may try it : Plug in the ethernet cable, share the ethernet via wireless.\nIf it starts to share ( like in the first picture ), plug off the cable and watch what happens. I can't reproduce it here, but it will probably change to the grayed icon as seen in picture 2.\nOther reason could be a failure of the Router were the internet is coming from.\nThe Sharin panel is simply sharing \"Internet Access\" so if you are connected to your Intranet ( Home Network ) but not to the Internet (www), then it will also not work like you expect it. The Icon will stay gray, until you are sure you have access to the Internet.\nAnd If you really have Internet Access via the Ethernet Adapter, then there is something wrong with the Mac. \nYou could Try :\n- Reset PRAM (at start sound press CMD + ALT + P + R)\n- Reset SMC (press power button for a couple of seconds when the cable is unplugged and the mac is turned of)\n- Restart the Ethernet Adapter -> go to the system preference pane for the network, click on the ethernet adapter -> go down to the little gear and click on deactivate service, wait a minute, then click on activate service and the ethernet should start properly.\nThis could happen if the Ethernet Drivers are not working properly and in some cases it can happen, that those crash. I had that Issue on a older Mac Pro that always refused to connect, when I restarted the router and the mac got a new IP.\nSo there are as always many reasons, that could cause the problem.\njust comment if you are getting any closer to the problem.\nThen we are able to help in a more specific way.\n\nA: i try also many things, but after i change the network name in wifi options in internetsharing its work and i got the arrow back :)\n\nA: It worked for me (Yosemite) just changing the WiFi Name in the Internet sharing settings and then activating internet sharing again.\n", "Q: How to install coqide (or such) with brew I went into a lot of troubles getting coq installed on my Mac (Mavericks) and it actually didn't install coqide along…\nUnfortunately 'brew options coq' has no results so I don't know how to install properly coqide.\nIf it's too complicated, it's fine, I'd welcome any alternate solution (like a sublime text plugin or such).\nThanks.\n\nA: The same bug (in the existing released binary) is reported here:\nhttp://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/coq/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=3155\nand in the comments a link to recent builds is given:\nhttp://www.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~pboutill/coq-night/v8.4/\nI don't know about stability, but 8.4pl4 appears to be working on Mavericks. I was able to build/install following README instructions (might additionally require install of OCaml and other tools, which I happened to already have.) The associated coqide also appears to be working without trouble.\nI am not a seasoned Coq user, so if there are any functionality or stability considerations in this non-published version, then they would be going far over my head.\n", "Q: How to know if the System Management Controller (SMC) has been reset? I've recently uninstalled Fan Control, and one of the steps of the uninstallation is that I need to reset the SMC.\nSo I've done that according to the instructions from the Apple website, however how can I be sure that it has been reset successfully? In particular, I wouldn't want the laptop to overheat because of incorrectly setup fans.\nIs there any way to check all this (i.e. if the SMC and the fans are working as expected)?\n\nA: There is no confirm message with SMC reset, however, if you go through post checks on the processes it controls you can get an indication of whether it has worked or not (more here). In your case (fans), run the MacBook in the finder (no overt applications running like Firefox) and listen to the fans - if they are running high then SMC reset was likely unsuccessful. \nNote: there are different procedures for SMC reset on different Macs including MacBooks with or without a user changeable battery, so double check Apple support online for the right model (rather than a generic 'how to reset' post).\nI run a couple of MacBooks including a Pro Quad i7 2012 17\" with the 1 GB graphics card. I can have Photoshop, Indesign and Illustrator open at once without high fans - although it slows to a crawl and fans rage if I run more than 3 or 4 Firefox windows and launch another browser (for website checking) which is a pain. Flash / Ad blockers help control this but its also worth looking at what is running in the background with Activity Monitor. For example, I installed a programme to force clean Ram memory which will fracture over a few hours of work... ironically when it decides to clean, the programme hogs 95% of the processor and the Mac goes into overdrive for 3 or 4 minutes, so I deleted it. \nGenerally you have to work more efficiently on a  Mac Notebook and high fans / spinning ball are more common than on an iMac or MacPro. Clean the OS, run Onyx regularly (GUI management for the unix maintenance and cleaning scripts on your Mac) and consider Chrome (or other light) web browser. Also look out for anything running Akamai in the background and Updaters such as Adobe Application Manager - they tend to launch at startup and sit there all day talking to your web connection 'just in case' there is an update. Take control with an IP manager like Little Snitch and make these updates manually once a week. \n\nA: Actually, as per my experience if you are going to do the SMC reset and your not fully charged battery Macintosh machine is charging, the charging indicator will be the reset indicator as below.\nWhen battery is not fully charged:\n\n\n*\n\n*Charging indicator is orange light when machine powered off.\n\n*Keep pressing Shift + Option + Control + Power for 10 seconds and indicator is still orange.\n\n*Indicator turns to green when release all keystrokes and keeps almost 1 second.\n\n*Light turns to orange then.\n\nA: Here are the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn Airport off ( or disconnect Ethernet or any internet connection )\n\n*Reset SMC\n\n*Turn on computer\n\n\nif you succesfully reseted SMC then system date and time will be wrong.\n\n\n*Connect to internet again to automatically set date and time..\n\n\nhope it helped. \n\nA: You could try installing apps like Fan Control or SMCFanControl, but generally, as you'd expect, you'll know if your fans are not working properly if your machine is getting overheated. \n", "Q: How do I change my DNS settings for 3G? I want to use GoogleDNS while I'm on the bus. But there is no settings page to change as far as I can see.\n\nA: You cannot change the dns while on cellular.

How free is Mavericks?\nIs it free as a free beer?\nI want to run in on virtual machine and do not own licence for it (but it's free, right?) - is it OK?\nWhat about hard to find solutions of newest OS - easiest thing to do is to install older system like Snow Leopard and upgrade to Mavericks. Snow Leopard would be at that point without licence, but solely in purpose for installing free new system.\nHow does Apple licencing define that \"free\" Mavericks?\n\nA: You can download the OS X Mavericks license agreement from Apple's Software License Agreements page. It's definitively not free of either license or copyright. The licensing terms stipulate only running it on Apple hardware and furthermore restricted on how to use it with virtual machines on top of Apple hardware. You need to also consider the App Store license terms for your country if you download the free-of-cost Mavericks software from that store.\nBelow is a relevant extract from the OS X Mavericks licence:\n\n2. Permitted License Uses and Restrictions.\nA. Preinstalled and Single-Copy Apple Software License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, unless you obtained the Apple Software from the Mac App Store or under a volume license, maintenance or other written agreement from Apple, you are granted a limited, non- exclusive license to install, use and run one (1) copy of the Apple Software on a single Apple- branded computer at any one time. For example, these single-copy license terms apply to you if you obtained the Apple Software preinstalled on Apple-branded hardware.\nB. Mac App Store License. If you obtained a license for the Apple Software from the Mac App Store, then subject to the terms and conditions of this License and as permitted by the Mac App Store Usage Rules set forth in the App Store Terms and Conditions (http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/ww/) (“Usage Rules”), you are granted a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive license:\n(i) to download, install, use and run for personal, non-commercial use, one (1) copy of the Apple Software directly on each Apple-branded computer running OS X Mountain Lion, OS X Lion or OS X Snow Leopard (“Mac Computer”) that you own or control;\n(ii) If you are a commercial enterprise or educational institution, to download, install, use and run one (1) copy of the Apple Software for use either: (a) by a single individual on each of the Mac Computer(s) that you own or control, or (b) by multiple individuals on a single shared Mac Computer that you own or control.

Currently Whited00r has not released any firmwares for iPhone 3GS and iPod touch 4G , are they planning to release it in the near future?\n\nA: Currently, the whited00r project only supports the iPhone 2G, 3G, iPod 1, and iPod 2. The following is from the whited00r website.\n\nWhited00r is the biggest community of iOS modding and firmware cooking in the world. Here you will find full support for all Apple devices equipped with the ARMv6 CPU: \n  iPhone 2G & 3G, iPod Touch 1G, 2G.\n\nSo as to why they didn't release it, there are several reasons.\n\n\n*\n\n*The iPhone 3GS and the iPod 4 clearly don't run the ARMv6 CPU. They run the A4 chip (according to the specs, the iPhone 3GS has a ARMv8-Cortex, which is supposedly part of the A4 chip. Correct me if I'm wrong). The A4 chip is also on the iPhone 4, which shows that the devices are very capable, unlike the supported devices which can barely play new games.\n\n*The goal of the whited00r project is to bring new iOS features to old devices that cannot go past iOS 3/4. The iPhone 3GS and the iPod 4 can go up to iOS 6.1.6, which packs plenty of new features.\n\n*Whited00r is basically a new user interface. If you want your devices to look like iOS 7, jailbreak your device (http://posixspwndownload.com for iOS 6.1.3-6.1.5 and http://evasi0n.com for iOS 6.0 to 6.1.2) and grab Winterboard and a iOS 7 theme.\n\n\nSorry if this was a little harsh, but the whited00r team has reasons for not supporting them.

How can I find out what files are installed by an installer program?  Is there a program that can trace that during an installation of a new app?\n\nA: You can press command-I in an installer window to see a list of files that would be copied by the installer:\n\nYou can also use lsbom:\nlsbom bundle.pkg/Contents/Archive.bom\nlsbom $(pkgutil --bom nonbundle.pkg)\n\nIf you have already installed a package, you can use pkgutil --files or lsbom:\npkgutil --files com.tapbots.TweetbotMac\nlsbom /var/db/receipts/com.tapbots.TweetbotMac.bom\n\n\nA: There’s an app called Pacifist (shareware, $20) which allows you to inspect OS X package files and look at their contents. Quoting directly from their website:\n\nThis is useful, for instance, […] if you want to inspect a downloaded package to see what it will install before installing it.\n\nYou can download it for free (which has a 15 second delay on startup), or $20 to register. By using the Open Package command on an installer, you can look inside the installer package and find out what it’s doing. Usually you can find a script or similar, which you can use to see what gets installed and moved.\n\nA: Within the Installer.app application, you can use the File > Show Files… menu to list the package contents. This list reflects the compressed files that Installer will copy onto your Mac.\nInstaller.app is launched when you open a standard installer package.\nBe aware that an installer package, pkg and mpkg, can install files using scripts or other methods that are difficult to detect.\nTo truly determine what files are installed or modified, you would need to track and monitor the installer package as it was being applied to your Mac. This includes tracking processes launched by the installer and the results of any scripts it runs.\nIf you are uncertain about an installer, contact the developer. We for example publish a list of files installed and any scripts used. It is good practice and customer demand will help push developers to share this detail.\n\nA: @Lri's answer is excellent and I want to add info about another flag for pkgutil. From the manpage:\n\n--payload-files path\nList the files archived within the payload of the uninstalled flat package(s) contained at path.  This should be equivalent to \"lsbom -s `pkgutil --bom path`\". Note that flat package archives may contain more than one package, and the destination location for the uninstalled package(s) is unknown to this command.\n\nExample:\npkgutil --payload-files node-v10.15.3.pkg\n\nUsing this flag, I was able to see the same list as presented by the \"Show Files\" command (⌘ + i) in Installer.\n\nA: If you are using 10.4.x \"Tiger\" or 10.5.x \"Leopard\" then fslogger is one way to log changes to your system.

I have installed VirtualBox in order to use Windows 7 as guest on a Macbook Air running Mavericks (mainly to be able to use a printer that has no drivers for Mac). Also, I have installed the Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack and the Guest Additions, so that now the video settings as well as the support for USB are available. Except that, while the flash drives as well as the printer work, the external HDD drives connected by USB do not.\nAfter un-mounting the external HDDs in Finder they appear only greyed out in VirtualBox system tray. \n\nAdding them as filters in the Settings of the Virtual Machine makes them look selected as they should (no longer greyed out), but they are still not available in the guest Windows.   \nI am talking about two external HDD drives, both 500 GB, one ntfs and one fat32.\nI expected the USB connections to work fully after installing the Extension_Pack and the Guest Additions, but it looks like there's something more to be done.\nWhat?\n\nA: Once I ejected the hard drive from mac os, it was instantly recognized by the guest windows virtual machine.\n\nA: insert Guest Additions CD image.iso corresponding to your version number http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/ worked for me once I unmounted USB from host OS launched VB, went into settings adding the USB filter and pointed to desired USB, launched VB, logged in to windows, voila, right there in computer devices as Drive (E:)\n\nA: Host: MacBook Pro Summer 2014 with Mac OS Sierra 10.12.6 (has USB 3.0 ports).\nGuest: Windows 7 Professional 64-bit (I have not installed USB 3 capability yet).\nWin7 would not recognise a USB 2.0 Kingston 16GB memory stick. I have VirtualBox extensions installed, and have added a USB device filter under VM settings.\nI have solved the problem by plugging a USB 2.0 hub into the MacBook Pro's USB 3.0 port, and then plugging the USB 2.0 memory stick into the hub. It works.\n(I have a Kensington PocketHub Mini USB 2.0 with 4 ports).\nLikewise I can now use a SanDisk Ultra USB 3.0 memory stick through the USB 2.0 hub.\nThis also solved a similar problem with an HP-Prime graphical calculator; the HP software on my mac would not see the calculator if it was plugged directly into the USB 3.0 port, but it was fine when I used the USB 2.0 hub.\n\nA: In my case (OSX Catalina, Virtual Box 6.1 and Windows 10 virtualized), I managed to get it working by using the the Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack.\nGet them from the official downloads page. Make sure to download the exact version for the VirtualBox that you have installed. \nAfterward, follow the instructions for their installation. In case something happens to that third party site, here they go:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open VirtualBox.\n\n*From the left list, click Tools>Preferences. A window should appear. \n\n*From the icons at the top of that window, select Extensions. Click the plus (+) button at the right, browse to the folder where you downloaded the extension, and open the extension package. VirtualBox will notify you that you are about to install an extension pack. Confirm to install. After that, it should appear as active in the list of extension packages. \n\n*Make sure that your virtual machine is not running. \n\n*Check the settings of your virtual machine (select it in the left list of the main VirtualBox window and click the settings icon at the top) and make sure that in Ports>USB the USB controller is enabled and is using the USB 3.0 controller. If you don't see your external hard disk drive listed at the bottom, add it with the plus (+) button at the right of the list. \n\n*Umount (but DON'T unplug) your external hard disk drive from OSX. Start your VM. You should have access to the hard disk drive inside the virtual machine.\n\n\nThis worked for me. I needed to partition an external hard disk drive with a NTFS partition.\n\nA: I have an issue maybe related (i do not use MAC at all)...\nI can not make VirtualBOX to pass to the Guest a \"USB 2.0 Hub\"... it is not listed, it is hidden.\nDoes your USB HDD's have an internal HUB? Some have it... like some WD that also have a VirtualCD.\nMaybe it is not related to your problem, but maybe it is.\nAnother problem i have with VirtualBOX USB redirect is that two USB devices (same name) can not be passed to the Guest at same time... it only pass the first one i try...\nI do not know much about MAC, but my experience with VirtualBOX USB redirect is that it fails a lot in some conditions... no matter if host is Windows or Linux... it is VirtualBOX USB redirect what is failing!!! So i think the same will happen on MAC's.\nIt is just an idea!!!\n\nA: Seems like you'd like the guest system to handle the whole USB thing.\nBecause OSX automatically attaches USB devices, you'll have to do the following:\nOpen Machine Settings > USB > Click the green plus symbol > Select your HDD.\nThen unplug the Disk and plug in again, from now on the guest should see it as an USB device.\n\nA: After unmounting your drive in the Finder, try opening Disk Utility, and see if the drive can be ejected.

The logic board has needed replacement a couple times, meaning we stopped using graphics-intensive apps, and it has just gotten slower, and the hard drive is becoming full (obviously that will need to be dealt with).\nAre Mavericks's performance improvements (App Nap, etc.) enough to make it not slower than 10.6.8? Stability is key, and I'm not sure the graphics card can handle it.\nWith goto fail and the other bugs that have yet to be discovered, I'm not sure when it would be a good idea to upgrade.\n\nA: My brother owns a Mid-2008 MacBook Pro and installed a fresh Mavericks. In his opinion, it is worth doing this since Mavericks' performances are better than the Lion and ML releases.\nHowever, he did replace his HDD with a SSD drive to make its MBP fast enough to run Mavericks.\nSo I cannot encourage you to install Mavericks on your older MBP without changing some components (and at least remove some stuffs from your hard-drive to get more space).\nAbout the Mavericks bugs: the two updates made the things better, even if there are still some annoying issues. But that should not be your choice criterion.\nMy advice\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a Time Machine backup of your MBP and give a try to Mavericks (with a fresh install).\n\n*If it is too slow on your MBP , you will have to re-install a fresh OS X 10.6, but this will probably be a good thing: having a fresh install sometimes solves some annoying issues.\n\n*if it is OK for you then let us know your experience\n\n", "Q: Can't log in until after reboot I have an iMac running OS X Mavericks and OS X Server.

It's fine after a reboot.\nWhen the iMac is in one of those bad states, I can still ssh to it from another Mac, and I can \"sudo shutdown -r now\" to restart it.\nAny ideas about what is going wrong, or how to diagnose the problem?\nUpdate:\nAfter uninstalling an old version of VirtualBox about a week ago, the problem hasn't recurred.  Maybe its kexts were causing problems?\n\nA: From your symptoms and the lack of any other any evidence within your\nlog files,\nthe origin of your problem is a keyboard mode switch.\nThis keyboard mode switch will only make your password wrongly typed through the login window and not through an ssh access.\nThis remapping of your keyboard might have been caused by command ⌘+space (select previous input source) or command ⌘+alt ⌥+space (select next input source).\nThe 1st one of these 2 key combinations may be easily entered by typing the spacebar on one of its left or right borders, thus pressing the command ⌘ at the same time.\nThis shortcut is defined in:\nSystem Preferences > Language & Text > Input Sources\n\nThis keyboard remapping might also have been done by any other keyboard shortcut defined by Xcode or another application.\nTo avoid to be trapped by such an invisible keyboard remapping or misbehaviour, here are 2 personnal trick.\n\n\n*\n\n*Within System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Options,\nfor Display login windows as:\nselect Name and password.\nHence you will have a possibility to diagnose any wrong mapping or any other misbehaviour of your keyboard within the field Name:. You might try your password there and have a total feedback.\n\n*Within System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Options,\nactivate the function Show Input menu in login window. This 2nd trick won't help you diagnose a dead key.\n", "Q: Does macOS support AnyIP? I would like to assign a complete block to my Mac as described in this question: Can I bind a (large) block of addresses to an interface?\nThere it is explained that AnyIP is supported for IPv6 by the Linux Kernel and how to configure it on your device, but the command being used is ip, which seems not available on macOS. If this technique is supported on macOS, what is the command to achieve the same?\nPS. I know how to add a single IPv6 to an interface using the command ifconfig -r -L en1 inet6 fe80::2/64 alias\n\nA: The feature is not supported on macOS.\nDepending on how many IP addresses you want to listen to, you could use a simple script to bind each IP-address to the interface individually using the ifconfig alias command.\n", "Q: Copy pasting italicized content in Pages Pages is my word processor.

I am using VirtualBox to play Civilization III (from Steam) in Windows 7 on my 13\" Retina Macbook Pro. The only problem is it's horrendously slow. It seems like this only impacts screens with animation (which is basically everything). Because other programs work fine, I believe a change of VirtualBox settings might provide a fix.

I created an event on my Mac's calendar that was scheduled to repeat every Tuesday and Wednesday. Later, on my iPhone, I wanted to change the repeat interval to Wednesday and Friday instead, but I couldn't figure out how to do so.\nWhen I went to edit the repeat interval for the event on iOS, the only options were (a) the custom interval for Tuesday and Wednesday (selected), (b) none, or (c) the default intervals like daily, weekly, etc.\nI thought that tapping on the custom interval would let me edit it, but instead it just re-selected it. However, when I selected a different repeat interval instead, the custom interval disappeared entirely, and there was no option to create a new custom interval.\n(I also created a new event entirely and found that the Repeat settings don't include a \"custom\" option in that case, either).\nSo it is just not possible to create or edit custom repeat intervals on iOS? I'm running the latest iOS 7.1 on an iPhone 4.\n\nA: This article on OSX Daily teaches that using Siri can result in custom reminder intervals.

Any ideas?\nEdit: yes, My iPod's Bluetooth was on\n\nA: You need to open both your cars bluetooth settings (there should be something like \"pair new device\") and your iPod's bluetooth settings.\nThat way the devices can get paired.

I'm signed into the same iCloud account on both my Mac and iPhone. Podcast syncing is enabled in iTunes, and the \"Sync Subscriptions\" setting is turned on in the settings for the Podcasts app on my iPhone.\nWhy, then, does podcast syncing simply not work?\nSome examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I've played through a podcast episode on my iPhone, the same episode in iTunes won't be marked as played (and vice versa)\n\n*If I'm partway through an episode, the playback position doesn't sync between my iPhone and iTunes\n\n*iTunes will download podcast episodes that I've already marked as played on my iPhone (and vice versa), even though I've set both to download only unplayed episodes\n\n*If I subscribe to a new podcast on my iPhone, it won't appear in iTunes (and vice versa)\n\n*Etc., etc.\n\n\nI feel like I must be doing something wrong or am missing a setting somewhere, because if not, I can't believe that podcast syncing is this unreliable. It quite literally does not work in any way whatsoever.\nI've tried turning syncing on and off, signing in and out of iCloud, etc. Podcast syncing simply has never worked for as long as I've been using the Podcasts app (going back to iOS 6).\n\nA: Nope it really doesn't work period.  I've spent so many hours trying to sort this out with my own collection.  No matter what I do itunes keeps trying to download long dead and dormant episodes I do not want or need.\nI have marked them as played.  I have marked them so that they are not saved podcasts.  I have deleted the feeds.\nI have performed the equivalent steps on the iphone itself.  Then all of a sudden the podcast episodes return and show as unplayed....and therefore begin downloading again....usually when I am busy doing something else.\nI have a number of podcasts subscriptions.  I like to keep some channels like a library on my hard drive that I may return to at some stage and I have others where I will never listen to them again and am happy for them to be deleted.  However I almost exclusively listen to podcasts on the road and could not fit my library on the iphone to save for all time.\nThere are some desperately needed basic fixes here by apple and it seems by all I have seen the issues are being ignored.  I am dumbfounded by the deaf and dumb approach to the gradual destruction of this app and the determination not to fix anything.\nIt suggests Apple has reached a critical mass where deadbeats have moved into management positions and the slow process of riding this company into the ground has commenced.  Companies rarely recover from this....it already looks too late from my perspective and experiences.\nThe current behaviour requires that you not only micromanage your podcast lists; you must be hyper-vigilant at all moments lest one of your devices starts trying sync something even when the sync options are turned off.\nMy device is constantly attempting to download podcast episodes and filling up storage capacity.\nI thought torture was meant to be illegal.....\n\nA: Apple's entire podcast ecosystem is known to be buggy and has been for a long time. (See, for example, this bug of utter disconnect between iTunes and iOS prior to the arrival of the Podcasts app. It seems the point of moving podcasts to a dedicated iOS app was simply to banish the irredeemably buggy podcast code from the otherwise well functioning Music app code. I still have the exact same problems with iOS 7.1 and the Podcasts app.) You're not doing anything wrong, the stuff just doesn't work.\nYou will have better luck with Instacast. There are other third-party podcast players for iOS, but AFAIK Instacast is the only popular one that also plays on Macs and syncs between iOS and Macs. As of this writing (April 2014), Pocket Casts is arguably better than Instacast with respect to syncing among mobile devices, as it even syncs between iOS and Android, but it does not have a Mac application to allow you to play podcasts on your Mac.\n\nA: Actually it does work:  \nJust sync as usual between your Mac and your iPhone (make sure to check the podcasts you want to sync as you would do with playlists and songs).  \nThen open your Podcast app on your iPhone and choose the Podcast you want to listen to.  \nOn the second screen you'll have 3 options available:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unplayed  \n\n*Feed  \n\n*Saved  \n\n\nAll the podcasts you have downloaded on your Mac are in the \"Saved\" option.  \nI hope this will help.\n\nA: This Apple KB article solves the issue for me:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT6202\n", "Q: Inserting several pictures into MS Word at once without using Media Browser In Microsoft Word 2011, we can either \"insert picture from file\" or \"insert from photo (media) browser\". For users who do not have pictures stored in iPhoto or Photobooth, we are forced to use \"insert picture from file\" method, which only allows for one picture to be added at a time.  How can I add more than one picture at a time?\n\nA: There is a workaround, going through TextEdit:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open TextEdit, and create a new file.\n\n*In TextEdit, add the images to the new file.\n\n*In TextEdit, select all of your images and copy them (cmd-A, cmd-C).\n\n*In Word, paste the images (cmd-V).  \n\n\nThis will result in all of the images being pasted into Word, which you can then manipulate as you normally would.\n\nA: It is not clear what alternative you are wanting besides those two options, but you might add a smart folder somewhere that filters by kind \"image\" which would let you insert image from file that is sort of like a photo browser. \nAlternatively there is a very old tip (like 2008) in this Mac OSX Hints thread that says you should be able to add folders to the media browser by dragging them from the finder into the media browser window. I have no idea if this still works. \n\nA: While far less than perfect, one of the suggestions above  worked for me on a MacBook Pro with OS 10.11.2 & MS Word for Mac 2011 (ver. 14.5.8, the latest as of December, 2015):\nWORK-AROUND PROCEDURE:\nFirst put any photos that you wish to use in Word documents in a folder (or folders) in Finder.\nNext, open a Word document; then, go to MEMU > INSERT, Photo Browser (open, and leave it open, displayed on monitor)\nThen, drag the folder (or folders) into the upper section of the Photo Browser window. (The images in a selected folder should appear in the lower window.)\nNext, drag am image into the Word document. \nAfter this, one can leave the folders in place and add or delete files as needs change. Also, can add more folders. The browser accepted folders, but not images unless they were in a folder.\nThis is a very cumbersome task, but is a \"work around.\" For the life of me I cannot understand why Apple did such a thing. Hopefully, they will correct this serious problem in a soon-coming update.\n\nA: The TextEdit method worked for me, but only after changing a setting from plain text to rich text format (RTFD).  Only then could I attach the images. \nSo if you're stymied, that's something to try.\n", "Q: At every launch Mail.app welcomes me and downloads my messages Every time I launch Mail.app it shows the (first launch) Welcome dialog and tells me that to use new feature sin Mail it has to download my messages.

I use smart playlists in iTunes.  For example: Play only songs rated 4 stars or higher with comments containing \"mellow\" (I use comments as tags, more or less, so that would be a mellow best-of playlist).\nThe problem: let's say I'm listening to that playlist and a song starts to play which I decide to drop to 2 stars.  The song disappears from the playlist instantly and the playlist stops.  What I'd like to happen is, I'd like the song to finish playing and then, after, have the rating change take effect, so that it disappears from the playlist after it finishes playing.\nNote: I'm talking about the currently playing iTunes song, not the currently selected song.  Since iTunes is probably in the background, the currently selected song could be anything.\nI'd prefer an Applescript solution, if possible.\nIdeas?\n\nA: with timeout of 600 seconds\n    tell application \"iTunes\"\n        set cur to current track\n        repeat until current track is not cur\n            delay 1\n        end repeat\n        set rating of cur to 40 -- 2 stars\n    end tell\nend timeout\n\nThis would select the next track and set the rating of the previous track to two stars:\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    set cur to current track\n    next track\n    set rating of cur to 40\nend tell\n\n", "Q: To control default opening software for PDF centrally? I want PDF documents open with Preview, not Adobe Reader.\nI select Open With > Other > Click the Box Always Open With.\nHowever, this does affect all pdf-files in my system.\nHow can you set the default program for PDF?\n\nA: In the Get Info window for any PDF, there should be a section called Open With.

System configuration\nI'm working with a MacBook 2,16 GHz (13\" white with the max. 3 GB RAM from about 2007) and \"Snowleopard\" OS 10.6.8.\nThe problem: performance\nAfter a while, the MacBook becomes incredibly slow and unresponsive, because Safari and the Safari Web Content process use all available RAM.\nAt the moment, e. g. Safari Web Content uses >1,4 GB physical RAM.\nSure, I also have a lot of other Applications open, but normally Safari seems to be the one that regularly uses most of the RAM.\nVirtual memory might be an issue - the System partition with OS X is 100 GB in size, after a reboot I have about 17 GB free drive space, at the moment there are 12.7 GB free drive space.\nI admit, that I sometimes have several windows with maybe 10..20 Tabs open in Safari, but it is very difficult to avoid that for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*When the MacBook gets unresponsive, I'm often using the purge command in terminal, which helps for a short while but not for a long time\n\n*Closing Safari and starting fresh also helps (but is annoying)\n\n*Restarting the Mac also helps, but I do not want to do that each day - I usually do it every 5..12 days.\n\n\nA: Many websites have auto-play flash.\nDisable it in Safari, and you will be prompted to play them if you click on it.\nSet Adobe Flash to ASK!\n\nThat way all the unwonted one wont eat up your memory.\n", "Q: How to find out which Safari tab is using massive memory? As described in my other question, Safari on OS X 10.6. is causing me massive problems (with my way of working like having many tabs in Safari open for a long time).\nI just realized that after closing some (few!) of the many open tabs, instantly\n\n\n*\n\n*it became quiet - the cooling fan of the macbook was not spinning any more\n\n*and I had >1 GB more free RAM (which is a lot, as I have only 3 GB in total)!!\n\n\nIt seems, that like very often in real life, Pareto's law applies:\n20% of my open tabs might consume 80% of the ressources!\nSo my question: \n\n\n*\n\n*is there a way to identify those few tabs which cause safari to consume hardware ressources like crazy without closing them - maybe by analyzing the Safari Web Content process?\n\n\nA: Open the Activity monitor in Utility folder.\n\nSort by name\nView by memory usage\n\nYou should see individual Safari pages memory consumption.\n\nBy hovering pointer over one will show the web site name.\nThe memory consumption will depend on the web site it self, its design, the complexity, and multimedia usage.\n", "Q: Open Safari Push Notifications in Chrome I got used to Safari Push Notifications, because they will show up even when Safari itself is closed.\nIn the last time, I changed to Chrome and now, when I click on a notification, Safari will always open.\nIs it possible to config the Safari Push Notifications in that way that that will open the specific website in Chrome?\nSome Information about my environment:\n- MacBook Air 3,2 (End 2010)\n- OS X 10.9.2\n- Chrome is default browser\nThank you!\n\nA: Unfortunately, I don't think this is possible. \nSafari's push notifications are specific to Safari, and so cannot be configured to open in Chrome. It's a part of individual apps and their implementation of the push notification system.\nYou haven't specified which Apple OS you are using, but I can talking from my experience of iOS. I don't know if push notifications are a thing in OSX.\n\nA: Change the Default Browser to chrome and that should work :0\n", "Q: I have a service listening on a port, how do I open the port externally?

Since ipfw is deprecated, probably just delete the file and reboot.\n\nA: It turns out that this issue was cased by a network problem. The two computers couldn't reach eachother. So there was no problem with the firewalls or so.\n", "Q: Homebrew and existent software in /usr/local Is it ok to install homebrew in default(for homebrew) deirectory /usr/local if I've already have installed software there.\nIn other words, if Mysql and GPGTool already installed in /usr/local and then I'll install homebrew also in /usr/local. Will it work correct or I should install homebrew in another directory.\nP.S.: I know that homebrew has mysql but I need special version that already installed.\n\nA: It would probably work ok to mix the two, but to be safe I'd just put homebrew in a different directory.  You might run into conflicting files, perhaps in some supporting library.\nI don't know what's special about your mysql build, but i'm sure homebrew has options to build different flavors.  do \"brew options mysql\" to see what is available, perhaps it has what you need.\n", "Q: How to reset iPhone to factory settings from computer if screen doesn't work? I dropped the phone and the screen is not responding. \nBefore I take it to get it fixed I want to restore the iPhone to factory settings because I'm logged in on my apps, and I don't want the person fixing the phone to get access to my Facebook and other accounts. \nI tried to turn it on again but the screen is not responding. \nHow can I reset my iPhone from computer if the screen doesn't work?\n\nA: Indeed, placing the iPhone into recovery mode, then connecting to iTunes and restoring will do the trick. Here's an Apple-provided article on how to place the iPhone in recovery mode: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1808\nMake sure you use the official Apple to USB lightning connector when attempting this recovery process. I tried several non-apple cables and I was unable to follow the recovery process and generated errors in the recovery process. As soon as i used an official Apple cable - no issue. \n\nA: Another, less destructive option relies on you having an iCloud account assigned with the phone.\nSimply visit the iCloud website, and follow the links for the Find My iPhone app. Once there, you have the option to lock your phone.\nThis means that the furthest anyone could get when replacing the screen is the unlock screen and that you don't have to go through the hassle of restoring from backups.\n\nA: Connect the phone to your computer, open iTunes, hit restore.\nIf the phone is code-protected put it into DFU-Mode first. http://www.iclarified.com/entry/?enid=1034\n", "Q: This disk is your os x startup disk and appears to have been partitioned by another utility I had Windows 7 installed via Bootcamp but I messed things up when I tried to install Ubuntu as a third OS.

Welcome to the Wonderful World of Macintosh Computing... sigh.\nProbably your best bet is to back up your Mac and Windows data (if not already) and boot the Mac from the COMMAND-R keyboard shortcut and wipe and reinstall from scratch. Your Ubuntu installer has gone and done some things to the partition table that Apple doesn't like and it is likely not going to be recoverable easily.\nYou could likely haunt the Ubuntu forums as I am sure this has been done and CAN be done. Heck there might even be someone around these parts with that experience.  But if you need the Mac back up and running ASAP the quickest way might just be to repartition and start from scratch.\n", "Q: Disabling the trackpad from the command line How can I disable the trackpad (without restarting my computer) from the command-line on OS X Mavericks?\n\nA: Try to use the following Code\nsudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleUSBMultitouch.kext/\n\nA: The following commands have the same effect as checking the \"Ignore built-in trackpad when mouse or wireless trackpad is present\" option in the Accessibility panel of System Preferences:\n$ defaults write com.apple.AppleMultitouchTrackpad USBMouseStopsTrackpad 1\n$ defaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad USBMouseStopsTrackpad 1\n\nTo re-enable the trackpad:\n$ defaults write com.apple.AppleMultitouchTrackpad USBMouseStopsTrackpad 0\n$ defaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad USBMouseStopsTrackpad 0\n\n\nA: You can disable your trackpad when an external mouse/trackpad is present:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT3608\nFor whatever reason you'd wish to disable your trackpad, even if no other device is attached:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/606338/unix-terminal-how-to-disable-trackpad\n", "Q: Xcode Update SDK to 10.9 I ran the update for Mavericks as well as the Xcode 5.1 update (build 5B130a) and I can't find a way to update my OS X SDK from 10.8 to 10.9 (The only updates that show up are iOS SDK 6.1 and the docsets).\nI was looking forward to using Sprite Kit on my Macbook Pro (10.9.2), but the SDK just does not show up.

When I delete a message on the iPad or iPhone, the message is NOT deleted on the gmail server. So the message is still in my Apple Mail box on my OSX Lion Mac. The Mac Mail uses IMAP, so when I delete a message on the Mac, it IS deleted from the gmail server and the iPad and iPhone do not show the deleted message on their next update.\n     How do I implement this \"Mac is master\" with the iPad and iPhone on iOS 7.1? I have tried enabling POP on the gmail server and told it to keep mail on the server's inbox. But  deleting on the iPad POP client still deletes the message from the server and it's no longer available on my IMAP Mac.\nI'm following instructions from \"https://support.google.com/mail/topic/3398031?hl=en&ref_topic=3396281\" in the POP section. Am I missing something? Or is it just not possible anymore?\n\nA: Go to your devices settings. Select \"mail, contacts, calendar\" > add account \nThen choose \"other\" (NOT GMAIL!)\nYou will then be able to enter all the stuff manually and choose between imap and pop\n", "Q: Export Keynote to PowerPoint in high resolution When I take a Keynote (5.3 or 6.0) presentation with images (all pasted PDF files), then export the presentation to a PowerPoint presentation, all of the images become severely degraded. For reference, the original PDf files are on the order of 100KB, so I don't believe they are particularly large…\nIs there a way to change this behavior? Having to copy each image over by hand greatly reduces the utility of the export feature. Is there possibly some Terminal command that I can set to make the exports high-quality? I need to export this in PPT so that my advisor can edit the file. \nCross-posted from Apple Discussions here.\nEDIT\nThough this question (How to not compress inserted pictures in Powerpoint 2011) seems related, my presentation images are degraded the very first time I open the exported presentation, and viewing the presentation does not improve the resolution.\n\nA: As there doesn't seem to be any way to make PowerPoint handle vector graphics, the only solution is to export the image to the correctly sized PDF image (essentially treating it the same way one might work with a raster image). \nWhile this is incredibly dissatisfying, it does result in a PPT presentation with unpixelated images… \n\nA: Ok - here is my workaround. Export Keynote as PDF. In Acrobat Pro - export your PDF as Powerpoint. Worked surprisingly well and all vector graphics remain vector.\n", "Q: How can I get all my open TextEdit documents back? I have a bad habit of having zillions of open documents in TextEdit, containing brief notes that I've made. Most of these are unsaved, so they have titles like \"Untitled 67\".\nUsually this isn't a problem, because if my Macbook crashes and reboots, TextEdit restores its state, and the unsaved files are not lost. However, just now I rebooted on purpose, and TextEdit gave me a dialogue asking if I wanted to quit with unsaved changes. I clicked \"save and quit\" (or words to that effect) and my machine rebooted.\nUnfortunately, upon re-opening TextEdit, there are no longer any documents open. The \"Recent documents\" menu has only ten entries, but I had well over fifty open before I quit.\nHow can I get these \"untitled\" files back? Ideally I would like to restore the state of TextEdit, so that they will still be open windows (I close them once the issue has been dealt with), but if I can at least get back the one called \"Untitled 8\" it would be a big help. Since I did click \"save and quit\" I would hope it would be saved somewhere, but where?\nThe answers to Unsaved Files in OS X Lion suggest that the unsaved files can be found in ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Autosave Information/. However, on my system that folder is empty. In any case, manually messing around in ~/Library doesn't seem like the right solution to this problem, and strikes me as a recipe for disaster. If I could find the autosave files I could copy them somewhere else, but then they wouldn't be unsaved files anymore, and it would all get a bit confusing. Given what most users would expect from \"save and quit\", I'm hoping there will be a more \"official\" way to get these documents back.\nI'm using Mountain Lion if it makes any difference.\n\nA: I searched in Spotlight as well, using the term “Untitled” and reopened all the Rich Text Format documents from iCloud. Yes, it was unnerving that these are all in the cloud but I am grateful that I was able to recover them all. And now I have the task of saving 120 untitled docs!\n\nA: I just had the same problem - crashed my Mac running Mojave 10.14.6, and re-opening TextEdit did not re-open the many files I had open at the time of the crash. The answer was to replace this file: ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Saved Application State\nUsing Time Machine to replace that file with a version from before the crash, and then opening TextEdit, re-opened all my previously open files.\n", "Q: Adding page numbers and running head to a pdf file I have several documents that I need to combine into a single pdf.

I used to love FileHippo.com for keeping a lot of my well-loved tools on Windows up to date with its tool that you could check to scan your current program versions (both freeware and paid - in the case of paid it still works to download the latest installer as your license is still located in the system - I assume it would work for Mac too), and a simple repository on the site to directly download the new updater installer files from once the results screen online shows you what you can download and update.\nCommon apps monitored by FileHippo would be VLC, uTorrent, Firefox, Chrome (all the way up to dev channel), CCleaner, Adobe Reader, Adobe Air, DivX, Safari, Skype, Thunderbird - and all these apps I now have on the Mac too.\nIs there anything like this for the OS X world?\nMacUpdate.com looks great, but it doesn't seem to officially offer an equivalent 'update checker' app from looking at its website.\nAnd as for Apple's Mac App Store solution, that doesn't cover the apps I listed above so could not be considered an adequate solution, unless all those players unanimously participated in that ecosystem which I don't think is the case.\n\nA: Coincidentally, FileHippo isn't necessary for the vast majority of those apps you listed. Tons of Mac OS X apps use a framework called Sparkle for self updating.\nDon't download Sparkle, it won't do you any good. It's a developer tool intended to be added as part of the application's code. The point is that Sparkle (or some other self-updater) is already part of the application.\n\n\n*\n\n*VLC self-updates via Sparkle\n\n*I'm fairly certain uTorrent does (I'm a Transmission guy, personally, which also self-updates via Sparkle)\n\n*Firefox/Thunderbird each have their own self-updaters possibly written by Mozilla\n\n*Adobe has their own software updater framework\n\n*Skype self updates though I don't remember the process\n\n*and Safari updates come from Software Update/Mac App Store.\n\n\nI don't personally know about CCleaner, DivX.\nThese apps \"phone home\" when you open them in order to determine if there is an update or not. If there is, you get a nice little dialog prompting you whether you want to update or not, and there is usually also a changelog to inform you of what's changed.\n\nIf you let it take it's course, the process begins:\n\n\n\n\nAnd then you're done.\nYes, this is only one app at a time, but it only happens when you use it, which really is preferable IMO. Things that update versions automatically out from under you can really throw you off. At least with this process you know when it's happened.\n\nA: I think Mac Informer Client is a good alternative.\n\nA: Since the advent of The App Store, sites like osx.iusethis.com and apps like AppFresh have gone the way of the Dodo (although much of iusethis is still available according to a cursory googling: iusethis.luo.ma)\nSteer clear of MacUpdate Desktop (sound reasoning).\nApp Checkers™ are and always will be dubious. Especially on the Apple platforms for reasons stated by Jason (namely Sparkle Framework popularity and the officiation of an App Store).\nBut so far, as stated by Saeed, the Mac Informer desktop app seems to serve the same utility its' predecessors and the Filehippo checker.\n", "Q: Reconfiguring Ctrl on a MacBook Pro's keyboard to another key I have a problem with the left ⇧ and ctrl on my MacBook Pro (mid 2012).\nI can use the right ⇧ but since there's only one ctrl, I was wondering because there are two ⌥ buttons and two ⌘ buttons, if I could reconfigure one of them to replace the control feature.\nIs there a way to do this?\n\nA: Install KeyRemap4MacBook, save a file like this as ~/Library/Application Support/KeyRemap4MacBook/private.xml:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n  <item>\n    <name>test</name>\n    <identifier>test</identifier>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::OPTION_R, KeyCode::CONTROL_R</autogen>\n  </item>\n</root>\n\nThen open the KeyRemap4MacBook application, press the ReloadXML button, and enable the setting.\n", "Q: Does anyone know any good Diagnostic tools?

So while it may seem like a good idea to try to find a really generalized and versatile hardware diagnostics app, you'll probably be better off with getting smaller more specialized apps that are designed to only check one to a few of your system's hardware components.\nIn addition, some hardware components such as your system's PSU (power supply unit) are best checked with specialized electrical equipment designed to check for faults in your PSU, such as your PSU is no longer capable of sustaining the level of Watts your system requires.\nHardware Health Diagnostic Applications\n\nHard-Disk/Solid-State Drive\n\n\n*\n\n*SMARTReporter\n\n\n*\n\n*User Interface is kinda compact (feels a bit overwhelming with everything squished together).\n\n*$4.99\n\n*Available in the App Store.\n\n\n*smartmontools\n\n\n*\n\n*primarily command-line only, GUI depends on the X Server,but even if you do have XQuartz installed, GUI doesn't show up.

Hold the keys down until your computer restarts: release the keys after you hear the second startup sound.\n\n\n*Hold Alt down during startup\n\n\n*\n\n*This will load the boot menu allowing you to boot to a different operating system partition you may have installed on your hard drive.  May also allow you to boot to a USB, but that's just a conjecture.\n\n\n*Hold down N during startup\n\n\n*\n\n*if your setup includes a compatible network server (NetBoot), you can hold down the said key during boot to attempt a network boot.  You can alternatively use the Alt+N keys during startup to start from a NetBoot server using the default boot image provided.\n\n\n*Hold down T during startup\n\n\n*\n\n*puts your Mac into Target Disk Mode, effectively turning your computer into a large removable flash drive.

Handy for advanced startup sequence troubleshooting.\n\n\n\nAlso, I'd check out Parted Magic and GParted, as well as any other distribution of Linux that offers a Live-disc version.  These can be used to ease the diagnostics process since they're (at least Parted Magic and GParted) are designed with system maintenance in mind--not to mention the fact that you'll have access to a far larger software repository with any given Linux (that has a package manager) than you would with brew, for example. \n\nA: You can access Apple Hardware Test or Apple Diagnostics by restarting the computer while holding down D\nYou mentioned Tech Tool Pro, which I haven't used for like a decade, but it was pretty good back then.

Nvidia has many updates for its drivers that Apple doesn't always include with OS updates.\nP.s. It helps sometimes to know what HW/SW setup you have for questions like this so helpers can be more specific on top of the general info.\nFinally, as an anecdote, the vast (did I say vast?) majority of major Mac failures in my work have been GPU related.

I would like to delete several sheets in the file but every time I do, Excel freezes and I have to force the application to quit. I am extremely limited in what I can do with this file.\nThis is being a huge problem for me as this file contains data for my research. What would you advise me to do?\n\nA: According to this Excel Specifications, it is not the file size, and it is only limited by available memory.\nI would suggest you run the Error check in Excel, to find out the errors in you spread sheet that might be causing the lock up.\n\nA: I've actually had this problem using excel.  In my case it was tons of calculations.  So, many in fact, that the available memory on my iMac basically froze.  What I ended up doing was to create 2 spreadsheets, one with all the data, and the other with all the data summarized.\nA secondary solution, might be to quit all other apps, except excel.  Allowing more memory to be available for the spreadsheet calculations.\nIn my case, I'm was using an older iMac, Late 2006.  After I increased the memory, to the maximum, 3GB from 1GB, that seemed to provide so relief.\nBest of luck. \n\nA: The largest part of the size of a workbook lies in formatting, not data.\nIf you can, remove all formatting from all cells. Save, and check how big the file size is. \nNow you can continue.\n\nA: When you say Excel freezes is there a chance that it is just trying to do what you are asking but taking a really long time? Excel is quite bad about giving feedback; it can be working away furiously doing something but the UI just appears to have frozen. Check Activity Monitor, does Excel appear to be using a large amount of CPU? If you run something like sudo opensnoop | grep Excel in a Terminal window do you see it furiously writing to/reading from files?\nAlternatively, I've had a lot of success using LibreOffice to work with files that Excel has trouble with. It typically takes longer to perform most operations, but can work with some files that Excel crashes on.\nSo my suggestions are (1) try again but leave it for a longer time before killing it and (2) try opening the spreadsheet in LibreOffice and deleting the tabs there instead.\n\nA: Have you tried opening the file in Google Sheets? You can create a Google Chrome account, and open your workbook using Google Sheets which uses the cloud so your data should be visible and you can edit your sheet. When you're done you can then download your changes from Google sheets onto your desktop which will convert it to an Excel workbook again. See if that works.\n", "Q: Xcode keyboard shortcut for scrolling down both cursor and line How can I define a keyboard shortcut in Xcode to scroll down both the cursor and the line? \nIn Xcode's key bindings terms, this would be equivalent to performing \"Scroll Line Down (Scrolling)\" followed by \"Move Down (Selection)\".

Recently, I decided to move a series of lists I keep in the Notes app (Groceries, Shopping, Movies to Watch, Local Bands we follow, Local Restaurants we like, etc.) to a Dropbox folder that I share with my wife on her Android phone, which is an excellent way to keep files in sync on all my devices.  However, I quickly discovered the drawback - I can no longer add content using Siri to those notes!\nI've started searching for ways to hack-in some sort of syncing, or even appending, content in specific notes to text files in Dropbox.  So far, every way I've investigated has drawbacks.  There are launchd/Lingon solutions, really hacky Applescript folder actions (forcing file updates by deleting & replacing files), one-way appending using cron jobs & applescripts, etc..\nWhether I use dropbox or some other content sharing management system - I would still have the same issue of not being able to tell siri to add stuff to the files...  Plus, the solution would have to work offline because we get no internet access in the Grocery store and various other places where we'd like to access the notes.\nAnyone have a reliable straight-forward way to sync the content of Notes with text files in Dropbox?\nThanks,\nRob\n\nA: I do not think that it is possible.

Recently, I ran into a problem with the Apple Calendar app on my laptop. In Fantastical, the calendars displayed correctly on both iOS, my laptop, and my work iMac. The only inconsistent place was my laptop. \nSo, I went into ~/Library/Calendars and and removed \"Calendar Cache\". This had the side-effect of completely removing my iCloud, Google, and Facebook calendars. When I go to the accounts pref pane, I see that my iCloud calendars are enabled, but in the accounts menu item on Calendar, it is not. So, I added it back, but after signing into iCloud is a success, it still fails to appear in the left-hand calendars menu, or in the Accounts menu item. \nThough the calendars side-bar does display my Google and Facebook account, it does not display the calendars within those accounts.\nWhat could be going on?

I migrated from primarily a PC desktop to a Macbook Pro, and with that, brought along 10+ years of digital photos. On my PC, I had each 'event' grouped into sub-folder by date, so that worked out well importing into iPhoto-- but I also had iCloud setup on my PC, and it was syncing my Photostream (into just one big folder, with 1800+ photos). Bringing this over to iPhoto I now have \"one event\" named Photostream that has all these photos. Is there any way to have iPhoto just automatically group these by date into new events?\n\nA: In iPhoto > Preferences > General there is an option \"Autosplit into Events\" that you can set. \nIf all you are seeing is the one Photostream event, I'd guess that it isn't finished importing and it will split the events when it is done.\nI don't have a photostream event in my events in iPhoto, I just have an iCloud tab that is on the same level in the sidebar as Events.\n\nA: I found it! If you select the \"big event\" in \"Events\" view, then go to the menu, \"Events\" -> \"Autosplit Selected Events\" it will automagically split the one event into the many events.\n", "Q: How to add a quick-launch icon in my Dock for a program I've downloaded? I've downloaded jmeter and put it in my Applications folder.\nI've made it executable.\nI can cd to /Applications/apache-jmeter-2.11/bin and can run it in a terminal with \n$ ./jmeter\n\nor by double-clicking the icon from the finder.\nHow can I add the program as a shortcut (icon) on the main application icon launcher bar ('Dock') on a Mac, similar to programs such as browsers, MS Outlook, gitx, etc?\n\nA: You can use AppleScript to make a .app file for this (That is the only file type that can go in the left side of the dock). It is in /Applications/Utilities/AppleScript Editor and when you make a new file you can put in do shell script \"/Applications/apache-jmeter-2.11/bin/jmeter\". I do this all the time for shell scripts, so I can access them easily. Then you can save and choose \"app\" near the bottom of the Save sheet. This will create an app file that you can put in, say, the folder above bin which can be dragged into the Dock. \n\ntell app \"Terminal\"\n    activate\n    do script \"/Applications/apache-jmeter-2.11/bin/jmeter\"\nend\n\nis what you will need if jmeter writes to the terminal. \n\nA: When you launch it does it show an icon in the dock? If not it may be a command line program that is running inside terminal. If that is the case there are ways to make an Applescript/Automator wrap-around that will launch command line applications that should give you a dock icon.\nHaving never done this myself, however, I am afraid you will have to do some googling, but hopefully this points you in the right direction.\n\nA: Somewhat copied from: Executing Shell Scripts from the OS X Dock\nThe following creates a running application that doesn't need to spawn the terminal to work.  Do something like the following from the command line:\nname='JMeter Launcher'\napppath='/Applications/apache-jmeter-2.11/bin/jmeter'\nmkdir -p \"/Applications/$name.app/Contents/MacOS\"\ncat > \"/Applications/$name.app/Contents/MacOS/$name\" <<EOF\n#!/bin/sh\n$apppath\nEOF\nchmod +x \"/Applications/$name.app/Contents/MacOS/$name\"\n\nThis will create a clickable application that when run will execute the shell script with the same name which will run your jmeter binary.\nNotice that the JMeter Launcher name must match the .app top directory name and the script name down in MacOS directory precisely which is why this script stores it in a variable.\nAlso, if you want to change the icon, you can select the application in the Finder, get info about it, select the default icon at the top of the info window, and paste a 512×512 PNG image over it.\n\nA: Such binaries can't be added to the left side of the Dock where applications are stored.\nAdd it to the right side of the Dock instead\nRight of the separator:\n\n", "Q: Quick Look a URL via a script (Applescript, Automator, Shell…)?

I use Mac's Notes app on my MacBook Air (Mavericks).  I can readily search for any specific note just using command - F.  \nIt finds notes containing the string of text either in the title of the note or in the body of the note.  \nHowever, when I sync all my notes to my iPhone 5c, I can't find how to search for a particular note in this way.  Is it possible?\n\nA: Drag down on the home screen (just touch in the middle of the icons and drag down) and the iPhone search box will appear.

This is a bug.\n\nSome criticism at the end: As a long time Apple user I always preferred the instant feedback and GUI refresh of macOS as opposed to Windows, where you had and still have to do a lot of manual refreshing & more burdens/precaution for the user due to a lack of cross process sync/awareness (i.e. renaming a file in Explorer while it is open in another app, will cause you problems, still in 2016).\nInstant cross process interaction of all stock apps and all apps using standard frameworks is what's so fine on the Mac, i.e. Re-enabling a network interface and Safari automatically loads the content of an idle browser tab, Renaming a file in Finder while it was opened hassle free, Changing an icon and its updated in every view instance (Finder, file dialog of apps, icon in app's title bar), etc.\nHate to see these qualities vanishing. Apple clearly neglects its professional Mac users over its iOS users and their Cloud services.

Ever since I upgraded my 2009 iMac to Mavericks, I often get a message stating 'The name of your computer \"Foo\" is already in use on this network. The name has been changed to \"Foo (2)\".'. The number at the end will continuously increment over time as the same error keeps happening.\nIt is trivial enough to rename the computer back, but is there a way to prevent this from happening in future? I had an old Macbook Pro (running Mountain Lion) that had the same issue, but my early 2013 MBP running Mavericks doesn't seem to be suffering from this issue.\n\nA: Are you using two network devices that are on the same LAN? For example, wifi and wired ethernet? Try disabling one of them. I used to have that problem and fixed it this way.\n\nA: Workaround\nLike other users, I'm plagued by this annoyance but have found a semi-satisfactory workaround:\nmy_hostname='your-hostname-here'; for key in LocalHostName ComputerName  HostName  ; do sudo scutil --set $key $my_hostname; done\n\nAfter running this command, you can check that all places where they store hostname are the same with this one-liner:\nfor key in LocalHostName ComputerName  HostName  ; do sudo scutil --get $key; done\n\nIf the Macbook keeps immediately renaming ComputerName back with a suffix, you may be able to make it stop by turning off Wake for Network Access.\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences→Energy Saver→Wake for Wi-Fi network access → Unchecked\nOnce off, rename your machine using the commands above to finish.  You may also try forcing ComputerName back by using the System Preferences→Sharing→Computer Name text field preference.\nIf this did not help, try flushing your mDNS cache:\n# El Capitan (10.11) and later\n#   check if you have dscacheutil command with: which dscacheutil\nsudo dscacheutil -flushcache\n\n# Yosemite (10.10) and ealier\n#   check if you have discoveryutil command with: which discoveryutil\nsudo discoveryutil mdnsflushcache\nsudo discoveryutil mdnsrestartquestions\nsudo discoveryutil mdnsrestartregistrations\nsudo discoveryutil udnsflushcache\nsudo discoveryutil udnsrestartquestions\n\nAfter flushing mDNS cache, retry renaming your machine using the commands above.\nIf this still did not work, try killing the mDNSResponder service:\nsudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\n\nThen, retry again to reset your computer name using above scutil commands.\nIf you find that none of this is doing any good, there are some other reported solutions which include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure you have only one connection to the local network\n\n*Turn Bonjour off and back on\n# Yosemite (10.10) (and other versions with discoveryd?)\n# Check for discoveryd with:  ps auxww | grep -i discoveryd\nsudo killall discoveryd\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.discoveryd.plist\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.discoveryd.plist\n\n# Mac OS versions without discoveryd\n# Check for mDNSResponder with:  ps auxww | grep -i mDNSResponder\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist\n\n\n*Shut down and reset ALL networking hardware\nProblem Discussion\nIn my experience, setting the hostname this way, or through the standard System Preferences→Sharing→Computer Name only lasts a short period of time.  This is usually < 24 hours, but sometimes the ComputerName even changes immediately to have a suffixed number in parentheses (N).  I've observed this number to immediately be set to either (4) or (5) recently after using the scutil --set commands above.\nThe cause of this behavior is due to some daemon code running in Mac OS which attempts to add a numbered suffix (N) any time that the same hostname is found on the network.  In ALL of my testing, the hostnames I've chosen have NEVER been used before on the network and additionally had NEVER been used for any Bluetooth devices as well.\nThe true cause of the \"trigger\" of this behavior is unknown and unverified.  That is to say: Through all my research online and testing I have not been able to determine definitively why Mac OS decides that the name is already in use when it clearly is NOT and never has been.\nMy theory is that somehow mDNS also known as Bonjour (Avahi to Linux users, or Zero-conf Networking to Windows users) may be partly to blame.  Somehow, the prior hostname of the Macbook or Apple device gets persisted somewhere in mDNS, or perhaps some form of ARP table + hostname information which is discovered and stored by the Macbook or Apple device.  This could be some kind of race condition.  Somehow the entry is seen as duplicate and triggers the Mac OS suffix renaming behavior.\nThe number suffixed hostnames are visible when using the Apple provided DNS Service Discovery utility dns-sd:\nFor example, using hostname my-mbp-hostname, it might show up like the following entries\ndns-sd -Z _ssh._tcp\n; To direct clients to browse a different domain, substitute that domain in place of '@'\nlb._dns-sd._udp                                 PTR     @\n\n; In the list of services below, the SRV records will typically reference dot-local Multicast DNS names.\n; When transferring this zone file data to your unicast DNS server, you'll need to replace those dot-local\n; names with the correct fully-qualified (unicast) domain name of the target host offering the service.\n\n_ssh._tcp                                       PTR     my-mbp-hostname\\032(5)._ssh._tcp\nmy-mbp-hostname\\032(5)._ssh._tcp                           SRV     0 0 22 my-mbp-hostname.local. ; Replace with unicast FQDN of target host\nmy-mbp-hostname\\032(5)._ssh._tcp                           TXT     \"\"\n\n[...SNIP...]\n[...OTHER SSH HOSTS HERE...]\n[...SNIP...]\n\nThe theory of the true cause is unconfirmed as it's difficult to find and observe what is actually happening without access to internal Mac OS state & low level Apple OS debugging tools.  The interactions between mdnsd, mDNSResponder, and mDNSResponderHelper with other Mac OS services or even other Avahi daemons on the network are not well documented or easily observable.  The current state of some forms of network discovery can be viewed through dns-sd and arp -a or perhaps arp -a -n.  Other theories or potential places where this hostname information may be stored could be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bluetooth device names persisted by the OS somewhere\n\n*SMB (windows file share) info cached from network periodically by smbd (/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.smbd.plist)\n\n*AFP share info cached from network (also presumably by smbd?)\n\n*mDNS / Avahi reflector (or other type of re-broadcast of Bonjour / zero-conf packets on the network by a router or some other device)?\n\n\n*\n\n*Could be cached by mDNSResponder or mdnsd (/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist)\n\n\n\nSolution (placeholder)\nAs of October 6th 2017, there is still no full solution from Apple or remedy to prevent this problem from reoccurring.  I recommend filing a Bug Report with Apple describing this issue.  You may also wish to contact Apple Customer Support.\nThe more people that make noise about this annoying issue, the faster Apple Product Managers will prioritize so Engineers will be able to fix it.\nDebugging / Future Lines of Investigation\nThis MacRumors Forum Discussion has some useful information as well as adding a theory that Wake for Wi-Fi Network Access and device Wake / Sleep has something to do with this issue.  Other theories presented have to do with using multiple network adapters (e.g.: WiFi + Thunderbolt Ethernet), routers that have multiple Access Points advertised on multiple bands such as on 802.11 b/g/n (2.4GHz) or 802.11 a/ac (5GHz).  These combinations may cause a \"ghost\" version of the Apple device to show up on the network somehow temporarily, triggering the renaming behavior.\nThere were no useful log lines in /var/log/system.log that appeared related to this renaming behavior being triggered.  Supposedly mDNSResponder can be configured to higher log levels:\n\n\n*\n\n*Error - Error messages\n\n*Warning - Client-initiated operations\n\n*Notice - Sleep proxy operations\n\n*Info - Informational messages\n\n\nHow to set these debug levels other than perhaps through non-existent file /Library/Preferences/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist was not clear.  I did not have a plist example config to use, so I was unable to get any extra logging info out of mDNSResponder.\nTools such as Wireshark could be useful to show mDNS packets being broadcast on the network along with other potentially relevant ARP packet info among other traffic.\nOn Mac OS, other tools such as dscacheutil may exist to view this information. It's not well documented or clear how to view the definitive cache of this information which is used by the hostname renaming code. When I tested this utility, it did not produce any useful output except when using query mode for the exact hostname (IPs scrubbed for privacy):\nsudo dscacheutil -cachedump -entries host\nUnable to get details from the cache node\nsudo dscacheutil -cachedump\nUnable to get details from the cache node\ndscacheutil -cachedump\nUnable to get details from the cache node\ndscacheutil -cachedump -entries host\nUnable to get details from the cache node\n\ndscacheutil -q host -a name my-mbp-hostname.local\nname: my-mbp-hostname.local\nipv6_address: fe80:4::1a:1234:abcd:ef01\nipv6_address: 2601:280:1b00:1234:567:abcd:ef01:1234\n\nname: my-mbp-hostname.local\nip_address: 192.168.1.123\n\n\nA: Same problem here.  But is seems that the foo (2) name is accepted by time machine and it still does the backup to the same place (it doesn't seem to redo the whole backup, it continues).  So no harm no foul.  I think that it is related to multiple active interfaces, I popped up the ethernet to speed up my backup.\n\nA: There is no good way to stop this. Apple would have to replace the code for the host name so that users (people and programs) are always presented with the host name that is set by scutil and do all the renaming/translation under the hood.\nSince this has been going on across all Apple product lines (Apple TV, iPhone, Mac and presumably even the Apple Watch) since 2012 at least, it's not clear that Apple sees this as a problem to be fixed or fen one to help us all out by writing a KB article to explain common DNS / mdns / DHCP setups that cause this.\n\nA: This is probably to do with the user who is active when you join the network and set up the machine for the first time. It is probable that when you are building these machines you are always doing so as the same user\nIf you create a user eg dave on, for example a MacBook Pro,the machine will auto-config the naming as follows:\nComputer Name: dave's MacBook Pro\nlocal hostname: daves-MacBook-Pro.local\nand in Terminal, the hostname will show as: daves-mbp\nAssuming the next machine you log into as 'dave' is also a MacBook Pro, it will set exactly the same details -  you connect to the network and you get the message about the duplicate name.\nWhere I work we change the name in Sharing then open a terminal and run the following command:\nsudo scutil –-set HostName new_hostname\n(where new_hostname is your chosen name)\nThen exit and restart terminal and you will see the new hostname.\nYou will also get this issue when migrating users to new machines - the migration assistant/time Machine will rename the new machine\nsome typically weak info on names - http://support.apple.com/kb/PH13790\n\nA: This occurs when running two overlapping DHCP servers. If you are using more than one router (bridge-mode) then make sure only one of them is running DHCP without a static IP.\n", "Q: Can I install Mavericks side by side with an existing installation? My current installation of Mavericks has some issues that can only be fixed with a clean install (no Time Machine restore).\nHowever I don't find time to do the complete reinstall in one session and I still have to work with the current installation.\nNow my idea was to install the OS just parallel to the existing Mavericks once more. I have already shrunk my partition (see image). But I fear the second installation will kill my current one if I now just reboot and select to install Mavericks.\nAny comments/solutions?\n\n\nA: Yes, you can install OSX onto any eligible partition or external drive and are not constrained to simply apply it on the running OS. \nDownload the installer and choose any destination when it prompts you to install over the running OS. \nI prefer this in almost all instances since I can run the migration to my new OS without ever losing my current setup or wiping a system that is currently in use. It only costs disk space and one extra step when installing. \n\nA: If you have a time machine backup you can just wipe the drive, reinstall mavericks and restore from the backup.

If I want to manage the music/video manually I also get this message. What can I do? The data on my iPhone should stay. I only want to add something ...\nPS: Does it mean that my backup made with iTunes will not work?\n\nA: If you never synced the iPhone with your PC/Mac, you cannot manually add songs without first deleting the iPhone (I am 99% sure about this). \nYou can use third party iTunes alternatives (i.e. CopyTrans Manager for PC and Sharepod for Mac to add songs to the iPhone without the need to sync with iTunes.\n\nA: I use iTools program (exists for Mac and Windows) to copy my MP3 files to my iOS device without completely synchronizing my music library. No existing files will be deleted, just new files will be added.\n\nA: Music can't be synced in the direction of iphone to mac (this has been this way for iPods since day one to prevent piracy). \nThere are several apps (like phoneview) that allow you to copy the music from an iPhone to your drive. \nSongs that were purchased via iTunes can simply be downloaded again using the same account. \n\nA: Make a backup before you do this. My solution was the following:\n-Select the following option: Manually manage videos/Music\n-Sync and delete\n-Add music to the iPhone via iTunes\nThe sync refers to the music library. If you have music on your iPhone it will be deleted (except it is already synched with your iTunes library). Because I had no music on it that wasn't a problem.

I'm using OSX Mavericks \n\nA: I think you have a problem with opening http://localhost ?\nIf I'm right you should check your httpd.conf:\nLook for: Listen 80 <- This line should not be commented and make sure 80 is written ( when you write localhost into your browser, the browser checks the 80 port on default.\n)\nIf it's 80 then check your if your server root folder is OK:\nMust be where the --prefix folder is : normally under /usr/local/apache2.x.x\nThen you should check that the DocumentRoot points to the right folder (where your index.html is located if no index.html is present)\n\nA: Maybe the server command you use is running of a different port.\nJust typing in http://localhost will only work if the port is set to 80.\nTry: sudo php -S localhost:80 to run a PHP server of port 80, the downside of this is that you'll have to run it as root. It's also possible not to run this as root but to configure servers on ports lower than 1240, OS X always needs admin privilege.\nThe command php -S localhost:8000 will run without root but you'll have to type in http://localhost:8000 to get the webbrowser to display your server's contents.\n", "Q: What is the technical reason why OS X can't write to NTFS devices? Mac OS X can't write to a hard drive with the NTFS format. It can, however, read it.\nWhy can't it write to it?\nMy basic understanding is that a file format dictates how is data stored and retrieved in a device. So, the key to working with a storage device is to know the rules for data storage and retrieval.\nSince OS X is able to read devices with the NTFS format, obviously OS X knows such rules. What exactly stops OS X from following the necessary rules to write data to an NTFS device? It knows that it is NTFS (just do Get Info), so I see no reason why it can't do this.\n\nA: OS X can write to NTFS volumes.  However, it's a hidden switch, and it's not supported.  Use it at your own risk.\nOS-level support for a file system is a major technical investment.  It's not just about knowing the rules.  There are fundamental differences between HFS+ and NTFS, such as characters supported in the name and maximum file size.  When writing an OS, not to mention applications, it's very easy to make assumptions in your code that rely on the expected file system.  \nReading a file from a different file system is significantly easier than writing a file to a different file system.  In only reading a file, there is very little chance of data loss.  In writing a file, it is imperative that the act of writing the file does not lose data (either in the file that you are writing, or other files on the disk).  \nSupporting another file system means that there is a massive expense to the OS development and test teams.  If you take a look at this comparison of file systems, you can see many places where these two file systems differ.  Without official support for NTFS, the safest assumption is that it hasn't been sufficiently tested and might not support all of the features of NTFS.  \n", "Q: Battery lasts a month on an iPad? iMac power supply died, and I decided to replace instead of fix.

Up to today using Trello with Fluid was the best thing of my day! Super awesome match between the two apps. The most best part was that when I scale the fluid window to be narrow all Trello lists lined up vertically one below another, which is so much better when you are working on one swim lane at a time. This way I can focus only on the cards inside a particular line. Very very helpful! Trello is great to give you the big picture (the board) and lets you narrow down your focus to the small piece (the card), but it's lacking a middle ground (focus on a list). This is where Fluid brought Trello to a whole other level. \nSince today this is no longer an option. Even when I make the Fluid window to has the smallest width the Trello board still scrolls left right up down all over the place...\nIs there a way to get this back?

If you have access to an Apple store, you can just bring it in and try it on any of their Macs there.

I have been having problems with my iCloud account not syncing properly with my iOS devices, so I wanted to reinstall the iCloud account.\nThe first thing that I wanted to do was to remove my old iCloud account, which worked for everything except for Mail.\nWhen I try to deactivate the iCloud mail setting, it says:\n\niCloud Mail couldn’t be disabled from the iCloud Preference Pane.\nOpen Mail and remove your iCloud account from Mail preferences.\n\nHowever, when I do that, Mail does not have an iCloud account, so it cannot be removed.\nHere is what I have tried till now, without success:\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried to add the iCloud mail account into mail.app so that I could remove it.\n\n*\n\n*Adding the account “worked”, as in it didn't fail, however the account still does not show up on my list of accounts, and so still cannot be removed.\n\n\n*I have restarted my computer\n\n*\n\n*I didn't expect this to work, and it didn't.\n\n\n*I have repaired disk permissions.\n\n*\n\n*There were a few errors (aren't there always??), but this didn't help.\n\n\n*I have searched the web for others having the same problem.\n\n*\n\n*I didn't find anyone with the same issue, nor did workarounds for other similar issues help.\n\n\n\nIn response to the comment on the question. I have a lot of (almost 6000) 'ACL found but not expected' messages. I have been led to believe by various internet searches that these are harmless.\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but since it was one of the first hits on a google search I thought it could use an answer that worked for me. I had a similar problem to this - I had a duplicate of my iCloud account that I couldn't remove, and I received the same message about having to delete the account in system preferences. Deleting the account from there didn't seem to help, so I was searching for possible solutions, and an answer to a similar question put me on the right track. You can see my description of the fix on that post (How to remove 'phantom' iCloud account from Apple Mail) , but I'll repeat it here:\nFirst, I logged out of iCloud in system preferences, and let it delete all the relevant local copies of iCloud data.\nNext, go to the Library folder in finder. You can do this by holding 'option' and clicking the 'Go' item in the menu bar, then selecting Library.\nIn this folder, go to a folder called Mail. In this folder, you'll find Mail/V2/. In Mail/V2/ there are a number of folders corresponding to the accounts you have added in Mail. It's easy to tell which is which. There's also a folder called MailData - I'm using Yosemite, and the folder MIGHT have a different name/structure in other versions, but regardless of version you should be able to find a file called Accounts.plist.\nFirst I deleted the folders that corresponded to the accounts I wanted to purge. Next, I opened Accounts.plist in a text editor – it doesn't matter which one you use, but your life will be slightly easier if your editor of choice can highlight matching tags in xml type files.\nThe part you're looking for begins with the following:\n<key>MailAccounts</key>\n<array>\n\nThe next thing you'll see is a <dict> tag. This is the beginning of an individual account 'object'; all information for each account will be between <dict> and </dict> tags. Find the 'block' that seems to correspond to the account you don't want, and delete everything from the <dict> to the </dict>, including the tags themselves. Be careful though, because there's another set of tags nested inside containing info about the vendor of your email account - you want to be sure you're selecting the matched outer pair.\nHaving done this, I was able to load up Mail again, and the unwanted accounts were gone. The remaining accounts were working fine. I then went back to the iCloud preference pane, logged into my account again, and checked the box for Mail – it worked, and I now have a fully functional iCloud mail account, and no duplicates.\n", "Q: Mac keyboard on powered hub does not work initially I have a strange problem with my powered USB hub (USB 2.0) and my wired Apple keyboard which is plugged into that hub.\nWhen I turn on the MacBook Pro (Early 2013), running OS X 10.9, the external keyboard is not working sometimes. As soon as I unplug the keyboard and plug it in again it works. This only happens when the MacBook has just turned on.\nIf I turn the powered hub to an unpowered hub (just by unplugging the power chord) the keyboard works fine - even at startup.\nDoes anyone have a clue what may be the problem?\n\nA: You should try using the keyboard extension cable that comes with your keyboard.

Looking closer at the files in the TM directory it seems that a file has consistently been getting, an perhaps continues to get, the wrong group ownership. Perhaps other file permissions are corrupt too preventing the restore operation from completing.\nMy next step was to try to change the ownership to be the same as its sibling files. This is something I've done before to successfully restore from TM at occasions when similar problems occurred. In this case though no matter what I tried I got the same error, Operation not permitted. Not even sudo touch is permitted in the directory. Perhaps this is by design.\nBelow is a listing of some files in the TM directory in question, with extended attributes and ACLs displayed. At the bottom is the problem file, called problem_group_file.png.\n$ ls -aehlO@\ntotal 26184\ndrwxr-xr-x@ 134 seron  staff  -  4,4K 12 Mar 09:41 ./\ncom.apple.metadata:_kTimeMachineNewestSnapshot    50B \ncom.apple.metadata:_kTimeMachineOldestSnapshot    50B \n 0: group:everyone deny add_file,delete,add_subdirectory,delete_child,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\ndrwxr-xr-x@   4 seron  staff  -  136B 29 Jul  2013 ../\ncom.apple.metadata:_kTimeMachineNewestSnapshot    50B \ncom.apple.metadata:_kTimeMachineOldestSnapshot    50B \n 0: group:everyone deny\n\n...\n\n-rw-r--r--@ 6 seron  staff  -  4,8K 10 Okt 14:37 good_group_file.png\n    com.apple.metadata:_kTimeMachineNewestSnapshot    50B \n    com.apple.metadata:_kTimeMachineOldestSnapshot    50B \n 0: group:everyone deny write,delete,append,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\nadd_file,delete,add_subdirectory,delete_child,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\n-rw-r--r--@ 4 seron  wheel  -  3,2K 10 Okt 13:29 problem_group_file.png\ncom.apple.metadata:_kTimeMachineNewestSnapshot    50B \ncom.apple.metadata:_kTimeMachineOldestSnapshot    50B \n 0: group:everyone deny write,delete,append,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\n\nI've read[1] that the file may be locked with the uchg extended attribute, but this does not seem to be so in this case.\nAt the bottom of each file attribute list is the ACL. I haven't used those before and don't understand how they work. Perhaps it is the cause of these problems.\nThe TM disk was checked without errors in Disk Utility. This problem appears on more than one TM disk which leads me to believe that it's not a TM disk error. The problem is manifested on multiple TM disks and backups. On the source side they all have the same (and correct) attributes and ownership sans ACLs. Disk Utility found attribute errors on the source disk, but only on files belonging to OS X, and not this file. All partitions are hfs+ journaled.\n\nA: Reading up a bit on ACLs[1] I found that I could change ownership by first removing the file ACL with the following commands:\nsudo chmod -a \"everyone deny write,delete,append,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\" problem_group_file.png\nsudo chown :staff problem_group_file.png\n\nAfter that the directory could be restored from TimeMachine backup without errors. This doesn't however explain why the problem occurred in the first place.\n\nA: Based on seron's answer I was able to come up with the following solution:\nBackground\nACLs are rule based and the first rule to match is the rule that defines how a request for chown is handled. There can be more than one rule and the rules are ordered. ls -le problem_group_file.png will list all ACL rules for that file.\nIn TimeMachine every file seems to have an ACL rule like this:\n 0: group:everyone deny write,delete,append,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\n\nThat means as soon as a user who's in the group everyone tries to modify the file in any way, the ACL mechanism will prevent it.\nThe ACL rules are all modified via chmod's a command. The command can be used with various different modifiers (see below).\nSolution\nTo allow chown for the admin (or for some other specifically named user) the following command can be used:\nchmod +a# 0 \"admin allow chown\" problem_group_file.png\n\nAfterwards (in case of admin) a sudo chown will work.\nThe +a# 0 parameters tell chmod to insert (via +) the rule before (via # 0) the first rule. That means rule 0 will then be rule 1 and the new rule will be rule 0.\nAfter chmod was run, it is safe (and simple) to remove this rule via:\nchmod -a# 0 problem_group_file.png\n\nThis will remove (via -) the rule at index 0.\n", "Q: What is the difference between `brew` and `brew cask`?

I've been using Windows since the 80's.  A month ago I got a Mac for a side project I'm working on.  Despite my best efforts, I haven't gotten used to the fact that the menu bar of windows aren't attached to the window and instead are on top of the screen.  Also haven't gotten used to the close/minimize/maximize buttons being on the left.  \nIf this were Linux, I could change that and have it look and behave like Windows. Is there a way I can do it on a Mac?  Either by downloading and installing a program, or through some preferences modifications?\n\nA: Way back in the OS 9 days, we could install hacks to do crazy things like recolour windows and move around those window controls, but now they are simply buried too close to the metal to do system-wide. Back in those days too many of these hacks would cause system instability. I'm sure Apple could have built in such customization cleanly in OS X, and indeed in the very early versions I recall some rudimentary functionality for \"skinning\" — but today having a consistent user interface is viewed by the company as a feature, not a liability.\nI found this article with a fairly nice summary of utilities that bring some of the best features of windows to OS X. But unfortunately (fortunately?) adding extra menu bar clutter to every single window or moving the window controls isn't one of them.\n\nA: There is MenuEverywhere, which adds a menu like this on top of windows:\n\nIt's not really usable in my opinion though. It looks a bit glitchy when you move or resize a window, and sometimes the menu does not appear at all. It doesn't remove OS X's normal menu bar. If a window is at the top of a screen, the menu is shown over the title bar. It also adds the menu over full screen windows in applications that use custom full screen windows.\nIf you want easier access to the menu bar, you can press command-? to select menu items by searching. You can press control-F2/fn-control-F2 or command-? to move focus to the menu bar.\n", "Q: Hidden files in archives When I download any archive file and unpack it, it looks good, but if I copy it to usb stick or lan drive, windows clients see copy of each file with a dot in name. Looks like it's a mac os' system files. How can I disable it? I really don't want to have it in unpacked archives.\nMavericks 10.9.2\n\nA: You can prevent .DS_Store creation with Asepsis.\n\nAt core Asepsis provides a dynamic library DesktopServicesPrivWrapper which gets loaded into every process linking against DesktopServicesPriv.framework. It interposes some libc calls used by DesktopServicesPriv to access .DS_Store files. Interposed functions detect paths talking about .DS_Store files and redirect them into a special prefix folder. This seems to be transparent to DesktopServicesPriv.\n\nAs for ._AppleDouble and other such files (including .DS_Store), you can use BlueHarvest. This lets you provide a folder which the app will clean of such files/folders:\n\nPerhaps you need to clean a disk, folder immediately? No problem, simply control-click the disk or folder in the Finder and select “Clean using BlueHarvest”. If your sending zip archives to non Mac users do the same and BlueHarvest will remove the Mac metadata from the archive too. BlueHarvest's \"set and forget\" preferences are very simple and yet extremely powerful.\n\n", "Q: How can I get Homebrew working under Mavericks?

In summary, it seems you just have old software installed (and perhaps extraneous directories in your PATH) and need to clear it out, check your permissions, and reinstall homebrew from scratch.\n\nA: I'd recommend to start from\nbrew doctor\n\nwhich should point you at potential problems and tells you how to address them.\n", "Q: Calls from and to my iPhone 4 I can make and receive phone calls from everyone and anyone except for my boyfriend.

Numerous other devices are connected to the same network (2 MacBooks, iPhone and LG Nexus). The network doesn't display in available networks list, but I can see all other WiFi networks available from neighbours. I have tried following things already:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart iMac\n\n*Restart WiFi router\n\n*Add new 'location' in network settings\n\n*Change radio channels in my router\n\n*Manually input network SSID, security type and password (it keeps telling me that network with this name doesn't exist)\n\n\nThe iMac sits very close to the router and other devices work flawlessly in the same place. What's worth mentioning is that this behaviour was sudden, that is everything as working fine until it suddenly stopped.\nI'd appreciate any help!\n\nA: I had same problem with my Mac Mini. I changed network's name and Mac Mini recognized new network. It meant that issue was only with my Mac. I \"forgot\" this network \n(Settings -> Network -> WiFi -> Advanced (OS X 10.10.3), selected missing network and removed it from Preferred Networks) \nand connected to my network.\n\nA: I had the same problem, suddenly. Solution? I opened the list of saved networks and removed it, it appeared in the list of networks in range immediately.\n\nA: I changed the channel on my router to \"auto-select\" and it fixed the problem. Ran diagnostics on my iMac and it found \"Crowded Wi-Fi Chanel\" so this may be the case for you too. Try changing the channel on router or do auto select.\n\nA: Can you see it if you boot from the recovery partition? Try booting while holding down Command-R. \nOnce booted, try to connect to the Wifi.\nIf you can see it in Recovery mode, then it's probably a corrupt system file or cache. If you still can't see it in Recovery mode, I have no idea what the problem is.\n\nA: I know this is an old question - but i just encountered same problem. Some one else might, too.\nThis is what hit me: The iMac sits very close to the router\nIt's not good for RF devices to sit to close to each other for various reasons\nLong story short: I moved the WiFi AP away from mac (it was sitting at it's right side and now it's 2 meters behind it): problem solved.\n\nA: I have been having the same problem. Changing the name of the SSID fixes it immediately. But if I ever happen to switch off the router and switch it back on, the problem recurs and I have to think of yet another name.\n\nA: If only our MacBook is not seeing the WIFI, the issue may be the \"WIFI channel\". \nIf you have access to the router (usually by 192.168.0.1 etc, user name and password printed on the router), use your other devices to manually set the WiFi channel. Do not make it automatic, rather, set it to a small number, say 2.\nIf you do not have access to the router, you may try to reset your location. It is in the system preference -> language and region. Some location disabled certain channel of WiFi. Hope this could help.\n(My old MacBook Air suddenly cannot see my WiFi at my home after I come back China. It turns out my region is still US and US seems to only use channel 1-11, but the router in my home prefer channel 12 &13)\n\nA: I had a similar problem, Mac Mini would drop wifi intermittently and stop seeing the home network even though all my other devices were still connected and working. Restarting the router didn't fix it. Restarting the mac mini did fix it but obviously not an ideal solution. I discovered that if I went into network settings and chose Edit Locations from the Locations drop down, then created a \"Test\" location, all of a sudden the network was visible again. I could delete the Test location and it would still work on Automatic. This is still not an ideal solution if it turns out not to be a permanent fix for me, but may provide some pointers on cause.\n\nA: How about switching off your modem? I think I experienced the same thing - my iPhone and my Mac both began reporting failure on attempting to connect to my WiFi router (Airport Extreme, 2 or 3 years old). Lucky for me I have two Airport Expresses to extend my network, so I still had WiFi. Oddly, I found that one of them, which connects to my router only wirelessly, was still working; the other one was connected via Ethernet and was also fine. After seeing your post here, I aimed Wireless Diagnostics at the main router, but it wasn't able to \"diagnose\" because it couldn't connect. Trying Internet settings in various devices I got messages to the effect of \"this device has no IP address.\" So I think I may have been having the same problem as you. I recently updated to OS X 10.9.2, but don't know whether that caused the problem. After re-booting all devices & computers, no joy. So I shut things down and did one step you don't list above: I not only unplugged power from the router but also switched off the modem. Left everything off while I started cooking dinner. After about ten minutes I first switched the modem back on, then waited a few minutes and plugged the power cord back into the router. When I restarted the computers and i-devices, everything was fine. Did you try that step of switching off the modem?\n\nA: I have a similar problem with a bit of a work around.. I'm not sure if it works for others and I'm also trying to understand it myself because it is a bit annoying.\nMy laptop will always see my wifi network but sometimes my wife's MacAir or my moms Samsung tablet will suddenly not be able to see the network. By freak luck I discovered that turning on and then off the MAC filter fixes this problem.\nFrom my laptop, I type in (192.168.1.1) to access my modem and under the wireless settings, I activate and immediately deactivate the MAC filter and then hit save. (If I wait more than 3 seconds to deactivate the MAC filter, then my laptop will not connect and I have to use another device to access the modem settings so be sure to do it quickly.) When I hit save, all devices will be able to see the network.\nBut this only lasts until the next day, especially with my mom's tablet. With my wife's it can last months before having to do it. It's a workaround for me but pretty annoying.\n\nA: My mav wasnt able to recognize and wifi networks. The fix is easy. \nHold power until late it powers off. Turn it on and when the apple appears on the screen hols shift. It will reboot your computer. Once the computer turns back on you'll be able to see the WiFi networks in range. \n\nA: My MB Air suddenly wasn't recognising any wifi networks but the reboot with shift key solution above worked for me\n\nA: Had similar problem. After resetting the router, the SSID went invisible on my macbook pro, but was visible on my android device. I tried rebooting both laptop and router, and also tried connecting to the network as a hidden network with no success. Finally, after I went into the router settings and changed the SSID, it fixed the problem and the new SSID was immediately visible.\n\nA: I've tried many of the given solutions but they didnt work. I accidentally discovered that if you log in to your phone hotspot that miraculously your home Wi-Fi network appears on the list, after which you can connect to it.\n\nA: Had this problem recently\nHere's what worked for me on macOS Mojave\nSummary: Create new \"Location\", switch to it for a few minutes, then switch back to \"Automatic\" location\n\n\n*\n\n*Sysprefs -> Network -> Wifi\n\n*Edit Locations (Drop down menu at top of network prefspane)\n\n*Create new location, \"TEST\" or call it whatever you want\n\n*Apply\n\n\nCount to 60. This is more superstition than anything else.\nSwitch back to \"Automatic\"\nWiFi SSID should show up again, even to the point of reconnecting automatically. \n", "Q: Weird Permissions/ Sandboxing issue: installer.app is not entitled for system.install.apple There is a serious ownership/ permissions/ entitlements fault in my 10.7 install. \nWhat happened:\n1) After swapping the stock drive for an Intel SSD of the same size in my Mac Mini 1,2 (2006 -ish?), I performed a clean install of 10.7 via target disk mode; That is, I put the mini into TDM and mounted it via FW400 to my iMac which I booted using a 10.7 install USB drive.\n2) The install went smooth and the machine boots by itself as expected all the way to the desktop.\n3) I try to install the 10.7.5 combo update via Software Update, it fails due to bad checksum. \n4) Knowing I get corrupt downloads from several CDNs (incl.

This is a bit of a weird question, I'll admit, but this is something that really annoys me. I have come to rely on the Emacs shortcuts (mainly ctrl ^+A, ctrl ^+E, ctrl ^+B, and ctrl ^+F) and the behavior of ctrl ^+P and ctrl ^+N is very different than in Emacs. With Emacs, going up a line will ignore soft wrapping and go to the next actual line, not the next displayed line. I've just gotten used to it, I guess.

You can then mirror your iPad's screen to your Mac, and record it there.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reflector is $12.99\n\n*AirServer is $14.99\n\n*X-Mirage is $16.00\n\n\nCheck them out, and work out which one is best for you.\nEDIT:\nX-Mirage has a 7-day free trial, so I think it's the closest you'll get to a \"free\" solution.\n\nA: To record your iPad's screen, you could use QuickTime X that comes for free with OS X Yosemite and OS X El Capitan.\nUnfortunately your iPad must be running iOS 8 or later for this to work.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPad to your computer (with the 30 pin or Lightning connector)\n\n*Open QuickTime Player, usually found in the \"Utilities\" folder of the Applications folder\n\n*Click File > New Movie Recording\n\n*From beside the red \"record\" button click the source arrow \n\n*Choose your device and click record!\n\n\n(Image from ioshacker.com)\n\nA: I don't know of a free option. There are products like X-Mirage (USD 16), which lets you record your device via AirPlay. This is probably the most hassle-free and cheap solution. \nYou can also buy an HDMI adapter from Apple, or some third party version, and record your gameplay that way using e.g. an HDD-recorder with HDMI input. For this solution you obviously need quite a bit of hardware.\n\nA: Wait a few more weeks until OS X Yosemite is released. \nIn Yosemite it's possible to record your iOS screen with QuickTime when you've connected your device with an USB cable..\n\nA: I think you should just get a different type of device flip the camera and record while the other device is playing games?\n\nA: Although this solution is not technically free, it is a long term solution. You can buy an adapter to stream live whatever is on your iPad screen to your Mac screen. Then using a PC screen recorder system to record the \"livestream\" footage. There is free screen recording software out there. Software such as CamStudio and TinyTake offer pretty decent recording options for free, and extra if you pay for it.\n\nA: Get  airshou. Here's the link cherryroad.xyz/airshou. To use it just click record, choose your orientation and quality, hit next and swipe up from the bottom of your screen. Then click AirPlay and press AirShou. Wait a few seconds, and the recording starts\n\nA: emu4ios.com...install then find iRec and click install and begin \n\nA: Just go to camera and click the buttion flip camera! If this doesnt work I dont know what will because seriously I dont have an iPad and I have no clue om how to use it\n\nA: Download irec\nIt will help you record and it is quick free and easy xx :3\n\nA: Just use another mobile to record ur iOS screen as I also have same problem \n", "Q: Broken Safari: Dom Exception 18 I've just tried everything and I cannot seem to fix this for the life of me.\nBasically, Safari has started reporting the following error in the JS console: \"SecurityError: DOM Exception 18: An attempt was made to break through the security policy of the user agent.\"  Most of Ajax interactions via https are not working, so I cannot log into Twitter, Facebook or even Apple's own Developer Center.\nI've tried installing Webkit, and even removing all preferences files that I'm aware of.\nOther local browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Opera...) work just fine.

I want to upgrade to Mavericks and do a clean install of both Mavericks and Windows 7 in Boot Camp - reformat the internal HD and repartition.\nI need a solution for backing up my Windows user files - documents, some apps if possible - but I don't need an actual image of my old partition. I did pick up a copy of Winclone and I'm running it, but the backup process is incredibly slow.

I know the two filesystems are different, so it cannot be as simple as simply dragging the files from the Boot Camp partition to my external 3TB Seagate?\n\nA: Any Windows Backup software of your choice. Altho you then might have to reinstall windows before you can restore the files themself.\n\nA: Perhaps the easiest way to back up files is to create a Windows partition (Fat, NTFS, or ExFat) on your back-up drive.  Then simply copy the files you wish to save into that patition.\nBe careful when using backup software made for Windows.  Most are not designed for use on a disk which was not formatted using Windows.\nOne of the more popular Windows backup programs, Acronis True-Image, doesn't even work on boot-camp.  At least I couldn't get the 2011 version to work.\n", "Q: Change of default behaviour when connecting to external display: mirror mode Some OS generations back the default behavior when a new display was attached was that the screen was mirrored. \nI would like to get this behavior back since without it I have to fiddle with the system settings every time I want to give a presentation, since the projector I am connecting with is new to the OS and I have to set up everything.\nSo question: Is there a plist or something that I can change once and for all?\n\nA: Just press ⌘ + F1 after connecting the display to your Mac and your screen will mirror.\nps. you might have to press fn as well.

Usually my mates only use a single application (e.g. Safari). In order to make my pc private (to me only) I want to disable the GUI and all the other ways through which someone can interact with my system. What I want is that they just have access to the single application they want to use and I want to disable the top context menu shown in the attached picture. Also, I want to disable the dock items and also the right click functionality.\nHow can I accomplish this on OS X?\n \n\nA: The closest I can think of in your case is to go to System Preferences > Parental Control and create a new account (or use the “Guest” account). Then, set the following restrictions (my OS is not in English, so the exact terms might be different):\nUnder Apps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use simplified Finder\n\n*Restrict applications, only checking Safari from the list.\n\n\nUnder Other:\n\n\n*\n\n*Prevent password change\n\n\nThen, log with the new account. Clean up whatever right-hand menu item you don’t want your friend to access by holding command while drag-and-dropping them out of the menu bar. Launch Safari (from the Apps folder in the dock) and log out without quitting Safari.\nYou might want to put Safari in fullscreen mode, but then it won’t appear on the first screen when people log in, they’d have to click its icon in the dock.\n\nIf you want to launch apps or scripts at startup, or if you want to edit any account preference, you can do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log into the controlled account\n\n*Inside the Finder, select Use the complete Finder under the Finder menu. The system asks for an administrator login/password.\n\n*Open a new window, go to Applications and launch the System Preferences. Select the Allow once button, then type once again your login/password.\n\n*Go to the Users and Groups preferences pane.\n\n*Click the lock, and enter administrator login/password (one last time!)\n\n*You can now edit this user opening items. You could add Safari or whatever script you need this user to launch at startup.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can also create the controlled user, log in and setup the account to your liking, then log out and, from an administrator account, turn on parental control.\n\nA: You could create a separate account that friends remote logging in would connect to.  This account would be a standard account you would then turn on parental controls.  You can say to only use Safari and to prevent the dock from being modified.  \nHaving a standard account prevents any system modifications or browsing of your personal files. \nUsing this setting the user sees \nRight clicking on desktop is not allowed, and there is no access outside of the user's folder except to public folders.\nThere is no way to disable the menu bar, but because they have limited abilities, the most they can do is log out of the user account.\nThere is a round about way for them to access the system preferences but it only allows personal customization.  System settings are protected by admin username and password.\n(splash top is a driver that I had to let in to stop bugging me.  other programs can be allowed once or every time only with admin's user name and password).\n", "Q: Is Mac deployment controlled like the Apple iOS Developer Program does? I am beginner Apple developer.  I want to develop Mac and iOS software, but not for sale.  Only for personal use.\nAs I see to deploy my iOS program to my iPhone and my iPad I need to get iOS Developer Account.\nDo I need a Mac Developer Account if I am not planning to deploy my software to Mac Application Store and if I am planning to use it only in my Macbook?\n\nA: Without a Mac/iOS Developer account you won't:\n\n\n*\n\n*get access to OS X betas\n\n*be able to publish your apps on the Mac App Store\n\n*be able to code sign your OS X / iOS apps. \n\n\nCode signing is needed if you want to run apps with Gate Keeper enabled.\nThere is no discount if you enroll in both developer programs. \n\nA: Apple's developer accounts are unified, so there’s no difference if you want to develop for macOS or iOS or tvOS or watchOS. One fee gets you code signing for all and access to the paid stores if you wish.\nBefore the unification, If you were an iOS developer, nothing that you did on the iOS side changed when you subsequently enrolled for Mac development. \nThat being said, everyone can start with free Xcode and make an app for the shipping OS using the free SDK. You don't need to pay for a developer account until you need to sign code for other people or access pre-release SDK. Pay the money only when you hit a roadblock. Same goes for iOS, start free and only pay when you need to do something that the paid account allows. You can even run self signed code on iOS with a personal AppleID for personal testing before you become a paid developer.\n\nA: To develop for OSX you just need Xcode which is free from the app store.\nThere is also a free developers account which gives access to some more documentation - but I think that a paid for iOS account will get the same info.\nAs for iOS you could jailbreak you devices as an alternative to the account see \n\nA: No, it is not.\n\n\n*\n\n*You shouldn't have to worry about Gatekeeper with apps you build and run yourself. Xcode must be doing something behind the scenes, but I don't know what. Other people who try to run your app will get the warning, though.\n\n*All the documentation, etc. is free at https://developer.apple.com (except for some videos, which are not essential by any means). You will need Xcode, which you can get from the Mac App Store. (Be warned, it's a big download!)\n\n*If you want to submit apps to the App Store, or develop for iOS devices and install your app, you will need to get a paid subscription. (You can actually test your apps on your iOS devices without this, but they will expire after about a week.)\nAs the Xcode License Agreement says (as of 2017-09-24):\n\nA.

But review team has rejected with the following reason:\nReasons:\n\n2.3: Apps that do not perform as advertised by the developer will be rejected \nWe are writing to let you know that the App Review Board has\n  completed their review of your appeal and determined that this version\n  of your app is in violation of Guideline 2.3.  We have determined that\n  your application requires the user to download and install additional\n  software in order for the application to perform as advertised. \n  Applications should not require the user to install additional\n  software in order for the app to work. We will continue review of your\n  app with this in mind.\n\nI understood that users should not install additional software for the app to work, but need to know the possible ways to submit the app in Mac store to avail the Mac store benefits instead of releasing outside the Mac App Store. Your valuable suggestion would be helpful to make any design changes for this solution.\nUpdate:\nHere is what my Mac app design and technical flow :\n\n\n*\n\n*Product is actually used to store the documents on the Server and would use the documents for storage and cloud printing. I do have two options to send the documents to cloud :\n\n\na) Users can right click any document, pass it to Mac app to send the document to cloud server.\nb) I do have another option which is to send the documents from print option (ctrl+P), I would convert the documents as generic format to understand by cloud servers. This feature would bring more value to the users and I want to stick into this approach as well. \nUser can pass any document via document print function and mac driver files and few other supporting files will communicate to Mac app for further processing.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac App will show the list of uploaded files / status of each documents.\n\n\nWhy do you need the drivers in the first place?\nANS : Driver files have a lot of functionality on handling the document formats which would help on cloud, so I must have driver files in my architecture and based on my business requirement. \nCan't you integrate that functionality directly into your application? and what kind of research you have already done on the topic of bundling device drivers with App Store downloads (besides this post of course). \nANS : Yes, I have tried to integrate the driver files in the app itself, pushed to install in the /Users/System Name/Library/Printers/ folder as well and design works fine with no sanboxing.  After I enable Sanboxing, It does not do any user permission checks and system level updates because it will get user permissions to install drivers to list out on the documents print options. \nI have also tried splitting the driver installation as separate application and the actual Mac app as another application, for which the application has been rejected by the review team with the above mentioned reasons.\n\nA: Without recoding the app the meet Apple's guidelines, you will have to rely on selling your software outside the MAS. Plain and simple I'm afraid.\nThere is no way around Apple's guidelines. They are written for a reason; to protect users from having apps install malicious components or components that may damage their systems, to promoting an exceptional users experience. Having your app pull down drivers is not an ideal solution and I would not install such an app. Either make do with the existing driver set, or find a workaround that won't break your program.\nYou are the developer. You know the codebase and the requirements as an Mac Developer. There is no loophole. Either you are asking us to provide you with a way to circumvent Apple policy or tell you how to code your app. In both cases, it falls outside the scope of what we do around here.\n", "Q: Second hand Macbook and Find My Mac Quick question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bought a secondhand Macbook pro over ebay.\n\n*Seller told me \"I logged off from iCloud but forgot to turn off Find My Mac.\n\n*Bought it anyway since I do not plan using iCloud.\n\n*Now I got news that if he wants he can track and block my Mac.\n\n\nI have administrator account access, the EFI is not password protected since i asked him to wipe it out, so:\nCan I simply log in with my iCloud account to the Mac and disable Find My Mac?\nIt's not nice to know that somebody can \"track me\".\nMore info:\nThe seller formated the drive before sending it to me, when i turned it off i got to the first time installation wizard. There's no apple id associated to the macbook and the only user is the one i did create in the wizard and has no icloud account associated whatsoever.\nSo, is it even possible to log off from your icloud account without disabling \"find my mac\"?. i've read that the tokes for find my mac are stored in nvram and the recovery partition so a hard drive format is quite useless since the device would be still showing up in the \"find\" icloud account of the seller.\n\nA: Computers, phones, and devices that are not currently logged in with a given Apple ID and specifically with the service Find My Mac / Find My iPhone enabled will show up as \"Offline\" in someone's iCloud account etc.\nSo, basically, if both of you have the same computer in your iCloud accounts with Find My Mac, only the person who is currently logged in can track it. If neither of you are logged in no one can track it. The only way he could track it at this point is if you knew his Apple ID and password and went into System Preferences > iCloud and set-up Find My Mac for him. It is up to him if he wants to keep a line in his iCloud.com menu under Find My Mac that has the \"name\" of the computer that was retrieved the last time he tracked it that will perpetually search and always fail to find your computer, and just say \"Offline\". You can't change that for him. \nYou're safe. With the computer wiped, his user account isn't present, and that's where the iCloud account data is stored. You do not need to track your computer to \"block\" him from doing. It's just up to you if you want to track it at all for yourself. He will never know where it is again.\n\nA: Might be late for this. But if you reset the NVRAM holding the keys Command+Option+P+R immediately after turning the Mac on, Find my Mac is going to be turned off. Make sure you hear the \"startup chime\" at least twice to confirm the NVRAM has been reset :)\n\nA: This is not completely correct. You can put a new iCloud user and the old iCloud user can not track your Mac. But if you get access in partition recovery, the old user still are here and if in other moment he blocked your Mac, it will be blocked, or erased. \nIf you get access to recovery partition be sure turn off Wi-Fi. If you need reinstall OS X vía Wi-Fi can be dangerous.\n", "Q: Some questions about Time Machine I have two questions about Time Machine:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do I need an access to Time Capsule (or external hard drive) when I want to restore old version of file ?\n\n*If I understood correctly if I have turn on Time Machine, but doesn't connect the external hard drive (Time Capsule) to my macbook too long, all the changes in my file system must be logged on my macbook.  Is it right ?  I think they are take a much of disk space. Where they are stored (in which folder) ?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Some versions of files are stored temporarily locally, when you're away from the TimeCapsule. These are on your MacBook and can therefor be accessed without the TimeCapsule present. As soon as the Mac syncs back with the TimeCapsule, they are longer stored on your local drive, therefor you'll need a connection to the TimeCapsule to restore them.\n\n*\"Mobile Backups\" in the Library\nIt won't keep so much files forever, as it deletes some after a time.

Can I make any of the Prompt, Command, and Output different colors like this?\n\n\nA: There's a pretty exhaustive description of editing the bash prompt here there might be some linux specific stuff, but most of it is generic bash stuff.\nBut just for getting started, I recommend this bash profile generator\nIt is pretty simple, so I've since learned more and my prompt looks like:\n\nusing:\n[[ -s \"/Users/dwightk/.rvm/scripts/rvm\" ]] && source \"/Users/dwightk/.rvm/scripts/rvm\" # Load RVM into a shell session *as a function*\n\nfunction parse_git_branch {\ngit branch --no-color 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \\(.*\\)/(\\1)/'\n}\nexport PS1=\"  \\[\\033[01;35m\\]\\u@\\h:\\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\$(parse_git_branch) \\[\\033[01;32m\\]\\w \\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\n>\\[\\e[0m\\]\"\n\nwhich is pretty useful when dealing with git. Everything before the export PS1= is what enables the git branch to appear. \nThe  is from my first foray into bash prompt editing after I read this blog post. \n\nA: AFAIK there is no any UNIXy way to color anything else than the prompt.\nBut as you asked for an iTerm2 solution you are in luck! Use the Triggers feature to color text matching regexp.\nFor example if your prompts looks like this:\n\n..then add in iTerm -> Preferences -> Profiles -> Advanced -> Triggers , [Edit] a Trigger like this:\n\n..that will match the command part of each line, which will start to look like this:\n\nVoilà - you have different colors for prompt, command and output! :)\n\nA: The iTerm solution works but there seems to be a slight delay in the coloring. If one stops typing for a second, the whole line is colored as expected.\n\nA: Here's what worked for me. Try it and let me know.\nhttp://dobsondev.com/2014/02/21/customizing-your-terminal/\nThe approach involves adding some instructions to your bash profile.\n\nA: If you are using zsh you could do like this:\nAdd this code into your ~/.zshrc file\nautoload -Uz vcs_info\nprecmd() { vcs_info }\nprecmd_functions+=( precmd_ves_info)\nzstyle ':vcs_info:git:*' formats ':%b'\nPROMPT=' %F{040}%n%f at %F{166}%m%f in %F{031}${PWD/#$HOME/~}%f%F{magenta}${vcs_info_msg_0_}%f %# '\n\nThen reload your profile\nsource ~/.zshrc\n\nIt should look like this:\n\nI like this example because it shows a bit of how you can use colour codes or colour names\n", "Q: Backing up to an existing Time Machine sparsebundle I have been using OS X Mavericks Server Time Machine Backup service to backup my laptops.

It's also important to note that this will not work w/ mini discs, which should just never be put into a Mac's optical drive.\nAnother option (for installing the OS upgrade, not for getting the disc out), if you have access to another, functioning Mac, would be to use Disk Utility to make a disk image of the installer and save it to a flash drive or external disk that you can boot to and install (or maybe install from the Finder, but it's been a long time since 10.6 and I can't remember what would and wouldn't work back then).\n", "Q: Do OS-X app bundles always contain Info.plist - CFBundleExecutable? I wonder if OS-X app bundles always have a Info.plist - CFBundleExecutable configuration?\nThank you in advance for answers.\n\nA: Yes see Apple's documentation on bundle structure\nAn OSX Application bundle must contain an Info.plist and expects certain keys including CFBundleExecutable whose definition is \n\nThe name of the main executable file. This is the code that is executed when the user launches your application. Xcode typically sets the value of this key automatically at build time.\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Retina 2013 crashes on wake up I have late 2013 rMBP and very often it fails to wake up after closing the lid. It crashes and restarts.\nHow do I find out which process or application causes those failed attempts to wake up?\nI try reading the console logs, but I can't understand much from it. \nShould I look for something specific? Some other log file?\nHere's an excerpt from the console log, I opened the lid at 12:28\n4/10/14 06:15:08.000 kernel[0]: ARPT: 444887.011559: wl0: powerChange: *** BONJOUR/MDNS OFFLOADS ARE NOT RUNNING.\n4/10/14 06:15:08.000 kernel[0]: AppleCamIn::systemWakeCall - messageType = 0xE0000340\n4/10/14 06:15:08.544 com.apple.time[503]: Interval maximum value is 946100000 seconds (specified value: 9223372036854775807).\n4/10/14 06:15:08.547 com.apple.time[503]: Interval maximum value is 946100000 seconds (specified value: 9223372036854775807).\n\n4/10/14 12:28:51.000 bootlog[0]: BOOT_TIME 1397125731 0\n\n4/10/14 07:15:06.301 hidd[67]: MultitouchHID: device bootloaded\n4/10/14 07:15:06.572 airportd[81]: _doAutoJoin: Already associated to “Kromidarevo”.

the SMC.\n\nA: The issue is related to SafeSleep or SmartSleep on the OS. This system puts all your current memory (your RAM) onto the disk, so that it can power down the RAM, save energy, and keep the current working state of your computer, even if you ran out of battery power, changed batteries, etc.\nProblem is, it’s slow. And buggy. Often when waking from sleep by opening the lid, the MacBook will remain in sleep.\nOpen a Terminal window and type this command:\npmset -g | grep hibernatemode\n\nThat should return you something like “hibernatemode 3″.  Mode 3 keeps your RAM powered during sleep to allow super fast wake-up, but also writes an image file of all memory onto disk in case power is lost.\nTo change the hibernate safe sleep setting to not create an image file on the disk, i.e. mode 0 (mode zero, not the letter ‘o’), enter the following in a Terminal window:\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0\n\nEnter your password when asked to do so. This prevents Safe Sleep from saving your memory contents to disk, in large part the cause of not being able to wake MacBook’s from sleep.\n", "Q: enabling/disabling Internet Sharing with terminal in mac osx 10.9.2 The problem is setting the internet sharing with CLI instead of GUI in Mac OS 10.9.2\nI followed instructions as per this thread Start/stop internet sharing from a script? including both CLI and scripting the system pref app, but to no avail. Also tried the Sidekick  app (formerly NetworkLocation) and finding that it cannot set up internet sharing on its own.\nThis is the situation:\n\n\n*\n\n*CLI only launches internetsharing.plist file, while other things such as bootpd and natpmpd are not launched. I tried to make a copy-bootpd.plist file permanently resident in /etc but that doesn't seem to do any better.\n\n*I was already using a script originally, and the reason I switched to CLI was that GUI scripting of System Preferences is almost impossible in 10.9.2 as object names are not properly passed. Hence the same script will work or not work, depending on something I'll never find out.\n\n*Sidekick is unable to do more than start and run an app, while modifying the settings within the app still needs to be done by hand.\nQuestion: Is there someone out there who can pick every single event taking place when one checks internet sharing box in the sharing pref pane, and possibly suggest how to activate the same events with CLI?\n\nA: I was browsing the same thread you linked to and also found that none of the answers worked. However I was able to modify Philip Regan's solution to work with my Mac OS version (10.9.3).\nHere is the modified solution.\ntell application \"System Preferences\" to set current pane to pane \"com.apple.preferences.sharing\"\ndelay 1\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"System Preferences\"\n    click checkbox 1 of row 8 of table 1 of scroll area 1 of group 1 of window \"Sharing\" -- change to row 10 if you are using anything before Snow Leopard\n    delay 1\n    if (exists sheet 1 of window \"Sharing\") then\n        click button \"Start\" of sheet 1 of window \"Sharing\"\n    end if\nend tell\nignoring application responses\n    tell application \"System Preferences\" to quit\nend ignoring\n\nThis pertains to number 2 in your list... you might want to check out an app called \"Accessibility Inspector\". It was helpful in finding the new path to the particular GUI element this script modifies.\n", "Q: How can I force the application switcher to stop following the dock and instead show on my main display in Mavericks (OS X 10.9)? I understand the App Switcher follows the Dock. Other answers here confirm as much.\nHowever, is it possible via some hidden command-line preference to force the Application Switcher to display on the main display at all times? Whereas \"main display\" is the display in the System Preferences > Displays > Arrangement preference with the menu bar.\nI personally have my dock hidden on my left-most display, but even switching the dock position to the bottom is a hassle since it requires first launching the dock from the desired display before switching the app switcher's location.\n\nA: If you are OK with losing the new features of Maverick's multiple displays, open System Preferences, click Mission Control, the uncheck the box that says, \"Displays have separate spaces\". Log out, then log back in, the problem should be resolved.\n", "Q: How can I locate a stolen MacBook that didn't have Find My Mac turned on? My MacBook was stolen. Unfortunately, I didn't have Find My Mac turned on. Is there any way to track it's whereabouts so I can recover it?\n\nA: Without Find My Mac turned on via your iCloud account, you are going to have to rely on the kindness of strangers or local law enforcement to get it back.\nEdit:\nAnd my experience with a stolen computer was that even having Find My Mac enabled didn't help me get the computer back. The police would not use the location information to recover the computer. It is mostly for finding a lost computer or deleting your data so the thieves cannot gain access to your data. \n", "Q: Is it possible to disable cellular data use? If I buy the 250MB monthly data plan and share with my wife, but use WiFi for 98% of the monthly usage, will this work for us? We are retired and home all day.\nI keep hearing that the iPhone will use cellular data regardless of WiFi, can I keep this from happening?\n\nA: The iPhone will prefer Wi-Fi over Cellular data, so if you are connected to Wi-Fi your iPhone will use that connection instead of Cellular.\nTo completely disable Cellular data, go to Settings → Cellular and disable Cellular Data. This will prevent your device from using Cellular data at all.\n", "Q: Can't get WiFi Payloads to iPad using Apple Configurator I have 400 iPads I need to prep and am having a couple issues. I was hoping somebody could give me a bit of advice..\nQuestion\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I verify the WiFi payloads are copied to the iPad?\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Configurator 1.5\n\n*I received a backup config from the customer\n\n*I also received their settings in case the restore didn’t work.\n\n*Of the settings I’m concentrating on two to verify the restore worked, or a manual config and prepare worked. Those are verifying an app was installed, and wifi payloads.\n\n*When I restore using the supplied *.iosdevicebackup file neither the app or the wifi settings are on the iPad\n\n*I configured iTunes for the customers account -> downloaded the app -> imported into the Apps tab of the Configurator program and now get that loaded, but I can’t confirm the wifi payloads.\n\n*have 3 wifi payloads configured in the setup tab -> wifi section. 2 are for the customers wifi and the 3rd is for our in-house wifi just for sanity’s sake. Each are configured with ssid and WPA / password, but when the IPad is restarted after the prepare I would assume I would see all 3 networks and the iPad would connect to our in-house network automatically as it's the only one available. But I only see a list of available networks, and I’m asked for a password when I try to connect to our in-house one. I thought that was what the payload was for.\n\n*I also tried making a profile and setting the wifi payloads up there, same result.\n\n*I’ve been speaking with the local apple store, and while polite and professional, not much help..\n\n*When I try to do a manual prepare my settings -> Restore value is Don't resort backup.

I am diagnosing some mysterious network latency that comes and goes with my wife's MacBook Pro.\nAs part of this diagnostic work, I fired up Network Utility and used its interface to traceroute to trace the route to www.google.com.  Somewhat oddly, all of the results were of the * * * variety.\nSuspicious, I opened up traceroute directly from Terminal and issued traceroute www.google.com.  There was a * * * from the second hop (right after my 10.0.0.1 entry) but then everything flowed normally.\nI then eliminated DNS issues by using traceroute against the IP address directly.\nThis behavior happens on all Macs in our house, so it's not computer-specific.\nHere is the output from the command line (which worked):\ntraceroute to 173.194.33.116 (173.194.33.116), 64 hops max, 52 byte packets\n 1  10.0.0.1 (10.0.0.1)  115.994 ms  1.265 ms  1.816 ms\n 2  * * *\n 3  te-5-2-ur02.bremerton.wa.seattle.comcast.net (68.87.205.57)  14.209 ms  12.736 ms  11.514 ms\n 4  ae-22-0-ar03.seattle.wa.seattle.comcast.net (69.139.164.153)  18.753 ms  14.804 ms  15.076 ms\n 5  he-1-4-0-0-10-cr01.seattle.wa.ibone.comcast.net (68.86.94.237)  19.233 ms\n    he-1-7-0-0-10-cr01.seattle.wa.ibone.comcast.net (68.86.91.165)  18.523 ms\n    he-1-12-0-0-10-cr01.seattle.wa.ibone.comcast.net (68.86.93.173)  16.625 ms\n 6  he-0-11-0-1-pe04.seattle.wa.ibone.comcast.net (68.86.85.38)  15.435 ms  21.009 ms  14.535 ms\n 7  23.30.207.2 (23.30.207.2)  16.739 ms  14.500 ms  15.909 ms\n 8  209.85.249.34 (209.85.249.34)  16.002 ms  17.200 ms  16.781 ms\n 9  209.85.244.63 (209.85.244.63)  15.472 ms  17.927 ms  15.836 ms\n10  sea09s16-in-f20.1e100.net (173.194.33.116)  15.860 ms  27.057 ms  16.399 ms\n\nAnd here is the output from Network Utility:\n\nLeaving aside the &)$(*^#& problem that I'm actually trying to solve, what would account for why the two traceroute invocations would produce different output?

You can use the -I flag to get the same behaviour on the command line:\ntraceroute -I 173.194.33.116\n\nI don't know of any way to force Network Utility to use UDP.\nOne explanation for this could be that your firewall/router is configured to block ICMP packets.\n", "Q: What's the best adhesive to use when reattaching an iPhone 5 home button? I've carried out a couple of repairs on my iPhone 5 over the last fortnight, including replacing the screen. I detached the home button from its mounting in the original screen, and placed it in the new screen. It works fine, but I need to glue it to the contact that it sits on top of. What glue does Apple use to do this? Where can I buy this, or a suitable alternative?\n\nA: I realize this is an older question, but a common problem for several iphone models. Might help someone.\n The whole assembly is larger than the home button hole. Problem is the round plastic button does come loose from the whole assembly. It is glued in place and can break free. \nAs long as everything is functioning correctly, it wouldn't hurt to put a dab of glue on and stick it back in. Be careful not to use too much, as it could cause more problems!\nGood luck\n\nA: I can't see any mention of glue on the iFixIt guide to replace the Home button on the iPhone 5, nor on the comments there, or on the list of products or related products on the replacement button (plastic or hardware). It appears to me from the pictures that the button stays in place because it's bigger than the hole on the screen:\n\nSo no glue would be needed.\n\nA: I use 0,5mm thick vhb tape that I cut around the edge of the button on each side.\nThis settles the button in its lodgement, and prevent casual wobbling.\n", "Q: Allow access to www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies, but not www.bbc.co.uk I'm using OS X Parental Controls to limit what my son can do on our Mac.\nHe has his own user account, managed by the Parental Controls.\nUnder Website Restrictions, I've chosen \"Allow access to only these websites\".  The list of websites we've set up contains http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/, which contains child-friendly content.\nUnfortunately, Parental Controls ignores the /cbeebies/ path in the URL, and it allows access to any web page at http://www.bbc.co.uk/.  This is a large site including news which I'd rather my son didn't have access to.\nApple have documented this behaviour in support article HT2900 (and although the article title refers to 10.5 and 10.6, this still seems to be the case in 10.8 and 10.9):\n\nFor most websites, the Internet content filter considers the domain name and not the path. For example, if http://www.example.com is added to the list, then http://pictures.example.com will be allowed, as will http://www.example.com/movies.\n\nHow can I set up my son's user account to block access to the BBC website generally, but still allow access to CBeebies?\n\n\n*\n\n*My son uses Safari and the Simple Finder\n\n*We are currently using 10.8 but could upgrade to 10.9 (however, I've just tested and the issue persists there)\n\n*We are already using OpenDNS and could apply some blocking there, but I want the blocking to apply only to my son's account on this Mac, not other accounts or other machines on our network\n\n*I'm fairly experienced with UNIX, Apache etc.  I'm wondering about setting up a local web server (eg http://localhost/cbeebies/) which would act as a proxy for the CBeebies site only, and add that URL to the Parental Controls whitelist... but before I spend the time to puzzle that out, can anyone share any relevant experience?\n\n\nA: This seems resolved in 10.11 El Capitan (and perhaps also 10.10 Yosemite... haven't tested there).\nSpecifically, the following now works (and is what I wanted):\n\n\n*\n\n*set \"Allow access to only these websites\"\n\n*visit http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/ in Safari\n\n*grant access\n\n*access is now granted when visiting http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/ and pages with the same URL prefix, eg http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/topics\n\n*access is denied to pages on the same domain with a different URL prefix, eg http://www.bbc.co.uk/, or http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer.\n\n\nA: You could allow www.cbeebies.com, which is what it redirects to from anywhere but the UK, and use the address www.cbeebies.com/global to access.

It must be possible somehow!\n\nA: \nkextunload is a formal interface for unloading kexts in the Darwin OS and in Mac OS X.\n\nUnload the system audio driver:\nsudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext\nLoad it again:\nsudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext\nIf not \"AppleHDA.kext\", another kernel extension in /System/Library/Extensions/ may be what you're looking for.\n\nA: I don't know of any way to disable internal speakers. However, you might look into a solution like ControlPlane, which can automatically set your default audio output (and many other system settings) based on environmental factors of your choosing, e.g. having a specific display connected, or the presence of a specific WiFi access point.\n\nA: One partial solution is to use the Audio/MIDI setup utility to configure a \"multi-output device\" that only includes the audio devices you want to use, and setting that as your system audio device. However, using this method has the major disadvantage of not allowing any easy means of adjusting the volume on the underlying devices, even if there's only one device set up.\nAnother issue is that if any of the devices ever get temporarily disconnected or take a little while to appear at system startup or the like, you'll have to add the device back into the multi-output device.\nUnfortunately, macOS doesn't appear to have any built-in means of disabling an audio interface entirely or setting the device priority, which is supremely annoying.\n", "Q: How does Apple count app downloads?

I have not tested this product; I don't know whether the IP issues have been resolved.\nxrdp works on Sierra (I'm using it right now). The compilation instructions can be found on these two pages:\nhttps://github.com/neutrinolabs/xrdp/wiki/Building-on-OSX-(not-official)\nhttps://github.com/neutrinolabs/xorgxrdp/issues/78\nThe instructions work with macports as well as homebrew; on macports, the final package you need is pkgconfig rather than pkg-config, and you don't have to work around the absence of OpenSSL.

So I connect to OSX using the native built-in RDP client from Win7\nMy old RDP shortcut connects to it and even autoscaling still works.. which is nice for resizing the Window when the OSX resolution is set high and I want to shrink it down to a smaller window on my desktop. Best of both worlds. It doesn't forward audio.. and its not multichannel, so no services like remote print to printers on the Mac.. but serves the purpose of avoiding installing a VNC client on Windows.\n\nA: I have nothing against OSXxRDP, but I'm truly amazed how you guys are pushing untrue information about iRAPP. Yes, CodeRebel went down, but their licensing servers were taken over by developers and they were supporting iRAPP for free. There was not any down time.

So he's asked them all to use a very simple format (no greeting, no salutation, nothing but the actual content they have to report).  Once each of these emails come in Monday night/Tuesday morning he then manually copies the text from each of them then pastes it into another email one at a time, thus composing one email w/ all of the content from each of the others.  Once he has this new, all-inclusive email, he then sends that to his supervisor.  (For the record I fully understand that there are countless better ways to do this and that it is laughable...but that's not my battle and it's how he was instructed to do it, so I'm just trying to make it easier for him.)\nGoal:\nI've already set up rules so the specific emails get moved to a designated box (thinking that that would make identifying the correct messages for the script/automation easier), and my next step was automating the...collation of these messages and creating and sending the new single message to the boss...and that's where things have stalled.\nI've found scripts for copying, scripts for pasting, and (on an older version of OS x, 10.6 maybe) even found an action in Automator that compiled the text from selected messages (in Mail) into one new message...but sadly it just won't run on more modern versions of the OS (specifically 10.8 and 10.9).\nSo the questions is:\nIs it possible, and if so how, to automate copying the message body of a specific group of emails and pasting all of the text into one new email, and have it addressed accordingly and sent?  The goal is for this guy to sit at his computer Tuesday mornings, select the emails in question (unless there's a way to script it so the correct messages are selected automatically) then run the script/service/application (via keyboard shortcut or a dock icon, both of which I can handle) and be done w/ it?\n\nA: tell application \"Mail\"\n\n  set theSubject to \"Subject\" -- the subject\n  set theContent to \"Content\" -- the content\n  set theAddress to \"xxx@163.com\" -- the receiver \n  set theSignatureName to \"signature_name\"-- the signature name\n  set theAttachmentFile to \"Macintosh HD:Users:moligaloo:Downloads:attachment.pdf\" -- the attachment path\n\n  set msg to make new outgoing message with properties {subject: theSubject, content: theContent, visible:true}\n\n  tell msg to make new to recipient at end of every to recipient with properties {address:theAddress}\n  tell msg to make new attachment with properties {file name:theAttachmentFile as alias}\n\n  set message signature of msg to signature theSignatureName\n\n  send msg\nend tell\n\n\nA: This is certainly possible with AppleScript. Here are some resources and snippets to help you craft your ideal script.\nThe final AppleScript combines the content of any selected e-mails and prepares an outgoing e-mail ready for sending.

I did not unplug my external drive and it is now migrating the backup.\n\nA: Since Migration Assistant tool has no pause / suspend button (and in the past when it did, it deleted the files and cleaned up if my memory is correct) you might get unexpected results on one or more files if you abort things.\n\n\n*\n\n*Cancelled wireless Migration Assistant... best way to start over?\n\n*iMac-to-iMac Migration was interrupted; Now, source iMac is reading as 0.0GB\n\n*Migration Assistant moved files to inaccesible new account, how to get to my old files?\nAs you can see, even Mac to Mac transfers which are supposed to survive a disconnect are sometimes not resilient. I believe a PC to Mac transfer is much simpler and akin to copying files, so you might only have one file that got corrupted if you interrupt things.\nIf you abort the transfer, all the files will be copied, but there is no guarantee they left a workable user account. In almost all cases, you can then log in and get to the files that have transferred, but you will want to clean things up / hand move things to the correct location.\nSince Migration Assistant doesn't move an entire PC user over, you might be fine with what transferred, but you have no way of knowing what has been transferred without puling the plug (so to speak).\n", "Q: Mavericks cannot connect to windows share by computer name, but works fine with IP I have a Mac Mavericks and a Windows 7 machines.\nOn my Windows I have shared some folders, but I can only connect to them using the IP address, but not the computer name.\nSo Finder -> Go-> Connect to Server… and the smb://my-win/Share does not work, but Finder -> Go -> Connect to Server… and the smb://192.168.1.3/Share works perfectly fine.\nIf I go into Network (Finder -> Go -> Network), the computer my-win shows up.

I notice that I'm asked to authenticate to do this differently than I would be if I put it in /Applications. What, if anything, is special about /Applications/Utilities?\n\nA: Nothing is really 'special' about that folder. It's just a folder in /Applications like any other folder (albeit with a custom icon).

I had your same problem with rearranging with the edit on and then when I clicked done it would revert back to the original unwanted order. But the steps I just described fixed it for me. I will now try and reselect show all purchases and see if it undoes what I just \"fixed\". I do not even know what made me take those steps - maybe intuition.

Am considering of upgrading either my RAM or swapping the HDD for an SSD. \nWhich would you recommend first and why?\n\nA: SSD's improve the start-up and shut down speed and will load apps installed on it a bit faster. \nMore ram will be very useful if you are running multiple big apps like xCode at the same time.\n\nI recently upgraded my SSD and I have upgraded my ram before that and both made my machine a lot faster, the SSD with booting and the ram with running apps.\nIt really depends on what you would like to speed up in your mac.\nIf you are not sure I would recommend more Ram since it is less of a hassle, cheaper and the performance boost is very noticeable especially when developing in Xcode\n\nA: Since the SSDs have gone cheaper I would pick one of these first.\nYou could also upgrade both ofcource.\nIf you need a lot of space, you might to check OptiBay for Mac, so you can remove SuperDrive and add a second HDD/SDD in your Mac.\nI recently bought a new MBP Retina 13 inch with 4GB RAM and 256GB SSD, I hardly see difference between SSD and 8GB which I've had before in an older Macbook Pro 2009.\n", "Q: Unable to change payment information to NONE in iOS Appstore Ever since adding an iTunes gift card to my account, I'm getting verification requests like crazy. I can't even download free apps. It takes me to my payment info and when I try to select none, I continually get a message under the payment info that says \"you must verify your payment info to continue\"\nI don't want a credit card on file and would really like the none option to work. My ID shows I still have iTunes credit. \n\nA: If you bring an Apple ID to the store that exists (instead of making a new one), you are not presented with the None option. \nTry the following steps as a work around:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to purchase a free item in the iTunes or Mac App Store on a non-iOS device\n\n*Log in when prompted\n\n*Accept any terms you have to\n\n*If None is not an option on the Review Payment Information screen, click Paypal\n\n*Click the To redeem a code, click here link that appears below\n\n*Log in again when prompted\n\n*Accept any terms you have to again\n\n*The new Review Payment Information screen should allow you to select None\nAlternatively, clicking Redeem in the Quick Links box on the main page of the Mac App Store may allow you to bypass steps 1-5. You also can just put in payment method one time, do not make a charge and then remove it.\nLastly, someone that's a family organizer can ask you to join and then you would leave once your account is \"verified\" into the app store.\n\nA: Does Apple think you have an unpaid balance? That cause cause the \"payment verification\" requests. To see if that's the case, check your purchase history. If you do have an outstanding balance, once you pay it you should be able to select \"none\" as a payment option.\nSee: \nWhy can’t I select None when I edit my payment information?\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/TS5366\n\nA: I had the same issue and the cause was that my salutation was missing from the info. You can fix this by selecting none and then scrolling down to and make sure all the address fields are complete.\n\nA: Apple is simply trying to make it easier to purchase apps if you decide to do that in the future. Providing the security code on the card lowers the fees Apple pays to the credit card processing company since it is evidence you are in physical possession of the card.\nYou aren't required to provide a credit card at all just to sign up. When you are prompted for the credit card type, Apple gives the option to chose \"None\". If you choose this while purchasing a free app, it will allow you to sign up without a credit card.\nApple provides walkthrough steps for doing this on both a computer and on an iPod touch or iPhone.\nIf this method is not available in your country but your country does have iTunes Store gift cards available, you can purchase one gift card and use it to create an account. You'll have to pay a little up front of course, but you won't have to provide a credit card before starting to purchase the free apps.\n\n\n\nA: Did you enter your billing address and phone number? Because this happened to me once and it did not let me select none without entering all the \"required\" info. It seems that you have a none option, so it might work. If not, tap a credit card/payment option, and click done. It will throw and error, so then switch to none(but make sure to enter you address and phone number)\n\nA: You most likely have an unpaid order or a authorisation issue with your bank. \nyou obviously can't select \"none\" until the order is paid.\nYou may want to see this :\nPay an unpaid balance in the iTunes Store - Apple Support\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-ie/HT203005\n\nA: Another reason you might be prevented from installing free apps is if you have an expired, or otherwise invalid, credit card attached to your Apple ID.   I had that problem.  When I deleted the expired credit card leaving NO payment method I was able to install free apps.\n", "Q: Will turning off Photo Stream make my Camera Roll not back up to iCloud?

If you didn't put them there on purpose they could cause problems when building Homebrew formulae, and may need to be deleted.\n\nUnexpected dylibs:\n/usr/local/lib/libtcl8.6.dylib\n/usr/local/lib/libtk8.6.dylib\n\nWarning: Unbrewed .pc files were found in /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig.

If you didn't put them there on purpose they could cause problems when building Homebrew formulae, and may need to be deleted.\n\nUnexpected static libraries:\n/usr/local/lib/libtclstub8.6.a\n/usr/local/lib/libtkstub8.6.a\n\n\nA: I got the same warnings, and worked it around with the following:\nSo first back up these files:\n\nmv /usr/local/lib/libtcl8.6.dylib /usr/local/lib/libtcl8.6.dylib.bak\n...\n\nThen install tcl/tk with Homebrew:\n\nbrew tap homebrew/dupes\nbrew install tcl-tk --with-tk\n\nThen link the files, so that R can find the tcl/tk installed by Homebrew:\n\nln -s /usr/local/Cellar/tcl-tk/8.6.1/lib/libtcl8.6.dylib /usr/local/lib/libtcl8.6.dylib\nln -s /usr/local/Cellar/tcl-tk/8.6.1/lib/libtk8.6.dylib /usr/local/lib/libtk8.6.dylib\n\nPlease double check that the linked location is where tcl-tk is installed.\nNow both Homebrew and R are happy.\nMore details can be found on my blog. Hope this helps.\n\nA: I got the same warnings from brew doctor. To get rid of R that I had installed via the cran package, I basically followed the same steps as Olivier, thus removing app and framework as described in the R Installation and Administration manual:\nrm -rf /Library/Frameworks/R.framework /Applications/R.app /usr/bin/R /usr/bin/Rscript\n\nThen I carefully removed the files listed as belonging to the package by making sure that no directories were deleted (especially the complete usr branch, which is listed in the output of pkgutil -- delete this one and you will get a kernel panic):\nfor F in `pkgutil --files org.r-project.x86_64.tcltk.x11 | sed 's/^/\\//'`\n  do if [[ -f $F ]]\n    then rm $F\n  fi\ndone\n\nThis left me with few Tcl and Tk-related directories in /usr/local/lib, which I got rid off manually, checking the output from pkgutil. Alternatively, but risking to remove unrelated directories that for whatever reason were left empty, this could be done via:\nfind /usr/local -type d -empty -delete\n\nI reinstalled R through brew install r without problems.\n\nA: I had the intention of uninstalling R completely from my Mac and re-installing it using Homebrew.\nCAUTION: DON'T FOLLOW THESE STEPS\nPlease read to the end of the post before taking any action.\nThe steps I took were as follows:\n1) Remove the R app and framework:\nrm -rf /Library/Frameworks/R.framework /Applications/R.app \\\n   /usr/bin/R /usr/bin/Rscript\n\n2) Remove the packages accompanying R (my understanding was that R installed some packages). On my system, I identified the following packages:\n$ pkgutil --pkgs | grep org.r-\norg.r-project.R.Leopard.fw.pkg\norg.r-project.R.Leopard.GUI.pkg\norg.r-project.R.Leopard.GUI64.pkg\norg.r-project.R.x86_64.fw.pkg\norg.r-project.R.x86_64.GUI.pkg\norg.r-project.x86_64.tcltk.x11\n\nTo see which files make up the Tcl/Tk package, for example, you may type:\npkgutil --files org.r-project.x86_64.tcltk.x11\n\nI used the following command to remove all the files and (sub-)folders from that package:\n# DO NOT RUN THIS it will delete /usr\n# pkgutil --files org.r-project.x86_64.tcltk.x11 | xargs sudo rm -rf\n\nThat turned out to be a very bad idea as it resulted in a kernel panic and I ended up having to re-install Mavericks!  Apparently, according to the geniuses at the Apple Store, the above packages come pre-installed with Mavericks and, for some unknown reason, deleting the files from the above mentioned package removes some essential system files!\nI concluded that using Homebrew causes a lot more trouble instead of making my life easier!  Originally, I dumped MacPorts for Homebrew because Homebrew was faster and MacPorts seemed to keep a lot of \"leaves\" on its trees! Also, both require regular maintenance.\nFinally, I'm giving up both!\n", "Q: Remount drive without physically disconnecting? So I have unmounted a usb external hard drive but I went to re-mount it.  Is there a command that I can use to remount the drive?  Only way I know to re-mount a drive is to disconnect the usb cable from my Mac and reconnect it.\n\nA: diskutil mount also accepts a volume name, so there is no need to grep the output of diskutil list. If the disk has multiple volumes (like a Time Machine volume and another volume), you can use diskutil mountDisk to mount all volumes:\n$ diskutil mount WD\nVolume WD on WD mounted\n$ osascript -e 'tell app \"Finder\" to disks where ejectable is true'\ndisk WD\n$ diskutil eject Untitled\nDisk WD ejected\n$ diskutil mountDisk WD\nVolume(s) mounted successfully\n$ osascript -e 'tell app \"Finder\" to disks where ejectable is true'\ndisk Time Machine, disk WD\n\nmountDisk and eject apply to all volumes even if you specify the name of one volume.\n\nA: Alternate easy solution: In place of ejecting drive you should unmount it, and when needed mount it again.\nUnmount / mount: Command F (Spotlight search) > Disk utility > Select drive > unmount / mount\nAfter unmount, it's also safe to remove disk physically.\n\nA: One-liner:\ndiskutil mount `diskutil list | grep \"Volume Name\" | sed -n -e 's/^.* //p'`\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the disk identifier:\ndiskutil list | grep \"Volume Name\"\n\nExample result:\n4:   Apple_HFS Volume Name   100 GB   disk1s2\n\n*Mount the disk:\ndiskutil mount disk1s2\n\n\nA: Disk Utility will let you remount any connected drives. Just \n\n\n*\n\n*open it up (It is usually in Applications > Utilities)\n\n*select the drive \n\n*click \"Mount\"\n\nA: In addition to the answers already given, there is also a GUI app for this, which I really like: Mountain.\nIt's a $2 app that sits in the menu bar and keeps track of both mounted and unmounted drives. Unmounted drives can be remounted from there as well.\nYou can download a free trial from the website. \n(Also note that once you install the Mac App Store version, there is an update available directly from the developer. I assume the update isn't on the Mac App Store because of Apple's sandboxing rules.)\n", "Q: Command Line - How do I change the order of a user's group memberships? I have a troublesome Mac OS X server to deal with. When I ask for my current group membership using this:\n$ groups | perl -p -e 's/ /\\n/g'\n\nI get a list of 20+ groups!\ncactuar\ncom.apple.sharepoint.group.4\ncom.apple.sharepoint.group.5\ncom.apple.sharepoint.group.3\n... (etc) ...\nchocobo\ncom.apple.sharepoint.group.2\ncom.apple.sharepoint.group.6\n\nNow, because NFS is dated, it only makes use of the first 16 groups listed. Is there any way to change the order of the groups assigned to my user, while keeping all the other groups assigned? Basically, I need to have \"chocobo\" up near the top of that list and I don't know what administrative commands exist to accomplish this goal.\nSince I'm ignorant of the what \"sharepoint\" is good for, I find it totally strange and useless that those strange \"com.apple.*\" groups are not assigned in /etc/group, so, while I'm asking about users and groups, what is the keyword (search term) for OS X's auxiliary user-groups system, so that I can research it more; or more directly, where is the manual for that? Would it be harmless to drop all those sharepoint group memberships, or should I assume that they are actually important for accessing some yet-unknown resource(s)?\n\nA: The groups command is not showing the correct ordering of groups in your user context. It is sorting group ids by gid.\nUse \"id\" the show your group set actually used by NFS.\nSee \"man groups\" for details.\nUse the command \"newgrp group\" to change a group into the first place of the gid list.\n", "Q: \"newgrp: too many groups\" - why is it complaining? In my earlier question, I got a response recommending the \"newgrp\" command. It diligently did the job of putting my desired group at the \"top of the list\" for the \"id\" command, but, why does it also complain about \"too many groups\"? What is the limit, and, where is the documentation about that?\n\nA: From the source code of newgrp\nif (ngrps == NGROUPS_MAX)\n    warnx(\"too many groups\");\n\nand I think  NGROUPS_MAX is defined as 16.\nThat is given in syslimits.h\n\nA: Yes in Macosx ngroups is 16\nRun \"sysctl kern.ngroups\"\nAnd btw it cannot be changed with  \"sysctl -w \" \n", "Q: close all the instances of google chrome except first I can close google chrome with following bash command:\nkill -9 $(ps -x | grep \"Google Chrome\" | awk \"{print $1}\")\n\nIt closes all instances of google chrome. \nBut I need command that close all the instances of google chrome except first, because music is playing there and I don't want to stop it. \nI use word instance to express new google chrome window which opens after I press super N.\n\nA: To close all windows except the frontmost window, run:\nosascript -e 'tell app \"Google Chrome\" to close (windows 2 thru -1)'\n\nTo close all windows except the window opened first, run a script like this in AppleScript Editor:\ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    if number of windows < 2 then return\n    set min to id of window 1\n    repeat with w in windows 2 thru -1\n        if id of w < min then set min to id of w\n    end repeat\n    close (windows where id is not min)\nend tell\n\n\"Instances\" are usually called windows in OS X, and windows are not separate instances of a process like the instances opened by open -n.\n\nA: I arrived here trying to work out how to close all chrome instances from terminal on macOS.

However Alfred doesn't apply search queries to file contents as does the regular spotlight search.]\n\nA: You can use HoudahSpot to search multiple locations.\nHoudahSpot is an advanced front-end to Spotlight. It lets you build complex queries to search metadata stored in the Spotlight index.\nIn the HoudahSpot \"Query Pane\" you will find a \"Where…\" section. Here you can specify which locations / drives / folders to search. There is also an \"Exclude…\" section where you can specify folders to ignore. E.g. you could search your Home folder, but ignore results from the ~/Library folder.\nFull disclosure: I am the developer of HoudahSpot\n", "Q: Software to generate photo gallery HTML with download links I have the following requirement: A software that runs on OS X which takes a number of image files and creates a HTML gallery out of them.\nIt needs to have the following features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Caption and description on a main thumbnail page.\n\n*Medium size pages for each image, which is scaled down to like 600×600 pixels.

When it's not plugged in nothing will make it boot.\n\nA: I'm having the same issue as you described it here. I have a iPhone 5, too.\nIf you have done anything suggested by Apple, it's a battery issue. You need to change the battery in order it to work. Otherwise, I don't think there is any other way you can make it work. Attached is the link from Apple.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201210\nFor my situation, before it turned out to error 2001, the temperature of my phone was pretty hot, so I shut it down to let it cool. But after a while, when I wanted to reboot it, it turned out like this. \nSo I had been searching around the internet for over a hour to seek a solution, all the people were suggesting to try the fix by above link. For me, it did not work. After having reading several forums, they suggested to change the battery. Therefore, I decided to change my battery.\nAt the same time, I didn't really want to take it to Apple Stores because I think my problem lies on the battery and it would cost me over 70 dollars to let them fix it.\nSo I ordered the iPhone 5 battery tool kit from Amazon. It was around 15 dollars. I followed a tutorial on the internet to change the battery. It's pretty easy. Then I fixed the problem.\n\nA: On similar situation, I had errors 2003 and 2006, with the same message. Use ReiBoot (Macbook app) to push the phone out of recovery mode cycle. I had the same problem and only that app solved it. I tried going into DFU mode and  without DFU mode, using .ipsw files to restore old and new iOS version, and none worked. I installed ReiBoot and in 5 minutes I solved the problem. Just install the app for mac (I do not know if it works for windows) and plug the iPhone in the computer. Open the ReiBoot and push the phone out of recovery mode cycle. VOILA! This was the only thing that worked for me. Nothing else worked. I tried different USB ports, different USB cables, nothing else worked, literally.\n\nA: You should try another cable to check whether the cable is the issue, or another hardware..\nAs per Apple KB to see specific iTunes errors:\n\n\nCheck USB connections Related errors: 13, 14, 1600-1629, 1643-1650, 2000-2009, 4000, 4005, 4013, 4014, 4016, “invalid response,” and being\n    prompted to restore again after a restore completes.\n\nIf there’s an issue with the USB port, cable, dock, or hub, or if the\n  device becomes disconnected during restore, try troubleshooting the\n  USB connection, then troubleshooting your security software.\nTo narrow down the issue, you can also change up your hardware: \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Use another USB cable.\n  \n*Plug your cable into a different USB port on your computer.\n  \n*Try a different dock connector (or no dock).\n  \n*Add (or remove) a USB hub between your device and computer.\n  \n*Connect your computer directly to your Internet source, with no routers, hubs, or switches. \n  \n*If you checked your connections and are still seeing the error message, check for hardware issues.\n  \n\n\nA: To conclude this story:\nI brought my iPhone to the genius bar and they couldn't fix it either.\nFortunately my warranty was still valid.\n\nA: i found the solution for this\nalways i have to restore open the iphone 5 and battery is unpluged i plugin battery connector again and i can restore iphone\ni hope this work for you\ni change battery and somebody forget to install the lock for battery connector\n", "Q: Why is 'xattr' not working? When I attempt to execute xattr in Terminal, I get\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/bin/xattr-2.7\", line 33, in <module>\n    import xattr\nImportError: No module named xattr\n\nWhat's going on here? I thought xattr was part of Darwin. Is xattr written in Python? Does it require a Python package to be installed on my system?\n\nA: The file that is executed when you run the command xattr is /usr/bin/xattr which is a python script that works out what version of python you have and then executes /usr/bin/xattr-2.7 for python 2.7. This script is also python and includes a import xattr to import the python module xattr from the Apple installed python libraries \n\nA: Might want to add some newer info per 2023:\nThe xattr executable shipped with macOS 13.2 is no longer a Python script, but a native binary, so the original issue should no longer be possible:\n$ file /usr/bin/xattr\n/usr/bin/xattr: Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures: [x86_64:Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64] [arm64e:Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64e]\n/usr/bin/xattr (for architecture x86_64):   Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64\n/usr/bin/xattr (for architecture arm64e):   Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64e\n\nBut ... the Python xattr package still provides a similar command that might cause issues if installed in the same system and made available on the PATH as it does not share the same set of options! This can happen with Homebrew for instance (where it lands in /opt/homebrew/bin/xattr, shadowing the built-in). The executable is just a small script that calls out to the main module:\n#!/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.10/bin/python3.10\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\nimport re\nimport sys\nfrom xattr.tool import main\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    sys.argv[0] = re.sub(r'(-script\\.pyw|\\.exe)?$', '', sys.argv[0])\n    sys.exit(main())\n\n\nA: If you have a version of Python installed with Homebrew, try unlinking it.\nbrew unlink python\n\n/usr/local/bin/xattr uses the version of Python 3 suggested to it by env.

Anyone know why this happens?\n\nA: I have been getting this on OS X 10.10 (Yosemite). I found a solution in the Apple discussion forums.\nUser LHindiii there recommended quitting Messages.app then using Activity Monitor to quit the Dock (which will automatically relaunch) and this worked for me.\n\nA: Easiest solution is to create a script similar to the one above with just one line like this:\ntell application \"Messages\" to \"clear unread messages\"\n\n\nA: I found that a combination of the previous answers works best as a script in Script Editor:\ntell application \"Messages\" to \"clear unread messages\"\ndelay 1\ntell application \"Messages\" to quit\ndelay 1\ntell application \"Dock\" to quit\ndelay 1\ntell application \"Messages\" to launch\n\n\nA: I was able to solve this by right-clicking Messages in the Dock, clicking on the unread messages that showed up in the resulting contextual menu (they happened to be SMSes added via Continuity), and responding to them.\n\nA: This worked for me:\nI made a script in Script Editor that ran the following:\ntell application \"Messages\" to quit\n    delay 1\ntell application \"Dock\" to quit\n    delay 1\ntell application \"Messages\" to launch\n\nSave the script as an application, and launch it every time Message messes up.\n\nA: None of these solutions worked for me, on High Sierra.\nThis did.

There are tools for mac to disable it I believe. I don't know wether those affect windows as well. \nEDIT: It seems the volume you set in windows has no control over the volume when booting again.

How does HFS+ store its files and metadata, and will it be possible to recover the data this way?\nHere is the log of what happened from the shell log:\n$ diskutil list\n[...]\n/dev/disk2\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *2.0 TB     disk2\n   1:                  Apple_HFS WD-40                   2.0 TB     disk2s1\n\n$ diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2\nUnmount of all volumes on disk2 was successful\n\n$ sudo dd if=/Users/Felix/Downloads/xubuntu-12.04.3-alternate-i386.img of=/dev/disk2 bs=1m\n^C503+0 records in\n502+0 records out\n526385152 bytes transferred in 16.409358 secs (32078351 bytes/sec)\n$ diskutil list\n[...]\n/dev/disk2\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *2.0 TB     disk2\n   1:                       0x17                         715.1 MB   disk2s1\n\nAnd the log from the Testdisk scan (Deeper Search), which I aborted at around 40% progress because the drive is so large:\n[...]\nLVM magic value at 31676/178/3\n\nLVM magic value at 31685/19/35\nSearch for partition aborted\n\nResults\n     MS Data                354087269  354093442       6174\n     NTFS found using backup sector, blocksize=512, 3161 KB / 3087 KiB\n     MS Data                354093442  354099615       6174 [Boot]\n     NTFS, blocksize=512, 3161 KB / 3087 KiB\n   P MS Data                354099734  354120472      20739 [NO NAME]\n     FAT12, blocksize=4096, 10 MB / 10 MiB\n     MS Data                358938549  358944722       6174\n     NTFS found using backup sector, blocksize=512, 3161 KB / 3087 KiB\n     MS Data                358944722  358950895       6174 [Boot]\n     NTFS, blocksize=512, 3161 KB / 3087 KiB\n   P MS Data                358951010  358971748      20739 [NO NAME]\n     FAT12, blocksize=4096, 10 MB / 10 MiB\n     MS Data                363749573  363755746       6174\n     NTFS found using backup sector, blocksize=512, 3161 KB / 3087 KiB\n     MS Data                363755746  363761919       6174 [Boot]\n     NTFS, blocksize=512, 3161 KB / 3087 KiB\n   P MS Data                363762034  363782772      20739 [NO NAME]\n     FAT12, blocksize=4096, 10 MB / 10 MiB\n   P MS Data                371716138  371719017       2880 [EFISECTOR]\n     FAT12, blocksize=512, 1474 KB / 1440 KiB\n     MS Data                371720053  371726226       6174\n     NTFS found using backup sector, blocksize=512, 3161 KB / 3087 KiB\n     MS Data                371726226  371732399       6174 [Boot]\n     NTFS, blocksize=512, 3161 KB / 3087 KiB\n   P MS Data                377878122  377881001       2880 [EFISECTOR]\n     FAT12, blocksize=512, 1474 KB / 1440 KiB\n   P MS Data                377881002  377883881       2880 [EFISECTOR]\n     FAT12, blocksize=512, 1474 KB / 1440 KiB\n   P MS Data                421662274  421665153       2880 [EFISECTOR]\n     FAT12, blocksize=512, 1474 KB / 1440 KiB\n     MS Data                421674913\n\n\nA: Since the table has most likely been written over, scanning for the files and backing them up that way is probably the only option. DataRescue is one of the more popular ones. \n\nA: Don't write any more data to that filesystem or drive. You might try if DiskWarrior can scavenge some of the HFS filesystem metadata, but a program like Data Rescue is your best bet for recovering all of the files that are still intact without needing any filesystem metadata. \n\nA: I did something similarly stupid: used dd to write a raspbian image over my TimeMachine backup drive. The commands listed here didn't work for me:\n$ sudo gpt -v recover /dev/disk3       \ngpt recover: /dev/disk3: mediasize=2000398933504; sectorsize=512; blocks=3907029167\ngpt recover: /dev/disk3: error: device contains a MBR\n\nDiskWarrior couldn't recognize the drive at all, and DataRescue was unable to\nrecover any files after a deep scan.\nLuckily the backup gpt record was still intact:\n$ sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk3          \n       start        size  index  contents\n           0           1         MBR\n           1        8191         \n        8192      524288      1  MBR part 12\n      532480     7036928      2  MBR part 131\n     7569408  3899459726         \n  3907029134          32         Sec GPT table\n  3907029166           1         Sec GPT header\n\nSo I installed the awesome gdisk for mac, loaded the backup partition table, verified the disk, wrote the changes, etc. After this the disk mounted and showed up as nameless in Disk Utility, but DiskWarrior was able to rebuild the index and bring it to a usable state.\n", "Q: Upgrading jailbroken iOS 5.1.1 iPhone to (regular) iOS 7.1 I'm trying to upgrade and the new OS downloaded but everytime I want to install it, I get:\nSoftware Update Unavailable\n\nSoftware Update is not available at this time. Try again later.\n\nI read that this means I should try later, but I tried many, many times yesterday and today and it didn't go through. Supposedly the device needs to contact Apple to sign the new OS. I also doubt there is so much traffic to Apple servers now, this update is not that new (8 days old). So I wonder if the message is because of either a jailbreak or because something is wrong (bug) when upgrading for such an old iOS to 7.1.\n\nA: Are you attempting to update OTA on the device? Don't do this — the error message is helping you by preventing you from updating your jailbroken device like this. Instead, restore the device using iTunes to the latest iOS, then restore from backup if you wish.\n", "Q: Is there a plugin for hotmail calendars I'd like to see my hotmail calendars using iCal (or if need be, another calendar tool).\nI have a new mac running Maverick and I'm blown away by the answers I'm seeing online. I don't want to forward my calendars to another email account like gmail. That's a ridiculous work around. It's 2014!\nWhat are my other options? Is there some kind of plugin for acccount connections? or is there another program I can use to see my calendars instead of iCal? (keep it free people). \nThanks\n\nA: Go into outlook (hotmail) calendar and push \"share\" then choose the option to send a View only Link.  \nCopy the \"Import into other calendar applications (ICS)\" link. \nOn your mac, go to Calendar and subscribe. \nWrite a name for your calendar and then enter the URL you copied from hotmail, substituting \"http\" for \"webcals\".  \nChose how often you want it it to refresh, what alerts you want, then enter and the calendar from hotmail will appear on your Mac!\n", "Q: How can I `brew prune` multiple entries? After many calls with the Apple support, they told me I should reinstall the OS and restore my stuff with the migration assistant. I did it and almost everything works fine so far.\nOnly brew doctor shows me a few errors. I could fix the most of them by myself. I just don't know the most elegant way to solve the following error:\nlocalhost:~ Newton1$ brew doctor\nWarning: Broken symlinks were found.

I am still running iOS 6 on my iPad.\nI have several apps that are failing to download right now (error message is \"unable to download update at this time\") and I'm wondering if it could be because I am not on the latest OS? \nI have done the following troubleshooting:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Reset home network\n\n*Reset the iPad\n\n*Tried to tap on the app needing updates so that it triggers it to start\n\n*Verified that my account works fine\n\n*Verified free space (10+ gb)\n\n\nI'm not sure what other troubleshooting I can do, so I thought I'd see here if my OS version was a potential problem or what else I should look into next.\n\nA: It turned out to be a network issue. \nEven though I had reset my home router, it came down to how far away from the router I was. I guess the iPad couldn't get a stable enough connection to meet the needs of the download (even though the wifi icon on the ipad showed full strength). Moving closer to my wireless router resolved the problem. \n", "Q: Buying IPhone in another person name without contract (withoutcontract) Can I buy an iPhone in another person's name because I will be gifting it to him so that he can claim under they warranty if anything comes up in the future. \n\nA: The warranty is tight to the device via serial number, not the purchaser name.\n", "Q: Does my son know I'm using Find my iPhone when I log on? If I use Find my iPhone to locate my son's phone, does he know I am checking?  Does his phone alert him that I'm checking on him?\n\nA: No, he will not notice tracking. Phone will alert only if you press \"Play sound on iPhone\".\n\nA: By default, no, there is no way for them to know the device is being viewed through Find My iPhone.\nHowever, your son could enable System Services status bar icon so that the device shows the location services icon in the status bar when any system service location tracking is active.\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings → Privacy → Location Services → System Services → Status Bar Icon\n\n\nThis shows the normal location services icon (and not a special icon for Find My iPhone) if the device's location is being obtained through Find My iPhone.\nWhether your Son has other location services that would cause the icon to already show or if he would notice the times when the server asks for an update is another story, but it's possible for him to get tipped off if he changes one setting.\nFurthermore, if the device is jailbroken, there are numerous tweaks which would make detecting Find my iPhone extremely simple, from Firewall iP to network logging.\n\nA: Since the question was \"will he know\" and not \"is there any way to know\", I've decided to answer:\nMaybe he'll figure it out but probably not. It really depends on how much he's paying attention. @grgarside's answer is technically correct that he can turn on a setting which puts an arrow on the screen whenever the phone it figuring out it's location.  But it's subtle and doesn't show on the home screen which app is determining location.  Also, if you're tracking someone for an hour, it will only show the icon on their phone about once every other minute for about 5-10 seconds each time.  So it's very subtle and the arrow does not stay on.  There is no way for him to set the phone to alert him (set off an alarm) if he's being tracked. And even if he sees the arrow on screen he might not make the connection that she's tracking him.  Because lots of other apps also use location services.\nWill he know that she's tracking him?  NO.  The most would be that he might suspect it.\n", "Q: iphone status bar activity indicator spins forever Can someone point me why this activity indicator is spinning? All apps are closed. It's starts to spin right after I'm activating wifi. Wifi turned off - activity indicator disappearing.\n\nA: The Cause\nI can reproduce this problem consistently on iOS 7.1.1. Just go into App Store and click the \"update all\" button in the updates tab. When you exit to your home screen, the activity indicator will spin in the status bar incessantly. Since the code has been wedged into the wrong state, the only way to get rid of the activity indicator is to power down your phone and boot it back up.\nThe Reason\nThis is caused by Apple developers poor programming. They properly show it when apps begin to update:\n[UIApplication sharedApplication].networkActivityIndicatorVisible = YES;\n\nBut they fail to turn it off when the apps finish updating:\n[UIApplication sharedApplication].networkActivityIndicatorVisible = NO;\n\nThe way their Cocoa Touch framework is written makes it very easy for amateur developers to make this mistake, including Apple's own internal iOS development team. It's very hard to manage nested network operations that need to show the activity indicator. The correct interface for managing the activity indicator would have been to create a stack. Any time the indicator is needed, an object would be pushed onto the stack. When the operation is complete, the object would be popped from the stack. Once the stack is empty, the indicator should disappear.\n\nA: Usually that means that your phone is doing a heavy-weight network activity, which can mean any of the following (not exhaustive list, only most common, and, coincidentally, easiest to fix):\n\n\n*\n\n*The network you've connected to needs some more configuration, and it's taking some time to get the configuration information set properly from the router (or, more likely, DNS server)\n\n*Your phone is polling for a lot of data to transfer - maybe there are a lot of apps to update, or you have a lot of email to sync, or you have a lot of cloud data to download\n\n*Your phone is trying to hit an important server, and is having trouble connecting to it (say, it's trying to poll apple servers to check for software updates and the servers in questions are down). The spinner is going to stay up for a while, until your phone gives up or gets an actual connection.\n\n\nTry connecting to a reliable network (fast connection, easy internet access - ie, not something like a coffee shop network), and letting your phone figure itself out for a while (give it a good 15-20m). Try doing this a few times. If you still have the spinner problem on the good network after being connected to it for a long time, and checking your phone a few times, you might have a rarer, but also much more difficult to diagnose/fix, problem - go to the apple store and ask them to take a look :)\n\nA: I had the same problem: Network Activity icon constantly spinning on home screen, even with all apps closed. I turned off my iPhone and then turned it back on. Problem solved. \n\nA: I had the same problem: Network Activity icon constantly spinning on home screen, even with all apps closed.

Has anyone figured out how to enable HiDPI mode for the Dell p2815Q on Mac OS X 10.9? I have tried Quartz Debug, default write commands at the terminal and SwitchResX, to no avail.\n\nA: The answer is here: \nBasically, per Apple’s website you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Mac App Store\n\n\n\n*Download XCode (free)\n\n*Follow their instructions to download Graphics Tools for Xcode package\n\n*Run Quartz Debug, following the instructions here on StackExchange, making sure to note that you will have to make each settings change and log out of your account each time, and if your computer has multiple accounts you may have to do the same on each one! (What a pain!)\n\n*Somehow it should automagically work out that the next time you log in, you can choose HiDPI settings in your Displays control panel.\n\n\n", "Q: Do I have a virus, a back door? Am I hacked? Recently my MacBook has slowed down a lot, though I haven't downloaded any large files or installed new applications, I've mainly used the web.\nYesterday I was doing some work in Photoshop and noticed I had a terminal window open. So I open it to find it continuously pinging 25.212.254.172, as if it was trying a DDoS attack or something. That's when it freaked me out. \nI've deleted a whole lot of unnecessary files and applications taht have been on my laptop for the longest but I'm still unsure what to do. A lot of people argue Macs don't get viruses and I think that's a load of crap. \nHow do I protect my MacBook, manage outgoing connections, remove viruses or figure out what's going on?\nOh and I had this weird thing happen...\nI was traveling to Las Vegas two weeks ago and my MacBook looked like it was opened from the bottom and tape was hanging out of it - after retrieving my luggage from the airport. I'm thinking of opening it up but what would I look for if I'm being monitored through hardware? Any tips here too?\nYea I know I'm a bit paranoid but you can't blame me with the NSA revelations.\n\nA: *\n\n*I don't know who you are, but chances are, you're aren't relevant enough to warrant hardware tapping.\n\n*Macs don't really get viruses. There are some trojans (malware in disguise as user software), but they require the user to manually input their administrative password. If you're suspect your infected, try a virus scanner like ClamXAV, but I doubt you'll find anything. Apple does a really good job at keep up to date against malware. DO NOT install any sort of on demand virus software. Generally Mac anti-virus programs don't actually protect from Mac viruses; they're meant to prevent Macs for being a vector for Windows viruses. As a Mac user, it's very easy to download a file infected with a Windows virus, and unknowingly pass it on to a Windows user.\n\n*A much more likely explanation is some sort of system related issue. Can you please keep Activity monitor open, and enable its dock icon CPU viewer from this menu:\n\nKeep an eye on the CPU levels, perhaps you'll find a runaway process that's using your system resources.\n\n", "Q: PayPal emails go to Spam folder on Mail Mac I use Mac Mail as my email program and I would like to know why PayPal emails go always to the spam folder. I have tried to make rules, mark PayPal email as VIP contact but nothing works.\nI would like them to be sent to my primary inbox.\nThanks in advance\n\nA: E-mails that have been placed into the spam folder by Apple Mail will have this header: \nIf you see an e-mail in your spam folder that lacks this header, than the e-mail has been automatically been placed into the spam folder by your mail provider. You should mark it as \"not spam\" from within your mail service's web client.\n\nA: Assuming these mails are really from Paypal, you can retrain the spam filter by marking them as \"not spam\" in the Spam folder and then moving them to your Inbox again. It may take some time to change the current rules though.\n", "Q: How to retrieve a deleted voice note from iPhone 5s? I recorded a 5 minute voice memo on my iPhone 5s and when I tapped \"stop\" I was prompted to give the memo a name. I named it and then I tapped \"Delete\" instead of \"Save\", and it disappeared! Noting that I was connected to my MacBook at the time of recording / naming the voice note.  Can I retrieve this recording?\n\nA: Unless you have a backup, no. Once it's deleted, it's gone from your device. Check the time on the last iCloud backup — if it's after you recording the audio but before you deleted it, you can restore from your iCloud backup to get the voice memo back.\n", "Q: Is there an RSS reader app that can download full articles instead of abstracts? One of the main blogs I'm reading has recently transitioned from publishing the full posts in its RSS feed, to publishing just the first few sentences with a \"read more\" link. This drastically slows me down when reading, as it requires an extra tap and a good number of seconds to load the full, heavy web page instead of the previously light article.\nIs there any app that can automatically fetch the full articles from a blog when reading the feed, or - better yet - store all of them in advance so that it can be read offline?\n\nA: Edit- Newsflow does exactly this with the ability to save article to pocket for offline reading\nAlso this can be done with Feedly with a simple tweak. Adding a user script called 'full feed' that you can plugin with tampermonkey or stylish that expands the entire article inside Feedly. This also can be saved to pocket for offline view.\n\nA: Readkit for Mac has the ability to fetch the whole article via Readability. Reeder for iOS does the same.\n\nA: It's not an app, but I've had good luck using Full-Text RSS, which is a site that can convert most RSS feeds into full text. You can either host it yourself or use their hosted version.\n", "Q: Open-source TextWrangler alternative? I need to use a text editor that is capable of always saving documents using Windows CRLF line endings. So now I'm using TextWrangler. I am opening files from volumes encrypted with TrueCrypt, and I need the content, and the fact that I'm opening these files, to remain secret.\nTextWrangler, on the other hand, conveniently stores information about all documents opened in a file called 'Document State.plist'. The file is XML.\nTextWrangler's manual says the following about 'Document State.plist', and nothing else:\n\"TextWrangler stores state information for individual documents in this file.\"\nThere is no way to disable the storing of this information in the preferences. Furthermore, there is a  section for some files that is ASCII encoded, but I don't know what is stored in this field.\nSo my question is, are there any good open source text editors for Mac that allow you to specify line endings, or is there a way to prevent TextWrangler from creating this file?\n\nA: TextMate is a good editor on its own right, and has been open-sourced with an active development community.\n", "Q: Songs dont finish playing Some of my songs do not finish playing on my iphone. I have tried enabling itunes match and syncing on the computer. Songs will shut off or stop with like 35 seconds remaining in the song. Help?\n\nA: This has happened to me in the past.

On the bottom of the Featured tab Apple ID is correct, but when I try to update an app App Store asks me a password for the old Apple ID that I no longer have.\n\nA: You bought the apps with your old Apple ID. Apps are permanently tied to the ID with which they were bought.\nI'm fairly certain if you deleted them, and re-downloaded them with your new ID, the problem would be solved. You would, however, have to pay for them again if they were not free.\nRelevant questions:\nAttempting to update app asks for a different iTunes account password (pretty much a duplicate)\nHow can I find which account I used for downloading my iOS apps?\n\nA: That's because you downloaded some app using that old ID.

I've done many migrations from time machine, and Mac to Mac (I'm no novice) and never experienced this issue. The external drive used for the backup isn't connected when I attempt to fast user switch, so at the moment I can't imagine what the system is stuck looking for since the exact data exist for all the users on my system. There are 3 users (A,B,C) on my system, and this issue only affect trying to fast user switch from 1 user to another (lets say A to B).

This has been the case for rather long.\nI agree that this is the most sensible behaviour. After all, the user that has switched herself in might want to use her own iTunes and music.\nHowever, there are still valid use cases where you'd like iTunes to keep playing. I have two: I personally have several users for different kinds of activity. Or even when I am together with my SO, we share the same iTunes library and choose together. So when she logs in to her account, she still wants my iTunes to keep playing. And the other way around.\nSo whether this is appropriate or not, is there a way to trick iTunes into keeping playing when the user account is switched out ? (not logged off of course).\n\nA: There is no way to do that. As soon as a user is switched, the inactive one looses all access to input/output devices on system-level.\n", "Q: Open Image in New Window did not work at Safari's Web Inspector mode I opened a website in Safari, opened Show Web Inspector, selected one of images from the Images folder, right-clicked and selected Open Image in New Window, and it did not open a new folder.\nI used Chrome and used Inspect Element- Open Image in New Tab, and Chrome opened the image in new tab.\nIs there some problem with Safari or my MacBook Air?\n\n\nA: Follow these steps to fix safari issue\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Develop --> User Agent --> Safari ...\n\n*Select it and do inspect then you can see the button on left side top corner.\n\n*Now set to default setting by redoing the first point.\n\n\n\n", "Q: What determines whether 'Warranty' appears in About This Mac?

The second spelling is usually a British spelling variation, (like labour for labor, aluminium for aluminum, &c.)\nI would hazard a guess that the word 'Warrantee' appears because different legal conditions are in effect if this particular Mac/OS X was purchased in the UK.\nMy iMac, registered with AppleCare and purchased in the the US, does not have 'Warrantee.'\n", "Q: Can I return my MacBook Pro?

Do they scratch the screens?\nFeel free to suggest any stylus!\n\nA: 20€ is a bit steep for a stylus, you can find many on e-bay and such for way less than 5€. They're all generally the same thing: a stick with a rubber dome on one end. The rubber has a similar capacitance to human skin, so it can be sensed by the screen. The rubber dome on the end is squishy and very soft, it will not scratch your screen.\n\nA: It is completly safe.\nIn its normal state, the rubber top of the stylus is soft and smooth, so it won't scratch your screen.\nEven when applying a lot of force there will be virtually no risk.\nThere would need to be something sharp (e.g.piece of broken glass) between the screen and the stylus to do some damage and even then it would require quite some pressure to be applied before the screen takes any damage.\n", "Q: Maverick installation problem Trying to install OS X Mavericks the computer re- started as part of the installation process but when it came back on it just has a white square half way down with the x in a circle and above says download OS X.

I would like to rollback to 10.9.1 or 10.9 but my recovery will only install 10.9.2 and redownloading Mavericks from the App Store also installs 10.9.2. Is there a way to roll back to one of these more stable versions?\nMy main issue is my inability to get a copy of 10.9.1 or 10.9. I am not sure where to get any of these!\n\nA: Yah, that's the problem with O/S X there IS no way to roll back O/S upgrades. On Windows you can do it but not on O/S X.\nI have said it before but it bears repeating: clone your HD before an O/S upgrade so if it goes bad you can revert from your clone.\nYeah, I know, not what you wanted or needed, but I am not aware of Apple offering old O/S versions for download (though some clever web surfer might have found such). You may have to resort to (ahem...) \"alternate\" means of downloading earlier versions.\nI would go that route, but clone your drive first (and TEST the clone: boot from it!), make a bootable installer thumb drive, boot from it and wipe the drive. Install the O/S clean and then use the Migration Assistant to get your personal files and Apps from the clone of your drive.\nNot a lot of fun but unless someone knows a legit source (apple.com) for previous installers (unlikely) you'll have to go to that other \"bay\" and I don't mean \"e.\"\n", "Q: List all playlists that include a particular song I would like to replace a songs that I have in my iTunes library with a higher quality version (and different filename).\nThese songs are listed in various playlists in my iTunes library, what would be the best way to update them on the playlists as well without manually going through each playlist to find find and replace?\n\nA: Okay so I have found that if I delete the track via Finder (and empty trash), then finding the track in my Library in iTunes as expected it will say the file is not found. This will then give you prompt to locate the file, after selecting the new file all instances of the track will be replaced with the new location automatically by iTunes\n\nA: That's a good solution for what you are trying to do.  To answer you actual question, you can ctrl-click (or right-click) on the song and select \"Show Playlists\" and it should show you the playlists the song is on.\n\nA: There's a nice tool from Doug Scripts which shows a floating window with all lists assigned to the selected song. \nhttp://dougscripts.com/itunes/scripts/ss.php?sp=showinplaylists\n", "Q: Spotlight Re-Indexing at Startup I have a 15\" Macbook Pro Early 2011 and OS X 10.9.2.

A mysterious file keeps appearing on my startup disk. It's most likely a typo in a script or something, but even though it's being created with my user account as the owner, that hasn't helped me narrow it down.\nWould it be safe for me to lock my system's startup disk to prevent writing to the root folder? As far as I know nothing needs to be written there, as all the various directories used by the system are already present such as /Library, /tmp, /Applications, /System and so on. But even so, I'm wondering if this is safe to do, or will it ruin my system?\nI'm hoping that by locking the volume I can force whatever is creating the file to report an error in a log file, and also to prevent similar clutter in future (some badly written programs have a nasty tendency to put log files there), but obviously it's no good if it'll break something!\n\nA: You could use dtrace to determine what is creating the file, say using iosnoop.d which runs under dtrace will reveal which applications are using the disk and what files they are reading or writing. This would imply catching its creation or write access, \"live\". \nIf that doesn't reveal who's created the file it could be because the process is communicating more tightly with the filessytem and hfsslower.d may be required to locating the IO to this file.\nYou could also see if the file is open currently, and if so by whom, using lsof.\nThe above suggestions should reveal what's writing this file, which I believe is the root of your question. \nBut to specifically answer your question, no you should not \"lock\" the root directory of your startup disk as this is not an advisable safe practice and may prevent the OS from booting or functioning as expected. I presume here that by locking you mean the Finder concept of locking a file, or the POSIX concepts of restricting permissions and using the uchg/schg file flags via chflags. While Mac OS X doesn't normally create new files in this location arbitrarily, changes in permissions and ownership could effect filesystem traversal by users and processes and in general *nix systems expect the root volume directory to be mutable. Many processes and commands in *nix use this as a fallback default, and it's often seen used in certain cases where a login occurs and there's no HOME, for instance. While it may ave no immediate short term negative effects, it's not a wise practice nor is it the best method to determine what's causing your mysterious file creation. \nKnowing more about the file might also help answer your underlying question. \n", "Q: Macbook pro doesn't go to sleep after left inactive In Energy Saver settings (System Preferences -> Hardware section) the Mac is set to sleep after 15 minutes, but nothing happens. \nMac drains battery and automatically turns off when battery is low. \nIf I type pmset -g assertions in terminal, I get this: \n3/31/14 5:46:52 AM EDT   \nAssertion status system-wide:\nPreventUserIdleDisplaySleep    0\nPreventSystemSleep             0\nPreventUserIdleSystemSleep     1\nInternalPreventDisplaySleep    0\nExternalMedia                  0\nUserIsActive                   0\nApplePushServiceTask           0\nBackgroundTask                 0\n\nListed by owning process:\n  pid 251(coreaudiod): [0x0000000100000d01] 00:17:27 NoIdleSleepAssertion named: \"com.apple.audio.'AppleHDAEngineOutput:1B,0,1,1:0'.noidlesleep\" \n  pid 251(coreaudiod): [0x0000000100000929] 01:11:47 NoIdleSleepAssertion named: \"com.apple.audio.'BoomEngine:0'.noidlesleep\" \n  pid 269(helpd): [0x0000000c00000159] 02:37:33 BackgroundTask named:     \"com.apple.helpd.sdmbuilding\" \n\nKernel Assertions: None\n\nHow should I read this?

CUPs has an option to set defaults for the secure printing job type, but not, is seems, to set the default job type.\nThey suggested editing the PPD file would work but they will not support it. This is outside of my area of expertise but I can get it developed if pointed in the right direction.\nA standalone automator app or system service would also be a suitable work around.

Since upgrading to Mavericks, I've noticed that when creating a PDF from another file, such as Pages, the file extension is included in the file name. Is there any way to turn this off?\nFor example, let's say I create a Pages document called \"Proposal.pages\". When I'm ready to e-mail the proposal, I'll create a PDF of the document by selecting CMD+P and then \"Save as PDF\".\nThe default title that will be chosen is \"Proposal.pages.pdf\". Fairly simply thing to change, but when you generate PDFs all day, it becomes bothersome.\n\nDoes anyone know of a way that I can remove the \".pages\" extension when creating the PDF file?\n\nA: Looks like the \"Save as PDF\" option in the Print dialog just takes the document title (which is set to the document name by Pages) and adds a .pdf suffix to it. As the new Pages doesn't seem to offer an option to change the title within Pages you might be out of luck here.\nAlternatively you could use the \"Export to... PDF\" menu entry to export to PDF directly.\n\nA: When you click \"Save as PDF,\" you get a window with a top row starting as \"Save as.\"  On the right side of that row is a downward pointing arrow.  Click on it to expand this window to see all your options.  At this point, at the bottom left of the window is a \"Hide extension\" button.\n\nA: All 3 iWork apps, (Pages, Numbers and KeyNote) neglect to remove their file extension from PDFs when Saving As PDF from the print menu. (Also, the Finder option to show file extensions has to be on.)\nIt is possible to create a script that deals with this, saving it as a PDF Service, which will be accessible from the PDF button of the print menu. (Any script or app in ~/Library/PDF Services will be shown there. You may need to create this folder.)\nThis python script will remove the iWork file extension, offer a file dialog, and save the PDF.\n#!/usr/bin/python\n# coding=utf-8\n\n# SAVE PDF FROM STUPID iWORK  \n# PDF Service to strip iWork file extension before saving PDF to designated folder   \n# Save this file in ~/Library/PDF Services.

Would backing up my home directory be enough or does OS X saves important files outside of it I should be aware of? This is not supposed to be a full OS backup, I only want my data. Applications' configuration details can be re-created and so on but other things such as bookmarks I do consider important.\nCurrently backing up:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Users/Crocodile  (except for Trash & Library)\n\n*/Users/Crocodile/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles  (FF bookmarks)\n\n*/Users/Crocodile/Library/Fonts  (user-specific fonts)\n\n\nI use CalDAV for calendar and IMAP for email so no need to backup Mail/Calendar directories, right?\n\n[edit] Added the user-specific Fonts directory. The system-wide directory, located at /Library/Fonts, is not needed IMO since a OS reinstall will include (most of) them; plus these can easily be copied from another machine.\n\nA: A lot of applications store critical information in ~/Library so you might be better off with backing up your whole user folder (with the exception of Trash of course). If you use incremental backups the size will not be too big after the first run. And you can at least exclude ~/Library/Caches anyway. You also may want to back up any registration codes for applications (by keeping them in separate file for instance) you've bought so you can reinstall them easily.\nOTOH you might want to consider the time required to rebuild all your configurations and installations from scratch and compare this to the price of an external USB drive. \n\nA: Generally speaking your /users/USERNAME folder should be sufficient. Many backup utilities automatically exclude the cache and trash directories, so depending on the program you use you may not have to manually exclude them.\nAlthough there are some application and system-specific files stored in the /Library (as opposed to ~/Library which is in your user folder) it is usually safe to not back that folder up. The things there are specific to the system itself and any universal settings for applications. \nBe aware though that programs like Garageband store loops and samples in that folder and some applications store registration (serial number) info there too. And if you add 3rd party loops and samples they will usually go there. If you want to be safe I would also backup\n/Library/Application Support\n/Library/Preferences\nBut if you keep all your installers on external media and a record of all your serial numbers re-installing should be pretty painless without those folders.\nBut it should not be necessary to sync those folders between two Macs. In fact I would only sync ~/Documents, ~/Desktop and the folders that contain Mail and browser files and settings.\n", "Q: How many combinations of tags are there for a file? With the advent of Mavericks, files don't have only labels, they have tags. You can still use it just like labels (and have the classical 'work', 'home', 'urgent', 'to file', ... tags), but it is more powerful than that.\nThe difference with tags is that you can have multiple tags for one file (while there was one or none label).

I have seen methods such as using Disk Utility with the Mac HD as the source and a DVD as the destination.  This clones the existing installation and I do not want that.\nWhat I want is a minimal recovery environment just like the recovery partition but on a bootable CD.  The Macs that I am servicing do not have a recovery partition in place, if they did I'm sure I could disk util the source as the recovery partition and the destination as my CD.\nI do not currently have the retail Snow Leopard DVDs.\n\nA: Snow Leopard does not have a Recovery HD. That feature was introduced in OS X 10.7 Lion. You can't create Snow Leopard recovery disks either — that requires Lion too.\nTo create a bootable environment, you need to use the OS X installer. For this, you will need an install media to create the bootable partition. See:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I download Snow Leopard?\n\nA: If you have the installer for 10.7 10.8 you can install it this way. I have done it with 10.8 have not tried 10.9 (free). It will create recovery partition. Then boot to recovery partition. Go to Disk Utility. Erase the 10.8 (example) partition.

This is for a setup app which has streamlined interfaces for setting it up.\nWhat I've Tried\nI've tried going into the .app folder and loading the utility directly (./System/Library/CoreServices/Printer\\ Setup\\ Utility.app/Contents/MacOS/Printer\\ Setup\\ Utility ; )\nHowever this merely results in a new terminal window being opened with the command being run in the foreground. Attempting to run it in the background results in no window popup, so that didn't work either. Navigating to the directory in finder and running it from there results in the same thing. So far the only way I've gotten it to run is by doing it the \"proper\" way of running through the System Preferences utility.\nIn Summary\nHow do I run the Printer Setup Utility from the terminal such that it opens in a window, similar to how you would open it in the GUI?\n\nA: If you examine using ps the command launched by Printer Setup or when adding a printer through System Preferences, you'll note that it includes a -psn qualifier that directs the application as to the \"process serial number\" to use to communicate with the application. This effectively tells it how to connect and launch the windows necessary for the calling user/process and it's used for identifying various processes and instances of executables. \nUnfortunately its unclear how -- or even if -- you'd actually use this to launch from the command line as its usage is normally invoked from within another calling application using system calls and it seems to imply that you need to create certain \"Process Identification Constraints\" as part of the call out. \nMuch of this seems to be marked up in Apple's online documentation as being Deprecated in OS X v10.9 so I'm not sure what to make of this or how to direct you for using it as Apple seems to be advising against the sorts of systems calls that utilize it moving forward.

Here's a command that works fine when I paste it into the Mac Terminal window:\necho -n -e \\\\033]0\\;My Custom Window Title Here\\\\007 ; ping www.google.com\n\nIn particular, it sets the Terminal's title to include the string \"My Custom Window Title Here\", then starts pinging www.google.com.\nNow what I want to do is have the above command run in a separate Terminal window instead, so I enter this:\nosascript -e 'tell app \"Terminal\" to do shell script \"echo -n -e \\\\033]0\\;My Custom Window Title Here\\\\007 ; ping www.google.com\"'\n\n… but all I get is this error:\ndyld: DYLD_ environment variables being ignored because main executable\n(/usr/bin/osascript) is code signed with entitlements 59:60: syntax error: Expected “\"” but found unknown token.

I can listen to podcasts and music without wires to get in the way.  \nI have one small first-world problem.  If i want to type up a quick text message, it lags because it seems that for each character typed it has to play the sound on the bluetooth speaker.  It probably takes time to send each audio snippet.  This is not horrible, but oh well.  \nThe problem is much worse when I use speech recognition to \"type\" a message.  It insists on using the microphone on the bluetooth speaker and seeing how it is not right in front of me - the speech recognition fails almost always.  Or comes up with unbelievably hilarious renderings of what I said.\nSiri has a workaround for this: when I bring it up, it has a small bluetooth icon in the bottom left where I can select the audio source.  But the speech recognition applet on the keyboard does not.  \nOr am I missing something simple here?\nP.S.  I looked at the bluetooth references for the device - the only thing there is to \"Forget the Device\".\n\nA: I figured out my own answer, so hopefully this helps whomever runs into this problem.  \nBring up Siri by holding down the Home button.  It will come up and on the bottom left you'll see Audio source indicator, pictured below (and highlighted in yellow).\n\nAs you can see, it has a grey background.  Tap on it and you'll get a menu of audio sources (typically your phone and the Bluetooth device).  Select your phone.  The icon will get a white background indicate that you successfully changed the audio source.  \nNow switch back to your Text Messaging application and the tap the microphone button on the keyboard and it will now use the phone microphone instead of the one on the Bluetooth device.  \n\nA: Flick your phone on silent.

I was following this page: Anyone able to connect gioteck VX-1 (PS3 controller) via Bluetooth? to modify the bluetooth plist settings on my Mac to allow a Chinese PS3 controller to work with my Mac.\nSpecifically, I was trying to change the ClassOfDevice and Services. Because from what I can tell, the Chinese PS3 controllers are fully functional, they just don’t have the ClassOfDevice and Services stored in their Bluetooth chips. Thus my Mac thinks the device isn’t functional.\nUnfortunately, Mavericks seems to wipe out any changes I make to the plist as soon as I try to connect the controller over Bluetooth.\nDoes anyone know how to retain the changes to the Bluetooth Plist?\n\nA: I found the answer!\nMavericks caches preferences so you need to load your changes into Mavericks' cache.\nThe key is to do: defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist in terminal after making your changes to the bluetooth.plist and before turning bluetooth back on.\nSee here: https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/issues/1041#issuecomment-39808894 for a full writeup.\n", "Q: Where does OneNote for Mac store its notebook files? \"Create a new notebook\" with OneNote for Mac is not possible in offline mode. :(\nEditing and updating your notebook, however, works flawlessly in offline mode.\nMy question is: where does OneNote for Mac store its Notebook files (for offline work)?  \nAlso, I would love to find a workaround to use OneNote in offline mode and to block sync in my firewall.\n\nA: OneNote stores things in an application container in your user's Library folder.

The most interesting folder appeared to be OneNoteOfflineCache_Files, but when I tapped on each of the .onebin files, they appear to be just graphics files representing menus and such that you see when you're in OneNote.  \nThe only other folder with something in it was ServerListings and that has a single .onesrvcache file that doesn't look like it has data in it either.\nthen I took a look at OneNoteOfflineCache.onecache using TextWrangler.

I'm trying to run applications on a remote cluster via X11 ssh forwarding. I see everything with bad resolution, and guess this has to do with my retina display. I know that the same applications look good if installed on my local machine. Any ideas? Thanks!\n\nA: Yes, you are correct. The problem is X11, XQuartz and their lack of support for the Retina Display. This is a long known issue.\nIn the linked thread, jeremyhu states:\n\nX11 just doesn't work well for resolutions outside of the 72-90 DPI range. This is an upstream X11 issue that needs to be solved before we can really do anything about it in XQuartz.\n\n\nNot sure this will help you, but at least since last August, RealVNC has supported Retina displays.\n\nAlso you might try running X11 with your Retinia display at full resolution to see if this mitigates the issue. You can accomplish this with SwitchResX, among other software that is available to access other resolutions.\nSwitchResX is a commercial third party application, but it is available to try for free and for download. Probably because it is technically a hack to use the full resolution of Retina Displays, it appears to be unavailable on the Mac App Store.\n\nAnother option to try is using NoMachine's nxclient/nxserver technology. I can't find anything that says it has Retina Display support, but a post in their forums leads me to believe that there is at least some support for Retina Display resolutions in the current version.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut for prev/next sheet in Numbers 3 Is there a keyboard shortcut for moving to the next or previous sheet in Numbers 3?

Hardware is not my forte.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated =)\n\nA: There are two solutions, depending on the situation\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a computer-to-computer network. Doing this will cause you to lose your internet connection. To do this, follow the instructions from Apple:\n\n\n\nChoose Create Network from the Wi-Fi status icon in the menu bar.\n  If the icon isn’t in the menu bar, choose Apple menu > System Preferences, and then click Network. Click Wi-Fi and select the “Show Wi-Fi status in menu bar” checkbox.\nGive the network a name, and select a channel from the pop-up menu. The default channel is 11, but you can choose a different channel.\n  Select the Require Password checkbox to protect your network with a password. Type the password users will need to enter in order to join your network. Do the following:\n  Type a password of exactly 5 ASCII characters or 10 hexadecimal digits if you chose “40-bit WEP (more compatible)” from the Security pop-up menu.\nType a password of exactly 13 ASCII characters or 26 hexadecimal digits if you chose “128-bit WEP” from the Security pop-up menu.\nOther Wi-Fi-enabled computers within range can join the network you created by choosing it from their Wi-Fi status icon or by choosing it from the Network Name pop-up menu in the Wi-Fi pane of Network preferences.\n\nOnce you did that, connect your Mac mini to it. You can now access it from your browser.\n2.Share your internet connection. To do that, follow these instructions: \n\nChoose Apple menu > System Preferences and click Sharing.\n  Select Internet Sharing and click the checkbox if it isn’t checked.\n  Choose the Internet connection you want to share from the “Share your connection from” pop-up menu. For example, if you’re connected to the Internet over Ethernet, choose Ethernet.\n  Select how you want to share your Internet connection in the “To computers using” list. For example, if you want to share your Internet connection over AirPort, select AirPort.\n  If you share your Internet connection using AirPort, click AirPort Options and give your network a name and password.\n\nBasically, use an ethernet cable on one of you devices and share it to the other device using Airport.\n", "Q: Are number of desktops affecting memory? I use 8 desktops on my MBP for my different apps. Do you know if it can affect memory use?\n\nA: Having various applications open (on the same or on different desktops/spaces) requires much more memory than the desktops/spaces themselves. Even with different background pictures on every desktop the memory impact will be low compared to whatever else is going on on your machine.\n\nA: Look at it in another way: You don't have 8 desktops but you just have 1 desktop. The applications are bundled into groups and only certain groups of applications are shown on your desktop screen. When another application becomes active from another group, then the selected group will become active on your desktop. It feels like your have 8 desktops but in fact you only have 1. \nSo to answer your question: It will need more memory than a static desktop but I doubt it's even Noticeable.\n", "Q: How do I get out of the \"continuous pages\" mode?

And yes I have made sure that when I save it the \"Startup Screen\" option is NOT selected. \n\nThis dialog appears behind all other windows so I have no idea that it has happened and my app/script is stuck at this point.\nAny suggestions how to overcome this so I can run my script with no annoying dialogs or bouncing icons?\nThanks.\nEDIT: One idea that came to mind was to use the ExitTimeOut option in the plist file. The man page says:\nExitTimeOut <integer>\n    The amount of time launchd waits before sending a SIGKILL signal. The default value is 20 seconds. The\n    value zero is interpreted as infinity.\n\nSo I added it in like this:\n<key>ServiceDescription</key>\n    <string>Battery Monitor</string>\n<key>StartInterval</key>\n    <integer>30</integer>\n<key>ExitTimeOut</key>\n    <integer>90</integer>\n\nthen did unload/load of the .plist file. Unfortunately it doesn't appear to work. Am I understanding this option wrong?\n\nA: Convert to Shell Script and AppleScript Pair\nConvert your check for the battery status to a shell script. The shell script can then run regularly through a launchd job ticket without presenting any user interface.\nWhen the conditions are met, your shell script can launch an AppleScript to interact with the user.\nThis assumes you use an ~/Library/LaunchAgent approach for the launchd job ticket. A computer wide launchd job will not be able to launch the AppleScript component in the appropriate user session.\nAlternatively, you could use a third party tool to trigger on a battery event, such as Power Manager; this would avoid polling your battery and improve your battery's performance.\n", "Q: New DDR3 Memory for Mac Mini I bought a Mini last year and I want to update the RAM.\nI was shopping around to find some compatible memory and found (this)from a Spanish retailer.

I've been using it extensively for several days now, and strangely enough SSD is never used for reads... there are only a few writes to SSD every now and then, but still all the major processing is done via HDD.\nI expected it to be so for the first time while the SSD is being filled with new/frequently used data, but even when I write new files they tend to go to HDD rather than SDD. To test that I created 100MB files, and while the HDD was not full all writes were going to HDD.\nSo my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does it matter in which order physical volumes are listed in Corestorage logical volume group setup? How Corestorage chooses which drive is the best for immediate writes? Since it frees up some space on SSD when working on a genuine FusionDrive, it should know that it is \"better\" to do immediate writes on SSD rather than HDD.\n\n*Is there a way to \"change priority\" of physical drives within logical volume group? I assumed CoreStorage would \"know\" that SSD is a faster drive...\n\n\nThanks\n\nA: Q1:\nYes, it seems that the order of disks is important.\nAccording to the post of Jiri Hracek here: http://blog.macsales.com/17624-os-x-10-8-3-provides-fusion-drive-setup-option-for-non-fusion-drive-equipped-macs\nif you put the SSD at the second place, Fusion Drive is not working at all...\nThus, one possible way that Fusion Drive works it that is takes the first drive as the faster one, frees up spaces in the first one, and put the files in the second...\nQ2:\nit seems that there is not...\nSo your only choice seems to be recreating the Fusion Drive from scratch. Besides, I looked at my own SSD-HDD Fusion Drive, its order is SDD @ first as well...\n\nA: I'm two years late and who-knows-how-many dollars short at this point, but I just ran into this problem as well, and the solution above worked for me. I've documented all my steps in this gist\nMy backstory: when trying to wipe an iMac whose drive had been partitioned with Boot Camp, the new Disk Utility GUI beachballed and upon restart, the fusion drive had separated. I followed advice from SO to re-fuse the drive, but inadvertently put the HDD in front of the SSD.\ntl;dr these steps worked:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run diskutil list and grab the name of the physical SSD & HDD (disk3 and disk4 in my case)\n\n*Run diskutil cs create \"imac-fusion\" disk3 disk4, with the name of the SSD in front of the HDD (this must be where I messed up last time)\n\n*Run diskutil cs list and note the ugly GUID string of the newly created \"Logical Volume Group\", which in my case was DD1F3A9F-7171-4FDF-9994-9453A4C95109\n\n*Run diskutil cs createVolume \"DD1F3A9F-7171-4FDF-9994-9453A4C95109\" jhfs+ \"Macintosh HD\" 100%\nI just restored with Super Duper! and it works!\n", "Q: Reinstalling OS X on a MacBook with dead hard drive and no recovery disc So I got a MacBook (non pro) from a friend but the HDD is dead. After replacing it, I had no way to restore OS X and my friend can't find the recovery/reinstall disc.\nThe model seems too old for Internet recovery (A1181 Core Duo, not C2D) and DIY recovery tool on Apple's site says the Mac must have a \"recovery hd\", which I assume I don't have since the HDD is blank.\nAny alternatives? Is there a way to find the license using the serial of the machine?\n\nA: Since you say it's a Core Duo and not a Core 2 Duo, I think that you've got one of the original white (or black) MacBooks.  If I'm correct, you're not going to be able to install Mavericks (10.9) on it.  The latest OS that your MacBook will support is Snow Leopard.  If I'm correct that this is your MacBook, you will be able to get a Snow Leopard DVD from somewhere (you can order it from Apple for $20) and install it via the DVD.  If I haven't guessed your Mac correctly, you can use this checker to figure out which one you do have.\nIf you are close to an Apple Store, it's quite possible that they will reinstall its original OS onto it for you.  Set up an appointment at the Genius Bar, explain your predicament, and ask for their assistance.  \n\nA: Yes, there are so many ways to kill a cat :) \nYou can create a USB installer of Snow Leopard, Lion, Mountain Lion or even Mavericks.\nI can talk you through a process for each OS, or you could just take the computer to an Apple Store and they will stick the OS that came with the machine when it was purchased on it.  \nBut to create the installer yourself you will need another computer to achieve that. \n", "Q: Microsoft Word notebook layout - insert equation? Since transitioning to OSX for my everyday use, I've been using Word in notebook layout for taking notes (previously used OneNote on Windows). This works great.\nHowever, I need to insert, remove, and edit equations, and I don't want to hop in and out of print/notebook layout all the time..\nN.B. If the equation already exists, you can edit and remove it inside notebook layout. But to get it in the first place, you have to be (as far as I can tell) in print layout. This is insane.\n\nHow do you insert an equation in notebook layout?\n\nCannot figure this out at all. I really hope it's possible.. or if not that there is a good third-party plug-in.\nI've seen this - not relevant since I am using Office 2011, but I just can't find this option in notebook layout. Also, please don't suggest I use OneNote for Mac now that it's available. I took the time to convert to Word, and I prefer it now, taking note's in notebook layout, and keeping a good print layout automatically.\n\nA: One workaround is to assign a keyboard shortcut to inserting an equation.  This only gets you the ability to type an equation, not use the Equation Tools in the Ribbon.  You can also get the Equation Editor to open in a separate window via assigning a keyboard shortcut.  If this workaround is sufficient for you, it's fully documented here. \nThere is a third-party application called MathType for editing equations, and it works with many applications including Word:Mac.  If you know TeX/LaTeX, you can type that into MathType and it works magically.  However ... it doesn't work in the Notebook Layout View either.  I asked them about it via Twitter, and they said this:\n\nNo, but only because of the types of items Word allows to be inserted\n  in Notebook Layout View. No editable objects, only static.\n\nDon't forget to tell Microsoft that you want the full power of the Equation Editor (or MathType) in Word:Mac.  In Word's Help menu, there's a \"Send Feedback About Word\" link.  Tell them what you're doing and why this matters to you.  \n", "Q: Truecrypt install fails - 3 out of 6 hunks FAILED The first is just to show you where the installation is at this moment:\n\nn102:~ hendrikwindel$ brew info truecrypt\n  truecrypt: stable 7.1a\n  http://truecrypt.org/\n  Conflicts with: fuse4x\n  Not installed\n  From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/commits/master/Library/Formula/truecrypt.rb\n  ==> Dependencies\n  Build: pkg-config ✔, nasm ✔\n  Required: wxmac ✔, osxfuse ✔\n\nAnd now occurs the issue:\n\nn102:~ hendrikwindel$ brew install truecrypt\n  ==> Downloading ftp://ftp.archlinux.org/other/tc/truecrypt-7.1a.tar.gz\n  Already downloaded: /Library/Caches/Homebrew/truecrypt-7.1a.tar.gz\n  ==> Patching\n  patching file Main/Application.cpp\n  Hunk #1 succeeded at 36 with fuzz 2.\n  patching file Main/CommandLineInterface.cpp\n  patching file Main/Forms/Forms.cpp\n  Hunk #1 succeeded at 263 with fuzz 2.\n  Hunk #2 FAILED at 305.\n  Hunk #3 succeeded at 1443 with fuzz 2.\n  Hunk #4 FAILED at 1468.\n  Hunk #5 succeeded at 2894 with fuzz 2.\n  Hunk #6 FAILED at 2951.\n  3 out of 6 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file Main/Forms/Forms.cpp.rej\n  patching file Main/Forms/MainFrame.cpp\n  patching file Main/Forms/SelectDirectoryWizardPage.cpp\n  patching file Main/Forms/SelectDirectoryWizardPage.h\n  patching file Main/GraphicUserInterface.cpp\n  patching file Main/TextUserInterface.cpp\n  patching file Main/UserPreferences.cpp\n  patching file Platform/Unix/Process.cpp\n  Error: Applying DATA patch failed\n\nI have no idea what could be wrong.

I lost my phone 5/think it was stolen. \nI had \"Find My iPhone\" on it. The thing is it was very low on battery and by the time I realised it was gone I think the battery was done - it just showed \"device offline\". \nSo my question is, if somebody has taken the phone and has wiped it and is using it instead, would the Find My Iphone screen show anything different? Would there be some way to know that it can't be found again, or will I still be notified when they connect it to iTunes?\n\nA: With Find My iPhone activated this disables an activation when the phone is wiped from a different computer. The person would have to know your AppleID and password in order for the phone to be activated again (meaning use a SIM card and get reception). If they erase it, you should still be able to see the phone on your map. I would recommend not wiping the phone rather track it. \nThe commands become active the next time the device is powered on and gets a connection either via open WiFi or cell tower.\nYou won't get much in the way of information in regards to what they are doing with it. Tracking really is your best bet since it records the routes and allows you to follow the device, wiping it could make it easier for them to break into the phone and use it without your permission.\n\nA: sOnce the phone is wiped there is no way to find it.  However, I'm guessing you where using ios7 so if it was stolen, even with a wipe, thanks to the iOS7 activation lock that criminal will not be able to activate that phone without knowing your appleID information.\n", "Q: How to display the location of files with Spotlight?

The language setting on the phone is Norwegian, which means menus and such are all shown in Norwegian. The same goes for some \"inherent\" apps such as the iPhone weather app, which is also in Norwegian. I'm Norwegian, so that's all good.\nHowever, I've been living in Kazakhstan for the past year, and gradually (and weirdly) my phone seems to have picked up on the fact that I live in a Russian-speaking environment and maybe that I sometimes write in Russian. \nNow my Spotify app, all sorts of games and other apps automatically that I want to be in English have morphed into Russian, and there is no way to change the language to English.\nMy time zone is currently set to New York (I'm in the US at the moment), there is nothing in my settings saying I want stuff to be in Russian, but just now when I downloaded the game \"The Island\" the whole damn thing is in Russian, and there is no option to change language for it anywhere.\nWhat to do to?\n\nA: App's text localization works like this: The App retrieves the device's languages preferences order and appropriately displays the App's text in the first language that matches any of the ones that the App has implemented.   \nSo, at some point you probably changed your device's language to Russian, an it stuck as the secondary language. This means that as the App lacks the localized text in your primary language, Norwegian in this case, it displays it in the next possible language based on your preferences.\nBefore iOS 7, English was the device's unchangeable secondary language, but now it gets reordered with every language change you perform. So, you'll just have to rearrange the languages in your desired order. To do so just:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings / General / International / Language\n\n*Select English or any other language you'll be comfortable with as a secondary one.\n\n*Tap Done\n\n*Once the device's language has been changed, change it back to Norwegian\n", "Q: make it easier to call often used terminal commands I have a java tool that I use quite often from the command line but to use it I have to type java -jar dsim.jar.

worst Antivirus software available for OSX. Uninstall it, and its associated drivers, according to the developer's instructions. If the uninstaller still leaves traces of the software on the machine, then you need to manually unload and then delete the kernel extensions.\nAdditionally, you have made other low level system modifications which may be a catalyst. If the panics continue, uninstall the software associated with each driver in descending order until they cease.\nMost often, kernel panics are caused by third party kernel extensions which are either deprecated or incompatible. In order to resolve them, these extensions must be removed.\n\nA: Regardless of Messages being identified as a possible suspect, I find that highly unlikely, as that is Apple software running on Apple hardware. I'd be willing to bet that it is your Avast software, which should only be necessary if you often use the machine in a Windows network with Windows users. Avast on OS X really has no benefit to the Mac user, and only helps protect other platforms from Windows viruses that may have entered into your own files. Surprisingly, Avast includes an uninstaller with their installer, if you'd like to remove it to see if the kernel panics cease.\n\nA: Google has admitted there is a well know bug with the graphic drivers in MacBooks using Chrone. Other applications such as Firefox have the same problem with hardware acceleration.\nIn my case I solved these panics disabling hardware acceleration in Firefox (Preferences->Advanced->General) and Thunderbird. I am not using Chrone.\n", "Q: No Batteries Available ?-How to Check battery health on MacBook Pro early 2011 A few days ago, I went on vacation and unplugged power cable from my MacBook Pro 13' early 2011 and then I got back home, the battery was not detected by OS and didn't charge.\nI then understood that I had automatic startup configured and the laptop did power ON next morning then I was not at home. The battery was discharged completely.\nI tried to restart, to power down and unplug power cable, I also tried to did SMC reset, but that didn't work.\nWhat's the most reliable way to check the health status of the battery? - I want to replace it, but I want to be completely sure that this is the battery, and not something else.\nBattery is about 3 years old and about 250 cycles.\nThe battery icon is the same as below:\n\nUPD1:\n\n\n\nI did run AHT and it returns the following error code:\n4xxx/1/40000000: \"Battery\"\nI plan to perform extended testing as well later today to see if any other errors appear, but it looks like the culprit of the issue is battery.\n\nThe battery Condition now is Replace Now.\nThe status changed after I unplugged power cable for a couple of days and then I plugged the cable and the laptop started, the battery status changed to Replace Now.\nI will shortly check it with another battery and perhaps replace the old one.\nUPD2:\nI've tested my MacBook with similar working battery and it did detected the battery and worked fine and this is the good news.\nOn the other hand I now need to have the battery replaced.\nUPD: Eventually, I now have replaced battery and it all looks OK.\nThe laptop is running smoothly either connected to AC power or on battery.\n\nA: All the information you get from fancy 3d party is already in your system (that is where they get it from anyway).\nOpen your About This Mac, more info, system report and find Power:\nIt will tell you all about your battery.\nIt looks like this on my system:\n\nNormally the Battery will keep a small reserve charge to be able to report its status to the computer. In your case somehow it was sucked dry completely :) \nThe good news is it is the battery, since your SMC is working and everything else is working based on the message \"Replace battery\". That same message was probably run all the time during your vacation, till the battery was exhausted to the level were the battery build in chip did not have enough power to talk to your OS. As for what caused that drain? did you leave your computer in a sleep mode ?\n\nA: Looks like your battery is dead, go get a new one.\nDepending on where you live you need to get a new one from Apple or you might find cheaper batteries from a 3rd party vendor.\n\nA: there are several apps you can download that show the battery health.\nI use stat pro from bjango it isn't free anymore but it has a 14 day trial which should be long enough to check your battery.\n\nA: Hold ⌥ and click on the battery icon in the menu bar. This shows up a new menu entry labled Condition.\n\nA: Take Coconut Battery. \nIt's free and will show the health of your battery:\n\n\nA: The MacBook battery doesn’t last long if you use it continuously. You should have a close look at its serviceability and its status to not find dead when you need it the most.\nI had the same problem with me, I was searching on google and I found a really amazing guide about How to check battery health on MacBook You can see here.\n", "Q: Full path to python as reported by ps When I run python from the shell I for example do python2.7 script.\nI later need to find this command again based on the ps aux output, however this output shows a full absolute path like this:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python\n\nI am unsure how I can resolve python2.7 to the path above. I tried to install realpath (brew install coreutils), and ran realpath `which python2.7`, however that is not giving the exact same path, it gives:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python2.7\n\nI also tried python -c \"import os; print os.path.realpath('/usr/bin/python2.7')\" but that gives the same different path.\nWhy the difference and is there any way I can resolve to the other path ?\n\nA: Is that what you want  ? \n>>> import sys\n>>> sys.executable\n/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python\n\n", "Q: AppleScript to show package contents of hidden original of alias I'm attempting to build an Automator workflow (which will be saved as a Service, so that I can both access it from contextual menus and invoke it with a keyboard shortcut), that will function much like the Finder's built-in \"Show Package Contents\" command, but which will additionally accept a package's alias as input. The service will satisfy the following:\nIt will only be available when the Finder's selection consists of a package or a package's alias.\nRather than show the contents of the package directory itself like the built-in command does, the Service will show the contents of the \"Contents\" directory (if it exists), located immediately within the package directory.\nIf the Finder's selection is a package or alias on the desktop, the Contents directory should be opened in a new Finder window. Otherwise, the Contents directory should be opened in the Finder window containing the selection.\nMy approach has been to have the script first determine whether the file is an Alias, and if it is, to tell the script to show the contents of the original. If the file is not an alias, I'd like to tell the script to simply show the contents of the input.\nExcluding the possibility of an alias as input and assuming the input-package is selected in a Finder window, I can successfully write a script that shows the contents of the package's contents folder in the same window:\non run {input, parameters}\n    set my_output to {}\n    repeat with oneItem in input\n        tell application \"Finder\" to set target of window 1 to ((oneItem as text) & \"Contents\")\nend repeat\nreturn input\nend run\n\nWhen I try to set up an \"if...then...else\" scheme, I fail.\nI'm using the latest versions of all relevant software.\n\nA: You can try something like this:\n   on run {input, parameters}\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        repeat with oneItem in input\n            if kind of oneItem = \"Alias\" then set oneItem to oneItem's original item\n            set contentsPath to (oneItem as text) & \"Contents\"\n            if oneItem's container as text = (path to desktop as text) then\n                open contentsPath\n            else\n                set target of window 1 to contentsPath\n            end if\n            activate\n        end repeat\n    end tell\nend run\n\nYou may also want to include a test to make sure the input is the expected type.\n\nA: folder \"Contents\" of also works with aliases:\non run {input, parameters}\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        repeat with f in input\n            open folder \"Contents\" of f\n        end repeat\n    end tell\nend run\n\nYou can also assign a shortcut for showing package contents from System Preferences:\n\nCommand-R shows the original file of an alias.\n\nA: I got it:\non run {input, parameters}\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        repeat with f in input\n            reveal f\n            set target of window 1 to (folder \"Contents\" of f as text)\n        end repeat\n    end tell\nend run\n\n", "Q: iPhone stuck at Apple bootup after attempted evasi0n deletion I have an iPhone  5c, I have it jailbroken, and I was trying to take it off.

For example, if I have 2 Safari windows open. One is minimized and I have focus on the other one, how do I open the minimized one with out using the mouse?\nI found ⌘-` activates the next open window in the frontmost application, which will cycle through the open windows.\nHow do I get to a window that is minimized?\n\nA: This may seem complicated, although after you've done it a few times and use it regularly you'll have it down. Depending on if you have other windows minimized you may have to tap the left or right arrow keys on the last step to pull up the window you're wanting un-minimized.\n\nWhile holding ⌘ tap tab followed by ←\n  then ↓ twice, then press return\n( keep ⌘ pressed the until after you've tapped the initial\n  ↓ )\n\n\nA: If you haven't enabled minimizing windows to the application icon, you can press control-F3 to move focus to the Dock, and then select the window with the arrow keys and press return.\n\n\n", "Q: How to automount SSHFS volumes with FUSE OS X on Mavericks Iv'e managed to get my ssh volumes mounted with SSHFS via the command line but would really like is to have them auto mount on login. So far, I've set up a launchAgent to run a shell script that contains the commands I would use in the terminal. That contains:\nmkdir /Volumes/mysshfsvolume\nsshfs blah blah blah\n\nThis works via the terminal but when the launchAgent loads, It seems momentarily mount the volumes and then they disappear.\nI have seen other older solutions that include editing the /etc/fstab, AppleSrcipt and automator but I am looking for a Mavericks related solution. I have actually found a way around it using ControlPlane but just wondering if anybody has more extensive knowledge of how automount works on Mavericks. TIA.\nJust to add some information, I'm not too familiar with the systems that I'm logging into but one is a SUN Solaris and the other is a RHE linux server.\nI also tried just adding the script to my login items and it works for the linux connection but not the SUN server.\n\nA: I have using Homebrew and its sshfs bundle to mount SSH filesystems on my Mavericks Mac for a while now, it has been solid.\nSo if you run Homebrew go ahead and try the following to install sshfs: brew install sshfs. Then maybe reboot (?) and once you're back sshfs <username>@<hostname/IP>:<remote-path> <local-path>. You will get a password prompt at this point if you're using that kind of authentication. If you're using SSH keys then probably no prompt.\nUpdate: maybe you should modify your bash script to use nohup. it sounds almost like the process dies after it runs your bash script. checkout nohup on wiki or man nohup.\n\nA: Make sure you set up SSH keys with both servers you're trying to connect to. Once you've done this, you can create a simple shell script to connect to your server. Something like this should do:\n#!/bin/bash\nmkdir /Volumes/mysshfsvolume\nsshfs blah blah blah\n\nOnce you've got your shell script set up, you can set it up to run at login by using plist files. plist files for Mac are like supercharged cron jobs. You can set them up to run at specific intervals, run at system boot, or run when a certain user logs in. In your case, you would want it to run every time you log in. You can glean some more info from this Stack question:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/1370901/very-simple-launchd-plist-not-running-my-script\n(just a side note)\nIf you happen to use a server host like Digital Ocean which provides an API, you can get even fancier with your script and use the API to automatically find every server on your account, and auto mount each one at login. I had a neat script set up that SSHFS'd all of my servers on my DO account, and even picked up new ones when they were added.\n", "Q: How can my son access my iTunes account from his windows 8 'sign on' on my computer? I want my son to be able to access my full iTunes library without signing in to my Microsoft account on my Windows 8 pc.  He has his own Microsoft account/sign in. I have tried Home Sharing, but this seams only to work if he has a different computer (and we only have this one). I do not want to create a separate iTunes account for him.  When he opens iTunes and looks at the songs list, he can see some, but not all of the songs in my library.

I was connecting to iTunes but I never backed up.\nHow can I get all my photos and apps on my iPhone 5 without a back up? \nI was able to restore my apps from iTunes, but its like new again, how can I include the data inside the applications?\n\nA: But if you have a apple ID you can get apps back by simply downloading them on device with no extra fee\n\nA: Since you have NO back up there is no place where your data could come from (they are lost).\nSorry, but next time do a back up before doing stuff like Factory reset.\n", "Q: Pages 5.1 underlines some words as misspelled, but does not allow me to \"Ignore/Learn Spelling\" I am using Pages 5.1. When I misspell words, spellchecker underlines them in red. I am usually able to either \"Ignore Spelling\" or \"Learn Spelling\" when I right-click the word:\n\nBut for some words, those options do not appear despite spellchecker underlining them in red:\n\nThis can be particularly annoying when I use recurring names. Why can't I \"Ignore Spelling\" or \"Learn Spelling\" on these words? And is there a way to fix it?\n\nA: I create technical papers, and many words are not recognized by spellchecker. Some words can be learned using control-click but most can't be used at all until added to the dictionary. This is very annoying and time-consuming.\nThe one things that helps me add words is to use the arrow cursor keys to move the insertion point to the end of the word or past the space and then back a space to \"jog\" the software into letting you add the word.\nIf that fails, quitting the app or restarting is sometimes effective. \n\nA: I am afraid there is nothing you can do because it is not a misspelled word! \nIf it needs no editing, does it matter whether spellcheck recognizes words or not?\nIt is just indicating that word since it is not a part of normal vocabulary giving you chance to look it up since there are multiple Meinhard out there.\nHowever:\nOn a Mac with OS X one can add or remove custom words which are located in the \n\n~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary\n\n", "Q: Mac App Store opens to blank screen; cannot switch between menu options Today I tried opening the App Store to update some software, but when it opens I am left with a blank screen:\n\nAlso, when I click on the menu items in the top bar, multiple items will highlight in blue (but the blank screen will not change):\n\nDoes anyone know why this is happening?

Then relaunched App Store and it started working.\n\nA: I just had this problem, poked around online, and solved it by resetting the NVRAM.

Go to Preference, Network, advance button at bottom, then look at the DNS tab.  I found both DNS Servers and Search Domains were blank.  Added my DNS info and Domains to search. Started to work. :)\n\nA: Same problem. Tried all the solutions mentioned in this and other threads. Opened iTunes on a whim and saw the system could not authenticate the various CERTS associated with Apple. Looked that up. Found that the solution was to purge your current key store and then reboot. Voila.\nIn my case, I'm assuming my keystore \"corruption\" happened because of a system lock up which required a hard reboot. But this solved it.\n\nA: Certificate solution did not work for me, reboot did not work for me.\nKilled storeuid process under my user account, opened App Store and it was fixed.\n\nA: I've been having the same issue under OS X 10.11 El Capitan where the App Store would open to a blank page and no errors were listed.\nThe main solutions I have seen on multiple sites are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Kill \"store\" Processes (see this thread)\n\n*Zap NVRAM (Used to be called PRAM) [Reboot and hold down command-option-p-r until it cycles through the reboot sound 2-3 times]\n\n*Use the terminal commands to delete preference files (plist)\n\n*Remove Anti-Virus/Mal-ware software\n\n*Check network settings and remove any proxies\n\n*In the App Store Go to the Store menu and \"Sign Out\"\n\n\n#4 and #5 didn't apply to me\nI did perform #3 but didn't see any help from that.\nWhat worked for me was a combination of killing the processes (#1), restarting the App Store, and \"Sign Out\" (#6). Which worked great -- I had a bunch of pending updates.\nBut then I rebooted and the issue of the empty App Store came back. This time I tried just the \"Sign Out\" and that didn't work. Killed the processes and opened the App Store and it worked.\nI'm going to experiment with the NVRAM zapping and see if that works on a permanent basis. Otherwise I'll open up a bug report with Apple.\n\nA: I had the same problem today..tried rebooting and working fine now.  \n\nA: I'm new to Mac and I thought my App Store wasn't working as all buttons were greyed out. Turns out I had no Internet connection :-(\nI feel a bit stupid but you'd think OSX would pop up a quick error message telling me that.\n\nA: First, close the app store or itunes, etc. I fixed this by opening a terminal, then getting a super user terminal: sudo su - enter your password now be careful. You are root.\nNext we want to kill all the App Store related processes. This doesn't hurt anything. Let's find them using the ps command and then using the grep search utility to get down to what we want.\nMacBook-Pro:~ root# ps -ef |grep store |grep -vi google\n  501  9284     1   0 21Dec15 ??         0:08.90 /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CommerceKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/storeassetd\n  501  9349     1   0 21Dec15 ??         0:00.73 /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CommerceKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/storeinappd\n  501  9353     1   0 21Dec15 ??         0:01.91 /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CommerceKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/storedownloadd\n  501  9459     1   0 21Dec15 ??         0:00.17 /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CommerceKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/storelegacy\n\nThe second column is the process ID we want.

I have also read other ways - removing some verisign keys from the key chain app, and others, but this is what fixed me.\n", "Q: Xcode 5.1 won't launch -- \"being updated\" -- but already installed trying to launch Xcode 5.1 and keep getting \"Xcode is being updated\". It was updated last week and shows as installed. Screen shots to illustrate. Any ideas? I went to the developer portal, but it takes you to the App Store (I was hoping there was a seperate install).

I'm able to move the cursor and even control applications (for instance, unpause iTunes) by clicking blindly, but the image on screen won't update.\nOne surefire way to reproduce it is to connect to the computer through VNC causing the computer will switch to the discrete graphics. I then close the VNC client on my phone and use a hot corner to put the display to sleep. Whenever the VNC server realizes the client disconnected, it switches back to the integrated graphics, triggering the bug. This is not exclusive to VNC though, as I can trigger this bug with any application that uses discrete graphics.\nHere's the relevant log:\n4/2/14 13:18:53.902 screensharingd[274]: Authentication: SUCCEEDED :: User Name: user :: Viewer Address: 192.168.1.12 :: Type: DH\n4/2/14 13:18:54.159 WindowServer[100]: Received display connect changed for display 0x4280382\n4/2/14 13:18:54.182 WindowServer[100]: Found 62 modes for display 0x04280382 [36, 26]\n4/2/14 13:18:54.206 WindowServer[100]: Received display connect changed for display 0x3f003f\n4/2/14 13:18:54.206 WindowServer[100]: Found 1 modes for display 0x003f003f [1, 0]\n4/2/14 13:18:54.206 WindowServer[100]: Received display connect changed for display 0x3f0040\n4/2/14 13:18:54.207 WindowServer[100]: Found 1 modes for display 0x003f0040 [1, 0]\n4/2/14 13:18:54.207 WindowServer[100]: Received display connect changed for display 0x3f0041\n4/2/14 13:18:54.207 WindowServer[100]: Found 1 modes for display 0x003f0041 [1, 0]\n4/2/14 13:18:54.218 WindowServer[100]: CGXMuxAcknowledge: Posting glitchless acknowledge\n4/2/14 13:18:54.229 WindowServer[100]: MPAccessSurfaceForDisplayDevice: Set up page flip mode on display 0x04280382 device: 0x7fd5fd100be0  isBackBuffered: 1 numComp: 3 numDisp: 3\n4/2/14 13:18:54.253 WindowServer[100]: Received display connect changed for display 0x4280382\n4/2/14 13:18:54.254 WindowServer[100]: Found 1 modes for display 0x04280382 [1, 0]\n4/2/14 13:18:58.000 kernel[0]: pci pause: SDXC\n4/2/14 13:19:01.261 WindowServer[100]: _CGXSetWindowBackgroundBlurRadius: Invalid window 0xffffffff\n4/2/14 13:19:01.282 loginwindow[68]: find_shared_window: WID -1\n4/2/14 13:19:01.283 loginwindow[68]: CGSGetWindowTags: Invalid window 0xffffffff\n4/2/14 13:19:01.283 loginwindow[68]: find_shared_window: WID -1\n4/2/14 13:19:01.283 loginwindow[68]: CGSSetWindowTags: Invalid window 0xffffffff\n4/2/14 13:19:01.372 WindowServer[100]: device_generate_desktop_screenshot: authw 0x7fd5fd04fdc0(2000), shield 0x7fd5fae43ba0(2001)\n4/2/14 13:19:01.391 WindowServer[100]: device_generate_lock_screen_screenshot: authw 0x7fd5fd04fdc0(2000), shield 0x7fd5fae43ba0(2001)\n4/2/14 13:19:01.534 com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[154]: (com.apple.SystemUIServer.agent[167]) The following job tried to hijack the service \"com.apple.tsm.uiserver\" from this job: 0x7fd1b3609f20.anonymous.loginwindow\n4/2/14 13:19:14.139 loginwindow[68]: ERROR | -[LWBuiltInScreenLockAuthLion closeAuthAndReset:] | Attempted to remove an observer when not observing\n4/2/14 13:19:14.174 WindowServer[100]: CGXDisplayDidWakeNotification [45457018136]: posting kCGSDisplayDidWake\n4/2/14 13:19:14.175 WindowServer[100]: handle_will_sleep_auth_and_shield_windows: Deferring.\n4/2/14 13:19:14.320 WindowServer[100]: Received display connect changed for display 0x4280382\n4/2/14 13:19:14.341 WindowServer[100]: Found 29 modes for display 0x04280382 [18, 11]\n4/2/14 13:19:14.371 WindowServer[100]: Received display connect changed for display 0x4280382\n4/2/14 13:19:14.372 WindowServer[100]: Found 1 modes for display 0x04280382 [1, 0]\n4/2/14 13:19:14.372 WindowServer[100]: current_mode_index: Failed to find current {ioModeID, ioModeDepth}\n4/2/14 13:19:14.386 WindowServer[100]: Received display connect changed for display 0x3f003f\n4/2/14 13:19:14.386 WindowServer[100]: Found 1 modes for display 0x003f003f [1, 0]\n4/2/14 13:19:14.386 WindowServer[100]: Received display connect changed for display 0x3f0040\n4/2/14 13:19:14.386 WindowServer[100]: Found 1 modes for display 0x003f0040 [1, 0]\n4/2/14 13:19:14.386 WindowServer[100]: Received display connect changed for display 0x3f0041\n4/2/14 13:19:14.387 WindowServer[100]: Found 1 modes for display 0x003f0041 [1, 0]\n4/2/14 13:19:14.400 WindowServer[100]: CGXMuxAcknowledge: Posting glitchless acknowledge\n4/2/14 13:19:14.401 WindowServer[100]: CGXMuxAcknowledge: Posting immediate acknowledge\n4/2/14 13:19:14.487 WindowServer[100]: MPAccessSurfaceForDisplayDevice: Set up page flip mode on display 0x04280382 device: 0x7fd5fd100be0  isBackBuffered: 1 numComp: 3 numDisp: 3\n4/2/14 13:19:14.490 WindowServer[100]: Received display connect changed for display 0x4280382\n4/2/14 13:19:14.491 WindowServer[100]: Found 1 modes for display 0x04280382 [1, 0]\n4/2/14 13:19:14.491 WindowServer[100]: Display 0x04280382 changed state to offline\n4/2/14 13:19:14.525 WindowServer[100]: No display devices are on-line.

If either device is trying to use 3G or 4G, you will struggle to establish or maintain a decent connection.\nTo test this, I would ensure you are both on a good wifi connection and try it again to see how it works. If not, then you have deeper compatibility issues.\nP.S. I would recommend upgrading your iPhone 4 to iOS 7.1. It has improved performance over 7.0.x and will help alleviate further compatibility issues.\n\nA: I no longer have this issue. What I did before trying to call again was to delete /var/logs/AppleSupport/general.log which was 10MB in size. I don't know if this has any correlation with the failure of the calls. If anyone has similar issue maybe you can try removing this file (if your iPhone was jailbroken).\n", "Q: How to login as a different bash user in terminal?

I am currently dealing with a stalking situation and my iPhone 4 is being monitored. The person knows all my phone info like meid, imei, phone number etc…  Also I believe my phone has spy software on it. \nI have removed this before by restoring the phone to factory conditions through iTunes, however, I now think they can install it remotely. If I use an app that does SMS encryption in your opinion do you think that will keep my texts private?\n\nA: It is extremely improbable that your iPhone 4 with the latest software, without jailbreak, has a spyware on it, especially if nobody else than you had physical access to your phone after jailbreak.\nHowever if someone has remote access to your phone communications through \"encrypted\" messagging apps should be quite safe for itself, but if you have a spyware on your phone be sure that someone could see you screen as you see it, for example when you type and read messages in the \"encrypted app\".\n\nA: Unless your iPhone 4 is jailbroken, it is very unlikely that anyone can remotely install any spyware. It would normally require physical access to your phone, along with your passcode, then your Apple ID and password as well.\nA more plausible possibility is that this person knows your iCloud or Apple ID and password, and is logged into your iCloud account so he/she can see your messages.\nI would go here and change your Apple ID / iCloud password immediately.\n", "Q: Macbook pro keeps returning to login window No matter what settings I apply within System Preferences, after a time of inactivity the login screen pops up.

See the closed ticket: ticket 8895.\nTry DCommander for SCP on Mac.\n\nA: It looks like Fugu does scp and even won an Apple Design Award for best use of open source (in 2003). \nEdit:\nDownside: it is a PPC app, so doesn't work unless you are still on Snow Leopard.\n\nA: I can confirm cyberduck works fine in Yosemite, too.\nUsing Java downloaded from Oracle site.\nCyberduck DOES use SCP, i regularly use it.\nSome problems seem arise on simple PFTP site (port 21) for timeouts.\n\nA: Cyberduck 4.4 or later requires no Java installation.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Retina screenshot in higher resolution than the native? I have a mid 2012 MacBook Pro Retina. The native (i.e. maximum supporter built-in display resolution) is, as far as I know, 2880x1800. So far so good. Then I went to resolution settings and slided it all the way right, to the highest offered by the system. No other resolution apps, just the standard OS X setting.\nI took a screenshot (shift-command-3). Clicked on it and chose Get Info.\nThe resolution of the picture was 3588x2276.\nThe Photoshop shows the same resolution.\nHow can this be?\n\nA: By selecting the far-right setting for resolution within System Preferences, you are seemingly increasing the screen resolution to a value greater than 2880x1800. This is exactly why you are seeing an image with greater dimensions.\nWhat the display settings allow you to do is scale resolutions so words and images all appear larger or smaller on the display screen yet all fit within the physical display (through scaling). \nThat being said, any scaled resolution may not offer the same image quality as the \"Best (Retina)\" setting depending on the application etc. \nAlso, the fact that your graphics performance will vary when scaling the resolutions indicates that your computer is using system resources to compute/adjust/scale what your display projects. This is how the resolution appears to be more, or less, than what the hardware should support.\nEach alternate resolution will be higher or lower in dimension but scaled down/up to fit the display window.\n", "Q: Screencasting in 1080p from a retina display without scaling, possible or not? I want to make some tutorials in 1080p on my MacBook Pro with retina display. Is there a way to record the screen \"natively\" in 1920x1080? I don't care if it would look scaled and blury at the time I'm recording it. Also, I wouldn't mind if I had black bars up and down (due to the different ratio). I just want to have a sharp 1080p video as the final result (a video that will be as sharp on YouTube, when it's switched to 1080p playback).\nHas anyone tried it? Any suggestions, preferably experiences? Thanx...\n\nA: After much searching and toying with various programs I finally found one that did exactly what I wanted.\nhttp://www.madrau.com/\nNow I have this fancy menu that I can use to quickly change my screen resolution.\n\nI record my screen at 1280 x 720 HiDPi (720p). It puts black bars on the top and bottom of my screen, but for recording purposes that's totally fine. You can also record at 1920 x 1080 if you need 1080p, but I find that text gets really tiny at that resolution; with 720p I only need to zoom my text editor in slightly.\n\nA: Just for your information. We recently did a precise 1080P * 1920P screen recording video on macOS using all free tools. Please see the detailed steps in this post \"Do Precise 1080P Screen Recording Video With All Free Tools on macOS\" on Medium.\nIn response to the comment, updated with the essential part of the solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use QuickTime Player to do screen recording and clip editing;\n\n*Use VLC Media Player to do canvas crop and scale;\n\n\nUse cropadd video filter and transcode/stream (export). This is the most tricky part. If you need more details to figure it out how to do this, please refer to the above linked post.\n\nImportant Tips: 1) Use ctrl + scroll (mouse or trackpad counterpart gesture) to zoom screen to find out precise pixels to crop; 2) Deselect any “Repeat xx” option in the Playback menu when exporting video (Convert & Stream); 3) The advanced features of VLC are not that user friendly, so please be careful.\n\n\n*Use FFmpeg to do video rotation transform. \n\n\nUse FFmpeg to rotate video as 1920p * 1080p, so QuickTime could handle:\n$ ~/Applications/ffmpeg -i 5.5inch-v1-cropped1.m4v -vf “transpose=1” 5.5inch-v1-cropped1-rotated1.m4v\n\nand rotate it back at the end:\n$ ~/Applications/ffmpeg -i 5.5inch-v1-cropped1-rotated1-edited1.mov -vf “transpose=2” 5.5inch-v1-cropped1-rotated1-edited1-final1.mov\n\n", "Q: Is there a keyboard shortcuts for switching tabs at Safari?

Googling yields a few Apple threads which tell you to readd the files one by one which is useless; that just bypasses the check instead of fixing the actual issue.\n\nA: Try breaking the ITL file & make iTunes rebuild it\nFirst, move the existing iTunes Library.itl to the desktop, just in case.\nDon't touch the .xml, just the .itl file.\nIt can be found in ~/Music/iTunes/\nThen… \n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the existing ITL if you left a copy in the iTunes folder.\n\n*Open Terminal & enter this touch ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes\\ Library.itl That will create an empty ITL file, broken enough for this.\n\n*Launch iTunes. It will now notice something is 'wrong' & start rebuilding the ITL file, using your existing XML file. The message is 'Importing ‘iTunes Music Library.xml’ This will take some time, maybe 15 minutes or so, depending on your Library size.\nBreaking it rather than not having any .itl file there at all makes the difference between several minutes & several hours for the rebuild.\nYou may find some album artwork missing - it never seems to be a truly perfect solution, but your play counts, playlists etc should all survive intact.\n\nA: I've been going nuts with this determining gapless playback nonsense. I realize this is a very old video, but thought I'd share my stop-gap (no pun intended) solution. I'm using http://www.freerip.com/ to rip actual cds. When you are adding songs to your iTunes library, choose the \"add file\" instead of \"add folder\" option. Same thing with any downloaded albums. This, for whatever reason, does not seem to kick off the determine gapless playback function. It's a shame that iTunes has such a problem handling this for its customers, but this seems to be working for me in the meantime. I'm just posting this in any threads I've found useful for future people facing this issue.\n", "Q: Is there a way to use an account for FileVault2 volume-decryption without logging it on? I recall a key-combination, in a pre-Mavericks OSX, that could be pressed after entering one account's info for initial startup FileVault volume decryption. The key-combo prevented a full login of that account, instead dropping again to the login prompt, for login via another account. \nHowever, I can no longer find any reference to this capability, nor re-discover the combination through trial-and-error. \nDoes this option still exist? It was convenient. \n(Of course, I can immediately log-off that FileVault account. But in addition to that extra step, when next logging-into my real work account, I never get the question that allows cancelling the annoying re-opening of all apps open at the last crash.)\n\nA: I'm not aware of the key-combination.\nHowever, here's how I did this on Mavericks (10.9.2):\n\n\n*\n\n*Click System Preferences\n\n*Click Users & Groups\n\n*If the Lock icon is closed, click the lock icon and authenticate\n\n*Click Login Options\n\n*Locate Network Account Server and click Edit (if there is a network server) or Join (if there is not)\n\n*Click Open Directory Utility\n\n*If the Lock icon is closed, click the lock icon and authenticate\n\n*Click Directory Editor icon\n\n*Search for the user you want to restrict\n\n*Click the user name\n\n*Expand Authentication Authority\n\n*Click the + - to the right of Authentication Authority, not the one at the bottom of the window!\n\n*Change new value to ;UserDisabled;\n\n*Click Save\nThe user can unlock the FileVault, but cannot login.\n\nA: There's a way to set the FileVault 2 login process on Mavericks so that you're stopped at the OS login window after logging in at the FileVault 2 login window.\nThe way to do this is to disable FileVault 2's automatic login, which is the process that the OS uses to automatically log you into your account after you've logged in at the FileVault 2 pre-boot login screen. Apple has a KBase article here that shows how to do this:\nOS X: How to disable automatic login when FileVault is enabled\nAfter that, reboot your Mac and login at the FileVault 2 pre-boot login screen using your non-work account's password. When the OS unlocks and boots, you should then be stopped at the OS login window. At that point, login with your work account's username and password.\n", "Q: Is there a free app like Sublime Text 2 on iPad? Is there a free app like Sublime Text 2 on iPad that can read code and have Syntax Highlighting? \n\nA: Take a look at Textastic.\nI've tried many others Code, Diet Coda, etc. While they all have some decent features, nothing is quite up to par yet all around in comparison to Textastic in my opinion (especially if you like Sublime Text). \n\nA: Best I've come across AND use daily is Koder! Codeanywhere looked the most promising and had the best UI but the worst experience and support (response to an email asking why it constantly crashed whenever I tried to connect via ftp) came after 3 weeks and didn't even try to answer the question. Koder... I'm sure has even worse support but I never had to reach out so Koder wins. I've tried them all as my iPad is all that's left at the moment while I save for a new MacBook pro for my Deving purposes. Love Koder and isn't too far from the slick CodeAnywhere ui but it frickin works. Got a few suggestions as the uploading (copy paste) method is not intuitive at all but the doc has video and if you follow it exactly it works. It's got WebDAV, ftp, Dropbox, syntax highlighting, custom keyboard for commonly used functions and characters and actually substitutes for the lack of a proper file system management tool in iOS. It's like $5 bucks but it but worth it. I can't believe no one mentions it.\n", "Q: Delete an app completely (special case) and question regarding empty trash I downloaded a game and deleted it by just Holding it for few second and click x on the launchpad, because I can still see it occupies 20 GB in my hard disk which is truly annoying.

THANKS\nN.B.I'm currently using the newest model of Mac book pro.\nSituation: I deleted the file (by just holding it for few second and press the cross) but it still occupied 20 GB... Is there any way to get the space back?\n\nA: All the apps installed from the App Store are stored in the /Applications folder.\nGo to the Applications folder (Finder menu -> Go -> Applications or check the Finder window sidebar for this folder), check if the app you want to delete is present there. If it isn't, then it's gone. Else, move it to Trash and then empty it.\nIf it doesn't help, please clarify how are you determining that 20GB is still occupied by the app.\n\nA: I suggest you to use Clean My Mac for uninstalling software, it use 35mb of storage and its very useful because it delete all the info and stuff of the program, with this you`ll avoid this kind of problems.\n", "Q: How does Mac OS keep track of moved files? An application I was using had a .dockset file stored in my home directory. I moved this file, and the application automatically updated the location of the file. I notice a similar effect when moving files that I'm currently editing in apps like Xcode, TextEdit, BBEdit, Preview, iWork, etc.\nHow does Mac OS keep track of these file movements?\n\nA: Most Apps don't use the Bookmarks (mentioned by Matthieu) for this purpose, because Bookmarks are meant to locate a file after the app has been quit in between), but rather either keep the file open while the app runs, or reference the file using its File ID (aka CNID or objID), or simply by using a NSURL object that keeps track of the file.\nThe secret to this working is that HFS(+) volumes assign each file and folder a unique number (the CNID), and so even if the file is renamed or moved, it can be looked up by that number again. Bookmarks also make use of this number by storing it for this purpose.\nThis also means that if you place your file on a file system that does not support file IDs, e.g. on a SMB network volume or a FAT formatted disk, renaming and moving of such files may NOT be detected by those apps, because there's no alternative tracking mechanism in this case.\nSee also Apple's Technical QA1113: The /.vol/ dir and volFS.\nAPFS, Apple's new volume format, does support File IDs as well, BTW.\n\nA: From a higher point of view (in opposite to the low level implementation) this is probably related to NSURL's bookmark capabilities.\n\nA bookmark provides a persistent reference to a file-system resource. When you resolve a bookmark, you obtain a URL to the resource’s current location. A bookmark’s association with a file-system resource (typically a file or folder) usually continues to work if the user moves or renames the resource, or if the user relaunches your app or restarts the system.\n\n", "Q: In Terminal, where it displays XXX@YYY , what is XXX and what is YYY?

Any possibility to tweak the English input language to use Danish HW keyboard?\n(I know this is possible on Windows but I cannot find the option to do it on OSX)\n\nA: Use Ukelele to make a custom keyboard layout which has US as the name but uses the key mapping for Danish.  Hopefully OneNote will switch to English proofing when you use this.\nhttpL//scripts.sil.org/ukelele\n\nA: Do you want to use different keyboard layouts for different languages? \nI'm using english as my \"input\" language, but using the german keyboard layout. \nFor your system language, go to\n\nSystem Preferences > Language & Region \n\nHere are your \"input languages\".\nWhen you go to\n\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard \n\nJust use your preferred one.

Can someone still jailbreak that phone and use it as a new phone?\n\nA: Since iOS 7, Apple has employed Activation Lock. Once Find my iPhone has been enabled, the device is bound to the user's Apple ID and will require the username and password of that particular Apple ID to restore or activate.\nRemote wipes put a lock on the device on top of clearing out the data. Once that phone is turned back on, a password will be required.\nActivation Lock cripples iPhones for life (or till the user enters the Apple ID password). \nThe thief that has your device now has a brick and it will always be a brick. There is absolutely no bypassing Activation Lock because Apple's servers will chase it forever.\nThe only procedure left to the thief is to put the device in DFU mode, but once the restore is complete, the user will again be prompted for the Apple ID password upon setup. And since the device checks Apple's servers for this hold, the thief is left up a creak.\nYou can see on Apple's website what Activation Lock consists of:\n\nWith Activation Lock, your Apple ID and password are required before\n  anyone can:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Turn off Find My iPhone on your device\n  \n*Sign out of iCloud on your device\n  \n*Erase and reactivate your device\n\nJailbreaking a device requires access to it. If it was that easy, Activation Lock would be useless. Apple is much smarter than that.\niPhone Hacks has a more in-depth look at the feature: Protect your iPhone against theft with Activation Lock\n\nA: Physical Access is Total Control. This is the 100% truth on all things computing.\nAs soon as your phone is physically in someone else's hands, if the thief knows what they're doing they can get around anything.\nI won't go into detail about how they can subvert a remote wipe, or more generally gain any level of access to your phone, but it's fairly straight forward and the feature exists on literally every single iPhone. (And I think identically even iPod Touch and iPad.)\nThe part of this I do NOT know the answer to, is the recent carrier activation security feature ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/10/phone-theft-activation-lock-apple-_n_3417032.html ). I believe the intended effect of this is that the thief would never be able to activate the phone with a cell service when the phone is wiped, in essence, reported lost/stolen.\nWhile they may not be able to activate the phone, they can still gain access and read your data, assuming they took the phone offline before the Remote Wipe could take effect.\n", "Q: How to submit app without In-App Purchases I'm trying to make a bundle identifier that doesn't require me to submit IAPs. For the explicit id, I can't find where to turn it off or uncheck the box. I noticed that I can make a wild card id, but Game Center is disabled and I want to have Game Center. \nSo, can we submit an identifier with IAPs enabled but not use any IAPs?\n\nA: Yes, as  Game Center and In-App Purchase are enabled by default for an explicit iOS App ID and can't be disabled. \nHaving them enabled, though, does not mean that you are forced to use them nor means that you are actively using them.\n", "Q: Process 'storeagent' eating bandwidth Recently I noticed a hike in my daily internet usage.

Serious iPhone issue \nToday on my way home, I accidentally dropped my iphone with the back facing the ground from about 1.2 metres in the air. All other iphone functions are not damaged except for the screen. My phone has a password and therefore iTunes cannot access it. Also, the screen is damaged so I cannot see anything, and cannot key in the password for my iphone. No matter how hard I slided on the screen it's still the same when I takes the next screenshot. Could it be that the screen had already slided to the side, that's why I couldn't slide to unlock? Or has the touch screen broken down? So what can I do to solve this type of problem? Any reccommendations of iPhone controller (connection from USB only)? I have no budget at all and would not spend any money on this.\n\nA: If it's a software issue you can fix it resetting the phone back to factory defaults (just make sure you back up first).\nIf it's a hardware problem like the screen doesn't work or touchscreen is not responding to touches then there's no simple fix. You can only resolve this by repairing the broken hardware.\n", "Q: Simple app for taking/storing photos on a server I am looking for a dead-simple app to take photos (either with the camera, or from the library) and store them onto a server via WiFi.  This is for taking photos of whiteboards at work.  I really want the app to be dead-simple, automatically storing a photo to the server would be great.\nI don't really care what protocol it uses to communicate with the server, but it would be great if it were not a proprietary Apple protocol, so that I could use an existing Linux file server.\nDoes such a thing exist?\n\nA: Dropbox is likely the best for storing photos in the cloud. It allows you to easily, and simply select photos from your library and then upload them to the Dropbox cloud.\nThe one caveat is that it is annoying to restore images because you have to go to each picture and restore it individually. Who knows, perhaps they will come out with an update that will fix that.\n\nA: No apps come directly to mind that are that generic. Though I use PogoPlug for the very thing you describe. It is basically a private cloud. The device itself is very inexpensive, less than $50, and there are applications for all of the mobile platforms that will upload your pictures automatically. You just need to plug the PogoPlug into your network and attach an external hard drive (you can actually chain many drives to it) and let the PogoPlug device do the rest.

I need to be able to track how much data individual apps are using, however as I am connecting to 4g through wifi, I can't just check mobile (celluar) data usage.\nHow can I track the total data each app is using, both over mobile networks and wifi?\n\nA: Data Usage - Onavo Count - Data manager =\ntracks each app =\nwould be perfect and its free\n\nA: The iOS system does not save the data usage for single apps.\nBut you could jailbreak your iPhone to get a feature like this, there are tweaks for that.\n", "Q: Run sudo From Non-Admin Account Okay, so I'm gearing up to get a new machine so I'm looking at how I can organise things better. Now, currently I use an admin account as my main login account, but I know that that's probably not best practice, so I'd like to switch to a separate admin and non-admin account on my machine.\nHowever, I'm a developer, and I do a lot of work in the terminal, so sometimes I do need to run commands via sudo, but of course that won't work the way I would normally run it (sudo foo, type current account's password). What I'd like to know is, knowing the details for an admin account on my machine, is it possible to run commands via sudo (or similar) from a non-admin account, without having to login to a different account each time? For example, could I trigger the enter admin password dialogue somehow?\n\nA: In Terminal type login, a space, your admin name and hit return. Then type your admin password, hit return and you are logged in as administrator that can issue sudo commands with no additional configuration or files to change.\n\nA: Add your existing user name to the sudoers file, and what you need to do is use the visudo command and add lines like this:\n\nUser privilege specification\nroot ALL=(ALL) ALL\n<randomuser> ALL=(ALL) ALL\n%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\nOr whatever perms you want to give yourself. then you can run sudo whatever to your hearts extent. That's /etc/sudoers by the way.\n\nA: Seems like you could use the SU command to switch to another user in Terminal. Once you've switched to the admin user you can use sudo commands coupled with the admin account's password.\nFor example, when I'm at one of my end user's Macs and I need to run something with elevated privileges (chown for example) without logging out and into the admin account (ladmin) I would use something like this (in bold):\nMr-Rabbits-Mac:~ notadminuser$ su ladmin\nThis will prompt for the ladmin account's password, once entered you will see a bash command prompt.  From here I can run any sudo commands desired, entering ladmin's password as needed...\nbash-3.2$ sudo chown user2 /some/folder\nThis will run the chown command using the now logged in ladmin user, prompting for the ladmin account's password.  Once finished you can type exit to return to your logged in user's prompt.\nScreenshot of similar process, only using sudo to run the ls command (just for example).\n\n\nA: Go to the Directory Utility, unlock it and then from the Edit menu option select \"Enable Root User\". Type in a unique password for the root account and re-enter it for verification. Now with that done from any account you can open the Terminal.app from you can run \"login\" and enter root at the login and then enter the root password you just set up. You should be good to go! ;)\n", "Q: Sending Keystrokes to a Window when it Loses Focus I am running virtual machines for testing on a second Space using Virtualbox, and the problem is that when I'm on the primary space, the virtual machine continues to use a lot of CPU time and kills the battery.\nRight now I try to remember to manually Pause the virtual machine every time I switch back to my primary space, but that gets tedious and I'd like to do it automatically.\nSo the question is: \nHow can I send the CTRL + CMD + P shortcut key combination to the virtual machine to pause it every time it loses focus, or alternatively whenever I switch back to Space 1.\nIdeally it would also send the combination again when I switch to the Space with Virtualbox running on it, but that isn't as important.\n[edit]\nI've been able to solve the problem using third-party software - Keyboard Maestro triggering the command-line VBoxManage tool and sending a Pause command that way. But there must be a way to do it without paying for software.\n\nA: A way to trigger it with a global keyboard shortcut (and without having to switch back) is to create a little applescript to do it for you.  I'm not familiar with Virtualbox's windows, so you'll need to modify the below to suit your needs.  You can run it as is, and note that 1) Terminal does NOT take focus when you run this, it stays in the background and 2) when you do switch to terminal, the Inspector will be showing.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n  tell process \"Terminal\"\n  click menu item \"Show Inspector\" of menu \"Shell\" of menu bar 1\n  end tell\nend tell\n\nI'm assuming that the Pause VM command will be available from the VB menus, if not, please let me know in the comments where the command lives, and I can update the answer to reflect that.\nOnce you have the applescript tested, use Automator to create a service: this will let you activate it with a global keyboard shortcut, no need to switch applications or anything.\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Automator\n\n*New project if it loads an old one, and select \"Service\"\n\n*In the search box enter, \"script\" to filter the options and double-click \"Run Applescript\"\n\n*Paste the applescript right in there.\n\n*Save it, give it a name like \"Pause the dang VM\", and quit.\n\n\nNext, to give it a global keyboard shortcut:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts Tab\n\n*Select \"Services\" in the left pane\n\n*Scroll to the bottom of the right pane, and you should see your new service\n\n*Click \"none\" to the right of your new service and you can create a shortcut.\n\n\nSo now if you forget, at least it's just a key press instead of a whole application switch around. \nNOTE: you'll need to allow Automator to control the computer in System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility \n", "Q: Is there a way to add keyboard shortcuts to preference panes?

Can a bluetooth device, like a panic button, launch an app when pressed and have the app call a pre-programmed number or does the app have to be running for it to be accessed by the device?\n\nA: iOS apps are allowed to monitor for specific Bluetooth LE(Low Energy)/4.0 device services in the background.  But not regular (non-LE/4.x) Bluetooth devices.\nHowever, iOS apps are not allowed to start a cellular phone call without specific user interaction (for obvious security reasons).\n\nA: I do not know of a third-party device (besides Apple-approved accessories) to be able to control the iPhone, least to launch an app on the iPhone.

How can I delete photos from iCloud without deleting them from my iPhone?\n\nA: This is possible by opening the Settings.app on your iPhone, scrolling down, and selecting \"iCloud\". Scroll down, then tap Storage & Backup -> Manage Storage -> [Your iPhone Name] (This iPhone). You will then see a list of all the apps that are storing data in iCloud. Chances are the top one will be \"Camera\" and you can switch that off. Doing that will delete photos from iCloud, and if you were to ever restore your phone, photos would not be restored. However, it will not delete the photos that are on your device already.\nAlso, it is important to note that iCloud Shared photos, as well as your Photostream do not count toward your iCloud backup storage limit. There is an arbitrary limit of 1,000 photos on your Photostream. You can safely leave those on without affecting your storage use amount.\n", "Q: Is there any software to control at what time a specific network can be used?

Trying to find a way to take component video and audio output from a device, and preview it on-screen in a window.  We don't need recording or encoding capabilities, but we would like as low latency as possible.  This would allow us to hook up things like a TiVo or game console and play it in a window of our PC without having to dedicate an entire monitor.\n\nA: I would highly recommend the Elgato line of capture hardware as they are reasonably priced, well supported, come with the software you need and have been in the business for quite some time.\nEven for some prosumer applications, Elgato hardware is good enough for the job as some input sources are not going to be improved by spending $2000 on hardware that can do impressive amounts of A/D conversion and fancy time sync olympics.\nYou could go cheaper on the hardware (especially if you only need composite instead of component input), but my experience is if you know exactly what you're doing - you already can judge what cheap thing you can press into service and what is a waste of your time. I'd buy from a retailer that has a nice return policy or can make sure you buy the appropriate package.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.adorama.com/EG1040.html\n\nA: Though this speaks more to a digital signal (more on that in a second):\nSome laptops have HDMI Input in addition to HDMI output (the Alienware M17X is one). This would allow low-latency video to be seen in a window on the laptop screen.\n\n\n*\n\n*Macbooks do not support this.\n\n*Mac towers can install HDMI capture cards, with caveats that I'm sure you've already researched. The BlackMagic Intensity line seems to be a front runner for low-latency, but it's not a product I've tested.\n\n\nIn all cases where you want to connect a component (or any analog) video source to a computer, you will introduce latency because it always has to be encoded.\nEdit: Since the Intensity line now supports thunderbolt, a thunderbolt-equipped macbook may allow for low-latency display.\n", "Q: iPad: export Keynote project to video Setup.\nI'm running the most recent version of Keynote (as of April 3rd, 2014) on an iPad Air, WiFi-only version @ 16GBs.\nTask/issue.\nI would like to export the project/slideshow to a video file (to then be able transfer the movie to my desktop PC running windows).\nThoughts.\nIs there any way to do this? I was thinking there must be a way to do it by using iMovie on iOS as a proxy somehow, but couldn't find any resources on the matter.\n\nA: Keynote for iOS does not support this. Apparently Apple does not provide any mechanism for screen-recording (video) within iOS 7, and will not permit any third-party app that enables this. There have been some apps that can do screen recording on iOS 7, but they require jailbreaking the device, and are not authorized by Apple through the App Store. \nThe only way that I know to achieve this is by one of the following: \n1) move your Keynote document that you created on iOS to Keynote on Mac OS X, which has a video export feature\n2) If you have a Windows PC, you can use Reflector for Windows, which enables live video and audio recording of a \"screen share\" of what is playing on your iOS device. You establish a connection between your iOS device and your Windows computer, enable \"Record\" in Reflector, and then play back your Keynote document in full screen on your iOS device. You then have a video on your Windows computer that you can further edit.\n\nA: One way to do this is to use ScreenSharing on your iPad to a device that accepts AirPlay and then capturing the screen remotely.  I have answered a question on this scenario using a Mac with Quicktime and some other AirPlay software here, but I'm guessing you don't have a Mac.\nLuckily you can use the software (AirServer) on a PC, so you can airplay mirror your entire screen to your PC, and then use a PC screen capture/recording program in place of Quicktime (You may have to ask another question elsewhere to get a decent recommendation, but a quick google throws up any number of possibilities e.g. here).  Although, a quick peek suggests AirServer can now record all by itself on a Mac, with that feature coming to PC soon.  That takes a load of complexity out of the task :)  Other AirDisplay software is available, especially on Mac, but AirServer is merely the one I am most familiar with that I know does Windows too.\nIt's not perhaps the most elegant solution, but it's pretty nifty.\n\nA: Realizing you have a Windows PC without Keynote, and assuming this is a one-time thing you don't need to repeat regularly, I would be happy to convert it for you free of charge if you'd like.\n\nA: You could use a Mac to do the conversion: From Apple Support:\nWith Keynote you can export your presentation to a number of file formats. Follow these steps to create a file that you can use in iMovie:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your presentation in Keynote \n\n*Choose File > Export.  \n\n*Select QuickTime as the file format.  \n\n*Select \"Fixed Timing\" for playback.\n\n*Do not select the manual advance option; the resulting file may not import into iMovie.\n\n*Select \"Full Quality Large\" for the format setting. \n\n*Click Next.\n\n*Name and save your movie.\n\n\nFollow these steps to import this file into iMovie:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iMovie\n\n*Choose File > Import Movies.\n\n*Locate your movie, saved in step 7 above.\n\n*Click Import.\n\n\nA: I agree with the suggestion of using screen capture software. Here's a comparison list that may be helpful in your search.\n\nA: It appears that one used to be able to export a Keynote Presentation to Imovie on the same Ipad. But sadly, it looks like Apple has has taken this opportunity away. Once saved in MP4 format, you should them be able to transfer it to your PC several ways.\n", "Q: help removing installmac malware In a moment of stupidity I installed a program on my OS X 10.8.5 that was suppose to turn my Iphone into a remote for my powerbook.

Thus I can still ask you.\nThanks to the following instruction, I find a way to reset the admin password.\nhttp://fixedbyvonnie.com/2013/09/how-to-reset-the-admin-password-on-your-mac-without-a-disk/#.Uz5eM8cT-pe\nI carried out a test of the same procedure on another Mac (10.9.2). In the test, although resetpassword command in Recovery Mode successfully updated the account password, it didn't update default Keychain password at the same time. \nAfter restart, the OS asks if I want to update 'default Kecyhain password'. To update it, I need to enter the older Keychain password that I don't know. If I skip the update, Keychain asks passwords repeatedly, and without the old Keychain password, I can't launch and open Keychain Access.\nThen I found this. It says you can reset the Keychain password by Keychain First Aid.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/24171670#24171670\nHowever, in my test, Keychain First Aid still asks the older Keychain password, so this doesn't work.\nIn short, I can update the admin password, but not the Keychain password without knowing the old password. So if I carry out this on the server machine, The Server won't run properly and would ask passwords over and over again.\nOn the test Mac I tried to activate root user, hoping the root user could change Keychain password without knowing the old Keychain password. But I couldn't access to the \"login\" Keychain of the account in question from the root account.\nDoes anyone know a work-around?\nIs there a way to reset the default Keychain password without the old Keychain password?\nOr, is there a way to know the old Keychain password? Probably not.\nOr, do you think TimeMachine can undo my failure in changing the admin password and recover the old admin password?\nDuring this mail shutdown period, I assume many people have asked his health status by email. It's an emergency and I really need your help!\n\nA: In conclusion, TimeMachine recovery of the entire system to the status before changing admin password worked well. I recovered the old admin password and it worked for Keychain Access as well.\nIn details;\nJust in case the recovery doesn't work and I lose the TimeMachine backups somehow, I copied the TimeMachine backup to another external drive. To do that, however, I needed admin password. So, first I had to reset the admin password.\nNote: In my case, the destination for TimeMachine backup was a local partition (probably), so I didn't need network password to access it. If it were in network, for example, you would need password that has been lost at step 8. Then this procedure may not work for you. Before actually try the following steps, it may be good to see if you need password for system recovery, following http://support.apple.com/kb/PH14185 (step 5 in this page is the key), but just cancel when you are asked to choose date and time.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Time Machine pane in System Preferences. Choose Time Machine > Open Time Machine Preferences…\n\n*Slide the Time Machine switch to Off.\n\n*Restart the Mac with Command + R keys held down to enter Recovery Mode.\n\n*In Recovery Mode, launch Terminal.app.\n\n*In Terminal.app, type resetpassword.\n\n*Choose the admin account and set new password. Verify it.\n\n*Warning about Keychain will appear.\n\n*Restart. Now you get admin password at the cost of loosing Keychain password. The server won't work properly any longer.\n\n*The OS will ask if you want to update Keychain password. Because you don't know the old password. You can't do that. So just choose Continue in the middle.\n\n*The system will ask Keychain passwords, but you have to ignore them.\n\n*Connect an external drive that is large enough.\n\n*If necessary, reformat the drive to Mac OS Extended (Journaled).\nsee http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5096\n\n*Click the icon of the new backup drive and choose Get Info from the File menu or press Command-I (⌘-I)\n\n*Make sure Ignore ownership on this volume at the bottom of the Sharing & Permissions: section is not checked.\n\n*Open a new Finder window. In the Finder sidebar, click the icon of the current backup drive.\n\n*Open a new Finder window. In the Finder sidebar, click the icon of the new backup drive.\n\n*Drag the folder Backups.backupdb on the current backup drive to the root level of the new backup drive.\n\n*Enter an administrator name and password (you needed to reset the admin password for this step), then click OK to start the copying process.  This may take some time to complete because all the backups will be copied.\n\n*After the copy has completed, you can eject the eternal drive.\n\n*Restart the machine with Command and R keys held down to enter Recovery Mode.\n\n*In Recovery Mode, Select Restore from a Time Machine Backup, then click Continue. \n\n*Select the TimeMachine storage.\n\n*Select the date and time of the backup you want to restore, then follow the onscreen instructions.\n\n*In my case, I successfully recovered admin password as well as default Keychain password.\n\nA: Reset your keychain password by opening Keychain Access in Applications > Utilities. Select the login keychain from the left side and then go to the File menu and choose Delete Keychain “login”. When prompted, choose Delete References to allow the keychain file to stay on your hard drive for future re-activation.\n", "Q: How to set static IP on iPad My iPad keeps sending the message that it is unable to connect to the internet and my only option is to dismiss.\nHow do I find the subnet mask and ip address and router so I can manually try and set it up?\n\nA: iOS 7:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Tap Settings \n  \n*Tap on WiFi\n  \n*Tap on your connected WiFi name\n  \n*Tap the static tab and enter your addresses \n  \n*Close out of the Settings and launch Safari or another network app to confirm connectivity\n  \n\n\nA: Tap the blue arrow beside the network name in WiFi-Settings\n", "Q: Set a custom dock icon for an application instance via Terminal I'm frequently opening multiple instances of applications, especially Emacs, since I may be working on different projects on the same time, and I find this the best way to manage this (yes, I know there are lots of project management extensions for Emacs, I don't need to be taught in Emacs).\nI'm doing this with open -n -a Emacs.app which opens a new separate Emacs instance.

Also, X programs are supposed to support the -name and -title options for setting (I think) the name of an Xresource file to be loaded and/or the title of the application instance.\nSo I haven't tested this, but you might be able to do something like:\nopen -n -a Emacs.app --args \"-name <resource-file-path> -title school\"\n\nThen, in the resource file, a line that says\nemacs.iconName:<path-to-school-icon-file>\n\nIn another resource file, you'd have iconName set to a work icon, etc.\nIf you try this, I'd be interested in knowing how it works out.\n", "Q: Mac keeps searching for networks even when it's already connected to a network My 2013 MacBook Air keeps searching for networks when it is already connected the to internet.

Is mavericks following the path of Windows? I have use OS X 10.6.8 for years and just recently did a fresh installation of Mavericks. One of the nicest aspects of OS X was the fact that after three years of use and installing tons of application, none of them, ever added any toolbar or extension to my firefox. As appose to windows that after couple of weeks, the browser looks like a circus.\nToday during installing uTorrent on Mavericks, I noticed that my firefox was reset and upon opening my home page changed to yahoo as well as my default search engine. Later I noticed that it has also added an extension to my browser.\nIs this a flaw in the Apple new OS? Was it always there and I was just lucky in three years of using Snow Leopard? Is there some kind of security mechanism that I have to enable? \n\nA: During installation many installers, not just uTorrent. (Also Daemon Tools for example on Windows) try to install a lot of stuff on your computer.\nIf you accept one of the offers (which looks like an agreement), you end up with stupid plugins in your browser and other default search tools - this is exactly what you're facing right now.\nI would strongly recommend you to open the installer again and notice the 3rd party installers which are hidden inside the uTorrent installation program so you can spot them in future installations.\nFor now, to fix this problem: Remove the toolbars / plugins manually and set back Google (or whatever your default search provider was) as default search engine.\nTo make this answer complete, the same could happen to you on Snow Leopard.

I also cannot use my Spotify account anymore because it says that I need to be in my home country. How can I change that? I already tried using System Preferences -> Language & Region, but that does't work.\n\nA: Google and Spotify are most likely showing you Netherlands information because they are associating your IP address to a location in the Netherlands.\nThis isn't a setting that is controlled from your browser, but is a component of your internet connection that services use for various reasons to personalize the experience to the user, without knowing much (yet) about the user themselves.\nFor example, if I VPN (tunnel my internet connection to make it look like I'm from a server physically located elsewhere) from the US to the UK, Google automatically directs me to the UK Google page, and I can watch Al Jazerra English and BBC. (both unavailable-ish in the US) Similarly, those services think you are physically in the Netherlands, and they behave accordingly; Google directs you to it's .nl service, and Spotify likely doesn't have streaming agreements in the country, so it cannot legally service those in the Netherlands.\nNow, you don't mention where you are physically, so it is possible that you are not physically in the Netherlands, but whatever service Google and Spotify use to associate an IP with a general location says that you are, likely because (some time in the past) that IP address was associated with a location in the Netherlands.

There are many times I want to crop a photo using iPhoto on iOS and post to Facebook, and then possibly crop it another way (like panoramic this time), and post to Facebook, but I don't want to lose the original.\nIs there a way to make duplicates of the original and edit it using iPhoto on iOS?\nP.S. I also found that when you crop a photo in the Photos app, the original is not lost.  You can simply re-crop it again (or un-crop it) to get a different cropping or get back the original.  But, it still might be good to have a duplicate if you want to keep 2 different ways of cropping of the same photo.\n\nA: What I do is copy the photo and paste it into the notes app and then save it back to the camera roll, then we have a duplicate and we can edit one of them and still keep the original.\n\nA: Here's a tested & confirmed way to copy photos without downloading any other apps. You will however need wi-fi or wireless service at the time to do this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the photo, click share, select Message, and send it to yourself (your Apple ID).\n\n*Then, open Messages and click on the message you just sent yourself. Click on the image, then click Share, and then Save Image.\n\n*You can repeat clicking Share->Save Image, for as many copies of the photo as you want.\n\n\nWhen you're done, go back to Photos and find the copies. Each photo is now an individual copy that can edited, cropped, etc. without the changes being applied to the other copies.\n\nA: I was looking to make a Photo Editing Extension to Duplicate photos easily, but...\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/duplicate-photo/id930534184?mt=8\n\n... it's already existing =/\n\nA: As of iOS 9.3 you can choose to Duplicate photo directly. Pretty convenient.\n\n\nA: This functionality is missing. As a workaround you can email or message the picture to yourself and save it again.\n\nA: As of iOS 8 there is at least one commercial product which addresses this limitation.  Hopefully Apple will build-in such a function soon.\n\nA: After this \"Copy\" action you can \"Paste\" a photo to any not-system album (not Panoramas or Photo Stream for example).\nYou can not paste to empty album (at least in 8.1.2, seems like a bug), but you can add any photo to this album on creation or by pressing \"+\" at the upper-left corner.\nBut sadly this options creates just a link to the photo, not a copy, so every change spreads to all of \"copies\" of this photo in other albums. This is just a way to tag photos. So email it...\n\nA: Simply AirDrop it back and forth between iOS devices, provided you have two.  It's a kluge for sure, but once you've got the basics down, it's like the Trouble with Tribbles episode from Star Trek!!\n\nA: I think this is a bit faster and simpler than any of the methods mentioned above:\n\n\n*\n\n*View the photo that you want to crop, zoom into it as much as you think is the area you want to crop. \n\n*Hit Home button and Power button at the same time to take a screenshot -- new photo will be saved. \n\n*Go to photos and view the screenshot you took, crop it as you like (remove edges at least). \n\n\nDone!\n\nA: There is a simple solution but Apple doesn't make it obvious. You don't need to send the photo anywhere, or to take a screenshot of the photo. The following procedure works:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*Edit the photo and save the edited version.\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n*Duplicate the edited version.\n\n\n\nYou now have two identical photos. They are both the edited version.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n\n*Click on one of the photos and revert it.\n\n\n\nThat will give you what you want. It will only unrevert one, not both. Now you have the original plus the edited version.\n\nA: iPhoto always keeps the original. When you go to the edit menu, there's a button to return to the original. And you can always preview the original by holding shift. \nOf course you can manuelly use copy-paste or diplicate (cmd+d I believe) if you want to manually duplicate a picture. \n\nA: Simplest way--Choose your photo, then take a screen shot, and presto, a duplicate photo you can edit! Note that the screen shot will have a lower resolution than the original!\n\nA: Copy it and save it to a new album then make the edits \n\nA: I use the \"Save to Photo Album\" action in the app Workflow, as an extension.\n", "Q: Mini DVI port male to thunderbolt female I use the old 2007 white macbook (that works great).

Related to this question: What cable do I need to go iPad audio out to macbook air mic in? which is asking about cables to record iPad audio on another device. \nThis question is: is there a way to record audio generated on the iPad on the iPad itself? For example, are there any audio recording apps that can record in the background while audio is being created in another app? \nIt's a bit hard to search for as there are a lot of apps that allow you to record audio via the external mic, but I'm specifically looking to record audio generated from the iPad itself (such as from a synthesizer or drum machine app). \n\nA: In general, no.  On a stock iOS device, the OS security sandbox prevents any app from recording, or otherwise accessing in any way, the audio generated by any other app, unless that other app explicitly exports its audio (via AudioBus or Inter-App Audio).  Some (but not all) synthesizer and drum machines (etc.) apps document support for such.\n", "Q: improving wi-fi connection/reception no router or modem being used I believe my issue is different from all that I've read.  I live on a boat in a marina.  The marina has towers (transmitters) placed around in various spots.  The internet provider is Beacon wi-fi.  A big wi-fi provider for marinas around USA, Canada and Bahamas. \nSo I get my password from the marina and log in. I use a MacBook Pro laptop which has an internal wi-fi antenna.  So there is no router or modem on board my boat.  My problem is the connection is extremely poor. When I finally get connected the reception is weak. Streaming a hockey or football game is almost impossible. Loading a page of text can be fast as times but usually takes 15 to 90 seconds to load when it's at it's best.  A 2 minute utube video can take 30 minutes.  \nMy boat is about 200 feet from the closest tower of transmitters or whatever they might be called. There are several to chose from on my drop down list.  I have to constantly keep selecting a different one to get reconnected. The PHY Mode is 802.11G The RSSI: is sometimes as good as -59  but usually around -80 when I'm actually getting as good a reception as possible.  \nI've tried this trick. I bought an external wi-fi (looks like a memory stick) and a USB extension cord plugged into one of my ports.  I then got a large kitchen strainer and poked a hole in it at the bottom and fastened the wi-fi gizmo to it.  Then pointed it towards the transmitters on the poles on the wharfs.  It did make an improvement but it was minimal and not consistent plus it cost $100 so I returned the USB extension cord and the external wi-fi. Anybody want a free strainer with a hole in it?  \nI contacted Beacon wi-fi in Dallas and they say everything is good at their end.  I've contacted the marina and they say everything is good at their end.  Does anyone have any tricks other than what I've tried to improve my internet?\n\nA: I'd try one of these:\nhttp://www.radiolabs.com/products/antennas/2.4gig/2.4-aluminum-parabolic.php\nIf you are not moving around, and can lock on to one of the towers visually, you could point this antenna at it and try to maximize the weak signal. Kind of like a shotgun microphone or a telephoto lens.\n\nA: I would recommend searching Amazon (or wherever) for a wifi range extender and finding one that would work on your boat. There's even one that is specifically for boats and comes with a 5M usb cable. \n", "Q: Fan Direction MacBook I bought a cooler for the bottom of my MacBook because I use it on my bed.

I'm trying to set up a few addresses that should do nothing but forward to external gmail addresses. For example, let's say I want user@example.com to forward to myname@gmail.com. If I just try to specify myname@gmail.com as the forwarding address in server.app, it doesn't work.\nOddly, internal forwarding works. For example, say I have example.com and example2.com set up on my mail server. I can successfully forward from example.com to example2.com, but not to any external domain. Any suggestions?\n\nA: In my experience this applies to Mavericks (10.9) and Yosemite (10.10) the same way that Apple says to do it for Mountain Lion. \nhttps://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT5032\n\n\n*\n\n*In Server.app, go to Users and select a user.\n\n*Click the gear icon (or Control-click the user name) and choose \"Edit Mail Options...\"\n\n*From the \"Mail should be:\" pop-up menu, select \"forwarded\".\n\n*Enter the forwarding email address in the \"to email address:\" field.\n\n\nAdditionally or alternatively, there is also a configuration file at /etc/aliases, /etc/postfix/aliases, and/or /Library/Server/Mail/Config/postfix/aliases which can be edited (using sudo) and in the area \"# Put your local aliases here.\" you could put the line:\nuser: myname@gmail.com\n\nIf you want a copy to stay in the local mailbox of user you could use:\nuser: user,myname@gmail.com\n\nIf you want copies to go to additional accounts, they are separated by commas.\nsome-name: user1,user2,user3\n\nThis can be used for email addresses that do not have accounts on the machine such as webmaster or postmaster.\nAfter saving the file, one needs to run the command:\nsudo newaliases\n\nI have done this for Mavericks Server for local email addresses, recently tested it for Yosemite Server and found that it works for external address too.\nNote that individual aliases can also be added for particular users in Server.app. \nAlso of possible use are the notes kept by \"magnusviri\" about managing postfix on OS X Server (3.1.2) on Mavericks 10.9.4 - there is disussion about the different locations of configuration files between /etc, /etc/postfix, and/or /Library/Server/Mail/Config/postfix/ Only one of these three locations will be being used by your setup, so editing the \"wrong\" files will have no effect on the system's behaviour.\nhttp://www.magnusviri.com/OS_X_Server/os-x-server-postfix.html\n", "Q: Directory contents into a spreadsheet entry I would like to turn the contents of a folder into entries for Numbers (or Excel) - is there a way to automate doing this?\n\nA: You can use Automator.app to create a service in finder.\nOpen Automator.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new service documents\n\n*set the the service receives selected Folders in Finder\n\n*Add a Get folder contents Action.\n\n*Add a Get Run Applescript Action.\n\n*replace the applescript content with the applescript below.\n.\non run {input, parameters}\n    set theCsv to \"\"\n    repeat with i from 1 to number of items in input\n        tell application \"Finder\" to set this_item to displayed name of item i of input\n        set this_item to this_item & \",\\\\n\"\n        set theCsv to theCsv & this_item\n    end repeat\n    do shell script \"echo \" & quoted form of theCsv & \" > ~/Desktop/names.csv\"\nend run\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*save the document\n\n\nNow when you select a folder in finder you can use the contextual menu to run the service on the folder.\nIt will create a .csv file on your desktop of the list.

What if it says iCloud offline on device? Is it because my iPad is wiped or the power is dead?\n- if so, how can I figure out the seriel number on my iPad to track it in that sort of way \n\nA: You can only track it when it is online and connected to the internet.  If it's not online, it could be turned off, the battery could be flat, it could just be out of WIFI range, etc - could be anything.  Use iCloud.com and Find my iPhone to set it to alert when it comes online is all you can really do.\nYour best hope is that you were using IOS7 on the device, and had it logged into iCloud, because that way no-one else can use it, even if they wipe the device, without they re-enter your own Apple ID iCloud login.\n\nA: If it is not turned on/online you can not track it.\nDepending how experienced the \"lucky finder\" is, it might be wiped already. \n\nA: You can find it just if it's online and connected to the internet. If the iPad runs iOS 7, the man who found it have to know your Apple ID and the password of your account, and to enter any password he have to be connect to the internet, so if the iPad runs iOS 7 you still have hope. \n", "Q: Is a clean Mac upgraded to Mavericks as good as one with it pre-installed?

Starting with the advent of Intel boards, all shutdowns are tagged with an 8-bit code, if the normal software shutdown flags are not recorded. A positive code indicates a software or HID initiated shutdown, while a negative code (in the range of -1 to -127) indicates hardware-related Intel SMC-initiated shutdown. A -128 shutdown code indicates a hardware-related shutdown of unknown cause.\nThe 0 shutdown code resides in a liminal space between the hardware and the user; it signifies a sudden loss of power which can either be caused by a hardware failure or user action (if you want to demonstrate this for yourself, try popping the battery out of an old MacBook or MacBook Pro while it's on and unplugged, or pulling the power cord out of an iMac while it's running, then rebooting the computer and checking Console.app. A 0 Sleep Cause results when a MacBook/Pro/Air puts itself into SafeSleep using the last bit of reserve battery power before full system shutdown in order to preserve the contents of RAM in the\n/var/vm/sleepimage\n\nfile. Unless you happen to connect your MagSafe adapter immediately after the computer goes to sleep, this code is pretty well guaranteed to be followed a 0 Shutdown Cause in the system.log.\nSome of the hardware shutdown codes are unique to specific models of computer depending on their configuration because they refer to a specific sensor or device that exists only in that model– when I worked for Apple we were told that Intel was responsible for assigning the codes and wasn't particularly free with the information sharing on that count, even with Apple Engineering. So we pretty much had to figure out the obscure ones on our own.\nPrevious Shutdown Cause 5 and 3 are holdovers from the PowerPC days- because they're initiated by the user, the OS is still responsible for reporting them. \nCode 5 is a clean, user initiated software shutdown, e.g. by selecting Shut Down from the  menu, or pressing the power button and selecting Shut Down in the pop-up window, or holding down controloptioncommandeject, or typing\nsudo halt\n\nat the command prompt. Similarly, a Previous Sleep Cause of 5 indicates any clean user-initiated sleep, from the  menu or a hot corner or the command line or closing the lid and triggering the hall-effect sensor in the top case of a MacBook/Pro/Air.\nCode 3 is a \"dirty\" Shutdown, which can be caused by any user-initiated Reboot of the computer, or by forcing a hardware computer halt by holding down the power button for 5+ seconds.\n\nA: Hope it will helps someone. \nMBP 2008\n\n\n*\n\n*3 Normal behavior... power button was pressed for more than four seconds to force shutdown.\n\n*-5 Normal behavior... regular shutdown\n\n*-60 Try charging battery.\n\n*-70 Replace top case.\n\n*-72 replace heatsink sensor/reapply thermal paste/replace heatsink (it was mine problem)\n\n*-74 swap battery for KGB battery - replace battery\n\n*-78 Charger circuit on logic board...try swapping for KGB left I/O board... replace if necessary/replace logic board\n\n*-82 Test thermal sensor JST connectors for improper seating or damage.

I would like to run a Python script each time it finishes and I think I can do this with cron but I am not sure how to do it.\nThe idea is each time the Python scripts ends, it will have to run again and again.\nI have searched for answers here but I can't find something similar to this.\n\nA: In terminal:\nwhile :; do ./script_name; done\n\nor\nwhile :; do python programm.py; done\n\nIf you want add some sleep time before run program again use 'sleep' command:\nFor example:\nwhile :; do python programm.py; sleep 90; done\n\nin this example cycle will sleep 90 second before run again you program\n\nA: Cron is a scheduler, it's good if you want your script to run every 5 minutes, or every 3rd Wednesday etc, but for an arbitrary restart upon completion which could (I presume, you don't indicate what the Python script is doing, how long it takes or if the time to completion is variable etc) be essentially random it's not the best choice.\nYou can either insert some logic into the script directly, or you could simply wrap the script with some Shell Scripting logic as per @user3439968's answer, my version is essentially the same, but I've shown it a little more verbose with options for keeping an eye on the restarts etc.  You can type this into pretty much any command line shell, simplest to just open Terminal and type it straight into it\nwhile true\ndo\n    /path/to/script.py\n    sleep 60\n    date >> /path/to/logfile.txt\n    echo \"The script ended, and I restarted it after 60 seconds\" >> /path/to/logfile.txt\ndone\n\nIn the example above the restart isn't immediate but waits 60 seconds, then appends the current date and a message to a log file on each restart.

If I pause the video, THEN switch to internal speakers and back to TV, audio will be back to TV if/when I restart the video playback.\n\nA: You didn't mention what media player you're using. \nPersonally I use VLC Media Player. With VLC you can explicitly set the audio device in the menubar > audio > Audio Device > HDMI, in your case. I use VLC in conjunction with NoSleep to close my laptop while playing media. The screen turns off when I close the lid, but the computer stays awake. The brightness button also will step/dim down to \"display off\" on my laptop. I usually opt to do it this way instead of closing the lid all the way so as to be able to pause and play and also to keep the laptop from getting hot.

In Notes.app (the default notes app that ships with Mac OS X since 10.8), is it possible to pin notes to the top of the list, regardless of existing sort order?\nYou can pin notes to the desktop (i.e. open notes in separate windows) but I'm talking about a feature akin to Simplenote's pinning that simply places notes at the top of the list.\nIn the screenshot below of Simplenote, you can see the dot to the left of the 'Reminders' note indicating that it's pinned to top. On the right, you see the 'Pin to Top' feature. Does this exist for Notes.app and if not, how can a solution be hacked to support it?\n\n\nA: How about creating another folder, call it 'pinned' and keep your notes there. Works for me, anyway...\n\nA: You could use sort by Title then use wildcard characters (ie *), or cleaner method is to use numeric, 1, 2, 3 in the title so you have more then one pinned and in order.\n\nA: At first I thought we can use touch command for the note you want to pin, and then I realize all the notes are stored in single file. There is a discussion where Notes.app store all the notes.\nSo I don’t think there is an elegant way to hack this Pin to Top feature.\n\nA: It is obiously not In the Design of the Notes App to include such a feature.\nSo your only way would be to \"hack\" it. And I would choose AppleScript for that.\nI am not very familiar with AppleScript, but I do know, that it is very powerful regarding Apple's included Stuff.\nI found a nice AppleScript on GitHub here :\nhttps://gist.github.com/jthigpen/5067358\nExporting a Note from the Notes App.\nSo it would be possible to select a Note, send it to the AppleScript which then could create something like a permanent \"touch\" (as suggested by sayzlim).\nOr - As said above, you can try to hack the original file. But that's not very stable. You could ruin all your comments if something goes wrong.\nHowever, If a feature is not designed by Apple and AppleScript doesn't fix it, well then you should probably ignore it, because it is too much work to get it.\n", "Q: Internal Hard Drive Not Visible I have an early 2009 MacBook running OSX 10.9.

Desktop Macs use traditional sleep mode (suspend to RAM) by default.\nSee man pmset:\nSAFE SLEEP ARGUMENTS\n     hibernatemode takes a bitfield argument defining SafeSleep behavior.\n     Passing 0 disables SafeSleep altogether, forcing the computer into a reg-\n     ular sleep.\n\n     0000 0001 (bit 0) enables hibernation; causes OS X to write memory state\n     to hibernation image at sleep time. On wake (without bit 1 set) OS X will\n     resume from the hibernation image. Bit 0 set (without bit 1 set) causes\n     OS X to write memory state and immediately hibernate at sleep time.\n\n     0000 0010 (bit 1), in conjunction with bit 0, causes OS X to maintain\n     system state in memory and leave system power on until battery level\n     drops below a near empty threshold (This enables quicker wakeup from mem-\n     ory while battery power is available). Upon nearly emptying the battery,\n     OS X shuts off all system power and hibernates; on wake the system will\n     resume from hibernation image, not from memory.\n\n     0000 1000 (bit 3) encourages the dynamic pager to page out inactive pages\n     prior to hibernation, for a smaller memory footprint.\n\n     0001 0000 (bit 4) encourages the dynamic pager to page out more aggres-\n     sively prior to hibernation, for a smaller memory footprint.\n\n     hibernatemode = 0 (binary 0000) by default on supported desktops. The\n     system will not back memory up to persistent storage. The system must\n     wake from the contents of memory; the system will lose context on power\n     loss. This is, historically, plain old sleep.\n\n     hibernatemode = 3 (binary 0011) by default on supported portables. The\n     system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and\n     will power memory during sleep. The system will wake from memory, unless\n     a power loss forces it to restore from disk image.\n\n     hibernatemode = 25 (binary 0001 1001) is only settable via pmset. The\n     system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and\n     will remove power to memory. The system will restore from disk image. If\n     you want \"hibernation\" - slower sleeps, slower wakes, and better battery\n     life, you should use this setting.\n\nTo make a laptop or a desktop Mac always hibernate (suspend to disk), run:\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25\n\nTo make a laptop always hibernate on battery power, run:\nsudo pmset -b hibernatemode 25\n\nSetting hibernatemode to 25 decreases energy consumption during sleep but makes waking up take longer.\nSome new Macs automatically enter a standby mode after a specific amount of time of being in regular sleep mode under certain conditions.

See http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1757:\n\nWith the release of the OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.2 supplemental update 2.0, a new feature was introduced to enter safe sleep after four hours of the computer being connected to AC power. This is an effort to comply with the European Energy Standards (ErP Lot6). This will only occur if there is no wireless or Ethernet activity and no activity from external devices such as USB storage devices.\n\nman pmset:\nautopoweroff - Where supported, enabled per default as an implementation\nof Lot 6 to the European Energy-related Products Directive.

(Value =\ninteger, in minutes)\n\nI don't know if there is any difference between the hibernation mode that is used when hibernatemode is set to 25, standby mode, and the hibernation mode that is used when autopoweroff is enabled.\nStandby mode or hibernation does not save that much energy though. According to Apple's environmental report, the current 13-inch MacBook Air consumes 0.25W when it is turned off and 0.68W when it is in sleep mode on 230V voltage. The MacBook Air has a 54-watt-hour battery, so a full battery should last about three days when in sleep mode (if the Mac does not enter standby mode) and about nine days if the Mac is turned off. The energy consumption in hibernation or standby mode is probably close to the energy consumption when the Mac is turned off.\n\nA: MacBook Air can easily last up to 30 days (I believe it's close to 25-28 days) in stand-by/hibernation, not sure where the 3 and 9 days come from. \n\nA: I have had good experiences with SmartSleep: http://www.jinx.de/SmartSleep.html\nFor instance it will go to hibernation when the battery level goes below a certain percentage.\n\nA: Mac portables will go to sleep when their lids are closed but, story doesn't end here. If you leave your mac for prolonged in standby mode and its batters run downs, mac will suspend to disk and will shutdown completely. My early 2008 MacBook Pro does it all the time, so I can assume that new macs are also doing it. \n\nA: Since version 10.7, Mac OS supports 'reopen windows when logging in'. This saves the entire state of the computer when you shut down: all open applications, and all open documents including unsaved changes.\nThis has a similar effect to hibernation: all of your state is available, and no power is used. The difference is that the machine shuts down/starts up instead of reading from a hibernation file.\nIn my experience, this is only slightly slower than hibernating/waking up from hibernation. (I used to run a hibernation app on my Mac before 10.7)\n", "Q: locate & updatedb - files not found I ran\nsudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb\n\nthen \nlocate Radium3\n\nbut it returns nothing!\nbut\n$ ls ~/Library/Containers/com.catpigstudios.Radium3/\nContainer.plist Data\n\nSo why doesn't locate see all the files?\nAm I using this command correctly on OS X?\n\nA: Try:\nsudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb\n\nAnd look config:\n/etc/locate.rc           the configuration file\nEdited:\nPost here output:\necho $LOCATE_CONFIG\n\nAnd:\ncat /etc/locate.rc\n\nAnd:\necho $0\n\nUpdate:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man1/locate.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/locate\nThe locate program searches a database for all pathnames which match the specified pattern.

I thought it was some minor issue with hardware. It happened 2 or 3 times a few months ago and I didn't think much of it.\nNow it is happening much more frequently... Just for fun I tried to capture it with a screen recording... I thought I won't be able to do that anyway because it's in hardware.\nBut it turns out the interference / jitter does appear in the recording:\nSee here: the upper part jitters: http://youtu.be/6hA3ugF5sME\n(better quality video: http://cl.ly/2i460o0X3e3O/download/jitter.mp4)\nIt's probably not Chrome rendering issue because the jitter is not just in one textbox as it maybe seems by non careful observation. Logo and \"How to format\" section are included. I also think that it didn't always happen while in Chrome, but I'm not that sure.\nVery strange?\nUPDATE: actually this could still be hardware issue, of course... for example problems with graphics card. It is just that it's not the hardware problem in some circuit on the screen at the end of pipeline... if it was, then I couldn't capture it in the recording...\n\nA: That jitter is pure software. The CSS/javascript are not executing fast enough to prevent a redraw from being noticeable.\nYou could try reducing the load on the CPU by quitting other apps or just run some instruments on the pages where you see jitter and either block the js that is slow or decide to edit your text elsewhere and then copy/paste it to avoid seeing the constraints being redrawn.\nThe detailed video was awesome and allowed me to be certain what I was seeing was software.\n", "Q: installing older version of wine on Mavericks from tar.bz2 file I remember that a program I desperately need to use stopped working after I updated wine. The last version I remember it worked perfectly on is the very version 1.5.8, which I have downloaded from here: http://www.winehq.org/announce/1.5.8 as a tar.bz2 file.\nAfter all the struggles I have gone through trying to successfully install this specific release of wine (1.5.8) I have given up and decided to turn to this site for help.\nI always installed and managed wine via MacPorts but this time it will not be possible since MacPorts doesn't allow me to install older versions of wine. I would like to ask you please if anyone could help me and tell me (explain) how to install this particular version of wine from that tar.bz2 file.\nI'm using OS X 10.9, Mavericks. The program I'm trying to run is Lingea Lexicon 5 but it's not really important, I remember it worked perfectly on 1.5.8 but it doesn't on the current release 1.6.2, it crashes at start.\nPlease bear in mind that I'm not an experienced user of Terminal, I can do some basic things but my knowledge of commands is limited. Thank you again.\n\nA: MacPorts\nIt is possible to install older editions of software using MacPorts. The following article explains how, How to install an older version of a port.\nThe example given by the article using this notation for the tcl package:\nsudo port activate tcl @8.4.16_0\n\nTry this for the wine package:\nsudo port activate wine @1.5.8\n\nHomeBrew\nAlternatively, consider installing using the HomeBrew project. This article by David Baumgold walks through the steps required, Installing Wine on Mac OS X.\nbrew is also able to install a specific version of a package, see Homebrew install specific version of formula?\ntar.bz2\nIf you want to manually install wine from the downloaded tar.bz2 source, follow the steps in Wine User Guide: 2.3. Installing Wine from source.\nThis approach will require installing the Xcode command line tools and dealing with dependencies. Because of this, I highly recommend using brew or another pre-built package approach.\nosxwinebuilder\nAn open source project called osxwinebuilder attempts to ease the process of building wine from source. This project may be helpful as it claims:\n\nThe goal of this project is to provide easy-to-use scripts for cleanly\n  building and installing Wine and its prerequisite software into a\n  self-contained directory hierarchy on Mac OS X.\n\nEmulators\nIf you encounter problems compiling from source, consider using a PC emulator such as VMware Fusion, Parallels, or Virtual Box. All these can run Windows on your Mac and thus run Lingea Lexicon 5 for you. In addition, VMware Fusion and Parallels both offer commercial support should you encounter problems.\n", "Q: \"Other\" just ate my hard drive When I woke up his morning, I had >80 GB of free space on my hard drive. Over the last four hours, in which I wasn't even around, something filled my hard drive completely. I would attach a screenshot, but there isn't even room to save one. \nI'm currently looking at around 210GB of 'other' on my 250GB HD - and I have no idea where it came from. It's always been fairly stable until today. \nI am, of course, deleting everything I can afford to, but unless someone knows of something huge I can nuke where 'other' is, I don't think I'll be able to get it down to a manageable size.\nI have a Time Machine backup. If I restore to it, will it also contain this huge amount of 'other'? Or is there a better option?\n\nA: There are many things that 'other' could be. This Apple KB article details what 'other' space is:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X: What is \"other\" space in About This Mac?\n…but basically, there's not only one thing that it could be, or one thing that everyone's suffered from.\nYour best bet is probably to run something like Daisy Disk or similar to find large files to delete. Alternatively, use Finder and search for large files sorted by Date Modified so that you can see recent files that might be taking up large quantities of space.\n\nA: I recommend checking out a tool (there are many others) such as DaisyDisk which easily allows you to drill down and find space hogs.  The trial version should do the job in a hurry.\n\n\n\n\nA: Where do you see that \"other\"?\nFree some space if you can and use DiskWave to check exactly where the files are.\n", "Q: Setting up CrashPlan with NAS drive attached to Airport Extreme? I have one of the new (well it's not so new anymore) Airport Extremes with ac wireless. I am using Crashplan to back up my data online, but I also want a more local backup -- so I would like to hook up a big external hard drive to the Airport Extreme as an NAS, and back up my computer using Crashplan's software to the Airport Extreme NAS. What's the best way to set this up? I know that Drobo's NAS can install Crashplan on the NAS, but since you can't install any software on a hard drive using the Airport Extreme as an NAS, what's the ideal way to set this up?\n\nA: You should be able to use the drive on the Airport Extreme as a destination folder for your CrashPlan backups. CrashPlan can backup to a local folder, or to an external hard disk in addition to their online service. You should be able to treat the NAS in the same way as you treat an external hard drive, from CrashPlan's point of view. At least, that's my guess, but I haven't tested this.\nThis assumes you want to backup from your computer TO the NAS, and not that you want to backup FROM the NAS to CrashPlan's servers (although I'd imagine both are possible).\n", "Q: If I connect an Ethernet cable, will my Mac automatically select the fastest route for local network traffic? Background\nI have a fairly robust network setup at home, but am a little unclear on internal Mac networking. My LAN consists of two bridged AirPort Extremes and a cable modem. Everything is connected using Cat 5e inside the walls, and Cat 6 patch elsewhere. Additionally, I have a Netgear Gigabit switch in my office.\nI use my MacBook Pro throughout the house on Wifi. When I bring it in the office, I connect an Ethernet cable for 1000BASE-T awesomeness. Elsewhere on the network I have backups and a media server.\nQuestion\nWhen I connect the MBP to Ethernet, will the Mac software determine the fastest route for local network traffic? I can see by the activity lights on the switch that I have a full Gigabit Ethernet connection, but since Wifi is still on, I'm not clear which network mode is being utilized.\n\nA: You want to make sure that your Mac's ethernet device is before the wifi device in the system's network service order. In System Preferences, Go to Network; under the device listing, click the 'gear' icon and select 'Set Service Order.' Drag 'Ethernet' to the top. Per my understanding, all traffic will attempt to be routed through the top-most device, and will only be routed through devices lower in the chain should the above route(s) be unavailable.\n", "Q: Which MacBook screen should I buy? My wife broke the screen on her MacBook. I want to buy a replacement and try to put it in myself. How do I determine the correct screen to buy? It is a 13.3\" screen. But, the computer is several years old.\nI am not asking for a product recommendation. I am going to buy the official Apple screen. I just read that not every screen fits every MacBook. For instance, one site said I have to worry about which wireless antenna I have. Another said I have to worry about unibody or not. But, I don't know the various specs of the MacBook my wife has. I tried to look up the serial number online, but it doesn't list the model number when I do that.\n\nA: Sounds to me like you need to identify your Mac model more than anything else. Give a try How to identify which model is my Mac?\nOnce you know your precise model, you may want to go to ifixit.com to identify the precise piece number you’re looking for.\n", "Q: Alternative of Microsoft Visio? I am looking for a good alternative of Microsoft Visio for Mac OS X.\nI need an application to create a schedule of the month or something like this and then to print it.\n\nA: I recommend OmniGraffle Pro (http://www.omnigroup.com/omniGraffle) from the Omni Group.  They have a standard and pro version.  You can download trial version of either the standard or pro version.\n\nA: Don't forget that Google Drive has a new Web-based App that will let you edit/import/export Visio documents -- its called Lucid Diagram.\nThere is a free account and a pro verion:\nLimits on free account: \n-60 Objects per document \n-Can publish to web/pdf/png/jpeg \n-No wireframing or mockups \n-No revision history \n-No Visio Import/Export capabilities \n-Limit of 2 collaborators per document Here is a link to our pricing page with a list of levels and features https://www.lucidchart.com/users/registerLevel\nCurrently there is a 14 day free pro trial.\n\nA: While you can use Visio for this sort of thing, it's not really ideal.  One method is to use the normal Calendar App, but it might be hard to get it to print how  you like it.  \nAnother is to use something like Numbers from the iWork suite.  It has several templates that you can use for creating planners (daily/weekly/monthly), and while some may need customising toe be exactly what you need, you will only need to do it once, then re-save the template to use again.  Here are some screenshots of standard templates with the latest version of Numbers:\n\n\n\n\nA: Why not try Edraw Max - A nice Visio replacement that includes the Calendar drawing suite you want. \nI like the appearance of its interface. Not much too learn, no difficult commands.\nIt could import/export Visio files. Easy to pulish to PDF, Word, JPEG, PNG, Html, SVG, etc.\n\n", "Q: How to redirect out going traffic to an IP address to another host name? How can I redirect an IP say 203.130.48.8-bj-cnc or 203.130.48.8 to Google.com in host file (or other places)?\nIt looks like host file doesn't redirect an ip address (only the domain names).\n\nA: You don't specify whether you want to block incoming traffic from that host name or outgoing or both. You also don't mention what version of Mac OS X you are running and whether or not you are trying to block that host with a specific application like Little Snitch or similar. Some logs would be helpful as well. Consult this page to help you formulate better questions for the community to be able to answer.\n203.130.48.8-BJ-CNC is a valid hostname according to IETF standard RFC 952.\n\nA \"name\" (Net, Host, Gateway, or Domain name) is a text string up\nto 24 characters drawn from the alphabet (A-Z), digits (0-9), minus\nsign (-), and period (.).\n\nTo block outgoing traffic to it, use the hostname in your /etc/hosts file like so:\n127.0.0.1    203.130.48.8-bj-cnc\n\nThen do:\nsudo dscacheutil -flushcache\n\nto load the new rules.\nIf you want to be able to block outgoing traffic to the actual ip address of the machine you'll need to use Mac's builtin packet filter (originally from OpenBSD's excellent PF. A pf.conf rule would look like this:\nblock out log quick on $ext_if proto { tcp, udp, icmp } to 203.130.48.8\n\nBlocking incoming traffic from that ip is generally handled just fine by using Mac OS X's default application firewall in  -> System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Firewall. Alternatively you can set the policy via the commandline like so:\nsudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setblockall on\n\nfor thoroughness, you may also want to block all icmp requests:\nsudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setstealthmod on\n\nand finally enable it thus:\nsudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setglobalstate on\n\n\nA: Since 203.130.48.8-bj-cnc (subtype ip address) and 203.130.48.8 (traditional ip address) are \"ip address\" instead of \"alias,\" adding them in host file will not do anything. The system will bypass the rules you set up.\nThe only way to redirect ip request is to use third party software like little snitch. They are usually not free. This is because Unix based system will go through ip address directly when requesting instead of wasting time on capture them to enhance performance. Third party software basically reduce the overall efficiency by query ip requests.\nAnother way to do it is to set up rules in your gateway, that's only if your gateway can do it and if you have a gateway to begin with.\nI know host file is probably the most convenient way to deal with this, but it simply won't work. Move on, stop wasting time on it.\n", "Q: iPad LTE edition and SIM from smartphone I am thinking if it is possible to use my phone's SIM card in iPad's SIM slot?\nThis because I need the 4G just only very few times, so when it will be necessary to use it, I will move the SIM from my smart-phone to the iPad.\nIt is possible this scenario? \n\nA: Yes, this should work fine. I don't know if I have to answer any longer, but you have to check whether your device has a simlock by a provider. Else you should be free to do this.\nYou could also use personal hotspot.\n", "Q: Do iCloud email addresses ignore periods like Gmail? In a Gmail email, you can put periods in your email, but in the end, the address is seen without them.\nSo dave.tess@gmail.com is also seen as davetess@gmail.com or even d.a.v.e.tess@gmail.com.  \nMy question is, does iCloud handle emails this way too? If I have an address with periods in it, could I send an email to the same address without periods and receive it? \n\nA: No, this doesn't work for iCloud email addresses. Just tried it and the email failed to deliver — the email must be exactly correct.\n\n\nA: You can create an email alias in iCloud to accept your dotted version.\nEg. \nIf your iCloud address is mydoghasfleas@icloud.com, then my.dog.has.fleas@icloud.com won't work, unless you add an email alias for it in your iCloud email account. See:\nhttp://help.apple.com/icloud/#mm6b1a490a\nFor full instructions on how to create your email aliases.\n\nA: Technically this depends.\nIf the address was set up under the me.com days and you already created an alias with the dot then it will work. Otherwise, it will not.\nI have an address previously set up with an alias (during iCloud's me.com days) and mail will be received at the \"dotted\" address. I think currently iCloud does not allow additional aliases if you were not grandfathered under me.com.\n", "Q: Is there a way to auto-upload photos to Flickr on Mac? I'm using Dropbox as my primary auto-upload tool from iOS, and I'd like to streamline the process of getting photos to Flickr. Rather than using the Flickr iOS app's built in auto-upload, I'd like to only upload the photos once (via Dropbox) and then have something monitor the Camera Uploads folder on the Mac for new files.\nIs there a tool that monitors a folder on a Mac and uploads any newly added photos to Flickr with privacy set to private?\n\nA: For an OS-independent solution, the following IFTTT recipe looks like it will do what you need.\nUpload to dropbox - push through to flickr\nIn a nutshell, the recipe monitors a specific folder in Dropbox (the recipe uses \"/Flickr\", but you can change that) and uses the \"Upload public photo from URL\" action on the Flickr channel to upload the image.\nThere are a number of recipes that use Dropbox and Flickr, so even if this one isn't exact (and you don't want to customize) you should be able to find one you want. Here's another possiblity: Move Dropbox photos from Camera Uploads folder to flickr gallery.\n\nA: Update: I found a new solution. It's an app called UPPR. It is currently $2.99USD on the Mac App Store. The app is simple and great, I use it now to monitor my OneDrive (switched from DropBox) pictures folder. It passively monitors a folder and uploads anything in it to Flickr. Super easy. You can set tags and privacy for all uploads.\n\nA: See this, http://www.picbackman.com/picbackman-for-mac-os/ You can automate the process of uploading photos from Mac to your Dropbox account. The desktop app also keeps a check on new additions. As soon as you upload new photos to your iPhoto library, the PicBcakMan desktop application will automatically upload it to Dropbox account.\nGive it a try.\n", "Q: How to identify which model is my Mac? Sometimes, you need to know the exact model of your Macintosh. When you want to know to which version of OS X you can upgrade your system, e.g., or when you intend to buy parts for self-repairing your computer.\nBut Apple tend to name its computers with simple, non-specific names. There have been plenty of different MacBook Pro, and knowing yours has a screen with a 15ʺ display isn’t enough to narrow it down.\nHow to identify which exact model is a given Mac?\n\nA: There are several way to achieve this. Macintosh models can be identified by several means:\n\n\n*\n\n*The “human-readable” detailed name Apple uses: e.g., MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2009)\n\n*Model Identifiers: e.g., MacBookPro5,3\n\n*Model number: e.g., A1286\n\n*Serial number\n\n*…\n\n\nWhile two Macs with the same model identifier or model number may not be exactly the same (e.g., a MacBookPro5,3 may have a 2.66GHz, 2.8GHz or 3.06GHz Core 2 Duo processor, and the GPU may differ as well on those models), they pinpoints models with a precision sufficient for most uses.\nIf your Mac is running properly on OS X, you can get the Model Identifier by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Applications > Utilities folder.\n\n*Run System Profiler. (System Information in Mavericks)\n\n*On the left panel of the window that opens, select Hardware (the default selection)\n\n*The Model Identifier appears with other info about the Mac in the right panel, including the serial number.\n\n\nFor other ways to get to the serial number of your Mac you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select About this Mac in the Apple menu on the top left of your screen. In the small window that appears, click the system version (e.g., Version 10.9.2) twice. Your Mac serial number is displayed instead.\n\n*Or, more simply and especially useful if your Mac is not booting, read it on the Mac itself, as the serial number is printed on it somewhere, in very tiny letters. Older Mac laptops with removable batteries have the serial number inside the case with the battery removed. You can find out precisely where the serial number on your Mac lives at this Apple KB link.\n\n\nOnce you have the serial number, you can get the precise model name by going to this page on the Apple website and typing your entire serial number in the adequate field.\nIf you need info on materials that your Mac support, or if you need to find the model number of your Mac when you have its identifier or serial number, you can use various databases that exists here and there. I usually go to this very useful page from everymac.com, as it list quite a big deal of technical info on each model. You can type model identifiers, model number or the few last symbols of a serial number to find its related info.\n\nA: Open System Information and open the About this Mac (Command - I)\nFrom there you have a Support tab that links to the user manuals, specifications and more. Furthermore, you can also use the overview information from System Information to get the marketing version which identifies your Mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro, Retina, 13-inch, Early 2013\n\n*Mac Pro, Late 2013\n\n\nEtc....\n", "Q: How can I preserve BCC information from iOS Mail? I just discovered that iOS Mail does not preserve BCC information when you're sending a mail, which is obviously atrocious…\nHow can I get it do that?\n\nA: This also occurs with other mail clients on Gmail account.\nAfter a bit of googling, it appears the issue has existed for years, and is likely related to Gmail behaviour with SMTP and IMAP. My guess is that Google create the “Sent Messages” entry from what the SMTP server gets in its DATA command, and discard anything a mail client may want to save through IMAP. Doesn’t seem it will be changed anytime soon.\nIf this is a rare occurrence, you may want to log into gmail.com when you need to send a message with BCC. If this happens more often, you may want to use the Gmail app or another Gmail specific client.\n\nA: When viewing the index list of messages in the Sent folder in the viewer pane, as opposed to viewing the headers of an individual message that might be viewable in the preview pane (or standalone window if you had double-clicked on that message), that BCC recipients are not visible in the \"To\" column of the index list of messages in the Sent folder, even though they are clearly visible in the BCC headers of the actual sent messages themselves.\nFor that matter, neither will a message's CC recipients be visible if recipients were specified in that message's \"To\" field. However, a message's CC recipients are visible in the \"To\" column of the messages list, if the \"To\" field of that message was blank.\nBut BCC recipients are never displayed in the \"To\" column of the index list of messages in the Sent folder, regardless of whether any recipient addresses were specified in the \"To\" and/or \"CC\" fields of the specific messages or not.\n", "Q: Weird OS X Terminal Bug: Cursor won't go back to end of line after backtracking I have an interesting problem: when I type something in the terminal as follows: \n~ me$ hello<cursor>\n\nand backtrack:\n~ me$ he<cursor>llo\n\nand then try to return to the end to continue typing, perhaps after fixing an error, I get stuck before the last character:\n~ me$ hell<cursor stuck here>o\n\nAnyone know how to fix this?

The idea of having a single application type per extension and using 'open with' is too painful to use on a repeated basis.\n(Now, answering the 'why' - to be honest, I dont have this requirement with mp3 files but with source code from different projects.

I have done it for Windows machines before, and usually I could just replace the preference files/registry entries right inside the .msi installer, using tools like Orca, Wise Package Studio and so on.\nI am new to macs, but when I try to look for something similar for OS X, all I find is software to make packages from scratch (PackageMaker, Iceberg, etc.), but nothing for editing already created .pkg files.\nSo here is the question: is there a way to easily edit the content of .pkg file (replace some files, add a script, etc.), without having to install/unpackage it and then package the configured stuff back?\n\nA: You can use the Flat Package Editor from Apple.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple's Developer downloads site and download the Auxiliary Tools for Xcode - Late July 2012.\n\n*Once downloaded, open the DMG.\n\n*Find PackageMaker.app and open the package contents, then navigate to Contents/Resources.\n\n*Copy Flat Package Editor.app to /Applications or elsewhere then open it.\n\n\nFrom this app you can open a .pkg and edit the contents by dragging files out, editing them and dragging them back in, then saving the package.\n\nPackages can be resigned using the button on the title bar:\n\n\nA: I am not aware of any Apple recommended tools to edit existing package, pkg or mpkg, files. Most packages are signed and thus any changes will invalidate their signature; although resigning is simple enough using pkgbuild and an appropriate installer certificate.\nWrapping Up Existing Packages\nConsider creating a wrapper multi-package that adjusts any required files after installation. With this approach you can bundle up existing packages and then run post-install/update scripts as required.\npkgbuild\nThere is little documentation about crafting packages as Apple traditionally relied on the graphical tool PackageMaker. Since Mac OS X 10.8, the PackageMaker tool has been replaced by the command line tools productbuild and pkgbuild.\nThe tool you will want to investigate is pkgbuild. This tool eases the creation of packages containing multiple packages and scripts.

How many alarms can be set on an iPhone 5? Can you set one for every minute of the day (1440) or is there a limit on the number of alarms?\n\nA: Well if we want to be 100% accurate, there is a limit. It is the storage capacity of your iPhone 5s. Somewhere that alarm is taking up space and once it runs out, so do the alarms.\nI've just tapped the '+' followed by \"Save\" and got up to over 300 alarms before I realized how much fun I'll have going back and deleting them all. Or,  since their default value after creation is set to \"on\", absolutely drive people crazy at work tomorrow. \nAlso, since it only took 5 minutes, it is a dang good prank to play on a friend - or enemy :)\nSo, realistically grgarside is right. There is not limit set via programming; however, like I mentioned, the storage capacity is the true cap - eventually at least.\n\nA: There is basically no limit. You can set one for every minute of the day, or even more than one for every minute.\n\nA: Every minute; 1,440 (24 hours* 60 minutes) then add the possibilities for days (i.e Mondays and Tuesdays, every Wednesday etc.) which is 2 (1 for not that day as a possibility and 1 for that day being a possibility; so 2) to the power of how many days you can set (7) gives us 2^7 or 2*2*2*2*2*2*2 which is 128. \nSo if we combine those two together (128*1,440) we get 184,320 different possible alarms. If your phone could store all these, I'm not certain, but in theory that's the max amount of different alarms. \nIf we include text descriptions then the number would be such a great amount that no device could ever display it (as we have to take into consideration how many possibilities there are; just two letters in a row with the english alphabet (26 letters), that would be 26*26 (676) without symbols like periods or commas, and without the possibility of different sizes of letters (lower/uppercase). \nIf an alarm text description could include 20 letters, that can ONLY be letters which are either upper or lowercase, and NO symbols, that would be 26^20 (thats 26*26*26*26*26*26*26*26*26*26*26*26*26*26*26*26*26*26*26*26), and that number would equal 19,928,148,895,209,409,152,340,197,376. \nTL;DR:\nSo anyway, 184,320 different possible alarms if you exclude counting different text descriptions, like a sane person. Or a much, much bigger number if you do. Either way your phone probably cannot store that many alarms, so realistically it's probably in the thousands somewhere.\n", "Q: Running shell commands with Automator: how to create a droplet launching an \"exec\" command?

Download speed is reduced by a factor of 3 to 5, and ping times jump from 33ms to 600 - 800ms. This makes it frustratingly slow to use any web application, and appears to happen when some update is going on on the iPhone. However, the last episode has been going on non-stop for more than 12 hours. At a 1.5Mbps DSL, I have no idea what sort of update could take that long, or if something other than an update is going on.\nI only have limited access to the iPhone (it's not mine and the owner got quite annoyed with my requests to use their mobile data plan), but I have full control of the router. Banning it by its MAC isn't exactly a solution. What else can be done?

What do I have to do in order to get it / get rid of it again?\n\nA: Before you begin, make a copy of the document somewhere.  Don't try this on the original in case you run into additional problems. \nCan you select the text before and after this text box? EG if you drag to highlight in the paragraph before the text box and you continue to drag (even if you have to go to the bottom of the document) down the document does it highlight?\nIf so cut that part of the document and paste it into textpad, then save it as a plain text file (use TXT; do not use RTF, RTFD, or DOC/DOCX) and quit out of Textpad.\nSave the document, open it back up and open the text file in Textpad. Paste all the text from the textpad document back where it came from and re-apply your formatting. \nSometimes, the document itself is damaged.  This trick might help.  Open the document and turn on invisibles (the backwards P in the toolbar). Now click in the document and select all. Scroll down to the bottom of the document, and while you are holding the shift key click just to the left of the very last paragraph mark. So the entire document is selected except the last paragraph mark. Copy what you just selected, open a new Word document, and paste. See if you can edit that text box in the new document.\nAnd if none of this works at least you have an unchanged version of the document to continue to hammer on.\n", "Q: Is it possible to take a video screenshot (screenshow?) of what's occurring on a Macbook Pro's screen?

Today the heartbleed OpenSSL exploit was announced in the wild, which allows an attacker to surreptitiously detect and steal private server keys (allowing them to MitM and decrypt your encrypted data and steal passwords).  This affects OpenSSL versions including 1.0.1f which is the version on my up-to-date Mavericks computer Mac (because I used port/brew to install other software which updated my openssl without me realizing it):\n$ openssl version\nOpenSSL 1.0.1f 6 Jan 2014\n\nThis demonstrates I am not using the Mavericks version of OpenSSL:\n$ which openssl\n/opt/local/bin/openssl\n\n\nOpenSSL released a fix today in 1.0.1g and I wonder how I can get this fixed version installed over my current version?\n\nA: For resolving OCSP Status Request extension unbounded memory growth (CVE-2016-6304) on macOS Sierra using brew with System Integrity Protection enabled:\n\n\n*\n\n*Temporarily adjust permissions on /usr/local so brew can update:\nsudo chgrp -R admin /usr/local\nsudo chmod -R g+w /usr/local\n\n\n*Install the updated version of OpenSSL (you probably want 1.0.2i):\nbrew install openssl\n\n\n*You may want/need to delete an existing symlink to openssl from /usr/local/bin:\nrm /usr/local/bin/openssl\n\n\n*Re-link the proper brew version:\nsudo ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.2i/bin/openssl /usr/local/bin/openssl\n\n\n*Restore original permissions on /usr/local/bin:\nsudo chown root:wheel /usr/local\n\n\nA: Whoever doesn't want to use brew or ports and just wants to replace the default OpenSSL 0.9.8 installation can always disable system integrity protection by rebooting into recovery mode (cmd+R) and issuing\ncsrutil disable\n\nand afterwards compile openssl with\n./config --prefix=/usr\nmake install\n\nIt successfully replaced OpenSSL in ElCapitan for me and I was able to compile curl and apache's httpd 2.4 without any issue directly from sources. The reasoning behind the method some might consider drastic is that ElCapitan is no longer maintained by Apple and no updates are forthcoming so it likely won't break. Secondly, it saves you from pointing to openssl folder in /usr/local for every program you compile making compilation more robust.\n\nA: For what it's worth, I just used homebrew (http://brew.sh/):\nbrew update  \nbrew install openssl  \nbrew link --force openssl \nopenssl version -a  \n\nIf one of the bad versions come up (1.0.1a-f), you can figure out which version of openssl you're using, this way:\nwhich openssl\n\nOften this is from /usr/bin. To make sure you get the updated version, drop a symlink into /usr/local/bin to point to the updated openssl, like this: \nln -s /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.1g/bin/openssl /usr/local/bin/openssl\n\n\nAs an alternative to that final step, some people replace the openssl in /usr/bin with a symlink to /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.1g/bin/openssl (or whatever your version is): \nmv /usr/bin/openssl /usr/bin/openssl_OLD  \nln -s /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.1g/bin/openssl /usr/bin/openssl\n\nBut this is known to cause problems with some more recent versions of OSX.  Better to just insert a new symlink into /usr/local/bin, which should take precedence on your path over /usr/bin.  \n\nA: Or for those who are using mac ports, and are not worried about keeping the version\nsudo port upgrade openssl\n\nsimples :-)\n", "Q: Add printer via lpadmin with custom queue Is there a way to add a printer via the command line that has a custom queue that has two words separated by a space?\nMy command so far is below but does not set the custom queue.

But when a THIRD AirPort Express is on, the wifi slows down to about 100k/s\nThis is independently from which of the three AirPort Express is turned off (so not a malfunction with a particular one) I have run wireless diagnostics which finds no problem.\nCan anyone help, this is driving me mad.\nBackground\nI have one AirPort Extreme serving as base station and three airport express (all latest model) serving as relay stations and to stream music in different zones, they are all connected by ethernet, the ethernet network has been checked and works fine.\nI followed the Apple instructions and they are all setup as \"create wireless network\" with the exact same network name, in the airport utility app the three airport express appear underneath the airport extreme, wireless settings are on \"automatic\"\nThere is no other wifi routers, modems or printers in the building, but we are in the very center of the city and there are lots of wifi activity around.\n\nA: This sounds as a channel overlap problem to me. Apple Airport devices try to use distinct and far-apart channels but may make a wrong automatic choice when there is a lot of interference from other WiFi stations, sometimes depending on the order you turn them on.\nIf you really need four access points (Extreme + 3 x Express) you either live in a really big house or those APs are not optimally placed. I'd suggest first using one AP (the Extreme), than go around every room and plot your signal strength and take note of other networks that pop up with their channel info. That way you find dark spots in the house and strategically place the Expresses to cover them.\nAdditionally, if you only need the AE to Airplay music to the speakers on the audio port you actually don't need to create an additional wireless network.\n", "Q: What happens if I buy a paid game while it's free?

You don’t get refunds if the price goes down or charged if it goes up.\nMany apps become free over time, and that's one of the ways how I save a lot of money.\nSo in short, free = free (watch out for in-app purchases though, they are never free!)\nTo give you a better detail about updating apps:\n\n*\n\n*It's free if they update the same app, not if they decide to put a complete new application in the AppStore.\n\n", "Q: How to disable CMD + E to eject?

I just got my iPad and wanted to transfer the game on the iOS 6.1.6 device to my iPad. What I was wondering was, if it's even possible to link a game on Clash of Clans from an iOS 6 device to an iOS 7 device, and if so how do I do so?\n\nA: Yes it is possible. All you need to do is have both your devices next to that you want to make the transfer with. Then tap the settings button in clash of clans and you will see \"link a device\". Follow the on screen instructions after that.\nIf you have a new account already made on your new device past town hall 4 you are unable to link them. You will need to contact supercell for further information, which is what I had to do.\n\nA: With a 3rd party USB iPhone file viewing application on your Mac or PC, such as iExplorer or DiskAid, one can try copying all the files from an app on one iOS device to your Mac, and then copy them all of them onto the other iOS device.  To be safe, force-quit the apps on both devices first and do a complete backup of the target device before trying this method, as it can potentially completely mess up an app, and require it to be deleted and re-installed.\n\nA: CoC can be transferred with the \"link a device\"-option. \nAnother way to do this is by using the same apple id for gamecenter.\nYou can change the apple id under Game Center in settings>game center.\nVia this way it will also be possible to transfer account that are linked to gamecenter, but do not have an \"link a device\" option built in.\n\nA: *\n\n*Download iExplore on your computer.\n\n*Connect your old iOS device to your computer, browse to /private/var/mobile/Containers folder then copy the Clash of Clans folder to somewhere in your computer.\n\n*Connect the new device then copy that folder to /private/var/mobile/Containers (iOS7) or /var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application (iOS8).\n\n*Login with your related Game Center ID.\n\n*It will ask you if you want to play that Clash of Clans account or not.\n\n\nSource: http://cocland.com/tutorials/transfer-clash-of-clans-from-old-ios-devices\n\nA: The new version will fix the problem is not loaded games\n\nA: Maybe can be possible making a backup with iTools and restoring into the new one.\n", "Q: Measuring page download speed Network Link Conditioner I'd like to use Network Link Conditioner in conjunction with a local page download speed tool so that I can see how long certain elements take to download when I restrict connection speeds.\nCan someone recommend a page download speed tool (with waterfall visuals) that works well with Network Link Conditioner?\n\nA: I am a big fan of using Safari's built in Web Inspector for this sort of task.\nOpen Safari preferences, go to Advanced and tick the check to show the Develop menu in the menu bar.\nNow you can refresh a page and see detailed information on the Timelines section to graph page load times, delays and whatever sequence of steps was needed to render the current page.\n\nYou can also use command line tools like curl in conjunction with the time command or using curl's internal timing options curl --trace-time to pick apart some of the files or scripts if you want to get a statistical level of repeatability as opposed to a broad overview of an entire page load.\n\nA: Not to spoil anything, but I use FireFox for the same\nTools - WebDeveloper-Network\n\nYou can narrow it down by selecting at bottom the ALL, or HTML or ... ect...\nThis is a sample for this page: Measuring page download speed Network Link Conditioner\n", "Q: Are in-app purchases marked as such on App Store receipts?

I have to delete and try again, sometimes it works, more often it gets replaced again! This is annoying.\nI saw another question with an answer that told of an overlay showing the original word and how to use arrow keys and enter to replace what was correctly written in the first place; that did not work in my test on an email messsage.

I wondered if there is a plist file I might remove to re-do a prefs for the Mac? \nCLARIFYING: While I appreciate the info on turning off spell-check in browsers, I guess I failed to state that this is a system-wide problem, not just in email or browsers. If I write that cool word in Adobe Illustrator, it also changes it to Colonna.

What versions of OS X come default with the affected versions of OpenSSL?\nAll Internet traffic right now is clogged with the same generic information in regards to the Heartbleed bug, without any attention paid to Macintosh in the environment. I am looking for information on Mac OS X client as well as Mac OS X server. Right now it's impractical for me to check all the Macs in the environment for their specific version of OpenSSL, but I already have the Mac OS X version information for the affected machines.\n\nA: No versions of OS X are affected (nor is iOS affected). Only installing a third party app or modification would result in a Mac or OS X program having that vulnerability / bug in OpenSSL version 1.0.x\n\nApple deprecated OpenSSL on OS X in December of 2012 if not earlier. No version of OpenSSL that is vulnerable to CVE-2014-0160 (a.k.a the Heartbleed Bug)\nApple provides several alternate application interfaces that provide SSL to Mac developers and has this to say about OpenSSL:\n\nOpenSSL does not provide a stable API from version to version. For this reason, although OS X provides OpenSSL libraries, the OpenSSL libraries in OS X are deprecated, and OpenSSL has never been provided as part of iOS. Use of the OS X OpenSSL libraries by apps is strongly discouraged.\n\nSpecifically, the latest version of OpenSSL shipped by Apple is OpenSSL 0.9.8y 5 Feb 2013 which does not appear to have the bug from newer versions of OpenSSL back ported to the code for Apple's version of the library.\nThe PDF of this documentation has some clearly written advice for developers and some sections that's useful for professionals or the security minded user as well.\n\n\n*\n\n*OpenSSL for Mac Developers and PDF version of Apple's Cryptographic Services Guide\nConsidering this, the only remaining issue would be additional software that were built against OpenSSL, e.g. several in Homebrew (brew update followed by brew upgrade) or MacPorts (port self update followed by port upgrade openssl) to update to the patched 1.x version of openSSL.\nAlso, you could use mdfind/mdls to check on files named openssl in case you have other applications that bundle that library as Apple recommends rather than depending on the \"safe\" version Apple still ships with OS X.\nfor ff in `mdfind kMDItemFSName = \"openssl\"`; do echo \"#### $ff\"; mdls $ff | grep kMDItemKind; done\n\n\nA: I have run openssl version on every Mac I could get my hands on1 and all of them show:\nOpenSSL 0.9.8y 5 Feb 2013\n\n…including the current latest version: OS X 10.9.2.\nTherefore I can conclude that no version of OS X is affected by Heartbleed.\n1 and also ones I couldn't and just had SSH — still tested though, production machines are important! All in all I tested around 30 machines with various versions of OS X.\n\nA: While OS X doesn't ship with the affected releases of OpenSSL, it's still strongly encouraged to do a openssl version in case one may have been installed as part of some  third party package.\nFor example, my computer reported OpenSSL 1.0.1f 6 Jan 2014 because it had been included as a dependency for something I had installed through MacPorts. sudo port upgrade outdated solved this, of course.\n", "Q: Copy and paste multiple things in macOS? I would like to be able to copy and paste multiple items on a Mac using key shortcuts.\nFor example, ⌘1 would copy item 1 and ⌘2 would copy item 2, etc.\nThen ⌘! would paste item 1 and ⌘@ would paste item 2.\nIf there is already a program for this please let me know or if you can make me one. Also I need it to be a free program.\n\nA: Slightly different implementation, but will do what you want:\nLaunchBar keeps a history of your clipboard, so you can copy multiple things using the usual keyboard combo ⌘ - C and then paste them using (for me, I may have changed from the default):\n\n\n*\n\n*hold down ⌘\n\n*\n\n*tap \\ to view clipboard history\n\n*tap ↓ until desired clipping is selected\n\n\n*release ⌘\nI've found it to be a pretty useful workflow. I do have to flush the clipboard history after dealing with passwords though. I keep it set at 10 items to limit my exposure if I forget.\nLaunchbar is free to try and $35 to buy. \nI'm not sure how they limit the free version now, but back before I bought it they let you do five types of activities per login, so you could do the copy, paste, and clipboard history deletion freely without running into the limit\nI do not use it because I've found Launchbar to be more useful, but it looks like Alfred includes clipboard history in the unlimited free version.\nBased on the screenshot it looks like Alfred uses shortcuts closer to what you wanted. \n\nA: I used to use clipmenu but I moved onto an updated fork with more recent support called Clipy.\nIt has the same shortcuts as clipmenu (⌘+Shift+V to open the list of items to paste, etc) but the interface is a bit cleaner (also easier to edit Snippets).\n\nA: I really like Flycut. Available here: https://github.com/TermiT/Flycut\nLike all of the other answers here, it's a clipboard manager which stores every item you copy using ⌘ + c in a list. Then you can press ⌘ + ⇧ Shift + v to see a list of the items you have copied and choose one to paste.\nUnlike the other answers here, it's free, open source, and doesn't come with a load of other functionality. Also it is actively maintained unlike clipmenu (last release ClipMenu 1.0.0a1 released  Nov 11, 2014).\n\nA: From what I remember CopyPastePro is pretty close to what you want. I haven't used it much since OS X was released, they were very slow with their OS X rewrite. I currently use Alfred for my clipboard needs, but that implementation isn't as close to what you describe as CopyPastePro is.\nI used PTHPasteboard Pro for several years. It is probably the most powerful pasteboard utility that I used. IIRC it is probably the closest to what you describe and with some setup can be configured to work exactly as you describe.\nNone of these are free, but they are all reasonably priced.\n\nA: Alfred is not the best solution, but every other things mentioned here are many many worse\nI use Alfred with custom UI skin, removing all the messing colors and its logo, to make it more look like Spotlight\nHope, apple'll implement multiple clipboard/clipboard history in the Spotlight.\nupd:\nhttps://www.alfredapp.com/alfred-5-whats-new/\nBrief description:\n\n*\n\n*every action has customisable hotkey, e.g. open history, select, join-copy,,,\n\n*history is centred floating alfred panel-window\n\n*history might be infinite, i use it as my Knowledge Base! Never more notes for some commands phrases etc.\n\n*also it have snippets as a continuation of infinite clipboard. Sadly. User should manually add items to snippets.\n\n*many many settings. join-copy is configurable too\n\n*and much more\n\n\nA: I use clipmenu, it's been great, lots of customizable shortcuts: http://www.clipmenu.com/\nHere's what I like about it:\n\n*\n\n*Easy keyboard combo, hit ⌘ + ⇧ Shift + V (or customize it) and it brings up a small sensible fully keyboard navigable menu where you can select from your recent clipboard entries.\n\n*You can also optionally add saved snippets of text, I put my stupid auto generated Oracle password in there, win!\n\n*And other than that, it's stable and stays out of the way, you can configure it to start automatically on startup, so you never are without it, it's a life saver\n\n\nA: I use CopyPro.  https://copypro.app  It saves your cut / copy history and you can paste the 10 most recent items with command, control, and/ or fn + 0-9 number keys.  You can also edit and reorder the copy history easily and also to open at login by default and run in the background so you never loose any copied text you might accidentally overwrite.\n\nA: As a 'generic' answer, there are lots of clipboard managers on the Mac App Store, and elsewhere, that store successive entries from the clipboard, or multiple clipboards.\nMany of the existing answers have since been abandoned, and as recommendation QnAs are discouraged, I'm not going to cite specific examples!\n\nA: I'm coming back to macOS after decades on Windows and the built-in multi-clipboard is something I quickly realized I couldn't live without.\nCopyClip seems to be the lightest-weight, free option available in the Mac App Store.\n\nA: I found right now the new tool — Raycast!\nIt looks combination of power of Alfred and beauty of Spotlight!\nWill try. Yes, it has a clipboard history. Will update answer\nhttps://www.raycast.com/\n\n", "Q: How to copy my Mountain Lion system to another drive? I'm considering upgrading at long last to Mavericks, but need to feel confident that all my apps & workflows will work properly before committing 100%.  I boot off of an external Thunderbolt SSD normally, so that's where my current boot system is (with all my apps installed, etc.).\nI have an internal drive with a secondary simple boot partition, also on Mountain Lion.  I basically use it on those occasions I need to boot from a different partition to do disk diagnostics, test things out in a \"sandbox\" of sorts, etc.\nI'm wondering if I can copy my current Mountain Lion system volume - apps and all - to the internal boot partition, and then update THAT drive to Mavericks and run off it for a while until I'm confident that Mavericks is going to work for me.  At that point I would update my SSD and be committed.\nIs this viable?  I know that back in the pre-OSX days it was trivial to just copy a system folder and presto - it would boot on a different drive.  But I'm not quite sure this is still the case.\nTo reiterate, the internal drive I want to copy my system to is already a bootable system partition, so there should be no special blessing or anything required I would think.\n\nA: Cloned drives are generally not a problem. You don't want to do a simple drag/drop. \nSuperDuper from ShirtPocket will clone your drive and ensure it's bootable. CarbonCopyCloner will do the same. \nThere are some more details in How can I get my laptop's existing system onto a new replacement drive?\n\nA: You can use TimeMachine to save data you need (by default all information include entire system will be saved) and then restore it to new HDD. \n\nA: I ended up just imaging my SSD boot drive using Disk Utility and then restoring that image onto my secondary boot drive.

Is this symlinked Home gonna mess me up at some point? \nThe symlinked Home goes to Java 1.6 (which is what I believe Mavericks ships with?), but I have access to 1.7.\n\nA: No you didn't mess anything up.

I would like to have easy access to medical reports that were written with Microsoft Word:Mac so I am assuming easy navigation between the systems is a must.\n\nA: Since you are working in a laptop environment where memory can sometimes be limited, I would highly suggest going the route of setting up Windows using Bootcamp. The setup process for this is fairly straightforward (it walks you through the whole thing). If you haven't already purchased Dragon; however, there is a Mac version available.

I don't change my fonts often and Wireshark definitely doesn't need access to hundreds of fonts. \nCan someone explain what this font caching is, why it impedes the launching of applications (instead of being some background X11 process), and why it needs to happen so often?\nI'm not sure whether this is specific to OS X. \n\nA: Font caching is an operation done by the font rendering library, called by the application program.\nIn theory, it would allow for faster rendering, since list of available fonts on the system is already created, the system could even temporary save commonly used fonts for faster access.\nOn OS X, the position of directory for font cache within the library can be misconfigured, so the application program can not write the font cache. So font cache is created on the fly, every time you run the program. This is slow.\nYou can solve this problem by running your application as administrator (root) by typing \"su gimp\" once. Do not work in administrator mode, just run it once. In this way, font cache will be created (as administrator has root permission on font cache position), and the next time you start the program (as normal user), it will be faster.\n", "Q: How long are text messages saved in the iCloud server? ..and how can I get rid of them before they are subpoenaed?\n\nA: As of the last update of Apple's iOS Security Guide, May 2016:\n\niMessage messages are queued for delivery to offline devices. Messages are currently stored for up to 30 days.\n\n(emphasis mine)\nNote this time period has increased from a prior version of this guide, which stated that messages were queued for up to seven days.\nIf, by \"text message\", you actually mean SMS messages, those do not cross onto Apple's servers at all unless you have SMS Forwarding enabled, to have messages from your iPhone forwarded to other devices such as a Mac or iPad. Forwarded SMS messages are encrypted in the same method as iMessage messages (elaborated in the guide). It appears that the 30-day timeframe also applies to forwarded SMS messages.\n\nA: It's unclear how long the messages are stored after transmission through iMessage. But there are plenty of places to find the messages if truly needed. For example, in any iPhone backups, iCloud or local hard drive from iTunes backups: Both not-deleted messages (at the time the backup was taken) and many DELETED messages are available in the backups. I work on the program Decipher TextMessage which allows you to view these messages from the backups, and we've helped many people recover messages needed for court cases.\n\nA: iCloud makes multiple backups of your iOS devices over time, some of these backups are available to restore and some are not. Also you need to be clear on messages that have been deleted and messages that still exist, as both are still in the iCloud database.\nTo delete all data you would need to wipe the iOS device (there are many options on the market), wipe any iTunes backups on your PC/Mac and delete the iCloud backups of all devices that had that iMessage. \nEven then, you might not delete all the copies if they were intercepted while they were delivered or backed up to a location you cannot purge or control.\n", "Q: Can I add EAS support to Mac OS Is there a plugin, or some third party solution that I can install on OSX to get EAS support for native calendars and contacts apps?  \nI'd like to add \"internet accounts\" in the settings for my hotmail calendars and contacts, which use EAS (Exchange ActiveSync). \n\nA: As of April 2014, there are no third-party OS X applications or plug-ins that support Exchange ActiveSync.  There aren't any solutions to view your Hotmail calendar and contacts in an OS X desktop application.\n", "Q: Remove spacing between pages in microsoft word for mac How can I remove the spaces (header/footer areas) between pages in MS word? On my PC, I just double click the spaces and it automatically removes them. When I try on my Mac, it just opens the header and footer sections. \n\nA: That feature is not supported on any version of Office for Mac to date. The closest you can get is to change the view. Look towards the bottom left of the screen. You will see icons and the 4th one should be a different color than the other 5. The 2 furthest to the left will allow you to have something that somewhat does the feature that you are looking for. One is called draft view and one is called outline view.\nOr you can choose Notebook layout view. This has no gap but makes your document look like a “real notebook”\n\nA: This feature was added in Word 2016 for OS-X. \nSimply hover the cursor over the break between two pages, then double click. \n\n", "Q: Will my other partitions be wiped when doing a clean install of Mavericks? Situation\nI have two partitions: Mac OS X, and Windows Bootcamp. Will the Windows partition get caught in the wiping process when attempting a Mavericks clean install? I think people call it spring cleaning. The clean install is due to the program clutter I have (python, mysql, apache2, etc).\nI'm using a Macbook Pro (Early 2011).\n\nA: \nThe windows partition wont be touched if your just re-installing on\n  the Mac partition. unless you format the entire disk then you have a\n  problem\n\n*\"More in depth explanation\nPartition Map or Table  - is instructions written at the beginning of the drive that tell the hardware it's running from: what, how many, and where the partitions are on the drive. There is only one partition map on the drive. It can be MBR or GUID.\nPartition  - is a space on the drive that appears as another volume, but still resides on the same piece of physical hardware.\nFormatting - is how a entire drive or partition is structured to hold data, one drive can be partitioned into many separate partitions each with their own formatting. The Partition Map holds all the information of what is what.\nChanging the partition map/table scheme will erase all data on the entire drive, it's like burning a treasure map, no directions anymore.\nChanging the format of a single partition on a multi-partitioned drive only erases the data on the partition being formatted.\"* \nSOURCE : https://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-3044\n", "Q: Would using thunderbolt-to-hdmi help? Late 2013 Macbook Pro 15.4\" 2.6Ghz\nI connect HDMI and not always do the full spectrum of resolutions appear within the list of choices?\nSystem Preferences (app) -> Displays (preference icon) -> Display (tab) -> Scaled (tab) \nWhat would cause this? \nMonitor is more of a TV I guess: Seiki 4K 39-inch. \nEven if 4k would perhaps cause a problem, 1080p, 1080i, and even 1440x900 failed to appear a good portion of the time.\nIs this perhaps a hardware issue with the MBP's HDMI port?\nWould it help if I used the thunderbolt-to-HDMI cable instead? Perhaps because of a faulty HDMI port maybe? \n\nA: Option+click Scaled\nYou can toggle between Apple’s easy-to-understand “Larger Text”–“More Space” icons mode and the other mode listing specific resolutions. To toggle, hold down the Option key while clicking Scaled radio button.\n\n\nRetina\nAs for that comment “Don’t used scaled.” on the Question, that is wrong advice. Scaled options are Retina-style by default, more commonly known as HiDPI. Note the checkbox Show low resolution modes in the second screen shot above. Checking that box and choosing a resolution listed with the notation (low resolution) means you are disabling the Retina feature and scaling up the image crudely (wasting pixels). \n", "Q: How is \"Show alerts from my contacts\" for Messages in iOS Notification Center supposed to work? I've started using 2-factor authentication with a bunch of services. So, after I sign in, I get an authorisation code SMS'd to me. Now, if my phone is locked, I really don't want code appearing on the lock screen, but I generally like showing the SMS preview.\nI noticed in Notification Center -> Messages, there is a choice:\nShow Alerts from Everyone\nShow Alerts from My Contacts\nNow, I assumed that if I chose, \"Show Alerts from My Contacts\", but kept \"Preview\" on, if the SMS sender wasn't in my address book, I wouldn't see the Alert, and certainly not the Preview on my lock screen. However, I can't find any discernible difference between these two settings.\nEvery SMS I get from numbers NOT in my address book, I see the banner if the phone is unlocked, and I see the Preview if it is locked, and I see the Preview on the Lock Screen in the Notifications pulldown.\nWhat gives? Am I misunderstanding the functionality of this setting?\nIt's an iPhone 5S, running 7.1 (11D167)\n\nA: There's 2 different things here which are not pretty clear.\nFirst of all, there's SMS and iMessage.\nAnd like explained on this blog you can restrict iMessages from giving a notification if you decide you want contacts only (since iOS6). This does not work for SMS.\nWith iOS the name of Show iMessage alerts from changed, but the functionality remained the same.\n", "Q: What is raid-ac protocol on port 2012 Yesterday I made OS X Server, on Mac Mini, for Xcode Continuous Integration.\nToday, by scanning my local network, I see that this Mac Mini is having port 2012 open with this raid-ac.   \nI googled but can not find any info regarding this raid-ac.\nI suppose that this raid-ac is used for this Xcode Continuous Integration feature.\nCan somebody provide more info about it ?\n\nA: As far I know RAID, it's a way to store data across multiple disks (HDD) acting like one.\nThere are multiple standard levels of them as explained on this Wiki (might be geeky as you say).\nBased on that knowledge I would say the services works with redundancy in order to run smoothly. As you say yourself: Continuous Integration (as in, without interruption)\n\nPlease check source below: \n\nUDP port 2012 uses the Datagram Protocol [red. that's what UDP means], a communications protocol\n  for the Internet network layer, transport layer, and session layer.\n  This protocol when used over PORT 2012 makes possible the transmission\n  of a datagram message from one computer to an application running in\n  another computer. Like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP is\n  used with IP (the Internet Protocol) but unlike TCP on Port 2012, UDP\n  Port 2012 is connectionless and does not guarantee reliable\n  communication; it’s up to the application that received the message on\n  Port 2012 to process any errors and verify correct delivery.\n  source\n\n", "Q: Benefits of updating apps If you update your app, does it get bumped to the top of the free apps section? Does it help improve visibility?\n\nA: Only new downloads will count, redownloading or downloading an update does not. And the top is based on number of downloads per time-unit.\nUpdating your app, on the other hand will (probably) keep users satisfied with new features and layout. If they spread the word, or advertise in any way about your application you will get more downloads. But that's not what you initiately asked.\n\nA: Top apps are based on download count and positive review based. While updating your previous app you cant make it in top rated. Updating an app will fix previous issues or adding additional features. \n\nA: Early on in the App store, updating your app would cause it to show up in the 'New' section. This is why every Friday there would be a slew of app updates as developers tried to keep their apps more visible.\nApple has since changed the store behavior so that this doesn't happen anymore.\n", "Q: Claims by mobile operator of iOS7 'secretly' using mobile data Apologies in advance for the likely TL;DR.\nI have an iPhone 5 running iOS7 on a PAYG deal with Vodafone in the UK. Whenever I top up £10, I get a 500mb data pack that's valid for 30 days. Thing is, I don't need to top up very often (as an example: I last topped up on March 4th, and I still have £6 of credit left), so my mobile data pack will frequently expire before I need to top up. \nAs of February this year, I started getting messages from Vodafone at random times saying \"We noticed you've started using mobile data, so we've charged you £1 for 25mb of data\". The problem is that every single time I've had this message, it's after I've come back home and been using WiFi for a good long while.\nThe first time I complained about this, the rep I spoke to said \"Oh, the system miscalculates it all the time, I'll  refund your money. You can always turn off mobile data and it won't happen again.\"\nI duly did this, and the second time it happened I complained again, and the rep I spoke to said \"It doesn't matter if you turn mobile data off; your phone uses it anyway in secret to do updates.\"\nThis has happened three times subsequently, and twice I've been told the same thing: even if I have mobile data turned off, my phone will turn it back on all by itself to check for updates, then turn it back off - and it's that microscopic data use that I'm getting charged for. \nThis sounds like utter horseradish to me, but is there any truth to this? I've gotten into the habit of turning off Mobile Data and Use 3G when I'm out unless I need to use it; in addition Data Roaming is always off, Background App Refresh is off, and Limit Ad Tracking is on. Am I missing something?\n\nA: A majority of the time the issue is with a random app or service running in the background.  Less often it's because the carrier has to update their software on the device.  In both cases, turning off cellular data would solve this issue.\nOccasionally there is a problem with the phone itself. Go to Settings>Cellular and note how much cellular data is being used.  Then turn off Cellular Data.  After two or three hours check if cellular data usage has changed.  If it has, restore the iPhone, and if necessary replace it if you have the option.\nIf there is no change in the cellular data usage I would contact your carrier and let them know.\n", "Q: Can I transfer game progress for Clash of Clans between GameCenter accounts I downloaded clash of clans on my sisters apple account.

I've just updated to Mavericks, and while I like having the dock on my 2 Landscape displays, my third portrait display is entirely unsuited to having a dock on it.\nHow can I suppress the dock from appearing on one of my 3 displays?\n\nA: I can't find any way to allow the dock on 2 of the 3 displays.\nBut, there are some things you might do.\nIn Mavericks, the default is that each monitor has its own Space, an Apple way of saying that each monitor is its own independent desktop.\nThe implications of that are that your menu bar will be on all monitors but \"disabled\" on the monitors that you are not currently focused in. It also means that the dock will automatically change to the monitor that you are focused in.\nYou can change this setting so that the monitors are one Space, or one desktop. In \"System Preferences\" > \"Mission Control\", deselect the box for \"Displays have separate Spaces\".\nNow, your menu bar and dock will only appear on one screen and will not move automatically.\nTo change which monitor is your primary monitor, go to \"System Preferences\" > \"Displays\". On the monitor that is your current primary monitor, a tab on the top of the window will say \"Arrangement\". There will see the side-by-side layout of all the monitors.

Information on how to do that is located also in the provided article.\n\nA: Here are your Options.\nWe assume your Boot sector is somehow damaged.\nWe further assume your hard drive is not damaged.\nSince you installed Mountain Lion you might be in luck.\nWhen you install Mountain Lion or Lion, the installer creates an invisible, bootable, 650MB partition—a portion of a drive the operating system treats as a separate volume—on your startup drive called Recovery HD that includes a few essential utilities for fixing problems, restoring files, browsing the Web, and even reinstalling the operating system. \nThe installation is not always given factor so it might not work for your system.\nEasy to find out by Restart while holding the CMD - R.\nIf you have a Recovery on you drive it will come in to action, then follow the steps.\nOption 2:\nIf you do not have the Recovery installed or your disk is damaged, the Try with Target disk mode.\nFor that you will need a second Mac.\nIf you have access to a working Mac, and both it and the non-working Mac have FireWire or Thunderbolt ports, boot the non-working Mac in target disk mode by holding down the key combination command-T at the startup chime. \nConnect the two Macs with a FireWire or Thunderbolt cable. \nThe internal drive of the machine running in target mode will mount as an external drive on the other machine. Copy the data to another drive.\nOthers:\nHere are all Start up keyboard combinations you can try.\n", "Q: Two Bluetooth devices + MacBook Pro + 2.4gHz WiFi = no network throughput; why? My wife has two MacBook Pros.  One is old; the other is new as of a week or two ago.\nWe have a combination of three Bluetooth devices: two keyboards (one Apple; one Logitech) and a magic mouse.\nWe have a Comcast-supplied barely polished turd of a combination 2.4gHz 802.11n WiFi gateway/router (standard XFinity fare).\nThe problem: any combination of two or more Bluetooth devices paired to either machine causes network throughput to drop to effectively zero.\nThis is true regardless of WiFi channel and is always reproducible.\nThis is not a pairing issue—that is, it's not the case that the keyboard is actually paired with some other machine; we've tested this with only one machine powered up at a time.\nThis is not a machine per se issue; the old MacBook Pro is from circa 2010; the new one is from 2014.\nThis is not an OS issue; both MacBook Pros are running fully updated versions of Mavericks.\nOur iMac from late 2013 has two Bluetooth devices paired with it just fine.  It is closer to the router in case that has any bearing.\nWireless Diagnostics shows an \"Excellent\" signal-to-noise ratio throughout on all machines in our household.\nAny tips or pointers?  I've read the threads on generic Bluetooth interference, but this seems very specific to that second device being switched on, and very specific to something that two MacBook Pros from different years must share in common.\n\nA: I had the same issue. Did a bunch of troubleshooting with Apple over the phone and in store. The final diagnosis was a logic board and wireless card replacement.\nWhen they took it in to repair it, the tech noticed only one of the three antennas were connected to the motherboard. His theory is that the one antenna was enough to support a connection or two but became overloaded in certain situations, very easily. After reconnecting them all has been working well.\nSo my suggestion to you is to either open it up yourself or bring it to Apple and see if that may be the issue.\n", "Q: How can Find My iPhone be working with no data plan? We have an iPhone4 and replaced it with a iPhone5s. In the process of setting up iCloud we registered both of these devices. Now that the phone number has been transferred to the new iPhone 5s, the old iPhone4 only has WiFi and no cell data plan. However, on Find my iPhone in iCloud it still shows the iPhone4 has been updated a minute ago and the location is correct as it is sitting in our house.\nIs the GPS in the iPhone4 sending data of it's location via WiFi?\n\nA: Yes, the device can communicate with Find my iPhone over Wi-Fi. Find my iPhone uses the currently available network connection, regardless of whether that be Wi-Fi or cellular. The GPS is still used to obtain location information along with Wi-Fi data and the location is sent over Wi-Fi to Find my iPhone.\n", "Q: Syntax highlighting in emails? I'd like Mail to pick up on syntax\nI'm copying mostly from an app that does highlight syntax, but it doesn't seem to apply any sort of \"formatting\" to the text itself on pasting (e.g. color, font, size, etc.)\nFor code, I mostly send MySQL queries in emails\n\nA: Though I was really looking for a way to copy from say TextMate into an email and preserve highlighting...\nSince there are no answers, I found this answer as a decent workaround somewhere so I thought I'd share:\nHead to an online syntax highlighting tool like tohtml.com and then copy and paste the text into your email\nFairly quick and easy to use :)\n", "Q: networksetup -disconnectpppoeservice not working I love doing stuff on terminal, a lot.

When that process is completed, it is my understanding that I will have two partitions.  The 256gb SSD that was installed, and a 128gb SSD left over from the fusion drive.  Can I RAID0 these together in a relatively reliable fashion? I understand the pitfalls of RAID0, and how if one drive fails they both go, but that is what Time Machine is for.  Has any had any experience with setting up this type of RAID on an iMac?\n\nA: Generally speaking I BELIEVE that RAID requires drives of equal size. In some cases when you get drives of unequal size the RAID uses the size of the smallest drive, so in your case you would end up with a 256GB (128 + half the 256) RAID-0 Drive.\nHOWEVER I have not done such a thing on Apple hardware using disk utility, it MIGHT give you a RAID of 256 + 128 GB, but I kinda doubt it.\nBut in any case creation of the RAID erases the data on both drives so if you are OK with that, try setting it up and let us know the results.\n", "Q: Why does my MBP Retina Mid 2012 show Intel HD 4000 when it came with an Nvidia GT 650M?

My iPhone's screen decided to die on me, so the screen is black, and I got a Samsung to replace it. The problem is that I can't get anything off of my phone. I did back up to my iCloud but how I am going to get all of my photos that I saved on iCloud?\n\nA: As this is tagged photo-stream I presume that you 'backed up' to Photo Stream. You can recover the photos from your Photo Stream by opening the Photo Stream on your computer.\n~/Library/Application Support/iLifeAssetManagement/assets/sub\n\nInside this folder are all the photos from your Photo Stream. Copy them to your new phone.\n", "Q: How to access husband's iCloud account? I have been using my husband's Apple ID for my iCloud account. Now I have noticed that my iCloud backup is off and I need to turn it on.\nI need to access my account since my husband already changed the password for his Apple ID and he wont tell the new password.\nWhat can I do? Every time I try to turn on iCloud backup it asks for the password to my husband's account? I need to update and download some apps.\n\nA: *\n\n*Plug your phone into iTunes to get a backup\n\n*Get your husband to either remove your phone from his iCloud find my phone by logging into iCloud.com ( or he can type the password to allow you to remove his iCloud from your phone or he can tell you the password and the. Change it a third time)\n\n\nUntil you have find my phone turned off with his permission, your iPhone won't let you use it with another Apple ID - this is activation lock and designed to make stolen phones less valuable to theft. \n", "Q: How to tell if an iPhone is hacked and how to prevent it? A friend of mine said he thinks his iPhone has been hacked. How do you find out if it has been and more importantly how do you stop it? \nHe called me up because his girlfriend says things during fights that he mentioned in text messages. He said she let it slip she ‘remoted’ in to his phone.\nI think I know one way this could have happened. If she backed up his phone to her Macbook then iMessage on her computer might be receiving his messages. But that would only work if she has a Mac unless there is an iMessage for Windows.\n\nA: I don't really know why people always think their device is being hacked after something weird is happening in their eyes.\nIf she made a backup on a computer, and someone put that version back - they have access to the complete iPhone after restoring it on another device. Can this be the case?\nIf not, he said things during fights on iMessage? Maybe he just said it and regret it afterwards claiming he didn't send it. I don't see why anyone would add extra text to a fight and not use it for something else (if they really have bad intentions.)\nBacking up an iPhone to a Mac does not turn on iMessage by default unless the user activates this him/herself. It is impossible to get active just because of a backup.\nSolution\nChange the Apple ID password and all default Apple services will become useless because it will prompt for the new password.\n", "Q: Outlook 2011, where are located messages placed in \"On my computer\"? I'm using Outlook 2011 under OS X Mavericks.\nI moved some messages to my Exchange account to folders located in the section \"On my computer\".\nI need to know where these messages are physically located on my computer.\n\nA: You should check out your personal folder (user) and navigate to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Documents\n\n*Microsoft User Data \n\n*Office 2011 Identies\n\n*Main Identity\n\n\nPlease note that Outlook 2011 does not use a .PST file format\n", "Q: Downloading unofficial applications with developer ID signature Recently I have download a suite application from a torrent. The application installation was the \"official\" application installer plus a configuration file that was replaced the official configuration file in the application to make it work.\nWhen I was installed the application installer, the Mac OS X didn't blocked it as a not identifier developer, so I suppose that this installation process is not something like a virus?\nMy question If I download an application not from the official website, and the OS X find it as an identifier developer, there is no chance that this application is affected by virus?\n\nA: I doubt if we support installing such (cracked) software, but I can at least give you the facts as I'm not explaining how to download or modify it to crack it.\nIf you're talking about an .app which is originally downloaded from the Mac AppStore in this case, I can explain you the following details:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apps like this have their own sandbox (this is the same on iOS) and they cannot perform any action outside it. (Without a jailbreak for example on iOS or installer on OS X) - this counts for all apps in the App Stores since 2012.\n\n*If the .plist file or some relevant information in the View Package Contents is edited, so the sandbox thinks you're the original owner - you can run it.\n\n\nThe application cannot get out of the sandbox as explained, thus cannot ruin your Mac - unless you have to give it administrator privileges by a prompt.\n", "Q: MBP 2010 external monitor not waking Up until recently my MacBook Pro 2010 worked fine with an external samsung monitor, using a mini display to HDMI cable. At the time I was running Mountain Lion. Then a few months ago, still running mountain lion, the monitor started not waking up with the mac. The only solution now is to unplug the monitor and plug it back in. I have to do this 2 or 3 times now before it will work. Also, now it no longer works in target display mode: if i close the lid of the mac with an external keyboard and mouse, everything sleeps. Then when I open the lid, the monitor doesnt wake up. \nUnplugging and plugging in the cable cannot be doing it or the socket many favours. Also I am ending up leaving my mac on all the time so I dont have to go through this routine (set to never sleep). \nI dont see why, running the same OS, why this would just start happening. Perhaps Apple updated something that caused this problem?\nDoes any one have any ideas? this is highly annoying. I was thinking maybe a Mavericks upgrade might fix this issue, but then it might cause others. Ideally I don't want to do that. I have tried resetting the SMC and the NVRAM.\n\nA: Based on your reply, first to check is the cable or connector.\nSoftware does not randomly connect or disconnect and because you say it works after you plug-in and un-plug the cable a few times it works... the cable might be broken.\nIf you have a replacement, try it - else you could buy one (and return if it does not solve the problem). Based on your reply with VGA it works fine, I would definately buy a new cable/connector.\n", "Q: No wi-fi detected in Windows 7 in boot camp partition I've installed Windows 7 on a Boot Camp partition on a 2013 Macbook Air. However when booted into Windows 7 no wi-fi network can be detected. The Mac partition is fine. A Google search indicates this is a widespread problem but I can't seem to find a solution. Any help?\n\nA: Sorry about this but I've solved the issue. I went back to the external hard drive I had onto which Boot Camp had downloaded the Windows 7 drivers during the installation process. I had to manually activate the application found in Bootcamp/Drivers/Broadcom/BroadcomWirelessWin7x64. Hopefully this will be helpful to someone else.\n", "Q: Boot from CD, make backup, reinstall snow leopard. Good idea? My iMac has some problems, and to repair it I thought I'd do as it says in the title. Currently, I'm running (a broken) Snow Leopard, and ideally I'd make a backup (with Time Machine) before I erase the disk and reinstall Snow Leopard.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this possible? What happens when I boot from a CD? Do I just reach my desktop? If not, would I be able to make a backup (obviously without later restoring it, just some files one by one) from there?\n\n*Can I do this with the CD with Snow Leopard coming in a Mac Box Set? (I couldn't find the apple store page for the Mac Box Set anymore, just the system requirements.)\n\n*I never did something like this before. All thoughts welcome.\n\n\nA: Booting from an install media such as a Snow Leopard install DVD will not boot to your desktop. Instead, it will boot to the OS installed on the disc and whilst this is OS X, there's no Finder for you to move files around.\nHowever, the disc does come with Terminal and you can use it to copy your files to somewhere else, another disk, etc. There are numerous tools that you can use in Terminal to copy files, but for individual files/folders as mentioned in your question you can simply cd /path/to/original /path/to/location to copy them.\nThen, using the disc, reinstall Snow Leopard and copy your files back once booted back (using the now-available Finder).\n", "Q: Is it possible to hide files from Terminal's ls? I am saving some files because I need to reinstall OS X, and noticed oddly high numbers of files in some folders. Is it possible for malware to hide files from ls?\n\nA: Hidden files are hidden from ls unless you use the -a or -A flag:\n-A   List all entries except for . and ...  Always set for the super-user.\n-a   Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (.).\n\nSource: ls man page\nTherefore, files can be hidden by starting the filename with a . but ls will still show the file if it is run with -a or -A.\nNote that not all files that are hidden with a . are malware-related. The system creates many files like this for a variety of reasons in various places on the disk that can cause problems if removed or modified.\n\nA: ls is not a command that opens the directory file itself and show it's contents. It uses dirent (Directory Entries) from the C library which is used by a lot of software like stat but also bash's parameter expansion.\nSo the real question is then: Is it possible for malware to hide files from BSD/Darwin? No, you can't hide files from it's own system because it will turn into waste (read:free to overwrite) very soon. \n", "Q: Add someone to contacts through Game Center? Is there a way to add the friends I have added to Game Center to my contacts app?

A new update in Clash of Clans has been arrived and it is asking me the password through which I downloaded this game but I don't know the password. How can I update it with my new Apple ID?\n\nA: App updates must be done with the Apple ID that was used to originally download the app. If you wish to use another Apple ID with an app you need to delete the app and download it again from the App Store using the new Apple ID.\n", "Q: Assign the launchPad hotkey to another Application I'd like to set the launchPad key :\n\nto the Application windows (See all) function but I can't manage to do it. Any clue ?\n\nA: This isn't an ideal answer, but might be good enough:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard\n\n*Check \"Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys\"\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts\n\n*Set F3 to \"display application windows\"\n\n*Set the other functions on the f-keys to their default (e.g. whichever f-key your keyboard has for play/pause, mine is F8 will be set to iTunes Play/Pause)\n\n\nThis will let you set the F keys to the functions you want and you won't have to press fn to access them.\n", "Q: Where is the temp file created by Disk Utility during erasure of free space kept on a non-boot volume? I used Disk Utility to perform a secure erase of free space on an external non-boot drive, and ran into a problem and the process was aborted.\nI see that the file is still there because the drive capacity has taken a big hit. So I need to know where the temporary file Disk Utility writes to is.\n\nA: Whilst I don't know where its stored, it is at least able to be removed by running Repair Disk in Disk Utility freeing the space for a subsequent free space erase.\n", "Q: Graphical man pages viewer in Terminal.app There is a feature in terminal to view man-page of selected string in external window with ⌃⌘? shortcut. \nBut it has a priority to display preinstalled man pages. So for example I've installed gnu coreutils with homebrew and have edited man-pages search path. And if I do man ls in console I get man-page from gnu coreutils but help menu action gives me bsd man-page. \nIs it possible to fix man-pages search path for it?\n\nA: Instead of that you can use Dash. It is an application for having and reading different programming languages docsets offline. It also has the ability to read the man pages available on your system.\n", "Q: Outlook for Mac SMTP failing on Google Apps I have recently set up a client on Google Apps for Business.

Why? My iPad 3 is set to use English as the main language for everything in the settings (International and Keyboard settings).\nWhen I download an app, it's very often in the Russian language (when there's a translation available). And I don't know why. I don't even understand their alphabet so the apps are very unusable. \nI already checked my AppStore account - but it's in Czech (that's where I live), which has got a classic alphabet.\nSorry about my English, I'm not a native speaker. \n\nA: I just had the same problem and I solved it. My iPhone apps were very often in German but my iPhone was in Swedish. The problem is: I believe that your iPad's secondary language is set to Russian (Apps display in the first language they find on your list for which they have a localization included). So I believe that if you change your secondary language you should have apps in your desired language. To change secondary language, go to Settings > General > International > Language and choose whatever language you want (presumably English in your case) as secondary language. Then, when the language is set, switch back to your original language and you shall be all set.\n", "Q: Changed user name but files are now unaccessible I changed the home user name using http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1428 and now search in Mail and Finder only show me files I've accessed since the change. This is a major issue for me. \nHow can I fix this OR revert back safely? \nI use Time Machine but my attempt to restore to the time before I made the change did not work.\n\nA: Make sure that all the permissions are correct on your home folder.\nYou can use the ACL tool on the Recovery HD to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into the Recovery HD using ⌘R.\n\n*Run resetpassword in Terminal (available from Utilities → Terminal).\n\n*Select your account from the drop-down list.\n\n*Click the Reset button for Reset Home Directory Permissions and ACLs.\n\n\nA: Go to Macintosh HD< Users< you should find your account name here < desktop< right click get info< give your self permission  then apply this permission to all encloused items> \n", "Q: Correcting Pronunciation Errors in 'Say' Command in Terminal I'm having difficulty correcting the pronunciation in the 'say' command, using 10.9.\nI tried to add new pronunciations through:\nSystem Preferences > Dictation and Speech > Open Accessibility Preferences > Open VoiceOver Utility > Speech > Pronunciation > +\nAfter I added a new entry I tried it in both Terminal and TextEdit and neither pronounced it correctly:\n$ say -v \"Samantha\" -f filename.txt -o audiofile.aiff\n\nAlthough it did not work in TextEdit (Edit > Speech > Start Speaking), I want to be able to accomplish this in Terminal.\nDoes anyone have any idea of how I can go about doing this?\n\nA: According to this 2007 thread at discussions.apple.com the VoiceOver utility only fixes pronunciations in VoiceOver itself, not in text-to-speech.\nSo if you want to get say to correctly pronounce the words you should run a find and replace on the text file for each mis-pronounced word.

Mostly, it just works.\nHowever, when I start up Mail it never shows the Archive folder. The Archive button will move mail to it, but it's not there. The Goto mailbox menu item is greyed out for Archive in the Mailbox menu too. (cmd-2)\nI can right-click on another folder, all of which show up, and choose \"Get Account Info\" then it scans all the folders, shows Archive which I double-click to open, and use that window, closing the original Mail window. All works fine and dandy. It's an annoying little dance I don't want to have to do.\nWorth noting that once I've done the dance, then the cmd-2 short-cut works and the menu item above works fine.\nIn FastMail the Archive folder is configured to be displayed. It's set to Always Show.\nThis is on 10.9.2.\nUsing another mail client (Airmail, or Postbox) I didn't see this problem, but I like Mail.\n\nA: I just had this problem on OS 10.10 (Yosemite). Here's how I solved it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the inbox.\n\n*Right-click \"Account Info\"\n\n*Select \"Messages on Server\" tab.\n\n*Wait until the size of all of your mailboxes is calculated.\n\n*Select the Archive mailbox and click \"Show Messages\" button.\n\n\nThe archive now appears in the mailboxes bar.\n\nA: It appears that this is linked to Spotlight in some way.\nI recently turned spotlight indexing back on for the volume holding my $HOME and immediately this started working again.\nI assume that without the spotlight index it can't find the Archive directly automatically, then finds it via IMAP when I run through the steps in the question.\n\nA: Once you have done the steps described above then ...\n\n\n*\n\n*View - show the Mailbox List, \n\n*View - show the Favorites Bar, \n\n*Click and hold the Archive Mailbox in the Mailbox List and drag it to the Favorites Bar.  \n\n\nOnce you have done that the Archive Mailbox will always display in both the Mailbox List and the Favorites Bar.\n\nA: I'm not sure that this is an ideal solution for everyone, but I noticed that you can create a Smart Folder that links to an Exchange Archive with the following rule:\nMessage is in mailbox: Archive -> Exchange\nWhen you create a new Smart Folder and select the \"Message is in mailbox:\" rule, it will show you a list of mailboxes in a drop-down menu which includes the Archive mailboxes linked to the accounts you have setup. The Archive option should appear as the last entry in the top section of the drop-down list, and if you then hover over the Archive entry, you should get another popup menu that will show your Exchange archive folder (it may be named something other than \"Exchange\" if you have given your Exchange account a different label in your Mail Account settings).\nOnce you have setup the new Smart Folder you should be able to see your archived Exchange messages within it.

I want to try reinstalling the OS to see if the problem will disappear.\nAbout reinstalling the OS, my biggest concert is if all my files will remain after reinstallation. So, can you reinstall OS X without having to format your hard drive?\nMy mac came with Mavericks.\n\nA: Just to clarify :-) Simply reinstalling an O/S (upgrading too) does not delete any personal files, it over writes only system files to a freshly installed state.\nremember that the FIRST thing you do after re-installing is running software update and getting all the patches.\nThe SECOND would be booting from the recovery partition and repairing permissions and the disk with Disk Utility (in that order)\n\nA: Backup your files first before installing the OS\nNote: if you are upgarding from ex: mountain lion to mavericks you will not lose files.\n", "Q: Can't login after setting up FileVault I ran FileVault on my MacBook Pro.

There are a couple answers to this problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*TRIM - which is out because Apple has seen fit to disable it on non-Apple drives. I don't care to argue whether Apple did this out of greed or over-cautious technical concerns.  I'm not wild about hacking a kext to allow code that wasn't tested against my drive model to stand between my data and non-volatile storage.\n\n*Drive-based Garbage Collection (GC) - some drives are quite good at this given adequate over-provisioned scratch space.\nHow can I set the over-provisioning on a drive?  Is it as simple as partitioning the disk and leaving a portion of the disk unallocated? Is a specific partition table type required?\nSolutions ranging from Disk Utility to fdisk are acceptable.\nI can also be convinced that it's not necessary, but I'm still interested in the technical \"how-to\" of allocating extra over-provisioned space.\n\nA: As a followup, I updated my 2011 MacBook Pro (not my Mac Pro) using an aftermarket SSD in December of 2014.\nDrive Selection\nBalancing budget vs performance vs reputation, I chose a Crucial M500 480GB — not a known high-performer, but with a decent reputation for reliability.  I’m not sure the power loss protection capacitors are needed in a laptop, but I liked having them.  It has on-drive garbage collection and TRIM support.  The drive internally has 32GB of over-provisioning.  \nDrive Installation\nI installed the drive as a direct replacement to the internal spinning disk.\nI did NOT allocate any additional over-provisioning using partitions.\nI did NOT install any TRIM-enabling hacks.\nDrive Usage\nThe machine is used primarily for OS X/iOS development so there’s a large amount of churn on the disk of varying sized files as compiled object files, podcasts, training videos, etc are downloaded or created, used and deleted.  Disk space usage ranges between 25-50%.\nThe difference in performance against the stock 7200RPM 750GB was pretty striking.  I have misplaced my measurements so I can’t be precise in the comparison.  “Striking” will have to do.\nPerformance\nAfter 6 months of churning, performance still looks very good.\nTests using Blackmagic Disk Speed Test show a nearly identical read performance (-0.8%) and a very small decrease in write performance (-2.4%).  Some of this could be partially attributed to variability that comes with real-world testing, but I'm pleased that I've experienced only negligible performance impact due to the inability to turn TRIM on for the drive.\nCurrently, I'm seeing 470MB/s read and 393MB/s write performance and using 26% of the drive.\nWe’ll see how it holds up over the coming months.\nAddendum:\nAs of OS X 10.10.4, Apple seems to have rendered this point moot.  Yay!\nhttp://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/06/latest-os-x-update-allows-you-to-enable-trim-for-third-party-ssds/\nAddendum 2:\nSome drives are known to have TRIM bugs which may have serious implications.  This includes:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Micron_M500*\"\n\n*\"Crucial_CTM500\"\n\n*\"Micron_M5[15]0*\"\n\n*\"Crucial_CTM550\"\n\n*\"Crucial_CTMX100\"\n\n*\"Samsung SSD 8*\"\n\n*Sandforce drives such as OWC Electra\n\n\nI personally am holding off on enabling until I can confirm firmware updates will address the vulnerability.\nAddendum 3:\nI found this little jewel for folks that still haven't enabled TRIM and are seeing performance issues on the Crucial drives.\n\nIf TRIM is present it will handle this background cleanup, but if for any reason TRIM can't reach the SSD, Active Garbage Collection is there to take care of the drive.\n[...], you may simply need to force Active Garbage Collection to run on the drive by powering the SSD on and leaving it idle for 6 to 8 hours. After that, your drive’s functionality and performance should be restored.\nFollow these steps to trigger Active Garbage Collection on your Crucial SSD:\n[PC instructions]\nOn a Mac, press the Options key while powering on to enter the Startup Manager screen. Leaving the Mac on that screen provides the SSD with power but keeps it in an idle state so Garbage Collection can function, just like the BIOS screen on a Windows laptop.\n\nCrucial Forums: My SSD used to be so much faster...\nFurthermore, if you disable \"Put the hard disk(s) to sleep when possible\", the drives will have an opportunity to do Active Garbage Collection during idle periods.\nAddendum 4:\nA wonderfully educational article on arstechnica answers the original question of how to over-provision an SSD on OSX.\n\nIt's also possible to emulate the beneficial effects of over-provisioning by simply using less than the stated capacity of an SSD—for example, by purchasing a 90GB SSD, creating a 30GB partition, and leaving the rest unallocated. The controller itself doesn't care about the logical constructs built by the operating system—it will happily continue to write to new fresh pages as long as they're available.\n\nSolid State Revolution\n\nA: Dedicating available space to the SSD's controller for wear-leveling works by just leaving those blocks marked unused. Normally the operating won't write to blocks that aren't part of a partition, so just leaving some space unpartitioned or allocated to a partition marked as reserved should do the trick. If the drive has been used before, a TRIM command must be run on the affected blocks once to declare them free. However, you don't have to modify a kernel extension to enable TRIM on any third-party drive. Simply running sudo trimforce enable from a terminal will do. That way you always have the full capacity of your drive available while keeping all the free space available to controller to work with.\n", "Q: How to allow port 80? (NAT) I want to allow traffic to flow from the Internet to my Raspberry Pi, the IP address of the Pi needs to look as though it is from the router (NAT).\nThe ports that need to be allowed through are port 80 (http) and port 22 (ssh).\nWhere can I find these NAT settings? How do I allow ports?\n\nA: the article currently titled \"AirPort Utility 6.x: Set NAT options for your base station or AirPort Time Capsule\" and currently available at http://support.apple.com/kb/PH5103 has:\n\nTo set NAT options, your base station or AirPort Time Capsule must be set up to share its Internet connection using DHCP and NAT.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open AirPort Utility, located in the Utilities folder in the Applications folder. Select the base station you want to set up, then click Edit. Enter the password if necessary.\n\n*Click Network and then choose DHCP and NAT from the Router Mode pop-up menu.\n\n*Select Enable NAT Port Mapping Protocol.\nNAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP) is an Internet Engineering Task Force Internet Draft, an alternative to the more common\nUniversal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol implemented in many NAT routers. NAT-PMP allows a computer in a private network (behind a NAT router) to automatically configure the router to allow clients outside the private network to contact this computer.\nIncluded in the protocol is a method for retrieving the public IP address of a NAT gateway, which allows a client to make this public IP address and port number known to peers that may wish to communicate with it. This protocol is implemented in current Apple products, including Mac OS X 10.4 or later, AirPort Extreme and AirPort Express networking products, AirPort Time Capsule, and Bonjour for Windows.\n\n*Select “Enable default host,” and enter the IP address of the host.\nA default host is a computer on your network that is exposed to the Internet and receives all inbound traffic. A default host may be useful if you use a computer on your AirPort network to play network games, or want to route all Internet traffic through a single computer.\nYou can also set up port mapping to direct network traffic to a specific computer on your network.\n\nthe article currently titled \"AirPort Utility software and firmware downloads\" and currently available at http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1998 tells you where to get Airport Utility.\n", "Q: Google Chrome vs my Keychain Since I've left Chrome as my main browser, every time I use it as secondary browser, Chrome enters in an eternal loop requesting my password to access each keychain bundle of my system.

Right now I am just editing my database url every time I restart the VM. Does anyone have a complete set of instructions on how to configure an internal NAT static IP in VMWare Fusion 5.0?\n\nA: You'll have to manually edit VMware's network preferences and add static hosts to get this working. The file necessary can be found at /Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/vmnet8/dhcpd.conf. The file is read-only so chmod it writeable first.\nFor each static host you'll have to add the following and change the hostname, MAC address and IP to your VMs:\nhost yourhosthere {\n    hardware ethernet 11:22:33:44:55:66;\n    fixed-address 192.168.87.100;\n}\n\nI'd recommend selecting the IP from outside the DHCP range, which is defined in the same file on the row starting with range.\nAfter this you have to restart VMware services with sudo \"/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/boot.sh\" --restart\nAs for the DNS name, after you have a static IP you can add it to your /etc/hosts file using the following syntax:\n192.168.87.100 yourhosthere\n\n", "Q: Hits ram ceiling on boot I just restarted my Late 2011 Macbook Pro. 3.58Gb-3.71Gb / 4.00GB are being use right out the gate.

Someone had the good idea of what is the purpose of RAM that is not used.\nSo use it all or as much as you can and manage the dynamics so it does not overun to Swap.\nWhat it means it will continuously optimize the RAM usage while prioritizing the accessibility the speed to which applications open.\nIt uses a feature called Compressed memory to gain RAM space.\nThe measure of its success is not to have swap (if possible), which is using the hard disk as RAM, that slows it down.\nIn your case there is no swap or compression so the slow down you are experiencing is not your RAM. \nAlso looking at your memory pressure it is in normal levels.\nYou have 8 Google windows open totaling in 250 MB of RAM (that is also normal), but that could lead to slow down opening all of them at once.\nTo find out what is slowing it down you need to look in the console and publish some lines here at the time stamp of opening a application that takes long time to load.\nAs for kernel, it is normal for it to use up to 500 MB of RAM for all its jobs it has to do.\n", "Q: Apple ID and Primary Email Address - providing that I change my primary email, will my purchases be kept? as from the title, providing that I change my primary email, will my purchases be kept?

Then I would try an SMC reset. Mavericks and Mountain Lion can be pretty finicky and even strange when new hardware is installed. I've had to reset the SMC on my system with Mavericks 3 times since I started using Mavericks. In my case, it's Mavericks, not the hardware. It's buggy.\nThe I/O error typically is either a bad drive or cable, so you probably did have a real hardware problem at some point. I'd be inclined to recommend Scannerz (http://scsc-online.com/Scannerz.html) to test it, but you need a working system to use it, and if you can't even get yours to boot, that obviously won't help.\nDoes the Mac Mini even have a SATA cable to the HD, or is it a connector that sits on the logic board with the HD plugging directly into it?\n\nA: I have Scannerz and it's an impressive tool, but like the other guy posted, I don't know if it would do you much good if your system won't boot.\nSATA cables can go bad and often do, but unfortunately you can also have connector problems and even cracked logic board traces that will also produce I/O errors. The OS can't distinguish between an I/O error created by a bad block or sector and that caused by cables, connectors, or cracked traces. Scannerz comes with a tool called Phoenix in the package that can extract the OS on a volume to an external drive or USB flash and then use it to diagnose a problem, but once again, in order to have an e-boot volume like that you first need to make it from a working system. I think their assumption is that you'll use their Phoenix tool to start a test regiment before problems develop. People really should do tests on drives once in a while, unless you really like getting stuck without warning.\nWhat I would do instead is put the SSD into an inexpensive USB enclosure and try to install the OS onto that. If all is good, it should work. If it doesn't work then you've got other problems. I say to put the SSD into the enclosure because it's brand new and it should be good. If it works you could try the same with the HD and see if there are problems. I suspect the SSD is either OK or you have really, really bad luck, which is unlikely.\nAssuming the unit will boot off an external drive, how you want to proceed is up to you. If your Mac Mini is like mine the cable isn't much but it's there. You could try testing of some sort with the external as a boot drive and the internal as the test drive. I wouldn't be surprised if the problem is the cable if your unit has one, but if it's the connector or a logic board trace on the logic board, you probably need to get used to the idea of using an external drive.\nAn external SSD, even though it's bottlenecked by the data rates of USB or Firewire ports will still be faster than a regular HD, but it won't be as quick as one using a SATA port. They're lighting quick!\n", "Q: Wifi doesn't work: interface not powered Since yesterday I don't see any wifi network after turning it on:\n\nThat's the error I get from the console.\n\nDoes it mean it is a hardware problem?\nIt's a Mavericks install (10.9.2), build 13C64 in a MBP 15-inch, Mid 2012.\n\nA: Interestingly it does show Connected but the WiFi settings are wrong and the Network settings are wrong?\nAnyway, lets bypass the GUI and use Terminal for some direct commands.\nIn Terminal type (to turn it on)\nnetworksetup -setairportpower en0 on\n\nNext type (to scan)\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport scan\n\nFinally type (to connect)\nnetworksetup -setairportnetwork en0 WIFI_SSID_I_WANT_TO_JOIN WIFI_PASSWORD\n\n", "Q: How to change credit card data for Apple ID?

I've already asked this question on ServerFault, but I'm beginning to think that this might be an issue more with my OSX client machine than our SMB server.\nI'm using 10.9, but this problem happened when I was on 10.8 as well. When I first connect to our SMB share (hosted by some recent-ish windows server, not linux or osx server), the Finder seems to lock up for a good 30 seconds while it fetches the root folder of the share. Navigating the share is extremely slow at first as well - it takes about 30 seconds to open each folder.

I can not move the blue tip (see image below)\n\nHow can the tip to the left be moved? Right now it is 'blocked'.\n\nA: Note the 'DOCUMENT' icon at the far right of the very top of the document. Click on the Document Icon ... You will see a formatting screen similar to the 'older' inspector. The margin details are below \"Document Body\"\nYou need to select text in the body and then change the Document left margin from 2.69 inches to 1 inch.\nAlso, you might need to remove the left items. Depending on how thorough you want to be, update the body style to match the new definition, but at that point once the left margin is something more sane like 1\" - you can fix your indents if desired by dragging the tab stops in the ruler.\n\n", "Q: Copy between 10.9 host and guest in Parallels I have been using Parallels 9 no problem for quite a while for .Net development in Windows. I have recently changed over to working on OS X applications, and as such, I am using Xamarin.Mac.\nAs a part of our dev cycle, we have to test. In doing this, I spun up a Mavericks VM, and installed Parallels Tools, updates and created a \"Clean Slate\" snapshot.\nThe only problem is I can't get files to and from the VM at all.\nThe first method I tried was the usual old ⌘ + c and ⌘ + p options to no avail, getting the following response;\n\nIn addition to this, I mounted my local home directory (enabled by default) and tried to copy the item over. I could browse the directory fine, but on copy, I got the following information;\n\nIs there some sort of incompatibility with copying between an OSX host and its OSX guest?\n\nA: you have to update your parallels tools, to do so as i remember you have to select Window install parallels tools, then follow the on screen instructions\n", "Q: App download on mac?

Anyone knows what information does Apple gather?\n\nA: From the \"Security and Privacy\" preference pane in System Preferences (In Mac OS x Mavericks):\n\n\nYou can help Apple improve its products and user support by having your Mac automatically send Apple information from time to time about how it's working and how you use it.  This information is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you.  Click on the question mark for more information on the types of data sent.

I never use more than one \"desktop\", however once every few days, I see a random number of new desktops created - usually between 2-3 but sometimes there are as many as 7-10.\nThe desktops do not remove themselves so some days I end up having more than 12 spare desktops.\nThere is no wallpaper or icons on my desktop.\nWhat causes the new desktops to be created spontaneously?\n\nA: I have the same issue and I'm looking for a solution. However, I think I know the cause...\nWhen you unplug a monitor the OS creates a new Desktop for the lost screen and moves all the windows onto your laptop screen. When you plug back in it thinks you want that extra Desktop so it doesn't re-use it for the monitor, then when you unplug again it creates a new one. For people who rarely use the Desktops / Spaces feature (or mission control) these extra desktops can build up and you only notice them on the rare occasions you go into mission control. I sometimes find 20 or more Desktops there.\nI'm not sure if this is exactly correct, or how to solve it, but I think this is what causes multiple Desktops to keep appearing.\n", "Q: Apple Mail is not retrieving mail automatically from Exchange I have an Exchange account set up in Apple Mail. When I click the \"Get new messages\" button it successfully retrieves mail from the Exchange server.\nI have the \"Check for new messages\" setting in Mail to \"Automatically\" but it is not retrieving them automatically, I have to manually click the \"Get new messages\" button again to get the messages.\nI have also tried setting \"Check for new messages\" to \"Every minute\" but this does not work either.\nInitially restarting Mail seems to fix this, but the problem seems to re-occur every time I wake up my computer from sleep/hibernation. I don't want to have to restart Mail every time I do this.\nIs there a known fix for this behaviour?\n\nA: After changing the Check for New Messages delivery settings you need to restart the Mail for it to take an effect.\n\nA: If your Mac is running 10.9.x, Apple has posted a Knowledge Base article about this issue. There's no fix, but Apple has a manual workaround included in the Kbase article:\n\nResolution\nQuitting and reopening Mail forces it to re-establish a connection to the email server. You can use these steps to receive new mail messages without quitting Mail:\nChoose Mailbox > Take All Accounts Offline.\nChoose Mailbox > Get All New Mail.\nAs a shortcut, you can also add the Take All Accounts Offline and Get Mail buttons to your Mail toolbar.\nChoose View > Customize Toolbar.\nDrag the Take All Accounts Offline button to the Toolbar if it is not there already.\nDrag the Get Mail button to the Toolbar if it is not there already.\nClick Done\nTo receive new mail messages, click the Take Offline button, then click the Check Mail button.\n\nOS X: New email messages not received until Mail is quit and reopened\n\nA: I've seen similar issues with Outlook on Windows.

For example, if messages appear to be missing or garbled, or if you can’t find all relevant messages when you search using Entire Message.\nSelect a mailbox, then choose Mailbox > Rebuild.\nWhen you rebuild mailboxes for IMAP and Exchange accounts, locally stored messages and attachments are discarded, and the messages and attachments are downloaded again from the server to your Mac. Your mailbox appears empty until the download is complete.\nLast Modified: Nov 6, 2013.\n\nA: I have two IMAP accounts and after opening Mail, it would take minutes to have new mail come in.

I do have to re-download a few apps, and Xcode happened to be one of the first.\nI completed the configuration and it started the actual installing . It said 'estimated time: 1 hour' but when I checked after twenty minutes it was almost ready, though it had stopped. I was greeted with this:\n\nOK, an informative error message. Just close iTunes and complete the installation, right? Wrong, iTunes wasn't running. (I do know the difference between closing a window and quitting an app.) So I tried opening and quitting iTunes, but that didn't work either. Then I had a look at the Activity Monitor, but I couldn't find a process from iTunes. What do I do now? Even the buttons to cancel the installation are greyed out, so I don't even know how to retry the installation.\nPS: Clicking on the find symbol next to iTunes in the alert screen just starts iTunes.\nUpdate\nI found a process called 'iTunes Helper'. I assume that's what's causing the alert. Is it safe to just kill this process?\nAnd I found this: http://osxdaily.com/2011/08/02/cant-install-xcode-because-itunes-fix/! That fixes it, restarting the computer will relaunch iTunesHelper. That should have fixed it, according to the linked article, but sadly, I still have the alert opened, the installation doesn't progress.\n\nA: OK, I solved it. So I first found this article, which said to killall iTunesHelper. That didn't work. After that I found an Apple discussions thread on this where someone had to killall AlertAll (the process responsible for the Install Alert). I did that and the installation finished succesfully.\nStep-by-step\n\n*\n\n*Go through the installation and get this alert\n\n*Open Terminal and execute killall iTunesHelper (or kill it with Activity Monitor)\n\n*Execute killall AlertAll if the installation still doesn't proceed (Caution: after this the installer assumes iTunes is completely stopped. If it's not, things can of course go wrong. So better look over your processes list twice before doing this.)\n\n*Everything should be fine\n\nThis was exactly what I did, if it doesn't work for you: I'm sorry, but then your issue is different and you should ask a new question.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to switch between applications in Mission Control Does Apple have keyboard shortcuts to switch between applications in Mission Control?

If you only use the keyboard, don't activate Mission Control, instead use command + tab to switch between apps.\n\nA: CMD+tab allows you to switch between applications\nIn mission control Control+arrow key allows you to switch between spaces\nHere is a great link for all mac shortcuts http://www.danrodney.com/mac/\n\nA: I think alt-tab does what you want (and is open source).\nThe shortcut is alt-tab.\n", "Q: Is the X-mailer number assigned to a specific iPad? On the iPad is there going to be the same X-mailer number assigned to it, or does it change when emails are sent?\nBasically, is the X-mailer number assigned to a specific iPad?\n\nA: The X-Mailer header is used to identify the client application that is sending the message.\nIf there is a number in this header it should be the version number of the client mail application.  It is not unique to your iPad, all emails sent from the same device model with the same version of the Mail app will have the same number.\n", "Q: 'which openssl' returns nothing when trying to upgrade OpenSSL I've been working the last day or so to get openssl upgraded on my machine.

Inactive memory won't slow things down (I haven't stress-tested it myself, but it makes sense to me). Inactive memory is second only to free memory with malloc, etc.\nInactive memory is just used for keeping things around so it won't have to load them from disk again. If you open, say, Terminal for the first time in a while (or after a reboot), you'll notice it takes a couple seconds to get a prompt. Quit and reopen it (or just make a new shell window) and it's almost instantaneous.\nThat said, running sudo purge all the time won't break anything. I would recommend setting up an alias/function in your .bash_profile as you don't want to mistype anything prefixed with sudo. (The results could be disastrous, and I mean it).\nBut with 24 GB of memory, there is no reason to run it.\n", "Q: iBooks version / iPad I wish to buy an iPad to have some digital interactive books. The requirements for the books are: \"To view this book, you must have an iPad with iBooks 3 or later and iOS 5.1 or later\".\nI don't wish to buy a new iPad (low on cash), and wish to buy a second hand one, as I'll be using the iPad only for using those digital books.\nI know nothing about iPads and their different versions. What would be the minimal iPad generation (normal size or mini) I should buy?\n\nA: Every iPad including the original can run iOS 5.1 so it doesn't matter which iPad you purchase. The original iPad can be updated to iOS 5.1.1 and at the time of writing all other iPads (including all iPad minis) are still able to be updated to the latest version of iOS (7.1).\niBooks 3 requires iOS 5.1 so is able to be run on all devices that can run iOS 5.1 (therefore all iPads). However, iBooks 3 uses more system resources and the first generation barely handles it with numerous complaints of crashing simply because the first generation iPad doesn't have the resources available.\nIdeally you probably want to buy the most recent iPad you can which will give you the ability to update in the future.\n", "Q: Assigning applications to multiple desktops (Spaces) across multiple monitors I have a setup with two monitors.  Is there a way that I can assign an application to one space on monitor 1 and another space on monitor 2?  I currently have it set up so that each monitor has its own set of spaces and would like to keep it that way.  \nI use eclipse in a setup where I display the editor on one monitor and everything else (console, navigator, etc.) on the other.  Whenever I change perspectives, restart eclipse, or unplug the second monitor, the windows all move onto one screen.  \n\nA: I know that the 3rd party application TotalSpaces2 has the ability to assign program's to specific spaces of Mission Control. Also, I know that you can use separate spaces for separate monitors in Mission Control.\nSo, check out the trial of TotalSpaces2 (for Mavericks) or TotalSpaces (for Mountain Lion) at http://totalspaces.binaryage.com/multi-monitors2\n(I don't have a commercial interest in TotalSpaces2, I just started trying the program myself)\n", "Q: Recovering files deleted via sudo I deleted some files via sudo rm -rf ~/.Trash/* - unfortunately I accidentally moved a folder from the Desktop into there and can't seem to recover it.\nI only use this command now and then, when I need to; but how can I recover these files? I know it's a powerful command, but I cocked up this one, but at least I didn't delete system files... only a few personal JPG and PDF files.\nI tried two data recovery utilities but it didn't seem to find the folder or its contents... why?\nI have one backup of the folder with some of the contents on stored on an external HD, but that's not as up-to-date; the file was deleted 11 Apr 2014 - that's today.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: Please stop writing to your hard drive this instant. That means turning it off if your system is running from said hard drive. The more you write on the HD, the more likely you are to write over the data you want to recover. And a running OS is writing on the HD.\nOnce you’ve done that, I can’t think of any reason why there would be any difference between files you’ve erased by emptying the Trash and files you’ve rmed1. \nSo the best solution you have is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from another disk.\n\n*Run a recovery utility such as Data Rescue.\n\n\n\n1. By the way, why rm the Trash?\n", "Q: How to open a file in Excel from the command line Is it possible to tell Excel to open a file from the command line?\nIn Linux, I could do this using the command\nlibreoffice --calc test.xlsx\n\n\nA: You can use the open command:\nThis will use the default application for the file type, which may not be the desired application.\nopen test.xlsx\n\nor, to specify the application explicitly:\nopen test.xlsx -a /Applications/Microsoft\\ Office\\ 2011/Microsoft\\ Excel.app/\n\nor even,\nopen test.xlsx -a \"Microsoft Excel\"\n\nA really useful way of doing this is to make an alias to Excel (in your .bash_profile)\nalias xl='open -a \"Microsoft Excel\"'\n\nThen you can just type the following to open an file in Excel:\nxl file.csv\n\n\nA: To open the excel file from the directory, this is the command you should use \nlibreoffice --calc /Path/Of/The/Directory/Excel.xlsx\n\nTo open new excel file use\nlibreoffice --calc\n\n", "Q: Will Safari 7.0 run on OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard? I really like the new Safari in OS X 10.9, but otherwise don't like much else and want to downgrade back to 10.6 -- the last time I was happy using my computer. \nBut, can I take the new Safari with me?\n\nA: No: Snow Leopard runs Safari 5.1.10 at the newest (via and also).\nI recommend using Chrome or Firefox if you downgrade back to Snow Leopard. There are messages that Chrome and Firefox no longer support Leopard, but both seem to still support Snow Leopard. \n\nA: You cannot run the official Apple version of Safari 7.0 (nor 6.0) unfortunately, as confirmed by a WebKit Developer Experience Manager at Apple. \nHowever, you can run the Safari 7+ Webkit version equivalent with QupZilla\nIt doesn't have all the Apple Safari features, but share many of them, including an updated web inspector for development/testing purpose while remaining in Snow Leopard.\nFor legacy details, note however than QupZilla is and will be running on QtWebKit (which is a slightly different port than Apple's when is come to rendering despite sharing the same WebCore) only up to 1.x versions.\n\"Qupzilla 2.0 will be using QtWebEngine only\". Meaning that QupZilla 2.x will later be essentially Chromium/Blink based.\n", "Q: Run the Single User mode with rEFIt installed I recently installed rEFIt boot for a small linux partition. I then tried to boot up into single user mode by hitting {COMMAND + S}, but rEFIts own terminal came up. \nIs there any way to still get into single user mode while rEFIt boot is installed?\n\nA: Figured it out, have to press F2 when I am in the rEFIt menu, and then select Single USER mode\n", "Q: CentOS will not install on my Mac I am trying to install CentOS on another partition, and It will install, but every time, I get a GRUB HARD DISK ERROR.\nHere are the steps I took:\n•Resized Mac OSX disk and gave 20 gigabytes of free space (way overkill)\n•Installed the net install on the a flash drive using unetbootin\n•Booted off flash drive using rEFIt\n•Selected HTTP installation, and plugged in the ethernet\n•Entered the server\n\nWeb site name mirror.centos.org\nCentOS directory/centos/5/os/i386\n\n•Selected \"Use Free space on Selected Drives\" and selected the HD drive\n•Selected the time zone and password\n•Unchecked all of the features, don't want desktop GNOME\n•Installation Completed, and Reboot\n•rEFIt started up- boot linux from /boot \n•Black Screen with GRUB HARD DISK ERROR\nAny suggestions for fixing this?\nThanks\n\nA: I have experience this before trying to install backtrack Linux on windows.

Today when I opened the macbook it shows no charge symbol(I mean when you press power button it shows a battery icon in a black screen like iPhone does when its battery is drained). \nI connected the charger but there is no led light(green or amber). It is not detecting the charger . I checked the same charger in another macbook.The charger works perfectly. \nI tried doing SMC and PRAM reset. Since there is no power in the machine nothing happens. Please help.\nThe OS is Mavericks.\nI got the macbook in London and I am in India now. Will the Apple warranty work internationally?.\n\nA: Finally, I gave it to the Apple authorised repair centre. They told me IO chip and wire had to be replaced. Since it was in warranty it got it repaired for free.\n", "Q: Safari AutoFill/Preferences My question is: where does one find this option in the preferences for Safari Version 7.0.3 (9537.75.14)? I cannot find this option anywhere: not in Mac OS X System Preferences or in Safari’s own Preferences. I would love to be able to save the passwords for these sites, so that I don’t have to keep regenerating and re-remembering them. \n\n\nA: It's gone. Use this extension to work around it:\nhttp://ozymandias.me/2013/05/08/force-autocomplete-on-in-safari/\n\nA: I'm guessing it has been removed from Safari. According to this knowledge base article (under \"Safari isn't automatically filling in account names and passwords on some web sites.\") The checkbox should be in Preferences > Passwords. I don't see it there on my computer which has the exact same Safari Version with no Private Browsing. \n", "Q: Create network user with remote home folder I have Mac Server with OpenDirectory configured. Then I create some network users with home folder located on server. Due to the high bandwidth of user usage, I want to add another server that only host user home folders, so the traffic transferred between user and new server while authentication still via old server.\nIs this possible to do that? If not, is there any walk around that fix my issue?\n\nA: Yes this is possible. When prompted for the location of the home folder for the user you can choose any shared folder that you have configured to be used as storage for home folders in the File Sharing service. This folder can be anywhere on the machine or anywhere on the network.\n", "Q: You can't use Airport Utility without Airport Extreme? I want to use Airport Utility to settle wireless time limits, it seems that I can't use Airport Utility. Is it because you can use Airport Utility only with Apple hardware like \nAirport Extreme?\n\nA: Airport Utility is only for Apple's line of Airport wireless routers. This includes Airport Express, Airport Extreme, and Time Capsule. It does not support other routers.\n", "Q: Comma separated list to Columns / Mac Numbers I have a very huge list of Data (.txt file) .e.g.\n945874,stu2,3826,120558,74,15\n1836682,CHAOSTAURUS,90,978,3853,0\n1411981,KasiaLover,101,28285,684,5\n8270041,Daniel33de,3883,2389,2397,1\n..... etc\n\nwhere the variables are (in order):\n$id, $name, $all_id, $points, $rank, $t\n\nhow can I convert every comma separated variable to it's own Column?\nCan't find it.\n\nA: Rename the file extension to .csv then open the file with Numbers.\n\n", "Q: How do I connect a late 2013 MBP Retina to two DVI monitors? I thought this Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI adapter would allow me to connect two of these monitors to my Retina MBP.  Does \"Dual-Link\" mean that two monitors could be connected?  It had not occurred to me to question that before I bought the adapter.\n\nA: The Dual Link DVI adaptor is for connecting screens ~30\" – not for connect multiple screens.\nYou would need to connect one via the Thunderbolt port and one via the HDMI port.\n", "Q: MBA camera or iPhone camera for analysing tennis shots in slow motion? I want to practise tennis shots and see how I am doing. I want to use the MBA camera in my laptop or iPhone for this. How can I do it? Some apps for this purpose?\nPlease keep the focus on Apple products, photography-oriented answers here.\n\nA: The MBA build in cameras wont do high rate frames per second needed for your purpose.\nThey are a web camera type and the CCD/CMOS chip is not of a kind that can do that, regardless of the software.\niSight is a webcam, with video capture at 30 frames per second in 24-bit color.\nOn the iPhone there is a chance since it has an improved camera:\nThe iPhone 5s has a 120-frames-per-second slow-motion video mode and precision autofocus matrix metering. \nSport events would use 300 FPS on a professional level with high resolution.\n\nA: If you want to measure how fast you're serving you might want to get Tennis Camera. The app measures your serve speed in real time and reconstructs the 3D trajectory of your shot. An iPhone 5 or newer is required.\nDisclaimer: I'm one of the devs behind the app.\n\nA: Try ubersense app.  In my opinion you do not need the high speed video cameras to get 99% of the info you are after.  You can also use your iPhone from on top of the fence with a qm-1 from mytennistools.com\n", "Q: AppleScript To Manipulate VLC I want to do a script, that it can launch VLC player, and in VLC player \"Open a file\", then \n\"Select a folder\", then click on \"add\" then \"play\" it.

I distinctly remember that when I bought my first iPhone and iPad a couple of years back, I was able to install the CAcert root certificate on those devices and iOS would trust the certificate. These days, however, I can't get this to work anymore. Whenever I install the certificate, iOS always marks it as \"not trusted\". What is the reason for this? And even more importantly, how can I fix it?\nThe devices I am talking about are an iPad 2 (iOS 7), an iPhone 3GS (iOS 6) and an iPhone 4S (iOS 7).\n\nA: It turns out that iOS 5 and newer no longer trust certificates that are signed with the MD5 hash algorithm. This is confirmed by the official Apple support document http://support.apple.com/kb/TS4133.\nThe current CAcert root certificate is signed with MD5, so there is no fix for the problem until CAcert issues a new root certificate.\n", "Q: Importing a slow-mo video to Windows I recorded a slow-mo video using my iPhone 5s. How do I import that video to my Windows PC without losing the slow-mo effect?\nWhen uploading the video directly to Facebook from the iPhone (from the film roll), the slow-mo effect is preserved (thus, slow-mo effect is part of the video file itself).\nI've tried with \"Import pictures and videos\" which gets the video on the PC, but the imported video seems to lose the slow-mo effect both when playing it on the PC and after uploading the imported video to Facebook. \n\nA: The slow-motion effect applied to the video in Photos.app is not actually applied to the video file. This means that the 120 fps video remains at 120 fps and is played at this higher fps in Windows.\nTo slow down the video, use a video editor, either on Windows or on the iOS device (such as iMovie which is free on the 5s) to save the slowed video file.\n\nA: I asked myself the same question. It appears that the best and easiest solution is to buy the Slo-mo app for £0.69 which allows you to choose the slow effect location but then save it as a normal movie file. It can then be played as usual. Bit of the con this as we should be able to do this within the ios iself!\n\nA: I emailed it to my hotmail account (wouldn't go to my verizon account too big I guess and it's only 4 meg geeze) well went to my hotmail account and worked perfect slo mo and all. then I copied (dragged and dropped to my desktop Windows 7) plyed it from there still slo mo was just the way it was on my IPhone 6 plus.\n\nA: sending the clip to another apple device using airdrop worked for me\n\nA: VLC player is able to play video at 0.1x speed, which roughly corresponds to normal video frame rate.\nThe slo mo effect is not embedded in the video, because you can edit the start and the beginning of the effect in the device movie editor. My guess is it's kept in the AAE files stored somewhere obscure.\nQuickTime, however has the option \"Play All Frames\" under the \"View\" menu, which tells it not to drop frames, essentially, not trying to cram 240 frames into a second, but spread them out, which is very similar to the original.\n", "Q: Is there a way to make the terminal's font less blurry? I have been using a MacBook Pro for about a year or so, and I can definitely say that I am really satisfied from it. But there is one little thing that annoys me about it: the fonts in many text editors I use (including Komodo Edit 8, Brackets, MacVim, Vim, Github's Atom, etc) are very blurry. I use my laptop mainly for programming, and I spend many hours in front of the screen, so this blurring becomes very annoying for my eyes. Recently I downloaded Virtual Box, through which I run Ubuntu 10.04. Below there is a comparison of the Ubuntu's terminal and my macbook's terminal:\n\nI hope you can also see the difference... Could someone help me fix the fonts?\n\nA: You can also run\ndefaults write -g AppleFontSmoothing -int 1\n\nand quit and reopen applications to make OS X use a lighter text rendering style but keep LCD font smoothing enabled.\nOr run\ndefaults write com.apple.Terminal AppleFontSmoothing -int 1\n\nand quit and reopen Terminal to change the setting only in Terminal.\n1 corresponds to the \"Light\" setting that was included in System Preferences in 10.5 and earlier. 2 corresponds to enabling LCD font smoothing and 0 corresponds to disabling LCD font smoothing.\n\nTerminal and iTerm 2 also have options to disable antialiasing completely. I currently use 17 point Menlo without antialiasing in iTerm 2:\n\n\nA: This is font anti-aliasing. In Terminal.app go to Preferences..., Settings and select a profile or create your own that fits your needs. There you can disable anti-aliasing (except for the Basic profile). Select it and click Default on the bottom of the list.\n\nA: You can lighten the antialiasing system-wide in System Preferences. Go to General and at the bottom is a checkbox labeled \"Use LCD font smoothing when available\". This is pretty cool in theory, but Apple's implementation is... not so great. LCD font smoothing  (also called subpixel rendering) treats the R, G, and B channels of each pixel as separate pixels, so you get something that looks even smoother. However, on a Mac it just doesn't work very well and you end up with the super-thick font.\nHere's an animation of the two different antialiasing styles.\n\nSo all you need to do is uncheck the LCD font smoothing box and restart Terminal. (If you log out and back in or reboot, it should make the font better for the full UI.)\nTo off subpixel rendering for a specific application, use\ndefaults write com.apple.Terminal AppleFontSmoothing -int 0\n\nchanging com.apple.Terminal to the bundle ID. Change the 0 to a 1 to turn it on again.\nTo turn off subpixel rendering only for MacVim use:\ndefaults write org.vim.MacVim AppleFontSmoothing -int 0\n\n\nA: When using iterm2, there is an option to use thin strokes for anti-aliased text. \nGo to your Profile settings (Profiles -> Open Profiles.. -> Edit Profiles ..) and select the Text tab. In the text rendering section, change the option Use thing strokes for anti-aliased text to Always, et voila!\n\nWorks best with highest anti-aliasing setting, without blurry or boldy font.\ndefaults write -g AppleFontSmoothing -int 2\n", "Q: Date and time settings disabled My date and time has suddenly become  1 jam 2013\nIn date and time preferences the setting \"set date and time automatically\" is disabled by which I mean it's greyed out. It's ticked and set to 10.2.0.90\nHow can I reenable this setting to change the date?\nMacBook Pro with Mavericks\n\nA: Generally speaking you must be an administrator to change this setting. If you are using a non-admin account you can click on the lock at the bottom of the pref window and enter any admin credentials to enable the setting.\n\n", "Q: VirtualBox/Vagrant Fully Remove Virtual Machine to Clear Hash Sum Mismatches, etc I'm running Mavericks, and using Vagrant with VirtualBox to spin up a Precise32 box. When I first started, I had issues with apt-get update on the box (hash sum mismatches, etc.); so after weeks of trying to fix it, I just reinstalled my OS and tried again--problem solved. Unfortunately, the problem has returned after several months; so I cannot use the box anymore.\nI have tried reinstalling Vagrant and tried deleting everything I could find that was associated with the box and re-adding the box; but nothing seems to work. I'm guessing that there has to be something that's being left over from the old box(es) (registry? I don't even know..), but I can't figure out what it is and how to remove it.\nThoughts? I just want to start with a totally fresh box without having to reinstall my OS.\nEdit 1: I'm still looking into this, but this may be resulting from an internet filter that I installed (k9)--see here.\n\nA: Mavericks has left me in tears, over a similar issue.\nI upgraded to Mavs using appstore and, it went fine for a couple of weeks.\nI think that the problem occured after I upgraded to the latest Virtualbox (I know nothing of Vagrant, Precise32, and I don't want to).\nThere came an occasion when I couldn't  VBoxManage - restart. It shut down the VM but, would not and cannot restart the VM.\nRight now, I'm trying to work out a way to brute force Mountain Lion to install over Mavericks. I'm completely out of other ideas, apart from to get a tattoo that reads, 'Don't upgrade, just because it's there - it will only cause you to cry in your beer'.\n\nA: I finally stumbled across this question/answer, which explains that having K9 Web Protection installed caused these issues; and I realized that it probably had some merit, since I had not installed K9 immediately after reinstalling my OS--hence the reason I had no issues for a while. So I believe the current workaround is to not run K9, which has its downsides, obviously. I installed OpenDNS on my router for home network filtering instead.\n", "Q: Reset SMC: Can I use \"SMCFlasher.efi -reset 1\"? I'm in a situation where I don't have working internal shift+ctrl+alt-keys and thusly unable to perform SMC-reset. \nRelated to others' issues with SMC-updates, there are instructions for re-flashing the firmware using rEFIt and utilities extracted from the official updater. One of the steps are:\nSmcFlasher.efi -reset 1\n\nWith the description \n\nFirst need to get the SMC into the right state.\n  \"SmcFlasher.efi -reset 1\".\n  Your MBP fans should now quiet down.\n\nSource\nThis is indicative of an SMC-reset.\nDoes anyone have experience with using this command? Does it in fact reset SMC, or is it a potentially destructive command?\n\nA: I can verify that this procedure does indeed reset SMC. It will give a warning-message, but this is unrelated. Fans, charging and everything else goes back to normal, as with a keyboard-triggered SMC-reset.\n", "Q: Why doesn't Macbook Pro continuously search for wifi like the iPhone does? Here's a scenario:\nI'm at home with my router turned off.\nNeither my Macbook Pro nor my iPhone are connected to the wifi (obviously), though both search for a wifi connection upon being turned on/woken up from sleep.\nLeaving both machines up and running, I turn on my router.\nAfter a short while, my iPhone automatically connects to the newly discovered wifi, which is on its list of saved/remembered connections.\nHowever, my Macbook never automatically connects to the wifi. If I click on the wifi button on the right of my menu bar I see \"Wi-Fi: Looking for Networks...\" and can then select my network from the list once the list updates. Alternatively, I can close my Macbook lid and when I reopen it (it wakes up from sleep) it will automatically connect to the wifi.\nSo my question is:\nWhy doesn't the Macbook continuously search for wifi like the iPhone does?\n\nEDIT:\nI cleared the log, closed my computer lid with the wifi off, opened my computer lid where it tried to auto-join a network but found none that it could join, then I turned on the wifi and manually connected.\nHere is the console log:\n2014-04-24 8:01:27.390 PM WindowServer[104]: device_generate_desktop_screenshot: authw 0x0(0), shield 0x7fd15cb8ad30(2001)\n2014-04-24 8:01:27.426 PM WindowServer[104]: device_generate_lock_screen_screenshot: authw 0x0(0), shield 0x7fd15cb8ad30(2001)\n2014-04-24 8:01:29.000 PM kernel[0]: AirPort_Brcm43xx::powerChange: System Sleep \n2014-04-24 8:01:31.000 PM kernel[0]: hibernate image path: /var/vm/sleepimage\n2014-04-24 8:01:31.000 PM kernel[0]: efi pagecount 43\n2014-04-24 8:01:31.000 PM kernel[0]: hibernate_page_list_setall(preflight 1) start 0xffffff81d6cd7000, 0xffffff81fb523000\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: hibernate_page_list_setall time: 427 ms\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: pages 1446947, wire 356846, act 322978, inact 12881, cleaned 0 spec 166, zf 2677, throt 0, compr 0, xpmapped 182497\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: could discard act 168161 inact 131668 purgeable 35397 spec 416173 cleaned 0\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: hibernate_page_list_setall preflight pageCount 695548 est comp 41 setfile 1256022036 min 8589934592\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x6c351e4000, 0x1000]\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x6d47b99000, 0x19000000]\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x6d9251e000, 0x32000000]\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x1a6307000, 0x19000000]\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x32ce62000, 0x32000000]\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x369bac1000, 0x19000000]\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x47b3194000, 0x19000000]\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x5ce4430000, 0x19000000]\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x5f2ff15000, 0x32000000]\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x62bd8a9000, 0x19000000]\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x62ffa62000, 0x19000000]\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x68abd8f000, 0x19000000]\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x6ace1cd000, 0x19000000]\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x6af7ffd000, 0x19000000]\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x6b33bd2000, 0x19000000]\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x69fa8b4000, 0x17b26000]\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x33247d7000, 0x15d1b000]\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x6d60b99000, 0x13c6c000]\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x47cc194000, 0x9b53000]\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x4ee000f000, 0xbfff000]\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x0, 0x0]\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: kern_open_file_for_direct_io(0) took 0 ms\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: Opened file /var/vm/sleepimage, size 8589934592, partition base 0x0, maxio 2000000 ssd 0\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: hibernate image major 1, minor 0, blocksize 4096, pollers 5\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: hibernate_alloc_pages act 526536, inact 147226, anon 3805, throt 0, spec 416339, wire 376612, wireinit 134660\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: hibernate_setup(0) took 0 ms\n2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: AppleThunderboltHAL::earlyWake -

If so, how much faster does it drain?\n(I'm using an iPad Air running on iOS 7.1)\n\nA: In general, dynamic wallpapers drain the battery faster than still wallpapers. The amount of drainage is dependent on the wallpaper itself (whether it has many bright colors, is graphic intensive) and how it's programmed (CPU and memory usage, etc.). There are ones that are better than others. Also, how often are you on your home screen where you see that wall paper? Obviously it will only affect you battery life if it is on the screen, so if you are using apps all the time you should see virtually no difference. I would suggest experimenting with your iPad's battery life with a dynamic wallpaper and without, and see how they vary with your usage. \n", "Q: Restoring iOS 7.1 to iOS 7.0.4 I'm trying to Downgrade my iPhone 5s from iOS 7.1 to iOS 7.0.4.\nI have been looking at tutorials, and found this one Downgrading iOS 7.1 with iTunes\nIt worked up until the last step.

The sizes of keys, the paddings between keys, no Num Lock, have Fn, no numbers' area... everything is equal to the Mac keyboards, including MacBook Pro, MacBook Air and Apple Wireless Keyboard (but not the USB one).\n---- Amendment #1 ----\nSorry for missing this important part. What I'm seeking are mechanical ones. I searched \"mechanical keyboard Mac layout\" and found the question mentioned above but failed in noticing that question was not only talking about mechanical keyboards.\n\nA: Honestly the only \"real\" choice I've come across that works the \"best\" is the *Matias mac specific keyboards\nI have experience using both the Matias Laptop Pro and the Das Keyboard 4  on mac and I think that there is a subtle reason why Matias is best.  I'm sure this also extends ot their other keyboards.  \nX & Command\nAs you can see here is the Bluetooth Apple keyboard layout - notice how the X and Command buttons are aligned\n\nOn the Das keyboard you can see that \"Alt\" (which you would map to command in \"mac\" mode) its not aligned very well to the X button\n\nAnd lastly we have the Laptop Pro where X is almost perfectly aligned with the command button \n\nSo What?\nSo why is does this matter?  A majority of the mac shortcuts involve the command key and I've noticed that having a shorter travel distance for the left thumb is better.  When I use the Das I find it more awkward to use mac because I'm always having to use Alt\nAnswer\nSo my answer is any of the Matias Mac keyboards are really your best bet.  If you don't' use keyboard shortcuts then this isnt' as much of an issue.\n\nA: I personally use two that do and have been please with both of them. I'll briefly describe each below:\nWASD CODE Mechanical Keyboard\nWASD makes many keyboards and can customize them to your specifications (layout, key color, mechanical switch type, mac/linux/windows, etc.). The CODE keyboard is especially nice and has a clean layout, white backlighting and neutral font (Helvetica). It's made with two types of switches (Cherry MX Clear and Cherry MX Green with rubber o-ring dampeners). I personally use the CODE 87-Key - Cherry MX Green (they also make a 104-Key version, if that's your style.) While the Greens require more force than most other keyboards, I've found it inconsequential, partially because of the dampeners.\nSince you mentioned having a Mac specific layout, the CODE keyboard has a DIP switch on the back of the keyboard that allows you to set the keys at the hard wear layout. Also note that the command (⌘) key is blank but can be replaced with a Mac specific version, if you so desire, and can easily be moved to the usual Mac layout—a key puller is included with the keyboard.\nThere are many other advantages to this keyboard, including n-key rollover, so definitely have a look at their website.\nRazer Blackwidow Ultimate\nI also have the 2013 Razer Blackwidow Ultimate (2014 version), which as far as I can tell is only sold on Razer's website. It uses Cherry MX Blue keyboard (great for typists) and has a very solid build to it—e.g., key backlighting, braided cables, usb, microphone, and audio ports, and a solid frame. However, while the hardware has so far been solid and I haven't had any problems with the keyboard itself, the included software (Razer Synapse v2.0, which manages macros and macro profiles) has proven quite buggy and as far as I'm concerned, worthless. Thankfully, you can forgo the software and simply use the keyboard as is.\nDas Keyboard\nI tried the mac version but was immediately put off by the glossy surface. Too each their own...\nMatias Quiet Pro\nI also tried out the Matias Quiet Pro. It has a great feel to it and is relatively quiet, if that's something you're interested in. While it is built well, I didn't like the plastic that formed the base:  it looks cheap to me. Additionally, the frame wasn't quite as solid as the WASD and Razer keyboards previously mentioned.\nRecommendation\nIf I had to buy again, I would not hesitate to buy one of WASD's keyboards. They're absolutely solid.\nAlternatives\nThere's a great site that has a large collection of mechanical keyboards you may peruse. Have a look at MechanicalKeyboards.com.\n\nA: If you want \"clicky\" mechanical keyswitches, you should look at the Matias Tactile Pro, for US$150. It is a modern version modeled on Apple's long-discontinued mechanical-keyswitch keyboard that was sold in the 1990s, the Apple Extended Keyboard, which was before the days of USB.\nThe keyboard layout of the current generation of MacBooks and MacBook Airs is probably not 100% identical to that of the Matias Tactile Pro, but I believe this is as close as you are going to get.\nNote that you can remap any functions of Function keys in Mac OS X in software, if anything doesn't match up to your liking.\n\nMatias also makes a Mini Tactile Pro that saves space by doing away with the numeric keypad.\n\nDas Keyboard Model S Professional for Mac, at US$133, is also highly rated, although the key layout in the numeric keypad and certain other keys is slightly different that what Apple uses today.\n\n\nA: I seriously doubt you'll find an 'exact' match for the Mac Keyboard w/mechanical keys and that has the same exact dimensions in terms of keyboard spacing.  Low height keys and mechanical switches might prove difficult to come by.\nI am seriously considering the DAS Keyboard Model S Professional for Mac.  It has quality mechanical switches (MX Blues, a touch-typist favorite), and Mac specific keys (OPT, CMD), as well as function keys notation for volume, brightness, media, etc, and includes a SLEEP shortcut key.\n\nA: Personally, I'm very happy with a Matias keyboard, though I'm not sure if they are what you are looking for, layout wise. \n\nA: I will continue update in this answer if I found more keybords:\n1. niz micro 84\nI'm using this keyboard, it has 4 keys in the left of space key(like macOS layout), and it comes with a software to program the keyboard, you can use the software to configure individual keys\n\nand there is a little trick here,\nthe software to program the keyboard can't set a key to \"macOS fn key\",and the two Fn key in this keyboard is not actually a \"macOS fn key\", we need to do a little more things:\n\n*\n\n*program the left Control key to right Control key\n\n*program the right Control key to a key you want\n\n*use KarabinerElements to map the \"right_control\" key to \"macOS fn key\"\n\nafter that, you got this keyboard.\n2. system76 launch\nthis looks exactly like what you want, but I haven't got one, so I can't tell you much detail about this one.\n\n", "Q: Open an application after wake from sleep Is is possible for an application to open up after waking up your MacBook?\nSo I have this application that I want it to open every time that I wake up my Macbook from  sleep.\n\nA: You can do this with SleepWatcher, an app that lets you…\n\nexecute a Unix command when the Mac or the display of the Mac … wakes up\n\nSuch a command to open an app could be:\nopen /Applications/Safari.app\n\n", "Q: iPhone 4s wifi problem My iPhone is no longer on I'm using it as an iPod for now but I cant connect to the wifi ; like the wifi is greyed out.

This indicates that the sticky bit is set for that directory. According to \"man 8 sticky\",\n\n A directory whose `sticky bit' is set becomes an append-only directory,\n or, more accurately, a directory in which the deletion of files is\n restricted.  A file in a sticky directory may only be removed or renamed\n by a user if the user has write permission for the directory and the user\n is the owner of the file, the owner of the directory, or the super-user.\n\n\nI suspect that when TextEdit tries to save a file, it first attempts to rename or remove the old file. But in a directory with the sticky bit set, only the owner can do this. Hence, the permission-based failure.\nYou could test this by trying something like this as user Guest\necho \" \" >> /Users/Shared/Links.txt\n\nIf this is successful, it shows that Guest can write to the file and that TextEdit must be renaming or removing, not just rewriting the file.\n", "Q: Recommended partition size MacBook Pro (Mavericks) for Windows 8.1, Windows database app?

For reference, my OS X version was Mountain Lion when I started solving the problem--and I needed to upgrade to Mavericks in the end.\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up Windows partition with WinClone to an external HDD\n\n*Run \"Backup now\" in Time Machine to make sure I have a latest backup of OS X partition\n\n*Under OS X Disk Utility, remove Windows system partition (which is typically labeled BOOTCAMP)\n\n*In OS X Recovery boot, remove OS X partition and create it from the scratch (make it use whole HDD space)\n\n*Install a clean OS X (my MBA 2011 allowed only Lion--if I remember correctly, it's fine as long as it's not a later release than my Time Machine backup)\n\n*Restore my OS X partition from Time Machine. It makes Recovery Partition disappear, we'll fix it in the next step\n\n*From AppStore, reinstall Mountain Lion. It's only needed to re-create the Recovery Partition.\n\n*Under OS X Disk Utility, manually create a FAT partition for Bootcamp following WinClone support article. WinClone will convert it into NTFS in the next step.\nThis is where you decide how HDD space will be split between OS X and Windows.\n\n*Restore Bootcamp partition from your backup (#1) to the Windows partition you created in #8.\n\n*Boot Windows under Bootcamp; it can run CHKDSK automatically, reporting that volume could be dirty--but didn't find any problems.\n\n*If you use Trackpad++, it needs to be reinstalled now. Boot Windows under Bootcamp, reinstall PowerPlan Assistant first, then Trackpad++.\n\n*Under OS X, re-create virtual machine in Parallels.\n\n*Upgrade to Mavericks.\n\n*Move to Bootcamp system partition all the data files that were originally stored on Windows data partition (provided you have their backup).\n\n\nThe only problem that's left at this point is that Parallels freezes VM when used in \"all apps in one window\" default mode (which is not Coherence, Fullscreen or Modality mode). Will seek solution for it later; at least it is stable for a week now in Coherence mode.\nBefore following the above sequence, I tried to recreate data partitition with Windows, converting the unallocated space that sized exactly like the lost partition. Failed: I found that there is a new partition which originally wasn't there: sized 620MB, but it didn't appear as recovery partition among Startup Disks on boot. Didn't try deleting it though, maybe it could help.\n", "Q: Any video tutorials for iWork 2013? I don't know if it is correct to call them iWork 2013...but is there any video tutorials for them?

The the + and - buttons to add or remove users are greyed out and it is not possible for me to edit something under this Service. And under the Server app it is not possible to add a Network user.\nWhat might be causing this problem?\n\nA: Follow the directions posted at: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT200018\nIn summary:\n1.

Everytime I launch an from the command line that requires X11 (like a gnuplot or octave plot) the terminal just hangs and nothing happens.\nHowever, I noticed that when I just disable the auto-launching of tmux by removing the line above so that I can open a new terminal window and launch XQuartz from there, I can also use the launched XQuartz from within tmux windows.\nThis however gets pretty tiresome.\nHow could I fix this?\n\nA: Try moving [[ $TERM != \"screen\" ]] && exec tmux to your .zshrc file. That way the command will only be run in interactive shells.\nAn interactive shell is simply any shell process that you use to type commands, and get back output from those commands. That is, a shell with which you interact.\n", "Q: How to automatically mount airport connected hard drive as read only for a user account I have an external hard drive connected to my airport extreme.

I have the new AirPort Extreme 802.11ac. I plugged in my 2TB Western Digital external hard drive into the AirPort Extreme USB port. I tried to find the mounted hard drive in my networks on Windows and the AirPort app on iPad and nothing comes up.\n\nA: Make sure the hard drive is formatted correctly and working properly. Do this by plugging it into your computer first. If you plug it into a PC because you don't have a Mac and it works, then it's probably formatted NTFS. This is bad because Airport Extreme can't read NTFS, and PC's can't format HFS+. You could reformat it as FAT32 but you will waste a lot of space depending on the size of your files. Your best option would be to find a friend with a Mac or just go to the Apple store and format your hard drive as HFS+.\nIn simple words, if a Mac can copy files to the drive, then it should work fine with the Airport Extreme. If the hard drive is formatted factory default and the box doesn't say \"Mac\" somewhere on it, then it probably will not work with the Airport Extreme without being formatted by a Mac.\n", "Q: Apps deleted from jailbroken iPad after battery died My iPad's battery recently completely died and when I plugged it in all the apps were gone.

For a while this displayed \"Open in Skim.app\" on my Mac (which is another PDF viewing app I have installed), and more recently it has changed to \"Open in Safari.app\". Regardless of whether it shows Skim.app or Safari.app, clicking on it opens the PDF in Preview, which is what I wanted it to do anyway, so this is not harmful to my workflow. Still, it bothers me that it shows the name of one app (and in the case of Safari.app, one that doesn't even make sense) while opening another.\nI tried logging on with the guest user on my computer to see if it is a problem with my user account. There, the context menu says \"Open in Safari\", without the .app suffix at the end. When clicking on that option, the PDF is opened in Preview.\nAlso, I still have access to my old computer, whose drive was wiped and the OS reinstalled.

No amount of health data, mail or messaging can account for this. I believe it has something to do with the feature in iOS 9 which allows documents and data from applications to be backed up to iCloud Drive outside of the iPhone backup menu.\nThis \"helpful\" feature to iOS appears to store the documents and data accumulated by an app not only in the iPhone's local storage but also in your iCloud quota even though it is not transparent that it is doing so.

In left panel \"Select Application\" click on \"+\" and select your IDE, then just configure your shortcuts for your IDE..\nOhh and you can have a problem to mapping F14-F15 keys, because in default OS X use it for monitor brightness.. So you have to go to the Mac Preference - keyboard - shortcut - monitor/display - uncheck f14 and f15 keys and enjoy!\nI'm using it also for my Magic Mouse configuration. For example middle click and other shortcuts and gestures that I was missing. It also supports window snapping and much more.

All bluetooth keyboards are however with US layout. Can I somehow change layout so buttons in corresponding places would act as these characters.\nIf yes, are there some restrictions for keys that I can replace? I would need two buttons to right from L-letter. Some keyboards have eg. keys \"-\" and \"=\" there but in some variants there are up arrow. \nIphone 4S with IOS 7.\n\nA: Bluetooth keyboards ARE available with the keys that you need.  For example Apple makes this one:\nhttp://store.apple.com/uk/product/MC184S/B/apple-wireless-keyboard\nbut I am sure there are others.\nYou have to also set the layout in iOS.  Tap on Finnish in the list of active keyboards and go to the Hardware part of the menu that appears and choose \"finnish\". \nIf for some reason you are only able to use a hardware keyboard with the US layout printed on the keys, then (after setting the Hardware layout in iOS to Finnnish) you should get ö from the ; button and ä from the ' button. \nIt's not possible for users to add new keyboard layouts to iOS yet.\nAnother solution might be to try using settings/general/keyboard/add new shortcut to make shortcuts you find convenient for the extra characters.\n", "Q: How can I add this line on Pages?

Is there any way to either group duplicates together or reorder them?\n\nA: I think you could just connect your iphone device to a desktop and, depending on your os, use a duplicate finder. These apps organize your photo collection pretty well.\n\nA: The best way to avoid duplicates is to select the images you want to create new folder  and import them to save PDF to ibook. Do this by selecting the image(s) you want, select the upload icon a select save PDF to ibook. You will have them in a separate folder from your photo app but at least you know you will have one folder without the duplicates.\n", "Q: PowerPoint presentations won't open on mac but I can see their preview on Finder.

I bought an iPhone 4 online around a year ago, maybe more, without knowing it was jailbroken (I should have sensed this by the price, indeed too good to be true).\nWhen I tried doing the upgrade everything got wiped out and I had to use RedSnow to restore the newest version at that moment. This was iOS 6.1.3 which was decent — I could use almost everything except making phone calls.\nNow a few apps are requiring me to download the newest version of iOS in order to operate properly. The next iOS version that appears suggested is 7.0.4. I have backed up all of my information on both the computer and cloud.\n\nA: *\n\n*Restore the device with iTunes (connect the device and click Restore in iTunes).  \n\n*Once the device is restored, set up the device using an iTunes backup and select the iTunes backup that you made before you restored the device.\n\n*If you want the device jailbroken, jailbreak the device using evasi0n 7.\n\n\nA: Since your iPhone is a jailbroken one, the upgrade needs to happen on the computer connected with iTunes. Firstl of all, backup all the info on the iPhone beforehand. Here are detailed steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iOS device to your computer using an USB cable.

The rules say the song cannot be more than 3:30. We have to provide copies of the song on a CD, a USB stick and an iPod/iPad/iPhone which means we cannot rely on realtime slow-down software on an iPhone alone to make the tempo adjustment.\nWe must record it and save it as a new file and then copy it to all the medium.\nI have a friend with a Mac who is willing to alter the file for us -- what does he need to do to change the tempo of the song so it fits in to the 3:30 run length requirement?\n\nA: Audacity has a change tempo effect you could try in the Effects menu. It might end up making it sound funny, so you will obviously want to listen to it once the effect is applied, but it doesn't simply play it back faster which would change the pitch (that is the change speed effect.)\nIf my math is right you will want to change it by +11.4% to get from 3:54 to 3:30.\n\nA: You can also use the atempo filter with ffmpeg:\nffmpeg -i input.mp3 -filter:a atempo=1.114 output.wav\n\n", "Q: TV lagging when watching regular TV channels while Apple TV is on One of my friends is setting up a TV for another friend, and noticed something very odd. I don't know the specifics of the TV, but we're talking a 2014 Samsung Smart TV that hasn't been cheap at all.\nFirst of all, I could've posted this somewhere else as it seems to be an HDMI problem but (and feel more than free to move if it I missed a more relevant stack exchange - I just wanted the information out there as Google revealed nothing);\n\n\n*\n\n*Signal Processing seemed to be more for the signals themselves, and while I think it might be the TV decrypting (I'm guessing that an HDMI signal to a picture is an expensive operation?) the signal in the background, I wasn't sure, so it didn't seem right.\n\n*Movies & TV seemed to be more about shows and such rather than the electrical specifications for a TV.\n\n*Electrical Engineering seemed to be more about Arduinos and machine programming rather than TV support.\n\n\nThe problem is super simple and easy to replicate. Turn on any HDMI device, then turn the TV on a channel that isn't HDMI, and the channels will lag and show digital distortion (even though you're not using the HDMI channel at all). Turn the HDMI device off or take the cable out, and they'll be back to normal.\nWhat could be the reason for this, and why does it only happen when the Apple TV (or possibly any other HDMI device) is on?\n\nA: Apparently (as thought) the solution had nothing to do with the Apple TV but rather the TV itself being horribly built. \nIn short, the reason is interference. If the HDMI cable and the TV cable were too close to each other the power/throughput from the HDMI cable would destroy the data coming through the TV cable. Yeah - what a genius build quality from Samsung.\nThe solution? Pick the HDMI port the furthest away from the TV cable and bend them in opposite directions and you're good to go. \"What if I have several HDMI devices\" you may ask? Your only solution seems to be to turn them off when you don't use them.\n", "Q: Downloads vs Update charts in new iTunes Connect Where can I see the new downloads vs update charts?

It has now 8 GB of RAM. I want to upgrade it to 16 GB. \nAny suggestion on how to do this are greatly appreciated.\n\nA: macsales.com aka OWC is a fantastic website for buying RAM. I purchased 16 gb for my late 2011 model with no problems. Order the RAM amount that you want, then when the ram arrives you must unscrew the back cover of your macbook and find the RAM to remove, which you will then replace with the RAM you bought. I highly suggest watching a YouTube video on the correct procedure to do this, as it is virtually impossible to describe the process in words. Search on YouTube: installing RAM MacBook Pro. Good luck! \n\nA: Instructions directly from the Apple Support Site (link):\n\nStep 1: Remove the bottom case\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Shut down your MacBook Pro. Disconnect the power adapter, Ethernet cable, USB cables, security lock, and any other cables connected to\n  the MacBook Pro to prevent damaging the computer.\n  \n*Turn over your MacBook Pro and remove the ten (10) screws that secure the bottom case. Because the screws are different lengths, note\n  the screw lengths and locations so you can replace the screws\n  correctly. Put them aside in a safe place. Lift off the case and place\n  it to the side.\n  \n*Touch a metal surface inside the computer to discharge any static electricity from your body.\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Remove existing memory (if present)\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Push the levers on the sides of the memory module in an outward direction to release the module from the memory card slot. The memory\n  pops up at an angle. Before removing it, make sure you find the\n  half-circle notches. If you don’t, try pressing the levers outward\n  again.\n  \n*Hold the memory module by its notches and remove it from the slot.\n  \n*Remove the other memory module.\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Install memory\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Align the notch on the gold edge of the module with the notch in the lower memory slot.\n  \n*Tilt the card and push the memory into the slot.\n  \n*Use two fingers with firm, even pressure to push down on the memory module. There should be a click when you insert the memory\n  correctly.\n  \n*Repeat this procedure to install an additional memory module in the top slot. Press down on the module to make sure it is level.\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Replace the bottom case Replace and tighten the ten screws you removed earlier, making sure to put the different length screws in\n  their proper locations.\n\nIf you prefer a more visual approach, this YouTube video (one of many I found) also shows how to perform the upgrade on a non-Retina MacBook Pro (mid-2012).\n", "Q: Script to check Software Version Hi i'm tryin to write a script to check software version.  I want to pass my own variables, which are name of the Application and Version.  \nHere's a copy.  It's not working for me currently... i'm a noob and i'm pretty sure it has to do with syntax.\nAny input is appreciated.\nThanks,\nPaul\n#/bin/sh\n\n#Enter the Name of the Application here\nApplicationName=/Applications/FakeApp.app\nApplicationVersionNumber=1.0\necho $ApplicationName\n\n#Check if Directory Exist\nif [ ! -d $ApplicationName ]; then\n            echo $ApplicationName \"is not installed\"\n            exit 123456\nfi\necho $ApplicationName \" is installed\"\n\n# Check Version\nVersionCheck=`cat $ApplicationName/version.plist | grep $ApplicationVersionNumber`\necho $VersionCheck\nif [ ${#VersionCheck} != 0 ]; then\necho $VersionCheck\necho $ApplicationName $ApplicationVersion Number \"is Installed\"\nexit 0\nfi\necho $ApplicationName $ApplicationVersion Number \"is NOT Installed\"\n\nexit 1\n\n\nA: There is really only one syntax mistake that you made. You put a space before Number in $ApplicationVersionNumber. Most apps don't have a version.plist file, but they always have the version in their Info.plist.\nHere is a fixed version of the script with a few improvements:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nApplicationName=/Applications/FakeApp.app\nApplicationVersionNumber=1.0\necho $ApplicationName\n\n#Check if Directory Exist\nif [ ! -d $ApplicationName ]; then\n    echo \"$ApplicationName is not installed\"\n    exit 123456\nfi\necho \"$ApplicationName is installed\"\n\n# Check Version\nVersionCheck=`plutil -p \"${ApplicationName}/Contents/Info.plist\" | grep \"CFBundleShortVersionString.*$ApplicationVersionNumber\"`\necho $VersionCheck\nif [ ${#VersionCheck} != 0 ]; then\n    echo \"$ApplicationName $ApplicationVersionNumber is Installed\"\n    exit 0\nfi\necho \"$ApplicationName $ApplicationVersionNumber is NOT Installed\"\nexit 1\n\n\n\n*\n\n*It uses plutil -p instead of cat, since plutil can print out a nice, readable version of the plist even if it isn't in XML form.\n\n*It greps for the key (CFBundleShortVersionString), .*, and then the value. This is better because you don't want it to trigger on things like LSMinimumSystemVersion.\n\n*I also added more quotes because I like quotes and things are (usually) less likely to break that way.\n\n\nI would have written it like this:\n#!/bin/bash\napp_path=\"$1\"\ndesired_version=\"$2\"\n\n#Get the line, regardless of whether it is correct\nversion_line=$(plutil -p \"${app_path}/Contents/Info.plist\" | grep \"CFBundleShortVersionString\")\nif [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then\n    version_line=$(plutil -p \"${app_path}/Contents/Info.plist\" | grep \"CFBundleVersion\")\n    if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then #if it failed again, the app is not installed at that path\n        echo \"$app_path not installed at all\"\n        exit 123456\n    fi\nfi\n#Some text editing to get the real version number\nreal_version=$(echo $version_line | grep -o '\"[[:digit:].]*\"' | sed 's/\"//g')\nif [ \"$real_version\" = \"$desired_version\" ]; then\n    echo \"$app_path $desired_version is installed\"\n    exit 0\nfi\necho \"${app_path}'s version is $real_version, not $desired_version\"\nexit 1\n\nThe advantage of this is it checks the actual version string, so if you put 1.3 and it's 1.3.1, it reports that it is a different version. $1 and $2 are the command-line arguments that are passed like ./script.sh '/Applications/FakeApp.app' '1.3'\nAlso, the other would count as correct on 1.1 for 121 because grep counts the . as a wildcard.\n\nA: You can also use AppleScript or defaults:\n$ osascript -e 'version of app \"TextEdit\"'\n1.9\n$ defaults read /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/Info.plist CFBundleShortVersionString\n1.9\n\nYou can use AppleScript or mdfind to find the path of an application:\n$ osascript -e 'posix path of (path to app \"textedit\")'\n/Applications/TextEdit.app/\n$ mdfind 'kMDItemContentType=com.apple.application-bundle&&kMDItemFSName=TextEdit.app'\n/Applications/TextEdit.app\n\n", "Q: Backup iPhone to external drive on Mac What is the best technique for changing the backup location of one's iPhone to an external drive. It would seem that with small SSD's (256GB) and very large iOS devices (128GB) that Apple would easily enable this. \nI found the below answer, but asking a non-techie friend to create a sym link is really not ideal.\nhttp://ismashphone.com/2012/05/how-to-change-the-location-of-your-iphone-backup.html\n\nIf you have any number of iOS devices, you likely back your stuff up\n  onto your computer. Perhaps iCloud, but after a certain point, you may\n  have so much stuff to back up that it’s best to just put it all on\n  your computer than it is to pay for the additional iCloud storage.\n  That’s especially the case if you have multiple iOS devices. You can\n  save a lot of space on your drive if you have lots of iOS apps, etc.\n  For instance, we were able to free up 100GB, no joke.\nOS X\n1) Make sure that iTunes is closed.\n2) You will now move your folder called ~/Library/Application\n  Support/MobileSync/Backup/ to the drive you want to back up to. For\n  instance, an external drive or secondary drive within your computer.\n  Whichever works for you.\n3) Launch Terminal Applications/Utilities/Terminal and type in the\n  following command line:\nln -s /Volumes/DriveName/Backup/ ~/Library/Application\\ Support/MobileSync/Backup\n\nIn the above example, ‘DriveName’ would be the name of the new backup\n  location.\n\n\nA: Ok I FINALLY got this to work!! The alias solution mentioned above actually really helped. I tweaked the process slightly and looked at other references to get this to work.  I'm using a WD My Cloud NAS drive to store iOS backups. Heres' what I did, step by step: \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new folder on the WD external drive and name it 'Backup'\n\n*Opened the Terminal app and typed in the following line: \n\n\nln -s /Volumes//Documents/Backup ~/Library/Application\\ Support/MobileSync/Backup\n*Be sure to use the name of your external hard drive where I've used the WD My Cloud drive.\nWhat this ended up doing was to create a brand new Alias folder of the 'Backup' folder that I created on the WD MY cloud drive (alias folders have the arrow on them meaning they point elsewhere. In my case to the WD drive). It created this new Alias folder within the original 'Backup' folder on my computer. This is the new folder that I want iTunes to back up my iOS devices to, as it sends all the data to my external hard drive without taking up space on my computer. A few more steps to get this finalized\n\n\n*Now since the Alias folder resides within the original 'Backup' folder on my computer, we need to remove it from there and bring it up one level to be at the same level as the original backup folder. Before moving it, we need to rename the original 'Backup' folder to something like 'Backup_Old'. \n\n*So this is what things look like now: Library > Application Support > MobileSync > Backup_Old > Backup (this is the Alias folder with the arrow).  Now all we have to do is move the 'Backup' folder up to the same level and we're good to go!\nTest it out by backing up your device through iTunes and you'll notice that the Alias folder on your computer takes up like 4kb while, the contents inside actually take up a whole lot more. Also to verify, check the folder on your external hard drive and it should be fairly large. \nI used this site to help with the terminal syntax part: http://support.digidna.net/hc/en-us/articles/203504123-Storing-your-iPhone-Backups-on-an-Alternate-Location\n\nA: Much easier yet to just make an alias to the desired folder, name it Backup and drag it into  ~/Library/Application\\ Support/MobileSync/\nTo clarify: There are two Library folders in Mac OS X. The correct one is /Users/[USERNAME]/Library/Application Support/MobileSync. It is not in /Library/Application Support/, which confusingly also exists (~ in the above answer stands for /Users/[USERNAME], which might not be obvious to some).\nI found a good how-to on symlinks here: https://gigaom.com/2011/04/27/how-to-create-and-use-symlinks-on-a-mac/\nI moved the iTunes Backup folder to Dropbox in Yosemite, no issues.\n\nA: The answer above worked very well.  There was one change in the Terminal command; the SymLink.  If you follow what is said below, this will now work.  I'm unsure if this is due to my computer being on OS X Mavericks...  In the original there was a Folder made in the Backup folder that was redundant and deeper than needed.  Now run the SymLink and you are good to go.  I now have an extra 64GB on my laptop, yeha!! \nOS X\n\n1) Make sure that iTunes is closed.\n\n2) You will now move your folder called ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/ to the drive you want to back up to. For instance, an external drive or secondary drive within your computer. Whichever works for you.\n\n3) Launch Terminal Applications/Utilities/Terminal and type in the following command line:\n\nln -s /Volumes/DriveName/Backup/ ~/Library/Application\\ Support/MobileSync\n\nIn the above example, ‘DriveName’ would be the name of the new backup location.\n\nI now have my computer backing up my iDevices to my Synology DS415+ NAS.   No loss of hard drive space on my laptops anymore.  \n\nA: I would do this by using Automator. Use the 'do shell script' action in Automator and input the ln command you detail above, and create a .app file. Then send that file to your friend and have them execute it, thus creating the symlink for them without having to have them load Terminal.\n", "Q: How to disable screen sharing I have some privacy concerns and would like to know how to disable screen sharing.

The camera has got some issues, and I wonder if I can go to a Japanese apple store with my problem or do I have to wait until I'm visiting Europe/Germany the next time? \n\nA: Absolutely go to an Apple retail store if one is convenient. Worst case, they can assist you in setting up service in the country of origin if that is needed, but in many cases, parts are universal should you need an actual hardware repair.\nBoth countries you mention also have web service, so you can set up service and possibly a repair without needing a trip to the store. \nTechnically, Apple could ask you to mail the product back to the country where you bought it, but my experience is that is reserved for rare circumstances and not the normal procedure. \n\nA: I believe the iPhone warranty is limited to the country of purchase.\nI was able to find this:\n\nIMPORTANT RESTRICTION FOR iPHONE AND iPAD SERVICE.\nApple may restrict warranty service for iPhone and iPad to the country\n  where Apple or its Authorized Distributors originally sold the Apple\n  Product.\n\nhttp://www.apple.com/legal/warranty/products/iphone-english-uk-africa.html\nAlso, once when I was at an Apple service center in India, I saw a big board they had put up which said \"iPhone support is provided only to locally purchased devices.\"\nBut I guess there is no harm in trying. These things are not always set in stone.\n", "Q: Is it possible to watch mp4s on an iPod Nano 6th Gen? I have tried to upload .mp4s to my iPod before, but all it would do is show a screenshot of the video and play the audio. Is there a way to actually watch the video and have the audio play as well?\n\nA: The 6th Generation iPod Nano does not support video decoding or playback1. \nHowever, it can demux video files and play any supported audio streams in those files2. Instead of the video stream, it displays a single keyframe. This is useful for music videos or podcasts, where you might still want to listen to the audio only, but it's not the same thing as full video playback.\nNote that the 5th- and 7th-gen both support video decoding and playback3; its omission from the 6th-gen seems to be an anomaly.\n\n1 Sources: everymac.com, apple.com, wikipedia.org.\n2 Source: ilounge.com.\n3 Sources: 5th-gen, 7th-gen. For those devices, handbrake is a great option, as per @iamkrillin's answer.\n\n\nA: a .Mp4 is not a video format per say, but rather a container.  The audio and video content are then encoded with different codecs and placed into the container.  What matters is the codec that it is encoded with.  Since the video is not playing but the audio is, I'd guess the video codec is not compatible..  \nI believe the only format that ios devices support is the H.264 codec.\nIn order to get your video to play, you will need to convert the video file into a format that the ipod can play.  There are many software packages available that can do this job for you.  Some are free, and some are not.\nYou might look at handbrake.\n", "Q: The connection from my macbook to my t.v. is delayed/slow I have my 2013 macbook connected to my brand new Sharp HD t.v. through an HDMI wire. I'm basically using the t.v. as a monitor.  It looks great.  The only rub is that there is a slight delay when I give a command to my computer and what shows up on the t.v. screen.\nFor example, the mouse will move a split second later on the t.v. than it does on the computer monitor.  It's a small thing that makes a big difference in operating the computer.  It makes for sluggish and more difficult work.  Not truly real time.\nI've changed wires and got the most expensive \"cinnamon\" wire they had at Best Buy, which didn't make a difference. Any suggestions on how to tighten this up?\nThank you!\nMitch\n\nA: Check if your TV has a mode called PC mode or Game mode. TVs now a days perform some additional processing to the input signal to supposedly improve the picture quality. This, however, can add a bit of delay. Samsung TVs have a mode called Game mode which turns this off. I am not sure what it is called on Sharp TVs. If you cant find one, cycle through each video preset and try to find one which has no delay.\nAdditional info:\nIn case your TV doesn't have a game or PC mode, it may still allow you to modify the required settings manually. Search for something along the lines of 'Picture Noise Reduction', 'Motion Enhancer' or 'Skin Tone Enhancer' in the video settings and turn it off.\n", "Q: What are the screen dimensions of the iPhone 4s and iPhone 5s? What are the dimensions of the screen on the iPhone 4s and 5s? I mean the length and width of the actual display, in mm or cm. I tried searching for it online but all the sites I looked just provide the resolution and not the actual dimensions.\n\nA: This can be easily calculated with the available information.

The answer is that yes, these two apps which have the same name are actually wholly different apps, one for each operating system, and the version numbers are equally different.

I want users to be able to connect to the network by selecting the SSID on their iOS devices.\nIs there a way to do this from the command line? I can select \"Create Network...\" from the networking menu but that has 2 problems.\n\n\n*\n\n*The created network shows up under a special section \"devices\" on iOS. I want it to appear  in the normal list of wifi hotspots. How do I do this? I'm assuming maybe I can do it manually I can set whatever needs to be set so iOS can't tell the difference between my mac and a normal router\n\n*When selecting it in iOS is says it's not connected to the internet. I want to avoid that message. I get that I'm not actually letting them connect to the internet. The question is, how and I fool iOS into thinking it is connected to the internet. I have a feeling this is related to #1 because how does iOS know there's no internet when it hasn't actually connected to the network yet (I haven't selected it).\nNote: any pointers into apple docs would be great as well. I've even tried looking at how something similar would be done in Linux in the hopes that it might lead to ideas about OSX but my Google foo is weak for this topic.\n\nA: What you are trying to do is indeed possible, but it requieres a lot of work to get it working.\nI thought about that for a while and it is a great Idea to use a mac as Wifi-Router, especially in Virtual-Test-Environments. But Mac OS X does not work like that. \nThe reason for that is, that Mac OS X only starts the service, if you really have Internet connection. Why would you share your internet, if there is no internet. Simple as that. Simple as a Mac ;D\nBut you can work around this by setting up virtual Network Interfaces, that would simulate internet. \nThere is a nice discussion about Virtual network interfaces on Stack Overflow, meantoning your problem in a comment :\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/87442/virtual-network-interface-in-mac-os-x \n(especially the long post by \"bmasterswizzle\" with the comment : \"I've tested it and yes, it does. I was able to share my OpenVPN tun0 device (from my Ethernet connection) over my WiFi using this method. \")\nYou get this problem often with Virtual Machines, because there OS X also shares ethernet via the NAT-Bridge, but in fact does not need to have Internet Access to make it work.\nIt is a bit of an efford and I think you could easily go around it, if you have a script that fakes the Internet Traffic on En0 so you can share the En0 to the Wifi-Adapter. But I have no clue how to talk to the en0 interface via command line and faking traffic.\nAnd as long as there is no traffic, your Mac won't share the Connection.\n\nA: This type of network is know as an Ad-hot network. The procedure to create one is listed here: http://www.maclife.com/article/columns/maclife_101_how_create_adhoc_network\nAfter creating an Ad-hoc network, you will see it listed in the list of wifi networks on your iOS device.\nNote that you wont be able to connect to the internet using your WiFi connection if a device is connected to the adhoc network. But since you dont want the other device to access the internet, this should be ok.\nI don't think the act of just connecting to a wifi network results in the message you stated. I have only seen that message, say, if you launch the browser or open an app that requires an Internet connection and as far as I know, there is no way to disable that message on an iOS device.\n", "Q: Need a Google Voice app for Mac Background\nI've been using Google Voice for about a year. During that time, I've been also using a Mac app called GrowlVoice that appears in my menubar. It allows listening to voicemail messages and also sending text messages.\nError\nNow when I launch Google Voice I get an error:\n\nUnable to sign in to myemailadress@gmail.com\nUnable to build JSON object from JSON string\"\n\nWhat I tried\nI deleted GrowlVoice's app using an CleanMyMac, an app that supposedly deletes apps and all their associated files. I then re-downloaded GrowlVoice from the App Store, but I'm still getting the error.\nFurther Research\nI also went to the website of the GrowlVoice developer and sent him a message. I'm writing here too because the developer's site hasn't been updated since 2012 and GrowlVoice is no longer being sold on the App Store so it's apparently no longer in development.\nQuestions\nSo, my questions are:\n\n*\n\n*How can I fix the JSON errors?\n\n*Is there another app that would have similar functionality as GrowlVoice?\n\nUpdate\nApparently today Google made changes to Google Voice which broke GrowlVoice, which is why GrowlVoice was pulled from the Mac App store. Now I have to log into my Google account in a browser if I want to listen to voicemail messages or send texts on my Mac.\n\nA: The developer's twitter page said that Google has revoked access to Google Voice for GrowlVoice so they can no longer support the app.  It has since been removed from the App Store as well and I am also looking for an alternative to this wonderful application.\n\nA: Check the Twitter feed for the developer. As of nine hours ago GrowlVoice access to Google Voice has been shutdown and will not be corrected.\n\nA: I have a Mac and Google Voice. I use Chrome too so I mostly just use the Google Voice extension for Chrome, since Chrome is pretty much open all the time on my computer. The only other program I've seen for Google Voice for Mac besides GrowlVoice is a dashboard widget. It can send text messages and place calls, but I think all it does for incoming messages is make a Growl notification. It doesn't show the inbox in the widget. I mostly just use it for a quick toggle of which of my phones to activate/deactivate.\n\nA: I was upset about GrowlVoice not working too. I have another app for Mac called VoiceMac which isn't too bad. it has to be running in the dock to receive notifications on real time otherwise you get your texts the next time that you open the app. You can find it here. https://mrgeckosmedia.com/applications/info/VoiceMac\n", "Q: Mac App Store Search Autocompletion I recognized something strange:\nOn my MacBook Pro (Mid 2008, Mavericks) I get suggestions when searching in the Mac App Store.\nBut on my MacBook Air (Late 2010, Mavericks) I don't get them.\n\n\n\nA: Try resetting the Mac App Store.\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable the debug menu and restart the Mac App Store.\ndefaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool true\n\n\n*Choose the Reset Application option and restart the Mac App Store.\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to generate random passwords in Safari, without iCloud? I know that iCloud Keychain has a feature where it offers to generate strong, random passwords directly in Safari. Some third-party password managers allow it, but I'd prefer to store the password in the OS X keychain, so I'm really just looking for a password generator, not full-blown manager. For other browsers there is addons that offer similar functionality. It's possible to do it in the regular non-iCloud Keychain Access app, but this is a bit cumbersome.\nIs there any way of generating a random password directly in Safari, but without using iCloud keychain?\n\nA: One can always keep a sign-up form with a displayable password field close at hand, for instance Google's.

I have been looking for a good Macbook docking solution for months\nThe Belkin Thunderbolt Express Dock doesn't seem like a good option based on the reviews on Amazon.com.\nI also noticed that there is kickstarter project called ZenDock which is not going to be publicly available till Q2, 2014.\nAre there any other good solutions to this problem?\n\nA: A few months ago my organization made the decision to make docking stations a standard item to be ordered with all Macs.  We've evaluated the Belkin Thunderbolt dock, the Matrox DS1, the Kwikdock, the LandingZone docks and had previously used Henge docks.\nThe Henge docks proved to be a constant pain for both users and our support team.  The connections in the bottom of the dock frequently came loose, meaning the end user would lose USB connectivity, network connectivity, etc even though from their perspective the Mac appeared to be docked correctly.\nThe Kwikdock didn't have the build quality we desired.\nThe Belkin Thunderbolt dock and Matrox DS1 dock are both very similar in that they're a hub that you connect all of your connections to, then connect to your Mac via a thunderbolt cable.  The downsides we found to these two were cost the necessity to order a thunderbolt cable in addition to the dock.  Our end users are also much more accustomed to the traditional docks offered by Dell and other PC manufacturers, were you click it into place and go.  This is the same reason we didn't pre-order a Zendock.\nWe ended up going with the LandingZone.  It offers the traditional docking style that our users are accustomed to, the build quality seems to be very good, it's much cheaper than the alternatives and can be further reduced in cost by ordering in bulk.  It DOES require a separate driver for network connectivity but it's very lightweight and they seem to be committed to providing updates in a timely fashion.\nI've deployed about 25 of the LandingZones so far and aside from two support calls where  it hadn't been locked completely in place I've only heard good things from my end users.  We have yet to receive our 13\" Retina MBP docks but we do have a tracking number so I'm confident they'll arrive soon.\nHope that helps!\n\nA: Most of the docks I know are very similar to the belkin one. Take a look at this article:\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/2099483/thunderbolt-docks-review-the-best-way-to-connect-your-macbook-to-your-other-devices.html\nThis one from Hengedocks appears to be an interesting solution, with 3 thunderbolt ports instead  of 2 and plenty of other connection, unfortunately it's not yet available:\nhttp://hengedocks.com/order_horizontal_dock.php\n\nA: ZenDock is still wrapping up production and have been keeping everyone in the loop on their progress via their blog: http://www.zenboxx.blogspot.com/\n", "Q: Using an iMac to extend a Wireless network I'm right on the edge of my WiFi range, but my iMac is hard-wired with Gigabit Ethernet.

However, when I try to do so (at System Preferences > Time Machine > Select Backup Disk...), I get the following error:\n\n\"You do not have the necessary read, write and append privileges on the\n  selected network backup disk.\"\n\nThe laptop is running OSX 10.9, and the mac mini is running OSX 10.8.\nHas anyone using OSX Server for backups experienced something similar to this? Does anyone know how to fix it (without losing all of my previous backups)?\n\nA: tl;dr: make sure the user and group filesystem permissions (not just the Sharing permissions) are set for the user account that will be used to access the Time Machine disk over the network\n\nMy configuration includes a Mac Mini running macOS Catalina with an attached USB HDD, and a MacBook Air (among other MacBooks) running Monterey. I wanted to use the disk attached to the Mac Mini as the Time Machine disk for all systems on the network. I kept hitting permissions issues, including this one. The previous answers here such as the one by jefe2000 were not sufficient to resolve it.\nThe external disk was formatted as HFS+ (Journaled, Case Sensitive, Encrypted) and mounted by the Mac Mini.\nThe Mac Mini itself had Time Machine configured and working, backing up to the root of the external disk (/Volumes/ExternalHDD).\nIn my System Preferences > Sharing > File Sharing, I had to add a directory inside the external disk (e.g. /Volumes/ExternalHDD/RemoteBackups) as the shared folder. For this shared folder, I used the following settings\n\n*\n\n*under \"Options\" (the button on the main File Sharing page) I enabled \"Share files and folders using SMB\" along with AFP (though I think only SMB ended up being used for this). I did not add any Windows File Sharing users.\n\n\n*For my RemoteBackups shared folder, under \"Users\" I added my Mac Mini's primary administrator account for Read & Write. I left System Administrators and System Group to the default (also read & write). I set \"Everyone\" to \"No Access\"\n\n\n*When you right-click on the shared folder, you get extra menus including \"Advanced Options\". For this, I selected \"Share over SMB and AFP\". I also selected \"Share as a Time Machine backup destination\"\nThis is roughly where other users' answers stop. However, it was not enough for me. I could see the Mac Mini's RemoteBackups shared Time Machine \"disk\" (really just a directory on a volume), but every time I tried to use it, I would get the same permissions errors.\nTo debug the situation on my MacBook, in Finder I went to Go > Connect to a Server and entered the address for my Mac Mini; smb://mymac.local. Use the Mac Mini's system admin account to log in, and you get a menu with shared volumes available. From here, I could see the RemoteBackups directory. But after opening it in Finder, I could not make any new Folders. Confusingly, if I did a \"Get Info\" on the RemoteBackups directory, at the bottom under Permissions it actually said that I had Read & Write access, but any write attempts or attempts to adjust permissions would get blocked with permissions errors.\nThis indicated to me that while I had the SMB and network sharing settings configured correctly, I was missing a critical piece: the permissions on the disk itself.\nBack on the Mac Mini, I pulled up a terminal window and cd'd over to /Volumes and could see from ls -l that the the ExternalHDD disk had root ownership and wheel user group. The same was in effect for the RemoteBackups subdirectory located on that drive. This appears to be OK for processes running locally on the Mac Mini, but evidently not OK for remote access. I had to run chown -R myadminusername /Volumes/ExternalHDD/RemoteBackups to give the RemoteBackups dir ownership to my Mac Mini's local admin user account. For good measure, I also ran chmod -R ug+rw /Volumes/ExternalHDD/RemoteBackups to make sure everything had read write access under that directory tree.\nAnother measure I took was to dig through my Keychain app on the MacBook and delete any saved logins for my Mac Mini server, and for Time Machine. I also rebooted the MacBook and Mac Mini a couple times during this whole process for good measure to make sure all the updates were getting applied.\nAfter all this, on my MacBook, I selected the Mac Mini's Time Machine disk RemoteBackups again (with encryption, logging in with the Mac Mini's admin account), and finally everything works.\n\nA: On my iMacs running macOS High Sierra (version 10.13.6) I had to explicitly add filesystem permissions for Time Machine to function correctly over the network. This resolved the You do not have the necessary read, write, and append privileges on the selected network backup disk error message.\nI'm using username_A on both the source and destination iMacs.\nOn the source iMac, I used username_A when configuring Time Machine to run over the network to the shared network drive.\nOn the destination iMac (the one sharing out the Time Machine backup disk over my home network), I had to add username_A to the list of allowed users in System Preferences → Sharing → File Sharing. I also had to pull up the Get Info window for the shared disk and add username_A to the Sharing & Permissions list at the bottom of the window. Once I had added username_A in both places on the destination iMac, I was able to get Time Machine running over the network.\n\nA: I still don't know what caused the issue to come up in the first place, but I was able to get around it by going to Server.app > File Sharing > [my backup volume] > Edit Share Point... and then adding my user to the Access section of the page with Read & Write permissions.\nI don't know how/why it worked before or why changing the user password caused it to stop working, but doing the above gets around the issue.\n\nA: If you've previously connected to said network drive before and are having trouble reconnecting, it's possible, the folder where the time machine back-up resides is locked. I would try navigating to the network folder, look for \"TimeMachineBackup\" and if you see a locked logo on the folder, simply right click -> get info, and uncheck the locked box, then try initiating the time machine to use the network drive again.\n\nA: The same error message occurred in my case. I have a Time Machine set up with netatalk. Initially, I had only one user, but later I added additional users and added them all to a timemachine group, with the single sparse bundles owned by the respective users. Even though a backup already existed and the user has full permissions on the sparse bundle, the Time Machine backup failed.\nIt turns out that the user also needs write access to the folder where the sparse bundle is located.\nI can understand that this is required for an initial backup, where a sparse bundle is created (and renamed). However, the Time Machine client checks for the write permission even if the sparse bundle already exists.\n", "Q: Copy/Paste creates a hidden files I have a copied music files to USD drive, but after copy/paste, the files are hidden.

As you discovered by opening them, they contain metadata for the files that you copied.\nSince the disk is formatted as MS-DOS, OS X needs somewhere to store certain metadata for the file. This metadata is stored in an AppleDouble file. Such metadata includes Finder information and extended attributes.\nThese files begin with a dot, so are hidden. You shouldn't unhide these files, or modify them. You can remove AppleDouble files using dot_clean -m\n", "Q: One Odd-Sized page in Pages Document for PDF Need to embed a Numbers spreadsheet in a Pages doc that will “live” as a PDF. Generating a scaled image that I then embed results in mediocre resolution.\n\nA: If there's no way to scale your numbers doc small enough to fit on a pages sized page, you'll have to use a larger paper size (e.g. legal). \nIf you only want your numbers doc to be a different size, you'll need to handle them separately. I'm not aware of any way to change the dimensions of a single page in pages directly but... \nIf the document will \"live\" as a PDF, why not export the pages doc to PDF in standard Letter or A4 size without your spreadsheet.\nThen create a custom page size in your Numbers doc to fit the spreadsheet as a whole and export that to pdf.\nFinally, use preview to combine the two documents. \n", "Q: How to keep Mail from encoding messages with the old charset=windows-1252?

This will ensure that the message goes out as UTF-8.  Dingbats are in the Unicode 2700 range, e.g. ✈ .  You need to add this from the Character Viewer, not by just changing to a \"dingbat\" font, which may not be Unicode.\n\nA: Turning off smart quotes and dashes seems to fix this problem.

I have a DisplayLink 3rd monitor on a Mac Mini.  Half the time I wake the computer up, the DisplayLink syncs but the graphics onscreen are garbled.  Reaching behind the computer and unplugging/plugging the DisplayLink USB cable fixes it every time.\nBut this stinks.\nIs there a terminal command or AppleScript I could run to make the Mac pretend the USB device was replugged?  This would be a much nicer way to bring the DisplayLink back to life.\nI found the unmounting USB drives answer which is similar but obviously won't work for a display.\nThanks for any hints.\nAs for the DisplayLink, it's pretty laggy and I'm stuck on Mountain Lion, but it was cheap and recycles my old monitor.  It works just well enough that I'd recommend it to someone with low expectations and wants to use it for mostly static tasks like reading documents and code.

According to Google, \"Swiffy converts Flash SWF files to HTML5, allowing you to reuse Flash content on devices without a Flash player (such as iPhones and iPads).\" - https://www.google.com/doubleclick/studio/swiffy/\nBut, if you check the \"Supported features and browsers\" - at https://www.google.com/doubleclick/studio/swiffy/gettingstarted.html - it turns out sound in swiffy files is \"partially supported\", which means not at all by Mobile Safari iOS 5, Android Browser 4.0.3 and  Firefox 15, but is supported (maybe only \"partially\", it's not clear), by Chrome 22, Safari 6.0, Internet Explorer 9 and Opera 12.\nI have converted a few flash-movies-with-sound to swiffy and seems to me the Google table should be about \"Supported features and operating systems\". Swiffy files play, with sound, on all my Windows browsers (IE, FF, Chrome). But on an iPad,  using both Safari and Chrome, swiffy.html is dead silent.  \nSo the question is... does anyone know why it is that on iPads, regardless of the browser (or at least those two), swiffy sound cannot be heard and is there any solution? If there isn't, swiffy has been oversold as a means of \"reusing Flash content on devices without a Flash player (such as iPhones and iPads)\" if on those devices there's no sound. \nIt's a mystery why Google hasn't figured out a way of having swiffy deliver sound on iPads through Chrome. So is the problem Apple's iOS, and why? \n\nA: HTML audio has shaky compatibility across all the different browsers.\nFor this to work correctly, the audio would need to be converted into MP3, OGG and WAV formats. (in addition to converting the video, which different browsers prefer different formats, too)\nIn short, HTML audio and video is young, and a fuller experience will come once the standards mature, and the browsers homogenise format compatibility.\n", "Q: Can folder actions be inherited?

So my computers been running really slowly the last couple of weeks, and been crashing down (or I have been forced to restart it alot)…\nI came across my iPhoto (11) library, which wasn't working. When i opened it, it said something caused iPhoto not to work properly and it gave me a command (Hold down option and command and press on iPhoto), which gave me 4 options. They were something like 1) Rebuild Thumbnails 2) Repair database 3)Rebuild database and i don't remember the 4th one. None of the first 3 were working, iPhoto just crashed. So i choose the one called \"Rebuild database\", and it started doing that. When that was done, all my iPhoto pictures were gone. And i think i had about over 10.000 photos from many years… so its pretty annoying and extremely depressing, if i can't recover them. I never have figured out how to use \"Time Machine\", so i haven't backed it up on that i think….Do i have any other options? Can i in some way take my Macbook Pro back in time a couple of days and get my pictures back? \nWould really help if you have an idea, or if you know that it's not possible, everything would help since I'm not the most technical girl when it comes Macbook Pro's and problems like this…\n:))\n\nA: First: Nothing is lost. Yet. It is only hidden from plain view.\nNext, the file and menu names below might not be correct. I am doing this from a German OS, and I did not want to reboot just for the filenames.\niPhoto keeps your photos in a subfolder, named \"iPhoto Library\" of the \"Pictures\" folder in the user directory. You need to control-click that folder (it actually looks like a file, but it is a folder, trust me!)\nThen you will see a popup menu, and the third entry from the top (\"show database\" or something like that) is what you need. It will open the folder and display its content. One of the subfolders is called \"Database\", another is called \"Masters\". The Masters folder contains more subfolders, one each for each year of photos. Inside you will find subfolders for the months and inside again for the days. There you will find all your unchanged photos. If you rotated, cropped or modified them in any way, those photos are in the Database folder. I can only encourage you to explore them and copy all what you want to preserve to an external drive, so it can be added to iPhoto again.\nBut please fix the cause of the slowness and the crashes first! If your hard drive is dying, make a full copy and work on that to recover your photos.\n\nA: You haven't really said how much time and/or money you want to spend to try to get the pictures back.  If money is no object, stop using the computer right now and see a computer consultant.\nAnother approach, which might be more work than you want:  \n\n\n*\n\n*stop using the drive as soon as you can:  stop using it as the startup disk, stop storing stuff on it\n\n*back it up using Disk Utility (rather than drag to another disk icon), using another computer if you can;  then perhaps go back to using the drive as usual.  \n\n*(not really part of recovery, but PLEASE TURN ON TIME MACHINE if you care about your pictures)\n\n*try other tools for recovering removed files.  You might be able to find some recently deleted image files, which you could then import into iPhoto again.\n\n\nFor 'other tools', I don't have any particular preference or experience (that is, since I started using Time Machine years ago - did I mention you should TURN ON TIME MACHINE?).  You could try DiskWarrior, TestDisk, or BSD-style tools. \nGood luck.\n", "Q: Can't download over MacPorts So I'm trying to install the PDO drivers for PHP via Macports.

I just want to snap a photo on my phone and work with it on my Mac. Currently I text it to myself (so it comes up in Messages on the desktop)-- quick but hacky. Email is 2nd option (slower). Airdrop doesn't work iPhone to Mac.\nI guess the \"official\" method would be via iPhoto-- but Photo Stream takes time to sync and even after it does, launching iPhoto and exporting a single image to JPG is massively more complicated than it should be, so going this route is really the last resort.\nIs the answer Dropbox Photo Sync, or some other 3rd-party app/service?\n(P.S. to mods, AFAIK this is not a dupe question-- I searched existing questions closely before posting.)\n\nA: Photo Stream isn't actually as bad as it seems. You don't need to launch iPhoto to get the photo — it's already on your Mac and much faster than it appears in iPhoto.\nYour Photo Stream is stored in:\n~/Library/Application Support/iLifeAssetManagement/assets/sub\n\nGo to this folder and sort by date. Inside those folders are JPGs of all your photos.\nYou can create a smart folder to only show JPGs sorted by date modified which gives you an automatic updating folder of your pictures. Drag this smart folder to your Dock for immediate, real-time access.\n\nA: \n AirBridge\nTransfer Image or Text between your iPhone and Mac\n\nYou can do this with AirBridge. This lets you transfer images and text between your iOS device and Mac in a similar way to AirDrop, except through a Wi-Fi network.\nOpen the iOS app and make sure the menu bar app is running, then in the iOS app you can tap a button to send the last photo that was taken or to select a photo from your Camera Roll. This sends the photo over the network to your Mac and ends up in your Downloads folder.\n\nA: If you are willing to plug your iPhone into your Mac, try using Preview. Once the iPhone is connected to the Mac, bring up Preview and click on \"File\" and select \"import from iPhone\". (This option will not be listed unless your iPhone is plugged in to your Mac.) You will see a screen full of thumbnail images of all the photos on your iPhone. You can select \"import all\" or you can  select a single image, or hold down the \"command\" key to make any number of individual selections. When you click on \"Import\" and select a destination, the photo will be on your Mac in the location you chose. (This same procedure also works for importing a file from another device, an SD card, for example, as long as it's plugged into your Mac.)\n\nA: Personally, I use PhotoSync and its OS X companion app to transfer photos from my iPhone to my Mac over wifi (and to any other device that is running the app). PhotoSync also has a \"auto transfer\" feature that will automatically transfer new photos in the camera roll when you are at a predefined location. There are also several other apps, such as Instashare or Image Transfer that will accomplish this kind of transfer in much the same way. \nServices like Dropbox, OneDrive, etc, will also do what you need (the iOS apps usually also have a automatic \"camera roll backup\" style feature) and most provide an OS X app to create a folder on your Mac where the files get synced. However, unlike a direct wifi transfer, you have the overhead of having to upload/download files over the internet first.\nFinally, if you don't mind physically connecting your phone to your Mac, you could also use the built-in Image Capture app (in /Applications/Image Capture.app) to import your photos.\n\nA: I like to use a quick little script to grab the latest image from the command line - lastpic. This probably isn't the type of solution you're looking for, but it's useful if you work at the command line a lot. \n\nA: Connect your phone to your Mac via USB.\nDon't launch iTunes.\nInstead, launch Image Capture, an app that comes with your Mac.\nDownload from there.\n\nA: If you don't mind not using a GUI and being jailbroken, I use SSH for this purpose. It's a simple rsync command (on the device, OpenSSH and rsync must be installed via Cydia):\nrsync -av --progress --delete-after mobile@my_device_name:~/Media/DCIM/10?APPLE/ $HOME/documents/pictures/from-ipad\n\nTo sync the PhotoStream images, I have a Bash function (on the iOS device, GNU find and coreutils also must be installed via Cydia):\nisync-photostream ()\n{ \n    local i=0;\n    local device=\"${1:-my_iphone}\"\n\n    # The actual directory is uniquely named\n    # If you have only screenshots (PNGs) this will not work\n    local stream_dir=$(ssh \"$device\" 'dirname $(find ~/Media/PhotoStreamsData -iname '*.jpg' | head -n 1)' 2>/dev/null);\n\n    if ! echo \"$stream_dir\" | fgrep -q 'PhotoStreamsData'; then\n        echo 'Could not get directory'\n        return 1\n    fi\n\n    rsync --progress --force --delete-after -rltvd \"$device\":\"${stream_dir}/\" \"$HOME/documents/pictures/photo-stream\"\n}\n\nYou may want to customise the rsync commands to not delete (by removing --delete-after). I prefer 1:1 backups most of the time when I use rsync.\n\nA: You can also select the photo on your iPhone, press the share button and use AirDrop (if your mac is on the same network). It'll automatically download it to your mac and put it in the Downloads folder.\n", "Q: Change carrier settings in iPhone post iOS7, possible? I recently moved to a new country, and got a new SIM for use over there. The sim came with an old no-name android phone, that works fine (can use data, call, text, all). \nWhen I insert the same sim in my iPhone 5 with iOS 7.1, it can receive calls & texts, but not make calls, send texts or use the data connection. I assume this is because it still has my old carriers settings. Pre iOS 7 there was a setting to change carrier settings, but it seems to be gone? Is it possible to go around this, with or without jailbreaking? \nIf it's of interest, I changed from ePlus in Germany to Softbank Prepaid in Japan. \n\nA: Just go to http://www.unlockit.co.nz on your iPhone and follow the instructions. There are similar sites as well that do the same thing, and you don't even have to be jailbroken. There are some tweaks that enable the APN settings in the Cellular section of the Settings app, though, if that's what you really want.\n", "Q: Weird MacBook track pad issue I just decided to dig out an old white mac book I have sitting around to poke around with.  I'm fairly certain it is a lost cause, but I thought I'd see if anyone has any ideas.\nSo I can move the mouse around the screen, but I cannot click anything on the screen.  Rebooting into Lion recovery I seem to be able to click, but I loose that as soon as I connect wifi.  \nHere's the kicker, using an external mouse I get the same behavior.  I can move, but clicking does nothing.  \nI think it's hardware, but I don't think it's the trackpad.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: This was supposed to be a comment, but it turned out too long.\nIt might be that the trackpad is slightly damaged so that the button is somehow pressed down constantly.\nI have a black macbook that clicks every time I rest my hands anywhere near the area below the keyboard or around the trackpad. The plastic around that part of the case has kind of caved in and it affects the trackpad. If something similar has happened to your macbook, only that it is constantly pressing the button, you wouldn't be able to press any buttons with any mouse.\nOn my own macbook, all of this (the case caving in) started after almost the entire bottom edge of the top case was breaking off, like in the picture below, which is a common problem on many of the macbooks (picture through google).\n\nDisabling the internal trackpad while only using the keyboard\n\n*\n\n*Open Spotlight.

After taking it out of clamshell mode yesterday to use as a laptop, there was a heavy flicker on the screen. It seemed to affect mostly the startup screen and background image. Panicking, I started googling for solutions, people reportedly fixed it by resetting the SMC and PRAM. I tried that a few times and I don't think that it worked. But after a few minutes the flickering started to gradually go away, until it eventually became normal again. I'd say it took about 10 minutes to become normal again. \nMy procedure for taking the MBA out of clamshell mode is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put MBA to sleep from the Apple menu.\n\n*Switch off external screen.\n\n*Unplug peripherals from MBA.\n\n*Open up MBA and use as laptop.\n\n\nMy question is, does anyone know why this is happening, and what the fix is?\n\nA: Putting MBA in to Sleep mode will make it write a Sleep image, that is a file that contains your last settings ect.\nNow when it wakes up it tries to load that file just to find out all is different now, no monitor ? \nThen it goes in to switching the display modes that creates the flickering.\nMy advice, skip the Sleep mode and just open the clamshell, then turn off the monitor and unplug it.\n", "Q: Is there a simple texteditor accessible from the menu bar for making fast snippets?

In fact, due to the custom HTML in the AppleScript code, you could set any compatible colour + formatting combination, such as italics, bold, font size, highlight or text background, who knows what else.\nE.g. for red bold it would be:\nset noteBody to \"<body><p style=\\\"color:#FF0000;\\\" >redtext</p></body>\"\n\nHelpful tips:\n\n\n*\n\n*This relies on you not customising Notes' menu item shortcuts from their defaults.\n\n*This relies on you only having one main Notes window open and then another for the note you're working in.\n\n*May have to customise other things in AppleScript according to how you use Notes, e.g. your chosen default account.\n\n\nIf anyone has improvements to this code or method, please contribute and I'll test it myself.\n\nA: In TextEdit you can do something like:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell window 1 of process \"TextEdit\"\n    set {x, y} to value of attribute \"AXSelectedTextRange\" of text area 1 of scroll area 1\nend tell\ntell application \"TextEdit\"\n    set color of characters x thru y of document 1 to {65535, 0, 0}\nend tell\n\nI couldn't figure any way to do that in Notes though.\n\nA: You are right -- there's no shortcut (yet) to change the color in Notes (source:https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201236).\nThe closest shortcut would be command + T which opens the Font window where you can change font color.\n", "Q: Finder folder permission asking some folders on my mac asks your my password to rename, add, delete files in a folder. I checked the folder privileges in Get Info to compare with normal folders, it was the same but the result is totally different. Can anyone tell me how to disable or fix permission issues for finder folders? Thanks!\n\nA: Generally speaking repairing permissions is a quick and easy task. head on over to /Applications/Utilities and look for Disk Utility. Launch it, select your HD and then click on repair permissions and let it do it's thing. That could take a couple of minutes or 15-20 depending on how messed up things are.\nWhen I do this I usually quit out of ALL other apps and let disk utility do it's thing in peace. Then I run it again, and again until I get no more errors.\nAll of that assumes that it is a simple permissions error. It could be you are trying to modify a folder in a location that Apple does not want you changing things, the /Applications and /Applications/Utilities folder spring to mind.\nIf, however, these issues are on your desktop or in the folders Apple sets aside for your files (documents, music, pictures, etc.) then yes there is a problem and it MIGHT be more than permissions. Could be actual disk errors.\nIn Disk Utility you can \"Verify Disk\" but you can't \"Repair Disk.\" That requires booting from install media, the recovery partition or the disk repair utility of your choice (my choice is Diskwarrior, YMMV).\nIf repairing permissions doesn't fix the issue AND you are working with folders Apple deigns to allow you to work with, use Disk Utility (or 3rd party tools) to repair the disk/file structure.\n\nA: I fixed it by copying the folder to external drives and copying back into the Pictures folder. \n", "Q: Should I put the SSD in the Optical or Main Bay when replacing Optical Drive? I have 2010 MBP.\nWanted to put SSD in optical bay (and use it as main boot drive) because main bay has SMS (motion detection) that HDD would use.\nThe only problem is that optical bay in my computer seems to have lower speed:\nLink Speed:                3 Gigabit\nNegotiated Link Speed:     1.5 Gigabit\n\nmain bay:\nLink Speed:                3 Gigabit\nNegotiated Link Speed:     3 Gigabit\n\nI have Samsung 840 PRO SSD - would this lower speed be significant and noticeable?\n\nA: You should go ahead and do what you first propose of the SSD in the optical and the HDD in the main.\nThere are two things to consider with speed, data rate and latency.  Data rate is how fast the data can transfer from point A to point B.  Something to keep in mind though is HDD are not that fast and may not use the full 3 Gigabits it is given.  A WD green drive is made to save power and reduce heat.  This means it spins slower, so it can't pick up the data as fast.  As a result you are not at transfer link saturation.\nThe SSD does not need to spin and and only access one part of a file at a time, it has the entire drive accessible.  As a result it can saturate the line.\nLatency is also important, it takes time for the HDD to get to the files that are needed, for the SSD the files are already there.  As a result, during boot the computer is not waiting for the next file to come around.  It can go file after file after file.  Reduced latency means faster speeds.\nAlready your first proposed setup is wining, but while doing some research, I found answered question: What is an SSD drive's negotiated link speed?.  The optical bay is capable of 3 gigabits per second, however, the negotiated speed is 1.5 because the optical drive is slow and doesn't need the 3.\nThe optical drive negotiated for a lower speed but can handle faster on the bus. If you already have the drive one thing you can do just test it out yourself, try one configuration then another. There is a free program called Black Magic disk speed test (itunes.apple.com/us/app/blackmagic-disk-speed-test/id425264550) that measures your hard drive speed.\n\nA: I always recommend putting the HDD in the best shock mount and the SSD in the least best shock mount. So leave the HDD in the HDD slot.\n\n\n*\n\n*Unless you know for certain that you will have substantial time where transfers above 1.5 Gbps will happen, then there's no speed to be gained by placing an SSD on a port that negotiates to 3.0 Gbps. \n\n*The Time you will lose with a hardware failure far outweighs any time you might make up even if you have some burst needs for data transfer that fast.\n\n\nIf you have specific benchmarks that need to be met, only then would I say go ahead and time things with the drives in both positions and then re-evaluate the plan. I'm sure there is a scenario where my initial advice is sub-optimal, but I haven't come across it yet.\n", "Q: Can't write to ~/Library, even though permissions look OK I'm totally stumped on this one — a Macbook Air, 10.9.2. As far as I can tell, I should be able to write to my Library directory. Everything I can see suggests I should be able to:\n[njvack@zot Library]$ sw_vers | grep ProductVersion\nProductVersion: 10.9.2\n[njvack@zot Library]$ id -a\nuid=503(njvack) gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff),403(com.apple.sharepoint.group.3),12(everyone),61(localaccounts),402(com.apple.sharepoint.group.2),100(_lpoperator),401(com.apple.sharepoint.group.1)\n[njvack@zot Library]$ pwd\n/Users/njvack/Library\n[njvack@zot Library]$ ls -ld@ .\ndrwx------@ 58 njvack  staff  1972 Apr 14 16:06 .\n    com.apple.metadata:_kTimeMachineNewestSnapshot    50 \n    com.apple.metadata:_kTimeMachineOldestSnapshot    50 \n[njvack@zot Library]$ touch foo\ntouch: foo: Permission denied\n\nAnd then for some reason I can work in ~/Library/iMovie, even though the permissions should be effectively identical:\nnjvack@zot Library]$ cd iMovie/\n[njvack@zot iMovie]$ pwd\n/Users/njvack/Library/iMovie\n[njvack@zot iMovie]$ ls -ld@ .\ndrwx------+ 4 njvack  staff  136 Apr 16 08:41 .\n[njvack@zot iMovie]$ touch foo\n\nWhat else could be causing this? What can I check? FWIW, Disk Utility's Check Permissions doesn't complain about anything.\nEDIT: As suggested, here's the ACL entries:\n[njvack@zot Library]$ ls -led .\ndrwx------@ 58 njvack  staff  1972 Apr 14 16:06 .\n 0: group:everyone deny add_file,delete,add_subdirectory,delete_child,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\n\n... and as ACLs override UNIX permissions, removing the ACLs was the trick:\n[njvack@zot Library]$ pwd\n/Users/njvack/Library\n[njvack@zot Library]$ chmod -RN .\n[njvack@zot Library]$ touch foo\n\nHow did I get such screwy ACLs on my ~/Library? I have no idea.\n\nA: To see the rest of the permissions (ACLs and file flags), add -e and -O to the ls command. I habitually use ls -leO@ as a \"tell me everything\" version of ls.\nIn this case, the problem was a \"deny\" access control entry, which will override the regular POSIX permissions. I have no idea how that might've gotten added to your ~/Library folder, but you can remove it with chmod -N ~/Library.\nIt's a bit late, but I would not have recommended using -R (apply recursively to all contents) on that chmod command, since there are some items inside ~/Library that are supposed to have ACLs (mostly to prevent accidental renaming or deletion of important items). But I don't think removing everything will to any actual harm, and if you're worried about other spurious ACLs, the recursive reset makes sense.\n", "Q: Photo library on external network drive I am quickly filling up my hard drive and would like to move my iPhoto library to an external drive. I understand that it must be on an HFS+ formatted drive to properly work. I would prefer to attach an HFS+ formatted drive to my TimeCapsule and use that drive via WiFi to store my iPhone library. But I see that there are issues with network dropouts. I would prefer to not have to schlep a drive out of the closet or upstairs every time I want to import photos.\nSo, my question what, if any, other options do I have if I want to get my photo library off my local storage and onto some sort of network option? I am open to switching away from iPhoto to Aperture or Lightroom if needed.\n\nA: There are two main options which I would go for:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put your library and contents on a network volume\nThis is the option that I went for on my setup, mainly because I did not consider the second option at that point in time. This option works fine for me — even when the network drops (which is pretty rare): the data transfer pauses and continues when the network reconnects.\nThis works fine for my relatively large Aperture library, but I see no reason for this not to work in iPhoto.\n✓ Easy to set up, just copy your entire library to a network drive and ⌥-launch iPhoto\n✓ Uses no space on your local machine\n✗ Possibly susceptible to network dropouts causing problems\n\n*Put your library on your local machine and the contents on a network volume\nThis alternative is probably better, but requires that you switch to Aperture. This way, you keep the library on your local machine but the media is stored on a network drive. This means that it uses very little space on your local machine but even if the network drops there is no chance of corruption/etc.\n✓ Much less likely to have problems due to network dropouts\n✓ Uses very little space on your local machine\n✗ Does use some space on your local machine\n✗ Harder to set up — not as simple as just copying your entire library\n\nA: Apple now has a document covering how to do this on the recent macOS versions and iCloud settings.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/photos/download-photos-to-your-mac-from-icloud-phtfa50fd1ec/mac\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201517\nI strongly recommend local storage over network storage based on years of experience these guidelines are generally true.\n\n*\n\n*Local storage is an order of magnitude faster than NAS\n\n*Local storage is an order of magnitude more reliable than NAS\n\n*Local storage is far easier to back up and understand and maintain\n\n*Local storage tends to become cheaper faster and faster faster than network. (When new tech arrives, it’s easy to drop one new drive in, expensive to upgrade your entire NAS) buying speed on one drive is always faster than many drives.\n\n*You spend more time futzing with Promise, Drobo, Synology software and Apple improves their iCloud sharing faster than the third parties do to support new OS, new features, etc...\n\nThere’s great use cases for network file share, but a large photo library isn’t it. Put your archived photo images in folder based storage where you please, but your photos library should be on local storage and not shared is my advice.\n", "Q: Is it possible to highlight text of inbox emails? In Preview.app, I can highlight and annotate text in a PDF file. Can we do the same thing to emails in my inbox in Mail.app?\nI have long time collaborate projects and I need to go back to previous emails very frequently — it would be great if I can highlight texts in emails.\n\nA: Apple Mail doesn't have a way to do this natively.  I can't think of another email client that does what you're describing either.  Here are some ideas and workarounds that might help you accomplish something similar to what you describe; perhaps one of them will suit your needs.\nThe closest option in Apple Mail is to use flags.  That only gives you the ability to flag a message.  You can't even add a note, let alone highlight the text and annotate it.  \nYou could try a third-party application like MailTags (Mavericks 10.9 support is currently in beta).  It's a paid application with a robust tagging system, as well as the ability to add notes.  This isn't a perfect solution since it doesn't allow you to highlight specific text within the email.  MailTags has a free demo; you might want to download it and see if you can reach a solution that works for you.\nAnother option would be to try Outlook:Mac.  It has both categories and flags built in.  You can also do things like create a task or a note from a message.  Once you have created a task or a note from a message, you can do things like highlight text, but not annotate it.  It also isn't the original message, but rather a copy of the message.  \nIf you do find something that works for what you want to accomplish, please do share it here.  Being more effective with email is a goal for many people, after all.\n\nA: You may want to look into printing the email as a PDF and then doing your annotations in Preview as normal. There's a PDF button at the bottom left of the system Print dialog that will let you do this.\n\nA: I found a solution http://best-mac-tips.com/2013/01/22/highlight-text-apple-mail/.

That fixed the hang, but now the font menus in all my apps are cluttered with at least 60+ fonts, most of which I will NEVER use.   \nI understand there are some fonts required by MacOS -- fair enough, these can't be disabled in Font Book.  \nSome apps have additional requirements, and these are not always clearly documented.  Dreamweaver seems to need Tahoma and Verdana, maybe others.\nBeyond those required by the system and my installed apps, I only need a small set of \"generic\" fonts, e.g. Times, Helvetica, Courier, Comic Sans, maybe a few more. (I'm a minimalist, get over it.)\nFont Book preferences offers \"Automatic font activation\", which is described as follows:  \"Activate fonts on your Mac whenever they’re needed by an app, even if you haven’t installed the fonts using Font Book.\"\nThis implies that I can start with no apps active, use Font Book to deactivate ALL fonts --excepting the required ones it won't deactivate-- and make a trip through (launch) all my apps.  Once that's done, I should be able to look in Font Book to see what's been activated -- in sum, all the fonts required by all my apps.  Correct? Is this a safe, reliable procedure?\n(Yeah, I know, some apps have private font repositories and clog up font menus using those, but that's a separate annoyance.)\n\nWhat is the safest procedure to deactivate fonts to declutter font menus?  \n\nA: Yes, automatic font activation should be perfect for this scenario. Disable all the fonts you can then open all your apps. Apps that require certain fonts will activate the fonts that you need.\nNote that you should also try some documents including PDFs as they may use additional fonts that the app itself will not ask to be activated.\n", "Q: How can I skip the desktop while cycling through finder windows with cmd+`? I often have to copy-paste files from 2 finder folders. I use the cmd + ` shortcut. But it cycles through Window 1 > Desktop > Window 2.\nIs there a way to skip desktop?\n\nA: Desktop is a folder, so cycling between active folder is an expected behavior in Finder. The only way to achieve what you want is to hide Desktop by entering the command below.\ndefaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop FALSE\n\nAfter this, cycling between window will happen to the folder you’ve opened. This suggestion is recommended only if you don’t use Desktop to place temporary files.\n\nA: If your goal is to go back and forth between two windows several times in a row, you can alternate between ⌘` and ⇧⌘`, which goes the other way round.\n", "Q: Can the SSD from a 2013 Macbook Air work with an adapter in a PC? I happen to have a spare SSD from a 2013 MBA and I'm wondering if anyone knows of an adapter card to use it in a PC? There are boards like this (http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/SSD/PCIe/OWC/Mercury_Accelsior/RAID) or this (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820249042) that superficially look like they're using the same type of slim SSD card. But on closer inspection, the connector is different.\n\nA: Try to call or write OWC, I know thier SSD for macbook airs works good so I think thier adaptor work fine aswell. But you have a 2013 and they only sell SSD for pre-2012 Airs, so maybe there is a change in the newest SSD that they does not support yet.\nMy advice, contact OWC before ordering any.\n", "Q: Overheating problem in MacBook Pro I have MacBook Pro I bought 6 months ago. When I charge it, it overheats in the charging port and my charging adapter is also hot.\nShould I return it or keep using it?\n\nA: MacBooks, especially Pros, do heat quite a bit when under heavy use. It is is perfectly normal. You can however check you system by downloading a temperature monitor. Most also allow you to monitor/control your fans. I personally have used smcFanControl before, but the app in the previous answer should do too. \nI once had a MacBook (2006, black model) with a faulty fan. It broke after years of use and plenty of dust. If the computer detects it is overheating past a certain threshold, it will automatically shut down to protect its components. I'm not sure what this threshold was, but I want to say about 100 degrees Celsius. \nAs long as the temperature of your Mac is not approaching this threshold and your fans are functioning properly, it should be fine. Don't hesitate in taking it somewhere to be checked if you're not fully confident however!\n\nA: you should definitely have it looked. Btw when you say overheat ... have you got an app to  quantify that?\ntry atMonitor ,a free app to do just that.. and if you can report your findings here\n\nA: I am writing 5 major things which you can use to prevent the overheating of your MacBook Pro:-\n\n\n*\n\n*Know your limitations\n\n*Uninstall the demanding software from your Mac\n\n*Test your system fans\n\n*Override your fans\n\n*Finally: Mac cleaner or cooler\n", "Q: User /System Permissions none.(Set to 000) A previously called friend of mine (As for now, after this he is no longer called that way) was messing up with my computer without my knowledge , and ultimately he set the System folder permissions to be 000 for all files in it.\nWell, as I realized everything froze and as soon as I restarted the computer it won't go pass Apple screen, however I'm able to run gnome on it. Is there any way I could reset the permissions for that entire folder anyhow? Or if there is not, is there any way I could extract some files on the hard drive? I'm completely desperate.\n\nA: Boot into single user mode (hold ⌘S on boot), then enter:\nmount -uw /\nchown root /\nchmod 1775 /\nexit\n\nThis will reset the permissions for the entire drive and all its contents allowing full read and write, and may take a long time — don't interrupt it. Once you are booted back in, go to Disk Utility and do a permissions repair to set the permissions correctly per OS X.\n", "Q: Where are the apache config files stored? I thought the apache config files were stored in /etc/apache2.  Yet if I remove the /etc/apache2 directory and run a sudo /usr/sbin/apachectl start the web server runs and serves up pages.\nIs there another set of config files?\n\nA: At least on my system (OS X 10.9.2), I see that apache is going to use /private/etc/apache2.

I need to revert my $PATH back to the default.\nThe catch here is that I broke it so bad that the echo $PATH command returns: /usr/\nthat's it, which means I can't use any of the methods described in other answers basically because any command returns \"unknown command\".\nI can't vi, I can't nano, I can't do squat over Terminal. All of that was working before I broke $PATH so I'm sure its all path related.\n\nA: This depends how you changed your path.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you changed it in your shell, just close the window and open a new shell.\n\n*If you changed it in a profile, change it there.\n\n\nYour path should look something like this:\nPATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin\n\n", "Q: How can I fix the Dual Monitor Fullscreen issue without updating to Maverick Here's the problem:\nWhen one app (for instance YoutTube or a game) goes fullscreen on monitor A, monitor B slides right, into a new gray \"desktop\" (like the ones one can add in the top right corner via the F3 button) that doesn't allow any apps to be in it. Because of this, one screen becomes useless when the other has a fullscreen app running.\nI see many others having the same problem, but I can't seem to find a way to fix it. \nI'm not interested in app specific fixes. \nThanks.\n\nA: This was fixed in Mavericks as you are aware, but I don't know of any canonical way to fix this for apps in prior versions of OS X, and even app specific fixes don't work properly.\nWhilst you said without updating to Mavericks, this really would be the best option since it is the 'official' fix to a core part of OS X.\n", "Q: Connecting new 2014 Mac Mini and 2009 Mac Book Pro thru one VGA display Is it possible to connect my mac Book Pro running 10.8.5 and a new Mac Mini running 10.9.2 Mavericks into one Apple VGA display, so as to be able to switch between desktops?\n\nA: Both MacBook Pro and the Mac Mini have Mini-DisplayPort on them. \nYou can connect the Mini-DisplayPort to an Minii-DisplayPort-to-VGA converter and then, \nconnect VGA cable on it to a two-port VGA DDM KVM switch, such as ConnectPRO's UR-12+.\nI had been using this configuration for years without problem. \n", "Q: Can I force Mac OS X not to complain when a volume is removed without first unmounting it? I have a USB flash drive that randomly disconnects itself from my Mac, and each time, I get a warning from Mac OS X (several computers, running 10.7-10.9) that it's been improperly removed.  I use it for portably storing Waves licenses, so I rarely write to it.  I'd like to suppress this message, as it's annoying and occasionally interferes with something I'm doing.  Can I get Mac OS X to shut up about this issue?  I tried using an NTFS filesystem on the drive to force it to mount read-only, but I still get a warning when it's disconnected.\n\nA: If you don't mind losing notification center, you can disable it.\nTo disable NC, thus stopping the removal message, type in:\nsudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui KeepAlive -bool false\n\nThen, type in \nkillall NotificationCenter\n\nTo re-enable it, type in:\nsudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui KeepAlive -bool true\n\nKeep in mind, besides disabling this message, it will disable ALL messages.\n", "Q: Does rebooting an iOS device always unpair connected Bluetooth peripherals? I am writing an iPad app that connects to wireless Bluetooth printers. We've discovered that when the iPad is rebooted, the printers that were paired and connected when the iPad was on do not automatically reconnect when the iPad reboots.\nI'm just trying to determine if this is normal behavior for all devices, or if there is something specific to these devices that is causing them to not reconnect.\nDoes anyone happen to have a counter-example (Bluetooth headset, keyboard, etc.) that when the iPad is rebooted reconnect automatically?\n\nA: To answer my own question, no, this isn't OS-wide behavior. It turns out one of the Bluetooth printer models we are supporting does in fact re-pair when the iPad is turned off and back on, so it looks like it's just a limitation of one printer's hardware.\n", "Q: Blocking internet access for a specific application on Mac OS X How can I block internet access to a specific application in Mac OS X? I need this to be done from the command line and hopefully use the ipfw terminal command.\nSpecifically I am looking to toggle the internet connection on and off in the iPhone simulator application since there is no airplane mode.\n\nA: You can use the Lulu open-source macOS firewall that aims to block unknown outgoing connections, unless explicitly approved by the user. Whilst it has a GUI, the set of blocked applications can be controlled via the command line by modifying the config file /Library/Objective-See/LuLu/rules.plist as explained in the Lulu webpage (near the bottom).\n\nA: I don't have a command line solution to do so, but there is an application that can successfully do exactly what you want.\nLittle Snitch is an application that has the ability to block certain processes and monitor connections. You could use this to block the iPhone simulator process from any network connectivity which would achieve the same effects as airplane mode, minus the native airplane mode features such as \"You must turn on Airplane mode to use this feature\", but so will a terminal command.\nHope this helps a little and good luck with developing your app! :)\n\nA: You could also block incoming connections to an application by using the firewall. follow the instructions given below:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201642\n", "Q: How can I force Safari to Save As webpage?

I tried adding USB ethernet connection in network preferences, tried resetting PRAM and SMC, and also tried installing drivers given here, but none of them worked. Rebooting didn't help, and I don't have Android file transfer installed (I've uninstalled it couple of days ago), which I saw people saying that uninstalling that helps fix the problem.\nWhat should I do?\nthanks\n\n\nA: For reasons best known to itself, Apple chose not to include updated drivers for the A1277 adapter when it released Mavericks. In the screenshot you provided, the 'Product ID: 0x1402' in reference to your adapter reveals it was manufactured by ASIX Electronics, and further indicates that ASIX designates it internally as a model AX88772C. (This information comes from the massive OUI database of model and vendor codes maintained by the IEEE.)\nHappily enough, even though Apple no longer continues to support the product, ASIX does. Their current driver version (2.2.0) for the A1277 / AX88772C includes support not only for Mavericks, but for Yosemite as well.\nYou will find the link to download \"Apple Mac OS X 10.5 to 10.10 Drivers Installer\" as the first entry in the list of driver downloads on this page of the ASIX site:\nhttp://www.asix.com.tw/download.php?sub=driverdetail&PItemID=136\n\nA: Apple recommends following\nConnect the USB Ethernet adapter before you power on your computer.\nIf you have reached a step in Setup Assistant where the Ethernet options are grayed out or not displayed, follow these steps:\nPress Command-Q.\nClick Shut Down.\nConnect the USB Ethernet adapter to the computer.\nStart up the computer.\nComplete Setup Assistant.\n\nBut since you have a newer model with Thunerbolt the USB-Ethernet wont work. I would suggest the Thuderbolt-Ethernet adapter.\n\nA: I had a similar problem, I would see the Device in the Network Settings but it would be unable to put a link up (switch lets off) or get an IP. \nI tried using DHCP with manual address which fixed the issue. The interface went up and it picked up the gateway and DNS correctly over DHCP.\nSo I suspect my DHCP server is behaving funny and the Apple USB Adapter is doing the same since I had to spend two hours tried to figure what's wrong, I almost did a restore of my laptop which would have been a pain with getting everything back up.\n\nA: This worked for me. The A1277 corresponds to the ASIX AX88772. \n1. Download the driver from there website http://www.asix.com.tw/download.php?sub=driverdetail&PItemID=105\nIMPORTANT!\n2.

Correct any errors and restart apache again.\nThird, check the permissions on your /Users/me/test directory. Chmod the permissions on that directory to 775 or even 777 to see if that helps.\n\nA: I've updated to Mavericks from Snow Leopard and my apache gave me hard time right away. After banging my head for two straight nights, reading everything about configuring Apache under Mavericks and seeing no progress on it whatsoever – I've been having \"It works\" message for every virtual host which was previously configured with SL and at some point even that stopped working – I've found that if you swap your old httpd.conf-previous with the newly generated httpd.conf, you should comment out LoadModule bonjour_module     libexec/apache2/mod_bonjour.so, too. apachectl start (or restart) doesn't throw any errors, but it actually doesn't like this module at all. So comment this one line out.\nI guess, the lesson is to triple-check every directive in the config. And bang your head less, too. ;/\n", "Q: How to change shape defaults in keynote? I'm using Keynote 6.2. Is there a way to change the default properties of shape objects? Specifically, I'd like to get rid of the drop shadow and the advanced color fill. It's a pain to have to change it manually every time I create a new shape.\nI figured out that I can create a shape, change the style and go to Format | Advanced | Create shape style, then I can delete all the default styles by right clicking, so only my styles show. The problem is that when I create a new presentation, my custom styles disappear and the defaults come back. Is there any way to make them permanent?\nAlso, can I change the default text size and font?\n\nA: Yes that is possible - you need to exchange the template file within Keynote.\nFirst, save the presentation you want to use as a the new template with a .kth extension. Keynote will not directly let you do that, so you need to rename the file in Finder.\nWithin the Keynote.app package, find the folder Contents / Shared Support / Templates.

It told me to do echo export PATH='/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile. However this wasn't having any affect, and I thought maybe it was because of echo (I don't know any Bash), so I removed the Echo, ran brew doctor and it spat this out, which concerned me:\n/usr/local/bin/brew: line 2: dirname: command not found\n/usr/local/bin/brew: line 5: basename: command not found\n/usr/local/bin/brew: line 8: readlink: command not found\n/usr/local/bin/brew: line 16: cd: /Users/howard/../Library: No such file or directory\n/usr/local/bin/brew: line 23: tr: command not found\n/usr/local/bin/brew: line 23: uname: command not found\n/usr/local/bin/brew: line 28: exec: ruby: not found\n\nIs there any way to undo what I just did? Also, can someone please explain to me what I just did? I am never going to make the stupid mistake of copying and pasting commands I don't understand. I feel like a total moron right now. \nI worry that I may have overriden /usr/bin/ with stuff? I can't run most of the basic commands like man, ls, and a few others. cd still works though. Is there any hope for me, or do I need to reinstall my OS?\n\nA: You certainly don't need to reinstall - just remove the offending last line of the file and restart terminal to see the effects.\nIf you don't know how to edit the file from terminal, you can open the file in your system's default plain text editor:\n/usr/bin/open ~/.bash_profile\n\nJust delete the last line and save the file. (The >> tacks the output of the echo on to the end of the file)  At that point, quit terminal, reopen terminal and test brew doctor again.\nApple has an overview of editors you can use in terminal if you want to edit files more regularly.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4850\nFor beginners, the nano editor is perhaps the easiest since it has visible help for basic commands. You can get some more guided help on nano from the web by opening the URL in your preferred browser (or having terminal do that for you open http://www.nano-editor.org/).\n\nA: You say that you ran the following command:\necho export PATH='/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile\n\nThis would have appended the line export PATH='/usr/local/bin:$PATH' to your .bash_profile. However, you then ran the line without the echo.\nThis would have broken your path, but only for the session that you're in. The \">> ~/.bash_profile\" would have had no effect since there is no output of that command.\n\nSimply close the Terminal window and open a new one. Running export just changed the PATH for your current shell. A new shell will source the relevant files again for you, setting the path correctly, providing the line that you added to your profile with the echo is removed (see bmike's answer).\n\nA: You didn't see any effect because you should have restarted terminal or alternatively\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n\nTo make the changes into effect. Addings paths into the .bash_profile file is sort of like adding shortcuts into the desktop, except these are shortcuts for the terminal, i.e. you tell it where stuff is.\n\nA: The correct environment configuration in .bash_profile file should be like this:\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\"\n\nand not:\nexport PATH='/usr/local/bin:$PATH'\n\nsee this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why does my brew installation not work?\nSo the correct step to config the brew environment variable on your Mac is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*The correct command is:\necho 'export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bash_profile\n\n*Now we need to activate your changes. Type this command to activate:\nsource .bash_profile\nOr you can use this command to open the file:\n/usr/bin/open ~/.bash_profile\nand then fix it to the correct text and then save and quit, the path should use \" \".\n\n*Don't forget to activate your changes also. Still this command:\nsource .bash_profile\n", "Q: MacBook Pro won't boot, or boots slowly I have a MacBookPro OS X 10.7.5 from 2011. When trying to boot it has a slow startup or login, with numerious spinning wheels. Sometimes after a long time I can sign into the computer and sometimes it just fails to startup or login.\nIt became more serious recently as I think I might have let my battery run out. Once it did boot and I also tried to download the operating system to reinstall it but it allways stops around 1.4 GB out of 1.7 then the wheel spinning started again.\nNow it wont boot at all, so I tried to boot in in safe mode. After the shift key it took about a half hour until the time bar at the bottom filled up, and when it did the screen went black. When it hit the start button it went back to the safe startup screen with the gray apple, spinning wheel and bar filling up at the bottom.\n\nA: The \"invalid node structure\" and \"disk I/O\" errors you see in verbose mode are both indicative of a failing hard drive.\nThe invalid node structure points to a problem with the data cataloging mechanism of the operating system, basically that system that keeps track of where all the data is stored.  One off reports of this aren't so bad but coupled with the issues you're seeing and the other error message I imagine it's a result of a failing drive.\nThe Disk I/O error pops up when the hard drive is inaccessible, either for a split second or several minutes.  This can usually be attributed to any of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*SATA port on the logic board going bad (not very likely)\n\n*Hard drive cable going bad (somewhat likely)\n\n*The hard drive itself failing or starting to fail (much more likely)\n\n\nBecause the disk is temporarily unavailable you often see system corruption (such as the invalid node structure error above) occur as a result.\nSo, what to do from here...\n\n\n*\n\n*Definitely don't try to install a new operating system.  The process of doing so is one of the most taxing procedures a hard drive is likely to go through in normal use, on a failing drive it can stress it to the point of complete failure.\n\n*Backup your data if you haven't already.  If your Mac does manage to boot again I would strongly encourage you to copy whatever important data you might have (pictures, documents, etc) to a thumb drive or external hard drive.  If you're unable to do this then I would recommend checking with local AASPs (see two paragraphs down) to see about data recovery options.\n\n*Repair.  Depending on your comfort level working with computers you might attempt to repair your Mac yourself.  As I mentioned, the hard drive is the most likely culprit, iFixit has a guide that walks you through the process - MacBook Pro hard drive replacement. Almost any 2.5\" SATA hard drive will work as a replacement.\n\n*If you prefer to have someone else repair it you can find Apple Authorized Service Providers (AASPs) and Apple retail stores using Apple's locate tool.  If your Mac is under warranty (you can check with this tool) then the repair would likely be covered by both Apple and/or an AASP so long as it wasn't a result of accidental damage.  If it's not covered then I would get a quote from each shop.\n\n\nHopefully that helps or at the very least gets you started.\n\nA: The above answer is wrong.   I have repaired many disks with this error and they are all still running  (and smart reporting as fine) years later. \nTry this, in order to fix it (I posted this to the apple forums a couple years ago and I am still getting emails from people thanking me, so we know it works).  \nInvalid Node Structure is not a hardware failure, it never was (you may still have a hardware failure, but the Invalid Node error is not indicative of this problem. \nStill, Disk utility will certainly fail to fix it, and DiskWarrior will probably fail too.  \nBut don't despair.  Try this, and don't give up till you've tried it at least three times.\nFirst, get the name of the partition of the failing volume.   You can get it most easily by finding your disk in Disk Utility, selecting your partition (not the drive) and type cmd-i.    Look for \"Disk Identifier\" right at the top.\nThen,  open up Terminal, and type this:\nsudo /sbin/fsck_hfs -yprd /dev/disk5s2  \n\nsubstituting your disk identifier for the one already here.   Keep the /dev/ part.   Enter your password, and wait.  It may take a while.  I have had this fail several times before finally working so its important to keep trying.   It's faster than a reformat!!!\nIf the afflicted disk is your startup disk, you will need to do this in recovery mode: restart the computer, hold down option, and wait for the disk options to appear.   Select that, then proceed to Disk Utility and then Terminal as described above.  \nGood luck, and always keep a backup!\n", "Q: How to monitor the network usage of specific apps on iOS? I am currently helping someone who has experienced large amounts of data being transferred over her DSL connection. After long research (via IRC support) I found out that her iPhone is obviously sending lots of data, i.e. several hundred kbyte/s, as soon as she connects it to her home network. The iPhone itself seems to work fine.\nTo find the culprit responsible for these huge amounts of data I would probably need to find a way to measure how much data all connected applications are sending within a specific interval.\nAs I do not use an Apple mobile device myself I am not familiar with iOS. Are there any possibilities to get information about the network usage of specific apps, either natively or with the help of a third-party application that is for free or at least offers a free trial version?\n\nA: You can do this with Onavo Count\n\nOnavo Count monitors and analyzes all types of mobile data and phone use. This includes background, foreground, and Wi-Fi use.\n\n\n\nA: iOS can do this natively under network usage.

I need to indicate a right file path to read a .csv file into R on OS X, but how can I find where the file is stored? Looking at Excel files, the file path starts at users/…, but there is no indication of a disk or something.\n\nA: There's no disk letter in OS X unlike Windows.\nThe mount point for disks is usually /Volumes. For example, files on a flash drive with the name FLASHDRIVE will be located in /Volumes/FLASHDRIVE/.\nThe startup disk is the root, /. Therefore, the Users folder is /Users.

I have a Nexus 4 charger (the block with the USB port on it) lying around. Can I use it to charge my iPhone 4s? Is it going to cause any trouble?\n\nA: Because USB is a standard of 5V at 100mA increments, the charge should work without any problem.  Some chargers sadly prevent themselves from working unless you use their device with their charger.

I also cannot switch back to it with command tab.\nWhat I want is to be able to full screen all windows in all apps, and still be able to switch between apps and windows with the keyboard. How can I do this?\n\nA: A bonus method if you want to do this entirely with trackpad instead: I forgot to mention that HyperSwitch also adds this functionality into the mac's built in CMD+Tab app switcher.\n\nYou need to enable the setting in HyperSwitch to display window previews on the app switcher.\n\nAgain, using BetterTouchTool, I used a trackpad gesture to trigger the application switcher.

I play Minecraft like many gamers and I am trying to make a profile where I can read the enchanting table language and I cannot get it to work.

It does indeed go to the desktop, but it still remains in the trash (OSX Mavericks). lion,etc once dragged out, it immediately left the trash.\n\nA: I am really not sure what your setup is, so my answer is pure guessing.\nSo it happened before when I was using ParagonNTFS to delete some files from NTFS filesystem. What you need to do is boot into your Windows (BootCamp), use its built-in partition repair tool to repair the partition. Then uninstall ParagonNTFS because it will damage your NTFS partition!\n\nA: Would need to confirm this with your specific setup, but I suspect this is due to multiple drives or partitions. Whenever you move a file to a different partition it triggers a copy, not a move.\nEach drive or partition has its own trash.\nIf you have an item on one drive, then move it to the trash, and then move it from the trash to a second drive, you're really triggering a copy of the file to the new drive.\nYou can see the individual trash folders at the root of each partition, called .Trashes, inside which will be a folder for each user (UID) on the system.\nI just tested this theory on my Mavericks (10.9.2) system, and this is the current behaviour.\n", "Q: How to play MP3s on iPhone 5s without iTunes? I just switched from an Android to an iPhone for the first time, so I am learning. I have a ton of MP3s I want to have on my phone. \nI used my computer and put them all in Dropbox and it works fine except, it only plays one song at a time and after each one I have to go back in and select another. \nI need something that will play continuously preferably shuffled, until I stop them.\nSuggestions on how to do this either with Dropbox or another app?\n\nA: Contrary to the other answer, the current version of dropbox supports playback of MP3 files. Starring a file, i.e. marking it as a favorite, will download it to your device and make it available offline, so you will be able to listen to it without an Internet connection. Mega also supports playing MP3 audio on IOS and offers a bit more free space than dropbox.\nWhat you won't be able to do is have your MP3 files appear in the Music app.\nAs for playlists and playing more than a single file at a time you'll need a third-party cloud streaming app, such as CloudBeats (paid, supports other cloud storage services besides dropbox) which worked for me but I didn't like it enough to want to buy it. There are also other apps in the appstore if you search for \"streaming player\" In any case, imo, this is not the way to go. I choose to stream all my music collection via Google Music - works equally well on IOS, Android or a desktop web browser.\nThis lifehacker article has a review of audio streaming solutions.\n\nA: You cannot do this from the Dropbox app. Neither can you transfer music from your Dropbox account into the Music app directly (without getting them to a computer, adding to iTunes and syncing the music to the iPhone).\nYou can play songs from your Dropbox account using other apps. Search for \"dropbox music player ios\" on the web to find some of these apps. Tunebox, BoxyTunes and DropTunes are a few (paid) apps that can do this.\n\nA: You could try Tiny Player (author here; app is free). It lets you load MP3 into your phone over WiFi from a browser or a small companion Mac app.\n", "Q: Use Built-In Microphone as Input and EarPods as Output I am trying to record singing in Logic Pro X.

I know the product can handle the higher values of the iPad charger, but I need to know if there's any real limit.\n\nA: Voltage does matter, it must be =<5V.  You can use a simple voltage regulator to keep yourself from going over.  You can also wire the panels so that they don't go over 5 (if each panel does 1.5V, 3 panels get you 4.5V, which will work but be slower. \nSo the 4 panels will give 6 Volt and the 5 Volt Zener diode will cut off the access 1  volt\nWattage is based on Voltage and Amperage.  The iPad can use up to 2.1 Amps.  Solar panels will always make the same voltage, but the more sunlight the more available amps.  You do not have to do anything to limit the amperage as the iPad will not pull more amperage than it needs.  This is the same way a flashlight works, a battery could dump all of it's power at once, like a capacitor, but the lightbulb doesn't need or want all that, so it draws only small amounts at a time.  This is also why a charged capacitor, which is designed to release current very flash like in a camera's flash, can also power an LED for a relatively longer time. \n\nA: Yes, you need to be reasonably close to the 5v spec and supply at least 500 milliamps (directly via USB), or ~12w via the iPad charger but that will give losses on the DC-AC-DC conversion.\nThere is a protocol to inform the iPad over USB that it can draw more than 500ma, but in practice it isn't required. Only the iPad 3 is insufferably slow to charge that way.\n", "Q: Has anyone seen this weird floating light in iTunes before? I connected my iPhone to my computer, and iTunes opened up as it always does. However, I got this weird video playing in the window. I have no videos on my phone or in my iTunes library.

Hold down Command and press T to turn it off.\n", "Q: Does the iPad draw more current when charging? I seem to be able to charge my iPhone 5 on a variety of USB chargers (car ones included). My iPad retina (iPad 4) seems to be very fussy about which chargers it will actually charge up on. (The charging icon will come on, but the charge won't increase even after two hours). \nMy question is, what causes this? Does the iPad draw more current when charging?\n\nA: The recommended power for an iPad charger is 12W.\nThe power of the iPhone charger is 5W.\nSo you should get the iPad charger to charge your iPad.\n\nA: The iPad, having a bigger battery, is designed to pull up to 2.1 Amps at 5V.  Most chargers are designed to be 5V at a max of 500mA.  That 500mA is divided into both charging the iPad and running it at the same time.  If you have the iPad on and doing stuff, most of the power being supplied is going to running, which will make charging take forever.

Yesterday I was facing a problem that Boot Camp Assistant was stuck on copying Windows files but that problem is solved now. After that copying files Boot Camp Assistant is showing that it is \"Downloading Windows support software\". I have already downloaded this Windows support software on my MacBook, therefore is there any way to skip this process?\nUnticking the option is grayed out unfortunately.\n\n\nA: If you are creating a Windows install disk then you can't unselect the option to download the Windows support software. Boot Camp Assistant, whilst creating the boot disk, will copy the relevant support software into the install media. This process requires a copy of the Windows support software which it will download from the internet.\nThere is currently no way to use your own copy of the support software if you create a boot disk. If you already have the boot disk, you can just select the option to install Windows, in which case you can use your own copy of the Windows support software.\n\nA: first download Boot camp software from https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1635?locale=en_US then start boot camp and create or check the first option \"create a Window 7 or later version install disk\" then at the end it will say \"can't connect to internet to download the support software\" so just close the Boot camp app then open the flash drive that the boot camp created a bootable windows os (there should be a windows installation files in it) and then unzip the boot camp file that you just downloaded and copy all the content in to the flash drive. At last open Boot Camp and check only the the third option that is \"install Window 7 or later version\" and continue from this point. After installing Windows, install Mac drivers and other support software for Windows. The support software installs Boot Camp drivers to support your Mac hardware, including AirPort devices, the built-in camera, the Apple Remote, the trackpad on a portable Mac, and the function keys on an Apple keyboard. The software also installs the Boot Camp control panel for Windows and the Apple Boot Camp system tray item.\nI hope it works for you.\n", "Q: Create Keynote presentation automatically At the introduction of Keynote in 2003 they said that Keynote presentations would be a XML-based open file format and so, keynote presentations could be created programmatically by 3rd party applications.\nIs this still possible in Keynote 6.2?\n\nA: Until Keynote 6, this was true.

I always knew that there wouldn't be enough storage space for me at 250GB however always planned to upgrade with external storage and eventually replace the hard drive with a larger one. The time has come and now I am deciding on the most cost effective, most stable SSD to replace my original one with. I ideally would like to spend around £150 to £200 and want at least 500GB.\n\nA: Changing a SSD for a larger one is usually pretty easy. I have done it myself via a kit OWC (macsales.com) sells. We also use cruical.com at work and buy SSDs from them. As for brands and make/model... I've always shopped price as HD/SSD are all made by about 5-6 companies and all are good and should work with any Mac that supports SATA.\nYou will find good instructions at ifixit.com so you know what you are in for (you may possibly need some specialized \"screwdrivers.\" That guide will tell you.\nHowever as you seem to be in the UK I am unsure if these places sell overseas and/or will be price competitive with a reseller in the UK.\nRegardless iFixit is a great resource and will help regardless of where you get the drive.\n", "Q: Track last known location of iPad mini (2) without \"Find My Phone\" I recently seem to have lost my iPad mini. I had expected Apple to have some functionality for lost devices enabled by default, but I notice that I cannot use Find My Phone via the iCloud interface, as I had not enabled the service myself.\nI am wondering whether I could somehow retrieve my GPS location history, though, so I can at least find out in what country I have lost it (I was travelling form Switzerland to Germany, and if my iPad made it with me to Germany, it should have reconnected to the network there). This used to be possible with Android devices over Google Latitude. Is it somehow possible for Apple devices?\nAlso, is there any way I can block my iPad? Or any other location/blocking functionality which I can use at this point?  \n\nA: If you have not set up any tracking service, then you will not be able to track the device. The device does not save its location history to the cloud without such a service being set up.\nIf your iPad had a SIM card, you can able to talk to the provider who may be able to tell you where the device is — not as accurate as GPS but will give you an idea of the country at the very least.\nYou're not going to be able to 'block' the iPad either since you haven't activated Find my iPhone, but the SIM card provider can block the SIM card.\n", "Q: Is there a better way to search the menus?

This way you can search the command in the Spotlight like behavior (while providing you with all the visible shortcuts). In fact, you can use Command+<Number Key> to quickly choose the command from search result.\n\nI’ve actually written the similar post before, but using another workflow called Menu Bar Search, these days I use Key Clue as my primary workflow to search menu bar items.\nP.S. Alfred has a built-in feature to search Safari bookmarks, but you can also develop the Key Clue workflow further to include Safari browsing history/bookmarks.\n\nA: For Quicksilver users—exactly what I was looking for.\nHere is an (old) Gigaom post about it.\nIt can be activated with a trigger key (mine is Option-Space) and then you can just type the menu item’s name in.\n\nYou can install the plugin in Quicksilver’s plugins pane.\nThanks to sayzlim, I found it through an Alfred Forums link in his blog post.\n* Quicksilver is a search application much like Alfred but FOSS.

I want to have zero margin in my document, but there is no way I can't move it.

I can not move the blue tip (see image)\nWhere am I supposed to move that tip to the left? Right now is 'blocked'.\n\nHere is another picture to show what is going on...\n\n\nA: There is an additional set of margins in a Pages document.\nI exported a document to Pages '09 and opened it with the old version.  In the Layout Inspector, I found the \"Layout Margins\". The \"Left\" and \"Before\" margins were non-zero and the numbers matched the unwanted margins I saw in Pages 5.2.  Here's a sample:\n\nI changed those layout margins to 0, saved the Pages '09 document, and opened it in Pages 5.2.  Hurrah!  The unwanted margins are gone!\nIf there's a UI control to view or change the Layout Margins in Pages 5.2, I haven't found it.\nUpdate: BigCaseyDog's answer describes the Document Margins, which are available in Pages 5.2 as well as Pages '09.  In Pages '09, the Layout Margins are available in addition to the Document Margins.  The Pages 5.2 templates -- at least some of them -- are built with non-zero Layout Margins, but Pages 5.2 doesn't seem to give us a way to change the Layout Margins.\n\nA: In the most recent version of Pages, you can adjust the margins similarly as previously mentioned, but it's in a slightly different place. Click the Document button in the top left corner of the window, then look under Document Margins in the inspector that appears. You should be able to adjust all of those to zero to get rid of the margins (if you want to get rid of the upper and lower margins, you'll have to uncheck the boxes for Header and Footer right above the Document Margins section). Hope that helps.\n", "Q: Why doesn't Apple ship and support FOSS drivers for NTFS write capabilities? Is there a reason Apple does not allow for NTFS write support, even when Linux (free, open source) solutions can? Why don't they just utilize those existing solutions to support read and write for NTFS or other alternative file systems?\n\nA: I certainly don't speak for Apple, but to me a simple reason is that any code that Apple ships is installed across the globe and the code could have vulnerabilities, bugs or worse in it. Even perfect code has support costs associated with integration and end user support. Unless you want to pick a specific library, let's assume the popular OSS packages are no more or less buggy than OS X at this point to a first approximation.\nThere is a cost to even including the work even assuming no effort is made to test or support it. Apple provides free support to anyone at the genius bar, so there is a real business and opportunity cost for Apple shipping product that causes end users trouble. There also is a cost to train support personal to explain that OS X only ships with NTFS read support, but my estimate is that is trivial compared to what it would cost to even integrate the NTFS code let alone support it once it ships.\nApple doesn't go out of it's way to prevent users that want alternative filesystem code to run, but I can see many reasons why they don't incorporate even more open-source code then they do already on the ZFS/NTFS/extfs front.\n\nA: Microsoft changes NTFS in whatever way they like because it is their filesystem. The only way to be certain that you handle all edge cases, new features, and have little to no risk of corruption is by licensing the driver directly from them (if they would even offer such a license). \nRemember: NTFS is far more advanced than HFS+. For example, it supports filesystem transactions with rollback (not just simple journaling), encryption per-file, compression per-file, and reparse points (which allow plugins to hook a file/folder to provide custom behavior). It also supports volume shadow copy, which is essentially a time-machine like snapshot view of the filesystem as it existed in the past, except not using hacks.\nCan you truly be sure that the volunteers working on the open-source NTFS driver fully understand how to mount the filesystem when it has pending non-commited transactions in the log?\nWhat happens when someone re-mounts the disk on a Windows system and the NTFS driver didn't use copy-on-write to preserve the volume shadow copy snapshots? Or worse, accidentally modified old snapshots, silently corrupting history?\nApple doesn't ship with write support enabled because they don't want to be responsible for some bug destroying people's data. \n", "Q: When I changed permissions on an NTFS drive, all files are hidden in Finder. How do I make them visible again? I have a Seagate external hard drive which is formatted in NTFS. The hard drive came with this Paragon NTFS driver. It works great, but when I clicked \"Apply Permissions to Enclosed Items\" in the sharing preferences panel (shown below for clarity), all the files on that drive are now invisible in finder. This happens no matter what I select for the permissions.\nI know the files are all there, since lsing in the terminal shows them, but they just don't appear in the finder. Also, all the directories on the drive do appear, so only single files are affected.\nI'd rather not reformat to HFS+ since this drive is sometimes used by Windows computers. Is there something else I can try?\n\n\nA: Open Terminal and type: defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true; killall Finder.

So I send a response, but instead of sending it just to the other people in the group, it also send it to me?  Then when I read through the group messages, I duplicates and it gets confusing.\n\nA: Several things can cause this.  I would need more information to give you an accurate answer. If you are using iMessage it could be that a number or email in the group is somehow associated with your contact information.  Go to Settings>Msessages and make sure that only one phone number and AppleID is linked to your account. Check the group and make sure you only see your email or your phone number in the list, not both.\nIf it's SMS contact your carrier as that is controlled by the carrier programing. \n", "Q: Airplay stopped working All of a sudden none of my ios devices are able to connect to the Apple TV via Airplay.

It actually works perfectly but I can't for the damned of me figure out how to communicate with it.\nOn the MFG website they pretty much stopped supporting it after Windows 2000 and the documentation refers to setting up a CPX port which is a term I have never seen before and can not find any further information online after searching Google extensively.\nTo make matters more complicated I'm attempting to communicate with it on a Mac using the native OSX or I have VMware partitions setup with Windows 7 and Ubuntu.

MacBook Air \"only\" has a Thunderbolt Connector.\nBut if you have one Thunderbolt port you can probably plug anything into that because of the flexibility. But it is also very expensive.\nI also like the handling of Music Interfaces in mac OS X. It is very easy to extend the system regarding audio-stuff that has USB. Most Macs \"just work\" with them.\nAlso you have a large Software Library for Professional Music Production. Including the free GarageBand package. And the Apple \"Logic Studio\"\nMost people like the MacBook Pro because (I think) it is the easiest and most stable to work with on Music and Audio.\nIf you want to buy a MacBook, I would recommend either a low budget MacBook Pro 13\" or 15\", or the 13\" MacBook Air. It's depending on what exactly you try to produce.\nFor most Musicians the 15\" MacBook Pro is the way to go, because of it's great Power. You don't have to care about that any more.\nThe SOundCard inside the MacBook is pretty stable to hande a lot of tracks at the same time, but if you want a workstation (with many interfaces and mixers), have a look at existing MacPro setups from the past years (not the new trash-can macPro).\nI would also recommend researching on YouTube for \"room Tours\" or \"Setup Tours\" of People who produce Music.\n", "Q: icloud- use with different apple id I have an iPad retina display (4th gen) and my mom has iPhone 5S.

Then you can create a shared photostream by going to the Photos app and tapping the + button in the Shared tab.  \nThe only disadvantage of this solution is that you have to add new photos to the shared stream by yourself.

Some say Windows users tend to shut down but that it is not necessary, and I tend to do that too.\nOthers say it is preferable to shut down, as it does not take too much time to boot anyway, and that in this way the battery is protected. While others say that it is in fact better not to shut down to often, including for the battery, etc.\nAn interesting opinion - cannot find the link for that now - was that shutting down / restarting serves no purpose for Macs, except when that is needed after installing or upgrading applications or the system, unlike in Windows, where shutting down was (is?) very important. Also, that Macs do periodical system maintenance work during operation and even sleep, which eliminates the need for restart; possibly restarting would even come against all this, etc., and \"not shutting down\" is in fact a typical differentiating Mac feature. Is this true?\nI need a competent opinion on this - not just a description of the most common use - preferably reflecting some advice from the manufacturer.\nI have a Macbook Air.\n\n\nUpdate after answer:\nAlthough I got a good answer, a crucial point in it (that the system has to be shut down, but only from time to time) is not yet clear: how often should I shut down the system. So, I will bring my question down to this formula.\nAs pointed out by that answer, my question cannot be answered in relation to a tangible benefit for the system, but rather in relation to the battery life. So, I guess this last point can be answered by some information on how how is battery life dependent on how often the system is shut down.\n\nA: I do not claim to provide an answer  - as much as a step-by-step clarification of the question (by re-edits), which in the end might sum up to an answer.\n\nI see here the idea that: waiting for an OS X Update or Security Update is generally a sufficient time between reboots. Also, that shutting down is useful, because system temp, memory, swap, and cache files get cleared out during boot. But how useful is that it's not very clear.\n\nI appreciate a lot this answer which states clearly some important ideas that sum up to what I was looking for:\n\n\n*\n\n*for MacBook models, we should decide whether to shut down or enter sleep state by focusing on which method can keep the battery healthy. Healthy in the way the battery can maintain a maximum capacity in its lifespan.\n\n*MacBook models use Lithium-ion polymer batteries which requires low level discharge to get the maximum usage. -- The shorter the discharge (low DoD), the longer the battery will last. If at all possible, avoid full discharges and charge the battery more often between uses.\n\n*For the maximum battery health, you should use your MacBook Air at least until the it depletes to ±60% level before you keep it plugged in again\n\n*If you don’t plan on using your notebook for more than six months, Apple recommends that you store the battery with a 50% charge.\n\nA: Whether to shut down or keeping it in sleep state (by closing the lid) depends on the time usage in between. The short answer is:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you use it daily, enter sleep mode is recommended.\n\n*If you rarely use it, shut it down.\n\n\nSo let‘s see the difference between each option.\nWe’ll start with this statement:\n\nAn interesting opinion - cannot find the link for that now - was that shutting down / restarting serves no purpose for macs, except when that is needed after installing or upgrading applications or the system, unlike in Windows, where shutting down was (is?) very important. Also, that macs do periodical system maintenance work during operation and even sleep, which eliminates the need for restart; possibly restarting would even come against all this, etc., and \"not shutting down\" is in fact a typical differentiating Mac feature. Is this true?\n\nIt’s true that OS X has a periodical maintenance script that runs daily, weekly, and monthly. Each script has  a different purpose to remove logs, rebuild whatis database, and bunch of maintenances on user levels. I can say that it doesn’t affect our day to day usage. It’s more like system maintenance to clean up and sort logs.\nIn fact, for MacBook models, we should decide whether to shut down or enter sleep state by focusing on which method can keep the battery healthy. Healthy in the way the battery can maintain a maximum capacity in its lifespan.\nMost of the MacBook models use Lithium-ion polymer batteries which requires low level discharge to get the maximum usage. Based on the explanation by Battery University:\n\nSimilar to a mechanical device that wears out faster with heavy use, so also does the depth of discharge (DoD) determine the cycle count. The shorter the discharge (low DoD), the longer the battery will last. If at all possible, avoid full discharges and charge the battery more often between uses. Partial discharge on Li-ion is fine; there is no memory and the battery does not need periodic full discharge cycles to prolong life, other than to calibrate the fuel gauge on a smart battery once in a while\n\nFor the maximum battery health, you should use your MacBook Air at least until the it depletes to ±60% level before you keep it plugged in again.\nIt‘s okay to just close the lid without harming your MacBook. Beside, it can run the maintenance script on time.\nThe only time when you should consider shutting down is when you’re not going to use the MacBook for more than 36 hours. Apple recommends to discharge the battery around ±50% before shutting them down.\n\nIf you don’t plan on using your notebook for more than six months, Apple recommends that you store the battery with a 50% charge. If you store a battery when it’s fully discharged, it could fall into a deep discharge state, which renders it incapable of holding any charge. Conversely, if you store it fully charged for an extended period of time, the battery may experience some loss of battery capacity, meaning it will have a shorter life. Be sure to store your notebook and battery at the proper temperature. (See “Notebook Temperate Zone.”)\n\nI know I’ve emphasized too much on battery health in this answer, but instead of asking if shut down or sleep is better, the decision affects your battery health more than the performance of the operating system.\nFeedbacks and corrections are welcomed in the comment below.\n\nA: So in short, it's like your iPhone? :) I too am conflicted about this topic but I rarely shut down my macbook because I'm a forgetful person and I tend to forget something I should've done when the laptop was still awake. That's why it's convenient to just let it sleep because I can open it and it's immediately right at my home screen :)\n\nA: according to apple:\n\n\"Standard Maintenance\nFor proper maintenance of a lithium-based battery, it’s important to\n  keep the electrons in it moving occasionally. Apple does not\n  recommend leaving your portable plugged in all the time . An ideal\n  use would be a commuter who uses her notebook on the train, then plugs\n  it in at the office to charge. This keeps the battery juices flowing.\n  If on the other hand, you use a desktop computer at work, and save a\n  notebook for infrequent travel, Apple recommends charging and\n  discharging its battery at least once per month. Need a reminder? Add\n  an event to your desktop’s iCal. When your battery no longer holds\n  sufficient charge to meet your needs, you may choose to replace it. If\n  your notebook came with a built-in battery, you should have the\n  battery replaced only by an Apple Authorized Service Provider.\"\n\nSo basically you most SHOULD shut down when not using it for some time. You don't want the Macbook to be for a long time on and in sleep mode.\nleaving your Macbook both ON charge AND in sleep mode is bad on the battery.\nBeing merely in sleep is another matter, which is fine. \n\nA: I'm no expert at all, but I can tell you that I regularly keep my Mabook Pro 2008, MacBook Air 2012 and Mac Pro 2008 powered on / asleep for weeks if not months at a time without rebooting. When their charge drops to around 20%, I plug them in. The machines don't noticeably slow down over time like PCs do, so I only reboot if installing something, or if I experience a bunch of software crashes, which is pretty rare. They only get turned completely off if I'm going away for a few days or more.\nBasically I treat them like iOS devices - always on / ready, with very occasional reboots!\n\nA: I'm no expert either, but I know that if left on sleep/having the lid down but the power on can build up enough heat (if on long enough) to catch on fire.\niOS devices are different though, as they do not release heat.\nIf you need to charge the MacBook quickly, shut it off completely as this increases charging efficiency. \n\nA: Keep in mind that if you use FileVault, it only encrypts when it shuts down. Leaving your Mac turned on but sleeping or just shutting the laptop doesn't encrypt it.\n", "Q: OS X Mavericks scrollbars appear even without external mouse For about 2 weeks now are the scroll bars appearing permanently at my mac.

This file, when opened, then creates its dependencies, preferences files and such.\n\nA: In many cases, a Windows installer don't really do anything other then extracting the compressed files, and writing them to the destination. \nAnd then it creates a few shortcuts, and it might register itself to open files with specific extensions.\nThere is nothing magic about installing software in windows, and for much Windows software, you can in fact take the installed software directory and copy it directly to an other computer and run it there without doing a (re)install.\nSo it is mostly a difference between userinterfaces(Who is responsible for copying the files) not a difference between what really happens.\n\nA: Us Mac users ask the same question the other way: Why do you need an (un)installer for everything in Windows?\nThe majority of Mac programs are complete bundles - all their resources are in the Application's folder (right click on App icon -> Show Package Contents). So they will run from anywhere, there's a system variable that tells the code where it is. Often, an application can be run directly from the downloaded DMG and even from a remote server. Bit of a performance hit but it will work. User settings are in the user's library, there are also system routines to handle the mechanics.\nMacs have no central registry that requires setup (or maintenance) so nothing needs to go there either.\nIf you are developing Mac applications you should try very hard to not need an installer - only if you are installing shared libraries or shell-level services. In general, it's possible to do without.\nSince you are heading towards iOS programming I would suggest just not worrying about it. iOS rules will tell you where to save what, and it is NOT negotiable. Preferences go here, user data goes there. You will use the supplied APIs. Comply. Obey.\n", "Q: Where are my all installed programs? I am new to Mac OS X and till the time I was using Windows 7/8. I tried to download and install programs in Mac OS X, but I do not see them in Launchpad.\nWhere are all my programs are going. Secondly, what is path where software are actually installed in Mac?\n\nA: All software in Mac OS X is installed in /Applications, which can be found in the Finder sidebar\nMost Mac applications don't have to be installed, you just have to copy the applications in the Applications folder. Normally, all installed applications that are in the /Applications folder appear automatically in the Launchpad.  \nYou can uninstall applications that don't come from the Mac AppStore simply by moving them in the Trash, applications from the Mac AppStore can be uninstall by entering Launchpad, holding the option key and clicking the little x that appears at the app-icon.  \nThe location of the applications folder in the Finder:\n\n", "Q: Want to clean up contacts Years ago I thought I was going to be smart and import 6000 contacts to my database. Several mail systems and mail clients later, I would now like to clean this up down to about the 800-1000 that I actually need. \nI can identify the ones to delete because they have an address, but no phone or email. \nI am using google apps for business, mail & address book. \nI thought if I could just get everything in to a mail client that sorts contacts better, I could sort and manually delete. That would synch accross systems and voila - clean. Problem is I need to look for address with no email or phone number associated in a certain zip code. \nI made and archive of my contacts. What I am trying to avoid is exporting all, cleaning in excel, then deleting everything and re-importing all. \nTried thunderbird. no go. tried entourage, but it is not importing all my contacts. \n\nA: You could use Automator to filter the contacts according to that criteria. I haven't actually tried it, and I'm including a screenshot with some of the conditions I'd use just for reference. But still, this might help.\n", "Q: We share iCloud accounts on two devices, can both backup photos to iCloud? Can 2 devices back up each one's photos with same iCloud account into iCloud?\n\nA: Yes, iCloud backup will keep the backups of your Camera Roll separate.\nIf you mean Photo Stream, yes, the photos will be merged into a single Photo Stream.\n", "Q: Bootcamp with Ubuntu Linux Is it possible to use bootcamp to make bootable linux drives for you, or is there a similar boot manager for linux?\n\nA: Yes you can. Use Boot Camp Assistant normally to create the partition, then boot into your Linux install media and select the new BOOTCAMP partition as the destination for the install.\nThis will set the default boot disk as the Linux partition, forcing you to alt-boot to boot into OS X. To reverse this, change your startup disk in System Preferences.\n", "Q: Mouse Power Issue When I plug in a third party mouse into my iMac it does not get any power. I've tried the USB port on the keyboards and directly on the machine. I've tried two mice and one of them used to work (I used it for gaming).

Try to identify whether the problem comes from the mouse or the iMac : try to plug the mouse on another computer and connect something else to your computer.\nMy problem came from the usb port of my computer so I had to take it back to the apple store .. \nSorry I couldn't give you a way to solve your problem immediately.\n", "Q: how to stop iphoto from organising photos (physically relocating)? Many years ago I considered ditching picasa for iPhoto but stuck with it as I didn't want my pics being physically rearranged on the disk (Picasa is rightly okay with your pictures being where you want to store them)\nIs there a way to prevent iPhoto from doing this?\n\nA: Go to iPhoto → Preferences → Advanced  and uncheck Copy items to the iPhoto Library.\nNote that iPhoto will still copy files to its library if you import photos from an SD card, etc. Instead, copy them where you want first then import them.\nAlso, changing this setting on an existing library will not relocate media that has already been imported.

I have a MacBook Pro Early 2011 and the GPU has died. I want to switch to Integrated\nGraphics only until I get my Logic Board replaced.\nI've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*gfxcardstatus and I get this:\n\n\n*There is no External Display connected btw and I've never used one.\n\n*I moved /System/Library/Extensions/AMD* -> ~/DisabledExtensions/\n\n*I've tried Single User Mode and did the same thing as above.\n\n\nI really don't know what else to do. I want to know if there is a way\nto login to EFI/BIOS and disable it or anyway whatever it takes to just kill that\nannoying AMD that is making my screen blue and twitchy.\n\nA: you definitely should try this one:\nhttp://www.asyncro.com/2014/03/24/macbook-pro-discreate-graphics-card-issue-fix-updated/\n(that is still on archive.org: Macbook Pro Discreate Graphics Card Issue Fix Updated) \nI’m writing this reply from my until-now broken MacBook Pro 2011 dammed GPU piece of technology.\nYou'll get away working without the AMD GPU, which vs. having a dead USD$2k… paperweight isn't really a bad deal.\nAdditional Solution:\nI found that doing the above will let you login, but Mac OS would still try to use the discrete graphics card without the driver.  The result is that even though you can login, the graphics will be so slow that the machine is mostly unusable.\nThe second answer (the one that uses ArchLinux ISO to change the EFI variable) on this link solved my problem:\nMacBook Pro: How to disable discrete GPU permanently from EFI?\nMy Mac OS now boots up default to integrated graphics mode.\n\nA: You did right so far. But you have to move all ATI files from that folder as well. It will work after that, but the graphic will be slow.\nMake sure to boot in verbose mode (Cmd-S at startup).\nmount -uw /  (to be able to move System files)\nmv /System/Library/Extensions/ATI* /System/Library/DisabledExtensions/\n\nNote that the Folder DisabledExtensions needs to exist already.\nAddendum: It’s important to put that Intel3000.....kext file back!

So no more recovery mode boot or single user or pram resets or SMC. It was coming back everytime. \nBut the disadvantage was everytime it was switching gpu during normal use it was crashing the laptop and rebooting. I had previously noticed the Webex Application infact was switching to external gpu and thus causing the system to hung[Maverik] or now reboot in Yosemite. \nBut now atleast its not anymore doing this, once I have disabled the 2nd GPU. So atleast, now I can use its internal card completely and its not a $3500/- paperweight.\nAlso we do not need gfxcardstatus app once we disable the external card.\nBest of luck guys.\nsandocan\n\nA: I got into single user mode without much trickery, as my AMD card seems to work up to the point where the drivers are loaded, just with stripes across the screen. So I got to remove the drivers as described at asyncro. I rebuilt the kextcache (alternatively deleted it), but my Mac doesn't boot to internal graphics but uses the discrete graphics (according to gfxcardstatus), just totally slow and with what looks like 32 colors and pinstripes across the screen. As soon as I restore the drivers, it freezes at boot with a grey screen. Not sure what I am missing. \ngfxcardstatus 2.3 complains it can't switch to internal graphics because there is an external display connected (not true), 2.2.1 just doesn't work.\nI am on Yosemite 10.10.1\nI also have FileVault enabled, so I am seeing the broken discrete graphics right from the start when I am prompted for my password, long before any driver from hard dis can be loaded.\n\nA: Finally!!

Specifically, version 3.1, as that is the last version that would run on Leopard.\nHowever, the Apple developers download page does not provide any downloads for XCode tools for either Leopard or Snow Leopard.\nIs anyone aware of any workign mirrors, or ways I could obtain the toolchain? I could of course compile the various included tools from source, but that would probably take much more time than I was planning to spend on this project.\nOn a related note; I feel Apple should just keep the old versions online at the download center. It's terrible practice to simply stop making older versions available for download.\n\nA: Never. mind. Of course one ends up solving something like this right after posting on StackExchange.\nThis is simply a naming thing. Apple started calling their development tools \"command line tools\" starting from 10.7, which is why I could not find the old dev tools when I searched for this. 'Xcode 3.1 Developer Tools' is the name of the download. This question pointed me in the right direction.\n", "Q: Lost Ipod Touch 4 I lost my ipod touch.  I am not sure if the \"find my iphone\" app is on.  I see it in my icloud list of devices.  I initiated a lock and message.  If it is turned off, will the lock work and the message (phone number to call) show?  How can I tell if the lock is actually on and the message will appear?  It is not connected to the internet at this time.\n\nA: When the iPod is turned on and connected to the internet you will get a notification. You can read more about at support.apple.com. \nIt does have to connect to the internet to communicate the fact that you want it locked though. \n\nA: Most of the function in Find my iPhone requires network to work. So your iPod will NOT receive the message. If your iPod is on stand by and it is online you can use all function, but if it is Turned off(shut down), you can not control it.\n", "Q: How to restore lost contacts/address book? I suddenly have only 2 contacts in my Contacts! I have a MacBook Pro, am using OS 10.9.2. Following instructions from another answer, I looked for Address book folder in the library/App. Support folder and it is not there. So couldn't proceed.\nIn Time Machine yesterday it shows \"Address book Forwarder\". But I don't know what that means, but perhaps it had something to do with my loss? Does this mean I sent my address book somewhere? Looks like it!\nI don't know how to use Time Machine to restore my contacts. The restore button is grayed out. Nothing happens when I double click the Contacts folder there, so I don't know how to copy the content, nor where to paste it since I do not have that folder in the Library that you mention.\nI do not use iCloud. I do have files backed up on an external drive, but don't know how to use it.\nI know this sounds like a mess and it seems to be.\n\nA: If you use Time Machine, just open the Contacts app, and THEN go to Time Machine (Click on the menubar icon / Enter Time Machine)\n\n\nOnce there, you can \"travel in time\" to an older date and find the missing contact. This is where you select the contact and click \"Restore\".\n\n\nYou don't need to restore a folder or file, but the contact (in the Contacts app) itself.\n\nA: I also do not use iCloud.  My phone was so full (especially documents & data which seem impossible to delete without restoring the phone) that I ended up backing up my phone and restoring it to factory (with the new iOS8).  Anyway, since iTunes won't let me pick and choose what I want to restore from the backup, I lost all my contacts.\nI went to my phone, settings, iCloud and turned the on CONTACTS only and a few seconds later, all of my contacts appeared.  I'm not sure (because I have so many) if it's maybe from a prior life when I tried to use iCloud or where it came from but it looks like everyone's there.\nIt's very simple to try at least.

I imported my tennis couching videos to Aperture but Aperture shows them with odd lines while QuickTime Player more nicely shows them. Which software should I use for videos because Aperture is clearly not meant for this?\nAperture\n\n\n\nQuickTime Player\n\n\n\nP.s. I imported my videos from Sony Nex-3N.\n\nA: I just went with Final Cut Pro: stored the videos to external HDD and then viewed them there with FCP. Also VLC player as suggested may be an option. Yet FCP is also for editing, VLC for playing. For this purpose just for analysing the shots, FCP and VLC may be a bit off-topic but they can nicely show videos.\n\nA: Your video appears to have interlacing encoded by the source recorder. You can use HandBrake to remove interlacing while re-encoding. Aperture, btw, is photo editing and management software. It may play video, but there are players that are far better suited to video, such as QuickTime, or VLC. VLC, btw, is a defacto standard, and usually the answer to the question: \"what will play this odd video format I can't seem to view with any decoder I've tried?\" VLC has streaming and encoding functions as well. Final Cut Pro will of course play videos, but it is a video editing suite first, not \"also,\" which means it is rather heavy amount of software for such a light task as playing video.

I want to get 2TB HDD in addition to 512GB SDD I have.\nI want to be able to \"turn off\" that drive so that it stays off even after sleep cycles and everything... I'm worried because now when I have an external HDD and I eject it, it wakes up sometimes - for example just by launching Finder which accesses it... not sure, maybe it happens only after I wake computer form sleep, but still... I really don't want such behaviour in an internal HDD. It should stay \"dead\" until I resurrect it only when needed. Is this possible?\nI don't know why is this information so hard to find - nobody reported it, just guesses and partial solutions on forums... So anyone with such setup - can you try?\n\nA: I suggest to test and use:\n    Disk Arbitrator.\nThis is a small application interfacing the MacOS X disk access interface.\nThis application may be used in forensic investigation, to protect against unwanted connection of external disks, and to manage very straightforwardly any mounting and eject of internal or external disk\n(through the Show Disks Window menu entry).\nI wouldn't speak in place of the author, but I can ascertain this tool is working on: Lion, Mountain Lion, Mavericks & Yosemite.\nI haven't found any bug in this application, and I would be glad to give the same nul result with many application I have to survive with :(.\n\nA: It won't stay ejected. When you reboot it'll be reattached. You can, however, fix this. I had to tackle the same problem when my internal drive failed on my iMac. The key is to tell the OS, via /etc/fstab that you no longer want it to mount the drive.\nTo do this you'll need the UUID of the drive. You can get this from Disk Utility. With the UUID in hand you'll make an /etc/fastab entry by opening a terminal and typing:\n> sudo vim /etc/fstab\n\nAnd then putting the following in there:\n# Internal iMac HD that's dead\nUUID=1B39A092-75B2-357E-97FB-23C082975B80 none hfs ro,noauto\n\nReplacing the UUID in the above line with the UUID of your specific hard drive.\nHere is the specific block of text I kept in my /etc/fstab file until I replaced the drive: https://gist.github.com/ianchesal/7389200\nThat chunk references this question and answer: Prevent BootCamp partition from automatically mounting -- which is where I got this solution originally. It worked great to keep that bad drive out of the way until I could crack open the iMac and swap it out.\n\nA: Eject is only temporary, once restating the computer will read the disk again if it is still plugged in or you freshly plug it in.\nSo use the unmount in disk utility that is permanent till you mount it again.\nI forgot, also disable the Spotlight search for that disk, so it wont spin any more.\n\nA: We develop an app called Mountain. The app provides a feature to spin down an ejected internal disk after waking up from sleep again. Enabling \"Detach unmounted volumes on wake from sleep\" in the advanced preferences should do the job.\n\nYou can run the current beta version without limitations for a limited time.

I had connected it with an iphone 3 in the past, which wasn't mine. Is there any chance they can move into my system and any ideas on how to see that? \nThank you in advance\n\nA: There isn't a practical way for your iPad to be hacked and/or for the system to be moved into, at least without physical access or a jailbreak running. \nThey could, however, get your Apple ID password if it's not particularly strong or if you reuse the same password on multiple websites, and that can give them access to backups, your calendar, location via Find my iDevice, among other things. If you secure your Apple ID and you haven't jailbroken, then you'll be just fine.\nIt's highly unlikely that you'll ever have your system accessed because of Apple's review process for apps and the sandboxing requirements imposed on them.\n\nA: I am a hacker. As I know, if you have connected your iPad with a iPhone through iCloud with the same Apple ID, someone with your Apple ID can get all your information including password saved in safari/chrome and other details. But still, a hacker cannot \"move into your iPad\"  like remote control your iPad or delete all your data, there is no exploit for this available. The only evidence of someone \"hack\" into your iPad is to see if you lost any data or you got some mysterious email sent using your account.\nThe best way to avoid being \"hack\" is never tell others your password and often change your password. If you still think your iPad have been hacked, full restore your iPad and use a new Apple ID.\nExtra: A group of hacker have developed a technic that can hack your iOS device with a mod charger. So never use a charger that you don't recognise.\n", "Q: How to disable Time Machine for an external hard drive My wife has a MacBook Pro and two external hard drives; both of which currently contain a Time Machine backup of her MacBook Pro hard drive.\nNow she wants to \"turn off\" Time Machine for one of her two hard drives, so that she can backup the MacBook Pro hard drive and the other external hard drive onto it.\nIn addition to the Time Machine backup, there are also additional files on the hard drive, so she cannot reformat it unless she first copies the files she wants to keep to somewhere else.\nIs it possible to tell OS X \"Do not recognise this external hard drive for use with Time Machine any more\", so that it can be backed up using Time Machine? Currently, the external drive she wants to back up shows up in the \"Exclude these items from backups\"-list and cannot be removed, likely because it has been used as a Time Machine drive in the past.\nHow can she make it so that the one external hard drive (Drive A), can be backed up to the other external hard drive (Drive B), without reformatting it.\nI appreciate any help with this.\n\nA: Go to Time Machine preferences, Ctrl-click on the drive you want to disable, you get a fold out menu with the option to disable the drive.\n\nA: Turn off Time Machine with the switch in System Preferences, then remove the Backups.backupdb from drive A.\nTime Machine should recognise that the disk is no longer a Time Machine backup destination, but if it doesn't, delete .com.apple.timemachine.donotpresent from the root of the disk.\n", "Q: What does iTunes count as a \"skip\"? As the title says, how does iTunes decide what counts as a \"skip\" for the purposes of incrementing the skip count and setting the \"last skipped\" date?\nI've noticed that it only seems to count if I hit \"next track\" within the first few seconds of a song playing (but not before it starts, if it's being streamed using iTunes Match), but I haven't been able to find any specific details.\nFor bonus points, what counts as a \"play\"? There's a related question but it's asking about podcasts, which follow different rules than music.\n\nA: Let's start with the obvious.\nA song is considered played once the reproduction ends. It does not matter if you've listened to all of it or just skipped to the last second of the song, once the song automatically changes to the next one (or ends the reproduction list), the play count is incremented.\nNow, the less obvious: \nIf a song is skipped in it's first 10 seconds, the skip count is incremented. If the song is skipped when the are 10 seconds remaining for the song to end, the play count is incremented. If you skip the song in between, nor the skip nor the play count is incremented.\nThe skip can triggered by either using the left arrow key, pressing the fast forward key or just selecting a different song a hitting enter.\n", "Q: Automator command line: \"Unable to open workflow\" I created a workflow in Automator consisting of a single action, \"Convert Format of Word Documents\" (provided by Microsoft Word).

I have a 2009 IMac, which came with Mountain Lion. I've upgraded to 10.9.latest (Mavericks). Now, my imac has started freezing up all the time - I've tried reinstalling from the recovery partition but even that hangs, so I think I've got a hardware fault. How can I run the hardware test though? \nI've tried holding D down - that just gives me the standard recovery mode options (restore from time machine, disk utility etc). I've tried inserting the original Mountain lion dvd and booting it - no options there either.

Just the d key (without the option key) did not work.\n\nA: Instructions for using AHT:\n\nMac NoteBook and Desktop computers shipping with OS X 10.7 or later have a partition on the hard drive or flash storage that contains AHT. To start AHT on these computers please follow these instructions:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Press the power button to turn on your computer.\n  \n*Press and hold the D key before the gray startup screen appears.\n  \n*It takes a minute or so for AHT to start up and inspect your hardware configuration. While this is taking place, an icon appears on the screen:\n  \n  \n*When the process is complete, select your language and click the right arrow. If you aren't using a mouse, you can use the up and down arrows to select a language and then press the Return key.\n  \n*The AHT console appears. You can choose which sort of test or tests to perform:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*To perform all of the basic tests, click the Test button or press the \"T\" key or the Return key.\n  \n*To perform a more thorough diagnostic test, select the \"Perform extended testing\" checkbox under the Test button before you click the Test button.\n  \n  \n  \n  Note: Your test results will appear in the window in the bottom-right of the console.\nTo exit AHT, click Restart or Shut Down at the bottom of the window.\nSome Macintosh computers that shipped with OS X Lion and later support the use of Apple Hardware Test over the Internet. These computers will start up to an Internet-based version of AHT if the hard drive does not contain AHT.  An Internet-enabled connection via Ethernet or Wi-Fi is required to use this feature. Internet-based AHT functions the same as AHT on the hard drive or flash storage outlined above.\nThe Mac NoteBook and Desktop computers listed in Computers that can be upgraded to use OS X Internet Recovery will require a firmware in order to support the Internet version of AHT. Without this update you may see the behavior discussed in this article. \n\nHowever, it looks like you are doing the correct steps. If you aren't seeing the hardware test icon, then it might be that your AHT partition got removed somehow. Since you aren't seeing the \"Apple Hardware Test does not support this machine\" then it looks like the fix in that last paragraph won't work. \n", "Q: Is there a calendar app that supports email reminders?

I was trying to open one of them just to try and remember something. But for some reason my mac thinks they're zip files (even though I've used these same files on another mac before). \nIf I double click one of the .as files, Archive Utility opens, thinks for a second, then disappears and nothing happens. If I right click -> open with Text Edit, it opens and displays the correct file, but I don't want to use Text Edit. I want to view the file in XCode. When I right click -> open with XCode, it doesn't display the code in the file; it shows a little zip image with AS on it, and no text.\n\nI just noticed it's showing the file type as \"AppleSingle archive\". The only thing I can think is that that could be abbreviated \".as\" too. But why would it have worked on another computer (and presumably many other people's computers) and what can I do to fix it?\n\n\nA: Xcode doesn't support ActionScript files out of the box, so it sees your file and thinks it's an AppleSingle file instead, as does the rest of your Mac, since that's how OS X usually understands files with the .as extension by default.\nUnfortunately I couldn't find any information on getting Xcode to support ActionScript projects. There is this Stack Overflow question, but it (and the resources the answers point to) doesn't give you much to go on, and I can't really vouch for any of the answers either since I don't do AS development on my Mac.\nTextEdit should open your script in plaintext mode with no issues, though. If you just want to give it a quick read, you might just have to go with TextEdit for now until you can acquire Flash or another IDE.\nThe reason why it used to work on your old Mac, presumably, is because you had Flash or a different IDE that designated .as files as ActionScript files, overriding the system default of AppleSingle file. Based on this, installing Flash should be enough to get your Mac to recognize .as files as ActionScript files.\n\nA: And, while not trying to be pedantic (HAH!) you can change the default application these are being opened with easily enough.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get info on one of the .as files\n\n*Under the Open With: section of the get info window select the application you want it to open with.\n\n*The Change All button should then be available so you can change all .as files to open with the app of choice.\n\n\nA: That's because macOS treats .as files as AppleSingle archives: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleSingle_and_AppleDouble_formats\n", "Q: TextEdit hangs when trying to reopen documents. Can I recover all documents except the one causing problems? I was using TextEdit with a number of unsaved documents open. I then attempted to paste an unreasonably large RTF table into a new document. After watching TextEdit beachball for about 5 minutes, I used force quit and reopened it. This caused it to hang and not open any documents, presumably because it was trying to reopen the partially-pasted enormous document that caused it to hang in the first place.\nAfter about 10 minutes I force quit again and tried to reopen it again. It put up a dialog asking: The last time you opened TextEdit, it was force quit while reopening windows. Do you want to try to reopen its windows again?\nIf I choose reopen, it hangs again. When I right-click on its icon in the dock, I can actually see the titles of all the documents I had open, but I can't switch to any of them. \nIf I choose \"don't reopen,\" will my unsaved documents and changes be lost? Is there any way to recover them outside of TextEdit, or to tell TextEdit to stop trying to reopen that one fatal document?\nI am not using iCloud, and I was not connected to my Time Machine drive when the problem occurred. \n\nA: Eventually I gave in and told TextEdit not to reopen windows. It immediately opened, and the documents that had never been saved were still there. Only the named / saved documents had been closed. The document that was causing the problems was also open and usable, though I'm not sure if the paste operation had completed or whether it just had as much of the text as it had been able to cram in before the initial crash. \nThe overall answer is that choosing \"don't reopen\" was safe. TextEdit behaved reasonably and didn't, as far as I can tell, lose any data. \n", "Q: Client Management of MacBook Pros My team is starting to get large enough (9 and growing) that I'm looking for some thoughts on best ways to support our MacBook Pros & Airs. I'm fairly new to Macs though, much more comfortable with Linux. But now I'm looking for best practices to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Configure and deploy new Macs (or repurpose existing ones)\n\n*Install and manage software of Macs that are in active use\n\n*Install software updates from Apple & third-party developers\n\n*Provide secure login and user experience management on each Mac\n\n*Inventory or asset management\n\n\nI don't think I need enterprise solutions (and don't have a enterprise budget) but would like any pointers on best way to go about this. \n\nA: I work as the Mac admin for a large non profit.  At the moment I oversee roughly 200~ or so Macs, both in our main office and deployed across the world.  The Mac influx has only been a thing for the past 3-4 years, before that they were largely windows based and as such are deeply intrenched in MS Exchange and Active Directory.  Now that Macs make up about 35-40% of the user base, and are growing rapidly, that may change.  However, this is still the environment.  This is how I deal with the questions you posed...\n\n\n*\n\n*Configuring and deploying of new/existing Macs: This is largely handled by DeployStudio.  I have scripts and a workflow in place that mostly automate the process of installing all the base software (MS Office, Citrix Receiver, etc), custom user settings (user template, dock settings, Finder preferences, etc), base admin account creation, printer drivers, etc.  This is the workflow I apply to all new Macs that come in the door, it is done without first wiping and imaging the Mac, a process referred to as thin imaging.  For existing Macs that need to be redeployed I will reimage them using an image that has been created from comparable new Macs that have new software (just pulled 10.9.2 from a MacBook Pro Retina for example) and then apply the same workflow I mentioned before.  New Macs take about 5 minutes to complete from unboxing to ready to deploy, re-deployed Macs take about 30 minutes due to the larger image.  All of this is done via net boot and can be done anywhere in our 6 story building.  Profile Manager is later used to deploy different settings and whatnot.\n\n*Install and manage software of Macs that are in active use: This is mostly handled through Apple Remote Desktop (ARD).  You can use free tools such as PackageMaker, IceBerg, etc to create a custom installation package (if needed) and then remotely install that to either a single Mac or groups of Macs using ARD.  I believe ARD costs about $80 but in my experience it pays for itself rather quickly.  It has lots of management tools built in, allowing you to VNC control Macs, send scripts, install packages, etc.  I have a second install of ARD on our main Mac server, which I use as a Task Server.  I can set up installations on that server and as Macs come online it pushes out the installations to them, which is great since we have lots of staff coming and going at all times.  Another popular tool for this is Munki, which I don't have much experience with but am starting to look at.  Most Mac admins tend to swear by it.\n\n*Install software updates from Apple & third-party developers: I use the built in Software Update Serve (SUS) and Caching Server provided by Mac OS X Server.  The SUS allows you to serve out and manage (blocking/allowing updated) software updates from your local Mac server.  The drawback to this is it can only serve out updates for systems matching it's OS version and older, Macs need to be configured to look for it specifically, etc.  Caching Server is proving to be a better fit.  It requires to configuration on the client end, caches and serves out Mac App Store, iOS App Store, iBooks and Apple software updates.  Its only downside is that you can't block certain updates.  This is another area where a lot of people use Munki.  For third party updates (usually Flash, Java, etc) I'll create an installer package then push it out via ARD.\n\n*Provide secure login and user experience management on each Mac: As I mentioned we use Active Directory (AD) for the majority of our user account control.  I also bind all of our Macs to the Open Directory (OD) on our main Mac server, which allows for more Mac centric controls.  Beyond that each Mac has a local administrator account, which is what we use for connecting via ARD and whatnot.  New users sign in at the login screen, it checks Active Directory, pulls their info and creates a Mobile Account, which allows them to still login when their outside our network.\n\n*Inventory or asset management: Right now we use Spiceworks, free help desk software, that has a lot of this built in.  It scans the network on a user set schedule and adds new Macs/devices as they are found.  It's built more for Windows / AD use but it is ok with Macs.  We're currently exploring other options.\nAdditional - If I were you I would seek to make use of OS X Server.  It has relatively meager system requirements so you could likely find and use an old iMac or Mac mini for relatively cheap.  The Server app itself is $20, ARD is $80.  All in all it's pretty cost effective to setup a Mac server environment using their tools.  Once setup you can do the majority of things that larger software/management tools, like JAMF Casper and whatnot, offer for much greater costs.  It's likely not as smooth but it will still save you lots of time.\nHope that helps!\n\nA: While you may get some good help here I thought I would insert my 2cents about other resources. I have to deal with macs in business situations but it is usually (unfortunately) at most a few in a mostly Windows network. \nThat being said macintouch.com is a real good place to ask that question.

But my friend could not open it.\nMy friend is using an Ipad mini MD528KN/A.\nShe has no access to a computer.\nI am using a PC.\nHow to solve the problem.\nRegards Gustaf\n\nA: Depends on the file, a LOT.\nThe iPad has no (visible) filesystem. So unlike a Mac or PC you can't move things around as you wish. You have to have an application that will deal with it in the form you send it via the method you send it by.\nYes you can send an .mp3 but there is no way to then add it to the music.app without a Mac or PC and iTunes. The same goes for MS Office files, Photoshop files and many other proprietary file formats.\nPerhaps if you edited your question to say specifically what kind of file and what she needs to do with it, we could be of more assistance.\n\nLike @stuffe said a free Dropbox account could help you with this. Dropbox will let you play videos right in their file browser as long as they are generally playable on your Mac (EG H.264, MP4, MOV files, etc.) Dropbox is free for up to 2GB of storage.\n\nA: As @SteveChambers says it depends what the file is as to whether they will be able to open it.  If it's simple small files such as documents, then maybe email will be sufficient.  Larger documents can be shared by something such as DropBox which will provide a filesystem like structure to share files, but even then if the files particularly large or from a less simple application say from a CAD package etc, then they may also require a native iPad App to be able to load the file into after receiving it.\n", "Q: Official way to obtain an OS X ISO file I'm trying to install OS X Mavericks in VirtualBox on Windows 8.1. I have VirtualBox installed and the VM set up, but I need an ISO file to install the operating system.\nI've searched around and found one result one a website I hadn't heard of, but Google Chrome flagged it as malware. I found a file on CNet, but it's an upgrade file for machines that are running an earlier version of OS X.\nIs there an official source for downloading OS X ISO files? If not, is it possible to get the required ISO file without already having access to OS X?\n\nA: Does not work on Mavericks and Yosemite\nThere is no way to legitimately get the file without having access to a Mac, and a licensed copy of the OS via a purchase (unless you are a member of the Developer Program, for which you can expect to pay far more than the cost of the OS, what with it being free).\nBut if you can blag some access time on a Mac, then you can download the OS from the Mac App Store (You may need to Option+Click the Purchased section to force it to reshow them if you have downloaded them at least once already).  Once you have the installer downloaded and sat in your dock, you can simply pick it apart and get to  the image file that is inside it.\nThis is the official way to get the file direct from Apple, but there is still work to do to make it into an ISO:\n\n*\n\n*Once you’ve downloaded Mavericks, find the installer on your Mac. It’s called Install OS X Mavericks.app and it should have been downloaded to your main Applications folder or be sat in your Dock.\n\n\n*Right-click (or Control+click) the installer, and choose Show Package Contents from the resulting contextual menu.\n\n\n*In the folder that appears, open Contents > Shared Support; you’ll see a disk image file called InstallESD.dmg\nThis dmg file is in essence an ISO file in s slightly different format.  We'll need to convert it.  Open up Disk Utility and:\n\n\n*From the menu bar, select Images > Convert and point it to your .dmg file\n\n\n*In the Save As dialog that follows, select DVD/CD master. Disk Utility will insist on saving the new ISO as a .cdr file, but it is really an ISO.\n\n\n*When complete, you can rename it to .iso in Finder.\n\n\n*Use an external HD or thumb drive which is in ExFAT format (Compared to FAT format, this allows for single files larger than 4GB). Copy the .iso file and access it on the other system.\nFor clarity, you can do the above on any version of OS X from 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) onwards, so you can use an old image to get hold of a new image for example, if you have access to a different OS version than Mavericks.\n\nA: The same as given by stuffe.\nYou can format your flash drive to ExFAT format which allows for access both on Windows and Mac. The file size restriction of FAT is not present on ExFAT.\n\nA: The answer above by @stuffe won't work on Mavericks. Apparently Apple has changed the format of the ESD image and it's no longer bootable.\nLooking around I've found a couple of pointers on how to do the necessary conversions to get the result as something you can boot a VM off.\nDepending on what's the purpose of the ISO file, if it's to reinstall a computer, it might be more useful to use a Bootable USB- For that, check How to: Create a bootable installation for OS X Mavericks 10.9 and above.\nFor the ISO file itself, I've mostly used the information found on this post on the InsanelyMac site, augmented with the information/tip on creating a Recovery Partition found on the Apple Support Communities.\nBasically the process is to get the ESD image, and rebuild it to include some info that is now packaged as symlinks, and get that out as a ISO file. The author of the InsanelyMac post has automated the process into a bash script, that I'm pasting here for convenience/reference:\n#!/bin/bash\nESD=$1\nTMP=$2\n\nif [ -z \"$ESD\" ] || [ -z \"$TMP\" ]; then\n    echo usage: \"'$0' /path/to/esd /path/to/tmpdir\"\n    exit 1\nfi\nif ! [ -e \"$ESD\" ]; then\n    echo \"file '$ESD' does not exist\"\n    exit 1\nfi\nif ! [ -e \"$TMP\" ]; then\n    echo \"dir '$TMP' does not exist\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nMPAPP=/Volumes/install_app\nMPIMG=/Volumes/install_img\nIMGSPARSE=$TMP/install.sparseimage\nIMGDVD=$TMP/install.cdr\n\ndetach_all() {\n  if [ -d \"$MPAPP\" ]; then hdiutil detach \"$MPAPP\"; fi\n  if [ -d \"$MPIMG\" ]; then hdiutil detach \"$MPIMG\"; fi\n}\nexit_all() {\n  echo +++ Command returned with error, aborting ...\n  exit 2\n}\n\ntrap detach_all EXIT\ntrap exit_all ERR\n\necho +++ Trying to unmount anything from previous run\ndetach_all\n\necho +++ Mount the installer image\nhdiutil attach \"$ESD\" -noverify -nobrowse -readonly -mountpoint \"$MPAPP\"\n\n\necho +++ Convert the boot image to a sparse bundle\nrm -f \"$IMGSPARSE\"\nhdiutil convert \"$MPAPP\"/BaseSystem.dmg -format UDSP -o \"$IMGSPARSE\"\n\n\necho +++ Increase the sparse bundle capacity to accommodate the packages\nhdiutil resize -size 8g \"$IMGSPARSE\"\n\necho +++ Mount the sparse bundle for package addition\nhdiutil attach \"$IMGSPARSE\" -noverify -nobrowse -readwrite -mountpoint \"$MPIMG\"\n\necho +++ Remove Package link and replace with actual files\nrm -f \"$MPIMG\"/System/Installation/Packages\ncp -rp \"$MPAPP\"/Packages \"$MPIMG\"/System/Installation/\n\necho +++ Unmount the installer image\nhdiutil detach \"$MPAPP\"\n\necho +++ Unmount the sparse bundle\nhdiutil detach \"$MPIMG\"\n\necho +++ Resize the partition in the sparse bundle to remove any free space\nhdiutil resize -sectors min \"$IMGSPARSE\"\n\necho +++ Convert the sparse bundle to ISO/CD master\nrm -f \"$IMGDVD\"\nhdiutil convert \"$IMGSPARSE\" -format UDTO -o \"$IMGDVD\"\n\necho +++ Remove the sparse bundle\nrm \"$IMGSPARSE\"\n\necho \"Done\"\necho \"Find your DVD at '$IMGDVD'\"\n\nI can confirm that the resulting image is indeed bootable within Fusion; it's in the process of being installed so I'm yet to see whether other \"tricks\" are needed to make it work (for example, if the result is lacking a Recovery Partition as stated in some of the threads).\nUPDATE: The resulting VM boots, and appears to work \"well\". I have used the method described to create a recovery partition, but even though Carbon Copy \"sees\" a Recovery Partition on the (virtual) HD, it doesn't appear to work all that well, as booting the VM with Option key pressed doesn't do anything. Will look into it if I have time, but for the time being it appears that the .iso file I got is working. \n\nA: There is no official way to run OS X on a virtual machine in Windows.

I downloaded two songs on my computer and now I want to get them on my phone, but my version of iTunes is outdated, and my computers slow, also I'd rather just get it through iCloud on my phone. The songs are not showing up on my phone. Is there any way to possibly 'refresh' iCloud so the songs will show up without plugging in my phone?\n\nA: You need to turn on Automatic Downloads in Settings > iTunes & App Store > Automatic Downloads > Music/Apps/Books/Updates in order to get the phone to download anything you buy on the Mac/PC automatically.  You may need to be on a WiFi network, or select the Use Mobile Data option if you are using cell network to download.\nIn addition, you can also just hop into the iTunes Store on the iPhone, search for the items and then download them manually (you won't be charged again, the Buy option will be replaced with an icon of a cloud with a down arrow), or check your Purchased tab (may be under the More section depending how you have it configured) to list your purchases and have the ability to just show stuff Not on This iPhone.\nAlternatively, if you turn on Settings > Music > Show All Music it should show all your purchases inline in the Music App, and allow you to stream or download them at will directly from within the app, but note it will show all purchases, even that Miley Cyrus you are now embarrassed to own...\n", "Q: Can not share WiFi from Macbook Pro to other devices via Bluetooth PAN First of all, this problem is detailed in this discussion at Apple's forum.\nI basically have the exactly same problem.\nStatus indicator is always yellow under \"Bluetooth PAN\" in Network Panel.\nThe status says:\nBluetooth PAN has a self-assigned IP address and will not be able to connect to the Internet.\nI tried on both iPad and Android devices, doesn't work. There is an icon on the upper left corner of iPad indicates connected to Bluetooth PAN. However, there is no internet access.\nAny suggestions on this issue?\n\nA: I ran into the same problem when reverse tethering my Samsung phone (Android 5.1.1) to access the Internet connection on my Macbook Air (El Capitan), and found a successful solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your mobile device is paired via Bluetooth and follow Heiko Haller's\nsteps for Internet Sharing settings. \n\n*Under System Preferences > Network, select the active Internet connection \n(e.g., USB LAN) and note the IP Address, Subnet Mask and Router numbers. \n\n*Select Bluetooth PAN in the same Network window, click the Advanced button \nin the lower right to open its configuration panel.\n\n*Under the TCP/IP tab, select 'Manually' from the Configure IPv4 drop-down \nmenu, and copy the information from Step 2 in the three relevant fields.\n\n*Select 'Link-local only' next to Configure IPv6. \n\n*Click OK to close the Bluetooth PAN panel, hit Apply in the Network window.\n\n*On the mobile device, go to Settings > Bluetooth and click on the cog icon next to\nthe paired Macbook and turn on 'Internet access'.\nIt's been a couple of hours and so far, the connection seems stable. \nEdit: An incoming regular call broke the connection, and unpairing and re-pairing the device appear to have restored it. \nEdit2: The IP Address and Router numbers may change each time you connect to the Internet, so be sure to update the Bluetooth PAN settings accordingly.\n\nA: I am not sure sharing an Internet connection over Bluetooth works on osx.\nIf it does, it should work like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Settings > Sharing \n\n*Select \"Internet Sharing\" but do not click the checkbox yet\n\n*on the right, select 'share your connection from:' 'Wifi'\n\n*below, check 'Bluetooth PAN' if it exists\n\n*Now check the Internet Sharing checkbox on the left.\n\n\nIf 'Bluetooth PAN' is not in the list, it is mybe not supported to share internet via bluetooth.\n\nA: I followed the instructions above but the IP address 192.168.1.14 did not work for me.  \nI did however find a solution.  While the PAN interface was connected, I ran ifconfig in terminal.  There was a bridge interface with the IP address 192.168.2.1.  So I set my PAN Interface to match and reconnected.

/Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/usr/libexec/afctl -a [ip-address], but that is both time-consuming and pretty dumb. I've tried using some of the tools offered by my MacPorts tree, but they don't seem to work, and I'm concerned that anything I install might be conflicting with the built-in firewall.\nIs there software for OS X that will automate firewall changes in response to repeated failed attempts or perhaps some other way to reduce the risk of brute force log in attempts succeeding?\n\nA: If your server is on the public internet, it will get hundreds of automated log in attempts on whatever ports it listens. You will want to either set up an external firewall, use the existing ipfw/pfctl tools Apple ships or perhaps get a package like fail2ban which can be installed easily if you already have the homebrew tool. \nYou can test with ipfw and pfctl yourself and block a test IP from ssh and verify that there is no interference from Apple's firewall rules, but I've not experienced anyone that knows how to use the command line from breaking things if they have local access and know how to unconfigure a ruleset that has unintended consequences.\nThat would allow you to to have the firewall block repeated attempts after a threshold of failed attempts in a time range. It's not perfect, but can reduce the size of your log files and reduce the change someone will brute force an account or guess a common password.\nThis would be a good way to secure things if you can't use VPN or another firewall to reduce the number of listening ports your OS X server exposes to the internet in general.\n\nA: I don´t know what do you want exactly so I could give you only some advises:\n\n\n*\n\n*Don´t connect a server directly to the internet - install a firewall in front of the server (different system, different operating system) and only allow the ports do you want to be accessible from the internet.\n\n*If you need to connect your server directly to the internet (again: bad decision) configure your firewall like Apple described in their support file \n\n*If you need to get the ssh and screensharing port (for example) from the internet let´s have a look at fail2ban - they have a wiki entry for OSX server\nAnd please: edit your question to let us know what do you want exactly.\n\nA: Short answer: There is no option in any firewall tools to prevent brute force attacks. A firewall tool only could block/allow/mangle a connection (as I know).\nA little bit longer answer: To prevent a brute force attack you need a tool that could measure how often (and how short the pauses between every try) a biunique source will connect a special destination on your server. One of these tool is fail2ban as I wrote in (my/the) first answer (converted from bmike into a comment).\nAll other answers that I already gave are always valid - please first check if it will necessary that you connect your server directly to internet.\n", "Q: osx hosts file not working my hosts file looks like this\nit should open facebook if you try to open google\n173.252.110.27 google.com\n##\n# Host Database\n#\n# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface\n# when the system is booting.

I need colors for the categories and I must set them, too.\nThank you in Advance!\n\nA: I spoke to an Apple Supervisor today who confirmed that the iPhone iOS currently is not set up to enable one to have different color categories for different types of appointments in a single calendar, but he agreed that it is a good idea. He said the best way of increasing the likelihood that Apple will make this enhancement is to go to www.apple.com/feedback and to make this enhancement request. He said the more people that ask for it the greater the likelihood Apple will make the modification. So please go to www.apple.com/feedback and request this enhancement.\n\nA: We use categories to register labour types for our project software and project billing. With Apple's mail it is indeed not possible. You can register categories using OWA, which is an app from Microsoft available thru Apple's appstore at no charge. But it requires of course an Exchange environment accessible through an URL. URL-s of apps: iphone, ipad\n\nA: It is a bit of a fudge but it works; you need the WeekCal app.\nWeekCal syncs with Exchange and has a feature where you can set a rule to apply selected colours to created or imported events. For example I use red for medical appointments in exchange and type rz somewhere in the location.  The rule I have set up in WeekCal is any event with rz anywhere in the location field is coloured red.  Easy.\n", "Q: infinite eject buttons appearing in menu bar My menu bar automatically fills in all empty space with eject buttons. How can I remedy this problem?

I don't know what time I'm going to be shopping so I don't set them to have a 'Remind me on day' or 'Remind me at location' set.\nI want this list to appear in my notification center (where I will see it without necessarily seeking it out) but it won't, unless I give it a reminder time/location.\nIs there a way to have reminders appear in notification center/lock screen without time/location reminders set?\n\nA: I don't think there is a way to get reminders to appear on the lock screen without putting either a time or a location stamp on them.\nHowever, if you know where you will be doing this shopping, then the location-based reminders will actually work well for you. Just set up a new contact with the store's name and address (and, optionally, the phone number if there's any chance you might ever need to call them). Then you can use the \"Remind me at a location\" option and select the name of that store. Make sure you select \"Arriving at\" rather than \"When I leave\". Your reminder will go off the next time you go to that store regardless of what day it is.\nUnfortunately this will only work if you do know where you will be doing this shopping. If you were thinking of something like \"Remind me to check the oil next time I gas the car\", then I'm not sure what to suggest aside from doing a \"when I leave home\" reminder (which would have to be refreshed every time you leave home for a different purpose and which therefore would probably be more trouble than it's worth.) \nI've used this technique several times, simply by entering the names and addresses of my local shopping mall and local grocery store into Contacts, then hitting a location-based reminder. This is actually how I do my grocery lists: whenever I need to add something I just edit the reminder. Next time I go to the grocery store, there's my list right on my lock screen. If it's a long list I might need to unlock the phone to see the whole thing, but overall I've found it works great. (Certainly much easier than working with a handwritten list which I had a bad habit of forgetting to take with me when I went shopping....)\n** Please note, though, that the size of the geofence depends on many factors and your phone might consider you to have \"arrived at\" a particular location when you are actually a few blocks away. This has occasionally caused my grocery list to pop up prematurely if I'm just passing by the store rather than going in.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Mac Terminal and Vim syntax coloring on CentOS server I am using a Mac Terminal window to ssh to a CentOS server.

I have an iPhone 4, and one of their recent updates added an 'always online' feature, where the user can receive messages even if Skype isn't open on their device.\nLately I've been using Skype on my desktop PC, and any message sent to me also appears on my iPhone, and it gets a bit annoying after a while.\nSkype for iPhone has no settings, and I've turned off all notifications for Skype in the iOS notification centre, but however I still get notifications of the messages that I receive on Skype.\nI've looked briefly for a solution to this, but I can't find anything specific to my usage case.\nTwo questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can Skype notifications for new messages be switched off on my iPhone- Switching all notifications off for Skype does not do anything.\n\n*Is it possible to stop it from showing me as Online all the time? It's inconvenient because I recieve business messages when I'm trying to sleep, and I require to be contactable 24/7 so I can be contacted by my customers if they have a fault with their gameserver (I offer gameserver hosting)- but being able to IM me 24/7 isn't what I want.\n\nA: You may want to set your status to Offline. Or remove Skype app from the running task list (double-tap on Home, switch into Skype area and swipe to the top to get rid of it).\nIf that won't work and it changes back to Online, this potentially could happen when you're logged into your account multiple times from different devices, so the statuses could be not in sync.\nFor workaround there are some cloud-based chat commands which allows you to see where you're logged in and you can logout from the remote sessions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an empty conversation.\n\n*Type command in the message textbox: \n/showplaces\n\n\nLists other endpoints that can receive push notifications for calls and IMs for this Skype account.\n\n\n*If you want to logout from remote online endpoints, then execute:\n/remotelogout\n\n\nSign out all other instances except the current one. This will also stop push notifications on all other instances.\n\n\nOther workaround could include changing your Skype password to make remote Skype clients sign out. \n\nA: I do not think the new update shows you Online all the time, it just forwards all messages/notifications to your mobile devices so you receive copies whether or not you are Online. I agree this is annoying, there should be an in-app setting for disabling this. I don't know why there isn't one. It is a feature, not a requirement. You can always just sign out of the mobile app and use signing in/signing out to enable/disable notifications. An inconvenient workaround but it should work.\n\nA: Try the /remotelogout command\nsource: http://community.skype.com/t5/Windows-desktop-client/Extreme-online-status-bug/m-p/2989680#M241734\n\nA: Put your profile to invisible or offline when you don't want to be contacted and see how that works.

It doesnt seem to work though, it says \"(null)\". Do I need the same apple id on my ipad thats with the new gc??? Sorry if this is too complicated...\n\nA: Unfortunately Supercell does not use Game Center to store progress or files of your CoC account.

It works when I use four-fingers, and it functions as usual whenever I open my System Preferences and reset the Mission Control and Expose section to use three-fingers gesture (instead of four-fingers). However, it's set to three-fingers at first, and it's just that I first disable it and then enable it again...\nThe symptom occurs whenever I restart my Mac, so it's nothing but tedious to bother to open my System Preferences to check off and then on to the Mission Control and Expose checkboxes. As I said, when I reset the setting, it works as usual.\nMy trackpad is Apple's Bluetooth trackpad, and my Mac Pro is late-2013 machine. I also use mid-2012 MacBook Pro with Retina display, and while it might occur on the machine at times (maybe only a couple of times per 1,000 sessions), I have not had such issues almost usually.\nIs there anything that I should investigate further? PRAM and SMC didn't resolve the issue... I'm curious to know why it occurs whenever I restart my Mac, and how to solve the issue.\nI use the latest version of Mavericks.\n\nA: This sometimes happens to me, where the 3-finger macro stops working. Seems like OSX just bugs out. My hotfix right now is to open the command line and run killall Dock. Seems to work fine for resetting it and getting it working again.\n\nA: I had the same issue on macOS Catalina (and I had it on macOS Mojave as well. The problem with Mission Control was the reason I upgraded), but it turns out it was Mission Control that not worked (would not open using keyboard either). This solved it for me;\n\n*\n\n*Open a command line shell in Terminal application (search for Terminal in Spotlight if you're not familiar)\n\n\n*Copy and paste the following command:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock mcx-expose-disabled -bool FALSE\n\n\n*Copy and paste the following command (restart the OSX Dock):\nkillall Dock\n\nA: What I did was to turn of all gestures that use three fingers, shut down, power up then re-enable all three figure gestures, and this worked. \n\nA: As far as I have searched for the similar issues on the Web, I'm sure this is a bug by Apple. The interim solution is turn both the Mission Control and Expose checkbox off on the System Preferences | Trackpad, and then use BetterTouchTool to allocate the three-fingers swipes to the two actions.\nI also tried to create a launchd on which I overwrite the default setting with defaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad TrackpadThreeFingerVertSwipeGesture -int 2, but it didn't work.\n\nA: \nThe trackpad gesture to call Mission Control or Expose with three-fingers does sometimes not work for some reasons\n\nIf your other finger gestures are still working, then the reason why Three Finger Swipe seems to stop working and work only on occasion is because:\n\n\n*\n\n*Three Finger Swipe only switches between FULL SCREEN applications or windows. If you have your screen configured so that you can see your dock bar while on an internet browser, you are probably not in full screen. Press the Green button (Upper Left Usually) right next to the yellow and red, until your dock disappears and your Current Screen takes up the whole monitor. Then double check if your Three Finger Swipe is on and working.\n\n\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Why are the hidden files/directories seen in Terminal color settings? When I tried to set my Terminal color by importing a color scheme stored in ~/Dropbox/.personal/myColor.Terminal, it didn't display the hidden directories, including ~/Dropbox/.personal (and other files and directories I store to my Dropbox root, such as .vimrc or .gvimrc).\nWhy does this not display it? I always show those hidden directories by setting the AppleShowAllFiles property in com.apple.finder to 1.\nIt's just the Terminal color setting import pane that I recognize to NOT be displayed - in other words, I've seen those hidden files everywhere on my daily use.\nI can just move the color scheme file temporarily to import it on my Terminal - just want to know why such incongruity occurs.\nI use the latest version of OS X Mavericks. Any feedbacks would be appreciated.\nUpdate\nI got that it's not only Terminal, but it can be applied to other applications as well, on which when you do Open Files or Import or similar operations, most applications don't display those hidden files. As far as I know, only MacVim has a checkbox option to open those hidden files.\n\nA: If I understand you correctly, this likely has to do with how terminals work. In bash they are hidden by most aliases of ls.\nTry ls -a or \\ls -a if that isn't working. This is to show all files and escape an alias you might have.\nPut simply, the terminal doesn't care about finder preferences because it isn't finder.  \nIf not, then perhaps terminal simply doesn't respect the finder settings.\n", "Q: Founded iPhone. need help!

Should he jailbreak it? I think he should return it to the owner but he wants to sell it.\n\nA: If he restored the phone to factory settings then they can not track the phone using Find My iPhone.  He will not be able to get past the activation lock, and that is on purpose to reduce a thief's incentive to steal it.   The only possible way would be to take it to Apple and claim he forgot the Apple ID he used on it, but then if (and I hope they would) check the device ID against their sale records they will find it does not belong to him and they will contact the original owner.

Apple's tech specs for the Thunderbolt Display merely lists a:\n\nBuilt-in FaceTime HD camera with microphone\n\nI've not been able to find what the maximum possible resolution is.

As for maximum resolution, open Quicktime to do a video recording thru the camera and set the quality to maximum.

[OgreMain/CMakeFiles/OgreMain.dir/src/OgreFont.cpp.o] Error 1\n\n\nA: I've worked this around by myself. \nActually the problem seems to be involved when I followed this instruction to create a symlink like this:\n$ sudo ln -s /usr/local/include/freetype2 /usr/local/include/freetype\n\nAfter I removed the symlink, brew worked successfully.\n", "Q: How to export a slo-mo video with the slow motion intact and without losing quality? I have a nicely exquisite slo-mo video.  I would like it to export to my computer. \nSimply copying the file by plugging into the USB cable loses all the slo-mo edits. \nDoing an export via Share by Email seems to lose the quality (it compresses it).\nI don't want to export it to YouTube, Facebook or anything like that.  \nHow can I get it to my computer so that I can email it to my friends? \n\nA: Open iMovie, load your slow mo video in a project, no need for filters or text etc.\nNow go to your export screen, select the upload button. Scroll down and select: \"keep video\" or \"Save file\".  ( I have a dutch language phone so I'm not sure what the English text will be). Save in 720p.\nWhen you connect your phone to the computer you can see it as an extra drive \"Internal storage\". Select it, go into the DCIM folder and select the subfolder. Mine is called: \"947ugfff\" but anyway it is not the folder where your foto's and vids are but the folder where the saved videos from iMovie go.\nDrag and drop and you're done!\n\nA: Quicktime Player can convert iPhone/iOS slo-mo movies to a 'regular' movie that plays everywhere:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open slow motion video in QuickTime Player,\n\n*Optionally trim the clip or edit the slo-mo duration,\n\n*File -> Export as..., and choose setting and location.\n\n\nA: Finally I found the best solution for me. Tried to import via Final Cut X but I am not sure it makes sense. Next I imported slow motion video from my iPhone via USB cable and opened Preview app that comes with a Mac and imported from here! Totally worked and I got .mov files out that I could open in quicktime and click cmd i and it showed 120 frames per second. \nOption that didn't work:\n1. sending via airdrop from photos app on iPhone to Mac - the framerate is changed to around 40-60fps.\n2. uploading the video to dropbox or pcloud changes the framerate to 30 fps.\n3. exporting video from Photos on Mac mini and saving them to iCloud Drive and then downloading them on my Mac Pro to edit also changes the framerate in the file...!?\nKind regards Mark Barner\n\nA: I used the iPhone's imovie app to just add a simple filter, then it will allow you to export the video while keeping the slow motion intact. \nI'd suggest adding a filter or even Just trimming a small bit or something so iMovie allows you to export it (doesn't give you the option unless you make some sort of edit).\nVoila!\n\nA: I found a simple &fast way to get your Slow-Motion videos onto your computer. This method is also without applying an effect, but by simply adding a blank text. \nUse the iMovie in app editor, then click add text, get rid of the sample text and then save. \nThe video is saved now and can be easily shared, however when transferring to the computer it is still playing back at 120fps (or 240fps for iPhone 6).\nSo far, I only found one simple method that will allow you to transfer the slow motion video with it being 30fps. \nDownload the app iFile free. Tap the bottom right arrow to import a video from your Camera roll into the app. \nThe video will be imported. Now you just have to connect your iPhone to iTunes, go to the app section, and select iFile Free and drag the video to the desktop. \nThat's it, you have your slow-motion video with no compression in 720p. \n\nA: The reason importing it directly onto your computer doesn't appear to work is due to the way the iPhone plays back slomo videos.\nThe video itself isn't shot in \"slomo\", so to speak. Rather, it's shot at 120 frames per second, a typically higher frame rate than normal video recording.\nThis is significant because if you were to playback that video at 30 fps, the videos would appear to be playing in smooth slow motion because there is 4 times the frames to display. So, when you playback a video the iPhone is converting the selected section of the 120fps video into 30fps, giving it the slow motion effect -  the whole video COULD be watched at a normal speed with no problem. When you import the file onto your computer, it is just a 120fps video file - it doesn't know when or where to convert it to 30fps, which is why it appears as if it \"lost\" the slomo when really it's playing in its native 120fps.\nYou can easily restore that slomo effect with almost any video editing software by slowing down the video (to 30fps, or any other speed for that matter) , just as your iPhone would do - you just have to do it manually (which could be better in some cases).\nAlternatively, you should be able to imessage your video from your phone to your Mac without any considerable quality loss.\n\nA: Quick and dirty solution that can be done entirely on iPhone that just worked for me: Do a screen recording as you watch the video on your phone, make sure to tap away the control bars and have audio on during your 3 second countdown (may take you a couple tries to get this right), naturally it will capture the slow-motion, now upload the screen recording video to YouTube or e-mail to your friends.\n\nA: This is for video captured at 240 FPS in slow-mo:\nIf you are just looking to play the video with mpv, use the following command:\nmpv --vf 'lavfi=[setpts=6*PTS]' --af 'atempo=0.66667,atempo=0.5,atempo=0.5' filename.MOV\n\nThe audio may sound strange this way but the multiple atempo filters are required to reach 44100 Hz / 6 (7350 Hz), without affecting pitch. If you don't mind affecting pitch, use --af asetrate=7350.\n\nA: You need to copy the video to your pc and then open it in after effects or premiere. The frame rate will drop to 99fps unfortunately as both programs cannot accept higher fps. Then use twixtor plugin to make your movie slow motion\n", "Q: Email migration from Mac Mail to Outlook 2011 for Mac I think this topic must have been posted earlier also. \nI want to transfer my emails from mac mail to outlook 2011. When I go to import option in outlook 2011 and select the mac mail to import the mail boxes, all I get imported is blank folders every time.\nThe results were the same even after reinstalling office 2011.\nCan anyone share their views on this topic and I would be very greatful if anyone could provide me solution of this question on how to migrate the emails from Mac Mail to Outlook 2011.\n\nA: For transferring all your apple mail items in to Outlook 2011, there is a need of robust data format conversion process. This step helps you to migrate from one mail client to another. In this reference, an apple mail to Outlook 2011 converter is desired to fulfill to requirement. However, you can accomplish this task by manual method also but it faces some pitfalls.\nSo, check a review of required converter that i found as a resource on web mentioned below:\nhttp://download.cnet.com/Mail-Exporter-Pro/3000-2369_4-75877193.html\n", "Q: Embarrassing bug in Safari I have had a rather embarrassing bug for a while now. It has to do with safari on my iPad and adult websites.\nAfter every visit to one of those websites, I always clear my browser history. However, one page just sticks in my suggested websites. I only have to type in an \"X\" or a \"W\", and it pops up in the suggested websites, like shown here, even though I have cleared my history.\nIf anyone knows a solution to this somewhat embarrassing problem, I would be very grateful.\n\nA: Note that if you use iCloud on a Mac and your iPad (or other iOS devices) (the same account), open tabs will appear on the iPad and vice versa in the iCloud Tabs section (next to bookmarks on iPad). This could be where such a suggestion is coming from. I would suggest clearing history and cookies/data on all devices using iCloud (yes you will lose logged in state for many sites and will need to re-sign in).\nOn your iOS devices, make sure you are clearing your history and data using the Settings app, and not by manually deleting entries in Safari's bookmark menu. You can also disable Safari with iCloud using the Settings app under the iCloud section.\nAfter you have reset everything, when you want to visit sites and not keep history, you can use Safari's privacy mode. To do this in Safari (iOS 7), when you tap the address bar, tap Private above the keyboard on the left side to toggle privacy mode. If you are using a physical keyboard, this option will still show at the bottom of the screen.\nI use Chrome as my main browser on iOS. There you tap the button on the top right (next to the address bar most of the time) and then tap New Incognito* Tab to enter incognito mode.\n\n\n", "Q: How to prevent octave from spawning in a new Terminal window? I run octave in Terminal but whenever I use the Octave command to start octave (from an existing terminal session) or select Octave in Mission Control, it starts a new Terminal window. I find this behaviour annoying.\nHow can I make octave run in my current Terminal window?\n\nA: The actual script that executes when the new Terminal window is opened can be found at /usr/local/octave/3.8.0/bin/octave-3.8.0.  This path will be different for different versions of Octave.  To have this script run when you run the octave command, create a symbolic link to something like /usr/local/bin/octave (assuming /usr/local/bin is on your path).  \nThe command to run this would be something along the lines of:\nsudo ln -sf /usr/local/octave/3.8.0/bin/octave-3.8.0 /usr/local/bin/octave\n\n\nA: I'll take a shot at answering your question...\nIt sounds like your current Octave app is more or less a convenient wrapper for the scripts and such that you would otherwise have to run from the terminal to get things up and running. In other words, it's created for people that are trying to avoid interacting with the terminal directly (and since you seem to enjoy working directly from the command line, the app has lost a lot of its convenience).  \nAnyway, in my opinion (for what it's worth) your best bet is to ditch the Octave app and instead take a more hands-on approach and install Octave via a package manager like Homebrew (here are some instructions you can follow).\nHowever, a quick warning: Installing octave this way is occasionally a real pain-in-the-neck (and same goes for getting Octave to work with GNUplot). Though the links I've provided should be enough to help you get Octave set up the way you want, the installation process itself is not always, well, particularly pleasant (after all, those \"convenience wrappers\" exist for a reason). Just giving you a heads-up...\nHope this helps! \nAnother helpful tutorial which is similar to the first link.\nAnd still another (the title of this post is pretty revealing...).\n", "Q: Ban particular senders from having text appear in lockscreen My bank uses \"smsTAN\", so when I make a transfer, the TAN gets texted to me. I would like to prevent texts from my bank from appearing in the lock screen as this lowers the safety of this method (someone would just have to nab my phone and find out my five-letter online PIN, don't ask me why my bank still enforces five-letter PINs). \nI'd like to keep my other texts appearing in the lock screen.\n\nA: Although excluding specific contact's text from being shown on the Lock Screen is not possible, you could always switch off the Show Preview option. Therefore a notification of your bank will be shown, but no portion of this message will be previewed, safeguarding your five-letter PIN.\nTo do so just go to Settings / Notification Center / Messages and turn off Show Preview.\n", "Q: MBA mid-2013'' total freeze; hardware issue? Update (22nd September, 2014): Ever since I upgraded above a certain developer preview version of OS X Yosemite (DP4 or thereabouts) a couple of months ago, the problem described below has not recurred.\n\nI've got a mid-2013 13\" MacBook Air (Model Identifier: MacBookAir6,2) currently running Mavericks 10.9.2. that doesn't have any problems except (a potentially major) one: Sometimes when I'm playing a Flash video on Firefox (currently version 28.0), suddenly the screen will freeze completely - by \"completely\" I mean even the mouse pointer won't move. Usually the audio plays for maybe a second and two after the screen freezes before it stops too. (I'm guessing that just might be some kind of audio buffering in action.) The system goes completely unresponsive. I have to force a reboot by holding down the power key for several seconds.\nThis happens intermittently but frequently enough to be a cause of concern. I guess it must have happened around 3-4 times in the last month. The latest incident was last night.\nI have not experienced this problem except when I'm viewing a video online. I'm running the latest version of Adobe Flash Player (which, btw, has annoyingly frequent updates) and Firefox 28.0. but it has happened with previous versions of both. I mostly view only streaming videos on this laptop - only rarely do I play a downloaded video file with a media player app, so in that respect it's hard to say whether the problem is Firefox/Flash specific or more general. But I'm pretty sure it's never happened when I wasn't viewing a video. I believe it also happened on lower versions of Mavericks.\nI checked the system log in the Console app, and have not found any suspicious looking messages that could indicate what the problem could be, which makes me think it's something that happens all of a sudden - making it likely to be a hardware problem with the video subsystem. But I'm just guessing here. (There are also no log messages generated after the time of the freeze until I force a reboot, which would indicate that the system has in fact completely halted, rather than a case of unresponsive UI.)\nI have run \"Apple Diagnostics\" more than once and it reported no issues.\nHow can I diagnose this problem? Is there a more severe battery of hardware tests that I can run? Or should I look into using DTrace?\n\nA: Sounds like bad sectors on the harddisc/SSD. I have had similar experience. My Macbook air 2012 froze when I was playing music, everything else worked fine, then one day it totally stopped working (lookup Mac OSX grey folder for more information). I went it by the Apple store and they replaced my SSD.\n\nA: I experience this problem.\nFF was 28, now it's 29, Flash plugin version is 13.0.r0, Console logs are clean, I mean there are no any records for minutes before BOOT_TIME marker.\nTried to reinstall Adobe Flash,check disk using Disk Utility, disable all browser extensions.\nDefinitely, it's not a hardware problem because I can't reproduce it using another browser.\n\nA: There a few hardware issues that could cause your problem (ram, drive/SSD) but there are MANY software issues that could cause it. It helps to first prove which it is.\nIf you boot that computer by another hard drive, you can test whether the issue is hardware or software. Once you have that answer, you can proceed to the next step.\nYou do have an external hard drive with an appropriate OS and all of your fix-it utilities on it, don't you? :D\nNo? Maybe it's time to make one!\n", "Q: How do I force Safari 5.1.7 to ask to remember my Gmail password? Safari 5.1.7 remembers my Gmail user name but will not ask me if I want it to save my password.  As I use Gmail often, this would be a real timesaver. How can I force Safari to ask?\n\nA: Copy the code from this page http://ostermiller.org/bookmarklets/rememberpass.js into the address field of a new bookmark, effectively creating what's known as a bookmarklet.  \nOnce created, click on the bookmarklet while on the gmail login page.  Wait for the page to refresh and then enter your password.  If done correctly, the browser will ask to remember your password.\n"]
